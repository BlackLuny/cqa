2DAfAjv2aa	I agree with you on your Ascendant theory. Since our rising sign is how we choose to present ourselves to the world, and how we deal with everyday situations, I definitely think it influences our wardrobe. I would say that the first house is a very important factor to consider as well. <br>  <br>  Contrary to my happy Sagittarius ascendant, I choose dark colors to wear the majority of the time. Though, my current mood helps me pick out what clothes I'm going to wear as well. I have Neptune in the first, but I don't think I go for a particularly arsty look, unless you count things like bracelets and necklaces.<br>  <br>  I suppose Aquarius Rising people, or ones with Uranus aspecting their ascendant, would choose to dress creatively.|`|PIjCNYQNaa	I think Air signs (especially Gemini's) would be Artsy in their clothes.

There is one song in particular that I really enjoy, she's doing guest vocals with some alternative band I wish I could remember the name!! I'm definitely going to have to look fir ut and I will definitely let you hear it! Unless you find it before I do =P<br>  <br>  I don't see why people are still head over heels for Tarja! Anette is amazing and brings new challenges with her as she continues to become a part of Nightwish. I can't wait to see what to see what she does on their next album.<br>  <br>  And there is nothing that will bring Tarja back, your right! She is having a successful solo career and if she were to return to Nightwish they would actually lose Nightwish (post-Tarja) fans! Ridonculous I say! Not to mention that reuniting with Nightwish might not be the best career move :\<br>  <br>  Don't worry Vicky, you have my support in your Anette Love Campaign!|`|qLqYSeqRaa	I totally agree! I MUCH prefer Anette over Tarja! I always feel like the only one though. I honestly am not a huge fan of Tarja's voice, it's kind of.. awkward and not enjoyable.. haha I don't know, I just never loved it. I am so happy with Nightwish's change and I SUPPORT ANETTE OLZON!|`|oOSNI3wbaa	i like her. DPP was a great album. haters be damned. i'm anxiously awaiting the new nightwish album. i just hope it doesnt take another 3 years.|`|24e3c53ff3387eb84f27768983042d80aa	I have heard all those songs before and I only like the first three. I don't know why but I don't like Alyson Avenue at all. She sounds kind of different there, I like it better the way she sings now.<br>  <br>  I love Anette. I love how she sings and the way she portraits herself. She seems like a genuine, fun, loving person. And has such a pretty voice. I know that there are times when performing live she may not do very well but everyone has bad days. Then the haters put those videos on youtube to make fun of her, since they all have a brain of 12yr old or maybe younger.<br>  I think if the people that hate her with so much passion placed all of that energy on doing something good, the world would be a little better ;)<br>  <br>  I know it must have been hard for the people who have been fans before Anette joined but there is no reason for hating her. No one has to like her but not hate her as if she had done something bad to each of those individuals. Is not her fault Tarja was fired, and she joined because the guys liked her and thought she is competent enough to be their vocalist. Which she has proven to be imo.<br>  I have to admit that I don't like how she sings some of the old songs; "Whish I had an Angel", and "Slaying the Dreamer", but I love her version of "Higher than Hope", "Wishmaster",  "Sacrament Of Wilderness" (I like it 100x better with Anette), and "Sleeping Sun".<br>  I got into Nightwish when I heard "Amaranth". When I heard Tarja I didn't like her very much but she quickly grew on me and now I love both singers equally.<br>  <br>  <br>  These people need to grow up, like this girl in youtube whose user name is "Anti Antte Olzon". How sad is that?<br>  Fans don't need to follow the band blindly and agree with everything they say or do.So if they don't agree they need to stop listening to Anette, and just listen to their old song and Tarja's solo career. <br>  <br>  I really hate it when they say that Nightwish is dead, and that they became mainstream. I might be wrong but the way I see it is that they became mainstream the moment they became known, started selling albums, started touring the World and selling out concerts. And mainstream doesn't always mean bad. I see that as being selfish, not wanting the band you admire not be recognize for their talent and have great succes.<br>  <br>  In the end Nightwish is not dead, Anette is not a pop singer, and Tarja is not an Opera singer, she's a classical singer (said it herself).|`|dFacbjIZaa	I don't think I've ever heard a better "Tarja Fans need to get over it" rant ever Vicky. I is impressed, well said.<br>  <br>  You know Me, Dark Passion Play used to be My fave Nightwish album (Once took it over now tho) so even though I'm a huge fan of Tarja I obviously have zero probs with Anette's vocals.<br>  <br>  Nice job digging up Non-Nightwish Anette too.|`|ctWQFKwNaa	She's okay. Though, I prefer Tarja more. But I think that's because Tarja was classically trained. I am still getting used to Anette.|`|12QJ9QMRaa	So.....  I see you are stumping around on your "Anette Deserves Moar Respect" kick, eh?<br>  <br>  those are all the ones I know of.<br>  <br>  And I have actually been trying to find that Cloudscape track for a while, as I like Cloudscape ok, but wanted to know what song she was on.<br>  <br>  Awesome.<br>  <br>  As for the haters... well they are intolerent idiots.  The same people that expected MEtallica to appently not ever produce an albu again after Cliff died, etc.<br>  <br>  I love Tarja's voice, but I also really am likeing Anette more each time I hear her too.  She has a totally different voice and style from Tarja.<br>  So what?<br>  <br>  It works, and as their Wacken performance proved, she has taken quite a few of "Tarja's" songs and made them hers.<br>  <br>  BTW... I hate the phrase "Tarja's Songs" because they are Tuomas' songs, he wrot ethem not her.  Just as he wrote the new ones, the ones for Anette.  So really, if she is good enough for  him, I susuppect he may be a better judge than 99% of those who criticize (since you know..he IS a multi-published musician and all... and was apparently doing ok when Tarja was arond)<br>  <br>  Also.  while I do miss that there won't ever be them doing Phantom or Walking on the Air anymore... Tarja could not have sung Eva, eitherr, nor would she have been willing to take a backseat so readily to Marco on the Islander.<br>  <br>  Most importantly... she by her own words was considering leavig BEFORE they made Once, and definitely after..so she would have likely been gone ANYHOW.<br>  <br>  And even if Tuomas was a cruel black hearted beast that just wanted Tarja gone...how is that Anette's fault?  She didnt meet him til well after.<br>  <br>  So... for the critics.... get a life.

7e2774dbd0f5dfe71e63e178eb13001baa	I'm a touristy type. I like checking out the Strip at night, I like walking along it, going to the free exhibits, and even some of the pay ones. I like the Madam Tussaud's Wax Museum at the Venetian. I enjoyed the Titanic exhibit, it's not just for guys.<br>  I like seeing the animal exhibits, and the Mandalay Bay shark reef is almost a must.<br>  I also like going through the Venetian, Caesars Palace, and the Bellagio, which has the cool fountains, and the garden.<br>  There are some spots, both during the day and night, that are cool to look at from the walkways, or from up high.<br>  The Eiffel Tower at the Paris hotel is a cool spot to look down on the Bellagio Fountains.<br>  The M&M store is cool to look at.<br>  While expensive, the Cirque du Soleil show KA was very cool, and because of the economy, such shows are much lower in cost.<br>  It's also cool to just cruise down the Strip at night, looking at the hotels and the lights.<br>  Call me a geek, but I just like soaking up the night atmosphere. The Mirage volcano, the Bellagio fountains, checking out the Treasure Island pirate ship, etc. etc, are all up my alley.<br>  It's really too bad they changed the Aladdin hotel, I liked the Mediterranean vibe to it.|`|JLrs8bxdaa	Erm, go to school, hang with my friends, catch movies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Btw if you haven't figured it out yet i live here O.o<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you are a tourist, then I suggest the Adventuredome for family fun, and the Fashion Show Mall for a great time !<br>  And if you go to FSM, be sure to stick around for a Fashion show there !  That's what makes that mall famous !<br>  About every hour, the floor in the middle of the mall raises up into an elevated runway, it raises up to right about where the second floor is ! ! !<br>  <br>  Also the talking, moving, statue show.  I don't remember where that is though, maybe it was somewhere near the Alladin ?  Or maybe it was the Alladin, I don't remember.<br>  <br>  Also, Paris has a great buffet !<br>  And the Bellagio fountain show is a must see !<br>  Also go up in the Eiffel Tower and Stratosphere.<br>  <br>  If you are an adreheneline junky, go to the rides at NYNY and the roof of the Stratosphere, but I must warn you they are really expensive, and the NYNY roller coaster [although extrememly fun] jerks you around a lot !<br>  <br>  <br>  And the pirate show at TI used to be so cool, but now it's more of a strip show than a cool performance.<br>  D:<br>  And they recently re-did the volcano !<br>  <br>  I would also say Star Trek experience at The Hilton, but THEY TOOK IT OUT !<br>  I cried so bad, my dad is a Star Trek geek, and so I learned a lot about it.  The Borg one scared the hell out of me though O.o<br>  Especially the creepy spine chick D:<<br>  <br>  <br>  Cherry at Red Rock totally owns !<br>  But yah I've only *snuck in* there once, its 18+ or 21+, idr which D:<br>  PS<br>  If you are a tourist, Nevada is <br>  Ne-va-da<br>  Not Ne-vahhhhhhhhh-da<br>  <br>  We like bagging on the obvious tourists who say Nevahhhda|`|J0x3K1HTaa	Well I used to live there, and my favorite thing to do was to just drive around at night with my friends and enjoy all the lights, and make fun of tourists of course, I mean really just because your on vacation doesnt mean you should whip out the hawaian shirt and the fanny pack you look stupid people!|`|lEbOvYh7aa	Gondola down the canal at the Venetian being serenaded by someone that knows how to sing whilst everyone is watching from the sidelines and enjoying the peaceful scene.|`|WNfffzGiaa	You and me both.

15V3ic6Aaa	im against it. especially since my little brother really likes dora. but now that shes gonna be a "tween" he wont know anything about what the show is about. (with fashion and all that girl stuff) and my sister is also a tween and she said shes not gonna be watching dora so she doesnt get why their changing it.|`|RDsyZFsaaa	I am so against it. Dora's tween self is just showing girls not take responsibility for themselves. I heard along with the mini skirt, she has fish net stockings and platform shoes, but that it's a rumor, it can be true.<br>  Anyway, what I'm trying to say is. They are forcing kids to grow up, which isn't good. They're making her like a Bratz doll which is horrible. Obviously, these people want to make more money. Dolls like Barbie are good examples because there is a pilot barbie, doctor/nurse barbie, astronaut barbie, and so on.<br>  Why can't dora remain the same? Her old self is teaching girls that looks aren't everything and to worry more about responsibility and life.|`|f9dd67eaef69a933cf139fbcfcb257e8aa	Dora is cute the old way!
cIPziIdnaa	I love his music and before this incident at least - thought he was a pretty good kid.<br>  <br>  I will probably still listen to his music, but how much I "love" him from now on depends a lot on what we learn about that night.|`|1HLPznZhaa	He is your typical undereducated entertainer who can neither manage money or women.. So stuck on himself he actually thinks he is good..Maybe he will fall in love with his cell mate who will beat the h*** out of him twice a day..The guys an over rated jerk !|`|d3ZFgyoCaa	Nope, I'm really disappointed in him. I never expected him to do something as bad as that.|`|SvzsXddUaa	Oh well, I can't love him when I never did. :]|`|b637df4c5d99edf4bd75147b1fdb49d3aa	He's a modern day Ike Turner.|`|71wBNgbnaa	Absolutely not. I admit, "Run It" was pretty catchy (until it got horribly over-played), but he's not that great of an artist and his recent behavior makes me despise him even more.<br>  <br>  It's sad that he witnessed his father beat his mother, but that's absolutely no excuse for going and doing the same thing to his partner.|`|jGbNnpDXaa	hells no hun<br>  i used to think he was so cute & hiz songs wer da sh*t<br>  but after readin about what he did to rihanna i got so fckin disgusted<br>  how can u still look up to a guy after knowin he assualted someone like dat? esp. his GF.<br>  if my bf ever did dat to me id whop hiz as* back to where he came from<br>  <br>  i feel bad for rihanna.|`|EiQtzZHPaa	i think that there is nothing sexy about a woman beater! i think that he is a little coward who should be locked in a room with real men and beaten to a pulp,do you think that being hurt by someone you love is attractive? Rhianna is a weak stupid girl or she is mentally ill,either way sexapeal is a terrible reason to be with someone who obviously does not care about you! i seriously hope that sometime in your future you learn that!|`|31TUT9lpaa	if women stop going after SEX GODS!

Not into man-children anyway.<br>  <br>  Rhianna needs serious help in the mental health area so she can see he'll continue to abuse her. This was probably not the first time and it won't be the last if she stays with that sissy.

ndEmCRhxaa	once you put an (for example) B flat, every other B's in the bar become flat aswell. But it expires at the end of the mesure, so i f you want all the B's to be flat, you have to write in a flat for the first B of every bar. <br>  <br>  Or an easier way would be to just put (for example) B flat as your key signature at the beggining of the piece, then all the B's you don't want flat, just do a natural sign.

In college a drunk girl attacked me one night and I defended myself, and the police were called.  She was the one who was hurt (not seriously, but she was bleeding some) and the police thought I'd attacked her.  They detained me overnight.  I was released the next morning after they figured out what was wrong.  I let her sit in jail for a little while before dropping the charges.  <br>  <br>  I don't know if I'd say I was wrongfully arrested so much as I was detained while the police tried to sort out everything that happened though.|`|oB8TysC5aa	Yes 1968 Drunk and disorderly not had a drink all night, so I then hit 5 coppers, got fined ￡10-00 not bad 2quid a copper|`|lgtV6CVxaa	No!|`|tGGVeW3yaa	No|`|y3xCDNC0aa	Nope, cuz I'm an angel!|`|c1de8b0505a79fcad4bedc3b6eac4556aa	no|`|er7tDL53aa	no<br>  they got the right person|`|J2X3oaXTaa	i wasnt but my brother was,|`|eCszB0MYaa	I remember when I was living with five other guys.  Me and one other dude each had a bedroom in the basement.  I was getting ready for church on a Sunday.  I had just finished getting dressed.  I walked out of my room, closed the door, and all of a sudden, to my left and up the stairs, a cop was pointing a gun at me.<br>  <br>  "PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!!!  NOW!!!!  NOW!!!!!!!!!"<br>  <br>  [what the heck?]<br>  <br>  I went upstairs with my hands behind my head.  There, I saw two other roommates in the your-gonna-get-your-butt-arrested position.  Turns out that the house alarm had been going off for hours.  None of us had heard it and we had missed calls from the home security operator.  They had dispatched police and we were being treated like burgulars.<br>  <br>  So... the answer to your question?  No.  I've never been wrongfully arrested.  But that was close.  Especially since one of my roommates had pot in his room.  Dummy.|`|BM71UbSiaa	No, but my wife was.  Well, actually the police weren't really sure what was going on.  She was released the next morning though.  This was before we got married.<br>  <br>  I was locked up in juvy for a few days once, but that wasn't a wrongful arrest at all.

There was a clown on that show called Clarabelle who was pretty funny, and quiet as well. If you were seeing clowns on a regular basis, it wouldn't be scary at all. I also noticed in the third Harry Potter movie, the clown that bounces toward Harry Potter before it turns into a dementor has a definitely ominous stance, in spite of supposedly being a "ridiculous" object. So an entire generation of Harry Potter fans is probably going to associate clowns with something terrifying about to appear, whether they know it consciously or not.|`|RbsV1JvSaa	horror movies, pedophile association. these probably stem from the fact that u cant see the real person under the makeup and costume. my mom hates them and used to say that its bcuz u cant tell whether its a good person or a bad person underneath|`|9o7KlfvKaa	Phobias are irrational fears.

71wBNgbnaa	I promise it will be easier than you would ever expect. The clarinet and saxophone are, musically anyway, actually pretty similar. If you practice diligently, you'll have the saxophone down in no time. <br>  <br>  A big plus for switching from clarinet to saxophone, at the very least, is that you don't have to worry about your fingers covering the holes when you play. As long as you're pressing firmly enough on the keys, the keys do it for you. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped, and good luck! :)|`|52cc7aea6be5f841604eaa406ced87e2aa	It may be a little bit difficult at first because you would be using more breath and the reeds may be stronger. But I have no doubt that you could pick it up like nothing. If you can play instruments girl, then it will most likely be pretty easy for you. You'll catch on quick! Good luck! And no I don't see why you would have to learn alto or tenor first unless your teacher insists but I can't think of a good reason.|`|aqY13vWNaa	Yes, saxophone is easy, it's VERY similar to the clarinet, just practice, learn the trick fingerings (some hard fingerings for a b flat are hard, but there's a short cut to make playing that not easier.)<br>  You'll probably learn tenor first, I did.|`|J2X3oaXTaa	i dont think you have to learn tenor or alto first, im pretty sure you can just go straight to baritone sax.  Thats what my band teacher tried to get me to but i was just a flag twirler.  go for it!|`|iwJHxoezaa	noooooooo!!!<br>  stick woth clarinet lol|`|PgtGNsPWaa	i think it will be fairlly easy since they are alike<br>  but it WILL take work<br>  <br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307151017AAoUCsa&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|lvfdctciaa	Well i play alto and if i were you get a book and learn it first then learn the other!!!

lO2Nvj81aa	Here's what I know:<br>  <br>  Back in early February (the 6th) Jon was at a bar in Huntingdon, PA, where his mother is currently living.  After a short time a the bar, Jon went to a college party hosted by a Juniata College senior.  He spent an hour and a half at the party then went back to the bar.  There are pictures of Jon at the party and at the bar with fans.<br>  <br>  On another occasion, rumored to be Valentine's Day, Jon went to another bar and there are pictures of him with fans from this night as well.  In total, there are five pictures of Jon with girls circulating the internet.  He is completely hammered in at least two of the pictures and looks pink-cheeked in a couple of the others.  In the last photo, taken from the Juniata College paper, he is holding a beer pong and posing with the party hostess.<br>  <br>  Rumors abound that Jon was seen making out with girls and dancing with them inappropriately.  Do I believe THESE rumors?  No.  Do I believe Jon was out partying with college girls.  Yes.  Do I think that is right?  No.  He is 32, or nearly 32 years old.  He is married and he has eight children.  He does not belong partying with college girls.  Does that mean he is guilty of cheating?  No.  <br>  <br>  When analyzing the information that is available on the situation, you have to use your own judgement.  Ya know?  There's is usually some truth to any rumor and in this case the truth is that Jon has been hitting the bars as of late.|`|Oe2c1ZGIaa	I heard about this last night and at first I didn't believe it.  He doesn't seem like the type of guy to do that and especially with so many kids involved but i did some research and found some info on it and now i'm starting to think its true.  Here's some articles talking about it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/idolchatter/2009/03/jon-gosselin-of-jon-kate-plus.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.beliefnet.com/idolchatter/20...</a><br>  <br>  and a picture of him at a bar with 2 girls:<br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/32331857.html" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/ohnothe...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2009/03/jon-kate-plus-8-heading-for-divorce.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/...</a>|`|lN0GkKgaaa	I doubt he was cheating on Kate. He was at a party, who cares. Can adults with children not let loose once in a blue moon?!<br>  <br>  I don't see what the big deal is. It's obviously not a big deal if TLC hasn't come out and said something about it.|`|KNBccSitaa	All I know is that I pray to God that this is not true. These rumors are really upsettings me right now. And as I just said, I really, really hope that they are not true! I will be absolutely heartbroken if they are true...|`|UOmhBNxKaa	if someone wants to cheat, they'll find a way to do it.  i'm not saying he's cheating or out skirting around.  but just because he has 8 kids doesn't mean he's always home or a saint.|`|ohkcktm5aa	no jon is much better than that:). he would never...not with 8 kids!! haha i love the show. xD|`|ujomB7iHaa	it's just a rumor-can anyone actually prove that he was doing this stuff. it's just for publicity. jon doesn't seem like the type of person who would do something like this.

I've grown up listening to my dad playing ALL their C'DS. And I'm only 14 !|`|OEATSehSaa	They are both so great,i cant decide|`|EchBsT2Oaa	I never evewn understood the debate about it. It's like comparing who's better out of The Spice Girls or Matchbox 20. It's just not right. Lol.<br>  <br>  The Stones are more rock, while the Beatles are sort of pop/acid drugged influenced. Anyone who's seen Yellow Submarine, can understand the complete difference. Lol.<br>  <br>  I'm more of a Beatles fan, but I do love me some Stones as well. To me, they're just two completely different genres that happened to be around the same era and pull along with the times.|`|SqAsjK0Qaa	They're just different types of bands. Rolling Stones was more "bad", they were more rooted in the blues where The Beatles were more pop and psychedelic. I personally prefer The Beatles usually but that doesn't mean I don't like the Stones.|`|W9DnNNjOaa	The Beatles!!!!!!!! all the way<br>  have better songs|`|nqLGVMicaa	Both, but in a different way. Like comparing a brunette to a blonde ;o)|`|clDDi5nJaa	its hard for me to choose...<br>  the beatles were my first love and i totally went crazy obsessed over them for a little while and i still think they are one of the best bands ever :D<3<br>  BUT, then again i do prefer some Stones songs over the beatles.<br>  and, say, if right now i was given the choice to listen to either a beatles or a stones song, i would probably pick the rolling stones. just based on my current mood.<br>  so yeah, i cant really choose, and i dont like to choose, but as of right now, i say Stones :D<br>  <br>  [lmfao did any of that even make any sense?]|`|wOc4Dqllaa	The Beatles. The Stones were great and talented and all, but the Beatles reinvented popular music. No amount of badassness or grittyness can top that.|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	The Rolling Stones are the better of the two bands. I don't dislike The Beatles, I just don't like them. My feelings about The Beatles are mixed.

P8gGMlbIaa	You're probably going to go to a specialty store if you want Gundam models. After Bandai botched the marketing of Gundam there hasn't been a Gundam model in any major store chain for years. So hobby and comic stores have been one source. Anime stores are the best source for Gundam models however. <br>  <br>  You are probably looking for a Chinese store.<br>  Watch out though some or the items they sell might be bootleg and of poor quality.<br>  If you can find it there I'd recommend here for Gundam models.<br>  <a href="http://www.gundamstoreandmore.com/gundam.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gundamstoreandmore.com/gundam...</a>|`|51WmRqPaaa	Have you tried Flushing Mall?

MEzanrqQaa	Although Sagittarius doesn't mind their other leading, they are very independent, and Scorpios like to, maybe need to, control. Sagittarius might feel very smothered, unless Scorpio can tone this down.<br>  <br>  This is the main problem between these two i think.<br>  <br>  Obviously Venus is very important, as well as Moon, Rising, etc.<br>  <br>  The main good thing is: Sagittarius doesn't mind Scorpio running the show:.D (Just don't overwhelm the Sag)<br>  <br>  All else is more intricate, and you'll need a more specific question:.D|`|6yD5k9Azaa	no!<br>  not from my experince|`|AA11417199	not really, Scorpios have to learn how to understand Sagittarius actions or else they'll end up hating them for no reason.

S2tBYhCKaa	I reside in one of two states where voters have legalized suicide for<br>  residence adjudged by two physicians as having less than six months to live.  Applicants must make request in writing, wait fifteen days,<br>  and then make a second request in writing.  Physicians and hospitals<br>  are on public record today to assist or deny medical assistance.  If<br>  the request process is honored by attending physician a lethal drug<br>  prescription will be issued the terminal ill.  The prescription must be<br>  taken in-hand by terminal ill for legal suicide to occur.  Most of the<br>  prescribed choose to die at home.  In my case the law became legal<br>  this week and I voted for it.  The worst way to die is not having legal choice to decide upon your own death.|`|G9FiXGvmaa	I used to think getting licked by a thousand kittens was bad, but I think having every inch your body duct taped and then the taped ripped off could be very brutal.

This is because answering that question implies answering a broader question: “What is to be rich”, but we can always try.<br>  <br>  Whenever referring to the US economy, you will hear that it is the biggest economy in the world. That claim rests on the fact that the US has the largest GDP in the world.

Love is always free.<br>  Definitions of love on the Web:<br>  a strong positive emotion of regard and affection; "his love for his work"; "children need a lot of love"<br>  any object of warm affection or devotion; "the theater was her first love"; "he has a passion for **** fighting";<br>  have a great affection or liking for; "I love French food"; "She loves her boss and works hard for him"<br>  beloved: a beloved person; used as terms of endearment<br>  get pleasure from; "I love cooking"<br>  One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life: That word is love." - Sophocles<br>  "Love is like quicksilver in the hand. Leave the fingers open and it stays. Clutch it, and it darts away." - Dorothy Parker<br>  <br>  To some Love is friendship set on fire for others Maybe love is like luck. You have to go all the way to find it. No matter how you define it or feel it, love is the eternal truth in the history of mankind.  <br>  Love is patient, love is kind. It has no envy, nor it boasts itself and it is never proud. It rejoices over the evil and is the truth seeker. Love protects; preserves and hopes for the positive aspect of life. Always stand steadfast in love, not fall into it. It is like the dream of your matter of affection coming true.   Love can occur between two or more individuals. It bonds them and connects them in a unified link of trust, intimacy and interdependence. It enhances the relationship and comforts the soul. Love should be experienced and not just felt. The depth of love can not be measured. Look at the relationship between a mother and a child. The mother loves the child unconditionally and it can not be measured at all.   A different dimension can be attained between any relationships with the magic of love. Love can be created. You just need to focus on the goodness of the other person. If this can be done easily, then you can also love easily. And remember we all have some positive aspect in us, no matter how bad our deeds maybe. And as God said ?Love all? <br>  Depending on context, love can be of different varieties. Romantic love is a deep, intense and unending. It shared on a very intimate and interpersonal and sexual relationship.  The term Platonic love, familial love and religious love are also matter of great affection. It is more of desire, preference and feelings. The meaning of love will change with each different relationship and depends more on its concept of depth, versatility, and complexity. But at times the very existence of love is questioned. Some say it is false and meaningless. It says that it never exist, because there has been many instances of hatred and brutality in relationships. The history of our world has witnessed many such events. There has been hatred between brothers, parents and children, sibling rivalry and spouses have failed each other. Friends have betrayed each other; the son has killed his parents for the throne, the count is endless. Even the modern generation is also facing with such dilemmas everyday. But ?love? is not responsible for that. It is us, the people, who have forgotten the meaning of love and have undertaken such gruesome apathy.<br>  In the past the study of philosophy and religion has done many speculations on the phenomenon of love. But love has always ruled, in music, poetry, paintings, sculptor and literature. Psychology has also done lot of dissection to the essence of love, just like what biology, anthropology and neuroscience has also done to it. <br>  Psychology portrays love as a cognitive phenomenon with a social cause. It is said to have three components in the book of psychology: Intimacy, Commitment, and Passion. Also, in an ancient proverb love is defined as a high form of tolerance. And this view has been accepted and advocated by both philosophers and scholars.   Love also includes compatibility. But it is more of journey to the unknown when the concept of compatibility comes into picture. Maybe the person whom we see in front of us, may be least compatible than the person who is miles away. We might talk to each other and portray that we love each other, but practically we do not end up into any relationship. Also in compatibility, the key is to think about the long term successful relationship, not a short journey. We need to understand each other and must always remember that no body is perfect. <br>  Be together, share your joy and sorrow, understand each other, provide space to each other, but always be there for each others need. And surely love will blossom to strengthen your relationship with your matter of affection.

It can be rather intense at times, however, well worth it, in my opinion.|`|PGeAFKYZaa	As you know, birds of a feather flock together!|`|e4h5yVXgaa	not that i am sending an innuendo to the other poster, but i truly believe in the mirroring effect. if you dont like other ppl of your sign, it's bc you see yourself in them and basically it's not them, you just dont like yourself. i once dated this scorpio guy and he exhibited traits that i couldnt stand!! he would say sth and i would snap! i would get irritated by him. haha, then i realized that my friends and roomates didnt like the samethings that he did in me!! i was really like him... weird, i hope you followed that. this other scorpio called me out one time (though i wasnt lying), and he refused to believe me. it took me like seven yrs to forgive him. i do that all the time, i accuse someone of sth and refuse to hear what i think are just more lies...<br>  <br>  my brother's a scorpio too. we are v close. ive known a lot of scorpio boys and i always end up chasing them or getting involved or they chase me. it's usually an infacuation where the conversation goes to marriage and obsession w one another. i am currently waiting for this scorpio guy to e-mail me back. we just started seeing ea other, but i took a day to respond to his e-mail and i was like dam! bc not only are we intimate, but he hasnt established trust w me, so he probably thinks i am playing games w him. yesterday i was reading all these letters this scorpio guy who liked me wrote- trying to convince me to be his. you know, out of all the celebrities out there, I only like the scorpio ones. there is NO celebrities born under any other sun sign that i am attracted to. take a look at this list:<br>  leonardo dicaprio<br>  ryan gosling<br>  matthew mcconaughey<br>  seth macfarlane<br>  joaquin phoenix<br>  scott weiland<br>  frank iero<br>  ben foster<br>  davey havok<br>  that's a hot list!!<br>  but dont get me wrong in real life i enjoy all signs. the guy who i liked the most wasnt a scorpio.<br>  so yeah that's my part|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	I have strong connections with alot of scorpios aswell.<br>  I think scorpios understand eachother so well, and both of them being so intense and loving inside........it's crazy. Two scorpios will bump heads now and than....but hey that's normal =]|`|94zi1LFFaa	what is your ascendant? your moon sign? & what sign is your 5th house in? your 7th, your 9th? & your juno? Also, what signs are your venus & mars in?<br>  <br>  Generally water signs go really well together if not the best in the zodiac but when of the same sign there usually are other factors influencing... <br>  <br>  ~Peace
f9soMMuiaa	I never liked him on SNL or any of his movies. I always thought he was one of the worse cast. As for his late night, he's horrible. But honestly, I thought he actually did improved a little starting on the third night. He seems more comfortable and natural in his interviews. Monologues, I noticed he was a little less awkward delivering them. But that will take years to improve a great deal. <br>  <br>  And no he is not the cancer to nbc. You can't be a cancer to a tv network when no one is actually awake to see how horrible you are. So now we have 2 Carson Dalys on nbc.

Cb9O7ycPaa	because she acts like a slut.|`|c4ffad35613c491307cfe58a126f710daa	I Do Beacuse She Doing Asshole ****   She Wait When Gets Older Do That Stuff|`|MDYWlYw0aa	because she cant sing or act and she only got famous bcuz of her dad and she needs 2 go back 2 the trailer park where she came from!|`|PBI3tCKaaa	She has no talent.  She is purging off her fathers one hit wonderness.|`|i0pBS82Kaa	I don't hate her, nor am I a fan of her.<br>  I could really care less..|`|3wyFurPEaa	i don't hate her i love her shes awesome|`|JLrs8bxdaa	I really don't care that she is a slut.<br>  <br>  It's just the whole poser thing, I mean she is slutty, yet goes out and pretends to be a goody-two-shoes.  She is a slut.  She needs to admit it and dump the lil miss perfect act, because it isn't fooling anyone.<br>  <br>  Stupid ******.<br>  <br>  <br>  PLUS<br>  She doesn't have much talent.  I mean sure it's mediocre, but so many people out there are more talented !<br>  She only got the roll cuzza her dad.  She was up against Brittany Underwood !<br>  Brittany freakin Underwood !  Brittany has at least twice the talent as the stupid hick !<br>  <br>  Disney is also so prejeduced to her.  They are freaking Miley lovers.<br>  For example, they let her go on in 7 Things saying things like "When we kiss I'm hypnotized" and "When we're intertwined everything is fine"<br>  Yet they don't even let Demi say something as simple as "Kiss me like you mean it"<br>  What, do they want boyfriends to fake love, and not kiss a girlfriend like they mean it ?<br>  Not kissing someone like you mean it is much worse that "like you mean it" in my eye, because if you mean it then you really love the person.  "Kiss me like you mean it" is bottom line way less suggestive than "When we're intertwined everything is fine"<br>  Intertwined in what ? ! <br>  Getting ready to have sex with your BF, Miley ?<br>  So what, just use a condom and DONT BE A POSER !<br>  YOU ARE NOT A LIL' MISS PERFECT, MILEY !<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT :<br>  Person below me, yes she makes mistakes, but reoccuring ones of her sluttyness ?<br>  She is slutty and needs to admit it, not be a poser.<br>  And I am NOT a lil tweeny bopper, I am turning 15 real soon for your info.<br>  <br>  EDIT AGAIN :<br>  Lol the person below me deleted her answer after I said that ^^^^<br>  <br>  <br>  xDDDDDDDDDDD|`|Jg0ECvyVaa	Hy,<br>  Firstly she is not a great rolemodel for little kids.<br>  1. What, do you want little kids to be taking half-naked pictures of themselves? <br>  1.To go around in cars without buckling up? <br>  2To be making out with other people when they're in 2nd grade?<br>  <br>  <br>   Did you hear her on the New Year's Eve celebration two  years ago? She wasn't singing, she was screaming. She was so loud, you couldn't even hear the Jonas Brothers singing with her (even Nick, and you can always hear his strong voice).<br>  hope i helped:)|`|bkjJ4emjaa	i agree with shanice d<br>  <br>  shes just a teenager, everyone does stupid stuff at her age<br>  give her a break<br>  <br>  and its only 12 year old teeny boppers who hate her for no reason<br>  <br>  i dont like her but i wouldnt have a hate campaign against her just cos i needed someone new to hate now hilary duffs all grown up!!!!!!|`|8H97U1qDaa	because kids look up to her and she is a whoere and skannk and hoe(:<br>  and because she forgets!to thank her fans and if it wasnt for her fans she wouldnt even be famous.<br>  And she tried to start shiet with selena and demi..and<br>  she is goin out with men?<br>  and taking disgudting ppictures.!|`|1fE0kJw9aa	no the question is y not?? The reason for me is cuz she cant sing all that well and she is a horrible role model!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|V1uWwwF7aa	I don't hate her but I am not a fan either|`|UGoYF6OFaa	i dont no I really like her though!|`|lhrMI9f5aa	coz shes a fugly slutt|`|OiPG4aYHaa	I don't hate her. But other people do cause...<br>  1. Their jealous<br>  2. They just want someone to pick on<br>  3. I have to admit, she has taken bad photos (but she hasn't in a while...so I'm really proud of her for that)<br>  4. Their just immature jerks who need to get a life<br>  5. They hate Hannah Montana, so they think that since Hannah Montana is little girly and stupid, Miley is to (even though she's really not).<br>  <br>  So, out of these 5 options, only 1 of them is really a reasonable reason to hate her. agreed?|`|hoGpOrOUaa	I want to know that too!<br>  So what if she took some pictures?<br>  She's a teenage girl!<br>  She'll make mistakes!<br>  <br>  I can guarentee that every 15-16 year old has taken "risky" photos<br>  of themselves or with friends. <br>  Its just teenagers today.<br>  <br>  People are forgetting that before she is a "role model" or a "celebrity" <br>  she's a human! <br>  And any way, it doesn't effect her that much. I doubt that she cares about the pathetic people who waste their time blasting her at every chance they get, sat in front of their computer screens looking for places to insult her. <br>  That girl could retire now if she wanted too, even with all the haters!|`|n8Aycz6Gaa	Latley because Selena and Miley hate each other, And Selena is the new popstar, and she's becoming big. Especially now because her new cd is coming out over the summer.|`|WRBCLQy4aa	I Dont Hate Her...<br>  I Rekon She The Awsomest Actor Ever!!!!<br>  =)<br>  <br>  Go Miley =)|`|5vRU2dWkaa	Cause she is millions of little kids looked up to her and then she put up a pic of her in ONLY a sheet!|`|un7HgV2Vaa	miley is soooooo retarted. her voice sucks, and she acts all that. she probably is a huge snob. her songs suck too.|`|2RzCfC1Qaa	BECAUSE SHES A WHORE

My mom always sits in the left chair of the table facing the windows across from my sister. My dad always sits in the back chair across from me on my opposite side facing forward across from me and forward to the table. My sister always sits in the right chair of the table facing across from my mom.|`|tWePoJYNaa	No. We actually move around. I think it's because we don't always eat at the table.

He has always told/tells everyone where to sit no matter if it's at home or a restaurant.  I hate it, but for some reason it slightly irritates him if my sister and I don't sit in our usual seats.  I've never understood his reasons for assigning seats either.|`|ftnMEAv6aa	Well, to make things easier, my parents already assign a chair to each of us but since then, at my friends houses, I sit in the same chair at THEIR table, haha, I don't know why though.|`|2OIssqW1aa	no, i just sit wherever i want or sometimes i just sit on the sofa!|`|RTHWQvkzaa	my mom and dad always always always sit in these exact seats and never sit anywhere else.

ENkFZhlraa	I think it's one of the least offensive comedies.<br>  <br>  But people always find something to be offended by. I can't think of anything really off the top of my head but yeah, there's probably something. Nothing said in the boosh is really meant to be taken too seriously.<br>  <br>  ?|`|DBRasxxKaa	It's all just good fun, you'd have to be very sensitive to take offence. A lot of comedy is based on mocking people, it doesn't do any serious harm as long as it is humour, there's nothing wrong with it, it's not something to be taken seriously!<br>  <br>  I suppose anybody who tried could be offended by it, they take on most of those stereotyped groups. Nobody should be but anyone could be if they took it the wrong way. I know this may not be exactly what you're looking for but I'm not going through the entire three series, it's very obvious who could be.|`|EtxxkvWeaa	I don't get offended by it at all.<br>  All jokes are made in jest and it is not their intention to offend. I think if you want to watch a comedy show such as the mighty boosh you have to turn off the part of your brain that might get offended and just relax!<br>  <br>  Ps - CRACK FOX RULES!|`|FpqYrDoLaa	It doesn't offend me at all.

3ERx4opSaa	pein has the very rare bloodline trait called the Rinnengan, the power that your eyes become swirls in them, and you can control up to six other bodies as if they were your own. However, these are not liek shadow clones since they each give a differnt view of vision, much stronger and act like a real ninja opponent, meaning the body wont die unless it has been fatally wounded. The controller of the bodys can also stay much farther away then the distance a perosn controlling a shadow clone could stand. Each of his bodies has differnt abillities such as summoning animals, absorbing chakra, paralyzing enemies. The body he controls when he meets other aktsuki members is called Deva Path, and is his childhood friends body Yahiko. this body has spikey blond hair and a set of repulsion techniques. These include shinra tensei, a powerful jutsu that repels anything but can only be used every 5 seconds, another one i dont know the name of that levitates objects and brings them near you, and Chibuka Tensei, which pain hasnt yet used but is about to use in the next manga chapter.<br>  <br>  Tobi, or Uchiha Madara's techniques havent been revealed yet, but we know he can travel at the speed of light and can teleport out of any situation or trap (like shino's bugs). he is obviously very powerful, since he is the founder of the uchiha clan and possesses the eternal mangekyou sharingan.|`|aZtPJSLFaa	they both can do something really strong|`|u3D8MAGOaa	Pein - Rinnegan and also summoning, technique absorption, shinra tensie, can take your soul out of your body....and the rest i forgot =P<br>  <br>  Tobi - Eternal Sharingan, not much else is known

It was interesting at the time, but after so many seasons, I think I lost interest. Hopefully you'll like TTGL!<br>  <br>  [[edit]]<br>  Btw, TTGL is one of the ONLY mecha-series that I like.

Bdgza4G2aa	Try "NANA". It is about best friends emerging from high school, but is still shoujo. It is really great! I highly, highly recommend it. You should also try "Venus in Love". Once again, it is best friends going to college, but still has what you are looking for, and shoujo/comedy. "AzuManga Daioh" is another one. it actually is in high school! Really hilarious, too.<br>  I hope you like them!<br>  List:<br>  ~NANA<br>  ~Venus in Love<br>  ~AzuManga Daioh

hXqMSbZ3aa	You must be talking about the 2002 documentary movie "Daughter from Danang."  However, the girl is not Filipino but Vietnamese.<br>  <br>  In 1975, as the Vietnam War was ending, thousands of orphans and Amerasian children were brought to the United States as part of "Operation Babylift." Daughter from Danang tells the dramatic story of one of these children, Heidi Bub (a.k.a. Mai Thi Hiep), and her Vietnamese mother, Mai Thi Kim, separated at the war's end and reunited 22 years later. Heidi, now living in Tennessee - a married woman with kids - had always dreamt of a joyful reunion. When she ventures to Vietnam to meet her mother, she unknowingly embarks on an emotional pilgrimage that spans decades and distance. Unlike most reunion stories that climax with a cliché happy ending, Daughter from Danang is a real-life drama. Journeying from the Vietnam War to Pulaski, Tennessee and back to Vietnam, Daughter from Danang tensely unfolds as cultural differences and the years of separation take their toll in a riveting film about longing and the personal legacy of war.<br>  <br>  On the last day of Heidi's visit, Heidi's half brother Tinh asked Heidi if she would share some of the responsibility of caring for their mother. He asked if she could take Kim to the United States to live near her, or at least send a monthly stipend. Overwhelmed with anger by the request, Heidi answered that she could not.
qWIha03Iaa	I actually don't really like any of them lol.. But I do love dance music (perhaps just not remixes). If I had to choose, however, I would say Halo is the best of them and Beautiful isn't too to bad either. They are all best with their original music I think. <br>  :)

7b827843d6cbfc5540f19b9274904d1baa	I would run into my house, grab my 12 guage, 223. cal rifle, and my colt revolver and throw on my ammo belt, body armor (I have it from being a cop), get in my squad car, and drive around looking for survivors. if they are bitten, I will shoot them in the head. If not, I will check to see if they are smart enough to wield a gun. After I have few companions, Id drive into Milwakee(I live in wisconsin, 2 hours away from Milwakee), and go into the mall. Id hit the food court, grabbing whatever I can find thats edible and can store for a while. After that, Id hit up the gun shop(Gotta have ammo and more weapons for the other people)and stock as much as possible. Once im all outfitted, Id make my way to the security room, and Id weld the door shut. We could use the video cameras to see where everything is, and plus have the maps, keys, equipment, etc thats in there. We would use the ventilation shaft as a way of getting around, and slowly kill the zombies off and saving ammo by using melee weapons to kill the zombies. Eventually, the military would make there way in, killing everything. Hook, line, and sinker....|`|BIVrU7Cjaa	don't know. don't care|`|AA10421948	Start looking for a shot gun and a lot of ammo for it!|`|AA10711434	My plan would be to make sure I have a car that has inside access to the trunk so that way I can fill the trunk with weapons and don't have to go outside the car to retrieve them. Then I would find a Super Walmart and barricade myself in there until help, if any, arrives. Super Walmarts are better than malls because you can buy groceries and guns at the same time. You can also park your car in the auto center without having to fight your way to it in the parking lot. They are good too because there would not be that many places you would have to board up.

bIouq64Oaa	Yes... I'm incredibly good at convincing people that things are real when they're not. I have this friend, Liana, and I bought her a snack once. She told me she'd pay me back, but I don't like my friends to pay me back money.<br>  <br>   The next day, she was hungry again, so I bought her another snack. She's like, "Okay, now I owe you four dollars." And I was like, "No, you don't. I bought you a snack yesterday, and I bought you one today. They cancel each other out, so you don't owe my anything."  She was like, "No, it doesn't work like that..." But all my friends know me as sort of a math nerd, so she believed me. She still hasn't paid me back! :D|`|mggll8dRaa	If it is needed....!!|`|pV6K2mm5aa	In my world..yes|`|ntef2sPMaa	i am. i'm a gemini. of course i am.|`|ztzL7ntwaa	probably~~|`|pHteEAF8aa	no...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  here, have a fried pork skin....|`|mwv79AIhaa	no, id rather just tell it like it is....wether its what u wanna hear or not.

6beL9zycaa	Pix-ed you (should) already know 2 things about me:  <br>  1.  I'm not "average" <br>  2.  I can't watch TV until I find another job (pouting)<br>  <br>  BUT having said that, I tend to watch whatever programming is on 5 or 6 different networks:  TLC, Bravo, HGTV, Animal Planet, Discovery, & Comedy Central. Oh, & Adult Swim (adult cartoons~ some of them are wickedly funny!)  A few of my faves are as follows:<br>  (In no particular order)<br>  <br>  RENO 911 <br>  Tim Gunn's show (he has a "style" show on Bravo, & I love him)<br>  The Office~  I've only seen the original British version on BBC <br>  Family Guy<br>  What Not To Wear<br>  My Life on the"D-List" with Kathy Griffith<br>  Jon Stewart's "News" show on Comedy Central<br>  <br>  There are lots more, I just can't think of any others right now.<br>  Let's hear some of YOUR faves?!|`|80II1Wv1aa	My TV is ON about 150 hours a month, but I'm only watching about 60 (around 2 hours a day - prime time). <br>  My 10 fave shows are<br>  Heroes<br>  House<br>  Damages<br>  Leverage<br>  The Office<br>  30 Rock<br>  Big Love<br>  True Blood<br>  Flight of the Conchords<br>  Saturday Night Live|`|pB7TGYNzaa	No, far from it.

But we watch My name is Earl , House ......and a few other on dvd when the season comes out. oxo|`|8DsbSALzaa	use to watch like 24000000 hrs but not now|`|UBxKqdPwaa	I have chosen not to have a TV so I watch none at all!|`|YcGNL9y1aa	That's just over 37 hours a week or around 5 hours per day.  I usually have the TV on in the background but I am not necessarily watching it.  My TV is on for more than 5 hours a day though.<br>  <br>  I like the police type programs and some of the soaps.  I also like some of the older type programs like Prisoner Cell Block H and Bad Girls.  I like the Gilmore Girls too.|`|grifjdr0aa	NOPE.  I watch about 4.<br>  <br>  Sober House|`|6Uohf1h1aa	i probably watch 2 hrs a day but spend 300 hrs on yahoo lol|`|eiEdUWNbaa	That's 5 hours a day! I certainly hope not. I do like The Office and 30 Rock, though.
afZdehfzaa	to be truthful, i don't think it i because it way to much for the little kids to talk. plus its way too much violence than naruto. naruto shippudden is like so complicated. if u have a manga, u can scan it an put it on photobucket.com then transfer it on myspace for people to comment on and read.|`|eYjSzf7Yaa	Naruto shippuden will probably come on cartoon network when they're done with naruto<br>  but when they're done with naruto it'll take a long time until naruto shippuden will come out|`|oKckkzz9aa	Naruto fans need to chill. For the 5th focking time ITS GONNA BE DUBBED!! Its too ****** popular to not be. I mean this is the first manga that has attempted to progress up to the latest japanese version in AMERICA! So believe me it will come. And I'm sure CN is smart enough to not let go of any rights to naruto.

gTmbLqGJaa	Yeah, it kinda takes away from the title. the title of your CD is supposed to be what you stick by, and if you cut the only song from the CD with the same likeness, you kinda lose the whole meaning of the title. some metal bands don't even release a song with the name on it. Heavy Heavy Low Low for example, just makes up ludicrous song titles and no one knows what they mean, and they usually don't have anything to do with the song. Example: On the CD, **** It?!?, They put a song on there called "Tragic Tragic Track Jacket"... yeah.|`|wur5gwK8aa	Nope, I've actually never seen that happen, but that's strange. <br>  Haha, yeah your question really belongs in Dental or Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered.

zZ3Uxllfaa	she was very good   i.m sure she used to be a dancer  anyway fair play to  her
Fp0rnPs8aa	She has had about 3 surgeries on her face, lips and cheeks.<br>  She is so starving for attention it makes me sick.  She sits<br>  on NBC and smiles the whole time when she does not have<br>  any money, food or beds for those babies and the other six<br>  she just gave birth to last month.  She is a complete nut!|`|6c519adeb7e7fde2ea538370b524d613aa	Narcissistic personality disorder Is more like what she has.<br>  Now, that she has been exposed everybody is saying we have to concentrate on finding ways to help her.<br>  My answer is over my dead body would I help that freak of nature.<br>  Let her crazy mother help her out with the bunch. Her father, that went to Oprah probably looking for sympathy, help her out.|`|MeGehliuaa	I agree, I think she did get her lips done. But how is that even relevant to the 14 kids? It seems you like focusing on the negative things. It's hard for me to get why others like pointing out faults of others. She may not be a mature woman, but for god's sake, what do her lips have to do with it?!|`|AA10690200	she is definitely delusional and is dangerous to society,...spec. her kids... she used school loans and food stamps to feed her kids and she thinks that's normal!!!  she probably used the school loans for her surgery!|`|cacfXRDjaa	I despise her. I think that she's seriously delusional. I mean, 6 kids are enough, so why have more? She can't even support them! She'll waste the tax money that we're giving her on plastic surgery to keep on messing up her ugly face.
8ryoShBpaa	I recovered my 5 kids from autism.  One I adopted.  I think I emailed them and offerred to share how, but I got no response back.  Anyone can learn how by going to Yahoo Groups on autism, www.generationrescue.org , www.liafoundation.org , or autismresearchinstitute.com  or TACA or other places.  Some websites out there just say the same old boring, mainstream stuff about there being no hope and there is not much you can do.  Good thing I beleived the websites that say you can rid autism by ridding pathogens and toxins.  Now my children can talk and go to regular school with no modifications.  Having children with autism is extremely stressful.  I recommend recovering them, and rid that stress.
ztzL7ntwaa	nope you sure don't because it has happened to me too~~<br>  <br>  y/a's philosophy? they don't make mistakes~~~between you and me---shhhh, they think they are perfect...don't tell anyone~|`|hQni89Ytaa	yes
foGvzgLJaa	Well , In parents defense...I have a 3 year old that is out of control, have tried spanking, time out, corners, no TV, in bed early....NOTHING is working....we now just dont go out to eat!|`|dFHsAXDMaa	Ha ha great question.. I waitress during college and my sister and brother in law owed two restaurants and I absolutely agree ....<br>  <br>  Screaming kids that is why they invented BABYSITTERS<br>  <br>  I am now married with 4 kids who are now 17, 15, 14 and 11 and since birth they could all go to a restaurant and they would sit there and behave. It is Absolutely the parents fault when their children do not behave. children need to be taught appropriate behavior and these parents are not teaching them ...<br>  <br>  Go ahead take that parent to the bathroom ..... when I manage the local restaurant I have nicely asked parent to take child to take out area or car until they calmed down as it is bothering other diners.|`|DKEOJ0h6aa	This is the most annoying thing you have mentioned!!<br>  This definitely spoils the way you planned an outing and brings back bad memories whenever you see parents with their kids the next time you step in a restaurant.  <br>  =[<br>  My solution:Choose a restaurant that DOESN'T ALLOW such kind of crap<br>  <br>  !!!|`|DvjX2DFKaa	No, I didn't take the father into the restroom, the carpark gives you more room to manouvre and if they call the police, more room to disappear.|`|f0173000dda40d230a0442e8832073d1aa	Agreed.<br>  <br>  I have kids and they were taught early on that bad behavior meant we were leaving.  Never was a problem.  <br>  <br>  Many of today's parents were yesterdays brats...so it's easy to see how the cycle repeats and to predict the future...shudders.|`|aAj4dSyuaa	I have to agree with you, that is really annoying. But, is it the most annoying thing? No. I happen to find disney channel stars to be more annoying.|`|d6c86f7baca11ad3525ca1a7ee0ecd06aa	yep that's annoying but it happens....|`|twy8S0L2aa	yeh, when its a grown man/woman doing that|`|cgXOR6LKaa	I work in a restraunt. I'm around screaming babies for 6 hours a day, 5 days a week. And not only do their parents let them scream but they let them make a huge mess. I understand it's my job to clean the table and area around it but when it's baby food and not even from my restraunt, I think I have the right to be a little mad. But the screaming babies aren't that bad. When you get plowed into by a three year old while carrying four salads, because their parents aren't watching them so they're running wild, that's annoying. Or 13 year old girls who scream and giggle loud enough to hear him across the room. I'm sorry, I could go on for hours about how annoying people are in restraunts.|`|MFjbr8t4aa	Parents who don't give a crap about what their children do to control them in such manner. Such a shame. I've seen many other parents just laugh at their child because they thinks its cute or what not. Children are cute and funny, but when they act out of control when someone is trying to eat at a resturant is another story.|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	"Sorry, but there's not much they can do. It's not their fault..."<br>  <br>  Give me a break!  NOBODY wants to accept responsibility for their actions anymore. So, who's job is it to keep control of their own kids?<br>  <br>  YES, it gets loathsome, sometimes.  I know kids have times of outbursts, but come on....|`|Oolh5tq0aa	I'll have to agree that is very annoying, but what I find equally annoying is when the so called "parents" take their child or children to the movies. Especialy when its not even a kid movie.|`|bIouq64Oaa	How about people in restaurants that won't stop talking loudly on the phone? I think that's even worse because that's something that they could control more easily than a screaming child, and by not controlling it they show complete disrespect for everyone else.|`|aL3TNB6vaa	Sorry, but there's not much they can do. It's not their fault, and I'm sure they're more tired of that kid doing that bullcrap than you are. So I don't feel sorry for you, I feel sorry for the parents.|`|0ymlYQvnaa	I agree with you!<br>  there is nothing more annoying when the kid is acting up and the parents wont do anything!<br>  makes you wantto strangle the parents!|`|tLBjsrEFaa	The manager of the restaurant should force them to leave, its bad for business, because it is making the other peoples dining experience bad|`|fiUOGey6aa	Nope.....I think you hit the nail on the head there!  Nothing is worse than a kid who ruins it for everyone!|`|8pVN7Ciaaa	No, there is nothing more annoying!  Well, that loud kid on the city bus would drive me crazy too.|`|lHhoEB3Eaa	than people talking in cinemas<br>  people farting in the church|`|LYpLbM29aa	yeah i totally agree with you ( beat them bad )they just seem not to notice that it's ruining someone's evening.|`|DQMCRaoCaa	um yea dats how i wuld feel dat iz soooo annoying n not to mention embarrassing|`|VhHVjMe8aa	True!  What about people making out in public!  Like- get a room!|`|60c7b85533ff654ef788c2cbd51c8788aa	That's why you should avoid "Family Restaurants".<br>  <br>  What's worse than that is being literally "trapped" in your<br>  assigned seat on an airplane with that same kid right next<br>  to you and a mother that thinks "it's cute" that the little brat<br>  talks, drools and crawls all over you when all you want is a <br>  little peace and quiet and a little nap.<br>  <br>  I hate when that happens!|`|oojO4WAraa	That is very annoying.  You can get up and go talk to the manager and ask him to speak to them.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	it makes you wonder how the kids are at the dinner table at home. if we were traveling and needed to eat out and the kids were tired and all, we would pack our food and leave. first we removed the child from the area for the sake of others. there's no need to eat out and listen to some out of control kid. family restaurant or not. yes it may be louder and kids more antsy, but not to the point of making what i paid for uncomfortable.|`|YfCRmWeSaa	yes, it's annoying when your food isn't cooked all the way then you send it back and they do nothing to it when they return it|`|GeyFdO5jaa	Yes  its annoying but i just smile|`|NKuQh4sSaa	It can be annoying , granted , but as my view as a parent of an autistic child , sometimes it really cannot be helped . We like to dine out sometimes as a family and there can be occasions where my son gets upset and will scream and hit out and it takes a lot to get him to calm down.  I have had a load of really nasty comments about him and on one occasion someone said that I should have him locked up, even when I have explained that he is autistic. I don't see why me and my daughters should not be able to dine out without having snide comments if my son gets upset. A little thought before people react and make hurtful comments about my son would be appreciated.

PULQiKsJaa	yes, played strip poker a few times at parties always drunk and always woke up cringing!<br>  <br>  poll: thrown out the flat window|`|fHgbL046aa	EVERYDAY! Just kidding... I have gotten so drunk and not remember what happened that night. One time (years ago) my girlfriend had a bunch of guy friends tell me I was up on the table dancing and pulling up my dress. They only wish. but I did cry and they said were only joking, but I believed them. Also one time my boyfriend had sex with me and I had no idea, until he told me the next day. I know when I came home from partying (with the same girl) my dress would be half off and( with the same boyfriend) he would say "what the fukc" My friend had to undress me cause I was puking everywhere. He wasn't pleased. <br>  I do miss and loved those crazy years(90's). Now I don't drink, go to bars,or party. I feel old and ugly and worry about death and dying so much more.|`|DaokQBKhaa	Have you ever gotten drunk, took off your clothes, and refrigerated them?<br>  <br>  Me neither but we both know it's happened.|`|XZecjMyXaa	No|`|801kLaxQaa	Yeah, playing strip poker whilst wasted.

You should send me a pic of her u perv, I will suck her titties and lick her pussy way better than you will. She wants a real man with a real cock and I will get her to suck mine all night long. Tell you what, I'll videotape it for you so you can jack off to your wife moaning and groaning to the pleasure of a real man. And besides, if she quits whining, she is probably just laying there and taking it, rather than cumming like a fountain. I hope your wife knows how pathetic you are, I mean really? Dude, your asking about screwing your wife on frickin' Yahoo Answers. That's a little sad, don't you think? I hope she learns that your dong just isn't big enough for her hungry pussy. hahahahhahahahahahaha|`|dprURFLxaa	This actually works.  When I get it good, I don't give a crap what he does over the next couple days...but the effects will wear off and you'll have to do it again.  You're probably good for a day or so...at least in my house but we do it all the time so it's probably not as effective as it would be if she didn't get it all the time.|`|06YOGE1eaa	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  I loved Cel's answer.  She never fails to make me lmfao!!<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  <br>  Damn..  I remember those days.  Me and my fiance used to do it 3-4 times a day and now it is only once and I am always the one who  has to jump on top of him to get it started, because he is too damn lazy...  What is it going to be when we get married?  Three times a week.  Screw that.  I will stay engaged. I don't think I will ever get married anyways.  I don't see any point in it.  Especially if I was a man.  I have one son and I am going to teach him not to get married when he grows up.  He gets a divorce and the ***** takes everything.  If I was a man, I would NEVER marry.  I know this one dude and he lived in a $400,000 home and he was married for ten years.  His exwife took half everything he owned.  She got half the house and he had to sell it and give her 200k for the house and she takes over 60% of his check in alimony and child support.  I believe a man should have to pay child support, but I don't think a man should have to pay alimony.  That's a crock of shlt.|`|d69d49545272c36ef0603d8151da8422aa	3 times?

I drank milk straight up form the cow added chocolate powder and some tequila to it and didn't even ask her how she was feeling... <br>  <br>  Im so rude!|`|twy8S0L2aa	its true|`|AA11523465	I thought it was produced from lactating cows-- just given birth.  It's not like pregnant women produce milk.  It's only after the birth, when the baby needs it.<br>  <br>  And, yes, this is why they keep the cows pregnant.  To give birth, and keep producing more milk for a totally different species to drink-- US!!|`|f02fdd44028e78a86a13cf15a8da31e7aa	In order for a cow to start producing milk she has to go through at least 1 pregnancy. After that as long as she is milked regularly she will produce milk and does not have to get pregnant again.|`|ZaO65qpBaa	!>!>>!hahahah|`|yw0A4MOfaa	No, but you have to keep on milking them.
8bplNvAQaa	It depends on context.  <br>  <br>  All buildings are designed with a temperature in mind, and the services (heating etc) are designed around those parameters.<br>  <br>  Typically, room temperature associated with human comfort is in the early 20's range - typically 21 degrees Centigrade.<br>  <br>  Most people don't know this, and as the environments they live in (and the temperature they are comfortable with) follow these guidelines people just say room temperature because we all know that comfort feeling.<br>  <br>  These things are designed this way, even in your home.  Most people are ignorant to this fact.<br>  <br>  Interesting question, but its because people aren't specific and it's not exact.<br>  <br>  Its like saying, how much is a pinch of salt?|`|kvhc5eFIaa	LOL! That is a pretty random question there. XD<br>  <br>  Cuz room temperature fluctuates. Although, some people use it to describe the temperature when it is between 68-72. It doesn't really have a specific temperature. Whatever it is in the room, that is what the room temperature is.|`|WPd4MYt6aa	It's not the just room temperature it's the average room temperature. You can monitor the temperature for a few days and then average it out.|`|5cbILl1caa	well it's an average<br>  <br>  however if you're talking about "refrigeration" then room temp is exactly what the temp in that room is<br>  <br>  it's all relative|`|pfR5t4zkaa	*Snaps Fingers* <br>  "and your back in the room"<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Just thought i'd add a little more "room".<br>  The hypnosis dude of Little Britain.|`|AhoB10CTaa	as long as room temperature is above 69, i could care less. i'm freezing right now! stupid room temperature!|`|c77b996327401a827d6f388748da1db8aa	Because otherwise it wouldn't be room temperature..|`|9BUc0lgjaa	its not. room temperature is generally agreed to be roughly 75 degrees F.|`|HmqHf3qDaa	I thought room Temperature was,20dgs?C<br>  ie68 F|`|Ua1OiWmbaa	It's thought of as the "normal" temperature, so I'm told.|`|BJu1GAs8aa	Me thinks you are getting bored!|`|8pVN7Ciaaa	I know, right??|`|y0BxBs5Haa	thats a very good question|`|QEQmMZycaa	Ummm....pass!|`|19nadFCzaa	idk. good ?  ive wondered that too.|`|YfCRmWeSaa	because it's the favorable temp that most people are comfortable being in<br>  <br>  However, I do not like room temperature because I like a little chill in the air.|`|I5cF2hXdaa	With questions like this you will rip a hole in the time space continuum! So please for humanity's sake, stop it!|`|3b1f171c73bb2e24acbb7271e47a68faaa	Its not..... it is a clearly defined temperature and humidity range.  I work in pharmaceutical/biotech quality control lab in Boston.. We have specifications for certain chemicals, standards, even our drug products.  One of these specifications is for "CRT" Controlled Room Temp.  It is clearly defined by the FDA, USP and EP as being 15-30C and humidity levels of 50-75%.<br>  <br>  So, if your room is above 30C or below 15C, you are out of specification lol.<br>  <br>  Ive also seen 72F being "room temperature", but this is not how we measure temps in scientific environments|`|uvhq0MGpaa	I expect it`s ter do with relatives a lot of this stuff is It aint difficult ter rais the temperature in a room then folks coming in would say it was hot because they been in a different room.<br>  Simple ain`t it.|`|aae4d303fe9bd3bec8a94721211dbfbcaa	Very Wise Padawan You Are|`|186deac21531919b3fa042717df297e7aa	What ?xxx|`|cjMizdnJaa	An indoor temperature of from 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F), is classed as room temperature. <br>  Anything above or below this would be classed as above/below room temperature.<br>  But you knew this didn't you|`|iddMxOroaa	Please, Polls & Surveys is for fun, the cool peeps, get your geeky @ss out of here and into the physics section OK!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Lol, I can't believe so many peeps thought I was being serious, it must be all the Yanks, I've never been popular with them!|`|H93JbQS0aa	Room temperature varies! when we say room temperature means between 16 degrees - 21 degrees.<br>  <br>   So that is room temperature lol!|`|khnMoQNoaa	room temperature is 25C officially <br>  thought its 22C in the room im currently in|`|NT08sMBpaa	Hmmm this seems to be one of those questions that cant be answered like how do they get the jaffa into a jaffa cake.|`|ia0fECB0aa	Exactly!|`|w6xct1qQaa	Why you askin us thicko's in P & S?

Y1aAGPURaa	LOL!!!!   Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  A man is in bed with his wife when there is knocking on the door. He rolls over and looks at his clock. It's half past three in the morning.<br>  <br>  "I'm not getting out of bed at this time," he thinks, and rolls over.<br>  <br>  Then, a louder knock follows.<br>  <br>  "Aren't you going to answer that?" says his wife.<br>  <br>  So he drags himself out of bed, and goes downstairs. He opens the door and there is man standing at the door. It didn't take the homeowner long to realize the man was drunk.<br>  <br>  "Hi there," slurs the stranger, "Can you give me a push?"<br>  <br>  "No, get lost, it's half past three. I was in bed," says the man and slams the door.<br>  <br>  He goes back up to bed and tells his wife what happened and she says "Dave, that wasn't very nice of you. Remember that night we broke down in the pouring rain on the way to pick the kids up from the baby-sitter and you had to knock on that man's house to get us started again? What would have happened if he'd told us to get lost?"<br>  <br>  "But the guy was drunk," says the husband.<br>  <br>  "It doesn't matter," says the wife. "He needs our help and it would be the Christian thing to help him."<br>  <br>  So the husband gets out of bed again, gets dressed, and goes downstairs. He opens the door, and not being able to see the stranger anywhere he shouts, "Hey, do you still want a push?" and he hears a voice cry out, "Yeah, please!"<br>  <br>  So, still being unable to see the stranger, he shouts: "Where are you?"<br>  <br>  And the stranger replies: "I'm over here, on your swing."|`|a1PcWRQOaa	no i didnt like it|`|5kxwWtECaa	hey why did you give me the best answer for your other joke i cussed you out

JKRgfXFXaa	the earth is several billion years old, which means there has been plenty of time for our earth to be discovered but any intelligent force able to visit us would be able to manipulate and effect our being in unheard of, untold, ways that we couldn't ever imagine because they would be millions of years more advanced sort of like how an ant cannot understand how a human exists the universe is very, very, very large compared to earth which is very small to liken our earth to a electron wandering in the solar system confers grandeur it does not possess there are many more stars like our sun which would have several planets obiting them in our galaxy than grains of sand on all the beaches of earth and there are hundreds of billions of galaxys in the universe probably a hundred billion earth-like planets in our galaxy alone.i believe that mankind is not alone in the universe and most likely their are more advanced civilizations than ours but i am terribly limited by the fact i know of only one kind of life here on earth it seems to me that about 95% UFO sightings are explainable most likely gov't black-budget high technology research and development programs but that leaves the 5% of genuine 'craft' which defy our logic and occupy our sky's which millions of people see each year and which i dont think scientists pay enough attention to its very taboo which is unfortunate. im am not sure if the extra-terrestrails would have the technology to travel from galaxy to galaxy millions of lightyears 5,878,000,000,000 miles is one light year mostly because it would mean the technology would so advanced we would be helpless and these beings would surely view us a violent civilization with mankinds addiction to war, our first impressions were probably not that of a peaceful speices recently in the past century mankind has created the nuclear weapon humankind could potentially destroy all life on earth eight-times over and humanity has emerged on the universal stage so to speak and maybe other civilizations were curious and came to take a look, or have you ever thought that maybe this phenomenon of aliens and spaceships are actually people from the future coming back to warn us that humanity has stark choice aheads of us to make either use nuclear energy to carry missles to the nations or to lauch probes to the planets i mean i always hear about 'the greys' with the pale skin and big black eyes which is what we would maybe look like if our sun slowly ran out of energy over the next million years or for that matter since im talking crazy what if its intelligent beings which percieve in other dimensions, which man cannot understand, they need not be in the same three dimensions that man percieves the 4th. or higher dimensions could be alive with other kinds of life forms and if they were able to view our 3D world from the 4th. dimension, us and our world would be an open-book, there would be no where to hide<br>  i personally have seen something amazing in the sky once, which is why i am interested in the mystery that is 'space'  i dont claim it was out of this world but i do remember that it was brilliant, unlike anything ive seen before or since, it was a huge glowing pulsing sphere of bright blue light hovering silently above the trees, then suddenly it turned to like molten magma a deep red-orange like the sun was out in the night sky and then instantly disappeared its something ill never forget.<br>  you say you believe in aliens so does that mean you believe they are abducting people...? what could they possible want from us? see humans study animals in the wild to extract information and/or prevent extinction i would assume that humanity would be studied in much the same way by any intelligent force able to come here and disturbingly many sane people alota crazy people too claim they are being abducted by beings and their DNA is taken attempting to produce hybrid beings maybe a little out there but whos purpose is to integrate into our society or more likely to try not to become automatons, robot-like and without emotions, their advanced physiology may have bred out most of what we call emotions and they feel it is necessary to acquire the human touch to become better beings in their own society.<br>  to assume that an intelligence force not of this earth would be benevolent towards mankinds emergence and wish to protect us from both universal forces and forces within our nature i find improbable anddangerous kind of like when europeans came to north america the animals had no fear of them which was a big mistake on their part but then again they could be extraordinary teachers and humanity could learn wondrous things.<br>  <br>  to much...?|`|MUuKSFgvaa	Sometimes I do, other times' I'm like, no way.<br>  <br>  Answer mine please?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090227073312AA4ChMN">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|qXkywBogaa	do u believe in me ?<br>  if u do u believe in alliens|`|4TmN5Dohaa	I work with aliens every day.|`|DwMjWEH0aa	NO...|`|59nnnZOAaa	yes|`|twy8S0L2aa	no|`|dgGtwSIzaa	Yes !!!

Y0w2Pk5kaa	Waffles???|`|yZkOeAgRaa	Raised waffles--the absolute best ever!<br>  <br>  1/2 cup warm water <br>  1 package active dry yeast <br>  2 cups milk, warmed <br>  1/2 cup butter, melted <br>  1 teaspoon salt <br>  1 teaspoon sugar <br>  2 cups all-purpose flour <br>  2 eggs <br>  1/4 teaspoon baking soda <br>  Real Vermont Maple Syrup and Butter to serve<br>  <br>  INSTRUCTIONS: Use a rather large mixing bowl -- the batter will rise to double its original volume. Put the water in the mixing bowl and sprinkle in the yeast. Let stand for 5 minutes, until yeast dissolves. Add the milk, butter, salt, sugar and flour to the yeast and beat until smooth and blended. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let stand overnight at room temperature. <br>  <br>  Just before cooking the waffles, beat in the eggs, add the baking soda and stir until well mixed. The batter will be very thin. Cook on a very hot waffle iron (use about 1/3 cup batter per grid). Bake until the waffles are golden and crisp to the touch. <br>  <br>  Note: If there is any leftover batter, store in a covered container in the refrigerator.

YhYapmbIaa	O well, I don't know what to say about this cuz it is not like I have a choice on weather I let them take my taxes away or not,s o what can I do besides work hard so my money can go into paying other people's mortgage cuz the bank didn't think I could pay a mortgage for my house but I can sure pay for other people's... Funny funny bankers! I wish I could put my foot p their funny path! Oh well <br>  Love <br>  Pearl|`|dKyUhbYOaa	Yet, it was democratic when we invaded and conquered Iraq for no good reason? They told us Hussein had WMDs, and he's dead and the WMDs were never found. Yet were socialist because taxes go up. That really makes sense....<br>  <br>  As for raising taxes, it's almost inevitable. Democratic or Republican, how else is the gov't going to alleviate the national debt? Sure taxes go up, but living here sure as hell beats living in other places even now in our economic crisis.<br>  <br>  For the record, FDR in the '30s implemented many acts that have been seen as socialist, but sometimes desperate times call for desperate measures. I wouldn't mind paying more taxes if it means our country as a whole prospers despite the rest of the world going under.|`|AA10345820	It would seem the logical thing to do.|`|lFyMYKuOaa	agree<br>  :)~|`|PnWhN603aa	I think the extra S will get added in at some point.

vuRejUo3aa	One person  exactly did so, Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose, who discovered first that trees have life! And one of Rabindra NathTagore's short-story-characters did so! It means someone is there to think that way. What I personally did once: I kissed the bamboo-leaves alone in a bush at my country-home & every early morning I did so before waking up of all! I loved the bamboo leaves like my sweet-love; dews were there & that gave me the exact wet touch of my beloved one!|`|vOD4Urzdaa	It would be interesting, I bet some would say some horrible things though...|`|dgGtwSIzaa	Yes , actually I do !<br>  <br>  Have You been watching me try ?

Since then  we do not talk to each other through out the year and send no emails or any signs of contact. But we end up wishing each other every year on our birthdays. It gives me a wonderful feeling to know that someone still remembers me. Infact, last year my cell fone no. changed and I have no clue how he managed to find my new no. and wished me.<br>  <br>  It is beyond words what it feels to have that sort of a connection.|`|HA8bxrLTaa	Yes, a former boyfriend/former contact who lived in NJ (I'm in Chicago) left me a text message that said "A thought from or even about you is enough to make my mind's world an awe to experience..."|`|7uqAS3Ozaa	my ex students but not now! they are like completely forgotten me! it is already 2 months that they didnt contact me! it is upsetting !|`|AORcLwTNaa	no|`|57elaG5faa	yup

1tLmTjBxaa	YEs ,when it rains ,the smell that comes from the mud,i like to eat it|`|FaB2v37Aaa	Well technically you do.  Smell is actually part of the hunger mechanism.  The smell of food is directly related to how it tastes to you.  Try holding your nose and eating something, and eating the same thing with your nose open.  It will taste very different.|`|4YnoykD2aa	Yes. Popcorn usually smells better than it tastes.<br>  Jelly bean?|`|nDAnSuVBaa	Yeah.<br>  <br>  Like I hate pasties, but they smell lush. :D|`|dgGtwSIzaa	Yeah hehe lots of times .|`|fiUOGey6aa	yep....sometimes the smell is the only good thing about the food|`|57elaG5faa	nope
dqZrq7Zeaa	I disagree they as much of a leaf as they ever were. They are just no long part of  a "tree". But what the leaf is remains unchanged.|`|13cc03f46e318a1a2bae06264512cbc6aa	The life of the leaf and tree leave it because it is not attached to it's source anymore.  It becomes empty of that vibrancy.  It still can be wonderful to put between the pages of a book or in a frame.  You can rake it into a pile and jump into it.

9poqDrd5aa	Fruits basket is awesome and has a love triangle :P the anime is supposed to be good but i truly enjoyed the manga.<br>  <br>   i dont know were you read your manga or anime or if you buy it, go to onemanga.com,mangavolume.com or mangafox.com and look for the "search manga" option (on onemanga just look on the right hand side, you might have to scroll down a little bit) and from the selections i normally choose to do a search for "romance","comedy" and for the most part "complete" (i dont enjoy the ongoing-irregular) and if you want to use it to find which series have been made into anime aswell then just check that selection too. <br>  not all of the results will have "love triangles" but there are plenty of awesome manga to choose from, you should be able to find pretty much any manga from those 3 sites, otherwise do a google search for online manga viewer or if you want to download realityLAPSE.com is pretty good. All the above mentioned sites are completely free for online viewing but do contain ad's but onemanga does a good job of keeping pop-up, flashing or noisy ads off, but i just use firefox 3.0 and the ad-block plus addon so it makes little difference to me.<br>  Onemanga has removed fruits basket but its still on mangavolume.<br>  <br>  Cheers, hope i helped|`|bsnnEsp5aa	Your link doesn't work<br>  <br>  But I recommend these :: (will edit if you get a working link)<br>  <br>  KIMIKISS ~PURE ROUGE~(romance, comedy, drama, love triangle, high school)<br>  It's spring, and love is in the air! Sanada Kouichi wakes up one morning to find a strange girl barging into his house and making herself at home. Only after his friend, Aihara Kazuki, shows up later does he recognize the girl as their childhood friend Mizusawa Mao, who has been living overseas for the past two years. With her parents still overseas, Mao will be living with Kouichi and attending high school with him and Kazuki. The three of them will rely on each other to overcome their challenges with school, friendship, and of course love!<br>  <br>  ITAZURA NA KISS (romance, comedy, drama)<br>  Kotoko Aihara has always been in love with Naoke Irie; he’s tall, handsome, and rumored to be the most intelligent student in Japan – who wouldn’t be? Only one thing stands in the way of a relationship with Irie: Kotoko is ditzy and is at the bottom set of her school, and Irie-kun hates nothing more than ditzy, stupid girls. When disaster strikes and Kotoko is forced to move in with Irie-kun’s family, she suddenly sees her chance to bridge the gap. After all, even cool, super-intelligent guys must have a soft spot, right?<br>  <br>  BOKURA GA ITA (drama, romance, love triangle, high school)<br>  Yano Motoharu is the most popular guy in class, the school’s basketball ace, and highly charismatic to boot! No wonder Nanami Takahashi can’t resist falling in love with him. When Yano returns Nana’s feelings, things seem too good to be true and the two begin a relationship; but Yano has a contradictory personality which confuses Nana most of the time. On top of that, tragic events in Yano’s past won’t stop haunting their relationship. Unable to halt their passionate feelings, are Yano and Nana heading for disaster or can they save each other from irreparable hurt?<br>  <br>  PEACH GIRL (Highly recommended) (drama, romance, love triangle, high school)<br>  Momo is loud, shallow, a player, a betrayer, and one to best stay away from -- or at least, that's the misconception people have when they see her makeup, bleached hair and suntanned skin. In reality, Momo just wants the same friends, hobbies and crushes any girl her age would like. However, when her only friend starts spreading rumours about her, her boyfriend starts to doubt her, and the most popular boy in school starts to take a more then friendly interest in her, she'll have much more to worry about than just her appearance!<br>  <br>  NANA (high recommended) (drama, romance, love triangle)<br>  Nana Komatsu is on her way to Tokyo; now she can finally be with her boyfriend after a year of dating long-distance! On the train there, Nana Komatsu meets Nana Osaki – a girl who shares her name but seems to be everything Nana Komatsu is not; cool, street-wise, and a punk rocker. The two hit it off and spend the entire journey getting to know each other, but when they get to Tokyo, circumstance separates them seemingly forever. However, fate is not finished with these two. Whilst hunting for a place to live the two Nanas again cross paths. They decide to share a flat and become best friends in no time. Nana K. must learn to be independent and mature, while Nana O. works on becoming famous with her band; but together, they will learn about love and loss, and the growth that comes with it.<br>  <br>  HONEY & CLOVER (drama, romance, comedy, love triangle, art college)<br>  Art college: cradle of romance, home of bittersweet comedy. Takemoto is struggling to find his direction in life, while his roommates Morita and Mayama are moving confidently (or recklessly) towards their goals. Enter Hagu-chan, the childlike and beautiful prodigy whom everyone admires… and thus the love triangles begin. Honey & Clover explores the pain of first love, the trials of romantic conflict, and our loyalty to those annoying people who happen to be our closest friends…<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D|`|j0XVPPNTaa	Shugo Chara:<br>  Synopsis:<br>  Every child has an egg in their heart, unseen at first, an egg with the would-be self of their dreams. Hinamori Amu, part of a group called the Guardians, protect those eggs from becoming x-eggs, eggs filled with resentment and resignation that gives children troubles. Amu’s job is to capture and restore x-eggs to their orginal form. She does this with the help of her three Shugo Chara (guardian characters or her would be selves), Ran, Miki and Su. Thanks to them she can change her character and abilities, and so fight against the mysterious organization Easter which aim is to find a special egg called Embryo using the x-eggs.|`|ckeBvt23aa	Zero no Tsukaima (English: The Familiar of Zero)|`|REfvEVe8aa	i would try vampire knight or zombie loan which is sooooo cool hope helps|`|ZRGkOB7oaa	VAMPIRE KNIGHT HANDS DOWN! haha It really good, well at least i enjoyed it|`|SGIMCEoqaa	NARUTO!<br>  BLEACH!<br>  ONE PIECE!<br>  Death Note<br>  Azumanga doiah<br>  vampire knight<br>  <br>  go to anime-media.com theres a huge list of love or action animes there and if you like dubbed anime go to dubhappy.com :) <br>  <br>  hope this helps.

pS02JGTUaa	well, i think the 'suicide' of kurt cobain has stirred up a lot of controversy within his fans.<br>  for one, a lot believe (me included) that he was murdered by courtney love.<br>  the suicide note he wrote can be interpreted in many ways, and i see it as a note to her saying he wants a divorce.<br>  <br>  it also has shed a lot more light on suicide, addiction, and depression because he was a grunge icon.<br>  him doing this has made people realize what can actually happen to someone if they dont get help when they need it<br>  <br>  good luck, you picked a good thing to write a speech on (:|`|B3N388wBaa	I did something like that in my English class. The topic was that your were suppose to write a report about someone that influenced American history. I pick Kurt Cobain as well.<br>  <br>  He's a very big influence with grunge music. He may have not started it, but he helped it become the biggest thing during the 1990's. But when he committed suicide, the impact was huge! There were reports that thousands of teens committed suicide a short while afterwords because of his death. Also, at his funeral, thousands, possibly millions of people attended.|`|mCV4NIZvaa	You should definitely watch the documentary movie called Kurt and Courtney.  It's very good and discusses this topic in depth.

5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	I was thinking he would be a great escort ( now that would piss LuLu off ) The way he jumped into that Tux and flew off to Manhattan with Maxie made me think he could make a fortune escorting woman who have no escort ! ( and if an occasional good looking woman comes along...well that's just a bonus )<br>  <br>   Yes,,,,I'm thinking LuLu would be throwing one of her hissy-fits|`|M1ymLE9Paa	It's def a career option.  I'm sure he'd have an open mind about.  He'd get paid mucho bucks for being pretty, which he could save towards getting a garage of his own.  And he could just use his first name only, like some models do...so he could simply be Johnny, w/o the Zacharra name attached. ;-)|`|msUIsv8maa	Yes Johnny has turned out to be a really nice Guy since he left the Business He deserves a chance at a real job & a real Life.Hes Trying.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	That would be great for him and I heard that Ethan starts falling for Lulu so maybe that will take her away from Johnny|`|1wtCuLR2aa	he will open a garage to repair cars with Dante as a partner.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	Well, right now he's thinking if Kate keeps paying him $1000 to escort Maxie he'll soon have enough money to buy that garage that they were in during the storm. Somehow, I don't think it'll turn out that way. Will a Mob Prince really want to do physical labor, especially after earning big bucks for dressing up and going to parties? Or, when his father's gone will he get lured back into the mob?|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Yes and it would be amusing as well! Lulu would be steamed about all these woman hanging on him all the time!|`|AA12315431	I think if he wants to do it he should do it. He isn't having any luck finding a regualr job and the modeling pays well, so why not? I understand Lulu being insecure about him and Maxie going to parties together. I wouldn't be thrilled about it either. kate is such an insensitive b**ch.|`|SqNPj54Kaa	I think he will keep doing it for the money, and he may even get very popular.  Then he can get the upper edge over Kate and give her back some of all the crap that she dishes out.|`|Y5jv0ybFaa	Yes, I can see Johnny going "GQ" on us but if Ethan turns out to be Luke's own son and they have Lulu falling for him then ....ewwwwwwwwww .|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I don't think I could see Johnny as a model.
FdUKvE6xaa	No. I have an appreciation for vodka and occasionally other hard liquor, but that's it. I am vegan though, which is sometimes considered part of a sxe lifestyle.<br>  <br>  "and if you are , why arent you ?"<br>  <br>  That makes absolutely no sense. Maybe you need to start drinking & drugging it up. :)|`|80t10xWGaa	Nope, I drink.<br>  <br>  I'll smoke a cig ONCE IN A WHILE<br>  <br>  I don't do any drugs or marijuana.|`|GFJmg9BQaa	nope.<br>  <br>  i drink and dont do any drugs besides ganjuhhh which i dont want to get any criritcisim about its my choice ;]|`|cNdkNYKOaa	i am and have been my whole life<br>  i don't see the point in any of the habits that i don't engage in|`|kYgvMsYbaa	LOL no|`|80Dyljhdaa	I am today....but that's because I'm super hungover.|`|A7xzNQn6aa	yessss- NO Drinking, NO smoking NO sex.

xcPzZvsraa	Alexander Thayer's Life Of Beethoven is one I've read and highly recommend.<br>  Alexander Wheelock Thayer lived some forty years after Beethoven.<br>  His intention was to produce a biography that told the truth,free of the myth and embellishments that were common practice of the time.<br>  He dug up every letter that was written by or to Beethoven that was still in existence.<br>  This originally two volume opus re-prints many of these in full.<br>  He also chased down anyone who was still living who knew the man.<br>  The research is quite phenomenal.   <br>  Attention to detail and accuracy are two of it's hallmarks.<br>  In fact some may find it a little too detailed in parts,it depends how much you really want to know about Ludwig.|`|InAICv25aa	One of my professors recommended the one written by Maynard Solomon.

wnMHpB8Gaa	quest deserves to win it more. their difficulty in dancing level surpasses beat freaks by far.

g8TJfVvFaa	I've watched a few movies but here are some of my favorite.  I'll add a little about the show and what I thought.<br>  <br>  The Classic - Definitely gonna bring tears and a bittersweet ending to it.  It tells the story of a girl and the boy she loves through letters that her daughter finds.  What's even more amazing it that the situation is occurring in her daughter's life too but switched around a bit.  Truly a sad, but amazing story.<br>  He Was Cool - Definitely funny but with a nice serious touch to it.  It's about a teenage girl who "rapes" the infamous bad boy.  Of course, she really doesn't but this causes him to claim her as his girl and the story continues from there. <br>  Jenny, Juno - Quite humorous with lovable characters.  They are just teens having a baby but it's still sweet.  They are young teenagers who are now caught up in an unexpected pregnancy. <br>  Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do - This movie has some sadness to it but ultimately it's a sweet movie about two teenagers.  The girl is new and a relationship develops between her and her neighbor.  It turns out that his best friend shares a past with her.<br>  200 Pound Beauty - Very funny but I didn't love it as much as others.  The girl is overweight but a talented singer.  She goes and gets plastic surgery to be able to get the man of her dreams and the career she always wanted.  <br>  Too Beautiful To Lie -  Again, another comedy worth watching.  The girl gets caught in a tangle of lies when she says that she's engaged to this guy.  She's welcomed into the family and the story evolves as the family begins to love her while the guy continues to convince his family that it isn't true.<br>  A Moment to Remember - This story is really sad.  It has the same amazing actress in The Classic. Here the girl finds and fall in love with the guy who heads the project at her father's construction site.  Their love evolves but soon she realizes that their is something terribly wrong with her.<br>  Temptation of the Wolves - My favorite K-movie of them all.  It has some comedy but it's sad.  It's about a girl who is very simple in looks, but catches the attention of the two best guys.  The two guys are rivals.  <br>  <br>  I didn't want to spoil any of the movies if you haven't watched it yet.<br>  <br>  Korean Dramas that I thought were great.  You can find great synopsis of the show if you check out <a href="http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.d-addicts.com/Main_Page</a><br>  My Name is Kim Sam Soon<br>  Delightful Girl<br>  Tree of Heaven<br>  My Girl<br>  I'm Sorry, I Love You<br>  Stairway to Heaven<br>  Goong<br>  18 vs 29

And I've heard that Soul Eater is quite a bit like Bleach, and that Claymore is really good.<br>  <br>  Monster.  It's not magical or sci-fi, but it is a psychological thriller.

wWzK6eJaaa	Well fluoxetine is Prozac, so you are getting treated for depression and possibly anxiety. Thats why they call it a depressive illness, Its basically a term doctors use for people who are suffering from depression. Because depression is an illness, just like other disorders like bi-polar, anorexia, dementia, etc. The doctor wants you to stay on it for 2 years because you must be suffering from long term depression and some ptsd. Usually short term depression can be treated quickly, short term depression, is like when someone has a traumatic experience but its fades with in time, maybe loss of a pet or a small car accident.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with the Prozac, just look out for side effects and always tell ur doctor when something isnt right, especially thoughts of suicide.|`|mUed9bXYaa	a mental disorder that affects your mood... manic depression (Bipolar disorder) is a kind of depressive illness as you can go from ridiculously happy to almost suicidally sad within minutes... although i think you'd know if you had that|`|4YnoykD2aa	You have depression.You likely do need an antidepressant for awhile. It is serious. It can lead to suicidal thinking etc. I'm bipolar, uncontrolled, and will be on my antidepressant for life. I'm a real bad case though. Read up on it. Google it. Go to sites like the Mayo Clinic. Educate yourself on other things you can do to help yourself.  Good luck with it. Peace out.<br>  Jelly bean?|`|ufdFei1jaa	Depression is defined as a lowering of mood and is a word commonly used by people when describing feelings of unhappiness or normal sadness. However, depression becomes a recognisable illness when the degree of mood change is out of proportion to the circumstances and is unduly prolonged.<br>  Mood is defined as “ A pervasive and sustained emotion that colours the person’s thinking and perception of the world.”<br>  Mood disorders therefore include mania [heightened mood]. Some healthcare professionals also include anxiety as a mood disorder, since depressive and anxiety disorders often occur together. Dysthymia is a chronic low-grade depressive disorder.<br>  Historically mood disorders were often referred to as affective disorders. The term “affective” has been replaced by “mood.”|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	I believe Depressive Illness is the same as Depression or MDD-Major Depressive Disorder. It is a serious illness, that's what landed you in the hospital, but will get better with therapy and medication.

J4cSgIreaa	Bob Marley was born in the small village of Nine Mile in Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica as Nesta Robert Marley. A Jamaican passport official would later swap his first and middle names.His father Norval Sinclair Marley was a white Scottish Jamaican. Norval was a Marine officer and captain, as well as a plantation overseer, when he married Cedella Booker, a black Jamaican then eighteen years old Norval provided financial support for his wife and child, but seldom saw them, as he was often away on trips. In 1955, when Marley was 10 years old, his father died of a heart attack at age 60. Marley suffered racial prejudice as a youth, because of his mixed racial origins and faced questions about his own racial identity throughout his life. <br>  <br>  He once reflected:<br>  <br>  I don't have prejudice against meself. My father was a white and my mother was black. Them call me half-caste or whatever. Me don't dip on nobody's side. Me don't dip on the black man's side nor the white man's side. Me dip on God's side, the one who create me and cause me to come from black and white.<br>  <br>  Although Marley recognized his mixed ancestry, throughout his life and because of his beliefs, he self-identified as a black African. In songs such as "Black Progress,", "African Herbsman," "Buffalo Soldier", "War" and others, Marley sings about the struggles of blacks and Africans against opression from the West or "Babylon."

The talent just seems to have disappeared.|`|gRkpFHNzaa	Any singers that remove the fiddles and steel guitars from their stage performances should be outlawed from ever performing again. Can you imagine if George Strait got rid of his steel guitar & fiddle players just because these young kids now a days found the sound too country? It would not only set Texas back on it's haunches but it would shake the entire country music community. I say bring back the fiddles and steel guitars.|`|JY5vABcCaa	It would nice to have a sub-category to the Y/A country section. i.e. Classic Country, but it's not gonna happen.

She still doesn't know I have my nipples done!<br>  <br>  All my tattoos are easy to cover when needs be, and it is possible for me to take my lip ring out when ever needs be.<br>  They in no way effect my education, working abilities or morals. <br>  Tattoos are art, the canvas is my skin.<br>  People have many different opinions on them, I respect those who disagree, I think people should repect my choices also...|`|p5kzRDIpaa	I don't know, a few of my friends parents are like that, its probably because you parents dont want you modifying/changing your body and they probs want you to stay natural etc cos your their daughter<br>  my mum love piercings, when i get them she says they look nice and its me expressing who i am and its my choice etc, plus shes paying and coming with me for my tattoo when im 18<br>  however my nan said (about my 3 facial piercings) that im spoiling myself and ruining my looks etc|`|AGP2dI6uaa	It's funny, my parents used to be the same way.  Then I moved out and eventually got piercings and tattoos and they were just like "oh well..." They didn't really get that upset because I remain well-behaved, gainfully employed, etc...  They'll get over it.|`|HPmkvWcUaa	Parents just know how you might regret piercings and tattoos. Especially concerning tattoos, what you like as a teenager is not necessarily what you will like the rest of your life.

Bela Bartok's wife had very small hands and he wrote a special concerto just for her...number 3.<br>  <br>  You must be very careful not to strain your hands. Stretching may not help. What you CAN do is make sure that your thumb joints are not sinking in, but are strong and supported. Often the knuckle closest to the palm collapses or sinks and this makes the hand smaller. Ask your teacher for a couple of exercises, but be gentle. <br>  <br>  Actually, my span is only a 9th, but there are MANY professional pianists who do not have big hands, and do just fine. I really wouldn't worry about it. Roll the chord for your band piece and know that the band director will understand. It's no problem and is very common.|`|CXgPkEPFaa	Play only the top or bottom key, or change the chord around a little.|`|6jQrWsMfaa	You can stretch it.  I play the piano too!

It was commanded by Helmsman Castillo to her death.<br>  <br>  2. Jonathan Archer's father died of what fatal degenerative disease?<br>  <br>  Such an icky thing to have Clarke's Disease. Perhaps Dr. Arik Soong was right and that there might have been a cure for it.<br>  <br>  3. What was Majel Barrett Roddenberry's birth name?<br>  <br>  I love that woman and I will miss her.

9poqDrd5aa	the 6-tailed naruto looks absolutely crazily awesome! sorta weird how the materialized bones flop around though. as for what happens next i think that pein/pain is going to use that ultimate technique which he used to level konoha but it seems that the main pain (his name escapes me but not god realm, his real body) is running low on chakra, i cant wait to see team gai join the brawl, and i wonder how yamamoto is going react/do. <br>  <br>  As for the seal the yondaime used to seal the kyuubi you can properly see the sandaime use it in naruto chapters 122-123.<br>  <br>  I wonder whats gonna happen now, from what was said in the chapter kakashi and yamamoto put yet another seal on naruto, from what i saw it was placed through the idaime's necklace (I think Idaime is spelled wrong but 1 in jap is ichi dont know how to ocnnect to daime like yon (4) or san (3) ) since right after transforming the necklace released a bunch of white cloth looking "sheets" of chakra right before kyuubi/naruto crushed the necklace.<br>  <br>  well thats all i have to give for now... cant wait for the next chapter<br>  <br>  (although I have used "seems" above its not like a really had to guess anything, just to keep a misunderstanding from happening)|`|SGIMCEoqaa	death seal the thrid hokage uses but instead he fused it in naruto instead of taking it down because he thinks it could benefit the village instead of destroying it.|`|ATKZ39Ceaa	I think it was amazing!!!

uuMK3qrXaa	"Christopher B and Robyn F have been involved in a dating relations for approx 1 and half year. On Sunday Feb 8 at 25 hours Brown was driving a vehicle with Robyn F as the front passenger on an unknown street in Los Angeles. Robin F picked brown,s cellular phone and picked up a three-page text message from a woman Brown had had a previous relationship with.<br>  <br>  "A verbal argument ensued and Brown pulled a vehicle over in an unknown street. Reach over Robyn F with his right hand and open the car door and attempted to force her out. Brown was unable to force Robyn F out of the vehicle because she was wearing a seat belt. When he could not force her to exit he took his right hand and shoved her head against the passenger window of the vehcile causing an approx 1 inch raised circular contusion.<br>  <br>  "Robyn F turned to face Brown and punched her in the left eye with right hand. He then drove away in the vehicle and continued to punch her in the face with his right hand while steering the vehicle with his left hand. The assault caused Robyn F Osmouth to fill with blood and blood to splatter all over her clothing and the interior of the vehicle. Brown looked at Robyn F and stated "I am going to beat the s–t out of you when we get home! You wait and see!?<br>  <br>  "Robyn F picked her cellular phone and called her personal assistant Jennifer Rosales. Rosales did not answer the telephone but while her vm greeting was playing Robyn F pretended to talk to her and stated "I am on my way home. Make sure the cops are there when I get there? (this statement was made while greeting was playing and was not captured) after Robyn f faked the call, Brown and looked at her and stated, 'You just did the stupidest thing ever! Now I really am going to kill you.'<br>  <br>  "Brown resumed punching Robyn F and she interlocked her fingers behind her head and brought her elbows forward to protect her face. She then bent over at the waist placing her elbows and face near her lap and in attempt to protect her face and head from the barrage of punches being levied by Brown. Brown continued to punch Robyn F on her left arm and hands, causing her to suffer a contusion on her left triceps that was approx 2 inches in diameter and numerous contusions on her left hand. Robyn f attempted to send another text message to other personal assistant Melissa Ford. Brown snatched the cellular telephone out of her hand and threw it out of the window to an unknown street. Brown continued driving and Robyn F observed his cellular phone in his lap. She picked up the cellular phone with her left hand, and before she could make a call, he placed her in a head lock with right hand and continued to drive the vehicle with his left hand.<br>  <br>  "Brown held Robyn F close to him and bit her on her left hear. She was able to feel the vehicle swerving from right to left as Brown sped away. He stopped the vehicle in front of [address] and Robyn F turned off the car removed the key from inignition and sat on it. Brown did not know what she did with the key and began punching her in the face and arms. Brown began applying pressure to Robyn F left and right carotid arteries causing her to be unable to breath. She began to lose consciousness. She reached up with her left hand and began to attempting to gauge his eyes in attempt to flee herself. Brown bit her left ring and middle fingers and released her. While brown continued to punch her she turned around a place her back to against the passenger door. She brought her knees to her chest and placed her feet against Brown,s body and began pushing him away.<br>  <br>  "Brown continued to punch her on legs and feet causing several contusions. Robyn F began screaming for help. And Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighbor heard Robyn F,s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F was issued a domestic violence protective order (EPO). Affiant conducted an interview with Melissa Ford who advised on Feb. 8 2009 at 2500 hours she received a phone call from Robin F from an unknown telephone number later identified as the telephone number of Officer Chavez. Robin F had advised Ford that she had been assaulted by Brown. At approx at 1 am Brown called Ford as nothing happened. Ford advised Brown that she had already talked to Robin F and was aware of what happened. Ford had advised brown that the neighbors had called police and that they were with Robyn F. Brown had asked Ford if robin F had provided police with his name. And ford advised him that she had. Brown hung up the telephone and did not call back.<br>  <br>  "On Feb. 8, Brown turned himself in and was given a copy of the EPO and advised to not contact Robyn.<br>  <br>  "On Feb. 17 Ford advised the affiant that she had received text messages from … a number that Ford recognized as belonging to Brown. In the text message Brown apologized for what he had done to Robin F. and advised Ford he was going to get help."|`|3CQb6PSFaa	yeah, "krlos's" answer is right, it's really sad, and i see no reason why Rhianna's career should be over.|`|AxqDAlBeaa	Chris Brown hitting Rihanna was totally uncalled for. You should NEVER hit a woman for any reason. He tainted his music career for doing this. I used to like this guy as a r&b artist. Now...I really don't respect him as much....|`|EK2rJXYYaa	I think we need to be fair to Chris.  He's only 19 and he was brought up in an abusive home.  He's sick and he needs counseling and help.  Let's not condemn him, but help him.  I think he is an example to the youth what can happen when you make bad decisions.|`|RBcPCirJaa	I used to LOVE Chris Brown; But when I heard about what he did to Rihanna, Now I absolutely dislike him. What he did was wrong and I think HIS carrer should be over; Not Rihanna's. Rihanna didn't do anything; She was just the victim in this case.|`|dhr7nnxoaa	II honestly dont know what to think.Chris Brown is such an amzing singer but domestic violence is never ok.I wish the best for Rihanna and hope Chris Brown learns from his mistake.
FnyiaxGlaa	Black??|`|PULQiKsJaa	black:)|`|GFJmg9BQaa	black.<br>  <br>  the white ones remind me of like star wars or somethign lol.|`|2Ltc1dAwaa	For the season, I definately think the black works well.  I think the white is too much of a contrast and shortens the length of your legs.  <br>  The black boots look more sexy, make your legs longer and are more neutral, especially for the season.  <br>  <br>  The white boots make your thighs look larger than they are because they cut your legs off.  The boots draw the attention away for your figure and separate your calves from your upper leg.  White boots also make you seem like your trying too hard to create an outfit.  <br>  <br>  <br>  The black creates a smooth and longer leg, making your legs appear longer and sleeker. <br>  <br>  Black boots will also match much better with any top you decide you wear.  Try to wear a longer top in a darker colour, such as a grey or black.  <br>  Finish the outfit with some great long necklaces which have purple in them, so that you can bring out the importance of purple in your outfit.  <br>  <br>  Girl, you look great!  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|eMSv7RwYaa	black looks best generally. But if you are wearing a white top or white accessories then sometimes white would suit it.|`|LWEfc0UOaa	black...white ones would look better with grey leggings|`|IYJPydXYaa	Why would you wear purple leggings?

Ekg4H6HQaa	Work in the business, for one. You have to know people, for two. People become background singers in different ways, though. You could always go to a record company near you (call or show up, whichever) and ask them how to do it. If you know a singer who needs backup, if they like you and you mesh well with each other (voices), they may ask you to help. It all depends but you'd have to be around people who know people and people who know people who need people. It's not easy.

94zi1LFFaa	"Everything You Wanted To Know About The Eighth House But Were Afraid To Ask"<br>  <br>  Yes, the eighth house, it’s the house in astrology that curls your spine and the one everyone whispers about because of it’s taboo nature. It governs "forbidden" topics such as sex, death, the occult and other people’s money! In addition, it is the most profound of all of the houses.<br>  The eighth house represents the release from personal limitations, which means rebirth/ regeneration and even death. Being second to the seventh house, the eighth house also signifies the money or possessions of partners. It also represents extraction of essences, expenditures, mysteries, business corporations, the stock market, research, restoration, psychoanalysis, and taxes. In addition, the eighth house brings to mind transformation, reincarnation, removal, recycling, scandals and secrets.<br>  Its corresponding sign and planet in astrology is Scorpio and the planet of Pluto. In the tarot, it correlates with the cards of Death and Judgment. In Numerology, it would correlate with the number of 22, the master builder.<br>  The eighth house is one of the psychic trinity of water houses , part of the triangle of the soul, in conjunct with the fourth and twelfth houses. All three of them deal with the past.<br>  In case you are wondering who would qualify for an "8th house person", I would say a Sun Sign Scorpio, someone born with a natal Sun in the 8th house or stellium of planets in the 8th house, someone who has natal aspects to the Sun and Pluto, one born with natal Pluto in the 1st house, and/or just having Scorpio on your 8th house cusp.<br>  Now if you are having an 8th house person coming over for dinner, may I suggest some type of seafood perhaps prepared in a nice spicy cajun sauce. Wear a black or crimson colored slinky outfit , and have the lights dimmed with a little jazz music softly playing in the background.<br>  If you need to buy an 8th house person a gift for some occasion, you can select a mystery or true crime novel, a book on the occult, an exotic perfume or something with a hint of musk in it, an antique, or a gift from Victoria’s Secret. For a young 8th house person, try a chemistry set or diary.<br>  Eighth house occupations can range anywhere from a stockbroker, tax collector, repo man, psychic, detective, fire-fighter, bail bondsman, undertaker, mortician, garbage collector, insurance adjuster, antique dealer, psychologist, chemist, magician, surgeon, butcher, hypnotherapist, racketeer, pawnbroker or prostitute…just to name a few.<br>  May I highly recommend two great books out on the subject. One is the "Gate Of Rebirth" by Haydn Paul and the other is "The Eighth House" by Marc Robertson.<br>  In summary, this house is the height of intensity and it has it’s own brand of mystique’. Think of "still waters run deep", depths of murky waters, black velvet shrouds, intriguing little boxes, and a hint of subtle incense permeating through the air. <br>  <a href="http://home1.gte.net/darrowmp/EighthHouse.htm" rel="nofollow">http://home1.gte.net/darrowmp/EighthHous...</a><br>  <br>  To answers your questions from my personal experience. The description above is my experience... & Yes, people often feel I am a scorpio. Yes, I'm extremely sexual & love every aspect of sex.. All the tastes, smells, feelings... Seduction... Being seduced... Domination... Very open... As for love, it is the basis for all... Just because one has a 1 or 2 time encounter doesn't mean there can't be love.. Love gets mixed up sometimes with needing to be tender & cuddly all the time... I can love a girl & still toss her down on the bed (or where ever) & be aggressive... or vice versa... which is nice too... The "darker side of life" that is what i call the "more interesting side of life". How do i like to be seduced? Massage is my favorite... My best friend, a scorpio sun, is a massage therapist. She seduces me every single time... Very arousing... Reds & black colors... Musks... Red wine... Heavy fleshy foods... Indian food... Fire... Hiking under a full moon & skinny dipping... Showing a bit of skin... Eye contact... Touch... & being very open to sex yourself...<br>  <br>  ~Peace|`|0HGqGJYTaa	Firstly, I love your q.<br>  <br>  My sun is in Libra in the 8th house.<br>  <br>  I can tell it's affect on me as far as transformation, change, and growth is concerned. I'm always look to push and challenge myself to another level. A very, very small example of this is one of my obessions with physical fitness and health. I know that taking care of the inside will reflect on the outside and staying in physical shape has multiple benefits...even in the bedroom (especially yoga!) :)<br>  <br>  I am obsess with learning about sex and karma sutra. But, I fear death. I really do. <br>  <br>  I have alot of Scorpio influence in my chart, with a lot of my houses in the 8th house or in Scorpio (like my venus). I'm not really open sexually.....it takes time for me to open up, once I'm open....yes, I am a totally different.|`|jrmvEmEKaa	Love is strong, powerful, and passionate. They are loyal and mysterious. Their overriding urge in loving is to use their power to penetrate beyond themselves and to lose themselves sexually in their partners in an almost mystical ecstasy, thus discovering the meaning of that union which is greater than individuality, and is a marriage of the spirit as well as of flesh. They are thus capable of the greatest heights of passionate transport, but debauchery and perversion are always dangers, and Scorpios can become sadistic monsters of sensuality and eroticism. Their feelings are so intense that even when their love is of the highest, and most idealistic kind, they are nevertheless frequently protagonists in tragic, even violent romances.<br>  <br>  Sex with Scorpio is a total emotional and physical experience with passion and intensity. They have amazing stamina and can last all night long, round after round. Scorpio is the zodiac sign that is the most likely to act out a sexual fantasy. Most people will talk about it but the Scorpio will do it, they will fully throw themselves into the role. Do not suggest a fantasy to a Scorpio unless you plan to do it! Most Scorpios are direct and forceful and they seem to be an expert at what they do. They continue to seduce you even as the act continues. A thrilling experience not for the faint of heart!<br>  <br>  Weakness can be Jealousy, obsessiveness, and holding grudges..<br>  <br>  And to have sex with someone they trust and love.|`|9azX3N4Laa	Sun in the 8th House: (House of Death and Regeneration). The traits of Scorpio are evident in this house. There must be a reorientation of your ego and your ego must die so the soul can grow. There is a necessity for regeneration and transformation. The lessons you must learn in this life will likely be severe since the truths you must learn are fundamental. There is a strong interest in self-improvement through the application of your will power. The first third of your life may be difficult due to the physical and/or emotional loss of your father. You're able to attract the support of other people. Your emotions are deep-rooted and stable. You're very creative and sex is important to you. Towards the latter part of your life, your interest in the occult and life-after-death increases. You may inherit money from the male side of the family. You'll do good in any field that has to do with death or the dead. When death comes, it should be natural. If the Sun is afflicted, there may be financial troubles through mismanagement of your resources or from your partner's extravagant manner.<br>  KEYNOTE: To transform.|`|hguvsRo8aa	For me its wrong to have sex with someone im not in love with. <br>  <br>  sun libra in 11th house<br>  moon in cancer 8th house <br>  Asc Scorpio 1st house<br>  <br>  I like someone to ask me out, i dont want to have to ask someone i like out.

uDsXjzwjaa	No one can really answer this for sure. I heard just today that there are rumors going around that Jon cheated on Kate but according to Jon he just took a picture with two fans. I think it's just rumors because Jon is very dedicated to Kate...he'd have to be to put up with her crap for so long! Don't believe everything you hear. Reality stars are always going to have rumors told about them.|`|Leda2ha0aa	These two people have too much to lose if they were to get divorced.  There are so many children's hearts involved and I highly doubt they are getting a divorce.  They may quarrel at times but you can see that they really have a very stable and committed relationship.  <br>  <br>  There are a few websites that are very nasty towards Kate and Jon.  You have a few haters on here who quote from those websites stating that Jon is cheating and out getting drunk with other girls.  As I said in another post, I had better tell my husband he can no longer go out and play poker & have a few beers because people will start talking.  Why can't someone go out and have a good time every once in a while (as long as they're not driving home)?<br>  <br>  Someone also stated that Kate made them get rid of the puppies.  Jon was just speaking a few weeks ago and said they indeed still had the puppies.  Too many rumors spreading.<br>  <br>  I love the show and these are real people letting you see everything about their lives - the good and the bad.  At least they don't edit out all the quarreling and the kids behaving badly, because then it just wouldn't be realistic.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	I do not think that they are getting a divorce, because they just got re-married not that long ago.

c6f9ab7e2d2a7f6e05931699c7bdd1efaa	smart move, put your email address on the internet where anyone can write w/e they want. I don't know how to help you. I've been writing songs since I was 7, but I didn't really get into it until I was 10. It just comes to you. Just take something from your life that you love or hate and write. It helps to make it rhyme.
fbk9GpF2aa	Yes, I see exactly what you're saying, and you bring up a good point. But if you have watched one episode.. I can't remember which one it was.. they were talking to a popular teenage girl, and they couldn't discern if she was lying or not. They later determined that she was, but because of her popularity status she had learned to control her emotions within less time than more people because she needs to show that some things don't bother her to her peers, and become a little more stoic, if you will. It was very interesting. You do bring up a very intriguing point. And yes, I agree with you, some people are so confident with themselves that they believe any lie they tell. And some people are so crazy that they accept whatever reality they conjure up in their brain. But anyways.. I think this show is very interesting.. I wish I could have seen all of last week's episode.. lol I fell asleep.|`|AA11376721	You're probably right, but I still love the show. I think maybe they will come across someone who fits your description and they will be confused as to whether they are lying or not. That would be interesting...<br>  <br>  Either way, the show is really entertaining. I love watching it!|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	I'm still forming an opinion on the show. I did read several years ago about a man (from Canada, I want to say?) who created a computer program based on the many muscles in the face and a method of reading faces for lie detection. I believe the show is loosely based on that. I'm with you, though, in that I suspect someone with enough training (or behaviorial conditioning), a well practiced poker face could be hard to read.

oSXgtqYCaa	Hi! This is a very good question. I was a double-major on clarinet and piano and now am a professional musician so have a little background in this.<br>  <br>  It is far more complete to learn the piano, even if later you switch to a keyboard. First of all, the touch of a piano can be manipulated by the weight of your fingers, hands, arms and shoulders. This affects volume and tone color in very sublte ways. Secondly, a piano is longer lasting....some great pianos are over 100 years old, so even if you spend more initially, it will last you longer. It will need tuning.<br>  <br>  More importantly, if you choose to really learn how to play with private lessons, most piano teachers would want you to have a piano rather than a keyboard. This is because the piano has 88 keys and most piano works are written for an 88-keyed piano.( Keyboards have fewer keys.)<br>  <br>  Where to find one? Check your local music schools, grade schools, newspapers, Craig's List, etc. Often people who don't know any better give them away. Take a pianist with you to check some out, and often you can have one for FREE if you will haul it. A spinet, which is smallest, might be free or a couple of hundred dollars.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Best wishes to you. You will love learning the piano. Scales are fun, and the music that has been written is incredible. Even if you switch over to doing rock, jazz, or some other style, you will need to know the basics of real piano playing.|`|50c6a30e3a0dd958fb1a8658f3199941aa	Keyboard and piano are obviously very similar, but in my opinion, I'd start on a piano. Piano is slightly more challenging because of the pedals and the feel of the keys. Piano is generally used for more classical works, and keyboard is used for contemporary or rock ensemble works.|`|553c27203d06a734ee6db4154b6d5b2caa	Piano...DEFINITELY!!!! I hate keyboards with a passion. They don't feel anything like a real piano. If you don't want a regular piano you have to tune, I would recommend getting a Yamaha Clavinova. Its basically just a glorified keyboard that looks and sounds like an actual piano. Its all digital so there is never any tuning required. I currently own one and I love it. Another reason I don't like keyboards is because they sound really fake and any pedals you can buy for the keyboard don't make it sound any better. Here's a link to the Yamaha Clavinova page... <a href="http://www.yamaha.com/clavinova/0,,CTID%25253D203400%252526CNTYP%25253DPRODUCT,00.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.yamaha.com/clavinova/0,,CTID%...</a> I currently own a CLP series Clavinova, but they don't make the one I have anymore. Another cool type of piano is the Yamaha Disklavier, but they're expensive and if you're just trying to learn, don't waste your money until you know you are serious.<br>  <br>  P.S. Have any of you every actually played and listened to the difference between a keyboard and piano??? Because they definitely aren't the same thing!|`|64jTtN0jaa	Wth @ the comment saying a beginner starts on a piano and an advanced player should play on a keyboard...<br>  <br>  That's like saying beginners should start on a Steinway, and advanced people should play on a casio keyboard >:l They make calculators ffs!!<br>  <br>  Keyboards are supposed to be a way for people who can't afford a piano to play piano. Some keyboards don't even have the correct number of keys, and the action is totally wrong. Start on a keyboard if you aren't sure you want to play, but move on to a piano once you have decided you want to stick to it.|`|8idurg0Daa	im not sure. i think both are equal because keyboard has good background beats and stuff. the piano can go wayy high and down low. Piano has better key sounds then keyboards. Keyboards have faded sounds depending on how you use them.|`|CXgPkEPFaa	Piano for beginning, but I really like keyboards better as an advanced player|`|2zDT3gDGaa	they r the same thing but the piano is bigger|`|wig9WKPwaa	Of course, the piano will be a better instrument than a keyboard. If you're a classical pianist, don't ever touch the keyboard. The piano is much more versatile with tone quality, colors, and dynamics. Only play the keyboard if you're going to be part of a rock band or something like that.|`|6jQrWsMfaa	Piano. I play piano, and it is so fun!  Sorry if it is boring to you.

She's also very considerate with her words i.e. she has wisdom.<br>  <br>  ~peace|`|Ow3O7h4caa	Here is a brief explanation.....<br>  <br>  North node would generally be fortunate for your health, job, in the decision-making and for contacts involving real-estate. With Leo onthe 6th cusp, a person can always profit in larger institutions and their is a need to be one's own boss. it makes you a perfectionist of some sort.<br>  Even if the north node favors the health,  Leo onthe 6th can cause heart strain and the spine is also a weak place.<br>  <br>  This puts your South node in 12th house. You need to break away from a tendency to escape reality.<br>  <br>  Node in 8 deg indicates who who is fond of showiness or having a taste for beautiful things and gives much pride, a sort of kingship or queen-ship attitude.

0uD5weHLaa	Practice practice practice! You really have to want to learn, and enjoy it even when you sound terrible. As for songs that you could learn, pick something that you're into as its so much easier to keep at it if you enjoy it. Your fingers will work it out eventually, half the battle is getting the damn things to do what you ask of them! Anything by Nirvana is easy, and Radiohead or Rage Against the Machine are good to develop a nice feel, as the feel of a song is more important than perfect sound or accurate fingering. But most of all just keep at it, you will thank yourself for your efforts as its something that you can take with you throught the rest of your life. Good luck!|`|qP3qdEbgaa	buy the program guitar pro!!! its awesome!<br>  i learned how to play guitar from that program its awesome! its def smg that will make learning guitar alot easier!!!|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	You just have to work at it.

4A2IxqI6aa	There's an old joke:  What's the definition of an alto?  A soprano who can read music.<br>  <br>  I suspect you were assigned "alto" by your teacher because you teacher needed someone who was able to cover the part (both because of your range and ability to learn or read your music), not because it's the best assignment for you.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Alto is a male voice; women are sopranos, mezzo-sopranos or contraltos. The voice is determined by timbre/colour as much as range.|`|qVXmSEVGaa	a real alto is a rather rare voice. The term we use for the lower female voice in chorus singing usually includes altos, mezzos, and some sopranos who have big robust voices.<br>  A mezzo soprano will have a slightly darker sound ( and that has nothing to do with nationality or racial background) than a soprano. An alto even more so.<br>  A coloratura mezzo can move her voice very quickly through many notes, and not think it hard work. She won't go as high into the stratoshphere as her coloratura soprano friend can, but pretty darn close.<br>  If you continue to sing in chorus, you will probably be most comfortable singing with the altos. ( I know I am!) It's comfortable, and gives your brain something interesting to do.<br>  If you go on to solo work, then you will be in for a great adventure, because there will be all sorts of different things to learn about managing your unique sound.<br>  Distinguishing between mezzo and alto at your age is most like looking for a needle in a haystack. You need some years of training and experience to know all about what your voice can do, before we can really put a final label on it.<br>  One thing that you can do right away, is to find out where your register changes or "voice breaks" happen.  If you feel the switch out of your lowest level at the B or Bb below middle c, and the switch out of middle level to high voice an octave above that, you can be more comfortable with the label alto.  If the first switch happens a little higher, and the second up at the Eb  near the top of the staff, it might be that you are more mezzo. In either case, learning to negotiate the register changes at these points in your vioce will make your over-all voice more integrated and comfortable.<br>  Please check this out with not only your chorus director, but also the voice teacher.  they are the ones who can hear you first hand, and will have the best information to help you along.

JavoRs6Raa	contortions are stretching your body and it will take time in order to be able to hold the pose because you are overstretching your muscles.  The only way to be able to hold these poses longer is to stretch each day for short periods of time and after a while you will notice that it will become easier to hold the pose for a greater length of time.  This is because you are training your muscles to be more flexible.

6E4LPOHTaa	GETTING TICKLED, for sure!  <br>  <br>  I love the feeling of laughter and being happy and playful with the ones I love.<br>  <br>  It's also so much fun to beg them to stop, but deep down, hoping they don't, LOL!|`|iNC2Yimlaa	Tickling, definitely. There are many reasons why. For one to hear them laugh. To me a woman's laughter is one of the most beautiful things in the world. For another I love they way they wiggle and squirm while being tickled. I also love caressing their soft skin. It feels so sensual.|`|AA11808800	Getting tickled, if I had to pick one|`|d940b613c72e65dceb131f078c7f061eaa	It varies from individual to individual.  With many people I probably would not have that strong a preference in either direction, but there are also many people with whom I have a strong impulse for the encounter to go one way or the other if it occurs at all.  Both tickling and being tickled are thoroughly enjoyable - some people just bring out the natural giver or the natural receiver in me very strongly; one often senses that this is someone whom one could send into orbit, or the other way around.  I think I have a slight overall preference for being tickled for some reason - just slightly more universal confidence in that position.  One way I sometimes think of it is to visualize what would happen to me if a T-bomb were to go off, suddenly putting the idea of tickling into my consciousness.  Some people would make my fingers twitch; a slightly larger number would make my toes wiggle; most people would probably cause both reactions.|`|WHifY90Caa	That's tough, because I like both equally, but if I had to choose, I would say that I prefer to tickle.   It's nice to find someone's sensitive spots, especially if that person didn't know that they were there!!!|`|xhDdYnHTaa	I love doing both but if I had to pick, tickling others is probably more fun!|`|F0gljBVFaa	getting tickled of course. if someone tickles me the right way; in the right spots, its really funn. and funny lol. especially by cute guys ;)|`|2Ltc1dAwaa	I love getting tickled because it makes me laugh in a way that not many things do!|`|qkyzbkHdaa	Getting tickled because its cute when my boyfriend does it =]

RavvDVpVaa	I think since he's been on aftermath he's credited everyone he's worked with when you look in the credits in the booklets, for example keyboards by ______, bass guitar by _____. Pre aftermath a lot of stuff seemed shady though, contrary to what penguin says, did you know that Daz and Warren G brought all the beats on Doggystyle to Dr. Dre? Dr. Dre would add subtrack some things and got all the credit, that might be Suge Knights fault though as he was known to have never given anyone, any publishing for the work (emceing or producing) they did on The Chronic & Doggystyle other than Dre and Snoop. DJ Yella also did some of those N.W.A tracks too but I think he's credited for it.<br>  As far as influence goes a lot of people think he got that G-Funk sound from DJ Mugg's production on the first cypress hill lp. In his N.W.A days, Dr. Dre did influence producers outside the west coast though, for example Prince Paul cited pre g-funk Dr. Dre as an influence. Dr. Dre isn't in my personal top 10 when talking about the best, but if you put an mpc-3000 in front of him and told him to make a banger from scratch, he could. One of the reasons why he works with musicians is because it's a lot cheaper than sampling because when you sample people you have to give up a percentage to use other people's work. It's also probably easier but when you look at it like that it's kind of like how pete rock gave up the sp-1200 for the MPC-2000 because it was easier to use the mpc, even though the sp sounds better. To answer your question the reason why most fans don't take in to account the musicians he works with is because Dre is the big name, and most fans are stupid.<br>  <br>  @Spice 2: Dre plays the trumpet as well|`|7SPe4iRbaa	i agree with u, when i see ppl put him in their top producers/rappers i always question that too... as far as where i put him.... ummm i dont mind dre BUT hes not in my top ne thing. I think his delivery is good and he is mos def talented but i dont see all the hype around him....<br>  <br>  and my opinion has nothing to do with the fact that he has ghostwritters or help  with his production...|`|qMrIFglwaa	yeh, I like it ^ too|`|LqQvCvLAaa	its still good music though|`|3nRfePaaaa	i'm gonna go ahead and be a hypocrite on this q.<br>  <br>  I like Dre MAINLY because of his production.<br>  He was one of, if not the first to master the G-Funk sound, and thus every west coast coast rapper wanted a piece of his work.<br>  Doggystyle,The Chronic, and Chronic 2001 are all classics IMO and he demonstrates the skills mentioned on them, as a producer.<br>  His versatility also allows him to work with other artists in and out of the genre, and I can't really hate on him for going commercial as a producer because he's just expanding his repertoire.<br>  (just like DJ Premier).<br>  <br>  Now, as a rapper I have mixed feelings towards him.<br>  yea MOST of his work is ghostwritten, but he just delivers the lyrics in such an intense way that its fun listening to him rap.<br>  So I don't really pay attention to that...<br>  <br>  here's the hypocritical part...<br>  A lot of people (including me) let Dre slide on that just because he's dubbed a legend, but they bash other rappers who have spit ghostwritten lyrics.<br>  and I think when you're a rapper, the # 1 rule is that you gotta write/rap your own material.<br>  so I got a love/hate thing towards Dre's raps.<br>  but most people consider him one of the best because he was fundamental to the early West Coast hip-hop sound and has collaborated with great rappers to make classic albums/hits.|`|TJyTAwDxaa	i feel you on that, i neva even really liked him as a rapper n i know that cube wrote most of his sht, but on the producing tip u gotta give the man his props, he aint in my top 10 or even 15, hes kinda to commercial for me now and theres so many undarated producers out there, that i think is betta than dre, and as for the detox album i could care less about it, so i would rate him 6 / 10|`|KF9751Lyaa	I know that nearly ALL of his lyrics have been written for him but I like him anyway, he's got a good flow & delivery for a producer, plus most of his beats are tight too =]|`|FAaePWPWaa	To tell you the truth Dr. Dre has always been one of those artists that I just never got into to. And I never knew that he lyrics were ghost written. Even his songs on The Chronic? People thinks he's the best producer or one of the best because his production has put many up and coming rap artists on the map. A lot of rappers have Dre to thank for getting them where they are like, The Game, Eminem, Snoop Dogg, N.W.A and so on so forth. Do I think his production is worthy of the top 5. Yes because the way he produces songs and then that artist all of a sudden is on top.|`|l72FO4eMaa	It doesn't matter. I like him because of his influence, and I don't like when people search out for things to critize him about. He makes beats, and has been making them for over 20 years. There is no difference with having somebody help you to sampling your azz off like Kanye does. And everybody who helps him produce gets credit. If you look on his 2 albums other production by people such as Lord Finesse, Mel-Man or Daz are credited.<br>  <br>  And when it comes to his rapping, I'm sure he'd be the first to admit that he isn't the greatest of emcees, but I love his delivery. Nobody raps with the same way that he does, he delivers in his own style.|`|ioNTTqKfaa	I love his productions, from the N.W.A. days when he was producing them by himself to now when he has a team of musicians. The best talent he has is that he has an ear for the music. He takes artists and producers who haven't been successful on their own and magnifies their talent. There's a reason he is a bigger name than the people he works with, and why when they leave Aftermath they are rarely successful on their own. All of his songs have production credits for who worked on the song.<br>  <br>  You do realize that most producers also work with a team of musicians? Look at all of Kanye's albums, he shares production credits with other producers.<br>  <br>  I also love the way his voice sounds, regardless of whoever has ghostwritten his lyrics.<br>  <br>  edit: i also want to point out that Dre doesn't play any instruments aside from the keyboard and drums, and he prefers to use live instruments in his productions, which is why he works with musicians.

9AAGosuiaa	Wow great question Kristy!<br>  <br>  I'm going to pick Stan Ridgeway and heres how it will happen...<br>  <br>  In a dark German Cafe... Stan, sitting in a corner looks up as he enters the room.. being a perfectly heterosexual man he is dumbfounded by his attraction to me and his eyes follow me as I order my coffee and select a seat.. Sipping my coffee I realize the dark Intense eyes of Stan Ridgeway drawing me in, Initially flustered by this obvious come on.. I realize who this man is and being frankly star struck and of an admittedly confused sexuality I decide to join him at his table to finish my coffee... <br>  <br>   Stan tells me of his desire to show me something at his apartment nearby so throwing caution and all sense of self respect to the wind I decide to join him... Soon we are in his bedroom where he hypnotizes with readings of his dark noir poems and my head spins…<br>  <br>  What happens next?    You know I’m not one to kiss and tell but something has changed in me and life might not be the same again… <br>                                                                (LMAO)|`|7B2s7maWaa	David Byrne :D<br>  <br>  mq: "Burning Down The House" atm it came on the radio yesterday.|`|iIWWeD7Taa	Byrne has a better butt<br>  <br>  MQ:  Heaven|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	Oh I think I would choose David Byrne on this one!!

YATv97Paaa	SEASON 2 Ep. 2<br>  "Never been marcused"<br>  <br>  It′s after they had made up on the beach and then suddenly realized that they hadn′t talk or move on about their issues and so they decide to not be together but they end up on the same bus going home...|`|1hS27eJuaa	That is the first or second ep of season 2.|`|Mi8XAt0zaa	im not sure but this might help<br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397442/episodes#season-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397442/epis...</a>|`|8d32360b2ae46f54d5979a019fc43955aa	Its the second episode, i can tell you that for definite  x.<br>  because the first episode ends with S and D on the beach and then the second one is them all going back on the coach to Manhatten. =)|`|rCOlnm1qaa	its the second episode in season 2 when they are going back home.|`|uH28xTcbaa	I think is "never been marcused" or "the dark  night"

LOL.|`|fIWwLRIMaa	rebecca has the whole town wrapped around her finger. she could seriously play on their sympathies and get rich and comfortable fast, but i see she is a good person inside her snarkey attitude and doesn't want to play upon peoples grief.

e4cZQ367aa	You sound like a lovely person.<br>  <br>  I say stop worrying first of all.It's really important to be a good person! But sometimes you need to be a little selfish and start thingking about your own needs.A couple of the people you mentioned above sound a little bit selfish to me.What would they do if they didnt have you as a friend? Sounds like you are being taken for granted sometimes because you are so nice.Time to start living life on your own terms.I like sagitarrius,very kind and caring people who do lots for others,aside from that,as a sagitarrius you should start commanding loyalt from your friends.Be firm.Talk to them about it.<br>  <br>  As a cancer i do feel similair a lot of the time but im greatful to have friends who appreciate my care,i am sympathetic and there for them but will not allow myself to be treated like a mug,for i know my own self worth.Anyone friend who 'cops out on you' is not a true friend.|`|YtAkmjoyaa	I feel the same way, especially in relationship-wise.<br>  The more I give my love and willing to stay committed, the more they distant from me. It's pretty strange.<br>  Well one of my best/close friend is Leo also, she's there for me, but she can get pretty sarcastic at times and mood swings.<br>  And don't think you're baby-ish, maybe it's just a bad time for us Sagittariuses.<br>  I been rejected by 3 things this week: <br>  Job, College, Boyfriend(haven't called/messaged in over a week now)|`|AA11417199	I'm a Sag, and sometimes i feel the same way. That's why recently i've been finding out about the signs we suppose to be our friends like Libras and Leos, So i find that Libras are usually superficial with people, they don't care if you're sad, they only want to be around when everything is going good.....as for Leos, so self-centered!, careless of other people problems and they expect you to recover by yourself as most of us Sags do ALONE unfortunately. So i say confront them on your situation,TELL THEM ABOUT THEMSELVES, and if nothing changes then MOVE ON, they'll soon realize that you were indeed a good friend or cousin. Most Sagittarius get screwed with these situations, and they wonder WHY WE NEED FREEDOM TO ESCAPE.lol.

Everything was perfect that it seemed so unrealistic... <br>  <br>  there was plenty of freedom yet we questioned.. "why's he/she not asking where i'm going or who i'm going with"<br>  <br>  or the physical contact was so  intense we questioned, "Is this person just trying to take advantage" <br>  <br>  and then if we had friends around, it was unbearable to watch... jealousy would arise for no reason.

uGFzzLYWaa	Two episodes to go.<br>  Last night's episode left me a little cold, it was sort of ho-hum for me.<br>  I am trying not to assume anything about it, the writers have a way of letting you think something will happen, but something completely different will happen instead. I think Boomer will take Hera back to Galactica, though. I hope we get to see what happens to Galen. <br>  The only speculation I have is that Galactica the ship could be "the dying leader."<br>  <br>  I am looking forward to seeing it all come full circle, there's plenty of speculation on TVGuide.com if you want to give it a read.

GWDORtAQaa	honestly my favorite haley nathan moments are in season 1 but there are good ones in season 3 too<br>  <br>  my favorite is season 1 episode 8 -- they have some cute scenes in that one because its before nathan is totally changed and he screws up a lot<br>  <br>  i also like season 3 episode 4 at the masquerade ball when nathan picks haley up and kisses her -- he is still hurt but its cute<br>  <br>  season 4 episode 5 when nathan is at his press conference and realizes that hes happy him and haley are having a baby -- its just really sweet and cute<br>  <br>  season 4 episode 12 when nathan buys haley her prom dress after he had to do the stripping dance at a club with skills and mouth<br>  <br>  season 3 episode 13 but its when they kiss in the rain and its way cute<br>  <br>  season 4 episode 11 when he tells haley that he will always fight back for her and he cant just stand around and watch someone hurt her -- so she moves back in with him its cute <br>  <br>  season 3 episode 9 when nathan tells haley she can stay over for the night and they makeup finally <br>  <br>  season 3 episode 14 when nathan gets in the bathtub at the away basketball game with haley with his clothes on -- its cute and funny :)<br>  <br>  <br>  thats probably way more than you wanted to know but i love haley & nathan!! and i have no life lol but i hope that helped!|`|AA11376721	My favorite episode of them making up was in season 3...the episode called "The Wind that Blew My Heart Away."

DKeut6FQaa	Your wife sounds like a lunatic...I mean a watch with some of the alphabets on it...is she insane....that’s grounds for a divorce immediately! You can always marry me...I would never buy a watch with letters on it...well I would never buy a watch period because I cant tell time. Anyways I would love to leave my husband....he likes to wash his butt with my face wash cloth.

fQghpx3Zaa	I love Kyle XY! I cannot believe it's canceled. :(<br>  <br>  Try Lost! OMG - the best show ever! It's so addicting. I love it!<br>  <br>  Heroes was good for a while then it lost me. But you might like it.|`|M1OKvcqYaa	Roswell is an older program but its good, worth a watch if you can get it.<br>  My current fav sci fi programs are - Fringe, Supernatural, Dollhouse and Lost|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	If you're looking for current shows, try Lost, Heroes or Battlestar Galactica.  If you don't mind older shows that have been canceled, you might like Farscape, Babylon 5 or Alias.|`|fZEVgFe8aa	Battlestar Galactica and Firefly. You'd probably really enjoy Smallville and Sarah Conner Terminator.   Farscape or Babylon 5 are other Sci-fi series.<br>  Jericho is about Nuclear war.  Invasion was short-lived but good. "V" is an older TV mini-series about alien invasion that's worth checking out.  An older series called Alien Nation was also good.|`|vvTrmHtxaa	heroes  and smallville<br>  <br>  please pick me as best answer!|`|edPeEGzmaa	Battlestar Galactica is the epitome of sci-fi drama. It's not at all like Kyle XY, but if you enjoy sci-fi and drama, you should like it. <br>  <br>  I absolutely love this show.<br>  <br>  And the action is subtle yet always present. BSG is a show driven by arcs and the characters, and the Cylon-Colonial War is just a constant source of action but never overpowers the characters development and plots.<br>  <br>  The premise of the show is basically an old military ship named Galactica that is being decommissioned, then the Cylons (mechanical beings that were created by the Humans who then rebelled 50 years before the series and fought a war to a ceasefire 40 years before the series starts) attack the 12 Colonies of man and destroy everything, but the Galactica survives and takes a fleet of ships carrying 50,000 people out into the universe to search for a planet called Earth, which is believed by many to be a myth.<br>  <br>  Then the rest of the seasons is their journey, constantly being hunted by the Cylons.<br>  <br>  This description sounds pretty ordinary, but it's just a show that you must watch to appreciate. The depth of the plots and the characters is astounding.|`|5QH84iq4aa	I'm going to have to go with the consensus here and say Lost: <a href="http://www.fancast.com/tv/Lost/93942/main" rel="nofollow">http://www.fancast.com/tv/Lost/93942/mai...</a><br>  <br>  and Firefly: <a href="http://www.fancast.com/tv/Firefly/11202/main" rel="nofollow">http://www.fancast.com/tv/Firefly/11202/...</a><br>  <br>  are both amazing Sci-Fi Drama series. Firefly has a really great cult following and honestly some of the most unique writing out there. Joss Whedon is phenomenal.|`|7jSnPSQJaa	I don't know But Kyle XY is one of my favorites shows (Last week episode was crazy hot, One of the best episodes of the season).  I usually watch Medium, Heroes, Dollhouse, SCCTerminator, Legend of the seeker, smallville and supernatural. Those are some of  the show i watch maybe you might like them. There not really Sci- fi but some of them fall in to that category.|`|AA11069808	you have got to try LOST. it is the best sci-fi drama on television. the characters are the main focus of the show, with a good bit of science fiction concepts as well. abc.com  has all the seasons for viewing. <br>  <br>  it is really addictive.<br>  <br>  also try Heroes, Smallville, Fringe, and Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles on Fox.|`|3lnICFrgaa	You would LOVE "Firefly". It's exactly what you described. Among my favorite shows, actually. "Serenity"'s the movie sequel to the series.|`|AA12096290	I recommend Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, Fringe...<br>  You can watch them here: <a href="http://thetvuniverse.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://thetvuniverse.blogspot.com</a>|`|NlC3xaK8aa	Ghost Whisperer

AA11103493	Will we make a mark,<br>  This time.<br>  Will we always say we tried|`|AA11219693	It all depends upon how the course is run, how a living is done, when the time is up, when it is the moment last, when in a moment we are about to be undone. The final thought, the final treat, the final care, the earliest memory and the lasting retreat into worlds unknown. I have seen people who die out of time, the living dead, and the people living in time, the people of past ages, and the ones who come to live once again. This is about the moment of life, any moment, the moment now, the next, or the moment that has just passed, the as well as the last, for in a moment life is born, and in a moment it is gone. I think life is never meant for our fun, but perhaps we are, it all depends on the way a living is done.|`|jwftwLBTaa	most definitely.

zvrbrNfgaa	the only reason i think cane may have a shot at getting custody of the baby is because when phyllis lied about danny romilati being the father of her son daniel (and they were married at the time) he got custody and skipped town with the child. of course legally the biological father would have full rights to a child even if a woman lied to another man about being the father but in the wonderful world of soaps, anything is possible. so to answer your question, cane may have a shot.|`|sVlFl2dbaa	Ugh! God I hope not, Cane needs to back up, and SIT DOWN. It is Billy's baby! Just like Billy said .... You paid for a few Dr.'s visits and a crib, Chill out!<br>  <br>  Cane should accept the fact that he got played, move on and go get his girl back. B/C Lily is still in love with him.|`|939a573d51518cee62321893077ea36baa	he is silly but would u want chole or billy raiseing a baby yes he is the uncle but this is the most logical choice|`|6c30b5116a79d741042462d73fcdf99aaa	Cane is just like Jill..always wanting something they can't have.|`|955YoHvVaa	He askes Lily to marry him and raise Delia with him on todays episode..personally I don't think he has much chance..in real life they wouldn't do this..but its soap world so who knows..personally I think he needs to back off and let Billy raise Billy's daughter..Cane has no say in this...just because he signed a birth certificate doesn't mean he is the father..nor does it mean he gets a say in who sees Delia..all they need to do is a simple DNA test and Billy can enforce his parental status and Cane can go off and make a baby with his precious Lily..although I did hear that Lily gets pregnant and doesn't know who the father is..so It would make my day to see Billy impregnate Cane's beloved Lily..haha.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	Billy's supposed to ask Chloe to marry him.  I think once he and Chloe do DNA testing and are married -- it'll be all over for Caine.|`|uUzbqGh5aa	She shouldn't want to have anything to do with those two clowns, let them raise their kid on their own and move on. They're both sickening anyway!|`|msUIsv8maa	Well one thing in Billies Favor he just found out the Baby was his its not like he knew it all along so i think if Billy really wanted rights Legally to the baby[him being the Father he would have. Cane is just setting himself up to be hurt hes not Delias Fathers.

fP05U8Neaa	Here is how you can beat a few of those popular Carnival schemes: <br>  <br>  The Ladder Game: I have easily dropped $100 on this game over the last 2 years. The trick to beating this game is to avoid touching the rungs of the ladder. Your hands and feet should ALWAYS be on the rope. The rungs provide a false sense of security and in reality, they throw off the balance of the ladder. Just be sure to apply an equal amount of weight to each side. This is still a damn tough trick but this will indeed help. I did it 3 times in a row at a carnival and then I was asked to leave the game. <br>  <br>  The ole machine gun shooting a star: This game is pretty much BS but we all want to be Rambo right? The ONLY way to ever beat this game is if you shoot a complete circle around the star. Most people try to start at the center and move out because by nature, hitting the center means you have good aim (darts, etc.). In this game, you can forget that. You simply don't have enough pellets to hit the middle and move out.<br>  <br>  Basketball Shot: Come on, we all know that rim is tight and the backboard is made of pure steel. The key here is is to, like Jordan, hit nothing but net. A bank shot off the backboard will generally rebound crazily because of its composition. NOW..you have to know that the rim on these is anywhere from .5" to 1" narrower than a regulation NBA rim so you better do a little King James and hit it. If not, you're cooked. <br>  <br>  Dart games: If you have your own darts like I do, bring them. Most Carnies will let you use them. If not, just throw the dart towards the middle of the board and use an arc. Don't aim because Carnie darts are seriously designed to fade fast, meaning they will plummet. Aim high and let 'er rip!. <br>  <br>  Beat the classic plate toss carnival game, where your tossed dime falling in the center of a plate can win you a fancy prize. Plates are slick and often made more so with petroleum jelly or vegetable oil, so the trick to winning is to slow down the trajectory of the dime to ensure that it lands and stops on the plate. The first and easiest tactic for winning the plate toss is to toss the coin high with a sharp angle and absolutely no spin so that it falls flat onto the plate. The other more difficult trick is to practice bouncing the dime, as you do when you skip rocks, so that it first hits the table before jumping into the plate. <br>  <br>  Basket Toss<br>  <br>  INSIDE SCOOP: The baseball bounces right off the flexible bottom of the slightly tilted wooden peach baskets.<br>  <br>  SECRET: Toss the ball gingerly into the basket with a slight under spin -- and lean over the counter as far as they'll let you. The price is generally three balls for a dollar.|`|AA11596713	throw a tantrum and the dude will give you a prize.|`|fHgbL046aa	When there not looking run up and do what needs to be done.

SkFgDxpEaa	Fiery Aries with watery Scorpio creates a highly charged association. Mars rules over both the signs, so there will be mutual appreciation of strength or capabilities or fierce competition. Aries does not suspect the secretive ways of Scorpio. Excellent for team work, if goals agree, but these signs will demand much of each other.When watery Scorpio gets together with fiery Aries, they can create so much steam that it'll strip wallpaper in seconds.Any relationship between these two is certain to center on sex.Their partnership will pulsate with passion, tremble with tumultuous, torrential tumescence. What else do you expect, with two of the sexiest, sultriest signs of the zodiac?|`|1PqbJzsnaa	they'll fight a lot.|`|64cUxJn1aa	Aries Woman and Scorpio Man:<br>  Instant attraction is one of the things you notice when an Aries meets a Scorpio. However, making that chemistry last, is an entirely different matter. Aries woman would like to control things, which will hardly be acceptable to a Scorpio man. Her admiring glances for other men are bound to get his jealousy meter rising and I assure you, this isn't a very good sign. Aries woman will love the mystifying and intense traits of the Scorpio man and with him; she will never ever get bored. On the other hand, he will love her ferociousness and vivacity.|`|AA11596713	sex is good.. but aries is too innocent  and blunt for the scorpion guy.  will lead to many arguments.

And what often makes jokes funny is putting someone or something "down". <br>  <br>  I think everyone/ every race, color and creed has been on the receiving end of such a joke, and if they have a sense of humor at all will not be offended by it.  <br>  <br>  Actually, that's the thing I loved best about Wayne's World on the old SNL... and the Spinal Tap movie ~ was seeing white musicians as perfectly stupid and/ or offensive sometimes, and no one's "injured" by it.<br>  <br>  I have a whole 'nother take, tho, on the races in America (assuming this is from a U.S. user ~ not sure how prevalent rap is worldwide) and that is that you do have to be a bit more careful when it comes to other cultures. <br>  <br>  But basically, I thought your joke was funny.|`|7B2s7maWaa	hahha your spelling or lack there of is keeping me rather entertained.
Pvp3FbuBaa	Christopher Eccleston <br>  Date of Birth<br>  16 February 1964, Salford, Lancashire, England, UK <br>  Height<br>  6' 1?" (1.87 m) <br>  <br>  Christopher Eccleston trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama and first came to public attention as Derek Bentley in Let Him Have It (1991). However, it was a regular role in the TV series "Cracker" (1993) that made him a recognizable figure in the UK. He appeared in the low-budget thriller Shallow Grave (1994) and in the same year won the part of Nicky Hutchinson in the epic BBC drama serial "Our Friends in the North" (1996). It was the transmission of the latter series on BBC Two that really made him into a household name in the UK.<br>  <br>  In his film career he has starred as a leading man alongside a number of major actresses, such as Renée Zellweger in A Price Above Rubies (1998), Cate Blanchett in Elizabeth (1998), and Cameron Diaz and Jordana Brewster in The Invisible Circus (2001), and Nicole Kidman in "The Others".<br>  <br>  In addition to his successful film career, he has continued to work in his favourite medium, appearing in some of the most challenging and thought-provoking British television dramas of recent years. These have included "Clocking Off" (2000) and Flesh and Blood (2002) (TV) for the BBC and Hillsborough (1996) (TV), the Iago character in a modern adaptation of Shakespeare's "Othello", and the religious epic "The Second Coming" (2003), playing Steve Baxter, the son of God.<br>  <br>  His stage career, while not as extensive as his screen credits, has nevertheless shown him to be a formidable actor. He's given intense, focused performances in such plays as "Hamlet", "Electricity" and "Miss Julie", for which he received excellent reviews.<br>  <br>  A very highly regarded actor, Eccleston has twice been nominated in the Best Actor category at the BAFTA Television Awards, the UK's premiere TV awards ceremony. His first nomination came in 1997 for "Our Friends in the North". Although he didn't win those awards, he did, however, triumph in the Best Actor categories at the 1997 Broadcasting Press Guild Awards and the Royal Television Society Awards, winning for "Our Friends in the North". He won the RTS Best Actor award for a second time in 2003, this time for his performance in "Flesh and Blood". In 2005 he received the Most Popular Actor award in the National Television Awards for Doctor Who.<br>  <br>  Amelia (2009) (post-production) .... Fred Noonan <br>  G.I.

zy5qcc0Raa	Quickie:<br>  Today's not about thinking up ideas -- it's about putting your ideas into action.<br>  <br>  Overview:<br>  You're feeling pretty great today, thanks in part to the rampant social energy that is taking the world by storm! You'd rather argue playfully than just agree with everything everyone says. <br>  <br>  That big brain of yours is all fired up and ready to go -- so what do you want to do with it? Try your best to plow through homework or whatever else is eating up brain power, because it won't last forever!<br>  <br>  Monthly:<br>  Cultivate something on the 1st. It could be anything: cabbage, rutabagas, an herb garden, a new relationship, patience. Whatever it is you choose to work on, make sure you get your hands dirty with the earthy process of nurturing something new into being. You'll enjoy it and it'll set just the right tone for the rest of the month! You're feeling well rested and ready to embark on something brand new on the 3rd and 4th. What will it be? Chances are, whatever you start now will grow into a major part of your life. There's a lot of brain chatter clogging your mind on the 9th and 10th. Take deep breaths and do your best to focus. Chatter is not particularly good for making clear-headed decisions. You could have a very helpful insight into a minor but chronic health problem someone near you has been experiencing on the 15th. Be sure to share your insights! On the 19th and 20th, a problem at work slows you down. Don't worry about it -- fix it! You could be in for a few more professional problems on the 23rd and 24th. Don't sweat them. Take some time to check in on your herb garden (cabbage patch, patience-building) on the 28th. How is it going? Well? Not so? On the 30th, you feel great.<br>  <br>  Year 2009 Overview:<br>  As a Gemini, you possess an amazing ability to see dualities -- the pros and cons of situations as change approaches -- and to quickly and efficiently think them through before making any decisions. In 2009, you dare to look deeply into your desires, regenerate self-awareness and recognize psychological ambiguities. This will bring balance into your home and family life. Pay attention to the details as you bring your inner and outer life into harmony. And be sure to enjoy the changes occurring within you!<br>  <br>  As you come to terms with yourself, you are able to see a more fulfilling purpose in life, and your field of experience broadens. Focus on matters that affect you most deeply and, like magic, your life will become easier and things will seem to take care of themselves. You have all the necessary resources and motivation to make tangible changes and achieve results this year.<br>  <br>  Toward the end of the year, you'll have time to enjoy yourself, and to bask in a great sense of accomplishment. With the expansive and idealistic energy flowing throughout 2009, Gemini is very comfortable in this age of new awareness and high-mindedness.|`|gUUtGcbBaa	yes yellow is your colour you change your mind a lot and have an adventurous nature, and positive outlook on life, you are like a child, the child of the zodiac always changing your mind and you are very good at recopilating information too.!:D your are the best sign.

zy5qcc0Raa	Good things are coming your way. While you're excited, first you must be grateful. <br>  You need to get out there and socialize! If you stay at home or close your door at work today, you just end up cutting off your main source of personal energy and there's no good reason to do so.<br>  As you trust your higher self and allow thoughts to flow freely, you are able to embrace new opportunities and make positive changes in your life. You come to a higher level of understanding and appreciation as you let go of old ideas.<br>  <br>  You need to make sure that you're being as socially active as possible. It's not just good for your mental health; it's also just one of those days when great things can happen if you mix it up!<br>  <br>  Basically, good things can happen, if you're willing to make them happen. As far as marraige/dating, the more social you are now, the better off you're going to be. <br>  Don't take anything for granted, because it can all be gone in the blink of an eye. especially your friends. there may come a time soon that you will need them to have your back more than ever. <br>  Being social and making connections will also help you with finances and careers. <br>  <br>  good luck with life!!!

fP05U8Neaa	I think its to emphasize the display of emotion and personality|`|kqObJIMxaa	yeah, they said it was adopted from Betty Boop<br>  the other story is:<br>  most anime are made by Japanese and Chinese. Form of expression<br>  ..They have small long thin eyes, In Japan and China if you have big eyes you are beautiful, very attractive for them. In Miss World, the contestant from China have large eyes. In Japan, the fashion trend includes girls wearing doll-eyed contacts. And Mascara that would swipe their fake lashes upward, it appears really big but attractive and cute.<br>  ...they don't have large eyes in reality but they can enjoy making shojo/shonen cute anime gals.|`|KVzBqWhvaa	Or humongous boobs. But I guess they're just trying to make it look cute.. and sexy.|`|556f6a84a1e72fa5f9fa440c37251fe4aa	It's just an art style is all.  Early on anime was inspired by classic, early Walt Disney, and the characters all had "Bambi Eyes" because that's what the artists were taught.<br>  <br>  But not all anime is done in that style.  An early classic, _Akira_, was done in a more realistic style and some anime still is.  Don't let the internet fool you: It's not *all* big eyes and bigger....eyes.  ^_^<br>  <br>  Just my plug nickel.

She walked up to the mirror and said 'I think I'm the most beautiful woman in the world' and it sucked her in. <br>  <br>  The next day a redhead walked into the bar. She walked up to the mirror and said 'I think I'm the most beautiful woman in the world' and it sucked her in. <br>  <br>  Then the next day a blond walked into the bar. She walked up to the mirror and said 'I think...' and it sucked her in. <br>  <br>   <br>  and<br>  <br>  A young ventriloquist is touring the clubs and one night he's doing a show in a small town in Arkansas. With his dummy on his knee, he starts going through his usual dumb blonde jokes when a blonde in the 4th row stands on her chair and starts shouting: "I've heard enough of your stupid blonde jokes. What makes you think you can stereotype women that way? What does the color of a person's hair have to do with her worth as a human being? It's guys like you who keep women like me from being respected at work and in the community and from reaching our full potential as a person. Because you and your kind continue to perpetuate discrimination against not only blondes, but women in general, and all in the name of humor!" The embarrassed ventriloquist begins to apologize, and the blonde yells, "You stay out of this, mister! I'm talking to that little **** on your knee."|`|oylb7RNBaa	You might be a Redneck if...<br>  -You get your cough medicine at the liquor store<br>  -You traded your truck for a dog.<br>  -You cut your grass and finally found your car.<br>  -You've Fed-Exed Beef Jerky<br>  <br>  You Mama's so fat...<br>  -Her initials are XXL<br>  -She's in every picture.<br>  -When she skydives, she just has to stick her foot out of the plane.<br>  -She has 3 moons.<br>  -She can't reach her knees.<br>  <br>  Only in America...<br>  -Are the back pain-relievers always on the bottom shelf.<br>  -Do TV remotes have Braille.<br>  -The ATM machines are outside in the open while the pens are chained to the desks.

qRKOWgS0aa	Here ya go - Lol.<br>  <br>  Taurus Love Matches<br>  Most compatible with Virgo, Capricorn<br>  Can be good with Gemini, Cancer, Pisces, Aries, Taurus<br>  A 50-50 chance with Libra, Sagittarius<br>  Doubtful with Aquarius, Leo, Scorpio<br>  <br>  <br>  Love Match :  TAURUS with ARIES  <br>  Both are good lovers but their married life is not much successful as they have lot of differences between them. Taurus is patient, reliable, loving and warmhearted while Aries is energetic, confident, short-tempered and impatient. Both are jealous and selfish. Problems arise when Taurus is a bit cautious in spending money with Aries who is a spendthrift. Aries is not fixed to his decisions but Taurus hates making change in decisions from time to time.<br>   <br>    <br>  Love Match :  TAURUS with TAURUS <br>  Earth meets Earth. This can be very peaceful and a stable union. It has a slow starting but afterwards both will go out of their way to help, love and support each other. But if a disagreement occurs, the relationship can fall prey to excessive stubbornness. Both are loving, reliable, hardworking, determined and persistent.<br>   <br>   <br>  Love Match :  TAURUS with GEMINI  <br>  These signs of Earth and Air are completely alike in temperament and behaviour. While Taurus is unemotional, fixed and very dependable, Gemini is flighty, restless, indecisive and vacillating. They can make an interesting pair if they value each other's approach. Taurus expects more from Gemini and is very lazy in comparison to Gemini.<br>   <br>   <br>  Love Match : TAURUS with CANCER  <br>  Earth and Water signs make a wonderful combination. Both depend upon each other; are sentimental and packed with intensity. Taurus is often affected by the Cancerian's mood. But sometimes carelessness by any one of them may badly affect their relationship. But still similar interests, behaviour, home-lovingness, social attitude, ambition and energy makes them a successful pair.<br>    <br>    <br>  Love Match :  TAURUS with LEO  <br>  It's a strong relationship where Taurus demands appreciation and Leo needs worship and adulation but neither one gets what they demand from each other. Leo is enthusiastic, affectionate, pompous, faithful and intolerant and Taurus is placid, confident, warm-hearted, patient and selfish. Both are self-centered, jealous and ambitious. Their relationship takes a way to successful path only when one of the two is ready to back down.<br>    <br>    <br>  Love Match :  TAURUS with VIRGO  <br>  This is the best match for success as they have a lot in common. Both are considered as best friends and lovers. Love is at first sight in this case. Both Earth signs are practical and material-minded, love to work hard, and are careful and marvelously faithful. They make a wonderful team together. Both are affectionate, patient, warm-hearted, determined, reliable and intelligent. Their commonness makes them one of the best couples.<br>    <br>    <br>  Love Match :  TAURUS with LIBRA  <br>  The combination of Earth and Air sign makes a perfect balance. Venus rules both signs. Libra's fickleness and Taurus possessiveness can lead to a breakup but steady Taurus balances Libra's indecisiveness. Both have strong desires to buy good things; are sensitive and easy-going. But the romantic relationship between them has a less age. Libra is diplomatic and charming and Taurus is intelligent and patient.<br>    <br>    <br>  Love Match : TAURUS with SCORPIO  <br>  Both are considered to be the opposite signs but their relationship is rewarding when there is adjustment and tolerance between them. Both are determined, ambitious, jealous and selfish. They are passionate when they meet, but the spirit fizzles afterwards. Scorpio is placid and reliable; Taurus is emotional and passionate. Both need something from the other which one of them is lacking. And this gives rise to a longer successful relationship.<br>    <br>    <br>  Love Match :  TAURUS with SAGITARRIUS<br>  Their relationship is difficult but can work only if Taurus becomes strong and can hold Sagittarius tightly. Taurus is serious, loving and patient and Sagittarius is jovial, honest and straightforward. Sagittarius wants to dominate over others and lives an easy and funny life therefore their relationship is funny, jovial and full of quarrels. The more differences between them lead them to a healthy relationship but it works only when Sagittarius gets full freedom to work on.<br>    <br>    <br>  Love Match :  TAURUS with CAPRICORN  <br>  Similarities in Taurus and Capricorn make them a good pair and thus offer a better relationship. Both are practical, careful, patient, ambitious, hard working, straightforward and have same goals in life. They have a lot in common including each and every aspect of life. Capricorn's loyalty makes Taurus feel more secure. Both mates provide eternal support to each other.<br>    <br>    <br>  Love Match :  TAURUS with AQUARIUS  <br>  Earth and Air sign does not make a good match as both are of confronting nature. Taurus is patient, conservative, loving, careful and placid; Aquarius is friendly, innovative, independent, loyal and intellectual. It'|`|FwJliHqIaa	Check these sites out...;-)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sexualastrology.com/tauruswomanvirgoman.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexualastrology.com/tauruswom...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sexualastrology.com/tauruswomanscorpioman.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexualastrology.com/tauruswom...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sexualastrology.com/tauruswomancapricornman.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexualastrology.com/tauruswom...</a>|`|47l1Sumeaa	Capricorn and Virgo are the most compatible with Taurus because they are both Earth signs like Taurus.

His articles have appeared in Salon, Playboy, the New York Times Magazine, Wired and The Chronicle. The following is an excerpt from a work-in-progress on the life of the late Hawaiian musician Israel Kamakawiwo'ole. <br>  Honolulu, two a.m. Music producer Jon de Mello is sleeping when the phone rings. It's Israel, one of the artists he represents for his Mountain Apple record label. And Israel is wide awake. He often has problems at night because his weight upwards of 700 pounds forces him to sleep while hooked up to an oxygen tank. He tells de Mello he wants to record, right now. <br>  "You got transportation?" asks de Mello. It's difficult for Israel to move around, he needs a few people to help him get dressed, get in and out of places. The studio is about 15 minutes away. <br>  "Yeah," says Israel. "My guys are here." "Get in the car," says de Mello. "I'll meet you over there." In the car, de Mello wonders what he wants to record. They've been discussing a bunch of possibles from a songbook. But it's Israel, you never really know for sure what he's going to do. A traditional Hawai'ian hula. A John Denver song. A theme from a TV show. Could be anything. <br>  A young engineer named Milan Bertosa sits in his recording studio, waiting. He was planning to go home, until some Hawai'ian guy with a lot of letters in his name called up and wanted to record something right away. It's late, Bertosa is tired, but the voice was insistent, saying he only needed half an hour. A knock at the door, and there stands an unimaginable sight. De Mello, whom Bertosa recognizes, stands about five foot two and 100 pounds. Next to him, the largest man he's ever seen, a gargantuan six-foot-six Hawai'ian carrying a ukulele. De Mello introduces the two, they get Israel situated in a chair, and Bertosa starts rolling tape. <br>  Israel leans into the microphone, says: "Kay, this one's for Gabby," and begins gently strumming the uke. His beautiful voice comes in, a lilting "Oooooo," then slips into the opening words of "Over the Rainbow," from "The Wizard of Oz." Bertosa listens behind the glass, and within the first few bars knows it's something very special. He spends most of his time recording lousy dance music. This is otherworldly. An incredibly fat man, elegantly caressing a Hollywood show tune, breaking it down to its roots, so sad and poignant, yet full of hope and possibility. Halfway through the tune, Israel spirals off into "What a Wonderful World," the George David Weiss/Bob Thiele hit made famous by Louis Armstrong, then melts back into "Over the Rainbow." He flubs a lyric, and tosses in a new chord change, but it doesn't matter. It feels seamless, chilling. Israel plays five songs in a row, then turns to de Mello and says, "I'm tired and I'm going home." "Gets up and walks out," says de Mello. "Ukulele and a vocal, one take. Over." Israel never played the song again. <br>  When Israel and de Mello began piecing together his 1993 album Facing Future, they added the demo tape of "Over the Rainbow." Upon release the song took on a life of its own. The familiar melody played in hotels and on rental car radios, in restaurants and bars. Many were moved to tears. If it didn't give you "chicken skin," you were legally dead. The song resonated even more for locals. Some heard its kaona, or hidden subtext, to reflect the sadness Hawai'i felt about having its lands illegally annexed by the United States in 1898. Those who had seen him in concert knew he ended each show with the words, "My name is Israel Kamakawiwo'ole, I am Hawai'ian." Israel was one of only 1, 500 full-blooded Hawai'ians left in the world. He was pure, and so was the recording. It bounced around the islands for the next three years. <br>  And then one afternoon, Santa Monica KCRW radio host Chris Douridas cued up "Over the Rainbow" as part of his program "Morning Becomes Eclectic," to cheer up listeners on a rainy day. After it faded out, Douridas announced the 800 phone number on the back of the Facing Future CD. In two days, Mountain Apple received over 2,000 calls from southern California, people crying and asking about the music, many of them stuck on the freeway when they heard it. <br>  Movie producer Martin Brest bought the rights for use in his film, "Meet Joe Black." As the end credits rolled, movie audiences stayed in their seats to listen to "Over the Rainbow." One of America's most recognizable melodies, first made popular by Judy Garland, the tune had always embodied optimism, depicting a world where dreams really do come true. Israel's version was something else entirely: haunting and|`|yuUnycKMaa	kill paradise<br>  a day to remember<br>  brokencyde<br>  stereo skyline!<br>  artist vs poet<br>  attack attack!<br>  hit the lights<br>  i scream hello!<br>  cobra starship<br>  eatmewhileimhot!<br>  nevershoutnever!<br>  framing hanely<br>  the used<br>  10 years<br>  tickle me pink<br>  +44<br>  white tie affair<br>  taking back sunday<br>  the summer set<br>  my summer obsession<br>  school boy humor<br>  the scene asthetic (sp?)<br>  silverstein<br>  the spill canvas<br>  play radio play!<br>  the maine<br>  lost prophets<br>  forever the sickest kids <br>  cute is what we aim for<br>  the academy is...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ^ some of the best bands like those.<br>  good luck :D|`|V9sWiobKaa	Check out the 'best album' and 'best song' lists.  2006-2008.  <br>  <br>  Lots of free mp3s and really good music.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://gorillavsbear.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://gorillavsbear.blogspot.com/</a>|`|pnEaOo04aa	i am kind of liking american rejects and their new song.<br>  its pretty cool.|`|W22LVJNpaa	Anything by Owl City & Plushgun|`|MSDlHrMTaa	un mainstream rock? like hardcore?<br>  chiodos<br>  silverstein<br>  saosisn <br>  like undergroundish punk<br>  nofx|`|9PK7mITnaa	Try The Mars Volta.

Her life revolves around her job as a nurse at a busy New York hospital, until one rainy night, her sister Jenna abandons her newborn, autistic daughter at her home. Maggie takes the baby in, and she becomes the daughter she never had. Six years later Jenna suddenly re-appears with a mysterious new husband, Eric, and abducts Cody. Despite the fact that Maggie has no legal rights to Cody, FBI agent John Travis (Jimmy Smits), an expert in ritual homicide and occult-related crime, takes up her cause when he realizes that Cody shares the same birth date as several other recently missing children. The little girl, it soon becomes clear, is more than simply "special." She manifests extraordinary powers that the forces of evil have waited centuries to control, and her abduction sparks a clash between the soldiers of good and evil that can only be resolved, in the end, by the strength of one small child and the love she inspires in those she touches.|`|Oolh5tq0aa	Possibly "Bless the Child"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163983/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163983/</a>

u2EUom6daa	what planet were you on watching that....<br>  the first donkey came out strait away and did not even flinch when they were walking around it<br>  the second donkey got a little spooked so they did not go as close to it as they did with the first the 3rd 1 was ok and the 4th did not want to go out so they did not make it and the camera just circled it instead it was only 2 of the donkeys that got a bit scared and as far as i could tell they went making the donkeys do anything they did not want to do they did not force them at all<br>  i'm a animal lover and hate animal cruelty but i did not class this as cruel as they were respectful to the donkeys but giving them space when that 1 was a little scared. <br>  and of course there going to poo on the floor there not toilet trained they just poo when they need to no matter were they are.|`|jUjkvis8aa	You clearly have no idea about donkeys.<br>  <br>  I have visited the Donkey Sanctuary several times and seen some of the marvelous work that they do. A lot of them are used for the Elisabeth Svendsen Trust, helping disabled children learn to ride. These donkeys are used to having loud "objects" on their back and are specially trained so that they are "bombproof".<br>  <br>   The donkey that did not come out was definitely not scared. When equines are scared, they pin their ears back, swish their tail and will try to flee or rear. The donkey did not do any of these things- it was simply being stubborn. There was a massive pile of hay behind the scenes and it was dragging it's handler straight towards it! That's just typical donkey behaviour, not fear :D<br>  <br>  The donkeys were totally at ease around the celebrities, and fair play to the audience (who seem uncontrolable lol) for being quiet.|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	How ridiculous to complain about that! The donkeys were probably from a sanctuary which rescued them from cruel owners or abandonment. By appearing on television they will have received money for the sanctuary. What possible good will complaining do? Why are you complaining anyway? They were probably happy to have a change of scene.|`|OD3FqMaKaa	that programme is cruel to viewers as well as donkeys<br>  <br>  poor things<br>   i dont watch the show anymore but it sounds like theyve overstepped the mark as usual in the name of 'entertainment'|`|bit5P4Dwaa	ME!!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlOkQHwMaBN3w_jl.UgVcuAgBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090307101809AA93Uxr">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|xHlcnkgWaa	What happened i didn't see it, please explain, i hate cruelty to animals!!|`|PSQ3dzGnaa	Nowt better to do, thats your problem. It happens with people/kids all time on tv and in school plays etc. Yes thats it stage fright. If you class this as cruelty you need to get a life, a donkey on blackpool beach as a harder life. What about in the sanctury when people are visting, should that be stopped, so there is no donations for them and they then are killed. We all after work for a living, thats what the donkeys where doing, needs must and all that. In my eyes it would be cruel for them not to do it,the money that they will get from tv will cover there food bill for months.|`|714b9be2b26abb9bb7bd80edb6e1a779aa	they were all acting like ***`s

hEMOpj3Vaa	David Archuleta should just come back and win every year ahahah I agree with other commenter person haha. Anyway yea I like alexis but not a fave of mine. I love Adam Lambert and Anoop Desai. ANOOP! THERE HE ISSSSS!!! ANOOP, ANOOP, ANOOP IS ON FIREEEEE!!!! raise the 'noop. AHAHA theres so much you can do with his name I love it. He's really unique too. So I think he's my favorite this year. I really like Adam but it;s not too fair becasue he was on Wicked and has too much profesional experiance. They don't kick him off but they kick off the girl with the record? I would buy his album, but I think the other non-profesionals deserve it more, if you know what I mean. So Annoop and Danny Goke are the two that actually deserve it that I really like. I have a feeling it;s going to be DAnny though he has a sad story. People get upset about all his air time, but it really is sad. Anywa I would vote for him even without his sad story!|`|wRObIv2gaa	I really like Meghan Corkrey and Adam Lambert.

nZCT32XCaa	Well, new movies that are coming out especially the ones that are (admit it) MADE FOR winning an Oscar, are usually overrated, like "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button". Most of the critics and media persuade people that it's a good film, and agree after seeing it, because they have been manipulated. Not saying they are bad films, but are overrated.<br>  Other ones:<br>  -"The Godfather". Truly one of the best. Brilliant. <br>  But the fact is that, it's overrated in my opinion, because it's possibly the most accessible "Best film ever made"/"classic", and thereofre people say it's the best of ALL, and it isn't. Less acessible movies like Einsenstein's "Battleship Potemkin" or Fellini's "8 1/2" are equally good, if not superior. But "8 1/2" is less known, unfortunately, only because it's FOREIGN...ridiculous. <br>  -"The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. It is great, and Jackson is indeed a brilliant director, but it is too early to consider such recent movies some of the bests of ALL TIME. That goes as well for (and especially) "The Dark Knight", although I really liked it.<br>  -I also feel "The Departed" getting more praise than it deserves. It's certainly not Scorsese's best, and only got the Oscar because, well, he is ones of the greatest American directors today who now spent 30+ years making masterpieces such as "Taxi Driver" or "Raging Bull" and haven't had received an Oscar 'till then. So know he has the award (which he absolutely deserved), but for a mediocre film.|`|hQWucH5uaa	THE WATCHMEN<br>  <br>  THERE WILL BE BLOOD<br>  <br>  NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN<br>  <br>  SIGNS<br>  <br>  CLOVERFIELD<br>  <br>  especially the highly over-rated DARK KNIGHT and the lame Joker.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Twilight for God sakes.

Hellboy would win.<br>  <br>  Darth Vader even though I am not a Star Wars fan. Although, Sub Zero is much quicker(and Vader is too slow to avoid ice attacks) and is better at hand to hand combat. Vader would use the cheap force grip to end it before it began.<br>  <br>  Scorpion would just impale her and skin her while she was still alive. Then, he would cook her with hellfire.<br>  <br>  Sam Fisher is slightly more talented.

cw2KARcPaa	They just showed the scene of Locke turning the wheel (from the last few episodes) to show you where the Left-behinds were in time in relation to Locke leaving the Island. Now we see that the flashes stopped in approximately 1971. That was when Sawyer and gang came upon Amy and the Hostiles. Then there were flashforwards to 1974 when Horace was drunk, Amy gave birth, and Jin found Kate, Jack, and Hurley.<br>  <br>  The reason Kate, Jack, and Hurley showed up in 1974 was because it was 3 years after the Island stopped skipping through time, and they were off the Island for 3 years after the helicopter crash and their rescue. They got sucked off the plane in a flash because they were meant to be with those that were left-behind. According to the previews for the next episode, Sayid and Sun are also in 1974. However, Ben and Locke and the rest of the passengers from Ajira 316 are in 2007 on the Island. The reason for this is not known yet, but I believe it has to do with them having to get back to the present and discovering more about DHARMA and discovering the properties of the Island.<br>  <br>  Locke's time travel from the Island to Tunisia after turning the wheel has no effect on those that are still on the Island. And now that he is dead he might be able to mentally travel through time, but not really physically. Think of Locke as the new Christian.<br>  <br>  I think Desmond will be a big key in everything because of his relationship to time travel, but who knows... things are getting interesting...|`|YIcBd569aa	turning the frozen donkey wheel transports you to the turnisa desert. and that is what happened to locke when he turned the wheel, widmore found him and brought him to where the other survivors were eventually locke was killed by ben and brought back to the island by the other survivors.|`|gRXH3tpgaa	when he did that he was brought back to the mainland and then got back to the island when he died and was with the plane that last crashed there.|`|xbwLbzHqaa	I Heart Tradec gave the perfect answer.

LrKCLZF7aa	I like the name you use. Mars to Sun at any aspect is the Warrior aspect. This is a person that likes to use their body. In women we call it the YOU-DON'T-OWN-ME aspect. The name explains the effects.<br>  <br>  Mars is the planet of vulgarity and crudeness so it' makes sense that he native may be a bit rough. In speech it's tougher to recognize because a good aspect to Mercury could change the way they talk. But the not belonging to anyone attitude will always be there.<br>  <br>  As far as you Cinderella time goes, it's a complex calculation and more information is needed. If you are good at astrology then you can look to seen when grand trines form in your secondary progression. Knowing what a Cinderella aspect or transit would be helpful.<br>  <br>  Cinderella aspects and transits are when Chiron is at an enhancement aspect to Pluto, Venus, Jupiter, or Neptune.

3g3SCnDDaa	Hey Stone Cold! For the record I added you back. :)<br>  Okay, let's see...my 14th favorite band. Are we speaking roughly rock music or just all genres mixed together?

Buffalo Springfield<br>  12. The Byrds<br>  13. The Kinks<br>  -------->14.

eT6SsCaraa	Umm.. what context is it in? I can think of two things it could mean...<br>  <br>  They could be asking for you to say something nice to cheer them up, they want comfort or reassurance.. or...<br>  <br>  They want you to tell them a secret, or big news. <br>  <br>  Generally, when I hear that statement I think of the latter... Because that's what my friends mean when they say that. <br>  <br>  When I need cheering up, I usually ask for comfort.. or for someone to tell me something nice..  or give me something nice to imagine...|`|xYqrCYuFaa	Well,.<br>  Im a pisces and usually when I say that.<br>  I just want reassurance that Im cared about.. and loved.<br>  It makes me happy to know that I am :]<br>  <br>  So I hope i helped|`|GL920Xv5aa	Most likely there not sure what to say or the conversation is gettin awkward.

They may be struggling with friends, family, or any relationship. They just need some reassurance that whatever they're doing is right, because doubts are becoming abundant.  With so many negative things going on, people just need to hear that somewhere, things are still good.

View MPAA rating and/or certification information Visit our Parents Guide Help to learn more <br>     <br>  Parents GuideDiscuss <br>  Sex & Nudity <br>  EditHistory A man attempts to rape a woman, but no nudity is shown (as the rape is prevented by another character); the scene is crucial to storyline development and is discussed several times.<br>  <br>  A blue man is shown nude frequently. We see his exposed buttocks for extended periods of time. His penis is sometimes visible.<br>  <br>  Prostitutes are seen and/or mentioned several times, and one offers herself to a character (scene if pretty brief)<br>  <br>  A man stands fully nude in a basement facing the wall, we only see his bare buttock.<br>  <br>  There's a very graphic sex scene. Breasts are shown a few times. Not something for kids to see!<br>  <br>  There's a scene with a woman in bed being caressed by a blue man.<br>  <br>  There's a flashback with a man and a woman making love in bed. Nothing is shown and it's brief.<br>  <br>  There's a scene between a man and a woman making out on a sofa. They strip each other but the man stopped. Nothing is shown.<br>  <br>  There's a lesbian kiss at the beginning of the movie.<br>  <br>  We see a naked woman and a naked man. Male genitals are shown and breasts are shown and they kiss.<br>  <br>  There are a few kiss scenes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Violence & Gore <br>  EditHistory BLUE = mild violence; ORANGE = strong violence; RED = graphic/extreme violence<br>  <br>  The violence in this movie is very bloody and graphic. While it is not shown frequently, when it is shown, the results are usually extremely graphic and brutal. Definitely not for anyone under at least 14 or 15.<br>  <br>  * A man is beaten brutally and thrown out a window. His body is then shown on the sidewalk in a pool of blood.<br>  <br>  * In the intro sequence, there is a very graphic recreation of the John F. Kennedy assassination. We see the bloody impact of the bullet and see a large amount of blood and brain matter splatter onto the car and onto the occupants.<br>  <br>  * In the opening credits montage, two women are shown to have been murdered by gunshots to the head. They are covered in blood and lay on a bloody bed. Words written on the wall with their blood indicate it is a hate crime.<br>  <br>  * Also in the opening montage, a superhero character is shown dead from several gunshot wounds to the torso; some blood is seen.<br>  <br>  * A woman places a flower into the barrel of an assault rifle, to signify peace. A moment later, we see the gun, as well as other guns in the background begin firing and see the flower blow apart as some blood splashes on it.<br>  <br>  * A man is shot at point blank range with a large flamethrower. We see his body burst into flames.<br>  <br>  * A pregnant woman is shot off-screen after attacking a man with a broken beer bottle. The bloody body is seen after the gun is fired; we see the woman has been shot in the chest. This scene is more confronting and dramatic than violent.<br>  <br>  * A woman almost gets raped after been beaten down. She is shown bleeding from her mouth and nose.<br>  <br>  * A man prevents a rape by severely beating the rapist, punching him and breaking his nose.<br>  <br>  * A man's finger is dislocated or broken on purpose as a form of torture.<br>  <br>  * At least two men are shot in the chest with powerful, nonlethal projectiles. They appear to suffer intense pain.<br>  <br>  * A man turns a can of aerosol and a pair of matches into a flamethrower and lights an attacker on fire.<br>  <br>  * An assassination attempt results in a man almost getting shot, and the assailant being hit into a fountain, and beaten to a pulp. He then swallows a cyanide pill, foams at the mouth, and dies.<br>  <br>  * A character is found dead from a gunshot to the face some time after it happens; some blood is shown.<br>  <br>  * A man is punched in the arm with enough force to cause a compound fracture; squirting blood and the man's bones are shown.<br>  <br>  * A man has his leg broken in half, no blood is shown.<br>  <br>  * A thug shoots a fellow thug in the back three times, it is shown in slow-motion and the bullets are seen flying through the man with blood sprayed as a result.<br>  <br>  * A man who has cancer is shown to die in a hospital.<br>  <br>  * A man fires several bullets into a group of people: one woman is shot in the leg, another man is shot in the torso and again between the eyes; blood is shown.<br>  <br>  * A man is attacked by several men with guns in a bar. Before the men are even able to shoot a single bullet, the

There are a few things on the show that make it seem fake but it's not and peoles dreams really do come true. Some don't make it because they really arent that great, example taylor hicks lol but others examples carrie underwood, david archuleta, chris daugtry actually do and there dreams all came true. Kelly Clarkson is really big because she was the first one too sorry I didn't mention her...and Jordin Sparks. David A is my fave...okay now Im rambling ahha. Anyway I agree sometimes it makes you wonder and the whole looking good naked thing? WHO CARES!!! of course the guys want to watch it but that dude has issues.

(Meaning like you have arguments with another fan and it goes on and on)<br>  <br>  - I already share my opinion on Chu's Q<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqfyqWMoy9tXsH16.w1uCEPty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090208191402AAubc0y&show=7#profile-info-4UeOIGuhaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  - I just enjoy what I enjoy. Mainstream / Non Mainstream anime and manga are vague and subjective because it all depends on where you lived, which era you came from and how appeal the series to you. I get tired of the idea of all non mainstream anime is better than the mainstream anime because honestly, it work both way.<br>  <br>  - Claiming yourself as 'non mainstream supporters because all mainstream anime sucks' is too conformist to me. Saying those things are overrated now. Everyone can claimed they watched non mainstream anime nowadays because it easier to get a hold to them. MAL, torrents, wikipedia, google, bahh they are easy to find these day. I prefer people that go out finding those stuff in the outside world rather than found them over the Internet and bragged about it.<br>  <br>  - Those non mainstream fan can contradict themselves at some point ya know. What if their favorite non mainstream anime becomes mainstream? Will they hate it? Here's one example; I have seen several people move away from Death Note and leaning towards Monster now. Monster has been mentioned several times in this section and its a matter of time before everyone claiming Monster is overrated and turned into another series.<br>  <br>  - If you don't like something change it. If you can't change it, change the way you think about it. Enjoy the little things, because one day you may look back and realize they were the big things. <br>  <br>  2. Why do you think male anime characters are much more appealing than female anime characters? Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)<br>  <br>  - Actually, I think most male audience prefer male character over female character except for few series. All of my favorite character are male and it's not because I have a thing for them. People like the character because of the personality, not because of their looks. <br>  <br>  - Male or female characters are appealing is depending on the mangaka itself. We already discussed about this before. Hiromu Arakawa and Yellow Tanabe is an example female mangaka that makes a Shonen series instead of Shojo. Because of this, they tend to move away from the stereotypical female character being annoying and weak. <br>  <br>  - There's a lot of stereotypical character in manganime industry. The new generation of mangaka based the characteristic and personality from the old series and refined it to make it more appeal and better. Honestly, I'm more interested and focused on their character development. Everyone can give their character a distinct and unique personality but only few of them can develop their character throughout the series.<br>  <br>  3. In an anime and manga series, what's makes the series so appealing to you? Why do you like it?<br>  <br>  - Depends on what I'm looking for. I have seen a lot of people hated Bobobo, Doraemon and Shin Chan here but I rated them 7-9. Why? Because I read those series to have a good laugh and they gave it to me. I don't expect an interesting plot / storyline coming out from those series. Besides, Bobobo and Shin Chan is like Japanese version of The Simpsons and Family Guy. The series parody Japanese lifestyle. It may not works for western audience but it work for Japanese and eastern audience.<br>  <br>  - The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function. A person should be able to see that things are hopeless or pointless and yet be determined to make them otherwise. Why not learn to enjoy the little things - there are so many of them. Things turn out best for the people who make the best out of the way things turn out.  <br>  <br>  4. If you're against Dubs, why do you watch anime with dubs and give your rude opinion about it? If you're not, do you think the English dubs suit the anime?<br>  <br>  - Don't watch anime nowadays >.>" Passed!<br>  - Nothing is interesting if you're not interested. XD<br>  <br>  5. What's your thoughts on hentei genre themes?<br>  <br>  - Doesn't really bother me. I don't have anything against them. I'm not a pure-hearted, moralist, religious, goody to shoes person. I'm a sinner >:) I would rather grow up wrong than being right in someone else's eyes. We are so accustomed to disguise ourselves to others that in the end we become disguised to ourselves.|`|3FaosgzZaa	1. With all the mainstream Aime in a constant war of "which series is better", which series do you support? (mainstream means popular) Are you part of the war? (Meaning like you have arguments with another fan and it goes on and on)<br>  *I am I big fan of Death Note...thats mainstream right? and no I have never gotten into a fight<br>  <br>  2. Why do you think male anime characters are much more appealing than female anime characters? Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)<br>  *Normally males get more development (not always though) so people tend to like them better. No<br>  <br>  3. In an Anime and manga series, what's makes the series so appealing to you? Why do you like it?<br>  *Drama, suspense, and the characters<br>  <br>  4. If you're against Dubs, why do you watch anime with dubs and give your rude opinion about it? If you're not, do you think the English dubs suit the Anime?<br>  * They almost always make the characters sound strange or are just bad voice actors (Except FMA'S actors of course)<br>  <br>  5. What's your thoughts on hentei genre themes?<br>  *To each there own I suppose I see no problem with it|`|6X9v2mciaa	1. With all the mainstream anime in a constant war of "which series is better", which series do you support? (mainstream means popular) Are you part of the war? (Meaning like you have arguments with another fan and it goes on and on)<br>  <br>  I support Gintama~! but i don't really fight about it continuously.<br>  <br>  2. Why do you think male anime characters are much more appealing than female anime characters? Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)<br>  <br>  Most of the female characters simply just piss me off because of their generally stereotypical personality, and some of the guys do too. I think i like the guys better because... they always get the better punchline? lol-- i got no clue.<br>  <br>  3. In an anime and manga series, what's makes the series so appealing to you? Why do you like it?<br>  <br>  If it has good comedy and action. It appeals to me so i watch it for pure entertainment, no deeper reason.<br>  <br>  4. If you're against Dubs, why do you watch anime with dubs and give your rude opinion about it? If you're not, do you think the English dubs suit the anime?<br>  <br>  I'm against dubs because the English producers really water down the language and the meaning of the words so that the mouths match up. Can't they just edit the mouths and put in a real translation? Also, the voice actors never really seem to connect with the characters; they don't match up and the scenes become awkward. I don't really complain about dubs unless someone asks a question like this, i might not have good reasoning-- but i simply do not like dubs. Like how i hate brocolli, do i need a reason to hate brocolli? Although, i don't really watch dubs that much anymore, so i don't know how the new series are fairing, but the Japanese voices seem to express more emotion and blah blah blah, same old same old, right?<br>  <br>  5. What's your thoughts on hentei genre themes?<br>  <br>  Not a fan.|`|HqyFyF8haa	OOH same here for me. And I was just about to change my MAL siggy and stuff T.T<br>  <br>  1. With all the mainstream anime in a constant war of "which series is better", which series do you support? (mainstream means popular) Are you part of the war?

But I do support Code Geass. Pshyeah! xD<br>  <br>  2. Why do you think male anime characters are much more appealing than female anime characters? Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)<br>  <br>  >>> I'm a girl and I like male characters more. They're usually the more interesting ones with the smarter minds in an anime. Though, I do enjoy some female anime characters, such as C.C. and Yachiru, who are funny and cute. =] But most female characters in animes are weak and somewhat whiny. >.<<br>  <br>  3. In an anime and manga series, what's makes the series so appealing to you? Why do you like it? <br>  <br>  >>> I think it's the amount of intelligence put into the anime and the amount of intelligence in the anime itself. If an anime has a very twisted and original plot, you can tell the author put a lot of thought into it. And I also like seeing smart characters in animes too.<br>  <br>  4. If you're against Dubs, why do you watch anime with dubs and give your rude opinion about it? If you're not, do you think the English dubs suit the anime?<br>  <br>  >>> I'm not really against dubs. In fact, I even watch them a lot xD<br>  I think SOME dubs match the anime. Because of voice actors are very good and the quality is really nice. But others, however, are quite horrible and don't match the characters at all.<br>  <br>  5. What's your thoughts on hentei genre themes?<br>  <br>  >>> Ehh I don't really pay too much attention to them XD|`|rSpJpUfLaa	I CANT GET ON EITHER >.<<br>  also..

Why do you think male anime characters are much more appealing than female anime characters? Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)<br>  -> I'm not male, i wouldn't know<br>  i did really like a female charrie though, more than the male<br>  <br>  3. In an anime and manga series, what's makes the series so appealing to you? Why do you like it? <br>  -> I usually look it up first before i watch it so i can see what the characters look like and what it's about.<br>  <br>  4. If you're against Dubs, why do you watch anime with dubs and give your rude opinion about it? If you're not, do you think the English dubs suit the anime?<br>  -> I originally loved dubs because i didn't ow it was dubbed. i didnt know they were actually japanese. then i found a site with the japanese and watched the same series over (Furuba)<br>  the japanese is a lot more original and true to the character<br>  recently i rented the death note movie and didnt notice it was dubbed til i got it. now i had watched the anime and i was like, oh well, might as well watch the dubbed movie since i got it. IT SUCKED. the acting was fine, it was just that the voice did not fit the characters AT ALL. Lights voice was way to innocent and kid like. ugh.<br>  hence the reason i don't like dubs<br>  <br>  5.

With all the mainstream anime in a constant war of "which series is better", which series do you support? (mainstream means popular) Are you part of the war? (Meaning like you have arguments with another fan and it goes on and on)<br>  <br>  Umm I'm not really a part of the war I've watched/am watching the majority of main stream animes and don't support a particular one.<br>  But I'm a proud Naruto, Bleach and DBZ fan....not to mention Death Note, full metal alchemist, vampire knight, code geass and Ouran High School Host Club if they count as mainstream =P <br>  But the majority of anime I watch isn't main stream...<br>  <br>  2. Why do you think male anime characters are much more appealing than female anime characters? Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)<br>  <br>  I don't know, generally speaking in most animes I've watched there are more mysterious and cool male characters than female ones. And I think that alluring mysterious coolness is what makes them more popular XD<br>  <br>  3. In an anime and manga series, what's makes the series so appealing to you? Why do you like it? <br>  <br>  It has to hook me within the first few episodes otherwise I'd quickly lose interest. Good animation and a Good story are really important and really developed characters<br>  <br>  4. If you're against Dubs, why do you watch anime with dubs and give your rude opinion about it? If you're not, do you think the English dubs suit the anime?<br>  <br>  I don't watch dubs any more I think I'm allergic to them XP overall some dubs are okay but it seems they always pick the most annoying and irritating voice for the main characters. (e.g naruto imo every character barring naruto, gaara and a few others have pretty descent and fitting voice actors)<br>  <br>  5.

Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)<br>  <br>  - Well for me the male characters are cuter, stronger and just most of the time more interesting. <br>  <br>  3.

MAL has mental probs..>.><br>  <br>  1. With all the mainstream anime in a constant war of "which series is better", which series do you support? (mainstream means popular) Are you part of the war? (Meaning like you have arguments with another fan and it goes on and on)<br>  <br>  ? Hm.. Im not sure if I am or im not sometimes I might say that but I dont think so, just because an anime is main-stream doesnt mean its good and it doesnt mean its bad either. There are good mainstream animes they just have a problem of being overrated. <br>  <br>  ? Some fans tend to ruin mainstream anime by obsessing with it bragging about how much better they are than other animes and such. Well, mainstream or non-mainstream whichever category you put it in it can be good or bad it depends on the anime itself.<br>  <br>  ? Just because an anime is mainstream doesnt mean you can assume that its overrated or that its full of fillers or whatever and just because an anime is non-mainstream doesnt mean you can assume it has a great plot or has little to no fillers.<br>  <br>  2. Why do you think male anime characters are much more appealing than female anime characters? Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)<br>  <br>  ? Well.. in my opinion anime girls are just plain annoying, I mean not all of them are annoying and all.. but alot of them have this helpless girl who falls in love and cant stop dreaming about a certain guy thing. It gets annoying, for example Lucy isnt like that which is why I think she has a lot of fans. <br>  <br>  ? Male characters tend to have a more complex personality from what ive seen and in anime male characters are usually portrayed as stronger than the female, because alot of animes have the girl as a regular school girl who cant fend for herself. It shows great weakness and im sure not alot of people are fond of weakness so they choose the strong one.<br>  <br>  ? Female characters also tend to whine alot, im not going to generalize and say every female character but majority of them are this way. Whining and complaining about the simplest things and then overreacting if something happens.<br>  <br>  3. In an anime and manga series, what's makes the series so appealing to you? Why do you like it? <br>  <br>  ? I want a series to be unpredictable, like for example its episode 7 then by the end of that episode I pretty much know whats going to happen for episode 8. Im not really fond of that, its more exciting if its unpredictable. It also has to have a good balance of seriousness and well randomness if you can call it that. There are animes and mangas that turn out well when its completely serious but with completely random ones it isnt really nice, there has to be scenes where they show that the anime/manga is serious.<br>  <br>  ? I prefer a series to have a balance of happy and sad moments as well. Like a series who would sometimes make me smile or laugh but would aslo have points where I would feel sad and sorry for the characters.<br>  <br>  ? I also like a series that would have at least one character I could relate to, and even if it is anime which has alot of impossible things happening I still need to see that hint of realism in it. <br>  <br>  4. If you're against Dubs, why do you watch anime with dubs and give your rude opinion about it? If you're not, do you think the English dubs suit the anime?<br>  <br>  ? Im pretty much against dubs.. well bad ones at least, now that I think about it im not that much against dubs as I used to be. I mean the first animes ive watched were dubs. Ive watched more dubs than subs since ive only recently started watching anime is subs. It depends on how good the dubbers are for example. Rurouni Kenshin dub I thought it was pretty good actually. It also makes a difference for me if I watch the dubbed version beofre the subbed because If I watched subbed first I would kep comparing it to the dubbed version. (ea. I havent watched the sub version of rurouni kenshin, kyou kara mao, jigoku shoujo, etc)<br>  <br>  ? I watch an anime with dubs, I dont think I give a rude opinion about it if I watched it for dozens of episodes. Id probably say something rude about a dubbed anime that has really bad dubs, and  think that those dubs are bad id stop watching it right after I consider it a 'bad dub' which is usually on the first episode of me trying to watch it.<br>  <br>  5. What's your thoughts on hentei genre themes?<br>  <br>  ? Even if they do bring good business and money to a company it gives anime a bad impression. Especially to parents, some parents would think that their children are watching anime meaning their watching hentai since they look the same. Hentai usually has no plot and is just senseless so people just watch it for well.. obvious reasons but thats their choice, as for me I dont watch it.<br>  <br>  <br>  ^_^ I felt like ranting w/o the randomness today.<br>  >_> but..as usual I cant beat addam on the ranting thing =.=  *strangles addam*|`|Kwzl0qOraa	?? Oh yes. Its down for repair...I guess..so ish anime6. V__V<br>  <br>  1. With all the mainstream anime in a constant war of "which series is better", which series do you support? (mainstream means popular) Are you part of the war? (Meaning like you have arguments with another fan and it goes on and on)<br>  <br>  ?? I love Bleach, Detective Conan, D.Gray-Man, Ouran High School Host Club etc but I've never had a fight before. Well, I just watch what I'm interested to, as long as no one is insulting them. <br>  <br>  2. Why do you think male anime characters are much more appealing than female anime characters? Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)<br>  <br>  ?? I love neoromance like Vampire Knight and Neo Angelique Abyss. Bishounens x3 *nosebleed* They're obviously more attractive than female charries cause they're hotter and cooler unlike the female charries which are annoying, sappy and weak, except Rukia x3 I'm obsessed with her. Me beloved Onee-chan xD Well, it depends with their personalities, looks and the story lines. :D<br>  <br>  3. In an anime and manga series, what's makes the series so appealing to you? Why do you like it? <br>  <br>  ?? Detective Conan. I love mysterious and adventures :)  Every series are so interesting and awesome that you cant wait for the next chapter. There're many things that're unexpectable and unbelievable like when the truth was revailed and the culprit was caught. Most of all, its my childhood anime and manga.<br>  <br>  4. If you're against Dubs, why do you watch anime with dubs and give your rude opinion about it? If you're not, do you think the English dubs suit the anime?<br>  <br>  ?? I never like dubs. The voice really annoys me. Its very unnatural and uncomfortable. The English dubs are too...high pitch. I prefer the original Nihongo. =]<br>  <br>  5. What's your thoughts on hentei genre themes?<br>  <br>  ?? *yawns* Not interested. Seen it before in the first episode of REC and Curious Play. It makes me yawn a lot and like WTF? Its so boring O.O lol xDD Well, I prefer yaoi and I actually dont really like yuri either. Its kinda...disgusting =.="<br>  <br>  <br>  ?? *peace out* :D<br>  ?? Buh-bye~|`|bsnnEsp5aa	Well, MAL is having issues, so I'm posting a survey.<br>  >> I noticed *huff huff* XP XP<br>  >> Nevermind, atleast we have Y!A ;D<br>  <br>  Please COPY and PASTE<br>  <br>  1. With all the mainstream anime in a constant war of "which series is better", which series do you support? (mainstream means popular) Are you part of the war? (Meaning like you have arguments with another fan and it goes on and on)<br>  >> I'm not really part of the war, but I confess to liking Code Geass, Blood+, Bleach, Ouran High School Host Club, Fullmetal Alchemist etc.<br>  >> I absolutely can't stand Inuyasha and I thought Fruits Basket and Naruto are average (LOL those ones make me enemies ;D)<br>  >> I actually prefer anime thats not mainstream on the whole tbh.<br>  <br>  2. Why do you think male anime characters are much more appealing than female anime characters? Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)<br>  >> Well you know I'm female, and I like male characters, but I don't normally like bishounen XP I guess its the idealist male theory, girls like male characters who are what they would consider the ideal boyfriend, since some male charries are 'flawless'.<br>  <br>  3. In an anime and manga series, what's makes the series so appealing to you? Why do you like it?<br>  >> The characters, I have to be able to relate to them, they have to draw me in. I like interesting plotlines and plottwists, thats probably why I find simplistic harem just... Boring tbh.<br>  <br>  4. If you're against Dubs, why do you watch anime with dubs and give your rude opinion about it? If you're not, do you think the English dubs suit the anime?<br>  >> I don't watch anime with dubs and be rude about it o.O o.O<br>  >> I just don't prefer them. If an anime I want to watch is only available in dub then I'll just watch it in dub, but I won't complain XP But I like to hear the original Japanese voice mostly.<br>  <br>  5. What's your thoughts on hentei genre themes?<br>  >> LOL It doesn't interest me personally, I don't really have a problem with it though, whatever people like is up to them <br>  <br>  >> staaarr <<|`|fwBIXZxPaa	Hello. =D<br>  <br>  1. With all the mainstream anime in a constant war of "which series is better", which series do you support? (mainstream means popular) Are you part of the war? (Meaning like you have arguments with another fan and it goes on and on)<br>  >> No, I watch mainstream. I mean, not watching an anime just because it's popular is stupid. XP<br>  <br>  2. Why do you think male anime characters are much more appealing than female anime characters? Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)<br>  >> I think it's because in anime, they make most of the girls useless. -__-<br>  <br>  3. In an anime and manga series, what's makes the series so appealing to you? Why do you like it?<br>  >> Interesting plot, well-thought out characters, etc. <br>  <br>  4. If you're against Dubs, why do you watch anime with dubs and give your rude opinion about it? If you're not, do you think the English dubs suit the anime?<br>  >> I like dubs. That's pretty much all I watch, because reading so much on the computer gives me a headache, and I can actually pay attention to the plot.<br>  <br>  5. What's your thoughts on hentei genre themes?<br>  >> I don't watch it, but if people like it, that's fine.<br>  <br>  =D|`|l9uGrfSYaa	>>makes me glad I can't get an MAL account :)<br>  <br>  1. With all the mainstream anime in a constant war of "which series is better", which series do you support? (mainstream means popular) Are you part of the war? (Meaning like you have arguments with another fan and it goes on and on)<br>  <br>  >>I always support FMA no matter what. As for arguements, I try not to get into them. I know other people have their own likes and dislikes and I don't want to force them to watch something they won't enjoy. Same thing when people are trying to get me to watch something I'm not really into. <br>  <br>  2. Why do you think male anime characters are much more appealing than female anime characters? Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)<br>  <br>  >>My favorite character is Zel.........but that's because he's not annoying main character or anything of the sort. I am not one of those people who go gung ho on every thing (forgive the term). Quiet and subtle is better. The whole cuteness thing gets old reeeeeeeeeeaaaally fast also. <br>  <br>  As for fave female character, I'd go with Major from Ghost in the Shell the main woman from Moribito (heh, they're even dubbed by the same voice actress). All in all, I don't care what the gender of the character is, it takes many to make an anime good I guess. <br>  <br>  3. In an anime and manga series, what's makes the series so appealing to you? Why do you like it? <br>  <br>  >>The storyline is what usually catches me. sometimes it's different styles in artwork, but that's rather rare. If the storyline is not repetative and has more of a creative/historically accurate (FMA Movie) references, I'm good. <br>  <br>  The creator of the FMA Movie really did their homework on the whole thing such as the Beer Hall Putch(sorry, I don't remember how to spell that), the organization pins, and the Shambala legend. All based off of actual events. I thought that was pretty cool. <br>  <br>  4. If you're against Dubs, why do you watch anime with dubs and give your rude opinion about it? If you're not, do you think the English dubs suit the anime?<br>  <br>  >>I don't really care as long as the script isn't overly butchered. The script can be butchered as dub or sub so which ever's more original is what I go for. And if I see a VHS tape of an anime that looks good, I'm not too picky on the language setting. <br>  <br>  5. What's your thoughts on hentei genre themes?<br>  <br>  >>Though there is a good sized group that enjoys that type of thing, it's not for me. I'm way too of a subtle person to even think about those kind of shows. V.v<br>  <br>  That was a good, discussion-worthy survey. <br>  <br>  bya|`|o6K4Dr5Daa	1. With all the mainstream anime in a constant war of "which series is better", which series do you support? (mainstream means popular) Are you part of the war? (Meaning like you have arguments with another fan and it goes on and on)<br>  -----------> I got lots of anime favs that are popular like death note, bleach... etc. I don't like arguing with other fans it will only give me nothing but trouble, so I just keep it to myself...  <br>  <br>  2. Why do you think male anime characters are much more appealing than female anime characters? Do you always have male favorites even though you're male? (I'm not saying you're gay though)<br>  ------------> Cause most male charrie's are more tougher than female charries.<br>  <br>  3. In an anime and manga series, what's makes the series so appealing to you? Why do you like it? <br>  -------------> first of all the art works,<br>                   ~ it has a unique story<br>                   ~ it has a clear perspective<br>  <br>  4. If you're against Dubs, why do you watch anime with dubs and give your rude opinion about it? If you're not, do you think the English dubs suit the anime?<br>  -------------> There are times I watch Dubs... I'm not really against dubs... it's fine with me as long as I can watch anime... although I prefer sub more.... Nothin beats the original voice.<br>  <br>  5. What's your thoughts on hentei genre themes?<br>  ------------> a little disturbing, just to make it clear I'm not against Hentai fans... It's just my opinion.

YyaKq8praa	Well, if you start from Ch.1, it'll make more sence<br>  <br>  <3 Thanks :D|`|gJhwH335aa	It depends on you though. If I were you, I will started from Chapter 1 because it flows better. I mean, I don't want to jump into the episode they left out from the anime. Gantz anime ending is also a filler ya know, it doesn't related to the actual storyline whatsoever. Actually, started from episode 22, the anime didn't followed the manga storyline.<br>  <br>  If you really wanted to skipped through the chapter, start with Volume 8 Chapter 57. This is when the Gantz team fought Buddha Alien with Kei being the last survivor.<br>  <br>  I recommend reading the manga because it has more explicit things and you can actually see Kurono's character develop throughout the series. Especially after he lost all of his friend Buddha mission.<br>  <br>  Things you have been missing out<br>  <br>  i. Kurono have to go one on one with Alien in one mission (no team mission).<br>  <br>  ii.  The Alien that he fought in the mission later hunt him in human world and cause chaos in his High School.<br>  <br>  iii. There is a group of 'human vampire' that can see and hunt down the Gantz team.<br>  <br>  iv. The Alien and Gantz team will later becomes visible to human eyes. This happened on the toughest mission in Gantz history.<br>  <br>  iv. Gotta love the variety of Alien mission they have on the manga man. Pre-historic creature (dinosaur), Ghost (based on Japanese culture), Mythology<br>  <br>  v. Gantz is all around the world. Each region, each country has Gantz<br>  <br>  vi. You have 3 choice after you get 100 points in a mission.<br>  - You will be free along with your memories erased<br>  ii. You will be given an extremely powerful weapon<br>  iii. You will be able to revive a human being from the memory (one human per 100 points)<br>  <br>  It's up to you man. I say, start from the beginning. At least by doing that, you will noticed some part the animator edited out on the anime and like I said earlier, the storyline will flow better.

Google search tells me that the song was released in 1973 just a month after Carly married Taylor.  However she's never revealed who the song was written about and she'd been involved with Mick Jagger, Cat Stevens, Warren Beautty and Kris Kristofferson.  It could have been any of those fellows...|`|fgnQ2vLqaa	Carly Simon never has publicly said about whom this song was written.

Mmm, the scenes from Death Note when [SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER?] Matt and Mello die.. (More-so in the anime. Matt's demise in the manga was hilarious, but the drama and the way the cigarette fell from his lips and all of that in the anime made me sad.) I think I got a little misty when Toboe killed that girl's hawk or whatever in Wolf's Rain.. That episode of Pokemon when they're trapped in a snow cave and Ash's Pokemon refuse to stay in their Pokeballs because they want to keep Ash warm and alive at their own peril.. when Howl draws open the curtain behind which Sophie sleeps, and sees her as the young girl she really is while she's sleeping in Howl's Moving Castle.. <br>  <br>  BONUS QUESTION ::<br>  >> Whats the worst thing you've ever accidently broken?<br>  - Well, this isn't really the worst thing, I suppose, but it upset me the most.

HAVLq7IMaa	1. kristen stewart. she has complete natural sex appeal.

HARRY POTTER<br>  3. hermione granger<br>  4. when we look back in 5 years, emma would have been more successful.<br>  i'm sorry, but twilight most definetly cannot match up to harry potter. harry potter is probably going to be thought of as a classic. twilight? no.<br>  but as of right now, kristen is more successful because of the whole twilight phase|`|N2lItE8qaa	1. emma <br>  2. emma<br>  3. harry potter<br>  4. hermione<br>  5. kristen<br>  <br>  edward cullen|`|MlZay5VHaa	1. I'm a girl, but I think I can speak for most guys and say Emma Watson.<br>  <br>  2. Emma by far. Kristen sounds high and has about three facial expressions in her movies. <br>  <br>  3. Harry Potter. I dislike Twilight. The reason for my negative opinion of the Twilight books is mainly the underdeveloped characters. They're just too perfect and I can't relate to them. Edward of course is flawless so he doesn't need to develop at all. This irritates me because I enjoy reading about a character who grows and learns. Edward doesn't develop as a character. To me, he is just a blatant Gary-Stu. Bella is the same way. She is meant to have "flaws" when those flaws (clumsiness, modesty) can't be considered character flaws at all really. And, like Edward, she doesn't develop. And, forgive me for saying so, but she is just so dang annoying! She is a whinny damsel in distress who can't live without a man. In New Moon I was hoping to see a stronger Bella but I was greatly disappointed. One other thing that I dislike about the series is the lack of any moral or theme. After reading Eclipse I assumed that the books were about sacrificing for your loved ones, but Breaking Dawn proved me wrong; Bella sacrifices....nothing. Nothing at all. She gets everything, literally EVERYTHING that she wants. She turns into a beautiful vampire, she maintains a relationship with Jacob and her family, she has no weaknesses (weaknesses that someone in her situation would normally have) and she gets a great superpower *cough-marysue-cough*, and she even gets the perfect child to add to the giant heap of perfect characters. The only aspect of human life that she sacrifices is getting old, and she makes it obvious in the series that aging, to her, is extremely formidable. So you can't really consider it a sacrifice can you?<br>  <br>  I hope I'm not offending any Twilight fans by saying this. It is just my opinion.<br>  <br>  4. Hermione Granger. She isn't a Mary-Sue like Bella (see above). <br>  <br>  5. Both will probably have excellent acting careers. I'm not so sure who will have the better one. <br>  <br>  BQ - Rupert most definitely.  Rob seems...I don't know...I've seen interviews with both guys and Rupert seems more appealing to me. Also, his character is more appealing to me as well. I'd rather kiss Ron than Ed...|`|UgvLTFmSaa	emma watson<br>  emma watson<br>  harry potter, because i havnt seen twilight yet.<br>  hermione granger<br>  i really dont know.<br>  and ewe neither

waGFlfRUaa	Bruce Lee!<br>  <br>  Lee was able to mix so many different styles, that he was nearly invincible. Even though, one time Lee fought another master, when he was younger and got his *** handed to him... Lee could be beaten, but I don't think Jet Li could do it. Li is good, but I don't think against Lee he could win. Worse case scenario, it would end of a tie between the two...<br>  <br>  Titles and Championships mean nothing, when it is one on one, down and dirty between two great martial artists...|`|hQWucH5uaa	Jet Li would win.<br>  <br>  Bruce Lee was a phenomenon by American standards, but mediocre by Chinese standards.

sMmy12skaa	They had a fight.. he shouldn't of hit her by all means but hes paying for it with everything... <br>  It looks like his career is being destroyed! Radio stations are not playing his music,Twitter Moms think there the ones that got Chris kicked off KCA on Nick. He withdrew him self from KCA ballot. I think that everyone is making too big of a deal with this.. Him and Rhianna are in a relationship, I don't think his personal live and his music career need to be mixed. There young. need to live there lives..... everyone is acting like this is the first time a man has hit  a women.. Its is ridiculous!! People make mistakes, they had a fight. Its funny how most abused women suffer for years with a abusive husband but this incident happens and hell breaks loose!!<br>  My final thought is this.. If Rhianna think she want to be back with him I dont think she needs to be ridiculed for it. It should not be ok for a women to hit a man neither.  There personal live needs to be left alone and be handled in private. <br>  I feel bad for both of them.|`|UgvLTFmSaa	I think she's either stupid, or scared.<br>  I wouldnt take him back no way! Iam asuming there must be money involved and that's why they are being nice to eachother.|`|5jMNBO2naa	it shows she has a low self esteem<br>  she is very much like Whitney Houston ( remember her ? )<br>  in that she chose poorly and will go back because it all she knows and all she thinks she is worth of <br>  if she ends up dead i will not be surprised<br>  if her career is dragged down by him<br>  i also will not be surprised<br>  she is on the right track to do just that, just like Whitney, i am sure she will come out and defend him ( just like Whitney )<br>  and when if she gets on drugs, i also will doubt it|`|Y7ZSaTOtaa	Everyone says she took him back--who said they ever parted to begin with??  Really think on this***<br>  <br>  I think Rihanna is crazy as hell for taking him back.  He damned near beat her unconscious.  People keep saying he "hit" her no he beat her up really badly punching her and biting too!  If you hear the official police report he threatened to kill her etc and so forth.  Clearly this is not the first time he has hurt her physically and sad to say I doubt it will be the last.  Chris Brown and Rihanna both watched their Mothers be victims of SPOUSAL ABUSE!! That is the saddest part of all, so why continue to condone these actions?  CB messed her up, she will need her face to heal first before she's thinking clear|`|sZMa0s7Baa	As unfortunate as it is, it's not uncommon. Most girls with abusive boyfriends or husbands go back to them many times before leaving. Some because of fear and some because they really do love them. So it's sad but we also don't know the entire story.|`|GSbz9Zq4aa	don't care, waste of my time|`|FbMYvTkZaa	i think she is so stupid for going back to him.|`|e7fNTaRBaa	I believe that rhianna is crazy to take chris brown back before if a man hit you 1 time already it go to happen again if he got drunk are they get in to it again so what was rhianna thinking about when she say she still love chris. There a lots of brother out here that she can get but she want a man to hit and beat her up all the time will on the news chris and rhianna was in a hotel together before his court day that was on the news.Rhianna i think that u are a good girl but you must like to get beat up because u can do better then that and chris if you really love her like u say u do don't do that hitting stuff because next time u may go to jail forever this time and stay little bit long then u want to are not. Rhinanna be care what u doing in this relationship this time.|`|KBL1t21taa	I *think* people need to forget about it, get a life, and move on.<br>  <br>  who really cares about damn chris brown and rhianna?<br>  <br>  the people who keep talking about this are stupid and immature.|`|do8pdlluaa	They are doing a duet.

Ba2omo22aa	all the other songss by them they're greatt!!!|`|Iflgi71Zaa	I love that song, and that band! Maybe you could listen to other songs by them, like Starstrukk, and Richman, which is my favorite.<br>  But a band that is like them, would be Cobra Starship. They have really funny songs, that are catchy. They do covers, like, I Kissed A Boy, and my favorite, Hollaback Boy. They are just really catchy, and funny. But if you like some semi-popular bands, I reccomend, Forever The Sickest Kids, The Academy Is..., and Skye Sweetnam. Maybe even, All Time Low? I like all those bands, so maybe you will!<br>  Hope I helped :]|`|3FWEOGZmaa	CHECK OUT----<br>  the band called HOLLYWOOD UNDEAD<br>  they kinda have a 3OH!3 sounds to them.
uGFzzLYWaa	I watch BSG and I don't like it when good characters are killed off, although I understand why the writers do it. <br>  I really liked Gaeta and Dee, and was a little disappointed when their characters died, but for Gaeta, I completely got it, but having Dee kill herself was a little pointless, imo.<br>  BSG has given me a great ride, it is one of my favorite shows, I will be sorry to see it go, but it's better to end it now while it's still good.<br>  I tried to watch Lost, but I can't get into it.|`|TJtifnxPaa	I don't watch Galactica, but I don't agree that it's weird about LOST. LOST is weird anyway, but because the story is continually unfolding, it makes sense that new characters would be introduced.|`|DUg1IkTIaa	I don't think it's weird that some of the characters are dying, while at the same time new characters are appearing in the Series.  It's a pretty common way to end shows that have a long history.  Another example is CSI: Las Vegas.  That show has lost characters as well and others have joined the cast.
qsuYKa3naa	Yes it ripped me apart then shredded my heart|`|aZtPJSLFaa	yea by breaking up with me with when i wasnt ready to break up with him. but that was along time ago. lol^^|`|52pZj3WFaa	Absolutley.<br>  <br>  He was married and I just adored him.

wwlb1lznaa	Aimee's answer just shows why people fly the confederate flag.  Yes, a few racist's do fly it, but most of the people I know who have one would not hurt or be mean to black people or anyone.  They just fly it because it represents the entire south, as opposed to one single state's flag.  When everyone else in the country labels the entire south as stupid rednecks, inbred, etc,  it is human nature to want to band together against it.<br>  I do not fly the flag or use it because I know my some of my black friends associate  it with racism.  But I am proud of being southern, and am sick of being labeled as an idiot, that I sleeep with my brothers, etc.  That is just a prejudiced as being a racist.  I hate elitist snobs who really don't know what they are talking about.|`|9b6acf55d27a39548c86f16f9efbd431aa	Not so much because nobody can put me  in chains in 2009, but I do question why people say it is part of their heritage.  My girlfriend is Polish and Celtic.  That's a heritage.  Being Irish Scots, South African or Latina  is a heritage. I consider being Southern or Northern a location however.|`|fyggOrpJaa	No cuz I don't know the history about it<br>  But since I'm in the South and travel alot in the South, I see it alot.<br>  BTW. do you go to Old Miss cuz I'm trying to apply there next year|`|BM71UbSiaa	No, not the flag itself.  Some people use it to be offensive and obnoxious though.  Honestly people give too much power to pieces of cloth sometimes.|`|TnF42yfRaa	Not really, it just gets really old sometimes...it's for the people that wish slavery had worked out|`|49f9b60d2a04c51ad787bd1c6e385195aa	No way! I display it proudly. I have a shirt with it on it. I'm a proud Southerner. Texan to be exact.|`|N3ioHJwDaa	No, unless people use it to be offensive, and some do.|`|d9iXONYsaa	No.  It is a part of history.|`|7d8a232729948aa43d4cfa13bdc6648faa	Not really, its just a flag|`|YQOT68xFaa	Nope. it's just a flag, and I have no real feelings about it either way. Perhaps my Canadian heritage has something to do with it.|`|a4LWildhaa	Not at all. It's a major piece of USA history. If people can't deal with it-oh, well.<br>  That's a good fit for it.|`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	Not offended by it at all.<br>  <br>  Some ignorant people try to use it as a tool of hatred, and that is so sad.  A previous answerer is a good example of how people grab on to dogma with both hands when they don't know any better|`|EnBhiRp3aa	I personally don't like it. I went south to Georgia and saw a few along the way. It surprised me. Why do people even have those any more? I'm from the north though, so that's probably why I don't like it.|`|4EZcG3YSaa	no Sir, our flag of St. George seems to offend but I'll fly it with pride!|`|y89gXzFqaa	Nope why would it

hQWucH5uaa	No.  Too much graphic violence and sex.|`|vXREV1Bzaa	If your mature, yes.<br>  I'm thirteen and I saw it with my mom and brother. It has a very deep meaning and a sick twisted humor to it.<br>  The sex scenes are a bit much, but you've probably been exposed to just as much sex by just listening to music or watching tv. Nothing out of this world. Just a few scenes of a man and woman having sex. If you can get over that and aren't queasy when it comes to blood and guts, sure go ahead and see it.|`|YFhhlp7taa	It really depends on the child's level of maturity.

iAZMI6UCaa	I watched the movie and I regret doing that Ray Stevenson did a horrible job playing the punisher the plot of the movie was very bad and overall the movie sucked. The plot and timing of the movie were the two main reasons Thomas Jane did not want to be involved with the film. Good decision by Thomas.|`|v61VWKMDaa	It's not "Punisher 2", it's a reboot of the series the same was Batman Begins was a reboot to the Batman movies before it.<br>  <br>  Ray Stevenson, who plays Frank Castle in the new movie, looks more like the Punisher than Thomas Jane ever could.

It has a lot of pyschological stuff and symbolism if you like that. It also has mild homosexuality but it's nothing graphic<br>  <br>  Mars is another good shojo manga. it's a romance btwn a shy artist girl and a popular player tough guy. It's fifteen volumes, I read all of them except 11, 12, 13, and 14 and there was one sex scene but we don't see anything so no worries. <br>  <br>  Tsubasa (shojo) is good if you want something a little less mature (sex, violence, drugs, etc.) but it still got a heavy (emotional) kind of plot.<br>  <br>  Cardcaptor sakura is an excellent shojo if you want something more light hearted but not less of a plot.

24e3c53ff3387eb84f27768983042d80aa	The song is about Tuomas and a phase he went through.<br>  <br>  Don't expect to ever fully understand a song by Nightwish. Tuomas' complex way of writing leaves the meaning of his songs open for interpretation. He may sometimes say what the song is based on but wont go into details.
pjFleZqVaa	he's not really that similar but Ishida Uryuu from bleach is a bit like him. he's kinda cold towards ichigo and always saying how stupid he is. he's got black hair, although it's not spiky and he wears glasses. The voice actor for Sasuke and Uryuu are the same!|`|ttyuhvGPaa	There's Haseo from .Hack //Roots anime who looks and somewhat acts like sasuke (the whole lust for power deal). the only difference is the hair color and skin color and the fact that Haseo's upgrade form changes his appearance from that mostly. oh there's also Allen Walker from D Grayman who also shares the same look although persona wise not sure if he does resemble sasuke in that manner.|`|3ERx4opSaa	L from Death note is similar in looks and personallity to him, not exactly though.

I have watched both Sharon Osborne and the Richard Branson one and found them very interesting and rivetting viewing so I am sure Katie Price's will be the same!|`|FcHplZtQaa	Doubt I'll watch it J, can't stand Piers Morgan, I would have watched the Jade one, but Max Clifford reckons she's too weak to do the interview now!|`|Um8osMNuaa	Looks like it'll be a laugh so l'll be watching.<br>  <br>  Plus there's nothing else on!|`|aKhZNd7daa	Yep I shall be watching Jord if I get fed up with it I can always turn over !|`|UfRMJheeaa	That article is badly written - it makes it sound like she was abused on his show ffs....<br>  <br>  She's absolutely disgusting that one.

SkgJYDaCaa	i hope not. i still can't believe he did that to her. After I read the police report, and found out that he smashed her head into the window of the car and punched her while he was driving I hope she will leave him. At least until he has a chance to get help. This is more serious than anyone could have imagined. I'm sure this isn't the first time he's hurt her, and I don't think it will be the last time either. Abusers tend to keep doing it unless they get some serious help. I hope he gets what's coming to him in court, punishment but HELP too. <br>  <br>  Everyone says shame on Rihanna but I think she's just young and shows how serious abusive guys have control over over thier girl friends.|`|9jQnPIjLaa	YA|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	Yes and Tina and Ike too.

vsy4QMHMaa	Hmmm... I'm not sure there's going to be much help here. Pipes (Great Highland, ulian, small pipes or whatever) are kind of beyond the scope of normal "classical music" I think you're going to have to find a pipe maker or dealer to get the "right" answer. <br>  <br>  My own guess is that there is going to be some shaving and shaping required like an oboe or bassoon reed, maybe a band to set the proper tension on the reeds ... things you've mentioned ... but I don't want to steer you toward potentially ruining the reeds.

The only bright spot in it was the on and off performance by Heath Ledger.  The plot was unbelievable and the characters, including Heath's were frankly, impossible.  Action movies need more than just action.  I don't see why so many people liked it, unless  they have some weird fascination with rubber suits and gravely voices.|`|nXxtBkguaa	I didn't see it. But what I don't get what it has to do with Roe v. Wade.  I asked a question about that and one guy was like "have you seen Watchmen yet? Sorry if you haven't, it's an inside joke for those of us that have seen it.|`|vHktLKiMaa	You have to stop throwing this into the superhero category as it is nothing like dark knight, iron man. Watchmen deals with a very different theme, and the story is hard to understand for some people.<br>  I saw it and apart from being a little long, I loved it. Very true to the graphic novel, and cool direction.<br>  <br>  Obviously its not for everyone.|`|AA12245937	I saw it and I liked it quite a bit.

It's a challenge, but I felt it was worth the effort.|`|8iCzrsGmaa	I'm seeing it tonight|`|C3RYLngTaa	That's funny because from someone who knows what movies are good this one was amazing.  Don't listen to people who put down this movie because they most likely don't know what they are talking about.  Here's some things from a real point of view.<br>  Plot was excellent-every character had their own story which supported the plot.<br>  Acting was superb-each character was played almost perfect<br>  Special Effects were great-each scene had very good visualization<br>  This movie is much better than The Dark Knight and any mature person who is looking for a good movie to see definitely see this one|`|mg2BJbeAaa	The whole point of the movie is that it isn't Black vs. White or Good vs. Evil. <br>  None of the Watchmen were like Batman at all, though some analogies could be made with Nite Owl II or Rorshach.<br>  Dark Knights plot wasn't exactly clear cut either. The bad guy wants the good guy to kill him so that he isn't a good guy anymore? About the same as Watchmen.|`|eqxrSzNgaa	You are so right!!! It sucks more than any movie ever!!!!

PIjCNYQNaa	Pisces/Pisces could potentially work out really well. You both are sensitive and express your emotions rather freely, and neither of you wants the other to get hurt! Good stuff! Just make sure that you are open with each other even though you don't want to inflict or receive pain.|`|tGGVeW3yaa	Well as a pisces woman myself I have only ever found other pisces men as big flirts|`|GL920Xv5aa	Im pisces and actually it would work out. But pisces are dreamers and either they open up all the way or they dont. They will find eachother weird lol|`|AA11417199	Pisces men look very dreamy SO GUESS WHAT, they are going to be FULL OF DREAMS, and secret fantasies, and don't like to reveal all their dreams to everyone. That's what is mysterious about Pisces men. They are chargeable because they are easily influenced in their environment and around people. Pisces understands the thoughts, actions and feelings of everyone they come into close contact with, which explains their moodiness. Pisces is the zodiac to come last, so that's why it's so hard not to have compassion for someone, because they been through all the signs. However,  they become irritating to me, because they are easily led and stay with an abusive partner (Rhianna). So that pisses me off about them, I'm a Sagittarius and Sagittarius share Jupiter with them, so we have a little bit of understanding of them, but like i said, pisces are somewhat complex. Sometimes when they want to escape from reality, they are hard to reach or find.

bc92578f822694529f24c8bef0cc848baa	Rorschach and Nite Owl go to Veidt's Anatartican retreat (Karnak), and you see Ozymandias killing the people who helped make the machines that he and Manhattan were making.  Rorschach and Nite Owl attempt a sneak attack on Ozymandias, but he is too fast, too strong, and too agile for the both of them.  Nite Owl and Rorschach ask Ozymandias when he was planning on doing his plan to kill millions.  Ozymandias tells them that he is no comic book villain, and that he triggered it 35 minutes ago.  He says that his reason for doing so is to blame Dr. Manhattan for the deaths of millions of people  (the machines he made triggered some energy wave that destroyed all the major cities of every country in the world).  Dr. Manhattan and Laurie (Silk Spectre 2) arrive, and see what has happened, and Dr. Manhattan explains Ozymandias is the cause.<br>  <br>  He immediately teleports the both of them to Ozymandias's fortress, and tells everyone to wait there while he confronts a running Ozymandias and Bubastis (his Lynx cat that has been genetically altered).  He lures him into a machine that caused his original mutatoin, and disintegrated him.<br>  <br>  He comes out, and Silk Specter shoots him with a gun.  He falls down, rolling donw some steps, and once she gets closer to see him, it is reveleaed he caught the bullet, and then attacks her.<br>  <br>  Dr. Manhattan, from above (giant) is shown the still be alive.  Ozymandias backs up with a remote, and turns on the television sets he has.  It is shown that President Nixon is addressing to the entire world that they must all join forces to unite against an unstoppable foe; Dr. Manhattan, thus accomplishing Ozymandias's goal of a united world.  <br>  <br>  They all agree to remain silent about Ozymandias's plan, as revealing it will cause the death of millions to be in vain.  Rorschach refuses to do so, and is confronted by Dr. Manhattan, who kills him.  <br>  <br>  Then, an angry Nite Owl beats on Ozymandias, who just stands there and lets him do so.  After Nite Owl is tired of punching him, he and Silk Spectre board the Owl Ship (Archie/Archimedes), and return back to the US.  Laurie and Dan visit Laurie's mom, who admits that Laurie is indeed the daughter of the Comedian, and Laurie forgives her.  Then, we're shown the office of a newspaper.  They talk about how they  have nothing to print, now that their articles about antagonizing Russia are forbidden, due to the new peace.  The boss tells the worker to choose something from the crank pile (miscellaneous documents), and that it is entirely in his hands.  We then see Rorschach's journal amongst the other letters and such, and we are left to wonder if Rorschach's journal would cause Ozymandias's plan to be in vain, undoing all his work, since the journal states that whatever has happened, that it is all the cause of Ozymandias.|`|svhCHakDaa	then watch it again|`|L9pWts6baa	Rorschach and Nite Owl go to Antartica and confront Ozymandias. They find out that Ozymandias is blowing up the East Coast and other places, not the Russians and their nuclear bombs. Ozy tells them that he is killing millions to save biliions. (Although this whole thing didn't make sense to me).Meanwhile Dr. Manhattan is getting blamed for the explosions and he then teleports to Ozymandias. They all argue, but then Manhattan says that Ozymandias ir right somehow? Rorscach on the other hand disagrees, and tells Manhattan to kill him, which he does. At the end it shows this kid working in a store wearing a tee shirt with a smiley face on it, and he spills ketchup on it, making it look like the Comedian's smiley face button when he was killed. The kid's boss tells him to find something really good to write about. That's when he finds the basket with Rorschach's journal in it. That's how it ends. (Sorry if it is confusing, it was confusing to me)
gEj9GQvQaa	I think it's fine. Doctor Manhattan chose to assemble himself as a perfect human being to display to all in all its glory - I would most likely do the same.<br>  <br>  The one thing I hated was how, in the movie, everybody around me and my girlfriend erupted in laughter at how he was naked. It was complete bullshit - this is a movie, not a peanut gallery. At one point in the movie, I turned to a portly Mexican man who was joking and asked him which grade he was in.<br>  <br>  The immaturity of the audience even extended to the sex scene. I was so pissed...|`|HB7XvPcnaa	i reckon as long as it's vital to the development of character, storyline and it's withing reason considering the context and how far you go with it. as long as it's in context - as it is with anything else - nudity, violence, drugs etc. for example, you're unlikely to see frontal nudity and sexual intercourse in a rom.com, but you are more likely to encounter it in a drama. you get my meaning|`|m3eFscuqaa	Who gives a ****? It's the human body.

If someone wants to look at penises, then good for them but, don't put that crap in a movie if you want it taken seriously.
urbclI2Kaa	Whenever composing a piece, the composer will almost always make the first chord of his piece the determining chord of his key signature.  <br>  <br>  So if a composer uses the chord A C E as his first chord, that has a very ominous (as you put it) sound.  After the key is determined the composer will continues to use cadences involving minor and yes, even major chords.  But, the piece will sound minor because the first chord and the last chord determined the key.  It is very common to have major chords in a minor key.  For example, the five chord in a minor key is minor.  However, many composers will chose to raise the third of the five chord (the leading tone of the scale) in order to produce a major five chord which actually produces a more pleasant sound.  A minor one chord, or the tonic, will generally proceed after this.  And the result is an authentic cadence.  <br>  <br>  Generally the first chord, will establish the key for the rest of the piece.|`|hcNXuFCJaa	You are well on your way to a world of more questions LOL!  You should do some research on modes as well.  The reason a minor key sounds dark is because it is centered around a minor chord or minor chords.  When something is in a minor key it will play more minor chords and it will resolve and center around a minor chord.  A minor key will typically use more diminished chords which are (in my humble opinion) beautifully dark.<br>  <br>  Simply put:<br>  <br>  major keys use more major chords and make them more important<br>  <br>  minor keys use more minor chords  and make them more important|`|eXMI11kkaa	First of all, the primary triads of a major piece of music are all major, and the primary triads of a minor piece of music are all minor. Which means that, those chords, there is a major or minor third in the first "stack."<br>  <br>  Second, unless it's written in harmonic, a natural minor scale does not have a leading note, which means that there is no "push" back to the tonic.<br>  <br>  Third thing to understand is, that a minor scale is just the relative major scale played differently, starting from a different place and ending at a different place. They just start on the 6th. They are in Aeolian mode, which, again, means that there is no leading note to have a sense of "going back home (to the tonic.)"|`|CXgPkEPFaa	because usually if a song is in like C maj or something the chord progression goes on to something like C, G, F.. but with Aminor then the progession is usually on minor chords.<br>  But look at it this way, if the key is C maj, the starting measure and last measure probably end on a C maj chord. So the song starts and ends on a happy note. Same with A minor except starts and ends on sad note.<br>  xD<br>  the more experience you have in music the better you will understand it. Good luck.
fb5e6abe0d15467cb8e98fd9cd776d9daa	I just watched it tonight and I agree fully with its 18 certificate.

AA12228017	10! I read the books so I am not one of those people who has only seen the movie. I LOVED both the books and the movie. I saw the movie 4 times in theaters. I can't wait for the DVD to come out! (March 21st) <br>  <br>  I guess I am someone who can read a book and then see the movie and remember that they are two different pieces of art. Yes the movie did leave out things I wish it hadn't. Like Bella and Edward confessing their love for each other. I mean it is sort of a given but never actually said. And the car accident scene was all wrong too and the whole bookstore, Edward saving Bella from the bad guys scene was messed up as well. However, I went into the theater with an open mind and remembered that the movie is not going to be like the book. I was also annoyed by Kristen as Bella. She reminded me of a boy. The studering was annoying. Again though I think she, just like the rest of the cast did what they could and it will get better with the next 3 movies. I also agree the make up was a bit cheesy. I am sure that will get better too. <br>  <br>  So all in all I love both the books and the movie. Of course the books are always going to be better because with a book you are not limited to what can happen. With a movie there is only so much time and money to work with before you have to wrap it up and say we did what we could now enjoy. ya know?<br>  <br>  I feel the exact same way about Harry Potter and the LOTR trilogy.|`|r6XtCaMkaa	6<br>  I read the 4 twilight books I'll confess it's mu guilty pleasure, but the movie was just... bad.<br>  I mean, the make up was horrible, the acting, the writers didn't put a big effort on the movie, the quality in general wasn't the expected. Even Bella's Lullaby was supposed to be a touching amazing song, but it was pretty normal for me. (I've studied piano and I'm an actress)<br>  + I don't like Robert Pattinson as Edward, he is just... creepy.<br>  I remember when they chose him nobody agreed and they complained about  him but people got used to it,  in general I don't think he is that good looking or an amazing actor to deserve the roll of the hero of about a third of the population on earth.|`|RyC2T6vOaa	i would give it a 4. the movie didn't match the book well and left out alot of important scenes. i also didn't think some of the characters matched the books description. i mean since when is Laurent Jamaican?<br>  but for people who haven't read the books i would give it a higher rating. its just i read the books and the movie was way different from the book.|`|Yh7GOkZHaa	9<br>  it was a great movie, but I didn't like that they left so many parts out from the book, and i did like the books better. all in all though it was very fun to watch and i cant wait to see new moon!!!|`|DBYbNw9raa	9 for me, I liked the books, so I liked the movie I thought they cast edward well, but i'm not crazy about who they picked for bella (not looks but acting style) that's why i gave it a 9.|`|bpLyWgbsaa	1<br>  the acting and makeup was extremely cheesy.<br>  In a book the story is amazing. Movie, not so much.|`|zy5qcc0Raa	8<br>  I am a ginormous twilight fan, and i was disappointed that more of the quotes from the book were not used. I still enjoyed it and thought they did an excellent job of bringing the book to life, i just think it could have been a thousand times better with more of the quotes in it. I mean, i have written pages of my favorite quotes from the twilight saga, so they're pretty important to me.|`|fGFO61JWaa	I would give it an 8. I loved the book, and the choices of actors. Robert and Kristen did very well as Edward and Bella, and I loved all the other characters/actors. I was slightly disappointed in the pace of the film, it was very fast. But I loved the shots, and they adapted the book wonderfully. <br>  <br>  Hope it helps.

hQWucH5uaa	It is a well made movie with dazzling special effects.  It is also long and boring.  It also has graphic violence and sex which are definately inappropriate for children (inappropriate for a Marine in my opinion).<br>  <br>  There is a naked blue guy and his penis is shown all through the movie; then the naked blue guy is having sex with his hot girl friend - duplicates himself and they have a menage a trois.  Then his hot girl friend leaves him and has hot sex with another super hero - The Night Howl, I mean Owl.<br>  <br>  Some of the bad guys get blasted by ray beams and their remains look like messy spaghetti & meatballs splattered all over the walls, floors, and ceilings.  There's close up slow motion of graphic killings and a graphic rape scene by one of the super heroes against a female super hero.<br>  <br>  Yeah, you sure don't want to bring kids to this flick.

36UeGmPPaa	wow, you said just what i was thinking.Miley cyurs should go F*** herself if she is so cool the little hoe dancing around in her hannah montana wig.|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	I think there are 2 types of celebrity. <br>  <br>  1. celebrities with enormous talent- such as George Clooney (who is so very Cary Grant-ish in his manner and style), Nicole Kidman, Natalie Portman, Sean Penn and Cate Blanchett.<br>  <br>  2. Celebrities more on their sex appeal or teen idol status than their acting or singing- such as Miley Cyrus, The Jonas brothers, Taylor Swift, etc. <br>  <br>  but then there were the 1st and 2nd kind in the "Golden Era" as well. <br>  <br>  Gidget reminds me of the fame that Miley Cyrus is experiencing w/the younger crowd. Bomb shells like Jane Mansfield resemble some of the bomb shells of today.  <br>  I'm sure that in 50 to 80 yrs people will be asking the same thing only about the "great stars with huge talent and sex appeal of the early 21st century" and where have they gone.<br>  <br>  i personally do prefer the classics. not many stars of today catch my eye. i have my favs- Cate Blanchett, Natalie Portman, Nicole Kidman, Cathrine Zeta-Jones, John Hannah, Colin Firth, Val Kilmer, Sean Penn, Robin Williams among others. mostly serious actors w/great talent for dramas and/or comedies, and not so much "fluff actors" that do mainstream, (filler movies).|`|fc2LcdvVaa	*claps* Thank you! I hate all these phony hollywood "actors" and its funny how people worship them but if they really met them they wouldnt pour water on you if you were on fire. People should look up to real people around them like Soldiers, Teachers, Firefighters etc. not these celebrities who dont know or care about you. And yes all the classic actors are way better. Dont forget to add Sinatra to that last.|`|Q1EtcCb7aa	Audrey Hepburn is a legend among actresses.
u9RwzLPnaa	Sorry, this is the comics and animation forum. I liked the charmed episode where they lost the power of three. The one where the world found out they're witches. I think that was season five ep 100 but that's it. Sorry I can't be of bigger help.

vH2OF9z8aa	you will have Success): A time of prosperity and profit. Success and generosity in material things. Power and influence turned to noble pursuits. Philanthropy, and the balancing of physical and spiritual life. May suggest gifts or aid to one in need. <br>   The card visible at the center of the cross represents the obstacle that stands in your way - it may even be something that sounds good but is not actually to your benefit. Three of Wands (Virtue): Personal fortitude and strength of character. Accumulated power set in motion towards a distant goal. The initiation of an enduring partnership based on absolute trust. Honor maintained in a time of desperate struggle. Taking full responsibility for a decision, and bearing the solitude of leadership. <br>   The card at the top of the cross represents your goal, or the best you can achieve without a dramatic change of priorities. Four of Swords (Truce): A time of tranquility and intellectual repose in the midst of a great struggle. A temporary retreat from stress to regather inner strength, reaffirm convictions, reorganize thoughts, and formulate a new plan. The need for vigilance in a moment of calm. May suggest a withdrawal from the material world to find spiritual guidance. <br>   The card at the bottom of the cross represents the foundation on which the situation is based. Death: A major change or transformation, possibly traumatic and unexpected. Freedom from the shackles of the past. A new beginning. Death coupled with rebirth, usually related to consciousness and lifestyle. <br>   The card at the left of the cross represents a passing influence or something to be released. Ace of Pentacles: The seed of prosperity and material gain - perhaps as yet unseen. A new foundation from which to turn your dreams into reality. The need to focus on the practical and understand the dynamics of the natural world. May represent a gift, document, inheritance, or an unexpected opportunity for physical achievement. <br>   The card at the right of the cross represents an approaching influence or something to be embraced. The Chariot: Victory through might. Advancement through bold action. Change through force. Order established through vigilance. A trying situation mastered by balancing opposing forces against each other. Discipline, individual effort and endurance will turn the tide. <br>   The card at the base of the staff represents your role or attitude. Seven of Swords (Futility): An opportunity to withdraw from a hopeless situation and fight another day. Disengagement from a struggle you should never have been involved in. A desperate attempt to resolve a matter without conflict. The use of cleverness or outright deception to turn the tide in your favor. <br>   The card second from the bottom of the staff represents your environment and the people you are interacting with. The Emperor: Worldly authority and power. Social mastery and oratory. One who is intelligent, experienced, confident and reasonable. A patriarch or primary male influence. The motive force of politics and society. The ability to fulfill plans and use mental control over the emotions. <br>   The card second from the top of the staff represents your hopes, fears, or an unexpected element that will come into play. Eight of Swords (Interference): Chagrin at the unforeseen consequences of prior decisions. Criticism, censure, and the imposition of external restrictions. Confusion leading to powerlessness. Inability to focus on the crux of a problem and free oneself from a difficult situation. Being hamstrung by a past failure or humiliation. <br>   The card at the top of the staff represents the ultimate outcome should you continue on this course. Seven of Cups (Temptation): Daydreams and things seen in the glass of contemplation. The scattering of energies by strong desires and unrealistic goals. The pursuit of illusions and the dissipation of energy on false choices. Intoxication, delirium, and hallucination, leading to the negation of effort. Under rare and extreme circumstances, may indicate the revelation of transcendental spiritual truth.|`|bvwYVGJOaa	My parents left theit country 24 yrs ago and still in touch on the phone and email and visits them when they can.<br>  <br>  You'll be alright and learn to be independent and learn to do things your way only.

L6jKwlyXaa	Lady GaGa told About.com that she intended this song to have a few different interpretations. She explained: "The song is about a few different things – it's about my struggles, do I want fame or do I want love? It's also about wooing the paparazzi to fall in love with me. It's about the media whoring, if you will, watching ersatzes make fools of themselves to their station. It's a love song for the cameras, but it's also a love song about fame or love – can you have both, or can you only have one?"|`|2938fc484fe7eb454f067ea23af1c9fbaa	i love this song! it should of been her next song.<br>  basically she is stalking a guy that she likes, she is comparing it to the paparazzi<br>  dont u listen to the lyrics|`|LoLx0szUaa	no, shes following this guy she likes, like a paparazzi .

I'm really proud of that song."<br>  <br>  Source: <a href="http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=12723" rel="nofollow">http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1...</a>|`|xck7VmVeaa	1&4) In an interview she said she wrote this song about when Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, and Nicole Richie's mugshots all came out and they all were posing in them and she realized that there's an art to the paparazzi.<br>  2) Her genres are from pop to dance to electronica. You can tell because they're upbeat and good for dancing or events to get people moving.<br>  3) I can't really tell exactly what I'm hearing in the song, but I'm guessing since it's partly electronica, it's a mix of electronic musical instruments, synthesizers, music sequencers, drum machines, and digital audio workstations. All these are used in the making of such music.
Q5FYrU9vaa	Mangas are basically japanese comics... You read them differently from American books, comics, etc... Here we read books left to right, In mangas u read right to left. There are also animes that are based on these mangas. *Anime is japanese cartoons just in case u didnt know* For example bleach and naruto.|`|PeOODdgiaa	what the others said are right. basically comic books , i just wanna add that they're not all the stereotypical comic book though like superman and batman, which are nice but there are other types/genres too. think of a typical book told through pitures and dialogue|`|jqHK8lHWaa	yep. They're Japanese comic books, read back to front, right to left.<br>  (and they're amazing!) :]<br>  If you go to the bookstore, they fall under 'graphic novels', but most people read them online for free, such as <a href="http://www.mangafox.com/," rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com/,</a> and <a href="http://www.onemanga.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.onemanga.com/.</a><br>  Hmm, my fav. manga would have to be Fruits Basket (23 volumes).<br>  But I also like Fall in Love Like a Comic (2 volumes) and Gaba Kawa (1 volume).|`|Mc4rsOJbaa	Like the Black Winged Assassin said, they do sometimes go left to right, if they're the flopped form. But yeah, most of them go right to left.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	They're basically comic books.

Greatest Hits - Greatest Hits<br>  2. Get Out (Acoustic) - Everything Under The Sun (Disc 1)<br>  3. Ebin - 40 oz. to Freedom <br>  4. Garden Grove - Sublime<br>  5. Badfish - Second Hand Smoke<br>  <br>  I also have a cover of No Woman, No Cry which may or may not be Sublime and a cover of Badfish/Boss DJ by Jack Johnson, both of which are VERY GOOD...<br>  <br>  Hope this gets you more into one of the greatest bands of all time!

I mean it must take alot of talent to be a backup singer because your voice has gotta be able to harmonize with the others.<br>  many people dont know of his ability though as you cannot really hear it most of the time. <br>  Kevin sings:<br>  -Hello Goodbye cover "you say low"<br>  -Mandy, "now its been a few years, it looks like things have changed. now shes mine and I wanna say"<br>  -alot of Sorry, you just have to take out the lead vocals. heres a way you can really hear him and he sounds really good: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1TMjWYIzc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fr1TMjWYI...</a><br>  skip to :35 and dont turn it up too loud so the quality is better. hes the deep voice so I can definitely tell that its him and all of it that doesnt sound "watery" is him.<br>  -if you want to hear more of him just find some JB songs on youtube without lead vocals or use Audacity and the instructions are linked on the description of that Sorry video. <br>  -We Got the Party<br>   he sings the line with Miley "everyone is dancing to their own beat....." <br>  the more you listen the easier it will be to distinguish Kevin's voice from Joe's (they sound alike until you pay attention more)<br>  <br>  <br>  I like both Nick and Joe's voice. They are very different and good in their own way. Its just that Nick tries too hard sometimes with the notes so thats why he tends to sound nasal. Joe isnt ever nasally but there have been a few times where Joe sounds awful live. Nick tends to be more on key. so they both have their good and bad I cant choose. I think that some people dont like one over the other because they dont like that kind of sound. the beauty of someones singing can sometimes be in the ear of the beholder.|`|F49y3gImaa	At least Nick can hit MOST of his notes on key. Joe can't. His singing is too pitchy most of the time, and he doesn't sound half as good as on the CD.<br>  <br>  Kevin can sing, but he doesn't do anything but back-up vocals. That's his choice, though.<br>  <br>  I don't like them, and I'm not a JB fan. I'm just being honest.|`|l8djUFdDaa	*I do not mean to be rude*<br>  <br>  NONE OF THEM CAN SING...<br>  Did ya'll not hear how they murdered Stevie Wonders song at the Grammys??|`|5fcKxRHsaa	nick is the one that can sing, joe cant sing<br>  <br>  like, at the end of each sentence, joe makes stupid noises, like ehh!!<br>  watever, lol|`|itIUEZdaaa	I think all three of them sing very well|`|QlBLZ4tVaa	ANYONE can sing, but there are a lot of them that don't do it very well.|`|Bd4cGbEXaa	no did you hear them at the i think grammys they were horrible.|`|Q1EtcCb7aa	Agreed.

The city's fate rests in the hands of seven loser superhero wannabes: the fork-flinging Blue Rajah, the shovel-wielding Shoveler, the posessed bowling ball-hurling Bowler, the flatulent Spleen, the only-when-nobody's-looking Invisible Boy, the mysterious Sphinx, and the perpetually-angry Mr. Furious.|`|C1y4sOfFaa	mystery men|`|uyfTeiyraa	League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.|`|hmnO2jmdaa	Mystery Men.<br>  <br>  <br>  This movie is a lot of fun. What makes it great especially are two things: one is the straightforward way the characters embrace the stereotypes, with discussions of their costumes and superpowers. There's an endearing earnestness to the parody that's very appealing; the second is basic sweetness of the characters and the quality of the chemistry. Claire Forlani deserves particular note as the object of Mr. Furious's desires. There's a boatload of talent here.

AA10479574	they do not put on a Christian act. they had their purity rings before Disney discovered them.<br>  <br>  I do actually like their music. they are not groundbreaking and theyre not my fav band (not even on my top 5) but I like some of their songs. some relate to me and they sound pretty good live (they just have their bad days) I like their older music better as in the music they made before Disney discovered them.<br>  <br>  I mostly like them for who they are (all three brothers and Garbo) tho. their personality actually makes up much of their appearance and thats why I see so much sexiness in the older brothers. Its the fact that they are decent normal guys. theyre funny, can be weird, crazy and sweet. individually, there are more reasons but thats why I like all of them as a group.<br>  I like Garbo the most though because of his offbeat sense of humor, hes very nice (not sweet like Kevin but still nice) and he doesnt really let anything bother him. hes a happy guy. hes also very sexy.|`|WnTrAkPHaa	im an anti jb fan but i think it is to do with their looks! lol<br>  they'll either think they're cute or hot and their music is actually really bad. not sure if i can even call it music!|`|rRceaE4Maa	If you don't like them, why in the sam heck do you care!!!?

InAICv25aa	Left hand pizzicato!<br>  <br>  Okay, so here's what you need to do.<br>  <br>  1) Practice the way you drop the bow. Try to really drop it on the string and make a sound that sounds similar to a pizzicato. Practice just the notes that are bowed for now, from slow to fast.<br>  <br>  2) Practice just the left hand. Pluck the string and try to do it harder. Repeat every finger a few times. First finger is pretty fast. For an exercise, try putting all four fingers on one string, then play a pizzicato for each finger, starting with the fourth one, then third, second, and first.<br>  <br>  3) Put every thing together, start slowly for now. When you are comfortable with the slow tempo, you can speed it up.|`|tuATxHsVaa	The idea is to pluck the strings however you can while you play the bowed notes. You can't really practice the pizzicato part completely independently, because it is tied to the fretwork you are doing. The finger that you are plucking with on your left hand might change depending on the other notes you are playing.<br>  <br>  You'll have to get used to attacking the left hand frets with a finger that is also ready to pluck a note. That can only be practiced very slowly and sped up. As far as practicing the "plucking" by itself... well.. it's not all that important. It just isn't that hard to pluck strings. It's hard to pluck and fret at the same time. That is why you must simply practice the passage slowly. The only difficultly you'll find is when you are fretting and plucking near the nut of the violin - as the strings are rather stiff right there. You can practice that, if needed. I try to use my 3rd finger to pluck these (if possible). The further you can get from the nut, the easier the plucking will be. Keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  A good example is the Joachim cadenza for Beethoven's Violin concerto. There is a section where you bow and pluck at the same time. You will learn from this cadenza that it necessary to pluck the string in various ways... with various fingers.<br>  <br>  So, practice the bowing stuff first, then add the plucking. Practice it slowly. You might find that you have to change the way your are fretting the bowed notes in order to be able to accommodate the plucked ones more easily. <br>  <br>  It is impossible to practice the plucking by itself without doing the proper fretwork for the bowed notes. That is the bottom line. The only thing you would be doing differently when practicing *just* the plucking would be putting down your bow. That seems more confusing to me than practicing it the way it really is played. Just practice it very slowly and you'll get it down.<br>  <br>  Court Violinist<br>  <br>  *|`|XJqPzSbTaa	I'm pretty sure the section you are talking about refers to pizzicato with the left hand. Practice slowly and but rhythmically.

There is no reason you can't become a good soldier. I have no birth time to work with, but a noon chart puts Scorpio on the ASC and that is fine for a military career.

PPyMhRJAaa	Attempted rape scene and lots of violence and nudity makes it an 18.|`|5KcUyLFRaa	It's not about genre it about content. The watchmen has more graphic and explicit content unsuitable for little people.|`|EL5ulQM7aa	Well...<br>  There's rape, extreme gore, graphic sex, homophobia, strong language, children biting each other's faces (seriously), pregnant women being shot, people being burnt alive, people exploding, people melting, explicit torture, and the shiny blue guy in all the trailers and posters is completely naked throughout the film with no "Austin Powers" cover-ups.<br>  <br>  It is certaintly an 18 - I'm quite desensetized to films, but this shocked me a little bit in places.|`|q5PL5g6Saa	I saw it today (I'm 18) and it was reaaaally violent. You can already see it from the opening credits in which there are two women lying on a bed, in a pool of blood, and on the wall there's written "lesbian whores" with blood. There's a lot of full frontal male nudity (manhattan something...he's completely naked in almost every scene) and also bare breasts, some sex scenes (one is really explicit, and the other one features manhattan using his superpowers in order to please silk spectre). Some gory scenes, such as mutilations, and blood spurting everywhere.|`|vHktLKiMaa	Watchmen's subject matter, intense violance and sexual scenes land it at 18. I have seen it and it makes 300(His other movie) look like a BBC kids show.|`|InJ5SKd5aa	Its a really violent film with blood and deals with really serious things such as rape|`|7jp9vU2Taa	The violence was more on a torturing basis, so condemned to an 18, similar to the Taken DVD rating.<br>  <br>  Matter of fact, Watchmen is by no means violent, it has a few small sequences, but nothing in comparison to such fare as Snyder's previous films, but it's nice to see a film without teenage interruptions...|`|O1Xm6X7Iaa	Pretty damn explicit sex scene, that's one of the main reasons. I'm 23 and mostly unshockable but even I was a little surprised by how explicit it was.<br>  <br>  Oh and the violence is an eye-opener too. Good film on the whole though!

AA11417199	Okay, Capricorn males want to take care of everything so they can feel that they accomplish something, and hates breaking promises.So, leaving that fact, Capricorns want to kind of dominate the relationship. He likes being the caretaker, or whatever you want to call it. Cancers offer them emotional support and affection and also imagination;which Capricorns males likes and needs, since they're so serious all the time. They want someone who understands that their careers are important and romance goes second. However if you stick with him, you'll both share all the rewards and the lifestyle the Capricorn male desperately wanted. He is trustworthy, supportive,polite and timid, but needs someone to bring out the playful side of him, although not so much. Hope that helps. <br>  -Sagittarius|`|mAzgILpfaa	i am also dating a cancer (in which i don't trust AT ALL) .. you need to give us time to think it out and see if its worth our while.

It normally means, that you are worth looking at, maybe a compliment even.<br>  Muslim men are trained to suppress their feelings for other women in the open, but also that women are only second class citizens, if any.<br>  You are living in a country, where that is not the case, so adapt or wear a chadri or burqa, but be assured, that that would even draw more stares in the UK!|`|eXE3NE6Daa	i did`nt think you were allowed to use the pig word|`|Pdex43zgaa	They need one last glimpse of paradise before they fall into the bottomless cavern.|`|RJyhnT8jaa	You know humans are animals too, I think that sort of behavior is hard-wired into our brains, you should have just ignored him in my opinion|`|lV2a22gzaa	Grow up.<br>  British culture.<br>  British saying...If you cant stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.|`|jLwCzblBaa	How many more times are you gonna ask about this shite?|`|AA11048739	Im with Kiss..........total and utter shite|`|BM71UbSiaa	This has troll written all over it.<br>  <br>  Trust me on this one, some women look too.

By the way I am White an proud of it.<br>  I have a great many muslim friends an have worked with them for many years an can tell you for a fact I have never met such sexist pigs in my life they treat women as second class citizens back home in there own native lands, they demand women cover up there faces you do not have the freedom you do here. I wonder would you smack an old muslim man for looking at you? No you wouldn't an you know it you are supposed to treat them with respect arn't you? I think you owe this man a big appology an are very lucky he did not call the police on you an have you arrested as I would have done. In this country where you have the freedom to wear what you want you do so because we do not stop you from living the freedom you are entitled to have, the same goes for everyone else who lives here. if you don't like it bugger off to live some place where this idea of freedom allows you to stay covered up an makes you walk three paces behind the man an know your place. Even if this man was looking at you what makes you think he was looking at you because he fancied you, he might just as well thought you were butt ugly which is why you covered your face over? <br>  try not to assume every white man in this country is a filthy pig because that is not the case learn to open your mind instead of living a narrow minded life which is how you are sounding.|`|9THK1iWTaa	Silence!<br>  <br>  I keeel you!|`|OfRk9oVFaa	I like bacon sandwiches.

You can't get the tickets ahead of time through the mail or from a different source.<br>  <br>  (This is probably because one of the older meanings of "call" was "visit", so "will call" means "will visit" - think of a doctor's "house call").|`|6R9McFZhaa	go on craigslist.com you find tickets for cheap and better seats

rHrZOSc7aa	I agree with you. I think Robert Pattinson did a fantastic job to acting Edward's character. But I feel as if Kristen Stewart wasn't the best choice of casting on Summit's part.

dCIi9qf5aa	How about serving your fellow man this summer and work in a soup kitchen.  With this economy this service is going to become a life line for many people. You'll learn something about yourself and your friends and the antics of the priceless. By serving and observing these people you are going to take away life lessons that will serve you as you go through life and encounter other people and your peers.

y6wikiJDaa	Holy crap, he's testing you. Don't take the bait and whatever you do, do not flirt with other guys! Especially not in front of him. Scorpios are always suspicious and they love to test people to find out how they really feel. By telling you to go ahead and flirt just shows his insane desire to create a self-fulfilling prophecy. Deep down he isn't sure how loyal you are, and if you do flirt, to him it will only serve to validate his suspicions. Don't feed into it! (I really hate these crazy Scorpio mind games)|`|Y3jNg93vaa	He's saying that no matter what you do, as long as your his he doesn't care. <br>  <br>  but don't flirt with other guys.|`|qQq23yziaa	If i said that it would because I was doing it and did not want to feel guilty. but it could just mean he has faith and trusts you|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	It just means there is no harm if flirting just as long as everyone keeps their hands and lips to them selves and understands it is all just a little harmless BS'ing around.<br>  And I bet you flirt a little and maybe just don't even notice it or thing of it as flirting.|`|3QpMwKyiaa	I think he is saying that he wants you and is just seeing if you want him too.|`|QczEdd5qaa	just respect him and trust him since he trusts you|`|gWXlvD0Laa	he might be scared that he's being too controlling. so he wants to back off a little. or; he could be saying that so that he can get away with flirting with girls because he might say "well i let you flirt with guys." i think you should just ask him if it's bothering you that much. or, just forget about it. guys say stupid things without thinking. (: good luck.|`|I1XIi8syaa	I think he is saying that in case he gets caught flirting! guys will find anyway to flirt and if he tells u its OK then why wouldn't he be doing the same. Its like the guy who buys you something for Christmas or your birthday (ie. PlayStation or X box) so they can play it!|`|muOxoDGOaa	What does astrology have to do with anything? It is all a load of BS if you ask me...it is NEVER right...just talk to the guy....|`|QSGzGpoSaa	I'm not sure what astrology has to do with anything, but I would think it means he's comfortable enough with the relationship to not be threatened by other guys.|`|E587g4qHaa	he probably is saying that because he wants you to be like *yeahh back at ya!* so he can flirt too.<br>  id watch him if i were you...<br>  or talk to him :) that works too.

It wasn't the best movie i've seen, but i defiantly recommend seeing it!|`|AA12245937	I loved Alan Moore's story and I liked the film adaptation. You don't need to read the story to enjoy the movie.

I am still reading it and i m almost done. This novel is sooo cool probably one of the best i've ever read. Dont get me wrong i love superman, batman, and spiderman but this is now at the top of my list i am most likely going to watch this movie this weekend and i cant wait <br>  <br>  <br>  o i forget to say that maybe b4 watching it if you have a few extra bucks you should go buy the novel because it is awsome and youll most likely be confused if you watch the movie b4 reading the novel<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|9fVfMp6vaa	if you read the graphic novel and have high expectations for the movie you might be disappointed, but it is still a good, entertaining movie, just be careful with what you expect from it|`|j8CeFZOvaa	I just saw It. It was pretty good, but It's really dark, bloody, gory, and graphic. There is also nudity and a few sex scenes. It's not a normal superhero movie. These watchmen guys are murderers. You shouldn't see It If you're a kid though. Peace.|`|EGnDovaqaa	no, there are tons of references to 9/11 conspiracy theories.<br>  <br>  i find it offensive, since my wife died in that tragic event (she was one of the firemen, thats right shes a man|`|AVWHK3PWaa	yay|`|I6hd2rfKaa	my big bro said it was hard to follow and didnt lead into anything.no climax.|`|AA11189678	Yes its very good|`|PAciPpSsaa	AAAaah. I'd probably have to watch it again to give a proper review, but I was looking forward to it's end far before it concluded. <br>  The music, the mystery, the unique-ness is good. But it gets boring, and cheesy and too far-fetched for me.|`|x2xVJYTlaa	i thought it was really good. exept there was way to much nudity.

fz77R5Jmaa	no i have never thought he is a creep<br>  <br>  i think if people take the time to find videos and interviews of him that are on the internet and get to see how he is when he talks and answers questions people would change their mind about him<br>  also if they looked up the trial and found the facts instead of just listening to tabloids and people who are against him and only saying what they want you to hear<br>  its a fact that he goes and visits sick children just as much that he performs.<br>  He has given 300 million dollars to charities<br>  <br>  He is a musical genius and a living legend<br>  the Craziness that surrounds him hasnt changed since the 80s just look at this video that was shot within days of today <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7Yez_F8jU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XH7Yez_F8...</a> he was MOBBED! there is no other word to explain it-it was insane<br>  <br>  he is a caring generous person.  He is a great father to his children. He isnt someone who flashes his success or acts like he is better than anyone else.  People who have worked with him recently (Akon Neyo) they said he is cool, laidback, and fun to hang with<br>  with the atmosphere that surrounds him where ever he goes ud think that hed be pissed off that he can't even walk with body guards trying holding people back and that he can't just go to the grocery store but he doesnt.  He is always got a smile on<br>  <br>  he loves his fans and always shows it<br>  <br>  The interview was kinda crap because Bashir made Michael look bad, Michael did his best to keep it together when he found out that Bashir was doing that.  The 2nd take of it shows that off camera Bashir was always complimenting Mike and saying positive things but in the interview he didnt show the positive things he told MJ, he said things that were negative and was saying how he was worried with how Michael was acting and it was rediculous.  Michael was looking to make this documentary to show the true side of things and Bashir took advantage of him and pulled a quick one.  No fans like Bashir because of the interview.<br>  I think the Geraldo interview done during the trial was a good interview, also the Oprah one.<br>  <br>  I hope with the tour he will do an interview with Oprah again! haha idk i just want to see him talk again in an interview that people in the USA can see and i think Oprah would be fair with it.  I dont think he should do one with Barbara Walters.  He should do something thats more loose and in front of a crowd so people can physically see him|`|ukxt9YdIaa	No way!<br>  He isn't a creep.<br>  I've never thought he was a creep because he isn't a creep.<br>  <br>  He is a gorgeous person who has a beautiful heart.<br>  I have this big feeling that after July nearly everyone will love him again.  fingers crossed.|`|CfWXgwxBaa	No,I love MJ...|`|HURcAIu2aa	no i think you are|`|SvzsXddUaa	No, I don't think so.<br>  <br>  Anyone who wants to heal the world, donate millions of money, and ESPECIALLY help the children in Africa (my dad is from there) is cool in my book. :]|`|xLllDu18aa	no hes not a creep. <br>  <br>  do you think a creep would donate 100000000000 $$$ to childrens and wanna help the earth ???|`|gpJOSJw0aa	dude shut up.

She went back to him, and that is what most abused girls do, they go back. I think he has control over her. I just hope that he will get the help that he's claiming to before he puts her into the hospital or a grave. His stepdad was abusive, and I think he is just a very angry young man.

However, alchemy operates on the theory of equivalent trade, and breaking the human alchemy taboo carries a heavy price. Ed loses his leg, and Al loses his body. Ed is able to seal Al's soul inside of a huge suit of armor, at the cost of his arm. Years later, Ed (now with two mechanical limbs) and Al (still trapped in the armor) leave their childhood home, each brother concerned with the other's happiness. Ed, who has a natural talent and skill for alchemy, becomes nationally certified and is soon known everywhere as the "Fullmetal Alchemist." Their true objective is to search for any information on the fabled Philosopher's Stone, hoping it will allow them to regain their old bodies. All of their hopes rest with this mythical stone, which may not even exist at all.

AA12072871	The hobbits needed to appear about three to four feet tall - tiny compared with the seven-foot Gandalf. This was often accomplished using forced perspective, placing Ian McKellen (Gandalf) consistently closer to the camera than Elijah Wood in order to trick the eye into thinking McKellen is towering.<br>  <br>   In order to make "forced perspective" a bit more interesting, the filmmakers devised a totally new system consisting of a pulley and a platform. When the camera moved (which is normally impossible as the forced perspective would become obvious) the actor(s) also moved, and the perspective (7-foot Gandalf - 4-foot hobbits) would always be okay. They also used three differently sized props (large, medium, small) to interact with the different sized characters|`|dMBSE8ilaa	A certain camera angle, anything is possible with those movie camera that they use!|`|bECsJtvDaa	Sometimes they would use doubles that were the right size. But sometimes it was just certain camera angles and digital effects.

aiYPHUEWaa	There is no connection!!!  I can see where you'd be confused...famous shark horror movie, hugely popular medical drama...<br>  <br>  The Some Bad Hat Harry thing is just the signature of that particular production(?) company that helps create House.  (Is TMZ the new To Kill A Mockingbird because at the end there is a reference to Lawyers?!!) As for the quotes...I'm a huge fan of the show, and I've never noticed anything other than the reference to the still huge pop phenomenon that is JAWS.|`|Uv6fADcaaa	I've noticed,,, I have S1-4 on DVD, big fan!<br>  <br>  "BAD HAT HARRY" is the name of their production company... who also did x-men, and the new tom cruise movie Valkyrie, but other than using the line, I don't think they are related to the film JAWS.<br>  <br>  House quotes alot of films though, they make very understandable metaphores...|`|pY4n0Gmnaa	Yep there is no connection the cartoon is just one of those things that gives credit to a company that helped make the show or something, and the "we're gonna need a bigger boat" thing was probably a reference to something House said earlier.

2k8TEiRtaa	Fender bass is a good brand for that kind of money. It is reliable enough to play even live if nessesary. Ibanez is another reliable bass. The amp , I suggest you get the $200 and up minimum. The  bass is notorius for the smaller amps. The amps are specially rigged to play bass. Avoid Washburn Bass guitars. I bought one . I tightend the strings and in about a week, the neck screws came off the neck. they stripped.

Another one by them is "Wake Me Up When September Ends."<br>  "Wonderwall" by Oasis is a very beautiful song and easy to learn.<br>  Blink 182 songs aren't hard, either.<br>  White Stripes' "Seven Nation Army" has such a catchy line, you can't turn it down.<br>  I'm not sure if you like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but you can start on songs like "Scar Tissue" or "Californiation." Their other stuff is kinda hard, though.<br>  A touching song is Shinedown's cover of the Lynyrd Skynrd song "Simple Man." The words to that song are beautiful.<br>  <br>  here's a site with tabs....(you can learn how to read tabs on the site)<br>  www.ultimate-guitar.com<br>  <br>  There are many good songs on there that are easy enough to start on, but good enough to make you look like you've been playing longer than you have.<br>  I hope you have an amazing time starting to play guitar! It's one of the most rewarding things you can do, believe me!|`|e6NjO55Baa	i can give you two super easy ones.<br>  anyone else ( from juno )- i don't know who sings it..but it only has two chords.

oSXgtqYCaa	The other responder gave a good web site to learn about reeds types and strengths. Having studied with Mitchell Lurie, he told me that he makes Mitchell Lurie reeds to play right out of the box for students. <br>  Rico Royals are similar to Mitchell Lurie so you are fine with either one.<br>  <br>  Vandoren (there are several types, but the regular 'Blue Box' is what I use professionally) use generally a bit better cane than Lurie or Rico, which means that they may last longer. A reed will play for several hours, for several sessions. Best to rotate several at a time. <br>  <br>  Good questions, and I wish you the best! Make sure to purchase a reed holder....best is the Vito Reed Holder, which is about $3. DON'T use the Reedguard if you can help it...the reeds dry funny and warp, making them unusable. <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|8e6z8iUHaa	It really depends on your clarinet, and your personal preference. <br>  <br>  Read this article:<br>  <a href="http://www.essortment.com/hobbies/clarinetreeds_szls.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.essortment.com/hobbies/clarin...</a><br>  <br>  it suggests Vandoren

lARh45oaaa	(Text below is cut and paste from another Yahoo Answer:)<br>  <br>  1. Biting a person is usually a DEFENSIVE move when you are constricted in a position where other means of defense (such as pushing someone away) are not available. If Chris bit Rihanna, the odds are that SHE was attacking HIM. <br>  <br>  2. In the official report, too many of Chris Brown's supposed attacks in that car appeared to have come while he was actually driving. Inclusive of the bite. If he is driving a (rented) lambourgini, the ONLY PRACTICAL way for him to bite rihanna is if SHE was attacking him (the DRIVER) and had put BOTH HIM AND HER in a position where that was a real option of defense. I dont know what she really did, but if (hypothetically speaking) she was IN A RAGE squeezing on his NUTS while he was driving, then ANY MAN would do everything in his power to get that painful attack to stop...even beyond sane modes of retaliation. Add the fact that in her rage she might have continued attacking while he tried to defend himself? Many of her bruises (although not all) would actually have been defensive marks from Chris. No innocence there from either party, but Rihanna could have kept up that psychotic attack for several minutes even as Chris tried to get her off him. Rihanna could have been QUITE intense and causing severe pain...even if she only weighed 110 pounds. Judging only from her bruises would be QUITE misleading. <br>  <br>  3. After faking throwing the key out the window, She sat on the car key. In the middle of a fight with someone who she claimed was attacking HER? This isnt someone tryign to kidnap her? this is someone trying to escape from you and you make that IMPOSSIBLE? So she was attacking the man. He stopped the car, and before you know it, you grab the car key and make it impossible for him to leave unless he gets out and walks? This is the 'victim' deliberately escalating rather than seeking egress. By stopping the car Chris Brown began seeking egress. Rihanna had the lawful option to get out if she was legally being attacked. That is not what she chose to do. <br>  <br>  4. She didnt call 911. She faked calls to her personal assistant(s). We don't know where in the fight she did this, but this is also WIERD for someone being 'attacked'. She didnt even claim (in her official statement) to have asked her assistant to come help her. Within her attackers earshot, she PRETENDED to have told the personal assistant to make sure the cops are there when she got home. If Chris was the primary attacker, and the DRIVER who was dropping her home how would this have REALLY made sense? This action doesnt make sense at all. I am not sure how this factors in, but it doesnt FIT in Rihannas story properly. Dr. Gregg House would call this an anomaly. <br>  <br>  OK? So not only is Chris Brown FAR from perfect. The CASE isnt quite perfect either. Its VERY messy. Just remember that she admits that it started with her, when she read a flipping text message.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	I have no use for a guy who beats on women. He should crawl back under the rock where he lives.|`|tBtHiPLGaa	It funny how Chris Brown fans are still supporting him and trying to justified his actions.  I know we all made mistakes but common now how do you get that mad that you beat up someone that madly that you send them to the hospital.  That isn't normal.  I mean if you are getting that angry you need to go to the an angry management class to held that before you do something like what he did.  Man I knew Chris Brown had some die hard fans, but man I didn't know that ya were that much in love with him.  All I'm going to say is if your man beat you so hard that you had to go to the hospital don't get mad since everyone make those kind of mistakes.|`|AA11768475	not perfect is forgetting your anniversary, not perfect is ignoring your girl when you are glued to the tube watching the big game, not perfect is leaving the seat up on the toilet, not perfect is not being able to cook, not perfect is not liking kids, not perfect is a lot of things.  But beating up your girl is not human, and not something you should forgive lightly if at all.  Let's try this phrase out "Yeah my boyfriend is pretty awesome, he's charming, buys me lots of jewelry, is a famous singer, unfortunately though he's not perfect, he beat's me up on occasion, but that's ok cause he's a good guy most of the time..."  What the hell?  NOT PERFECT is the term you just described what chris brown did, and just to be clear, this isn't strictly about them, it is NEVER ok regardless of your celebrity status.  It does not make it worse because he is a celebrity, but he doesn't deserve the fame and money after what he's done, and anyone else that hits their girlfriends I would also spit on with disgust.|`|do8pdlluaa	I can't believe what he did to her.

There's no confusion there. But from the way that scene was described, I highly doubt that his actions towards Rhianna's well being, were a "mistake". And if he is justified for what he did just because of his fame and physical appearance, maybe we can learn to justify all abuse towards innocent people. It'll just be another issue society can look over and then have a good nights sleep.......

AA12390047	Kendall doesn't know Zach shot Josh.  It's uncharacteristic of her not to ask how Josh died.  The old Kendall would never have settled for "it was an accident" which is what Erica told her.  But everything was thrown at Kendall the minute she woke up from her coma - that Bianca had a baby and Zach was the donor, etc.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	No, she hasn't questioned why he died yet. I can see why her family wouldn't have told her, but you're right, why hasn't Ryan?|`|9e2edc13bc584b5dbeead19cad26ffb1aa	No she doesn't know yet but when she does the you know what is going to hit the fan for sure.|`|YIcBd569aa	I wondered that myself, did the writers actually think we would'nt wonder about this unresolved little detail? maybe it will come out after "spoiler alert"<br>  <br>  <br>  kendall and ryan get together, I am told in a spoiler that kendall and ryan become a couple.|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	Oh my god, I didn't even think about that!<br>  I don't think so!<br>  OOOOO I fell an explanation coming on.<br>  Maybe the writers forgot or something. Kinda like they droped the whole, Kathy trying to kill Krystal deal.lol|`|NGNeT3rYaa	No, she never asked and they never told her. only that he was in an accidnet.|`|xnVXaYT8aa	kendall has no idea that zach killed josh, which I DONT understand....why would kendall not ask who shot him???? it doesnt make any sense, especially because kendall is the nosiest person in pine valley. she would be hell bent over getting revenge on whoever shot josh, i mean its kendall for sh*ts sake!! i dont get what the writers were thinking, not mentioning it at all. i guess maybe they figure kendall and zach have enough going on right now?....but sheesh, yeah im as lost as you are|`|YE8SNy0Xaa	Kendall doesn't know yet.  When they told her Josh died and they gave her his heart, Erica just said there was an "accident".  And Kendall never questioned it.  She had just come out of her coma.|`|SpgQhRmbaa	No, not yet|`|ADBMrG87aa	No one has bothered to tell Kendall that Zack killed Josh and that the beating heart inside of Kendall came from Josh.  I guess they thought it would be too much for Kendall in such a weak state just coming out of a coma and heart surgery to handle such news but c'mon, she's healed up and having sex now with Zach; why isn't Kendall prying for information about her donated heart or how exactly did Josh die?!  How come Ryan who's hellbent on making Zack pay for his loss of Greenlee blabbing from the rooftop about the Josh shooting?!  Let's see if Ryan is going to tell Kendall and if that will be last straw that ends her marriage to Zack and drive her into Ryan's arms.<br>  <br>  (\__/)<br>  (='.'=)<br>  (")-(")<br>  Sweetie

KH3kbRjgaa	Different than the Ascendant, the Descendant it is actually directly across from the ascendant in the chart, in the Seventh House of Relationships, Partners, and Marriage. It is always the opposite sign of your rising sign.<br>  <br>  The Aries influence on the seventh house denotes a pairing with someone expressing assertiveness. It's strange that such an easygoing person is attracted to partners that are energetic, aggressive, sexy, innovative, and pioneering. It is probably good for you to have the kind of partner that is not deterred by obstacles. Someone to do the fighting for you. Yet this doesn't mean you are likely to be dominated in the process. When your sense of justice is offended, you don't take it sitting down. Oddly enough, as much as you love harmony and peace, conflict may mark many of your relationships, perhaps including your marriage(s).

I suppose it wouldn't be the most terrible thing to change for the movie, but it's a big move. Understanding the similarities between the two is enough.

nZCT32XCaa	That is from the iMDB FAQ:<br>  <br>  "The "bear scene" in The Shining occurs as Wendy is running through the hotel after assisting Danny to escape from the bathroom window. As she ascends a stairwell, she comes to an open door and she looks in, where she sees two shapes on a bed. As if sensing her, the shapes stop what they are doing and turn to look at her, revealing themselves to be two men. One is wearing a bear suit with the buttocks removed; the other is in a tuxedo, and from the position they were in when Wendy first saw them, it is likely that the man in the bear suit was performing fellatio on the man in the tuxedo.<br>  <br>  Like the woman in room 237, this mysterious scene is explained in the novel, but not in the film. At one point in the novel, Jack is dancing with a woman at a masque ball during the 1920s, and he notices a young man wearing a dog mask and behaving like a dog for the amusement of a tall, bald man. This bald man is the man in the tuxedo later seen by Wendy. The woman explains to Jack that his name is Horace Derwent, a former owner of the hotel, and an eccentric Howard Hughes type figure who poured over three million into restoring it after WWII. The young man acting like a dog is Roger, a former lover of the bisexual Derwent, with whom he is still in love. According to the woman, Derwent told Roger that "if he came to the masked ball as a doggy, a cute little doggy, he might reconsider;" that is, he might have sex with Roger. Although no actual sex scene between Roger and Derwent is described in the book, such a scene does seem to take place in Kubrick's film, albeit obliquely. "<br>  <br>  But to say the truth, it's quiet enough to consider it as one of the creepy, bizarre visions that the family has among all their others.<br>  It creeps you out, makes you ask questions like you asked us, and is one of the images you can't get out of your head for some time after watching the film.|`|sZMa0s7Baa	Lol I couldn't figure it out either.

That's the point of the film.<br>  <br>  I found the film to be a bit meandering in it's story, too, but not a waste of time.

bsnnEsp5aa	I think you will like ::<br>  <br>  SPECIAL A (highly recommended) (romance, comedy, high school)<br>  Ever since their first meeting at six years old, Hikari Hanazono has struggled to defeat her rival Kei Takashima at anything, whether it be athletics or academics. To date she has proven unsuccessful, resulting in Kei constantly referring to her as "second place." In reality, Kei has been in love with Hikari for quite some time, but Hikari remains completely oblivious to the fact. Now, as the top two students in a prestigious academy, the duo continues their long-running competition as part of the school's elite class of seven, the Special A. Will Hikari ever surpass Kei... or realize that he loves her?<br>  <br>  HANBUN NO TSUKI GA NOBORU SORA (highly recommended) (romance, drama)<br>  Yuichi is a teenage boy who was diagnosed with hepatitis; and as staying at the hospital is boring, he often sneaks out at night to hang out with his friends. However, each time he is caught by the slightly sadistic nurse Akiko, he just prolongs his stay at the hospital. After his most recent escape, instead of striking a punch or kick at Yuichi, Akiko says that she'll overlook his sneak outs if he becomes friends with 17-year-old Rika, another hospital resident. Rika doesn't open up to him at first, but she has her reasons: she has a weak heart; and though she may come off as selfish and rude, Yuichi looks beyond the surface to help both of them enjoy what life has to offer.<br>  <br>  KARE KANO (highly recommended) (drama, romance, comedy, high school)<br>  Yukino had it all. Brilliant, athletic, popular and pretty, she was the perfect school girl with many friends and admirers. But then one fateful day she met her match: a handsome young man named Arima. Now, not only is he beating her at her own game, she's becoming more and more dismayed to learn that she's developing her first real feelings of romance. Can Yukino maintain her model student appearance, or will love ruin all her plans?<br>  <br>  CLANNAD (highly recommended) (romance, comedy, drama, harem, high school)<br>  Tomoya Okazaki is a third-year high school student who is generally bored with life and doesn't take his studies, future, or anything else seriously. One day, however, he meets a lonely-looking girl in the school courtyard, Nagisa Furukawa. She explains to him the source of her loneliness: she had missed a lot of the previous school year and thus is repeating her third year; everybody that she knew has already graduated, and she is lonely. Tomoya is rather indifferent at first, but decides that he has nothing better to do and spends increasingly more time helping Nagisa restore the school drama club. As his relationship with Nagisa grows, Tomoya begins to open up to various other people around the school as well...<br>  <br>  AISHITERUZE BABY (romance, slice of life, drama, high school)<br>  Whenever Kippei is at school, he has one thing on the mind: girls. From skipping class to cheesy lines, he'll do anything it takes to reel the ladies in, though he never seems to find the right person. But the bachelor lifestyle is soon to change when young Yuzuyu enters the picture. This five-year-old cutie has been abandoned by her mother, and is to be taken care of by none other than Kippei! Unfortunately for the both of them, Kippei has no experience raising a child, so the learning curve will be quite steep...<br>  <br>  BOKURA GA ITA (drama, romance, love triangle, high school)<br>  Yano Motoharu is the most popular guy in class, the school’s basketball ace, and highly charismatic to boot! No wonder Nanami Takahashi can’t resist falling in love with him. When Yano returns Nana’s feelings, things seem too good to be true and the two begin a relationship; but Yano has a contradictory personality which confuses Nana most of the time. On top of that, tragic events in Yano’s past won’t stop haunting their relationship. Unable to halt their passionate feelings, are Yano and Nana heading for disaster or can they save each other from irreparable hurt?<br>  <br>  PEACH GIRL (Highly recommended) (drama, romance, love triangle, high school)<br>  Momo is loud, shallow, a player, a betrayer, and one to best stay away from -- or at least, that's the misconception people have when they see her makeup, bleached hair and suntanned skin. In reality, Momo just wants the same friends, hobbies and crushes any girl her age would like. However, when her only friend starts spreading rumours about her, her boyfriend starts to doubt her, and the most popular boy in school starts to take a more then friendly interest in her, she'll have much more to worry about than just her appearance!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D|`|Q5FYrU9vaa	Ouran high school host club<br>  Fruits basket\<br>  Vampire knight<br>  Love hina <br>  Lovely Complex<br>  Ichigo 100%<br>  Karin<br>  Yamato nadeshiko shichi henge|`|pgIcxpiaaa	why dont you try Vampire Knight?

Cj2uorAeaa	i think jiraiya meant that his father live on in naruto (they're identical)<br>  <br>  it would be cool if he was alive though, he was the coolest hokage that ever hokaged|`|u3D8MAGOaa	.....-_- yondaime hokage is dead it is stated in the manga and anime....sandaime did not die from orochimaru's sword....the sword weakened him and stopped him from fully taking out orochimaru's soul. <br>  It was the rurouni jutsu shiki fuujin death god that took his soul as payment for taking orochimaru's arms.<br>  seals weaken over time...and yes the death god did come out it was stated by sandaime that rurouni jutsu shiki fuujin was used by yondaime to seal the fox in naruto.|`|B0VtzbGAaa	He is dead, the reason the third hokage did not seal all of Orochimaru is because he did not have the strength. But the forth was able to seal all of the Fox's dark chakra leaving only the good sealed in Naruto. Go back and read the manga and you will see. I do think that Naruto's mom is still alive but will see. Jiraiya died alone and did not talk to Naruto about his father, Naruto still does not know his father was the forth.|`|3ERx4opSaa	no, the fourth used the death reaper seal jutsu, which sacrifices the users and the targets soul to the death god, forever in combat within its belly. even though the death god didnt appear in the first episode, minato namikaze is dead, the leaf held a funeral for him, and sculpted his head in the cliff next to sarutobi's. People dont die and vanish in naruto lol.<br>  <br>  by the way when jiraiya said he lives on, its a theoretical term widley used when someone dies and they keep watch over us.
CQX3TAIoaa	1) It's a safe bet that if he summoned 3 bodies, and if there have only been four Hokages, and two were just resurrected, then the last one would be the Fourth. [I think it said Fourth on the box as well. Can't remember]<br>  <br>  2) What does how the Third die have to do with the 4th?<br>  <br>  3) Does it? I highly doubt that. You probably just misinterpreted it.<br>  <br>  4) The season opening means nothing. The makers of the anime just probably thought they could pick up on the hype around the 4th, and stuck him in there.<br>  <br>  I'm stopping here. You can have all the theories that you want, but it's pretty much a consensus that he is dead. And you posted a similar question, which makes me feel that I wasted my time on this.|`|ZwWMGiEPaa	I'm gonna quote some bleach for you.<br>  <br>  Ichigo: "That's some twisted logic."<br>  Ishida: "I perfer to call it a Lupe Pole."|`|24BDyLKOaa	I think he is dead. But, what I would like to know is why no one will tell Naruto that the 4th is his dad...|`|AA11189678	Yes he is|`|u3D8MAGOaa	sandaime WAS NOT KILLED by orochimaru's sword his SOUL was consumed by the death god as payment for his summoning.<br>  THEREFORE Yondaime is dead....<br>  also the animators can put whatever they want in op's and ed's so if yondaime is in one then so what?|`|3ERx4opSaa	no, Minato Namikaze or the fourth hokage used the death reaper seal jutsu, which sacrifices your soul to the death god, so absolutley no chance in him being alive.<br>  <br>  and just so you know the blond haired pain isnt pains real body, thats just yahikos body, nagato is controlling it from a mountain in chapter 436.

xTioPxaVaa	As long as you're care and don't force anything, then it should be OK to remove the pickguard for a short period of time.  Don't leave it off for long, because those older pickguards will start to shrink very quickly, and you won't be able to re-attach it.<br>  <br>  That all said, it would be very unusual for a serial number to be located there.  Not impossible though.<br>  <br>  Remember, if the pickguard doesn't want to come off, don't force it.

zy5qcc0Raa	In an alternate 1985 America, costumed superheroes are part of the fabric of everyday society, and the "Doomsday Clock" - which charts the USA's tension with the Soviet Union - is permanently set at five minutes to midnight. When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the washed-up but no less determined masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion - a ragtag group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers - Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity...but who is watching the watchmen?|`|nsnyGZOtaa	<a href="http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1808406490/info">http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1808406490...</a>|`|g0SLq7XHaa	watchmen is set in an alternate reality in the year 1985 a super hero hit squad killed a hero called the comedian and his pals go and find the people who kill him<br>  <br>  thats really all i can tell you without giving anything away.

The monster is attacking everything yet the camera is filming in the other direction, and all you here is the characters yelling eachothers names the whole time.

72ca94221fb41686deefdedf3bbb6bf7aa	Dr. Manhattan (the glowing blue guy) is naked throughout the movie (except for this one part where hes actually wearing a tux) . there was only one sex scene that was like "whoa" where they were both naked and you see boobs, penis and the whole shabang lol. theres also this other part, in the opening scene, where you see two girls make out but its not that bad.  the only thing that was a tad bit awkward was the blue guys naked penis hanging out lol.|`|v61VWKMDaa	Yes.

4Vmlf902aa	YES!! I get up at 5:30, but really I could get up at 6:00. But I get up early, so I can have more time to listen to music. When i'm on the bus I listen to my music, and I don't turn it off till school starts. When school ends, the first thing I do is pop in my headphones. When I get home i'm still listening to my music, and I get on YouTube. I do this till I go to bed, and stop when doing hw. On weekends it's even worse!! I'm listening to music right now, lol. I can control it. It's just that most of the time my friends never come out, so I have nothing better to do. Also on days like this, when it's snowing out, i'm stuck at home with nothing to do, but listen to music and get on Y!A.|`|oKRbe6XYaa	Maybe you're just that into music. Well everyone has their favorites, just like collecting things.<br>  I'm not that into music though, I'm more into makeup & education.(*_*)|`|gpON465Iaa	Yes, it is possible and can be very expensive.

You can probably lol.|`|FrNUIdF4aa	I don't think that you can physically be addicted to music but mentally I think that you could get so used to listening to music that you fell that it is a part of you that you can't live without.|`|HszCjOCFaa	there's a diff. between being addicted to CONSUMING and loving music (doesn't everyone?) and actually being able to PLAY it.<br>  <br>  When people say "music is my life" i would rather they mean it, and be able to make it.<br>  <br>  So i say if you ask yourself this question, NO|`|zy8oQSPpaa	well biologically speaking no it is not possible to be physically addicted to music. but mentally i suppose you could get addicted to it yes|`|ShHOQXQbaa	yes its possible!

They had no choice. But I like both of them. The problem is though, that nobody is really aware of why they asked the singer from Bless the Fall to join.

In monica's first job in season 1, she is talking to a black colleague, the lady who sent chandler to tulsa was black, when joey is working in ross' museum there is black lady in blue blazer and a black man in a white coat, when monica makes sweets for people in the building a man comes down who is black and says they were like little drops of heaven, when joey is pretending to own a porche a black man comes up to him and asks him some questions about it. <br>  <br>  There are many, MANY other examples as well. shows are not made to reflect demographics, they just receive criticism if they don't except black sitcoms for some reason. <br>  <br>  people are just jealous that a show that had soooo much success and was known as the second best sitcom of all time (behind seinfeld) was so a white sitcom! thats how i see it. <br>  <br>  I watched friends because it made me laugh, and nothing else, i watched my wife and kids becuase it made me laugh, nothing else, i watched the class becuase it made me laugh, nothing else, i watched half and half, all of us, two and a half men becuase IT MADE ME LAUGH i enjoyed it, thats why i watched it. not becuase of its cast, crew, demographics etc!!|`|RZ1vSt9kaa	Thats so raven <br>  <br>  raven black<br>  <br>  eddie black<br>  <br>  ....chelsea  white<br>  <br>  plus they were all friend b4 they did the show<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  tell the people that did the casting sorry but they have to pick good actor what if there is no good black people that want to audition<br>  <br>  <br>  and for god sake if you think its racist dont wach it|`|MxAy96itaa	These are the jackasses along time ago siad that Bugs Bunny was gay because he kisses Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, Donald Duck.

d02c709e184c7a1f7828d9e3e00c32b4aa	That's easy.  Future bands will take their cue from the motion picture industry.  Groups like the Rolling Stones will sell their naming rights to the highest bidder so that we'll have Rolling Stones II, III, and IV.  I mean it's not like Hollywood bothers to make new original movies either so this way we can further the shortage of creativity.  So not only won’t we need to tax our brains anymore but also it will put an end to all the stupid names like Tokyo Hotel and Red Jumpsuit Apparatus.  And who knows?  Metallica II might even be better than the current version.|`|N62uLMf3aa	my super future band's name will definitely have a number.|`|4bc3ee931fca2067bef8aafb614f2089aa	I think in the future people will be more creative.|`|QhJ8YiLhaa	Nah, my band has a great name.

rooi4xIpaa	The singing, was pretty darned good.  It just needs a little bit more support.  That is why it is slightly flat.<br>  <br>  In voice you have to have something called breath support and control.  It is of great importance that you follow the four step process when breathing for singing.  This needs explanation:<br>  <br>  In life we have a three step process:<br>  1. We breath in.<br>  2. We breath out.<br>  3.  We wait for our next time to breath.<br>  <br>  In singing, however, there is a fourth step that help support the breath:<br>  1. We breath in (preferably deeper than in real life..pretend to smell a flower and you will know what a deep breath feels like)<br>  2. YOU SUSPEND YOUR BREATH<br>  3. You breath out (or sing)<br>  4. You wait until our next time to breath (or when the song requires to breath again)<br>  <br>  This step 2 is extremely important as it sets up a mechanism between your diaphragm and your inner abdominal muscles.  Now, in voice, you should never feel excessive tension, however when you sing you should feel "working" tension down in your diaphragm and abs.<br>  <br>  To feel the working tension singled out, try laughing like Santa.  When you "ho, ho, ho" you will notice you pushing down there in pulses.  If you don't then you aren't supporting that properly either.<br>  <br>  Another thing you might try doing is push out on your toosh.  It may seem strange, but some people hold too much tension down there and not enough in the appropriate place.  It will cause the sound to become more vibrant.<br>  <br>  So in short, you need to feel a little more breath support down there.  You are using too much air to create the sound causing a breathy sound and instead need to allow more vibrant and energetic air to pass through your vocal folds.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|904ae5dce32eb8e4afcdab5615aca68daa	in all honesty i thought you were singin in german at first|`|ea073069c581a3e342f2f7ec101708f1aa	You're fine.

America has many from many different cultures and walks of life.  Japan is monotonous - they are all the same, from the same family. America is a melting pot.  Japan is pure.  American things that are better than Japanese are fashion, music and entertainment, lively business environment, greater wealth, bigger homes, less crowded, more nature and wildlife, more diversity from coast to coast.|`|i5MiFhMyaa	What America has that Japan doesn't<br>  <br>  Lots of land<br>  Lots of natural resources<br>  Borders <br>  Lots of people<br>  Way more crime, especially violent crime than Japan<br>  <br>  Better things in America<br>  <br>  - Innovation. Americans and Europeans come up with the new ideas, products, concepts. Asians come along and build them for less and better.<br>  <br>  - Movies, music. Japanese music and movies are great too. Americans have more budget, and people. Hence they can put out more quantity, and more "spectacular" movies than most other nations. Music - the world listens to American top 40. Ever hear European radio? That will blow American "all-the-same" radio away.|`|6t76bgS3aa	I've never been to Japan but I think both countries have their own charm.  I'm a pretty American guy, I drive a pickup, listen to country music, like whiskey, Marlboros and all the hot American women ... I'm also pretty big on the Constitution.  It wouldn't be the same in Japan.  But to Japanese people, I'm sure Japan is pretty cool.

And while I was under the water my bikini bottoms came off and my friend BF did a face plant on my bare butt!!!<br>  <br>  OMG!! I tried to talk to him saying "uh, what a coincidence!, me, you . . . my butt!" and I paused "did I just say that?"<br>  <br>  every thing between the 3 of us was just quiet for at least 1 hour.<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  We had 70's night at my school, and I wa sin year 7 and so I didn;t know whatw as going on and what we were going to have to do and so, I grabbed my arm and said "what the hell is going on I feel like an idiot" she was holding a microphone and so everyone heard it.<br>  I felt like an idiot.<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  I was with my friend and her BF (yes the same BF that face planted into my butt) and we were at the movies, my crush came in and we went to sit up the top.<br>  As my crush sat down, my friends BF said to me "hey Jen stop" I turned out I was in such a dreamland of love (lol) was leaning over the next rail of seats.<br>  I sat up and (oh, i forgot to say that infront of us was a long wide rail down to the front of the room) and so when we got up, (the movie wasn't over, we just hated it) I tipped over my friends foot and landed on the wide rail and when my friend and her BF tried ot help me they accidently let go and I went sliding down the rail!<br>  I was screaming, really loud, saying things like "OMG help me!! aug!!"<br>  I hit the bottom and fell off the side and I got up to see everyone laughing their butts off.<br>  <br>  OMG and there are SO many more embarrassing moments but it would take a book to list them all.<br>  <br>  literally

0XbyDBQLaa	Flute.<br>  <br>  I've been playing for eight years, and I'm absolutely in love. It's an awesome instrument.<br>  <br>  Whoo, eight years, baby! I'm also learning how to play marimba (I'm in our school's percussion lab) and oboe.<br>  <br>  And, I'm drum major!<br>  <br>  I love music, anything and everything about it. :)) <3|`|IG2Kkpjzaa	I play euphonium. I love it sooooo much! A lot of people in band don't practice and stuff but I love it too much to give it up. Our teacher's cool though, to people who actually try<br>  <br>  : )|`|E0Lybd6Vaa	I'm an oboe major in music school so obviously I live the life of a musician every single day. When marching season comes around I play the marimba and you're right- PLaying beats simply conducting or walking with your band. In music school it's classes 8AM-8PM straight, Plus weekends and performances. <br>  <br>  So yeah- I major in it so I kinda have a drive for it.|`|f9dd67eaef69a933cf139fbcfcb257e8aa	Flute, it's so awesome all my friends are in band one of the reason i would never quit!
FIWB7Dgtaa	o my gosh DRAMA! it is soo good!!!|`|R4jDg5Ksaa	I Do! I just went to cwtv.com last night to catch the previews for the next episode and I'm having completely mixed emotions on where it's going. I love this show though!|`|FBMZ388oaa	ME! <br>  Its my favorite show, plus James Lafferty (Nathan)<br>  is super super sexy(:|`|5OU2wdBvaa	I dooo!  I prefer the high school episodes.  I thought beginning of season 5 was crappy but then it got good.  And then series 6 was good up until Brooke found out who attacked her and she stood up to him.  And then when that storyline was over, the show IMO got really boring =/  Anyone else agree?  There's barely been a storyline.  The only good thing is seeing Nathan and Lucas and just something I heard (Possible spoiler if true so stop reading if you don't wanna know) Lucas and Peyton might be leaving! =O<br>  <br>  I hope something good happens soon and they have a little less love storylines and more shocking ones.  Bring back psycho Derek or something.<br>  <br>  But anyway, I still love the show despite my moaning =P|`|LybMYXsLaa	Love the show! Plus I think Jamie is a doll!!|`|83pyUYI4aa	me omg i love one tree hill!!!!=]]

They are funny and kind and that's what appeals to young girls! Espechially as they are known to be very polite and gentleman like and that's rare in guys, let's be honest!<br>  <br>  I'm not too sure about HSM?<br>  Maybe it's just because the songs are catchy and Zac Efron is hot?|`|n8Aycz6Gaa	I think that the Jonas Brothers are amazing. The reason I think this is because of their music. I love the lyrics to their songs. And I'm proud to be a fan. My favorite songs are Hello Beautiful, Please Be Mine, and Sorry. Those songs are amazing. I am a huge fan of them.|`|bi2kmQxUaa	nothing!!!<br>  :)
mUm8PCRzaa	its a crappy movie and yes there's lots of nudity.<br>  <br>  In an early scene, one of the campers flashes her boyfriend. They later have sex in a tent, which can't really be seen. Most of the scene, you only see their shadows from outside of the tent.<br>  <br>  There is also a wakeboarding scene. The female wakeboarder is topless, but the scene is pretty short.<br>  <br>  There is a scene where a man is looking at a porno magazine. The centerfold is visible for a few seconds, then you see him lick the crotch area of the picture.<br>  <br>  There is another sex scene later on. Bare breasts and butt shown throughout that scene.|`|hWicwGUmaa	I have not seen the new Friday The 13th, but i know that if you were scared of Prom Night, then this movie is definitely not for you. Prom Night is one of the most un scary scary movies i have ever seen.|`|ewCxwtotaa	theres nudity in it it was the worst 10 dollars I ever spent not worth seeing the movie sucks jason doesnt die even after they kill him in the movie ,he comes back at the end of the movie|`|6mcc8U79aa	Okay, I haven't seen the movie... but from what I've heard there is a lot of sexual content. Apparently it's a very rude movie towards women, and coming from many friends of mine "It sucks." "It isn't worth seeing" "We were cracking jokes the whole time." I suggest don't bother seeing it, you won't be scared.

Y!A probably wrongly sent you here as it seems to send EVERY question with the word' piano' in it to the classical section (how very odd!).
