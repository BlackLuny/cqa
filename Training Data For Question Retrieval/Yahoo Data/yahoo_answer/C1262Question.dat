I know forecasting isn't an exact science but sometimes I think that if their forecasters actually looked out of the window they would at least have the gumption to update a forecast for Right Now so that their version doesn't look so amateurishly at odds with what's going on outside.    The BBC is forecasting sunny weather for tomorrow and Saturday - quite the opposite of the Met Office, which reckons rain and high winds will spread across the country. Who should I believe? Or should I just go out and see whether the cows are lying down in the fields, cos it seems like the old fashioned forecasting methods are just as good as any of this high-tech nonsense.

20090227040545AAtSDMZ	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	How do I solve this? [Chemistry]?	When chlorine gas is used as a disinfectant in swimming pools it is possible to add too much.  One technique to remove the excess chlorine is to add an aqueous solution of sodium thiosulphate (Na2S2O2) which reacts with the chlorine to produce sulphate ions, chloride ions and hydrogen ions.      Give the change in oxidation number of sulphur and chlorine in this reaction.   Sulphur:  from thiosulphate to sulphate   Chlorine:  from chlorine to chloride      Hence, write a balanced ionic equation for the reaction between chlorine and sodium thiosulphate.      [I tried solving it but it seems that I'm doing something wrong.  Any help is appreciated.]

I went to see an esthetician 2 months ago and had microdermabrasion and then lam probe done on my face. The lam probe is supposed to be a non invasive way to remove millia, cholesterol deposits, hyper pigmentation, minor skin irregularities.      Anyway, it left me with 2-3mm scars all over my face as well as several 2-3 mm areas where there is a few layers of skin missing . (I'm not deformed but it REALLY bothers me). I did some research and found out 1) Lam probe is only FDA approved for use as a epilator (hair removal, she used it "off-label". 2) In my state it is outside of her scope of practice to do this procedure on me (She is not licensed to do it). 3)The only way she could have legal done this was under the supervision of a physician (she owns her own skin care clinic, no MD on site or involved) I live in Denver, CO.

The student failed to study for the   test and is guessing at random on each question. Suppose that each question has four possible   answers (only one of which is correct). Let X be the number of questions that the student answers   incorrectly.   a) Note that X describes a binomial random variable. What are the values of n and p?   b) If the student answers fewer than six questions correctly, he will fail the test. Determine the   probability that the student fails the test.   c) Determine the mean and standard deviation of X.

One of them is described as the "continuous" compound formula. It said that it is used when something compounds immeasurably often, however an example was given using a bank account. Both formulas seem to be able to be used for bank interest problems. The continuous compound formula seems easier to use and uses the natural (e) base. There must be a difference between the two formulas?

I have always liked to solve things and have been very good at science in general. I can be very creative and enjoy designing things. I am also very good with computers. I have no idea what I want to do with my life though. I have considered architect, interior designer, biochemical researcher, forensic scientist (LOVED the course i took on it), doctor, veternarian, computer specialist... It's just so hard to choose because idk what any of these jobs entail.      - Does anyone know of any jobs that use all these skills?   - How did you choose what you wanted to do in life?   - If you are someone that has one of these jobs (forensic scientist, biochemist, doctor, computer speicalist, architect, interior designer), what is it like to work in that field?      Im just really confused and wish i knew more about what i wanted to do in life so i dont waste $50,000 a year at this private college I am attending. I am also pretty sure I am going to grad school so there will be requirements ik i will have to take at my undergraduate college.       Any advice would greatly be appreciated...

I want to put an electrical motor on a bicycle; but I want this electrical motor to be able to charge by either plugging it into a socket, or by peddling (either backwards or forewords).  Would I have to obtain a regular DC motor (or AC, I'm not sure) and add some kind of crank generator to it?  Any help will be much appreciated.

One is getting bigger than the other which I now know that one is female and the other is male. The Male baby well I'm just worried that the Female is going to eat him or something. I'm a little worried about him cause he doesn't seem like he is growing a lot and he hides a lot too. I'm not sure if he is sick or just having a hard time growing? But it doesn't seem like the Female minds him around and well she doesn't seem to really attack the little guy. I just want to make sure the Male will be fine and how long until he actually starts to get bigger in size. He just skinny and kinda wide but not as much as the Female one. Just an addition I have had these Eels both in the same tank and they been living together ever since I got them from the Pet store. It's been about 2-3 months also. Thank you for anyone that can answer this for me.

20090305093949AAsDyuo	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Increasing the angle between three points?	In a Molecular Dynamics simulation, I have three atoms (points) in space, A, B and C, and I know the Euclidean coordinates of each one; xA, yA, zA, xB, yB, zB, xC, yC, zC.      I can calculate the ABC angle (lets call it Theta) using the formula:   Theta = arccos [(AB^2+BC^2-AC^2) / (2*AB*BC)]      Now then, this angle should be 120 degrees. If it's not, I must apply a force to A and C, so they move more apart. This force is numerically calculated (by differentiating a potential of the form of K * (Theta-120)^2).      After I calculated the force (numerically), how do I calculate the Fx, Fy, Fz forces applied to atom A, and to atom C? The requirement is that atoms A B C stay in the same (initial) plane, and the lengths AB and BC remain the same.

20090305101953AA7J1hv	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Please help with chemistry i really need help and i am struggling in this course?	1. Which of the following conditions occurs as a liquid freezes?              Kinetic energy of the liquid molecules exceeds the strength of the intermolecular forces.              Kinetic energy of the liquid molecules equals the strength of the intermolecular forces.              Strengths of intermolecular forces of the liquid molecules exceed the kinetic energy of the molecules.            2. Two pots are at the same atmospheric pressure, but one has a lid on it. The pressure above the liquid in pot A is 115 kPa, while the pressure above pot B is 102 kPa. Which pot will boil at a higher temperature?              Pot A will boil at a higher temperature.              Pot B will boil at a higher temperature.              Both pots boil at the same temperature.              The pressure has no effect on boiling point.            3. The molecular masses of four substances are as follows: A = 16, B = 58, C = 86, D = 116. Which substance will have the lowest boiling point?              A              B              C              D            4.

20090305102000AAUmAtl	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	I need help on my maths?	Your Open QuestionShow me another ?    I need help with my maths?   We had to do a maths investigation and i've been ill which has given me more time but when i compared answers i'd done it all wrong so i need to redo mine but i don't really understand it. Could someone explain how to do a few shapes?      We had to find the area of 1,3,4,5,6,7 and 8 sided shapes when we had 1000m of fencing so it would be   Circle 1000m.   Triangle 3sides 333m per side   Square 4sides 250m   Pentagon 200m, Hexagon 167m, Septagon(?) 142m, Octagon 125m    The area had to be in m2(meteres squared)    The workings would be the shape split into triangles according to the number of side with 360degrees divided by the no. of sides. Split one of those so its right angled triangle with the length halved. then tan came into it which confused me and im not sure about Area= 1/2 *b*h does it mean 0.5 or half the number you get from tan? im confused   we did 2 in the lesson and the ones i've done are completly different, we got 481,430m2 for triangle and 62,500m2 for square i did pentagon got 68,810m2 and 1030,176 for hexagon which is what makes me think i went wrong.      Can someone explain it to me? Sorry if its hard to follow...
20090305102030AAQ8bHC	Science & Mathematics;Weather	Where can I find a weather map (synoptic cart) for February's snow?	Hi   Is some sort of online archive for recent weather charts? I need one for the 1st Feb which includes pressure isobars and associated fronts - the ones found in The Times and on the BBC.      I really want to understand what caused that snow we had in the UK in early February, as an A level Geographer. I understand there was a low centred over London on the 1st of Feb, and the was a Pc and Tm air mass.         Thank you for your help, I've turned google upside down through searching so it seems!

20090305083901AA6IygZ	Science & Mathematics;Geography	How did Gerhard Mercator make such an accurate atlas?	Considering that he couldn't rely on voyageurs because of their contradictions, knowing that previous maps were inaccurate and that he couldn't have seen the earth from above, was his vast knowledge on Mathematics and Astronomy enough to help him calculate where the places were? Was the Bible also very helpful? I just don't understand how he did it, even with all his skills ...how can someone make an atlas with such accuracy at that time?  I already know about the Mercator Projection. He must have traveled very often but still, I'm puzzled because even if he traveled he only had a ground view of the earth, not a satellite view of it to base on. The answer may be obvious but I just can't see it. I hope this makes sense.    Thanks in advance.
