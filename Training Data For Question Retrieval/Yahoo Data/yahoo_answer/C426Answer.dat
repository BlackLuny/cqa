V0ltn3Qkaa	there is nothing difficult about converting the pool heater from lp to natural gas. that is no harder than to convert a furnace over from one to the other. the BIG thing would be to find the proper natural gas conversion kit. and by PROPER i mean from the manufacture or distributor of what ever brand your pool heater is. and the proper one for your specific model & serial number of heater.|`|jVEVDRGIaa	the wholesale cost of parts to do convsersion is about 200-250
d94f99ad1710d80ab4587d8db787acb3aa	Ruby, <br>           I glaze in glass all the time in restortion work and will tell you that $70 is ridiculous for what would take a seasoned glazer 5 minutes to do.<br>  <br>  Look, reseting and glazing this is easy.  Get a box of what's called push points (little fasteners that hold the glass into the frame while you glaze), a quart can of #33 Glazing which is available in just about any hardware or home center, and a glazing tool which is sold in either store also.<br>  <br>  Set the glass and push the points into the wood frame to hold the glass firmly in place.  Now here's the trick - (with a pail of water handy to dip the glazing tool and hands into to keep the putty from sticking) use the tool to apply and mould the putty into the frame and seal the window.  The water also allows you to work the putty into a slick smooth finish also. Once you start glazing and get the feel of it - it's easy.  Take a razor knife and trim any excess.  You don't need a suction cup or anything but caution and the materials and tools defined above.<br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.com" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.com</a>|`|944iJNAdaa	I've found this pretty easy to do.  It might cost $10 (I haven't done this for awhile so I'm guessing at the price) for the glass setting compound, and I think a putty knife makes it easier, and you might want some glass-setting points (I've often ignored that part with no problem, but others recommend this).  I doubt the glass costs more than $10, so even if you broke one, how much are you really risking here?  Besides, I almost never have broke one, and I've done this quite a few times.  I never used a glass suction holder, either.  Unless this is a really big piece of glass, I think someone is trying to make this job sound harder than it really is.  $75 would go a long ways towards buying a complete new window instead, and that would have thermal-pane windows, too.|`|2uZXCyeBaa	$75 is not unreasonable for someone to drive to your home, perform a service that may or may not only take a few minutes, and then drive back to his or her office.

If you have a chair rail, there should be the same space between the bottom and the rail as there is between the top and the crown/ceiling.  Spaces more than 12" top and bottom or 24" side to side look funny, so keep that in mind as you lay them out.  If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail me.

Any questions you can e mail me thru my avatar and check my qualifications there  GL|`|wj8FNY7Vaa	If i am understanding you, you are saying your wall tiles will not overlap the lip of the drain tray.   Shower trays are designed to allow tiles to overlap the edge of the drain tray.  Sometimes this means you have to cut away the wallboard so the drain tray can fit tightly into the corner.<br>  <br>  You are usually supposed to leave an 1/8" gap between the bottom of your tiles and the tray bottom.  This should mean that the lip is behind the tiles for about 7/8". <br>  <br>  If you want a more watertight seal you can run a bead of caulk below the tile.  You may need to use pure silicone caulk, read the specs on the drain tray or call the manufacturers help line to see what caulk they recommend.

My guess is that you've got an extra loop of top thread around something -- backlashed around a spool pin, stuck in a slot in the thread spool, extra turn around a guide or something equally hard to spot.<br>  <br>  The fastest cure I know for most sewing machine problems that you can't spot the cause of right away is to pull all the thread out of/off of the machine, give it a quick clean and oiling per the manual (use vacuum and brush, not compressed air for cleaning!) and then rethread, step by step.<br>  If the problem persists, try a new needle, and also inspect the bobbin.|`|EXpaRBsyaa	Your top tension is much too tight.  If you are threaded correctly, and the tension knob is between 4 and 6, make sure the upper thread is not catching on something.  Easiest way to check if it is caught...starting at the first thread guide from the spool, gently pull on the thread as if to pull it from the spool.  No resistance?  Proceed to the next thread guide and repeat.  Resistance?  Check the spool for damage or thread may be wrapped around the spool pin.  Try this all the way down, through the tension, and to the needle.  This usually works for me.|`|6N3yjlXhaa	If you threaded the machine with the presser foot down, the thead cannot drop into the tension mechanism.  When this happens the tension control has no effect on the tension of the thread.<br>  <br>  Lift the presser foot every time you thread or change thread.<br>  <br>  Check the bobbin to be sure the bobbin thread is feeding from the bobbin spool in the correct direction and through the proper guides.<br>  <br>  Set the tension as recommended in the instruction manual.<br>  <br>  Lower the threaded needle, holding onto the tail of the thread and on the uptake, the bobbin thread will come up.  Take the bobbin thread tail and top thread tail under the presser foot and out toward the back of the machine.<br>  <br>  You may have to hold the thread tails as the machine begins to stitch.<br>  <br>  You cannot oil this machine unless the manual indicates you can - most new machines are self lubricating and only a service tech can add the lubricant.

e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	Jeni,<br>  <br>  sometimes lots and lots of rain can wash out seeds, especially if they are small seeds such as lettuce.  Also, since such seeds are planted shallow, lots of rain water can wash them out.  You'll just have to wait until you see some seedlings start to sprout.

Storage furniture allows for more space and lets you become more organized. This way you are not spending so much time with the cleaning process. This helps with also having a place to store throw pillows and extra blankets while not in use. Keeps space clutter free as well. <br>  <br>  Another tip, when cleaning floors put baking soda on rugs for keeping them smelling fresh for longer durations of time.<br>  <br>  Add fabric softener sheets in various drawers to keep clothes and room constantly smelling fresh.<br>  <br>  Use better quality furniture polish and glass cleaners that are lint/dust free, and will hold up to longer durations of time before needing to polish again. Also, use feather dusters that have magnetic qualities to lift lint/dust to prevent spreading dust.<br>  <br>  Fold laundry at night while watching tv, and put clothes away first thing in the morning. Even engage your husband in the folding process. <br>  <br>  Pin matching socks together to spent less time on trying to match pairs up.<br>  <br>  Always begin by making your bed first, this way you have a clean flat surface to put items like clothes oin while finishing your cleaning.<br>  <br>  Lastly, turn on some music while cleaning, It helps to clean to some music, and inspires you. Seems less tedious this way.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Ny8RKDYhaa	Try to work faster.

My only concern would be latent moisture in the below grade basement slab - if you have any water issues - the hydrology will literally pop the epoxy right off of the slab. Check the Armorclad literature they may require a sealer before it goes down or may not warranty basement installations at all.<br>  The only other comment is this is an extremely hard surface, I don't know what you do in your basement, but it could be uncomfortable on your feet and legs.

AA10492848	If it is a Frost Free Freezer (or used to be LOL) then there are two things that can cause this.  The Defrost Timer and the Defrost Heater.  The timer cycles the heater on and off throughout the day to keep frost from accumulating.  Eithr one of these is an easy fix.  You can find the timer at the bottom of the refrigerator in the front or in the back, depending on the model.  Rotate the knob until you hear a CLICK.  then open the freezer to listen for melting ICE........and running water.  If you hear those things, the Timer is bad.  If the ice does NOT melt then the Heater is bad.  If you take your refigerator model number to an appliance parts store, they will sell you the new part.<br>  <br>  If it is NOT a frost free freezer, then you have a gasket issue.  The gasket that seals the freezer form the outside world is broken or misaligned.|`|NyCJu4zpaa	Condenser Coil

I would talk to the manager and see what the policy is for the different suppliers. They might be willing to sell broken merchandise to you for cost or at a lose to avoid the cost of shipping and repair to sell it as a refurbished unit. Good luck.

2nKT9HMNaa	As I remember and if I understand correctly you have a seed, than you should keep it in refrigerator in a sandy soil with a little watering, just warm the soil. In case you need information you may find some on my blog www.garden-bonsai.blogspot.com
Sxlcyua5aa	That is because of shade.   Some grass types can tolerate shade better than others.   St Augustine grass seems to be the best shade tolerant grass for southern lawns.   You need to pay attention to the amount of sun light those areas actually receive.   If it is only for a few hours then no grass will grow under those trees.   If this is the case then you might want to fill those areas with pine straw and bushes to make it look more pleasing to the eye.   It won't hurt to try St Augustine grass first though in one small area to see if it will grow there.   Just keep in mind that St Augustine is a wide blade grass.   If you have bermuda and you put down St Augustine next to it, it might now look too good.   If you have Centipede grass then it would be a great match.   I know several people with Centipede lawns who also have St Augustine grass in their shade areas and their lawns look great.   Lastly, you can always bring in a professional to thin out the branches in the trees to allow more sun light.   But you will have to do this almost every year. Good luck.|`|azypqsphaa	no way, that's weird man

mG1IbUZxaa	Bushfires eat everything in their path, so the first step is to ensure it gets no fuel.<br>  <br>  - Clear your home area of dry leaves. Prune trees, cut grass and clear the gutters of anything inflammable<br>  <br>  - If you store timber, boxes of paint or cartons in your house, move them away to a safe place or dispose them off regularly<br>  <br>  - Have enough water outlets in your house (pumps, tanks, taps w/hoses) and keep protective clothing within easy reach<br>  <br>  - Keep emergency service numbers readily available and pitch for a community effort in preventing bushfires<br>  <br>  - If you live in an area that's prone to bushfires, try including flame-resistant material in the construction of your house. The roof is specially important here.<br>  <br>  - Some communities use backburning to reduce the amount of flammable material during a bushfire. It's one of the effective ways to try & save houses from the front of an approaching fire.|`|cwNYmxDMaa	Look out for suspicious behaviour.  There are techniques forest fire personnel use to reduce the impact of forest fires such as 'controlled burns'.  But the main cause (other than foul play) is weather and whether or not the leaves and materials on the ground are dry.  <br>  <br>  When camping, always watch your fire and make sure that it is completely out before you leave it.|`|tOEu2FsOaa	Your community should have burn permits in place and initiate controlled burns in high brush areas.

Trim your trees up about 3 feet. Keep your lawn green or cut short. Surround your house with safety like a pond or a cement sidewalk or anything else that is not combustible. Have your neighborhood form a fire safety committee and develop a phone tree to warn your neighbors of a problem.

7ZVybmVWaa	Check out Section 250.140 of the NEC.  <br>  Grounding did not used to be required.  Many older houses do not have a ground wire in any of their circuits.<br>  Before 1999 or 2000 the proper way to hook up a dryer or a range (220 volts) was to use two hots, and a neutral. <br>   <br>  It is true that you do not need a neutral for a 220 volt circuit; however, the neutral is included in dryer and range circuits to provide power for any 120 volt accessories like a light inside of the oven, a timer, a buzzer, etc.<br>  Grounding did not used to be required, but now it is.  So now on new installations you will need a 4 conductor cord to plug in a dryer or range.  Two hots, 1 neutral, and 1 ground.<br>  If you a re replacing a range or dryer and your existing wiring is only 3 conductors then you will need to get a 3 conductor cord and hook it up accordingly - 2 hots and a neutral - no ground.  But you must make sure that the neutral is bonded to the frame of the oven or range.  <br>  This should only be done on a dedicated circuit so that a short circuit somewhere else will not energize the metal chassis of your range or dryer.  There are some 'tap' rules for ranges, ovens, and counter top units - it really gets kind of confusing.<br>  Check out this link<br>  <a href="http://www.ezdiyelectricity.com/?p=221" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezdiyelectricity.com/?p=221</a>|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	That's correct.

A plant in this stage at 12/12 should have no less then 200 watts of light. preferably high pressure sodium, as it has the most complete range of color needed at this stage of life (flowering) on the orange/red spectrum of visible light. for the vegetative, blue (florescent lighting) is perfect - 200 watt equivalent is sufficient.<br>  <br>  FYI I've read some of the answers and if you want to be successful i suggest you don't follow all of their advice (heat?!?!?! more like air conditioner).

36UDdHFzaa	I did it for about 2 months or a month and I honestly couldn't take it anymore. Maybe because I was working another full time job as well but yea. <br>  <br>  My tips (adding to what has already been said):<br>  If you are allergic to any animals make sure you have something for that (non-drowsy). I remember cleaning a house full of cats and all I did was sneeze and itch the entire time. Cleaning was the last thing on my mind and I ended up missing a LOT of things because all I wanted to do was get out. <br>  <br>  Try visualizing a house and write down a plan on how you want to clean it and stick to that. Make it a routine b/c if you just do random things you will eventually miss something because it's very overwhelming.<br>  <br>  Always DUST. Some houses you will walk into and wonder why the heck you are there b/c it's spotless but the only reason you are there is just to upkeep (dusting and vacuuming). So remember to dust everywhere (fans and all). <br>  <br>  If they are first time houses make sure to check areas that you wouldn't normally clean (top of fridge, top of shelves, etc). I once got in trouble because I didn't clean the top of their fridge. <br>  <br>  MOVE things and clean under. We had clients that would go around moving things to make sure you cleaned. Work fast. Don't spend a whole lot of time scrubbing one thing. Usually your job is just up keep and GENERAL house cleaning and NOT deep cleaning so remember that. I remember I spent like 15 min scrubbing one shower with no avail. It was horrible. Only after finishing that house I was told by the lady of the house that she forgot to mention to me she was replacing it. So if you think it's not cleanable make it known to the client or call your boss and let him/her know. We once cleaned this NASTY house. Dog poop everywhere. We figured it was our job and it was gross but we cleaned it come to find out my boss would have never allowed us to do the job if she knew. <br>  <br>  Also if there is urine on the walls/floors etc that is nasty and it's a problem contact your supervisor and let her know. She will either let the client know that you are not to clean that (of course it's just nasty). <br>  <br>  Other than that just listen to your clients wants and needs. Work fast and don't be OCD with vacuuming like I was (that was often what slowed me down the most).<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! :) <br>  <br>  I'm sure your supervisor will have you train with someone the first few days. <br>  <br>  OH! AND don't forget to clean the patio doors. I often forgot about that. lol<br>  <br>  Adding... often times they will give tips which is amazing! :) I loved getting tips lol.|`|ebJ02QZJaa	Start farthest from the front door (which oddly is usually the master bathroom) and work your way back to the front of the house.  Clean top to bottom.  Don't go over any area twice.  <br>  <br>  Spray down the bathrooms and while that is sitting, clean the adjacent bedrooms.  That's pretty much the only tip.<br>  <br>  The homeowners will tell you what they expect you to do specifically.  Some will expect you to do laundry.  Some won't.  Some want you to wash the sheets on the bed and put them back on.  Some will have an extra set and all you do is change them.  It's really all going to depend on what the homeowner wants.|`|Xu02Q9mXaa	I did housekeeping for about 2 years at hotels and beach houses. <br>  Some tips adding to the great ones already given:<br>  Dry rags work better and less chemical really is more sometimes, speciously with blue colored mirror cleaning products like Windex etc. Watch out what you use to clean with and use different rags so you don't poison them or damage the surface your cleaning. <br>  Hot water also helps to get strong marks off. Try to be quick, but make sure you do the smaller details as well as keeping your eyes peeled at all times so you get everything done.  Sometimes you may want to spray something and come back after doing something else for a minute to save you scrubbing longer. <br>  Wear gloves when you feel you should, except for making beds if you have to. (You should look up hospital corners as well on the internet.)<br>  So it could be handy to take some in case they don't have any. Be careful what products you use on what surfaces. (Eg. Dont use toilet cleaner for washing anything else but toilets if bathrooms are involved.)<br>  Cleaning can be very hard on your body. If you have to bend over, bend your legs and stick out your butt a bit, it reduces the pressure on your spine. Tones up your legs too =)|`|dd5f7ac6c2748280ff3f8a594a17b9d0aa	I cleaned houses in college. The way I did was all the wet work first then all the dry work in the home. Meaning, all the kitchens and baths then the dusting and vacuuming. Make sure that the house owners have picked up things like toys on the floor, shoes, etc. before you clean. Your job is to clean their home not pick up after them. Also always start at the top of the room and work your way to the floor. Remember to get the mirrors and pictures on the walls as well as the light switches.|`|r7qm08fkaa	first of all make sure  you are familiar with cleaning products. you can do what i do and read the labels and see what they are good for. <br>  also practice sweeping and dusting in your own place. usually that helps if u know how to clean your own place. <br>  and another good tip, don't be afraid to get your hands dirty. they might like the fact that you are willing to pick up their mess without feeling query or throwing up..lol<br>  another tip is re-check (not re-clean)everything you do to make sure you did not miss anything.<br>  in the end it all depends on what they want you to do and sometimes, how they want you to do it!
d1805dca25d00374cb2c98883d99b807aa	Watering Tip: It's true, Water can harm your Orchids... <br>  <br>  Trapped water, in between the leaves and/or new growth, can promote bacteria or fungi when temperatures become colder during the night... Be careful when watering, as such an event can kill the plant. <br>  <br>  What to do... <br>  <br>  Commit to drying up any water that fell in between the leaves or onto new growth... you can use a straw to breathe air directly onto the water and dry out the area|`|968461807de2949a229454ee0782f7a8aa	It mustn't sit in water at all, it is better to soak the plant for about an hour, once a week then let all the water drain away.  Sitting it over pebbles with water, gives it a damp atmosphere around it similar to the rain forrests they grow in.  Do NOT use tap water, unless your water is very soft, but collect and use rainwater.|`|p7ZdohGTaa	Sometimes the blooms will fall off due to the change in the location of the plant. One thing she should check, is the condition of the potting medium. Many plants that are sold, even through very reputable dealers, have old potting medium and it can cause problems for the plant. Have her check to be sure it smells fresh and does not smell moldy. She can even take the plant out of the pot to see if there is excessive root death or whether the bark chunks are soft or firm. If there are a lot of dead roots (soft, squishy, the outer layer is separated from the little string in the middle), or if the bark is not firm and fresh, she may need to repot the plant, using ONLY orchid potting medium - soil will kill the plant. She should be sure not to put it into an overly large pot, since orchids prefer to be a little underpotted, rather than overpotted. The plant should never sit in water, should be watered in the early part of the day, and can have a very diluted amount of orchid fertilizer in each watering. It will need a drop in temperature at night in order to bloom, so a windowsill might be a good place for the plant as long as it does not get direct sunlight. She needs to look on the tag of the plant to find out what type of plant it is, in order to look up "culture", or the growing directions. A cattleya will be labeled with a name, such as: C.  or cat: (and then some sort of name). A phalenopsis will be labeled Phal, etc. If she is unsure of what sort of plant she has, she can look online for orchid growers. One grower is called, Orchids by Hauserman and is one of the largest. The are located near Chicago and can give good growing tips.|`|c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	Orchids will only bloom once a year, so there's not much you can do about making more flowers till about this time next year. I have only been able to make them bloom again if they are kept in alot of artificial light, like under a lamp or in a room that has the light on alot. Orchids HATE to be sitting in water, so you should advise your friend to not let the plant sit in a tray of water. It is common to have pebbles in the water tray, so the plant can drain water without sitting in it. Never water them with cold water (remember, they are a tropical plant.) Water only with lukewarm water, and test it on your wrist the way you would do a baby's bottle. I hold my orchids under the faucet and let the water run through the pot till all the bark looks fairly wet, then let it drain into the pebble tray, but not so much water that it goes over the top of the pebbles. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps
4z0Rk4Ddaa	Embalming tables have a drain at the end, This drain leads to a receptacle, which is much like a toilet (for lack of a better description). The blood and body fluids that are removed during embalming are washed down this drain, and there it is flushed into the septic sewer where it will be treated by the waste water treatment plant. <br>  In cases where the deceased was overcome by a contagious disease, these fluids are treated first with disinfectant.  There have been cases where a person who has passed away because of a communicable disease, funeral directors are required to dispose of the blood and body fluids in specialized toxic waste disposal units that are collected by a company that deal with this particular type of thing.  There are certain privacy laws that restrict funeral directors from knowing personal details about people, such as whether they passed away because of AIDS, Hepatitis or other communicable diseases.  Funeral directors are usually only made aware by the family of the deceased. Sadly, in this day and age, we treat every deceased person as though they died of a communicable and contagious disease. Some funeral homes will only dispose of the blood and bodily fluids through this specialized waste disposal company, but in the scheme of things, blood and body fluids are only a very small part of what actually goes into the water waste treatment system.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been somewhat helpful. :)|`|TNwvuazEaa	In the town's drinking water reservoir.|`|qZ0310yVaa	that,s a good question phone them then get back to us

I do know that excessive watering can cause your grass to yellow.|`|hNfOgNNBaa	Lamp light doesn't produce NEAR the lumens (intensity of light) as the sun. Therefore, the growth will be stunted.  Lamp lights also fail to contain the red-end of the spectrum which is required for flowering plants.<br>  <br>  As far as your grass goes- you probably need to feed it (unless your femaile dogs are killing it).  Go buy yourself a $4 bag of ammonium sulfate at the hardware store and apply the correct amount to your grass (according to label directions).  If you know math, you can figure this out.  If you suck at math- go ahead and burn your lawn by applying WAY too much.  <br>  Good luck
52e654eabf1bcef75fcacc45bc4305a0aa	How many lights are not working. If it is a breaker normally there would be lights and plugs not working . Some electricians will put only lighting on a breaker then it would be 10 -20 lights depending on the wattage of each light<br>  I need more info.<br>  You can email me if you need help|`|ebJ02QZJaa	Yes, they can.  <br>  <br>  My house was hit by lightning once and all the overheads upstairs went out.  Turns out it was a fried circuit breaker.  You may have had a power surge or something that caused it to fry.  <br>  <br>  If you are lucky, it is simply tripped and needs to be reset.|`|2uZXCyeBaa	It's absolutely possible.  Circuit breakers in your home are magnets and if a circuit is overloaded for a long period of time, the metal will lose it's magnetic properties.  That being said, if your ceiling lights have gone out with no history of circuit breakers tripping, a bad breaker probably isn't your problem.  If the lights that aren't working are all on the same switch, I'd look first at the switch.  Is it a dimmer switch?  If so, the dimmer could have been shorted out by a broken bulb or a short inside of a bulb.  There are a lot of possible reasons that a light could stop working, but resetting the circuit breaker is about all that I'd recommend you try yourself.  Definitely time to call an experienced electrical troubleshooter.

If you have a display perhaps you can post a photo of the table so we can make suggestions.<br>  <br>  One thing that is always a big deal in hot beach climates is the crocheted bikini.  You might give that idea some consideration and sell the tops and bottoms separately so that one can purchase just the top to wear with shorts.

ok41XXskaa	Sorry, however the answer is not something that can be pulled out of a hat. You need to consider what kind of appliances, Stove, refrigerator, etc.  and the monthly power usage for each. Is the apt heated by gas or electric? How energy efficient the air conditioner and heater are and how energy efficient the apt is,ie: how much insulation in the walls, floor and ceiling? <br>  <br>  Also the amount of time you will be there and how much cooking, TV watching, computer surfing, and laundry you do will also be a considering factor. <br>  <br>  Probably the easiest way to discover the usage is to talk to the neighbors. Be nosy ask pertinent questions. Be aware their usage might differ from yours based on the answers to the personal usage questions above. Good luck!

If your door is going to swing the opposite way (for example, if the knob is on the right now and you will have the knob on the left when it opens out), you can just remove the door and jamb, spin it around, reinstall, and trim it out.  If you want the knob on the same side, but swinging out instead of in, you will need a new prehung door.  The door is beveled slightly on the stop side to allow it to close more easily.  Reversing the swing will have the beveled side out, and will look terrible.

No, it not caustic but will dry out your hands if you don't wear rubber gloves.  It comes in a jar, last one I bought was yellow with a red lid and you mix it in water and apply and wipe up.  It'll remove excess thinset stains, grout haze and other impurities from tile.  Now if this is tile that has oil & grease stains you'll want to use SuperClean which you'll find in Wal-Mart's automotive section in the cleaners and wax isle.  There's two kinds, Concrete & Driveway and the straight grease remover.  They're about $6 per gallon bottle each.

I recommend that you get the book "Wiring A House" for Pros by Pros from Taun Taun press. It is updated regularly so you should be able to get the latest information. It covers out buildings.<br>  <br>  I am landlord and bought the first addition many years ago. It saved me from many re-inspection fees.<br>  <br>  You could also check out the NEC from your local library, but I  don't recommend this because it covers much more than you need and is not in layman's terms.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to the Amazon page for this book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wiring-House-Pros-Rex-Cauldwell/dp/1561585270/ref=sr_1_1?" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Wiring-House-Pros-...</a><br>  <br>  I think I got my fisrt one at Home Depot.|`|0h9aD7Toaa	You can pick up the meter socket at the same place you pick up the panel and everything else.<br>     Hard to really hit everything from your description, you will run a number 4 copper wire to your water line going into the barn, depending on soil conditions the inspector may require you to drive an additional ground rod, put the bonding screw in the panel, bushings on the pipe connectors, duct seal, arrange the raceway to drain, maintain the minimum clearance above ground and away from where windows can open.<br>     Your building is at or below grade so all receptacles will be gfci, you may want to ask the inspector what type of light fixtures he wants to see in there, and what type of wiring method he wants used inside the barn, here would all be pvc inside and vapor tight fixtures..<br>     If you are going to do this, get a good book, and an electrician friend would be even better|`|DCNuJSylaa	For a 200A panel you will need a 5/8" diameter x 8' long ground rod, which can be purchased at Home Depot, Lowe's, etc. for around $16 - $18. The easiest way to drive this in the ground is with a T-Post driver. Dig a small hole 2-4" deep and place the ground rod in it. Then drive it until it is flush with the surrounding soil.You will need a ground rod clamp and a piece of #6 bare copper wire long enough to go from the ground rod to the grounding buss bar in the panel you are mounting. Connect the wire to the rod with the clamp. If you are mounting the panel outside make sure it is 3R or weatherproof rated and run the ground wire directly into the panel. If you are mounting the panel inside, run the wire through the smallest hole in the bottom of the meter, through the 2" rigid metal conduit you used to connect the meter to the panel, and attach it to the grounding buss bar. There are plenty of other things that need to be done to pass the rough inspection, but this is a good start. If you need more info please contact me via email and I will be more than happy to walk you through the code. Also, you may want to find out which version of the NEC your area is using.... there are a few changes from the 2005 to the 2008 version that may effect you.|`|Iy0si0HYaa	according to the NEC the grounding electrode(the rod you drive in the ground)Shall not be less than 8ft in length you can get a grounding kit at most hardware stores it will include the grounding electrode and ground ring,you will also need a GEC grounding electrode conductor it shall be bare made of copper or copper clad aluminum and be sized according to the largest SE conductor my advice is invest in a NEC code book and see section 250 grounding good luck.|`|d94f99ad1710d80ab4587d8db787acb3aa	With all due respect I want to say to you that what you don't know may just kill you. . . or at least burn down this barn and the rest of your property!

jvPToF4Laa	In general, if you do not have specific directions for a seed, plant it in sterile mix (I use Pro-mix for my stuff) only as deep as the seed is thick. So fine seed goes on top, fat seeds deeper. Keep the seed moist until it sprouts, then let it get slightly dry between waterings. I often cover the seed in clear plastic until it sprouts, so I don't need to water it.<br>  <br>  There are both annual and perennial asters. You could see anywhere from one to three weeks for them to sprout, depending on what you have.

It might be worth checking with them.<br>  <br>  Also, I'll tell you based on the people I know who DO use cleaning services regularly: there is nothing like knowing that the cleaners are coming that will inspire you to get the place picked up.

L8zmQS8Jaa	There are two methods used to "refurbish" an old bath tub.  A newer method is to put a plastic liner inside.  The second method is to etch the original glazing with acid and then paint it with an epoxy paint.  The plastic is less durable but the epoxy paint also won't look new after 2 years of normal use.  <br>  <br>  Try a product called "gel gloss" to bring up the shine and do some light cleaning.  Look in the local big box store in the cleaning supplies isle.

A tip to keep the colors from bleeding under the tape is to paint the edge of the tape(where you will be painting the new color)with the color of the other wall. This way if it bleeds into the other wall it's the same color.Let that dry for 30 minutes and start painting that wall.

qtdxtaitaa	First figure out what features you want in the room - dresser, changing table, etc. Would you like to have a rocking chair? A bookcase? A lamp? Make up your mind about the furniture and architectural features first. You might want to make a reading/rocking corner, a baby only corner, and a 'just for you' area. <br>  <br>  Second: Color. Is this always going to be a baby's room? Choose something that can work either way - maybe a soft golden yellow, or beige. You can add in brighter colors with the curtains and bed clothes and crib accessories. <br>  <br>  Third: Do the repairs, paint, and place the furniture. Take a look at magazines or websites that show children's rooms for ideas.
c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	It's really not all that hard... <br>  I would say to start with small starter plants, not seeds. Seeds aren't that hard either, but they take more time and patience, and if you are new to gardening then starter plants would be the better way to go. If you want a vegetable garden, then pick out plants of vegetables you like and know you will eat, and don't go overboard with picking out too many. Some plants, such as tomatoes, are REALLY prolific and make LOTS of veggies per plant, so if you get too many plants you will have way too many veggies, and won't be able to give them away fast enough. <br>  <br>  If you want a flower garden, then pick out flowers that are hardy and easy to grow. This will be different depending on where you live, so if you don't know what flowers grow well in your area, I would suggest going to a nursery or garden shop and asking someone who works there to recommend something easy for you to try. <br>  <br>  Right now is a little bit cool to be starting a garden, unless you live in a really warm area where the temperature is moderate already and it doesn't freeze. Otherwise, you should wait till the last frosts of winter have gone before starting, otherwise the frost could kill your baby plants. Usually sometime in May is a good time to start. <br>  <br>  The most important thing is to keep it watered and fertilized. You can buy fertilizer that you can mix with water, or even attach to the garden hose to make fertilizing easier. I like to use Miracle-Gro in my gardens. If you have trouble remembering to water your garden regularly, then get a timer that you can hook up to your faucet that will turn the sprinkler on for you a certain time every day. These are easy to find at garden stores. There are many kinds of sprinklers to choose from. I like to use dripper hoses so that the water just goes on the base and roots of each plant. This cuts down on the number of weeds that grow. But dripper hoses are also a little complicated, so if you're not into that just yet, then just get one of those lawn sprinklers with a dial with different spray patterns you just set out on the ground and turn on. <br>  <br>  You should also consider if there are any animals in your area that will like to eat up your new garden, such as rabbits or deer. If you have them to deal with then you will need to put a fence around your garden, or put plant cages or netting around your plants to protect them. <br>  <br>  If your plants ever start to look weird, like they have a disease or bugs, then a person at the nursery or garden shop can usually help you figure out what it is and what to do about it. <br>  <br>  Fertilizing on a regular basis really is one of the best things you can do to make your garden look really great. If you are planting vegetables, make sure the garden gets a good amount of sunlight every day, not too much shade (some is OK, just not too much.) Don't worry about it getting too hot for your plants. Veggies love sun and as long as you keep them watered they should be fine. <br>  <br>  I would suggest you also get a good garden reference book. You will eventually come up with questions and at times not have anyone to ask, so a book is handy to have. I use my Better Homes & Gardens Western Garden Book the most out of all the garden books I have.... they have been printing it for many years and it is a really easy to read and understand format. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps|`|IYF4xSTdaa	chose the plants you like first of all...plant them at least 8 inches apart<br>  or twelve inches..all up to you...put some top soil in the garden,water<br>  every morning,try your best not water after five in the evening,as this could cause fungus...love the flowers keep the bed clean and fertilize<br>  only if you need it..|`|N8DxgAD7aa	Giving some water always helps my garden a lot.

I think the rocks would protect the weed barrier from the torch flames if you decide to go that route.|`|Vl4ZLrf5aa	The weeds are probably not growing through the blocker, but instead, are spouting in the soil/sand that has caught beneath your rocks. A propane burner will turn the rocks black, and I imagine would burn the weed blocker as well if you don't have much of a rock layer there. <br>  <br>  If you don't have a lot of weeds, you can try nailing them with boiling water. For a larger patch, you can scorch them by placing black visqueen over them for a week or so. For my desert gardens, I use an old fashioned dandelion digging tool and try to stay on top of things as best I can :)|`|4uike3ARaa	It shouldn't catch on fire.<br>  Weed blockers don't work very well at all.

You just need to make provisions for it to drain effectively.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	I would use round-up and then a product called AMAZE Grass and weed preventer.

To locate them look for the rows of nails through that sheeting and that will be where the joists are located.<br>  <br>  Now, if your floor feels loose or squeaks, use a screw gun with 1-1/2" deck type scews and refasten the flooring to the joists.  The sqeaks are a result of the builder not using a cement coated or ring shank nail and/or not gluing the panels when sheeting the floor.  If you use the screws, not drywall screws as they are to brittle for this aplication, you'll be able to effectively tighten up this floor.  The chances that you will come in contact with any electrical or plumbing item with this screw is a million to one being that the existing fasteners have already run that scenario without mishap or damage.<br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.com" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.com</a>|`|GcWb7IRdaa	usually they are 16 inches on center so go down stairs find the girder and the joists run perpendicular to the girder measure 13and 3/4 from the inside of the band and u will find the first joist center next measure 16 inches from the centre of that one to get to the next and so on and soon enough u will find it|`|NhWvvJ4saa	they are not! they are under the floorboards, AND when you fix them down,DO NOT nail them in the centre, nail them at the edge, cuz any water pipes or electric cables are in the centre.|`|AA10948959	Care should be taken fixing down floorboards.

BVJBY4eQaa	Old wives tales are a major cause of most repairs that leather technicians go out to fix and hairspray and solvents are the most common. Taking notice of these untested/unproved old wives tales could cost you a great deal of money if it goes wrong. <br>  Just repaired a very expensive jacket that had been virtually ruined by using hairspray to remove ink. It did not remove the ink and left a far worse problem to solve. <br>  <br>  Successful ink removal will depend on the type of leather you have, please see the following:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lttsolutions.net/whatkindofle..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lttsolutions.net/whatkindofle...</a><br>  <br>  For ink removal:<br>  <br>  Ink Removal<br>  Removing ink from leather is not a cleaning problem.<br>  Most ink removal products will not work simply because of the length of time the ink has been on the leather.<br>  <br>  Ink is a dye and has re-coloured the leather (this is what it is meant to do)<br>  The longer the ink has been on the leather the harder it is to remove because it soaks into the finish. Once it has soaked into the finish you have to use very strong products to remove it, which will also remove finish and pigment which then need replacing.<br>  <br>  Pigment/Protected leather<br>  If the ink is on a pigmented leather then the first thing you should try is an LTT Ink Stick. The fresher the ink the more chance you have of removing it. It is a good idea to have one in your house if you have pale leather and children!!!! <br>  <br>  Old ink will be harder to remove than new ink and may mean resorting to solvents which will also remove the finish. This is probably best left to the experts<br>  <br>  If an ink stick doesn't work a solvent based remover will need to be used and it may also remove finish and pigment so is best left to the experts.<br>  <br>  You should also be using LTT Leather Protect on your suite. This will act like a 'scotchgard' and will make any more mishaps easier to clean off.<br>  <br>  You will see many people recommending household products to remove ink – this is not recommended as most simply will not work, some may appear to work but the damage they cause can make a much bigger problem which is then un-repairable (even by a technician)<br>  <br>  DO NOT USE THE FOLLOWING:<br>  <br>  Hairspray - This is very risky as it can make the matter far worse by spreading the ink over a bigger area and can sometimes then be impossible to fix. <br>  Nail Varnish remover/solvents will remove the finish on the leather even if you cannot tell it is doing so and this will then need replacing, and alcohol may do the same depending on the strength of the finish on the leather. <br>  Baby wipes – just about the worst thing you can use on a leather as they break down the finish and will eventually ruin it. <br>  Milk or Toothpaste - these are just silly ideas that will leave sticky residues on the surface which will help to break down the finish on your leather. <br>  Silicones/furniture polish – should not be used on leather. They will form a coating on the surface of the leather which will not allow any moisture to get to the leather itself and will eventually break all the finish down and cause it to crack. <br>  Hide food will not remove ink and will leave residues on the leather which will attract dirt and oils. <br>  Most leather cleaners will not remove ink unless a very good leather protector has been used on a regular basis. <br>  Magic sponges or erasers (Mr, Clean Magic Erasers). These have been tested by experts in the leather industry and have found to do a lot of damage to certain finish types on leather.<br>  <br>  Aniline Style Leather<br>  As aniline style leathers are largely absorbent it means that the ink will have soaked straight into the leather itself. This makes it impossible to remove. No product will successfully remove the ink. <br>  <br>  DO NOT try ink removing products on aniline style leathers as most will leave a greasy residue which will then cause another problem.<br>  <br>  Because aniline style leathers are absorbent the ink will carry on moving through the leather and may become less obvious over time. Cleaning and protecting will also help to dissipate over time.|`|btVNM1Djaa	don't use hair spray. It will only ruin the jacket. Try a little mechanics hand soap, one of the "orange" based cleaners, try to avoid the ones with pumice(grit), that can scratch the leather.|`|0CCnAoMGaa	Definitely don't try hair spray on your coat, it will leave a sticky residue that you can't wash out. Also, before trying anything with moisture (like a cleaning product), try it on a part of the jacket that isn't visible because it may stain the jacket itself. Let it dry..and if the area you applied it to is blemish-free, then try it on the ink-spot.|`|G0ino2hjaa	What i did when this happened to me was once i got the ink on it I scrubbed and scrubbed with clorox wipes, and germ x for like an hour, and then once that got most of it out i finished it off with some oil. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped.. and you jacket is better...<br>  i feel for you

ItPGnaRjaa	Your defrost drain is stopped up. The water has to go somewhere when the ice box defrosts itself.

Get your model number and go to your local Appliance part store and buy one. be like 30 bucks max.

Clean it thoroughly inside and out, and don't forget the pan under the unit that catches water. Vacuum the coils behind and underneath to remove all the built up dust. Plug it back in and adjust the settings to manufacturer's recommendations. <br>  If the problem persists, either call a repairman or go shopping for a new one .|`|dGRq65eraa	Here is the fix for your refrigerator. You almost had the job fixed when you chipped the ice but you will have to again remove the freezer back panel. I do not recommend using anything sharp to break the ice as it might accidentally puncture the cooling coils. Melt the ice from the defrost drain trough under the coils with hot water using a baby aspirator to remove the water that accumulates. When the drain is clear, use the aspirator again by squeezing it to flush out anything that may be blocking further down the drain.  When you hear water drain to the pan underneath the frig, you know you have a clear drain tube now. Hope this helps, let me know if that solves your problem.<br>  I have more tips for your refrigerator below

UwEEHuRcaa	Refer to "The Eco-friendly House Plant" by B.Wolverton. Removal of chemical vapors was rated best by: boston fern,peace lily,dracaena,english ivy,schefflera,weeping fig,dieffenbachia,gerbera,florists' chrysanthemum.Also assorted potted palms.They require different care/light though, and the gerbera and mums are short-term house plants. So you may wish to try the old spider plant(all in the book) which is maybe not quite so good at vapors but really easy to care for and doesn't tend to get bugs.
e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	Skelebone,<br>  <br>  Yes, the water leaked through to the wood and caused it to swell.  When the wood pores filled with the water, the swelling caused the glue to fail in the corners.  Not to pour salt in the wound, but piling books on top furthered the damage by preventing the wood from even expansion.<br>  Anyway, let the box sit until it has completely dried out.  The wood should shrink down from its present size.  Once you have allowed it to complete dry out, (maybe a month or better), re-glue the corners and apply steady but even pressure by using wood clamps.  Clamp the entire box at one time.  In other words, do not do one side and let the glue dry and then do the other.  Put glue on all four corners and then  apply all clamps - loosely at first.  Start tightening the clamps all around a little bit at a time, so that you wind up with even pressure on all four corners.  Continue to tighten until all four corners are pulled back in together, neatly and tightly.  DO NOT over tighten, just enough to completely close the gaps and squeeze a bit of glue out of the seams.  With a damp cloth, wipe the excess wet glue off the edges while the glue is still wet.  DO NOT use a wet cloth nor apply to much water.  You simply want to wipe off the glue and a damp rag will remove any trace of the glue.  Once it has dried, remove the clamps and then do some research to find out how to use this antique humidor.  Nowadays, most cigar humidors have a moisture pad that is attached to the inside lid.  Try using that so that you only add water to the pad and it won't come in contact with the wood lid.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Tvcn83Adaa	Ya, you did a number on it.<br>  <br>  Anything else you do will further damage the antique.

It's like professional strength stuff.|`|U638GHIWaa	foggers are good  but as you described how many  apartments are there everyone will have to treat thier own apartments the roaches will just move to another area of the complex that is not treated they are  very smart as people dont give them credit the two you described as seeing will turn into hundreds and then into thousands in as little as a week with the fogger you will have to leave the apartment for a period of time read the lable on the product very close youll have to wash everything down when its done and make sure your pets are not in the apartment when you fog  it will hurt them the key here everybody has to treat at the same time or your just moving them from one place to another i hope this helps|`|Dqwajq4Qaa	To answer your question about foggers, YES they work but keep in mind that you'll need to evacuate your home for about 4-6 hours. The poison is also lethal enough to harm ANY PETS you may have. <br>  <br>  I had to fog my apartment when I moved in, so I set it off, left for the night and came back and there were like 200 bugs off all kinds just laying on the carpet. Vacuuming was disgusting, but it killed them all off for a very long time!|`|ZhN9hOaaaa	The forgers help. But word of caution. Neighbors down the street uses several at once. They set them off and spent the weekend  at a hotel to let it be affective.<br>   The collection of spray vapor was flammable. The fire department said a pilot light set the vapor off. <br>  The house burned to the ground.<br>    If considering a forger.. Check and see if its vapor is flammable. They may make a nonflammable one.<br>  Good luck.|`|96fe0c019ce3e709140e850c4717fda1aa	They work great, follow the instruction on package<br>  It will take care of numerous bug problems<br>  A Home Care spray for the exterior and interior perimeter can be used for maintenance, once a month etc

Don't plan the whole tone of your house around one machine.|`|a2ce1097a86fb1054145f9a23192a355aa	Just put a heavy throw rug under the machine to protect the floor.|`|Iuzf9LQEaa	Hardwood flooring will dent and scratch much easier than laminate flooring.  So to answer your question simply with no other factors involved...laminate would be the better product from a durability standpoint.|`|S9d3TEj5aa	The Laminate flooring is much more durable then wood when it comes to moving around alot. Hard wood is expensive to install and fix, were as laminate is half the price.|`|k5LC3YTtaa	just buy the elliptical machine and a rubber mat to put underneath it.
