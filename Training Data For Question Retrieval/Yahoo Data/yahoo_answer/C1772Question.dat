20090227161202AAX2j6a	News & Events;Current Events	Why does Obama want to FORCE doctors to commit murder ?	Christian Doctors believe abortion is murder,it is against their religion,an abomination before God...And yet...WASHINGTON – President Barack Obama plans to repeal a Bush administration rule that has become a flash point in the debate over a doctor's right not to participate in abortions. The regulation, instituted in the last days of the Bush administration, strengthened job protections for doctors and nurses who refuse to provide a medical service because of moral qualms.      A Health and Human Services official said Friday the administration will publish notice of its intentions early next week, opening a 30-day comment period for advocates on both sides, medical groups and the public.      The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the notice has not been completed.      The Bush administration rule was quickly challenged in federal court by several states and medical organizations. As a candidate, President Barack Obama criticized the regulation and campaign aides promised that if elected, he would review it.      OsamaBama wants to take away our right to religius freedom !!!

A newly formed truth seeking group:      Medical Professionals for 9/11 Truth    http://mp911truth.org/       Take a look at their CREDENTIALS ... these people are certainly not your average "kooks" as the mainstream media and some of the politicians would wish to paint them.      It is good to see more professional people willing to stand up publicly and be counted, asking questions that require answers.      What do you think of their words and the questions they want answered?
20090227155748AADN9nG	News & Events;Other - News & Events	Do you agree with me that all marijuana users are evil?	I believe so. Anyone who doesn't think they're evil is probably a pot smoker themself. Pot smokers are pure evil because they don't have any respect for the law or their own health. They don't care that they're giving themselves lung cancer and brain damage, they just care about the dumb high it gives them. Sure, you can't OD on pot, but you can't on cigarettes either and both of those kill you in the same way-- over a long period of time. They are destroying the very fabric of American culture and society. I can't turn on the TV or read a newspaper without seeing or hearing some dumb-**** stoner saying that weed should be legal. America has enough problems trying to do away with stoners whilst pot is illegal; if it was legalized, the cops can't touch them and they will spread their disgusting, pointless, and deadly vice to others, turning them into unproductive and unmotivated slackers who spend the rest of their lives sitting around eating their weight in junk food and watching crap TV. Meanwhile, tumors will form in their lungs and brain cells will die, but they won't notice or care because they'll think it's worth it for their stupid high.       I can safely say that I speak for all non-stoners when I say that pot and pot smokers should be done away with and punished as severely as possible. Any non-stoner that disagrees with me is probably just waiting for it to be legal to take up the habit.

20090227165601AAA4q0s	News & Events;Current Events	Why are people so afraid of a terrorist attack on America?	In the year 2000, you had 0 chance of dying from a terrorist attack. Same with the years 2002-present. Even in the horrible year of 2001, you had a 1 in 100,000 chance of dying from a terrorist attack. Compare that to approximately a 1 in 10,000 chance of dying from suicide. So, in a sense, you are more of a danger to yourself than terrorists. We had one attack. That doesn't mean we're all going to die from a terrorist attack.      If you read the book that came from, I highly respect you. If you didn't, you probably don't want to know...
