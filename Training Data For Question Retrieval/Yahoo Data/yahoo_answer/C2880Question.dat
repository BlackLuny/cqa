20090202153329AAke52f	Environment;Global Warming	Where are the real pikachus?  (Yes, they do exist, but I lost the site)?	I read an article on the web once about a real life pikachu.  They are endangered because of shrinking habitats, and I believe that they live in the Midwestern US.  They live in cold areas on mountains, but the areas are shrinking.  They can't go much higher because of lack of vegetation, but they can't go down to find a less affected mountain because of the change in temperature.  Can you please find a link to that article or others like it?
