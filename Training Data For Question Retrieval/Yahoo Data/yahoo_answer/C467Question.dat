20090129085145AADBc8w	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Need to turn the fluorescent light from white to yellow... can I?	I recently bought some of those energy-saving light bulbs, in varying degrees of brightness - the brightest is "Daylight", the next is "Bright White" and the softest is "Soft White". They all emit a kind of dull, ugly, white light. We put them in our lamps (which have yellow lampshades) and the light was fine, a nice, soft yellow like we like. But the one in our ceiling fan (which has a white cover) is the dull, ugly white light. Is there a different cover we could use to turn the light yellow? The glaring, harsh light is really annoying, even if it's not as bright.
20090129084635AAUqJnj	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	My furnace guy hooked up a natural gas furnace to propane, now it keeps shutting off?	We didn't know how hook up our new furnace to propane, so we hired a professional who owns his own company to hook it up for us. He asked us prior to hooking it up if we ordered a propane furnace, and we told him yes. It came with a box of stuff (I assume the orifices were in there), but at the time he came we didn't know where the box was. He hooked it up anyway and fired it up and then left and charged us a bunch of money. Then when we came home that night we noticed it smelled funny so we called him. He just said that it's because it was new and the smell will go away after a few days. Four days later, the smell still hadn't gone away and we used about 20% of our 500 gal tank! He asked us if we'd gotten a box with the furnace, and we told him yes, but we didn't know where it was. We finally found it and found out that yes, it did have the propane orifices in it, so it had run on the natural gas orifices those days. He came back the next day and installed the orifices and charged us again! Then the furnace started tripping the overheat switches, so we had him back again and he found a mouse nest in the furnace. He charged us again. Then it tripped again, he came back yet again and said the valve was off a little bit and charged us again. Then it tripped again and so he came down and didn't find anything wrong other than our plenum on top the furnace is too small (yet another charge). So now it is still tripping so we called another guy, who told us our entire problem is because there is so much soot inside the furnace due to it running propane with the natural gas orifices now it needs removed and cleaned out (which will be around $500!) My question is, shouldn't have the original furnace guy noticed the wrong orifices were not in the system in the first place? Is this second guy right? And are we out of line to ask the original guy to pay the other guy to fix our furnace (cleaning it out)? Also, this second guy also said that the first guy didn't hook it up to code anyway!

20090129085307AAcT9Nk	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Can I hook up a hot water heater along w/a tankless water heater? Or any other suggestion?	I recently purchased a new construction home that came w/a tankless water heater. I never knew there was a such thing. I happen to love the tankless water heater cause I never run out of hot water, however I dont like that it sometimes take over a minute to get the hot water to come out of the faucet. Also if the water pressure isn't high enough, the water runs cold. Also when you turn off the faucet and turn back on 5 minutes later, I have to wait again for the water to turn hot.       Saying all that, can I hook up a small hot water heater to the tankless heater to prevent this from happening? Or anything else I can hook up to the tankless heater for warm water to stay in place longer?

I started hearing a knocking noise in my walls while I use the the sink, shower and after flushing the toilet. It does not matter if it is hot or cold water. It starts when I turn on the water but continues after I turn it off. Recently I was cleaning my bathroom floor and I had not turned on the faucets at all. I dumped the water from the bucket down the sink and as the water drained the knocking noise began. I tested further by plugging the drain and running the water, I did not hear any knocking, I turned off the faucet and still did not hear any knocking. Once I unplugged the driain and the water started draining the knocking started again.       Should I be worried? I do not hear it in the kitchen sink (same floor) or the lower level bathroom, only the 2nd level bathroom.

20090129100747AAfKngO	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Leaking shower...Sealers and what to do at joint?	Okay, Everytimes we took a shower upstairs (stall shower with 2 seats no tub) we could hear a drip in the room underneath. Reculked, still leaked no suprise there. So then we cut a hole in the celing under the shower and had the whole drain replaced and all the black piping that comes FROM the shower. Guess what, still leaks...slightly suprised. So from underneath you can see where there is a white pipe going TO the shower we cannot access this pipe from underneath becuase of wood support in celing...to make a lond story a little shorter, we ended up cutting in the shower just above the shower head and there is the hot and cold white pipe which leads to the T joint which has the copper pipe going up to the shower head at the top. That copper pipe meets another joint and at the other side of the joint is the shower head silver pipe.:::::::::::::::::::::::::It is green around the joint where the copper pipe leads to that joint closest to the shower head. QUESTION: Do we unscrew it and put plumbers tape around and screw it back in, is there some sort of sealent we can put around the outside of all the joints in there? It seems aparnt the leak is comming from the top but there are a few other geen areas along the way we'd like the seal just to be sure.  Thanks for any info.  We have called a plumber...we live a ways out and the first one just replaced the black pipe and now I have a pointless hole in the celing below. We already got most of the way ourselves and have a sheetrocker.  Any other suggestions and help appreciated.

I'm almost positive that I took it out before I went to school since it'll be half-days all week and I don't need it. Plus, monday night was chinese new years and I recieved wads of cash which are still in the red envelope instead of in my wallet, where I usually would have placed it, so I probably didn't have it then either. I might have taken it to school and it migiht have been stolen - but why would someone steal my wallet but not my ipod or my nice, new phone which are in the same pocket as my wallet?      The wallet is really really important to me because it contains one of the only picture I have of my father, whom I no longer see and rarely talks to. Also my credit card's in it..

We've gotten a start on the project, and have estimated that we'll end up collecting about 25 cubic yards of trash. Therefore, we'll need either a 20 or 30 cubic yard dumpster.      We could also put the trash in bags and put them on the curb for weekly pickup, but it would take months and $400 in garbage stickers. The dumpster would obviously have the less time benefit, but would it be more cost effective to simply put it on the curb?      All advice would be greatly appreciated, especially on how to lower the cost of trash removal. Thank You.

20090128083742AAtWIvg	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Central air conditioning question - fan motor?	problem: when trying to heat the house no warm air blows (only cold) until after we turn the heat up enough for the coils in the furnance (emergency heat) to come on.       we had ac guys come out and they checked everything and replaced the capacitor.      this worked about a day and a half      exact same problem came back. we have not called anyone yet.      additonal info:  last night i tried to cool the house, theromstat said it was cooling but no air at all was blowing.  i walked out to the unit and i heard buzzing (i heard this when the ac guys were working on getting the heat going) and finally after about 5 minutes, the fan started turning.      i went back inside and cold air was blowing.......... the fan outside quit turning again off and on.      the fan blade turns freely (i saw the guy check that so i checked it as well)      basically:      when heating: cold air blows until coils in furnace come on (emergency heat), it should at least be warm when you bump it up a few degrees      when cooling: no air blows until the fan outside starts turning which seems to be sporadic.      it seems that maybe instead of a capacitor maybe its another problem      if its the fan motor, i know i can replace that myself because i took it out a few years ago and oiled it no problem.      what does everyone think?  i have an ohm tester but if you tell me to use it you will need to tell me exactly what setting to put it on and explain it to me like a 3rd grader :)      thanks in advance for any ideas or help!

I'm currently living in a semi attached town home and I'm hot in the summer and cold in the winter.  I spoke with the landlord several times and they state that itis the effect of having nothing 'on top' the town home.  Really that does not make any sense, I think the units are poorly insulated.  But it seems to be a popular theme in rental units.  So, would moving into a fully attached home be better.

We currently have a 200 amp service, but where the breakers plug into is melted and the voltage keeps dropping in and out. My dryer stopped working the other day and I called one of my friends over to look at it. We determined that the breaker was bad. When we replaced it, the prongs that it plugged into was deformed and melted. My friend told me that it definitely needed to be replaced, but he knew a guy that could do it(a laid off electrician). I had a guy come over and look at it and he said that the whole thing needed to replaced and the box itself needed to move down a few feet(it is approx 7.5 ft in the air). The box I currently have has 20 places to insert breakers to it. He suggested I get a larger one(40 or 42 I can't remember). He also said that all the breakers needed replaced(expect the one I just bought-->30x2 or something). We never really settle on a price because I did not know what something like even costs. I don't want try to get him to work for free, but then again I don't want to get taken for the money other. Any suggestions what I should offer. He said the materials will be between ($300-$350).

20090128094924AAanygN	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	I borrowed a 35 year old sewing machine.it started smoking. the repair shop says it couldn't be my fault. Do I?	What? a repair may not be possible, as this machine's motor is no longer made. if we found a second hand motor, not knowing how well it works, repair prices in the capitol city where i live are often extremely high for electrical repairs. i definitely wouldn't repair it if were mine. the repair person seemed certain that it wasn't my fault. but i think my friend is expecting some kind of reembursement from me. i feel unlucky, as i didn't even finish the task i had borrowed the machine for, but willing to give some money, just to do what's right. in reality, i don't think i would ask for money for a 35 year old appliance that breaks down, in her shoes. but she says she only used it once a year and it worked fine. (the repair place said they had had one that worked fine and then just broke down from age-it just happens).      i new cheap machine would be about 150 euros and a repair possibly impossible and more expensive with second-hand motor.      what should i offer. i'm sure the friend will take whatever i offer. she is not a close friend and tends to be quite concerned about caring for her own welfare. i don't want to be cheap or cheesy nor to give excessively either.
