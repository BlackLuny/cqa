CDEvzgLjaa	One Icey Knight seems to be right on. I have a pug that is scared of her own shadow. I bought her as an adult and she has come a long way but she'll never be right. She is the sweetest dog in the world. Some of the most valuable info I have found about pugs is a site called <a href="http://www.pug-puppy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pug-puppy.com</a>|`|2IOFXmQ2aa	I'm afraid that your dog may have not been socialized responsibly when it was a pup.  There's a period of time in a dog's life, 8 weeks old to 16 weeks old, where one must expose a puppy to everything it might encounter in its adult lifetime, including strange or different people.<br>  <br>  One thing I can suggest is to reward your pug whenever he is behaving well around humans.  Praise him and give him biscuits/treats when he does something good.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, DO NOT "comfort" him when he cowers near or runs to you.  Petting him when he is being anti-social only encourages this behavior.<br>  <br>  feel free to look me up if you need more advice.
oB1TH9Auaa	Your best bet is to go to www.petfinder.com - it lists dogs at shelters all around the country.  <br>  <br>  It is best to rescue a dog that needs it.<br>  <br>  Our dog (boxer/mastiff mix) is a petfinder rescue and is the best dog we could ever have found!|`|bb0297f30d7f5b469448e26e00671fa3aa	I would look for a local breeder. The AKC likely would know of a good breeder in your area. However be aware that Great Danes do have health issues, like any animal. They also have a shorter life span from what I've been told. Make sure to stay away from anything connected to a puppy Mill!
C1eHfhrHaa	First of all, those are very different breeds.  The shepherd will need lots of exercise, playtime, and obedience training.  Shepherds need a job and will not simply laze around the house.  The bulldog will not need nearly as much exercise, will need to be in a carefully controlled climate because of it's short nose, and will not need as much obedience training.  Both dogs need firm owners who will be in charge all the time.  Twice the puppy means twice the poop and pee to clean up while you are house breaking.  Twice the chewing and twice the expense of training.  And finally no dog, no matter how trustworthy should be left unsupervised with a small child.  It is a recipe for disaster.|`|iVQULHqYaa	If you are working full time and leaving them alone, there is every chance that they will grow up to be aggressive hooligans. Puppies will damage the furniture pee on the carpets and jump up at the baby when he starts to walk.<br>  If you are considering getting two puppies to compensate for leaving one puppy alone all day, think again. Dogs are not a necessity of your life; however you are a necessity of their lives.  Your puppy will need you and it should not be left alone to suffer in misery. Any dog that is left alone all day will become anti social and miserable. There are answerer’s on Yahoo who recommend cages/crates. They leave their dogs alone and because they are crated/caged they neither pee nor poo. Most of these dogs suffer from Separation Anxiety plus bowel and bladder problems later in life.<br>  <br>  Getting two puppies at the same time creates enormous problems. Potty/toilet training becomes a nightmare. If both of them decide that they want to pee on the carpet at the same time, picking them both up and taking them out to finish off in the garden/yard is almost impossible. In any event how can you potty/toilet train them if you are out all day. <br>  <br>  When you take a puppy out into the garden/yard to do its pees and poos, you must praise it when it does so. However if one dog is at the other end of the garden/yard, it’s impossible to watch them both.  <br>  <br>  Another example is when you will want to praise one of the puppies for performing and the other puppy is chewing your foot, what do you say?. How can you train two puppies without confusing them? With two puppies neither of them will understand your commands or your praise.<br>  <br>  Apart from the potty/toilet training or whatever you call it in your part of the world, there are other aspects of training to consider. Two puppies will bond, they don’t need you, consequently they will want to play with each other, you are not important to them. They will not be bothered about coming back to you if they are running loose, they have each other. <br>  <br>  Play training a puppy helps you   to bond with them. So what, the puppies thinks if it can play with another puppy why should I listen to my mum or dad. My puppies and my adult dogs don’t know that I am strict with them, I use the soft approach. Although I am laid back I am in charge. You will never be “in charge” if you get two puppies at the same time.<br>  <br>  Please don’t get a puppy to leave it alone all day. Perhaps you are a caring person who has never had a dog and you do not appreciate that this is cruel. You must consider how your puppy will feel if is left alone.  There are day crèches, dog walkers and friends who can help you. <br>  Apart from the veterinary costs, you must make financial provisions for your dog if you are out all day. <br>  <br>  You must also consider that if you want to move, there are very few landlords who will rent to dog owners.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to get a cat.|`|5WggUmJeaa	I think they would get on but it would be fairer for the german shepherd to have a more mobile play mate.|`|3qeHMWW2aa	Any breed of dog can get on with any other breed its all about how you bring them up.  There are pros and cons for getting them at the same/different ages.<br>  <br>  If you get 2 puppies the have each other to play with and for company and they also will get on because they have grown up together.  If you get one train it and then the other it can be easier as the new pup will learn from the older dog and you don't have 2 dogs to toilet train at the same time and 2 dogs eating your stuff :)<br>  <br>  Only you can make that choice!  Both breeds have different excercise/training/feeding requirements but that is something you can work out between yourselves.  Maybe if your bf wants the german shephard he can take it for a run or something or vise versa.<br>  <br>  As for temperment the key thing is there upbringing.  Like people any dog can be aggressive no matter the breed if it is brought up in that way.  I wouldn't leave them alone with children but if they grow up around each other you may find in a few years they have developed a good bond.<br>  <br>  Best of luck xx
KToEYmwWaa	Well if you live in the cleveland area I go to a great vet who is a rat specialist.  If you don't maybe find a new vet who really knows rats.  Otherwise, if you think she is in pain I think the best thing to do is put her down, because it sounds like she keeps getting new ailments.  It's such a hard decision to have a loved pet put to sleep , but at 2 and 1/2 years she is a very old rat and will most likely never regain her health.   <br>  <br>  Good luck, and I'm so sorry about yours and sally's situation.
qw9ZjAlDaa	I'm guessing she said mullen.<br>  A mullen mouth bit is just a straight bar.  They are generally thought to be pretty gentle, but of course that depends on the hands behind them.  You can get a mullen mouth bit with a lot of different types of cheekpieces.  For HUS, I would guess you'd want to go with simple eggbutt cheekpieces.  Here's a link to an appropriate bit:<br>  <a href="http://www.shop4bits.com/item--Eggbutt-Mullen-Mouth--Eggbutt-Mullen-Mouth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shop4bits.com/item--Eggbutt-M...</a><br>  Now you can also get them in the "happy mouth" version, which are coated in an apple flavored polymer and are a bit softer than just straight metal, which is a nice option.<br>  <a href="http://www.smartpakequine.com/ProductClass.aspx?productclassid=4985" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartpakequine.com/ProductCla...</a><br>  <br>  The other things she may have said was "Myler" which is a brand of bit.

But unless she specified which particular bit, I have no idea which to tell you she meant because they make a gazillion models.|`|F0oWWCLQaa	mullen?<br>  they look like this: (different types)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.horsetackinternational.com/images/240748-dressage-mullen-mout.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsetackinternational.com/im...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestfriendequine.com/images/249947-mullen-mini-bit.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestfriendequine.com/images/2...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://okcorral.co.nz/images/Bits/ssmulleneb.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://okcorral.co.nz/images/Bits/ssmull...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thirstybootstack.com/items/53.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirstybootstack.com/items/53...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  A mullen would generally be used for a horse that is further in training and doesn't need the independent action of a bit like a jointed snaffle... <br>  at least i think...im not sure how my trainer explained it EXACTLY.
F3FrZ7eAaa	First off, no one here can possibly know. What kind of snake is it? Ball Pythons are famous for their eating "problems", although some eat like champs. Are all the temperatures right? Humidity? Is he new? If so, those can all make him feel stressed and uncomfortable. Also, make sure the mouse/rat is the proper size! I cannot stress that enough. My snake won't touch anything too small, or anything a little too big. I pretty much have to hand pick my mice at the store. Some say feeding at night time works, considering they are nocturnal. Last but not least, if he's maintaining a healthy weight, it's fine for him to go off feed. If he's loosing a lot of weight, that's when you should be worried and visit a vet. Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Wintertime is their breeding season, and it usually begins once temperatures start dropping at night. Many Ball Pythons will not eat during this time, regardless of whether or not there's a snake of the opposite gender around.|`|68kRhQdTaa	its not a problem snakes can go two years without eating they eat there heart and then a new one takes is place.|`|lING8JbJaa	More information is needed to give a good answer.<br>  <br>  What kind of snake?<br>  How old is it?<br>  What's its tank setup like? Temps, humidity, tank size?<br>  What're you trying to feed it?<br>  How long have you had it?<br>  Any sign of mites?<br>  <br>  Is it making any wheezing or clicking noises when it breathes?<br>  Is there any mucous coming from the nose or mouth?<br>  Has it lost any weight?<br>  Does it breathe with it's mouth open or FREQUENTLY stare up?<br>  <br>  If you can answer 'yes' to any of the last four questions, see a herp vet. Otherwise just answer the first set of questions and I will try to help you out.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	balls are a pain-this is their breeding season.have a male balls that doesnt eat for months for 3rd year.if hes healthy he will be fine|`|oSXRSKFSaa	i think you should take it to the vet.i hope it feels better.
YKrzEgyjaa	Dogs seem to love cat food and I used the chunkey meat kind for treats for my dog I just wash the gravy off but and older dog may want it for the added nutritional value like extra protein which dogs seem t be able to sense in it. The dog won't be hurt at all by the food but your cat might be a bit put out by the 'arrangement' so a good way to stop him is to put the cat food up high, cats can jump and will do so especially for food.|`|2P5WRadhaa	Don't leave the cat food out. Take it up. If you're feeding the cat on a casual "eat it whenever you want to" basis, you probably need to retrain the cat to eat when you feed it,(Ha - fat chance) or else keep the dog locked away from the cat's food. This is a problem you'll have to work out because of the feeding habits you employ for your animals.|`|Yqy9fXcyaa	you should take your cats food and put it like in a room when its going to eat and shut the door. or put the cats food in its kennal and keep the dog as far away as you can.|`|FAlZFYwnaa	Keep it out of the reach of your dog.<br>  Also, if he can't chew his food, water it down, let it sit for a minute, and then feed it to him.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	Put the cat food where the dog can't get at it. On top of the clothes dryer is a good place unless you have a very large dog. The other thing you can do is to only put out as much food as the cat will eat at one time.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	Yu should buy your dog wet/soft food or put a lil water in his regular food so it soaks it up and becomes soft.|`|tY14vbrKaa	Either feed the cat behind closed doors, or put it up where the dog cannot reach it.<br>  <br>  And if he can't chew his own food, perhaps a vet visit and then a change of diet is in order.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	put the cat food up on the counter or in a room with a gate.  Teh cat can jump over or go under, but the dog can't get the food.|`|ZZWiUGr4aa	He eats it because you leave it out.

fgxajTiBaa	Have the vet check for sarcoptic mange.<br>  <br>  My dog had Demodectic mange when I got him and was exhibiting the same symptoms of your cat. The difference between the two is one is a viral problem, the other is a zoonotic (transferable between species) issue. I would honeslty get him in tomorrow if you can because Sarcoptic mange is a big deal and you DONT want mange spreading anywhere else. I hope for your sake that I'm wrong, good luck!|`|PuKbqGDXaa	One possibilty is that you have one serious ringworm outbreak, you need to contact a vet or animal supply store, and get a cream like Miconazole and a wipe called pledgets(this also has Miconazole) these two oinments workin together do wonders at our animal shelter especially with feral cats|`|kVeL7dvzaa	The vet should be able to diagnose the right pet medication.|`|TEzQ9UyQaa	Maybe Scabies?|`|lweUU95waa	i recently had an issue with itching . however our situations differ a bit. hopefully my experience and insight will be of value to you. my problem began after taking in a hitch hiking bum. he smelled horrible but i thought nothing of it, i just figured it was his puke and **** coverd shirt . i took him home and bathed him. it was then i noticed a severe rash on his chest and anus. i asked him what had happened but he only answered in grunts. after a few days i began itching. the bum still smelled terrible. when i started puking and losing my hair i decided the bum had to go ! when the bum left my problems went with him ! i know bums n cats are way different but it could work !
C1eHfhrHaa	Yes- you can have her spayed and the vet will abort any puppies that may be there, which is the best thing to do anyway.|`|PM23RDycaa	Yeah its called having her SPAYED. I'm sorry but I am going to be mean. When she was given this diagnosis she should have been spayed and all thoughts of breeding her again stopped. <br>  <br>  Have your pet spayed problems solved.|`|ydshiNrKaa	Yes they can abort the pups.  You really should have her spayed since she has this condition.|`|1gbR22CRaa	Yes, They can abort them. If you love her so much you need to have her spayed.

iXijnCxOaa	Actually.. that's a very old-time fur whitening recipe.  <br>  <br>  I've never used it, so I don't know whether the dog would eat it - but if I were attempting to lighten staining I wouldn't let the dog eat it or lick it.<br>  <br>  Edit: Peroxide is a bleaching agent - (its the base for most human hair bleaches) the Milk of Magnesia is a catalyst (heightens the power of the peroxide) the corn starch is used to make it into a paste so its easier and more controllable to apply.<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  <a href="http://www.sandonoakhill.com/documents/Grooming_Tips.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.sandonoakhill.com/documents/G...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/grooming/grooming5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/groomin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ontheridge.net/oddsnends.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ontheridge.net/oddsnends.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://houseofbulls.com/Tips.htm" rel="nofollow">http://houseofbulls.com/Tips.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://en.allexperts.com/q/Dogs-701/2008/5/Shih-Tzu-4.htm" rel="nofollow">http://en.allexperts.com/q/Dogs-701/2008...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.stainexpert.co.uk/TearStainsTheWhiteDogOwnersNightmare.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stainexpert.co.uk/TearStainsT...</a><br>  <br>  Maybe its the fact that I own/breed white dogs that I am not as horrified .......<br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  The reality is, people now simply buy human hair bleaches to lighten/brighten which is FAR more dangerous that what this recipe proposes.  Different whitening shampoos rely upon a variety of methods of lightening - including enzymes and optical brighteners (purples).  <br>  <br>  If I needed to lighten a stain, the best shampoo *I* have found is White Lightening - however, it can be VERY hard on the coat.  <a href="http://www.showdogstore.com/1allsystems-a7purewhitelighteningshampoo.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.showdogstore.com/1allsystems-...</a>  <br>  <br>  Best bet is to figure out what is causing the stains (diet, water) and to avoid getting them in the first place.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	Who told you to do this is an idiot.

P8Q39vA4aa	Yes the come in Scooby's color, not only is it rare but it is a fault so breeders don't intentionally breed for it. I think its called a chocolate merle.<br>  <br>  The colors people are listing are the recognized colors, but there are some colors that are not recognized because they are washed out colors that tend to carry health problems like the whites are always deaf in danes.<br>  <br>  This is a chocolate great dane<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/greatdanephotos.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/greatdanepho...</a><br>  <br>  And no they don't come from bad breedings often they come from good breedings.<br>  <br>  Edit- Its because they can carry life threatening health problems. Because Chocolate is recessive and it takes two recessive genes for it to show. Any of the recognized colors can carry that gene.<br>  <br>  Edit- If say a reputable breeder has a dog that test positive for the chocolate gene they can produce a whole litter of washed out colors. Cause that is essential what chocolate is its a washed out black color. <br>  <br>  It doesnt necessarily come from bad breeders. Some of the best breeders in the country have had chocolates. There are tests for that gene they can get.|`|oGHtaaCkaa	I'll be honest I've never seen one in his color, but apparently they do?|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Yup!<br>  <br>  Its called "Mantled Chocolate", and its not a popular or common coloration, but its a coloration.<br>  <br>  There is also a Chocolatequin coloration, the dogs have a chocolate or white base with white, black, or chocolate discoloration spots.<br>  <br>  Scooby may have even been a dumbed down version of the Chocolate Merle.<br>  <br>  (Is it sad that I was thinking about this very same question earlier today while watching Scooby Doo on Cartoon Network!?)|`|tY14vbrKaa	The Fawn is pretty Scooby style here's some images:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=fawn+great+danes&rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-SearchBox&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=ie7&rlz=1I7GGLR&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=LBWvScnLO5m0sQPH08WDAQ&oi=property_suggestions&resnum=0&ct=property-revision&cd=1" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?q=fawn+g...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  Or a really patchy Brindle  like this one:<br>  <a href="http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/IMAGES/Pennsylvania/great-dane-chihauhau.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/IMAGES/Pe...</a>|`|C1eHfhrHaa	danes come in fawn, black, blue, mantle, harlequin, brindle and merle.  merle is grayish with black spots and the fawns do not have any black except on the mask.

We named him 'Paws' because two feet were affected but maybe you could call you're 'Little Foot' or something. Paws has been living a very active life and wasn't rejected by his mother and infact he's actually the largest from his litter of five boys|`|BcE4vftbaa	8 days is a bit early for eyes to open, but not freakishly so.  I would not worry about that.  As to the deformed foot, as long as massaging does not appear painful to the kitten, go ahead, it won't hurt.  If the deformed leg seems painful or impairs her from using her other legs, amputation might be the answer.  Cats can live fine with three legs (though a few need a bit of help with grooming).  Sadly, people are not always as eager to adopt a three legged kitty, but she's only eight days old.  You have some time to find her a home and even if you can't, the shelter might be able to find her one.  I know a women who adopted a three legged dog.|`|fgxajTiBaa	I would imagine stimulating it would help to an extent, but not if her actual paw is deformed. You said you adopted her?

If the kitten was not going to make it the mother would have moved it away from the other kittens and it would die.  Actually someone is more likely to adopt her just because of the deformities.  If you have to take it to a shelter look for a no kill shelter.<br>  <br>  Dont worry about taking it to a Vet at this point...they will just tell you what most people on here are telling you.  Just watch it rub the leg get it to play with you some and dont worry about the eyes opening, I have had kittens open them at 5 days and did just fine!|`|D4N2btkvaa	You can only do so much no matter what you try.  It needs veterinary care. Early intervention could make a big difference. If you adopted the pregnant cat from a shelter then they will provide free medical care for this kitten, if you get it checked out at the shelter you got the mother from.  It is about time you get the mother and kitten checked out anyway.  Good luck getting them there, and good luck with your kitten.|`|vZ0Ml4FVaa	I would take the cat to the vet asap because they might know what to do and yes they would probably put it down also because it will soon be kitten season and with all the others it will never get picked.|`|MdrCL60caa	It may help.  I would give it a try. She's so young that her muscles are still developing and it may do some good in stretching the leg a bit; but it won't cure a deformity. As for the SPCA - yes they will most likely put her down as she will be considered not as likely to find a home. What I would do is go on Craigslist and Kijiji for your area and post an add to see if anyone would consider adopting her. Cats are really adaptable and having been born with these deformities she will probably get along just as well as brothers and sisters. I have a blind cat at home and you could never tell if you didn't know it about her. She can still have a good life. Put up an add for a special kitten that needs a special home. If that doesn't work go on Petfinder.com and see if theirs any area rescues that might take her into foster care(or at least advertise her on their own website.) Hope this helps. Good luck.|`|srjPOxW7aa	Yes, massaging the the leg will help stimulate and get blood going to the damaged tissue, but not necessarily make it non deformed. but possibly allow the kitten to get better use out of that leg.<br>  I have 5 cats myself and I have kept many more kitty's at one time, just to be a foster home until I find the right new home for them, if you keep enough friends/acquaintances you'll be surprised how many will either take them into their life or help find someone who will :)
YedeC4D5aa	possibly a long-term relation to DDT? i tihnk its just plain abnormal, like i had a friend with 11 toes, nothing wrong with him tho. i think it's just a minor mutation|`|M3pjhIecaa	I've had fish where the feeler has been split so appeared to have an extra appendage, however, I'm sure there are plenty of genetic mutations going on with the lines the breeders use.|`|aru19IwLaa	I have a giant gourami and he has 3. Its ok i guess he was born that way loll!
y0SxRqMkaa	You should really take her to the vet, the problem isn't that she is eating alot, you should control it, the problem is that she most likely has a clog in her digestive system and needs to be put to sleep or be operated. But if it happens once, it could happen again.|`|uY8yP8EPaa	It sounds like you should take her to the vet! :(|`|SwlJJaT5aa	Take the poor sweetie to a vet please!

lFg3l7Lyaa	because there was only one review and that person probly didnt know $h1t bout dog food. and yah the ingredients do look crappy.|`|OuI5eFcmaa	I'm so glad you pointed this out - this brand was recommended to me and I was thinking about switching. I'm sure I would have checked the ingredient list before purchasing, but thank you for saving me the time.|`|1c9bb9b0490977041030a1689485e446aa	Organic dogfood is VERY popular now, dogfood from box stores are full of crap|`|AA10112346	This actually good food.<br>  No by products for the ingredient or corn or gluten even.|`|FNYEkyqLaa	California Natural is a super premium dog food.  It has chicken meal, not meat meal, big difference.  Chicken meal means the moisture has been removed from it.  Chicken meal is made from whole chickens and is a quality ingredient.  Since it is first on the ingredient list that means there is more of it than any of the following ingredients.  Rice is not a "filler" ingredient.  It is a quality product, whole grain and not something of a lesser quality product as "brewers rice" would be, it provides carbohydrates.  It is a grain and grains are needed to make kibble.  California Natural was designed to be a simple kibble with minimum ingredients for dogs that may be allergic or have digestion problems.  It provides all the nutritional requirements as specified by AAFCO.  Again, it is a super premium dog food.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Maybe you should STUDY the material that is available here before making such statements about someones product.<br>  <a href="http://dels.nas.edu/banr/petdoor.html" rel="nofollow">http://dels.nas.edu/banr/petdoor.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog/nrs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nap.edu/catalog/nrs/</a><br>  <br>  You will find that for some dogs restricting the protein to just one source (chicken meal) is the right approach.<br>  If the only meat source was "chicken" instead of chicken meal THEN you would have a need to be worried.<br>  <br>  go to aafco.com if you would like to learn the definitions of the ingredients<br>  <a href="http://www.braypets.com/FRR/aafcodef.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.braypets.com/FRR/aafcodef.htm</a>|`|KxjUim7yaa	I agree. Not something I think a dog should eat for a long time, but as stated, might be useful in trying to test for dog allergy. Lots of vitamins included to cover what the dog would be getting naturally in another brand.<br>  Meat meal gives more protein by weight than meat does in the overall list or ingredients in dog food. Many people think meat meal is bad, but it isn't.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	If it just said "meat meal" it would be dubious because it could be any kind of meat or mix of meats.  But it says "chicken meal".  A meal is the meat with the water removed, so it actually has more of the meat product by weight (in this case chicken) than if it just said "chicken".  Just "chicken" means with the water included.   By-products are the ingredients that are of no value.<br>  <br>  All dog kibble has to have some kind of starch as a binder, even grain-free foods have potato or sweet potato as a binder to hold the kibble together in processing.  They just don't use corn or wheat as the binder.<br>  <br>  If you read the end of the review, it says it's aimed towards dogs with allergies, so it only has 3 main ingredients.|`|tY14vbrKaa	It looks pretty standard for a "premium" dog food to me.  But I hear ya.  I'm not sure.
qeOlkRM0aa	How are you picking up your bunny?  Are you just grabbing her around her waist/ribs? They don't really like that.   Its very unnatural for them, and they feel helpless.They like to have their feet on something. I like to scoop them up quickly by the butt then hold them closely so they feel secure.|`|SwlJJaT5aa	Natural instinct. That's why i got a guinea pig instead of a rabbit.|`|RjlBrP98aa	Try starting small. Try this sitting on the ground with her. For 1 week, every day offer her a small treat and put your hand under her chest. That's all, just give her a treat and put your hand there for a few seconds. Do it again until she's had enough treats (don't give too many lol). <br>  <br>  The next week, do the same thing only lift her chest gently off the ground, not too far, just a little bit to where her paws are off the ground. <br>  <br>  The week after that, if she's comfortable with it by then, start putting your hand under her backside as well as her chest and gently lift her chest. <br>  <br>  The next week start to lift her whole body very gently and not too far. Just like pick her up and put her a foot away or something. Do this on the floor too so that if she kicks or flails, she won't get hurt. Remember all the while giving her treats so she assocaites the picking up with good feelings.<br>  <br>  And then the next week starting picking her up and standing up with her, maybe walking around with her or putting her in your lap.<br>  <br>  After a month or so she may be much more tame and willing to be held. Some rabbits don't like being held ever, but this is a sure way to make her feel as comfortable as possible. Eventually she will trust you and know you don't want to hurt her. <br>  <br>  Just be sure to support her chest and her bottom and feet. If she kicks too much she could damage her spine. <br>  <br>  Also, try petting her to relax her more before you start trying to pick her up. Make sure she isn't busy exploring or playing when you try to do these things or she will be annoyed that you're distracting her.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)
gIJ5JDdvaa	honestly theres nothing you can do, you were blessed with a loving heart the only thing you can do is let time pass and just remember the good times but since it was a puppy theres not many, but i definitely understand where you are coming from and i promise it will get better and maybe in the future you will even get another puppy but the humane society is filled will loving dogs that may help you get over your puppy not saying that you need to replace him or anything im just saying it will get better.<br>  good luck|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	First, don't try to second guess the Vet. The things you read didn't examine the puppy. Your Vet did. Just learn from your experience and know that sometimes even when you do everything right, the puppy still contracts Parvo and dies. <br>  <br>  Grief is normal.

35ec6de4ea609e86fc38f85f50b35a3baa	Hopefully this may be of some help to you:<br>  <br>  The first thing you must establish with the dog is that you are the leader ... not the dog.<br>  <br>  Have the dog at your side before you walk out the door and make sure the dog is calm before heading outside.<br>  <br>  You walk through the door first - that will show him/her that you are leading this walk.<br>  <br>  Use a gentle leader collar and regular leash - no flexible leashes.<br>  <br>  Keep a loose lead and change directions quickly on occasion. When he catches up with your turn, reward with a treat. <br>  <br>  If your dog gets ahead again, change directions.<br>  <br>  It will take some time and possibly a lot of repetition and you may feel a bit daft at first, but soon he will learn to pay attention to where you are going - and not just where he wants to go.<br>  <br>  Once you have the dog well under control on a leash ... you can then start to 'train' off leash.<br>  <br>  Good luck - and persevere ... that's the key!|`|dWK0B5g3aa	You need to teach him to heel by walking him on a lead and rewarding him with treats. Then the command 'go' so he knows when he doesn't have to heel you anymore. Try with shorter distances and progress to having to heel longer, eventually your dog will learn that heel generally means 'stay by my side until I say you can go'.|`|BcE4vftbaa	Try training him using treats.  Hold a treat in your hand and have him follow you for a while.  Give him treats and praise periodically as he sticks with you.  Keep doing this, spreading the intervals further and further apart until you do not need any treats at all.  You should also train him to come.  Get a really long lead line and let him run it out.  Then, call him.  Give him praise and a treat when he comes.  He will learn to associate coming to his name with positive rewards and eventually you will no longer need the lead line or the treats.

85pp4KGiaa	The feed I use is Mazuri pig chow. The average life span is around 20 years. Major health problems is being over weight and arthritis in older age. The are a challenging animal to take care of and it can be VERY overwhelming. If you haven't already gotten one, I would recommend doing a lot of research and maybe even finding someone who has one and talking to them. Pot bellied pigs grow to be a good sized animal and normally do not get along with dogs and small children. They are very smart and learn quickly. But they can make good pets if you have a lot of time to devote to them. If not they will over run you and you won't be able to handle them anymore. They can be very pushy and demanding at times. And it is hard to calm down a 200 lb pig. Honestly it is like having a two year old for 20 years. But like I said, if you fell you can take care of one and are ready for the challenge, then go right ahead! Good luck!|`|UxqSH3rOaa	Here's a site on Pot-Bellied Pig nutrition - <a href="http://healthypigs.easystorecreator.com/pig_nutrition.asp" rel="nofollow">http://healthypigs.easystorecreator.com/...</a><br>  <br>  The lifespan on the average pot belly pig is now considered to be 12 - 15 years. It was originally thought that their longevity range was from 12 to 20 years. The truth is that nobody knows for certain. The oldest potbellied pig we know of is one that died at 19 years of age. Keep in mind that the potbellied pig has only been in this country since 1985, so this pig evidently was one of the originals.<br>  <br>  This will tell you a little about their health: <a href="http://www.bestfriends.org/theanimals/pdfs/pigs/Pig_Health.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestfriends.org/theanimals/pd...</a><br>  <br>  Another information site: <a href="http://www.potbellypigpets.com/importantinformation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.potbellypigpets.com/important...</a>
dfb64b243bd35b4224dd85cc89895d3daa	Yes, cichlids do eat ghost shrimp, in fact most fishes love live food except herbivor-related fishes. I have seen it before and you are right feeding fishes with live food is nutritious and excellent for maximum growth. However, the cost of feeding and supply of live food are some thing you might want to think about.<br>  Nevertheless, if you are wealthy and your local pet shops do sell them, then why not.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Isn't that a little expensive? Not to say a bit cruel?|`|kKSpHtDWaa	Chances are you won't.  Fish are at their best when it's lights out and watching them with your face pressed against the glass won't help.  They'll undoubtedly eat the shrimp, just not with you watching.|`|M3pjhIecaa	Can i question how you are going to fit 3 medium sized fish that will measure in all likelihood half the size of the length of the tank, and add on top of that an RTB that will grow to 4.5 inch's. <br>  <br>  You will never get to see them eat anything as they'll die as soon as they start exceeding 3in, <br>  <br>  Besides which they're Territorial fish I know these fish need to be crammed into species tanks but 6sq inch per fish is the size the fish should attain. <br>  <br>  Some one buy this child a dog a big one that will bite his head off after a couple of days torment.
CqquoBy4aa	It is usually because of that.  You could buy a few more and it would be happier.  They don't like being alone.|`|ytGdMcQsaa	Yes most likely that is the cause. Piranhas like to be in groups
9S6VIDMLaa	Craigslist, that is where I got my dog.This site is very popular in my city in the States.  But make sure you find a perfect owner so the puppy doesn't have to switch homes again.
3KWodOgIaa	Maybe she sees him as her playmate n you on the other hand as her pack leader, he 4her is a play thing, n while he's around she wants to play with him n try her tricks, so as long as he is there she's all hyper n active, but when he's gone life suddenly seems boring & dull to her n best way to kill time is by sleeping. Do i make sense? Hope so ha ha|`|AxaspNJJaa	Maybe he tired her out, you know, playing with her.|`|RqEwgDRdaa	I don't know, but if your boyfriend is so wussified as to not make her obey him, guess what's going to happen should you have kids?

Your kids will be getting away with murder.|`|gIJ5JDdvaa	maybe she feels threatened by him and stays awake as dominance to keep you safe. or maybe even because he is so active towards her she doesnt want to miss fun time with him. maybe when he is home get him to act calmly around her to calm her down and let her get the feeling of serenity when he is around.
pYF9KnNeaa	You didn't give much information to help me know exactly what you want to accomplish.  If you are talking about something like a duck or a turkey that is dead but you want to safe the feathers, just pull out the ones you want.  However, if you are talking about a live bird, no matter what kind it is, the answer is simple.  You do not.  Don't ever try to pull a feather from a bird.  In addition to causing a lot of pain and making the bird never trust anyone again, you can cause a lot of harm and injury, including death.  If you should injure a blood feather, a bird could die from it because of blood loss.  A blood feather is one that still has an active blood supply coming into it.  If you are talking about pretty parrot feathers, just be patient.  They will molt and the feathers will fall out then you just pick them up.  Every feather on a bird's body is replaced at one time or other, throughout it's life time.  I have a large Macaw and have been saving his feathers for a couple years only and I already have a huge box full.  So, I hope that answers your question.  If not, let us know.|`|frE1TKsIaa	NEVER NEVER NEVER pluck your birds feathers! You just might get a blood feather. How would you like to have someone come up and pluck your hair one strand at a time. Think of your bird!!! The best way is to wait til they pluck/drop on their own!!!!
aIEJvhkjaa	Well, I see that you definitely have a problem. I feel for you and am going to try to give you some advice that I hope will work for you and your doxie.<br>  <br>   You should take her to the vet to make sure there is no underlying problem, such as UTI, kidney problems, or something else. If not, then we still have the problem.<br>    If she doesn't have a medical issue then it is pointing more towards the psychological part of it. She could be rebelling against the move. Dogs get used to a certain environment, and like children, they rebel when they are unsure of what is going on. She probably is confused as to why everything smells, looks, feels, and tastes different.<br>   You really need to move the pads closer and closer to the door, eventually getting them out the door, until there are no more puppy pads AT ALL. I agree with the other answerer's about her being too old to use the pads, she is no longer a puppy.<br>   I had a dog that was part doxie and she was very vindictive. Whenever she would get in trouble or got jealous of my ex husband, she would urinate or defecate on his pillow, his side of the bed, or his end of the couch. I broke her of that by showing her that he still loved her, that I still loved her, and that we could all share the love.<br>   I would definitely start with the vet, then try to just show her that you love her and make her more comfortable with her new surroundings. She needs to know that she is alright in her new home.<br>   One other thought is the dominance factor in almost all dogs. She may be "marking her territory" by urinating everywhere. You might have to buy some of that dog repellent spray. There is a repellent spray on the market that makes a dog not want to go towards that item, let alone urinate on it.<br>   Of course you cannot spray yourself with the repellent, but when she urinates or defecates on a person, she needs to be reprimanded and shown where she is supposed to do those things. <br>   Good luck.<br>  REMEMBER, TAKE HER TO THE VET FIRST.|`|ws4c4GDgaa	Ummm well i myself don't think u should use puppy pads anymore and have you tryed potty training ur dog because the longer you wait to do that the harder it will be to train them in the future. Maybe your dog thinks its ok to do all this because using the puppy pads as a toliet is no diffrent from using the house as one because the puppy pads are in the house. But I'm not a dog expert so the best of luck to u with ur problem.:]|`|AoSeHXeQaa	Maybe she is trying to "break in" the new place. :o)<br>  Seriously, she may be stressed out by the move, and not sure what to do in the new environment.<br>  Try confining her to a non carpeted area, or a crate until she figures it out.<br>  ( I would also suggest you teach her to go outside).|`|tY14vbrKaa	Step 1:  Vet<br>  Step 2:  Train your dog to potty OUTSIDE like normal dogs.|`|Y18vDUbaaa	our puppy had the same problem. she would either pee on a corner of the pad or completely miss it. we bought some of this spray that naturally attracts dogs to pee there, maybe try buying that.<br>  or take her to the vet to check if she has a UTI<br>  if none of that works.. start taking her out every 30 minutes to pee. 15 minutes after eating/drinking or heavy playing<br>  good luck!|`|fgxajTiBaa	This is why 99% of dogs are not succesful using pee pads. If you want your dog to go outside, teach her to go outside. To your dog, there is little difference between the pee pad, the carpet next to the pee pad, the carpet outside the room of the pee pad and the furnitue. Start over on potty training her outside and you'll have a much less smelly and much cleaner house.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Yes. She may be acting out. But why is she not trained to do her "business" outside like other dogs? I have 2 Dachshunds and they have had 1 accident in 5 years. Doxies are smart. You need to crate train her and take her outside. She is too old to use pee pads.When driving she needs a barrier or a crate. You might take her to the vet to see if there is a physical problem.

You must take him to the vet immediatly, this may be life or death|`|YVen9Hdkaa	Not sure what you're describing, but collapsed trachea was the first thing that came to my mind too.<br>  <br>  First - you go to the vet to be sure it was nothing serious.  Ask the vet if it could be a collapsed trachea.<br>  <br>  This is particularly common in small and toy dogs.  Their bodies are so fragile.  If you are pressing on their throat, or yanking on the leash - it can damage their trachea.  Then they do this "backwards sneezing" sort of thing.  <br>  <br>  It is also more common in hot weather or if they get too hot, then they start panting too much.  Then the throat gets swollen and inflamed from the excessive coughing or gagging.  <br>  <br>  The shaking is sometimes caused by the fact that the dog is just plain scared - because he doesn't know what's happening to him! <br>  <br>  My vet had to give my toy poodle antibiotics to get her over it.  Now I have to be careful that she doesn't choke herself when she leans her chin/throat on her bag carrier.<br>  <br>  Please be careful not to yank on your dogs leash.  It makes me so upset to see irresponsible people and little kids yanking a tiny dog around.  <br>  <br>  For this reason, a  harness (instead of a collar) is best for small or toy dogs, so there isn't a chance to yank on their fragile throats (even unintentionally).<br>  <br>  I hope your dog is okay.  Give him a hug!|`|gIJ5JDdvaa	if it is a chihuahua it has collapsing trachea which is common for that breed
YKrzEgyjaa	Cats are high maintinance just like people and some love attention no matter how much they get and will do almost anything to get it. I've had both attention lovers and haters. They generally choose when and where they want you and by god you'd better obey cause there's nothing worse than a cranky cat especially boys they have an inate ability to find the thing you love and pee all over it trust me, mine have done it. The difference in his voice could just be him changeing as he grows so unless it sounds painful don't worry about that too much. Every cat is an individual!|`|0jLj7yJpaa	If you are sure he's healthy, it's probably just a personality quirk. The cat I currently have is the most vocal one I've ever had and he has different meows for everything and talks constantly. I always worry I'm not feeding him or watering him enough, but I think it's just his way of talking nonsense. If the cat seems stressed or upset when he makes this meow, or if it lasts for a longer time than usual, it could be a few other things that you might want to ask the vet about. But it's probably nothing at all. You'll come to understand his Cattish in time.|`|AA11283573	Cats are just like that sometimes for no reason. They either really want a lot of attention or they're doing it just because they can.

Many people know that their dog is a dog, but whenever they look or think about her, all they see is human. This is actually very bad. Dogs have different needs that humans- they need discipline and rules. That is love to them. To lavish them with treats, love, and praise all of the time, they will develop behavior problems because of stress and pent up energy. Think about it- if you didn't have any rules for what you could and couldn't do, wouldn't be pretty bad? To have oder and structure in your life is something we all need, even dogs. Dogs are wired to be pack animals- to have an alpha and to get exercise. If they are not disciplined and given appropriate exercise, you are not respecting your dog for who she is- a wonderful, beautiful animal. <br>  <br>  People treat their dogs as humans because dogs don't judge people like humans do. They are there to talk to and don't have opinions or grudges, and live in the moment. They don't care what you did an hour ago, or even a minute ago. Dogs are cute and quirky and hillarious at times, and many people see them as their baby.<br>  <br>  Thank you for bringing this into discussion!<br>  <br>  Allygirl|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Add to the list:<br>  <br>  Where can I find cute clothes for my dog?<br>  <br>  How can I dye my malti-poo pink, purple, blue...?<br>  <br>  My chihuahua bites people and they get upset...<br>  <br>  My brother says I shouldn't give my dog a bath every day...<br>  <br>  It has been 61 days since my dog was bred and I have been taking her temperature ever half hour...<br>  <br>  And on and on and on|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Welcome to our elite club of "normal" people.<br>  <br>  We see these questions every day.

You might be thinking of stressed fish, if the guppy is swimming erratically, or lying near the bottom or not moving. DON"T WORRY, especially if you just got the guppy, because tropical fish need about a week to get used to their surroundings. When a fish feels more familiar with their environment, they will swim more actively, and will eat more. If you think your guppy might have a disease, check out the useful link below: <a href="http://www.fishlore.com/Disease.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlore.com/Disease.htm</a><br>  Good Luck! I wouldn't worry too much about it, the guppy will get better.

My husband and I are both lefties.  I watched my cat for the longest time to try to figure out if she was a lefty or righty.  It was tough and I finally decided she's ambidextrous, maybe lefty leaning as wishful thinking to keep us all 'southpawed'.  Toss something to her and which ever paw is closest to the trajectory, that's the one that snags it.  She's pretty consistent - whichever is easier - that's the one that reaches out.|`|RFXZbdPiaa	i have 7 lefties and 36 righties|`|fgxajTiBaa	I didn't know cats could be righties or lefties.

They are VERY intimidating to most people and you really have to know how to handle/train them to keep them well behaved. They get heart problems very easily. You need a huge house & a huge yard. They're not good around small children or smaller pets because they could hurt them. They eat a lot.<br>  <br>  Boxers have a LOT of energy! They get their name b/c they jump up on people & "punch" them in the stomach. It's actually pretty painful... my friend's 5 month old boxer left me with bruises on Christmas Day-- lucky me.

How on Earth did no one run to try to help??  For me, if I heard that kind of screaming, I wouldn't be able to keep myself away.  I would feel compelled to see WHY the poor animal was making that sound.  <br>  <br>  So my best guess - if your neighbors are in fact as sadistic as they seem - is that the original "object" seen was the neighbor's dog. It was dark, and obviously your uncle did not get a good look at what it was.  When the dog ran off, the kitten obviously either followed for whatever reason or simple happened to wander the same direction as the dog.  The sadistic jerks were probably hiding in the woods, ready to kill poor baby and THEN did the skinning.  Because really, there is no way they managed to skin that cat ALIVE without causing such a horrible sound that someone would have HAD to call the cops about it.  <br>  <br>  You NEED to call the police, and hopefully you still have the kitten's body because they can use it to make a case against the neighbors if they did in fact do this.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  ...I will first say I was in no way trying to be mean.  I really hope you didn't take it that way I am sorry if you did.  <br>  <br>  Now...your cops suck :(  If your neighbors did do this (something that seems pretty feasible considering the kitten wasn't eaten or anything) they more than likely won't stop there...and have probably done much much worse things.  Do you have an SPCA in any surrounding areas? They will travel pretty far...they can come out and get the poor kitten out of the shed and investigate the neighbors.  You could try them...|`|cj31x3UMaa	I have to agree w/ the other 2 answers. An ANIMAL would have no use or purpose for the SKIN of another animal. When they kill they go for the throat or neck to kill & then feed.

rTSwouqXaa	All our ranch horses work in the Argentine snaffle. And just to let you know Perelli calls them Engaging bits and then sometime you will hear of them called Tom Thumbs. Depending on the length of the shank will depend on the amount of leverage the bit has. We use the Argentine because it is still a fairly light bit on the mouth but has a bit more leverage for the older horse. And before any one get on my case for using these bits. I have never seen a bit hurt a horse. I have never seen a bit jump up and smack a horses. The hands that use the bit hurt the horse.
FNYEkyqLaa	This is a simple and tried and true technique for puppies that bite, and almost all do as that is how the explore their world.  When the puppy bites or mouths you, turn away a pretend that the dog has just bitten your finger off.  Cry out and turn away from the puppy.  Do not allow the puppy to gain your eye sight, keep turning away or leave the room.  Do not talk to the dog or have anything to do with it for about 10 minutes.  Why this works so well is because that is what other puppies in a litter would do when playing and one puppy bites too hard.  They yelp and stop playing.  Now your puppy wants to play with you and will soon understand that biting will end the play session.  See, you did not have to grab the puppy, restrain it in any way or yell at it, and it learned.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Here are a bunch of sites that deal with puppy biting.

During teething (generally starting around four months), the urge to mouth is extra powerful because it feels good on your pups' tender gums.

Truthfully, cats die of many problems we cannot cure or fix. Kidney problems are common in cats and many die from it so it was not your fault, especially since that cat died at the ripe age of 17. By the age of 17, that cat is old and his body just doesn't work as well as it did when he was a kitten. When it comes to feeding, I think having regular meals of dry food is the best option. It is nice to supplement a dry cat food diet with a milk product designed for cats (CatMilk) or wet canned food. My cat has dry food available 24/7 and is given a can of wet canned food or milk every other day to ensure variety in his diet. The best thing you can do for your cats is to make sure water is ALWAYS available. If you have to put out six water bowls, that's fine.

If he is medically fine, then yeah, as above, get a new kitchen door. If this does not solve the problem you may need to look at perhaps yours is not the best environment for him as he is clearly distressed and his habits are not only a health risk to you but he must be seriously annoying the neighbours. I do not personally believe it works, but some people have tried animal therapists.

9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	If the bird is fully feathered, it is most likely a fledgling and has left the nest on it's own and it's parents are caring for it. It is normal for birds to leave the nest before they can fly.   You need to replace it where you found it..preferably in a scrub or tree so it is relatively safe from predators, and the parents should come back to feed it.  If it is unfeathered...then look for a nest and if you can find it...replace it into the nest.  Do not worry about your scent being on the chick..birds have a very poorly developed sense of smell and will NOT reject a baby that has been touched.  If you cannot find a nest, get the bird to a local wildlife rehab for it's best chance of survival.  Also, keep in mind, it is illegal for you to try and raise this bird on your own.  Look for a rehab here:<br>  <a href="http://www.tc.umn.edu/~devo0028/contact.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tc.umn.edu/~devo0028/contact....</a>|`|CEgq26oHaa	You should put him back outside where you found him and hopefully his parents will come and take care of him.  Keeping a baby bird with no experience on how to handle them can result in their death.  I tried to rescue one before when I was about 12 years old and fed it, and was planning to teach it to fly and set it free, but it died two days later.  It's important for the mother bird to feed the baby, as they regurgitate the food for the baby to eat.|`|xJMhQAhfaa	If the baby bird has some regular feathers and some down feathers (look like cotton balls) he is a fledging and needs to be put outside quickly.<br>  His parents are around and will care for him. He is learning how to become an adult bird and this is very important.  (It is not too unusual for a fledgling to let you pick him up, he wants food) Peek out your window and watch and the parents will show up if you don't hide him too long.<br>  If the bird is a featherless baby then look for the tree he fell out of and put him back if you are able to do so safely.<br>  Caring and rehabing a baby bird is not an easy task, I don't recommend it if you do not know what you are doing.<br>  If none of those options are available, look for a wildlife rehabilitation group in your area and talk to them.<br>  <br>  Putting a baby bird back in the nest will not make the parents abandon him because of the human scent. That is an old wives tale.<br>  Most birds do not have a good sense of smell, they don't need to catch scent in the air. (Bird's of prey being an obvious exception.)|`|frE1TKsIaa	My suggestion is to look in a search engine in images type in wild birds in your area and good luck!!

Don't give him too much - you don't want him gulping down a bunch of food all at once which could cause him to get sick or worse.<br>  <br>  NEVER give your dog medicine for people (i.e.- aspirin) prior to getting advice from your vet.

5M57TTfpaa	you dont need a vet just because your rabbit is pregnant, and she will most likely not die! jsut like humans there is always the chance, but its not too common. your rabbit will be fine, just double her food intake and make sure she has plenty of water. the gestation period is 28 to 31 days, sometimes running a little late, but thats the average. close to time she will probably try to make a nest with her hay or whatever she can, and either right before or after she might (most do) pull her hair out for the nest. when she has her babies, count them and check to make sure they are all alive.you CAN handle them from birth, this gives them used to being handled. also, when they are born just make sure they have round bellies, indicating they have been fed. they should be weaned from mom around 5 weeks and you can find homes for them.  <br>  <br>  i didnt read all the way... but there is a chance she is not pregnant being that young. she probably wont be able to have any kits til she is at least 4 months, so you might be safe. if she shows aggression and her belly looks bigger though, i would increase her food.|`|XI2iylR4aa	WHY do you have two rabbits if you can't afford a vet?

But I don't know how big they are compared to the Cory's. Also I would suspect the bala's. Ms. Jessica's' suggestion about the fin rot is feasible but they all have the same problem and why not the rest of the fish, especially the pleco? I would try the sit and watch method. Turn out all the lights in the room except the tank lights and sit back away from the tank and watch awhile. Either way you will need to get some antibiotics for the fish and quarantine them while they heal. Luck 2 U.   Ray
iJtuhLMTaa	Budgies like many other Australian birds (cockatiels and zebra finches for example)  Don't have a specific breeding season like some birds do.  They simply breed when the conditions are right.  The right conditions are long days, plenty of fresh foods and a good nesting site.  If you don't offer a nest box, and limit the amount of light they get to 10hrs a day (this includes artificial light so cover the cage if needed)  then they should not begin nesting|`|QxIhMHwAaa	Just keep them in separate cages permanently (until/unless you want them to breed) and let them play outside the cages or in the cages together occasionally. When I had both a female budgie and males, I would keep them separate. Mainly because my female became extremely dominant over the males and wouldn't let them eat. I would agree to not give her anything in the cage that she could mistake or use as a nest...as that would promote nesting behavior, male or no male.|`|V58rYfEsaa	<a href="http://www.budgerigar.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.budgerigar.com.au/</a>|`|793RNStWaa	First, watch out for your wording in that first sentence.

I dunno I don't have kids (probs lucky kids lol)|`|Y02abtiwaa	hmm...thats a tough one. i think the best way to explain to a child that age is to let him know that your cat was sick and needed to go to a better place where he is happier. let him know that the kitty had a good life with your son but had to say goodbye because he needed to feel better. i have had to explain this to a child before and he seemed to take it better than if i was to tell him " the cat died. you wont see him again." i dont know if this helps|`|qJrNkMpUaa	Aw this is awful news. :( What i would say if i were in your position is that in heaven there are many angels, and every now and then a new angel is needed to help out with work, including kitties.

Think back to anything else that might have spooked him.|`|A7XV2K3Paa	Is there a fragrance to the blanket from washing? Sometimes odors really bother cats. Continue to watch him carefully and "listen" to his body language for answers. Try rewashing with a fragrance free soap.|`|zv8QaMe1aa	Did you use a detergent of fabric softener that's different?  If so, Oreo may really, really hate the smell of the new stuff.

PefglUNaaa	there is this thing in petco<br>  bitter apple spray, and u spray it on furniture. it tastes and smells like alchohal. this will stop your puppy. worked for me.<br>  <br>  mine please<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AthCSB..fe7tlRdjXP0tdxjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304125607AAw4lDq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  Mouthing and biting are natural, normal behaviors; all puppies do it. During teething (generally starting around four months), the urge to mouth is extra powerful because it feels good on your pups' tender gums. Lacking opposable thumbs, puppies also use their mouths to catch, carry, and play, making it all the more crucial that they learn how to control themselves in the presence of human skin.<br>  here's a treatment:<br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/biting-and-mouthing.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/biting-and-mouthing.h...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|M3pjhIecaa	Play with the dog with something he can chew on a toy or something like that then it becomes a game and she will focus on bringing you the toy to play with rather than worrying some other object. They eventually grow out of it.|`|PP0ZsoR7aa	This might sound a bit weird, but its something that we learnt at puppy pre-school. When you are playing with your puppy, if she bites your hand dont pull your hand away, push it further into her mouth. This will make her very uncomfortable, but wont hurt her. Depending on how bright your puppy is, she will learn to stop biting your hand within the first few times of doing it or at least the first few days, the trick is to be consistant, so every time she bites your hand you push your hand (gently) into the back of her mouth.<br>  <br>  Like i said, it sounds weird but give it a try. Good Luck|`|QmbrXrdIaa	She's teething and probably bored so she's going to need to chew. Have plenty of toys around for her during this time. <br>  <br>  As for the biting people situation, everytime there is ANY tooth to skin contact, pull away and say "OUCH" loudly. Stop playing or coddling, or whatever it was you were doing. If she's being aggressive, turn your back to her and in extreme cases, a one or two minute 'time out' (NOT in her crate) will do. Do not yell at her because she won't know what the heck you're carrying on about, and don't get aggressive or angry.|`|AxaspNJJaa	If she starts biting you, yell really loudly. It will scare her and she'll stop. Then if she keeps on going, then keep on yelling. She'll soon learn that she's hurting you or she'll hate the sound you're making. While you wait for her to stop teething, get her a couple chew toys. Just a bit more, you don't want to much.Hope I helped. =)|`|a108feb2e121c5dbe12470d4f1ab3002aa	You need to experiment and figure out what chew toy she likes best. Many dogs like bully sticks (made from beef tendons). There are also "stinkless" varieties as well. Rawhide or pigs ears are also popular choices. Some people prefer Nylabones. The key is to find something that your puppy likes and teach her to do her chewing with this toy. By the way, real bone is never recommended as small bits can get in their intestinal track and cause damage.|`|eBZnlSv4aa	your puppy may be teathing. in that case you may want to give her pupsicils. you can get them in any pet store. ice cubes can be both a play toy and a soother. if she is chewing on things she should not, take them from her and quickly replace it with a soft chewy toy. a squeaky. rawhide and bones can cause harm to your puppy. rawhilde can become stringy and cause her to choke. bones can splinter and enter her 1st stomach , and finding it's self caught as it tries to reach the seccond stomach.<br>  good luck|`|AA11062812	Puppies nip.  The only sure fire cure is time.  They grow up and they stop.  My goal was to have my puppy sleep thru the first year!  Tire that little one out.  Get them outside and just exhaust them.

A cat is much easier to take care of clean up after and is more self sufficient.   You cant leave a dog alone in the house for a day or longer without taking to a babysitter, shelter, etc.   A cat you can leave alone with a litter box and plenty of food for the duration of your trip.|`|sEbE2qaPaa	Well, it depends on who you are and what type of lifestyle you have. Cats are best for small houses and apartments, as long as you teach them not to make a mess. Dogs tend to need much more space though, and shouldn't be kept indoors all day. (Excluding those tiny little yapping dogs, like Yorkies and teacup-poodles.) Cats are not as lazy as everyone makes them out to be. Most cats that are lazy are the kind that sit indoors all day. If you don't want your cat to be a fat couch-potato, then don't over feed it, and let it outside often. Cats are quite skilled hunters, and shouldn't be seen as lazy idiots simply because some owners let thier cats get over weight. My cats are actually very athletic, and I give them plenty of toys. I taught them to   <br>  walk on leashes, and to use the toilet. (Not joking! It's easier than you would think to teach cats to use the toilet, and perfect for owners who hate cleaning litter boxes. Google it.) When I come home from school or work, my cats meet me at the door. So in my opinion, cats should not be looked down on because they don't do the same things dogs do. Cats are quite intellegent, and you can teach them to do almost anything a dog can do. I have taght my cats to: use the toilet, <br>  walk on a leash with a harness, lay on their beds when I tell them, come when they are called, go away when they are told, and to make toast. (I discovered that last of kind of on accident....) So, thats about it. Just remember, there are smart cats, stupid dogs, stupid cats, and smart dogs, and you shouldn't judge a whole species based on one cat or dog.|`|cmJFC5LOaa	It depends on how you are with dogs and cats. If you love playing then a dogs is perfect for you. Then if you love cuddling with some thing fluffy and soft then a cat is perfect for you.|`|zzgtQKXpaa	CATS CATS VATS CATS<br>  cats dont drool or bark or **** in your lawn...well they do, but they got the brains to burry it.<br>  they get get their own food, dogs cant.<br>  and they are so much cuter!!!|`|wMCwxy2Raa	If your more of a layback kind of guy a cat, If your an active guy a dog.<br>  Cats are lazy Dogs are hyper, just remember that=]|`|PVzf9JUwaa	Dogs !!!|`|KlkUj6uFaa	Dogs.<br>  <br>  I think they are more loyal and loving than cats, although some people prefer the fact that cats are more independent.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	Cats.<br>  - Very rarely do you have to house break a cat. Often times even small kittens arrive knowing how to use the litter box. With Dogs it can be a short process or a long messy experience. <br>  <br>  - Cats LOVE to be around you but if you have to go all day they're quite happy to have the house to them selves. just as long as you come back and feed them or send someone to check in on them.  It's harder to leave a dog home for a weekend than a cat. It also tends to be easier to find someone willing to cat sit. <br>  <br>  - I know lots of dogs that eat their own poop but I don't know any cats. <br>  <br>  - Cats can be taught tricks and to walk on a leash. My cat knows how to sit. So if you want a pet you can walk don't assume a cat is out. <br>  <br>  - Cats clean themselves and don't track in mud<br>  <br>  - Cats make great foot warmers on cold winter nights<br>  <br>  - cats don't bark when ever a car drives by|`|Bw18seFqaa	depends on the person.<br>  <br>  If you are not a very active person and just want a housepet for company, a cat would be a good pet...  also if you live a somewhat busy lifestyle and you are away from home most of the day, a cat is also a better pet..  they are more independant.<br>  <br>  If you are an active person, and want a jogging buddy, someone to play fetch with, etc.. a dog is a better choice.|`|VmQBhY6iaa	DOGS!!!

YnCUyvK7aa	The plexiglass would work if you used silicon to keep it in place.  Or even a cut down tank divider.  I've also just used a shoebox or plastic dishpan in a corner and camouflaged the outside with larger rocks and filled in behind them with a matching color of gravel.<br>  <br>  If you wanted something more decorative to start, look in reptile departments for something used to hold back gravel to create a land area for a turtle tank.  I've seen mock bamboo walls, stone walls, and wooden columns like a fort.  As an example <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2753969" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a><br>  <br>  There are also dividers that are made of soft foam <a href="http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3150821" rel="nofollow">http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...</a> but these seem expensive and they have a tendency to get cyanobacteria or algae growing on them.  But any of these would work.  You could also make your own by cutting a sheet of styrofoam insulation [if you can find it without flame-retarding chemicals added] and paint it with aquarium safe paint or paint it with silicon and cover it with matching gravel or sand that you use for your substrate.  There are some DIY projects on the internet using foam and cement [I haven't used these myself] <a href="http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/diy_aquarium_background3.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/di...</a>  That 1 is meant for a background, but you could make a smaller 1 to create a wall to gold back the sand.<br>  <br>  As long as the front surface is rough, it doesn't have to slope, it can be straight up and down and the crabs can climb it.  This will give more room for the fish.<br>  <br>  For a filter, use a small internal filter.  Your water will probably be too shallow for a hang-on power filter to work well.  And crabs will want to climb any power cord or intake tube, so if you use a internal filter and just have the cord coming out, you can add a glass cover to keep the crabs and humidity in the tank.|`|nbtVuFVNaa	put gravel on one side and keep it as aslope for the base...then add sand on top ...1.5 females per male...so 3 females to 2 males......get a filter for turtles and amphibians...happy crabs:? :P
i5hio2Anaa	I believe you can get them defanged.<br>  I'm not sure what effects that can have to their health though|`|44kEtDvIaa	Depending on the species, the sting hurts, but not normally lethal unless you have an allergic reaction to bee/wasp stings.  All Tarantulas carry venom.  See site below for more info on the little creatures.  Quite fascinatiing pets, but aren't for everybody.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	The ones they sell in the pet stores are not lethal. Each tarantula does have venom, though.|`|wBzp5fOjaa	all of them are just some are more than others. all the ones in the pet store are usually no more lethal than a bee sting but if you are allergic to its venom you could go into anifalactic shock and die so its not recomended to handle a tarantula unless some precausion is taken.hope this was helpful.    <br>  <br>  <br>           p.s: the best tarantula spiecies is a pink toe, pink haired, or striped knee.|`|TrTfowAQaa	those big fuzzy cuddly pets have venom to eat with... to get one to bite you... well you'd have to be really mean to it :( the area of the bite would swell and maybe change color... I've caught wild ones in AZ and they are very calm. move slow stay low to it feel and it'll just walk on you. but YAY for pet RATS! I have 5 females and my ratties rock! I love em and they potty train! so cool.|`|PVNOQi4aaa	I have a tarantula. I've looked into this many times. They all carry venom, but are only poisonous to you if you're allergic.<br>  I've been bitten plenty of times, so don't worry about dying or anything.|`|STgaknBIaa	well depends where you get them if you get them at the pet store then no but if you get on e from like a dealer out of the back of a van maybe and if you get one from the wild then obviously.
FC9J4aiuaa	Have him sit, and lay down, don't expect him to roll over the whole way, try to get him on his site, and threat him, then try again, and after he has that down, try for the rest. Brake it down more if he still has trouble. When you decide to go to the next step, don't treat him for the past step, dogs will think about why there not getting the treat, and will try to figure out what needs to be done to get it.<br>  <br>  If it's needed, keep his attention on the threat, and try to push him onto his size with your other hand, and immediately treat him.<br>  <br>  ONLY treat him when he does what you expected him to do (on his side, back, or all the way over) like other dogs, if u treat him for just laying down, he will start to get confused.<br>  <br>  Labs are usually very food motivated<br>  If the treats you are using don't seem to get his attention or motivate him, use something like pieces of ham or chicken.|`|BDYzoPAqaa	well before you do that teach him or get him confortable with laying  on his back. then teach him to roll over.|`|fa94015ff5f0c6080fd3861b1e008e8caa	Make him lie down then hold the treat firmly in your hand so he knows its there and follows it. drag it in a straight line a few inches above the ground and roll him over around on his back to his other side. if he tries to stand up dont let him, but if you cant stop him say firmly no and dont give him the treat.. keep trying again he'll get it with practise :)|`|AA10401377	labs like most dogs are food motavated so take a good treat and make it visible to the dog with the dog laying down put the treeat to his nose making sure the dog has eye contact with the treat then move the treat slowly around the side of the head making the dog have to turn its head to keep an eye on the treat and then move the treat around the back of the head to the other side ear level so that in order for the dog to keep a eye on the treat it has to roll over because its neck will only allow the head to turn so far before causing the dog to kinda like flip/roll. THIS WORKS I GUARANTEE IT! If the dog tries to outsmart you by turning it head the other way to try to catch the treat on the flipside-don't give up try just moving the treat to the back of the head just past where he can turn his neck but not to the otherside yet go SLOW he'll catch on. The easiest thing once you do it - it sounds complicated but just trail it around its head it has to flip over to keep eyem contact with the treat!!!!!!

wrUsMG4Jaa	Yes, they can.<br>  <br>  This is a two sided street, really. On the one hand, your dog has bitten someone, which is grounds for (a) euthanasia or (b) a seriously expensive fine. On the other, your dog was being annoyed to the point that it snapped and bit someone.<br>  <br>  Talk to your local authorities about your rights. Dogs don't have self defense laws (unfortunately), but you have the right to prove that your animal was in clear danger.<br>  <br>  Depending on the age of the person that was bit (the court will NOT see your side if the person was under 15 years of age, trust me), you may have a shot. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|bIaywrBCaa	if someone provoked an attack and then was injured by the dog, they could sue yes, but depends on what evidence you would have that the attack was provoked, was the dog on a leash, whose property was the dog on? A lot of "if" factors.|`|F2JEvYX7aa	You can't press charges unless it was done to your dog but you can call the police or the local ASPCA to report the abuse.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	I believe that the answer is yes, unless there are witnesses that are willing to testify to a judge that the dog was being harassed by the person.  Other than that it is a he said, she said kind of deal and the bite victim will win every time.<br>  <br>  Post this in the law section, you may get some better answers.|`|Bw18seFqaa	if the dog bit or attacked a person, regardless of circumstances..  yes, they can sue.<br>  <br>  Its up to the dog owner to handle and control the dog..  as the dog owner you also have to protect your dog from being harrassed.|`|V5Ib9BCsaa	im sure they could because the dog cant say that they were messing with them first. we live in a f*cked up society now a days|`|0R0uRNuIaa	Yes they could.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Anyone can sue over anything, it's a question if they can prevail.  And pressing charges is filing a complaint with police, which is different than suing.  It depends on the entire set of circumstances.  If they were on the dog owner's property and were harassing the dog, it would be difficult to win.  If the dog was off the owner's property and not leashed, the circumstances would be different.|`|AA11244754	If somebody injures your dog for no reason first you have to call the proper authorities to report what is going on then after they have gotten there and they say that you can take your dog to the vet (even an emergency vet) and you know or find out who it was that did this to your pet, then yes you can sue for your dog vet bills.|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	yes if you have proof and have filed complaints so there's a paper trail. i went through something similar a long time ago. the dog finally broke loose and bit the guy, but because i'd had video of the guy coming into my yard and staying just out of reach of the dog, barking and waving his arms and my dog, plus neighbors that had witnessed the harassment, when the guy tried to press charges the judge laughed him out of court.|`|0bDEGdRdaa	Yes, you can, if you were hurt and especially if it happened somewhere besides their property|`|zaYGRmOAaa	If the dog wasn't on a leash or fenced in, you may have a case...regardless if the dog was being egged on or not, I would think.|`|VaYjl71Laa	Yes they can, of course you if you have proof that they were doing this then they won't win.  Put on a no trespassing sign on your property and if he comes onto your yard... shoot the person.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	I think you can sue over anything. Whether or not they win is another matter.|`|Drnpe4T5aa	Unfortunately, yes.<br>  As a dog owner, we are expected to keep our dogs in our yards, so they are not able to harm others.  <br>  But if some ding-dong comes into our yard (trespassing) and harrasses the animal to the point of attacking, they can still press charges.  <br>  Also, if animal control were called, they can petition to have the animal euthanized (rules vary by city and state as to how many offenses an animal can have).|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	No one has the right to abuse a dog. If it is your dog, you can, if your witnessing abuse, call the SPCA/animal control. They can get charged, and even have the animal remove from the home if its the owner. No dog should have to tolerate any abuse to be deemed a "good dog".|`|LzXZQBHbaa	yes, if your dog is not fenced in they can. They can say the dog just tied in the yard was too much of a temptation and that they weren't teasing it, they were trying to pet it.  I have seen this type of case many times.|`|eKcQ41DHaa	Yes they still can! Through your homeowners/renters insurance policy and if you carry an umbrella policy also. This is the reason when you purchase renter's or homeowners insurance you are asked if you have any dogs and what breed.|`|QpElKY8Kaa	Yes, they can.<br>  <br>  You can counter sue, if you have good witnesses, photographic evidence, etc. to back up your claim. (and a good lawyer)<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|6MQsUhHLaa	yes. do you have proof or witnesses to defend the dog with, otherwise it's a he said she said thing.
3KWodOgIaa	Well 1st of all give a good healthy diet, n tat i believe ur already doing. Giving too much food is harmful, as it would expediate his growth process to soon while his skeleton system n bones will not be able to cope up so soon n at a rapid pace, so easy on the diet, read instructions on the bag n feed only as told, normally its mentioned as a graph, age vs weight, as to how much feed is reqd. , with frequency normally being 3times till 6months of age n after that twice. Secondly don't exercise him too much as his bones are soft n tender. Avoid slippery hard surface 4him, try soft n rough surface for proper gripping, never tie them up till they are at least 8-9 months, as this too leads to back leg bones damage such as bending of hind legs. His joints too are delicate. just walk him 4now, after like 8months start mild exercise, just like 10minute playing ball with him, do not vigorously exercise him until at least, at least he is a year old, n preferably till one n half year of age. Even after that since rottis by nature n built are not athletic dogs like pointers, don't over exert him. Make sure he gets enough calcium in his diet, as they come in giant breeds n CA req. is very high in growth period, consult ur vet n mk sure he is getting the reqd. CA in his diet, or else start supplementing him with CA tabs. That said, how he will finally turn out to be is dependent on his lineage n individual genetic setup, which u cannot change, what u can do is try ur best he gets the best diet n proper exercise n hope he is what u always wanted him to be......He still is a minor puppy, he got loads of time to be big n strong, work with him|`|C1eHfhrHaa	OK- easy on the exercise. He is too little for that much and you can damage his joints.  Little short walks and plenty of naps for puppies.  Find out what they feed their dogs- you may very well get similar results.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Maybe they use raw feeding or supplements like Salmon oil. Best way is to ask.|`|X3Ucz7xuaa	this is best mate i used it and gain 4 kg exercised and hes like a beast lol<br>  10 lbs. hamburger meat (the cheapest kind)<br>  1 large box of Total cereal (or comparable brand)<br>  1 large box of oatmeal<br>  1 jar of wheat germ<br>  1 1/4 cups veg. oil<br>  1 /14 cup of unsulfured molasses<br>  10 raw eggs<br>  10 envelopes of unflavored gelatin<br>  pinch of salt<br>  <br>  Mix all ingredients together, much like you would a meatloaf.

r7Lnsergaa	That's a Yorkshire terrier puppy, or a Yorkie for short. My family got our Yorkie when i was in fourth grade, she was 850 dollars then (about 7 years ago) so today she's be about 1,000 from a breeder. What's interesting is that My grandmother ended up buying her brother, who ended up being much bigger, and looking totally different. She's a great dog, very smart and always wants to spend her time in some ones lap. She has this odd thing where she attacks our cat toys. The Little mice are her favorite (Which makes sense because they were originally bread to kill rats and mice in the Yorkshire mines in England) she also likes toys with feathers for some reason. <br>  She doesn't like to chew on toys, so her teeth need to be cleaned, and the breed over all has dental problems. Teeth need to be cleaned by a vet at least once a year to prevent worse problems. Our dog also had some very serious digestive problems which i'm not sure are common to the breed, She has to eat special food now and no longer gets treats from the dinner table.|`|JCUfH0CBaa	Its a yorkshire terrier. Their nickname is yorkie. They are very little dogs, under 10 pounds, and they are tan and black.|`|bqbrKFeUaa	That is a teacup yorkshire terrier|`|Dz8FNg8Uaa	He's a 4 mth. old Peekapoo.|`|AA11800619	Yorkie.

He focuses completely on his family, and craves attention, love and togetherness. He wants to be near you and will sit and cuddle in your lap--but only for so long! He loves and seeks out adventure, and can get into mischief if he isn't given enough to do. He is not a dog who can be left alone in a yard; he needs human companionship. He is a very high-energy dog who requires only moderate exercise because of his size, yet still needs to romp and play around the house, and chances to run free in the yard. He loves to travel, and he likes long, daily walks. He plays hard and seems to have a boundless capacity for fun. When outdoors, he should always be leashed or in a safely enclosed area, because he will chase after small animals. He is also fearless and assertive and will confront much larger dogs. He can get along with dogs and possibly with cats if he is brought up with him, but he will hunt and can harm smaller, rodent pets. He gets along well with older, responsible children, but does not have the patience for younger, smaller ones. He is a fragile dog who if handled too roughly will snap at them. He mustn't be tossed, or allowed to jump from high places. He is a friendly dog who likes people, although he can be timid with visitors if he isn't introduced to them while still a puppy. An outstanding watchdog, he is intensely protective, guarding his territory fearlessly with his acute hearing and his relentless, high-pitched bark. He can be annoyingly barky and yappy, and must be trained to stop yapping on command. He is easily trained, eager to please you and can remember many different commands. He excels at dog sports, especially agility. He can however be stubborn and willful if he doesn't get his way, and needs to be trained with a great deal of patience and praise. He is difficult to housebreak. He practically doesn't shed so he would make a good pet if you are a clean-freak.|`|A9FMHErmaa	yorkshire terrier puppy<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Yorkshire Terrier, or "Yorkie," is a dainty, lively, affectionate, happy, energetic, confident and devoted dog.

L22hVXTIaa	On average most dogs are mature at 18 months.  That is, they have most probably reached their mature height and weight.  However, some dogs continue to "fill out" until they are about 2 yrs old.  <br>  <br>  As to your problem with additional details - I'm not sure.  Whenever I add those, they're put underneath the post - odd.|`|0R0uRNuIaa	It depends on the breed. Most dogs stop growing anywhere between 10 months and 2 years|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	2 i think or 3|`|26PPwzrWaa	24 months. Especially for large and giant breeds. Growth plates dont close till 18 to 24 months.|`|TInJIfKfaa	I'm not POSITIVE but I think they are full grown at 2 years.|`|WWhYCAbSaa	You should know plenty about dogs since you've both owned them before.  Doesn't matter where you lived.  I just brought that up, because the way I understood it(the way it was phrased) was that these were your first dogs.  I thought you said they were your first dogs, and that you were "just learning".  No rudeness was meant by it.  Sorry.  As for my husband and I, we don't say that our dogs are our first, as we've both had dogs since childhood.  It's quite easy to misunderstand what's said, and take it as rude, because all one sees is what's typed, not the manner in which it is written.  Sorry.<br>  <br>  A dog is done growing at about 2 years old.
9kTejB0uaa	You know something - I'd bet she is picking up vibes from you!!!  Normally, even if they are very attached to each other, because dogs lives should revolve around you, the fact that one 'disappears' shouldn't be major as long as you are still there, and acting 'normally'.  I assume the other dog will be back later on?  I'd just take the Jackie out for a good walk (the thunder would probably keep me in, but pouring rain wouldn't necessarily!!) and play with her and she'll be fine.|`|1XLZdOcQaa	I'd say that with this sudden change, your dog becomes a little depressed. the loss (whether  temporary or permanent)  of another dog may be a great hurdle for them.<br>   <br>  You can try engaging yourself more with your dog by playing a lot with him and bring him new sets of toys to get him busy. Here's  a link that talks about this matter which might just give you a tip or two on how to properly handle the situation. good  luck!<br>  <a href="http://www.elfurl.com/j9dei" rel="nofollow">http://www.elfurl.com/j9dei</a>|`|AA11244754	Try taking her for a walk or if she can be taken to a dog park take her there and have some quality one on one time with her.  That will take her mind off her friend being out of the house for a little while.|`|kvHqnR5Haa	Do you have a friend who has a dog you could visit?  I know the car ride itself would be enough to calm my little guy down.  Maybe she just needs to be around another dog.  Good luck!|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	take her on your lap and cuddle her and talk to her gently she will be fine she is so used to him being with her she cant understand where he is and why he is not there
3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	This is 100% playing!  <br>  <br>  First, the whole situation with the ball...At first it appears that Zack is being toy aggressive (because of the growl and turning.)  However, Sasha hangs back and indicates she wants to play...and then Zack pushes his snout w/ ball into her.  This is him clearly saying, Okay, we can play (despite that he is still making the little growling noise...that is play, NOT a menacing growl.)  If one of mine has a toy and starts getting protective of it, he will give a few warning growls, attempt to turn away, and if it persists...he will actually snap (telling the other dog, no, this is my toy.)  At that point, I intervene and take the toy up, because it is not "his" toy.  I own the toys in the house.<br>  <br>  Second, notice the "bowing."  Your dogs both do a lot of bowing with is a big sign to the other dog saying "I want to play!"<br>  <br>  I know you were also concerned about the biting, pinning, etc.  Just from what was seen in the video...you have NOTHING to concern yourself with.  To be honest, I'd stop correcting them so much.  They don't get much of a chance to play before you put a stop to it.  Here's a suggestion:  Let them go at it.  Let them wrestle around and get noisy, etc.  Then see what happens when one goes to far.  I can almost promise you that you'll hear a yelp, see one back off, and they'll stop play for a moment.<br>  <br>  *One day when I get a video camera, I'll have to film my two rough housing to give you an idea of how scary it can look.  Just remember, dogs usually tell each other when it's out of hand.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	dont worry they are playing marie|`|26PPwzrWaa	It looks like play/disagreement on whos toy it is. <br>  <br>  What you need to do is take the toy away if you feel it gets out of hand. If your dogs growl, snap at you trying to get the ball, you are not leader. If you are the leader, you should have no problem retrieving the toy they are spatting over. <br>  <br>  The arguement was solved very quickly in that video. And I dont feel interference would've been needed.<br>  <br>  Now that KKingS mentions it, that is exactly the way I see it. <br>  Although, it is true if you cant grab the toy without a fuss, you are not seen as leader/above them in the pack.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	You will definitely know the difference in fighting behavior and playing. They are just playing and nothing to worry about. My dogs seem to draw blood from each other about once a week, they are bigger dogs and play really rough with each other. I wouldn't worry, you will know the difference if a fight ever breaks out.|`|4SQx8smEaa	....to me it looks like he is protecting his toy...and warning the other dog to back off.|`|LDdd6uAQaa	Your dogs are fighting for dominance.<br>  At the beginning of the video you show the poodle sitting on the furniture but the lab type id sitting higher up on the arm. This makes the lab type the dominant one at the moment.<br>  The poodle did instigate the squabble with the ball and is fighting for dominance.It then tried it again by going for the bone on the furniture.<br>  <br>  The problem with this is the poodle is very persistent and once it gains dominance it may well go for you. This is because both dogs have shown they are as good as you by going on your furniture.You must not let them do this in this case. You have to regain control of the pack.<br>  <br>  To do this stop them going on any furniture, by doing this you are claiming dominance again as you are permanently higher than they are, they should never tower over you. Their place is on the floor and in their own beds not yours.<br>  Make playtime be on your terms with the toys for the time being and make sure they are fed after you.|`|qqqboBY4aa	well usually when a dog draws blood there trying to fight the other dog.<br>  <br>  but  maybe there just trying to play, i don't really know though.<br>  <br>  when my dogs play to rough i use a deep voice and tell them EASY<br>  kinda loud.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!<br>  <br>  ~Ocean~|`|CyFLDrgQaa	It seems like Sasha is trying to not let Zac playing with toys.<br>  is she trying to become pack leader over him?<br>  Im sure Sasha is being playful<br>  and Zac is saying go away its my ball<br>  Your dogs are incredible cute!! ^.^|`|TInJIfKfaa	It looks to me like they are playing
5QicX6O4aa	WOW! I wasn't prepared to open the photo & see a dog that looks exactly like 1 of our most cherished dogs that recently passed on.<br>  <br>  I'd say absolutely shepherd (those ears are a telling sign) & black lab mix. Super intelligent & loving dogs they are.<br>  <br>  God Bless you for wanting to adopt her. I can guarantee you won't regret it. Awesome mix, again, highly intelligent. What a BEAUTIFUL DOG!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Part of it is clearly shepherd.  Lab is a maybe but it could be many things.  I would assume common breeds - shelters often put down uncommon breeds but 9 times out of 10 it's common breeds in your particular area.|`|W0ZQQK4taa	Black Labrador / German Shepherd Dog mix.<br>  <br>  Cute dog!|`|winPTRh9aa	shepherd x labrador mix|`|7Cis2pJEaa	How big is she? I see australian cattle dog! I have seen a few that are mixes that look very similar. My friend also has a chow/pit/shepherd that also looks similar, but with more of a think chow fur. I don't see any lab!|`|89owZt6Haa	in see mostly german shepherd in the muzzle and ears.  can't see overall size.  labs have down ears and would be similar boned as GS. If the dog is smaller than a shepherd, look in the herding or working groups for ideas.|`|IdSqunZuaa	There's a great possibility that this beautiful dog is a combination of these breeds, <a href="http://dogtime.com/german-shepherd-dog.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/german-shepherd-dog.h...</a> and <a href="http://dogtime.com/labrador-retriever.html." rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/labrador-retriever.ht...</a>|`|pd5rERcfaa	I think German Shepard with some Lab, probably.|`|x47cIHFMaa	i would say a sheperd lab mix.....|`|0e51HkpHaa	sheperd lab mix|`|0R0uRNuIaa	Hmm She looks like a lab/border collie/ and something else

Being a land where nothing can harm you and all wounds are healed. Where all aches and pains are forgotten and gone. Keep your eyes open. You just might catch him, out of the corner of your eye. Sometimes I can see my dog. A big black fuzzy blur out of the corner of my eye. I know it's him and it somehow comforts me, knowing that he's there. Keep your eyes open and your head up. You'll meet again soon. Trust me. Meanwhile, pull out some pictures of him and remember him. Talk about him. Get your feelings out in the open. Remember him. Time heals, my friend, time heals.|`|CuGT5X6eaa	it takes time,I know because I had to have my dog of 9 years put to sleep a little over a month ago,SOMETIMES (and I am not pressing you do do this because I know this is a horrid answer) but sometimes it helps to get another pet,not to replace,because nothing can replace your dog,but to take your attention,you will probably want to wait a little while though...|`|GTKXq7A1aa	Let the tears flow<br>  he/she loved you<br>  always remember that|`|BE0zSvlkaa	i would be soooooo freaking sad if my dog died... i seriously dont know what i would do without him.. he's the only one who's always there for me, not even my parents... but i guess i would get a new puppy and try to think of him as a baby again..and lie to myself that he is in doggy heaven and is happy|`|1oDI83e5aa	Oh I'm sorry, I just went though this a month ago.

However, I'm sure your dog was really good, and you are going to miss him. He's probably in "a better place" and is peaceful. If that doesn't make you feel better, you know the one thing that definatly will: Time. No one gets over a death right away, no matter how spiritual or optomistic they are; it's okay to mourn a little bit. After all, you probably aren't going to be chipper in a day.

uKW6HUSOaa	I say Pomeranians. My best friend has one, and he's just the cutest (and most spoiled!) dog ever.<br>  <br>  They're one of the few dogs, in my opinion, that stay adorable throughout their life. But, of course, there's nothing wrong with cute puppies growing into beautiful or handsome adults, like the GSD.|`|oYiAX12Xaa	Well, I have a Pom right now and I used to have a Schnauzer. Pom's are really cute and you'll definitely get a lot of compliments...but maybe it's just my Pom but all my friends (jokingly) call him Jac the ***** cause he's kinda mean. If he knows you he loves just laying with you and having you pet him. But if he doesn't know you he'll bark at you forever haha. He's cute though =P<br>  <br>  Schnauzers aren't as adorable as Poms but the Schnauzer I had was the most friendly dog ever. He loved everyone and everyone loved him.|`|jzASWplfaa	personally i dont like little dogs, although they are cute but i like schnauzers size better.|`|Uib2Lmywaa	I think Poms are cuter.

Single doves can be easily hand tamed.  A pair will not generally be as tame.    If your price range is $200 or less then a hand raised cockatiel plus cage and accessories is going to be out of your price range.<br>  <br>  As far as breeding they don't need a special light but the do need light.  Birds tell breeding season by the amount of daylight they get each day.  If they aren't getting daylight then they will not breed.|`|PmwX2VXOaa	the best gift you could get her AND thats affordable too, are a pair of love birds.(or 1) However if you get here a pair of any bird, chances are thay will want to be with them rather than her. cockatiels are more affectionate, but a love bird id a love bird, and they're affectionate if you only have oe and can get at very early age. aloha and have fun
3Hu1AFoEaa	Well, there is a deterrent at most Pet stores, I'm not entirely sure what it's called, but it's a green-apple like substance, and it works pretty well on my terrier-blue healer mix and my lab/boxer mix dogs.

n4pNNcGfaa	Dogs eat poop for a variety of reasons, including their own poop, poop from other dogs, and cat poop.<br>  <br>  For some dogs it's a bad habit learned from puppihood because they weren't kept in clean conditions.<br>  <br>  For some it's because of a nutritional deficiency perhaps caused by a poor diet, or by an illness like EPI.<br>  <br>  For some it's a survival instinct gone awry.  A mother dog has an instinct to eat the feces produced by her puppies in order to hide their scent from predators.<br>  <br>  And some dogs do it simply because they can and they like it.  Just as some dogs enjoy rolling on dead things.

Gerbils haven't been domesticated half as long as mice and rats. only within the past 50 yrs gerbils have been sold as pets because they are a desert rodent unlike mice and rats which have been sold as pets for hundreds of yrs. and keep in mind gerbils natural predators, hawks and other predatory birds. so reaching your hand in to grab one in their mind is a predator going after them which may lead them to bite. <br>  <br>  so just place your knuckles on the bedding with your palm up and just hang out for a while. let them come to you and investigate. and then add a treat. and in time they'll get use to you again. this has to be a daily practice though. and after they get use to you again you can't forget about them. you must give them attention every day.
gU34xa9vaa	Cats love to run and chase things, ours still play and they are 7 years old ! Get a long piece of string and tie a bit of scrunched up paper on the end and run with it, swing it, or pull it out under a mat,for your cat to pounce on, they love that game. Just don't leave the string lying around when you aren't there incase your cat chews it.You could roll a ball for him to chase and he might bat it back to you. One of ours likes to play 'boo' I hide behind a door and just pop my head out a little way and he runs shouting MEOW ...and then he hides and pops out at me. <br>  Your cat still isn't very old so I hope you have lots of fun with him.|`|ZgGe0bNZaa	get some cat toys from pound shop like some balls or some toys with cat nip in he will like that or just a ball of string let him jump up for it enjoy

Unfortunately, that's a cash cow for byb and puppy millers who are ruining both breeds with their idiotic, fake "teacup" "micro" and 'mini', just runts that are sickly and die young.<br>  <br>  Toy dogs are ideal for people who don't have the space or yard for big dogs, they are also a lot more portable and can be taken along when you go somewhere.<br>  Not everyone has space for big dogs, or the strength for them.<br>  <br>  Nothing wrong with liking Toy breeds, it's when they become microscopic fashion accessories because some airhead "famous" bimbos tote them around that it becomes pathetic.|`|Bw18seFqaa	small dogs are more desireable.. expecially among young girls/women.<br>  <br>  Chihuahuas surged in popularity recently because of the Chihuahua movie.<br>  <br>  Yorkies are one of the top registered breeds..   you see alot of people asking about breeding and buying because they are expensive tho.. people want to know where to get a cheap one, and breeders think they are going to make a lot of money selling them.  There's a reason why this breed is expensive tho.. they often need cecarians, and typically only have a few pups.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	Its not a growing phase. They have ALWAYS been popular. Its just that more people are making stupid choices and buying the crap bred ones that have all the problems. So you notice that most questions are about these dogs because they are the MOST poorly bred animals.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	These two breeds are considered 'fashionable' at the mo (which is NOT how people should consider a living animal).<br>  <br>  They are 'fashionable' because of Paris Hilton (my new British best friend crap) and Sharpey (who has a Yorkie) in HSM (high school musical).<br>  <br>  Not good really.  Paris Hilton is the reason there are millions of chihuahuas in shelters in America as people don't realise that they have to actually look after a dog and train it and that without training it will be a complete nightmare - people get bored very quickly.|`|8JPDOXagaa	I dont know really, it just seems that smaller dogs are "in fashion" at the moment.<br>  <br>  Many people want a smaller dog because its less to handle and probably easier to look after in the long run.<br>  <br>  Nothing beats the classic big dogs though, <br>  Paris Hilton pretty much set off the small dog phase with her little chihuahua - Tinkerbelle.<br>  <br>  No doubt big dogs will be back in soon :D|`|Nnm17zqxaa	I think that they are going up, because they do not have to eat and drink as much as bigger dogs. they are very playful and the yorkie thinks it is a German Schepord so it will bark at anything out of the ordinary. also they are just really cute, downside to them, Cha-Ching, expensive.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Yorkies in particular have been for years one of the most popular breeds and sadly one of the most popular with puppy mills !|`|HgMFrllLaa	Just ask yourself what kind of person would buy a dog at a "county flee market".

kWwgWSSgaa	The average weight for a male Dobermann is between 75 to 100 lbs, so at 125lb, you would have an exceptionally large example of the breed.<br>  <br>  My male Dobermann has primarily English lines & some Continental. He has the height of a Continental Dobermann {which tend to be taller, with a lighter build} & the build of an English Dobermann {which tend to have a larger build & not quite as tall.} At two years old, he's a tall & muscular 48 kilograms = 105 pounds.<br>  <br>  Some example of the breed can have a light build & be below the average for height & others taller & above the average for build & both can be perfectly healthy.<br>  <br>  At 3 months old in terms of exercise restrict it to 5 minutes for every month of his age, so around 15 minutes on lead exercise, with the rest of the time spent playing in the back yard. As he grows gradually increase the exercise, but as growing bones are soft & it may cause long term damage, no jogging/agility until he's at least 18 months old.<br>  <br>  Diet is very important, so feed a good quality large breed kibble like Solid Gold Wolfcub. Your young Dobermann will grow rapidly until he's around 12 months & then bulk up {put on muscle} until he's around 2.<br>  <br>  If you take care of your young Dobermanns health while he's young and in the rapid development stage of his growth, you will give him the best possible start in life.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your Dobermann.|`|SwIOyL0laa	All I can tell you is, don't let him jump a lot or do things like that which would stress his hips and knees, especially during his first 2 years.  And by the way, even if both parents' hips are clear, they can still pass on the genetic defect for hip dysplasia.  Best of luck to you.|`|26PPwzrWaa	130??<br>  <br>  That is way too much for a dobe. <br>  <br>  Why were the two parents even bred?<br>  He will be bigger, but not 130. I would state around 115 or a little more given he is male and the tend to be larger. <br>  <br>  The breeder you went to is not following code of ethics. I would report her/him for that breeding. Get your dobe fixed at 18 to 24 months when growth stops, do not let her breed your dog. The standard weight is 66 to 88lbs. Your dog is going to end up 30lbs min over that. There is no way your dogs breeder is improving the breed. <br>  <br>  Get your dobe health tested at two years if you can, thats when damage will really start to show. But no studding.|`|WIFKeDBgaa	Just keep him lean. No HARD exercise until he's well over  a year. <br>  <br>  On another note....yeah, sounds like you got scammed. NO LARGE BREED DOG has a larger standard in Europe. Dog sizes are not %ucked up until we here in the good old US of A get our hands on them. The FCI standards for size are the same as AKC and UKC...females slightly over 70 pounds, males up to 99 (preferred is 60-85 pounds for a doberman). The only dogs bred in Europe that are OVERSIZED or UNDERSIZED are by breeders specifically targetting the American, uneducated buyer. I've seen way too many brag about their 140 pound, "fresh from Germany" shepherd, doberman, rottweiler. And meanwhile, "Adolph" and his buddies are having a big belly laugh at the local tavern, because they've sold something that should've been neutered, as a $75-100K dog to some "Yank"!|`|3giaPYe8aa	Even a male that is a little over 100 lbs. is probably over the standard.  Let me guess, your $2600.00 Dobe came from House of Hoytt or Kimbertal Kennels, right?  You could have actually got a nice show Doberman for around $2000.00.  Nobody, charges that kind of money for a non standard Doberman, not even the idiots that breed the Albinos.  Don't believe everything you read in the ad section of Dog Fancy.  Any dog can get arthritis, whether it be from HOH, the big K, or Sherluck Kennels in Kent, Washington. (Which is very good breeder and Dobe judge)  Good luck with your big boy!<br>  <br>  Add: Europeon Dobes do NOT have a bigger standard.  I will suggest this to you....no "over the top" exercise, no jumping over 18 inches, and last but not least, NO puppy food.  Put him on a high quality, lower protein adult food. (Nothing over 24 %)<br>  <br>  Add #2:  I just went to this website.  Look at the standard that THEY say THEY breed to, and then look at the comparison to what your pups' Sire and Dam are.  Hmmmmm, it seems to me that THEY don't even follow the standard that is even printed on THEIR website.  Go figure.

AHEFXgE7aa	Actually, the green algae is good for the fry.  They can live on that when they are young.  I would not clean it out unless it is really bad and you can't stand the sight.  If you clean it, don't use any chemicals.  Just clean it like you would do a water change.  When the fry grow up and don't need the net, then you can do a good net cleaning.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|cyBYYFOuaa	i just buy some algae killar.. although some of my fry eats the algae..|`|8Qi79sPGaa	I generally consider the algae food for the fry.

hC4Z8HIbaa	That's because you shouldn't be feeding them seed mix. It promotes selective feeding, which is exactly what is going on with your rats. I used to feed a seed mix when I first got my rats, and always ended up throwing most of it away because they wouldn't touch a lot of it. Not to mention seed mixes are notoriously bad for rats. It doesn't provide the proper nutrition a rat needs, plus some of the things in the mix can actually be dangerous. For example, the dried corn can actually contain a fungus that if eaten too often can make the rats sick. You need to switch them to a "one type of food" food. This can either be a high quality dog food (not something like Iams or Beneful) or a high quality lab block. If you are close to a Petsmart, you can find Mazuri lab blocks there. It is one of the better lab blocks you can typically find in a pet store. If you don't, keep an eye out for Oxbow Regal Rat. This is the best rat food, nutrition-wise, available but some rats won't eat it. It all depends on your rats' taste buds. The website below sells quality rat food, including Oxbow and Native Earth. The Native Earth is the best value at less than $1/lb, but it comes in a 40lb bag. You would end up needing to freeze off the majority of the blocks so they don't go bad.<br>  <br>  If you can't find anything decent in the pet stores (hint: if the first ingredient in the lab block is corn, it isn't decent) and don't want to order food online, I suggest crusing the sale section of the website below. Rat rescues often sell rat food to help support the rescue. Or you could check out ebay. Some rescues that do not visit the website below use ebay to sell their rat food. Just do a search for 'Harland Tekland.'|`|qGy9fR7xaa	It's pretty hard to find a rat who doesn't do this!! All of my previous rats have done this, and so i try them with different foods, or mix it just to make it more interesting, i add these packets of dry fruit that they love, but not too much!<br>  Also, you can buy rat nuggets, which are bigger, more interesting but have all the vitamins and nutrients in it that they'd need at that they'd get from a normal rat muesli. I just add these nuggets into their food and they really like it, and even though they're missing out on eating all the seeds and nuts or what ever, they're still getting everything they need in the nuggets,<br>  Other people add dog food things and lab blocks for treats, which personally i haven't used a lot, but rats must like them.<br>  They're just fussy, there's nothing you can do, except adding more of a variety or finding the same sort of food, just with less seeds - I recently found a dry food mix which they love because it has lots of big chunks, and bits that they like most! :)|`|JmD0oq2Naa	i can only get my rats mixed rat food, but i have to pick out all the bits the like to eat|`|78293c9d9f988cff35175902f59e7a85aa	Most animals do this, my 2 new rats do that. I actually switched my rats from the mixed foot to a brand called Mazuri. It is a regular "block" that is actually the second best rats food in the nation. It has a higher protein value then the regualr pet store food. It took mine a few days to get used to it. They were on the mix and I just completely switched mine over to the blocks. Keep in mind that I still give mine seeds and corn, but it is only for treats (or when they are looking so darn cute). I also give mine fruits and vegetables. Rats are kind of like humans, they like to eat their favorite foods first and wait to see if you will give them more before they eat the rest.|`|BWez86Ldaa	Eh, they're just picky like any other animal, just think it's like a cat who will only eat a certain brand of cat food! Start researching some different rat food mixes, personally I use SueBee's mix (along side some senior dog food I finally found that they like just as much as the grain mix). The trick is to find things they like but also have plenty of nutritional value for them. This includes providing not only a grain mix plus lab blocks or dog food, but also fruits and vegetables! You put some yogurt on the lab blocks and I can almost guarantee they will them! Good luck!

Also your going to need someone who's an experienced rider to teach you, in the way of breeds anything thats placid and calm, cobs are usually ideal for beginners you find the larger built horses & ponies tend to be the most sutible for this type of riding, you'll needa horse which is classed as 100% bomb proof and doesn't spook at anything, e.g. traffic.

ZDjmDuuyaa	yes your completely correct they will soon change their mind's once they start to get fleas and parasites from the hogs something their notorious for. their was a real stupid craze of people buying donkeys because they thought it was trendy (Fools) now most animal sanctuary's around ireland and britain are overwhelmed with donkeys.|`|g13uCtPWaa	African Pygmy Hedgehogs especially can be very rewarding pets. I'm personally completely against someone trying to keep a native hedgehog indoors as a pet like a dog or cat.. but there are a lot of exotic hedgehogs, particularly from Africa, that make very rewarding pets. They're not too hard to look after if you know how, and I know a lot of people who say they get very tame. <br>  The one's for sale in PROPER exotic pet shops WILL stay "small and cuddly", ignoring the quills anyway. They're usually over ￡150 in the UK, which tends to put the idiots off. Also, they're not that readily available and you tend to find more being bred and then sold online than in shops.<br>  Also, I've found that most places selling these tend to provide quite strict care instructions, as I've enquired about them in the past. Successful breeders online rarely sell theirs until the prospective buyer can prove they've done their research. &If you search for "African Pygmy Hedgehog Caresheet" you'll find lots of information on how to care for them, it's readily available.<br>  You could say any non-domesticated pet is an irresponsible purchase.. boas, anacondas, species that need a license.. even big dogs that are considered "dangerous" by most people. It's each to their own and a lot of people find various animals very nice to keep and provide exactly the right care for them. Admittedly, there still will be the idiots, but there are idiots who get rottweilers for vain reasons, it's exactly the same.|`|m5URWlM7aa	Domesticated African Pygmy hedgehogs who have been raised in captivity are actually excellent pets. It's not any more cruel than keeping a dog or cat or even a hamster. If you trap a hedgehog in the wild to keep as a pet, that's a different story, but buying from breeders is perfectly fine as long as you know how to meet their needs and give them proper attention and care.|`|Ou2yNU05aa	It's all about the rural...we are the new organic (sadly).You just need to feed them dogfood and they'll come. Dpn't worry too much  you'll have to protest against the 4*4 hunters soon...|`|44kEtDvIaa	Hedgehogs have their place and some people want a pet, but can't have what we all consider as 'normal', so hedgies can fill that void.  They do stay small and cuddly and as long a owners are responsible and do some research before buying it's no worse than people buying dogs or cats.  In fact, more dogs and cats are abandoned and abused than Hedgehogs.|`|i5hio2Anaa	I think it's fine if the owners are taking proper care of them.
GSf09ALBaa	They are more peanut butter and sugar than chocolate.  If she doesn't show any signs of diarrhea, vomiting  etc.  she is fine.

Any significant changes, vet time.|`|Y6xanshEaa	....<br>  .....<br>  <br>  Chocolate?<br>  <br>  Get a vet,even if she seems okay,to make sure.<br>  Chocolate can be deadly for dogs.<br>  <br>  Keep an eye on her.<br>  <br>  However,she should be okay.|`|J6JFiNL8aa	no i owuld call your vet...chocoloate is a big no especially for smaller dogs|`|qZ0310yVaa	call the vet|`|taLD45Sqaa	Depends on weight and size, if she's not a teeny tiny dog she should be fine. Don't rush to the vet and waste  your money , just keep a close eye on her and use your judgment. Peanut butter cups are milk chocolate and are only coated so there's not much Theobromine in them, which is what hurts dogs. Dark chocolate contains more. My moms small/ medium mutt ate over a half of a chocolate cheesecake and didn't even puke!|`|W3dcQPvzaa	If it doesn't agree with her stomach she will be sick and/or have the runs. If that happens don't feed her for 12 hours but make sure she has fresh water to drink. Make sure she doesn't dehydrate !!! Keep a record of how much water she consumes - you may need to tell this to the vet.<br>  <br>  Dogs are sick but it is not as traumatic to them as it is to us so dont' worry too much about her. After 12 hours give her a handful or two of boiled chicken cut up into peanut sized (sorry) lumps. After 24 hours put her back onto her normal diet. <br>  <br>  WATCH out for dehydration.

Also peanut butter cups are milk chocolate so that is the safest of all chocolate if that helps.  My guess is it will be fine but you need to consult with your vet.  Some loose stool might be all you will have to worry about for now.  I had a 50 lb dog eat a whole large package of them one halloween.  We had no clue until the wrappers started coming out the other end a day later!  I never noticed the bag missing.|`|jtQ0pmEgaa	She should be fine. My dog once ate a whole bag of them as well as hot peppers.|`|noEeAkqzaa	yes my teacup yorkie ate a whole snickers bar the other day...the puppy will be fine|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	Chocolate is bad for your dog, and it can have a much worse affect on small dogs.  Call your vet right away.  If your vet isn't available, go to any animal clinic you can.|`|QnCR3cYiaa	peanut butter isn't dangerous to dogs at all. But chocolate can be fatal.<br>  a good idea would be to take her to the vet. That's what I'd do anyways. Since I dont know what time zone you in, I dont know if your local vet is closed, I would just keep an eye on her. Make sure she drinks lots of water, even if you need to put it down her throat, and eat lots of food, this is what can clear out her system quickly. She probably will throw up and/or have diarehha. If not, then get to your vet asap. She should have one of these movements in the next 4 hours. This may be a pain to clean up, but it's worth it bc you'll know your dog is getting it out of her system. But she should be okay.<br>  Best of luck to you<br>  ps. either way, make sure you take her the vet in the morning<br>  <br>  =D
Iyl5N9EKaa	Make sure your puppy is being let out enough to eliminate. If you can come home, that won't confuse him. He will eventually figure out the schedule. Whining is normal. I frozen kong filled with treats/peanutbutter/ cheese whiz works wonders. It distracts him. You just have to make sure his intake is being monitored and that he is being let out at proper times. She should be taken out before you leave. I made sure my dog did her business before I left. You can only crate your pup for 4 hours max. Even that is pushing it. Keep in mind, depending on his age, he will grow and learn to hold it better. He could still be learning at this stage.|`|0R0uRNuIaa	limate the space in his kenal (by using a blanket or something) so that he can only be able to lay down.

If its very young and sitting in a kennel all day while you are at school its going to continue to go in the crate.

0B4plcLEaa	Cockatiels are great community birds. So you shouldn't have any problems with putting two of the same sex together. A friend of mine and I breed several different species of birds. Cockatiels are the only ones we can have several pairs in huge cages together without the birds fighting. <br>  An ad that says they have a proven cockatiel pair means they have a male and female cockatiel that has laid eggs and raised babies. Proven means they have produced. Yes, boy and girl cockatiel will most likley mate if they are in a cage together.|`|YKrzEgyjaa	Two males won't mate and if they were raised together they won't fight too much but the odd scuffle will occur. A pair is a male and female combo but there are reported cases of homosexual bird, I heard of two Emperor Penguins in Auckland, New Zealand name Hulio and Rocky who the Zoo used as foster parents for chicks with negligent parents.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Do you mean are they meant to be in Male and Female pairs? No they don't they just prefer company no matter what sex

i5hio2Anaa	make sure you use the right kind of kitty litter, I would use some that is paper based, or like the pellets you put in a pellet stove.<br>  ferrets love to sleep on hammocks. don't use wood shavings for bedding.<br>  you're going to have to scoop its litter box every day, clean its cage once a week, and bathe it every other month to keep the musky smell down. Also you need to clip their nails and clean their ears every couple of weeks. wire floor in cages hurts their feet, cover it with something if it is wire.<br>  <br>  you may want to get ferretone, ferretvite, and laxatone.<br>  <br>  MAKE SURE you ferret proof your house, block off any small spaces where your ferret could get stuck, ie: from behind kitchen appliances, or washers/dryers. Also it is common for there to be a gap under kitchen cabinets that small animals can climb through, if you have that definately block it off.<br>  <br>  and DONT feed your ferret pork, fish, nuts, chocolate, salt, or dog food.<br>  <br>  oh, and I wouldnt use flash photography on any animals haha. i tried it once with my cat, and didn't get a very good reaction from him haha.|`|44kEtDvIaa	A lot of questions ... so check site below which will answer most and has other good links to ferrets sites.

Be prepared for the escapologists, thieving, and completely potty nut jobs, they are like kittens and puppies combined then given speed|`|OrvTG44laa	Ferrets are not cage dwellers.  They do need to have cages, for when they are sick, sleeping, over aggressive or if you can not watch them or if you have company over.  They also sleep about eighteen to twenty hours of the day.  Then they will need three to six hours out of the cage to play and excercise. <br>  <br>       A ferret will need a large cage.  They can not live in glass aquariums, as this provides poor ventilation.  Cages are usually in the hundreds, but can go up to the thousands.  They should have at a minimum five square feet and about two feet in height, though you should go bigger.  If you have a large dog cage lying around, that's perfect.  Large may do, depending on the brand, but extra large, giant or even colossal is preferred.  In the cage there must bed some form of bedding.  Some people use alfalfa.  The best kind is some old blankets and sweatshirts.  Ferrets love to curl up into something while they sleep and this is perfect for that.  Do not use pine and cedar as it is toxic.  You will also need a food dish, a water dish and a water bottle, toys, a hiding box, a liiter pan with litter(not clumping litter or clay litter, as these cause illnesses, and it must be very fine) which can be a shoebox and optionally a hammock.  You can also put tubes in there, as ferrets love these. <br>  <br>       Ferrets do not tolerate heat well.  Thier environment must be under 80 degress but above 55 degrees.  If it's not, they can die in half an hour.  They do need regular daylight, but do not leave the cage in the sun.  Because of thier temperature needs, it is best to keep them inside and not take them for walks.<br>  <br>       Ferrets are carnivorous.  In the wild, they eat small rodents and rabbits.  Many people say they can eat veggies, but that's not what thier bodies were made for.  Thier bodies were made for meat, and thier digestive system can't handle it.  It can end in health problems.  A good ferret diet contains about 30% protein based on meat and poultry and 18% animal fat.  There should be no more than 4% fiber and no more than 7% ash.  A good commercial ferret diet is Zupreem.  Dog food is not a good idea, as ferrets fed this will die of malnourishment.  Avoid diets consisting of corn or fish meal.  Regular meat alone is not enough as ferrets in the wild would eat the organs and the bones of an animal, not just the meat.  They will need fresh food and water daily.  The water should not be distilled.<br>  <br>       Ferrets require a lot of care.  Thier litter box must be cleaned out daily, and the pan must be replaced or cleaned weekly.  Every day, you must provide fresh water and food, and clean the bowls and bottles.  About every week or so, you must scrub down the entire cage, and change or wash the bedding.  The toys may not look dirty, but they should also be cleaned every week, or replaced.<br>  <br>       Ferrets have a lot of grooming needs.  In the Spring and Fall, they will shed, and you will need to brush them.  If you don't, they will go everywhere in the cage, and end up in the ferret's mouth, and result in a hairball, which they can't pass through as easily as cats.  They require bathing, but only do it twice a year.  Some ferrets hate water but others love it.  Hold the scruff of thier neck, and rinse them with warm water.  Than provide a shampoo made for ferrets or kittens onto thier back.  Lather them thoroughly , keeping clear away from thier eyes and ears.  Then rinse all of the soap residue out.  To dry, wrap them up in some soft towels and gently rub.  Afterwards, you can let them curl up into some towels to dry off more.  Ferrets need thier ears cleaned about every one to two weeks.  If the wax isn't cleaned out, they can easily get mites in thier ears.  You'll need to buy an ear cleaning resolution.  One made for kittens will do.  Put some onto a Q-tip and gently rub out all of the earwax and dirt.  Then softly dry out the resolution in thier ears.  They also need to have thier teeth brushed about twice a month, some times every week.  You'll need to buy a toothbrush made for kittens, as human toothbrushes are too rough.  You'll also need kitten toothpaste.  Rinse the brush, and put a little drop of toothpaste onto it.  Then massage thier teeth, and you're done.  Some will not like this, so reward them with treats at the end, and they'll get used to it.  Another grooming need is nail clipping, which needs to be done every two to four weeks.  Ferrets also may not like this, but giving them treats in the end will make it easier.  You can use a regular nail clipper for humans, but it must be very sharp, otherwise it won't cut the nail properly.  Cut a little before the red vein, which is also known as the quick.  If you're unsure, ask a vet or a local pet store to do it for you.  Pet store employees who are experienced will generally do it for free.<br>  <br>       Ferrets also must be neutured or spayed.  Male ferrets that aren't neutured may become very aggressive.  Females that aren't spayed will go into h|`|kjLHIJNRaa	In your litter box you may realize the pellets get EVERYWHERE and they get really annoying to clean, which is y I switched to news paper and I just throw it away when its soiled.<br>  <br>  For food get a healthy food (Innova Evo is probably the best, Wysong is good, and totally ferret isnt too bad) DONT get Marshals its actually bad for them.<br>  <br>  My 3 ferrets are on a raw natural diet becuase its healthier and reduces health issues that arise with feeding kibble, although I know some people dont like the idea of feeding raw meat to their ferrets but if your interested I am a mentor for switching ferrets to a raw diet. <br>  <br>  Dont wash them unless necessary, washing strips their natural oils in their skin and makes them more musky, if you need to wash use an oatmeal bath (I use Aveeno oatmeal packets) it washes them naturally and is good for their skin and doesnt dry it out.<br>  <br>  Ferret.com and Drs.fostersmith.com are good sites to get ferret items.<br>  <br>  Also about the pet carrier, if its not big enough to put a litter box, water and food in with the ferret then it wont work becuase a ferrets digestive system is very short and they usually go to the bathroom every 2-4 hours. They need acess to food and water AT ALL TIMES, they can get dehydrated very easily. If you can put him/her in a closed room or maybe block off a part of the room that would be better.<br>  <br>  They like treats, although dont buy Marshals treats I have actually had some health issues concerning them, the best treats for them are the dehydrated liver treats for dogs, and dehydrated chicken or duck or beef strips (also for dogs).The love "Uncle Jims Duk Soup" its a brown powder mix that mixes with water for a soup.<br>  <br>  If you can go buy a play pen tomorrow for him/her and you can keep that for a makeshift cage until you get one. My ferrets are free roaming so I dont even use a cage, though thats just me. They love cuddling in lots of blankets, they like going outside too so a leash is good to get as well!<br>  <br>  Good luck and they are such great companions!
frE1TKsIaa	Yes they do recognize people. But the good news is is the your g-mas voice hasn't changed..right? LOL Have her talk to your bird and give a favorite ttreat this may help.

CawAuKQuaa	Did anything happen before she started growling at him to set her off like that? If so, then whatever he did, it really got her mad and she's showing him that what he did was wrong and she's not gonna forgive him just yet or that unless he apologizes in cat language then she'll show him she likes him again, what I mean by that is not actually say sorry to the cat . . . that would be strange, he just needs to try to give her things she likes, treats if she has those, attenion, and if she hisses he should back off then come back later to show her he just wants to pet her and give her attention but that time approach her more catiously so he doesn't get bit. But if she just started hissing all of a sudden, well that wouldn't exactly make sense because that's just not normal to all of a sudden decide to hate someone for no reason. So that's why I'm guessing he did something, maybe something he's unaware of, or an accident. You should ask him.|`|Z4dSv7kBaa	female cats can get afraid of men. when my cat was younger she was terrified of my father for no reason but she was fine with me. and my male cat was fine with my dad. i also had a female dog like that...so don't worry just keep her calm shes not crazy.|`|LdJeb8VSaa	maybe your cat is scared of your father

There are enough kittens in rescues, y'know?|`|9g6QZ0Wkaa	take her to a vet. dont try to do any home made pregnancy test on her because you have no clue as to the difference between obesity and pregnancy :-P|`|CJ3cWXI8aa	yes i would say so, they will have all there weight underneath so u can see the ribs and spine more easily.
iW5cmYQPaa	There are a lot of products on the market for this, but they're expensive and I've had mixed results with all of them. Of the commercial products, I've had the best luck with Natures Miracle, which can be found at just about any pet supply store.<br>  I find the best product is actually pure white vinegar. Pour it on your carpet so that you thoroughly saturate the area. Be sure you use enough to reach the rug pad as well. Let stand for about an hour and blot with a clean white towel/cloth or paper towels. Let the area dry completely. Smell test. Repeat until smell is gone. <br>  Covering the smell with chemicals or perfumes will only fix the problem temporarily, and can cause the stain to set, which will make it impossible to remove the smell permanently. Even if you can no longer smell a covered up smell, your cat can, and will often be tempted to re-soil the area. <br>  If these accidents continue, you'll need to have her tested for a URI at your vet.|`|VMY7No0eaa	would you get rid of your children because they peed on the carpet?<br>  <br>  Use ALCOHOL... spray it on then blot off then spray on again.<br>  If it is in the pad then POUR it on./blot off.. (it's flamable so be careful)  and it's cheap.<br>  Then get a shampooer and shapoo the carpet.<br>  <br>  the shampooing will remove anything you missed.<br>  <br>  A slight UTI  is completely possible.... I would give her a cranberry pill.  It changes the PH of the urine... and will get the crystals to desolve.<br>  good luck|`|ixPskp3Oaa	Disinfect it and scrub it repeatedly. (Don't burn a whole in your carpet!)|`|d6e0568f5491523bbf5755cd68bc0b9aaa	the juice of a fresh lemmon will kill the smell of amonia ,,used in hot soppey water this will work for an extra help to kill the smell,,cut a fresh onion in half and leave in the same room,,good luck,,|`|9e27b32bc3fee1168b70cd3e85c70c90aa	we had this problem a couple of weeks ago, we sprayed febreeze a lot and have incense on most of the time and we used carpet cleaner...we cant smell it anymore, and no one has mentioned a nasty smell when they come round!|`|ZgGe0bNZaa	u dont really i would suggest getting lino flooring and mopping every day cat only pees on floor if its tray is dirty so make sure it is kept superclean u can get special cleaners at petsmart that r safe for cats good luck|`|UNFxjNHkaa	whatever you do, dont use anything that contains bleach.  Cats LOVE bleach and love to pee on ANYTHING that smells like bleach.|`|RMWeFoRAaa	I have had great success with a product called OUT.  I have found this  at Wal-Mart, grocery stores, Home Depot, etc etc etc.  It is necessary to saturate the entire area all the way through the pad.  If the area is close to a wall or a seam in the carpet, it might be easier to remove the pad, clean the carpet and put in a piece of new pad.  If you are able to pull the carpet back and remove the pad...check the flooring underneath.  Depending on the amount of moisture, it is possible the urine soaked into the wood as well.  Your cleaning could have also pushed it through to the underneath flooring.  If that has occurred the flooring will be stained and will of course have an oder.  If so, even if you get the carpet and pad clean you will have the smell and your cat may return to the area.   I purchased a can of wood sealer and painted that on the wood over the stained area and let it dry.  When the carpet was then cleaned with OUT and the pad replaced....NO more smell.  Cat was happy and so was the family.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Remember, a cat’s sense of smell is fourteen times stronger than that of a human. This is why it is so important for you to thoroughly clean the urine spots. Even if you can’t smell it, your cat probably still smells the urine in the carpet, and this can make them want to “re-mark” that spot over and over.<br>  <br>  To remove the smell of urine from just about anything, first clean it with some sort of soap or kitchen cleaner. Then clean it with lemon juice. If you don’t like the smell of lemon juice follow it up with a little bit of vanilla extract. One of the most effective formulas I’ve found for removing ANY odor was from Popular Science Magazine. Mix 1 quart of Hydrogen Peroxide, with 1/4 cup of Baking Soda, and one tablespoon of liquid dishwashing soap. Saturate the affected area, rinse thoroughly with clean water, and the smell is gone. This is non-toxic and safe for your animals and children, and those with allergies. This is especially helpful for removing skunk odor from your outdoor animals. As always, test a small portion of fabric for color fastness, before treating a large area. <br>  <br>  What Won’t Work… There are many home remedies for treating pet stains and odors, and let me stress that most of them are not too bad as far as removing odors for humans’ noses. Vinegar, ammonia, baking soda, laundry detergents, lemon juice, fabric softeners, and commercial strength pet stain removers are all great for removing the odors that humans can smell. However; you will need more to remove the odor for your cat’s nose. An enzymatic cleaner is the best answer, but it is slow and may take more than one application, (Nature’s Miracle is one of them). The Hydrogen Peroxide/Baking Soda combo is fast, but can alter the colors of some fabrics. In the end, you must decide which application is best for your situation. <br>  <br>  Even if you clean a pet stain with soap and water certain micro-organisms remain behind and your pet can smell them. Enzymatic Cleaners are designed to completely eliminate the source of the odor by using enzymes to eat away the micro-organisms that cause the odor. The one drawback to these cleaners is that they are slow; it could take several weeks for them to completely eliminate an odor. Enzymantic Cleaners are available at most pet stores, organic/natural/health food stores, and even some hardware stores. You can also ask your vet for suppliers.<br>  <br>  **Never steam clean a stain. That will only make the stain worse!**<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|E6obQSpraa	I have tried a vinegar and floor cleaner in boiling water then scrubbed the carpet.  It did work to an extent but i could still smell it slightly.  I dont know if this stains either as our carpet is quite dark, so would test it first if your carpet is light.  I think its a new carpet jobbie. Thats what we are doing anyway as its really difficult to eliminate.|`|BKrVqOgiaa	Hon, Aquella is correct: I've used the "Nature's Miracle" for cats (available at PetSmart) myself and it's like magic!   Just follow the instructions he posted.   You may wish to treat your carpet several times, a couple of weeks apart: if this stuff doesn't do it, nuthin' will!   :)|`|BY0cV4kRaa	You can buy a special spray for this  at Pets at home.|`|w2bHPA7raa	bicarbanate of soda works with a bit of scented oils in it|`|LbzQtQb9aa	air wick|`|Eu9A4auUaa	ooooh tuff stian but for odore if u wana by get PET ODORE AND STAIN REMOVER i think it cost 7.95 {in US}<br>  <br>  if u dont wana buy try putting backinpoder on it leave it on for a while then srube with water or viniger.|`|Qwvs90AZaa	Get rid of the carpet. Our cat pee'd on our sofa years ago and whatever we used, no matter how many times we washed it, the smell wldn't budge. Cats pee stinks and wont shift.
Drnpe4T5aa	You want to stop this behavior now.  The behavior will only worsen as she gets older.<br>  Every time you pull your hand away when she growls, she is getting what she wants (rewarded, in a sense).  This encourages her to do it again and again, and can escalate to real biting instead of just nipping.<br>  Get a nylon slip-collar - the ones that are similar to a choke collar, but have a built-in stop so that your can't hurt the dog by closing the collar too far.  <br>  Put the dog on a leash, with this collar.  Then, go to pet your dog.  If she nips at you, *keep your hand where it is* and with your other hand give a snap to the leach/collar and say "No" in a very firm voice.  (Think how you would talk to a 2-yr old that just smacked another child)  Then attempt to pet her again.  The trick is to snap the leash at the right time.  Too soon, and she will associate your petting her with discipline.  Too late and she will not "get" it.  But don't let her disuade you from petting her.  Don't even let her get away with snarling or baring teeth.  Any act of aggression needs to be stopped.  Remember to praise, praise, praise, when she doesn't snap as you pet her.  :)  If you are concerned about being truly bitten, you can also buy a muzzle for the training.  Do this several times in a row, several times a day.  You will have a dog that you can pet in no time.<br>  EDIT - I was also advised to try the "yelping" with our pup - all dogs are different, but our dog actually thought I was playing and just got more excited.  It actually made the biting worse, as he started jumping and biting as well.  Then I tried this collar and leash method and it stopped within a couple days. <br>  Also don't try to pet her to "soothe" her or calm her down when she is being aggressive.  To a dog, this is just like saying "good!"  You are giving her a positive reward, and teaching her that this behavior is not only acceptable or tolerated, it is good.|`|1XLZdOcQaa	Biting is actually a normal puppy behavior. This happens  because it's during  this stage that your pup is starting to grow his teeth. Because of this, your pup's gums start to feel very tender and so the urge to bite is at its peak.<br>  <br>  There are some ways to curb this behavior. Here's a link to help you out. good luck!<br>  <a href="http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/s0f.html" rel="nofollow">http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/s0f.html</a>|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	She is still very young and just play-biting (not aggression) but now is the time to stop that. When she bites, growl at her, harder until she stops. Then praise her and put some toy in her mouth.|`|eyZhiXYpaa	Puppies do this, it is called bite inhibition.<br>  <br>  Whenever she does it, yelp (as if wounded) or say NO and pull your hand away slowly.<br>  <br>  My pup is 10 months old and still doing this but we have tried different methods (as all dogs are different), the main thing is CONSISTENCY.<br>  <br>  We are now using this method and slowly getting there, make sure you ignore the pup for a moment after you have said NO.|`|IdSqunZuaa	She's still very young and this behavior is pretty normal.

YKrzEgyjaa	He younger than four months cause his forhead is still "Barred" (when the lines on his forehead are still dark and all the way down to his cere) I would say It's a male cause his cere has got a darker purple tinge than a female would have at that age|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Hard to say at this age, but it looks like the cere has more of a bluish tint...might be male. By the way, those pictures both look the same.|`|C8u2jBu7aa	appears male.|`|QXL1xOHRaa	It's still kind of hard to tell due to the fact it is such a young bird, but generally you can go off of the color of the bird's cere (the colored band at the top of the beak where the nostrils are). If I had to venture a guess, I would say it's a female because of the pinkish-tan color. Mature male parakeets usually have a purple or blue tint. Hope that helps a bit!|`|dXn8JaZjaa	the keet is too young to tell. as the stripes on his/her head disappear it will be easier to tell what color the cere (nose to you) will be. blue = boy, tan or white = girl.|`|DJa2wS86aa	from your pic id say a female,a male would have a blue chur|`|I0lVce4xaa	hmmm...i think its a male, the pictures r blury though...

l9Xg8Dv4aa	Alright, pick your dove up gently place it in your hand laying down, face up. Suppose that the chest and rib cage is just like yours. Place your finger in the middle of the sternum (middle of the chest) and work your way downward toward the  ovarun opening. Press gently because you are feeling for two pelvic bones that will remind you of a forked stick, or "wish bone" on a chicken. get a good feel of this pelvic bone. Now pick your other dove up and do the same thing. Do you feel the difference?  The female will always have a wider  "wishbone"than the male...this is because she is the egg layer, and needs this extra space. The difference is unmistakable. You need only a little practice to be able to determine with near 100 per cent accuracy...no difference in the two? Same sex.;)|`|Y5wBN2HRaa	Unfortunately this is a question for which no one is going to be able to give you a definite answer. Visual sexing of many birds is very nearly impossible. When it's Doves, there are sometimes certain behaviors that give pretty good hints as to which gender they are but it's never fool proof. It can also require that you have more than one in order to compare the behavior with another bird. As with parrots, there will only be two ways that you can ever know for sure. One will be if the bird ever lays an egg and the other would be a DNA test. Other than those two things, a "best guess" will be the only answer anyone is going to be able to provide. I am going to give you links to some more information about Doves and more indepth explanations about visual sexing and how difficult it can be. I hope this information will be informative for you.

7j4IJi1Qaa	This has nothing to do with mating.  It's showing dominance.  <br>  Example.  If you had another dog and she humped the dog.

tBJnxEjGaa	I don't think your doggy will die ! Usually they do this because they are lacking some type of nutrition in their body ! Crating the dog while you are gone might be a good idea until you can dog-proof your place ! Because you know dogs will be dogs ! Mine loves wood and cardboard toilet paper and paper towel holders and shred newspapers. Certain breeds are more prone than others to do this type of things ! But I have never had a dog die from any of it ! Now if it would cause your dog to get sick and vomit a lot - than I would be a bit concerned ! I am sure their stomachs digest things a lot better than us humans stomachs would. Good luck with your furry friend !|`|oK5kVlrnaa	Your dog shouldnt die from this, but do try your best to stop this horrid behavior. Scold her, with voice only, when you catch her doing this immetiently and give her a bone or toy that she can chew on. Also take her to the vet immetiently if she starts throwing up or is having diareah. Also if her walking is starting to get all wobbly take her to the vet right away!|`|fa94015ff5f0c6080fd3861b1e008e8caa	She should be fine but if she shows any stomach pain symptoms then take her to the vet right away. and for the eating everything whenever you see her doing it say very firmly NO then take it away and immediately give her one of her chew toys. No matter what age dogs should not be chewing or eating anything there not supposed to.|`|nkcCQMXnaa	well it may vary. but to my knowledge your dog wouldn't die because inside there stomach is this acidic acid that will break it down that's why it would kill the dog but if your dog eats something like poison or a poisonous substance it would . i will know cause i am  studying sciences.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	As long as he's going to the bathroom.  Eating, drinking.  ok.  And hasn't thrown up.  Then it's coming through!  But throws up shows any change in behavior.  Call your Vet.<br>  And part of having a dog is baby proofing your house.  So that then they can't get a hold of that stuff.|`|v2cdwakCaa	Its a dog, so they should be able to digest it way more easily than we would be able to.

If she is eating, drinking and not vomiting, she has probably broken it down somewhat and passed it through.  But if you notice that she is off, and having any signs of stomach upset, then I would be concerned.|`|I38WF5aFaa	Yes your dog is going to die.  Here is a little fact:  All living things die.  You,  me.  animals,  trees--get the idea.  I can't predict when or how your dog will die but I can guarantee it will happen.<br>  <br>  If your dog keeps eating things like you describe there is a good chance that there will be an intestinal blockage at some time.  Paper products will probably pass through without incident but fabric is more likely to get stuck.  If this happens it might pass with the help of a laxative but if that doesn't work the usual fix is expensive surgery.   Prevention is better than the cure.  Pick up things in the house so your dog can't reach them and her odds of dying of old age will increase.  Now that you know she will die,  isn't that how you want it to happen?|`|jzASWplfaa	no, she wont at all die...when you leave keep her in a crate to prevent her from eating the stuff.  Yes, it comes out in her stool, and you cant see it because it is all digested.  as long as she doesnt have diarrea or throwing up  she will be fine|`|ywl35HeEaa	I hate it when people go on yahoo to get good answers.

I don't suppose you had an x-ray done to see how many pups, so watch carefully.   If it looks as if she is still straining after she has pups, GET HER TO THE VET - any pups stuck will poison her and she will die a horrible death.<br>  <br>  Now for the lecture - how you can be cruel and dumb enough to breed a little dog like this without knowing what you are doing is beyond me, but it's done, so make sure she gets vet help if she has problems.<br>  <br>  You need to take her and the pups (if they live) to the vet soon afterwards in any case, to be checked out.<br>  <br>  You are irresponsible in the extreme - but that's done - so get your dog through this and get her vetted and spayed as soon as the pups are weaned.

The male could have been a 1 pound runt, but if he came from a line of 9 lbs dogs, that makes a huge difference, don't you think?  Also, you have to consider the pelvic structure of the female.  Regardless to how large she is, if she does not have a pelvic structure capable of safely carrying/delivering a litter, then she is at risk--that would have absolutely NOTHING to do with the size of the dog she was bred to.<br>  <br>  Please, for the love of all that is holy....if you have no clue what you are talking about, please refrain from advising others!|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Why didn't you research this BEFORE breeding your dog?<br>  <br>  Why are you asking a bunch of random strangers on the internet, instead of calling your VET?<br>  <br>  Please call your VET for advice.

Unless she mated with a larger breed dog, you may have to take her in for a c-section.  To give you a piece of mind, call the Vet and ask for instructions.  Really all they will tell you is monitor the time its takes for her to push a puppy out and also the time it takes for her to have another.  Also make an appt for a check up for her and then one for the puppies.  Get on the phone with your vet,  Good luck.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Wel whoopee do, you left it a bit late to find out what you *Should* do.<br>  This breed is reknowned for whelping difficulties and needing a c-section.  <br>  <br>  Is she pushing yet, how long has she been having contractions?  If more than an hour and nothing appears you need get to an emergency vet, UNLESS you have the help of a breed specialist standing by - but wait... if you did you would not be asking on here would you?<br>  <br>  If the puppies get stuck on delivery you will need to help deliver them - oh my - you may need to grasp them firmly and gently pull in a downward motion towards her tummy as she contracts. <br>  <br>  If she has been mated by a dog that is NOT a Yorkie, she is more likely to have birthing difficulties. <br>  <br>  I hope for her sake and puppies this goes well.<br>  <br>  ADDED:  well there you go, we have the usual "experts" who think they know about breeding Yorkies when they obviously do not.  I bred Yorkies (show quality and titled) for about 10 years.<br>  <br>  EXTRA:  Caninelover - AMEN !|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	why are people so concerned when a dog goes into labor??? if you didnt care that she got pregnant, you didnt care while she was pregnant and you dont care what happens during labor. Then just leave her alone. She may or may not have problems having the puppies. Depends on what you bred her with, her ability to give birth and how much care she received during the pregnancy. Dogs have puppies every single day with no help or problems, but if you love your dog and you are concerned she is having contractions then take her to a vet. Contractions are a NATURAL part of birth and labor. HELLO the pups wont come out without contractions. IF you dont know what you are doing, the best thing is to hang back and let her do it herself and stop bothering her. IF she doesnt produce pups in an hour or 2 then take her to the vet since they are stuck and there is something wrong with her.<br>  <br>  UMMMM... to those freaking out about bad advice. She didnt say, help the dog isnt having puppies, help her pelvis is too small, help I bred her to a large yorkie or a Great Dane. She is saying My yorkis is having pups and think shes contracting... what do  I do for her... well hate to break it to you but thats what pregnant dogs and all pregnant animals do!! they contract... if she was screaming that there were NO puppies coming i would advise her differently. My goodness. No need to go coo coo for CoCo puffs over contractions.|`|52162133e9e06553229902bb43a5182caa	You'd better call someone who knows who can give you detailed instructions.  Yorkies are famous for having tough births.  It's a shame you didn't do this research a week ago.  If you don't have a knowledgable friend who can help you, I would call the vet.  <br>  <br>  If nothing else, read this article so you know what to expect.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hilltopanimalhospital.com/whelping1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hilltopanimalhospital.com/whe...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck, you're going to need it.|`|sZoYD6Hfaa	I found a couple good links:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.essortment.com/all/dogsgivingbirt_pxf.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.essortment.com/all/dogsgiving...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2179237_assist-dog-giving-birth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2179237_assist-d...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_long_does_a_dog_last_giving_birth" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_long_does_...</a><br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|qapJU3tMaa	Why on earth are you having pups when you have NO clue what to do?  Why not call your breed mentor, you do have one, right?|`|8khZ0fJZaa	Wow... That's unfortunate.. Sorry kid..|`|AA11244754	then try doing what most people would...CALL THE VET!|`|K879Jev5aa	The best thing you can do for her at this point is....just watch her.  if whelping is new to you, don't attempt any heroics.  Usually bitches do quite well on their own...even first timers.  However, keep a close eye.  Don't interfere unless she is obviously having some difficulty...I'm assuming she was bred to another yorkie, in which case the pups should be tiny enough for her to birth.  Yorkie litters are usually very small , 2 or 3 pups.  Watch for signs of distress...i:e.  difficulty in passing a pup..she will be laboring and the pup is not presenting..If this continues for any length of time, it may be a breech or a stillborn pup.  waste no time...call your vet.  provide here with a clean comfortable space. There are some things you can do to help, but if this is new to you....don't interfere.  She'll know what to do.  You can however, take the puppies after she has 'cut the cord' and stimulate them by gently rubbing them with a soft clean towel.  While you are doing this she will be busy ingesting the afterbirth.  This is not a pleasant sight but it is something she needs to do.  The afterbirth contains nutrients that will help stimulate the milk flow.  When she is finished birthing that pup, put it on a teat.  It will begin nursing..amazing little creatures!  Then wait for the next one.  When you are quite sure she has whelped all the pups, take her and the pups, warmly wrapped in a box, to the vet.  He will give her a 'clean out' shot to be sure there is nothing left inside.  The first time can be quite a harrowing experience, but you will survive...Good luck...and God Bless..........
DtkLsetkaa	First off, never hit your dog.  It will only make him fearful of YOU, not what he did wrong.  Positive reinforcement is the best way to train an animal, it will help you 2 bond, and will build your trust.  When he starts to go, take him where you want him to potty (outside I am assuming) and then when he goes there, reward him with LOTS of praise!!!!   Praise is a puppy's best friend, but they also enjoy treats!!  Right after he eats, take him outside and wait.  He should be starting to have a schedule, and if not its time to build one.  Puppies around that age need to potty every 3-4 hours, so set your alarm clock.  You WILL be getting up in the middle of the night to train him correctly.  Just be diligent, set a routine, and praise praise praise!!  He will catch on eventually :)  Stay with him, it may only take 2-3 times of him succesfully going outside to get him used to the idea, but you may see problems still.  As long as he is starting to catch on, you are succeeding.  Be with him and be his partner through this, don't just dump him outside and hope he goes.|`|zeTGmB3faa	Probably feels abandoned when you leave him outside at this young age. He sees or hears you and the family in the house and just wants to come in. Take him out Every two hours. When he finishes his business, praise him. You may need to wait for him to go, but this is what you do when you get a puppy. Don't sluff off, be consistent, don't yell. He will learn.|`|WNhjMJ2laa	I have the same problem, I wish my puppy would figure out the wonders of a kitty litter box.<br>  <br>  Idk i'm a first time dog owner.|`|7feafcca345dc1ba46e01adef7b6e44faa	You must crate or "kennel" train your animal. There are a million websites devoted to that...but the idea is to keep the animal in a small cozy confined space when not being closely monitored. They really hate dirty "sleep" space.....so they will learn to hold it until let OUT of the crate. Make sure the dog is wearing a collar. You leash the animal before you let it out....and take it straight outside to pee or poo. Upon success...much praise or treats. Some people think this is cruel but ti is only temporary until they are trained....it is the most compassionate thing you can do for dog....train him to be a good pet, so he doesn't end up ast the shelter....which is where most dogs who aren't crate trained and housebroken generally end up. A litle whining now...for years of well-behaved friendship and loyalty.....Just like kids....the reward FAR outweighs the trouble.|`|LzXZQBHbaa	I kennel trained my dog. Every two hours I took him out to potty. And I feed twice a day and 15 minutes after I feed him, I take him out until he goes potty. Now that he's older he just sleeps in his kennel at night and plays in the back yard during the day. He only had one accident in the house during potty training and never had a accident in his kennel. Being consistent is the the key and having a good schedule. I also never feed my dog after 6pm. But he does get water until 8 pm then nothing after that.
SbLeCOjZaa	My dog had EXACTLY the same thing (but only one cyst) and the lab work was about $300. I did some research on my own and found it to be the going rate for lab work of that type. Pets are pricey!|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Hmmm, I'm trying to remember what I have been charged for this. I know I usually pay about $60 for each cytology so if you had 3, that's $180.....then you have the vet visit, I would pay $40 at my vet and I can't remember what the vet charges to do each aspirate. But $180 + $40 is only $220......so that leaves $130 extra. That seems a tad bit high compared to what I'd expect to pay but vet care may be higher in your area and it may have gone up since I've had this done on any of my dogs. If you are worried, call and ask for a breakdown of your charges and compare it with other vets in your area. If it is high, I don't think it's by much.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Doesn't sound out of line to me, especially if they sent the lab work out.|`|qapJU3tMaa	It's very reasonable.|`|0R0uRNuIaa	It's reasonable|`|cvNN6l9Daa	Approximately 30% of masses that look and feel like lipomas (fatty masses) are actually dangerous tumors.  Your vet was practicing exellent care by aspirating these masses.  Since each one had to be aspirated seperately and then read seperately, the lab charges for each of them.  The vet's cost is based on what the lab charges.  Since gas went up last year, most labs have increased lab costs of added fuel sur charges.  This Febuary, our lab increased costs by 20%.  What you paid is in line with what we would charge.  If the masses had been biopsied rather than just aspirated, you would have seen about $150 PER mass.|`|TInJIfKfaa	It sounds like alot for bloodwork. Did this vet not inform you of the cost of such testing? Especially since you took the dog for a checkup ( $40 tops), suggesting a course of action without letting you know up front that you would be charged an extra $300 for this is unacceptable. I definitely would have asked how much that would be before allowing them to do anything to my dogs.|`|jPwvxzUtaa	to be honest it doesn't matter how much it cost you probably now know that your dog has not got cancer, and you should not question how much you pay because a pet is not just a pet it's part of the family...<br>  <br>  i mean come on you wouldn't ask about the cost if it was a person in your family would you ?
OxFsslN8aa	A human needs to take the leadership role; that's the way it should be.  A good way to start would be to walk the two dogs side by side with a human (the leader) in between.  Have them meet off of either dogs property (neutral territory).
aYjF2SOKaa	If your gerbils are a fair age (9 months or so) and you're trying to add in 2 FEMALE babies, there is a chance they will be accepted, provided you don't try to just throw the babies in straight away, this often leads to your older gerbiles becoming far too dominant and the death of your new found friends.<br>  Most perople reccommend the split cage method, or if you have a spare cage, keep the babies in the spare one, and keep it close to the others, where they can be seen and smelled by your older gerbils. If they're close like that for a week or so, till they recognise each others' smells, etc, then you can try the first meeting in a neuteral place, somewhere neither pair of gerbils have been before. That way, there is no threat on either part, watch them closely, and gradually increase their time together in the neutral place. When they are happy to spend hours together in that place, clean the cage they're all going to be in, so there is no scent left, and let the 4 of them in together, but watch very closely.<br>  there is no guarantee this will work with all gerbils, as some just don't want to be with anyone else.<br>  Good luck, and remember, this will take time.|`|jpS9wgu8aa	It depends. get two more females to avoid prolific breeding. and keep a close eye on what goes on in their cage. and make sure the cage is large enough as well so they aren't on top of one another. But i think you should be fine assuming you handled and trained your first two therefore making them more tame and open to change.|`|bMnBDVQBaa	No.  Females are a bit harder to introduce than males.  Especially an established pair.  A group of 4 females will more than likely lead to a declan in the future.

hQQuqyYcaa	Great job on feeding frozen foods to the oscar. Besides live, these are usually the healthiest foods you can get. Stay away from feeder fish. Most feeders carry disease and can cause "hole in the head" disease in oscars (ulcers mainly around the head, but can spread to the rest of the body). If your oscar is large enough, you can also try cichlid pellets. They even make pellets specifically for oscars (by HBH I think). The pleco will benefit from slices of zucchini on a food clip (can be found at fish stores, or Petsmart if you have any near you). Some plecos like romaine lettuce, but not as much as zucchini.|`|KHY9X5usaa	feed the pleco to the oscar

By just spraying in the air around you when the dog approaches, he will get the scent and run away.  make sure the wind is blowing in his direction if you do this as his nose is sensitive enough to get the pepper and he'll turn tail.

The only thing I can see that would present an issue would be the slight acidic nature of it causing pH to swing, though the amount of semen in a typical ejaculation compared to the volume of a fishbowl is still fairly large (hundreds to one).<br>  <br>  That being said, I'd avoid letting ejaculate end up in your fishbowl if at all possible, just to be sure :)|`|0e51HkpHaa	thats sick|`|AHEFXgE7aa	Good one.|`|gPLrg6EKaa	everyone needs a protein shot now and then. it may even enhance there colours if  your lucky. lmao|`|cyBYYFOuaa	aww did u jack off in the fish bowel????<br>  nasty motha fuka jk wow thats funny|`|g1qoAtaRaa	Yea probably...what kinda sperm??|`|0jh9SnIEaa	well since your sn is vanessa, i'm assuming you are a girl.

TdrgZwnoaa	The mistake here was letting the dog into your bed in the first place.<br>  <br>   A 70 pound dog should sleep on the floor and in my house isn't even allowed into the sleeping area at night. My dog sleeps at the bottom of the stairs and keeps the cats downstairs at night too.<br>  <br>   My 70 pound black lab is allowed up on the laz-e-boy lounger with me on occasion but that is the only piece of furniture that he is allowed on.<br>  <br>   DO NOT ever let your dog growl at you. You are the Master. Next time she does this kick her out of bed.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	well with this behavior<br>  <br>  don't let her sleep with you<br>  <br>  she sees herself as your dominant.<br>  <br>  you need to fix that<br>  <br>  <br>  my girls sleep with me. but we've never had a dominance issue<br>  <br>  <br>  you *need* to fix that issue|`|vzBrloF2aa	Lock her out of your room or just keep booting her on the bed, she will learn eventually.|`|sHTpXUScaa	Whoa! I would kick her off the bed I don't care. The bed isn't her.|`|P7Tjixquaa	really?<br>  that happens with me too, but in my situation i'm the dog and shes you.|`|376Tj61Naa	thats why you buy your dog her OWN bed....BEFORE u adopt her|`|l2T4TrN6aa	This is a dominance situation. Your dog thinks she's the boss, and unless you kick her out of the bed she'll continue to think that she's ALLOWING you to sleep in her bed! ;)<br>  <br>  I wouldn't let her sleep in your bed until she realizes that you're the boss. Good luck!|`|TKMpkrvmaa	Im not a dog expert or anything but i would suggest make her so she doesnt get in the room. I would suggest you get your "Pups" her own bed that she will get used to. After ahwile, once she gets used to the new bed you will be able to open your doors again and she will be in her bed. It just takes time and patients.|`|CcESWX5vaa	lol sounds like my poms n their bed hogs they growl at you even if you move your feet mines even nipped my feet. theres really no way of breaking her  from that except put her a bed on the floor i have tried everything.i just  know where they are n watch where i move.|`|fa94015ff5f0c6080fd3861b1e008e8caa	try showing her that your the boss. show her that what you say goes and your not going to give in to anything she has to appose to. Like if you roll over and she growls just very firmly say NO! so it almost confuses her and shes like oh damn, she means business. :P|`|LFJj55jGaa	get her or make her some kind of bed and put her on the floor near your bed,give her her favorite blanket or toy to lay w/.Be patient an stern,every time she jumps on your bed at night,say No go in your own bed.Good luck.|`|bR4BgFLlaa	It is hers. Get out of her bed!|`|35rs9EFtaa	flick her nose when you shoo her off|`|piE8mQM3aa	Well as I told my sister Camille (who brought home her puppy pitbull and never trained her)... You never set any boundaries. Mia growls and barks at her. Camille "tries" to be alpha but I think Mia can sense that Camille lets her guard down. Mia puts her paws on the kitchen table because Camille thought it was "cute" as a very small puppy. I kept telling her to do something about it but noooooo, she wouldn't listen. Now it's not so cute. <br>  <br>  Your dog thinks she one of you, if not BETTER than you. Dogs look at people and other dogs in packs. If you are weak, she/he will want to be alpha. She will want to be better and higher than you. May be you bed today, your house tomorrow...<br>  <br>  Mia jumps on my 10 year old neice and Lexi puts her arms up. I tell Lexi, "you need to SHOW Mia who is boss. MAKE HER SUBMIT TO YOU." She's finally TRYING to make the dog back off but I think Mia can sense Lexi is "weaker" than her.<br>  <br>  Mia is a strange dog. Personally, I think my sister should have gotten rid of her right a way. I have an 11 year old, 120 pound rottweiler. When Mia was 2 months old she would stap up in Gingers face and ginger would growl and snap back. Mia would NOT back down (like a puppy should). That should tell you something. Since she has gotten a bit older, she HAS mellowed out a bit, but still...<br>  <br>  <br>  Just make sure YOU dominate your dog or else IT will dominate YOU. I'm an EXTREME animal lover and I tell you that with love for the pet.<br>  <br>  <br>  ***Annabell*** NEVER flick a dogs nose- read up on that, it's very painful for them. If you need to make them submit, take their face and press it to their chest. Or if they are small enough, lay them on their backs and hold them their.
qBmYawwraa	It sounds to me like your dog may have ruptured his cruciate ligament, this can only be repaired during surgery under a general anaesthetic, I know you don't want to visit your vet but your dog is in pain and he needs to be assessed. He will most likely need xrays but cruciate ligament ruptures can be felt by manipulating the knee (which your vet will do) If money is the problem, try going to a local animal shelter, or most vets offer interest free payments through GE money.<br>  <br>  Godd luck :)|`|rwdt9mNhaa	I'd call your local vet. A call won't cost you anything. Even if it's just a vet tech, they probably have some suggestions.<br>  Try making him as comfortable as possible and maybe by him some doggy diapers if he's unable to go outside and do his business. Also try to let him just relax and rest the muscles. It could be a back injury or he has bad hips. If you vet thinks it's bad hips, they have glycosamine for dogs that will help with the pain.
bjSEgjeRaa	This is a complex question with no simple answer. Deciding if a fish is asleep depends on many factors, one of which is the definition of sleep. <br>  <br>  In humans, the transition to sleep (or even closing the eyes) involves specified changes in the pattern of brain waves in the area of the brain called the neocortex. Fishes don't have the same degree of neocortical development as mammals and thus don't display these brain-wave patterns associated with sleep (view figure of a shark brain). So, as far as brain-wave patterns go, fishes don't sleep. <br>  <br>  If, however, you define sleep as a combination of a reduced metabolic rate, slowed physical activity, lowered response to stimuli and the assumption of a resting posture, then many fishes do sleep. Perhaps the best-known 'sleepers' are the parrotfishes (family Scaridae). Many parrotfishes find a suitable spot on the seafloor and secrete a mucus envelope in which they spend the night. <br>  <br>  Such fishes normally swim away from a diver by day, but can easily be approached and even gently handled at night. Many fishes, however, seem not to sleep. Pelagic (glossary) species such as tunas and some sharks never stop swimming. One theory suggests that during sleep, sensory information (predominantly visual) gathered during the day is processed to form memories. Fishes that swim constantly in blue oceanic waters receive little 'unusual' visual input and require less 'memory-processing time' and thus need no sleep. This is supported by studies on several species of blind fishes that live in caves. These sightless fishes do not sleep.|`|HqEbGN7taa	YES they do sleep.....they sleep just not when ur watching them...they need a time clock like everyone eles...in the morning turn the fish tank light on and they swiming around and at nite turn it off then they sleep not rite away.....in the middle of the nite just slowly go up to ur fish tank not too close and u will see that they are still that means there sleeping...<br>  <br>  besides if ur just watching at them waiting for them 2 go to sleep there not gonna....would u like someone watching u trying to go to sleep..no creepy|`|lFdWmDjGaa	yes they do you just cant tell becasue they dont have to close their eyes. They dont have to close them becasue they are in water and the water keeps thier eyes wet for them. If they are sleeping they will usually just be floating there are very still.|`|sNsdERusaa	Yes, but you usually can't tell ... they swim in their sleep!|`|IPihQEiWaa	no they just swim around the whole time|`|H06PtiIAaa	no, fish usually rest where they dont swim and hover, eyes enlarge, and breathe slowly.|`|Jkt3UkTBaa	They don't sleep, they can't close their eyes so it's hard to tell if they are sleeping or not.<br>  <br>  Fish rest, they will sit in a corner or a the bottom of the tank but they never sleep.<br>  <br>  My Oscar rests in his little hut I made.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!

aeonmRR2aa	Nitrosoma and Nitrobacter are thought to be mostly responsible for converting ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate in freshwater aquariums, both coldwater and tropical.  I'm not sure if this is true for saltwater.  These bacteria work at a variety of temperatures, and survive refrigeration (which allows the product 'bio spira' to be shipped refrigerated):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/BioSpira" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/BioSpira</a><br>  <br>  More informative:<br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Bacteria_bottles_do_they_work" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Bacteria_...</a><br>  <br>  At lower temperatures, the bacteria will simply work more slowly, a fundamental property of enzymes (based on observation, not theory).  However, there are many bacteria capable of processing ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate, so I'm sure there are temperatures, and pH levels, and chemical concentrations that will allow other strains to out-compete these.<br>  <br>  They should eventually be present in virtually any functioning freshwater aquarium, though, regardless of the temperature.  So any freshwater aquarium that can support fish, if it was cycled at temperature and pH (and etc) that could also support fish, will end up colonized with bacteria that can complete the nitrogen cycle.  Changing the parameters from before to after cycling will only change the max rate of nitrogen processing per bacterial cell.  If you cycled at some really weird temperature, pH, and water chemistry that allowed some other bacterial strain to dominate, when you adjust the conditions to be hospitable to fish, the mix will probably shift back to Nitrosoma and Nitrobacter - but in the meantime, the cycle would still be driven by the older bacteria that are being out-competed.<br>  <br>  That's my prediction, anyway.<br>  <br>  Remember that bacteria are extremely hardy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also - there are, of course, denitrifying anaerobes as well.  But in most freshwater tanks these are not fast enough to process nitrate into N2 at the generation rate.  I don't know the species (I assume it is a broad mix) but again, most common bacteria are common because they can live and reproduce in a wide range of temperatures and other conditions, and will still function way outside their ideal environment.|`|JbCVctm8aa	I have tanks cycling with clear ammonia, cold water with no heaters. When I need a filter I just  drain it, and put it into my tropical tank, which is heated. No problem, and no die back.<br>  <br>  Do I get the ten points?|`|WBopwqTGaa	since the same bacteria grows in cold a tropical fish tanks its safe to say that no it wont kill enough to put your fish in harms way.<br>  to ensure a high rate of survival for the bacteria turn up the temp slowly through out the day. and if your really paranoid about it just add in some easy balance for it and you'll still have the bacteria you need.<br>  they are not like fish they are an organism sub level of life with no nervous system, organs or skin which is why my bet is on no difference if the temp changes.<br>  hope this helps!|`|rDl9XR76aa	I doubt that there is a difference. I'm not an expert nor do I really know what I am talking about.<br>  <br>  But putting a heater in the tank and turning it on will in no way temperature shock your bacteria. It's the same as if you did it to your fishies. <br>  <br>  The heater being in the tank doesn't automatically switch your tank temperature from 65 degrees to 78 degrees. The heater takes a sec to warm up..then the water to circulate. so your entire tank to warm up to whatever set temp you have heater on is a gradual change..<br>  <br>  Fish would adapt to it, and I'm pretty sure the bacteria would also.|`|HABoqbYOaa	Well Good Bacteria is Live and what comes in Cycle, or start right, Live bacteria.<br>  Bad Bacteria is in Feces, Food not eaten, rotting plants.<br>  A gradual Temperature change will not harm anything..<br>  You need live fish though to establish your aqauriam.<br>  Just running filters your tank will never establish, until you add fish,<br>  ususally starters such as gold fish..<br>  <br>  Die off comes in, when you add " live rocks" that's usually in Salt water.|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	Tropical about 4 weeks<br>  If you have the filter media from an existing tank you can jump start it with that or a Small amount of ammonia

It is the owner who has to learn  how to ignore their manipulative behaviors.  <br>  <br>    Usually, when I am eating dinner at the table. I don't permit my dogs beg or stare at us while I'm eating. If they do, I would remove them and put in the crate until supper is finished. I don't use crate as a punishment; however, I use it as a place to keep them calm and mind their own business like put a Kong with peanut butter. I felt it is rude for dogs to stare and drool at guests or me. I don't think that is polite so I prefer to have guests make comments on how well-behave my dogs are. ;)<br>  <br>   I don't reward their behaviors until I have been done eating dinner and have some leftover.

Mostly what you have to look for are horses who are not paying attention to anything and look way too relaxed. Auctions are very stressful places for a horse to be at. If they aren't looking around I would be wary.|`|7PAGYzdhaa	a horse will actually look exhausted. Not i just ran 100 miles exhausted, but like, I just pulled an allnighter.

For they will not hesitate to sell you a sick horse.......|`|8bTder08aa	If the horse is being sold at public auction, ask the auction company what their policy is with regard to disclosure of medical treatments or drugs is.  Some auction sales have a policy requiring consignors to disclose drugs or medical treatments that have taken place within a specified period of time.<br>  <br>  If a horse interests you, ask the consignor point-blank about any drugs or treatments the horse has received.  Ask them if they will supply that information in writing.  If they refuse, walk away from the deal.  <br>  <br>  Ask the auction company if you can have a horse drug-tested at your expense after the fall of the hammer, and if the horse tests positive for drugs, can you rescind the sale.   <br>  <br>  Auction sales can be a real snake-pit for buyers who do not know what they are doing.  First thing is to thoroughly read the auctions "conditions of sale," usually printed in the front of the catalogue for the sale or available as a hand-out from the sales office.  Read this and learn it by heart, because if you successfully bid on a horse, the Conditions of Sale form a legally binding contract that you have agreed to comply with.  If you need to, get someone experienced in horse sales to explain to you exactly what the conditions mean.<br>  <br>  If the Conditions of Sale are silent on the subject of drugs or medical treatment and the consignor of the horse will not provide you with a written warranty specific for drugs that allows you to rescind the sale if the horse tests positive for drugs, then don't buy.  If you have any doubt about a horse's suitability for you, don't bid on the horse.<br>  <br>  In virtually every auction I've ever gone to, there are words in the catalogue or an announcement made by the auctioneer from the stand before starting the auction, to the effect that IF YOU AREN'T SURE YOU WANT THE HORSE, DON'T BID.  True and valuable words-- it's easy to get carried away at an auction and things happen very fast.  When in doubt, DON'T BID.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Horse auctions are the worst place to buy a horse.  The horse's eyes will be dilated slightly, they might be hanging their head down relaxed.  They will not be paying attention to anything going on around them.  If you are a beginner i would suggest that you buy a colt if you are going to an auction place.  A private seller would be the best bet if you are buying an older horse.  That way you can see it in it's setting, you can have the original owner ride it and show you how it is.  They can tell you all about the horse.  At auctions you have no clue what u are getting into unless it's a colt recently weaned.  At auctions a lot of people will say anything and do anything just to get rid of the horse.  Hope this helps.  Good Luck!|`|psNR7hDJaa	For a first horse, I don't suggest an auction. As you don't know what you will get as it goes by so fast. And also it could have health problems and things wrong. You also should test ride a horse before buying(some auctions don't let you but some do) and also its really good to get a vet check before buying but you can't really do that at an auction. Good luck...|`|mEKsbCw2aa	Ears don't move, even when there is a lot of noise.

e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	Your club hasn't been having quiz practice?<br>  <br>  If you can see the seed heads, timothy is easy to recognize because it has long, cylindrical seed heads (you can't really see the seeds, just a 2-inch long wider part at the end).

lpd6Zm1faa	I would say either would be okay with children if they are raised from a puppy with the children around. We have a male mastiff and he is great with kids. And trust me he is a big dog. We got him when he was 8 weeks old. If it is an adult dog ask the people you get him/her from and see what they say about his/her attitude towards children. Hope that helps you.|`|entB7tPQaa	A female is probably better because they are generally smaller. They will probably be cranky when 'that time' comes around, so I highly suggest having the dog spayed. <br>  <br>  Male or female, spaying and neutering definately effect the dog's attitude.

I am a breeder of 10+ years, and can honestly say that females are in general better dogs.  Either way, you MUST get the dog spayed/neutered!  If it's going to be with a young child, alltering the dog will make it less aggressive.  You could get away with not spaying a female, but it's a MUST for a male!  So my answer is......go with a female.  They're nurturing, more gentle, smarter, etc.|`|MIFb0sEuaa	why don't you do some research on the breed, so that you can judge for yourself, also to see if this breed is good around children better to be safe than sorry.|`|Rva0ocMOaa	I find male dogs to be much more affectionate, but that doesn't mean females can not be. It is more based on a dog's individual personality, rather than gender. Pick a puppy who is alert and friendly, you don't want to get a very shy pup because it may develop fear aggression around young children. Good luck!|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	Talk to breeders, not strangers on the internet.
7vJNHaskaa	No it's not common. I am one of those who do though :) my cat likes it in the warm weather.|`|QlzFoBS3aa	No, but I have seen it done on occasion.

We started them on the leashes very early and boy the love it now. I would not do it in the front yard because of the noises and dogs etc that can startle them.<br>  <br>  They have harnesses instead of the collars.|`|9825a4accf342d98abca06fdb35d659aaa	I've had cats that I leashed trained, but it's not like walking a dog. In my experience cats won't follow your lead on where to go. They walk where they want to go and expect you to follow. If you try it you should put the cat in a harness. It's too easy for a collar to slip over their head. It takes some time to train a cat to a leash. When you put the harness on your cat will likely fall to the ground and act like the weight of this thing on his shoulders is pinning him there. Let him wear it for a bit and he'll get used to it though and then you can add a leash. If it's a kitten he might take to the leash quickly but some adult cats are actually frightened to be taken out if they've been kept in all along. My cat prefers an enclosed privacy fence. He kind of freaks out if he can see what's going on outside the fence, but is totally happy inside it.|`|ZQJfkGwJaa	Well, I don't think it is common like walking a dog.

Safer.|`|LZWZXPOeaa	No, but it would be fun.<br>  <br>  I never do because it is extremely easy for a cat to slip out of a collar.  Any collar.  Especially a freaked out cat.

u3Hdoeiqaa	I am concerned that you say your dog has "seizures" when he gets overexcited  - like going out or seeing another dog. Does this mean he never gets walked or socialised?<br>  I'm not sure if you mean genuine medical seizures (collapsing, thrashing around, eyes rolling, screaming, wetting himself) or just having a paddy. When my dog was younger she got overexcited if she saw a bird or rabbit or something she wanted to chase - leaping around and making a kind of yowling, yapping noise. Its embarrasing but not exactly the end of the world.<br>  <br>  I would get him checked by a vet to determine if he is having actual seizures - and if so, why. This could be a serious medical problem. (My dog started having seizures due to cancer, followed by heart failue. Believe me - the sooner you get this checked out the better).<br>  <br>  You need to find a decent pet sitter - especially if your dog is likely to react badly to going elsewhere. (I prefer sitters to kennels anyway).<br>  <br>  You have nothing to worry about where his loyalty is concerned! He won't forget you, or stop loving you or anything.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

I've known of people starting with ONE female in their 10 gallon tank...female had babies...other fish did not eat the babies (amazing, actually), and they had to get more tanks just to house more of the babies.<br>  There are special containers to house the pregnant female, and allows the babies to fall through a slot to prevent the female from eating the babies. You can also keep the babies safe with plenty of floating plants. Willow moss works great for hiding babies. If you're wanting to save each baby, make sure you get a MUCH larger tank.|`|AHEFXgE7aa	You can put all the fish in together, and in a few days to a couple of weeks, you will have some little babies swimming around.  If you have enough decorations or plants, the babies can be safe, otherwise you will need to separate them into another tank or use a breeder net.  That's the easy part.  Once you get a ton of babies, you will need to keep your tank clean and probably will more tanks for them.  They can multiply like crazy.<br>  <br>  Cheers

I basically just put fresh tap water in a bowl, put fish conditioner in, and use that. Levels are important, but remember not to try too hard because you can make it worse. The levels dont look too bad though, they look fine to me. PH could possibly be slightly higher, but should be fine. The strips should also give the ideal range on the packeage. With danios, and my goldfish though, I just add the water as is (with neutralizer) and clean the tank regularly. I also keep an eye on levels, but dont go to crazy with it. These fish usually are ver hearty, and are not too difficult to care for. Make sure you have gravel, and a good filter. A powerhead is also helpful. If you have any other questions, usually local petstores do free water testing as well.

aeonmRR2aa	No!  The old carbon is still infested.  Throw away the old carbon, wash your hands well with soap, and sterilize the container it was in.<br>  <br>  Once you finish medicating fish successfully, you can do a major water change (such as 40% per day for 3 days, which removes 78.4% of the old water) or 50% for 2 days.  To get rid of the last bit of medication, after you are done changing water, add FRESH carbon.  Be sure when doing these water changes that the water is dechlorinated (obviously) and aged (let it sit for a few hours, ideally), and the temperature and pH match the tank (with 4-5 degrees, anyway), since 40% can cause problems if it differs much from the old water.  You can buy an 18-gallon rubbermaid-type container for $5-10 at places like Target that are perfect for letting water age (equalize temperature, oxygen, and CO2) before big water changes.<br>  <br>  Carbon loses its potency very fast - I've read that is is mostly exhausted within 2 days (but it depends on the tank conditions; it lasts longer in clean water).  You can leave carbon in as long as you want, but after a few days it will not act as a chemical filter, just a biological one.   However, since you are clearing medicine out of the tank, I would throw away the new carbon after a week instead of leaving it in.  You only really fresh need carbon in your tank to clear out medicines.  Be sure to soak it and rinse it (ideally in deionized water, but that's not necessary) before use; don't use until it no longer makes the rinsewater black.<br>  <br>  Please note that you can buy bulk carbon and a little drawstring bag to put it in (or use pantyhose and string).  This is much cheaper than the special carbon packets designed for a specific filter model, if it will fit in your filter (carbon must have flowing water).

I think checking out this site will help you deal with this kind of situation:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dogtime.com/grief.html" rel="nofollow">http://dogtime.com/grief.html</a><br>  <br>  Hope you will feel better soon.|`|KsjUQ2Vuaa	i knew just how you felt <br>  i live up in the mountains and my dog got lost and we went for a hike and we found her limping down all bitten and stuff and i fell to the ground crying <br>  we didnt want her to suffer so we put her to sleep <br>  it was one of the worst days of my life <br>  then we got a new dog but no one could replace my other dog <br>  so just say your last goodbyes and remind yourself that they would be happy in the kennel up in the sky|`|xfBbEgQWaa	She isn't dead yet!  Use this time to comfort her and say good bye. Enjoy the time you have left.|`|hZ6o8tyRaa	It's very hard to deal with the death of a pet.  There is no easy answer for this because any way you look at it, you will be sad and feel pain.  I have lost many pets in my life.  Each one was very special and when they died, I was very sad.  When your precious dog does die, you will be sad.  There is no way of getting around this.  You will mourn your loss.  You will be depressed for a time.  One day you will look back and remember your dog and smile.<br>  <br>  Try talking to friends that have pets.  It helps because they will know how you feel and talking to them will help.  <br>  <br>  Mourning the loss of an animal is sometimes harder than when a human dies because with animals, all they do is give you 100% love.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and I'm very sorry to hear about your sweet dog.|`|qMgVrmAKaa	I do agree with the answer above, get a second opinion from another vet. Besides that, to deal with the death of a loved pet can be rough and there is no "good way" to deal with it. For some it works great to get a new dog right away, others need years to get over the loss of the dog. What is important now is that you spend a lot of time with your dog, let her know that you love her, that you are by her side, as she was by yours all those years. If she dies, it will help you to know that you were there for her, that she felt loved and cared for. As painful as it might be at the moment, trust me, later on you will be glad you did. Above all, she does deserve to be close to those she loves so much. I do hope that she'll get some medicine that works better. <br>  All the best to you and your dog.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  You sound like a person that wants to do the right thing for your kitty, and are taking the time to ask for advice. For this I applaud you. <br>  <br>  Most of the folks who answer questions about declawing are passionate about not doing it. I will give you a bunch of reasons why it is not a good idea, but first, I just wanted you to understand that we who abhor the practice get very upset about this practice as it really is quite cruel, and has many implications for problems in cats after declawing them.<br>  <br>  I keep my two cat's nails quite short. I clip them every two weeks, and as a result I don't get scratched . Cats do knead when they are happy, and often extend their claws, and when they are too long it can be painful to the owner, so keeping them short really prevents this from happening. I love being "kneaded" ( sort of a pun on the word "needed", as really feel loved)<br>  <br>  Your outside kitty will do fine with shorter claws as long as they are not too short, in case she needs them for defense or for climbing quickly . As far as her "attacking your arm" when you were petting her, it is possible that she was overstimulated. That is rather common for cats who, when petted, have enough. But if you watch for signs of this about to happen, you can prevent it. If her ears twitch, or drop.. or her tail begins to twitch on the end.. that is a sign.. to stop petting her and put her on the floor.<br>  <br>  Here are several reasons not to declaw, in addition to the above.<br>  <br>  1. Declaw surgery recovery means excrutiating pain for a cat. While most vets tell clients that it is no "big deal" cats suffer needlessly. It is considered animal cruelty in 25 countries around the world, which is strong evidence that it is a barbaric practice. There is a town in California, which has also banned the practice. Maybe the rest of the USA will follow suit some day, when veterinarians really educate their clients with the truth about declaw surgery.<br>  <br>  2. Declawing frequently results in behavioral disturbances in cats. Often cats resort to biting, which is far more dangerous to humans than a scratch, once they realise they no longer have their claws for defense. Cats are smart and quickly learn.. <br>  <br>  3. Cats often will stop using their litter boxes as litter is very painful to their paws. Not only just after surgery, the paws can remain exquisitely sensitive to pain, and will often eliminate inappropriately. So if scratching furniture and carpets destructive behavior was a consideration for declawing to not get rid of the cat, the inappropriate elimination will certainly be a cause for surrender to shelter or abandonment.<br>  <br>  4. Cats often develop arthritis later on in life due to the disfigurement and misalignment of their toes.<br>  <br>  5. Cats need their claws in order to fully stretch out their bodies, which is essential to a cat's behavior. Toe amputation prevents the cat from fully utlizing their muscles.<br>  <br>  6. Cats need their claws for balance, and often to prevent serious falls from high places, as "altitude" is everything to a cat.<br>  <br>  7 Some people ask this question when there is illness or for the elderly cat owner to protect themselves..Even people with compromised immune systems and other physical conditions which make cat-keeping a bit more "risky" can find creative ways to live with their cats and not get scratched. That is why soft paws are so useful. If you use them for your kitty that goes outdoors, you will have to keep her indoors from now on, though.<br>  <br>  Ask your vet or vet tech to teach you how to clip her claws instead of declawing. Watch for signs of upset to prevent attacks. And please do try to understand how emotional this subject is for so many of us. Many vets suggest the surgery and don't take the time to thoroughly explain the procedure to their clients, so informed consent is not made, and many make a great living by doing it.. far more than teaching clients how to simply and painlessly trim their cat's claws.<br>  <br>  Take care, and I hope this helped.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Cat Writer's Association|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	it is never ok to declaw a cat. never. of course vets will say it is fine and dandy as they make money from doing the butchering. if there is a health reason that a person has that would mean death or severe illness or infection from a cat scratch then they should not get a cat. if a person is worried about a cat scratching their child then they should not get a cat. if a person is more worried about their furniture than the health of a cat then they should not get a cat. why would a person want to cause pain to an animal when all they have to do is not get a cat in the first place? it is never ok to declaw a cat. Why do people think it is ok?? I have been bitten by little dogs plenty of times but that doesn't mean that anyone ever rushed to have all of the dog's teeth pulled. Dogs also chew on everything and will "dig up" sofas and chairs but you never hear of anyone having a dog de-toothed or declawed.<br>  <br>  keep a squirt bottle on hand and when the cat gets rowdy (unprovoked rowdiness of course) then give her a squirt and say - aaatttt|`|4aAhEK9daa	My cats jump on my laps and tread, too, but I TRIM THEIR NAILS so even if their claws are out they don't hurt.  Did it ever occur to you to do that or since you were "so angry" you instead decided to have the first joint of every toe CHOPPED OFF?  It's REALLY not that hard to trim claws - might want to try learning before you mutilate another cat - <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a><br>  <br>  As for "when it's ok".  Declawing ISN'T declawing.  Cat claws are retractable so they have to DETOE the cat to remove the claws.  Take a saw and chop off the first joint of every one of YOUR fingers.  If you don't think it hurts very much and seems like a logical, kind thing to do to an animal, then by all means - have your cat declawed.  <br>  <br>  Shame on you.  May bad karma come back on you for mutiliating your cat - and for thinking about doing it to another cat.  You don't have to be an "animal rights" person to think that declawing is barbaric you simply have to be a person with a bit of compassion and a tad bit of common sense.|`|G032Flc3aa	Why ever would you take your first cats toes away just because he was loving you?  And now, even knowing about the pain it causes and how much evidence there is to prove that it is detrimental to the cats health mentally and physically you are considering putting another cat through it because your vet rrecommended it...huh!...I just bet he did, it's a nice little earner, plenty of big bucks for the vet, a conveniently modified cat for you and nothing but pain and disablement for the cat.  Some cat lover you turned out to be. Why the f*** did you get another cat if you can't cope with claws...answer because it's too damn easy to mutilate them<br>  <br>  And the idiot who says "haha no claws" ...you make me ill do you think it's funny a detoed cat still trying to claw? It makes me sad.|`|IuYekkPVaa	I'm glad you asked this question, rather than just making an appointment at the vets.  It shows that you do care for your cat and want to do what's right by her.<br>  <br>  Because cats are well known for hiding their pain, a sudden change of temperament is sometimes the first indication that they are not feeling well.  You say she doesn't normally scratch you, so perhaps she's experiencing some pain, or was just having an off day.  Rather than declawing her, it would be better to consider why she acted that way and how you can handle the situation in future.  This article explains the various causes for aggression and how you treat it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/aggression.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/aggres...</a><br>  <br>  Have you tried claw caps or trimming her claws?  I find the best time to do this is when my cats are sleepy.  Even if I only manage to trim a couple at a time, I eventually get all of them done over the course of a few days.  This link has really helpful advice on how to do that.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a><br>  <br>  Sadly many vets make declawing sound like it's the simple removal of the claws, they don't explain to clients that it's actually the amputation of the end of the cat's toes.  Since cats walk on their toes, you can imagine how painful this is for them.  Unlike human amputees, cats don't have the benefit of crutches or wheelchairs to help them get around whilst they recover, they have no option but to put their body weight on their stumps.  (As your cat is over-weight this will be agonising for her.)  There are so many negative after-effects associated with declawing, that it really isn't worth taking that gamble with your cat's health and happiness.<br>  <br>  According to figures from the HSUS, declawing has generated in excess of $3 billion of income for vets, so you can understand why some vets are quick to recommend it.  I would urge you to consider changing vets, to one who doesn't declaw. In my opinion, any vet who recommends or condones amputation as a solution to natural behaviour doesn't really have the welfare of the animal at heart. In an emergency situation I want the reassurance of knowing that my vet cares enough to do the best for my pets and not what's most beneficial to his bank account.|`|62565fcbe02eb11d89970b3b07df5120aa	I know you've read all the posts already and have seen others who have asked similar questions.<br>  <br>  I'm only going to add that some vets will simply sell you anything, to make money.<br>  <br>  And if folks really want a declawed cat, they can always adopt one that has already been declawed that someone doesn't want anymore. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there are always lots of those.|`|DVDYDaVSaa	IAs far as I'm concerned, it's only okay if the cat has a medical problem which declawing would help (which I'd guess is less than 1% of the time.) There are ways to deal with aggressive behavior (the Cornell Feline Health Center's website has a great brochure) and trimming the nails or using Soft Paws will greatly reduce any damage done by scratching.<br>  The next time I'm at work I'm going to photograph a cat's cage after a declaw, where they tore their bandages off because their feet hurt.  People can look at the blood splattered all over the floor, sides, and ceiling of the cage and decide if that's what they want for their cat, rather than using alternatives.<br>  <br>  Added:  Declawing a cat because s/he is scratching aggressively will simply make him or her bite instead.  What do you do then, remove all the teeth?  (Cats can still eat without teeth).  You need to address the cause of the behavior if you want to fix the problem.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Before you decide to have your cat declawed, there are many things you should know before you make your decision.  The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats that have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat that has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs its claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: <br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Any time she scratches or bites you, (whether she's playing or she's mad) say "OUCH!" really loud, then walk away from her. If you've ever heard a cat howl when you accidentally stepped on its tail, mimicking that noise will work well too. Walking away from her helps her understand that when she hurts you, that makes you not want to pet or play with her any more.|`|b9340e25c5c91b1731a01132aab4d92daa	I'm not a huge animal rights person. But I really don't think declawing is right--even on indoor cats. The main thing I've seen is that a cat without claws gets very aggressive with their teeth. I can keep my cats claws trimmed...I can't do much about his teeth. Declawing is a big deal for the cat. It's scary and very painful. <br>  <br>  To trim my cats claws, I wait until he's asleep in my lap and take the clippers to him. Of course he wakes up, but he's so relaxed he doesn't care and knows that I won't hurt him.|`|c4dny3nfaa	I think you know by now man that its never OK to declaw a cat. It wasn't your fault the first one was done, it was the fault of the vet who just wanted your money, no matter that the cat is now crippled. Once their toe ends and claws have gone, that's it, you can never get them put back.<br>  I'm looking at one of my beautiful cats as I type this, she's grooming herself,with the claws she was born with.I can't imagine how anyone can take them away man.

It's banned in 25 countries for good reason, it's animal abuse and has long reaching effects.Your already declawed cat might seem OK if he  was lucky enough to get over the pain and trauma of the procedure, but in the future he wil more than likely have arthritis in his back and/or his paws because of being forced to walk un-naturally for a cat.Cats need their claws for everything.It's no joke someone laughing about her declawed cat  still trying to scratch, that poor creature is suffering mentally right now.<br>  It's the most painful op a cat can endure, look at jujukittys answer, she's not kidding,she knows the truth, when the cat wakes up, its in agony, physically and mentally.Some throw themselves around the cage, some are so badly shocked they hunch in the corner,that's why vets keep them there a while,you can imagine if people saw how they suffer  they'd wonder why a person trained to help animals, mutilates them instead and puts them through this agony!  <br>  You feel bad about your first cat, but that wasn't your fault, the vet should have explained how drastic declawing is.Not many vets will do it now, the ones who do are purely money grabbers, don't let anyone like that near your cat please.You have the chance now to help stop this barbaric practice.You've lots of advice about scratching posts, clipping nails, and soft paws. <br>  I feel you do love your cats and won't do this terrible thing now you know the truth.|`|huEWXxmLaa	No its never OK, at any age or for any reason apart from benefit to the cat ...of which the only one is a medical reason.<br>  The smug person whose poor cats are just back from being mutilated has a shock in store when the poor things come out of being doped up, she didn't see them straight after the op .....wait until they realise they have had their toes amputated....the one laughing as her cat tries to scratch ...ha ha no claws ....what is it with these people ?<br>  The only vets to do this now are  in it for the money.I'd not take my cats to a person like that.<br>  Its banned in 25 countries as animal abuse and thats what it is.<br>  I hope you have success with scratching posts, clipping claws or soft paws, whatever you decide to try,rathe than put another cat through the worst that can happen to them.|`|wx1WVpP5aa	You already have some very good answers as to why declawing a cat is very cruel and other options you can use.What more can I add except its not animal rights stuff makes so many of us against declawing, its that we've done a lot of research and so many cats are already suffering, we try to stop any more having to do so too.<br>  Its supposed to be last resort yet some people get it done to tiny kittens, who might not ever have had scratching problems anyway, definately not if they had scratching posts from being small.That's bad enough, but to do it to older cats, like yours who has had claws for 3 years, the shock is dreadful, their whole personaily can change and shelters are full of these poor cats who will end up dead as not many people will take them on. <br>  jujukitty has told you what happerns at the vets, I know that's true, I've contact with several who work at vets surgeries...this is just one ...<br>  Today I was successful at talking another person into not declawing! I love when I can do that. I hate my job, my boss declaws, but at least I have the means to tell people about the horrors of it. I just told her to go to a few websites and really take a good look. Her poor kitty will bleed profusely, scream ( I am there when they wake up, it is horrible), the behavior problems, the pain, the refusal to walk, or ability not to walk right ever again. There is so much more.<br>  At least while I am stuck at this job for now, I can do my best to stop people from doing this, that is all that keeps me going sometimes. <br>  <br>  I hope this has helped and you've decided not to do this to your cat.|`|Su84Bsdnaa	NNNNOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's their only defense mechanism. It's like throwing you in a caged boxing match with your hands tied behind your back. If it's indoor, I guess its not really a big deal but I still wouldn't. But that's just my opinion.|`|0bYcYz2jaa	Take her to the vet.  Maybe she is sick or something.  Then again, she may just be afraid that she will be forced to undergo the same operation as your other cat.  Declawing is psychologically damaging to the cat and can result in increased aggression due to the fear of being unable to defend themselves.  Maybe she is acting out for her companion cat.  In fear that she will have the same done to her.  Look into alternatives to help calm her, maybe some catnip in your garden or extra toys and scratch pads.  Maybe she needs a kitty apt.  You know, one of those box-like things that are carpeted or upholstered and placed up high to give a feeling of security.  You can get or build indoor and outdoor cat apts.  Try other things before declawing.  I understand your position but please try other things first.
Rw7gi86Naa	While getting her nail trimmed at the vet or groomer is a great option, it would be less stressful on your cat, (and less of a hassle for you) if you learned how to do it. Cats hate going to the vet; I couldn't imagine going in every other week for a trim. <br>  <br>  It may seem difficult at first, but it gets much easier with practice. Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a> <br>  <br>  Any time she scratches or bites you, (whether she's playing or she's mad) say "OUCH!" really loud, then walk away from her. If you've ever heard a cat howl when you accidentally stepped on its tail, mimicking that noise will work well too. Walking away from her helps her understand that when she hurts you, that makes you not want to pet or play with her any more.|`|Ow2xyl9iaa	YES GROOMERS can clip her   that is why she is scratching you .  she  does not mean to do that......she also needs a  scratch pad or something that she can sharpen or grind her claws down......right now  they are to long and when that happens it can hurt their feet  walking   ..if all else fails they have what they call soft  paws.you can have put on her  but you have to keep replacing them about every 6 weeks and the nails will also have to be trimmed then also......i would just take her to groomers and let them trim her claws  once a month   and that will be   all she will need hopefully.|`|AA12168102	Your vet is a better place to have a kitty's nails clipped, veterinary technicians are trained in how to properly restrain a cat and trim the nails safely and humanely.  There is also the option of soft paws, nail covers that gently prevent your kitty from clawing you or the furniture.<br>  <a href="http://www.softpaws.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.softpaws.com/</a>|`|zv8QaMe1aa	I'm sad to read that you even consider declawing as an "option".... it shouldn't be, it's mutilation of the cat and they don't just remove their claws, they amputate their toes up to the first knuckle.... and that's what they normally walk on.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to information on the horrors of declawing.... and there is information on that site on how to clip claws properly and safely as well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.declawing.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.declawing.com</a>|`|62565fcbe02eb11d89970b3b07df5120aa	I agree with the towel idea. I tried using those fancy dog/cat clippers but I didn't have luck with that. I just use small nail clippers and make sure I only clip the very tip and NOT the vein. Once you start the clipping, the vein retracts a bit and you can go back and clip a little more.<br>  <br>  Those little nail caps have to be glued on and I would bet you anything my cat could bite them off. I don't like the idea of my cat eating those things.|`|srjPOxW7aa	Try : <a href="http://www.softpaws.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.softpaws.com/</a><br>  You can go to groomers to do it, but<br>   any pet smart has the kitty claw caps available.<br>  Yes there is a way to clip their claws but it must be done very carefully. I do mine, but I'm a pro.|`|ZQJfkGwJaa	Sure, the groomer will trim her nails. Try and watch how it is done. All cats don't like having their paws fussed with, but they get used to it. I am sure by watching the groomer a couple of times, you'll be able to do it yourself.|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	There are products out there called soft paws and regularly clipping the cats nails can be helpful as well(whether you take the cat to the vet or do it yourself). <br>  <a href="http://www.softpaws.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.softpaws.com/</a>|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	groomers will trim nails, but they prefer for the cat to half way trained to have feet messed with.|`|283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	yes you can take her to the groomers or the vet and get her nails trimmed. It is $15 at my vet to have them safely trim the nails on all four feet. My vet is one of the more higher priced in the area too so it cost less other places. Once the vet or groomers do it a few times then the cat gets used to it and then you can do it at home. I have had to do it that way for 2 of mine. They were just terrible about having their feet touched but now they are used to it so whenever they are sitting on my lap and their nails are a little long I just give them a quick clip. I give them a kitty treat after-wards, they seem to understand that the yummies come right after they get their nails clipped.|`|FC34jxiaaa	Yes, you can. But while I'm happy that you've decided against declawing, I recommend that you trim the cat's nails yourself. Taking a cat to a groomer for nail trimming just isn't very practical. Paying a groomer to apply Soft Claws is even more impractical -- the nail caps will (obviously) not fall off at the same interval. And when a cap falls off (from nail sheath shedding), the cap will be replaced by a very sharp claw.<br>  <br>  The "wrap the cat in a towel" method that is often recommended was a complete disaster for me. What has worked well for me is placing the cat on the ground and straddling it. The other method that I would recommend is waiting until the cat is very tired or sleeping before attempting to trim the nails. Don't worry about getting every nail on your first effort -- just try to get one at a time. Hopefully, your cat will gradually become more comfortable with you handling its paws. And you might want to consider handling your cat's paw when you aren't attempting to clip her nails. I started petting my cat's paws a bit when she slept on my lap, and that seemed to make her more comfortable with me handling them.|`|c55O7jqXaa	They do have nail caps. They can also apply these at the vet, but I suggest if you just can't deal with it and hold her down to clip her nails then declawing fronts only will be a good idea. If she is outdoors at all she needs those back claws for defense or else she won't make it.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	If you want to trim her claws, you'll just have to do it.  Wrap a towel around her and trim them with the clippers that you can buy at your local pet store.  You may need "your man" to assist you.  If you aren't comfortable doing it, yes, most groomers will do it for you.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	A groomer or a vet may be able to do it for you if you can't manage it yourself.  Sometimes the pros can handle a tough cat better or can give you tips so you can do it yourself.  If I bribe my cat with treats, he'll let me trim his nails.

You just need to make sure not to ask too much too soon of an out of shape horse.|`|Ln6GHksraa	yes. just wait to ride but the days you go to the barn you should do something with your horse. I have the same problem. So on the days I go down I walk my horse on a little walk, or I brush him. It just helps him stay a little more content. I also some times just walk on him bareback. So hope this helped!|`|gdH0Xmfjaa	If you barn doesn't have an indoor there is not much you can do - unless you looked into moving barns for the winter...a barn w/ an indoor; i know a lot of people who do that.

9gMQAWBNaa	You are right that an operation on a female dog is a little barbaric, its much like a hysterectomy in a woman where they remove all the reproductive organs.<br>  <br>  Your dog will change in character a little over time, if anything she will stay closer to home and be a little more affectionate than she already is.  <br>  <br>  When a female dog is spayed, she is very likely not to get a sort of breast cancer that many unspayed female dogs get.<br>   It sometimes takes more than a week for a dog to feel better after a surgery like that.

It's also unpleasant for a dog to go through pregnancy and birthing (accidents do happen) especially if the dog is bigger than the b*tch.<br>  <br>  It's not barbaric - it's necessary. I think it's more barbaric that MILLIONS of dogs have to be killed every year because idiots won't neuter their pets.<br>  <br>  I had my girlie spayed and she was back to normal within two days. She now has barely a scar and I'm sure is happier for not having had to go through a season since.|`|DVDYDaVSaa	It's more cruel and unnecessary to increase her risk for mammary cancer and life-threatening uterine infections by leaving her intact.  It's not going to drastically change her personality, and she'll be a healthier dog for it.<br>  Hopefully they gave you pain medication to go home, as it is an abdominal surgery and will hurt for a while.  If she's not acting normal (eating, drinking, urinating and defecating, and back to normal activity) in a day or so, let your vet's office know.|`|0dda4d5d5420e22adc401448a90f4f83aa	Barbaric? I'm sorry but would you rather your female get something like Pyometra (infected uterus) and die later on in life?<br>  Spaying and neutering keeps dogs healthy and is in no way mutilation.<br>  If your female got injured and needed life saving surgery would you deny that?<br>  What a sensible mother you have.|`|bx7qmKbGaa	Wow. Spaying is hardly "barbaric". It keeps dogs from getting pregnant or some cancers. You should be on your knees thanking your mother!

When a female dog goes into heat, she will menstruate. Caring for a menstruating dog can be messy and inconvenient. Spaying a dog eliminates the dog's periods by lowering the hormone levels that trigger menstruation in dogs. <br>  A spayed dog will not go into heat. A dog in heat can exhibit an array of undesirable behaviors. A dog in heat will often "call" and vocalize as a way to signal potential mates. A female dog in heat will also be more prone to wandering or running away when she's in heat and she may return pregnant, which brings with it a whole host of health concerns. A female dog in heat will also be attractive to male dogs, who will detect her elevated hormone levels from quite a distance; it's not uncommon to see male dogs hanging around the home of a dog in heat. <br>  A spayed dog cannot get pregnant. It's an obvious benefit, but a significant one. Terminating an unwanted dog pregnancy can be expensive and risky. A pregnant dog can be difficult to care for and once the puppies are born, they will require at least eight weeks of intensive care. Proper veterinary care for a pregnant dog can also be very expensive, particularly if complications arise. In some cases, a female dog may die during pregnancy or during the whelping process. Anyone considering breeding a dog should remember this rule of thumb: Don't breed a dog unless you're prepared for the possibility of losing her. <br>  Spaying a dog makes her less attractive to pet thieves. Unfortunately, there are many cases when an intact dog will be stolen from a yard or kennel and used for breeding. Clearly, it's easier to determine whether a male dog is intact, but many dogs are also stolen from kennels and boarding facilities, where a quick look at the dog's file will reveal if she is spayed. A spayed dog is useless to a dog thief who is seeking a "breeder." <br>  A spayed dog is a healthier dog. Higher hormone levels are associated with a higher risk of developing cancer and other diseases. Spaying or neutering a dog lowers hormone levels, thereby reducing the dog's health risks.<br>  <br>  now for the "benefits" of leaving her la-natural...<br>  The Advantages of Leaving a Female Dog Intact and Unspayed<br>  There are two basic reasons why a dog owner may decide to leave a female dog intact, opting not to spay the dog.<br>  <br>  A spayed female d|`|KgdEsXcGaa	She is probably in pain from the stitches. When my dog was spayed, all she wanted to do was lay outside in the snow. I guess it helped with the pain. She might also be depressed because of the big cone that should be over her head to keep her from tearing open the stitches. My dog hated that. She could barely walk with it on! Don't worry, she should be back to normal in no time. I haven't noticed any changes in my dog, but a spayed dog WILL behave better then an unspayed dog. You can keep your dog inside all you want, but all it takes is 5 minutes in the back yard and a female dog in heat to make puppies. If she's in heat, she WILL find a way to get out of the house/yard and mate. Even if you never leave her outside by herself, what are you going to do if she jumps the fence? Chase after her? I don't think so! She's probably ten times faster then you, after all, we only have two legs. ;)|`|tjLbXhtEaa	okay your dog may change and be a little less hyper. <br>  But to think that this is a mutilation, then you need to get some education on the number of dogs that are abandoned every year and then put to death because nobody wants them. You can say your little dog will never become pregnant but what if it does. Always is a pretty strong word for someone who still lives at home. You aren't there 24/7 your parents might leave and the dog slips out unnoticed.     <br>  Good luck but you little dog will be healthier and live  a happier life.|`|v0RsFaAzaa	You should Thank  your mother for having her Spayed. That's the most loving thing she could have done for her. I have 9 female Chihuahuas, who are All Spayed and I never had any problems with them changing. They are just the same as they were before they were Spayed! The only change is that now they are not as prone to certain diseases and they can no longer become pregnant! Your dog will be fine, trust me and will be back to her normal self in no time. Just give her a little time to recover!|`|CcESWX5vaa	spaying  is ok but if you dont watch your dogs diet she will get overweight it calms them down their not as active.my neighbor had her pom spaded n now shes lazy  shes only 8 months old.|`|fa94015ff5f0c6080fd3861b1e008e8caa	Shes not going to change....|`|2RHGigcyaa	yes it only makes it so it cant have kids|`|3g9HQAw2aa	I am sure your dog will be perfectly fine. I have had several females spayed and they didn't change at all. They were playful and happy. We didn't have to worry about mammary cancer, uterine cancer, or hormone changes. Since she is a young dog, she will recover quickly and you will find that she is the same pup you have grown to love. I commend you for doing this even though you were unsure of it. You really do a great service for your pooch. My girls were up and around within a day or 2. I had to keep them away from the other dogs because they wanted to get back to their business of playing and running. Give her about 10 days before you let her get too excited about playing. Gradually get her back into a routine of walking and exercise. Enjoy the long life ahead of her and all the good times you will have with her.|`|fTMQOmhsaa	Are you serious?  Cruel and unnecessary????  What is cruel and unnecessary is the number of dogs that are put to sleep every year because humans don't have the heart and common sense to get their dogs "fixed"!  Even if you think your dog is an "inside" dog there is always the possibility that she will get out of the house or yard and get knocked up.  YOUR DOG WILL BE FINE!!!  <br>  It makes me so made when people think that fixing your dog is cruel!  I especially hate it when male dog owners think it is curel to fix their male dogs!  I hate hearing the excuse that they wouldn't like it if someone cut off their dogs!  IT IS A DOG!!!  Believe me, I love my dog like she is a child but I am very happy that she was fixed when we adopted her!  The last thing the world needs is more unwanted pets!|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Barbaric? Would you rather her die of a slow and painful death because she got pyometra and you didn't want to do the surgery because, in turn, she would still get spayed (only after experiencing great pain)? Or would you rather her die of cancer? Maybe even get loose (because dogs do have a mind of their own) and have a run in with a large male? Because of the large male, she will likely have really large puppies that can only be born through C-section after the pain of having one stuck in the birth canal.<br>  <br>  You should thank your mother (especially if she paid for it) for caring enough about your dog and getting her spayed to prevent further health problems. The dog will eventually return to her rightful self. If the vet provided pain meds (and you're giving the pills to her), she wouldn't know what happened.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	You are EXTREMELY misinformed.

That's been quite a few trips in and some phone calls and ... not only has MY vet been great, but the rest of the vets on the team have been great too.

He's outgoing, friendly and loves our dogs and they love him. He's very informative but open minded and we enjoy being able to voice questions or concerns and get an honest opinion and helpful suggestions w/out being "lectured" like some vets will do. <br>  I don't know the techs that well since they only time i see them is when they assist our vet for a second, then they go back in the back again. they have a reception staff as well that i'm more familiar with and love to pieces. all those ladies are just super sweet.<br>  <br>  Our vet shares his practice w/another vet and she's not friendly or open minded. she's very short in any answer to a question i have, and usually looks at me like i'm stupid or something. i guess she's not a people person, which i suppose is not that big of a deal considering her profession...but still. I try to not schedule appointments with her at all if i can help it (unless it's an emergency or an illness that needs attending to ASAP).<br>  <br>  My foster dogs go to another vet that the SPCA works with. We've worked w/him for almost 7 years. he's a friendly knowledgable man, but very quiet. I'm limited in the decision making for those dogs due to their foster status but i know their vet well enough that i think he's a great vet.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I have a wonderful relationship with my vet and the techs. I have been using the same vet for over 10 years and have been thru a lot with them. I even attend a c-section on occasion. I can call my vet any time, day or night for advice or if I have an emergency. I trust my vet explicitly with my dogs.<br>  <br>  My vet loves me too as I am one of their most frequent visitors with my animals. We helped him build a new vet clinic last year....lol We use his services probably an average of once a week. He even comes out to our house to give our dogs their shots. We do rescue to and he always gives us a cut rate for any work done on them.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Yes our vet is excellent, he is a bulldog specialist. But he does not just do bulldogs. I trust him because he is the best one around. There is another vet, a country vet that we also go to who is great. We mainly take them their for shots and other simple stuff, but the bulldog specialist, sees our bulldogs mainly. Its always handy to have more then 1 vet on hand. We are very close with both vets. We can ask either one questions and will get good responses, the bulldog specialist doesnt talk much but that doesnt bother me because he does so well with them. He does the c-sections, he can whip them out fast, and with most of the time no complications. <br>  <br>  Im not always at the vet which is a good thing lol, but we go when ever they have problems, unless its something that can be treated at home.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Oh, I have had the same Vet for over 25 years.  I have his cell number, his home number and his wife's cell number.  <br>  <br>  He has come to my home to give Lepto shots because I have 9 dogs and it is easier for me.<br>  <br>  He gives me a tremendous discount because of all the dogs I have.  <br>  Allows me to make payments when I have to.<br>  <br>  His staff is awesome.  His vet techs are great and I have full run of the clinic any time I walk in,<br>  <br>  I love this man very much.  He helps ME keep my dogs healthy.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I love everyone in the office. I have all 3 vets cell phone numbers. <br>  They know my dogs without having to read a chart, and I do trust their opinions. One even raises and shows Rotties which is a plus in my book.<br>  The entire office gets homemade bread for Christmas. The only time I cook all year long<g><br>  <br>  They also give the the zoo discount which helps with my critters|`|pc7ZjexJaa	we have switched vets quite a few times<br>  <br>  sucks how you can have *so* many shitty vets in 1 area? from different clinics<br>  that talk down on each others practices<br>  <br>  <br>  we have finally found one that my aunt recommended (if she lived here...SHE would be our vet) <br>  and we are starting to trust him<br>  my dane sure is popular there.|`|UETAqR8Taa	I have an excellent relationship with my vet. If I need him for anything urgent, I can call him 24/7. He even comes to the house if at night.
cIx96qbyaa	I would start out with a couple of damsel fish.  If you are worried it hasn't cycled long enough they can speed up the process.  They come in lots of colors and like to school together.  I have 2 30 gallon tanks with 4 damsels in each.  Also there is a product called cycle, you can buy it at almost any pet store.  It has bacteria in it that help your tank to cycle quicker. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|HABoqbYOaa	If you're going to add a Tang, be sure you add it last..<br>  <br>  we have a 50 gal. and added we started with 5 fish, <br>  established same as yours..2 clowns, lawn mower algae eater, puffer reef safe, and peaceful dragon wrasse..none died<br>  <br>  enjoy your tank..
meMF69tXaa	Yes, yes, yes. Before we had our oldest rabbit spayed, she would do this to our guest in our home. LOL! <br>  <br>  To properly get the sex of your bunny, you need to support his/her hind legs and back, gently turn the rabbit over on it's back and press right above the genital area. You will be able to tell if it is a buck or a doe by doing this. That is, if he/she is old enough to tell.<br>  <br>  Mounting behavior happens with males and females. It's not just limited to one.|`|HrdGdiE0aa	My girl bunny did, but i wouldn't believe what the people<br>  at the pet store told you either because some people<br>  told my cousin she bought to girl hampsters got them<br>  and i looked at them both and told them they're was a <br>  boy and girl no one believed me and be hold baby hampsters<br>  a few weeks later. lol, when you take her or him to the <br>  vet they will be able to tell you or you can check yourself<br>  its really not that hard.|`|PMTb9HpXaa	i think that if u just wait a while until she gets older or if  ur vet finds out probably a female|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	yes females DO mount. but, when you take her to the vet to get her spayed they will tell you her gender.

Many pet quality dogs come from champion lines.  Very few of these make the grade as show dogs, and therefore breeding quality.  Only the best of the best should be bred and the only way to determine this is through their success in either the show ring or the working ring.<br>  <br>  Anyway, to answer your question.  If your dog hasn't been proven as a quality example of the breed through show or working succes, then he should never have been bred at all, and definitely should not be used for breeding ever again.  This is a cold, hard fact of responsible and ethical breeding.|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	Let the experienced breeders do the breeding.

hQQuqyYcaa	I would not recommend getting more than the 3 fish that you have already. Goldfish get HUGE (fancy goldfish can get approx. 7-10" long...and that's just the body). Even a 10 gallon for 3 full grown goldfish is way too small. Get the largest that you can have. Try for at least a 20 or 29 gallon tank. Even with weekly water changes, full grown goldfish can not live in a 10 gallon tank.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	If you dont want us to tell you 3 is too much. Well, you asked the wrong place. Stop being ignorant.<br>  <br>  3 fancies need at least 40 gallons. Its that simple. If you want to keep them in a 10 gallon, you have issues. 3 fancies in a 10 gallon will produce enough ammonia to poison them.<br>  <br>  If you dont want a specific answer that you probably know is right, dont even ask it on here. Because apparently you just want people to agree with your ignorance so you dont seem like the bad guy. I will not.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	No you can't put 5 goldfish in a 10 gallon tank, better make it 10, they might get lonely. Your gonna need a catfish too, goldfish are messy eaters and need something to clean up the leftovers. I would suggest a red tailed catfish, If you can't find one of these I guess a channel catfish will work too. Both should be right at home in that tank.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :  )|`|iJtuhLMTaa	No 10 gal is not large enough for 5 fancy goldfish it isn't even large enough for 1 fancy goldfish.  Fancy goldfish grow to 8"   the 3 you have now need at least a 40 gal tank, 5 would need at least a 55 gal.|`|00RgkZF8aa	Nope, 5 Goldfish will not fit in a 10 gallon tank.<br>  <br>  Each Goldfish grows up to a foot long, so 5 Goldfish needs at least a 60 gallon tank (20 for 1 Goldfish, then 10 for every additional one).|`|PqT6pQAoaa	3 is too much....<br>  <br>  you will need at least a 40g for 3 goldfishh|`|HqEbGN7taa	NO u cant if you have fancy goldfish which u do..the rule is 20 gallons for the first one then 10 gallons for every other fish u add...so if u have 3 then that means u need a 40 gallon tank....<br>  <br>  here put it like this if you live alone u need a 1 bedroom apt or house rite...then if u have room mates then u need extra bedrooms....u wouldnt have 3 people sleeping in one room...same as fish.
8hDMHudgaa	There are a few ways to doing this, but mostly just spend a lot of time with the bird. You could towel train him by wrapping him in a small towel, he might breath heavy, wait for him to calm down after doing this a few times, pet his head lightly until he calms down. Once he gets used to this, clip his wings and put him on the floor, somewhere where he cant get away like in a corner. Put some seeds on the floor and wait for him to calm down. Remember to always move slowly, make soft sound, talk to him so he will get used to you and your voice. Once he is a bit more relaxed put the spray millet on the floor and wait for him to eat it. When he gets really into it slowly take it away, and holding the very end of it, give it to him again. holding it closer and closer until he notices what your doing then just don't move for a while and let him eat. But mostly just spend time with him, make soft noises he likes and move slowly. These things take time, you cant just rush into it.|`|eo0Uv7Wsaa	Here you go <a href="http://www.parrotcentral.net/how_to_tame_a_small_bird.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.parrotcentral.net/how_to_tame...</a> Huge HUGE tip. Go somewhere, either a vet or maybe a pet/bird store and have them clip the flight feathers (they will grow back) You will pry NEVER be able to tame him while he can fly. He will just run from you. Good luck!
2CbfO4jWaa	they can reach 6 feet (but lean) and the caging for one is the same as caging for 3,  12'l X 6d' X 6'h     personally id go taller and deeper. indo monitors need space and hides at all levels of their enclosure!!!!!<br>   as far as green trees 4'l x 4'd x 6'l with as much usable space as possible (climable walls, and like a hundred cork bark tubes to hide in haha) green trees are work. stay away. hell for that matter stay away from mangroves too. both are lots of work, all wild caught, require way more work then most are willing to put in and are no fun. start thinking about ackie monitors, now they are FUN!!!|`|bFpET2G1aa	The adult Mangrove Monitor can reach an ultimate length of 5 feet, but on the average they tend to grow to a length of 3 ? feet to 4 feet which seems to be the norm. The lifespan of the Mangrove Monitor seems to be unclear in captivity, but in the wild the average lifespan is between 10 to 12 years. An educated guess of those for whom are in captivity would place their lifespan at 15 to 20 years given the proper care and maintenance. Hatchlings can be housed in a 10 gallon aquarium. Juveniles can be housed in a 29 gallon aquarium. The thing to remember with larger reptiles is the fact that they will grow rapidly until they become an adult. Bigger is better when it comes to large reptiles. You might want to start even a hatchling off in a 29 gallon aquarium. Adult Mangrove Monitors will more than likely need a custom made enclosure built by either a reptile enclosure specialist or you may opt to save money and construct an enclosure yourself. I recommend that the dimensions for the enclosure be at least 8’ X 2’ X 3’. The construction materials must be heavy duty grade and framed with 2” X 4’s”.

65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	The montarey bay aquarium does they are the best I have been there 2 times and the sunfish never gets old. By far the coolest fish they also have hammer head in that tank. <br>  <br>  If you are into aquariums you have to get your parents to take you to the montarey bay aquarium it's the coolest ever i'm 26 and I still love it everytime I can't wait to take my little girl there when she gets a bit older.<br>  <br>  So you are wrong little will. They can be kept in aquariums. The reason they do well at the bay aquarium is because they pump in water from the bay for all the tanks. They also will have a baby great white every now and then. But only if one is found hurt then when it gets to be 7 feet long they let it go. Look it up.|`|fqi5ttoiaa	sorry but no. it would be impossible for aquariums to keep the sunfish. they move along with the current and eat tiny plankton. which would be impossible to achive in a man made aquarium. not to mention the fact that they can weigh 2 tons and get almost 15 feet long!<br>  <br>  <br>  edit:sorry- what i meant to say is that they cant be  kept for long periods of time just like that great white that she was talking about. either its growth will get stunted or it will get far to large. i mean possibly if they build a 1,000,000 gallon tank it would work but i am no expert. and "little will" comon.<br>  <br>  hope i helped!<br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  p.s- keep up with your passion, im 15 right now and i was just like you at 11-12-13.All i thought i was doing is running up my electricity bill by having three fish tanks and a huge bearded dragon setup running in my room :) i thought it wouldn't get me anywhere but what would you know, i have a job at a pond and fish store, and i volunteer/intern at a marine wildlife rescue center!|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Those are awesome fish, but I haven't seen them at the Aquarium of the Pacific (The one in Long Beach, right?).

They often hold "adopt-a-thons" on the weekends where the fees are even less.<br>  <br>  If she wants a purebred, the prices can vary greatly.  Some person that happens to own a shihtzu may 'breed' it and sell the pups for very little.  A more reputable breeder may sell pet quality dogs for several hundred.  A show quality dog would cost you even more.  Your friend will just have to do her homework and shop around when it comes to finding a breeder.  It should NOT be an easy process.  If someone is selling their puppies for cheap and are eager to get rid of them, its not a reputable breeder.  If there's lots of questions and usually a application process, then its more likely that she's found a responsible breeder.

b2e521a2ccc3a131bc702e92d5845762aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  As a breeder of African serval pets, I know firsthand the interactions of Servals and domestic cats. An ADULT will not like a cat, nor any other pet that comes into the household. Therefore, you MUST have your Serval grow up with your cats if you want them to get along. Any other way will not work.|`|0bYcYz2jaa	Servals are not domestic cats.  They are a smaller wild species and I urge you to choose a breed that is domesticated.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Wild animals are NOT pets. In fact, servals can EAT other cats. Do not get one just because you want one. They're happier in the wild.|`|P8hOtEdOaa	They can if they were raised together.

OaaJ7o9Haa	You think he has ick? Ick is very obvious, white spots all over the fish and even the decor. If that's the case, go get medications. If you don't have meds, turn up the heat to about 82F and add an airstone. Ick will attach gills, making it hard for your fish to breathe. The increased aeration will be good for keeping the water oxygenated.<br>  <br>  His lethargy is a signs of stress from the illness. Clamped fins, not eating, hiding behind decor or plants are all signs of stress. Make sure it's ick before you medicate!|`|KEYgd73saa	The answer is in the first sentece.  It's a new fish.  New fish are extremely stressed, and will take a few hours-- even days-- to acclimate to their new environment.  Unless you see white, salt-like grains on the fish, there's absolutely no reason to think it's Ich.  Even if it was Ich, turning the temperature up to 82* would do nothing more than speed its progression-- until you get into the upper 80s (above 86*), there is NO chance of killing the parasite.  According to studies by the University of Florida, you have to actually top 90* before having much affect on the parasites.|`|kw1bBNqlaa	are his fins all choppy-ish?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and try and getting a bubble stone and/or a heater. he might be cold.<br>  <br>  go to petco or another pet store and ask them about it, they're usually really nice and help a lot.<br>  <br>  good luck!

4e1nRQCUaa	I don't mix my own, but some suggestions: nothing that would require crushing in the gizzard until 4 or 5 months old.  Make your life easier by using chick feed until then, and focus on what to feed adult chicks.<br>  Since I buy mine, I get laying feed and scratch grain.  Scratch grain is cheaper than feed, and they seem to like it. They do need meat.  If you have enough bugs, worms, frogs, moles, etc for the chickens in their run, fine.  Otherwise, you need to add meat.  One chicken rancher I knew was losing chickens.  He thought it was a fox or coyote, but found out it was the chickens going cannibal because not enough meat.  He went and shot some rabbits, and threw them in.  He kept doing that until the chickens stopped eating the rabbits, and then they also stopped eating each other.  <br>  If your chickens will be laying, then make sure they get plenty of calcium.  Do not feed them egg shells, because you do not want them to get a taste for eggs.|`|PmwX2VXOaa	ya know what? forgive me, but if you know enough to order chicks you damn sure better know what you're doing. what the hell do you mean? ordering blindly not knowing how to take care of them........you sound like the octomom. maybe you shouldn't raise anything|`|GQZDcfUiaa	Go to a feed store and ask for 'chick starter' and add some vitamins to their water.<br>  Do you have them in a brooder?

AA11640918	There fairly easy to care for. I have owned chickens for 16 years. I absolutly enjoy there company and personality.<br>  <br>  Feeding: They eat if there adults or 2-3 months old afe scratch feed. If there younger thay eat chick starter. You can also when they are a bit older give them fresh fruits and veggies. <br>  <br>  Housing: They need to be safe from preditors. I do NOT confine my birds in a coop, they free range. This is great because it makes them want to lay more eggs. If you have a barn/shed, thats perfect. The shed needs to have a foot by foot or so bigger dpending on the size of your chickens.

I keep chickens letting them out during the day then close them into a pen about the size of a shed I only have 10. With straw as bedding cause you remove the worst dirt when cleaning out and shake out the straw to remove droppings. Provide perching areas branches etc and mine like hutches to nest in.|`|nTKohd71aa	In my opinion, chickens are very easy and rewarding to care for. The main problem I had was foxes, coyotes and the such. I wanted free range birds and the predators said,THANK YOU for the free meal. I will do things different this year.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	You already posted this question once? <br>  <br>  Chickens are fairly easy to look after; they need a shed or coop with perches to roost in at night and nest boxes to lay eggs in. They must have access to a pen or garden during the daytime, preferably with grass to scrat around in. They need special poultry "laying" food for the minerals and vitamins they need to lay eggs and they need access to clean water. The shed will need cleaning out every couple of weeks. <br>  <br>  The down side is you have to be around morning to let them out and feed them and be around every evening to put them away otherwise predators might eat them. That means if you go away on holidays or even for a day you have to get someone else reliable to do it.
qBmYawwraa	Hi There,<br>  <br>  I run puppy preschool classes at the vet surgery where I work and my best advice is to clean the area where he is urinating with washing soda and water, then put some of his food (even throw a few of his kibbles there) or put his bed there. Generally dogs don't like to urinate where they eat or sleep. Many of my clients find that placing the food where the dog is urinating really helps. Also a few tips to do:<br>  <br>  Always place him on the grass (or wee pad) as soon as he wakes up, eats or drinks<br>  If he urinates on the pad make sure to reward him, but never punish him for urinating elsewhere if you don't catch him in the action<br>  A dog will stop urinating if it is picked up, so if you catch him urinating somewhere unwanted, simply pick him up and place him on the grass or the wee pad to finish his business.<br>  <br>  Patience is the key as it does take time and dedication to get the ball rolling, also most puppies are more open to learning between the ages of 6-16 weeks so he should pick it up fairly quickly.<br>  <br>  Enjoy him while he is still a puppy and good luck!|`|FnrAw2SQaa	First of all keep in mind that wee wee pads may be confusing to your puppy if you want him to go potty outside. Puppies are not always going to know the difference between appropriate papers on the floor and the newspaper that you have not finished reading. Potty training requires consistency. After napping eating or drinking the pup should be taken to the appropriate place. There should be no playtime at that place until they have gone to the bathroom. As soon as they urinnate or defecate they should be praised excessively and given a small treat. If they havent gone in a few minutes they should be brought in and placed in their crate if they cannot be watched constently. If they have made a mistake in they house you can wipe it up with a paper towel and plave the paper towel or stool in the place where you want them to go for your next attempt. Puppies should go out often and praised each time they go potty in the correct area. It is not appropriate to punish your puppy for making a mistake in the house.  If cought in the act you may distract them with a sharp noise and take them right outside. If you find a mess in the hous that you did not observe, please, keep in mind that the pup has no recollection of doing that.  Ther are many good websites. I would direct anyone to PetPartner.com for all kinds of GOOD advice <br>  <br>  <br>  potty pad training <br>  When you see your pup beginning to do the circle peepee dance, gently say no no no. Go to the pup and pick him up and place him on the pad and give him a little pat on the head. You already know he has to go, so if he tries to leave the pad, pick him up and put him back. Keep doing this until he gets the hint and goes. If you get tired after the 8th time, let him walk away. Now if he does the peepee dance again, do your part again. Consistency is the key, not to mention patience on your part. Remember never yell.....I can't stress this enough. Yelling alone can scare the pup|`|fa94015ff5f0c6080fd3861b1e008e8caa	When he pees on the floor RIGHT AWAY say NO and put him on the pad. Then clean it up. But you have to make sure ALL of the odor is gone because his nose is WAY better than yours and even if you cant smell it he can. and he will now see that spot as a bathroom. Clean it up with NATURES MIRICLE, you can get it at most pet stores. <br>  <br>  I hope things work out with your littl guy. :)|`|79acae0a5d876b4ac47d05ffaf343575aa	i too have a 5 month old chiuaua, i have found that he will use the pad if it is CLEAN, hell go 1 or 2 times on it and then  will weewee everywhere else. if i change to a fresh pad he will use it almost every time. also when he goes  on the pad i make a big fuss, good boy peanut , and give him a special treat that he loves, i ONLY  give it to him when he goes on the pad(he loves this) hope this helps.
eo0Uv7Wsaa	You could try clipping his flight feathers. It might make it easier.  I know when mine has them he is all over the place! But if I clip them he loves me more than anything. But to get his trust...just give him toys and treats...introduce him to sugarless cereals and stuff like that! :-) He will get there. <br>  <br>  p.s. He sounds so cute! I'm glad you read up on him before getting him. Most people don't and end up not taking care of them properly. It's good to hear someone does their homework first!|`|3TM4TLdfaa	wow u must really care about him if u wrote all that. thats sweet.<br>  u just got to earn his trust obviously, but just feed him his favorite treats when u see just the least bit of improvement and be nice with him oh and by the way it will take some time to get him to fully trust u it always does with birds so don't worry he'll come around.
AA11992723	when a dog can't growl (give warning) they go straight to biting, your husband is right. Instead of using punishment when he growls, work on positive association with other people. When people come to your house, the dog gets lots of goodies (high value treats, praise, pet) by you and your husband BEFORE he shows warning signs.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Your fiance's right, you shouldn't punish your dog for growling or what's going to happen is you're going to end up with a dog who's going to bite someone with no warning.<br>  <br>  BUT, you absolutely have to get this dog some help here.  If you continue doing nothing, this dog is going to bite someone and it's the dog who's going to pay the price - he's going to be put to sleep because you didn't socialize or train him.<br>  <br>  Please, take him to obedience classes (no Petsmart classes) where a qualified instructor can teach you how to train him and he can also be socialized in a controlled environment.  He's growling at people because he's fearful, not because he's showing dominance, and that's the kind of dog who will bite one day if you don't work on getting him some help right now.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	It is never good if I dog growls at people. That very low growl is the sure sign of aggression and it will escalate. You have a very powerful dog and he needs to be obedience trained and socialized. Why wait until it escalates into something else?|`|cY8DgJv5aa	He shouldn't be punished for the growling, but he should be properly trained and socialized so that he doesn't growl in the first place.  Does that make sense?  Its all about positive reinforcement.  Rather than growling being a bad and horrible thing, he just needs to be taught that NOT growling results in lots of praise and treats.  If he growls, he should be removed from the situation.  If he doesn't growl, he gets a treat and praise.  (There should be some kind of command to go with it such as "hush" or something like that).  Eventually, he'll understand that not growling gets him good attention and growling gets him no attention at all.|`|fa94015ff5f0c6080fd3861b1e008e8caa	as long as the dog doesn't go any further than growling it'll be fine..<br>  but the fact that it makes people nervous tells me that you should tell him not to do that..<br>   It would almost be better if you trained him to growl at people coming to the door but then when they came up and pet him that he would be fine.. <br>   <br>  If you want to do that they whenever he growls at someone up close just say VERY firmly NO whenever he does it. and if he doesn't stop just take him into a different room for a bit.. and if he growls at people coming to the door just praise him.  <br>  If you want that.. But I think that would be best..<br>  I hope it all works out for you though! :)<br>  either way all those breeds are very nice smart dogs so it should be fine :)|`|oK5kVlrnaa	You should definently stop your dog from growling at people. I recently got a chow/husky mix puppy and she tends to growl. We are training her to not since this can lead and will lead to aggresion towards people that are unknown to him/her. So please dont let your dog growl at any people or other dogs. However, as you said if this is not an aggressive growl and its just a play growl, you can let that go!|`|iqLfKfRvaa	teach ur dog not to growl it could mean that it is over protective  and it could turn voliant|`|FC9J4aiuaa	Aggressive growling can be a rude trait to any dog, and shouldn't be aloud. If they are aloud to grown and they figure out that not stopping them from entering his territory it can lead to worse reactions such as nipping and biting<br>  <br>  I suggest saying a harsh "no", when visits come over and he growls, as well as having them give him a treat that is only used for when visitors come over (leave a bag of rare/special treats near the door so he can be immediately praised when he is no longer growling and shows kindness to visitors)<br>  <br>  If he still doesn't stop growling, separate him from everyone (put him in an empty room with the door closed) and later when he calms down reintroduce him to every one with the visitors having the special treats. being friendly=treats. if he still growls close him in a room and try again later when he calms down again.<br>  <br>  it can take a while to break a bad habit like this.<br>  <br>  growling with a playful stance is different from growling with a stiff stance.
jiwTWNNtaa	I don't think any towns post this info online anywhere. At the town hall, they should be able to dig through the file cabinet and find the owner on Monday.<br>  <br>  Leave a message on the animal control or call the cops and let them know you found this dog in case the owner contacts them.

v0RsFaAzaa	I think that you should still take her to the vet and have her leg x-rayed. At least that way you will know if there was any damage done and what you will have to do to fix it. Chihuahuas bones are very fragile and it doesn't take much pressure,  to fracture or break a leg.  If she is still limping after a few days, then something isn't right and it needs to be looked at! Hope she's ok!|`|bqbrKFeUaa	Oh no big deal it will heal itself just give it time. Don't let the dog do something extremely crazy and try to keep her calm until she can walk normal. But don't worry.|`|POFdWpUzaa	My Shih Tzu did something similar to one of her front legs and the vet x-rayed so we'd know it wasn't broken. I don't understand why the vet didn't tell you what my vet told me. Keep the dog extremely quiet for 2 weeks. No jumping, playing, running, no nothing. I put her on her leash to go to the backyard, carried her around quite a bit. Keep your dog really quiet to let her little leg heal! Repeatedly injuring the same unhealed leg could cause her major problems, if not soon, then later on.|`|bxLdsIruaa	i would say that you should watch her for a day or so and if she still has a problem walking properly or standing on all four legs then take her to the vet to get it wrapped up or looked at. just to make sure its nothing too serious. <br>  <br>  im sure she'll be fine but just to be on the safe side, get her checked out if it doesnt get better on it own. :)|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	As long as it's just a sprain she will be fine.  Just give her time to heal.<br>  Try to keep her from jumping off things and getting over excited.<br>  If it's swollen you can put some ice on it.<br>  Or even wrap it up in an Ace Bandage not too tight though.  And take it off once in a while.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with your dog!|`|iqLfKfRvaa	go to the vet and tell them to get her a Perception for pain meds and make shure she stays still and keep her leg elevated|`|AA10280209	My chihuahua did the same thing three times and it took him several days to get over it each time.
wqchA8B7aa	They're cool. Just having one makes you cooler, too. I want one.|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	Trained well = good dog.|`|qBmYawwraa	They are lovely natured but are riddled with health problems. Any anaesthetic is a risk with bulldogs as their facial structures are brachiocephalic which makes it difficult to insert ET tubes. Many Bulldogs also develop skin problems and are prone to hot spots. Bulldogs do not tend to tolerate the heat and this can cause stress on the heart causing heart attacks.<br>  <br>  Bulldogs ARE lovely but the vet fees are high and the risk of it not living long is also very high so consider this before you buy one!|`|0pVXLyGhaa	I think many people who come on Yahoo Answers wanting Bulldogs aren't realistic about how much these dogs cost (cost between $2,000 and $4,000).  <br>  <br>  And if you do get a cheaper bulldog at $1,500 or so, then be prepared for high vet bills because these dogs are prone to a lot of health problems.  And a cheaply bred dog will be more likely to have these health problems.<br>  <br>  The dogs don't breed naturally requiring artificial insemination and also cesarean section for birthing.  This is part of why the cost is so high... also it's just supply and demand... there is a huge demand for bulldogs and a more limited supply at this time.<br>  <br>  Overall though, I think they are very nice looking dogs with good temperaments.  <br>  <br>  Be careful about buying one though as they are also used in scams.... that is... a country like Cameroon will offer CHEAP bulldog puppies, but it is just a scam to get your money and you will never see a dog at all.|`|mfXDUkRYaa	I think they have been bred to ridiculous standards. Lovely dogs generally, but their heads are so big that they often need to have caesareans. They also can't mate unaided, which I also think is cruel as the female doesn't get a choice. They often get short of breath just walking due to the way inbreeding has shaped their noses.
vS1Z0inOaa	Yes, they eat guppies or minnows. The turtle food should only account for about 20% of the diet. You can offer dark leafy greens to add variety too but the base should be whole live food like the feeder fish.|`|wBzp5fOjaa	go to your local petstore and get some baby turtle food.and also ask them to make sure that it eats that. hope i helped.

a1PcWRQOaa	what are they
GT6396BDaa	The best thing to give your dog if they are constipated is canned pumpkin.  Just give him a tablespoon of it.  I don't know what size of dog you have but start with 1 tablespoon.  It's safe for dogs, it works great and dogs love it.  Basically, it's a natural laxative for dogs.  Much better than a laxative pill.  <br>  I would also look up the local emergency vet near you.  Most vets, if you call them, there is a message giving you the phone number of the emergency vet in your area.<br>  If your dog is still throwing up, I would call them.  It is important to get your dog to drink water if they want it because they can become dehydrated and that would cause even more problems.  Just don't let him drink a lot.  <br>  If your dog's stomach is bloated and tight, that usually means the dog either has a blockage or is constipated.  I don't know how long it's been since your dog pooped.  Try the pumpkin.  You may need to give him a couple of tablespoons of the canned pumpkin. If your dog is a medium to large size dog, it may take more pumpkin. Also, gently massagage his abdomen. <br>  After you give him the pumpkin, walk him about an hour or so later unless he needs to go sooner.  Watch him and if he gets worse, you need to call or take him to the emergency vet.  If it's serious, he may need to be seen before Monday.  <br>  I know your dog must be feeling bad.  Usually, if it's just a stomach virus, it will pass within a day or so.  <br>  If he starts acting like he usually does, the vomiting calms down and he poops, feed your dog a light meal, such as chicken and rice, scrambled egg or mashed potatoes. <br>  Hopefully the pumpkin will help your dog feel better.  Just give him what he can tolerate.  Hopefully, if it's just a stomach virus, it will only last a day or so. <br>  Best of luck to your dog.  Hope I helped.|`|Dkb2ZR3Daa	This poor dog...<br>  First of all, do you even realize how rare it is for a dog to be constipated without being obstructed or having some other medical problem?? You can't simply solve the problem by giving him a laxative-in fact you can do more damage to colon/intestinal track-perhaps even causing a prolapsed anus. <br>  This dog-whether you have the money or not needs to be seen by a vet. Borrow money for friends, put in on the credit card, whatever you need to do.<br>  <br>  Dog that are vomiting food and water and unable to keep themselves hydrated will die...|`|AA11244754	usually a dog eats grass to settle an upset stomach and to get what is causing the vomiting out of their system.

You can obtain mother's milk replacer for young kittens at many of the pet stores in the area. When the kittens are 8 weeks or older, they no longer need the milk but may enjoy it anyway. Milk that has been specially processed for cats to consume safely is available from many local groceries.|`|b9340e25c5c91b1731a01132aab4d92daa	You can buy a product call "cat milk".

mNBhYBAfaa	how i did it was let them outside ofter.show them where they have to go potty. take 'it' when they wake from a nap, after food/drink, when they start to sniff around too much. Praise them a lot when they go in the spot you want and if you have to, wait. they wont get it at first but again, everything takes time. Try and associate a word with it also, i used "go pee". every time my dogs go outside i say "good boy/girl go pee, go pee". don't scald them when they go inside the house either. that does no good. they wont know what you are mad them about unless u catch them in the act and sometimes its not easy to do so. ignore bad behavior and praise good. they will learn. it took me 2month to train 2 puppies to go outside. now they know to come get me and take me to the door when they have to go. good luck!<br>  Source(s):|`|KfxLWlfjaa	When it looks like shes getting ready to "go"(she may scratch the floor), Take it to the grass and while shes going in the grass praise her.

Try to prevent her from licking it - maybe put a sock on her foot so she can't lick it.  The sock will also help keep it clean too if she will leave it on.  Take her to the vet in the morning to get some antibiotics for her to take to clear up the infection.

My dogs find it entertaining and its a great alternative to feeding from a dish. Its great mental stimulation because they must figure out how to get the food out.|`|yQYzgf3Gaa	Hide some tasty treats around the house and lead the dog to the room where the treats are. Make sure you note though where you've put them or you very well may come home to a shredded couch cushion as your dog finally finds one of the tasty morsels when you're not home. <br>  <br>  Stuff a few Kong toys  with some interesting foods. This should keep a dog busy for at least 10-15 minutes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Of course, the very logical way to occupy your dog indoors is to practice some obedience training. Do these trainings for 5-10 minutes at a stretch (depending on your dog's obedience level). Work on sit, stay, and down or, if your dog is more advanced, throw in a few retrieves. <br>  <br>  <br>  Teach your dog to search for treats by showing him a treat and placing it beneath a piece of furniture, a rug, or any other accessible hiding place. Let your dog see where you’ve put the first treat, and encourage him to get it. Hide the next treat without showing him where you’ve put it, and enthusiastically tell him to find the treat. It may take him awhile to catch on, but in time, he’ll learn your hiding places and he’ll enjoy seeking out his tasty rewards. <br>  <br>  <br>  Wrestling<br>  <br>  Larger dogs love to wrestle, and if you want to have fun with your dog indoors, get down on the floor and enjoy a friendly wrestling match. Not only will your dog have a good time, but also you’ll burn some calories in the process. If the wrestling match ever starts to become too aggressive, calm it down a bit and always stay in control of the game. Make sure your dog realizes this gentle wrestling match is just for fun.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	You could snap a leash on his collar and take him for a walk.|`|6hvf02Eyaa	Anyplace to walk or take him in the car that is not muddy?

4i4Li1WEaa	You should have a petsitter come in and let the dog out (or walk him if you don't have a fenced yard) once or twice while you are away. Your pet doesn't just need to go to the bathroom; he needs attention and exercise. He is acting out because he is bored and wound up. (A tired dog tends to be a good dog!) Having someone spend even half an hour with him will make a huge difference. There is also a safety concern with leaving pets unattended for so long. I used to be a petsitter.  I went to a house one hot day and found that the a/c had gone off. The dog was on the verge of heatstroke. He could have died by the time his people got home from work. A petsitter is your best option.

The length a can vary depending on what you want, but most are in 1/2 hour periods (1/2 hour or 1 hour). <br>  <br>  If there is one near you, you can take him to doggy day care. He spends the day with people and other dogs. <br>  <br>  Putting him in a bedroom or bath room can be a good idea. Take out anything he can get into. Give him something to do, like a bone, kong to other toy.

It will be much better for his socialization and psychological health while protecting your carpet at the same time.  <br>  <br>  If dog day care is not an option, consider hiring someone to release him and take him for walks one or more times each day.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, it's especially important that you spend as much time as possible with him and make sure he gets as much exercise as you can manage.  A tired dog is usually a well behaved dog.|`|X6rFPI2laa	When I was at work my dog had the run of my kitchen and connecting downstairs bath, but that was all.  She always had fresh water and a couple of toys, and a throw rug for naps.  There are 2 doorways from the kitchen to the rest of the house, and I bought 2 sheets of pegboard, which is MUCH cheaper than plywood or baby gates, and painted them white to match the woodwork.  One is normally hidden behind the piano and slides out to block off one doorway, and the other is hidden behind a set of shelves and slides out to block off the other doorway.  Nowdays I put her in the kitchen when I go run errands -- she is completely reliable in the house, but does tend to set off the alarm system!  So for your dog, think about putting the crate into the kitchen for his "house" with its door open, and block off doors from the kitchen to the rest of the house.

If the dog really does need to be put down you might consider phoning the vet.  Ask how much to put a dog down.  Tell your neighbor you want that much plus a little for your gas etc.  Then take the dog to the vet to be put down humanely.<br>  .  Some people find it extremely hard to put their dogs down even if it is ending the dogs suffering.  If you don't do it your neighbor might just let the dog suffer.  Or get someone else who will do it in a inhumane way.<br>  .  So its up to you if you feel comfortable doing this for your neighbor.<br>  Most of all don't just take the dog and try to kill it your self.|`|fOLO4TNhaa	Say yes, take the dog but here is the catch instead of killing it, take it in to a no-kill shelter so they can treat the dog and find the dog a good home.

Good luck:)<br>  xx|`|nmercOm7aa	You need to at least file a found dog report with your local animals services or SPCA. <br>  If you just keep the dog and an owner comes forward, they can take legal action against you. <br>  You may need to take the dog in. If the owner comes forward, then it goes home, if not if can be adopted out. You can put your name on a waiting list to adopt the dog. This is the legal way to get the dog. The stray time is usually 3-7 days depending on if the dog had ID or not. <br>  <br>  How would you feel if someone found your dog and didn't even try to contact you and they kept the dog?|`|P8Q39vA4aa	Legally you have to do everything you can to find the owner. Once that has been done and no owner you can keep her. It is likely she has an owner. Put of fliers of found dog in the area. Have the vet scan for a microchip or look for tattoos. Go to local vets in the area you found her to see if they may know the dog and the owner.|`|ydshiNrKaa	You need to make every attempt to find her owners.  She obviously is someones pet especially if she has recently been spayed.  Put out flyer's in all the vet offices, the humane society, grocery stores, pet stores, any place where there are lots of people who will see it.  Put an ad in the paper.  If after 2 weeks of the flyer's being posted no one contacts you about the dog, you can assume the owner is not going to come forward.|`|Bw18seFqaa	legally you are obligated to try to find the owner..  check the paper for lost ads,..  put up a found ad in the paper, put vague info tho "Found female dog on X road, Call to ID"..  also take her to the shelter and have her scanned for a microchip.<br>  <br>  If no one claims her, you can keep her.|`|tMJhvpeEaa	If you love the dog so much then keep her|`|426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	Post FOUND signs up around the neighborhood including any pet stores or vets in the area.

ZQJfkGwJaa	When is the last time this cat was seen by a vet? You need to make an appointment ASAP. I seriously doubt if the flea collar has anything to do with it. Those things are so useless they don't even make the fleas sick, much less the cat.|`|Ekvjs8RBaa	Take her to the vet!! the fur could be alot of things, as could the drippy nose. Has she had her vaccinations? There are vaccinations other than rabies (which is manditory for cats too, not just dogs). Medicine for cat and dog illnesses are almost as advanced as people medicines so they can give you something to fix most things and be able to tell you the problem.
a5ff5ZlAaa	Your chihuahua will probably be a lil sad, however they get over it. Just take em for a walk alot, and give him some good stuff to eat. Make him meet a new friend your neibours pet or something.<br>  <br>  GL, hope ur dog gets better|`|q7GBzr6yaa	Step1  Check for lethargy. A common sign of depression in dogs is an abnormal state of laziness. You’ll tend to notice it’s a bit sluggish and indifferent. It can usually be accompanied by a lot of laying about and moping. If your dog is normally active and now refuses to play, it could be a tell tale sign of depression.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Step2  Make sure your dog is eating properly. This can be the hardest hitting symptom of depression. When a dog is depressed, it sometimes will refuse to eat or even drink, leading to drastic losses in weight. <br>  <br>  <br>  Step3  Examine your dog’s sleeping habits. Sleeping for hours on end, only to wake up to urinate and continue sleeping is a common sign of depression.<br>  <br>   <br>  Step4  Rule out all possible physical causes. Go to your veterinarian and make sure your dog’s abnormal behavior isn’t related to anything physical, such as a soreness or disease. <br>  <br>  Step5  Get your dog help. If your dog is depressed, it may be only temporary. Often a change of residence or the loss of a family member may cause temporary depression in pets. If the problem seems chronic, visit your vet or a pet psychologist to discuss methods of treatment, including behavioral approaches and medication.|`|gUBgKegjaa	plzz take her to the vet u need to huge her love her what ever u would want when ur sad|`|wdKsVqbnaa	Yes, she's probably grieving the loss of her buddy.

Find out and keep that person out of your house. Otherwise, a visit to the vet is in order. Meanwhile, spend as much quiet time with him as you can. Reassure him that he's safe and not being threatened.|`|srjPOxW7aa	was there anyone else around your cat? if they could have mistreated him. Or if something had fallen on him or around your kitty that startled him.
ydshiNrKaa	It's puppy smell.  Use some baby wipes and just wipe him down.  Washing him when he is this young may not be a very good idea.  You just got him for one thing, so stressing him out by trying to give him a bath is not going to be a good thing for him.  He is already stressed out being away from his mom and siblings, so don't add to that by submitting him to a bath with water and soap, two things he has no idea what they are.  Give him time to adjust to his new surroundings and to you.  Just wipe him off with some baby wipes, which should help with the smell a little bit.|`|34uWa9kHaa	No it is not to early and giving him a bath is not going to tramatize him.   All our dogs have had a bath as soon as we have got them puppy or adult.    Just got a puppy 2 wks ago and he got a bath at 7wks.   <br>  <br>  Use a puppy shampoo.  If the pup has fleas you can use regular Dawn dishsoap.|`|t4yBwlr6aa	Allow the puppy to settle down some before bathing him. There are dry shampoos or wipes you could use on him to help with the smell. If it's fleas you're trying to rid, Lemon Joy dish detergent works GREAT, it kills the fleas. But you also want to make sure that you don't wash your dog or puppy too much b/c it could dry the skin out, maybe once every week and a half to every two weeks would be ok. Hope this helps and good luck !|`|SONPeyAqaa	Just use baby wipes to wipe him off!!! congrats on the new puppy!!
hshdozKCaa	It is most likely the dust, my horse does the same thing. If there is a manager of the barn you may want to ask and see if the arena can be watered down everyonce in a while...it'll help cut down on the dust. Another thing you MAY want to check, just incase, is that your girth isn't too tight, sometimes if I cinch up a bit to tight my horse will cough when we start doing any heavier type work (cantering, long periods of trotting),they do this in an effort to try to get more air when they are breathing heavier.<br>  <br>  It most likely is just the dust though, no need for too much concern, she should be fine.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	Some horses are just more sensitive. I would start by wetting down her hay. It might not help, but it certainly can't hurt. If the arena gets really dusty in the winter see if you can get the barn manager to water it down.|`|1bLkbJZXaa	My sisters horse had a pretty bad cough for a week, didnt go away. so the vet came over - just checked her out and gave us some medicine pills to feed her. within a week she was fine. he said it was just allergies or something acting up in her throat. <br>  we just crushed the pills in grain and she ate them|`|tWTJ4CSIaa	Sometimes the horses in my barn get basically a cold (as my trainer explained it to me) and they tend to cough a little bit as they are working more.  She says that it is just part of the winter time and nothing to worry about (at least in our horses).  But watch her and make sure that if it starts getting worse you call your vet ASAP.  <br>  <br>  I doubt that it is dust unless your barn is REALLY dusty.  I kept my old horse at a barn FULL of dust (like I couldn't breathe after an hour in there) but none of the horses were coughing.|`|IQP0mIMmaa	if shes couging when eating ect try adding a little water to feeds to stop the dust from flying around n as for the arena i would try to water it lightly before riding in it|`|MU58uEk3aa	Allergies .
MPQI8Bg3aa	6 Tiger Barbs is a lot for a 25 gallon tank, especially with all of those other fish. They also tend to be nippers, which would be exacerbated by the cramped quarters. I would suggest skipping them. All of the other fish that you picked are known to be pretty peaceful. My only other recommendation is to get only male platys and guppies because if you mix sexes they will breed like crazy! Male guppies are much more colorful than female, so they are easy to distinguish. The platys can be differentiated by the anal fin, females have a rounded anal fin which males have a long skinny one. Here is a picture that shows what I mean: <a href="http://www.fishforum.com/userpix/2862_male1female_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishforum.com/userpix/2862_ma...</a><br>  <br>  Make sure you cycle your tank and good luck!|`|nHp8zzkjaa	Everything but the barb will get alone.<br>  Barbs are very aggressive fish that may pick on the others. Instead of barbs you could get a pleco to control algae growth.<br>  <br>  Also any of the other types of tetras.<br>  Stay away from sharks, barbs, chilids and oscars.<br>  <br>  Also you should only have 1 gal per 1 inch of fish. So if you just get rid of the barbs on your list you should have a very happy tank.<br>  <br>  Ask a store associate about which fish they have that are tropical community fish.|`|AXXDyKecaa	i'm pretty sure they won't kill each other.<br>  i had 3 neon tetras named the jabbawockeez.<br>  they died..<br>  sad day..<br>  sad day...<br>  <br>  but that's too many fish for your tank..<br>  i have 15 fish in a 40 gallon tank.
zTeLhroWaa	always takes me about a month to see my new baby leos' tails get much thicker than they were when i got them.  pet stores are notorious for not caring for their leos like they should.  Buy a gram scale.  I bet you it's gained a bit of weight, you just can't see it yet.  Make sure you have calcium available to it and are dusting its food with vitamins.  This will help it grow healthily.|`|fbxrbpkAaa	when me and my sister both had geckos my leopard gecko ate my sisters geckos tail off but it grew back|`|hshdozKCaa	leopard geckos' tails often don't start to fatten up until they are bit older, so as long as he/she is eating healthy for you, i wouldn't worry too much. But there is also the chance of parasites, if there is no improvement and the geckos actualy body, not just the tail, starts to get skinny, I would take it to see a vet who can prescribe meds to get rid of any parasites/worms it may have.<br>  <br>  site for herp vet listing:<br>  <a href="http://www.reptilechannel.com/reptile-health/vet-listing.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.reptilechannel.com/reptile-he...</a>|`|zo5ViYQVaa	No, it's not normal. The tail should look very fat because this is where they store their fat. After another month or so, it should be back to normal with what you're feeding, as long as you feed him every day.
CuP846Ezaa	I give my poultry apple cider vinegar to acidify their guts, its suppose to stop the worms, I dont know if this does the same thing in horses but maybe she was infested with worms (the getting fat in the gut?) and now you have dosed her she's expelled alot of them and looks to be more hollow now. Again I dont know about the vinegar in horses just what it does for poultry.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Michelle|`|B6zl0AJDaa	The ACV probably had NOTHING to do with the drop in weight (How much are you giving her?) and if you haven't seen her in two days, then she hasn't been getting it for 2 days I'm guessing.  I give mine about 1/2 Cup of ACV a day and haven't had any reactions to it in the 30 years I've been feeding it.<br>  <br>  Did you check to see if her waterer is working or if she just has a tub waterer, that she's been drinking water?   That will suck up a horse faster than anything.  <br>  <br>  Does she have a  salt block in her stall?  If she will use it then she will drink water.|`|tWTJ4CSIaa	You need to check on her worming schedule.  Have you had the vet come and worm her on top of the worming pastes?  Have you been rotating the worming paste active ingredient? Have you been consistant and kept up with her worming?<br>  <br>  It sounds like a classic case of a worm problem to me.
Lxn0wNb1aa	The gulf saratoga, Sceleropages jardinii, is a freshwater bony fish native to Australia, one of two species of fishes sometimes known as Australian arowanas, the other being the saratoga (S. leichardti). It has numerous other common names, including northern saratoga, Australian bonytongue, toga and barramundi (not to be confused with the barramundi perch, Lates calcarifer). It is a member of the subfamily Osteoglossinae, a (basal) teleost group. Its scientific name is sometimes spelled S. jardini.<br>  This fish has a long, dark-colored body with seven rows of large scales, each with several reddish or pinkish spots arranged in a crescent shape around the trailing edge of the scale, giving it a pearly appearance. Its has large, wing-like pectoral fins. Except for duller coloration and smaller scale size, it appears very similar to the Asian arowana, S. formosus. It grows to a length of about 90 cm (35 in.). Its maximum weight is recorded as 17.2 kg (38 lb.), but one report suggests it has been known to weigh as much as 27 kg (59 lb.). The depth of the bodies of adults is approximately 25-28% of the Standard Length, making this a more robust fish than its Australian cousin S. leichardti.<br>  <br>  Like other arowanas, it is a mouthbrooder, but unlike the Asian Arowana, reports suggest the female rather than the male broods the young in her mouth.<br>  <br>  Due to their resemblance to the Asian arowanas they are sometimes sold in the name of golden arowana in some of the Asian countries, like India. However they can be easily distinguished from the Asian arowanas by identifying their red spotted fins & 7-8 rows of scales on their body.|`|bjSEgjeRaa	The Australian Arowana is the 2nd most commonly sold arowana next to the silver arowana here in the Philippines. The store owners tell me that this arowana has a very fearsome reputation and was reported very hostile to other tankmates so it is better to be left alone in a tank. Although I haven't seen an adult australian, the juvenile seems to match the silver arowana in terms of its appetite|`|9Cb0ZUkPaa	<a href="http://seeanswers.fotoloser.com.ar" rel="nofollow">http://seeanswers.fotoloser.com.ar</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.

Try reasearching some tips on:<br>  <br>  www.google.com<br>  www.ask.com<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck !|`|OyNJTWaiaa	Hardly anyone sells a talking bird. If they have put all the love and time into teaching a bird to talk rarely do they ever sell it. You dont buy a bird that already talks as a baby...much training goes into it and a lot of time and patience. <br>  Sometimes, due to bad circumstances someone will offer for sale a talking bird, but the price will be high.|`|9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	Ok so not ALL birds talk. There is nothing like "talking birds" that you can buy unless you buy a bird that someone has trained to talk. If you like birds for reasons other than talking get a bird who is young and you can teach the bird to talk by just repeating words and giving the bird treat and repeating this day by day. <br>  <br>  There is no guarantee that the bird will talk. And most cases can outlive owners so birds are LONG term commitments so be careful beofre getting a bird. They require time/love and LOTs of attention especially if you want them to talk.
4yt4D3vMaa	Your rabbit's diet isn't ideal I'm afraid-potatoes,tomatoes, mushrooms and breadballs are too starchy and may cause gut problems and apples should only be given occasionally as they are sugary. Lettuce should be the dark leafy kind not iceberg-spinach is very good for rabbits so I would stick with that and try some other greens like broccoli and spring greens.I don't know what the food brands are as I'm in the UK but if they are plain pellet type and not mix then that's fine.I would give her more timothy hay as that's the best thing for them to eat-it gives them the fibre they need and keeps their teeth worn down.Ideal rabbit diet <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/diet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bio.miami.edu/hare/diet.html</a>|`|UeOtjPP5aa	My rabbits are all fed high-fiber food with appropriate protein levels to match their weight.<br>  <br>  They get several varieties of fresh veggies and herbs throughout the week, including parsley, romaine lettuce [never iceberg], cilantro, mint, marjoram, oregano, basil, and others. During the spring and summer, I grow my own herb garden for them<br>  <br>  Sugary fresh foods such as apples, carrots, bananas, and strawberries are given to them as treats only.<br>  <br>  All the bunnies are free-fed a mix of timothy hay and orchard grass.<br>  <br>  The buns will occasionally get black oil sunflower seeds and old fashioned rolled oats to keep their coats shiny and soft. They also get papaya tablets to help break down any fur they may digest. <br>  <br>  I would HIGHLY suggest staying away from anything Kaytee, especially Kaytee Fiesta. Not only is this food extremely low in fiber, but Fiesta also has bunches of unhealthy grains in it that cause obesity.|`|rmSdDT5Faa	not crazy, they like variety like we do, i give mine bananas too, she loves them, and also broccoli stumps, loves tat too, give it a phone book, it will have lots of fun shreadding the paper and its so cute, keeps em busy, <br>  <br>  i put the timothy hay in the litter box tho in the corner and she going in there eats in and does her business and then goes on her way, shes a house bun<br>  <br>  <br>  mushrooms,potatos and tomatoes?? i dont know about that!|`|tTbJWVTiaa	in the morning..parsleey or lettuce or carrorts..sometimes a mixture of two of the three<br>  <br>  at night some grain..i forget what its called<br>  <br>  i put timothy hay for my bunny when i remember.. its really good for their digestive system<br>  <br>  btw.. im not sure if potatoes, tomatoes,mushrooms, or breadballs are healthy for your bunny. google it. also they should probably have some sort of vegetable each day, not just grain.<br>  <br>  apples make a good treat for clicker training.
c54e2f5c83bf1bd09e903f2739f1d4eaaa	Unless you keep a natural saltwater setup and sterilized the wood... which in of itself is nearly impossible, I would never put beach driftwood in a tank. It could carry diseases, poisons or parasites, negatively affect the pH balance and waste ratio of your water by breaking down and spoiling your water and ultimately kill your fish.<br>  <br>  Natural things like wood and rocks may seem like a good idea, but keep in mind that while they're alright for rivers and oceans, your tank is a contained ecosystem and the smaller the system the easier it is to throw things out of whack. A small pond or river can contain the equivalent of 30 or more medium sized aquariums, and so one piece of bad driftwood won't kill the fish there, but that single piece of untreated wood has 30 times the effect in a small tank that doesn't have the benefit of constant fresh water entering while the poisoned water exits.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to bite the bullet and buy some Malaysian driftwood sold commercially.|`|IgG5PPjRaa	You definitely do not want to do that. It could have parasites and bacteria on it or inside the wood itself that could kill all of your fish. Plus even if you wash it and aid in turning it into driftwood it may still decompose further and cause a lot of damage to your water quality. Better to buy from a retailer or a private seller may be cheaper.

However, if you live outside city limits, often times you don't have to register your dog.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is look up the rules for YOUR city.

Then you can get a license. If you have a dog and no license, you might have to pay a fine, or you're given a deadline to register and show the rabies proof. Rabies is all that they care about, because it's a legal issue due to the zoonotic risk to humans.|`|rhoNcYE8aa	What's the world coming to?  We're slowly having all of our freedoms stripped away.

E5gaKzCsaa	Good idea, and start doing it now so there's no fuss when you get to the new place. Get him a crate or a pen big enough for him to stand up and turn around in but not much more, put some soft blankets in it and maybe a chew toy, even put his food bowl in it when you feed him. Drape a blanket over it too if he gets cold easily. Put him in this at night, tell him how wonderful he is when you put him there, and ignore the whining.  And I mean walk away, don't even tell him to be quiet unless he's being loud enough to bother the neighbours. Make sure he has a nice long walk, play session, or at least a decent potty break before bedtime. If he's tired he'll go to sleep faster. Don't give him water after a few hours before bedtime so he can get through the night without having to pee. This will work if you are persistent. He whines and cries because he knows that if he keeps that up, he'll get attention from you and you might even let him out. You'll have to re-train him not to expect any of that when he whines. <br>  <br>  You can also put him in the crate in the daytime, in fact, I'd recommend it. Leave him there for 10 minutes and work up to longer times, but only let him out once he's quiet. He must learn that whining won't get him out. If you do this properly, he will come to see the crate as his own personal little den. No reason you can't have a little cuddle time in bed before everyone goes to sleep, but make it clear that the dog's sleep is done in the crate.|`|VjJp8Qx0aa	buy a dog bed and put it on the floor next to your side of the bed.|`|BNKBs4Peaa	Okay, first make sure the bed is nice and cozy. Use lots of fluffy blankets and pillows. Get some of his favorite toys and place them all around the bed.

There are some for dogs you can buy that aren't too big, but big enough to move around and sleep. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped =)|`|9Hz5NekJaa	ok get him the dog bed and everytime he sleeps in it reward him with a treat this will tell him that when he sleeps in his bed he gets a treat...cover your bed with like fences but they arent fences.so your dog wont get up in your bed do this until he  understands he cant go up in ur bed...when he wines dont pay attention to him he will get tired eventually..<br>  i hope this helps
tSm7bTzRaa	To be frank, you shouldn't have gotten a ferret. This happens to nearly all of them. They are very costly animals. They are not suitable pets for someone who doesn't have a lot of money saved up for emergencies.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to take the ferret to a rescue where she can be cared for and rehomed to someone who can afford an animal that comes with the potential to be so expensive.<br>  <br>  I mean... nearly ALL ferrets get like this. Your ferret just happens to be very young. Please try to find your ferret another home with someone who can afford it; $300 saved up for emergency ferret bills is definitely not adequate at all. You need WAY more than that saved up if you want to keep a ferret!!<br>  <br>  Please give her a chance at life. If you cannot find another home (call a rescue and ask if they'd take her if you can't find a home yourself), let her live out her life until it comes time to put her down. No, you would not be a terrible person! Are nursing homes terrible places for letting the elderly live out their lives as peacefully as possible?<br>  <br>  In the future, stick with animals that are not *known* for having problems like this. Ferrets are notorious for this sort of thing. I'm sorry for being so blunt, but in getting a ferret, you were sort of asking for it. Many people spend a few thousand dollars on each ferret as far as vet bills go.<br>  <br>  Take your ferret to a university that teaches veterinary science. Many will do this surgery for a huge discount because the students are learning at the same time.|`|wDrvsdEHaa	I think that you are right. The operation costs an amazing amount of money and there's really no guarantee how long your ferret will last after it. I know it seems mean to just leave your ferret but think about the pain and recovery of the operation not to mention the cost. Your ferret will have had a good life and when the time comes to say goodbye you can be happy that you did the best that you could in the circumstances. <br>  <br>  Its really your decision but I think that euthanizing would be the kindest option.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Sorry to hear :(. I had an older rabbit that had arthritis. (I know, different from a young ferret with adrenal disease.) I continued to keep him happy and comfortable. When he stopped eating and drinking, that was almost like it was his way of letting me know it was time. As long as the ferret is eating/drinking/peeing/pooping, and even overall having a good time, I would wait to euthanize.|`|339NqJ84aa	The disease progresses slowly and these days the success rates after surgery are quite high, and the ferret has a good chance of complete recovery and a long and happy future. <br>  <br>  <br>  Treatment is usually the removal of the affected gland surgically but if the ferret is not a good candidate for an operation, then it can usually be treated with drugs.<br>  <br>  Non-surgical options<br>  Lysodren, a medication commonly given to dogs and cats with adrenal tumors, should be used only as a last resort. Dr. Williams says, "Most vets that are doing a lot of ferrets report poor response to Lysodren, and in the cases that I have seen, the results are very unpredictable." Another name for Lysodren is mitotane. <br>  Dr. Michael Dutton, DVM, DACVP says: <br>  <br>  Lysodren (by Bristol Meyers Squibb) is generically known as mitotane or o,p -DDD. It is a medication that destroys adrenal tissue. The goal of administering Lysodren is to destroy a percentage of the gland while the rest of the gland regenerates new adrenal tissue. You are trying to reduce the functional mass so less hormones/steroids can be produced (i.e., the factory is smaller for manufacturing). <br>  Disadvantages of Lysodren: 1) some ferrets become nauseous (vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, etc.), 2) does not work in some ferrets, 3) lifelong medication (since the adrenal gland regenerates), 4) lifelong expense can equal or surpass the surgery cost, 5) can cause profound hypoglycemia (not to be used in an insulinoma ferret). <br>  <br>  Advantage of Lysodren: 1) don t need to do surgery if Lysodren works <br>  <br>  Disadvantages of surgery: 1) cost, 2) higher technical skill required by veterinarian. <br>  <br>  Advantage of surgery: 1) 85-90% of the time you can CURE the ferret lifelong just by removing the left adrenal gland. <br>  <br>  Dr. Cathy Johnson-Delaney, DVM, writes: <br>  Lysodren kills off adrenal tissue period. The difference in ferret adrenocortical disease vs. dog/human is that the primary hormones secreted are usually sex steroids, instead of cortisol. However, cortisol may be slightly elevated in some ferrets as well. Lysodren seems to work better on adenomas than adenocarcinomas. There can be side effects, but various pulsing regimens can be used to minimize this. Deliver with some food seems to help as well. <br>  Lupron Depot is a synthetic GNRH agonist that blocks sex steroidogenesis. It is leuprolide acetate, utilized primarily for endometriosis and as palliative treatment to shrink prostate tissue with many kinds of prostate cancer. Although theoretically it primarily acts to interrupt the feedback system from the pituitary to the adrenal/auxillary endocrine tissue, it essentially acts to block estradiol receptors. It is for this ability that we decided to try it in my ferret, whose prostate had totally occluded his pelvic canal, making urination and defecation almost impossible (and painful). He had his left adrenal totally removed in April of 95, along with one large insulinoma. In Aug of 96 he plugged. He started Lupron in September. I am happy to say he is now 5 days past 2 years from surgery (the right adrenal was determined to be too much of a surgery risk to even try). He is 13 months on Lysodren (varying from 100 - 250 mg/week), and is 8 months on Lupron (100 mcg injection IM every 3 weeks). He will be six years and nine months on May 4, and is growing hair where none has grown for 2 years. He plays, has no problem urinating/defecating, climbs, and runs (he didn't do that for most of the time post surgery, until he started Lupron and I upped his Lysodren).

zv8QaMe1aa	If you're force feeding her, maybe she's not eating because she's not hungry.  Leave food for her, when she gets hungry enough she'll eat... if the food level doesn't go down for a couple of days, then get her checked out by the vet, she may have a health problem.|`|iuYtcX6Xaa	are you sure she is just not eating when your not looking? and right away means no more then 3-4 days! 2 weeks is way too long w/o food! did you ask the shelter if this is a problem they had? sometimes they will not tell you things like this because they want the animal to be adopted out...so they just kind of "forget" these sort of things! call the shelter and ask them if she did this before you got her!|`|VX4aaUS6aa	Cats are extremely picky eaters....and sometimes they can be perfectly healthy and just stop eating...force feeding probably isn't the best thing only because it starts to make eating a really negative thing....I had a cat who did this once and eventually we found something she liked...and it ended up being the cheapest food...we fed it to her for awhile and then transfered her back over to her healthier food..also the fact that the cat is new to your home could mean it is just trying to adjust and get used to its new surroundings...just give it time...and good luck...|`|srjPOxW7aa	try using tuna, the kind that comes in water. You don't want to feed your cat that all the time because too much mercury  is bad. but so is too much of anything : / If you find your cat likes it and will eat it, wing the cat off by putting the tuna in his/her food each time put less and less tuna. Then sometimes you may give it to your cat as a treat.|`|vLkS8Cwzaa	She's just adjusting. Stop force-feeding her at once, and tell that vet to go to he!!. That's an insane suggestion for her situation. She'll eat (she probably is eating, just not where you can see it). As long as she's drinking and using the box, she's doing what she needs to do. She just needs time to get over the trauma of adjusting to a new home.|`|ZQJfkGwJaa	Knock off the force feeding. I am surprised a vet told you to do that. Give her food in her bowl and fresh water. Unless she is very, very sick, she will eat. Cats do not commit suicide by starving themselves. She's using her box? I suspect she is eating, you just don't notice.|`|m7Nw93rFaa	maybe it is a little sad of her/his pasted it will need so time to get use to his/her living of ways|`|I0yEe9FHaa	dont keep force feeding her. leave food out, or leave the kind of food that the shelter was feeding her and just leave it by her water bowl. she might have to get use to her surroundings, you may think 2 weeks is enough but cats are sensitive just like any other animal. do you know what her background history was? it may have to do with that, also if she is hungry she will eat. if you keep force feeding her its going to make her feel more uncomfortable, and you dont want that. just keep working with her and she will eat on her own eventually.
B6zl0AJDaa	Where do you keep your horse?  In a barn or out in pasture?  What's the terrain like if he's kept in pasture, hard and rocky or soft and sandy?  If rocky, then that's where he's getting his bruises.  Why didn't your farrier suggest padding him?<br>  <br>  IF his feet are hot, then soaking them in cool/cold water will help bring down the fever.  You can also give him a couple of tabs of butte to bring down the fever.<br>  <br>  If he's foundered, it's not the end of the world depending upon how badly.  Normally shoes with pads will help and keeping off pasture and green hay (Alfalfa) and no grain of course.<br>  <br>  Your best bet though would be to call your vet and have him actually diagnosis what's wrong with him.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Check the digital pulses on his pasterns.....if you feel them bounding, you need the vet asap to begin treatment for laminitis.  Even if you don't feel the pulses, get on the phone to your vet for instructions.  In the meantime, remove his feed and get him onto a soft, heavily bedded surface, and let him lie down if he wants to....anything to get pressure off of his hooves is best.  The sooner treatment begins, the better the prognosis will be for your horse.  this should be treated as a medical emergency.|`|oHL8qA42aa	Have a vet come see him. Like you said, it could be an abscess and not likely, but possibly, founder. Is he lame when he trots?|`|EQvAbyvcaa	I presume the bruises are on his soles.  If this is true, he could have thin, and therefore sensitive soles.  Does your farrier trim his soles?  If so, this is probably the major part of the problem.  Excess heat in the feet indicate inflammation.  It could be from the injury or it could be from an episode of laminitis (which is very very painful).  Founder can only be diagnosed with x-ray and occurs after severe laminitis when the coffin bone rotates.  <br>  <br>  You need to call the vet.  You need a proper and correct diagnosis before you begin experimental treatments and the removal of food.  Is this the first time the sensitivity has occurred?  Has the horse been on unusual ground?  When did the condition begin and was there an obvious predisposing incident/changes?  How long has the horse been on the current feed/hay?  Recent changes in diet?<br>  <br>  There are a lot of things to consider, but again, find out what the problem is before you begin to try to "fix it".   I hope you are able to help your horse.|`|tWTJ4CSIaa	I would suggest putting shoes on him.  Sounds to me like he is just badly hurt in his feet.  Horses get warm spots when they are hurt sometimes.  Because the ferrier says that he was badly bruised, I would bet that he is REALLY sore in his feet and need some kind of protection like shoes.  Especially if he is outside at times on rocky ground or hard ground.<br>  <br>  Just to be sure, you should call your vet and explain what is going on and see if he thinks he should come out and look at him.|`|3bzaDhReaa	He shouldn't be getting alfalfa just good quality grass hay.  Keep his weight down.  Sometimes a barefoot trimmer can also be of help.  Get a vet to check his feet. Good luck.|`|t4yBwlr6aa	Please don't rely on these answers, consult your vet as soon as possible, the horse could need some antibiotics, or some type of shoe to help with the problem... it could be founder, an abcess, a navicular problem. PLEASE call the vet... I hope this helps and good luck hun !|`|AA11327431	If you walk him on rocks a lot, you might want to see if keeping him off them will help.  There is the possibility that the ferrier is cutting 'em too low, leaving very little room for the changes in the ground.<br>  It's possible that if you have him out on pasture that he could be stepping on fallen branches and stuff.  There are so many possibilities, so it's hard to know exactly what the problem is.  I would suggest having a vet come out to check if there's anything identifiable and obvious that could be causing it.   I have heard that too much sweet in their feed can cause issues with their hooves, and same with alfalfa.  I have heard that too much grain period could cause problems.  None of these are a guarantee, though, and I am not even certain all of those are proven or not, just what I've heard.<br>  <br>  I think the best thing to do in this situation would be to have a vet out to check, and I usually am of the mindset that I would try other things first, but if you've noticed it for awhile now and nothing seems to be fixing it you need to have a professional take a look.<br>  <br>  I am sure there are diseases and other possible things that can cause tenderness and inflammation like that as well, so have a vet out to see if there's anything he/she can suggest for you to try.
GVR9AjoQaa	1) You should keep track of when she was bred- apx 150 days from breeding to birthing.  Pregnant does will have distended abdomin, make bag 2 to 3 days before kidding.<br>  2) Many possible reasons- stress(any dogs after her?)  she well fed? Has she been sick?<br>  3) Get a copy of Storeys Guide to Raising Dairy Goats   order a catalog from Hoeggers Goat Supply (FREE  lotsa' info in the catalog)<br>  5) Did she expel (deliver) the afterbirth?  Yes another kid is possible.<br>  6) If that were my doe I would have my hand & forearm in her in the morning when I  found her- she probbably needed help then- what you think were premmies could have just been small kids!  Often they need a little help to get started- mucus sucked out of their airway with a infant aspirator, get 'em warm & dry FAST, get them on a tit ASAP.<br>  <br>  Lastly #4--- Why in the hell did you not stay with that doe?  If I understand correctly you didn't check her between "this morning" & 5:30!   If you had been there you would have probably saved those kids!
el8yX5q3aa	6 years is a long time for a goldfish.....<br>  <br>  He might be sleeping...they do that!|`|k86KdyYOaa	It's almost midnight, he might just be a tired fishy:)|`|AA11901352	6 years isn't old for a goldfish by any means.  Some fish are just bottom sitters however if he just started this behavior it could be a few things.  First off did you test the water to see what the readings were and when was your last water change?  If your fish is eating and then swims around for a while I don't think there is anything serious with your fish.<br>  <br>  I would suggest testing the water and do a water change if you have not done one this week.  Is he floating or listing to one side?  If not, I would simply keep my eye on him and see if something else developes.|`|OrvTG44laa	You're crying over a goldfish?  I know people get attached, I love my dogs, but a fish?  Seriously, how could you feel bad about a fish?  They have no emotion for you and don't bond with you.  Just buy a new one.  I mean really, who cries over a goldfish?|`|BmZFsuZCaa	erm, give him some fresh water to make him feel better? Stop feeding him! He wont get better if you overfeed him.

I would like for my kids to wake me and tell me if one of their pets was dying. My daughter had a goldfish for 6 years. She was very sad when it died. We handled it during the day. I think your parents would want you to wake them so they could help you. <br>  <br>  Maybe your fish is okay. Sometimes my daughter's fish would swim sideways at the top of the tank and I would think it was dead and start to flush it. And then it would flip its tail! We'd put it back in but clean the water and then it was fine.<br>  <br>  Is your water clean? Maybe your fish would like some clean water so he/she can get better oxygen?<br>  <br>  Good luck! I miss our fish, Cleo!|`|X6BMNCF6aa	i think your goldfish should be ok if he still swims up to eat his food but dont feed him to much and is his water clean? <br>  otherwise i think he may actaully be sleeping fish seem to rest towards the bottom still when they sleep and it is late remember they do sleep to :) <br>  so dont worry to much im sure your fish will be fine|`|30SnAm0kaa	this same thing happened to my fish.. he may be poisoned from the ammonia levels in the tank. when was the last time you did a water change? how big is the tank? what kind of filter do you use? this is all very important. does he have any markings on him like black or white spots? does he look fuzzy?<br>  <br>  i've had the same 2 goldfish for 5 years =)|`|ypJ7RctMaa	i'm sorry to say, that your lil fishy might becoming to an end of his life, 6 yrs is a long time, and i think you should pull the plug, Flushing" but din't worry, now you have a chance to get a better pet, one with a brain that hs a larger brain than a grain of sand|`|MCczXQW3aa	do you have any other fish in the tank? any little siblings that could have fed it something? is there black mold in the tank? little water? over feeding? maybe it needs a new area or something? good luck 4 ur fish.|`|s9oxIOskaa	Well that is kind of old for a fish. then again my grandparents fish lived for thirteen years.

339NqJ84aa	Maybe your being to hard in his mouth and he is not responding because you are being to harsh.|`|ypJ7RctMaa	either the bit is hurting him, or you need a stroger bit, i am not a bit expert, but i sugest you talk to a vet or a trainer, but be careful before you use a shank they are very powerful bits, and mess there mouth up for the rest of there life if your not too careful.|`|VCIdnISPaa	A lot of it depends on how well the horse is trained.  Does he respond to pressure? (leg)  How often do you ride?  Is it a gelding or a mare?  How long have you owned him?  Does he/she have your respect?  (I don't mean by beating the horse.)  <br>  <br>  I have found that older horses (19 20+) that have 'been there, done that' I could use a snaffle bit on.  One horse, would not respond to any bit I tried with her, she was 11.  I ended up using a mechanical hackamore, and never had to use it with much pressure.  My favorite horse that I road several times a week, I found a Tom Thumb was one that he responded to, again, I didn't have to use much pressure, as he learned leg pressure and wanted to please.  He was a 1300 to 1400 pound horse (big boy!).<br>  <br>  I would talk to your farrier.  He might be able to get you in touch with a good horse trainer that could give you some tips on getting into your horse's head.
wF52XMxAaa	I find it somewhat amusing that you spelled "asymmetrical" properly, but not "pecs", resulting in your question being put in the Pet->birds section.<br>  <br>  The simplest explanation is that you could be primarily using your left arm to lift with, which is easy to do on most bench machines.  If you're using free weights or a hammer machine, it's harder to explain.  Cable crossovers might help the asymmetry.  So might push-ups, if you make a point of staying perfectly level (use a mirror).  Other than that, you haven't presented enough information to say (see <br>  <a href="http://labrada.com/blog/muscle_gain_tips/using-leverage-for-upper-pecs/" rel="nofollow">http://labrada.com/blog/muscle_gain_tips...</a> for an example of a good analysis).<br>  <br>  There's a nice list of exercises at <a href="http://www.shapefit.com/training-chest.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shapefit.com/training-chest.h...</a>

QE71sNC3aa	Is someone cleaning the litter box while you're away? Cats don't like a dirty litter box.<br>  <br>  Anyway... This can happen with older cats. They're just not as sharp as when they were younger and can momentarily forget the proper way of doing things and give in to instinct.  If it's happening somewhere out in the open that you can clean reasonably easily... consider yourself lucky. Just remember all the joy the cat's brought you over the years... I wouldn't even be too hard on the cat. It might then get sneaky and start going behind furniture, etc... like my old cat started doing in it's last few years. Get yourself a Hoover Steam-Vac... lol|`|mqxjSRaCaa	put laundry dryer sheets underneath it, but make sure she can't get them and eat them or something, but they don't like the way they smell or something, i'm not completely sure, but it stopped my cat from peeing...ahha (:|`|zv8QaMe1aa	Would you want to use the same toilet for 5 days without flushing it, or would you find someplace else to go?  If you're leaving them alone for that long, it's likely a litterbox cleanliness issue.  Either get a self-cleaning litterbox, or get someone to come in while you're gone, check on them and clean up after them so that they have a clean box..... even better, do both.<br>  <br>  I travel on business as well.  I have 3 cats, 2 self-cleaning litterboxes and a neighbor who checks in on them daily for me and plays with them and spends some time with them.... without that I wouldn't leave them alone that long.|`|EVYYJ4cgaa	Cat urine is one of the most difficult stains to treat, so it's important that when you treat it, you treat it correctly and thoroughly.

Best of luck!|`|vLkS8Cwzaa	There are good answers in this thread, but DO NOT "mash her nose" into her feces. She won't have any idea why you're doing it, and will feel angry and frightened.

tnRO5gB8aa	I always use reward training, you should take the puppy out every two hours and when he does go potty outside reward him with a kind happy voice saying good dog and some love and affection afterward, introduce him to new smells that will make him want to mark and go to the bathroom, take on lots of walks, if you catch him going inside immediately make a quick loud sound with your voice and immediately take him outside always be 100 percent consistent with your sound when he goes inside and your training and rewards otherwise he can get confused, but outside every two hours is definitely key a huge must and consistency in training|`|AA10500537	keep it on a schedule  and bring it out and it will get used to it.|`|0Nnk11zLaa	Crate training - EFFECTIVE, QUICK&&EASY! A great method, but it takes lots of one-on-one, if you are a parent of young kids / very involved with school/sports/your "bf"/ just very active, you might need to give up some hobbies or call in a trainer.<br>  <br>  Buy a crate - a good one , reliable and sturdy.<br>  <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/13908/Midwe..." rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/13908/Midwe...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/108072/Pet-..." rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/108072/Pet-...</a><br>  <br>  something like that - uhm, scratch the carpeting that is. you want it big enough that he can turn around, but not so big that he has room to "go" in one corner and comfortably sleep in the other. what you do, basically, is only let him out 15 minutes to eat&&drink then put him back in the crate (this should be about 4 times a day), then maybe 20-30 minutes after he has eaten you take him outside to dispose of the food via poopoo(lol). you make sure he stays out until he goes, then pet him and tell him "GOOD JOB" for it. you can also let him out for 10 minutes inbetween just to play.<br>  keep this up, and eventually he'll know when it's time to 'potty' and if you don't come n get him, he'll bark or scratch or something to let you know that he needs to go.<br>  remember, puppies can not hold their bladder long so you must be there 100% of the time(you can't let him out while you go out to dinner w/ some friends, and leave puppy pads down as this eliminates the entire process).<br>  <br>  just be persistent, and as for the peeing because he knows it's wrong, spray him with a bottle, or give him a swat with a newspaper. don't need to hurt him, but let him know it's unacceptable. btw - dont use your hand when disciplining, as dogs are "dumb" (to a certain extent) and will associate your hand with "nono" thus associating you with bad :(<br>  <br>  <br>  best of wishes!|`|fu5NqrsPaa	When he first wakes up from any nap, take him straight outside and praise him once he does go. It may be only a 10 minute nap but its best to do it after every one. Their lil bladders dont hold very much. When i got my dog who wil be a year next month, he went outside on his own just three days after i got him and he was only 5 weeks. He would jump off the bed and run out the back door (I left my bedroom door open so he could)<br>  Hope this help and congrats on your new precious puppy. They are a true blessing
q7GBzr6yaa	Occasionally throughout the day, drop small pieces of kibble or dog biscuits in the crate. While investigating his new crate, the pup will discover edible treasures, thereby reinforcing his positive associations with the crate. You may also feed him in the crate to create the same effect. If the dog hesitates, it often works to feed him in front of the crate, then right inside the doorway and then, finally, in the back of the crate.<br>    <br>    <br>  In the beginning, praise and pet your pup when he enters. Do not try to push, pull or force the puppy into the crate. At this early stage of introduction only inducive methods are suggested. Overnight exception: You may need to place your pup in his crate and shut the door upon retiring. (In most cases, the crate should be placed next to your bed overnight. If this is not possible, the crate can be placed in the kitchen, bathroom or living room.)<br>    <br>    <br>  You may also play this enjoyable and educational game with your pup or dog: without alerting your puppy, drop a small dog biscuit into the crate. Then call your puppy and say to him, "Where's the biscuit? It's in your room." Using only a friendly, encouraging voice, direct your pup toward his crate. When the puppy discovers the treat, give enthusiastic praise. The biscuit will automatically serve as a primary reward. Your pup should be free to leave its crate at all times during this game. Later on, your puppy's toy or ball can be substituted for the treat.<br>    <br>    <br>  It is advisable first to crate your pup for short periods of time while you are home with him. In fact, crate training is best accomplished while you are in the room with your dog. Getting him used to your absence from the room in which he is crated is a good first step. This prevents an association being made with the crate and your leaving him/her alone.|`|qWPLDgPiaa	<a href="http://www.petvideo.com/play.cgi?showId=796" rel="nofollow">http://www.petvideo.com/play.cgi?showId=...</a><br>  The website above has a video of crate training a puppy.<br>  There are tons of other training videos! :)|`|M2M14eCjaa	There are alternatives and guides on how to house train your pet , at the link below , i did use them for my poodle and i can honestly tell you it was very valuable to me.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1506410/how_to_house_train_your_dog_and_achieve.html?cat=53" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>

280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	I think he's just a generic animated hound dog. There isn't actually a breed with his appearance. He has the body of a coon hound and the coloring of a Scottish Deerhound or other gray dog. Your safest bet would be to call him a hound; he's definitely a hound mutt of some sort.|`|Zxg7SfN2aa	I think he is a basset hound, but may also be a bloodhound <br>  (I havent seen that movie in awhile)
QVP8zSuWaa	More distractions, sounds, smells etc. You need to do the same training leash training outside that she obeys inside|`|Y4hYBvDbaa	Well, I guess since you moved to a different place, your dog needs to adapt to that place. Maybe he/she is just not used to being in that environment (depends if it changed or not). He/she just needs to get used to where he/she is living now.<br>  That's just my opinion. :)|`|Mw49Vjs6aa	Her new world is just full of sights, sounds and scents that are new and unique.  Also, although dogs can discriminate training incredibly well, the do not generalize nearly so handily.  That is why a dog who responds very well to cues indoors seems to ignore them while outside.  The environment is a much a cue to the behavior as is the word.  <br>  <br>  For now, you should keep her on lead while outside, and start reviewing her 'recall' training just as you did when she was a puppy.  Use lots of high-value rewards and you'll soon convince her that coming when called is much more fun that exploring whatever scent has happened to grab her by the nose.|`|34uWa9kHaa	It's because you moved and you are not in a new enviroment, new sites, sounds etc.  <br>  <br>  So put the leash back on and go over all her training that she alreadys knows.

Your little dog obviously doesn't enjoy it as much you might.  <br>  <br>  If my dog were doing that I'd be very tempted to use it as a starting point to shape a cute trick such as covering his or her ears as a human might to avoid hearing something we'd rather not.|`|zsnKf57Maa	If it looks like it hurts her ears then you should tell your husband to stop doing it.

Use it.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Baby gate?|`|Drnpe4T5aa	Put up a child-proofing gate.  They make them so that you can just pop them in and out with almost no trouble.  Then you can leave your door open.<br>  They also make a spray , but I have found it to be just as offensive to humans as to animals.  It smells pretty inoccuous when I sampled it at the pet store - but when I sprayed it on a towel to keep my cats off the couch, I found it over-powering and got a nasty headache from it.<br>  You could also try putting a couple door mats in front of your door - something really spikey and uncomfortable to walk on.  The green turf ones designed to clean the bottoms of your shoes off come to mind, as do the prickly natural brown ones.  Though these may just get hopped over.<br>  <br>  EDIT - For those unable to fathom why someone would want their bedroom door left open:  When you shut up a room for extended amounts of time, it causes the room to smell musty and stale (and it has nothing to do with hygiene), not to mention that the room will not get adequate ventilation for proper heating or cooling, causing it to be too cool or warm.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	The best thing is a baby gate. Dog stores do sell stuff, but usually its used for particular items. When it comes to dogs, not even the ceiling fan can be safe. Because you want to safe guard everything a baby gate is best. Proper training also needs to be occurring to ensure less chance of bad behaviour. Be warned, some dogs can jump it depending on their size. Good Luck!|`|I5pUxwPbaa	i dont know of any sprays, but try a barrier like a plastic baby gate that requires no installation, you can find them at any department store like walmart|`|QqEE3qgOaa	you could get a baby gate or just use something to block it like a chair or something|`|V6aH1vpQaa	A Taser.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	A GATE!<br>  duh<br>  *&*.......CRATE the beasts!|`|LzXZQBHbaa	get a baby gate to block your doorway.|`|6jNHBxZDaa	I agree use a baby gate.. does your room stink or something?
d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	there are several species that go very well with bettas, but unfortunately, your tank is too small for all but that single fish.<br>  <br>  If you upgrade to a 10 or even 20 gallon tank, you can add rasboras, white clouds, snails, cory cats, ......<br>  <br>  i keep cherry and golden barbs with one of my betas, i just watch for fin nipping.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	With only a five gallon to work with I would suggest a few African dwarf frogs.<br>  You didn't mention if the tank was heated.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	How about 2 corydoras catfish (sometimes labeled "cory cats").  They stay small and are peaceful and won't hurt the beta, and also pick up leftovers off the gravel.<br>  <br>  You want to avoid fish like tetras - they will beat the betta up.  Contrary to their image, it's more likely other fish will beat up the betta - they have those big fins that slow them down.  Agressive fish will nip all their fins off.  A neon tetra or two is probably fine, though - they're small and a more peaceful tetra.<br>  <br>  In such a tiny tank, I wouldn't add more than 1 or 2 fish that stay small (ie, don't get bigger than an inch) and you'll have to be very good about doing a water change every single week to keep them healthy.|`|wnnudNp5aa	5 gallons is pretty small to add more fish. If you had a 10-gallon, I would suggest 3 or 4 Corydora catfish. They prefer to be kept in groups of 3 or more. I have had a lot of success keeping Platies with Bettas. You could add one or two Platies to your tank, or a very small school of Neons (they need to be kept in groups of 5 or more), but that's pushing it. I have heard of people keeping ghost shrimp with Bettas, but don't do snails. I've heard horror stories of Bettas eating their antennae, while they are still alive.<br>  Don't do any female Bettas, either. If you have more than one, they must be kept in groups of 4 or more, and never with a male. <br>  For your tank, from my experience, is to buy a Platy. They come in all kinds of fun patterns and colors, and get on well with Bettas. They are also hardy, and very easy to care for. After a couple of weeks, you could possibly add one more, if your water parameters are in order. That's it, though. The rule is one inch of fish per gallon of water. <br>  If you don't have at least one book on aquariums, and specifically on Bettas, I urge you to get one. They are an invaluable resource, and can answer questions you never even thought to ask.<br>  Good luck!|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	Sorry to say, but you don't have any room for anymore fish. That betta needs a minimum of 5 gallons filtered and heated. Betta's can be territorial, so to keep them with other fish you need a minimum of 10 gallons, and even then you could only get a couple of other fish.|`|ZgGe0bNZaa	they arent many fish u can add with male bettas maybe some sort of bottom feeder like a corydora but not a pleco they go to big go to ur local pet store and ask ur tank is a little small so just add 1 or 2 more fish|`|BMri9tITaa	If his home were bigger than 5 gallons, there's a lot you could fit in there, namely corydoras, harlequin rasboras, and small tetras like neons, cardinals, and glowlights.  However, 5 gallons is awfully small, and those cramped conditions are more likely to bring out the territorial inclinations of a betta.  You can't even get a school of fish in there, which all those small fish (corys, rasboras, and tetras) need.<br>  <br>  10 gallons aren't very expensive, and you might be able to fit a small community in there.<br>  <br>  In a 5 gallon, I'd only put in a betta and maybe some invertebrae, like snails or shrimp.|`|CadIYXdXaa	Bettas will mostly only fight with other bettas, they aren't "killer" fish. I've had them for years in community tanks.<br>  <br>  Yes a bigger tank would be better 5g is pushing it when it comes to adding other fish.<br>  <br>  They key when it comes to mixing bettas and other fish is to make sure the other fish are friendly/community fish and aren't fin nippers. Also make sure they don't have long flowing fins either, as that will spark the bettas aggression.<br>  <br>  If you really want to put something in there you could try a couple of small neons or something like that, or an African Dwarf frog, they are mostly bottom dwellers (but look into their care before purchasing as they don't really like flake food etc).|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Unfortunately a five gallon tank is too small for more fish...bettas do better on their own. With their long fins, they are prime targets for fin nippers and such. Plus they can get aggressive with other colorful fish. If you had a ten gallon, you could add plates, swords or such. but a five is too small.|`|rjGVh7ksaa	Two or more female betta will not kill eachother.  If you only get one female he will chase her to death.  I've also heard fish that are small, not very brightly colored and don't have fan tails are a good option. But you'll need a bigger tank.|`|H6woERgaaa	Don't put any fish in the water with a beta!!! He will eat your other fish. That is why another word for beta fish is killer fish.|`|sSfOZmUiaa	maybe add 3 tetras and some shrimp.
5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Yes...it can be done.  Before I get to that I would just like to commend you in not showing anger and just seeing that "retraining" is necessary.  You are a wonderful granddaughter to have taken on such responsibility.  Your grandmother was blessed to have you.<br>  Here goes: <br>  I put a harness on them, leash them with a retractable leash and stick the handle in my pocket. Scolding loudly or even too sternly can bring on confusion more than understanding.  Wherever I go they go...even when I have to go to the bathroom...or if someone else in the family is home they tuck the handle of the leash into their pocket.  This brings trust...you become a leader they can trust.  It also helps you to be able to “read” her signals.  Sometimes it is just a squat, sometimes they turn, other times they simply look up quickly then squat.  Amid the squat, take him/her out and talk sweetly saying, “go po-T outside” repeat it until you are outside.  Keep him/her on the leash so he/she does not lose his/her train of thought.  Keep repeating the command as if you are saying “don’t the flowers smell sweet today”...so it becomes a pleasant thing for him/her to hear thus he/she will be more likely to listen and learn.  If he/she poos inside accidental keep him/her near you and pick it up with a paper towel.  Squat down slowly and show it to him/her and say “go po-T outside”.  Then take him/her out with you to put it in “his/her spot”.  Do not give him/her the entire yard to go in until he/she has potty training down pat.  Let his/her collection stay for a few days so he/she gets that he/she has a designated area.  A lot of times they will continue to go in that area for a lifetime and it makes cleaning up a lot easier...no hunting.  After he/she goes outside kneel down and pet him/her saying all the “good po-T outside” ‘s that you can stand.  Over exaggerate your happiness. You can then hug him/her, rub his/her belly, clap softly when he/she finishes.  Remember to keep a cool head...don’t show anger or frustration because they will not respond positively to that.  You can do this...remember it takes time and consistency as well as love.  I am sure you will do a great job!|`|AA11244754	treat him like he's a puppy if you are sure that thats more the problem other than just his age showing itself, remember since he's a senior dog he could just have a weak bladder..|`|iVwr15K5aa	about every 1 1/2 hours take him out if he goes tell him good boy and give him  a treat. if he does`int take him out in 15 to 45 minutes. if he goes in the house put him in his pen or travel bed for about 15 minutes then take him out again. if that does`int help rub his nose in it.

He may be letting you know that this is HIS house.  It could also be from age.  It's not uncommon for dogs to get a weak bladder as they age.  Have you have him checked for bladder infection?<br>  <br>  If he checks out fine, just keep housetraining him.  Being that he is older, it can be a little more difficult, but don't give up.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	It sounds to me like you may be dealing with more than just housbreaking.  Your dog may be marking his territory, as well (that is more related to dominance.)<br>  Is he neutered?

And if you still can not afford it then i would recommend Aspen bedding ( NOT Pine or Cedar) They are Toxic to the guinea pigs..<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hamster lover?|`|7TKI0i4zaa	I have always used carefresh although a little pricey<br>  I like that it controls odors very well<br>  and it's soft <br>  they love it until it gets dirty<br>  I wouldn't trust my piggies with anything else|`|3sB49YNnaa	Care fresh is fine but expensive.  Sawdust is not!  Wood shavings (pine or aspen but not ceder) are a lot cheaper than care fresh but a bit messier.  If you do use shavings, get the ones that are not dusty like saw dust (hard on the nose) nor really big like they sell for horse stalls (not absorbent).  You are looking for a nice medium curl.<br>  <br>  If he can't stand on hay, try putting the hay in a rack on the outside of the cage that lets him pull it in as he needs it. This link shows what they look like.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kwcages.com/KWCage/00034.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kwcages.com/KWCage/00034.html</a>  <br>  <br>  When you take him outside, be sure that the cage is secure from predators, dogs and cats and is protected from the sun.<br>  <br>  If his foot problem is bumble foot, there is some evidence that Staphylococcus may be involved and some (but not all) cases respond to antibiotics|`|YFTZM86maa	Most newspapers use vegetable dyes and is safe, but you should check about that if you want to use some.  Newspaper is a decent lining for other bedding, but it doesn't help with absorption or odor much.  I use Carefresh.  A large bag is about $20 and lasts one pig in a large cage a month for me.  I scoop out wet spots daily and clean the entire cage weekly.  The bag size is deceptive as it's very compacted.  Hay and straw should never be used as a bedding!  First, it's expensive unless you buy it in bales from a farmer.  Second, they are going to urinate on it and then want to eat it...not good!  Food is NOT a bedding, and bedding should not be a food, so keep hay high and dry.  It sounds like your pigs are in Smoke sort of hutch when outside.  This may be a total long shot, but what about using sod as a bottom?  It would certainly need some thought and plans and couldn't be used directly on top of wood, but who knows.<br>  My pig also has toe and foot issues, but he runs and plays on his Carefresh all the time.
Nuh3T1cDaa	Sometimes it stinks to be a kid.  The only thing I know of is to ask if there is anything you can do to show that you are responsible.  Sit down with your grandmother and tell her that you want to have a serious talk.  Ask serious questions, don't interrupt and see what she says.  I'm guessing that she just doesn't want a ferret around.  There probably isn't much you can do but wait to grow up.|`|urBdHRRVaa	Not very fair, no. Condescending, actually.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	you are a kid... you are not responsible enough to care for the dogs and cats that you already have. Why would you want to put you nana in a situation where she has to care for another animal. Do you have the money to care for this ferret? or is nana going to buy the cage, food , litter, and all supplies. I think she is being fair to you and you should start caring for the dogs and cats more and show your nana that you are a responsible caring kid and you can handle a ferret later. By the time you do all that you wont want a ferret. You are a kid you will change your mind every 3 months. Next month you probably will ask us how to get your nana to buy you a elephant..<br>  <br>  she only told you she would buy you a rabbit to shut you up... thats a ploy most parents and nanas give to get the kids to be quiet.
6SeWCfUfaa	It's unreasonable to expect any pup to be fully house trained until they are 16 weeks old.  They just can't always hold it that long.  Some of the smarter breeds will catch on a little faster and some breeds ... we'll they're a little slower on the uptake and it can take over a year or more for them to "get it."<br>  <br>  He'll catch on quicker and learn to go for you faster if you add some play into the routine.  Praising him for going outside is good, but if he knows there's some special one on one playtime with YOU after he goes, he'll start getting outside and getting right down to business so he can get to playtime faster.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you use a command with it, I use "go potty."  Start of by using it as he's doing the deed.  It's sort of a "go potty good dog, good potty" that you want to tell him while he's going.  Do this enough, and then you'll have a dog like mine who will, go on command.  Which is really nice when it's cold out and you want the dog to finish their job quick so everyone can go back in.<br>  <br>  Keep at it, don't get discouraged.  Expect that around 8 months or so, when the teenage hormones start to kick in, that the dog might regress a tad and ... have fun with it!<br>  <br>  (oh and a dog can't be considered 100% until they're a year old??  Hogwash.  Depends on the breed, but my Aussies and BC's are easily 100% LONG before that.  The Aussie I have right how, I got at 16 weeks and he's had exactly two accidents in the house EVER.  One the very first day I had him and the second the next morning, but right by door.  But not all breeds are that smart.)|`|stCyrS4Eaa	It sounds like you are doing a great job!<br>  <br>  Puppies learn new skills at different rates. It will take time for your puppy to develop a firm understanding of where it's acceptable to potty and where it is not. It will take time for your pup to consistently understand that all of the house is the den, an area not to be soiled. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogownersdigest.com/news/library/puppy-potty-training.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogownersdigest.com/news/libr...</a><br>  <br>  Puppies need to relieve themselves frequently, sometimes as often as once an hour. There will be many accidents, especially at first. Keep up the good work! Consistency is the key!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I've had our puppy for almost 2 weeks (she's 10 weeks old) and we are doing the same thing.  Its the right way to house train!  She's really got the hang of it now.  Haven't had an accident in several days.  The thing is, just because they are doing what they are suppose to be doing with the training doesn't mean that you can stop training them.  Their bladders are small and they still need to be taken out regularly. Keep it up.  At around 14 weeks or so, they are able to hold their bladders and bowels longer and you won't have to keep quite as close an eye on them.  Even then though, you'll still have to take him out regularly.  Especially after meals.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	You are doing the right things, so providing you keep up this routine often and get the puppy into a routine, it should not take too long, but each puppy is an individual and each may take more or less time than even a litter mate :-)<br>  <br>  Enjoy your puppy and good luck.|`|cI19nesraa	By six months your puppy should be able to let you know when he needs to go out.  That is my criteria for fully house broken.  By that age also his bladder is bigger and he can go longer without needing to pee.  Be sure you have taught him a signal for when he needs to go out that you can both see and hear so if he needs to go in the middle of the night because he gets ill he can wake you. <br>  <br>   I think you are doing all the right things now and I would only add that you should teach him to only use one area of the yard for his duty.  Give him a cue like "go here" or "thats a good spot" and you will also be able to get him to go when and where you need him to if you are traveling.|`|asp4DaiHaa	first of all shouting " NO !" will do NOTHING but break your relationship w/ your puupy and make him insecure. you really should just pick him up and say nothing ( silly i know but it works) <br>  and how long depends on your consistancy. and your pup is only 9 weeks..HE KNOWS NO BETTER ! hes a toddler in dog yrs...just like in humans you cant expect a 2 yr old to be fully potty trained, can you ? NO. be patient and remember consistancy is KEY. you really should take him outside after eating playing drinking naps and as soon after any visitors come and after play.|`|vIYGV1C7aa	It all depends on the dog.  I've had some take longer, while I had others that seemed to train me on when they need to go out.  It sounds like you are on the right track, so just keep being consistent and it will happen soon enough.|`|s76aC4G8aa	1 year.  A dog is not 100% reliable in the house until a year old.<br>  <br>  Granted accidents will be fewer and far between but expect accidents up to a year old.|`|HgMFrllLaa	Great Job!!! But unfortunately just as per Weimarener above.|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	Congratulations! You are the first person who is not talking about a crate and who is doing everything right. It will only be a few weeks.

9kceDOTraa	Skills needs a little education here.  To even intelligently consider this question, the tank size, gender and overall size of the species is what factors in.  To me, I don't really think too deeply about these things, since one, if I thought something like this would possibly occur, I wouldn't group them together in the first place, and two, you have to as well consider that in their natural habitat, any one of these fish would have an incredibly large amount of space in which to work with, and should one find itself losing a fight, it has a place to escape to.  No where you can go in a closed enviroment like a tank.<br>  <br>  You listed the stock that you have some of these already and are considering adding the Jag.  Just what size tank are these all in?  You should consider these are all some rather large growing South Americans, and even if these are small now, when they are full grown, you couldn't possibly hope to keep this grouping in anything under 200 gallons and think this tank is going to be just fine.  You're packing in large, aggressive rule the tank types of fish, and something will have to give.<br>  <br>  All factors being equal among the things you listed, you trap them in a tank, force them to fight, I'd probably agree with Potts, the Jag should emerge the last fish in that group, and that's saying quite a bit.  A JD and a Red Devil are some mean tough fish.|`|KAX0HCfTaa	There are many factors that will attribute the winner between these three fish.  The aggressiveness, it's bite, it's size, strength, and experience. <br>  <br>  For example all the 3 fish may be the same size but one might have a bigger mouth with a fiercer bite.  <br>  <br>  If they were all different sizes you can bet the little guy would automatically lose but if the smaller fish was more aggressive you might just see an upset.<br>  <br>  So there is no real way of telling who is going to lose every time.  You'll just have to throw them in the tank to see who gains territory.|`|IFEIP5Doaa	Out of the three the jacks are the least aggressive. Jags will usually fight against anything even if it is larger, as will the red devil. But I have found jags as just a bit more aggressive|`|rrLHU6ehaa	Probably the jaguar, unless there's a large difference in size.|`|iVgtoyw8aa	JAGUAR!|`|SOxdyWQOaa	jaguar cichlid
6MQsUhHLaa	yes, if your friends father will not listen to your wishes tak the dog away. human food is not nutrisionaly good for dogs.<br>  <br>  dose the pug wear a collar with tags on it? some small dogs are afraid of the mettle clanking noise they make when they bump the bowl. if so, remove the collar for meals and you'll need to work with the pug to reasure it that their's nothing to fear.|`|tX27e0UFaa	I have read a lot of books about dogs and know them, when they dont eat there is a problem. He is unsure of the food and whoever is hand feeding him is an idiot. He was accustomed to his mother giving him the food from her and now that the dad has done this by hand feeding him thats what he thinks he has to do. The dog will never learn. You need to make this very clear to the dad that its not healthy for him to be doing this, Its very bad to have a dog not excited for food. This man doesnt know how to train or take care of a dog. Dogs are just liek kids. If I were fed everyday I wouldnt know how to eat either. If you just put a kibble in your hand and let him eat it then put the rest in the bowl he should go for them. take your time and repeat|`|AoSeHXeQaa	If some giant kept grabbing you and forcing food into your mouth, how would you feel about food?<br>  <br>  I think its obvious you need to remove the dog from that situation.<br>  <br>  Also, I would only feed him twice a day, and if he is not hungry, put the food up until the next feeding.  Walking might help his appetite.|`|hHAdA9V9aa	Forcing it down hi will only make him more scared and frightened in the long term.<br>  <br>  I would consult your vet. The bill maybe expensive for a quick check but in the long run it may just do the trick - the vet will make sure he hasn't got anything stuck in his throat or bad teeth/ulcers which may put him off eating and other possible causes of this behaviour in the past - is it possible he may have anything lodged in his stomache or intestines?<br>  <br>  If you can find nothing physically wrong I suggest you make food fun. "What the hell?!" you may think but if you were feeding a toddler the first thing you would do is do the choo choo train going to station Mouth or the airplane landing right in the babies mouth.<br>  <br>  I would play with him with food and maybe his favourite toys and the food won't be so scary after a while. Start trying to play with him a little bit each day and increase the amount each day by a few minutes slowly. Also, once he is eating start feeding him over the bowl and closer and closer to it until you're only swishing it round with your finger (I hope you feed him dry food! =P)<br>  <br>  Another way we get our dogs to eat is to mix meat in with the dry food so to get to the meat they've got to eat some of the food but this is a trick you should save for a bit later once he's eating out the bowl.<br>  <br>  It's important that this feeding habits are kept constant. That means you must either talk your bf's dad in to play feeding him patiently or finding a way around it like coming home to feed him at lunch and making sure you geet up earlier on a morning to make sure he gets his feed. Routine can be just as important for dogs as babies.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, he'll start gaining weight with a little encouragement.
d4883a7276992a3ca7a277be538a52acaa	If he is not neutered the best thing to do is have him neutered as this eliminates spraying or marking in the majority of dogs.<br>  <br>  It's especially bad that he is marking the baby's room and could pose a potential health risk to your child.<br>  <br>  Another solution If possible is to make the baby's room unavailable to the dog so that he may not enter at all times.<br>  <br>  Verbal scolding can be difficult if you don't catch the dog in the act but when you do tell him in a stern voice 'No! Bad Dog!' <br>  <br>  Dogs can pick up on tones of voice and he may learn that this is unacceptable behavior by such commands. <br>  <br>  Another approach is the belly band, which is essentially a wrap the dog wears so that when he goes to spray the liner in the band will absorb his mess instead of him spraying walls toys furniture and whatever else These are quite often not only affordable but washable as well. <br>  <br>  See URL:<br>  <a href="http://www.petexpertise.com/dog-training-aids/belly-band-for-boy-dogs.html?sef_rewrite=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.petexpertise.com/dog-training...</a><br>  <br>  Another idea is to make yourself a Shaker Bottle or Shaker Can.<br>  <br>  A shaker can is simply an empty cola can with a several coins inside it. The opening is taped over to prevent the coins flying out. It makes a lot of noise when you shake it up and down.<br>  <br>  A shaker bottle is a plastic bottle with some small pebbles or coins placed inside.<br>  <br>  Watch your dog for any signs (such as sniffing and circling) that he is even thinking about marking. The moment he begins to lift his leg shake the can once only to get his attention. The loud noise should startle him and interrupt what he is doing. As he looks towards where the noise has come from. Give him the command in a stern voice 'NO PEE'. Sometimes throwing the can in his general direction works well too but be careful not to hit him with it as you only want to startle him not harm him.|`|2349afcbac4c3a4a0dce26e0d170e44faa	sounds like he is the pack leader until someone else becomes the leader, like you. New baby and he marks to let others know to stay away. You should not punish at all but you have to watch him constantly so that can catch him in the act and then give a loud stern "NO!" but don't use his name. Then take him outdoors right away on a leash and walk him for an hour. Keep him right at your side and not ahead of you. Let him mark outside but he can never walk ahead of you. You are then becoming the leader and he doesn't mind. Also do not let him be distracted by anything, he should only be waiting for your cue|`|MC3C17F7aa	try  making a scedual that marks when your puppy needs to go poddy, perphaps 3 times a day ex. 9:00am, 2:00pm, 6:00pm and right before bedtime. keep repeating it untill your dog finnaly starts running up to the door(to go poddy) around the time that you usually take him/her<br>  hope this helps!

L1EccMeZaa	There is so much to learn when your cat because diabetic, I know, I've been there. It will seem very overwhelming at first, but believe me, it gets so much easier once you get into the routine. Diabetes is 100% treatable with no loss of life span. Your kitty might have some bad days, but so do diabetic humans. <br>  <br>  One thing that's important is diet change. Cut out all dry food from your cat's diet, it's most likely the reason she became diabetic. Your cat could become diet-controlled, (without insulin,) but usually the cat will have to be on insulin for a while first. I feed my cat only certain brands of Fancy Feast, no gravy, no wheat gluten, and no more than 10% carbs.<br>  <br>  I'm glad you're not thinking about putting your cat down. Some people actually do because they just don't want to deal with the disease and it's expenses, which I think is very selfish. Of course, there are cases where the cat may be severely DKA ( <a href="http://www.petplace.com/cats/diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka-in-cats/page1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/cats/diabetic-ke...</a> ) and suffering terribly, but even then a cat can usually be treated and become better. That's obviously not the case with your cat, but I would suggest you get a glucometer and start testing her at home to make sure she's not rising too much. You don't want her to develop ketones which happens if the blood sugar is too high and doesn't drop by itself. For more information about ketones, look here: <a href="http://www.felinediabetes.com/ketones.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinediabetes.com/ketones.ht...</a><br>  <br>  For giving shots, I tent the skin usually on his side by his stomach since I can grab more fat there. Just pull the skin up and stick the needle in the little tent that it makes. Your cat shouldn't feel anything if you do it right. Hold the needle like a pencil, not totally horizontal, as you might poke through the skin to the other side. Your vet can show you exactly how to do it.<br>  <br>  As for how your cat's life is going to be, I can't tell you that because, like people, cats are individuals. I can tell you how my cat's life is like. He's exactly the same as he was before the disease, maybe, if anything, more affectionate. Even when I stick him with needles, or prick his ear with a lancet, he has never resented me because he knows that I love him, and I'm just trying to help him feel better. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|DtkLsetkaa	I don't know the answer to your question, but I just wanted to say to just ignore the nasty trolls on here.  They add nothing of value and its obvious which ones they are.  I have starred your question so hopefully some of my knowledgeable contacts see this, since I think half the TCs from cats are on my contact list lol.  Good luck to you and your fuzzy furry friend!!!|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Hi<br>   Please read my profile. Diabetes is not a death sentence no life span lost and your cat can live a long healthy happy life. Once you learn, it is easy and very treatable.  Unfortunately many vets are not up to date with the correct treatment of this and you have to be proactive.<br>    You do not want to feed the vet's diet of MD or DM. You want to feed low carb canned food with no gravy.<br>   If you write me, I will work with you every step of the way|`|iTZHWx5Vaa	Probably you'll have to check her blood sugar regularly.  Monitor what she eats.  Personally, I believe the diet should stop though.  Did you know that vets get very little (if any) education about dog and cat nutrition?  The main brands that offer prescription diets (Purina, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin) have HORRIBLE ingredients.  Read this article:   <a href="http://www.tailblazerspets.com/tailblazers_articles16.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tailblazerspets.com/tailblaze...</a><br>  <br>  I have a few recommendations, however.  Dry cat food has more carbohydrates, which means your cat's blood sugar is upped when she eats it.  Dry food is one of the main reasons for health problems in cats.  Urinary tract infections, urine/bladder crystals, kidney disease, and, yes, diabetes, are all linked to feeding cats dry food.  So switch kitty to a wet food diet, and of a HIGH quality.  Solid Gold, Wilderness, Innova EVO, Wellness, Merrick, Wysong, Felidae, and Natural Balance, Flint River, and California Naturals are all brands I recommend.  Search on the web for info about them.<br>  <br>  Maybe give the insulin while she's eating so she doesn't notice it.  Your cat will live a long time with insulin and a quality diet.  Best to your cat.|`|LyWke4rCaa	I have a diabetic cat.  He's definitly not the same guy he was before the disease, but we live with his constant appetite, voracious thirst and twice daily injections.  I would never think of putting him down, even though he can be somewhat challenging.  <br>  <br>  It sounds as if you have caught the diabetes early, before your kitty became very sick with it.  We let Claude go for quite awhile, not recognizing the symptoms.  He almost died. <br>  <br>  I think, in your situation, the changes will be much more subtle.  We probably have worst case scenario cat whereas yours will be manageable.  <br>  <br>  Don't fret about giving the shots.  It's really easy and becomes second nature.  We give Claude his while he eats and he doesn't even seem to notice.  It can tie you down if you want to travel.  Plan to either take the cat along (kind of a pain in our case) or find a reliable person to take over for you if you have to leave town.  <br>  <br>  Hope that is helpful!!|`|UNFxjNHkaa	I dont know much about diabetic cats but i found these websites for you.  I think the first and fourth websites will be the most helpful:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catdiabetes.net/insulin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catdiabetes.net/insulin.htm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.felinediabetes.com/newdiag.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinediabetes.com/newdiag.ht...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bddiabetes.com/US/main.aspx?cat=1&id=383" rel="nofollow">http://www.bddiabetes.com/US/main.aspx?c...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.frederickcatvet.com/diabetes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.frederickcatvet.com/diabetes....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  All 4 websites include a section on insulin injections<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldnt be more helpful - good luck to you and your little friend<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  OH!  I also wanted to add - that 'catgirl' is a very young girl.  So she really shouldn't be answering serious questions about animals that take some experience and some knowledge to answer.  If you go to her page and look at her Q & A you'll see what i mean.  I really dont think she actually knows what she's saying...
WNsjy5oFaa	she's still really young, boxers dont fully mature until they are around 2 yrs old anyway - as long as she is gaining weight and healthy otherwise i wouldn't worry too much, also pups shouldn't be over exercised until they are fully grown as it does cause and/or aggravate problems with the growth plates<br>  <br>  speak to your vet and take their advise - or your breeder as they should know how their previous and your dogs litter mates are getting on
