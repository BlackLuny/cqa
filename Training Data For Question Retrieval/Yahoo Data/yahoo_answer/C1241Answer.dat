bHPB2CuUaa	Jeez - it depends on where the receptor is. There are a lot of types of dopamine receptors, D2a, D2b, etc. If the receptor is an autoreceptor, located on the presynaptic terminal, it provides negative feedback as to the amount of dopamine released, and blocking it might increase dopamine synthesis, since the releasing terminals will not detect that they are releasing enough. On the other hand, if the receptor is post-synaptic and not on a dopamine cell, any feedback would have to be via a multicellular neuronal feedback, which could be positive or negative, I would think. Dopamine antagonist drugs are probably targeted at postsynaptic receptors, which would have the effect of reducing dopaminergic transmission in schizophrenics. And the effect is blocking the receptor, not decreasing transmission by reducing dopamine production. But different drugs target different types of dopamine receptors, which have idiosyncratic distributions. I think most clinical drugs are found empirically, guided by the fact that they somehow do affect dopamine transmission.

Ftkr9jqYaa	a. American Revolution:<br>  How did General Amherst spread smallpox to the Native Americans?<br>  <br>  Jeffrey Amherst's name became tarnished by stories of smallpox-infected blankets used as germ warfare against American Indians. These stories are reported, for example, in Carl Waldman's Atlas of the North American Indian. Waldman writes, in reference to a siege of Fort Pitt (Pittsburgh) by Chief Pontiac's forces during the summer of 1763:<br>  <br>  "... Captain Simeon Ecuyer had bought time by sending smallpox-infected blankets and handkerchiefs to the Indians surrounding the fort -- an early example of biological warfare -- which started an epidemic among them. Amherst himself had encouraged this tactic in a letter to Ecuyer.<br>  <br>  Some people have doubted these stories; other people, believing the stories, nevertheless assert that the infected blankets were not intentionally distributed to the Indians, or that Lord Jeff himself is not to blame for the germ warfare tactic.<br>  <br>  b. Soviet "Superbugs"<br>  According to Vladimir Pasechnik, what had the Soviets developed?<br>  <br>  In 1979, a rare outbreak of anthrax disease in the city of Sverdlovsk killed nearly 70 people. The Soviet government publicly blamed contaminated meat, but U.S. intelligence sources suspected the outbreak was linked to secret weapons work at a nearby army lab. <br>  <br>  In 1992, Russia allowed a U.S. team to visit Sverdlovsk. The team's investigation turned up telltale evidence in the lungs of victims that many died from inhalation anthrax, likely caused by the accidental release of aerosolized anthrax spores from the military base. Given the hundreds of tons of anthrax the Sverdlovsk facility could produce, the release of just a small amount of spores was fortunate.<br>  <br>  News of the immensity of the Soviets' biological weapons program began to reach the West in 1989, when biologist Vladimir Pasechnik defected to Britain. The stories he told—of genetically altered "superplague," antibiotic-resistant anthrax, and long-range missiles designed to spread disease—were confirmed by later defectors like Ken Alibek and Sergei Popov. <br>  <br>  What happened to Soviet Scientists when the Cold War ended?<br>  <br>  The Soviet program was spread over dozens of facilities and involved tens of thousands of specialists. In the late 1980s and 1990s, many of these scientists became free agents—with dangerous knowledge for sale.

If you go to college you can hopefully knock out most of your maths within your first two years, but after school you will never need it unless you pursue a job in it. However, it seems like since you are wondering when you will ever use it you probably don't get very much of it and would not be interested in pursuing a career in that. I did not understand algebra very well either. I was good in all the maths until it and then statistics after it.|`|eZrK3Jhzaa	i can see why you question needing to know how to graph, but trust me, you'll need algebra. it comes up constantly in everyday life.<br>  and if you have trouble with the graphing part, ask your teacher to teach your class the graphing game. its a simple game that simplifies graphing and helps enormously. im fairly positive that your teacher will know it.<br>  i know for a fact that its been used in teacher workshops through out the country|`|qAGeCYVlaa	The colleges like it.|`|yF8XTNToaa	Your usage of algebra and mathematics in general will depend on your choice of career later on. Being able to understand how one thing relates to another and represent it graphically( how x relates to y, how time relates to a particle's position, or how your satisfaction relates to how much TV you watch, the list goes on) will probably be important to understand no matter what career you go into. <br>  <br>  I know exactly where you're coming from. I HATED math in high school because I didn't fully understand it. I would ask teachers the same question you just asked. The problem was that none of them either could answer or wanted to take the time to answer this question for me and what a shame. <br>  <br>  I came to appreciate math later in life, pursued a career where I use it everyday and love it. I would urge you to seek out a good tutor or someone who could help you to not only understand but also appreciate all that math can represent and tell you about our world.

Another way to take this tapeworm in is through the feces. Tapeworms' bodies are composed of segments, called proglottids. The farther these proglottids are from the head (the scolex), the more mature they are (i.e. the more mature sexually). The ones farthest away from the head are gravid, meaning they are filled with fertilized eggs. Mature or gravid proglottids are released from the tapeworm and leave the host in its feces. If you come in contact with the feces, you might take in the larva. The larva then mature and reproduce to form more tapeworms. Some symptoms of having pork tapeworm are:<br>  Nausea <br>  Weakness <br>  Loss of appetite <br>  Abdominal pain <br>  Diarrhea <br>  Weight loss and inadequate absorption of nutrients from food <br>  Fever <br>  Cystic masses or lumps <br>  Allergic reactions to the larvae <br>  Bacterial infections <br>  Neurological symptoms or seizures if the brain is involved<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

Two of them are on the outside of the DNA ladder (sugar and phosphate) and the other sticks out toward the middle, this is the base. There are 4 bases in DNA, A T C and G. A base from one side of the ladder matches up with a base from the other side and forms the "step" on the DNA ladder.

Acmon also has smaller underside spots and a white, even uncheckered wing fringe. A number of different subspecies have been assigned to our populations (Layberry et al, 1998, Guppy & Shepard 2001), But Norbert Kondla remarks that "Alberta Butterflies" purposely did not assign a subspecies because Alberta populations do not look like others, so it is best to not use a subspecies name until this matter is resolved. Balint & Johnson (1997) and Gorbunov (2001) provide alternative interpretations of the generic placement of acmon. To add to the taxonomic confusion of this group, Scott (1998) provides evidence that our populations are actually lupini (Boisduval), not acmon; So the butterfly known as Icaricia acmon as recently as 1998 may eventually be referred to as Aricia lupini!<br>  <br>  life history<br>  There are no data available on immature stages for Canadian populations.

Ftkr9jqYaa	Many protists can cause serious illness and disease. Malaria, for example, is caused by the protist Plasmodium. Plasmodia are sporozoans and are transferred from person to person through female Anopheles mosquitoes. People who suffer from malaria experience symptoms such as shivering, sweating, high fevers, and delirium. African sleeping sickness, also known as African trypanosomiasis, is caused by another sporozoan, Trypanosoma. Trypanosoma is transmitted through the African tsetse fly. This organism causes high fever and swollen lymph nodes. Eventually the protist makes its way into the victim's brain, where it causes a feeling of uncontrollable fatigue. Giardiasis is another example of a disease caused by a protist. This illness is caused by Giardia, a sporozoan carried by muskrats and beavers. Giardiasis is characterized by fatigue, cramps, diarrhea, and weight loss. Amoebic dysentery occurs when a certain amoeba, Entamoeba histolytica, infects the large intestine of humans. It is spread through infected food and water. This organism causes bleeding, diarrhea, vomiting, and sometimes death.

Ivib7aVZaa	Currently, it's not possible to transplant brains (or at least, not until my monster is completed!  Muahahaha!).  Okay okay, all jokes aside, if you were to transfer brains, the taste buds, themselves would not change; however, the neural inputs to the brain from those taste buds via cranial nerves (7 for example) would likely require adjustment to maintain the "original" sensation of taste that the incoming brain is used to.<br>  <br>  Couple that with the memories that any given taste elicits and the comparisons that we all make when we taste something (e.g., "wow, that's the best tasting lobster I've had yet!"), the ultimate perception of taste would, in fact, be different if you swapped brains, and would likely require an adjustment period for the incoming brain to adapt to the slightly different sensations and taste bud distribution in the new body.<br>  <br>  Short answer:  their taste buds wouldn't change any more than they normally would, but the new brain would change to accommodate the new "wiring" of the new body's taste bud system.<br>  <br>  All speculation, but fun to think about. =)|`|WRyHOEjSaa	Generally speaking, the thinking "person" is in the brain. So someone can't get a new brain because the brain defines the "someone". If you put a new brain into a different body, that would be someone getting a new body.

Ftkr9jqYaa	A mutation at the recognition site for an enzyme is likely to change one of the key amino acids at the site where a protein substrate binds prior to the occurrence of chemical reaction catalyzed by the enzyme.<br>  <br>  A point mutation's effect may be any of the following:<br>  <br>  (A) Silent.  The same amino acid is generated, although the DNA sequence has one changed nucleotide.<br>  <br>  (B) Missense. A different amino acid is produced.  However, there may be one of three effects of a missense mutation:<br>  <br>  (1) Reduction or loss of enzymatic function.<br>  (2) No or negligible change in enzymatic function.<br>  (3) Increase in enzymatic function.<br>  <br>  The last-mentioned mutation, (3), may result in increased fitness or survivability, in which case the mutation has a positive outcome.  The first mention, (1), is likely to reduce fitness, and may be lethal.<br>  <br>  (C) Nonsense.  The mutated DNA sequence codes for a stop and can truncate the protein.  Such a mutation usually dramatically reduces fitness, and may be lethal.<br>  <br>  There are also many larger-scale mutations, such as insertions, deletions, and chromosomal changes.<br>  <br>  The effects of mutations may be categorized as follows:<br>  <br>  (1) Loss-of-function mutations are the result of gene product having less or no function. When the allele has a complete loss of function (null allele) it is often called an amorphic mutation. Phenotypes associated with such mutations are most often recessive.<br>  <br>  (2) Gain-of-function mutations change the gene product such that it gains a new and abnormal function. These mutations usually have dominant phenotypes. Often called a neomorphic mutation.<br>  <br>  (3) Dominant negative mutations (also called antimorphic mutations) have an altered gene product that acts antagonistically to the wild-type allele. These mutations usually result in an altered molecular function (often inactive) and are characterised by a dominant or semi-dominant phenotype.<br>  <br>  (4) Lethal mutations are mutations that lead to the death of the organisms which carry the mutations.<br>  <br>  (5) A back mutation or reversion is a point mutation that restores the original sequence and hence the original phenotype.

F4gVAPlGaa	well...<br>  <br>  assume <br>  x = # of AM ads<br>  y = # of PM ads<br>  <br>  the function you are trying to minimize is total cost:<br>  200x + 50y<br>  <br>  your constraints are should be "greater/less than or equal" signs not just < or >:<br>  <br>  9000x + 30000y > 720000 (listener constraint) <br>  x + y < 20  (ad constraint)<br>  x > y  (AM greater than or equal to PM)<br>  <br>  Plot these three inequalities on a graph...you should get a shape on the graph where the three inequalities agree.  At the corners of this shape...is where maximum and minimum costs will occur.  One problem I am having with this problem is...if one could run 20 ads all in the PM...one would get 30000*20 = 600,000...this is < 720,000.  So with the info you have given, there is no solution I think.
gM8GCbyRaa	I also need to know this. Is it (x+1)/(x-1) or without parenthesis. Because that changes the problem entirely.<br>  <br>  If it is without parenthesis this is how to do it. (x+(1/x)-1) times (1+(1/x)+1). Just take and multiply the x through first, then the 1/x and then the -1. Like this x*1+x*(1/x)+x*1+1/x*1+(1/x)*(1/x)<br>  +1/x+(-1)*1+(-1)*(1/x)+(-1)*1. Simplifying we get x+1+x+(1/x)+(1/(x^2))+(1/x)-1-(1/x)-1. <br>  Simplifying again (by canceling and collecting like terms) <br>  2x-1+2/x+1/(x^2). Then you have to find a common denominator, which is x^2 in this case. So now <br>  (2x*x^2)/x^2-((1*x^2)/x^2)<br>  +(2*x)/x^2+1/x^2. <br>  Then add them now since they have the same denominator. So it's now <br>  (2x^3-x^2+2x+1)/x^2<br>  If you want to go on any farther you factor the top, by grouping.

Evolution exists, but it's not "Natural Selection," it's actually, "God's Selection."  When a person views the changes in animals and plant fossils over time, you'd have to be blind not to see how one species slowly diversifies and changes into one or more other similar species, which then continues to do the same.  Yet, humans and the rest of the animals and plants found in nature would not be present if it wasn't for Him guiding their evolution.  God created all things, but through evolution rather than instantly creating and placing all animals and plants onto the earth as they are now.  For those who doubt me, I have all kinds of proof, but it would be the length of a book.  So, let's just take a look at a couple of examples.  For starters, why do almost all compound animals have or had in the past (blind crickets, fish, etc.who had eyes before but lost them due to living in caves) have some kind of organ for seeing in the visible light spectrum?  I'm not talking about just modern animals, but all animals, including trilobites and various other animals dating back to the Cambrian period.  Even most worms and jellyfish have light sensing cells for determining light and darkness.  While modern animals can trace their eyesight back to their ancestors it's the devolopment of eyesight in the Cambrian animals that intrigues me the most.  The very first compound animals would not have had eyes.  So, why would they devolop in the first place.  Why would an animal devolop an organ in order to sense something that they otherwise would never have known anything about?  I believe that was God's decision and design.  In addition to that, the electromagnetic spectrum is a huge range of various wavelengths from gamma rays, infrared, ultraviolet, microwaves, radiowaves, etc.  The seven colors of visible white light is a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, yet that is what the eyes or light-senses tissues evolved around.  Why?  Again, I believe that this is the net result that God wanted and that's why we are like this.  For anyone who doesn't believe that God used evolution to shape animals and plants as they are today needs to look no further than the Holy Bible.  Yes, that's right.  It is in the King James version of the Holy Bible and yet it seems like everyone who argues about creationalism vs. evolution misses that point for some reason and I have no idea why.  In the first book of the Old Testament, Genesis, it reads "And God said unto the waters, bring forth life abundantly."  Then it says that cattle came after their kind and fowl came after their kind and creeping thing came after it's kind.  If that is not a direct reference to evolution and animals evolving over time to come out of the oceans and onto dry land just as the evolutionists say they did, then I don't know what is.  Lastly, elsewhere in the Bible it says that to God a day is but a year and a year is but a day.  Therefore, God does not view time as humans do.  It also says elsewhere in the Old Testament that the wisest man in the world is but a fool in God's eyes.  This implies that no matter what we know and what we think we know and what we think we may have a clue on is what God already knew and has always known.  Science, evolution, astrophysics, quantum physics are tools that mankind uses to try to figure out what God has known all along.  Being eternal, ever-lasting, omnipitant, meta-physical and the creator of the universe(s) probably gives you a clue as to how things work and how to create, manipulate and destroy things.  I read in a scientific journal once that the idea of amino acids coming together and forming life on earth by pure chance in the first place had the likeliness of a tornado going through a scrap yard and putting together a 747.  Another hard core scientist once said that if you take a good look at the galaxy and the known universe then you'd have to know that some kind of supreme being had to have created it.<br>  <br>  Ed|`|ixnk6rXraa	the evolutionists<br>  There is no proof of evolution. They have skeletons of long dead, related animals. the monkey has a simular skeleton to us too, how are they to know that is not also a monkey type creature?<br>  secondly, the genetics argument is moot as humans share 98% genetic simularity to rats... so are we evolved from rats?<br>  <br>  how can someone look at something as complex as the blood circulatory system or diffusion or the brain etc and say " oh, its because of random chance." Bull, i'd rather take my chances believing there is a guiding hand helping it all along.<br>  <br>  And dont start with the "if there was a God, why is there war and death etc"....... because there is.. we're mortal, this is our curse, this is our test. God is throwing us in the deep end and watching us sink or swim, live with it, shut up and get on with your life.<br>  <br>  <br>  *ahem* sorry, i don't have a view on this subject <grin>|`|VGdNu2X7aa	Everyone should be punched :D|`|8TmK8Qklaa	I would have said the liberals but they have enough brain damage without being punched harder.

The Owl isn't angry.  It doesn't want revenge.  It just wants to eat.<br>  <br>  Now, poorly trained dogs can be vicious.  If they weren't trained properly, or deliberately taught to fight, they get angry, they get "blood mad" and they attack viciously.<br>  <br>  An abused animal can be vicious.  If you piss it off, it will viciously attack you.  That's completely different than trying to survive the wild. <br>  <br>  Wild animals avoid one another.  They don't deliberately pick fights if they can avoid them.<br>  <br>  You really can't compare Owls and Eagles.  They're 2 seperate species.  They have different needs, different prey (which might make them more or less aggressive, depending on how much fight the food puts up).<br>  <br>  Please do more research.<br>  At least watch some more Animal Planet.|`|AA10259042	I do not think that vicious is the word you are looking for to describe owls and eagles. Vicious generally means malicious, spiteful,  mean, or evil, corrupt or depraved.  Owls and eagles do not fit that definition at all.  They are rather birds of prey.  In general eagles are larger than owls and in general hunt larger prey. The Harpy Eagle is among the largest eagles with a weight of about 14 pounds.  its prey is monkeys. Among the smallest eagles are the Serpent Eagles which weight about 2 to 3 pounds.  Their names also describe their prey. <br>  <br>  There are some large owls also. The Great Horned Owl is about 3 pounds. The Snowy Owl about 4 pounds.  But owls unlike eagles also have some very diminutive members of the family. The Elf Owl is only about 1.5 ounces which feeds on incests. There are many other small owls also.|`|YHmr7nvsaa	The great horned owl is more vicious than an eagle.|`|gWM7ONhBaa	No

You are looking for the values of x that make this graph less than 0.05. Use your calculator to find these x values!
ZGVUpLOAaa	Remember what the solutions to a quadratic equation mean when you factor them - they're the "zeros" of the graph. This means you need to set up two factors where x will solve for 7 or -1. This can be done most easily just by setting them up. x-7 = 0 means x=7; x+1 means x = -1. <br>  <br>  In factor form, you take these two factors as (x-7)(x+1).<br>  <br>  When you multiply it out, you get x^2-6x-7.

bmB08jCAaa	r is called the correlation coefficient.  Your statement that the best fit comes from having the absolute value of r close to zero is incorrect.  In fact, that gives the model with the WORST fit.  You want your r value to be closest to 1 in absolute value.  If you're using a graphing calculator to find your regression equations, then go to the catalog and choose the command, "Diagnostic On" and press enter to run it.  The calc will just say "Done", but then when you find your regression equation, the value of r and r^2 will appear on the screen below the regression equation, and you can choose the model of best fit.|`|451075cc0b28ffa413b31fd0b3fd84c0aa	The model predicts the value at each point.  Lets say that "X" is the independent variable and "Y" is the dependent variable.  The model will (usually) require the determination of some parameters in order to get the best fit for the data.  Lets get a really complicated one (but with no differentials - so it could be worse!).<br>  y = a/x + b*log(x+c) + d  -- so you need to determine a,b,c,d for the best fit.  good luck with that! lol. anyway lets say you somehow determine them - for each point that has been measured you plug in the X values and determine the model's Y values.  Lets call them Yn for the "real" measured Y and Ynm for the models calculated Y for each point (X1, Y1), (X2,Y2),(X3,Y3), ... (Xn,Yn)<br>  so you calculate (X1,Y1m),(X2,Y2m),...(Xn,Ynm)<br>  the difference between the real point and the calculated (model) point is<br>  Yn-Ynm   or equivalently Ynm-Yn  (just opposite sign) this difference can also be called the distance between the real and calculated point.<br>  You square them so that the difference becomes a distance squared becomes a magnitude without direction.  If you didn't square each difference before you add them together two large differences could cancel each other if one was positive and the other negative.  <br>  So you just add up the sum of the squared differences.  The assumption is that the best you can do is to minimize this sum (it is NOT an absolute value - youre confused) and since each difference2 is positive it can never be negative.  For a perfect fit the sum of the differences2 will be zero.  There are various ways to minimize the sum of the residuals2 to get you your best values of the parameters (in this case a.b.c.d).  But they are WAY too complicated to go into here.<br>  Often the best fit needs to agree with some boundary conditions which may require some forcing in the parameters.  In other words the least sqares fit might not be the best fit.  this requires information about the model that is independent of the data.<br>  <edit> first answerer is partially right, R2, the regression coefficient indicates a perfect fit when it is 1.000...<br>  I assumed you were incorrectly using r to stand for the residuals.  You need to get clear on the terminology or you will continue to be confused.  Sum of residuals is not the same as the sum of the square of the residuals and the square root of R2 is not the same as the sum of the residuals either.

ciMKcCsAaa	Hey!<br>  <br>  I just finshed Biology for major's I at my University and one of the last things my intrctor talked about was DNA!!!!! Yuck! It is not vey fun. I am more fond of Biology 2 for majors than Bio 1 personnally. I can't answer all your questions but I did what I could. Hope this helps. Hang in there. Biology is a beast of of totally different color at my school. It is so hard! I feel for you or if your're in Genetics. <br>  <br>  <br>  5) repressor protein- it conrols the rate of transcription. Think about it this way transcription is like wrtting down information. Translation is like reading what you wrote. like you have an activator /inducer protein and represoor protein. Activator/inducer says "ok we'll turn on this gene" and the repressor say "Ok les not turn on this gene" Make sense?<br>  <br>  4) It is imprtant to contol the rate of transcripton b/c only certian genes need to be turned on. All cell have same DNA, just what is diferent is only certian genes get read. Like genes for hair cells do not get turned on in genes that read liver cells. Always keep that in mind. All cells have same DNA. ONLY CERTAIN DNA IS READ!!!!!!<br>  <br>  4) Ribozymes-catalitc RNA. See Protiens are enzymes. they cause reactions to occure faster (think about the food in your stomach. If you did not have digestive enymes in your stomach them you could not digest food very quickly at all! It would take for ever to get a sandwhich digested!!!) Ribozymes are important. The Ribsosome is like a Ribozyme. It is what causes translattion or reading of genes.<br>  <br>  3) Intorns are cut out. Do you mean Extrons? That is what is read unless you are working with Fungi or Bacteria.<br>  <br>  2) What are you asking? I am not sure what you mean. are you making refernce to cap/tails model? B/C if you are what happens is the splicozme is going to cut out introns. Only extrons is what is read. Extrons will be caped off w/ poly A tails (just making refernce to the Adine tail)???<br>  <br>  1) Introns are just junk. They do not get read in Humans. They get spliced out/cutt out. They are not too improtant although some bacteria and fungi have alernative splcing-Hanve introns and exrons read in the final package.
Yk7Yr9Gsaa	Replication occurs before the interphase of mitosis before the cell division. It always occur in the nucleus because that's where DNA is stored. It must be copied quickly before the cell division in mitosis so each cell can contain an identical DNA, so the cells can collaborate on homeostasis(or the building and running of you).<br>  Hope this helps.

On the other hand, Magnesium does not have a full octet, and has two electrons in its valence shell. Once you remove those two electrons, it has a full octet which is why its third ionization energy is so high.

If we store it horizontally, then the liquefied petroleum gas will exert a greater pressure over the valve and there is a greater possibility of leakage. But if we store it vertically, then, Comparatively much less pressure will be exerted on it.

Till in the 1960s.<br>  <br>  <br>  Funding & policy debate in the US<br>  <br>      * 1993 - As per the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act, Congress and President Bill Clinton give the NIH direct authority to fund human embryo research for the first time.[53]<br>      * 1995 - The U.S. Congress passes an appropriations bill attached to which is a rider, the Dickey Amendment which prohibited federally appropriated funds to be used for research where human embryos would be either created or destroyed. President Clinton signs the bill into law. This predates the creation of the first human embryonic stem cell lines.<br>      * 1999 - After the creation of the first human embryonic stem cell lines in 1998 by James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin, Harriet Rabb, the top lawyer at the Department of Health and Human Services, releases a legal opinion that would set the course for Clinton Administration policy. Federal funds, obviously, could not be used to derive stem cell lines (because derivation involves embryo destruction). However, she concludes that because human embryonic stem cells "are not a human embryo within the statutory definition," the Dickey-Wicker Amendment does not apply to them. The NIH was therefore free to give federal funding to experiments involving the cells themselves. President Clinton strongly endorses the new guidelines, noting that human embryonic stem cell research promised "potentially staggering benefits." And with the guidelines in place, the NIH begins accepting grant proposals from scientists.[53]<br>      * 02 November, 2004 - California voters approve Proposition 71, which provides $3 billion in state funds over ten years to human embryonic stem cell research.<br>      * 2001–2006 - U.S. President George W. Bush signs an executive order which restricts federally-funded stem cell research on embryonic stem cells to the already derived cell lines. He supports federal funding for embryonic stem cell research on the already existing lines of approximately $100 million and $250 million for research on adult and animal stem cells.<br>      * 5 May, 2006 - Senator Rick Santorum introduces bill number S. 2754, or the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act, into the U.S. Senate.<br>      * 18 July, 2006 - The U.S. Senate passes the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act H.R. 810 and votes down Senator Santorum's S. 2754.<br>      * 19 July, 2006 - President George W. Bush vetoes H.R. 810 (Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act), a bill that would have reversed the Dickey Amendment which made it illegal for federal money to be used for research where stem cells are derived from the destruction of an embryo.<br>      * 07 November, 2006 - The people of the U.S. state of Missouri passed Amendment 2, which allows usage of any stem cell research and therapy allowed under federal law, but prohibits human reproductive cloning.[54]<br>      * 16 February, 2007 – The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine became the biggest financial backer of human embryonic stem cell research in the United States when they awarded nearly $45 million in research grants.[55]<br>      * 04 November, 2008 - The people of the U.S. state of Michigan passed Proposal 08-2, allowing Michigan researchers to make embryonic stem cell cultures from excess embryos donated from fertility treatments.[56]<br>      * 23 January, 2009 - Under the new President Barack Obama, the restrictions placed on federal funding of Stem Cell research in the United States were lifted.[57]

S7J3OIuCaa	It depends on where it is stimulated. Neurons have a cell body with a axon and place called the axon hilluck. Hes how it works. Its all about action potential. If you have enough stimulus to trigger a response then it will turn into an action potential in the membrane at the axon hillucks  (where the graded potentials turn into action potentials) actions potentials open all the sodium channels flooding the cell with sodium while sodium is running down its ion gradient and concentration gradient. this changes the membrane potential (think of potential as in potential energy, like holding a ball from a tall building, it has alot of potential energy because it can fall a long ways. The potential we are talking about here is in volts, which is the electric potential) so when you release this potential that was created by the membrane between the sodium and potassium it lowers (think about the ball falling about half way. This change in potential runs down the axon via voltage gated sodium channels (they only open given enough stimulus) but like a wave formation in football stadium, the potential runs down each channel until it reaches the axon terminus. There the action potential usually releases neurotransmitters. with the influx of calcium. So to answer your question more directly. If you stimulate the neuron enough to action potential anywhere on it then your will get a wave of stimulation down the axon to the end and then could release neuron transmitters to trigger another event. Depending on the neuron you can get different neurotransmitters released.

pwOR9xW6aa	This depends on a few things: (1) what type of cell are you looking at? (2) what phase in the cell's life cycle are you looking at?<br>  <br>  Generally DNA strands/chromatin holds a worm-like structure and, when not in division, is usually condensed together into a bundle. Beginning with the Prophase phase of mitosis (cell division) the chromosomes condense to form distinct, thick worm bodies. It is at this point also that the chromosomes have been duplicated into sister chromatids; so they actually look like an "X" with a connector node (centromere) in the middle.

However, there is evidence that is here today that bears on the flood as revealed in the Bible.<br>  <br>  If there had been a Noah’s ark where all animals were reduced to just two individuals – one male and one female – then the genetic variability, within all species (kind), of all animals existing today would be essentially ZERO.  All animals, all over the world today, would suffer the same problem of a lack of genetic variability that the Cheetah does today.  The genes of Cheetahs are so similar, one to another, that when skin grafts between non-related Cheetahs are made there is no rejection of the donor skin.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_variability" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_var...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheetah</a><br>  <br>  Yet, this is not what is found.  Only a few species (kinds) have the problem of low genetic variability.  Cheetahs experienced a near extinction about 10,000 years ago (down to perhaps less than ten individuals).  Today they have almost no genetic variability within the species because of that near extinction.<br>  <br>  Yet, the millions of animals around the world don't suffer from this problem.  That is because they were never reduced to just two individuals 5000 years ago.  They were never on an ark.  There never was a general flood that caused all life, except for two of a kind of every animal, to perish.  The very genes inside you and I proclaim that fact.<br>  <br>  It is obvious that the story of Noah’s ark is a wonderful story – but just a story.  It is a story of man's sinful nature and of Both God's impatience with man and of God's love for man as indicated by his regret and promise not to repeat the event.<br>  <br>  That does not reduce the importance of the story for it is a beautiful story of God’s love for us and of his justice and regret.  It is just not accurate, but it are not supposed to be.  The Bible is about God’s love and about how to live a righteous life and achieve everlasting life.  Don’t dishonor God by using and interpreting his written word incorrectly.|`|mV1YscV7aa	Good question and, as a Creationist, I will endeavour to give a serious answer.<br>  <br>  Firstly you have a slight inaccuracy since Mt Ararat, where Noah's Ark landed, and still is, is in modern day Turkey and not in Iran. <br>  <br>  I am of that school of Creationist thought, though I may become persuaded otherwise, that believes that Noah's Flood is only responsible for sediments between the Cambrian and the Carboniferous. <br>  <br>  So, considering that all the continents were at the time immediately after Noah joined into the super continent of Pangea, the Kangaroos could go hoppity hoppity hop all the way to Australia and Antarctica and South America and North America.<br>  <br>  After the Continental brak-up, the fossil record shows that Marsupials soon became extinct in North America, though the North American Opposum came back into N America after the Americas were joined together once again.<br>  <br>  Marsupials florished in South America and were the dominant mammals until the bridge from N America led to large numbers of placental mammals heading south and the extinction of MOST (but not all) South American marsupial species.<br>  <br>  That left Antarctica and Australia which had been joined onto S America for some time, there had been free movement of marsupials between the three continents. When they divided, Australia remained largely free of placental mammals which enabled a rich diversity of marsupial fauna to remain whilst Antarctican marsupials were frozen at the start of the Ice Age.<br>  <br>  Starpenta - why should my cheeks be red? Serious study of evolution and radio-metric dating of rocks show that both are full of problems and are not based on accurate science!! <br>  <br>  As for carnivorous animals, you obviously do not know the Bible - it clearly states that there were no meat eating animals until AFTER the Flood. Yes, both lions and tyrannosaurus, prior to flood (and probably for a little time after it) ate a vegetarian diet.

It is the place of myth, imagination, faith and reality. if we are willing to listen, astronomy can give us a perspective on life… and a perspective on reality… found in no other field of study.  If you can fully embrace the vast and wondrous universe that WE are a part of… it can enrich your life beyond measure. for some, the catalyst for a kind of “universal embrace” is a trip to the moon.  As you may know, space travel can be a very powerful “philosophical” influence, often making poets out of fighter pilots and philosophers out of scientists.

All the building blocks to make RNA were present from the very birth of the solar system.  <br>  <br>  Amino acids are molecules defined as a carbon atom that is bonded to 4 functional groups.  1 is a hydrogen atom, 2 is an amine, 3 is a carboxyl and the 4th varies depending on the amino acid.   Amino acids are produced by both living and non-living processes.<br>  <br>  RNA is composed of 3 parts.  Part 1 is the 5 carbon sugar ribose.  2 is a nitrogenous base (such as adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, uracil) and the 3rd is a phosphate group that links together RNA bases.  So, to make RNA, you need to make ribose and nitrogenous bases.  Phosphate is simple and abundant.  <br>  <br>  The precursors of ribose are also abundant and forms easily.  They have been found in vast molecular gas clouds in space which would have been present in the early solar system as these gas clouds collapse to form stars and planets.  There are other inorganic ways to synthesize ribose in the presence of simple catalysts like borax.<br>  <br>  Nitrogenous bases also form easily and can be found in molecular gas clouds in space.  They also form under a variety of conditions from simple starting material.

GHrzxJUbaa	the generally accepted age for the Earth and the rest of the solar system is about 4.55 billion years (plus or minus about 1%). this value is derived from several different lines of evidence. unfortunately, the age cannot be computed directly from material that is solely from the Earth. there is evidence that energy from the Earth's accumulation caused the surface to be molten. further, the processes of erosion and crustal recycling have apparently destroyed all of the earliest surface. the oldest rocks which have been found so far (on the Earth) date to about 3.8 to 3.9 billion years ago (by several radiometric dating methods). some of these rocks are sedimentary, and include minerals which are themselves as old as 4.1 to 4.2 billion years. rocks of this age are relatively rare, however rocks that are at least 3.5 billion years in age have been found on North America, Greenland, Australia, Africa, and Asia. while these values do not compute an age for the Earth, they do establish a lower limit (the Earth must be at least as old as any formation on it). this lower limit is at least concordant with the independently derived figure of 4.55 billion years for the Earth's actual age.|`|PjW3Yo2saa	some say over 3 billion years<br>  hard to carbon date rocks that old<br>  because of the planet recycles itself|`|JwPu0XbIaa	It's about 4.5 billion years old, according to our current best estimates.  That's 4,500,000,000 years.|`|Swcbwqmpaa	There is much debate on this. If you're going off of the Bible, it's believed to be about seven to ten thousand years old. If you go off of evolution, they say between two to four billion years.<br>  <br>  <br>  There is a great deal of scientific evidence which suggests that the earth is nowhere near the ages claimed. Most of this evidence comes through the work of researchers who do not believe in the Bible account of creation. The evidence would allow the Bible chronology with a relatively recent creation around 6000 years ago to be correct.<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Insufficient sea-floor sediment: At current rates of erosion the amount of sea-floor sediments actually found could accumulate in 12 million years. The oceans are alleged to have existed for 3 billion years.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Creationists contend these sediments could have accumulated rapidly at the flood of Noah c. 5000 years ago.<br>  <br>  2. Insufficent Sodium Chloride in the sea: Evolutionary estimates for the age of the earth's oceans are 3 billion years. With current rates of deposition, the salt in the sea could have accumulated in 42-62 million years at todays rate and of course much faster in the Noahic flood.<br>  <br>  Note: Calculations done for many other elements produce even younger ages.<br>  <br>  3. Decay of the magnetic field of the Earth: This is occurring too rapidly to fit the long-age evolutionary paradigm - the total energy stored having decreased by a factor of 2.7 over the past 1000 years. Creationists have a model explaining this based on sound physics.<br>  <br>  4. Tightly bent strata: These stata, thousands of feet thick are tightly bent without cracking. Yet they are meant to have solidified over millions of years and then bent. The creationist explanation is that they formed while still plastic as the entire formation had to be soft when formed to avoid cracking. This would point to the folding having occurred thousands of years and not millions after formation.<br>  <br>  5. Fossil Radioactivity: Radiohaloes which have shown evidence of having been squashed indicate that the Jurassic, Triassic and Eocene formations in the Colorado plateau were formed in a short time-frame - over months, not hundreds of millions of years. This is so since the rings formed by the haloes, which only exist for a short time before they decay were squashed, indicating rapid formation. If the rocks had formed over a long time span the haloes would not have been there.<br>  <br>  6. Misplaced Helium: Helium is generated by radioactive elements as they decay. The escape of this Helium into the atmosphere can be measured. If this has been occurring for 5 billion years there should be much more Helium in the atmosphere, instead of the 0.05% that is actually there when compared to the relevant time scale.<br>  <br>  7. Insufficient stone-age skeletons: The 100,000 year stone-age of evolutionary anthropologists should have produced many more skeletons - around 4 billion, many more of which should still be around compared to the few thousand found.<br>  <br>  8. Recent Agriculture: The archeological evidence shows the stone age people to be as intelligent as modern man and yet it is claimed they existed for 100,000 years before discovering that plants grow from seeds. Creationists would think that it is more likely that man was without agriculture for a much shorter period immediately after the flood.<br>  <br>  9. History too short: Stone-age people built huge monuments, did beautiful cave paintings and kept records of lunar phases. It seems unreasonable that they should wait nearly 100,000 years before beginning to make written historical records around 4-5000 BC. A much shorter Biblical time-scale seems to better fit this evidence.|`|BA3tFr4oaa	5770|`|7OXSHSl9aa	ever since adam and eve started banging

GADPA33daa	Good Question. <br>  <br>  Firstly, the indigestion of blood is not natural. Your stomach produces the chemical hydrochloric acid (HCl) and its main function is to break down the ingested food/substance into a simpler form so it can be used by the body to create nutrients for use by your cells. So if you ingest your blood your body will break-down the blood (blood is comprised of Red blood cells which carry oxygen to your body, white blood cells which fight infection and platelets which help your blood clot to stop bleeding) and "try" to use the blood to fuel the body's functions but the nutrients required to fuel the cells, do not come from current broken-down cells. <br>  <br>  Secondly, when blood is ingested, the body has an automatic mechanism to expel unwanted material. This is achieved by making the person feeling nauseous thus they'll [most of the time] throw-up the blood (this also depends on how much blood has been ingested). <br>  <br>  To answer you're question more directly, you cannot hope to live if you try to drink the blood. If you have had significant blood loss you will require a transfusion of blood at the hospital and the cause of the bleeding will need to be stopped. The blood will also be "contaminated" because it will have begun to oxidize and you would've had to drink it off of the ground (or wherever) depending on the mechanism of injury which is causing the blood loss. <br>  <br>  In my experience when some patients have ingested blood they usually fell very sick and eventually vomit the contents up. I see this a lot these days, especially when a patient has has a bad nose-bleed (epistaxis). They do not know how to apply first aid to stop the bleeding and tilt their head so the blood runs straight into their stomach. <br>  <br>  I hope that answered your question. <br>  If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to contact me|`|S7J3OIuCaa	Your digestive juices would destory the blood cells. that is if your gut is still working after all the blood loss. when you digest it takes everything down to simple absorbable molecules, like glucose and other sugars and amino acids.|`|6Z49DZaRaa	I'm sure it wouldn't get back into your bloodstream fast enough.

Also what comes on the back end of "eating" blood is no picnic either.|`|qJ52Y9Auaa	If you have excessive blood loss, then yes, you can die. Your main organs in your body responsible for survival (brain and heart) require constant blood supply. If you lose a lot of blood, those organs will not get enough oxygen, which is supplied through oxygenated blood and those organs will not be able to function efficiently to keep you alive. <br>  <br>  Drinking blood will not go directly into your blood stream. It won't get the chance to reach your blood stream because it will be destroyed before it can even be absorbed. You will need to get blood infused into your blood vessels to replace the blood loss if it was a huge amount that you lost.

pwOR9xW6aa	In terms of molecular biology an indicator molecule is used to identify the presence of a gene. For example, you have a gene from an organism that you want to copy. So you cut it out and place it in a plasmid, and place that plasmid into E. coli. By just looking it is impossible to tell which E. coli successfully took up your plasmids, and which are successfully expressing the gene. So to test this you have indicator molecules. The most popular is X-gal and it works with the bacterial gene lac Z. Lac z produces an enzyme beta-galactosidase. When this enzyme comes in contact with X-gal it causes a blue coloration.<br>  <br>  So you clone your gene into a plasmid that contains a lac z gene, and plate the E. coli that you transformed the plasmids into onto agar plates containing X-gal. When you look at the colonies grown the blue colonies will indicate bacteria that successfully took up your plasmid and are expressing the lac z gene (and the gene in question as well).

ZahjlUioaa	you are right about the light absorption and the plants uptake red and blue lights. The reason why the plant world take up these lights is due to the wave lengths. Did you know that only leaves takes up blue light more than red? This is due to the wavelengths. Blue wave lengths (for vegetation) are wider than red- far-red. Red is also taken up in relatively high numbers, but not as much as blue. This is also due to the thylakoid taking up light within the chloroplasts. Red is mostly used for fruiting. Also red wave lengths travel farther within in the canopy so the outside leaves are more light green due to the fact that the plant is taking up the more blue and red light while inside the canopy the leaves are dark green is due to the lack of blue light and more of far-red.|`|7ShwS79Yaa	I believe that this is one of those times where scientists honestly say, "We don't know."

The easiest way to deal with this is to add the two equations together from the get-go. So you will have an equation where the reactants will include all of the CH4, C2H6, and O2 from the left side of the equations, and then the product side will be everything from the right side of both equations. The equilibrium constant for this new reaction will be the product of the equilibrium constants of the individual reactions.<br>  <br>  Once you have this new chemical equation, you need to set up an "ICE" table.

CCeRdaoLaa	The first two aren't really evidence for evolution, though.  Cells do change over time, but evolution is more than just change - it's change over successive generations.  You wouldn't begin to see evolution until the cell had reproduced many, many times (and while they do replicate many times in the body, they are following a pre-programmed course, rather than changing in response to the environment).<br>  <br>  I like the last two ideas, though.  To elaborate on the last one, you could discuss how cells are very similar between related species (humans and dogs) with more differences between more distant species (humans and insects) and big differences between distant relations (humans and plants).<br>  <br>  Pelagius made a good point with endosymbiosis too - many organelles are believed to have come from separate prokaryotic organisms that took up residence inside of cells.  The mitochondria, for example, has its own set of DNA.  That set of DNA has atrophied over time, so it wouldn't be able to survive outside of the cell (and the cell wouldn't be able to survive without the mito).  The atrophy is an example of evolution - since evolution isn't necessarily improvement, just change.  The mitochondria didn't need its entire genome to survive since it's host cell took care of most of its needs.  As a result, evolution (over a billion or so years) took away the genes that it no longer needed.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Perhaps it isn't<br>  <br>  Consider this<br>  <br>  Creation in the 21st Century “Caught in the Act”<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOdByKKvV6I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOdByKKvV...</a> (Part 1)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CQb7tS-EjM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CQb7tS-E...</a> (Part 2)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfN3UfoDZkQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfN3UfoDZ...</a> (Part 3)<br>  <br>  Creation In The 21st Century -- From Where did these Layers ... <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZyoXQJ5Al0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZyoXQJ5A...</a><br>  <br>  Creation in the 21st Century - Overwhelming Evidence 1 of 3 <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o226umqLdsU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o226umqLd...</a><br>  Creation in the 21st Century - Overwhelming Evidence 2 of 3 <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-4O7AOYLqc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-4O7AOYL...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLFFduC56Y&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLFFduC5...</a><br>  <br>  Evolution: Against All Odds!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS9o9cbQDLI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS9o9cbQD...</a><br>  <br>  Creation In The 21st Century - Palace of Dinosaurs Part 2 (1 of 3)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeK239U2fdE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeK239U2f...</a><br>  <br>  Creation in the 21st Century - Explain God<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqwP3ZuZq1Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqwP3ZuZq...</a>|`|MUWy20NVaa	Cellular endosymbiosis - start with wikipedia, but Never use wikipedia as a reference in serious writing!!<br>  <br>  Just google Cellular Endosymbiosis ... there are loads of references, and it's very cool!|`|hRwtmJw2aa	you could mention Robert Hooke who was the first to discover cells using primitive microscope in 1655.

GkzOurZmaa	It depends on how fat you are. If you're kind of fat at the start, then you'll lose weight. If you're already pretty fit, then you could end of gaining weight due to muscle build up (muscles are heavier than fat). I would'nt recommend starting with 2 miles, though. If you lift heavy weigts, then don't do it everyday, or else you'll tear your muscles. Same with biking.

It should look like Int((x+1)^-2dx).  Now, substitute u = x+1, and du = dx.  Now it just looks like Int(u^-2du).  Now integrate.  and I get -(u)^-1.

qJ52Y9Auaa	Pharmacists are health care professionals that are basically "drug experts". When doctors diagnose patients with health conditions, they prescribe the patients medications. When the patients get these filled, the pharmacists are responsible for checking for any drug interactions that may occur with the current medications they taking (if any) before dispensing them, and if any possible drug interactions are found, they notify the physician about it so the physician can prescribe an alternative medication. They are also responsible for counseling patients on how to properly take their medications and also warn them of any side effects that may occur while taking the medications. In addition to that, they also help physicians in prescribing certain medications when the physicians don't know to much about the medicine. Pharmacists also compound medications, but this is not done as often as in the past since most medications manufactured by drug companies, but if there were situations when a patient can't take a pill, they can make them in to solution forms.<br>  <br>  As for the degree, most pharmacists practicing are either RPH's (Registered Pharmacist) or PHARMD's (Doctor of Pharmacy). Almost all pharmacy schools now offer the PHARMD degree. Before the PHARMD degree was offered, there was the Bachelor's of Science in Pharmacy degree, which allowed pharmacists to take an exam to become an RPH, however PHARMD's are also required to take the board exam (NAPLEX) in order to practice in pharmacy. They just added an additional 2 years of schooling to get the PHARMD degree (minimum 6 years of school - 2 pre-pharmacy and 4 professional pharmacy).|`|PqmmyV6baa	A pharmacist is usually the person that you don't see. They are mixing, the medication or putting it into bottles in the back. They kind of work behind the scenes. The person that you usually see is the Pharmacist Technician. This is the person that distributes the medication to the patient. Sometimes the Pharmacist can be in the front too, the Pharmacist Technician is on brake, or not there. And the Pharmacist is the person that people call when wanting to know more detail about their medicine.|`|Bn1Eio94aa	There are 2 different types of pharmacists.

They also make sure if you are allergic to a certain type of med. that you  don't receive that med ora med in that same family.  They monitor usage and frequency  of meds accordance to state law.

xbma9SuWaa	Amplitude is proportional the strength/magnitude of a wave.  It is the displacement perpendicular to the waves direction of motion. EX: when you wave 'hello' to someone the displacement that your hand travels is called the peak to peak amplitude.  A normal hand wave is probably a half of a foot or something. Note: usually amplitude is not expressed from peak to peak...it is expressed by 1/2 the peak to peak  or even the square root of the peak to peak.<br>  <br>  Frequency is the amount of times the wave repeats within a given period of time.   EX:  try to wave your hand back and forth count how many times you can wave in one second.  The number is the frequency...(something like 5 waves per second)<br>  <br>  <br>  Oscillations are the waving motions that make a nice patern.  EX:  you wave your hand left to right...when it your hand has returned all the way to the right again you have just completed one oscillation|`|Blim758paa	<a href="http://getinall.palacebet.com" rel="nofollow">http://getinall.palacebet.com</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website
J3TGyOnDaa	I wanted to be a professional astronomer, but realized that my math skills were not good enough and I would be very frustrated if I did not change my attitude about math. I successfully changed my attitude. This was before PCs were common, in the 1970's, I wonder if I tried to be an astronomy major today if I would find it as frustrating, because so much has been computerized these days that I suspect a lot of our memories are being slowly eroded away. Now that I understand basic calculus and physics, I really do wonder at times. I'll be happy if I ever get the chance to work on Ph.D. in planetary geology, but quantum mechanics and physical chemistry probably still blow my mind.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6f4545987db8cc09b8bec883d38d82faaa	Kind of like Tycho?

We have lived in our home for over 20 years and from the moment I walked over the doorstep I felt it was mine. It was flooded with toilet waste, there were no fences around it, the paintwork inside was every disgusting colour combination you could think of ie chocolate brown skirting, bottle green door 3 candy floss pink walls and a bright yellow wall - this was just in the living room. It was riddled with woodworm and because of the flooding inside, was full of damp throughout. The garden was so overgrown you couldn't actually see where the front pathway ran and the window frames were rotting and in need of a good painting. The drains including the main sewerage pipe were blocked and flooded the garden with raw sewerage. It really needed to be condemned. <br>  I walked in through the front door for the first time and thought yes this is the right house for us. It felt like it was welcoming us into it heart sort of thing.Since moving here all those years ago, we have tried on a few occasions to move homes for one reason or another (work related etc). Every single time we have tried to move, it has always fell through at the other end ie paperwork being lost, house repossessed, etc. I came to the conclusion that our little house just does not want us to leave it just yet - daft I know but that is what I came up with. <br>  I believe it has something to do with the 'energy' of the property. If it gels well with your own energy system, you will want to be in it so will buy or rent the house just to do that. If the energy isn't right for you then something will stop you from getting that property or if you get it you won't stay there long enough to make it your home.<br>  I have always loved this house even when it was crying out for some tlc, and although there are still a number of things that need doing to it, it has always provided my family with a safe and secure space which is filled with peace and love, and for that reason, I am in no rush to leave it.<br>  I hope this helps to answer your question.|`|an1b4pXxaa	I sort of felt like that when we bought this house, but I was so so sick of looking at houses I was about ready to settle for a cardboard box on the side of the road.<br>  <br>  If you are buying real estate ideally you should be deciding with your head, not your heart, buying a property is too expensive an investment to purchase on a mere whim.|`|GjrM3aRXaa	It's not actually strange to feel such on a place you think it satisfies your categories and criteria for a good living place.

AA12056708	Define what you mean by helping.<br>  <br>  On one hand they're protecting public health, so they're helping the average citizen.   But on the other hand their pollution controls cost millions making it harder for smaller companies to compete, raising prices, and cutting into money companies could use to hire & pay workers.<br>  <br>  Some partially blame EPA controls for the high gas prices.   Each year gas demand goes up, but the US has not build a new refinery in decades.   With no additional refinery capacity, higher demand will always equal higher gas prices, no matter how much oil we pump out of the ground.<br>  <br>  The EPA is also blasted by environmentalist groups for their inconsistent, slow, and short-sighted enforcement of environmental laws.  In many states freshwater fish caught out of rivers & large lakes are still too toxic for a person to eat many of a year.  The EPA has no plans on how to fix this problem.   <br>  <br>  We also think the EPA will protect us from contaminants in our environment but there are so many things they do not cover.  Indoor air quality isn't controlled and many of us inhale mold, formaldahyde (carpeting outgassing), stale air, and other pollutants.   They don't test our meats or dairy for all the pesticides, herbicides, and heavy metals that accumulate in the animals tissue throughout its life.   There are many things we think the EPA monitors but they don't.<br>  <br>  IMHO the EPA is hurting because it's giving us a false sense of security.  Cancer rates are not going down.  Birth defects are still a problem and some feel autism is linked to an enviornmental toxin.   In short, the EPA needs a major reform and needs to work independently from the special interest groups, corporate lobbyists, and politicians.|`|4650bc5207b817328dce2fe5a442dad8aa	In many cases they are helping. BUT, as any bureaucracy, sometimes the loudest member gets rewarded, so it is not uncommon to see ridiculous and asanine rulings for cases that should be modestly regulated but not smashed with an iron fist.<br>  <br>  I know of some farmers who had riverfront property 40 miles from any downstream population area and in a wet region who were jailed (for years) because they added fresh sand to an old boat launch pathway into the river (on their property). A dumb ruling. Better: let them keep the boat launch they put in and require them to add buffer zones around it to further manage runoff (which was not a problem anyway but would be a resonable "punishment").  In another "wetlands" case, the state of Florda EPA halts commercial sale of land (maybe 10 acres) that has a 40 year old pond on it resulting from a US Highway roadbed embankment made years ago to improve traffic flow. The "new" pond is now called wetlands and the owner cannot find a buyer except one who can "bribe" the state with 5 times the acreage of wetlands purchased and donated from another part of the state. Meanwhile 3 other corners of an intersection are booming with development. Is there any common sense there? No.  EPA has no provision for common sense.  I am sure there are many "horror stories" over air and water issues. For every 10 good things EPA does, there are probably 5 that harm more than help.IMHO.

I1RrS7Pwaa	I'm a chemistry major in college so I know what I'm doing :)<br>  <br>  The molar mass of CaSO4 is 136.42 g/mol, so you divide 600g by that to get the number of moles, which is 4.398mol.  <br>  <br>  For the number of moles of oxygen you have two considerations: is it radical oxygen, which is just O, or is it oxygen gas, which is O2?  <br>  <br>  In the first case, you have the same number of moles of O as you do moles of CaSO4 because there is one O in ever CaSO4 molecule.  If it is O2, then there is ONE O2 for every two CaSO4 molecules, so your answer would be 2.199mol.<br>  <br>  For the number of oxygen atoms in 600g you need to use Avogadro's number, which is 6.02 x 10^23 specific units per mole.

La biblioteca personal de cualquier entusiasta casi seguramente incluía un buen número de libros, la mayoría de ellos ediciones rústicas, acerca de los misterios del mar: buques desvanecidos, objetos no identificados saliendo del mar, y la posibilidad de que la mítica Atlántida aún estuviese activa bajo las olas del Atlántico después de miles de a?os. <br>  <br>  Autores como Charles Berlitz, Richard Winer y John Wallace Spencer se convirtieron en los máximos exponentes de la realidad de la figura geométrica en el agua que devoraba aparatos hechos por el hombre sin dejar rastro de ellos. Otros autores se vieron obligados a pescar misterios en otros mares: algunos, como Jay Gourley, los encontraron en el Lago Ontario, cuyas anomalías magnéticas siguen siendo una realidad hasta el presente; otros como Kevin Killey echaron sus redes en el "Meridiano del Diablo" cerca de la australiana isla de Tasmania.<br>  <br>  Pero con el paso de los a?os, y la aparición de nuevas obras investigativas como la de Lawrence David Kusche, que apuntaban hacia un origen mundano de las desapariciones, o al hecho de que muchas de las embarcaciones jamás existieron, el interés por el Triángulo de las Bermudas comenzó a menguar, o al menos dejó de ser una fascinación para la nueva generación de fanáticos de lo paranormal. No obstante, todavía existe una cantidad de eventos sin explicar que tienen su origen en las aguas del Atlántico - eventos que jamás han sido incluidos en los libros que tratan sobre el tema.<br>  <br>  "Atención, les habla el capitán..."<br>  <br>  El 11 de junio de 1998, el vuelo 1844 de la US Airways con destino a Filadelfia desde San Juan de Puerto Rico, se encontró con una turbulencia considerable en pleno vuelo: una perturbación lo suficientemente fuerte como para suspender el servicio de bebidas y comida inmediatamente. El capitán se disculpó profusamente con los pasajeros, indicando que el aparato se encontraba "fuera del alcance de cualquier radar basado en tierra" y por consiguiente, no podía solicitar el cambio a una menor elevación. Mientras que el Boeing 737 seguía siendo juguete de las corrientes de aire, algunos pasajeros comentaron abiertamente sobre el Triángulo de las Bermudas, omitiendo las consecuencias sufridas por los aviones que entran en dicha zona. Después de varias horas, la turbulencia se redujo y el avión llegó a su destino sin percances. <br>  <br>  El ejemplar de la revista Pursuit de julio de 1973 incluyó un caso bastante dramático narrado por Robert J. Durant, conocido por sus pesquisas ufológicas. Durant entrevistó a un piloto que volaba el trayecto entre la ciudad de Nueva York y San Juan de manera rutinaria, acostumbrado a los disturbios que suelen producirse en la zona y que en ocasiones han sido lo suficientemente fuertes como para arrojar a los pasajeros de un lado de la cabina al otro. En este caso, el piloto dijo que sus oficiales y la tripulación habían comentado sobre la tranquilidad del vuelo. <br>  Pero poco después de haberse producido el comentario, destellos de electricidad estática de color violáceo <br>  El pasajero promedio con la suerte de conseguir un asiento de ventanilla en un vuelo comercial api?ado tiene a veces más cosas que ver por la ventana que los cielos de color azul irreal y nubes blancas que se extienden hasta el infinito.|`|0a37309076e496189e5cedefd7419986aa	YO TENGO POR ENTENDIDO QUE SE TRATA DE UN CAMPO MAGNETICO, QUE NO DEJA PASAR NADA ALLI<br>  <br>  AUNQUE TAMBIEN SE DICE QUE ES PORQUE HAY EXISTIO O EXISTE LA "ATLANTIDA"|`|f96457bc5afd63f2c79d6b0db4d4e600aa	a ciencia cierta no hay nada comprobado solo es un mito como tantos otros<br>  <br>  te dejo algo interesante para que respondas= <a href="http://ar.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApZpKWsfGy9X_EXBwrrzeJGA9gt.?qid=20070314120248AAZBlYI">http://ar.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|g6TDn3oKaa	No se a que te refieres, porque hay varias versiones del triangulo de las Bermudas, la ultima que escuche fue que era un lugar donde hay una gran fuga de una gran cantidad de gases, en donde continuamente estan saliendo al exterior, y que cuando por alli pasa alguna embarcacion, o un avion, quedan atrapados, y por la gran cantidad de gases, pierden su propio control, y en el caso de los aviones, los que se quedan atrapados, en lugar de seguir volando hacia su destino, se confunden y vuelan hacia abajo hasta que se estrellan, han encontrado muchos aviones al igual que enbarcaciones,que terminaron en la misma forma,|`|o1LvSs77aa	Yo no lo sé, pero puedes checar esto...sòlo explica lo de los barcos, no de los aviones, pero es interesante.|`|2a46f302d95ebe6bc4fb84482ab0555caa	Nada de eso se sabe, salvo que es una antiquisima leyenda inventada por navegantes que trascendio a traves del tiempo y en algun momento fue utilizada para ahuyentar a los exploradores y navegantes.|`|3f7c4e4f0c2486eae4fd06bafdbeaf73aa	No sé!!|`|5xIOy3IYaa	no se pero algo anormal seguro...la verdad es ke da miedo, hay que reconocerlo..yo no iria alli ni aunke me pagaran...no sabemos ke es lo ke te puedes encontrar alli...|`|DtB27uIVaa	Un total paradigma, el tiempo y el desarrollo de la ciencia nos daran las respuestas.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|GLDrQ2WNaa	Alguien muy conocedor de estos temas, al que hice la misma pregunta que tus nos haces ahora, me dijo que allí la materia (todo y todos somos energia) , se transforma y pasa a otra dimensión, por eso desaparecen barcos, y/o las personas que iban en los barcos|`|T3iYkMsEaa	Ahora se piensa que se debe a la accion de las bacterias metanogenicas del fondo.

Think of ratios as relationships.  There is a relationship of weight to calories burned.  So you would set it up as 410/150=x/180.  (You can also do 150/410=180/x, it just matters that you are consistent.)<br>  <br>  You can then solve it in two ways.  One is to think like algebra and solve for x.  Multiply 180 by 410/150.  You will get 522.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  You can look at 180 and 150 and think about ways to multiply 150 to get 180.  Can think of any?  Then simplify the ratio 410/150.  You would get 41/15.  15 x 12 = 180.  So x = 41 x 12  or 522.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.

dd1f0e09945b4419fe7a2963287e3412aa	Come prima cosa vorrei rispondere ad aquilagigliata, dato che questa non è solo una teoria non confermata, ma è confermatissima ed è una delle basi della fisica moderna: la relatività ristretta di Albert Einstein (da non confondersi con la relatività generale, molto più importante). <br>  E' complessa da spiegare, e per una trattazione più approfondita ti rimando ad <a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativit%C3%A0_ristretta." rel="nofollow">http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativit%C...</a><br>  In pratica questa teoria afferma che il tempo e lo spazio non sono assoluti, ma sono appunto relativi all'osservatore e alla sua velocità, e perciò andando ad altissime velocità un uomo vedrebbe tutto il resto andare sempre più veloce, mentre uno spettatore esterno lo vedrebbe sempre rallentare, anche se può sembrare controintuitivo.<br>  <br>  PS: La velocità della luce c non è raggiungibile se non per corpi non aventi massa, e perciò non si può viaggiare alla velocità della luce nè superarla. Eventuali corpi viaggianti sopra la velocità della luce, i cosiddetti tachioni, non potrebbero rallentare sotto questa soglia nè interagire con la materia normale, e comunque non è detto che queste particelle esistono: potrebbero esistere, ma noi non lo sapremo mai perchè la materia nrmale non può interagire con i tachioni senza creare paradossi temporali.|`|ef9cb7811d1db49d6048b82e08f48959aa	per la teoria della relativita di Einstin piu ti avvicini alla velocita' della luce e piu' per te il tempo passa piu' lentamente ma se dovessi toccare la velocita' della luce la materia si disintegrerebbe.|`|8cbb6cd0952d9ae222c2ac3266aac508aa	e il paradosso dei gemelli, prova a cercarlo se non trovi niente mandami una mail che ti spiego ciao|`|28ea2fc06015a7e0096a3636fabb769daa	perchè per quanto possa sembrare strano e di difficile comprensione il tempo è variabile, il passare del tempo dipende dalla velocità più un corpo va veloce più lentamente passa per lui il tempo visto da chi va più lento di lui, se tu viaggiassi su una navicella attorno alla terra a velocità elevata e noi ti potessimo vedere, ti vedremmo invecchiare più lentemante di noi, ma tu non te ne accorgeresti di invecchiare più lentamente.<br>  il tempo è relativo......anche nel quotidiano<br>  se passi 30 minuti con una bellissima e simpaticissima ragazza la mezz'ora ti sembrerà volare, se ti obbligassero a passarli seduto su una stufa sarebbero interminabili|`|823f4785f6def1289429b70a6bb4c539aa	Se non sbaglio (ed è facile che sia così), per velocità inferiori a quella della luce, il sistema di riferimento spazio-tempo resta costante in ogni punto dell'universo. Oltrepassata la soglia della velocità della luce, il sistema di riferimento cambia, quindi se prendiamo 2 persone, a una le diamo una bella spintarella a oltre 300.000 km\s,  e l'altra la lasciamo ferma qui, ne avremo che il tempo scorrerà diversamente per l'una e per l'altra. Spero di essermi spiegato.|`|8a95faab0df435ab91d12eeb71c4a914aa	Non è una teoria provata, al limite l'assenza della gravità rallenta l'invecchiamento...|`|dc4d59f7248716eebcfd5739a1884069aa	per ora è una teoria, e come tutte le teorie non si è ancora plasmata con la realtà...per cui si possono avere opinioni discordanti in materia.

8164b59d38cdf333ec8d5e84111db2d5aa	Young's double slit experiment does not PROVE that we create our own reality. However, some believe it does offer evidence that perception can affect reality. <br>  <br>  It doesn't simply show the wave/particle duality of quantum particles. When the experiment is set up with no detectors, and a beam of light is sent through, an interference pattern is formed, as is expected wave behavior. However, if a detector is placed at either or both slits in an attempt to differentiate which slit a particular photon travels through, the difraction pattern is not achieved.<br>  <br>  The Copenhagen interpretation takes this to mean that until the photon is detected, it exists at all points in space. In the abscence of detectors, the particle can and therefore does pass through both slits, thus arriving at the grid at the exact same time via both pathways and causing interference with itself. However, when the photon is detected by way of a physical interaction with the placed detector, the photon suddenly exists only in the point in space where it has been detected, and therefore reaches the grid via a single path and causes no interference pattern. <br>  <br>  This does not neccessarily mean that if one chooses to see something, the necessary light waves will form to bring the vision to reality, but it does suggest that the universal reality we rely on may be based on the physical interaction of all its parts.|`|202819f56396f8645b10e835550c363faa	The universe exist even when you lose your eyes.|`|3cdad0d1e25b8755af61972f9a659121aa	The double slit experiment only reveals to us the wave properties of light and matter, nothing more. Our observations of the universe are a limit to how good our models of the universe can be, but there is no scientific experiment that will support a no-real-answer question like "does the universe appear because we observe it?" This question is philosophy with no answer and a search for truth is futile.|`|fdff467e40d504ade7ecb621f0969b7eaa	First, we observe things with all of our senses, not just the eyes.<br>  <br>  Here's another way to look at what you are asking:<br>  <br>  I think, therefore, I am.  Can you prove to me that you exist?  How do I know that the whole universe is not just the creation of my imagination?  Perhaps I am the whole of existence, and this universe is just what I did to entertain myself.<br>  <br>  On another level, I once asked ,"Why does anything exist?"  I drove myself crazy until I finally found an answer that at least allowed me to forget the question.  My answer?  Just as zero is a value, a state of nothingness would still be something.  Logically, there cannot be nothing, since nothing is still something.

m2pNTLloaa	It helps to think of a flow of electricity as analogus to a flow of water.    The battery is like 2 tanks.    With a charged battery the water levels in the tanks are different, so water will flow from the tank with the higher lever to the tank at the lower level.  This flow could turn a turbine to do work.  (Flow of electrons can be used to do work like run a CD player)    With discharged battery the water levels are the same so there is no flow to turn the turbine and do work. (No flow of electrons to do work like run a CD player,.)
YvqiIkZCaa	Let me help you.    In order to get the common factor, follow the steps below:    1. For the first number, check what number divides it so that there will be no remainder. For example, the number 9 can be divided by 3 and you get 3 without a remainder.  2. List those numbers down.  3. Do the same for the second number.  4. List those numbers down.  5. Put the numbers in a fashion that they are almost aligned.    E.g.    Factors of 9: 3  Factor of 6:   2, 3    6. With the numbers aligned, encircle the common numbers. In our example, it is 3.    The common factor for 6 and 9 is 3.    Follow the steps and you can answer your homework in no time.|`|RTa3g9ZHaa	Please do your own homework and don't expect everybody else to do it for you!

gCn6bXAFaa	Stuff like this can often be found on the liverock you put into your tank to give it a real ocean microbial ecosystem (of sorts).  I honestly don't know much about this.  My brother however, would pick through the liverock tanks at the fish store, find bits of coral, rear them out in his tanks, split them up and then sell them back to the fish store.  Even the tiniest bit of coral can multiply pretty fast in excellent conditions, as I guess y'all've seen.    Most of these creatures live with a combination of filter-feeding, grabbing chunks floating by and shoving them into their mouths, and photosynthesis.  Since typical tank lights don't have the proper spectrum you'd need a type of grow light to make these critters really happy.  I don't know if that's really necessary though.    Collectively these types of creatures are called soft corals.  They only move with the water currents.  Xenia is a genus and so it has lots of variation in its species.  i wouldn't know the species but my bro might.  If you can get me a photo, i'll forward it to him.

Ob9AZnA4aa	Make sure that when you use the 40x magnification that you can see plenty of bacteria against the stained background. Focus a large group of bacteria toward the center of the ocular lens, and then place a drop of the immersion oil. Usually when you move to 100x magnification then you will see nearly perfect. If not, don't move the stage since you have already focused on a group and just use the fine resolution knob to adjust until you see whatever bacteria you were looking for. I had the same problem for a while as well, but I was really just being impatient and rushing through things. Good luck!

A escala quer dizer que cada unidade medida na maquete (1) equivale a x unidades reais.<br>  Por exemplo, 1:200 significa que se você medir 1 cm na maquete, a medida real é 200; 2 cm, a medida real é 400; 5cm, a medida real é 1000 cm e assim por diante.<br>  Ent?o, dados:<br>  1 : x = 1 / x = propor??o: medida maquete / medida real<br>  P = 1,8 cm (tamanho da porta na maquete)<br>  P' = 2,70 m = 270 cm (tamanho real da porta)<br>  CUIDADO com as unidades (veja P')<br>  1 / x = P / P'<br>  1 / x = 1,8 / 270<br>  x = 270 / 1,8<br>  x = 150<br>  <br>  b) A escala da maquete é, ent?o: <br>  1 : 150<br>  <br>  OBS: note, no item a), que caso você tivesse convertido<br>  1,8 cm para metros (0,018 m) e mantivesse a altura real em metros (2,7m) sua resposta também iria dar x = 150. Note que x n?o tem unidade (cm, m, etc.) porque ao dividir as duas medidas você também simplifica as unidades, (m com m; cm com cm; etc) ok?<br>  <br>  3) O perímetro (P) de qualquer circunferência é igual ao comprimento (C) da circunferência, ou seja:<br>  P = C = 2.pi.r<br>  r = 10cm (raio da circunferência)<br>  pi = 3,14 (aproximadamente)<br>  Ent?o:<br>  P = 2.3,14.10<br>  P = 62,8 cm<br>  <br>  4) Mesma fórmula anterior, dado P = 5 cm<br>  (o "r" na sua quest?o em "5 r cm" provavelmente foi erro de digita??o)<br>  Ent?o:<br>  P = 2.pi.r<br>  5 = 2.3.14.r<br>  r = 5 / 6,28<br>  r = 0,80 (aproximadamente)<br>  <br>  5) Aqui você faz o seguinte:<br>  mede o comprimento (ou perímetro) total da circunferência.<br>  Faz uma regrinha de 3: se P equivale a 360o, ent?o "A" equivalerá a 60o, onde "A" é o comprimento do arco que você quer determinar, entendeu?<br>  Ent?o:<br>  P = 2.pi.r<br>  P = 2.3.14.5<br>  P = 31,4 cm<br>  Agora:<br>  360o --- 31,4<br>  ..60o --- A<br>  Multiplicando cruzado:<br>  360.A = 31,4.60<br>  A = 31,4.60 / 360<br>  A = 5,23 cm (aproximadamente)<br>  <br>  6) Provavelmente vc quer saber o perímetro (ou comprimento da roda, ou ent?o o raio da roda, né?<br>  Ent?o:<br>  1 volta completa equivale a 2.pi.r<br>  10 voltas completas equivalem a 10.2.pi.r = 20 m<br>  Ent?o<br>  10.2.pi.r = 20<br>  2.pi.r = 20 / 10<br>  2.pi.r = 2 m<br>  P = 2.pi.r = 2 m<br>  Ent?o, o comprimento da roda vale 2m;<br>  O raio "r":<br>  2.pi.r = 2<br>  r = 2 / 2.3,14<br>  r = 0,3185 m = 31,85 cm (aproximadamente)<br>  Ok?<br>  Espero ter ajudado!|`|otSpNzZsaa	1) o maior lado de A'B'C' é 5, q é 5x menor que 25.<br>  ent?o, os lados de ABC s?o:<br>  3*5=15<br>  4*5=20<br>  5*5=25<br>  <br>  Ele é triangulo retangulo sim, pois, além de ser ser a amplia??o de um do tipo, seus lados obedecem ao teorema de pitágoras.<br>  152+202=252<br>  225+400=625<br>  <br>  <br>  2) A escala é de 1,8:2700 = 1:1500<br>  <br>  A) 1 cm na maquete representa 1500 cm na realidade, o equivalente a 1,5m<br>  <br>  b) 1:1500<br>  <br>  <br>  3) P= 2(pi)r<br>  P=20(pi)<br>  <br>  4) 5(pi)=2(pi)r<br>  r=5(pi)/2(pi)<br>  r=2,5 cm<br>  <br>  5) O perímetro é 2*5(pi)=10(pi)<br>  <br>  O arco corresponde a 1/6 do perímetro da circunferência, pois 60°/360° é 1/6. ent?o, o comprimetno do arco é 10/6=5/3<br>  <br>  6) vc terminou de digitar essa quest?o?<br>  <br>  <br>  a pergunta de ve ser qual o diametro da roda.<br>  diametro = 2 vezes o raio<br>  <br>  se 10 voltas corrrespondem a 20m, ent?o a o comprimento da circunferência da roda é 2m.

DnarhXL6aa	Revolu??o Francesa é o nome dado ao conjunto de acontecimentos que, entre 5 de Maio de 1789 e 9 de Novembro de 1799, alteraram o quadro político e social da Fran?a. Em causa estavam o Antigo Regime (Ancien Régime) e a autoridade do clero e da nobreza. Foi influenciada pelos ideais do Iluminismo e da Independência Americana (1776). Está entre as maiores revolu??es da história da humanidade.<br>  <br>  A Revolu??o é considerada como o acontecimento que deu início à Idade Contemporanea. Aboliu a servid?o e os direitos feudais na Fran?a e proclamou os princípios universais de "Liberdade, Igualdade e Fraternidade" (Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité), frase de autoria de Jean Nicolas Pache.<br>  <br>  Terminaram os privilégios da nobreza e do clero, um primeiro passo no sentido do igualitarismo. é importante lembrar que a Revolu??o Francesa semeou novas ideologias na Europa, conduziu a guerras, mas foi até certo ponto derrotada pela tentativa de retornar aos padr?es políticos, sociais e institucionais do Antigo Regime através de um movimento denominado de Restaura??o ou Contra-Revolu??o. Nesse período, o rei francês Luís XVIII outorgou a seus súditos uma Carta Constitucional.<br>  <br>  A Revolu??o Francesa pode ser subdividida em quatro grandes períodos: a Assembléia Constituinte, a Assembléia Legislativa, a Conven??o e o Directório.<br>  <br>  <br>  Na wikipedia tem tudo, dá uma olhada.

HUfkS4jBaa	Personally, I would take geometry at school. Having a teacher who knows geometry very well and teaches well is much more beneficial than trying to understand the subject and teach it to yourself. And taking 4 days to learn an entire school year's worth of geometry obviously is going to leave you in the dark about a lot of the parts of geometry. Trust me, go with a teacher.|`|4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	Just take the full Geometry course.  You're not going to learn it as well if you try cramming it, and with no instructor along the way.

Q0jUU7A5aa	ASSUMPTION: P is different from p.    NOTE: In algebra, a capital letter is different from a lowercase letter.  If you include both, they are considered two different variables.    P + (1/2)pv2 + pgy = A    Subtract (1/2)pv2 + pgy from both sides.  P + (1/2)pv2 + pgy - (1/2)pv2 - pgy = A - (1/2)pv2 + pgy  P = A - (1/2)pv2 + pgy    ANSWER: P = A - (1/2)pv2 + pgy    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    If you meant the problem to be the following instead:  p + (1/2)pv2 + pgy = A    Factor out the p.  p[1 + (1/2)v^2 + gv] = A    Divide both sides by (1 + (1/2)v^2 + gv).  p[1 + (1/2)v^2 + gv] / [1 + (1/2)v^2 + gv] = A / [1 + (1/2)v^2 + gv]  p = A / [1 + (1/2)v^2 + gv]

vmu2LlzMaa	I'm thinking  2 is interphase. The cells are newly formed and should not mitose right away, but should begin producing all the proteins they need to function properly. After all, cells spend most of their time in interphase just being cells.    For  3, mitosis is the process that allows organisms to grow (by making more cells) and heal (by making new cells).

8Y7LQ6TGaa	you cannot use a voltage divider in a power supply. Power supplies have to function over a range in currents, and a voltage divider is accurate only for output currents that are very small compared to the current in the divider.    To drop 15 volts to 10 volts with 25 ma in the divider, the upper resistor is 5/25 or 200 ohms. The lower resistor is twice that or 400 ohms.    Put 100 ohms in parallel with 400, and the equivalent R is 100*400/500 = 80 ohms, and the voltage out is 15*80/(80+200) = 4.29 volts.    100k in parallel with 400 is 100000*400/100400 = 398 ohms, and output of the divider is 15*398/(398+200) = 9.99 volts    .

bRfLyvPIaa	One conclusion is that as the plant density increases in crowded populations, the growth of individual plants in that populations goes down. In other words, crowding reduces the growth of individual plants.    At very high densities, the plants self-thin. In other words some or many of the plants will die because of the competition. This happens because it gets to the point where the only way a plant in the population can grow is if another plant dies.    The maximum density of a stand is related to the average size of plant in the stand. If you plot (log) plant size over (log) plant density you get a straight line with a slope of about -1.3. This is called the negative 3/2 power law of the self-thinning rule.    If that's not clear, maybe the sources below will help.

dcad165e854398e10737e5820aad0606aa	Both of these problems are exercises in the fact that if a Force F has the form <br>  <br>  F = Ax,<br>  <br>  the work done in compressing something from a state of zero compression will be <br>  <br>  1/2 A (x_f)^2, <br>  <br>  where x_f is the final value of x.<br>  <br>  That's because a small element dW of work done is given by <br>  <br>  dW = F dx,<br>  <br>  and the TOTAL WORK DONE, W is the INTEGRAL of F dx between x = 0 and x = x_f. ###<br>  <br>  Now to the two problems:<br>  <br>  1. In this case x_f = 40mm = 40/10^3m = 4*10^(-2)m.<br>  <br>  So 1/2 A (x_f)^2 = 1/2*5*10^5*16*10^(-4)Nm = 40*10Nm <br>  <br>  = 400 Joules.<br>  <br>  2.  In this case x_f = 11cm = 1.1*10^(-1)m.<br>  <br>  So 1/2 A (x_f)^2 = 1/2*4.1*10^3*1.21*10^(-2)Nm = 24.805Nm <br>  <br>  = 24.805 Joules, or 24.8 Joules to perhaps still more than justifiable accuracy. <br>  <br>  Live long and prosper.<br>  <br>  ### Note that the next responder unfortunately did not account for the VARIABILITY of the force, which starts out with a strength ZERO, and increases linearly with x.  His result essentially assumed that the answer would be a constant force equal to the final force, multiplied by the entire distance.  That is clearly wrong in general for ANY variable force.  In the present case of a linear increase, such an approach will ALWAYS give TWICE the correct answer.|`|HUfkS4jBaa	1.) Work is a product of a force acting upon something over a distance. So, using that definition, we get the equation W = F*D, with force being in Newtons and the distance being in meters. Since the force is equal to 500,000x, with x being .040 meters, we get a result of F = 20,000. This force is acting on a distance, the compression of the bumper, so it is doing work. To find the work, we just plug the variables into W = F*D, or W = 20000 * .040, or 800 Joules of work.<br>  <br>  2.) The same applies for this example. The foam is doing work on the woman as the woman is doing work on the foam. Since x is in meters, the Force is equal to 4100 * .11, or 451 Newtons. The foam is doing work on the woman over .11 meters, so we plug our variables into W = F * D to get 50 Joules of work.

You start with digesting the DNA of interest with  restriction enzymes, clone the DNA and put into plasmids, transform bacteria with plasmids (typically E. coli are used), selectively grow the bacteria and figure out which plasmids have the DNA insert, sequence that DNA..many more steps and failed attempts...then a Elephant. Really this is a rather simplified version of how to clone, but your answer looks correct.

Infatti se essi non ci fossero, l'ossigeno verrebbe in poco tempo consumato da noi organismi eterotrofi (animali, funghi, alcuni batteri...), che infatti non potremmo esistere senza i produttori di ossigeno.<br>  <br>  Quindi nello spazio l'ossigeno molecolare è presente solamente in ridottisiime tracce, mentre nello spazio aperto si può considerare del tutto assente (un atomo per metro cubo, come detto sopra, è praticamente considerabile vuoto assoluto).|`|76SWEvgiaa	Ma che cretinate dici??? non c'è ossigeno nello spazio perchè non ci sono ne acqua ne vegetali, infatti c'è l'ossigeno sulla terra appunto perchè ci sono molte foreste, le quali, con la fotosintesi, liberano ossigeno nell'atmosfera.

9Wi2eNInaa	Isentropic is where the disorder (entropy) of the system stays constant through the change in conditions    This implies no energy is added to the system or taken away from it      Isothermal is where the temperature of the system stays constant through the process change you are making on it.    In isothermal you can go through an adiabatic expansion and if you direct the flow of the compressed air you mentioned above against turbine blades, then you could extract energy from the system and the system has produced work and the temperature of the system drops in exchange for this work.     If you let the compressed air exit without performing any work then it remains isothermal and equal to the isentropic process.     In other words if you let the flow of the compressed air exit without resistance or transfer into work (adiabatic expansion) then the flow of air is BOTH isothermal (no temperature change) and isentropic (no energy added or subtracted from system    Isothermal topic    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isothermal    Isentropic process  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isentropic_...

It all depends upon how detailed you wish to design the map.      The more features you include, the more detailed it will be and more complicated for you to make.  You may also concentrate upon making a physical or political map. A physical map will include geographic features such as: mountains, rivers and elevation.  A political map may omit the physical features and include boundaries, cities, capital cities, airports and highways.

Frlah9kYaa	First you find the time at which the stream would hit the building.  You obtain this by finding the x component of the velocity.    velocity in x direction = 40m/s cos(40 degrees) = 30.64 m/s    the water must travel 50m to hit the building so     d = vt  50m = 30.64m/s * t  t = 1.632 seconds    then you fill in for the distance equation    d = 1/2 at^2 + vt + x    in this equation your     x = 0 since you are at the bottom of the building  a= -9.81m/s^2  (gravity acting downward)  v= 40*sin(40 degrees)  (your velocity going up)  t= 1.632 seconds    v=25.712 m/s    d = .5*(-9.81) (1.632)^2 + (25.712)(1.632s)    d= 28.9 meters!|`|PcRFUvMQaa	Ignoring resistance:    Distance = Speed x Time    So horizontally the speed is 40 Cos 40 (Basic trig)    So the time it takes for the water to hit the building is 50/(40 cos 40)    Time = 50/(40 cos 40)    Vertically the speed of the water is 40 Sin 40    Now we know that s=ut + 1/2at^2 Where 'u' is the initial vertical velocity (40 Cos 50), 'a' is gravity (-9.81ms-2) and t is time (50/(40 cos 40))    So s (Height) = (40 Cos 50) x (50/(40 cos 40)) + 1/2 x -9.81 x (50/(40 cos 40))^2    s = 41.955 - 13.060 = 28.895m
9Wi2eNInaa	1) figure it this way. If you had no ramp , you would have to lift a 600N box 2m high, so it would take you 600N * 2m = 1200J of power    But with the ramp there it acts as a wedge to allow you to raise the same weight with less effort (but more distance than 2m)    So efficiency of ramp is 5m/2m = 2.5 mechanical advantage or 250% efficient.   Before you had to lift the box vertically 2 meters , now with the ramp you have to push it 5 meters, but with half the effort.    2) The question is wrote confusingly, but this is how I interpret it)  Without the pulley you would use a force of 120N to raise the object 40m. 120N * 40m = 4800 Joules of power to raise without a pulley    With the pulley it only takes 75N to raise the 120 N object so,  120N / 75N = 1.6 mechanical efficiency. But the way the question is asked I think it's in reverse so it's 75N / 120 N =62.5% efficient pulley

SwKPJRNvaa	Igneous- volcanic material- eg lava that solidifies. The slower the cooling period, the bigger the crystals. Granite with big minerals in it cooled over a long time, under the earth. Obsidian cools super fast, which is why it looks like glass      Sedimentary rocks are layers of sediment- usually from marine animals' shells, broken into grains and cemented together. They often form in layers under the sea, where the weight of the water helps fuse them into a granular rock. The layers will be visible in the rock, and are called 'bedding plains' eg Limestone    Metamorphic- sedimentary rock that has been compressed and changed underground, with lots of heat, resulting in a smoother, less granular rock- like Marble

Now, suppose y     (k-1)/N = k/N - 1/N >= y - 1/N > y - (y - x) = x    However, this contradicts our assumption that k is the least integer such that k/N > x.  So, y > k/N.

Deus criou o mundo do nada.<br>  <br>  A cria??o inteira é fruto do amor e onipotência de Deus: as coisas pequenas – ervas e insetos -, e as grandes: o sol, a lua, os sistemas planetários, as nebulosas, os mares.... O ser mais perfeito da cria??o visível é o homem. E Deus continua cuidando e governando tudo com Suas leis.<br>  <br>  Que linda é a Cria??o! Ao contempla-la é fácil dar glória e louvor a Deus. Além disso, Ele quer que nós, homens cooperemos com Sua obra com o nosso trabalho. é tanta a dignidade do trabalho humano, que, como diz a Sagrada Escritura, o homem foi criado para que trabalhasse e assim dominasse a cria??o de um modo inteligente.<br>  <br>  Neste tema veremos com detalhes o que significa afirmar que Deus tenha criado o mundo, tal como confessamos no Credo: "Creio em Deus, Pai Todo Poderoso, Criador do céu e da terra".<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  IDéIAS PRINCIPAIS.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  1. Deus é eterno. <br>  <br>  Só Deus é propriamente eterno, quer dizer, n?o tem princípio nem fim. Em Deus, n?o existe passado nem futuro, mas UM PRESENTE IMUTáVEL. Houve um momento no qual só Deus existia, mas Ele quis comunicar suas perfei??es a outros seres; quis criar o mundo e especialmente, o homem, que foi feito à imagem e semelhan?a de Deus. Deus pensou em todos os homens – em cada um de nós – muito antes de nos criar. N?o existíamos e já nos amava. E como Deus ama o homem, preparou para ele um lugar estupendo: o mundo com todas as suas maravilhas (o mar, as montanhas, os animais, as plantas, o céu etc..).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  2. Deus criou o mundo do nada. <br>  <br>  O homem necessita tempo e esfor?o para construir um edifício ou fabricar um objeto, além, é lógico, de um material pré existente. Deus, porém, fez todas as coisas com um só instante de Seu querer e tudo criou do nada. Antes de que Deus tudo criasse, n?o existia nada.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  3. Criar n?o é o mesmo que fabricar. <br>  <br>  Dizemos que Deus criou o mundo, e n?o que Deus fabricou o mundo, para indicar que, quando tudo come?ou a existir, n?o havia nada, sendo que foi Deus quem fez tudo, para que existisse. Criar quer dizer "fazer que exista algo que antes n?o existia, tirando-o do nada". O homem n?o pode criar, pode modificar, por exemplo, o curso de um rio, ou fabricar um tecido, usando para isto como matéria prima o algod?o ou fibras sintéticas, ou montar um carro, usando pe?as previamente fabricadas.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  4. Deus criou tudo para Sua glória e honra. <br>  <br>  Quando contemplamos uma obra de arte – uma catedral, por exemplo -, nos maravilhamos e louvamos o gênio de seu autor. Aquela obra de arte é uma glória aos que a construíram.<br>  <br>  Ao contemplar a grandeza do mundo: os astros, o mar, as plantas; ao ver a perfei??o das coisas pequenas: um passarinho, um inseto, nos maravilhamos e louvamos a Deus, autor de tudo. O mundo é uma manifesta??o da perfei??o divina, um reflexo do que Deus é. O mundo canta a glória de Deus. A esta glorifica??o deve unir-se o homem, n?o somente por ser criatura de Deus, a mais perfeita da cria??o visível, mas também porque Deus colocou todas as coisas a seu servi?o. Pensando no homem, Deus criou todas as coisas e as colocou em suas m?os.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  5. O trabalho e o domínio da terra. <br>  <br>  Deus podia ter criado todas as coisas tal e como existem; por exemplo, as mesas e as cadeiras, as centrais elétricas... Mas quis que o homem dominasse a cria??o trabalhando e tirando proveito das mesmas. Quando o homem trabalha, colabora com Deus para dominar a cria??o, já que Deus assim o desejou.<br>  <br>  E como na cria??o Deus fez tudo muito bem, porque é Deus e porque Lhe move o amor que tem aos homens, assim o homem precisa fazer bem as coisas, por amor a Deus, para que quando Deus veja esse trabalho, possa dizer: "O que faz o homem está bem feito". é necessário fazer tudo com dedica??o e esfor?o, oferecendo-o a Deus.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  6. Deus conserva e governa o mundo. <br>  <br>  Para que as coisas durem, procuramos conserva-las: reparam-se os defeitos, engraxam-se as máquinas, protegem-se do frio ou do calor...; se n?o cuidamos das coisas, elas se estragam e n?o servem mais para nada. Podemos imaginar assim a conserva??o do mundo, com a diferen?a de que, se Deus n?o o conservasse, desapareceria, voltaria ao nada.<br>  <br>  Além disso, Deus governa o mundo, de maneira especial aos homens, com umas leis que est?o impressas em sua natureza, respeitando sempre a liberdade que lhes deu, como um dos grandes presentes.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  7. Oferecer o trabalho do dia e mostrar agradecimento ao Senhor. <br>  <br>  Ao iniciar o dia devemos oferecer a Deus tudo o que vamos fazer. Podemos usar esta ora??o:<br>  <br>  "Adoro-Te, Meu Deus, e amo-te de todo o cora??o; dou-Te gra?as por me terdes criado, feito crist?o e conservado nesta noite. Ofere?o-Te todas as minhas obras e Te pe?o que me guardes neste dia de todo pecado e me livres de todo o mal. Amém"<br>  <br>  Para n?o comer como os pag?os que n?o conhecem a Deus, nós, crist?os, costumamos aben?oar a mesa e agradecer depois de comer. Podemos dizer, antes de comer:<br>  <br>  "Aben?oai, Senhor, estes alimentos que, por Tua bondade, vamos tomar".<br>  <br>  E ao terminar de comer:<br>  <br>  "Nós Te agradecemos, Senhor, pelos benefícios que recebemos de Tuas <br>  <br>  m?os."<br>  <br>  O agradecimento deve abarcar nossa vida inteira, que é um dom de Deus.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  8. Ter confian?a em Deus. <br>  <br>  O conhecimento da Providência que Deus exerce sobre o mundo e sobre cada um de nós, deve levar-nos a uma decis?o confiada de pormo-nos em Suas m?os, para que de verdade e para sempre seja Ele a fonte de nossa serenidade, seguran?a e alegria.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  9. Propósitos da vida crist?. <br>  <br>  Procurar fazer todas as manh?s o oferecimento do dia, ao levantar-se. Pode-se usar o Oferecimento do "Apostolado da Ora??o", por exemplo. <br>  <br>  Acostumar-se a oferecer a Deus tudo o que se faz, procurando fazer tudo com a maior perfei??o e amor possíveis.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Autor: Jayme Pujoll e Jesus Sanches Biela<br>  <br>  Fonte: Livro "Curso de Catequesis" do Editorial Palavra, Espa?a<br>  <br>  Tradu??o: Pe.
