Look up some of the published works by Heinreich Schleimann and see what he said... I don't think even Homer put a date on the ending of the war when he wrote about it.|`|AA12359885	Trojan Wars: The Story    The Story of the Trojan War in mythology is told through passages from Homer's Iliad and the works of other classic poets.     The war was waged against Troy by the Greeks and lasted for ten years. The war was caused by the abduction of Helen by Paris.    The war ended with the destruction of Troy.    http://www.2020site.org/trojanwar/    http://messagenet.com/myths/index.html    Homer, Odyssey    http://www.mythweb.com/odyssey/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/odyssey/    Study Guide for Homer's Odyssey    http://www.temple.edu/classics/odysseyho...

They usually derive from genealogies of kings. Ephorus gives 1135 BC, Sosibius 1172 BC, Eratosthenes 1184 BC/1183 BC, Plato 1193 BC, the Parian marble 1209 BC/1208 BC, Dicaearchus 1212 BC, Herodotus around 1250 BC, Eretes 1291 BC, while Douris 1334 BC. As for the exact day Ephorus gives 23/24 Thargelion (July 6 or 7), Hellanicus 12 Thargelion (May 26) while others give the 23rd of Sciroforion (July 7) or the 23rd of Ponamos (October 7).    The glorious and rich city Homer describes was believed to be Troy VI by many twentieth century authors, destroyed in 1275 BC, probably by earthquake.

A non-binding early action program is otherwise a good idea to take advantage of, because it offers a slightly better chance of getting admitted-- and even if you don't get admitted early, your application can still get deferred and considered for regular admission.

AA11033750	Hi Alex,    The work is pretty famous (especially because of the opening lines "These are the times that try men's souls") and I like everything by Thomas Paine because it's all rather short.    Basically, these works were arguing against the sunshine patriots - or the people who would only support Independence when it seemed like George Washington was winning. He said you have to be patriotic even when it looks like the cause is going badly. In fact, he said that victory would be even sweeter becaus it was so difficult to achieve.     That's the jist of it... He also used reason to try to show the British that their cause is unjust - there are several instances, but one thing you can do is go to this website:    http://www.ushistory.org/paine/crisis/in...    And select just parts of it (so you're not trying to read and remember the whole thing at once). Once you just take a paragraph or so, its easier to understand what he's saying. And basically every paragraph is just another block arguing the same point but using a different example. You'll be able to write 750 words in no time. Good luck.|`|1a9e4d57320cb7594a39fb95ad34cf07aa	The wikipedia article should help you out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_America...    Good Luck!!!

dli23MaRaa	Americans declared war on Britain on June 18, 1812, for a combination of reasonsoutrage at the impressment (seizure) of thousands of American sailors, frustration at British restrictions on neutral trade while Britain warred with France, and anger at British military support for tribes in the Ohio-Indiana-Michigan area. After war was declared Britain offered to withdraw the trade restrictions, but it was too late for the American "War Hawks", who turned the conflict into what they called a "second war for independence."    While the officially-stated reasons for declaring war were ending impressment, ending harrassment of mercantile shipping, and ending British military support for western native tribes, a major goal of the "war hawks" in the western and southern states was aggressive territorial expansion. The intent was to drive the British out of North America, and the Spanish out of Florida.          Please Help..!!

By declaring his marriage to Catherine as invalid, he would be free to marry anyone he chose and produce a son to rule.|`|7e65bd3473e9aa8cd8ea06a582515c8baa	Henry VIII was a devout Catholic prior to his breaking with the RCC.  In fact, so obedient a monarch was he that the Pope bestowed upon him the honor of "Protector of the Faith" (a title still carried by England's monarchs).  However, as a boy he had been married to Catherine of Aragon, the daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella.  She was 9 years older than he and had trouble carrying their children to term.  She bore only one child who survived, infancy,t he Princess Mary.  Hernry wanted a son to carry on the secession.  After attempting to get an annulment of his 20 year marriage on the grounds that he had been "deceived," and that Catherine was barren, he determined to break from the RCC.  Since Catherine was the daughter of the Crusader King & Queen (the monarchs who had thrown the Moors out of Spain), he got no sympathy from Rome.  He also could not outright kill her for political reasons.  Instead, he broke with the church, got HIS clerics to annul the marriage and locked her away in a convent.  Then he married Anne Boleyn, who also did not bear him a son (she was the mother of Queen Elizabeth) and met an untimely end at the guillotine.|`|5uWQlZvMaa	Because he wanted a male heir, and his wife Katherine wasn't giving it to him.

The Church of England continuned to use the tridentine Mass in Latin and it's priests remained catholic. Edward the sixth and Elizabeth the first changed and watered down the Prayer Book but it remains a close translation of the Canonical Hours and Compline most notibliy in the service of Evening Prayer. Anybody who calls the Church of England protestant has not read the book of common prayer. The opening verse of St Athenausuias Creed begins, " Whosoever shall be saved must believe in the Catholick Faith" . The creed in the Eurcharist reads, " we believe in one Holy and Aposltolic Church". If the Anglican Church is protestant why has it kept the Catholic orders of Bishop, Priest and Deacon, and why does my local church have a full english tridentine Mass with the Gloria, Credo, Suram Corda, Santus and Angus Dei on a Sunday. Protestant? The word is not mentioned in any Anglican ligurtry. Protestants are Methodists and Baptist etc as they do not beleive in Apostolic Succession.

AA10829462	I don't quite understand the question but the hydrogen bonding does make water have 'special' properties such as boiling points and densities. Will leave the rest up for you to research but hope that helps.     (hint: compare with other similar formula)    Same as e-mail:  I've been reading the question again but I am still unsure what exactly what the proffesor asks but I think the question is asking what special properties arise from the hydrogen bonds.    So if I was answering it myself I would talk about the following:     1. structure of ice: normally solids have higher densities than liquids. However ice floats on water. This is due to hydrogen bonding.    2. when the boiling point of group VI hydrides are compared water has an anomalous high boiling point (compared to H2S, H2Se, H2Te). Again this is caused by the hydrogen bonds.     Maybe the proffesor wants you to deduce these facts from basic theories?     Anyway hope the above helps and obviously do elaborate on the above points. I don't know a lot of chemistry so there may be other things to talk about but I would have thought these two points were the main things to talk about.

XieAkrxgaa	Well first things first don't overwhelm yourself you can't be productive if you feel weighed down.  During my summers I take classes at my community college it's really not bad at all! The only difference between your community college and your state college would be the size of it and that not all of the professors have their Ph. D in  education; which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Next if I were you I would set small goals for myself, like if you are preparing for an exam try to break the study material into chunks that will take no more than 30 mins to look over and memorize.  Then after you have studied over it go back and quiz yourself on it and if you have any wrong then take a break and review it again.  What always keeps me positive is knowing that my final goal is that much closer to being achieved and I only focus on my goal and what I want for myself.  You could also try this to stay positive.  The worst thing you can do is not believe in yourself  it is what you want it to be in the end.  Keep your head up and good luck!|`|nDp80kTTaa	yeapp summer is cummin up real quick and i got experience ...bot to be summer lovin' haha ..my email is dammytammy@yahoo.com-- contact me and i shall tell u the ways my darling friend|`|AA10024908	get job. maybe hooker?stripper? hey, it pays|`|adHCIStXaa	community college is the same as any other college... is just the name that people judge... community college is really good.. it saves alot of money.. the teacher are helpful.. it has many courses to pick.. cheer up! =) there are many good things in life that you still didnt explore yet~~!!!

That is a gift well worth waiting for.   :-)|`|oWvvH83aaa	Well, Im a male teacher in my early 30s and I also like to play games and am athletic.

LXTA56rVaa	University of the Pacific is certainly a good school. They are pretty strong in computer science and they dont have visual communication as a major, but they do have just communication. Have you toured around UOP yet? If not they will have an open house soon(around oct. or nov). UC Berkeley have a national reputation, but UOP does not. I have heard of some stories of computer science majors at UOP before. They did some co-ops during their course of study and they had a job offer for him before he graduated.  UOP is very good at helping their students look for jobs, but Berkeley is so big that it is not really possible to do that for their students. UOP focuses more on the students as it is a private college. Tuition is higher but if you qualify for FAFSA it will be quite cheap. You can also try to apply for the CIP program if you are 1st generation college student. There are many benefits of attending this institution. Transfering from delta to either schools are pretty easy, but I think you still have to work on your personal statment. Right now maybe you dont have to worry about it yet. You still have time. If you do end up with a hard time choosing, then you can always go to the transfer/career office and seek for advice there.     Hope this may help you! Good luck!
yqPd4NZoaa	If you are mexican.. FREE!|`|2sSxraICaa	Unreal!!|`|XgcwFyHLaa	a lot!!!    On a typical college, tuition is going up anually at 4 to 8% per year, so lets do the math!!!    My University, Florida International University in Miami, Florida charges $3,500 for spring and fall (excluding summer semesters), dont forget a guaranteed extra hike of 3% somewhere to make up for inflation    At a mere 4% hike a year, FIU's tuition will double in 25 years to 6,500 a year (excluding summer semmester), plus if you add built in inflation charges, its more likely to be over $7,000 USD.    That does not include textbooks (going up all the time) and school supplies and gas, or living in the dorm)    If your kid will live at home, then add to those $7,000 an additional 4,000 in textbooks and school expenses to be on the safe side    so $11,000 a year for a state University (based on Florida tuition >)    **oh yeah, if your kid goes to the spring semester, add an extra $4,000 to it, so then plan for $15,000 a year    One more thing, if you send your child far away to college, typical dorm rooms  are around $8,000 to $12,000 a year.  If they double in cost, as college tuition will in those 25 years, then plan on pending around $24,000 for dorm plus $15,000 for tuition and costs per full year (calcualted using Florida rates, will vary per state)    A total of  $ 39,000 per year if your kid stays in the University dorms (cheaper to stay at home, only $15,000 USD in 25 years) *** This is for instate students, for out of state students, they usually have to pay double, so keep that in mind.    If he plans to go to Harvard, more like $90,000 a year by then!!  *excluding dorms and textbook expenses (current rates for Harvard are around 46,000 USD    Hope this helps, good luck!!!

LXTA56rVaa	It is a good thing. This means that you can enter and not have to take those certain courses, which will end up saving you tons of money per unit! It really depends on how many a student takes. A full time student is usually taking 12-18 units. Having that many units already through the AP testing means that you can have a potential status as a Sophomore in college.    Hope this will help and clear some things up as well!

You don't need to be anything and everything to get into a decent college or university.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is be a well-rounded student and take part in a few activities and clubs throughout the year and be in a "leadership position" in one.  As long as you have good grades and ACT/SAT scores you will be fine. They won't really care that you ride horses or play soccer unless you are THE BEST at it.<br>  <br>  The most important thing you can do is to have fun while you are in high school; do not take part in any school club or outside activity that you do not enjoy just because you want to pad your resume.

a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	Most students apply while they are Juniors in high school.  This gives them adequate amount of time to do campus visits, take the ACT/SAT, and to work on raising their GPA by senior year if need be.  Now, this does not mean that you are too far behind to even consider college.  Some students apply first or second semester of Senior year and some wait until they are out of high school before they apply.  It will all depend on you, your academic aspirations, and what you want to do once you are graduated from high school.  You could choose to wait until Spring (January) semester to apply and enroll in classes or you could even wait a year or two and get work experience.  You apply to college when you know in your heart that going is the right thing for you to do.

AA12290185	Dodge City, Kansas  Circa 1876    "Fancy A Swim?"    Kitty Russell was just settling down for the night. The Long Branch had definitely seen it's share of rowdy cowboys this particular evening. Why..... Some of them had seemed like MONSTERS!! Kitty got in bed tossing and  turning, unable to settle down.  In the old days, when she and Matt Dillon were going together, she would have said to him,"(3) A little help here please, " when she was having trouble falling asleep. He would always soothe her with his loving,baritone voice and massage her neck and shoulders. Kitty stared up at the ceiling, with tears in her eyes...... "Oh , Matt....Here I lay in my lonely bed....Unable to sleep... Totally broken hearted. YOU, on the other hand, are resting quite nicely with that horrible hillbilly from Virginia,  with the insatiable sex drive!!!........ GAWD how I hate the wench!!" ( Matt had left her for Sunshine MacGillicutty.)  It was a hot evening........ Kitty splashed some water on her face. She imagined swimming in a cool lake.... These thoughts drifted into her subconscious, producing QUITE a harrowing nightmare!!    The next morning, Kitty awoke with a start. Drenched in sweat  and tangled in her sheet, she crawled out of bed.... "Dear LORD, what a DREAM!!!" She dressed quickly and went downstairs, still shaking from the the ghastly visions!!  Doc Adams was reading the morning paper and had a cup of coffee waiting fo her.  Doc: "Kitty! Good morning. Good heavens!! You look terrible!! Are you well?" Her hair was matted down with sweat and there were dark circles under her eyes.  Kitty:"Doc. I had one HELLUVA nightmare!!"  Doc:"(1) I told you not to eat pizza just before bed time. Did I NOT TELL YOU?!"  Festus Haggen walked in and came over to join them.  Kitty:"I know. I know. I look terrible. Doc has just enlightened me with the cheery news!!" Festus quietly poured himself some coffee and said NOTHING.  Doc: "Well....... What was the dream about?"  Kitty:"I was on a boat...... in a cove....... there was a ..........      A MONSTER in the water!"  Festus: " (4) Shiver me timbers !!"  Doc looked at Festus...."Please don't tell me your next contribution to this conversation is going to be, 'ARRG.' !! "  Festus: "Ya old SCUTTER!!" In a softer voice...."Go on, Miss Kitty. Don't mind Doc. He's jest a testy old buzzard!!"    Kitty continued.... Both Doc and Festus listened, slack-jawed!!  Kitty:"It was HORRIBLE DOC !! YOU MAKE THIS ALL GO AWAY! YOU MAKE IT ALL GO AWAY!!! "  Doc:" Kitty!!!! STOP IT!! You're starting to scare me!!  Kitty: "I'm starting to scare myself!!! Oh, Doc. Between losing Matt and this God awful dream..... I just want something I can never have!!"  Doc:"Forget it!!! It was only a dream. It's time for you to forget about Matt AND the dream and return to reality!"  Kitty:"(2) Reality ain't what it used to be, Doc." She slipped a little rotgut into her coffee. "Ever since Matt left me for Sunshine Mac MORON, I've got NOTHING! ZILCH! NADA!   I LIVE IN THE BOWELS OF HELL!!!"  Doc slapped her face!  Kitty: " OWWWW!!!"  Doc:"Snap out of it!! " He eyed her bottle of booze, stashed in her dress pocket...." (5) And how much would you say you had this morning?!"  Kitty pushed the bottle deeper in the dress folds and glared at him.  Festus: "Miss Kitty? (7) What's a nice girl like you doing with  a bottle of rotgut?"  Kitty:"Where the hell have YOU been these past few months??!! I haven't stopped poisoning myself since Matt dumped me!!" She belched and let out a horrible laugh.....  "MUAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW !!!"  Festus: "I've got myself a dandy idea! Why don't the three of us go yonder to that lagoon jest outside Hays City.... Have ourselves a little swim....Cool off and forget ALL about monsters."  Kitty:" (6) NOT ON YOUR LIFE!!"

"A little help here please!" she shrieked and Tamera reluctantly left the cute boy to go see what was going on.    "Shiver me timbers, shiver me timbers!" said a sqacking voice coming from the direction of the living room.    "You're brother got this ruddy parrot talking and it won't stop! And -- Timmy! I TOLD you not to eat pizza before bedtime!"    "But mom, we live in a pizza shop, it's natural that I would eat pizza 24/7..."    Tamera's mother sighed... "So, how's it going?" she directed this to her daughter. "Tips wise, how much would you say you had?"    "Reality ain't what it used to be, mom.

As Tamera went to bed after another rough day, she heard her brother creep in through her door, pizza in his mouth and Jeffery the parrot perched on his arm, looking as though he was about to scare Tamera awake with the annoying bird.    Tamera turned quickly, grabbing the bird and releasing it through the window, disregarding the shocked look on her younger brother's sauce-stained face.

When I was at university we had students from many different places, such as Japan, Germany, Bulgaria.  The only slight problem is that as our pre-university educational system is different to yours you'll probably need to check with the universities that you're interested in to see what their entrance requirements are (e.g. you might need to take certain classes).  If you drop the admissions department an email they should be able to let you know pretty quickly.|`|OrKLpzenaa	Why wouldn't you be able to?

2pxiK9waaa	I got size 1 binders and had one for each subject when I was in high school. I also got hard plastic binders that had a cloudy/seethruish cover. The regular traditional binders aren't very durable. Not like the plastic ones. It's much better on your back and your arms to have several small binders as opposed to one or two huge ones. Just get out your stuff in the morning from your locker and again after lunch.|`|PizXrl2oaa	the square ones..  :)|`|ivkGknUsaa	I don't know about you, but some of my teachers require binders to be use only for their class. We turn binders every quarter so I have like 3 binders. 3-ring binders are the most useful. A size 1 or 1/2 is good to bring everyday, just for organizing and piling up papers.

Lasx21sbaa	if this is just beginning, then you're being distracted by something (maybe a girl???) but it's none of my buisness...<br>  <br>  possibly the material is getting too hard but then again, you know how to get the answer.|`|tIz4TWBlaa	Maybe there is a way that the teacher taught you, that is quicker, and you aren't following it.<br>  That happened to me. I didn't finish the test because I wasn't using the quicker method.<br>  <br>  Also, as for your 82, maybe the teacher isn't giving as many grades as your other class. <br>  In Algebra I had 6 grades for the entire quarter. Everything is A's except for tests which are F's. (I don't test take very well). Which lands me with a D.<br>  <br>  Good luck :D|`|ZtL2SOmVaa	Review don't study.<br>  Do not bury your head into math to much.<br>  There are things to remember.<br>  But you can remember by doing.<br>  That is all you need to do and it works.<br>  My final mark is 100%.<br>  Take it from me.|`|leCSVYgAaa	This is a very difficult question to answer - the truth is you probably know the answer better than anybody else.<br>  <br>  After all, your grades indicate that you are obviously a capable student.  I don't know exactly how your grades are worked out but 82% in any subject is pretty good going.  In fact, at University level (in the UK, College level in the US) if you can get anything in the 80s you're in the very small percentage of top students!<br>  <br>  If you are doing well in general coursework and struggling in tests, it might simply be a case of the test/exam environment causing you anxiety which is affecting your performance.  Some students do well throughout the year, then struggle with the pressure of exams, other actually don't do so well throughout the year but are able to focus their minds on a specific goal of passing an exam and use whatever techniques they can to prepare for the test and achieve that goal.<br>  <br>  If you are struggling in tests, is it because the pressure of the test is getting to you, and distracting you from actually working on the problems?  Are you so afraid of failing that you are mentally working against yourself when actually you are quite capable?<br>  <br>  You say that you didn't finish your last test - can you think why this was?  Sometimes people spend too much time on their answers and try to be *too* detailed, when they don't need to.  If this is your problem then you need to focus on exactly what is being asked and get to the point in the most concise way, obviously without leaving out anything important.  In a maths test, it is probably more difficult to include unnecessary information than it is in say English, but not impossible.<br>  <br>  If you're not finishing because you are simply holding back and moving too slowly, you need to tell yourself that you *do* know your stuff and you need to be confident that what you are doing is correct.  With this confidence you will move through the test quicker.<br>  <br>  Don't dwell too long on one question either.  If you have 10 questions, it is better to answer all 10 and get one or two wrong, or not complete them, than to answer 6 questions thoroughly.  As a rule of thumb I always say that in any subject (but in some more than others), the first 50% of marks are the easiest.  An examiner will be looking for a number of basic points which you make, or basic steps which you take, and will award marks for workings and explanations.<br>  <br>  Even if you get the answer wrong, the examiner might be awarding say 3 marks for the method, and 1 for the answer, because they are testing you on your processing skills and ability to use the correct method.  Of course the right answer is important too, but if you've done everything else correct and have the last bit (ie. the answer) wrong, you will still get credit.<br>  <br>  The second 50% of marks are the harder 50%, and this is where examiners separate out the C students from the A students.  You need to work much harder to get all these marks, because many times these will involve something that is over and above the usual answers that examiners see every day.<br>  <br>  Again, in a maths test there might be more hard and fast rules, but certainly in something like English, History, or Law, there is a lot of personal opinion and analysis needed to gain you that second 50%, and nobody *ever* gets the full 100% anyway.<br>  <br>  So in a nutshell, you can earn the first 50% of marks on a question within a few minutes, but there is a law of diminishing returns.  The next few minutes might only earn you a further 20% of marks, and then after that you're really adding icing to the cake if you can squeeze out a few more percent.  In the meantime you are wasting time that could be used to gain the "easy" 50% of marks on the next questions.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you divide your time wisely, and make sure that you have a good (but not necessarily great) answer to *all* the questions, you are guaranteeing yourself a good base of marks and if necessary you can go back and elaborate on them during whatever time you have left over to get extra credit.<br>  <br>  This approach has always worked for me, but obviously you need to tweak your approach to fit your strengths depending on exactly what you want to achieve in any given situation.|`|05aKFYl5aa	your mind probably draws a blank or your pressured because of the limited class time you have.|`|KRJ7h8MYaa	Hmm...interesting. Yeah, that mark of 82 blows, eh? LOL.<br>  <br>  You state in your answer that "i forget a good portion of the information when i take the actual test"<br>  <br>  The thing is, with a course like algebra, sure, there are a few theories here and there to keep in mind while solving problems...but the key to success in any maths course really is practice, practice and more practice. There isn't really any "information" to remember (or forget, for that matter). It's all problem solving, and that's a process which should become second nature to you (I'm assuming that this is for high school, which should be a walk in the park anyway) after much practice.<br>  <br>  It's like playing a sport. When you step out to the plate to bat, you're not supposed to remember "information" about how to swing, which pitch to swing at, how to judge the trajectory of the ball, etc. If you're thinking of that stuff in a game situation, you're bound to fail. You practice, well, at practice, and that's when you think about this "information." When you get out to bat in a game, it's all supposed to become second nature. Otherwise, it's not going to work.<br>  <br>  All in all, methinks that perhaps you are placing too much emphasis on learning theory in Algebra than the actual process of problem solving. Perhaps you could ruminate over this for a while.

7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	It is the time between the sun setting and it getting completely dark.<br>  Not light enough to be daylight<br>  Not dark enough to be night.|`|6DFhlt4daa	The diffused light from the sky during the early evening or early morning when the sun is below the horizon and its light is refracted by the earth's atmosphere.<br>  The time of the day when the sun is just below the horizon, especially the period between sunset and dark.<br>  Dim or diffused illumination.<br>  A period or condition of decline following growth, glory, or success: in the twilight of his life.<br>  A state of ambiguity or obscurity.<br>  [Middle English twilighte : Old English twi-, two, half + Old English līht, light; see light1.]<br>  <br>  The period between sunset and darkness in the evening, and between darkness and sunrise in the morning. The characteristic light is caused by atmospheric scattering, which transmits sunlight to the observer for some time after sunset and before sunrise. It depends geometrically on latitude, longitude, and elevation of the observer, and on the time of year. Physically it depends also on local conditions, particularly the weather.<br>  <br>  Definition: onset of darkness<br>  Antonyms: daybreak, sunrise<br>  <br>  The periods of incomplete darkness following sunset and preceding sunrise. Twilight is designated as civil, nautical, or astronomical, as the darker limit occurs when the center of the sun is 6 degrees, 12 degrees, or 18 degrees, respectively, below the celestial horizon.<br>  <br>  period between sunset and total darkness or between total darkness and sunrise. Total darkness does not occur immediately when the sun sinks below the horizon because light from the sun that strikes the atmosphere is scattered (both by the air itself and by suspended matter, e.g., dust and smoke). Civil twilight ends when the center of the sun is 6° below the horizon. Although it is still not very dark, it is necessary to use artificial light to carry out most activities. Nautical twilight ends when the sun's center is 12° below the horizon; at about this time the light is too dim for the user of a sextant to see a sharp horizon. Astronomical twilight ends when the sun's center is 18° below the horizon; by this time even the faintest stars overhead can be seen. (Similar definitions apply to morning twilight.)<br>  <br>  Twilight is the time before sunrise (dawn), and the time after sunset (dusk). Sunlight scattered in the upper atmosphere illuminates the lower atmosphere, and the surface of the Earth is not completely lit or completely dark. The sun itself is not actually visible because it has not yet come over the horizon (sunrise) or it has passed below the horizon (sunset).<br>  <br>  Twilight is specifically defined as the period before daytime or after nighttime during which it is possible to conduct outdoor activities without the aid of artificial light.[1] Due to the unusual, romantic quality of the ambient light at this time, twilight has long been popular with photographers and painters, who refer to it as the "blue hour", after the French expression l'heure bleue.<br>  <br>  The collateral adjective of "twilight" is crepuscular (for daylight it is "diurnal" and for night, "nocturnal"). The term is most frequently encountered when applied to certain species of insects and mammals that are most active during that time.|`|gZ0NPuleaa	Half -light|`|utdHgNhOaa	Twilight is the time just before the sun finishes setting.

39srMGPqaa	I work for Everest College, and I'd like you to know that every campus has a Career Placement Office.      The Career Placement office is there to support you in trying to find a job upon graduation.  They'll help you with your interviewing skills, resume creation, and finding local job listings.      We'll do everything we can to help you on your job search.  Please call us anytime if you have any questions. Call 888-741-4270 if you have any questions.    BTW, every Everest campus is accredited. Check out the main website to find out what type of accreditation your particular campus has.|`|BNsPwKszaa	Yes. They are all about the money. They're not accredited, either. Why do you think tutition there is $10,000 for a 9 month program? The best Universities in the US don't even cost that much.    Don't go to a tech school. Go to a community college. Trust me.

FjMrNKneaa	If you enjoy reading as well as writing, English sounds like it would be your best fit.  Academic essays aren't as much fun as creative writing.  But you'll learn how to write effective arguments, and you'll read some of the best books, plays, and poems ever written and see what techniques worked - as well as what didn't.    History, Sociology, and Philosophy are also some majors that involve a lot of writing and hone in on your communication skills.    You should, if not major in it, take some Drama courses to boost your transcript.  Get involved in theatre at your college to get some more acting and/or directing experience.|`|oExob6lxaa	Major in a degree like language arts or english! Your going to be a writer. Take electives about writing books and movie in college, also.|`|4aiA2ReVaa	You should be  a screen writer, you know like for shows?

Midwestern  Mideast  Middling [not too hot, not too cold]  Midpoint [as in midpoint on a line]    2) Where would the following probably take place?:  "Would you like to send the package priority? Do they contents need to be insured?"    At a post office or a UPS store. Somewhere where a person is leaving a package for shipment.|`|U2KdP1y7aa	mid-line  mid-day  mid-morning|`|dji8alFWaa	Middle, midday, mid-term.    And the sentence could be taking place at a post office.|`|KSsLV2thaa	1) midterm midwinter midwife  2) That sounds like a question that would be asked at the Post Office or maybe UPS.|`|AA11815754	Midway: which has two meanings. A midway (noun) is the section of a fair where the rides are set up. Midway also means half way.    Mid-sentence: meaning in the middle of a sentance.     Mid-game: half way into a game.     :)    "Would you like to send the package priority? Do they contents need to be insured?"  You would be asked both of those things at a post office of course.
TQgqN8MZaa	The nematocystic sting toxin secreted from the tentacles of the dactylozooids, a mixture of enzymes, is a neurotoxin about seventy-five percent as powerful as cobra venom. The toxins contain a complex mixture of polypeptides and proteins including catecholamines, histamine, hyaluronidase, fibolysins, kinins, phospholipases and various hemolytic, cardiotoxic and dermatonecrotic toxins.    The most common result of contact with the man-of-war - the residual whip-like, red wavy, stringy welts on the skin from contact with the blue tentacle - is a painful papular-urticarial eruption. The lesions can last for minutes to hours, and the rash may progress to urticaria, hemorrhage, or ulceration
yiZ2qoOJaa	In the Odyssey, Odysseus' shipmates display greed. When Aelous granted Odysseus a bag of winds to help carry the men back to Ithaca, the shipmates, believing that there was gold in the back and Odysseus wasn't willing to share, opened the bag. This shows their greed.

GFXz4vlSaa	There is something about life that you need to understand, and the sooner the better... you have more rights than you think.  Go to the principals office and explain your dilemma.  The teacher is an employee of the school and has one job to do - to teach.  Not to degrade students, and make them feel the way you feel.  Demand an education.  Or ask for another teacher.|`|pAwn4YY6aa	Some teachers is just bitter u shouldn't worry about her liking u, u should just think about your grade as long as it doesn't affect your grade u shouldn't worry about it|`|cK768YMkaa	I know that this is probably very frusterating and discouraging for you.

If it gets really bad, I would tell your parents.|`|fef9fzxYaa	well..i have a friend whos teacher is something like that but he was more racist..he still i dunno picks on her in his class..n when assigning groups he makes her work alone..n well he was racist..so that explains a alot..she even told the principle but they all said hes the best teacher..but anyway u should confront her after class..ask her why are you after me..? u dont have to be proper ..so yea n if she doesnt explain well then go to the principle..n the students take ur side  so u have proof..my friend the students took the teachers side..so she was alone..but u have advantage..well or just talk so much that she wishes she hadnt said that..that she doesnt like students wh ddont talk..dont be nervous..everyone is on ur side..so dont worry..just be urself..hope it helps..

hbrpkJisaa	I have gone through the same exact problem recently. The teacher told us to study something totally different from what was on the test. I'm usually the one with the highest grade in the class and failing that test will bring my grade down drastically and i'm really mad about it. When I finished the test the teacher asked the class how was it. I first told the teacher what I really felt about it, and of course she explained how it was all my fault and she can't do anything about it. So what I would do is first talk to the teacher, just try to tell him or her how you feel. If that doesn't work out, talk to your parents or a family member. I talked to my brother and he said to get a group of students together, and to go to her boss which is the Principle and complain about it. In some cases it's not completely the teacher's fault.Did you study enough? It's kind of a hard thing to do because it's a final and grades are already in( for me it is). So you could try this and hopefully it will work out. Good luck : )

No matter how much of a good idea you think it, no matter how well you think you can seriously justify studying at Disney...    ...unless you're going there to become an animator, you are wasting your time and money.|`|ac98e6026be07d715dc40ec8a2dfe2cfaa	I agree with the first poster, go to a regular college because in the end it'll feel like wasted time and money since no employer outside of Disney will ever take you and your degree seriously, just be lucky if they don't start laughing either.

AffmPx1aaa	Ahab needed revenge on the white whale Moby Dick.  Here are some indications that he was obsessed.    -It was an all encompassing endeavor for him.      -Everthing he did revolved around killing the whale.      -He was not capable of showing any concern for anything else.      -He put a false blame on a creature that hadn't intentionally hurt him.    -He was willing to (and eventually did) sacrifice everything to have his revenge
wgFZGMEtaa	Well, those letters of recommendation can be saved for a school that actually uses them, the UC;s don't.   You have a very good GPA, decent SAT II's, decent clubs and extra curriculars.  You should be applying to UCLA, UCB, UCSD, and maybe Irvine or Davis or Santa Barbara as a backup.  You will get into at least 3 of the aforementioned.  You should already be guaranteed a UC spot due to your ELC status.  Good Luck|`|mfGrpxEAaa	ucla and berkley probably not...probably not ucsd but the rest your probably going to get into fine.|`|3a827c8f65201304f6aa82c6d68a323eaa	Good GPA, but your SAT scores are low for Berkeley, LA and SD, 250 points below average on the SATI for the first 2. So those probably won't happen unless you have something else they're looking for--inner city under performing high school, low income and first generation to go to college....those thing would give you a chance.    Your score is about 50 points below average at SB, I and D, but given your high GPA you should get into some of those and all the others.    This is a tough year though, the UCs are taking fewer freshmen than in past years because of the budget crisis so no guarantee.

v5SXqxo0aa	Your scores from ninth grade ARE NOT COUNTED for the entire UC system. They will look at the courses you took, but will not consider the grades in your GPA.    That said, you will need to take 3 years of high school math (starting from Algebra 1) for the UC system, and you will probably want 4 for UCLA. If you are in Geometry ninth grade, you probably took Algebra already; that means you will need at least Algebra 2 in tenth grade before you are done with the requirement. And UCLA will most likely want you to have at least trig, since most of their applicants are done with Calculus AB and a large number Calc BC.    Believe me, there is no way you'll be able to pass trig with a D in geometry. Repeat that over the summer; you need a firm grounding. You might be able to evade Bio for the rest of your life if you do not plan on taking a Bio related major (meaning no medical careers).    Good luck!    P.S. Chocochip above is perhaps from a different country- in the US, sophomore and junior year are the most important; Your senior grades will hardly count, since UC deadlines are in November, before 1st semester grades are turned in.    Also, the average GPA for UCLA is 4.1 (weighted)- you need to crack down on your classwork to meet this.|`|bSI6cuNaaa	probably dude   stay in school,study more|`|4Ur1upNjaa	where did you go to school? im in New York in 10th grade and we're doing biology and geometry this year, in 9th grade we had algebra and earth science.      and to answer your question, you should go to try and get the score better so you have a better chance of getting in.|`|WG4gBgKjaa	I would suggest taking them again and getting at least a B in those classes just to be safe.|`|NAiNQtjhaa	Yes, I read they won't take less than a 4.0 gpa (crazy!) A lot of people apply there- a lot. You could start at a smaller University and get a high gpa there- then you could transfer.|`|Kr388jfQaa	If you're trying to get into a High School, then it will affect you a bit.  They will most likely put you at a easier level of the subject you want to go into, and from there, you have to finish that course, and then re-do the normal course. Of course, you don't always have to complete the normal course, it all depends on what post-secondary programs you plan on taking. (some programs don't require pure math for ex.)  If you're wondering if these marks will affect your chances of getting into an university, then no. Post-secondaries only look at your Gr. 12 and sometimes Gr.11 marks. So don't sweat it.|`|qGTNMtsraa	Yes, most likely. Otherwise you can always go to community college, get a solid GPA and transfer to UCLA.

ODU3TO4Eaa	Okay. If it's family-personal, have a parent write a letter to the principal (they will probably need to do this anyway). The principal (if he is a nice principal) will help you with the teacher part. If this is not the case, just politely tell your teachers that there was a family emergency and you're sorry you missed class.    If it's so personal that you can't even involve your parents, try talking to your guidance counselor. If you're uncomfortable doing that, just say something vague like "A lot of stuff came up and I couldn't make class. I'm sorry, can you help me catch up on what I missed?"    Tell your friends that "it's really complicated" and you "can't explain it all right now". Then quickly change the topic to football (or whatever your favorite sport is). =)    Good luck!  ?JoJo|`|pSnIDBP5aa	can you somehow incorporate your parents into this or is it reaaaally personal?

They have a pretty good collection to choose from.|`|8078b060eeeeedad269ae982e11dfc38aa	|        Aphorisms or "Universal Truths"    The only difference between an ordeal and an adventure is attitude.  Mary Barnett    It is in the character of very few men to honor without envy a friend who has prospered.      Aeschylus      We often give our enemies the means of our own destruction.      Aesop      Beware lest you lose the substance by grasping at the shadow.      Aesop      If you don't have time to do it right you must have time to do it over.      Anonymous      You cannot teach a crab to walk straight.      Aristophanes      The least initial deviation from the truth is multiplied later a thousandfold.      Aristotle      Nature does nothing uselessly.      Aristotle      A great city is not to be confounded with a populous one.      Aristotle      Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.      Berthold Auerbach        Nostalgia is a seductive liar.      George W. Ball      The more you judge, the less you love.      Honore de Balzac       Passion is born deaf and dumb.      Honore de Balzac       Memory is the greatest of artists, and effaces from your mind what is unnecessary.       Maurice Baring      Half the work that is done in the world is to make things appear what they are not.      E.R. Beadle      Good semse about trivialities is better than nonsense about things that matter.      Max Beerbohm       Brevity is power.      Josh Billings       The rarest thing a man ever duz iz the best he can. [sic]      Josh Billings       Love looks through a telescope; envy through a microscope.      Josh Billings       Advice is like castor oil, easy enough to give but dreadful uneasy to take.      Josh Billings       What is now proved was once only imagined.      William Blake      Glory is fleeting, but obscurity is forever.      Napoleon Bonaparte      What you really value is what you miss, not what you have.      Jorge Luis Borges      My riches consist not in the extent of my possessions, but in the fewness of my wants.      J. Brotherton      Health is the greatest gift, contentment the greatest wealth, faithfulness the best relationship.      Buddha      The course of true anything does not run smooth.      Samuel Butler      An angry man opens his mouth and shuts his eyes.      Cato The Elder      We live in a rainbow of Chaos.      Paul Cezanne      Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all.      Dale Carnegie      In some cases, non-violence requires more militancy than violence.      Cesar Chavez      When a lot of remedies are suggested for a disease, that means it cannot be cured.      Anton Chekhov      The way to love anything is to realize that it might be lost.     --G. K. Chesterton      A closed mind is like a closed book: just a block of wood.     --Chinese Proverb      It is a curious thought, but it is only when you see people looking ridiculous that you realize just how much you love them.     --Agatha Christie      Success is never final.      Winston Churchill      Courage is what it takes to stand up and speak; courage is also what it takes to sit down and listen.     --Winston Churchill      A bridge has no allegiance to eithr side.      Les Coleman       By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.      Confucius      When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it--this is knowledge.      Confucius      Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors.      Confucius      History is a vast early warning system.      Norman Cousins      A good book has no ending.      R.D. Cumming      Youth is a blunder; Manhood a struggle; Old Age a regret.      Benjamin Disraeli      There is an art of reading, as well as an art of thinking, and an art of writing.      Isaac Disraeli      Our deeds follow us, and what we have been makes us what we are.      John Dykes      The environment is everything that isn't me.      Albert Einstein      Imagination is a poor substitute for experience.      Havelock Ellis      The only reward of virtue is virtue; the only way to have a friend is to be one.      Ralph Waldo Emerson      So much of our time is preparation, so much is routine, and so much retrospect, that the path of each man's genius contracts itself to a very few hours.      Ralph Waldo Emerson      It is impossible for a man to be cheated by anyone but himself.      Ralph Waldo Emerson      He who has a thousand friends has not a friend to spare,  And he who has one enemy will meet him everywhere.      Ralph Waldo Emerson      The education of the will is the object of our existence.      Ralph Waldo Emerson      Of all the things which wisdom provides to make us entirely happy, much the greatest is the possession of friendship.      Epicurus

The things that real do matter to them...they won't tell you.  The things that are important they keep to themselves.  Don't listen to what they are saying, listen and try to hear between the lines.  Figure out what they are hiding and trying to say...but are too afraid to actually say.  (The important things they can't tell you)    Its from a famous poem by Charles C Finn.    In short: read between the lines.  Figure out my hidden message and not the actual words I'm saying.|`|K9bBMReUaa	it means that what he is telling you is meaningless and he is not telling you anything important. you shouldn't listen to what he is saying on the outside, but rather, read between the lines. (it's the art of silence)|`|rJVdLlTEaa	It's from the poem by Charles C. Finn and when one reads the whole piece, one gets the sense of a person trapped in the roles and appearances which s/he wants others to see. On one hand, it refers to everyone -- somehow we all have our insecurities and we wish others to see us a certain way. We wear our masks and the mask is actually nothing, though at the same time it is everything, because, for one thing, it's what the world sees and at the same time, it betrays our espousal of the untrue... it's a testament to all the fear simmering underneath.  If we were to attach an image to these words, perhaps a mask would serve us well -- A mask tells everything and yet nothing -- It speaks of what the wearer wants to be and how s/he wishes to be perceived.  When I read the poem I was reminded of actors --- they have to put up facades and keep up appearances. But really, when we mull over it, the last line of the poem states it clearly and succinctly -- every man... and every woman... you meet.

8zHRlvH6aa	O_o Does it have to be from this specific movie? IF not, then get... Uhhm... Hell.... Wtf was I going to say?|`|XiZIY585aa	your question is rather vague. I mean, the most simplest answer is yes. can you give us the examples you discovered to give us insight as to your assignment?    EDIT - Ok, that makes sense. How about the little green squeeky toys that offer up Buzz to the "Claw" and fight Woody --- strength in numbers.....    But ultimately, the entire movie has to do with math. Everything in the movie is a computer generated image. A computer's only ability is to add and subtract numbers really REALLY fast. Each frame of video contains oodles of math. Everything you see was created by using math. Every single detail in that movie never really existed, except in the form of 1's and 0's that are stored on a computer. All the computer can really do is add and subtract 1's and 0's really fast. So, technically, everything in the movie has something to do with math.    I hope my additional information has helped.

db6qW1u5aa	Start by downloading the GMAT Prep software. It's two real CAT tests, and its free from http://www.MBA.com. Taking one of those will give you a really good idea of where you stand score-wise.     Second, go get all three GMAT Official Guides. There is the general one, and then the smaller ones for quant and verbal. They each have different questions, and you need to get as many different questions as possible. All the questions in each book come from actual, former tests.     Last, buy some study guides. I like the Manhattan GMAT books (http://www.manhattanngmat.com), but they are a bit short at times, and not necessarily written in the easiest way for self-study. Powerscore (http://www.powerscore.com) has books on sentence correction and critical reasoning that helped me. Here's how I'd break it down in terms of what to get:    Verbal CR and SC: The two Powerscore GMAT Bibles that cover these topics    Verbal RC and Math: Manhattan GMAT guides for these subjects
m722nsQLaa	Hola, esto te servira:    Analoga del griego  (ana -reiteracin  comparacin- y logos razn), significa comparacin o relacin entre varias razones o conceptos; comparar o relacionar dos o ms seres u objetos, a travs de la razn se?alando caractersticas generales y particulares, generando razonamientos basados en la existencia de semejanzas entre estos.    Los tipos de Analogia son:      Homologa    Se produce homologa cuando dos cosas o casos diferentes, aun siendo distintos, ejercen la misma funcin y utilizan la misma expresin en ambos casos.    Por ejemplo un Jefe de Servicio en un Departamento, tiene un homlogo como Jefe de Servicio en otro Departamento; de la misma forma que las alas de una mosca tienen una homologa con las alas de un guila o de un avin. En geometra las figuras semejantes son homlogas.   Dos discursos son homlogos cuando discurren de forma paralela en asuntos diferentes:      Comparacin    Cuando el sentido analgico se expresa directamente en el lenguaje sin recurso a la metfora, como una mera comparacin de los objetos o situaciones reales.    El narrador obtiene un sentido ms fuerte al hablar de la fuerza de una hormiga llevndose una hojita al hormiguero al decir: es como si un hombre arrastrara hacia su casa un objeto de 150 Kg.       Alegora    Cuando la comparacin se prolonga a lo largo del discurso hablando del objeto como si fuera lo comparado, en una sucesin de metforas que se convierte en objeto del propio discurso entonces el recurso lingstico recibe el nombre de alegora.    Las parbolas del Evangelio o las fbulas son el ejemplo ms propio de lo que es una alegora. El cuento de Pinocho es una alegora de lo que no debe hacer un ni?o, "mentir". Los ni?os tienen que ir siempre diciendo la verdad, so pena de recibir un castigo.   Ciertas alegoras retricas se plasman en imgenes que aportan un sentido intermedio entre el smbolo y la alegora como por ejemplo la representacin de la Balanza sostenida por una mujer con los ojos tapados en representacin de la Justicia; o Cupido tirando las flechas con los ojos tapados.       Servida|`|RoRdyLezaa	ANA: coforme y LOGOS: razn.  Analoga: Semejanza de relaciones existentes entre dos pares de palabras.  Ejemplo:  7. Alegria: Exultacin  a)novicio:  novsimo  DISTRACTOR  b)sucio: percudido    DISTRACTOR  c)lato: vasto  d)angustia: terror       DISTRACTOR  e)temerario: temeroso  DISTRACTOR    Relacin INTENSIDAD.  Rpta: c)    Tipos:  PARTE TODO  lienzo: cuadro    ELEMENTO CONJUNTO  huesos: esqueleto    ESPECIE GNERO  roble: rbol    COGENRICOS  guitarra: charango    CAUSA: EFECTO  licor: embriaguez    INTENSIDAD  llovizna: aguacero    CARACTERISTICA  hroe: arrojo    ASOCIADOS POR EL USO  aguja: hilo    ASOCIADOS POR EL LUGAR  camello: desierto    SUJETO INSTRUMENTO  qumico : matraz    FUNCIN  lengua: saborear    MATERIA PRIMA A PRODUCTO  cuero zapato    EVOLUCION  mortero: licuadora    SUJETO OBJETO DE ESTUDIO  histologo tejidos    SIMBOLISMO  esvastica nazismo    SINONIMIA  beodo: borracho    ANTONIMIA  insipiencia: sapiencia|`|pQlMUoNBaa	Por si acaso y este es su tema, recuerde que en el rea del derecho existen tambien dos tipos de analogia:    Analoga legis  Analoga juris.

EJSdI25Naa	The story goes that up on Mt.Sinai, god spoke to Moses and after giving him the ten commandments written by his finger in stone "Mene, mene, tekel upsharsim." the moving finger writ, and having writ died down. Send me an email address in which I can send you a copy of Titian's painting "Joseph and the Wife of Potifar, in which the moving finger is used as a signature for Titian. God also commanded Moses to take threads of crimson, blue and white to create the tabernacle and adorn it with tassels and embroidery. On display right now in Liverpool, England, at one of the museums, is pharaoh's belt. A 15 m long tapered piece of weaving created with threads of crimson, blue and white. the white would be the bleached linen, the blue Indian indigo and the red an organic dye from tree leaves.  Again I can send you a photograph of this belt. To my mind, it was moe a girdle, wound around the waist and fastened which would have formed an armor for the king's body. It was found in the tomb of Rameses III, 1180 B.C. Interestingly, Cecil B. DeMille's "Ten Commandments" of 1954 had Yul Brynner playing Rameses. I had thought it to have been Rameses II, though. His father was called Seti,  if that helps by elimination.    DeMillle literally accepted the story of the Red Sea opening up. well, of course, that is a good story but hardly factual. I have the impression that it was a tsunami that might have been the prototype of the story and the pillar of fire a meteorite trail, the impact of which could have dislodged a sizeable portion of the continental shelf along fault planes which creating a swirl in the sea making it retreat, only to come back in as a deluge.     A similar thing happened in Italy ca 501 A.D. It is recorded in the monumental work "The fall and Decline of the Roman Empire." I cannot think of the authors' names off hand, but it was published in the eighteenth century. Your library should have a copy of it. (In no way am I referring to the old movie.) If anything, this would probably be the one source for you to gain references from, not many but a few.  There isn't anything at all in the ancient Egyptian literature. but the golden calf which the Hebrews made under the direction of the brother of Moses, a goldmith, was directly adapted from the Egyptians. As was the gold they obviously were supposed to have. The bible says they were told to ask the Egyptians for it. A big ask for slaves, I would think. But, religions well know that you do not spoil a good story with the truth. My address is potifar@optusnet.com.aus, king of the gods in the Ancient Greek pantheon, also assumed the shape of a cloud to seduce  mortal women. A different story, of course, but one has borrowed from the other or they both had a common ancestry. common ancestry is my thought. Titian has painted both women, one in several versions. The impregnation was accomplished via a shower of gold, indicated by gold coins fallng from the cloud above her naked body. So much for divine intelligence. As long as there are idiots kept uneducated, there ill always be somebody to believe it.  If there was a god, I'm sure he'd weep in shame to see how abused his name has become.     Yours, etc. Barrie O.            
3149d8c79c2c2fd573c8fb1acb44e350aa	Since I am a librarian's assistant in  a middle school I will tell you about my duties. I help students locate books, I make recomendations on what  books to read( when students want to  read a book but don't know what book they like), I re-shelf books, I cover  new books, I research and add AR labels, I assist students with their  research on the computers and I also  help teachers with research data. I  calm down students when they can't find  something or can't figure assignments  out and I calm down teachers when they  are pulling their hair out because  their students just aren't getting it.  Thanks for the nice words about assistants here in the library. Now make sure your library books aren't  overdue. ( said with a smile)

AA10176626	The government doesn't provide the money to make Stafford loans, the government's only role is to guarantee repayment. With few exceptions, Stafford loans are made by individual lenders who elect to participate in the government's Stafford lending program.    The reality is that government guaranteed loans are the loans MOST favored by lenders - if the lenders continue to cut back on their lending activity, it won't be government guaranteed loans that they'll be cutting back on.    The lenders are worried about the qualify of loans that they make - but in the case of government-guaranteed loans, the government assumes all the risk of non-payment.    If there is one thing you don't have to worry about in life, it's whether the lenders will be making Stafford loans next semester.    Now, if you want something you can worry about - the Department of Education has informed Congress that they anticipate coming up about $6 billion short on Pell Grant funding next year, because so many more students are qualifying for need-based assistance. Unless Congress increases funding for student aid, the DOE may need to tighten up the rules on Pell qualification, or cut the amount of money awarded under the program.    It's not my place to encourage you to vote for a particular candidate in the upcoming election, but I will tell you that there is a significant difference between the 2 candidates in terms of their educational proposals. It would be worth your time to read up on those plans, and consider educational financing when you make your decision. Whatever you do - please get out and vote. It's important that the priorities of our young people get an appropriate hearing in the halls of government. When young people don't vote, they have no voice in Washington.    I hope that helped - don't worry about your second semester government loan financing.    Now private loans...hmm......

FYUzkOYVaa	major in forensic science|`|0vLU2GGGaa	Education Requirements    A four-year degree in physics, biology, microbiology, chemistry, medical technology, or genetics, is required in order to obtain an entry-level job in forensic science. Taking classes in law and communication can also be helpful. In addition, experience in a laboratory may be required by some crime labs.    Special Skills    The field of Forensics requires scientists to work with a wide assortment of people, in situations that are often stressful. Because of this, it is crucial that people working in this profession have exceptional people skills. It is also important for forensic scientists to be good speakers and proficient writers as they will be required to write up a number of reports, and may be called upon to witness in court. Lastly, because forensic scientists must be to handle minute pieces of evidence while looking through a microscope, excellent hand-eye coordination is essential.

This will determine if you are eligible for grants, loans, etc.    http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/|`|gmaCvh00aa	Life is taking risks.  If you don't take any risks because you are afraid, you will fail 100% of the time to reach your goals.  That's what courage is for.    Just do it.  College tuition prices are rarely what you actually pay.  Fill out the FAFSA, apply to the college, and if you are not accepted, wail and gnash your teeth for a day or two and then move on to your  alternate choice.  The schools have whole departments that are paid to review your financial applications and help you find a way to go there if possible.    Tens of thousands of kids go to college every year and have to fill out these forms and never knew how to do it either.  If you can't bring yourself to do what needs to be done, perhaps you aren't really college material.

Use the same argument that people use to ban cigarettes, fatty foods, guns, etc and just apply it to cars.  Do we need cars?  No---everything could be handled by public transportation.  We would make thousands of jobs.  We would save people money (most spend about 7% or more of their money on transportation).  We would save thousands of lives (just haul out every drunk driving or driving death statistic) and we would relieve a lot of tax pressure for maintaining roads as there would be a lot less use.  We would also increase productivity and be less dependent on foreign oil.  Your reader will be squirming in their seats reading that stuff.  You could even talk about a fictious country who has done this and show how happy they are.  And conclude that "if we all save just one life---wouldn't it be worth it?"  and then talk about a poor girl or something killed by driver.    I for one do not want to give up my freedom of driving.  It is a priveledge and not a right.  There are other "for the common good" things you can bring up.  How about a draft pool for organs?  If your number comes up you lose an eye or something.  See what I mean.  The reader has to know what it is to lose a freedom to understand the consequences of not having a choice---even if that choice is a bad one.  There are millions who enjoy the freedom of the priveledge to drive and the few that abuse it ruin the freedom for everyone.    That is how I would approach it.|`|1qm7n4Otaa	You should write about anyone in history that has fought for their freedoms.

BUT! That does not mean you can't improve, you just need pratice! But there is no point sitting there reading a book you don't enjoy... You're not going to learn much there... If you don't enjoy something, it's hard to improve on it, unless you are constantly forced to learn something... But there must be some books you like to read. "Harry Potter"? "Series of Unfortunate Events"? "    There are plenty of books! And most of them are suitable for you!    And also if your imagination is wild like Ronald Dahl's then you can write stories and maybe make a fortune out of them when you get older!!    Good Luck!!

On each of these seismograms you will have to measure the S - P time interval (in seconds). (In the figure above, the S - P interval is about 45 seconds. The vertical lines are placed at 2 second intervals.) The S - P time interval will then be used to determine the distance the waves have traveled from the origin to that station.     The actual location of the earthquake's epicenter will be on the perimeter of a circle drawn around the recording station. The radius of this circle is the epicentral distance. One S - P measurement will produce one epicentral distance: the direction from which the waves came is unknown. Three stations are needed in order to "triangulate" the location.|`|1a648f2a4669c231da364294546cb083aa	http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/neic...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake  http://projects.crustal.ucsb.edu/underst...

Then there is special software for students with dyslexia so they can type up their assignments easier.

I use my computer to do different activities with the students as well.

I can hook up my computer to a box light projector and project it onto a screen so everyone can see, then each student gets a chance to choose something.|`|MMMZe7t3aa	There are a lot of different uses for computers in the classrooms. Teachers use powerpoint and projectors. A lot of schools are now lending students laptops and transferring programs and data to the students. This also ensures that the students all have the same format and that the document looks the same on computers which can be a problem when you are transferring between Macs and PCs.     Students also have access to multiple programs that allow them to participate in class at a higher level. There is some research going on where students can submit their answers to teh teacher via IM and the teacher can evaluate the students at any givven time. With technology the way that it is the teacher and student relationship has almost no bounds. I am currently a college student but i know some high schoolers and even grad schoolers that have laptops that they do their homework on at home and can email them to the teacher. This si in private schools at the moment. This is also helpful for any questions that the students may have if they are in study hall and can not find the teacher.

The opposite sex won't be such a mystery to you when you grow up and have to live with a spouse.    Disadvantage:  through the teen years, boys and girls are so concerned about each other that they have a hard time focusing on their studies, and girls especially won't do as well at school because they don't want to look smarter than the boys.|`|S36a7l7jaa	its good.  its unnatural for us not to mix.   ive always hung around guys and i have alot of guy friends  never been distracted in class by a guy anymore than by a girl    the difference where i am is most single-sex schools are private.. and religious. parents pay $20,000 a year to send their son to kindy at a private all boys school. i think its disgusting and unnecessary.    i think ive got a pretty good education in a public school and made some really good guy friends. doing my final year now, i dont think doing religion on top of my subjects would have helped me.    the only disadvantage here is "private" schools get 2/3 of the funding from the government. public schools dont have swimming pools for each grade.  im in australia i dont know if that makes any difference.|`|iVvirnkfaa	good, you can adapt to the opposite gender and you're ready for the real world, its not like you get to choose your co-workers.     on the downside, all you really do in class is stare at some hot chicks... ya know...     nevermind, completely disregard that :D but the first part is true

You also aren't as concise as you could be.     Im not sure what spurred me to go to that toy store. It was miles away. Im not sure how I found the tiny area dedicated to that little piece of plastic. Cobwebs had been amassing over the forgotten toy. Im not sure why I spent the last two dollars from my paycheck on the plaything. My better judgment told me to save, but I was sure that this was the beginning of something good.  The yoyo at the end of the string was red, clear, and cheap. It had a fixed axle. The string was not fanciful or chimerical; it was plain cotton. My childhood skills had rusted and cracked and disintegrated. However, once I started, I could not give up. I faltered; I floundered; I failed. The devil bruised me and his tail cut me. My finger turned blue from the noose. But I never quit. I could not quit. I cannot comprehend quitting.   And so, for weeks, I practiced. I read books on yoyos. I learned the anatomy: transaxles, ball axles, string lengths, centripetal force, gyroscopic motion. It worked.  The night I threw the moon shot was like any other. For about five weeks, my practicing had given me the normal throw, the sleeper, and other basic tricks. What I lacked in talent, I compensated with in form. What didnt come naturally, I taught with time. Now my ego had extended a new challenge to me. I wanted to throw the yoyo out in front of me and pull it back, but instead of catching it, loop and push it out above my head, shooting the moon, then catch it. I gained a black eye for trying this on my second day with the toy.  Shot after shot, the yoyo swished by my ear. The string tangled and knotted. The yoyo played modern percussion pieces on the floor: I never understood the jumble of noises. I felt exploited. Worse, I had only exploited myself. I expected too much too soon. Reality shook me.  Suddenly, some primal urge took over. Some internal instinct ticked and I knew I had to try again. I threw. The yoyo flew out before me, teasing the outmost edges of the string prior to soaring back towards my hand. I made the mistake before. Fix it. I lifted my hands, twisted my fingers, and [conducted the most beautiful symphony I had heard in weeks] (this metaphor doesn't follow with the one you made before). The yoyo grazed my skin before rocketing towards the sky. I had shot the moon.  My joy had come in a split second before the behemoth of defeat glared me in my face. Following through with the trick meant catching the yoyo. In order to succeed I had to seize this threatening bullet. It came so quickly, I did not even have time to think. When I realized that the yoyo was in my hand, string tucked in neatly, palm red from friction, I slowly grew to realize the feat I had just accomplished. I won.    While you use good description, some of it is very forced and unnatural. Also, you need to have a conclusion in which you explain how the event impacted you. What changed after your success with the yoyo? |`|avyFgIVSaa	Dude.

AA10297143	Unfortunately, the answer is yes.  I once knew a girl who failed to qualify based on her scores with all branches of the service.  At the time, it was nearly impossible not to be accepted by the Marines or the Army, and she failed to qualify for both.  She wasn't even close for marks to get into the Air Force or Navy.  ASVAB is not that much different from some IQ type questions, and if you never learn those skills, you don't know the answers, you don't pass the test.  She is the only one in my lifetime that I actually knew who failed to pass the ASVAB exam.

The first thing is that it cost more money to get clothes. Because now you need both clothes for school and clothes for home.  2. It does inhibit our individuality. Instead of being our own person, we are conforming to be just like everybody else.  3. Uniforms won't really keep us safe, if your school's colors are blue and red, then people are going to think you are a blood or crypt.  4. They add more paper work to the teachers. Of coarse there is going to be some students that break the rules. They are going to need to file papers for a stupid thing.  5.  I am a strait a student and got send up to the office, because I didn't wear a collar. Our school has spirit days in which we can dress freely and I was told that we had a free day.

Last, he should buy some study guides.

Fnp2MIycaa	Yes it is true.    Vinegar has, among other things, a chemical called Acetic Acid (about 3% of it is acetic acid). Egg shells contain calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate in the egg shell reacts with vinegar to form carbon dioxide (can be seen as bubbles in the vinegar).  http://van.physics.uiuc.edu/qa/listing.p...    A naked egg is an egg without a shell. Using vinegar, you can dissolve the eggshellwithout breaking the membrane that contains the egg.     When you submerge an egg in vinegar, the shell dissolves. Vinegar contains acetic acid, which breaks apart the solid calcium carbonate crystals that make up the eggshell into their calcium and carbonate parts. The calcium ions (ions are atoms that are missing electrons) float free, while the carbonate goes to make carbon dioxidethe bubbles that you see.|`|CzBNTeLAaa	Yes, and it will dissolve the shell.

Irr5ftN7aa	To write an equation in slope intercept form, you must know what each of the variables (or "letters") stands for... Slope intercept form reads:    y=mx + b    Whenever you are given the equation of a line, you want to locate the points that fall on that line. Those points are written in what is called an ordered pair. (-2, -1) and (1,2) are both ordered pairs. The first number in the pair is the x, and the second number in the pair is the y.     So in (-2, -1), -2 is your "x" term, and -1 is your "y" term  And in (1,2) 1 is your "x" term, and 2 is your "y" term    With that, let's get back to the equation of a line:  y=mx+b    y is the "y" term in your ordered pair  m is the slope   x is the "x" term from the ordered pair  and b is the y-intercept, which is the point where your line crosses the y axis.    Now, you are given two points and need to determine the slope in order to get your "m" term...    the equation for slope then becomes: y2-y1 divided by x2 -x1  in (-2, -1) and (1,2), -2 is your x1, -1 is your y1  1 is your x2, and 2 is your y2    now plug them in:    2-(-1) divided by 1-(-2) and you get 3 divided by 3 which equals 1.    so your slope is 1, and you have an x and y term, but we need to find the y-intercept. so plug everything into the equation to solve for y-intercept:    using point (1,2) just to work with positive numbers, let's solve for y-int:  2=1(1) + b  2= 1 +b  subtract one from both sides to solve for b  1=b    now your line reads: y=1x + 1 and you are done!!!!!!!

MYew47b6aa	convert the grams to moles using the atomic mass.  this is the sum of the individual mass of each atom so 39+16+1.  this is as previously said the amount of moles of KOH that is present.  use the mole ratios, 2 moles H2O/2Moles KOH.  this will give you the moles of H2o.  Use the H2O weight to convert to mass.    basicly to clarify a little and show the mass    19.6gKOH(1 mol KOH/56 G KOH)= .35 moles KOH    .35 mol KOH(2mol H2O/ 2Mol KOH)= .35 moles H2O    .35 mol H2O(18 g H2O/1 mol H2O)=6.3 g H2O|`|3WCxm1Nbaa	Okay you need to find your limiting reagent.  Calculate the moles you have of KOH.  Since the mole ratios for KOH and H2O are the same, you have the same amount of moles for both of them. So if you have 4.231 moles of KOH you have 4.321 moles of H2O.  So you have X moles of H2O. Convert that back to grams. That's the mass of water you made.

I'm sure you've heard people say "Bush is the worst president we've ever had" or something along those lines...well if you compare Bush to Johnson, you would think Bush was the greatest. First things first    - Johnson did become the president after lincolns assasination. Lincoln was assasinated during a period of american reconstruction; after lincon was killed, johnson had to pick up on it.    instead of continuing with trying to make life better for the newly freed blacks, johnson was all about white supremacy. he made it hard for blacks and didnt protect them against the kkk, etc (you can look more into it yourself)    thirdly, johnson was the first president to be impeached (But was saved by one vote). congress hated him because he vetoed nearly all of their reconstruction acts. he was even bring in ex-confederate leaders into office! seriously, if hes gonna do that, then the civil war was in vein, right?    anyways, the rest you can look up yourself (i say that in the nicest way possible). johnson was a very interesting president. good luck!|`|FkGwJj0Raa	I'm sorry i don't know, maybe you should look it up one google!!!! tee hee

6kue5meiaa	Quotes on Greed & Avarice    The twin killers of success are impatience and greed. - E. James 'Jim' Rohn    The point of the teachings is to control your own mind. Restrain your mind from greed, and you will keep your body right, your mind pure and your words faithful. Always thinking of the transcendence's of your life, you will be able to desist from greed and anger and will be able to avoid all evils. - Buddha      New York City is a great monument to the power of money and greed, a race for rent. - Frank Lloyd Wright      There is no calamity greater than lavish desires. There is no greater guilt than discontentment. And there is not greater disaster than greed. - Lao-Tzu      There is a sufficiency in the world for man's need but not for man's greed. - Mohandas K. 'Mahatma' Gandhi    There is enough in the world for everyone's need, but not enough for everyone's greed. - Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman      Curst greed of gold, what crimes thy tyrant power has caused. - Virgil      For greed, all nature is too little. - Seneca    Avarice is the vice of declining years. - George Bancroft (1800-1891) American Historian      It is not the want, but rather abundance that creates avarice. - Michel Eyquem De Montaigne (1553-1592) French Philosopher, Essayist      We are not here to sell a parcel of boilers and vats, but the potentiality of growing rich beyond the dreams of avarice. - Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) English Author, Lexicographer      The avarice person is ever in want; let your desired aim have a fixed limit. - Horace (65-8BC) [Quintus Horacius Flaccus] Roman Latin Poet, Satirist      Poverty wants some, luxury many, and avarice all things. - Seneca (4BC-65AD) [Lucius Annaeus Seneca] Spanish-born Roman Statesman, Philosopher, Moralist      Avarice is always poor. - Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) English Author, Lexicographer      Avarice is generally the last passion of those lives of which the first part has been squandered in pleasure, and the second devoted to ambition. He that sinks under the fatigue of getting wealth, lulls his age with the milder business of saving it. - Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) English Author, Lexicographer      Avarice, envy, pride, Three fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all On Fire. - Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) Italian Epic Poet, Philosopher      Avarice in old age is foolish; for what can be more absurd than to increase our provisions for the road the nearer we approach to our journeys end. - Cicero (106-43BC) [Marcus Tullius Cicero] Roman Statesman, Orator, Philosopher      Poverty wants some things, luxury many, avarice all things. - Abraham Cowley (1618-1667) English Poet      At length corruption, like a general flood (So long by watchful ministers withstood), Shall deluge all; and avarice, creeping on, Spread like a low-born mist, and blot the sun. - Alexander Pope (1688-1744) English Satirical Poet, Critic, Translator      Be niggards of advice on no pretence; For the worst avarice is that of sense. - Alexander Pope (1688-1744) English Satirical Poet, Critic, Translator      The power of perpetuating our property in our families is one of the most valuable and interesting circumstances belonging to it, and that which tends most to the perpetuation of society itself. It makes our weakness subservient to our virtue; it grafts benevolence even upon avarice. The possession of family wealth and of the distinction which attends hereditary possessions (as most concerned in it,) are the natural securities for this transmission. - Edmund Burke (1729-1797) Irish Orator, Statesman      More: If we lived in a State where virtue was profitable, common sense would make us good, and greed would make us saintly. And we'd live like animals or angels in the happy land that needs no heroes. But since in fact we see that avarice, anger, envy, pride, sloth, lust and stupidity commonly profit far beyond humility, chastity, fortitude, justice and thought, and have to choose, to be human at all, why then perhaps we must stand fast a little, even at the risk of being heroes. [A Man for All Seasons] - Robert Bolt (1924-1935) English Dramatist      Avarice has ruined more souls than extravagance. - Charles Caleb Colton (1780-1832) English Sportsman, Writer      Three sparks, pride, envy, and avarice, have been kindled in all hearts. [It., Superbia, invidia ed avarizia sono Le tre faville che hanno i cori accesi] - Dante Alighieri (1265-1321) Italian Epic Poet, Philosopher      Ambition is but avarice on stilts, and masked. - Walter Savage Landor (1775-1864) English Poet, Author      Prudery is a kind of avarice, the worst of all. - Stendhal (1783-1842) [Marie Henri Beyle] French Biographer, Novelist      Five enemies of peace inhabit with us, avarice, ambition, envy, anger, and pride; if these were to be banished, we should infallibly enjoy perpetual peace. - Francesco Petrarch (1304-1374) Italian Poet, Humanist      We are a puny and fickle folk.

That is, it is something that someone believes to be true, but which has not yet been tested or proven.|`|IXuYZvcMaa	A hypothesis consists either of a suggested explanation for an observable phenomenon or of a reasoned proposal predicting a possible causal correlation among multiple phenomena. The term derives from the Greek, hypotithenai meaning "to put under" or "to suppose." The scientific method requires that one can test a scientific hypothesis. Scientists generally base such hypotheses on previous observations or on extensions of scientific theories. Even though the words "hypothesis" and "theory" are often used synonymously in common and informal usage, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A Hypothesis is never to be stated as a question, but always as a statement with an explanation following it. It is not to be a question because it states what he/she thinks or believes will occur.

7RZ6FoxGaa	okay....... lets see. i'll try to make this easy to follow. i'll make some steps.    1. this is a parabola because its x squared (x^2)  this means its in a u type shape    2. inequalties like this are ax^2 + bx + c  if a is a posotive   the u opens up. if its negative it opens down.  in this case its negative so it opens down.    3. next is the axis of symmetry. the invisible line that cuts the u in half.  you find this by doing -b/2a.  here it is -3/2(-2) which is 3/4 so this is your axis of symmetry.  so you go to 3/4 on the x-axis and draw a vertical line.  your parabola will be on this line opening down.    4. the vertex. this is the tip of the U whether its up or down. the middle point i'll say. this point is going to look like (x,y) obviously.  find the x by doing -b/2a like in step 3.  find y by taking the x and putting in the place of all the x's in the original equation.   so y= -2(3/4)^2 + 3(3/4) +5. solve and this is the y.  now you have (x,y) . this will be on the line of symmetry thing.    5.find the intercepts  set the original equation to zero. so -2x^2 + 3x + 5 = 0  factor it. find the 2 x's  plot these as dots on the x-axis  connect the vertex point to these points to make the parabola.    6. if theres an (or equal to) sign then its a solid line  if not then its a dashed line  shade above the parabola if its greather than  and under if its less than    *** you may not need to know all this but i hope this is understandable and helps. this might be easier   http://a-s.clayton.edu/garrison/Math%200...

For example, are you addressing a director in charge of funding homeless shelters?  So, you would state your main point, something like, "Homeless shelters should evict (not euthanize) residents after a year of homelessness." This will be included in your paper's introduction.     Next, begin work on your paper's middle section. In this example, you would write a list of five reasons that directly support this main point. Then organize these reasons, beginning with the most important one, and write a rough draft of your paper. Use relevant research to support your points.    At the end of your paper, summarize your paper's key points in the final paragraph. These are points that you want your reader to remember, even if he or she forgets all of the other details.       And finally, you should consider writing two or three more rough drafts before working on the final draft. Your paper will have a clear beginning, middle and end.

JUmfm168aa	Hello,    It is easy to solve these equations by simplifying and then gathering like terms.  For example, terms involving x on the left, and constant terms on the right.    For the first one, 2x + 3 - x = 2x - x + 3 = x + 3.    Then x + 3 = 4x - 5.    Subtracting x from both sides gives x + 3 - x = 4x - 5 - x, so 3 = 3x - 5.    Then, by adding 5, 3 + 5 = 3x - 5 + 5, so 8 = 3x.    Finally, dividing by three yields that 8/3 = 3x/3. So 8/3 = x.    For the second, adopt a similar approach. To add the fractions, use a lowest common denominator.    If you struggle,  (2/3)x - (5/6)x = (4/6)x - (5/6)x = (-1/6)x.    So you have -3 - (1/6)x = (1/2)x - 5.    By adding 5, -3 - (1/6)x + 5 = (1/2)x - 5 + 5, so 2 - (1/6)x = (1/2)x.    Then, by adding (1/6)x, 2 - (1/6)x + (1/6)x = (1/2)x + (1/6)x.    So 2 = (3/6)x + (1/6)x = (4/6)x = (2/3)x.    Then, multiplying by three produces 2 * 3 = (2/3)x * 3, so 6 = 2x.    Dividing by two: (6/2) = (2/2)x, so 3 = x.|`|nuqRy9akaa	1.   2x + 3 -x = 4x - 5  combine like terms  x + 3 = 4x - 5  get the x to one side by subtracting  3 = 3x - 5  get the numbers to one side by adding  8 = 3x  divide both sides by 3  and you get...  x = 3/8 or 0.375    2.   2/3x - 5/6x - 3 = 1/2x - 5  multiply entire equation by 6  4x - 5x - 3 = 3x - 5  combine like terms  -x - 3 = 3x - 5  get the x to one side by adding  -3 = 4x - 5  get the numbers to one side by adding  2 = 4x  divide both sides by 2  and you get...  x = 2/4 or 1/2 or 0.5

"I'd rather be hated for who I am than loved for who I am not" (Kurt Cobain). I'm not a fan of his or of Nirvana or anything, but I just liked the quote. It's like wanting society to accept you for you, and not wanting you to be someone else and that they'd rather they hate the person you are than you be someone you're not for them to like you.    "Everything is possible in this life" (Marat Safin).

AA10691226	Shakespeare is important to the literary world because of the use of language and plot in his plays and the talent in iambic pentameter manipulation shown in his poetry. The man used many more thousands of words than most people even know and presented them in marvellous ways.    The impressive part  is the variety of topics he covered in his plays and the depth of feeling and beauty of expression in his poetry. Studying these works is not only instructive but inspirational to students at all levels and comes across even in translation to other languages.    Any of his works can be used to demonstrate examples of the above features.

Then you can expound on those points and say how the threat of losing it changes your way of life, and then finally, why it would be important to fight for it (as in a war) because too many people experiencing that threatened way of life will have a negative impact in your community.

AA10067221	I would use a topic that is closely connected to your particular age group or generation. Not only will you be more knowledgeable on the subject, which is required to make a proficient argument for persuasion, but you will probably feel more confident in what you have to say about it.   Here are a few examples:    __1. -Cyber-bullying: explore the argument about whose responsibility it is, either the parents, teens, internet police, etc., to protect young on-line users from cyberbullying. Explore the following topics: "gossip" on myspace/facebook, etc., the amount of influence myspace/facebook has on its users and non-users, the spread of rumors through instant messaging, and the issues regarding privacy on personal websites.  Persuade your audience to take the side of the argument you support.    __2. -The Pursuit of Perfection: explore topics about the amount of pressure parents, schools, the media, and peers put on teens to be "perfect," successful, etc. Persuade your audience/readers to address solutions to this problem, such as setting realistic, obtainable goals or self-acceptance...etc.    __3. -School Burn-Out: explore the argument about the amount of school-related activities and requirements teens face now in high school & how that often leads to "school burn-out." Persuade your audience to prioritize their activities and limit their activities to their favorites, rather than spreading their selves too thin by engaging in a number of commitments.    __4. -To Work or Not To Work: you could address the topic of high school employment and provide information on why it is either acceptable or not acceptable for teens to have jobs during their high school years. Research the benefits or the pros and cons of choosing academics over employment.  Persuade your audience to agree or disagree with these findings.    __5. - Surviving the Social Scene in High School: your speech could be a survival's guide to incoming freshmen regarding the social issues of high school. Persuade your audience why they should do the following: Be true to yourself. Try not to get caught up in the popularity contests, cat fights, bickering, etc. Don't get involved with drama-prone people, even if they are old friends. Expand your horizons and meet new people. Meeting new people sometimes can give you a wider perspective on life. Also, in high school your middle school friends may not always be in the same classes. Don't limit your social opportunities by remaining in the same close-knit circle of friends from middle school.  Persuade them to step outside of that social comfort every once in a while.    Here are some persuasive speech writing prompts that you could also use:    --You are tired of news on TV that exploit other people's misfortunes. Tell why it is unethical for journalists to make money on deaths and war. Persuade others to view this issue as you do.  --Think and prove that living in a big city is better than living in a small town (and vice versa).   --Convince your parents to buy you something or allow you more freedoms and responsibilities.   --Your friends want to go to a college party; however, all this week youve been thinking about going to the football game to support your school team. Try to persuade them to go to the football game instead of the party.  --Take any common fallacy/lie/misconception (such as the common misconception that addiction is something that addicts can control, when in fact, addiction is a disease), and prove why it is wrong.   --You have your own point of view on marriage and family. Convince your readers why it is correct.  -Persuade others why job satisfaction is more important than what the job pays. Or vice versa.  -Persuade others why it is necessary to have a cell phone or not.  -Persuade others to try a hobby that you enjoy.
JGf3H3Ikaa	1. Combine like terms. On the right side of the equation, you have "j" that can be combined. it's just like 4+9. 4+9=13 so 4j+9j=13j   On the left side you the equation, use the Distributive property. To do that, you multiply what's inside parenthesis by whatever number (or variable) is outside of it. Here, it can be distributed like this: 8(j-3)= 8j-8(3) = 8j-24  Now the equation you have is:  8j-24=13j-14  This is probably more like what you're used to.  2. Solve for regular numbers. That is, move -24 from the left side to the right side. You do this by adding the opposite to both sides. 8j-24 + +24= 8j.  13j-14+24= 13j+10.  Now the equation you have is:  8j= 13j+10  3. Solve for your variable. Get the "j"s on one side together. subtract 13j from both sides.  Now the equation you have is:  -5j=10  4. Solve for j. Divide out the -5 to get "j" alone.  10/-5= -2  So!  j= -2!    You can check your answer by plugging -2 back in for "j"  When you do, the equation comes out at 40=40!    Hope that helped!|`|C88JtrmTaa	ok first you need to get all the varibles on one side. in this case the varible is j .  you have to do 8*j and 8*3 and that gives you   8j-24=4j+9j-14  at 14 to both sides to get ride of it on the side with the most j's  you also have to subtract the 8j from both side so you can just have j's on the right hand side then add all the j's toghter and that gives you  10=5j  then you need to divide 10 by 5 to get ride of the 5 j and you are left with  2=j

ubj2alqXaa	"corruption of the best is worst"    Akhilles' treatment of Hector's body is unprecedented in the war.    He dragged it around the city how many times?  Then he took it back to his own camp and refused to relinquish it to Priam until Priam came behind Greek lines and petitioned Akhilles in person for it.    I always think it's kind of weird when people talk about Homer's developing of characters.    The Iliad is a more or less factual account of actual people and events.  Even if you don't believe that the Greeks did.   Homer did not invent any of the characters, any of their actions, any of the results.    They were all a matter of public knowledge.    So the concept that the bigger you are the harder you fall and how that applied to Akhilles was not an invention of Homer.    Akhilles was the greatest warrior, but he was also prideful and prone to anger, which did not stand well for him. The whole epic is about the wrath of Akhilles and how it destroyed him.    The second link is to a pretty cool essay that should help a bit.

The only way she will not have to report your income on her FAFSA until she is 25 is if she gets married before then.     You obviously provide more than half of her support, and in my opinion, you should claim her.|`|ba617fa5a2f42dceb971767a60c2357baa	Actually, you can only claim her until she graduates from undergrad. Once she graduates, the law considers her an independent on FAFSA regardless of whether she has an income or not.     Also, if you claim her on your tax return, she will lose alot of refund money because she is filing as a dependent and you still won't get any money if you claim or not claim her because she is above 18yrs of age.

Im going out to fetch the little calf  Thats standing by the mother. Its so young,   It totters when she licks it with her tongue.   I shant be gone long.You come too.    The poem is speaking from a mother to a child trying to comfort him/her.  The mother tells the child there is a chance for renewal and that fears will not last by raking the leaves away.  The child feels afraid of his/her mother leaving.  In the second stanza, she is relating this to that of a cow and her calf.  The cow licks her calf with her tongue symbolizing an everlasting bond and sense of protectiveness.    I didn't know this before, but I looked it up and now when I read it, it makes a lot more sense and it's really a sweet and calm poem.

U8lEDtIOaa	So the cylinder needs to be broken up to its base and middle.  The surface area of the middle is equal to the circumference of the base times the height. (10cm x 16cm=160cm^2)  Then for the base you need to find the area of one base and multiply it by two to get both bases. In order to do that you need to remember the formulas for circumference and area of a circle (C=2r*pi / A=pi*r^2).  You first need the radius of the circle from the circumference. To do this divide the circumference by pi and 2. ( 16/(pi*2)=8/pi=r )  This gives the radius which is used in the area equation. (A=pi*(8/pi)^2=64/pi=20.37183.....)  So take the area of the circle multiply it by 2 and add the surface area of the middle (160+2*20.37183=200.743665.....cm^2)  and thats the answer :)|`|nOf0RPitaa	Answer: Surface area = 200.84 cm 2    Working:  When you open up a cylinder, like cutting open an empty can  you get a rectangle in the middle [ the top length being the circumference and the other side the height of the cylinder] and a  circle each at top and bottom    circumference = 2 * r  16 = 2 r  r = 16/2  r = 16/[2*3.1415927]  r = 2.5464791 cm  r= 2.55 cm [rounded]    Surface area =area of the top & bottom circles + the middle rectagle  Surface area =2  r2 + 16*10  Surface area =[2 * 3.14 * 2.552] + 16*10  Surface area =40.8357+ 160  Surface area = 200.8357 cm 2|`|H8moHsL7aa	Think of the cylinder like a rectangle.

14f5d1b00e3913722f81d4b3a53a087eaa	A statute in the New Jersey code states that, The driver of an overtaking motor vehicle not within a business or residence district shall give audible warning with his horn or other warning device before passing or attempting to pass a vehicle proceeding in the same direction.    That means that if you attempt to pass a car anywhere on the roadway, you have to audibly let that person know you are passing them. Whether or not you use curse words in your warning is completely up to you.   Its pretty good but I also like in pennsylvania that It is illegal to have over 16 women live in a house together because that constitutes a brothel.

JUmfm168aa	Hello,    Since -sin(x) = sin(-x), the question can be rewritten as -x = arcsin(0).    The principal value of arcsin(0) is 0, so -x = 0, then x = 0 also.    As the period of sine is 180 degrees, then -x = 0+180*n degrees, where n is any integer, (positive or negative).    Because n can be positive or negative, the minus sign is unnecessary. So x = 180*n degrees.    If you are working in radians, this is x = n*Pi radians.    [Note that these are the same points at which sin(x) = 0, since -0 = 0.]

3WIyMxMzaa	This is a very famous quote from the Declaration of Independence, no?  Okay, here goes:  "When in the course of human events"  If something happens and...  "it becomes necessary for one people"  a group of people (the United States colonies) have to  "to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another"  cut ties with another group of people (England),  "a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires"  then they (the US) should (because of honor and all that crap)  "requires that they should declare the causes whcih impel them to the separation"  explain why they are cutting ties.    Basically, the US was angry at Great Britain prior to the Revolutionary War. Thomas Jefferson, who wrote this (a long, long time ago), decided he would write up the reasons why the US was angry at Great Britain in order to explain why the were going to "dissolve the political bonds" and become independent.  Jefferson's just saying "Here follows a list of reasons why we are becoming independent:..."  Then, of course, he lists the reasons.    Hope this helps! ^_^|`|A8F4HF3Paa	When between two parties things become so difficult that one party decides they can no longer maintain the political relationship (like when the US got so sick of Britain, they decided to become their own country), it is the right thing to do to let the other party know why they want to go off on their own.|`|JGf3H3Ikaa	When one must separate politically from a group, it's proper to give a reason for the action.|`|BJaZhmqQaa	haha the Declaration of Independence...    Alright, so ill do this step by step  --- (means through)    When in the course of human events---connected them with one another..  This was the British settlers in America saying that it was necessary for them to cut any political bonds between themselves and their homeland mainly due to the British King who had complete control over them and their decisions.     A decent respect ---impel them to the separation    This means that the British in an effort to prove problem to mankind (and Britain) they should state their reasoning to separate from the British Kings ruling over them and prove that they should be a unified entity.  Hence, the Declaration of Independence are the reasons to separate from British rule.

Police Officers have the right by law to use a little bit more force than the offender.Police are required by their mission and policy to respond to, and deal with, circumstances that may require use of force. Civilians are not required to get involved in any situation requiring the use of force.Civilians have the right to use "reasonable force" (as do the police) if their perception is that an adversary is trying to hurt someone. And again in my personal opinion a person should not use excessive force. Lets say that some guy pushed me ...so what should i do get a gun and shoot him? Put the use of force model in ur presentation..i live in canada so maybe is a bit different ..I am taking Law and Security - Corrections. There is a use of force model for Corrections. Hope it helps.

I read them often.    ATTITUDE    The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life. Attitude, to me is more important than facts. It is more important than the past, than education, than money, than circumstances, than failures, than successes, than what other people think or say or do.    It is more important than appearance, gifted-ness or skill. It will make or break a company . . . a church . . . a home.     The remarkable thing is, we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day.    We cannot change our past. We can not change the fact that people act in a certain way. We can not change the inevitable. The only thing we can do is play on the one string we have, and that is our attitude.    I am convinced that life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it. And so it is with you . . . We are in charge of our attitudes.     BY: Charles Swindoll    ~~~~~   If you dont know where your going.  Any road will take you there.                          George Harrison    Be your own best friend and dont forget to wink at yourself now and then.  Diane von Furstenburg    Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take,  but by the moments that take our breath away.    If you always do what you always did,  you will always get what you always got.    The foolish man seeks happiness in the distance;   the wise man grows it under his feet.    Never mistake knowledge for wisdom, one helps you make a living,   the other helps you make a life.

They find a solution with google or whatever, and they just repeat it.    "The teacher hate me... because tautonyms are no longer allowed in botany."  Fact is, the scientific community has decided not to introduce any new tautonyms when naming species. Old ones are still used as before. But botanical names are not devised by students, they never have, and never will be. So what does that have to do with teachers?    "the cow like me... Bison bison is tautonym for American Bison."   "The cow" doesn't like bison    "Gold also like me.. Gold is a software game providing tautonyms puzzles."  No, it is not. "Tautonyms puzzle" is a completely unknown concept. Nobody knows what it is! Plus,the riddle itself doesn't even mention gold    "Monkey want to eat me...Ziziphus zizyphus is tautonym for jujube, a fruit-flavored, usually chewy candy or lozenge, liked by monkey."   No, jujube is a fruit, not a fruit flavored candy.    And it says "I am a thing". If a type of name is a THING, what isn't? It's utter nonsense.    Last but not least, the so-called solution doesn't fit the pattern of letters and dashes. WTF??

This change was only for the year 1943 and was due to the critical use of copper for the war effort. However, a limited number of copper pennies were minted that year.        * In 1962, the cent's tin content, which was quite small, was removed. That made the metal composition of the cent 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc.     * The alloy remained 95 percent copper and 5 percent zinc until 1982, when the composition was changed to 97.5 percent zinc and 2.5 percent copper (copper-plated zinc).

It is famous for its large variety in salt-resistant flora, such as Sea lavender. It is also popular with bird watchers. There is a small zoo with some major domestic birds and it is one of the few places in Belgium with a population of white storks.

IzxVlE6Caa	There are three classes of levers which represent variations in the location of the fulcrum and the input and output forces.    [edit] First-class levers  First class lever    A first-class lever is a lever in which the fulcrum is located between the input effort and the output load. In operation, a force is applied (by pulling or pushing) to a section of the bar, which causes the lever to swing about the fulcrum, overcoming the resistance force on the opposite side. The fulcrum may be at the center point of the lever as in a seesaw or at any point between the input and output. This supports the effort arm and the load.    Examples:       1. Seesaw (also known as a teeter-totter)     2. Triceps brachii muscle acting on the forearm     3. Bicycle hand brakes     4. Trebuchet     5. Crowbar (curved end of it)     6. Hammer Claw , when pulling a nail with the hammer's claw     7. Hand trucks are L-shaped but work on the same principle, with the axis as a fulcrum     8. Pliers (double lever)     9. Scissors (double lever)    10. Shoehorn    11. Spud bar (moving heavy objects)    12. Beam engine although here the aim is just to change the direction in which the applied force acts, since the fulcrum is normally in the center of the beam (i.e. D1 = D2)    13. Wheel and axle because the wheel's motions follows the fulcrum, load arm, and effort arm principle.    [edit] Second-class levers  Second class lever    In a second class lever the input effort is located at the end of the bar and the fulcrum is located at the other end of the bar, opposite to the input, with the output load at a point between these two forces. Examples:       1. Dental elevator     2. Nutcracker     3. Paddle     4. Curb bit     5. Wheelbarrow     6. Wrench     7. Bottle opener     8. Diving Board (spring board)     9. Crowbar (flat end)    10. Push-up    11. Doorknob(could be a wheel and axle also)    12. Oars (the object is to move the boat, NOT the water)    [edit] Third-class levers  Third class lever. For the lever in this diagram to work correctly, one must assume that the fulcrum is attached to the bar.    For this class of levers, the input effort is higher than the output load, which is different from second-class levers and some first-class levers. However, the distance moved by the resistance (load) is greater than the distance moved by the effort. Since this motion occurs in the same length of time, the resistance necessarily moves faster than the effort. Thus, a third-class lever still has its uses in making certain tasks easier to do. In third class levers, effort is applied between the output load on one end and the fulcrum on the opposite end.    Examples:         1. Baseball bat     2. Biceps brachii muscle acting on the forearm     3. Boat paddle     4. Broom     5. Electric Gates     6. Fishing rod     7. Hockey stick     8. Mandible     9. Mousetrap (Spring-loaded bar type)    10. Nail clippers, the main body handle exerts the incoming force    11. Shovel (the action of picking or lifting up sand or dirt)    12. Stapler    13. Tongs    14. Tweezers    15. Hammer

(ex. the Earth exerts gravitational energy on us. We exert a very small amount of gravitational energy on the Earth.)      Energy can be transformed from one type to another through several means. I gave one example of energy transformation in the solar energy ex. Potential energy can be transformed to kinetic energy if, for example, someone gave a show to the ball at the top of the hill. When it got to the bottom of the hill and eventually stopped, the energy was transformed into potential energy again.

t2SGVG1Vaa	it would make sense to capitalize "Dude," I guess...    Because when you're talking to someone and say "I love you, Mom," you're using that as their name (which, to their children or something, it basically is, because kids usually don't call their parents by their real names), so you're kind of turning it into a proper noun.    So if you call someone "dude," you could capitalize it and I don't think it would be wrong, because I suppose it's the same thing; turning it into a proper noun.
3mAgM405aa	Yes, FIDM is expensive and you should be also aware of the following:    One of the most over-rated fashion design school is FIDM which offers so-called scholarships amounting to some $36,000 in student debt. It takes the position that it offers a "prestigious" degree which will open the doors to success in the fashion and marketing fields. Unfortunately, this "prestigious" degree does not waive various job interview requirements which entail evaluation of one's portfolio, grade point average and passage of a written or oral examination. So, in the long term, you might have saved the $36,000 student debt to FIDM and instead, used it as a downpayment on a condo or house.    A better alternative is to sign up for the Design/Fashion course at Los Angeles Trade Tech which offers exactly the same instruction for a total course fee of around $970! And Trade Tech is a state-certified fully accredited trade college with all the bells and whistles associated with a Class A education.    Good luck!|`|gmaCvh00aa	What is FIDM?

LRVxW4gAaa	Your acceptance rests on a variety of factors such as your current grades, extracurricular activities and the requirements for U of Ottawa.     If your grades are holding you back, then I suggest going to community college first to bring up your GPA. If you take that option, then be sure to contact someone at U of Ottawa to make sure that whatever you take in community college will transfer. One benefit of the CC route is that it is much cheaper than a University, so you can take your general classes there then transfer to take your core classes. Good luck!

The Cunard owned Lusitania was carrying just short of 2000 passengers, including 139 Americans. Despite a valiant recovery operation throughout the night, many are feared to have perished following this cowardly and unprovoked attack. Unconfirmed reports indicate that 128 American citizens remain unaccounted for and many will be fearing the worst given the strong seas and near freezing waters. Angry protests lodged....      First subtitle: Questions in Congress over safety of US shipping    US senators have raised urgent questions about the safety of all US shipping and US civilians in the treacherous North Atlantic trade routes with Europe. Questions over tactics, whether ships have enough protection, should America enter war,       Second subtitle: Secret German-Mexican talks    Intelligence sources have reported secret meetings between the German ambassador and the Mexican government about the possibility of an anti-US alliance, if the US enters the war.

e4755faeab1ce327b95c1129793886a7aa	Increase the denominator, and you'll see them.  For example, multiply both fractions by 2/2 (which equals 1, so you're not changing the value):    1/4 * 2/2 = 2/8  2/4 * 2/2 = 4/8    So 3/8 is between them.  Or, multiply by 3/3.    1/4 * 3/3 = 3/12  2/4 * 3/3 = 6/12    4/12 and 5/12 are between them.|`|JUmfm168aa	Hello,    The easiest way would be to take the average, as it will always be exactly between the two.

hmAA75lnaa	Everybody has an everyday hero. Mine happens to be my dad, Daniel Krohn. He expects me to do my best at all costs, which is why I look up to him.    First, my dad is my hero because he makes me go the extra mile in school. He requires that I get A's and B's. When I am challenged with a project, he's always there ready to help.    Next, my dad helps out in a homeless shelter. Last summer my family and I volunteered to make snow cones and popcorn for the homeless. We spent our time doing this for almost the entire day. After we were finished we  all were ravishing for doing an indulgent deed.   Also, my hero happens to be my dad because he wants me to be successful when I'm an adult. He hopes for me to be an Entrepreneur. He owns two businesses that involve cars and computers. He always tells me he wants me to be self employed.

H8moHsL7aa	The music I like most that was composed by Tchaikovsky is the "1812 Overture" it is about the battle betwen Napoleon and Nelson, and it has cannons firing as part of it.  When it's done in public concerts sometimes they do have real cannons firing.  I don't listen to a lot of classical music, but that piece excites me, and would be great to play to get the attention of a class.  You could dress up to suit each project... dress as Tchaikovsky, and tell his story as himself.    get your teacher to introduce you to the class as Peter Tchaichovsky.     Use some funny facts to make it more interesting.     All the research would need to be like any other. Don't forget google and this site.    For the endangered environment, I was appalled to see the impact on the environment by the use of plastic bags, How they are killing turtles and other marine life, and also how the tides from the ocean dump masses of junk that has been put into the oceans on the shores of some islands and countries.     Starting from your school level, it would be great to get the information to your classmates.     Once again dress up in plastic bags or soak a stuffed seal in black oil to help you get that message across.     Show photos or slides of how turtles are dying from swallowing plastic bags which they think are jelly fish.    Make up a poem as if from a dying turtle...     Even letting balloons fly into the air is bad for the environment, because they have to come down somewhere where they can harm our land and sea environments.    Search words ;  plastic bags turtles     http://www.abc.net.au/science/features/b...    and    http://www.uq.edu.au/news/index.html?art...    Copy these if you like but Google the search words.

N8DC9foaaa	Ok, you have three different things going on in that exponent - let's look at each one -     You have a 2 as the numerator of the exponent. That means raised to that power.... or    (2x-3)^2    Now the 3 as the denominator in the exponent - those are always roots or radicals so that means:    cube root of (2x-3)^3  (I don't know how to make a cube root on this computer, but it is the square root sign with the little three in it - I am sure you have seen them! if the denominator was a 4, it would be the fourth root, etc.)    Now, you have the negative - that means that it is actually on the other side of the fraction bar - in this case it would in the denominator of a fraction - ok - hopefully this won't lose you -     so that means since it had to move to the denominator that expression is:    1/cube root of (2x-3)^3    usually you cannot have a radical in the denominator or a fraction, but I am not sure if you would need to know how to change that or not.    Hope that helps!|`|wlaEnkc9aa	I don't even know what radical form is but here I'll give it a shot:  3(2x-3)^2  The brackets are the square root although I have no clue why I just added square root and i don't know where the - goes for the -2/3 i did this at the beginning of the year sorry, hope I helped
AA10691226	The teacher wants you to describe how much (to what extent) public education in Texas fulfills the requirements of education in a democracy. To do this, you must find     1) examples of school subjects and assignments that cause the students to figure things out through talking with each other and the teacher (rational discussion)     2) make choices and estimates (decision making) and     3) learn civics, law and acceptable behavior of political figures (knowledge of the political system)    After you discuss these elements, you must state how much you think the Texas school system achieves the goal. In other words, do students in Texas learn a lot of skills in rational discussion? How much of a reputation do Texas-trained students have in this area? Do the schools do a good job of helping students learn decision making? Why do you think they do (or don't)? Do Texans know how the political system in Texas and the rest of the country works? Can you show whether they know this well or not?    Hope that helps!

DkTZI4rNaa	first you would need to find the slope. to find the slope you have to use the formula y1-y2 over x2-x1. so in your case that would be 5-0 divided by 3-0 so it would be 5/3 (that's a fraction) then that is your slope. so that would be your m. then for b which is your y intercept you just choose one of the "y's" from the two ordered pairs. Its best to choose the smaller number so in this case that would be 0. so your equation would look something like this with all the numbers in it.     y=3/5x + 0    hope this helps! :)|`|QtpROmdhaa	you find the slope first by doing  (5-0) under (3-0). So the slope is 3/5. Then you have to find b so.... 0 = 3/5(0) + b....so b is 0. so the equation is y=3/5x

AA10067221	I would use a topic that is closely connected to your particular age group or generation. Not only will you be more knowledgeable on the subject, which is required to make a proficient speech, but you will probably feel more confident in what you have to say about it.   Here are a few examples:    __1. -Cyber-bullying: explore the argument about whose responsibility it is, either the parents, teens, internet police, etc., to protect young on-line users from cyberbullying. Inform your audience of the following topics to explore regarding cyber-bullying: "gossip" on myspace/facebook, etc., the amount of influence myspace/facebook has on its users and non-users, the spread of rumors through instant messaging, and the issues regarding privacy on personal websites.    __2. -The Pursuit of Perfection: explore topics about the amount of pressure parents, schools, the media, and peers put on teens to be "perfect," successful, etc. Inform your audience on how to address solutions to this problem, such as setting realistic, obtainable goals and the possible consequences of making unrealistic expectations for yourself. Talk about the level of competition that is a contributing factor to teens trying to "keep up" with the expectations placed on them.    __3. -School Burn-Out: explore the debate about the amount of school-related activities and requirements teens face now in high school & how that often leads to "school burn-out." Inform your audience of how to prioritize their activities and limit their activities to their favorites, rather than spreading their selves too thin by engaging in a number of commitments. Inform your audience of the possible factors that contribute to "school burn-out", such as the desire to please demanding or uninvolved parents, the need to stand out in the crowd, the influence of popular culture, the overload of extracurricular activity choices, and the fear of missing out on something.    __4. -To Work or Not To Work: you could address the topic of high school employment and inform your audience on why it is either acceptable or not acceptable for teens to have jobs during their high school years. Research the benefits or the pros and cons of choosing academics over employment or vice versa and inform your audience of your research findings.    Here are additional topics for an informative speech:    --The biography of your favorite actor, writer, teacher, role-model, etc.  --The story of how your school was founded  --The history of your hometown  --Medicines from nature / common plants that cure  --Pets and their role in different cultures  --Differences in male and female communication  --The most dangerous types of jobs  --The strangest newspaper articles and when they were reported  --Interesting world records  --The intelligence of dolphins  -The strength of plastics vs. metals  -Changes in cellular phone technology  -The benefits of texting messages  -Popular trends in fashion  -Overcoming conflict  -TV sitcoms vs. motion pictures|`|cbmkx5Joaa	I did an informative speech on Plan B (the emergency contraceptive), I have also heard some done on guinea pigs (or any other animal), Invisible Children, the rules and scoring of a sport, or anything you are interested in.|`|jv0BDTNMaa	The Analog to Digital TV switch.

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, yes this applies to you too.  Patience is stronger than rage, because unlike vexation; patience can forbear.  You can try and please the world, but she will never try and please you.  Be prudent in your actions, for when all is said and done: you will have to bear the aftermath.  Ignorance is as comical as a fools pride.  The world is a beautiful and tragic place.  A place built upon the ambitious dreams of hopeful men.  A place of circumscribed opulence and equal destitution.  A place where reality and imagination clash on the battle front.    Do not let the world fool you into thinking you know.

I took it when I attended Wheatherford jr College, it's Much easier that the SAT in terms of the questions and you are not timed. You can take all the subjects in one day or spreed them out. I took everything but math on one day and gave math it's own day (it's my hardest subject) you are aloud to use a simple calculater and they supply you with pen and paper. It's nice also that you get you results instanly, but they can be confusing so you may want to discuss them with a counsler on staff. If I where to compare it to something I would say it's about the same level as the GED. It's Really not bad, when I took it the cost was 25 dollars but that has been quite a few years ago so it may have gone up. Another nice thing about the Compass is you can retake a subject if you fail it.    But if you are trying to get into a large college I would say go head and take the SAT it may be harder but it pulls more wight.    Hope this helps, good luck. :)

Obviously, then, they wouldn't want to over saturate the market with nuclear medicine technologists because the demand would go down, it would be near impossible for them to find a job, and the ones that had a job wouldn't get paid as much.

jwjD1aljaa	NAME: Madam C.J. Walker (birth name Sarah Breedlove)     DATE OF BIRTH:  December 23, 1867     PLACE OF BIRTH:  Delta, Louisiana     DATE OF DEATH:  May 25, 1919     PLACE OF DEATH:  New York, New York     FAMILY BACKGROUND: Sarah Breedlove, who later became known as Madam C. J. Walker, was born into a former-slave family to parents Owen and Minerva Breedlove. She had one older sister, Louvenia and brothers Alexander, James, Solomon and Owen, Jr. Her parents had been slaves on Robert W. Burney's Madison Parish farm which was a battle-staging area during the Civil War for General Ulysses S. Grant and his Union troops. She became an orphan at age 7 when her parents died during an epidemic of yellow fever. To escape the epidemic and failing cotton crops, the ten year old Sarah and her sister moved across the river to Vicksburg in 1878 and obtained work as maids. At the age of fourteen, Sarah married Moses McWilliams to escape her sister's abusive husband. They had a daughter, Lelia (later known as A'Lelia Walker, a central figure in the Harlem Renaissance). When Lelia was only two years old, McWilliams died.  Sarah's second marriage to John Davis August 11, 1894 failed and ended sometime in 1903. She married for the third time in January, 1906 to newspaper sales agent, Charles Joseph Walker;  they divorced around 1910.       ACCOMPLISHMENTS: Madam Walker was an entrepreneur who built her empire developing hair products for black women. She claims to have built her company on an actual dream where a large black man appeared to her and gave her a formula for curing baldness. When confronted with the idea that she was trying to conform black women's hair to that of whites, she stressed that her products were simply an attempt to help black women take proper care of their hair and promote its growth.    Illustration courtesy of the  A'Lelia Bundles/Walker Family Collection  may not be reproduced without permission        Madam Walker was quite the business woman. Her third husband, Charles Joseph Walker and her daughter Lelia had key roles in the growth and day-to-day operations of the business. In September, 1906 Madam Walker and her husband toured the country promoting their products and training sales agents while Lelia ran a mail-order operation from Denver. From 1908 to 1910 they operated a beauty training school, the Lelia College for Walker Hair Culturists, in Pittsburgh.  In 1910 they  moved the central operations to Indianapolis, then the country's largest manufacturing base, to utilize that city's access to eight major railway systems. At this height of success, Madam Walker gathered a group of key principals to run the company, and she and her husband divorced.     She became an inspiration to many black women. Fully recognizing the power of her wealth and success she lectured to promote her business which in turn empowered other women in business.  She gave lectures on black issues at conventions sponsored by powerful black institutions. She also encouraged black Americans to support the cause of World War I and worked to have black veterans granted full respect.     After the bloody East St. Louis Race Riot of 1917, Madam Walker devoted herself to having lynching made a federal crime. In 1918 she was the keynote speaker at many National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) fund raisers for the anti-lynching effort throughout the Midwest and East. She was honored later that summer by the National Association of Colored Women (NACW) for making the largest contribution to saving the home of abolitionist Frederick Douglass. She donated large sums of money to the NAACP's anti-lynching campaign and later in her life revised her will to support black schools, organizations, individuals, orphanages, retirement homes, as well as YWCAs and YMCAs.     Madam Walker's home, Villa Lewaro, was built in August of 1918 on Irvington-on-Hudson, New York. Her neighbors included industrialists Jay Gould and John D. Rockefeller. The grand estate served not only as her home but as a conference center for summits of race leaders to discuss current issues.     Madam Walker died at Villa Lewaro at the age of 51 on Sunday, May 25, 1919 from complications of hypertension. Upon her death she was considered to be the wealthiest African-American woman in America and known to be the first African-American woman millionaire.  Some sources cite her as the first self-made American woman millionaire. Her daughter Lelia succeeded her as president of the C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company.

In the United States, the first letter generally is K for stations west of the Mississippi River and W for those east of the Mississippi. There are a number of exceptions, such as KDKA in Pittsburgh and WFAA in Dallas, but these are historical artifacts from a rule change in the 1930s, and most of the exceptions are located in the states immediately to either side of the river. The westernmost station in the continental United States beginning with W is WOAI in San Antonio. WVUV-LP in Pago Pago, American Samoa, is the westernmost station with a W call-sign. KYW in Philadelphia is the easternmost station with a K call sign.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	I've no disagreement with any of the foregoing answers.  I'd just like to point out that every ocean-going vessel has a call sign too and the first letter indicates its national registry. Nations that have relatively few ships have but one distinctive initial letter. Others, such as the U.S. and the U.K. have two. It's like telephone exchanges.  The more numbers you have within them, the more you must break them down by prefixes.|`|StJGeiFyaa	The FCC says we have to do it this way. Period.  I am not sure how the total configuration for each station is finally decided. But there is a specific line of demarcation, possibly the Mississippi River, that governs part of this question.     All stations to the east of the line must have a "W" in its call letters (the station's public name) as in WNBC in New York City (NEW YORK CITY???!!!!) and represents a specific frequency on the AM band (Alternating Modulation} or the FM band (Frequency Modulation) over whichever band the station has a license to broadcast from the FCC,  For stations to the west of the line, the regs are the same with the exception that their call letters must contain the letter "K', as in KCBS (San Francisco or Los Angeles). I assume no station can have both. However, the required letter does not have to appear as the first letter. For example, CKLW is a major radio station in Detroit.     [For us old-timers: CKLW is the originating station that first wrote, produced and broadcast the radio series "The Adventure of the Lone Ranger" in the late 1930s. Its popularity caused its eventual national syndication. It ran 3 times a week in the evening until about 1954 when it became a TV series. And yes there was a time before TV! The imagination processes ran wild envisioning the action that was occurring in each show. It held many of us youngsters (youngsters then, at least} spellbound for the entire 30 minutes.]  Although they existed, prior to the 1960s, FM stations were not all that popular (weak broadcasting power and many, if not all, could only broadcast from during daylight hours so not to interfere with the major national stations signal in non-daylight hours. the signals carry much farther at night}.     They really came into prominence in the 60s, incidentally coinciding with the huge popularity that had grown for rock 'n roll music and it counterpart mandatory component, the "disk jockey". Eventually, they were given increased power and allowed to broadcast 24/7. They really did push the AM stations into the background, and rather quickly. This resulted in vacancies on the AM band.  The result allowed smaller local stations with a small radius of listeners to come into existence. This was a positive for small and tiny communities who could now have their own local station dedicated to local needs. These "little guys" could at now have their own local community station, serving local citizens, business and issues. And likely, a greater sense of community pride.  Additionally, it paved the way for special interest groups who wanted a station that had an even more rifled focus such as religious, political or ethnic platforms or focused music. Naturally there was a growth of foreign language stations to accommodate some of these needs. Tangentially, this allowed huge numbers of those whose second language was English, or spoke no English, to hear music, news and discussions in their native language.  Scan your AM dial today and I think that what will be found is mostly news, weather, sports, talk show hosts with call-in questions about topical issues, religious services, religious/spiritual/political discussions or individuals putting forth their own views on just about anything.  I hope this answers your question and likely more than you ever wanted to know about this. But there is no extra charge for the history lesson. I hope you were not bored to death by this.|`|KiWDM7wyaa	Each country has a set of alphabetic or numeric International Telecommunication Union-designated prefixes with which their call signs must begin.    There are some common conventions followed in each country. In the United States, the first letter generally is K for stations west of the Mississippi River and W for those east of the Mississippi. There are a number of exceptions, such as KDKA in Pittsburgh and WFAA in Dallas, but these are historical artifacts from a rule change in the 1930s, and most of the exceptions are located in the states immediately to either side of the river.

tW8fh4IGaa	Your last statement IS correct, but that will take place in a separate transaction.    Think of "computer equipment" as a bank account dedicated only to buying obviously equipment for computers. You take money out of this account (debit it) and put that money in your wallet for the moment (crediting the "cash" account).    Then a second transaction will happen that will eventually debit your "cash" account (bringing it back to zero) to actually purchase the equipment.    Just remember that for every debit there is a credit going somewhere else.|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	the $7k is in the account. It gets debited (subtracted, removed) from the account in the form of cash. So, if you consider "cash" to be another account, then the "cash" was credited, $7k. Then the cash was used to buy the equipment. I guess technically you'd then debit the $7k in cash to the computer equipment suppliers, but I think the important piece that's confusing you is that the transference of the electronic currency to paper currency is called a credit... to the paper currency account, better known as your hand.    btw, Softbyte would purchase this equipment electronically via banking software that would simplify bookkeeping and the time it takes to go the bank and sign off on pulling that much cash. But I guess the textbook writers didn't think about that, so whatever.    EDIT: I just realized that what I said doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. Like, I think I know what I'm talking about (although I'm never quite sure), but I don't think I explained it very well. Sorry Jamie.|`|3JGUIUEFaa	You lost me at 'OK..'|`|b85b1d404ec18c8134c1bf7b53170ed2aa	you have to just pretend that debit means add and credit means subtract.  I don't get it either, I hated accounting|`|fE7SOpwPaa	yep you is right|`|r4vihoHIaa	The terms Debit and Credit have Latin roots. Debit comes from debere, which means "to owe". The Latin debitum means "debt". Credit comes from the Latin word credere, which means "to believe" or "to entrust". It is more common to use the plural terms "Debits" and "Credits".    Historically the Debit side of an account is the left hand side of a general ledger account, while the Credit side of an account refers to the right hand side.    The concepts of 'positive' and 'negative' are different from those of 'credit' and 'debit'. While it is true that an asset account having a debit balance is in receipt of more credits than it has issued and has positive value to the entity being tracked, and a liability account having a credit balance has extended more credit than has been repaid and has a negative value to the entity being tracked, not all accounts carrying a credit balance are liabilities nor are all accounts carrying a debit balance assets. For example revenue accounts usually extend credit to asset accounts, but these credits do not have to be repaid, so they are not liabilities. As another example, expense accounts, having received credits from other asset accounts to pay expenses, carry a debit balance, but are not considered assets. The distinction between "real" accounts and "nominal" accounts is that "nominal" accounts are accounts in which to record changes in the equity or net worth. These are the revenue and expense accounts and should be thought of as a variety of equity accounts (recording how much the "entity" owes, in a sense, to the owner(s)).    Computers have no concept of "left" and "right", so instead, computer accounting systems use negative numbers to represent credits, and positive numbers to represent debits. This makes sense because a debit entry represents an inflow into an account and a credit entry represents an outlay from an account, but can seem counterintuitive until one recognizes that the receiving account is the nominal debtor and the distributing account is the nominal creditor. For example, a credit (negative value) is recorded in sales account in order for the receipt of the sale amount to be recorded as a debit (positive number) in an asset account.    If the value of the debits is greater than the value of the credits, then the balance on the account is a debit balance and should not be described as a positive value balance, but should be described as an account with a debit balance.

For "no small measure" it is kind of the same thing.  "No small" would be "large".  So "no small measure" would be "large measure".|`|rbGoxvI6aa	1. stemmed means "was caused by"  2. No small measure can be rephrased as "in large part to"

Their purpose is basically to test how well you could potentially handle college.  Some colleges generally don't accept scores below a certain number, but that doesn't mean its a failing score.  It simply wasn't enough for that college.|`|SHC0p1RQaa	just score at least 1200 but really doesnt matter|`|eLAkduCJaa	there's no set number to "pass" or "fail." You just take them and get a score. I think for the SAT something like 1500 is average. ACT I have no idea.
UJrZHOLvaa	It's not all that hard actually :)    Using the pythagorean theorem you can find H. This is done by:   h^2+2^2=3^2  h^2=5  h=sqrt(5)    Applying the pythagorean theorem to the triangle with angle D:  h will be the hypotenuse. Therefore:  (sqrt(2))^2 + (sqrt(3))^2 = (sqrt(5))^2  2+3=5  5=5  Therefore, D has to be a right angle. If it wasn't, you wouldn't be able to apply the pythagorean theorem.    Hope this helps :)|`|SEXRn1R3aa	Easy ... it's 90 degrees|`|I7r6y2rgaa	nice.|`|jbMpMY7taa	Thats part of the pythagorean therorem.

AA10515207	You ARE a good writer. I'll try to answer as many of your questions as I can.    Being a minor you would need your parents to sign the contract. But, I'm getting ahead of myself. Go to the library & look for the 2009 Guide to Literary Agents. Make sure they don't charge anything. Read all the articles before choosing. Also look for Jeff Hermann's Guide to Literary Agents. Also look @ the 2009 Writer's Market that lists publishers. Again, read the articles first. Do NOT send a publisher unsolicited manuscripts. They end up on the slush pile where they may never be seen again. This is why you need an agent. By going through a reputable publisher they'll set up book signings & a possible city-to-city tour.    Either field would be good for you. W/ journalism you could do free-lance work which while not steady work would leave time for writing. If you don't want to do just the hard facts, you might get lucky doing feature stories. A lot of newspapers are folding or cutting staff so teaching would be safer. Besides you'd get the chance to be a mentor.    I had a triple major w/ my B.A.: History/Psychology/Sociology. From a B.a. (or B.S. degree) you go to a Master's & then to a Ph.D. You can also do post-graduate work w/o getting an advanced degree or in addition to your degree. I picked up enough post-graduate classes for a degree in teaching w/ extra classes in history & economics "for the fun" of it.    A B.A. will get you in the door of teaching in elementary-high schools. Many states are now requiring a Master's after a certain number of years teaching. A Master's is needed to teach night school or community college. You can use it in many colleges, but you won't advance career or pay wise w/o the Ph.D. I'd say go for a minimum of a Master's although there are many schools where you work on the Master's & Ph.D. simultaneously.

I don't usually cut-n-paste so much but..here ya go:        Convection is the transfer of heat by the actual movement of the warmed matter. Heat leaves the coffee cup as the currents of steam and air rise. Convection is the transfer of heat energy in a gas or liquid by movement of currents. (It can also happen is some solids, like sand.) The heat moves with the fluid. Consider this: convection is responsible for making macaroni rise and fall in a pot of heated water. The warmer portions of the water are less dense and therefore, they rise. Meanwhile, the cooler portions of the water fall because they are denser.    Conduction is the transfer of energy through matter from particle to particle. It is the transfer and distribution of heat energy from atom to atom within a substance. For example, a spoon in a cup of hot soup becomes warmer because the heat from the soup is conducted along the spoon. Conduction is most effective in solids-but it can happen in fluids.|`|qUjo3J9waa	your cute lol ;]|`|mMXvbANyaa	Convection- is the transfer of heat by the actual movement of the warmed matter.

HnEcgVGiaa	Seems like a college essay topic!    It's basically saying that YOU should be the pioneer. Dare to venture into the unknown. Lead others. It's about leadership and bravery - taking initiation to do things. Instead of copying the paths of others, your life is unique - and so should you make it. While you can LEARN from other people's journeys, the one that you actually walk on is from what you create. But of course, along with being bold, you should also be careful and taking responsibility for your actions and decisions.     Read Dr. Seuss's "Oh the Places You'll Go!" It's a classic book written for children, but the moral is for EVERYONE.         * You have brains in your head.        You have feet in your shoes.        You can steer yourself        any direction you choose.        You're on your own.        And you know what you know.        And YOU are the one who'll decide where to go.        * You wont lag behind, because youll have the speed.        Youll pass the whole gang and youll soon take the lead.        Wherever you fly, youll be the best of the best.        Wherever you go, you will top all the rest.        * I'm sorry to say so        But, sadly it's true        That bang-ups and hang-ups        Can happen to you.        * On an on you will hike, And I know youll hike far        and face up to your problems whatever they are.          Youll get mixed up of course, as you already know.        Youll get mixed up with many strange birds as you go.          So be sure when you step.        Step with care and great tact        And remember that Lifes a great balancing act.          Just never forget to be dexterous and deft.        And never mix up your right foot with your left.        * Will you succeed?        Yes you will indeed!        (98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed.)|`|glynFK9haa	Basically, it means not to follow what everyone else does.

Basically to be a leader not a follower.      Sometimes it may take more effort to forge your own untried ways of doing things, or your ideas, but in the process as you succeed you show others they can do it and be successful at it as well, thus giving them the confidence and incentive to also forge their own pathways and succeed as you have.    It is the road less travelled that may lead to the abundance of all things desired.  Extra effort is needed but it will reap greater rewards.    Peace|`|tVkH44yuaa	You shouldn't just go with the flow.

40MY7GHgaa	Simple pendulum     There is some complicated formula about squaring the number of the length units of the pendulum to increase the swing.  However, I remember the bit that says,   "The longer the pendulum is, the greater the period of each swing. If you increase the length four times, you will double the period of the swing."     Interestingly, if the pendulum is supported by a very light wire or string then the weight (or mass) of the object at the end of the pendulum does not affect the period of the swing.
994670ca41d826aece2d84a597d92aaeaa	Heyy!   So I'm trying to give you hope. Unlike you, I had a bad freshman year, but my sophomore year grades were Bs (I got Cs my frosh year).  The one thing that helped me were the As I got both during my junior year and senior year.  Oh and standardized scores and activities help too, but that's beside the point.  If you are worried about your grades, apply early decision, they will receive your Midterm Grade Report (halfway through your senior year) and those sophomore year grades will be a thing of the past.  If it helps I got into both Harvard and Princeton, so one bad semester will not kill you. Also if there is a reason your grades were poor this  semester there will be an additional information section on your application where you will be able to fully describe that.    I wish you the best of luck in the upcoming years! and don't stress about college too much yet, the application process is long enough!!|`|1YcKHGLqaa	You're fine. I had a 3.75 and got a full ride to a super nice private school. Keep up the good grades and never think that they don't matter! Take AP classes if they're offered, and keep that GPA up! Also, get into extracurriculars and make friends with some teachers. It really helps. Colleges would rather have a well rounded kid with a 3.7 than a boring one with a 4.0.     Start shopping for schools early and apply for scholarships now (try fastwebs.com for those). Apply to schools EARLY your senior year and do a ton of visits your junior year. Applying early can be the difference between a full ride and a $5000 scholarship.     Long story short: you're good :) no worries.|`|d9BmrFycaa	Just make sure to kick it up a notch for the 2nd semester.. all colleges look at is the final grades anyway!

Rm9mII46aa	Well...poetry, of course, is open to interpretation. It could mean any of a hundred things, but...    If I had to guess, I'd say it's a poem about learning self-reliance. Throughout the poem, she refers to voices pulling her in various directions, making demands on her, and generally being burdens to her saving "the only life" she could save (her own). The imagery of blocked paths and the wind prying with "stiff fingers" represents stoppages on her way to finding her own voice. "The Journey" probably refers to the journey of life, where at some point you have to find your own voice in order to live your own life.     The poem could also refer to her path as a poet, whereby she was called upon to "mend" people's lives with her words, but instead she realized that she had to write for herself.

cL0aHkYEaa	Some minor problems...    For your first clause, try it like this:  "Looking back two years, I ....."  and then compare it to what you have with "ago" at the end.  "ago" is not so much incorrect as it is redundant; if you were looking back, well, that means you were looking some time ago, so the ago isn't needed.    For the last part, it should be, "...I never would have expected that I would change so dramatically."    So your final product would be, " Looking back two years, I never would have thought that I would change so dramatically."  "never" is an adverb that modifies "would have thought" which is the conditional perfect tense (good job on getting all the components of that tense--many do not!)    Don't forget the period inside the quotes after the word dramatically.|`|GR2XNzCCaa	Looking back to two years ago, I would have never expected that I would have changed so dramatically.|`|MW5EJxKNaa	It sounds alright.

40MY7GHgaa	Hi, Patricia!    I am only answering this because the first answerer has made some mistakes in questions 2 and 3.    1. each angle of an equailateral triangle has what measure?  can you tell me how you came up with that answer?  The angles in any triangle add up to 180 degrees so each of the three equal angles must be 60 degrees each.    2. one angle of a triangle is a right angle. The third angle is three times the smallest angle. what are their measures?  The right angle is 90 degrees so you have 90 degrees left to split up where the third angle is three times the smallest angle. So the two smaller ones in a ratio of 1:3 - so they are 22 1/2 degrees and 67 1/2 degrees.    3. One angle of an isoceles triangle has measure 39. What are the possible ,easure of the other angles?  Two possible answers -  If 39 degrees is the unequal angle of the triangle then the two other angles are each half of the remaining 141 degrees inside the triangle. This makes 70 1/2 degrees each.  If the 39 degrees is one of the equal angles you have 39 degrees and 39 degrees and what is left of the 180 degrees which is 102 degrees for the third unequal angle.|`|TPpTAKAdaa	1.  Since the definition of an equilateral triangle is that all the angles are equal, and the measure of every triangle is 180 degrees, all you have to do is divide 180 by 3 (there are 3 anglles in a triangle ), so the answer is 60 degrees    2. So you know one angle is 90 degrees by definition of a right angle.    Let Let x be the smallest angle.  So, the third angle is greater than x and is 3x (three times the smallest angle).  You know that all the angles in a triangle equal 180 degrees, so 90+3x+x=180, now just solve for x (which is the smallest angle).  Combine like terms; 90+4x=180.  subtract 90.  4x=90 divide by four.  x=22.5    So, the smallest angle is 22.5, and since the third angle is three times that, the third angle equals 67.5, and the right angle's 90 degrees    3. The definition of an isosceles traingle is that the base angles must be congruent.  Therefore, one possibility is that two angles measure 39 degrees, while the third measures 78 degrees (180-39+39).|`|wHL0Jw23aa	1. Well you have to know how many degrees are in a triangle and divide that by 3 since it's an equailateral triangle. 180/3= 60 for each angle    2.90 30 and 60   ....180-90=90 so u need to equal 90 so 30 and 60    3. 180-39=141 then split it in two. =)

Sorry to break it to you, but unless you have a really good reason for getting a 2.6, I don't think you will be getting into UCLA.    For UCLA, accepted students generally have 4.1+, 2050+ (SAT score). UC's only look at 10th and 11th grade for GPA (they don't want to see you mess up senior year though).    UCI is getting more competitive every year, and now, they are looking for 3.7+ (UC weighted), and a 1900+.     ^these stats do not necessarily make or break you, but these seem to be the general trend    These are things to work for, and really, you should buckle down and try as hard as you can for the next couple years.    If things don't work out, there is always the CSU and city college system.    Best of luck!
jwjD1aljaa	The protagonist is often the main character (the central or main figure) of a story. However, the terms protagonist, main character and hero are variously (and rarely well) defined, and depending on the source, may denote different concepts. The word "protagonist" derives from the Greek ?? (protagonistes), "one who plays the first part, chief actor";[1][2] but in some plots, the main character is not the actual protagonist.      The story of the protagonist may be told from the perspective of a different character (who may also, but not necessarily, be the narrator). In such cases, it may be helpful to define the character through whose perspective the plot is followed as the main character, the main character having here a separate function from the protagonist. An example would be a narrator who relates the fate of several protangonists, perhaps as prominent figures recalled in a biographical perspective.    The principal opponent of the protagonist is a character known as the antagonist, who represents or creates obstacles that the protagonist(s) must overcome. As with protagonists, there may be more than one antagonist in a story.(Note that the term antagonist in this context is much more recent than the term protagonist, and rests on the same misconception as the use of protagonist to mean a proponent. See below.)    Sometimes, a work will initially highlight a particular character, as though being the protagonist, and then unexpectedly dispose of that character, as a dramatic device. Such a character is called a false protagonist.    [edit] Protagonist or protagonists  In an ancient Greek drama, the protagonist was the leading actor, and as such, there could only be one protagonist in a play.[citation needed] However the word has been used in the plural to mean 'important actors' or 'principal characters' since at least 1671, when John Dryden wrote, "Tis charg'd upon me that I make debauch'd persons... my protagonists, or the chief persons of the drama."[3]      [edit] Protagonist as proponent  The use of 'protagonist' in place of 'proponent' became common in the 20th century and may have been influenced by a misconception that the first syllable of the word represents the prefix "pro-" (i.e. 'favoring') rather than "proto-", meaning first (as opposed to "deuter-", second, as in deuteragonist, or "tri-", third, in tritagonist). For example, usage such as "He was an early protagonist of nuclear power" can be replaced by 'advocate' or 'proponent'.[3]      [edit] Protagonist in psychodrama  In psychodrama, the "protagonist" is the person (group member, patient or client) who decides to enact some significant aspect of his life, experiences or relationships on stage with the help of the psychodrama director and other group members, taking supplementary roles as auxiliary egos

I don't have the sq.root button on here, so I'll use this thingy instead haha  {=sq.root    example: 7{12-5{27+6{300  step 1- break each radical down, so 7{12 would be 7{3{4  7{3{4-5{9{3+6{3{100  step 2- break one of the radicals down again, and times it with the other number so 7{3{4 would be 2^7{3, *make sure that each number has the same radical, so since they all have 3, keep 3:  2^7{3-3^5{3+6^10{100  then put the answer of what you multiplied  14{3-15{3+60{3 (see how they all have the same radical now, 3)  so now you can combine them   the answer is = 59{3    hope I didn't confuse you!:)

Then the first page will have your intro and first body paragraph..and the bodies will continue to probably page 8, where you will have  a conclusion. At page nine you will have a works cited, and page ten is a bibliography.    That's how we're taught at my school

KAX9FURMaa	Study before you go to sleep. Your brain needs around 30 minutes to transfer information from short term to long term memory. You are less likely to be distracted (and forget) if you rest after you have studied.    Also try and get 9 hours sleep (research shows that students need 9 hours sleep each night to reach there academic potential)    I also find mind maps help. I am a visual learner. Maybe you are too.

I study while listening to music. When I think about the music that I was listening to when i was studying while I'm taking the test, it usually helps me remember what i studied. When you are studying with flashcards, study for about half an hour, then take a fifteen minute break. Just repeat the cycle until you feel like you studied well enough. then, either the next morning or about an hour after you finished studying, re-test yourself or ask a friend to test you. if you do good on your re-test, then your set. If not, study more. Try doing this (the re-test) a Day or two before the test.    NOTE: I read about a study that if you wear mint flavored lotion while you study, and you wear it on the day of your test, the smell of the lotion will help you remember what you studied.    hope this info helps!
OAEuYZkZaa	The trigger point was the assassination of Grand Duke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Grand Duchess Sophie Serbian subject.  Franz Ferdinand was the heir apparent to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.    Austria and the Kingdom of Serbia were squabbling over possession of Bosnia-Herzgovina.  After the assassination, Austria, at the urging of Germany, issued a strongly worded, insulting ultimatum to Serbia.  Serbia, bolstered by guarantees from Czarist Russia, who in turn was encouraged by France and Great Britain, defied the Austrian ultimatum.  In the closing days of July, 1914, heated diplomatic exchanges flashed from vienna, Belgrade, St Petersburg, Berlin, Paris, and London.  Finally resulting in the beginning of The Great War in August, 1914.    Conflicting alliances, conflicting goals, conflicting social and political ideologies, and conflicting nationalistic fervor made war in Europe inevitable.  Had Gavrillo Principe failed in his attempt on the life of Franz Ferdinand, Europe would still have found some reason to plunge itself into war.  Austria's Empire was falling apart.  Germany felt itself to be hemmed int and isolated by British naval power and colonial possessions. France burned for revenge against Germany for its humiliating defeat in the Franco-Prussian War.  Russia ruling dynasty, the Romanov's, was already treading shaky ground and the spirit of revolution and reform were growing stronger.  Russia wanted some event to unite all factions and what could be better than war to defend the Motherland an fellow Slavs?  Britain was jealous of its position as the most powerful nation on Earth militarily, politically and commercially wanted to maintain the status quo and keep a balance of power both in Europe and the World.    There are enough reasons that a person could write volumes on the subject and still never uncover all the roots and reasons for the Great War.  Suffice it to say that reasons were many, and were more complicated, convoluted, and confusing than simply the death of a Austrian heir.

NOgOdT7saa	Ok I'll try to explain this as best as I can.    You multiply the 6 times (z-2) because of the distributive property.   So then, you have 6z-12+3=3z-15.  Now, add the numbers on the left side to get 6z-9=3z-15.  Now's when it might get confusing. Subtract 3z from the right to get rid of it. In turn, you must subtract 3z from the left to make it equal.  So, then you have 3z-9=-15.  Now, add 9 to each side to cancel out the -9 on the left. 3z=-6  Finally, divide each side by 3 to get z=-2.    Overall, you are trying to get the variable (x,y,z, etc) by itself, with a number on the other.     Hope that helped, good luck with your test/grades.|`|QEeZgoViaa	6(z-2)+3=15  6z-12+3=15--->Distribute   6z+3=15+12 ---> combine like terms  6z=15+12+3----> combine like terms  6z=30   6z/6 =30/6 ----->divide to get z by itself    z=5    I doubt the answer is -2.|`|SEXRn1R3aa	6(z-2)+3= 3z - 15    Do foil method: 6z -12 + 3 = 3z - 15    Next, combine like terms:   6z -12 + 3 = 3z - 15                                               +15     =      +15                                       ------------------------------------  You have: 6z +3 +3 = 3z    Now isolate z:   6z +6 =3z                         -6z     =-6z                       ----------------------    You have: 6 = -3z    Divide by -3 to isolate z    You have  6 = -3z                 --------------                 -3 = -3    Now here's your answer - 2 = z    or you can write it z = -2 .

In sentences written in passive voice, the subject receives the action expressed in the verb; the subject is acted upon. The agent performing the action may appear in a "by the . . ." phrase or may be omitted.    In sentences written in active voice, the subject performs the action expressed in the verb; the subject acts.    To make that passive I suggest saying:      The war was fought to extend influence     would change to an infinitive passive:     "Their influence is extended by the war they fight"|`|CQ6vZMV8aa	the first|`|6eAkoLhaaa	It needs to be: "They fought the war to extend influence"    Active/Passive is so weird.

The degrees they issue are often exactly the same as if you attended the school so future employers need not even know.<br>  <br>  Thanks<br>  Bill|`|iEExVH1eaa	Yes and no. An online degree may never have the prestige of a brick-and-mortar university, and no online universities have the kind of reputation or name that opens doors for you.<br>  <br>  That said, employers appreciate and value education and work ethic. There is a common misconception that a university degree is a job ticket. For certain schools like MIT, Yale, Harvard, you will likely get fast-tracked into an interview; however, it is still the in-person interview that gets you the job. This means you have to be able to sell yourself.<br>  <br>  You need to think of education as a gym for your mind, not as an issuer of paper. What you get out of it is what you put into it; you need to be able to demonstrate the applicability of what you have learned. When taking a degree from an online institution, choose papers and projects that have real-world applicability in your prospective career. <br>  <br>  You DO need to do some research on the quality of the course offerings; try to find out what the alumni of the university have said about it, and how many are in meaningful employment related to their field.<br>  <br>  University -- real world or virtual -- is a proving ground for yourself, a chance for you to learn and grow. A hardworking, creative individual with real-world experience, a strong analytical mind, and superior communication and social skills is a valuable resource, no matter from where they got their credentials.

GZbfsTBCaa	He got it backwards.    If x and y are complementary then x+y = 90    If x and y are supplementary then x+y = 180.    Example: Find complementary of 56.  Answer: 90-56 = 34.|`|364678252fa4e1e531d34011d062c94daa	Supplementary angles are two angles that equal 180 degrees. For example, if I told you that an angle was 56 degrees, the supplement of it would be 124 degrees because 124 plus 56 would be 180, all you had to do was subtract 56 from 180.              Complementary angles are two angles that equal 90 degrees. For example, if I told you that an angle was 89 degrees, the complement of it would be 1 degree, because 89 plus 1 is 90, all you had to do was subtract 89 from 90.             A vertical angle is when you make 2 intersecting lines and get two equal and opposite angles. For example, when you intersect 2 lines, you get 4 angles right? Well, pick any angle, the one opposite is equal to that angle. These angles are called vertical angles. There are 2 sets ofvertical angles each time you intersect lines.            Adjacent angles are basically angles that share a side. Like the image on http://www.answers.com/topic/adjacent-an...     I hope I have helped! (And that you'll pick mine as the best answer. I'm a sixth grader too! Though I do harder math.)|`|70233e2f2461ffbb9d4ee7546d392f76aa	The complementary is what will make it equal 90 degrees, and the supplementary is 180.    For example, given angle 40 degrees, what is the:  a) complementary angle?  b) supplementary angle?    To solve for A, simply take 90 - 40.  The answer is 50 degrees.    To solve for B, simple take 180 - 40.  The answer is 140 degrees.|`|46ead6ffe5dabe3df32cd2b93bab95d7aa	complementry means that 2 angles=180degrees and suplementry means 2 angles = 90 degress|`|03bdc4fd58753c8e8e0eafc1edc7ff42aa	okay supplement is 180 degrees and complent is 90 degrees.

Adjacent is also hard to explain but its got to do with parallel lines. They add up to 180degrees.

They pay is better and you will find it easier to get a job with a degree from an accreditted 4 yr school.  With a two year degree alot of the bigger companies will want you to have field experience as well.  There are many good state schools in Texas that offer construction management degrees.

If you want to help develop new alternative energies, then a science degree would be good (e.g., physics, chemistry, geology, biochemistry...depends on the type of energy you're interested in...even engineering). If you are more interested in policy, then certain colleges have multi-disciplinary majors, e.g., Science, Technology, and Society (STS) that often allows you to specialize more than a general policy-leaning degree like political science typically provides.

b8033bf8d408fe319ec07b82e0011ba6aa	http://www.volokh.com/2004_01_18_volokh_...    Annual Report to the Faculty of the College     By John W. Boyer, Dean of the College   October 22, 1996     I.     Last year was a good year for the College. We started the year with an expanded and very successful Orientation Week and finished it with a grand party for all graduating seniors and their parents, siblings, and other relatives at the Museum of Science and Industry the night before graduation, attended by almost 3,500 people, most of whom were in quite happy spirits. In between our students prospered; won numerous competitive fellowships, including a Rhodes and a Marshall; enjoyed the new Reynolds Club Phase I with its restored lounges, coffee bars, pool tables, working fireplaces; won various athletic distinctions; and above all, they had the privilege of studying and learning at one of the very best university-based liberal arts colleges in the United States.     To run such a college is the work of many, many devoted and dedicated people, and to the Collegiate Masters, the staff of the Dean of Students office, the Office of Admissions, and the Office of College Aid, not to mention Ted Cook, Jeff Slovak, Art Sussman, Ed Turkington, Sherry Gutman, Bill Michel, and to a legion of other colleagues, I offer my warmest and most sincere thanks. As we plan wisely for the future, as we consider ways of doing what we do even more effectively and more successfully, let us not forget that we have now one of the very finest liberal arts colleges in the     United States.     Last year was a banner year for applications, up over 1,000 from the year before. The entering class this year980 first-years and 58 transfer studentsis stronger than ever. Reports from the fieldfrom you who are teaching these studentsare strongly positive about their ambition, their intelligence, and their love of learning. We must never forget that what this College is ultimately about is recruiting and teaching students of this caliber, students who truly want to educate themselves. I thank Ted ONeill and the members of his staff for their work in achieving this record number of applications and in bringing in a new class of such quality and good cheer, and I thank Jean Treese and her Orientation staff, including the hundreds of College students who served as O-Aides, for their dedicated service.     On the faculty side of things we launched the first part of a two-year process of thinking about the future shape of the Colleges curriculum with a very well attended two-day faculty retreat in December. The sizable group of colleagues who make up the College Curriculum Group then spent the Winter and Spring quarters thinking about basic issues of Core and concentration design. This year, during the Autumn and Winter quarters, the Curriculum Group will complete its review with a hands-on, component-by-component examination of each of the elements of the current Core programs. The goal of this review is to ask serious questions about how well the curriculum passed ten years ago has functioned and how well we anticipate it will continue to function in the next decade of our history. We will also seek to learn how well the various components fulfill the normative ideals which they espouse, and how effectively they provide our students with the kind of broad, interdisciplinary learning experience which has always been at the heart of the Chicago approach to liberal education. During the Winter and early Spring quarters we will also have joint presentations by the Collegiate Masters and divisional Deans to the College Council on the present status and future prospects of the various concentration programs. Early in the Spring Quarter I will then reconvene the Curriculum Group and invite them to formulate proposals for strengthening the curriculum, which we will bring to the College Council for discussion, debate, and legislative action.     I am also pleased to report that the College played a substantial role in the successful completion of the Campaign for the Next Century. Thirty-seven percent of all individual gifts to the campaign came from alumni of the College, and those gifts accounted for 61 percent of the total dollars received from alumni during the campaign. And it is perhaps not too silly to mention that in the U.S. News and World Report rankings, we were not only ranked third in the nation in academic reputation, but also fifth in the nation in the rate of alumni giving. I am especially pleased to be able to announce that in the last three years we have managed to raise six new endowed College professorships. My goal is to double that numberthat is, to raise an additional twelve chairsover the next six years, and I am confident that this is a realistic and attainable goal. I have also found that support for student research and internships is especially attractive for potential donors to the College. Since the College seeks to increase substantially the number of these opportunities available to its students, we have also made support for them one of Colleges fund-raising priorities.     The enhancement of internship possibilities is also linked to our increasingly close collaboration with CAPS. As you know, in the past CAPS enjoyed a rather beleaguered reputation among our students and recent alums; recent surveys, self-studies, and consultants reports were unanimous in criticizing the level of service that CAPS provided. But with the appointment of Bob Riesman as the new Director, that profile has quickly changed, and we have spent the last year planning several new joint initiatives. One of the most significant ventures will involve a very substantial increase in the Colleges program of research and policy internships in Washington, D.C. This initiative will begin to bear|`|AA10824381	close to 100 thousand

There would be a Jerry Springer moment involved.|`|CD6NJWmaaa	whats the question?
g4a7LdS4aa	This question is asked here weekly, please search previously asked queries, anywho, here goes    Aesthetics    I personally think that the 10:10 position (sometimes 10:12 or 10:08) was adopted for pictures of clocks and watches because it is symmetric and looks better. Today the symmetric positions are both aesthetic and customary. Other symmetric hand positions are also used, but not as frequently. Examples include 8:20, 8:18, and 2:50. Reviewing some Seth Thomas clock catalog illustrations, I see a gradually increasing symmetry of the hands as the catalogs progress from 1878 to 1940.    "We always put hands to 10.10 here and in other collections I'm responsible for. The answer is probably quite simply that it looks better, aesthetically and practically, as the clock has a 'smile' on its face (not just a marketing gimmick, it really does look better than a 'down turned mouth' at 8.20) and, as others have said, because it keeps the hands clear of signatures and other subsidiary dials. I note that not every firm uses that position in their marketing though. Synchronome, for example, appear to depict their dials at 3.00." - Jonathan Betts    "The opinions I've read tend toward 'framing' the maker's name on the clock face. Viz: when the logo is placed above the center, the hands are at 10:10 but when the logo is below the center, the hands are shown at 8:20 framing the maker's name. Wristwatch advertising follows this trend." - Les Lesovsky    "Thomas A. Frank wrote: '...most manufacturers trademarks are just above the center pipe, and having the hands at 10:10 causes your eye to naturally follow to the trough, thus bringing your view right to the trademark....' and often the Model name is centered under the center pipe, ruling out any hand more or less straight down (between 5 and 7). Date windows most often are at 9 or 3, and subsidiary seconds usually at 6. For aesthetic reasons you want the two hands neither nearly covering each other nor nearly in a straight line. By default the 10h10 looks pretty good." - Fortunat Mueller-Maerki  "Smile" Theory    It has been suggested that the 10:10 position is used because it resembles a smile.    "I too have heard the 'smile' theory, which makes some sense from the emotional marketing perspective. Equally likely is the fact that most manufacturer's trademarks are just above the center pipe, and having the hands at 10:10 causes your eye to naturally follow to the trough, thus bringing your view right to the trademark." - Tom Frank  Time of Abraham Lincoln's Death    U.S. President Abraham Lincoln died at 7:22 a.m. on April 15, 1865, although he was shot at 10:15 p.m. on April 14, 1865. Although this has been suggested, I doubt that the position of the hands commemorates the time of Lincoln's assassination or death.|`|Zp4XMjI2aa	I read somewhere that the reason for that is it's a subconscious message of positivity.
