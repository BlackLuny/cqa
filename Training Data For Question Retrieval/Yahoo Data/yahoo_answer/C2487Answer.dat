iNXqiDIYaa	Differences from the poem<br>  <br>  One objective of Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary was to offer their own interpretation for motivations behind Grendel's behavior as well as for what happened when Beowulf was in the cave of Grendel's mother. They justified these choices by arguing that Beowulf acts as an unreliable narrator in the portion of the poem in which he describes his battle with Grendel's mother.[13] These choices also helped them to better connect the third act to the second of their screenplay, which is divided in the poem by a 50-year gap.[14]<br>  <br>  Some of the changes made by the film as noted by scholars include: the style and tone of the dialog; the portrayal of Beowulf as a flawed man rather than a standard hero; the addition of Christian elements and the portrayal of Unferth in this context; the hedonism in Heorot and which kingdom Beowulf becomes ruler of (instead of his native Geatland); the portrayal of Grendel's mother as a "seductress" and her seduction of Hrothgar, making him the father of Grendel, and making Beowulf the father of the dragon, as well as the elimination of the battle sequence between Grendel's mother and Beowulf which, in the poem, ends with her death; the portrayal of King Hrothgar as a "hedonistic lout," or "a drunk and womanizer" and the elimination of his two sons with Wealtheow; Wiglaf's role; and the nature of Beowulf's funeral.[15][16][17]<br>  <br>  Scholars and authors have also commented on these changes. Southern Methodist University's Director of Medieval Studies Bonnie Wheeler is "convinced that the new Robert Zemeckis movie treatment sacrifices the power of the original for a plot line that propels Beowulf into seduction by Angelina Jolie -- the mother of the monster he has just slain.' What man doesn’t get involved with Angelina Jolie?' Wheeler asks. 'It’s a great cop-out on a great poem.' [...] 'For me, the sad thing is the movie returns to…a view of the horror of woman, the monstrous female who will kill off the male,' Wheeler says. 'It seems to me you could do so much better now. And the story of Beowulf is so much more powerful.'"[18] Other commentators pointed to the theories ellucidated in John Grigsby's work Beowulf and Grendel, where Grendel's mother was linked with the ancient Germanic fertility goddess Nerthus.[19]<br>  <br>  In addition, philosophy professor Stephen T. Asma argues that "Zemeckis's more tender-minded film version suggests that the people who cast out Grendel are the real monsters. The monster, according to this charity paradigm, is just misunderstood rather than evil (similar to the version presented in John Gardner's novel Grendel). The blame for Grendel's violence is shifted to the humans, who sinned against him earlier and brought the vengeance upon themselves. The only real monsters, in this tradition, are pride and prejudice. In the film, Grendel is even visually altered after his injury to look like an innocent, albeit scaly, little child. In the original Beowulf, the monsters are outcasts because they're bad (just as Cain, their progenitor, was outcast because he killed his brother), but in the film Beowulf the monsters are bad because they're outcasts [...] Contrary to the original Beowulf, the new film wants us to understand and humanize our monsters

Then, go over it in pencil, but darker. Hope I helped, xxx. ;o)|`|WlliZdy1aa	If you are a beginner, it may take a while for it to look like them.<br>  <br>  The first realistic drawing I did took me three days, and it still looked amature.<br>  If you can, print out a black and white picture. Try to make sure that the picture is as large and as clear as possible.<br>  <br>  What my teacher had us do was draw a grid over the picture - Numbers on the X Axis, Letters on the Y Axis, or vise versa.<br>  After that, LIGHTLY draw a larger scale grid on the drawing paper.<br>  Make sure that it is of correct measurement.<br>  (Say the picture is 12 inches by 14 inches, and every grid box is 1 inch by 1 inch. The drawing paper is 24 inches by 28 inches. So, instead of having a 1 inch by 1 inch grid box, you'd have a 2 inch by 2 inch. This ensures no mess-ups in proportion.)<br>  <br>  Study one grid box, and then lightly draw in the lines you see in that box onto the drawing paper.<br>  Be patient - you can always erase.<br>  <br>  Now, making a person looking like an actual, distinctive person is more in the shading then the outlining. Shading correctly is very important.<br>  <br>  Example 1:<br>  <a href="http://www.amphi-festival.de/images/bands/emilieautumn.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.amphi-festival.de/images/band...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/azaleawildflower/Emilie2final.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/azaleawildflower...</a><br>  <br>  Example 2:<br>  <a href="http://fc37.deviantart.com/fs31/f/2008/235/9/a/Emilie_Autumn__drawing_by_Narcotic_Cherry.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://fc37.deviantart.com/fs31/f/2008/2...</a><br>  <a href="http://theyfell.com/23973661_Emilie_Autumn.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://theyfell.com/23973661_Emilie_Autu...</a><br>  <br>  See how the first set of exampls look more realistic, because care was put into the shading.<br>  Those may not be the best examples ever, but you get the idea.<br>  In the end, you really shouldn't be able to see any of the pencil outline because the shading would be so in-depth.<br>  This is a good example of such:<br>  <a href="http://z.about.com/d/drawsketch/1/0/G/M/chito_heather.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/drawsketch/1/0/G/M/...</a><br>  <br>  See - in this picture, they have the face outlined, the hair outlined, the clothes, bla bla bla. It's still drawn nicely, but comparing it to the picture above makes it still look less realistic.<br>  <a href="http://www.ebsqart.com/Art/12409/381662.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ebsqart.com/Art/12409/381662....</a><br>  <br>  Usually when getting rid of these outlines, you shade light next to dark, dark next to light, however you'd like to word it. That way you can tell the difference between the face from the hair or from the background, etc.<br>  <br>  Definitely do NOT expect to be perfect on the first, second, or even third try.<br>  I've been drawing ever since I could pick up a pencil, and even though I'd like to say that I've improved since preschool, I also know that there is much room for improvement.<br>  <br>  NOTES:<br>  When drawing, don't use mechanical pencils. The lead sucks. When you use a mechanical pencil, it is harder to shade, and if you mess up, you can still see the line where it is (the lead sort of makes an impression on the paper). Those impressions are hard to get rid of and make a mess of the portrait.<br>  <br>  When drawing eyelashes that are facing you, don't make them huge and obnoxious and what not. It's difficult to explain with only a keyboard.<br>  But what you do is make small little lines that go in an upward direction, not outward.<br>  <a href="http://www.stars-portraits.com/tutorial/resources/drawing-eye/drawing-eye-29.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.stars-portraits.com/tutorial/...</a><br>  <br>  Lastly-<br>  Drawing hair or fuzz is the most difficult and tedious part of the entire project, in my opinion. Drawing blonde hair or fuzz is even worse. Just try to take your time on it, even if you don't feel like drawing out every single strand. If the hair is shining, leave that part of the piece alone until afterward, in which you can add few lines to show in which direction the hair is going.<br>  <a href="http://www.aurelia-art.com/wip/hairleia/leiahairstep4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aurelia-art.com/wip/hairleia/...</a><br>  <br>  Using more than one kind of pencil is usually helpful if you have a lot of shadows or highlights in the photo you want to draw.<br>  <a href="http://www.artpurveyors.com/graphite-swatch.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.artpurveyors.com/graphite-swa...</a><br>  The everyday common pencil is called your typical HB pencil.<br>  <br>  Blending the pencil with your fingers while shading is convenient, but it often leads to smudging.<br>  A tissue or some other blending tool is usually the better way to go.<br>  <br>  <br>  This website is a bit dull looking, but it does point out some good tips.<br>  <a href="http://www.jdhillberry.com/how_to_draw_pg2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jdhillberry.com/how_to_draw_p...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and don't give up!|`|d4BAFpbpaa	Note: For the smudging problem mentioned, I found an Artist's Drawing Glove that only covers the side of your hand to prevent smudging. It doesn't interfere with how you hold your pencil and is right or left handed. I love my glove and would never draw without it. The glove works much better than placing paper over your drawing, or messing with workable fixative. For 14.99 USD (+ 1.99 USD shipping and handling) you can buy one at the website artisticvizions.com.|`|RXvZvnJHaa	All drawing is the same -- look at your model and draw what you see.  You can take classes or study out of books.  Learning to draw is almost completely a matter of learning to see.|`|b6a987550f582ba088fcd9ab0f50f52aaa	Look at them while you draw.  If that's not possible, use a photo.  Drawing from life is infinitely easier than drawing from memory.

Sometimes, some books just don't get us that excited to read, and you have to just slog through.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZgkMNG8qaa	Its hard reading a book because you have to, what is it that causing your lack of motivation? quite often for me its a form of literature I don't normally read and hold pre-judgments on it. <br>  <br>  Try and find a way into the story, via a theme or character that you can relate to, if you can't relate to anything, then perhaps that's your way into it, find out why you can't relate to it, if the story bores you, why does it bore you, you have the starting of your review then also.|`|niv8xoRdaa	Try skimming along. It's so hard when you really get bogged down with each and every word.

After you're hocked you can always go back and check out what you've missed!

Maybe indirectly, through trade or disease. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, the feudal structure of medieval Europe was similar to the one in Japan, where warring lords dominated the mostly agrarian society.

KGj1dxhQaa	i don't think it's too late, but it would really help your chances by getting help with other people or groups the sooner the better. go to college for a degree geared towards acting and what you want to do with it (theatre, film...etc.) it's kinda hard to do on your own, but if you can do it, good for you. good luck!|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Not at all. There's no retirement age in acting.<br>  <br>  Keep up the classes; try to branch out into areas like voice, singing, dancing, etc to give a well-rounded C.V. Audition for and act in student productions, no-budget, non-union, etc to build experience. <br>  <br>  Also, the advantage of this is that in the future the director you worked for for free (or meals and transport) may have made a name for him/herself, and hire you on a paid gig.<br>  <br>  Good luck; break a leg.|`|Y69Pebuuaa	Um, Natalie, did it ever occur to you that the asker doesn't live in the US and lives in a country where the educational system is DIFFERENT than the one in the USA? Maybe the asker lives in Britain where people finish high school when they're 16 and finish college when they're 18? *eyes*<br>  <br>  And no, 18 is now where near too late to start an acting career. In fact, that's probably the best time to start considering that a lot of agents stop taking on clients once they're 13 and then start again at 18 - this is usually because there's so little work for teens.<br>  <br>  Plus there are plenty of people who didn't start acting until they were a lot older than 18 - if you look at the resumes at a lot of big actors today, most of them didn't start acting until they were in their early twenties.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XQ7Ihe4taa	well if you did acting lessons, then audition for community or school plays. That way you'll get your name out there. And if some scout comes around to see your play(s), if he's interested, he'll talk to you or your director. And you could get a scholarship for acting too. Or if you want to go right into showbiz move to NYC. And IF you think you're REALLY great then move to LA. ( I say this because there are so many aspiring actors in LA that you're chances are slim to none. where in new york there are more people who want to get on broadway and less actors)|`|MEoBEv82aa	Just so you know, you finish high school at 18. College is usually 22.
31GXcmBiaa	The film does a good job at showing the viciousness of the attack.  Of course, the love story is a stupid way of getting other people to watch the film.  The idea that we had pilots that shot down enemy planes is based in fact.  The ending of the movie is also based on true events.  The Doolittle raid was successful in bombing Tokyo as retaliation for Pearl Harbor.  There are not many differences except the love story was ridiculous and some very minor anacronisms were thrown in.  I also think that Jon Voight was a terrible FDR.|`|AA12095483	Sorry, i haven't seen the Hollywood video but what happened basically was the Japanese intended to bomb Pearl Harbor, information was picked up prior to the event and ignored by US intelligence services with the result that the attack came as a complete surprise. That was a huge tactical advantage for the Japanese, because if the US had acknowledged the information and acted on it, they could have had fighters in the air to 'greet' the Japanese when the bomber fleet arrived.|`|xfqHi1tRaa	Yeah -- the Hollywood one is mostly fiction with a few facts tossed in for fun! Try reading "At Dawn They Slept" and then watching the movie.
RufGmQYLaa	Since you dance, aim to start in the back of a chorus of a large musical where you can barely be noticed. No lines, just singing and dancing. Dance well, and if you have to mouth the words due to fright, then you can. In a large musical, it would be hard to tell. Don't aim for anything with lines until you get over the singing part. Even then go for chorus parts with group lines only. Then gauge when you think you can move up. Obviously stay in the realm of schools and community theatres where everyone is supportive and willing to help folks have the chance to stretch themselves and try new things.|`|8PAfsI7Iaa	One way to get rid of stage fright is to practice speaking infront of ppls!|`|MEoBEv82aa	It's good to be a little nervous when performing, because you push yourself to do your best. But when you get so scared that you freeze up, then it becomes a problem.<br>  <br>  First try to find out what causes your stage fright. Some people (like me) get nervous when performing for people that they know. They don't have a problem with that in front of perfect strangers, because they know they'll probably never see them again. Others are better with people they know, and feel uncomfortable with strangers. Still others are just scared of everyone!<br>  <br>  I don't really know if this will help, but I either try to ignore the audience, or find one person in the audience and talk to just that one person and ignore everyone else. Different methods work in different situations.

There is also this amazing series written from darcys point of view that you should read AFTER the real book it will make it more real--Its a trilogy I don't remember what its called but the first book is "An Assembly Such as This"  and then "Duty and Desire" and I can't remember the last one sorry but thetre written by a woman. I love your taste in literature and movies!!! I totally agree the new pride and prejudice wasnt that good. Colin Firth will steal your heart, especially after reading the trilogy. :)|`|a62dc833424adf991f811cd067950e93aa	I am NOT a Jane Austen fan. Far too tedious for my taste.

MHphepQPaa	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Excuse me my English. <br>  <br>  England did not get involved in this war.<br>   <br>  Some religious events in Germany, but were resolved with the signing of the Peace of Augsburg, on 25 September 1555, which inaugurated a period in which the prince could impose their belief patterns of its fields. Kept up the balance as the predominant religion restricted to the traditional religions that were the Catholic and Lutheran. <br>  But from the moment when the advent of Calvinism begins to expand, things get complicated. The new line has won several religious sovereign. However, the Jesuits and the Counter-Reformation Roman Catholicism that helped to recover their strength. Thus was born the expansionist project of Hapsburgs, who had the leadership Fernando, Duke of Styria, which had as Jesuit educators. <br>  <br>  The danger threatens both the neighboring France, as the Protestant powers in the north. During the course of the conflict, the fight would be influenced by other collateral issues, such as the stubbornness of some European leaders. This situation triggered off in the second half of the sixteenth century by the weaknesses of the Treaty of Augsburg, an agreement finalized in 1555 between the Holy Empire and the Catholic Lutheran Germany. <br>  <br>  In the years following s religious tensions were getting worse, with this results in a series of battles, and the main Battle of Pilsen (1618), Battle of Záblatí (1619), Battle of Vestonice (1619), Battle of White Mountain (1620 ), Battle of Wiesloch (1622), Battle of Wimpfen (1622), Battle of H?chst (1622), Battle of Fleurus (1622), Battle of Stadtlohn (1623), Battle of Dessau Bridge (1626), Battle of Lutter am Barenberge (1626), Battle of Stralsund (1628), Battle of Wolgast (1628), Battle of Frankfurt on the Oder (1631), Battle of Magdeburg (1631), Battle of Werben (1631), Battle of Breitenfeld (1631), Battle of Rain (1632), Battle of Fürth (1632), Battle of Lützen (1632), Battle of Oldendorf (1633), Battle of N?rdlingen (1634), Battle of Wittstock (1636), Battle of Rheinfelden (1638), Battle of Breisach (1638), Battle of Chemnitz (1639), Second Battle of Breitenfeld (1642), Battle of Rocroi (1643), Battle of Tuttlingen (1643), Battle of Freiburg (1644), Battle of Jüterbog AI (1644), Battle of Jankau (1645), Battle of Mergentheim (1645), Second Battle of N?rdlingen (1645), Battle of Zusmarshausen (1648), Battle of Pragua (1648), Battle of Lens (1648), Battle of Arras (1654), Battle of Valenciennes (1656), Battle of the Dunes (1658). <br>  <br>  End of War - For three years the Peace of Westphalia was negotiated by representatives Catholics and Protestants met in Münster (Catholic) and Osnabrück (Protestants). The treaties concluded in these two city Westláfia were gathered in the General Act of Westphalia in Muster in October 1648. The ratification of the clauses of the Treaty of Augsburg, was the signature of peace. <br>  So that the religious map of Europe would nationalize, since the possible conversion of the sovereign would not mundan?as faith in their respective fields. Besides having been changed the balance of power in Europe, certain boundaries were also redefined. The diplomacy and the French armies forced the Hapsburgs to focus on Austrian territories and to expand into the Turkish Empire in the East. <br>  <br>  France as the arbiter of international balance, the territorial gains achieved some: took possession of all, took Spain to the Roussillon Lorraine and Alsace, and almost gained the recognition of the diocese of Metz, Toul and Verdun (the "Three bishops" ). However, the Franco-Spanish War continued until the Treaty of the Pyrenees, in 1659.

3lmj4bnUaa	try making a dance or song with the lines and just keep practicin, maybe ask people to rehearse with you|`|N8zJERG5aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  A great way of memorising lines is to record yourself then play it back listening to it. If you listen to it with your headphones just before going to bed, your subconscious will absorb it & it will aid in better memory recognition.  Also, when reading try & associate a word with each line so disect the script with your lines. It'll be like a trigger & help you remember what the line is.  Eg. If the line's about an argument between people - remember the word 'argument' & you'll be able to recall it easier.  Another good way is to write your lines as you start memorising them bit by bit as writing them down will help you in remembering them too rather than just reading them - say it out loud when you're remembering as you write it.  Using visual, audio & verbal techniques will help you out more out rather than just reading.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	By osmosis.<br>  <br>  I wish....<br>  <br>  Reading it by rote is a bore. Try tying in actions (blocking movements), thoughts, feelings, minor use of props, etc. until the lines become a part of you.|`|MEoBEv82aa	PRACTICE! Have someone listen to you read and give you tips, devote maybe half an hour a day to just reading you lines (out loud!!!).<br>  <br>  Also, what I did, and it worked, make a recording of yourself reading your lines, then play it constantly, whenever you can.

(I still like them, but it's not the same as it used to be...)<br>  <br>  I think that Stephenie Meyer is an amazing author, and she was very descriptive about all of the people and events. The books have a very creative idea that hasn't been experimented with much before. By this I mean that when people think of vampires, they generally think of coffins, garlic, and sucking blood (not sparkly, fast, strong, and somewhat nice). Stephenie was creative and imaginative, and created this beautiful love story from nothing more than a dream that she had one night. <br>  <br>  The people who dislike Twilight probably didn't read it until after the movie came out and they're more sick of the obsessions than the book.|`|igdMFqW7aa	It actually was a very good series, but it's gotten so popular now it's stupid...

Othello, overwhelmed by grief, decides to end his life rather than live without Desdemona.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Othello|`|ceBTTCPwaa	Othello, the Moor of Venice is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in approximately 1603, and based on the Italian short story "Un Capitano Moro" (A Moorish Captain) by Cinthio (a disciple of Boccaccio) first published in 1565. The work revolves around four central characters: Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army; his wife Desdemona; his lieutenant, Cassio; and his trusted ensign Iago. Because of its varied themes — racism, love, jealousy and betrayal — Othello remains relevant to the present day and is often performed in professional and community theatres alike.

amcqJkWhaa	Hello, I am in no way a manga artist, yet I would like to offer my thoughts here. <br>  You can start right now to amass an audience for your work, and it doesn't require any hiring or portfolios. You can make your very own webcomic, and update it daily-- there are many ways to update daily... short comic episodes once or twice per week, or like 2 polished pages once a week, as part of a whole chapter thing, sequential. Do what is best for you. <br>  Advantages of making your own webcomic, are getting an audience and following, like I've said. You'd no longer be an entire newb, and you can have something to write down on napkins to people. You can immediately interact with a community, of internet people, and see how fans respond. If you can get any fans at all, will be valuable to people who have the means of publishing your story, who already have a reputation as publishers... should they come into contact with your story. <br>  There are plenty of sites that will be a good place to host your comic, although not being a comic artist I can't really give you recommendations. Or you could create your own site, from one of the free server people... freewebs, googlepages, like that. blogger.com, perhaps. <br>  <a href="http://wirepop.com/" rel="nofollow">http://wirepop.com/</a> is actually a place where you submit your comic, and people can pay to read chapters after a certain amount of preview/sampler chapters. Try that. I think the author of lovely manga Dramacon debuted here...? Svetlania Chmakova. See, not Japanese, but people love her stuff. I do. <br>  Check out <a href="http://www.netcomics.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.netcomics.com/</a>   <a href="http://zudacomics.com/" rel="nofollow">http://zudacomics.com/</a>  <a href="http://drunkduck.com/" rel="nofollow">http://drunkduck.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://thedreamercomic.com/" rel="nofollow">http://thedreamercomic.com/</a> is a comic that I really adore, that originated, started, as webcomic. I think format is good example of what you could do should you make your own site (free or paid for).<br>  (Oh yeah, if you look at the journal entry there, a recent one, March 5 09, titled, "To You Independent Creators & Happy Massacre Day!", well, read that. It just so happens, coincidentally, the author links to a great article and talks to to Independant comic book creators out there... yay!)<br>  <br>  But some things publishers look for, I've heard, is if you can meet deadlines, consistently turn out quality work, and I guess a webcomic you maintain nicely will put you in good impressions. <br>  Also check out Rising Stars of Manga competition. No doubt you've heard of Tokyopop-- they sponsor it, i think. People from different countries submit a short story, under any genre, no holds barred, and the top ten people get their stories published in paperback volume, each year... these winners get to pitch their ideas to Tokyopop, and some have even gone to make contracts with them through this competition. You can borrow some copies from your library, to see the entries, and also the judges critiques. But, even if you don't win, if your story was memorable, the judges like it, you'll be kept on tab, on file, and sooner or later, may get approached... <br>  <br>  Yet, there are even stories of those who were found, and approached by houses like Tokyopop... such as Svetlania Chmakova. <br>  <br>  No one can really say how likely it is for you, because your future is in your hands. Even should chances seem slim, even if you have worked a lot, things are ever changing. Keep positive, and light-hearted, and cheery.. things will come around for you. Believe in yourself, even if no one else seems to... because you're worth it. The potential is inside you.|`|DFXyD8riaa	Not bloody likely!|`|ygcbrp5Uaa	Well.... If you're going to go to Japan, then it'll be REALLY hard to get employed by anyone who will take a foreigner seriously. <br>  <br>  My advise is to start your own thing and publish it. If it takes off, do more and start thinking about getting your work translated into different languages so you can market to different countries. If it takes off there, then you'll have one hell of a foot in the door. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind though, that individual success only ups your chances at getting hired with a foreign company, but it does not in any way guarantee you the position. Besides, if you do your own thing, you can cut out all of the middle people and if you get really good, you could even start your own company to compete with the foreign market.<br>  <br>  It's a very discouraging field to get into, but don't give up. If it's something you really want to do, and feel passionately about, then find a way to do it. <br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to create your own Manga, and publish it. You'll never know until then...|`|d2GQQ02naa	With spelling like that, not anytime soon hun.

Bx6xTLRbaa	Sorry but I don't think most colleges offer any hip hop classes. Colleges focus on the more classical side of dance (ballet, modern, jazz). Look for studios in your area and sign up for as many classes as possible! Stretch, practice, and never give up! You need to take class, most people won't give you credit for teaching yourself how to dance at home (although you should still continue that). Maybe one day you can move out to L.A. and become the next big dancer! Good luck!! :)|`|ccnoxnzYaa	Yes, there are lots of colleges and universities that offer dance as a major. Start by taking tons of classes at your studio. Ballet is an absolute must, for any dancer, even hip hop. Every genre of dance is originally based off ballet and you learn a lot of terminology that is used in modern, jazz, lyrical, musical theater, etc. Good luck!
ceBTTCPwaa	Of Mice and Men is a novella written by Nobel Prize-winning author John Steinbeck. Published in 1937, it tells the tragic story of George Milton and Lennie Small, two displaced migrant ranch workers during the Great Depression in California.<br>  <br>  Based on Steinbeck's own experiences as a bindle stiff in the 1920s (before the arrival of the Okies he would vividly describe in The Grapes of Wrath), the title is taken from Robert Burns's poem, To a Mouse, which is often quoted as: "The best-laid plans of mice and men/often go awry," though the phrase in the original Scots of the poem is "The best laid schemes o' mice an' men/Gang aft agley."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/j..." rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/j...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Of_Mice_and_Men" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Of_Mice_and_Men</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/omam/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/omam/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/micemen/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/micemen/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/ofmiceandmen/i..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/ofmiceandmen/i...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/mice2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/mice2.html</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	George and Lennie spend the night by the Salinas River in northern California.

f3jZAL1naa	Meyer is a terrible writer because she uses way too many words that are just obviously not used in her everyday vocabulary. It's quite obvious that she had a thesaurus at hand every waking moment while she was writing the Twilight series. She also goes to great lengths to describe the most irrelevant things in multiple paragraphs. I remember reading 4 pages about the standing positions of 30 or so Vampires (it was the bad guys) and I swear I almost got a headache. It's as if she thinks her readers are mentally challenged. Good authors know that the people who read their stories have a brain, an imagination and they can figure things out for themselves. <br>  <br>  Her characters are poorly developed throughout the stories. It was as if everyone else was a puny backdrop for Bella and Edward's pathetic "romance" which, btw was not an actual romance. It was completely based on a sick infatuation. Bella was obsessed with Edward's perfect body (if you could get anymore shallow) and Edward was obsessed with Bella because she smelled good and he couldn't read her mind! If girls my age honestly think this is romance then they have to open their eyes good and wide.|`|YDtSz60oaa	I tend to look past the writing and just enjoy the story, but I can easily see why many people dislike it. Your comment about it being good enough for fictionpress is spot on. Its pure wish fulfilment really. Average girl meets handsome mysterious guy, they get together. He save her from a few bad guys, they get married, have a child, overcome all the obstacles and live happily ever after. A bit too predictable really.<br>  <br>  I think a lot of people have problems with it because of how it portrays vampires, very different from what we're used too. Others just dont like how selfish bella becomes.<br>  <br>  As for the writing, the only thing I can think of at the moment is that it's a bit overly descriptive.<br>  <br>  Interesting question though.|`|fpuHVNYgaa	It is a very poor written novel with nothing but flaws and pot holes.It send a very bad message to young readers that it's OK to be with a controlling abusive stalker who is also a pedophile.To have no goals in life,and to be totally dependent on a guy.The book is the worst novel ever written and should be recognized for what it is.|`|NmfEaN3Uaa	I'll start off by saying that I am a 20 year old guy....and that I liked these books. Were they the best books ever...not even close, where they book of the decade...also not even close. But nonetheless they were pretty neat and I enjoyed them.<br>  <br>  You never bothered to ssay exactly why YOU don't like the book if its different from most peoples reasons...?<br>  <br>  I don't think its the best simply because I thought other books were better. However I do believe that Twilight was a good book. People complain about the writing because its juvenile. Its wrote in a very simple, almost childish manner and it bothers "high society intellect types" and those who really want to be. People try to compare Twilight which is a Popular Fiction book with Literature Fiction. Thats like comparing apples and lemons. Popular fiction is SUPPOSED to be written in a very elementary style so that it can be enjoyed by everybody. The writing is supposed to be relaxing and plays with your emotions not your intellect. Popular Fiction is just for the fun of it! Thats all its supposed to do...its not supposed to be deep or thought provoking or have serious thoughts. Also, Popular Fiction can get away with cleshays because as I said...its not supposed to be intelligent books. Just FUN.<br>  <br>  Also I've found many people who dislike the book knew they would dislike it before they even read it. Because they didn't wanna seem like "conformists" or fan girls. Also, the book simply isn't for everybody. Everyone has their own tastes in books.... The reason Twilight got such popularity is because it was a cool story with a unique twist on vampire lore, typical romance, and most importantly it was born into the post-Harry Potter world.

MHphepQPaa	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Excuse me my English <br>  <br>  THE ROMAN FORUM <br>  <br>  The Roman Forum was the central area around which ancient Rome developed, in which commerce, business, prostitution, cult and the administration of justice took place. Here the communal hearth was located. Originally it had been marshy ground, which was drained by the Tarquins with the Cloaca Maxima. Its final travertine paving, still to be seen, dates from the reign of Augustus. An anonymous 8th century traveler from Einsiedeln (now in Germany) reported that the Forum was already falling apart during in his time. During the Middle Ages, though the memory of the Forum Romanum persisted, its monuments were for the most part buried under debris, and its location was designated the "Campo Vaccino" or "cattle field". The return of Pope Urban V from Avignon in 1367 led to an increased interest in ancient monuments, partly for their moral lesson and partly as a quarry for new buildings being undertaken in Rome after a long lapse. Artists from the late 15th century drew the ruins in the Forum, antiquaries copied inscriptions from the 16th century, and a tentative excavation was begun in the late 18th century. A cardinal took measures to drain it again and built the Alessandrine neighborhood over it. But the excavation by Carlo Fea, who began clearing the debris from the Arch of Septimius Severus in 1803, and archaeologists under the Napoleonic regime marked the beginning of clearing the Forum, which was only fully excavated in the early 20th century. In its current state, remains from several centuries are shown together, due to the Roman practice of building over earlier ruins.<br>  <br>  THE VIA SACRA is the main and widest street in the Forum, connecting some of the most important religious sites in the Forum Romanum, stretching from the top of the Capitoline Hill to the Colosseum. This road was continually filled with solemn religious festivals, magnificent triumphs of victorious generals, and the daily throng assembling in the Basilicas to chat, throw dice, engage in business, or secure justice.<br>  <br>  The white marble ARCH OF SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS is a triumphal arch erected in 204 AD to commemorate the Parthian victories of the Emperor and his two sons Caracalla and Geta in the two campaigns against the Parthians, of 195 and 203. So much debris and silt eroded from the surrounding hills that the arch was embedded to the base of the columns. The arch was raised on a travertine base originally approached by steps from the Forum's ancient level. By the 4th century, erosion had raised the level of the Forum so much that a roadway was put through the Arch for the first time. During the Middle Ages, repeated flooding of the low-lying Forum washed in so much additional sediment and debris that when Canaletto painted it in 1742, only the upper half of the Arch showed above ground. The well-preserved condition of the arch owes a good deal to its having been incorporated into the structure of a Christian church. When the church was refounded elsewhere, the arch remained ecclesiastical property and was not demolished for other construction, a practice that spoiled so many ancient monuments of their original columnades, marble pieces and facade adornments.

It also gives far to much description about the character and not about the surroundings or actions.

It had eloquence in its style and pulled me in deeper making me want to know what was going to happen. Setting up conflict in the first paragraph always captures the readers interest.<br>  <br>  paragraph 3: 4 This seemed to have the traits of both of the other paragraphs. Unfortunately this means the bad ones as well. The story didn't seem to flow well though. There where unnecessary sentences "There was silence" in particular stands out as not having to be stated twice as it is implied in the sentence before hand and the sentence after seems to contradict it.|`|Ny1eiWJraa	Paragraph 1: 7<br>  I personally like description, but it needs a better job of holding attention.

It sounds like a good story plot, and it makes you want to find out more, read more, to find out what's going on in the story.<br>  <br>  Paragraph 3: 5<br>  I don't know why, I just don't feel like this is the most interesting story line from what I read.

9233401496ab10d52d1644174696a803aa	The Great Leap Forward took place in 1958. The Great Leap Forward was Mao’s attempt to modernise China’s economy so that by 1988, China would have an economy that rivalled America. Mao had toured China and concluded that the Chinese people were capable of anything and the two primary tasks that he felt they should target was industry and agriculture. Mao announced a second Five Year Plan to last from 1958 to 1963. This plan was called the Great Leap Forward.<br>  <br>  The Great Leap Forward planned to develop agriculture and industry. Mao believed that both had to grow to allow the other to grow. Industry could only prosper if the work force was well fed, while the agricultural workers needed industry to produce the modern tools needed for modernisation. To allow for this, China was reformed into a series of communes.<br>  <br>  The geographical size of a commune varied but most contained about 5000 families. People in a commune gave up their ownership of tools, animals etc so that everything was owned by the commune. People now worked for the commune and not for themselves. The life of an individual was controlled by the commune. Schools and nurseries were provided by the communes so that all adults could work. Health care was provided and the elderly were moved into "houses of happiness" so that they could be looked after and also so that families could work and not have to worry about leaving their elderly relatives at home.<br>  <br>  The commune provided all that was needed – including entertainment. Soldiers worked alongside people. The population in a commune was sub-divided. Twelve families formed a work team. Twelve work terms formed a brigade. Each sub-division was given specific work to do. Party members oversaw the work of a commune to ensure that decisions followed the correct party line.<br>  <br>  By the end of 1958, 700 million people had been placed into 26,578 communes. The speed with which this was achieved was astounding. However, the government did all that it could to whip up enthusiasm for the communes. Propaganda was everywhere – including in the fields where the workers could listen to political speeches as they worked as the communes provided public address systems. Everybody involved in communes was urged not only to meet set targets but to beat them. If the communes lacked machinery, the workers used their bare hands. Major constructions were built in record time – though the quality of some was dubious.<br>  <br>  The Great Leap Forward also encouraged communes to set up "back-yard" production plants. The most famous were 600,000backyard furnaces which produced steel for the communes. When all of these furnaces were working, they added a considerable amount of steel to China’s annual total – 11 million tonnes.<br>  <br>  The figures for steel, coal, chemicals, timber, cement etc all showed huge rises though the figures started at in 1958 were low. Grain and cotton production also showed major increases in production.<br>  <br>  Mao had introduced the Great Leap Forward with the phrase "it is possible to accomplish any task whatsoever." By the end of 1958, it seemed as if his claim was true.<br>  <br>  The consequences of the Great Leap Forward<br>  <br>  However, in 1959, things started to go wrong. Political decisions/beliefs took precedence over commonsense and communes faced the task of doing things which they were incapable of achieving. Party officials would order the impossible and commune leaders, who knew what their commune was capable of doing or not, could be charged with being a "bourgeois reactionary" if he complained. Such a charge would lead to prison.<br>  <br>  Quickly produced farm machinery produced in factories fell to pieces when used. Many thousands of workers were injured after working long hours and falling asleep at their jobs. Steel produced by the backyard furnaces was frequently too weak to be of any use and could not be used in construction – it’s original purpose. Buildings constructed by this substandard steel did not last long.<br>  <br>  Also the backyard production method had taken many workers away from their fields – so desperately needed food was not being harvested. Ironically, one of the key factors in food production in China was the weather and 1958 had particularly good weather for growing food. Party leaders claimed that the harvest for 1958 was a record 260 million tons – which was not true.<br>  <br>  The excellent growing weather of 1958 was followed by a very poor growing year in 1959. Some parts of China were hit by floods. In other growing areas, drought was a major problem. The harvest for 1959 was 170 million tons of grain – well below what China needed at the most basic level. In parts of China, starvation occurred.<br>  <br>  1960 had even worse weather than 1959. The harvest of 1960 was 144 million tons. 9 million people are thought to have starved to death in 1960 alone; many millions were left desperately ill as a result of a lack of food. The government had to introduce rationing. This put people on the most minimal of food

xG5ZlJDqaa	You never get awesome results from self-portraits. But here are some tips.<br>  - always hold the camera as far as possible outstreched on your arms and zoom a little. Pressing the camera lens right up your face would not give you great results<br>  - The best ranges for portraits is to use a settings of 3x zoom on your point-and-shoot. You need a tripod though<br>  - As a followup to the previous tip, you can't hold the camera anymore, instead use the self timer. It will be really difficult the frame the picture exactly you would like though.<br>  - Mirror shots are great because you can preview what the final picture is gonna look like, and not just pointing the camera blindly at yourself<br>  - I find pictures that look DOWN on the subject look better than those looking up<br>  - but if you want to achieve a more dramatic,powerful look, shooting up a subjects face can be useful<br>  - If your camera has good macro capability, then try taking closeups of your eye. If you have a table lamp, point it at a angle so that your eye would be adequeately lit.<br>  <br>  Here is what professional portraits should look like: <a href="http://images.google.com/images?gbv=2&hl=en&q=studio+portraits" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?gbv=2&hl...</a>|`|776cf4cc9dc31fae3b35bd08e9ead34eaa	Put on some freakin pants.

Take several pictures and then look through them. See if they are too close, too far, cutting your head off, etc., and then try to fix the various issues. Take some more pictures, and see what needs to be fixed, or what worked really well.|`|EJNI4BWgaa	when your done taking your photos send me them <br>  <br>  Shadowforceabd@yahoo.com

After the death of King Hamlet, the King's brother Claudius hastily marries King Hamlet's widow (and Prince Hamlet's mother) Gertrude. In the background is Denmark's long-standing feud with neighbouring Norway, and an invasion, led by the Norwegian prince Fortinbras, is expected.<br>  <br>  The play opens on a cold night at Elsinore, the Danish royal castle. Francisco, a sentinel, is relieved of his watch by Bernardo, another sentinel, and exits while Bernardo remains. A third sentinel, Marcellus, enters with Horatio, the best friend of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark. The sentinels try to persuade Horatio that they have seen King Hamlet's ghost, when it appears again. After hearing from Horatio of the Ghost's appearance, Hamlet resolves to see the Ghost himself. That night, the Ghost appears to Hamlet. He tells Hamlet that he is the spirit of his father and discloses that Claudius murdered King Hamlet by pouring poison in his ears. The Ghost demands that Hamlet avenge him; Hamlet agrees and decides to fake madness to avert suspicion. He is, however, uncertain of the Ghost's reliability.<br>  <br>  Busy with affairs of state, Claudius and Gertrude try to avert an invasion by Prince Fortinbras of Norway. Perturbed by Hamlet's continuing deep mourning for his father and his increasingly erratic behaviour, they send two student friends of his—Rosencrantz and Guildenstern—to discover the cause of Hamlet's changed behaviour. Hamlet greets his friends warmly but quickly discerns that they have been sent to spy on him.<br>  <br>  Polonius is Claudius's trusted chief counsellor; his son, Laertes, is returning to France, and his daughter, Ophelia, is courted by Hamlet. Neither Polonius nor Laertes thinks Hamlet is serious about Ophelia, and they both warn her off. Shortly afterwards, Ophelia is alarmed by Hamlet's strange behaviour and reports to her father that Hamlet rushed into her room but stared at her and said nothing. Polonius assumes that the "ecstasy of love"[7] is responsible for Hamlet's madness, and he informs Claudius and Gertrude. Together, Claudius and Polonius set up Ophelia to spy on him. When she returns his letters and he silently guesses what is going on, he furiously rants at her, and insists she go "to a nunnery" (a slang term at the time for a brothel).<br>  The "gravedigger scene"[8] (Artist: Eugène Delacroix 1839)<br>  <br>  Hamlet remains unconvinced that the Ghost has told him the truth, but the arrival of a troupe of actors at Elsinore presents him with a solution. He will stage a play, re-enacting his father's murder, and determine Claudius's guilt or innocence by studying his reaction. The court assembles to watch the play; Hamlet provides a running commentary throughout. The other important event in this scene is the arrival of the players. The presence of players and play-acting within the play points to an important theme: that real life is in certain ways like play-acting. When the murder scene is presented, Claudius abruptly rises and leaves the room, which Hamlet sees as proof of his uncle's guilt. Claudius, fearing for his life, banishes Hamlet to England on a pretext, closely watched by Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Alone, Claudius discloses to the audience that he is sending Hamlet to his death.<br>  <br>  Gertrude summons Hamlet to her closet to demand an explanation. On his way, Hamlet passes Claudius in prayer but hesitates to kill him, reasoning that death in prayer would send him to heaven. In the bedchamber, an argument erupts between Hamlet and Gertrude. Polonius, spying hidden behind an arras, makes a noise; and Hamlet, believing it is Claudius, stabs wildly, killing Polonius. The Ghost appears, urging Hamlet to treat Gertrude gently but reminding him to kill Claudius. Unable to see or hear the Ghost herself, Gertrude takes Hamlet's conversation with it as further evidence of madness. Prior to embarking for England, Hamlet hides Polonius's body, ultimately revealing its location to the King and Gertrude.<br>  <br>  Demented by grief at Polonius's death, Ophelia wanders Elsinore singing bawdy songs. Her brother, Laertes, arrives back from France, enraged by his father's death and his sister's madness. She comes onstage briefly to give out herbs and flowers. Claudius convinces Laertes that Hamlet is solely responsible; then news arrives that Hamlet is still at large—his ship was attacked by pirates on the way to England, and he has returned to Denmark. Claudius swiftly concocts a plot. He proposes a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet in which Laertes will fight with a poison-tipped sword, but tacitly plans to offer Hamlet poisoned wine if that fails. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has drowned.<br>  <br>  We next see two gravediggers discuss Ophelia's apparent suicide, while digging her grave. Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with a gravedigger, who unearths the skull of a jester from Hamlet's childhood, Yorick. Ophel|`|EpGJbHhEaa	Have you read the play yet?

Brightly Burning, Take a Thief, Exile's Honor & Exile's Valor, and Foundation (1st of a new trilogy) are prequels to the original series.  For the most part, the order of these in a 1st read don't matter so much, except for the Exile books--read Honor, then Valor.<br>  <br>  Chronologically, the books run in this order:<br>  Mage Wars<br>  Last Herald-Mage<br>  Foundation (I think; it might be reversed with Brightly Burning)<br>  Brightly Burning<br>  Vows & Honor<br>  Exile's Honor<br>  Exile's Valor<br>  Take a Thief<br>  Arrows Trilogy<br>  By the Sword (actually covers a wide expanse of time, but the end comes after Arrow's Fall)<br>  Mage Winds<br>  Mage Storms<br>  Darien's Tale

cxDbdhELaa	So many philosophers, yet so few who're actually PHILOSOPHICAL! Becoming philosophical requires contact with the third rail. Endure the pain and grow stronger.<br>  <br>  The problem with most (especially those who've received formal education in philosophy) is that they care not for the pain which is required to actually become philosophical. They feel as though having merely breathed one scent of the rarefied air qualifies them to look down upon others from on high. What's hilarious is that for most of them, it's flipping burgers at a fast food joint!<br>  <br>  Yes, you can become trapped within the maze of philosophy. But the ultimate liberation comes from achieving the PHILOSOPHICAL existence.|`|GTu7pzFYaa	I feel like so many people are.<br>  It just seems like a waste to come up with theories about things you'll never really know.

If you are talking about getting so involved in it, that it consumes you, then sure, why not? I think that everyone is already trapped in philosophy if you consider philosophy a belief system.

WxWiP3QJaa	Certain books have been on school curriculum or reading lists for years, but there has never, not that I am aware of, a list of required reading for ALL schools at specific ages. It is up to the individual school and teachers to set the texts they want to teach, even more so within the wide and varied state/public systems of education we have had over the last 50 odd years. There is usually a requirement for some Shakespeare, but outside of "some", whether that be a play or sonnet or whatever there is no further requirement. That said, though, I suspect this is usually a "governor" requirement rather than a legal requirement.<br>  <br>  So, as for 1984, absolutely not... Animal Farm would be higher up the list, imho anyway, as an Orwell book as it is both far more accessible to the age range and also has the cross-subject focus, what with the allegory and all.<br>  <br>  The flexibility is there to enable the school to have some decision in the curriculum, for example: down here in the south/south west we read a fair bit of Thomas Hardy... which we could then incorporate into the landscape around us, school trips etc. <br>  <br>  I would also have to say, and not sure it is still the case, as we were often one of the pilots for the GCSE when it started... but after 14/15 or so, we were basically reading our own books and having to relate them to the central themes. There were some texts we read as the class, but more often than not, these were short stories or poems to lead us onto our own reading.<br>  <br>  This is not to say that 1984 is no longer used in schools, more that I dont think it was ever used in all schools and may still be used in others. There are much better books for whatever purpose, imho.<br>  <br>  <br>  Floppity: if it wasnt for Labour governments, there wouldnt be ANY books in schools, and probably no schools to put them in anyway.|`|MKKfCRjAaa	yep i did 1984 at school.  back in good 'ole 1995.  Yessiree times change.|`|1f1723a276a7a216646a15bc2761f1b8aa	hi Harry.<br>  Just because a book was in school, doesn't mean the kids read it!<br>  It is a grim book as harsh as life in Airstrip 1, lots of people give up on it very quickly.<br>  "Ulysses" i absolutely hate, when i finished it i took it outside and threw it away, swearing never to touch it again.<br>  "War and Peace" however, when i came to reread it, is wonderful! Give it another go, it doesn't need Oxbridge or any such thing. Same turned out to be true of "Vanity Fair", "Middlemarch" etc. I just wasn't mature enough to appreciate them fully at the time.<br>  cheers, Steve.|`|x647LeB2aa	I did 'O' Level English and 'A' Level English Literature.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty hazy on what we read but the ones I remember are:  Measure for Measure, Romeo and Juliet, A Winters Tale, I'm the King of the Castle (Susan Cooper) Animal Farm and Wilfred Owen.  There was also The Rainbow and Lord of the Flies.<br>  <br>  There must have been others but 1986 was a long time ago!<br>  <br>  Of these the only ones I have read again are Orwell and Golding.<br>  <br>  Classics have gone out of the window now.  I prefer Pratchett ;)<br>  <br>  I know my 15 year old neice is reading a book called Journey's End as part of her GSCE's but I'm not familiar with it.|`|AA11569882	It isn't in schools anymore - this is a labour government, we won't be having books like 1984!<br>  <br>  I always thought I was pretty good with my book list, but I started 1984 a few years ago and just didn't get past the first few chapters.  I think I'll try it again soon.  And I've never heard of the first four you mention, and War and Peace and Ulysses I haven't even attempted!<br>  <br>  For my GCSEs (only four or five years ago) we studied 'The Inspector Calls', 'Of Mice and Men' and extracts of 'Great Expectations' but we didn't actually read the whole book - and this was a grammar school - talk about dumbing down of education!|`|AA11966816	At one time it was on the curriculum for many schools but not recently.I also remember reading it at school but never since.I never lie about books I`ve read ,except to say I haven`t read a book sometimes (but this is often out of embarassment LOL).I read so many different genres of book but never claim to have read something if I haven`t.
tcxB5lteaa	Too scary? Mary Higgins Clark is never "scary" in the way that Stephen King can be with his horror novels.  She can just be darn suspenseful.  <br>  <br>  My favorites by her: All Around the Town; No Place Like Home; Where Are You Now?; A Stranger is Watching.<br>  <br>  Of course, any book by her has been entertaining.  And Just Take My Heart will be released by Mary April 7.  So that's exciting.
PS0oSoXFaa	Her psychology is rooted in her childhood! If you skip the beginning part, you'll miss this... and it's what makes the book so good. Charlotte Bronte was a great explorer of the mind and human behavior, this is why she's a "great" author!!!<br>  <br>  But if you just want the love story, sure, skip to Thornfield. But you can find love stories everywhere; good ones, that's another matter...|`|suBed6S0aa	If you skip until the part where she goes to Rochester's house, you will probably be missing about half of the book. The miniseries cut out a lot of the beginning, which is important to Jane's development as a character.

I know there are books that are better written, or more creative (maybe), and everything else you could think of- as Harry Potter isn't the best book.  But, as I grew up with it, and it IS the book that got me into reading (and out of the stupid habit of watching T.V.), it is, by far, the most incredible book I've read thus far.<br>  <br>  :)  And I'm proud of that.|`|RrtUV5wcaa	harry potter and the deathly hallows by j.k rowling|`|D8sN8gNFaa	Naked Lunch|`|sLiVlw39aa	I can't say that it is best one, but it is latest one I read.

I am on the wrong side of the wealth divide.  It is amazing how much wealth is out there!

DZGAxPjDaa	I did not actually feel like reading the whole thing, but I read the summary and the first few sentances. It sounds good!

Thats my name but i spell it like: Katerina|`|NZmvHYY9aa	I like the idea and the writing, but you use a few superfluous adjectives (haha). It's kind of a waste of time to describe how black the night is in several paragraphs when you can do it in a sentence or two--that is, unless it's a super-important part of the story.<br>  <br>  Try not to think of the sophisticated authors you read and see on TV--write your story, worry about words later. <br>  <br>  Keep writing!!!|`|Al2BE64paa	i didnt read it all but the description sounds really good.  it can pull u in.  its just not my type of genre. i prefer romance. but good luck. sounds good|`|vMjbeQyFaa	I read the first chapter.  It was pretty good.  It's not the type of story I typically read.  The only constructive criticism I can offer is try to remember as you write, you know what you're going to say, the reader doesn't  You have to spell it out for us.  As you write something, imagine someone not familiar with your thoughts reading over your shoulder asking questions.  <br>  <br>  For example: the line that starts "While trying to clutch.." add Will's name; for the line "I will not leave here without you" could be 'I will not leave you here alone.'  Explain what here is -- in this instance, the here is alone. Finish the thought, don't rely on the next line to supply the information for you.

K9laDjmGaa	The looking glass wars - Totaly awesome, its a retold story of Alice in Wonderland but totaly different and much more exciting and really good I just couldnt put it down. Good adventure I think and even a little romance in it(well kinda, not much but some) I loved it!!! Also really entertaining<br>  <br>  Maxium Ride is also another good one about these living science experiments that are like 98% human and 2% bird. Very Intresting and totally adventous if you like Eragon <br>  <br>  <br>  I know not many choices but both of these are really good though I prefer The Looking Glass Wars over Maximum Ride. Hope this helped!!!!|`|8SYorz1Jaa	i say twilight but you should try maximum ride if u read dat try hary potter there all good books. =)|`|gX05OncWaa	Haha, at first I thought you were another person on here asking for an idea for a novel.

Both excellent series. Oh, and Percy Jackson and the Olympians by Rick Riordan, first book The Lightning Thief. :)

It won the Pulitzer Prize and then went on to win Best Picture once it was turned into a movie.<br>  <br>  Or if you want a less serious read - but still very enjoyable - I'd recommend the Stephanie Plum series by Janet Evanovich.  Starts with "One for the Money."<br>  <br>  Water for Elephants is one of my favorites, too.  It was quite a journey.|`|EdfAcmJBaa	Peeps and there the sequels are all very good books.

245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	I'll make this brief because I don't have a ton of time (but if I did, this would be MUCH longer).<br>  <br>  The Harry Potter series is a fantastically written children's series because it attracts more than just children; it attracts people of different ages and genders, and I think it's because of the creativity of the world, the universal themes and topics of the novels, and how amazingly relate-able the characters are. The plot might seem a bit simple at first, but Rowling has planned her series out *so* carefully that there are events foreshadowing things in books two-three books over. For example, in the third book, Trelawney says that if thirteen dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die. In either Goblet of Fire or Order of the Phoenix, thirteen dine at Sirius's house, Sirius is the first to rise, and he's the first to die. Also, Nearly Headless Nick breaks the same vanishing cabinets in the first or second book that Malfoy spends his entire sixth year fixing.<br>  <br>  It's incredible.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	I have read them religiously.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	I enjoy them.  They're a nice easy, light read for when I don't want to think about what I'm reading too much.  I can just sink into Harry's world for a day or two and that can be all.  It's a perfect series for easy reading.|`|Q5cEmhDEaa	I love them!! Im 20, so i reckon some ppl would think im strange. Oh well, i really dont care. I have loved hp since i was really young.

FjJJdEHTaa	Not half bad, actually. You tend to be a bit repetitive with some words, but that usually can't be helped. <br>  I think it's rather interesting. I love fantasy books and this sounds like the type I would love to read. <br>  Oh, and grinning doesn't sound right. I am a writer myself and I only use grinning if I want to lighten the mood more. I use smile when I want the gravity of the situation to remain but give hope to the reader. Still, you might have a different opinion so it doesn't really matter.<br>  <br>  All in all this is a pretty good section. If I had more action and background it would be better, but that can't be helped. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|SaNoaVVqaa	The writing quality was good but it honestly didn't capture my attention.  That doesn't mean it's not good, it might be that this isn't my favorite genre or that this is sort of the middle so I'm not sure.<br>  Honestly, I'd go back and read it yourself.  You're your hardest critic, as they say, and I think that expression is so true.  You'll probably find a million things you could do better.  :D<br>  Good luck and keep writing!|`|dubuFbxuaa	I thought it was very good writing! I guess if I had to offer a suggestion, it would be to change sentence length a bit more, as most of them are around the same length and it can become repetitive after a while.

Also, it's easier on the eyes<br>  <br>  I also suggest you use the word "dead" for the rat; the word you use suggests civility, which just doesn't go. And toward the end, she wouldn't "grin", pool of light or not. Try "smiled vaguely"

This will give you an idea of what they are looking for, so you have a better chance of getting accepted.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Many famous authors have started by sending submissions to magazines, just take a trip to the bookstore and pick up a few and check out their submission policies.  Also picking up the printed material will again give you an idea of what they are looking for.<br>  <br>  If you want the phonebook, as it were, of publishing, you'll have to buy Writer's Market.  Published yearly, it is a big reference book full of publishers, if they accept submissions, how often they use freelance, etc.  It also contains lots of good articles about how much to charge, copyright law, advertsing-all the things a starting writer should know.   <br>  <br>  If you buy Writer's Market Deluxe Edition, you get access to their website-which makes it easy to look up publishers and track your submissions-as well as the phyiscal book. <br>  <br>   The same company also publishes more niche market books like Poetry Market, Songwriter's Market, what have you, geared toward those fields, but those don't have website support.<br>  <br>  Good luck

Both partners were supposed to give full and free consent to marry, forced marriage was frowned on by the church, however parents could sometimes bring pressure to bear on children to accept the spouse chosen for them if they were reluctant.<br>  <br>  Among the common people, it was more usual for people to choose their own marriage partners, and to marry later, usually in their twenties. They would be expected to have the consent of their parents.  Love alone was not thought to be a sound basis for marriage,but certainly love marriages did occur, and most people would be fond of the person they married.<br>  <br>  A wife would normally bring a dowry to the marriage, that is money or property to be used for her support (nobody was allowed to sell or othrewise dispose of her dowry).  In return, the groom was expected to provide a dower, that is an amoun tof money or property (at least a third of whatever he owned) that would be left to her for her use after he died.<br>  <br>  Whatever her station in life, a wife was expected to be obedient to her husband, and a husband was supposed to treat his wife with fairness and consideration.<br>  <br>  The majority of people were peasant farmers, and the wives of peasant men were kept pretty busy.  A peasant woman's  duties included spinning, weaving, sewing, cheese-making, cooking and cleaning, gardening, foraging, weeding, haymkaing, carrying, and animal-tending.  Women joined in the lord's harvest unless they were excused, and helped bring in the family's own harvest.  Often women served as paid labor, receiving at least some of the time wages equal to men's.<br>  <br>  The wives of tradsemen and craftsmen would often help in the family business as well as running the household, and widows often ran businesses after their husbands died.  Most guilds allowed the wives of members to join the guilds themselves.  As Frances and Joseph Gies put it in 'Marriage and the Family in the Middle ages'<br>  <br>  'The wife was business partner, working by his side: the children also helped or were put out as apprentices in the same or another trade.'<br>  <br>  The wives  of men of property would often be left to take care of the family  estate whiel their husbands were away. They might end up having to defend it form attack.  In The Paston letteers for example, Margaret Paston wrote to her hsuband in 1448:<br>  <br>  'I commend myself to you and ask you to get some crossbows and windlasses to wind them with, and crossbow bolts, for your houses here are so low that no one can shoot out of them with a longbow, however much we needed to.  I expect you can get such things from Sir John Fastolf if you were to send to him.

RrtUV5wcaa	here's a detailed summary on wikipedia:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potte...</a><br>  <br>  here's a summary (i just copied it from wikipedia :P)<br>  Several weeks into the summer, Harry Potter has heard nothing from his friends or acquaintances from the wizard world. Finding himself walking down a street with his cousin Dudley, the two of them are attacked by a pair of Dementors. Harry drives them off with a Patronus Charm, and is surprised to learn that the Dursleys' elderly neighbour Arabella Figg, is a Squib and has been keeping an eye on him on Albus Dumbledore’s orders. On returning home, he immediately receives a notice of expulsion from Hogwarts for using magic outside school, and that his wand is to be snapped, though these decisions are reversed, set to be decided at a disciplinary hearing. One night, an advance guard from the Order of the Phoenix arrives at the house and escorts Harry to their secret headquarters at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place in London, where Harry joins the Weasley family, Hermione Granger, and Harry’s godfather Sirius Black.<br>  <br>  They tell Harry that Voldemort is building an army and is attempting to retrieve a weapon, but is still moving in secret. In this, he is actually aided by the Ministry, since Minister Cornelius Fudge is conducting an extensive smear campaign against Harry, Dumbledore, and anyone else who says Voldemort is back. Knowing that Voldemort’s return would mean mass panic and then open war, Fudge prefers to believe that Dumbledore is lying and attempting to supplant him as Minister.<br>  <br>  A few days later, Arthur Weasley escorts Harry to his expulsion hearing, which Fudge has done everything in his power to slant against him. But testimony from Dumbledore and Mrs Figg confirms the presence of the Dementors, and Harry is found to have acted in self-defence.<br>  <br>  Shortly before returning to Hogwarts, Harry is surprised and a little disappointed when Ron and Hermione, but not he, are made prefects of Gryffindor House.<br>  <br>  Along the way to Hogwarts, on the Hogwarts express, Harry meets a girl named Luna Lovegood, a girl who has a reputation for believing far-fetched stories. Her huge imagination is the reason that she is commonly disliked and rejected. . At the welcome feast, the trio are surprised that their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts is Dolores Umbridge, a hostile Ministry official who presided at Harry's hearing. Hermione guesses, correctly, that her appointment is a sign that the Ministry is interfering at Hogwarts. As a teacher, Umbridge forces the students to study magical theory out of textbooks, rather than practical defence methods (according to Sirius, Fudge is so paranoid that he now believes Dumbledore is recruiting students into a private army). A short time later, she is appointed as High Inquisitor, with the power to evaluate and dismiss other teachers, and impose strict rules and regulations on students.<br>  <br>  Underneath her cloying fa?ade, Umbridge imposes sadistic punishments on naughty students, her favourite being to make them write lines with blood quills (which cut the words into the skin when used, and uses the writer's own blood as ink). She focuses particularly on Harry, as part of Fudge’s campaign to silence his “lies” about Voldemort’s return. Her punishments also include banning Harry from the Gryffindor Quidditch team.<br>  <br>  She is also intensely bigoted, harbouring deep loathing for "half-breeds", such as centaurs, werewolves, and Rubeus Hagrid (a half-giant). In short order, she dismisses Sybill Trelawney as incompetent and places Hagrid on probation. Although Dumbledore is unable to prevent Trelawney's dismissal, he invokes his authority to allow her to remain in the castle and appoints a new Divination teacher — the centaur, Firenze.<br>  <br>  Hagrid was absent for half the year, he reveals to Harry, Ron, and Hermione, because of a diplomatic mission to the giants on Dumbledore’s orders, to try to dissuade them from joining Voldemort. His mission was a failure, but he also reveals, somewhat shamefacedly, that he secretly brought one of the giants back - his half-brother Grawp, whom he has been keeping tied up in the Forbidden Forest and trying to "civilize."<br>  <br>  Because Umbridge’s lessons are useless both for passing their O.W.L.s and for preparing for the very real threat of Voldemort, Hermione decides that the students need to learn the subject themselves. Harry is surprised when she proposes him as a teacher, but she reminds him that his adventures of the last four years at Hogwarts have actually made him an authority on the subject. Several other students from Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Hufflepuff likewise sign up to the clandestine group, named "Dumbledore's Army" in mockery of Fudge’s paranoia.<br>  <br>  Under Harry's tutoring, the group learns defensive magic. At the last meeting before Christmas, Cho Chang stays after, and Harry, hoping to receive a Merry Christmas, gets an even bigger surprise - a kiss. When they return to Hogwarts after Christmas break, Harry asks her to go with him to Hogsmeade on Valentine's Day. However, while they are there, Harry mistakenly makes Cho think he likes Hermione. Cho breaks up with him.<br>  <br>  To combat the Ministry's smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore, Hermione blackmails yellow journalist Rita Skeeter into writing an interview with Harry about his witnessing Voldemort's return. Ravenclaw student Luna Lovegood's father publishes the story in his magazine, The Quibbler. Furious, Umbridge bans the Quibbler from the school, but the story spreads rapidly, garnering support for Harry. Harry and Cho get back together.<br>  <br>  Midway through the year, the school is alarmed to hear news of a mass prison break from Azkaban Prison, when ten of Voldemort’s most powerful Death Eaters escape. Many wizards are not satisfied with the Ministry’s official explanation, and begin to come around to Dumbledore and Harry’s claims, while the D.A. members are inspired to work even harder.<br>  <br>  Eventually Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad, comprising mostly Slytherin students, uncover the D.A. meetings, helped by a member of the D.A. named Marietta, who told Umbridge about the meetings. To protect Harry and other students from reprisals, Dumbledore claims that he organized the group to counter Voldemort. Confronted by Fudge, Percy Weasley, Umbridge and Aurors (John Dawlish and Kingsley Shacklebolt), Dumbledore easily overpowers them and is whisked away by his phoenix, Fawkes. Cho, who is Marietta's friend, gets mad at Harry for accusing Marietta and breaks up with him again.<br>  <br>  Umbridge becomes Headmistress and enacts even stricter rules and fires Hagrid. The disenchanted Weasley twins revolt, unleashing relentless magical chaos throughout the school, while the staff purposely do nothing to help Umbridge regain control. The twins are caught, but summoning their confiscated brooms, they fly away, leaving Hogwarts to open their own joke shop.<br>  <br>  Throughout the year, Harry has disturbing dreams about running down a hallway and attempting to open a door in the Ministry's Department of Mysteries. Shortly before Christmas, he dreams he is a snake attacking Ron's father. Mr Weasley is indeed found injured at the Ministry, suffering from severe venomous snakebites, causing Harry to fear that Voldemort is possessing him. In response, Dumbledore has Severus Snape teach Harry Occlumency to block his mind from intrusion, but their mutual animosity ends their lessons prematurely. In the course of these lessons, Harry inadvertently sees one of Snape’s memories from his school years, and is shocked to see his father James Potter bullying Snape and acting as arrogantly as Snape always said that he did. He also notices (but is not surprised) that Snape refers to his mother as a mudblood, despite the fact that she defended him.<br>  <br>  In the middle of his last O.W.L. exam, Harry has a vision of Sirius being tortured at the Department of Mysteries, although Hermione suspects it may be a trap. Harry, with help from various members of Dumbledore's Army, attempts to contact Sirius at Grimmauld Place via the Floo Network in Umbridge's office fireplace, but he is caught. Believing that he is attempting to contact the fugitive Dumbledore, Umbridge interrogates Harry, who swears he does not know where he is. Umbridge summons Snape to bring truth serum, but Snape says he has run out. Before Snape leaves her office, Harry desperately tells him in code about his vision of Sirius.<br>  <br>  Reaching the end of her patience, Umbridge announces that she plans to use the illegal torture curse on Harry. She is sure that no one will find out or even care, and reveals that it was she and not Voldemort who sent the Dementors to attack him, in an attempt to frame or silence him. As she raises her wand to administer the curse, Hermione pretends to crack and confesses Dumbledore has hidden a powerful weapon in the Forbidden Forest. She leads Harry and Umbridge into the forest where they encounter the centaurs. Umbridge foolishly insults them and an angry centaur carries her off screaming into the woods. However, the centaurs are just as hostile toward Harry and Hermione, but they are saved when Grawp crashes onto the scene and they escape amid the chaos. Running back to the castle, they encounter Ron, and D.A. members Ginny, Neville and Luna, who insist on accompanying them. The students fly to London on the school's Thestrals.<br>  <br>  Reaching the room in his dreams, The Hall of Prophecy, Harry sees that Sirius is not there, but notices a glass ball containing some kind of record, that has been labelled with his name. As soon as he takes it down off the shelf, a squad of Death Eaters surrounds them, including many of the recent escapees, and led by Lucius Malfoy. Malfoy reveals that Voldemort planted a false vision t|`|ek8iGsRfaa	Alot! Here's a summary:<br>  <br>  is spending another tedious summer with his dreadful Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon when a group of evil spirits called “dementors” stage an unexpected attack on Harry and his cousin Dudley. After using magic to defend himself, Harry is visited by a group of wizards and whisked off to number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London. Number twelve is the home of Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, and the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. The Order is a group of wizards, led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting evil Lord Voldemort and his followers. The Order is forced to operate in secrecy, outside of the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Magic, which is headed by the dense and corrupt Cornelius Fudge. Fudge refuses to believe that Lord Voldemort has returned.<br>   <br>  Harry used magic to fight off the dementors, and since underage wizards are not permitted to use their wands outside of school, he must face a disciplinary hearing at the Ministry. With Dumbledore's help, Harry is cleared and permitted to return to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. <br>   <br>  Reunited with his best friends, Ron and Hermione, Harry returns to Hogwarts and learns that Dolores Umbridge, an employee of Fudge, will be his new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. The Daily Prophet, continues printing untrue and unfair stories about Harry. Many of his classmates are whispering about him behind his back, but Harry ignores them and tries to concentrate on his studies, since all fifth-year students at Hogwarts are required to take O.W.L.s, or Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations. <br>   <br>  Umbridge refuses to teach her students how to perform Defense spells, and before long, Fudge appoints her High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, giving her the authority to inspect all faculty members and evaluate their skills. In desperation, Harry, Hermione, and Ron form their own Defense Against the Dark Arts group, also known as the D.A., or Dumbledore's Army. Twenty-five other students sign up, and they meet as often as possible to learn and practice Defense spells. Umbridge openly dislikes Harry, whom she considers a liar, and eventually bans him from the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Ron's twin brothers, Fred and George, storm out of Hogwarts in protest, moving to London where they plan to open a joke shop using the money Harry won last year in the Triwizard Tournament.<br>   <br>  Harry continues to have upsetting dreams about walking down a corridor at the Department of Mysteries, deep inside the Ministry of Magic. At the end of the corridor, Harry goes through several doors and enters a room full of dusty glass spheres. Harry always wakes up before he finds out what the dream means or what the spheres signify. One night, Harry has a vision where he inhabits the body of a large snake, and attacks Ron's father. Harry wakes up horrified, and Professor McGonagall takes him to Dumbledore immediately. Dumbledore uses the portraits on the walls of his office to raise an alert, and Mr. Weasley is promptly rescued by two members of the Order. Dumbledore then demands that Harry take Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape, which should help Harry protect his mind against further invasions by Lord Voldemort. <br>   Harry is unsuccessful at Occlumency because he has such difficulty clearing his mind of all thoughts, making it difficult for him to focus on closing his mind off to all outside influence. Meanwhile, his scar (from the attack in which Voldemort killed Harry's parents) burns horribly every time Voldemort experiences a powerful emotion. The D.A. continues to meet regularly, and Harry's peers show great improvement until they are caught by Umbridge. Dumbledore takes full responsibility for the group and resigns as Headmaster. Umbridge takes over his position. The students begin taking their O.W.L. exams, and Harry has another vision, this time about Sirius being held captive and tortured by Voldemort. Horrified, Harry becomes determined to save him. Hermione warns Harry that Voldemort may be deliberately trying to lure Harry to the Department of Mysteries, but Harry is too concerned about Sirius to take any chances. <br>   Harry sneaks into Umbridge's office, and, using her fireplace, transports himself to Twelve Grimmauld Place to look for Sirius. Kreacher, the Black house elf, tells Harry that Sirius is at the Ministry of Magic. Harry returns to Hogwarts to find that he and his friends have been caught in Umbridge's office. Hermione and Harry convince Umbridge to follow them into the forest, where they claim to be hiding a weapon for Dumbledore. Once in the forest, Centaurs carry Umbridge away. Harry and his friends climb aboard flying horses called thestrals and speed off to the Ministry. Once they arrive, Harry cannot find Sirius and realizes that Hermione was right. Harry also sees that one of the glass spheres has his name on it, as well as Voldemort's. Harry grabs the sphere, and Death Eaters surround to attack, demanding that Harry hand over the prophecy. Employing all of their Defense skills, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Luna, and Neville have moderate success fighting the Death Eaters, but they are ultimately helped enormously by the arrival of several members of the Order. In the midst of the fight, Harry drops the glass sphere, and it shatters. Meanwhile, Sirius' own cousin, Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange, kills Sirius. Harry is devastated.<br>   Dumbledore appears and corrals the Death Eaters. Voldemort and Lestrange escape, just as Fudge shows up. Dumbledore sends Harry back to school, where he explains how the sphere was a prophecy, which stated that Harry has a power that Voldemort does not know about. Dumbledore explains that this power is love. The prophecy goes on to claim that Harry will either destroy Voldemort or be destroyed by him. Dumbledore takes this opportunity to tell Harry why he must spend his summers with the Durselys in Little Whinging. Because Harry's mother died to save him, he is blessed with her love, a blessing that can be sealed only by blood.

Bella attracts much attention at her new school and is quickly befriended by several students. Much to her dismay, several boys compete for shy Bella's attention.<br>  <br>  When Bella is seated next to Edward Cullen in class on her first day of school, Edward seems utterly repulsed by her. However, over the next few days Edward warms up to her, and their newfound relationship reaches a climax when Bella is nearly run over by a fellow classmate's van in the school parking lot. Seemingly defying the laws of reality, Edward saves her life when he instantaneously appears next to her and stops the van with his bare hands.<br>  <br>  Bella becomes hellbent on figuring out how Edward saved her life, and constantly pesters him with questions. After tricking a family friend, Jacob Black, into telling her local tribal legends, Bella concludes that Edward and his family are vampires who drink animal blood rather than human. Edward confesses that he initially avoided Bella because the scent of her blood was so desirable to him. Over time, Edward and Bella fall in love.<br>  <br>  Their relationship is thrown into chaos when another vampire coven sweeps into Forks. James, a tracker vampire who is intrigued by the Cullens' relationship with a human, wants to hunt Bella for sport. The Cullens attempt to distract the tracker by splitting up Bella and Edward, and Bella is sent to hide in a hotel in Phoenix. There, Bella receives a phone call from James, who claims he is holding her mother captive. When Bella surrenders herself, James attacks her, but Edward, along with the other Cullens, rescues Bella and kills James. Once they realize that James has bitten Bella's hand, Edward sucks the venom from her system before it can spread and transform her into a vampire, and she is then sent to a hospital. Upon returning to Forks, Bella and Edward attend their school prom and Bella expresses her desire to become a vampire, which Edward refuses.|`|NmfEaN3Uaa	Your already on page 250.... youre half, or more I don't remember done with it!

POETRY.COM IS A SCAM.  JUST SEARCH "POETRY.COM SCAM AND YOU WILL SEE LOTS OF COMPLAINTS!!!<br>  <br>  It's sweet, but is very hard to read as one block of text.  To bring more emphasis you should break it up into smaller sections like this:<br>  <br>  My midnight moon calls to me,<br>  Inviting me to stay with her<br>  And the stars<br>  In my midnight sky.<br>  <br>  My midnight moon calls to me.<br>  Telling me it will all be okay again.<br>  As long as i join her<br>  and the stars<br>  In my midnight sky.<br>  <br>  But that would mean<br>  I would to leave you.<br>  I dont want to leave you<br>  <br>  Get the idea?  It's the exact same words, but the pacing is much better.<br>  <br>  There also appear to be some missing words and typos, which detract from the impact.  A great way to check your work for a final draft is to read it aloud.  You'll be surprised at what you miss just scanning over it.  Also, reading poetry aloud will make clunky words or illogical sentences stand out.  Remember the pauses between words help develop the rhythm of the piece as much as the words themselves.<br>  <br>  That being said let's take a look at your rhythm.  Freeverse  is very popular these days, but it doesn't mean no rhythm.  Your poem follows a fairly regular rhythm in the beginning and becomes more disjointed towards the end.  Your lack of spacing adds to this confusing rhythm.  Trimming a syllable here adding another one there will give the poem a consistent feel and guide the reader.<br>  <br>  Now lets talk about tense.  Consistent active voice lends writing more clarity and power. Needless words should also be omitted. Lets try this:<br>  <br>  My midnight moon calls to me<br>  .Inviting me to stay with her<br>  And the stars<br>  In my midnight sky.<br>  <br>  A little more actively:<br>  <br>  My midnight moon, she calls to me<br>  Invites me to stay. <br>  Amidst the stars,<br>  In my midnight sky.<br>  <br>  Remember, you can rewrite a poem.  There seems to be a misconception that poems are just a one-shot deal, but this is just not true.<br>  <br>  Of course you are the final arbiter of the direction and mode the poem takes, but it can always be groomed and reworked.  It is important to be honest and see if you are being cliche, then think if you can say it a different way.  That is the goal of all writing.|`|CZtderJjaa	That is some Amazing talent in writing that poem. I really like the part:<br>  Someday i will sleep with my midnight moon<br>  In my midnight sky<br>  And with the stars.<br>  But now<br>  I'd rather be with you.<br>  As my midnight moon calls to me<br>  And casts shadows over me<br>  You come<br>  And my morning sun rises<br>  And everything becomes bright.<br>  I am no longer cold under my midnight moon <br>  That sits in my midnight sky<br>  With the stars.<br>  I do not want to die.<br>  i would rather be in your arms.<br>  <br>  good job:)|`|AA10252167	Dear Ashley F,<br>  <br>  Your poems are a way to paint an image of your thoughts in words... just as the artist paints a picture of their thoughts with paint and canvas....<br>  <br>  It is obvious that each word in your poem expresses something special to you... <br>  <br>  Keep writing your poems and start writing a journal of each day of your life...  <br>  <br>  And always check your spelling.to make sure that it is correct... <br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|IBdSIw5maa	Wow.

So, I purchased it, and began reading.  I became hooked.  Not only because it was a fantastic, traumatizing story- but, because it was so easy to emotionally connect, and bond with the characters.<br>  <br>  There are 4 books following that one.  In that one, the children are young- and through out each book, they are different ages (introducing new characters, which are easily bond-able to as well).<br>  <br>  Of course, because you learn to love these characters, you learn to mourn them.  It's so sad.  I balled my eyes out.

Was immune to all attacks on his body except on his heel because when his mother (Thetis) dipped him in the river styx to make him immortal she held onto his heel. His best friend was Patrocles and he refused to fight in some of the war because Agamemnon insulted him. He only fought after Patrocles' death and killed Hector. he was later shot by Paris in the heel while attacking the Scaean gate with an ax.<br>  Agamemnon - Lord of Men. He is the king of Mycenaea, the most powerful Greek nation. He killed his daughter Iphigenia to get a good wind to sail to Troy. He was killed by his wife, and her lover, when he returned home after the war.<br>  Patrocles - Best friend of Achilles. Went out in Achilles' armor to save the ships but tried to climb the walls of Troy and was killed by Apollo and Hector.<br>  Odysseus - King of Ithaca. He is known as the master tactician and is brilliant on the field of battle and off. He devised the plan of the Trojan Horse and after the Trojan War traveled ten years before reaching home.<br>  Menelaus - King of Sparta and wife of Helen. When she ran off he went to Agamemnon to get the largest army to get her back. He dueled Paris and almost killed him but Aphrodite saved him. He was then shot with an arrow, but didn't die, and the war began again. He eventually got Helen back and traveled to Egypt before returning home to Sparta.<br>  Nestor - King of Pylos. He is old and wise and is always telling stories. <br>  Big Ajax - A giant man. He duels Hector and almost kills him. Later when Achilles dies and Odysseus is awarded Achilles' armor Ajax kills himself because of the shame of not be awarded it himself.<br>  Diomedes - King of Tiryns. He is a mad warrior who attacks gods and is an overall badass. <br>  <br>  Trojans:<br>  Hector - Prince of Troy. One of the greatest warriors in the world. He single handedly kept the Trojans from defeat and was killed by Achilles. He is really the main character of the Iliad, or so i believe. He was also a great man, not just a great warrior.<br>  Paris - A pretty boy. Sometimes called Alexander of Alexandros. He was given the task of choosing the fairest god, between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. He choose the latter because she offered him the most beautiful women in the world. He was a coward who used a bow as a weapon. He was killed by Philoctetes and Herekles' poison bow.<br>  Priam - King of Troy. He fathered fifty sons and is very old when the war begins. He is killed on his bed when Troy is sacked. He also begs to achilles to return his son, Hector to him, after his is killed.<br>  Hecuba - Wife of Priam. She is queen of Troy.<br>  Andromache - Wife of Hector. They have a son named Astyanax who is thrown off the walls of Troy when the city is sacked. <br>  Aenaeas - Prince of Dardanos. He is the daughter of Aphrodite and is saved by her a couple times. He escapes Troy before it is burned and goes on to found the greatest city in the history of the world, Rome.<br>  Helen - Wife of Menelaus, Paris, and another one of Priam's sons. She ran away from Sparta and started the whole war, or so the poets say. <br>  <br>  Gods: (I'm assuming don't need a description of these. I'll just put their allegiances instead to help)<br>  Zeus - Neutral<br>  Hera - Greeks<br>  Athena - Greeks<br>  Ares - Trojans<br>  Apollo - Trojans<br>  Poseidon - Greeks<br>  Thetis - Achilles mother, Greeks<br>  Aphrodite - Trojans<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|mP6ox5f3aa	This is based on the classic books of the Iliad. Book 3. takes off on Helen of Troy It relates to the events that are  a continuation of the war and attack by the ancient Greeks. We have the single combat between Paris and Menelaus, Paris wins, the treachery of Pandarus, the death of Achilles and the sacking of Troy. The death of Hector who's corpse is dragged through the dust. There are gods involved if you read up the whole iliad and there is no real evidence of the battle of Troy and the wooden horse.  <br>  Read Homer if you are ready for a heavy read.

In the report that they issued to the president the following year, the commissioners acknowledged Filipino aspirations for independence; they declared, however, that the Philippines was not ready for it.[40]"

In fact, in most every case, area bombing of cities (even when their were legitimate war targets in them) tended to draw people together and reinforce patriotism rather than weaken it.<br>  <br>  Additionally, the governments of Japan and Germany were totalitarian, and did not rely upon the will of the governed.  They were essentially police states, and so no amount of misery inflicted upon the civilian population was enough to force the governments to make peace.  Well, ALMOST no amount of misery was enough.  Clearly, there was an upper limit for the Japanese Empiror.|`|YXGdwwTJaa	Who says it did not reduce enemy morale.  Those who survived such  severe destruction must have been devastated, though whether it made them apathetic or more furious is debatable..<br>  <br>  Civilians, in large cities, were not vital to the conduct of the war.  Those producing weapons and food were more useful than women and children and old people, many of whom would have made up those who were killed.

Governments look to the end of the war, to achieving victory and keeping their power by any means, and this does not just apply to totalitarian powers.

Look at the Warsaw uprising, for example.  Additionally, Jews fought openly in the armies of most all the Allies, and in Eastern Europe, particularly, Jews qwho had seen what Hitler's armies were doing made very dedicated partisans.  <br>  <br>  On the broader scale, Jews, like most other European peoples, had little access to firearms, and generally before the war were not allowed into the armed forces, and so had very few combat veterans among their numbers.  Finally, the Jews of Europe tended to be a very law-abiding people, and trusted the laws and "civilized rules" would protect them without the need to resort to violence.|`|lUzonjLfaa	<a href="https://bsgelitcircles.wikispaces.com/message/view/Holocaust+discussion/4585169" rel="nofollow">https://bsgelitcircles.wikispaces.com/me...</a><br>  <br>  ^ Whole Discussion about it Read It !<br>  <br>  Or..read mine :) <br>  <br>  From the few photos and the small amount of film remaining, the overwhelming image is of lambs going meekly to the slaughter. <br>  <br>  Please bear in mind: <br>  <br>  <br>  1. The Jews transported to extermination camps had often been in cattle trucks for 2-4 days and were weak, hungry and thirsty on arrival. Moreover, long before being loaded on to trains they hadn't had enough to eat. <br>  <br>  2. Many of the Jews sent to the camps had spent the previous three years or so in ghettos - again with insufficient food. They had been subject to endless petty restrictions since 1939-40, such as not being allowed to shop before 3.30pm, by which time shelves in many shops were often half empty, as the war created all kinds of shortages. They were forbidden to own radios or buy newspapers, too. Their warm clothing was seized. <br>  <br>  3. Usually, Jews lived in small communities (especially in Western and Central Europe). Even in the 'Jewish quarters' of many European cities the majority of the population often wasn't Jewish. In other words, the Jews were rather isolated and didn't have the cohesion that is generally necessary for resistance. <br>  In some parts of Eastern Europe the Jews DID fight the Nazis, for example in Belarus. However, the best known example is that of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in 1943. Obviously, the inhabitants of the ghetto were physically weak and not well placed to take on the SS.|`|mP6ox5f3aa	You have to realise that Hitler overran Poland before anyone could do anything about it. He then controlled most of Europe. Nobody at that time could have anticipated the total destruction of a people. Killing on an industrial scale was unique to Germany and Hitler. It was a designed event by murderous Germans with no conscience what so ever. It had never been done before. Unarmed civilians are no match for an army. There was some resistance but the Germans were fairly quiet about the whole operation.<br>  I am not a Jew but I lived through WW2 and remember being amazed and horrified by the Cinema films of the News at the end of WW2.
e7J7bFGyaa	A good book that relates to business but is fiction is So Yesterday by Scott Westerfield. It follows different trends, as well as talking about advertizing and how things are spread throughout malls and stores. <br>  It's also a good book to read. :D<br>  <br>  Here's the summary:<br>  What if it was your job to say what was cool? What if clothes and electronics companies gave you cash for your opinion, and lots of free stuff on top of it? You wouldn't complain about that, would you?<br>  <br>  Hunter Braque is a professional cool-hunter. No ads go on TV without his approval, no new shoes hit the stores unless he's down with them. It's a pretty sweet deal, until he meets Jen—a rare Innovator, one of the people who actually creates cool at street-level. Real cool, not the corporate kind. Suddenly, strange things start to happen.<br>  <br>  First Hunter's boss Mandy disappears. When he enlists Jen to help find her, the two begin to uncover a plot to end consumerism as we know it!

O4ZkFMQ6aa	Voldemort died because he wasn't the true master of the wand that he was holding. Voldemort killed Snape thinking that he was the true master of the wand because he was the one that killed Dumbledore. Unfortunately for Voldemort, Draco Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore before Snape killed him. Harry then defeated Draco in Deathly Hallows and that made him the master of the wand. Voldemort refused to believe this and the wand turned on him after he used the Avada Kedavra curse against Harry because the wand belonged to Harry.<br>  <br>  That's kind of the more detailed instructions, but I'm assuming parts confuse you since it doesn't sound like you read the books.|`|e7J7bFGyaa	He died when he threw "Avada Kedavra" at Harry and Harry threw "Expelliarmus" at Voldemort and the Avada Kedavra rebounded against the Expelliarmus and hit Voldemort, who didn't survive as all of his Horcruxes had been previously destroyed.

The narrative touches on many contemporary issues, including AIDS, homophobia, racism and religious fundamentalism, while chronicling several problematic love relationships. Horse trainer Sidra Ballard is the tough, beautiful 20-something protagonist in love with Curtis, a redneck homophobic bass player in a local band. Though an unlikely pair, the two can't keep their hands off each other and decide to marry. But relationship trouble comes in the form of Curtis's younger step-brother, Paul, a troubled homosexual teen with a penchant for picking up older men. Curtis is disgusted by Paul's behavior, but Sidra, who earlier lost a sister to AIDS, longs to protect Paul. Meanwhile Kent, a member of Curtis's band, is unexpectedly attracted to Paul and a love affair begins between the two men. A large cast of characters takes turns narrating the story, their identities often obscure to the reader, who must concentrate to distinguish them."|`|QsVMeaPXaa	<a href="http://www.gayfictionstories.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gayfictionstories.com/</a> <br>  This site lists authors and story titles, perhaps seeing one or the other will ring a bell.

Austria was a very mixed race country that was thinly held together before the war.  The goal was to seperate Austria based on ethnicity.

cxDbdhELaa	Because perhaps there is not but one truth? Our conceptual system, which we use to attempt to apprehend the world, is metaphorically built around our direct contact with and experience of that which surrounds our mental capacities.<br>  <br>  As such, the system is just an attempt to apprehend the many intricacies and variations, randomness and contradictions which we encounter.<br>  <br>  The outcome for philosophers is that many variations on valid philosophical theories results.|`|2dWlUEimaa	This is a difficult question to answer precisely, and I'm not going to try and answer it directly. Rather, I'll make a couple points.<br>  <br>  In the Greek language, the word for truth is alitheia αλ?θεια. Alitheia technically comes from two key roots: the alpha-private "a(n)-" α(ν)- which is like the prefixes in- and un- in English, and the word lithi λ?θη, the word for 'forgotten', 'hidden', 'covered', etc. So alitheia (truth) technically means "uncovered" or "unhidden". Apparently, the ancient Greek concept/idea of truth is that it is always around us, but it is hidden and therefore difficult to uncover.<br>  <br>  What am I trying to get at finally? Each attempt at philosophy is a different approach at uncovering the truth, and it's possible that various attempts uncover different parts of the truth.<br>  <br>  I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.<br>  <br>  @emmittripley: what you are talking about is called existentialism, and it's a branch within the discipline of philosophy.|`|D8sN8gNFaa	It's actually more of investigating the questions of our own existence, and asking "why".|`|t5mX3rwLaa	because the answers change depending on the historic background.|`|8kAsUhniaa	I'd say it's because there is more than one truth.  And many ways to approach those truths.|`|PntiBQCRaa	Well everyone  thinks Differently. Thats why we have different views to explain the unknown. There is no right answer and we will never know the right answer.|`|BVf2eAWnaa	because we can't know which theory is closer to the truth because we don't know the truth.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Because the truth is always one step ahead of us. Our perceptions or recognition of an event is not the same as the event, so which is true? The event or your perception OF it? <br>  <br>  My opinion<br>  <br>  I think that the first answer doesn't apply to all philosophy, because some believe there is no purpose.
XOnSRoR2aa	Tragically, there have been two real-life Romeo and Juliet stories in the past few years. I've pasted the articles and links below. <br>  <br>  Real-Life Romeo And Juliet Tragedy Sparks Sadness Overseas<br>  Thursday November 1, 2007<br>  CityNews.ca Staff<br>  <br>  A real life tragedy out of Romeo and Juliet has resulted in the loss of one young man's life and left his lover in critical condition. Vangelis Karras and Irini Karra both fell in love in June but their families told them they could never get married. The reason? She's still a teenager, they're second cousins and the union was condemned by their relatives.<br>  <br>  So the 25-year-old Karras and his 17-year-old would-be wife Karra made a suicide pact. And earlier this week, they decided to carry it out. Both wound up in a barn in the town of Iarepetra (top left) on the island of Crete, with Vangelis making a final phone call to his shocked uncle. "We are in the barn. We are going to take poison," he warned. "We can't stand this anymore."<br>  <br>  They sadly followed through on their threat before help could arrive and authorities found Vangelis dead and his teenaged cousin in a coma. She remains in hospital in critical condition. Why didn't the pair simply run away and elope? They weren't able to. Under Greek law parental permission is needed for anyone under the age of 18 to be legally married.<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  Italian dies in 'Romeo' tragedy<br>  A husband in Italy who lost hope of his wife waking from a four-month coma has killed himself - only for his beloved to regain consciousness hours later.<br>  <br>  Doctors said when Rossana, 67, stirred, she asked for her husband Ettore.<br>  <br>  The tragedy, recalling the ending of Romeo and Juliet, took place in Padua, 60km (40 miles) from Verona, the setting of Shakespeare's play.<br>  <br>  Ettore, 71, had kept a daily vigil at Rossana's side after she had a stroke and fell into a coma in September.<br>  <br>  Italian media report that he would visit his wife daily, sometimes coming to the hospital in the northern town as many as four times a day.<br>  <br>  But on Wednesday, Ettore committed suicide by gassing himself in the garage of the couple's Padua home.<br>  <br>  About 12 hours later, Rossana, a former nurse, emerged from the coma and asked for her husband.<br>  <br>  Ettore had recently told the local pastor that he was very pessimistic about the prospects of his wife's recovery, Italian news agency Ansa reports. The couple had no children.<br>  <br>  In Shakespeare's play, Juliet drinks a potion in order to appear dead as part of a plan to elope with Romeo.<br>  <br>  Unaware of this, Romeo, believing she is dead, kills himself. Juliet awakens and, seeing Romeo dead, stabs herself. <br>  <br>  ~ Pax / Peace : )|`|aNnH73aoaa	It's our English project about Asian literature.

In order to keep the slaves from keeping the raft, Jim told the slaves that the raft belonged to Huck, and that Huck would get mad if they took the raft. Therefore, Jim used the fact that he was friends with a white man in order to gain an edge over his fellow black men.

5oAU7S9zaa	These are my top 7 favorite series and novels…<br>  <br>  Vampire Diaries by L.J Smith*******<br>  Recently became a comeback series.(3 books total, fourth one coming soon)<br>  Elena: the golden girl, the leader, the one who can have any boy she wants. <br>  Stefan: brooding and mysterious, he seems to be the only one who can resist Elena, even as he struggles to protect her from the horrors that haunt his past. <br>  Damon: sexy, dangerous, and driven by an urge for revenge against Stefan, the brother who betrayed him.

Jeb, a sympathetic scientist, helped them escape and, since then, they've been living on their own. The Erasers have orders to kill them so the world will never find out they exist. Max's old childhood friend, Ari, now an Eraser leader, tracks them down, kidnaps Angel, and transports her back to the School to live like a lab rat again.

It's written by Harper Lee, It has to due with racial tension , and morals in the 1930's. It follows a family "The Finch's" and a Court trial. The main theme is about judging people and prejudices. It's usually read in 10th grade, It's a little slow at first , but by part two you will be addicted... It will enrich you, so read it!|`|Pq8gQsl2aa	Here are some great reads that would probably challenge you at your age:<br>  <br>  The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd<br>  Anything that was written by Sarah Dessen. <br>  The Lace Reader<br>  The Historian <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8a6npzfKaa	A walk to remember<br>  the twilight seris <br>  The note book<br>   nick and norah infinte playlish<br>  Disturbia|`|nmLt7jR4aa	Read 'The Fountainhead' by Ayn Rand.

KTNqah9eaa	Hitler's theories about the 'Aryan Race' were a fiction designed to create a national identity limited to some German nationals and not others. The Jews were persecuted because they were an easy scapegoat to unify other Germans, similar to the way Muslims are targeted in many Western countries and Westerners are targeted in many Muslim countries today. It's been a sad but common feature of history and current politics worldwide that if you convince enough people that others are different and a threat, you can win power and hold onto it until such time as people realise the negative bankruptcy of such policies.<br>  Neither Bush nor Hitler learned that lesson in time.|`|o1l5JHHTaa	The Visigoths invaded Rome and destroyed it.Then they fought each other after they moved all over Europe. Then Clovis was considered to be the first barbarian king to be baptized Christian. Well to make a long story short the white people dominate and don't need to be controlled by the Jewish people through religion.
X4umNoGzaa	I would definitely recommend "Eyes of the Dragon" By Stephen King if you haven't read it already. its one of his books that is more sci-fi than horror, "Rose Madder" is another, not positive about the title on that one but i think that's it, if not its close. <br>  <br>  I also would recommend any of the Bishop Series by Kay Hooper, they are about an FBI division that uses physics to solve crimes, you might not like those, though because they do have a slight romantic theme at parts, but are really good.<br>  <br>  I don't really read Sci-Fi Books that often, but my older brother does, and he really likes Terry Goodkind.

QRtFW4GWaa	Your question is difficult because the four characters you picked were written more as archetypal characters meant to be seen as a kind of "everyman".  The circumstances of Romeo and Juliet meeting and falling in love are rare enough, but besides that the personalities are not fleshed out in the text...the kind of person they are is usually filled in by the actor.  It is far easier to answer your question using characters who have a defining personality trait.<br>  For example:<br>  Tybalt- he's handsome and a great fighter.  Most people love him, but he has a super quick temper...in the text he is compared to a large cat (like a lynx or a mountain lion), so somebody perhaps like Christian Bale?<br>  <br>  I hope that's some food for thought.|`|UiXfvdoVaa	Juliet is a butterfly becuase she changed so much over the course of five days... umm  I don't know about a person......

"Rabbi - when does Life Begin"???<br>  <br>  And the Rabbi said, "When the last child leaves home and the dog dies".....|`|J58okEzraa	I'll answer this question from a scientific perspective.<br>  <br>  If by "life" you mean a living organism with a metabolism and that is capable of growth and reproduction (later on at least), then the answer is at the instant the male and female pronuclei fuse (right after fertilization). At this point the newly formed zygote has 46 chromosomes and is considered a diploid, living organism.<br>  <br>  If by "life" you mean the point at which a fetus gains sentience however (and my guess is that this is what you meant), then the answer has not yet been determined. Some anti-abortionists claim that the presence of activity in the developing brain of an embryo at six weeks is evidence of sentience, but no conclusive evidence exists at this point.|`|AA10507866	It's a serious point of contention these days.<br>  Some say life begins at conception.<br>  Others, that life begins upon a fetus leaving the womb.<br>  It's like two people standing in two different spots and attempting to judge an objects distance from a third point that neither have been to.<br>  All the while contesting that the other is wrong.|`|GNqQnAy9aa	/when your cheeks get their first slap|`|FoIxsunVaa	Six weeks after birth.|`|XxDQGEalaa	The second it's counted by census as a lifeform...has a name...and is an autonomous being.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	There in no human life without conscious mind.

The departing life of such a living thing possesses neither identity nor personality; it does not individually survive death. During its existence and the time of its sojourn in the body of matter, it has undergone a change; it has undergone energy evolution and survives only as a part of the cosmic forces of the universe; it does not survive as individual life.

vsGtzWR8aa	Sometimes the definitions of 'weird' and 'normal' can be very blurry!

Books like "Ninevah" or like "lost Civilizations" that tell you what was found and what conclusions and theories derrived from the digs and then I like to let my brain wander and ponder the meaning of the artifacts also.  The best archeological books present as yet unsolved mysteries.  Wierd to me in a similar vein would be something like Chariots of the Gods.  I know most people think Von Daniken is a moron after he wrote that, but he is a very wise archeologist so I draw a different conclusion for the non-sense in that book.  I believe he knew that sort of theory would sell big and archeology isn't noted generally to pay very much, so he prostituted his name and rep to write that book and then he laughed all the way to the bank-that is my theory and I believe it is correct (my theory).

5VqxkMFuaa	The Vichy government did not surrender to Germany. France's government, based in Paris, surrendered after major military defeats in the early days of the German offensive. You can research this part on the internet, and you will find an explanation of why France surrendered. As part of the conditions imposed by Germany, France was split into two parts. One part, which included Paris, was directly occupied by the Germans; the other part was controlled by a collaborationist puppet government based in Vichy, and presided by Marshall Petain..

OhWmu0R3aa	The wigs worn by the legal profession saw their first appearance during the reign of Charles II (1660 - 1685). Charles had been restored to the throne after the death of Oliver Cromwell and England's 11 year flirt with republicanism. He brought with him the some of the fashions of the French court of Louis XIV where he had been staying; one of which was the use of large wigs, known as "perriwigs".<br>  <br>  Up to this point barristers and judges had been using the same type of headgear and clothing since the middle ages which was was the coif, (a piece of white linen which seems originally to have been designed to cover the tonsure of monks who were acting in a legal capacity) on top of which was placed black skullcap with the white edges of the coif showing around the edges. But because the new perriwig became the "must have" item of clothing for the wealthy and fashionable, it became a symbol of status and was therefore not removed by those in court. The coif and skullcup was dropped by barristers with judges having them sewn onto some of the wigs they wore before abandoning them as well by the early 1700's.<br>  <br>  Basically, judges and barristers began wearing wigs (and robes) because everyone in polite society was wearing them. The adoption of the black robe for barristers arose due to the death of Charles II and was a mark of mourning; and their modern smaller wig came about because the large perriwig dropped from fashion during the reign of George III (1760 - 1820). Judges kept theirs (the powdered white version, which had risen in popularity over the "hair-coloured" version some years before) so to seperate themselves from the barristers. It wasn't really until the 1800's that the wig was considered a particularly legal headgear. <br>  <br>  They are still required to be worn in Crown Court cases and they are quite expensive (roughly ￡1,000) but are bought by the barrister and not supplied by the taxpayer.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	It depends on the type of court. In Scotland senior judges and lawyers in the High court etc. still wear them but in district courts where minor offences are dealt with it is more informal and wigs aren't worn. It's just a historical tradition and the British legal system sticks rigidly to formality and protocol in senior courts.|`|2pYNOD60aa	just found a website that tells you all about it in detail here is the link|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	It helps prevent lice which were a problem.

In 1435 Pope Eugene IV promulgated the papal bull Sicut Dudum condemned the slavery of black natives in Canary Islands by Spanish. In 1462 Pope Pius II declared slavery to be "a great crime" (magnum scelus). In 1537, Pope Paul III forbade the enslavement of the Indians and other people with the papal bull Sublimus Dei, while Pope Urban VIII forbade it in 1639, and Pope Benedict XIV in 1741. Pope Pius VII in 1815 demanded that the Congress of Vienna suppress the slave trade, and Pope Gregory XVI condemned it in 1839. In the Bull of Canonization of the St. Peter Claver, Pope Pius IX branded the "supreme villainy" (summum nefas) of the slave traders. Pope Leo XIII, in 1888, addressed an encyclical to the Brazilian bishops, In Plurimism [10] (On the Abolition of Slavery), exhorting them to banish the remnants of slavery from their country. Jesus in Luke said he had come to end slavery (see also "Slavery in the Bible" above):|`|xj0lVyPraa	You can't.  Slavery is mentioned in both the old and new testaments as a legitimate practice.|`|SsB7aRExaa	The slavery that was practiced in the last 300 years or so was very different from the slavery in Biblical times, both in the old and new testaments.  The slavery of Old Testament times (as practiced in Israel) was more like the indentured servitude that was common in colonial times.  The slavery in the New Testament was practiced by the pagan societies of Rome and Greece, and though less 'free' than the slavery practiced in the Old Testament, it was still FAR gentler and kinder than what was perpetrated against the Africans in the last 3 or 4 hundred years.<br>  <br>  Slavery is never explicitly condemned OR condoned in the Bible.  It simply is there.  In ancient Israel, it was carefully regulated so as to be humane.<br>  <br>  There is certainly a LOT in the Bible that explicitly and implicitly condemns the kind of slavery that we had in the United States prior to the civil war.  It was brutal and inhuman, and cannot be justified.  It's true that there were hypocrites who did so, but they did so by twisting the words of the Bible, instead of obeying them.<br>  <br>  By the way, when you say, "religion", I've assumed you mean Christianity, because of the time frame you mentioned.  However, you should be more careful to say what you mean.  There are religions that DO justify slavery.  <br>  <br>  Islam, for example, is very much in favor of slavery.  In fact, the African slave trade was originally carried on almost exclusively by Muslims.<br>  <br>  Of course, the dirty little secret of the African slave trade is that it was STARTED by Africans.|`|4eb65c12497840f599500825222da691aa	Many things have been justified over the course of history.<br>  This alone does not make them right nor wrong.<br>  SLavery was tolerated much the same as multiple wives were.<br>  Neither one works very well for the parties involved.<br>  <br>  God placed rules in effect if someone allowed others to sell themselves into slavery (bond servent) and also for those who were bought and sold into  slavery.  (yes, there were multiple levels of slavery)<br>  God does not put in our Mosaic law that one must take slaves nor become slaves, take multiple wives or become a multiple wife.<br>  <br>  It is a cultural thing, and if done, there are rules in place of how to treat one another.

It also involves flashbacks so it can be a bit confusing.<br>  <br>  It starts out with the story of a new tenant of Heathcliff's who has had a bad night at the Heights and asks the housekeeper of the house he is leasing to tell him the story of Heathcliff and his family. The housekeeper does so and most of the book is in her words. <br>  <br>  It doesn't take long for the narrative style to make sense.

There's only one Heathcliff.<br>  <br>  Technically, there are two narrators. There's Lockwood, who is renting Thrushcross Grange.  He's telling us the story about how he went to pay a visit to his landlord (Heathcliff) at his home, Wuthering Heights.  He meets these strange people there, and is very curious about them, so he asks the housekeeper, Nelly, about them.  Nelly then tells Lockwood the story of the people he met...their history. <br>   She's known Heathcliff, and the Earnshaw and Linton families, since they were all children together.  She tells the story it to Lockwood, who then writes it down for us.
kTNz1VJuaa	There certainly has been some progress but in many cases the prejudice has just become more subtle - better hidden; being expressed in more clever ways. Did you know that if you're more intelligent than G.W.Bush then you're an "elitist"?<br>  <br>  Yes, we may have a "black" President but the white supremacists are definitely stirring. You might not have heard about all the assassination plots that have been broken up. The corporate mainstream media are quiet about them. Do a google search for "aryan nation"  or "white power" but take your anti-depressant medication first.<br>  <br>  Lets not forget that women are also taking more leadership roles than they used to, but that's just for a few. Most American women are not really better off then they were 100 years ago.  The noise being made by the "pro-life" fanatics is one example. Did you know that Condaleeza Rice got where she is through affirmative action? Did you know that she then made a statement that affirmative action is "obsolete"?<br>  <br>  In other ways other things are not really improved at all. Certainly, class is a more important issue than race. Those handful of very rich people won't want blacks & whites to cooperate. And if you speak up for the rights of the working class you'll be called a "commie". In this sense, things have gotten worse during my lifetime. Labor unions used to be able to denounce elitist policies in the gov't but today unions are weak and the elitists are using the word "elite" to describe realists.<br>  <br>  100 years ago Teddy Roosevelt crushed the big fascist corporate monopolies but today he would never get into office for having an agenda of "trust-busting". <br>  <br>  Did you hear that ATT's cable service recently started policies that discriminate against public broadcasting, public access channels and educational channels? It takes several minutes of sorting thru cable-box options to see PBS and students can't tape or tivo their college's on-air-classrooms.|`|UDEMDcGuaa	Racially it has made progress: although slavery ended with the civil war in 1865 there was still the jim crow laws in the south and overall racism through-out the country was tacitly (and often openly) approved of.

He was actually answering why do Europeans have more cargo or riches but it works there as well.|`|76TnLrkjaa	The explanation for the change in this relationship during the nineteenth century remains complex. Initial explanations for the development of nineteenth-century imperialism located the causes as lying within Europe and focused in particular on economic factors. Such a view, derived ultimately from J.A. Hobson's seminal Imperialism: A Study, and which was taken up by Lenin and Marxist writers, saw imperialism as driven by the exploitation of the economic resources of the wider world, with financiers pressing governments to annex colonies in order to protect their overseas investments. However, because of the limited returns from imperial conquest in this period and because colonial expansion did not, in practice, follow overseas investments, this view has been criticized. Alternative explanations have emphasized the importance of chauvinist ideas in the origins of European expansion, stressing how deep-rooted militaristic values in nineteenth century European society, alongside racist and nationalist theories, and reinforced in turn by ideas of social Darwinism and of Europe's "civilizing mission" overseas, led to the assumption that colonies were essential for national prestige.<br>  <br>  However, historians are skeptical of interpretations that locate imperialism's origins solely within Europe. Such views, it is argued, erroneously see Africans and Asians as passive ciphers in a process that ought to be seen as involving a shifting relationship of power between Europe and the wider world. The historians writing in the 1950s and 1960s as the societies of Africa and Asia threw off European rule acquired an awareness of the role played by developments in what was termed "the periphery"—that is, areas on the frontiers of existing European territories overseas. The most influential of such historians were Ronald Robinson and Jack Gallagher. Their work stressed how Britain's expansion was driven by strategic imperatives in the defense of the route to the Indian empire, and the threats to it that developed within Africa and Asia in the 1870s and 1880s. Robinson and Gallagher emphasized the variety of methods—including gunboat diplomacy and "influence" as much as formal annexation—Britain used to defend these interests, these varying according to the relationship Britain was able to negotiate with those Africans and Asians living on "the periphery."<br>  <br>  Certainly any explanation of European expansion has to include developments outside Europe as well as factors within it, and has to be located in the existing, and already growing, overseas interests of the European powers—primarily Britain and France—in the mid-nineteenth century. Important in this was the corrosive impact of an industrializing West on societies in Africa and Asia, and the problems this impact—economic, social, cultural, and technological—generated within these societies and in relations with Europeans. What transformed this process into the large-scale conquest of Africa and Asia was Germany's intervention overseas in 1883–1885. For the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck (1815–1898), colonial expansion was relatively cheap and was popular within Germany, but most significantly, it brought with it major diplomatic gains for Germany's position in Europe. By threatening the existing possessions of Britain and France, German colonial expansion showed the importance of German diplomatic friendship. The ensuing furor not only diverted the danger of diplomatic isolation for Germany but also ensured that Britain and France had to expand in order to defend their overseas interests.
G3dLnTNTaa	I would start with a high quality acrylic that mixes well. Acrylics dry fast and allow you to fix mistakes quickly. They are also relatively inexpensive compared to other paints. Sketchbook paper can be rather useless, you can find some specific paper for paint that comes in a pad that is rather inexpensive. Good luck. And for inspiration, " Every artist was first an amateur." --Emerson|`|Uu9a1TtOaa	I think you're going to need something other than sketchbook paper or you're not going to be happy with the result. It's sometimes as much about where the paint goes as the paint itself. Canvas is the obvious choice, but you can also use plywood (or wood of any type) as well as canvas board, available at any arts or arts and crafts store.<br>  <br>  Acrylic is a good paint to start with. It's versatile -- you can thin it with water to make it almost like watercolor; you can add medium to make it thicker; it's easy to clean and it dries quickly.<br>  <br>  I also recommend investing in a decent brush or two.

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	First, you need to realize that you will probably not be able to develop color film yourself at home.  Black and white film is very easy to develop, but color film is a lot harder because you need more chemicals and you have to be a lot more careful with the temperature and the development time.  But black and white photographs can be amazing, and developing your own film is actually a lot of fun.  There are a lot of creative things you can do with film.<br>  <br>  Shoshanna gave a good answer, except that you CANNOT use a safelight when you develop film!  You have to develop film in total darkness.  Actually, developing the film and developing the pictures are two separate steps.  You have to develop the film first, and then you will use the negatives to develop the pictures in a darkroom.<br>  <br>  Photo paper is not sensitive to red light, so you can use a red light or what's called a "safelight" in your darkroom.  After you develop your film (and it's completely dry), you will use the negatives and an enlarger to develop the pictures.  You put the negative on a tray on the enlarger, called the "negative carrier."  The enlarger has a lamp and a lens to project the image from the negative onto photo paper.  Photo paper is light sensitive, so after you expose it, you will develop it with chemicals, kind of like film.  Except that photo paper is not sensitive to red light, so you CAN have a safelight in your darkroom so that you can see what you're doing.<br>  <br>  Developing black and white film and pictures is really not that hard to do.  There are several steps, but it's not that hard.<br>  <br>  To develop the film, you don't even really need a darkroom.  You can use what's called a "changing bag" which is a lightproof zippered bag with holes for your arms.  You have to load the film onto a reel and put it in a small tank.  You have to do that in total darkness, so that's what the changing bag is for.  Once you load the film on the reel and put it in the tank, you can do the rest in normal light.<br>  <br>  To develop black and white film, you basically need 2 chemicals, called the "developer" and the "fixer."<br>  <br>  I don't really want to describe the entire process for developing film here.  But if you are seriously interested in learning, email me and I will be glad to help.|`|HlQCmCG0aa	Google 'photography darkroom set-up'.<br>  Sorry, my fingers are tired and setting up a darkroom is not really hard, but it is a bit involved.

ZpXFulyCaa	Hi, Belle.  Try a semi-alphabetical list of topics that interest you.  Like this:<br>  <br>  adoption, bulimia, danger, eavesdropping, fun, Germany, house-sitting, independence, jail, Kenya, love, marriage, nomads, roaches...whatever...<br>  <br>  Pull 3 items from your own alphabetical list and allow them to exist together in one story.<br>  <br>  Also, try using your dictionary as a writing prompt generator.  For example, you could pull one word each from pages 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, etc.  Or you could pull a word from all the palindromic pages like (111, 121, 131, 141, 151, etc.)  Eventually, you'll have a list that you can go back through and pull out the words that you can feel forming a story.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes in your writing.  You'll get it.|`|48c930ebdc8dc579c849fcf4023c3659aa	Good authors think of their own ideas.|`|5wg7tKc6aa	You're an author when you've created your own work.

cvTzLEoBaa	She was born before the 'fight'.<br>  <br>  If she was born after the fight, there would have been no point to the fight if you get what I'm saying.<br>  <br>  That whole fight was about her.  Being an 'immortal child.'<br>  So no Renesmee, no fight.<br>  <br>  She was definitely born before.|`|Q5cEmhDEaa	Before. <br>  Irina came to reconcile with the Cullens but saw Renesmee with Bella and Jacob and assumed she was an immortal child. Then Alice had her vision and saw that the Volturi were coming after them (but they didnt know why). Bella was the one who guessed that Irina went to the Volturi, and that they were coming to kill the supposed 'immortal child'. That's when they started recruiting witnesses.|`|iG6ksSpHaa	They got the people together after Renesmee's birth, they only got everyone together so to protect Renesemee.|`|72f8383682f5901d7fa7a2dd3b0ab02daa	No they planned to gather all the vampires after she was born and after Alice had the vision that they were coming.

Thats why Alice and Jasper leave...|`|PnzNcKoeaa	Before remember because the only reason the volturi knew about renesmee was because the girl who was Laurents mate was the one who told them and they never REALLY had a problem with the volturi before that|`|15zvgLkzaa	Before.<br>  The only reason they needed people to help them was because Irina saw Renesmee and Jacob hunting.|`|fpuHVNYgaa	Renesmee was born before the problem with the Volturi.|`|nL8s4ozIaa	after. cuz the alaskan vampire went to volturi after she saw renessme|`|SGrd8ubpaa	it started before. i am the total twilight saga fan. :)

KHSOVxViaa	Not really.<br>  <br>  The fact that there was a blockade showed that Stalin wanted to gain West Berlin without starting a war.  He thought that this show of strength would make the western allies abandon the city.<br>  <br>  Equally, the west responded by arranging the massive airlift, an equally non-war method.  This showed Stalin that the west was serious about supporting West Berlin, so eventually Stalin backed down.<br>  <br>  It would have been rather unlikely to lead to war.|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	Yes it did.  The Soviets violated the treaty after the war that gave the non Russian allies West Berlin.  That forced the US to start a massive airlift and that ratcheted up the tensions considerably.  If the Soviets shot down a cargo plane that went off course, that could have escalated.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	If the East Germans and Russians would not let food or other supplies into landlocked West Berlin (Totally surrounded by East Germany) there would have been war, because American troops, British and French were in West Berlin, and Russians in the East. Germany was still suffering from war time shortages even though the war had been over for 3 years. There was little extra food and most of it was running out. <br>  <br>  I don't know all the details about the Berlin blockade in 1948, but in the summer of 1961, there was again problem with East Germany, and East Berlin. As many East Berliners as could were going into west Berlin. There was a lot of tension between the US and the Soviet Union. In August 1961, the Berlin Wall was built by the East Germans and Russians to keep the East Berliners from fleeing from East Berlin. <br>  <br>  There was really no time from the end of the war until November 9, 1989 when the wall came down that there was not tension over Berlin between the US and the Soviet Union.|`|uJkbhytsaa	Made the Cold War more likely to happen, the lack of trust within the US and USSR grew from there.<br>  <br>  You must know that the US had secret planes flying food and raw materials into the country!

Although, i think myb her genre is more pop than country...|`|wWblBMKsaa	You can get it at Target for between $13 and $15 I think. I got it the day it came out for $10!!! It is DEFINITELY WORTH IT!!

AA10015648	It shouldn't cost you too much money to search for a publisher. Unless you're looking for self-publishers, who make money off people who just want to say "I have a book on sale at Amazon!" which isn't a real publishing job at all.<br>  <br>  Go to your library or book store and find Writers Market 2009. In there you will find thousands of publishers and descriptions of the type of stories they look for. You'll want to find publishers who are accepting unsolicited novels... that means they accept novels from people without agents.<br>  <br>  You should make a one page letter that you send to SEVERAL publishers (not just one). Basically tell them your name, the basic plot of your story, the length and genre of the story, and your past experience with writing. At the end, you ask if they would be interested in the first chapter of your manuscript.<br>  <br>  If you're really lucky, one of them will ask to read your first chapter. If they like it, then they may ask to read the whole thing, then buy it from you for a few thousand dollars. More likely, you'll get a rejection letter. It happens... it's part of being a writer.<br>  <br>  Their job is to find something that will sell, not just something that's cute or "not bad" - it needs to be a story worth thousands and thousands of dollars to edit, print and distribute, so they only take really, really good stories from new writers.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Do some searching for previous answers on Yahoo! Answers, and you'll find a LOT of resources, like how to write the 1 page letter, how to format your manuscript, and how to deal with rejection.|`|XxtVwslraa	I don't know anything about online publishing but if you want to go the traditional route then you're going to need to find an agent first.

Although her sister, Bellatrix Lestrange, distrusts Snape, he agrees to protect Draco during his task assigned by the Dark Lord, and complete the mission should Draco fail.<br>  <br>  During the summer, Albus Dumbledore enlists Harry Potter's unwitting help to persuade retired professor Horace Slughorn to return to his old Hogwarts post. When Albus Dumbledore comes to collect Harry, an unsuspecting Harry is told that he has inherited all of Sirius Black's (his deceased godfather) possessions, including the house, Buckbeak, and his house-elf, Kreacher. Harry then spends the remaining holiday at The Burrow with the Weasleys and Hermione. To his family's dismay (especially Mrs Weasley and Ginny), Bill Weasley has become engaged to Fleur Delacour, the Beauxbatons champion in the Triwizard Tournament. Harry, Ron, and Hermione receive their O.W.L. results. Hermione receives top "Outstanding" marks in all her subjects with the exception of Defence Against the Dark Arts. To become Aurors, Harry and Ron must take N.E.W.T.-Level Potions as a prerequisite, but their grades in the subject are too low for Snape's advanced class, thus ending their career ambitions. However, Harry is very pleased (and secretly smug) to discover that he was the only one out of the three of them to get an "Outstanding" in Defence Against the Dark Arts. While in Diagon Alley, Harry, Ron and Hermione have an encounter with Draco Malfoy and his mother Narcissa in Madam Malkin's robe shop. Harry and Ron nearly start a duel with Draco, but Narcissa defuses the situtation by leaving with her son. Later, from Fred and George's joke shop, Harry, Ron and Hermione spot Draco, who had apparently given his mother the slip, and follow him. At Borgin & Burkes, a dark magic shop in Knockturn Alley, Draco threatens Mr Borgin about repairing one item and keeping another safe. Hermione goes in after to try to find out what he was reserving. Suspecting Draco may have replaced his imprisoned father as a Death Eater, Harry resolves to keep a close watch on him.<br>  <br>  As school begins, Snape is unexpectedly announced as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts instructor while Slughorn replaces him as the Potions teacher. Slughorn only requires a minimum "E" grade (Exceeds Expectations) at O.W.L. to take his N.E.W.T.-level Potion classes, making Harry and Ron eligible for the class. On the first day of class, Slughorn lends them old Potions textbooks and potions ingredients to use. The previous owner of Harry's copy of Advanced Potion Making has scribbled notes all over the pages, making corrections on Libatius Borage's methods and making little annotations in the margins. Initially annoyed at the previous owner, Harry changes his mind when he discovers that the unknown owner's corrections yield better results than Libatius Borage's instructions. As a result, he is able to excel at the potion Slughorn has set them. As a reward for his success, Slughorn gives Harry a small bottle of Felix Felicis, a good-luck potion.<br>  <br>  Ominous Death Eater attacks continue throughout the year. On the first Hogsmeade visit, Katie Bell, a Gryffindor student, is seriously injured while carrying a cursed necklace through Hogsmeade, apparently while under the Imperius Curse. In another incident, Ron accidentally drinks poisoned mead intended for Dumbledore. Harry reacts by administering the Bezoar he had submitted previously as an assignment to Slughorn. Hermione is so distraught over this that she and Ron, who were feuding mostly over Ron dating Lavender Brown and Hermione's relationship with Viktor Krum, reconcile; Ron soon breaks it off with Lavender. Meanwhile, Harry realises that he has feelings for Ginny, although she is now dating Dean Thomas.<br>  <br>  Dumbledore privately tutors Harry using his Pensieve to view collected memories about Voldemort's past. Dumbledore speculates that Voldemort splintered his soul into six fragments called Horcruxes to attain immortality, while leaving a seventh piece in his body. Two Horcruxes have been destroyed (Tom Riddle's diary by Harry[HP2] and Marvolo Gaunt's ring by Dumbledore).<br>  <br>  When Harry finds Draco crying in a boys bathroom on the sixth floor, accompanied by Moaning Myrtle, they hurl curses at each other. Harry casts "Sectumsempra" inflicting huge gashes across Draco's body. Snape arrive|`|JtxT2qZbaa	A few ***SPOILERS***<br>  <br>  ---Harry falls in love with Ron's sister, Ginny.

Then the rubber mold is pulled off the clay and after drying to allow strength to build, plaster is mixed and poured in to make a copy of the original. <br>   Examples here.<br>   <a href="http://users.ticnet.com/mikefirth/neckmold.htm#ZIPPER" rel="nofollow">http://users.ticnet.com/mikefirth/neckmo...</a> and scroll up one screen and down one.<br>   and here showing painting on.<br>  <a href="http://users.ticnet.com/mikefirth/castgobl.htm#HEADMOLD" rel="nofollow">http://users.ticnet.com/mikefirth/castgo...</a>

I don't even really like love stories. So it's just not the book for me. But my older sister and best friend both really enjoyed the book (along with the rest of the world, it seems) and I don't have a problem with it. I just personally didn't like the book.

AA10024451	A combination of factors led to the Titanic's striking the iceberg and sinking. <br>  <br>  (1) Certain very important ice warnings received by the ship's telegraph operators never made it to the Captain. <br>  <br>  (2) The Captain kept the ship going at its highest speed even though they were passing through a section of ocean known specifically for the passage of icebergs. <br>  <br>  (3) The lookouts in the crow's nest did not have their binoculars which would have aided them by letting them see the iceberg much sooner at from a further distance away. They didn't see the iceberg until they were nearly on top of it, with very little room to turn the ship because of the ship's speed and it's undersized rudder. <br>  <br>  (4) When the ship struck the iceberg, the poor-quality rivets and plates used to put her together buckled and broke, allowing the sea to pour right into the ship. In addition, the ship's watertight bulkheads were not sufficiently high enough to prevent the water from going from one compartment to the next.......which led to water filling the first 5 compartments, which ultimately doomed the ship. <br>  <br>  (5) Eventually, the ship kept filling with water, dropping the bow section into the sea and the stern section kept rising higher in the air until eventually the ship broke in two between the 3rd and 4th funnels. The bow continued down towards the ocean floor while the stern bobbed straight up in the air for 2-3 minutes, eventually flooded, and sank, following the bow to the bottom.|`|KTNqah9eaa	Careless navigation ensured it hit an iceberg which punctured the ship below the waterline so letting in so much water that it sank.|`|7uGMyGn2aa	Well although it was a terrible accident - the titanic was doomed to sink. It was built with poor quality rivets which meant the iron ship was held together badly especially on the curves of the ship. therefore it was inevitably doomed.<br>  However on april 14th 1912 the ship hit an iceburg. The ships hull was divided up into different sections which had watertight doors. These were all closed but the iceburg had ruptured 5 compartments - if only 4 had been ruptured then the titanic wud have stayed afloat. However the weight of 5 compartments filled pulled the bow down so the water flowed over the top of the watertight doors thereofre sinking it. It filled at the bow, with the weight lifting the stern clear out of the water (20,000 - 30,000 tons of stern) which obv it cud not hold so it split in half. The bow went down to the depths, the stern half rose up vertical then slowly filled with water than sank. :(|`|gb9REJN4aa	The Titanic was divided up into lots of separate chambers. It was supposed to be that even if one of them filled up with water, the others would be sealed off from it so the boat would not go down. But the iceberg was too big and tore a hole in a large number of them, which sunk the thing.<br>  <br>  The best demo of this I've ever seen is to take an ice-cube maker (one of those plastic things with 12 boxes in it that you fill with water to freeze and make ice cubes). If you put it on the top of water in a bathtub, it'll float. If you fill just one cube with water, it'll still float. That's what the Titanic was meant to do. But if you fill three or four or five ice cubes worth of water, then the whole thing will go down. The iceberg was big enough that a huge proportion of the ship was flooded, and as a consequence, the whole thing went down.|`|yvyewZrWaa	Jack and Rose set it off-kilter when they did their "king of the world" routine.

The capitan was trying to set a speed-record for the crossing, and was going way too fast in waters where icebergs were known to be.  When the berg was sighted, there was not enough time to avoid it. <br>  <br>  Also, the 'Wireless' radio was a brand-new concept, and the 2 operators on-board were not part of the crew, but were employees of the Marconi Company, and their only function was to relay messages to and from passengers to/from shore stations, sort of like a wireless telegraph. They received many warnings of icebergs ahead from several ships, but the operators had no orders to relay that information to the bridge, so the messages were ignored.|`|or0SzIoLaa	It was foggy they ran into this massive iceberg, which Put a massive hole in the side of the boat...

YorMkZYAaa	I believe it is both.<br>  <br>  Some people are born with a knack of writing well and knowing how to craft words better than the average person. But it isn't just stories. People often assume writing = stories and fail to realize there are amazing writers when it comes to copywriting, business writing, journalism, technical writing, etc. Some writers are strictly creative writers, others swing both ways so to speak.<br>  <br>  You can teach a so-so writer to write better. You can teach a good or even great writer how to hone their skills and where to apply them. I don't think you can teach someone who can't grasp the basic fundamentals of writing to be a good writer. It takes some level of talent as well as skill and ability to train and be trained.<br>  <br>  Good writers become better writers with practice. I know for myself that even as a successful, professional writer if I don't practice regularly my writing becomes dull and bland. I have to practice in some medium on a daily basis or else I lose some of my training. Reading helps a lot too.<br>  <br>  As with any talent it takes practice. No writer comes out of the womb knowing how to write an exceptional piece of work. But if they have the skill there and have a natural knack for it, it can be developed further.|`|w7USF5wDaa	I think a certain amount of it is inborn, but having a gift for language or storytelling won't get you very far unless you work hard at the craft.  I've seen plenty of people who had a gift but then didn't make anything of it because they thought they didn't need to put in the work.  They would eventually give up writing when they got out of school because they weren't getting praised by teachers anymore and didn't want to hear any of the criticism that it takes to improve your work.  On the other hand I've also known people who were merely competent who put in the work and became pretty good.<br>  <br>  In the end I think it mostly boils down to hard work and passion.  Talent probably determines about 20% of how good of a writer someone can become, the rest is up to them.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|GW2i2qqUaa	Great Writers cannot be formed. There is no compromise with this. Thank you!! Thank you for asking this!! Rainier Maria Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet is all about this question. It is a gorgeous read and could be read in one seating. We are either born to write or we are not. We must ask ourselves if we must write and if any part of us meets this question with resistance we must then come to terms with that we are not to be writers.|`|AA10015648	I think that you can make a decent writer into a good or great writer.<br>  <br>  But I don't think you can't turn a bad writer into a good one.<br>  <br>  It's like someone with bad balance trying to do ballet... you can teach the moves and they can do okay, technically, but there's an art to it that can't be created.<br>  <br>  Honestly... if a bad writer wants to be a writer THAT badly - they probably just haven't found their true calling. They might want to be a storyteller, and might be destined for illustrating or directing or music composition. They might think that writing is the only way to tell a story, but there are so many more ways to tell a story than through words.|`|LVDoQ1Kaaa	well people do have the talent of writing but there talent is good when they learn and it's just more easy for them to understand its inborn but you can still be better than born Talent writers if you practice and learn new techniques

EfdPasVqaa	Leon Trotsky (November 7, [O.S. October 26] 1879 – August 21, 1940), born Lev Davidovich Bronstein was a Bolshevik revolutionary and Marxist theorist. He was one of the leaders of the Russian October Revolution, second only to Lenin. During the early days of the Soviet Union, he served first as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and later as the founder and commander of the Red Army and People's Commissar of War. He was also among the first members of the Politburo.<br>  <br>  After leading a failed struggle of the Left Opposition against the policies and rise of Joseph Stalin in the 1920s and the increasing role of bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, Trotsky was expelled from the Communist Party and deported from the Soviet Union. As the head of the Fourth International, he continued in exile to oppose the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, and was eventually assassinated in Mexico by Ramón Mercader, a Soviet agent. Trotsky's ideas form the basis of Trotskyism, a term coined as early as 1905 by his opponents in order to separate it from Marxism. Trotsky’s ideas remain a major school of Marxist thought that is opposed to the theories of Stalinism.<br>  <br>  He was one of the few Soviet political figures who was never rehabilitated by the Soviet administration|`|KTNqah9eaa	Trotsky was a lieutenant of Lenin at the start of the Revolution holding several important positions during Lenin's lifetime. When Lenin was succeeded by Stalin, Trotsky became more isolated in a personal power struggle. He eventually left the Soviet Union to live in Mexico where he was assassinated.
Sz3nMAcaaa	wow, it sounds great, but it doesn't sound like a kid book to me ( like I can't imagine a 8 year old understanding the plot) . More like a teenager or adult book. But I would read it! =)<br>   hope i helped and good luck with your book!|`|RvzPVV98aa	Don't report me, but I'm ten years old, I for one like the overall plot, except for the whole concept of Magical Creature's racing as an individual subject; try to mould a world of magic and folklore around the racing, that would make it vastly more believable.<br>  E.g.: You wouldn't write a book about horse-racing and have no other main factor within the book.|`|LVDoQ1Kaaa	it's good but a little too much detail and thats what a girl would do with the picture and locket plus he is 5 and probably wouldn't understand or remember that|`|FvYqKZSMaa	It sounds good.
wLOXyEVGaa	Well, since you're asking this in Books and Authors you're going to get a lot of answers that say writers. :) I say both!<br>  <br>  Artists - I mean come on, don't you wish you could draw like that. They have an amazing eye for color and detail that you wouldn't think possible. They can create an image in your head by drawing it out on paper. it's beautiful and wonderful to look at. You can spend hours marveling at it. They have the ability to brighten your mood.<br>  <br>  Writers - I have a lot of respect for writers. They can create their own world where everything makes sense and has a reason behind it. They create vivid descriptions that make you feel that you are actually there, partaking in the events occurring in the book. I always wonder how writers can  think up such a world ( for example, JK Rowling is an author I have a lot of respect for) Books can be a great escape.<br>  <br>  All in all there are pros and cons of both writers and artists. I think they both have extreme talent!|`|8lsBBK62aa	Great writers are artists.|`|d267fab7a0b268922f3228351f52baf1aa	I myself am a writer but I always wished I could be an artist.  Instead of having to use a page of words to describe what I see in my head I'd be able to draw the exact image.  It wouldn't be left open to the interpretation of the reader so to speak.  It would be a house or a man or a horse or a doll.  I wouldn't do that a splotch on a page type art either, I would do actual pictures of things.  And the way I tell stories with my writing I would put all of that feeling into a visual canvas with colors and details and passionate and freedom.|`|yJdhhzypaa	Writers are artists. I'm guessing you mean painter, etc. They're both equal yet different, and very important to me.|`|IxuMTGd4aa	Both.<br>  <br>  And without them, we wouldn't have a detailed picture in the book, either.|`|YorMkZYAaa	Good writers ARE artists in their own way.|`|TKZAYJokaa	can one exist without the other??|`|xVNKSaGHaa	I don't think either is better than the other. They are two different art forms. Artists/ art work do not have to tell a story, that is what a writer does, the same as a writer does not need to use colour in its novel.<br>  <br>  Art and Literature share movements, eg. renaissance, romanticism etc. they are both as expressive and emotive but use different mediums. In mu opinion both good art and good writing are equally effective.|`|6ckzLUanaa	Both are amazing in their own way. One of the major parts of being human is telling stories, so authors are incredible. Artists express the soul in color and form, something also so uniquely human. They inspire each other, and I believe that both represent the better aspects of humanity.|`|GW2i2qqUaa	Whoever wrote Twilight, NOT an artist. <br>  Writing is considered by many a visual art. <br>  Art for art's sake. I think there is no better way. I write and accumulate all year and only in September and April do I submit anything. I can keep it real that way.|`|1a0cdf84b10327b2e35d799092f75617aa	technically in a way writers are artists. i mean what we write are our way of expressing ourselves. the same way a painter expresses themselves through their pictures.|`|57695d6cd2bdf46926c92c61db0be293aa	i would of classed writers and artists as husband and wife if i was to try and explain the relationship between....|`|kqQW30NQaa	writers i like a good book xx

Bella has a special power that is called a shield. She can block all mental attacks without even trying. Before the war with the Volturi she learns how to use it. She learns to push it out and extend it over many people. She also is tought how to push it out of herself and then Edward can read her mind and Jane can attack her. But if she doesn't push it out of herself then she is protected in her mind.|`|or0SzIoLaa	Read Breaking Dawn it explains it....<br>  <br>  Bellas power is A shield...She can block other peoples power... She cant block out Alice and Jasper's becuase they are mental powers... That is why edaward cant read her mind... she is shielding him out.|`|pEDavW3caa	well bella likes to keep to herself and stephenie meyer wrote it that way. anyway in breaking dawn it says that that was part of her powers. sorry if i spoiled anything.|`|pDd5jRxEaa	Emotional block.|`|cSrxQHIhaa	if you have read the fourth book you should so know this x]<br>  <br>  she has a shield in her mind, bloking him out without realising it. it becomes her power. also, he cant read charlies thoughts too clearly either so it must be something to do with that ..<br>  ah how crazy<br>  xxxx|`|xwWZu5SZaa	i think it had somthing to do with her knowledge and understanding of the existence of vampires. keep in mind he isnt the only one who's powers dont work on Bella! remember the volturi, they cant either.|`|ZxipP7Bzaa	She has a sheild (said in the last book) as her power for a vampire.

RVy0yKgHaa	“The Road Not Taken” means to not always take the “easy way” or the short cut. If you take a chance, taking the hard way will work out better in the long run. <br>  <br>  PS- and its by Robert Frost. Jack Frost is the guy that makes winter cold.lol|`|EzcQOTPtaa	Whether it was a good or bad ending is left out on purpose. The point is that one decision (to go to college or not, marry or not) can effect the rest of your life. Just as in life nobody can know what would have hap pended if they made a different decision at a critical point.|`|NQbtQwOUaa	the whole poem is about choices, hard or easy, what your life is depends on the choices you have made.|`|DvToP5h7aa	"The Road Not Taken"<br>  <br>  Summary <br>   <br>  The speaker stands in the woods, considering a fork in the road. Both ways are equally worn and equally overlaid with un-trodden leaves. The speaker chooses one, telling himself that he will take the other another day. Yet he knows it is unlikely that he will have the opportunity to do so. And he admits that someday in the future he will recreate the scene with a slight twist: He will claim that he took the less-traveled road. <br>  <br>   <br>  Form <br>   <br>  "The Road Not Taken" consists of four stanzas of five lines. The rhyme scheme is ABAAB; the rhymes are strict and masculine, with the notable exception of the last line (we do not usually stress the -ence of difference). There are four stressed syllables per line, varying on an iambic tetrameter base. <br>   <br>  Full Poem Analysis:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/frost/section7.rhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/frost/s...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://poetrypages.lemon8.nl/life/roadnottaken/roadnottaken.htm" rel="nofollow">http://poetrypages.lemon8.nl/life/roadno...</a>|`|jjOw5OHeaa	This is an interesting, tricky poem. After close reading you will see that the first two lines in the last stanza basically say that, Years and years from now I will look back on this choice and sigh (Not stated whether good or bad). When he will look back and say that it has made all the difference, he is not saying good or bad, by that this choice, like many others, made a big difference in his life one day down the road.

Xq1WloWXaa	It was chosen based on its location. At the time, the south was unsure about a centralized government, and having a capitol in the North made things worse. So it was finally decided, with much debate, that the centralized location (at that time) of Washing DC would be the best location.|`|KTNqah9eaa	Because its position enabled the Government to be free of competing regional interests at the time. If New York or, say, Philadelphia had been chosen influential sections of the community would have been antagonised by the apparent favouritism.

7xestOKUaa	I'm pretty he still would have.<br>  Because he wasn't only interested in her blood, he was also interested in her because she was a complete mystery. He was so used to knowing what someone was like just by hearing their thoughts, and since Bella was the only person he couldn't read, it bothered him. He had to do a little searching, which turned into a lot of searching, and he obviously liked what he found.<br>  So yeah, I think they still would have fallen in love. It just would have been a little easier for Edward.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	if she didnt smell like that, then edward wouldnt have loved her, and there would have been no twilight, and we wouldnt have to listen to the screeching harpies that are the twilighters taking over the books and authors section|`|S4W7FojCaa	He was also interested in what was in her mind because he couldn't read her thoughts.|`|ZuEOUiLRaa	Yes, they would have- it would have also been much easier for them to fall in love. Her scent didn't make Edward love her, it made him want to eat her, he wanted her dead. His "vegetarianism" is the only reason Bella lived throughout the series. Later when they do fall in love, her scent makes it almost physically painful for him to be with her, a problem that could have been eliminated without her scent. Also, he couldn't smell her the first time he saw her, he noticed that he couldn't read her mind the first time which, made her mysterious and interesting to him- that's one of the only reasons he noticed her. That's just my opinion though.|`|tvTnjozqaa	I kind of took it as they were meant to be together all along, and her scent was just a  part of that attraction that fate had in store for them.  If it weren't for her scent they still would have fallen in love, because he was also intrigued by her silent mind, and she was highly intrigued by him at first sight.|`|cQaHukqUaa	he also wanted to know what she thought, because he couldn't read her mind. but i think it was just her scent first. then he loved what he couldn't have.<br>  <br>  <br>  please answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309123555AAHePYF">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|pEDavW3caa	in the beginning it was her scent that caught his attention. when he first saw her he just thought she was a new student that's getting all the attention. later with a whiff of her scent he thought she was a demon sent from his own personal hell. but before that in the lunchroom he found out that he couldn't read her mind. so before he caught her scent he couldn't read her mind. i think he would still fall in love with her. <br>  hope i helped.

In case you've never seen the show, Benson is a detective who works for the NYPD special victims unit, a division of detectives who receive cases involving sexual offences as well as any cases involving children (abuse, kidnapping, etc.) Benson herself is the product of her mother's rape, and this causes her to empathize with the victims that she deals with on a daily basis. However, she is sometimes accused of getting too emotionally invested in her cases. Benson was also assaulted while undercover, and this traumatic experience has also changed how she thinks of herself. Acutually, maybe you should just wikipedia it, because I have homework to do.

I sure if you really wanted to make it unique, you could twist it a bit. How about everything you said only he lives in a city and has tons of problems in school (instead of living in a creepy house in the forest like the movie) Good luck! :)|`|SaNoaVVqaa	Yeah it's probably been done before, maybe not exactly like that but similar.<br>  I might read it, it just depends on the quality of the writing or what mood I'm in.  <br>  Don't let the other people on here discourage you if you want to write it though. :D  An idea can be unoriginal but well-written and work!  Just look at Twilight for example.  Vampire falling in love with the human.  It's been done!  But the book was well-written, so it stood out.|`|yLkU8crqaa	What the hell? Are you high?<br>  <br>  But seriously, I think the general idea, with the faerie seeing has been already used.|`|R02aazVdaa	I don't think so. I'm not sure how good the writing is, but the plot alone sounds a bit pulpy and ludicrous.|`|EcNTOqpvaa	yes in the book poison a girl named poison lives in this swamp with the rest of her village one night the faerie king comes and kidnaps her sister she then ventures out to save her sister and ends having to do all kinds of trials for the faeries and even solve a murder and when she finally gets done she finds out the girl she had passed on her way out of the swamp had been her sister (irony gets ya every time)|`|MTYtaBBOaa	Gail Carlson might have written something pretty identical.|`|tLmjn5x9aa	um, not exactly but Twilight Child and Fairytopia are extremely similar.
LVZdzPmpaa	The headline, while intriguing, means nothing without the story to support it. Today, headlines are sensational and often misleading. People then read the headlines (only) and accept them as the full story.<br>  <br>  Given that the press has sunk to new depths in the past several years, <br>  I would want to read the article to find out what "publishing empire" we're talking about. I'd also like to know who or what is leveling "charges" and I'd like "malfeasance" defined in detail.<br>  <br>  In the U.S., all publishing is owned by three distinct multi-national companies. All three constitute "publishing empires." But this headline could be talking about some two-bit vanity publisher. And the "widespread malfeasance" could be that it encourages nearly the nearly illiterate to "publish."<br>  <br>  There is little to be gathered simply in the headline.

DvToP5h7aa	Johnny Tremain by Esther Forbes<br>  <br>  Rab Silsbee<br>   <br>  Rab is two years older than Johnny, and when they first meet, he is everything that Johnny is not. Rab's quiet confidence and sense of self makes him a foil for Johnny, who is still uncertain of his role in the world. Rab is quiet where Johnny is talkative, unassuming where Johnny is proud, and patient where Johnny is impetuous. From their very first meeting, Johnny sees Rab as a model and the man that he wants to become. Nonjudgmental and open-minded, Rab is immediately able to see through Johnny's brash exterior to his sincere and lonely inner self. Rab reaches out to him effectively, providing him with a new life. He does not pity Johnny for his crippled hand and lost job. Instead, he offers Johnny the opportunity to overcome his handicaps.

Eventually, you will be appreciated by someone for your qualities, not the qualities of some fictional character.  I'll bet you are an awesome person in your own right.  You know how I know?

niv8xoRdaa	Hmmmmmm, your grammar could use a bit of work. Also, there's a significant lack of description and sensory details. I'd say that's the first place to look for improvement. Overall I'd say the excerpt was okay, didn't really strike a good impression on me. It seemed rather lackluster, although the story was amusing.|`|9RTuRPviaa	It seemed a bit cliched BUT because you are writing about a celebrity, it sort of works. You could probably turn this into an interesting story.<br>  You could use some work with your grammer, some of the word choice is a little clumsy but with some editing, i think you may have something :)|`|pcCfHYeSaa	Oh, I really like your story!!

Homes were more affordable as they were built similarly and were viewed as boxes. Fast food became popular. Holiday Inn popped making the roadside hotel extremely popular. Autos now had a more sleek design and with credit opening up to individuals became extremely affordable. And Rock n' Roll became the sensation in music.

niv8xoRdaa	Your grammar needs a bit of work; there were several places that needed commas and the opening line, which has a comma, shouldn't. Also, stay away from that much detail on the eyes. It's a classic Mary-Sue trait- the fascinating eye color factor. You might mention they were noticeable, attractive, perhaps even strange, but DON'T, I repeat, DON'T spend three or more sentences on it. Also try describing the hair as a mahogany brown. That way it looks less like over idealized physical coloring (another classic Mary-Sue trait) and more live a well rounded description.|`|02JUswskaa	It has some nice imagery in places and with effort could be a good piece. <br>  <br>  But you do need to work on your grammar and punctuation a bit.<br>  <br>  Well done so far!|`|AlErWVFQaa	Wow thats really good!

The treaty chat is the only<br>  thing stopping me from ripping his throat out right this minute."<br>  "We haven't forgotten," Edward said at the same time that I demanded, "What<br>  key points?"<br>  Jacob still glowered at Edward, but he answered me. "The treaty is quite specific.<br>  If any of them bite a human, the truce is over. Bite, not kill," he emphasized.<br>  Finally, he looked at me. His eyes were cold.<br>  It only took me a second to grasp the distinction, and then my face was as cold as<br>  his.<br>  "That's none of your business."<br>  "The hell it—" was all he managed to choke out.<br>  I didn't expect my hasty words to bring on such a strong response. Despite the<br>  warning he'd come to give, he must not have known. He must have thought the<br>  warning was just a precaution. He hadn't realized—or didn't want to believe—<br>  that I had already made my choice. That I was really intending to become a<br>  member of the Cullen family.<br>  My answer sent Jacob into near convulsions. He pressed his fists hard against his<br>  temples, closing his eyes tight and curling in on himself as he tried to control the<br>  spasms. His face turned sallow green under the russet skin.<br>  "Jake? You okay?" I asked anxiously.<br>  I took a half-step toward him, then Edward caught me and yanked me back<br>  behind his own body. "Careful! He's not under control," he warned me.<br>  But Jacob was already somewhat himself again; only his arms were shaking now.<br>  He scowled at Edward with pure hate. "Ugh. I would never hurt her."<br>  Neither Edward or I missed the inflection, or the accusation it contained. A low<br>  hiss escaped Edward's lips. Jacob clenched his fists reflexively.<br>  "BELLA!" Charlie's roar echoed from the direction of the house. "YOU GET IN<br>  THIS HOUSE THIS INSTANT!"<br>  All of us froze, listening to the silence that followed.<br>  I was the first to speak; my voice trembled. "Crap."<br>  Jacob's furious expression faltered. "I am sorry about that," he muttered. "I had to<br>  do what I could—I had to try…"<br>  "Thanks." The tremor in my voice ruined the sarcasm. I stared up the path, halfexpecting<br>  Charlie to come barreling through the wet ferns like an enraged bull. I<br>  would be the red flag in that scenario.<br>  "Just one more thing," Edward said to me, and then he looked at Jacob. "We've<br>  found no trace of Victoria on our side of the line—have you?"<br>  He knew the answer as soon as Jacob thought it, but Jacob spoke the answer<br>  anyway. "Trie last time was while Bella was… away. We let her think she was<br>  slipping through—we were tightening the circle, getting ready to ambush her—"<br>  Ice shot down my spine.<br>  "But then she took off like a bat out of hell. Near as we can tell, she caught your<br>  little female's scent and bailed. She hasn't come near our lands since."<br>  Edward nodded. "When she comes back, she's not your problem anymore. We'll<br>  —"<br>  "She killed on our turf," Jacob hissed. "She's ours!"<br>  "No—," I began to protest both declarations.<br>  "BELLA! I SEE HIS CAR AND I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE! IF YOU<br>  AREN'T INSIDE THIS HOUSE IN ONE MINUTE… !" Charlie didn't bother to<br>  finish his threat.<br>  "Let's go," Edward said.<br>  I looked back at Jacob, torn. Would I see him again?<br>  "Sorry," he whispered so low that I had to read his lips to understand. '"Bye,<br>  Bells."<br>  "You promised," I reminded him desperately. "Still friends, right?"<br>  Jacob shook his head slowly, and the lump in my throat nearly strangled me.<br>  "You know how hard I've tried to keep that promise, but… I can't see how to<br>  keep trying. Not now…" He struggled to keep his hard mask in place, but it<br>  wavered, and then disappeared. "Miss you," he mouthed. One of his hands<br>  reached toward me, his fingers outstretched, like he wished they were long<br>  enough to cross the distance between us.<br>  "Me, too," I choked out. My hand reached toward his across the wide space.<br>  Like we were connected, the echo of his pain twisted inside me. His pain, my<br>  pain.<br>  "Jake…" I took a step toward him. I wanted to wrap my arms around his waist<br>  and erase the expression of misery on his face.<br>  Edward pulled me back again, his arms restraining instead of defending.<br>  "It's okay," I promised him, looking up to read his face with trust in my eyes. He<br>  would understand.<br>  His eyes were unreadable, his face expressionless. Cold. "No, it's not."<br>  "Let her go," Jacob snarled, furious again. "She wants to!" He took two long<br>  strides forward. A glint of anticipation flashed in his eyes. His chest seemed to<br>  swell as it shuddered.<br>  Edward pushed me behind himself, wheeling to face Jacob.<br>  "No! Edward—!"<br>  "ISABELLA SWAN!"<br>  "Come on! Charlie's mad!" My voice was panicked, but not because of Charlie<br>  now. "Hurry!"<br>  I tugged on him and he relaxed a little. He pulled me back slowly, always<br>  keeping his eyes on Jacob as we retreated.<br>  Jacob watched us with a dark scowl on his bitter face. The anticipation drained<br>  from his eyes, and then, just before the forest came between us, his face suddenly<br>  crumpled in pain.<br>  I knew that last glimpse of his face would haunt me until I saw him smile again.<br>  And right there I vowed that I would see him smile, and soon. I would find a way<br>  to keep my friend.<br>  Edward kept his arm tight around my waist, holding me close. That was the only<br>  thing that held the tears inside my eyes.<br>  I had some serious problems.<br>  My best friend counted me with his enemies.<br>  Victoria was still on the loose, putting everyone I loved in danger.<br>  If I didn't become a vampire soon, the Volturi would kill me.<br>  And now it seemed that if I did, the Quileute werewolves would try to do the job<br>  themselves—along with trying to kill my future family. I didn't think they had<br>  any chance really, but would my best friend get himself killed in the attempt?<br>  Very serious problems. So why did they all suddenly seem insignificant when we<br>  broke through the last of the trees and I caught sight of the expression on<br>  Charlie's purple face?<br>  Edward squeezed me gently. "I'm here."<br>  I drew in a deep breath.<br>  That was true. Edward was here, with his arms around me.<br>  I could face anything as long as that was true.<br>  I squared my shoulders and walked forward to meet my fate, with my destiny<br>  solidly at my side.|`|GXnfJfU8aa	Do you mean the pages where Billy was talking about the treaty or when Jacob was actually talking about it?<br>  <br>  I looked it up, and it's page 242 in Eclipse :)<br>  The chapter called 'Legends'|`|qzlDj2claa	Oh okay.

QSthtKxIaa	Uh, I don't really see what the problem is: You have 7 story ideas already yet you don't know what to write about?<br>  <br>  I can't give you a specific answer unless I know more, but these might help.<br>  <br>  1. Use the ideas you already have<br>  2. If those ideas aren't enough on their own then combine them<br>  3. Write a crossover<br>  4. Write a songfic<br>  5. Write about what you like and what you know <br>  6. Write a parody<br>  7. Write a short fluffy story (fluff = those little cute romances)<br>  8. Write a tragedy<br>  9. Write anything with your favorite pairing.<br>  10. Use the big ideas everyone else does (EG. A story about their kids, one where someone gets pregnant, they are transported to an alternate reality, they run away, they're sent to boarding school, a new character joins the group: someone falls in love, someones jealous then they make up and become friends save the world etc etc)
RQfLKOPQaa	End It? Dude, you've just started it. You need a lot more than this, so far you've introduced the narrator and a character, nothing more. I would make a change: perfectly sculpted hand in my rough calloused hand, doesn't sound that great, what about: perfectly sculpted hand in my own, I think it's better, simpler but without repeating the word hand. As for the rest of the story, if you want a quick finish, have the girlfriend ask where the guy is looking at, but seeing nothing, only the guy can see it. Leave it unfinished with the guy realizing that, and it gives you an eerie feeling. If you want to make it last, have the guy meet his gf, then he comes back everyday trying to spot the other girl, and take it from there.<br>  <br>  All in all it's a great start, you're a pretty decent writer, and the story has good pace so far. Let me know how it ends, it's frustrating always answering these questions and never finding out how the stories end.<br>  <br>  Thanks for the story

It might be dramatic or it might not, such as a new major species or something. Everyone has been saying that: "THE END IS EMANATE!!!" and the world will "end" when ever there is a date that happens to co-relate to something else. The problem is that people also overlook the fact that man created time, so there is no reason to fret. Since it happens to also relate to something man has created it doesn't matter, because its not like time is a force. Besides if you go up to any Language Arts teacher and say "When will the world end?" That would be incorrect, because the earth is not a measurement and only something with a measurement will end. The film will end, because there are 45 minutes left. This string will end because there's only 5 inches left. <br>  It's like saying when will the sun end.|`|J58okEzraa	If all goes well:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#Future" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth#Futur...</a><br>  <br>  If it doesn't:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risks_to_civilization,_humans_and_planet_Earth" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risks_to_ci...</a>|`|AA10507866	Now.<br>  <br>  *BOOOM!!!!!!!*<br>  ...<br>  ...<br>  ...<br>  ...<br>  ...<br>  *squeak*|`|3qPytzRPaa	The world will end when the world ends.

KBBonf97aa	The DiMarzio would probably make the bass sound much more punchy and I imagine the new bridge would increase the sustain considerably (I've never replaced a bass bridge, but have noticed increased sustain on my guitars when I install better bridges).  I've got a standard Fender jazz bass and chose that over the model you own because the pickups sounded brighter than the retro ones.  But your bass definitely has a cooler look than mine.  And I join you in defending Squier instruments!  Given that they play and sound just like their more expensive cousins, I can only conclude that the critics are just snobs who care more about what's on the headstock than the music they're playing!  <br>  <br>  If you want to check out some other pickup options, there's a great company called Guitar Fetish that manufactures its own pickups and sells them dirt cheap.  I found the site a couple years ago when I was building a guitar and wanted vintage Rickenbacker pickups, but couldn't find any for less than $300 each.  The folks at Guitar Fetish specialize in duplicating vintage pickups, so I got the classic Ric sound in pickups that cost me less than $40 each.  Now I use GFS (Guitar Fetish's brand) on all the guitars and basses I build, since they sound fantastic.  Here's a link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://store.guitarfetish.com/pickups.html" rel="nofollow">http://store.guitarfetish.com/pickups.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Ow3O7h4caa	If you put DiMarzio on it, you will get mch more ouput  for sure. You will also get more bite out of your vintage.<br>  <br>  personally, i would put the Active for 5 string Jazz Bass? AJB-5 <br>  Seymour Duncan if you really want Ballz. Also, it has active-electronics incorporated in it which will give you a lot of variety in sound.<br>  The Hot for Jazz Bass? SJB-2 is another good one for jazz, rock heavy metal etc....<br>  For the neck, Quarter Pound for Jazz Bass? SJB-3 is the way to go.<br>  <br>  Good Luck....my 2 cents|`|FViagGVEaa	I suggest running your amp through a Sonic Maximizer, that seems to affect bass very nice
BAb0TqmTaa	hair spray, fixative, or just put a cover sheet on it. simple as that. like maybe tape it to a board and then tape a cover sheet around the board so absolutely nothing gets in there. i do it all the time and so far so good<br>  <br>  good luck =]|`|d4b208bef4b6c65668c5b927013773c1aa	I was going to suggest hairspray as well. there is also a spray you can buy for charcoal drawings and watercolors. I think I put a layer of plastic wrap over it, then roll it and secure with an elastic band.|`|kr34vLJkaa	Hair Spray?! No, no, no.<br>  You want Fixative.  There is the workable kind of fixative, and the I am done fixative.  Just fixative!<br>  Come on man, post it up on deviantart and link it so i can see it!!<br>  Well, I better do the same.<br>  <a href="http://gottabeartsy.deviantart.com/" rel="nofollow">http://gottabeartsy.deviantart.com/</a>

Many Canadian authors choose to be published by US houses.<br>  <br>  Check out the Canadian author Robert Sawyer.  He has a nice website and blog about writing (some very helpful stuff, even if sci-fi isn't your genre) and there is some information in there about the Canadian publishing industry. <br>  <a href="http://www.sfwriter.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sfwriter.com</a>

KHSOVxViaa	This is entirely possible.<br>  <br>  Communities of ethnic Germans had been living in the Russian Empire since the time of Catherine the Great.  Many are still there today, though there have been periods of migration when many people went to Germany or elsewhere.  They have taken on many aspects of local Russian life, such as foods and language, while still retaining essential elements of ethnic German identity.<br>  <br>  During WW II there was one of those migrations.  Many ethnic Germans were targetted for being the same ethnicity as the enemy, and those in the Nazi-occupied areas were pressured or propagandised into 'returning' to the Reich.<br>  <br>  Settlers were often moved to towns in occupied Poland, regarded by the Nazis as part of the Reich, but needing to be Germanised.  Later, as the Soviets advanced, refugees fled in front of them, heading westwards.  This would have included such ethnic Germans from the east.  Youths were conscripted into the Hitler Youth - they really didn't have much choice.  Being from the east would have made no difference.<br>  <br>  After the war, Germany was a devastated country, and it was to take some time for reconstruction to occur and the 'economic miracle' to happen.  Many easterners had a hard time in Germany, as their dialect and ways of life were so different from the locals.  Hence there would be good reasons to emigrate to the USA.<br>  <br>  It could well be the case that your grandfather has such origins.

I'm afraid I can't tell you which ones have what you are looking for, but there are phone numbers and you can call the stores and check.  (by the way "Instrumental" is a little vague = are you looking for Classical, Instrumental Pop, Instrumental Rock, etc...?).
