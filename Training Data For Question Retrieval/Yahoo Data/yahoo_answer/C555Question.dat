I haven't lost any weight since my feet went from a size 9.5 to 6.5. A lot of people attribute it to differing sizes with brands, but three sizes would be a pretty darn big difference.   So those are the two most common reasons I've seen, and I'm one hundred percent sure those are wrong. Any advice?

20081021205127AAb0T73	Health;Women's Health	Question for Mirena birth control users? I need input on this!?	Okay, before the actual question, a little background: Around the spring of 2007, I noticed that my periods were getting longer and heavier. They've always been pretty heavy, but this was way too heavy. I had to wear only the overnight pads, and had to change it a least once an hour, sometimes less, or it would leak. Well this kept on until November 07, when I started again. And it didn't stop. So my mom took me to the pediatric gynecologist at a childrens hospital where I go for my Type one diabetes. Turned out I have a blood clotting disorder, which is why it was so bad. They started me on birth control pills (seasonale, and 3 others that I can't remember) to try and stop it, which didn't work. Well in April of 2008, it still hadn't stopped, and I'd been on my period for 5 straight months, no breaks.

20081007170559AAgRSec	Health;General Health Care;First Aid	How can I make my ear piercing stop bleeding and hurting ?!?	I just pierced my third holes on my ears. My friend did them with a gun and one was pierced with a stud, the other with a hoop. I hear you're not supposed to pierce your ear with a hoop, but I didn't find that out until after I did it. Now the ear I pierced with a hoop is killing me! It won't stop bleeding, and throbbing and it's swollen. I didn't hit a vein, because my ear didn't turn blue, but my ear is in a lot of pain. When my friend first tried to pierce it, the stud didn't go through all the way, so she took it out and pierced it with a hoop really close to my second hole. I've been thinking that it's the earring that's hurting my ear and I tried to take it out, but every time I touch the earring or the ear, It hurts like CRAZY! I also have five other ear piercings that have never bled and never have hurt. I can't touch this earring or ear without screaming in pain almost. Is there anyway to make the bleeding and pain stop?! I've tried Hydrogen Peroxide and Neospoirn but nothing seems to help it. Any ideas???

I had all the symptoms a fever would give like the hot and cold, headache, body pains, Im not sure, but I had sinus pains around my eyes and cheekbones as well. Today is the third day and all was fine until I got a spinning image in my right eye, and as that was happening, I get dizzy and confused. I looked up symptoms and nothing came up. My family never had an eye problem so I dont know what could be wrong. I timed the times when it would happen and it would get shorter and shorter for the time limit. For example, I timed a 530Pm from when one started, the next one would be at 600PM, and after that it would lessen the time to around 5-10 minutes. I did not get enough sleep ther other two nights due to the hot and cold all night so maybe that was the factor. I ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner and drank lots of water yet I never coughed or had a sore throat.... weird..... So what else could it be?

So know i have been throwing up for 2 weeks. Nothing has worked for nausea. I have been to hospital 6 times to get me rehydrated and i got a cat scan and all my lymph nodes in my lower belly were swollen. I have been getting way weaker than i was. My balance is way off, vision is a lot worse, had a migraine for a month. It burns really bad when i pee and i have been tested for UTI, STD, and kidney stones all came back negative so that just baffled them. I have been getting real bad pains right above my groin to were i cant even bend there cause it hurts so bad. My one doctor says it is all mono that is it. My bowel habits have changed as well. I decided to get a second opinion at a gasterologist and they are doing a colonoscopy, and the mouth one with a biopsy i don't really know what for though. My nausea has been so bad they made me go to a compound pharmacy to get this cream i put on my arm and it really don't work. I have been very miserable.

Now they are straight but i have little gaps. Is that normal or did I need braces for more time? I'm going to the dentist on 3/9 and I was wondering if I should tell him about it.

Okay,so I'm a very active person. And I expect to have some troubles but today,my knee started feeling weird. I went to work this morning. After working for like 6 hours,I decided to work out. I ran a mile (after stretching) and then played basketball for about an hour I guess. Not too unusual for my saturday. Anyway, about 30 minutes after I finished playing ball my knee started feeling weird. And it still does,it's been about 4 hours. My right knee feels really stiff. And it feels like there's 'air' trapped all around it. It's sort of like a cramp but it doesn't really hurt. I did land on it a little awkward but thought nothing of it since there was no pain. I've since iced it and took ibuprofen. Should that,along with rest,clear it up or could it be more serious?      Thanks in advance for your help and if you need more details I'll try to help.

20090308002100AAfbVxO	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Intestinal pain when running?	I dunno if this is the right area. I have been working out for months and been running for a while. I can run a mile just fine, but when I try to sprint on the treadmill for over a couple minutes I get this burning in my intestines. (I think). It's ONLY when I sprint. It hurts pretty bad and makes it hard to run. Definitely isn't a stitch. I can re-create it any single time I want to go sprint for more than a minute. But if I run at a jog/sprint I"m fine, it's only when I sprint!      It's on the inside (obviously) about one or two inches below my belly button. Whatever organ is right there, it burns. When I think about it, I'd say it almost seems like blood isn't making it to that organ very well when I'm sprinting thus causing it to hurt really bad?       Oh and if I sprint with the burning for very long then afterwards I kinda gotta go #2 pretty bad :S      And I've tried not eating things for hours and hours before I sprint, didn't help. I've tried eating something right before, didn't help. It doesn't have anything to do with what I've eaten before I run or how long since I ran.

I have not been very well lately and have had quite a few operations :( But when i woke up last night (my 1st night back home) i found a few things that worried me! Firstly when i was getting out of bed i noticed a mixture of blood and a funny yellow puss which i then noticed was all over my torso and was coming out of the cuts. Once i had cleaned it off they all continued to bleed and give out a puss! Also one of the cuts looks a bit open, Could a stitch have fallen out? Is this normal? should i just clean them/cover them and hope it will get better? Should i seek some medical advice? Are they infected? Is there anything else that i can do because i don't like hospitals? Did they do it right in the first place?      I am quite worried about it because the operations were quite serious so please don't leave anything stupid       Thanks

20070602111754AADIgV2	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Why is B.E.T telling us to "wrap it up" when a virus can still get through microscopical holes on a Plastic?	Yo listen up, that isn’t enough to stop the spread of HIV/Aids and other STDs your still teach folks to gamble with their lives theirs no type of moral education in that, a condom can microscopically break and fluids can pass through: and that’s a fact, because I’ve heard cases with people getting STDs while using a condom. They should teach youths and adults to first find real love with spouse by getting to fully know them and stay abstain from sex until marriage. That is what the word of God teaches us in I Corinthians chapter 7, because any other way of living besides by the Word of God results to frustration, anger, regrets, disappointments, never finding happiness and death.    If anyone is being rush by their mate have sex; just know that they are not really wanting or loving you for who you are but for your body just to fill up their own selfish and prideful desires. I wish that our nation could encourage people like this instead of just tell them it is ok to have premarital sex

I keep getting really hot and then like 2 minutes later I am freezing. Right now I am so cold that I am shivering (i am wearing pants and a sweatshirt!). Also, my chest is hurting. I also have a really bad headache (kind of behind my eyes) and my throat hurts super bad. I have taken Day-Quil and it only helped for about 30 minutes. I also have been sucking on some logenzes to try to help my throat but it's not doing me very much good. One other thing is that I have a 3.5 cm ovarian cyst that we are just "monitoring" right now. Today, it has been hurting a lot more. Is this realated? Sorry this is so long I was just wondering if anyone had answers as to what this could be and if I should wait it out or go to a doctor? Thank you very much in advance, I appreciate all answers!

20090308002920AA6okPq	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Does having Aspergers Syndrome make me an idiot?	I don't like saying the word retard or freak because they are not nice names at all and that would make me feel worse.   I don't mean to put myself down on the negative side, but I have a mild form of apsergers syndrome. It's my condition where I find things in the world difficult. My weakest subject is maths.   People with autism or aspergers mainly have a problem with socialising and communicating.   For example: I would say something that other people may think is a bit rude or may make them feel a bit unaware.   I never say anything nasty. It is not in my nature to be nasty.   I may get a bit annoyed but that's very rare but NEVER nasty.   The problem is is that a lot of people with aspergers are quite paranoid.   Sometimes I think my friends don't like me, which is not the reason, but it feels like it when they don't talk to you.    My parents tell me that everyone loves me, including all my friends but I always think "No they don't."   I don't know what makes me say it.       I have coped really well with my condition and am becoming more independant but the strongest form in aspergers is stress.   I feel stressed a lot.   But just because I have a condition doesn't mean I am not special. Everyone is.   But I just feel like an idiot sometimes. And it makes me sad to think that.

OK, so you know how doctors and people say that when trying to get pregnant, the man should avoid hot tubs and excess heat to their groin area because it causes the sperm to slow down considerably and can also cause them to die, which makes i much harder to make a baby?       Since the females egg lasts up to 12 hours inside of her before it dies, and the sperm can last up to 5 days inside of the female, would it be killing off some of the sperm, or slowing them down in their race to the egg, if you are always having hot baths and soaking in the tub, or if you always have a heating pad on high over top of your uterus area?          We were told this by a doctor, and were questioning it because we are trying to get pregnant, but because of my enod, I have to use a heating pad on my lower abdomen, and he told us that getting too hot in there is not good for the sperm living inside of me while we are trying to make a baby....so I was questioning it.

Well I've been having a few gum problems recently, and a couple of days ago I was eating something hot when my mouth felt really strange.   I could feel some part of my gum flapping away.   When it came out, it was just this white, sort of tough stringy thing.   Now all I have is this quite sore red part.      I'm a bit worried about this as I am quite young.   Can anyone tell me what happened, as I?   Also, if some part of my gum has been damaged, will it grow back?      Please, please, PLEASE don't say "Go to the dentist", as I have dental-phobia and going three times a year is bad enough.      Thanks in advance :)

20090227134439AAMye3j	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	I fainted/blacked out 3 times yesterday...?	Yesterday I had woken up to use the restroom and my nose was  a bit clogged up so I blew my nose and it started bleeding. Now, I am not good with blood so I went into my mother's room and told her I had a bloody nose and so she rushed me into the bathroom. In her bathroom there's like a wall of mirrors and I saw myself bleeding, but my mom didn't know where I was bleeding from. So she made me open my mouth and I started to bleed from there as well. I was like "Oh **** mom, I don't like this I think I'm going to either puke or faint." All I remember from then is passing out and being shaken to wake up and it happened 3 times. I also remember thinking it was just a dream and I kept saying, "I'm fine, don't take me to the hospital."   Now the Dr. told me one of two things, either it could be fear of blood which I have, or something else...   I don't remember what the something else could be... do you know what else it could be? Please help      Also, is it normal to have like no taste-buds the next day from it?   Or is that bad....
20090227134535AA17aJw	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	A sprained/possibly fractured foot...?	The day before last, I was in PE and I got a sharp pain in my foot, turns out I sprained it. (It's the outside/bottom/and a part of the top of my right foot) Yesterday I had a limp, and today I can barely walk. It sends pain all through my ankle, also. The doctor said that I sprained it and I have a strained ligament, muscle, and tendon...but due to the shadows from the bones in the x-rays, it may be fractured. I have it wrapped, elevated, and I'm taking ibuprofen. It seems like it's just getting worse. I live where I'm better off to go to the vet's office than to the doctors, so any opinions or advice would be wonderful!

First off, the lightbulbs at my job which are small tube shaped but light up the fields at were I work at were thrown into a regular garbage can and i cleaned the can with cleaner, but i still feel like everytime i touch the can, i feel like i got exposed to something bad and that i cant "use" those hands cause of the fear of mercury in them doing something to my brain or body and my other reason is when i got close to one of my ex's and finigered for the first time. i just feel like i can't use my hands cause of the fear they are contaminated and that i feel something bad will happen like i feel like i'm gonna die or get something bad from it. it also happens when i feel like i cant touch food even though i constantly wash my hands. My question is that, both examples i gave, can something bad happen or am i making myself think  this and if in fact it is ocd, what are some self help tips i can do to overcome this?

(At first we thought it was the duct(s) for milk) Recently, the one in her left, inner breast has gotten to the size of one inch. On the right side, there's a very slight hardening, but it doesn't feel like a lump. The left one is hard, movable, and smooth. But it's not a defined shape. It's sort of oval, yet it has a protrusion near the top.       She has no healthcare as far as I know because her family has had financial trouble since who knows. She's never had a family physician, either. I'm going to let my mom, who's an RN, check her out, and then we're going to find a school clinic at her college for a check-up. I have a feeling it's just fibroadenoma, but we're both anxious to know. She's 19, I'm worried for her, and need any advice out there to help the situation.

20090308002742AAg3Wgt	Health;Dental	I have about an inch of an overbite and an extremely narrow jaw, but I cannot afford braces. What can I do?	I live in Ontario, Canada and my bottom jaw is set about an inch back into my head (in comparison with my upper jaw) which not only causes a lisp, and malformed teeth (all of the teeth on my lower jaw are really short and oddly spaced) and cuts on the top and sides of my mouth (my lower teeth cut into the top of my mouth if I'm not careful), but also seems to be affecting my hearing (I can move my jaw forward a bit, and when I do sounds seem much more clear and there is less pressure in my ears, which is a constant problem with me). I also have a rather narrow jaw, which has caused even more problems. I heard somewhere when I was younger that, because of the severity of the problems, it was counted as a birth defect and dental surgery would be covered under OHIP. Is this true? If not, what else can I do? My parents never followed it up then because my orthodontist at the time said that nothing could be done until I lost my last baby tooth (I am 20 now and still haven't lost that tooth... my mouth just cannot do anything normally). And now I cannot afford braces or surgery or anything on my own and this is causing me (and has caused) a lot of physical (and social) discomfort and pain. I am getting sick of it. Any help?

Well, I'm looking at it now, and my eye has yellowed, and the veins and pinkness have spread a bit more, like under the eye. It not that that pink yet, but its getting more and more of a solid pink. My eye itches and burns, even the fan's wind is aggravating it. I have a killer headache on the side of my head and it hurts to look at light or bright things with that eye. Under my eye has mild swelling, but my eye lids do look a little bit brighter (redder) than my other eye. I feel nauseous, and dizzy also (If this has anything to do with it) and I have a mild strain in my eyes to focus them on something and my left eye (right when looking at me) blinks but the eye infected sometimes doesn't blink with the other eye, and when i close the good eye, my vision is poor and kind of blurry, focusing in and out. Could you please tell me if I have pink eye, or at least the beginning of it and if pink eye does start at the opening of the tear duct and spread! Thank you very much.   -?Bailey

I usually do bicep curls every day (along with multiple other workouts) and after about 30 or 40 of them my hand begins to hurt really badly, so much that I have to put it down for a few seconds and then pick it back up.

When I was in the third or fourth grade there was a younger kid who urinated on himself in front of the school. A good amount of it spilled onto the ground so the janitor came and poured clorox or some kind of disinfectant onto it.       Almost instantly it turned into about 100 little mites or bugs or something. They squirmed around for about 10 seconds and then shrunk and disappeared. This was right in front of the school on a smooth surface with no cracks. It was like concrete or something but it wasn't down near the grass or dirt.       Most of my class saw it and we talked about it up until we graduated but it never happened again. The teacher told us that it was probably some bugs coming out the ground and that there had to be cracks in the ground but we poured soda out there again and it just pooled up. None of it "leaked" anywhere.       Anybody have any clue what in the hell that was?

20090308014902AA4Jefc	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Passing a drug test in depth?	Ok, I know the do's and don'ts of passing a drug test. I know that when trying to pass a drug test, based on weed, that the marijuana cells stick to fat cells, and your water system in your body. So you can drink plenty of water and it will dilute the test, but all in all the fat in your body stores weed cells.       I am a heavy set guy, but stay at about the same weight. even if i burn off fat, i gain it back from my first meal.       My question is, if I were to gain excess fat, would the new fat cover over the weed absorbed fat cells, or no?       Making the new fat be what the drug test reads, or if the test reads in a different way.

I would normally use condoms as well, but this morning my boyfriend and I wound up having sex without one. I thought it would be fine, I'm pretty certain my doctor said I'd be covered from 7 days, but now I'm reading all sort of advice online ranging from 7 days to 1 month. Which is most accurate?      I started the pill on the day after I finished my period, I'd been waiting for a doctor's appointment and got one after my period, annoyingly.      The leaflet inside says to start taking it on the first day of your period and you're protected from day 1, I know that, but I'm just a little concerned about the month advice. Is that just to be extra safe?
