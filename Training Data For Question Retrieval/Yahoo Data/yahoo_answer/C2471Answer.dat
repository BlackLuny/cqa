b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	Do you want an HONEST opinion?  Or do you just want me to say "kewl pic!  I like ur pic!"<br>  <br>  It's completely over-edited, with way too much contrast, and it looks completely overexposed.  It's so completely overexposed and washed out that all the details are gone.  In photography, we would say that it's "blown out."  In fact, if I took a picture like that, I would be horribly disappointed that I got the exposure so wrong and I would try to take it again.<br>  <br>  I really don't understand why someone would think that a picture is "kewl" when it's so horribly overexposed that the person's face and clothes are glowing white and the details are completely washed out.<br>  <br>  You would definitely NOT do well at all if you entered that in a photo contest.  The judges wouldn't even look at it.  The picture itself might not have been too bad...except that you "photoshopped" it to death.  REAL photography means capturing an interesting and meaningful picture with your camera, and taking time to get the right exposure.  No matter how much you try to edit a picture on your computer, it will not make a boring snapshot more interesting that it actually is.  And to be honest, in this case, you made that picture much worse.<br>  <br>  I'm expecting to get voted thumbs down, especially from all the MySpacers and Photoshoppers here.  That's fine, I really don't care.  But this is my HONEST opinion, based on my experience.|`|C77c0OE2aa	Well.... I now have another addition to my collection of the worse photos on the internet. Does that answer your question?<br>  <br>  Just take a good photo in the first place and forget about the totally WRONG mindset that you can do anything you want with computer editing, and it will make a photo "better".<br>  <br>  steve|`|bObtJCAVaa	Personally, I don't like it.|`|6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	Oh no, it doesn't look stupid...it just looks horribly over-edited, that's all.<br>  If you try to learn how to take a good picture in the first place, you won't have to resort to trying to make it look better...when in fact, all you're doing is making it look worse.<br>  Photo editing software certainly has it's advantages, but it doesn't work miracles.|`|k2iSDGauaa	it's a little too bright<br>  too much lens flare as they say|`|WPhADGwEaa	i love your glasses!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|haiQ9dmpaa	Colors/contrast is too strong.

f2cQrG7jaa	It's NOT a completely hopeless situation that's true, but I don't think it's one 100th the problem it's been made out to be. We hear things like "world hunger", "world violence" and "overpopulation" all the time (because it sells). Truth is only a very few people in the world are committing acts of violence at very few times. California alone could feed the entire world for 40 years with just the food it's got now. I wont even get into overpopulation and how misguided that concept truly is. <br>  <br>  Politics and charity are the problems, technology is the solution. Governments only spend money they don't generate any and all the problems they try to resolve get worse, just look at our education system, our economic system, our military etc.<br>  <br>  Despite the worst violence and hunger people of those countries still dance and sing and celebrate that they are still alive. Things aren't bad, authorities of any kind profit from violence and things like this and they will push it all they can. The same corporations have a large amount of influence over politics, media, banking and the rest, and their version of things will hit the news faster than yours.<br>  <br>  Why don't you help the starving people in your own state or city? I'm suggesting that giving a man a fish wont do him any good, nor will teaching him to fish, you've got to talk to the guy and communicate everything as if it's brand new and the implications of both your actions.

Lyrc2BWmaa	Well you should always be outgoing. Hardly ever is a girl going to ask you.<br>  <br>  Most of the times, guy just pop up behind me and i dance with them, but i think it would be really sweet if a guy asked.<br>  <br>  Some girls may have a boyfriend, just want to dance with their girls or are lesbian. So dont be affected by rejection.<br>  <br>  You should smile and ask if she wants to dance, and then stay really tight on her body. Put your hands on her hips while she moves, but not in a controlling kind of way, just going with the flo. Move with her body, and dont worry because girls mostly have to do all the work.<br>  <br>  You should tell her thats she one of the best dancers youve been with after, even if she sucked.<br>  <br>  Grindings fun so dont take it seirously, look cocky and have it in your mind that you can get the girl, because if your shy, then a bar isnt a good place for you.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your life and i hope you have greatt luck!|`|uYJdvnqxaa	If a guy came up to me that I didn't know and wanted to dance and grind on me,I would tell him to get the heck away from me.|`|A0MTKSoiaa	very creepy|`|e304c56bff79ec6d59f96a991c27676aaa	Ew.

TL1Jkqunaa	Crichton, by far.  You can always tell a Crichton story but you can also always tell them apart from on another.  WIth Ludlum and Grisham, after you've read 2 or more you start to think they are retelling the same story.  Each Ludlum story is so much like every other Ludlum story you only need to read one.

They are genre writers, and each one was (or is, in the case of Grisham, who is still alive), very good at it.  It isn't fair to compare them to each other, because they each have their own area---Ludlum wrote spy thrillers; Crichton was very knowledgeable in the medical field (he was a trained doctor) and often used that knowledge in his work, and Grisham, of course, writes mainly legal thrillers.  Who is "best" is a matter of opinion.  All are very talented.  Crichton may have had the broadest imagination of the three.|`|NQbtQwOUaa	I've read all three and my favorite is John Grisham.

That has nothing to do with vanity, and it's a conscious act.<br>  <br>  Sure things like getting a good job, buying a nice house, dressing well, buying ok (or good) looking shoes, etc are all due to vanity. And perhaps heroism too, as a way to prove your heroic honour. <br>  <br>  But other things like love and going to the toilet, and thousands of other acts, have nothing to do with vanity whatsoever. <br>  So although it may be correct to say that MANY conscious acts are due to vanity, not everything is.|`|UDQqY3pHaa	In a way yes but it is  not all vanity.

Then because you have a ear for music you will be able to tune your voice to what it sounds like.  For example, try listening to a song and follow along with one instruemtns that does not play the melody.  Letting your ears be able to wander off the melody and listen to the harmony will help you greatly.  Also, warming up properly will help you tune your voice.  Start with a La, Lu, Le, Li, Lo or w/e you choose then go up the scale and down the scale.  Hence warming up your vocal chords.  I think this is what you mean by tuning your voice.

Too late to feel Sorry now, but it's okay. Accidents happen and trust me when I say that because I know exactly how you feel cause I have a worse history with animals than you :-\  I suggest you do what I do nowadays when I see a dead bird.<br>  Give it a proper burial.  <br>  Put it in a shoe box and bury it.  Tell it your sorry and give it some flowers. It always made me feel better :-)<br>  <br>  -Momo~*|`|1TiaPwNUaa	Congratulations mate.  Welcome to compassion.

Analyze why you did something you oppose, or what put you in a position to do something you oppose.<br>  <br>  There was a study in 1963 where a group of students was asked to give patients electric shocks as a sort of aversion therapy. The patients were actors and were not actually being electrocuted, but the students did not know this. The administrator of the experiment told them that X amount on the "dial" would be a lethal dose. Students were soon instructed to give the patient a lethal dose. 65% COMPLIED, and gave the "patient" a lethal dose, KNOWING THEY WOULD BE KILLING THEM.<br>  <br>  So it is very easy to be conned by authority and situations to do things we find reprehensible.<br>  <br>  If this was the case in your situation, learn from it.

Very good books..<br>  <br>  I've also heard that Percy Jackson and the Olympians by Rick Riordan were very good, and have been compared to Harry Potter.  I have yet to read them myself.  <br>  <br>  Some more adult series you can try are:<br>  <br>  The Xanth Books by Piers Anthony.  The only thing is that there are a ton of books in the series and it starts getting dry after about six.<br>  <br>  The Sword of Truth Series by Terry Goodkind.

AA11342530	Imagine a world where love ruled, everyone had all modern goods, everyone had plenty of food and access to water, everyone had a work and got really good money, etc. Well this is where the problem begins. If everybody had good lifes, made big families, and made earth a dream planet that would be the planet's doom. Big families mean more peole which means more food to be produced which means more natural resources to be consumed which means that everything will come to a point that war will be the only way to regulate earths population. This is the truth. War exists so that you can have a PC and serf the web while the other 2/3 of the world fights for their lives.|`|ot6OJ7JWaa	I don't think you are insane, just that you've never experienced war. Go to war, get shot in the gut, see all your friends tortured and killed, innocent children being blown up, and other atrocities. And then you can talk. I don't know if you just don't understand the gravity of these terrible occurrences, if you think that it's cool to talk like that, are depressed, or whatever. Just do me a favor and learn your stuff before you start talking about these types of things, dear. <br>  I've had family die in wars. It's not pretty.|`|1B7oTAOkaa	consider this, there are 6,200,000,000 human beings on earth. eventually we will run out of food, water, oil, coal, space and practically everything on the planet that we know and love. the only way to stop this is to reduce the population. war serves that purpose and peace would instead only be a slow stranglehold on the neck of humanity. there are three goals i want to fulfill in my life.<br>  1. Take over the world(biggest and best challenge ever)<br>  2. Disprove religion (its all a bunch of BS)<br>  3. depopulate earth by 90% (this doesnt mean just kill, if possible we need to find planets that humans can populate, that would also work)|`|0lEdqFlVaa	Peace is an unreachable goal and war is necessary.|`|BVf2eAWnaa	No. Nothing is good.|`|AA12045427	I disagree with you.|`|FoIxsunVaa	War is bad and peace is imaginary.<br>  <br>  Which is better a bad reality or a nice fantasy?|`|c7pbvYmpaa	I hate what I love and I love what I hate.|`|XfSJZCEyaa	Peace is definitely good, but war may not always be bad.<br>  <br>  Peace is when everyone is happy and prosperous, so it can't be bad.<br>  <br>  War is often bad because of the suffering of innocent lives, but it can be good as it is neccessary to keep those 'out-of-line', in check.<br>  <br>  So i'd agree with you partially.

When Rob realizes that a traffic accident victim was actually murdered he enlists the help of Deputy Coroner Anna Drake. As the two investigate they discover that the crime of the city has its roots in the beautiful mountains. They become targets and race to stop the killer before more of their informants, or they and their families die.|`|HrtXiJAeaa	Nailed,Cheated,Things change-Patrick jones<br>  <br>  The pigman,the pigman's legacy,the pigman and me-Paul Zindel <br>  <br>  She's come undone-Wally lamb(there is sex in it) so you should be mature!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Uglies,pretties,specials, extras- Scott westerfield<br>  <br>  You've been warned- James Patterson(mature_<br>  <br>  Camilla-madeline L'engle<br>  <br>  <br>  The secret life of bees-Sue monk kidd<br>  <br>  The great Gatsby-F.

1Y21zyokaa	supastremph is right. But to add a bit more context since I imagine this is a Philosophy related question:<br>  <br>  Things that supervene on other things are made up of but not identical to the things on which they supervene. Right, so, think of a hammer. It's made up of a bunch of atoms and if those atoms were changed, the hammer itself would be changed. The hammer is supervening on the atoms though since the atoms themselves do not have the property of being a hammer. Hammerness exists because of the atoms but is not identical to the atoms.<br>  <br>  It's something that comes up with minds and brains. Some people claim that a mind, the thing you are familiar with, supervenes on the brain (the physical lump in your skull). So the one depends on the other but it is different than the physical thing. This explains the fact that a metal rod through your head can change your personality but that the mind is not entirely physical.<br>  <br>  You can also do the thought process with a bank. A bank is dependent for its existence on all the property, people and money but it is not just those things. Bankness is more than the sum of people, money and buildings and so supervenes on those things.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|l9Xg8Dv4aa	let us try it this way:<br>  Your mind is indistinguishable; we know it exists because of the Brain.<br>  Presuming that is correct, we have a Brain that can "argue" against the"Mind"<br>  One can then say the "Mind" is supervened by the brain; in other words it exists only because of the physical certainty of the brain.<br>  One identical Twin can not be said to <br>  Supervene the other..in other words one exists because of the other, because they both have physical appearance; however to say that they have Psychological difference or likeness creates a Supervenience. Now, it can be argued that one cannot be an identical twin without the other, but one person existing only because the sibling is  there is invalid.<br>  whew! I hope that helps!|`|d61511600922f016b452fc8b39ab7408aa	kind of dependency relationship, typically held to obtain between sets of properties|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	A really big 7-11!<br>  <br>  No really, think about is as set properties in the form of a Venn diagram (I'm a visual person) where we need to satify that<br>  <br>  A set of properties or facts M supervenes on a set of properties or facts P if and only if there can be no changes or differences in M without there being changes or differences in P.<br>  <br>  So in this illustration, we would draw a big circle P, that wholly encompasses another set M.<br>  <br>  So you could argue that the vowels supervene the alphabet, but the alphabet does not supervene the vowels.

hDFYlgbyaa	ok if you want to do flash games you don't need schooling, if you mean 3d stuff for consoles and computers then you should really do some research. if you want to do game ART there is no math necessary, maybe for college its required but not for making 3d art.<br>  also don't go to some school that is just barely starting in video games design. they don't know what to teach it and you will most likely end up wasting your money on a curriculum that will change every couple of quarters.<br>  as for that scratch thing i understand why its called that, when it comes to video games that stuff is terrible its just chicken scratch in comparison to what really happens. and it is not easy to make a video game there is a lot that must go into it, even if your just doing a mod. good places to go are the art insitute(i would go for the one in LA, i'll explain after), digipen is really good as well, and i think full sail might be ok, but i forgot.<br>  <br>  ok as for the art institute, and only the one in LA is because it is doing way better in the field of game art. right now they are taking screenshots and images of work done there and then having them posted on the walls of the other art institutes around the country. i go to the one in LA. and the reason its so good there is because they have made a working curriculum for game art. and its not like some college where you go to class, get the grade, and struggle helplessly to get a job in the game industry, not to say it isn't hard to get a big job in the video game industry. we also have our own little game production team, something that is just barely starting in most of the other art institutes, and they are just taking it as another type of class to get the grade for|`|amcqJkWhaa	You can make games, it's easy when you get the hang of it, or make some more. Here's probably a simplified program, but as it's free and you've never made games before, I think you can rid of some of your-- what can I call it? Stage fright seems to be the best analogy--stage fright by checking it out... <br>  <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://scratch.mit.edu/</a><br>  Click the download Scratch button on the right. <br>  <br>  For game art... well there's coming up with the designs for everything in the game, as it's all created from scratch I guess, as part of the overall vision of the game. The environments... land scape, architecture, armory, flora and fauna, clothes, people, possible some historical research and reference. People who make these, are called concept artists, I believe. But, I think they are more focused on the design aspect, according to the head person's vision (art director? Producer? dunno), and not really on the making of it into the games. You could be that person too, I think... the one who makes the models of the drawing, inputs it into the computer-- if the way they do it in games is at all like how they do it in animation... <br>  Well, for concept artists, you need to know how to draw, and design well. Perhaps if you were more into drawing the landscapes and the surroundings, the buildings, you could study in fields like architecture and industrial engineering (though keep in mind, for games and movies alike, the designs are more towards entertainment value and appeal, and not for actually being function in real world, so expert knowledge is not really 'required'... though having some study in these areas may make your skills and therefore value as a concept artist increase). <br>  I think there are 2 parts of concept artistry... one is good design, and the other is good rendering.. so even if you're not a very good artist (in the sense you can make a pretty picture and know the techniques), you can still be a good designer, you have the imagination and you know what has good forms and like that. You make personal and unique things, something of interest, rather than like being able to have classical beauty all the time... well I'm not explaining it very well. Perhaps you can read up on this elsewhere... <br>  So like, I don't know if anything is really required to make game art, other than artistic skills and good design sense, which are very broad concepts and may exclude the sense of being tied to games. <br>  <br>  I hope I have introduced you to some ideas, and may you explore this more.|`|airjZSpoaa	Well, I went to school at Southern NH University.

cd95de239446f69fedcb750722eee1b9aa	Too many love means something magical, divine, mystical. But in this day and age we have determined the sad truth about love that in our childhood we never wanted to admit or perhaps we never knew.<br>  <br>   In essence love is a self centered emotion and a greedy one at that. The person we fall in love is either the perfect match or a compromise based on what we want and our desires. For example, attraction releases chemicals in our bodies that stimulate pleasure. These chemicals are activated almost on instinct by our bodies as a response that we have found the person that most likely looks like the envision of perfection within our subconscious. So the subconscious is actually the one that activates all these feelings when we find a person we like. <br>  <br>  This is not limited to one person. There can be many more. Why? Because our minds have stored information that we have a hard time remembering and our bodies also works like this. I say this because recent discoveries have shown that organs and blood can store information. This could mean that some of our memories, events that we could pass of as imagination, could be actual memories from our fathers or mothers, etc. Anyway, because we are more fond of good memories, we tend to latch on to the feelings when events like this occur. So most of us are actually addicted to feelings that are in the pleasure category. So maybe, just maybe attraction is initiated when such feelings are released. (Hope you got that) <br>  <br>  You still with me? Good.<br>  <br>  As for the mind it's a simple question of finding the person that has all or at least half of the qualities we consider important. If not then, there can't be any attraction to the mind/personality.<br>  <br>   When this is covered, that is when we actually accept these feelings as love. <br>  <br>   Hope I didn't make a hole in your head with the answer.|`|96AQZUGyaa	I can't really think of a good, solid, long answer...

Energy cannot be destroyed and it can only be converted into another form. The most basic life forms relied on mitosis to propagate itself, and environmental conditions made them evolve, creating more sophisticated life-forms. Energy had to be utilized in one way or another, so it was passed to and fro between living organisms. You might want to call it "attraction" if you prefer. So in a way, that energy is called love. To be more scientific about it, the emotion of love is processed in the brain, not in the heart. The part of the brain responsible for this emotion is the hypothalamus. So it would be more apt to say "I love you with all my hypothalamus" when you  want to express this emotion called love to that person you fancy.|`|ezunIOIoaa	something  of  their  own  reflects  in their  love,  they  recognize  their  own   nature    and   embrace  it|`|86k0M2VDaa	This makes me sound like a prude with no emotions.

AA11370093	The egg becomes a human being at the moment of conception.  There is no other objective starting point than at conception.  Every other "standard" is demonstrably arbitrary and is more indicative of its proponent's bias and ideology than a rational assessment of the facts.<br>  <br>  Human beings (homo sapiens) have characteristics which distinguish them from other beings, but there wouldn't be any characteristic whatsoever without the human genetic code.  The human code is what makes us what we are and THAT is what distinguishes us from other beings.  Moreover, every human being has a unique genetic identity which is created at conception.  Since homo sapiens are classified by the genetic code, and since every individual has a unique code, the objective starting point for a human being must be conception.<br>  <br>  It is argued against this that since every human cell within a body contains that body's unique DNA, having the code cannot, in itself, define a human being.  This rationale is a common category error (mixing apples & oranges).  Every cell has DNA because it is part of a body which is identified by the same DNA.  Reading DNA alone from *any* cell serves to identify the person, not the cell.  We do not confuse a chocolate bar with the word HERSHEY'S written on it with the corporation that produced it.  There would be no muscle cell without the code, so the cell's existence and identity is dependent upon the code, not the other way around.<br>  <br>  The brain activity argument is also arbitrary.  Let's say we have a developing baby whose brain doesn't develop properly, but everything else proceeds to develop.  Although the fetus is alive, there is little measurable brain activity (he is comatose).  The lack of brain activity no more negates the personhood of the baby than a comatose state negates the personhood of an adult.<br>  <br>  Consider the hypothetical newborn twins John and James.  John has consciousness for several days and then becomes comatose.  James is born in a coma and remains that way.  Is it permissible to kill James, but impermissible to kill John?  Of course not.  The difference between John and James is functional, not in essence or nature.  Consequently, the unborn, at every stage from conception, are not potential persons, but human persons with potential.<br>  <br>  If you would like to discuss this further, feel free to email me.<br>  <br>  Kind regards,<br>  Scalia|`|AA11564934	2 diff question.<br>  <br>  there is no firm answer to question 1|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Let's draw some lines here.<br>  <br>  Being human is MORE then just having human DNA.  This is easy to prove:  my body has ten trillion cells, each with human DNA.  But I am not ten trillion humans... I am ONE human.<br>  <br>  Any definition of humanity, then, has to distinguish between a characteristic that cells or organs have and those a full entity has.  Just as a cell is not a human, neither is a tissue, an organ, and so on.  What we are really after is the ESSENCE of humanity - those things that cannot be removed and leave a human being.<br>  <br>  We are assisted in this search to some degree by our medical technology.  People can survive losing many organs, or even have them replaced by machines.  So we know that a human doesn't have to have limbs, a heart, lungs, or really any functioning apparatus from the neck down.  A human doesn't have to have a face, hair, or any particular part of the skull.  Hopefully you can see where we are going with this.<br>  <br>  In fact, the standard doctors use for death is BRAIN death.  As philosophers, we might go even further and say that the mind is what makes us who we are, and that even if everything else were lost or replaced then we would still be ourselves.  It seems only logical to apply this to the other end of the lifespan too and say that a human is only alive when the brain is active and functioning in a human way.<br>  <br>  From premature births, we know that very intermittent brain activity begins as early as 20 weeks of gestation, sustained activity around 22 weeks, and activity that begins to look like normal operation around 27 weeks.  So that's probably as early as you can probably plausibly suggest that you have a human and not just a blob of pre-human cells.  It's probably no coincidence that this is also the point past which premature births are unsurvivable.<br>  <br>  As for fingers, the hands start to take a distinctive shape at 6 weeks and the first notches between fingers begin to appear at 7 weeks, with fingers and toes becoming distinct by the 8th week.|`|9d186c2ebefdbde8d0bb36cdaae05407aa	A ovum officially becomes a pre-natal living human when heart beat starts. Which is 22 to 23 days or 4 weeks after fertilization and 1 week after gastrulation. On this stage, embryos are fomite in structure and form.<br>  <br>  A ovum officially becomes compatible for life when the spermatozoon intrudes the layers of the ovum which is the point of fertilization and then it automatically turns into a zygote. To say a zygote, morula, or a gastrula is a human being is still debatable. <br>  <br>  The embryos have limb buds which are the simplistic prototypes of the limbs. They are developed 4 weeks after fertilization which is 28 to 32 days. <br>  <br>  I based this human embyogenesis stages from the Carnegie stage table which has a link down in the source.|`|AA10565336	Since DNA will identify someone as an individual person and DNA must be formed before the first cell division it follows that a fertilized egg is a human the moment it is ready to divide.<br>  <br>  As for child development in the womb goes; a picture is worth a thousand words.

One can arbitrarily pick a developmental stage (ie nervous system differentiation, identifiable toes or eyes etc) but unless one believes in the old magic migration of the soul there is not absolute point when it goes from a lump of cells to person.

But they did my "Fender" in Korea.  for all you know though it may not even be a fender.  someone may have taken off the name just so people would think it was a fender a first glance.   they made many many telecaster copies....<br>  <br>  If you take the neck off of the body - there might be a label on the inside of the neck where it bolts to the body.  just make sure when you put it back on that you put the shim, if there is one, exactly how it was when you bolt it back on.<br>  <br>  does the headstock match fender style? that could at least give you a estimate of the year - the headstock style changed slightly over the years.<br>  <br>  additional info:<br>  <br>  Fender's second string brand, Squier, also makes Thinline Telecasters, they are the Master Series Thinline Telecaster and the Vintage Modified Series Thinline Telecaster. The Master Series features twin Duncan Designed humbucking pickups, 2 volume and 2 tone controls and a 3-position toggle switch. The Vintage Modified Series is more traditional, based around the '69 Fender Thinline, featuring 2 Duncan Designed single coil pickups, 1 volume and 1 tone control with a 3-position toggle switch. <br>  <br>  ****However, in a break from the usual Fender standard, the Squier Thinline Telecasters both feature the more Gibson-esque shorter 24.75" scale where Fender use a 25.5" scale.****<br>  <br>  get out the measuring tape.<br>  <br>  <br>  "every day i have the blues" is correct on this the squire has improved quite a bit.  you already have one, but with a squire it is usually a good idea to play around with a few of them because oddly even the same model can sound different from guitar to guitar.<br>  <br>  yeah, and - if i was going to go the semi-hollow route as he mentions - i would probably find a gibson model, they are more of the "semi hollow body" company than fender is...

It means that we see things in a better light when we can look back on them nostalgically. Ephemeral things, the things which happened but have now disappeared, are things which we kind of sanitize looking back on them. So we think of George Washington as a kind of hero (in America at least), even though he did a lot of killing and was all hell of a rebel as well as, later on, a victorious general and a statesman. Similarly, people look back on the "good ol' days," when in fact there was a lot about them that were bad.<br>  <br>  There is a moral claim here, too, which is that we aren't really able to honestly judge things that have happened since we look at the past through rose-colored glasses. When Kundera writes about the "idea of eternal return," the idea is that we can condemn things (and honor them) correctly only if we think about them as possibly recurring: would we want to live in an era (in the FUTURE) in which women can't vote and blacks can't go to restaurants or hotels, even if the family is a much stronger unit and white kids are better educated? Etc. It's not actually about those precise events, though, but about our ability to judge things only when we really believe that they could happen again.

suxCcXkAaa	I think you can easily argue for either. It's obviously a love story--Romeo and Juliet fall in love, and one of the major, major themes is the danger of young love--its hastiness, imprudence, and mostly, its transience. Then again, the whole story also hinges on the hate between the Montague and Capulet family, and there are a lot of memorable fight scenes as well. You can argue that it's both, and that in this particular play, the plot relies on its interplay to breed both intense love and hatred, and the tragic ending.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to some more in-depth information on that. Explore "love" and "hate" under themes and see if it helps you decide =]|`|cwzH7DVvaa	I'd definitely say it's a love story. Inspite of the family feud and the brawls occuring in it; its main theme is always described as love. Though genre-wise, it's a tragedy. This all seems a bit 'duh' really. Oh and FYI, please spell it right. It's 'Juliet,' not 'Juilet.'|`|HhW5lf8Daa	Love Story more than a story about fighting. It does take place at a time where two families are in a feud, but it focuses more on two star-crossed lovers who fall in love forbiddingly. Romeo does all that he can, even going against his own family to be with Juliet. Heh But at the end they both die under horrible circumstances. (Very ironic). But yes it's focused on those two people hence the title Romeo and Juliet. The fighting is what Shakespeare wrote to help go with the plot (and the whole feud thing) and for people to be entertained. It's also blends in nice. Who doesn't love a good romance play with fighting and death?|`|a1nUhQ56aa	Well I think its a tragedy, because I think that is what Shakespeare intended for it to be.|`|pbw7chpyaa	Love story<br>  <br>  It ends with suicide rather than with a big fight.|`|CGQ6w2KHaa	a tragic love story.  which was what it was intended to be.|`|SibacxISaa	i'm doing romeo and juliet as part of my GCSE and i definately think that's its 50/50 fighting and 50/50 love.

UVnr7wrmaa	Scattergories is a creative-thinking category-based party game produced by Hasbro through the Milton Bradley Company and published in 1988. The objective of the 2-to-6-player game is to score points by uniquely naming objects within a set of categories, given an initial letter, within a time limit.<br>  <br>  The game is played in sets of 3 rounds.<br>  <br>  Each player takes a folder with an answering pad and 3 category cards. Each sheet in the answering pad has three columns of 12 blank lines. In addition, the category cards have 4 lists, each with 12 unique categories, for a total of 144 categories in the game. In new versions of the game, each card has 2 lists of 12 unique categories, for a total of 16 lists and 192 categories. All players must agree on the list to use. <br>  One player rolls a 20-sided letter die to determine the first letter used. The timer is set for up to three minutes. <br>  <br>  One player starts the timer. In the time allotted, each player must attempt to think of and write down, in the first column on the pad, a word or term that fits each of the 12 categories and starts with the rolled letter. Any number of words in the answer is allowed, as long as the first word starts with the correct letter. For example, with a category of "vegetable" and a letter of "C", words such as "cucumber", "carrot" and "collard greens" are acceptable, but "broccoli" is not (wrong initial letter), nor is "citrus" (wrong category). Alliteration is encouraged; chinese cabbage is worth 2 points. <br>  <br>  When using alliterations though, remember to follow the category. You cannot use generic adjectives to score points. For example, if the category is food and the letter is G, a good answer would be 'green grapes' because green is the specific variety of grape. Germy grapes, giant grapes, or Georgia grapes would not work, since they are generic ideas and not really names of foods. Writing a bad answer is still better than no answer though because there is always the possibility that the group playing will accept the answer. <br>  All players stop writing when the timer is finished. Following the list, each player, in turn, reads their answer for each category. Players score zero points for an answer that duplicates another answer in that round, and one point for an answer no other player has given. Acceptable answers using alliteration score one point for each word using the letter. (In the "Junior" version, players earn 2 points for an answer that begins with the chosen letter, and 1 point for an answer that does not begin with the chosen letter, but no points for a duplicate answer.) <br>  <br>  For example, in the "C-vegetable" example, if players A, B, and C answered "cucumber", "cucumber", and "cauliflower" , respectively, players A and B would score nothing, and C would score 1 point. Adjectives may not represent the letter to be used. For instance, "crunchy carrot" would only receive one point, for carrot. Similarly, "crunchy onion" is unacceptable. <br>  <br>  If for some reason a player thinks someone's answer does not fit the category (for instance, "knuckle" for the category "types of sandwich") a player may challenge that answer. When challenged, all players vote on the validity of that answer. If the vote is a tie, the vote of the player who is being challenged is thrown out. <br>  <br>  The die is rolled again (and re-rolled if the same letter as the previous round is duplicated), and the second round starts.|`|hgwAT1hAaa	The only Scattergories I know of is a board game.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-4917-S5-Game-SCATTERGORIES/dp/B00000IWEP/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=toys-and-games&qid=1236468500&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Hasbro-4917-S5-Gam...</a>

GFzDwIk6aa	I've done a lot of character questionnaires for the protagonist in my current story (Sangria), so this should be relatively easy.<br>  <br>  If I had to recall everything I could remember from my childhood, it would take me forever. Being half-sanguivore, I can remember everything from the past 17 years vividly and without mistake. However, one thing which sticks out in my mind is the last time I saw my mother. It was a memory seen through undevloped 18-month-old eyes, but it seems as clear as day to me. <br>  She was beautiful.<br>  I remember the contrast of the dark shadows under her sapphire eyes against her creamy skin and her lustrous honey-blonde curls, which fell down past her shoulders.<br>  I still cannot begin to understand the confusing expression on her face.<br>  She was attempting to adjust the uncomfortable, skin tight, black outfit she was wearing. <br>  It was her first day as a combatant in the war, and her last.<br>  She spun the black pistol around her finger and couched down to me. <br>  I remember the exact words her ruby lips spoke - "I'll be back soon darling. I promise"|`|8HPdqHTSaa	I remember waking up everyday to the warm sunlight that would stream through my window every morning, greeting me to a new day in the valley that held our village. I would pound down the staircase, sweeping long black hair from my bright eyes as the piano in the main room glinted with blinding light. Perhaps I would go exploring through the woods again, since the aloneness would be comforting. Or I could run around with my friends.<br>  Ah, my friends. I remember them. I remember living with them, until one day I was watching them grow up without me. They moved on to other things, and through these past three years they've lived without me.<br>  And now, three years later, I'm still here, same as I was on the day i turned 18. And I doubt that I won't be like this forever.<br>  <br>  Wow that was harder than it sounded.|`|U5RTRzKiaa	I remember concealing myself in a hallway closet in the home of my foster parents during a party they had held. Several of the guests were drunk out of their minds and had attacked me for entertainment. Sophie, my foster mother, watched on in the arms of her husband Peter. It wasn't her fault. None of it was. She didn't knew what to do. I knew that now.<br>  <br>  I had hidden in the closet, among the various jackets, forgotten toys and the occasional neglected keepsake. I could not deny that I was frightened. I listened to the nonchalant laughter issue from beyond the crack in the door and a moment later... the hinges whined softly, sending fear cutting into my skin.<br>  <br>  I remember thin shards of light had unfolded out across the small space I had escaped to and just touched the edges of my dress shoes. A pale, slender hand then extended out towards me, inviting quiet comfort within its embrace. The long fingers bade me forth. I had  crawled towards it, trembling as I let my fingers brush the extending hand. Slowly, tenderly, the pale hand drew me forward and out into the light.<br>  <br>  It was a young woman, a soft charming smile curling on her deep red lips. Her long pale face was shaped in what looked like curiosity. Her long black hair furled around her bare shoulders. She had worn an old-fashioned black dress to the party, the corset tight around her chest, silm and accenting around her waist. At the point of her hip, the dress flowed downward in ruffles of silk. A ruby was cast in silver that dropped from around her neck.<br>  <br>  She had said my name then, questioned me, and offered sanctity. I left Novi Sad with her. I never saw my foster parents again for she was... my heaven in flesh.<br>  <br>  Sorry this was so long >.<|`|nCLcdJO0aa	My earliest memory is back in the flat in the city centre, surrounded by the sound of the rumbling of cars streaking down the road, and the pugent stench of the excess petrol seeping through the small gap in our single-glazed window.<br>  <br>  After that though, my life changed greatly for the better. We spent seven hours in a moving van, to move in to our new cottage in Exmoor and start a new life for ourselves.<br>  But I didn't know that. Being only three, I screamed and thrashed around, for once longing to be back in our polluted home. The only home I'd ever known.<br>  <br>  But now I'm fourteen, I have nothing to dislike about our country village. Sure, it's small, but I love waking up to the sweet smell of freshly cut grass, and to hear the sound of birds cheeping and early-rising kids playing. Somethimes I can even join them without worrying about what people with think of me.<br>  I love my home, I love my house, and I love my both my families.

8asG4WCwaa	You need to take a little time and learn as much as you can about the industry.  It can help you avoid falling victim to a scam, and it can help you navigate the publishing world.  <br>  <br>  You need to know<br>  ---your genre and it's market<br>  ---your word count and how it applies to that genre/market<br>  ---how to properly format the manuscript<br>  ---how to write a query letter (with  pitch) and synopsis<br>  ---the difference between copyrights and publishing rights (and, no, you do not need to copyright the manuscript first)<br>  ---how advances and royalties really work, and do returns and remainders affect your royalties<br>  ---what agents do for you besides sell the manuscript (it's a lot)<br>  ---the difference between traditional and self publishing, and why self publishing has a poor reputation in the industry<br>  ---why traditional publishing takes time (and, no, that is not a bad thing)<br>  <br>  Right now, just giving you a list of company names is rather worthless.  You did not indicate your manuscript length or it's genre.  If you are unfamiliar with publishing, chances are you do not have it in manuscript format, do not know that most traditional publishers prefer not to get unsolicited (unagented) manuscripts, and that you need to send a query letter first.<br>  <br>  Get a copy of the Writer's Market or Author's Yearbook.  It has  a basic overview of many of these terms, samples of query letters and formatting, as well as listings of agents and publishers.<br>  <br>  I recommend that you look for an agent to represent your work.  They are skilled at what they do, and for their commission, they do a lot for us.<br>  <br>  Consider first joining a reputable writing group that is not tied to a self publisher as a marketing tool.  I like absolutewrite.com/forum (the watercooler) because it is a large, active group (many of them are published), subforums for the genres, and a wealth of information in the links and sticky threads.  You can learn a lot there without ever having to ask a question :-)<br>  <br>  Always remember:<br>  1 - real publishers pay you, you do not pay them<br>  2 - real agents get paid after they sell your work, not before<br>  3 - being "available to order online" is not the same as having books on shelves at real stores|`|tcxB5lteaa	Well - here's the thing.  It's not a scam as in - if you pay them, they're just going to run off with your money.  They will publish your book - but they will leave you to market it and pretty much do everything else.  There have been some moderately successful authors who went this way.<br>  <br>  However, I still wouldn't recommend it.  "Legit" publishers will only make you pay for postage to send in your query letter and what not.  If they accept you - they'll do all the publishing and marketing and it won't cost you an arm and a leg.  Of course, this way is much harder to get accepted, but it is cheaper.<br>  <br>  Pick up a copy of Writer's Digest.  They update that book annually and list all "legit" publishers.|`|o6IPqzrJaa	publishing houses are always cheating people for their money|`|SBhVZD4Xaa	it's a scam|`|YipD1QKFaa	Pay to play, no matter what the medium, is always a scam.|`|a0a4b271882587e60ffff0e04ab06fb3aa	The biggest hurdle for a first time author is finding a bona fide agent to represent you. Most agencies have thousands of manuscripts sent to them every year and typically, they only select a few works that are worthy to represent. Submitting your work directly to publishers is almost a waste of time, as the slush pile for publishers is ten times what it is for most agencies.<br>  <br>  DO NOT submit to anyone that requires up front money or "reading" fees. Most agencies will read your book for nothing if it's well presented and if they think it has merit. Reading fees are a rip off. You can check on legitimate agencies at the "Preditors & Editors" website. They keep an up to date list of current agents and any problems writers have had with them.<br>  <br>  Now, once you find an agency, you need a great query letter to get their attention. Search the web for examples. If your query letter is sloppy or has misspelled words, you're TOAST. Get a qualified copy editor to help you, if you can afford one. Then, once the agency reads your query and agrees to look at your manuscript, MAKE SURE IT IS PERFECT before you send it off. Again, bad formatting, grammar problems or poor spelling will doom you from the start. Pay an editor to proof your work--it's worth a few hundred bucks to get your foot in the door with an agent.<br>  <br>  After that, be prepared to wait up to 3 months for an answer from the agency. DO NOT submit to more than one agency at a time. If your work is good and the agency sees potential in it, they will offer you a contract. From there, it can be another 3 month wait for them to find you a publisher. Once you get a publisher, it takes about a year to actually see your book in print.<br>  <br>  You can also go the eBook route, which is becoming more popular every day now that eBook readers and publishers are more readily available. I did that and it worked out very well for me. I went from a very small online eBook publisher to a major hard cover print publisher, but it took several years. These days, it's much more acceptable to start out with an electronic version and move into print. However, you should think about doing your own eBook instead of paying some company to throw it together for a fee. Most of those services could care less if your book looks good, has typos or whatever. They also OWN the ISBN's for their titles--you do not--so keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. If you're serious about getting published, you can make it happen. It takes time, patience and a lot of luck. And as a note of reality, of all the fiction books published in a given year, only about 13% ever sell more than 1,000 copies. Most (75%) sell fewer than 500. Contrary to popular belief, most authors don't get rich.<br>  <br>  Jon Baxley, author, editor, proofreader and ghostwriter<br>  <br>  THE SCYTHIAN STONE (coming soon)<br>  THE BLACKGLOOM BOUNTY (hardcover & Kindle)|`|Ai9VR41Waa	More than likely you are looking at self-publishing companies.  You need to read all the fine print and don't sign a contract unless you are willing to do everything that they ask.  Personally, I don't think self-publishing is a bad way to go.  You get your book out there, your name out there and you never know who may pick up that book and decide that it is truly wonderful.  I've done it.  Yes, you may have to pay a little but you can also order your own books and put whatever price on them you want after you receive them and recoup some of the money you've shelled out.  I have actually done quite well!  Good luck to you in your endeavours!|`|Hp6GLCopaa	Of course it is a scam! You do NOT pay anything to publish your book, unless its self publishing. For all publishing companys, they get a portion of your sales. i woulg suggest buying a book called The Writers Market 2009. They have lists of the best REAL publishing companys. Best of luck!
x38sIvyxaa	I think literature is anything that is...<br>  1) well-written.<br>  2) written with a moral or morals.<br>  3) written to teach, and not just to entertain.<br>  4) powerful enough to permeate future generations of readers.<br>  <br>  So, with that said, I DO consider Harry Potter literature. I also consider the books we normally refer to as the 'classics' literature.|`|u0zEutf1aa	I agree with Epiphany's definition. Literature is a written work that has a deeper meaning and makes you think. Harry Potter, for instance, is literature. Princess Diaries isn't, though it's lots of fun.<br>  <br>  ?M?
pZIiYc8baa	You'd think this type of question would be easy to answer. I grew up in a household with no money to spare so I practically lived at our neighborhood library and no matter where I've gone each public library I've entered still stirs up those fond memories of favorite books and old classics and even that creepy guy who liked to read by the door...<br>  <br>  Yet I walk into a bookstore and I smell new print and the promise of future success. For me the library is like reconnecting with old friends while the bookstore is like meeting new ones.|`|xGmhDTWwaa	Library for sure. There you can get just about any book (if they don't have it they'll usually order it in) and read it whenever you want. You could do this at a bookstore but then you kinda have to buy the book first pay anything from a few pounds to alot of money. Although you then have the book at hand whenever, having every book you ever wanna read in your house will be cluttered and you'll be spending alot of money.<br>  <br>  The library is free and has any book about anything you could possibly want or need and you can read whenever without them cluttering your home. It's also a great place to study ;o) xx|`|HF4ofA3Haa	Bookstores! Because i like taking books at home with me, they're like my babies, my puppies (tell me i'm crazy i won't contradict you!) i need to buy them, so that i can't look at them in my room, know i can lend them, read them every hour of every day, even if i'll live 1000 years i'll always have them and if i want to read a book or just a piece of it one more time i can do it rightaway! I spend a lot -too much- on books but i can't help it it's like i'm addicted to it! I like so much buying books...

Great because if I get a book I don't like I can just return it. Problem is, I often find a book I love and want to keep it, then can't find it in any book stores because they book has stopped being printed or something. <br>  <br>  So I guess it's a tie.<br>  <br>  <br>  sdj x|`|5r9DmOmfaa	Both.......but bookstores are cool because they also have tons of different things.

It was just serving as a distraction. <br>  <br>  The theme of your story seems to revolve around Helen's having to adjust to her new life in California, to her new surroundings and experiences. Maybe by focusing your attention on this theme you could come up with a fitting title.<br>  <br>  Imagine that you're trying to teach somebody something through your story. Discovering what that something actually is often helps you to find a nice title and also gives your story a dynamic purpose. <br>  <br>  For example:<br>  <br>  Maybe you could be teaching somebody how difficult it is to cope with such an emotional upheaval. If so, then you might like the title, " A difficult Journey." <br>  <br>  This title would approach your story form two angles - the actual physical journey to California, and also the difficult emotional journey for Helen.<br>  <br>  You don't need to choose this example, of course, but it does serve to illustrate how how helpful thinking about the purpose of your story can be.<br>  <br>  A word of warning though - Don't try to be too clever. Such dramatic titles as : 'California blues,' etc, could be over the top and cause your readers to feel cheated. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck.|`|zFvy4V43aa	Kidnapped In California<br>  Love in California<br>  Don't Kno Relli
gb9REJN4aa	This may sound crazy, but I actually think it's more to do with habit than anything else. I mean, it may be that you hate your work, in which case by all means I'd say try to find something new to do. But I actually think that when I am just sitting around doing nothing for long stretches on end, it's because I'm not in the habit of getting up, going off and reading, or biking around, or practicing the piano, or whatever. And things like watching TV, or putzing around on the internet, are really easy, so they're easy habits to fall into. But I suspect if you make a schedule of what you'll do every day for two weeks (downtime included--I don't mean make a terrible schedule--make one you'll enjoy!) and then you stick to it, you'll get yourself into a much more productive mode. Anyway, that has worked for me.

Right now, it is a desert in this matter for you.  You feel like stagnating.  It is normal.  In the same time, it means that you need to re-evaluate what you are doing and also how your surrounding is.  Look around you. Is there something that makes you feel un-motivated?  Is there something you would like to change before you return to your normal active you?  Is it a sign that your current work and projects are not satisfying you?  You chose the word "enthusiasm".  In Greek, this means to have God within you.  God as a divine inspiration and motivation.<br>  I think it is all temporary.  And you will have this enthusiasm again pretty soon.

kMIiOcTraa	Well look at it this way, you are starting off slow, but you'll pick up. As long as you are here on Earth,  there's an opportunity for you.|`|UvY1hX1Gaa	First things first are you trying to make yourself happy or are you trying to make parents etc. happy?  First mistake you can make is to try to fit in someone else's mold, you will never decide what YOU want to do if you are picking only in the context of what will please others. If you can pick something you love and make others in your life happy great! but let what you want come first. <br>    Most people go there whole lives not knowing what they want to do.  This has a lot to so with our society's belief that your job must fulfill your whole life. This is simply not true, you can always change your direction as your life changes as long as you get a flexible degree and periodically seek additional education. If you can't decide what you want to do think about why you can't decide.  Does the world just seem to full of options that interest you and you have trouble choosing the one and only "career" that will keep you happy for life?  Or, do you just not really want to do anything at all but relax and enjoy life?  <br>    Instead of trying to focus and conform into some mold of what society in general views as "having it together" invest your time in pursuing what you love to do.  With a little luck and imagination and a lot of effort and enthusiasm you can turn that into what you want to do.  Even if what you love to do is something basically frivolous like shopping, partying, or even reading you can channel that into a "grown up" endeavor.  For example if you like fashion and shopping you could become a buyer for a store, or a professional shopper for a corporation or individual.

But He does care what happens to us! He doesn't want us to drift through life without any meaning or purpose, nor does He want us to throw our lives away or destroy them. He loves us, and He knows all about us; Jesus said, "Even the very hairs of your head are all numbered" by God (Matthew 10:30).<br>  <br>  Never forget: God is far greater than we are. No, we can't imagine trying to keep track of every person on earth—but God can do it because He is greater than we are. The Bible says, "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts" (Isaiah 55:9).<br>  <br>  How do I know God loves us and cares about us? I know it because He sent His only Son into the world to save us and bring us back to Himself. Sin has separated us from God—but on the cross all our sins were placed on Christ, and He took the penalty we deserve. Yes, God loves us—and He loves you. Respond to His love today by giving your life to Christ. Then ask Him to show you His plan for your life, and He will.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	I don't think so.

At age ten, she had set herself three goals: to go to the farthest-away mountain, to see a gargoyle, and to marry a prince. When she hears a voice from the mountain calling her, she responds at once. She is to free the mountain from the evil that has controlled it for 200 years , find the missing Ring of Kings before the evil Master does, and return it to the Prince. Dakin charges ahead and does what must be done, mostly using her own courage but with some help from enchanted beings. In completing her quest, she also accomplishes her own goals, including getting her prince, although not a royal one. This book is less engrossing than Banks's very successful Indian in the Cupboard (Avon, 1982). Dakin is too good, and the outcome too predictable (her prince is an enchanted frog at the story's beginning). "<br>  <br>  "The Farthest-Away Mountain is a children's novel, first published in 1976[1], by Lynne Reid Banks, a British author.<br>  <br>  Dakin is a fifteen year old girl, who when she was small was asked what goals she has for her life. She responds that she will travel to the Farthest Away Mountain, meet and speak to a gargoyle, and marry a prince. Everyone that knows her laughs good naturally at her funny ideas but dismisses them as impossible. The Farthest Away Mountain is visible from their village, but no matter how long you walk towards it, you always remain the same distance away, and is covered with snow of every color but white. Everyone knows that gargoyles are nothing but stone statues, and the only prince around is unable to marry because the Ring of Kings has been lost for a very long time, and he can't marry until it has been found. Dakin bears the laughter of her family and friends, but is only more determined than ever to reach her goals.<br>  <br>  One morning, she wakes up early having heard someone call to her in her dreams. She looks out the window and sees the Farthest-Away Mountain nod. She takes that as a sign that the time has come to complete the three goals she set and so packs what she can before anyone else in the household wakes, and prepares to leave, taking with her a strange little bronze statue of a man sitting cross-legged. She doesn't know why she takes the statue except that it makes her feel less alone..."<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farthest-Away_Mountain" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Farthes...</a>

DvToP5h7aa	Romeo and Juliet.<br>  <br>  About Tybalt<br>  <br>  Tybalt, the "Prince of Cats," is a captivating character and almost always completely over-the-top. Mercutio, who hates Tybalt, gives him the “catty” nickname the "Prince of Cats." But it totally suits Tybalt. While Romeo can sometimes remind you of a bouncy and overeager puppy, Tybalt tends to stalk around proudly looking for fights. He doesn’t speak a single line that can’t be delivered in a snarl. Tybalt is not particularly deep, but he’s a lot of fun for the actor who gets to deliver his snappy one-liners and show off some impressive sword fighting skills. There’s no explanation for Tybalt’s aggressive behavior, although it seems possible that he’s so eager to fight because he wants to defend his reputation as the toughest of the Capulets. If there’s a personification of hate in the play, it’s Tybalt.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/character/literature/william-shakespeare/romeo-and-juliet/tybalt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...</a><br>  <br>  Tybalt's Timeline in the Story<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/timeline/literature/william-shakespeare/romeo-and-juliet/tybalt.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/timeline/literatur...</a>|`|tMk8CsGOaa	Quick-tempered.<br>  Proud.<br>  Arrogant.|`|TWwdE5Eeaa	Tybalt has a big ego, he is very cocky, and confident, but also caring. and he has a sense of humor.

uPVnqbE8aa	If you've got the money, the absolute best  you can buy is the Nikon D3.  I've been using the D2X, but will soon be getting a D3.  The motor, and downloading capabilities into the camera's buffer, are what counts, and these two cameras do it well.<br>  A fast, large capacity flash memory card helps too.<br>  Depending on the kind of wildlife you do will determine which would be the best lenses for you to use.  If you're doing macro, then Nikon has a good line of macro lenses to choose from.  If you're shooting animals you can't get close to then look into their long telephoto lenses and a very good tripod.  If you're doing set-up shots, then a moderate zoom, like the 18-70mm will work fine, along with at least 4 good Nikon strobes.<br>  Just make sure to shoot everything in RAW for maximum quality.|`|3f138f62611335ca1d21ee4e397a935caa	For wildlife photography, a SLR with a zoom lens is probobly your best bet. I just bought a Nikon D90, and I love it, however if you;re looking at getting started, a D60, or Canon Rebel XTi is a sure bet. Then by the biggest lens you can afford (a 70-300mm Zoom is a good bet, and might set you back $300-$600). Pro's use lenses costing up to $12,000, but unless you've won a lottery a 300mm lens is a good place to start.
AA11081968	The 5 year plan was a reform to industrialize the Soviet Empire from a mostly agrarian society to an industrialized nation. This process was initiated by V. Lenin to bring the USSR into the 20th century as a modern example of communism in the model of Karl Marx, the author of Das Capital. The backdrop was that all societies go through a period of change: <br>  1) Primitive 2) Slave-owning 3) Feudal 4) Capitalist 5) Communist<br>  <br>  After Lenin's death Stalin took over the party and made some changes. He collectivized all the farms and eliminated the kulaks, or wealthy land owners. All educated classes were purged or made to work in the fields, or they were sent over to Siberia to be worked to death in the Gulags. The Holodomor of 1933 and again in 1937 was a systematic purge of the Ukranians to eliminate any groundswell of nationalist fervor that was starting at that time. Other ethnic groups suffered as well but the main impetus was put on the Ukraine as it was the bredbasket of Europe. The grains and foods produced were shiped out from the Ukraine and sent to the cities, Moscow, Kiev, Bratsk, Lvov, Odessa. The farmers whom produced the crops were left with nothing ans slowly starved to death. After 1941, Stalin realized that he needed manpower to fight the Nazi's and stopped the programs.|`|cwJrCcguaa	They generally died because of incompetence.

yvyewZrWaa	1. The intriguing characters were definitely the main reason why I was hooked. The narrator was someone I really sympathized and identified with and I was eager to find out more about her. I also wanted to learn more about Maxim and Rebecca, because he was so very mysterious (especially in those first six chapters). The characters are effective in drawing the reader in because they are a little cryptic and odd, and yet maintain a sense of realism.<br>  2. Du Maurier's beautiful writing style was another aspect of the novel that kept me going. It can be difficult to find a truly well-written book. I think part of the appeal of her style is that her vivid descriptions of the sights, the scents, the sounds make the reader feel as though they're there. The poetry in her writing - but also little sprinklings of humor - really enhance the story.<br>  3. By starting the book with a scene that takes place after all of the events at Manderley, I felt compelled to learn why the de Winters weren't living there, what happened to them, all that stuff. "Rebecca"'s first paragraph is pretty damn good - it captured me instantly.  <br>  <br>  Those are the things that got me hooked, anyway. I also knew beforehand that it was a 1930s retelling of "Jane Eyre", and I love that book, so I was partial to "Rebecca" probably even before I opened to the first page.|`|DvToP5h7aa	Rebecca - Daphne du Maurier<br>  <br>  Chapters 1-4 Summary<br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/rebecca/section1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/rebecca/se...</a><br>  <br>  Chapters 5-7 Summary<br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/rebecca/section2.rhtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/rebecca/se...</a><br>  <br>  =====================================<br>  <br>  Study Guides <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/rebecca/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/rebecca/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/rebecca-novel-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/rebecca-nov...</a><br>  <br>  Review:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dumaurier.org/reviews-rebecca.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dumaurier.org/reviews-rebecca...</a>

QbLLwTb2aa	wow! that sounds cool... not too sure about the first bit- the other side as you called it- but hey its your story and i liked the rest, especially the part where he drifts off to his death, very touching.<br>  not sure really who could play Jane, but the first person who came to my mind to play Daniel was Hugh Dancy (look at him in Evening and few other of his films- he may have been in so called 'bad films' but his acting is really superb. check out Elizabeth I on youtube- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5DIPPwDGmc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5DIPPwDG...</a> ) <br>  or Ryan Gosling. they're both really good actors. <br>  anyway, good luck with everything!|`|fo5AsHYZaa	did you write this?<br>  too short to be a movie.|`|fkTb2TiYaa	sorry, --but i didn't and i don't think anyone else will, read this story. its kinda long

Lewis. You could start with the most famous, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. These books are read by kids and adults alike. They are an easy read and are short in length, but they do have in-depth undertones and meanings that can be enjoyed by older readers.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|SEivoKLraa	I second everything RobReads said, and would also like to recommend you both check out some graphic novels. My girls really like BabyMouse, and my boys like Bone and Magic Pickle, but there are thousands of stories with different themes, just like with regular books. They're great practice for reading. You might also enjoy The Invention of Hugo Cabret, if you like mysteries and old-timey stuff. It's a huge book size-wise, but very readable and a lot of illustration.|`|cOUvCZCraa	Well this may sound cliche, but seriously I say the Harry Potter Series because they are wonderful.  I'm 21 and love them! Really funny, creative, and keep you wanting to read more.  Also the Twilight series, again very popular but I really liked them as well.

vmmMqhxXaa	"A separate peace" is a military phrase used when one nation refuses to fight its ally's enemy, remaining aloof from the fray instead of getting involved.  The last line of the novel refers to "a separate peace," meaning a brief escape from the turmoil of the world.  Bear in mind, though, that Knowles describes this peace as momentary and illusory.  That's something the author of the article cited below seems to forget, although his insights are otherwise very perceptive.

4hsc6mUuaa	1) Dexter wants to marry Judy because she represents and is the embodiment of his ultimate dream.<br>  <br>  The beginning of the short story opens by conveying to the reader what the stuff of his goals and hopes are made of and in chapter two, Fitzgerald makes it concrete with words, "He [Dexter] wanted not association with glittering things and glittering people--he wanted the glittering things themselves." <br>  <br>  Fitzgerald uses this theme of a man's dreams and his disillusionment in many of his stories, and Dexter's love of the idea of Judy is a prime example.<br>  <br>  2) Judy treats men carelessly because to them, she is a symbol (never really a real, tangible being) of perfect beauty and to her, they are mere objects (ones with which she cannot fully be happy with) to use, love, and discard. <br>  <br>  Judy has a vulnerability that's a result from her hollowness, something she can't understand. She says to Dexter while crying, "I'm more beautiful than anyone else...why can't I be happy?" Judy Jones doesn't comprehend (or refuses to comprehend) that beauty is fragile, vain, and fleeting, and true happiness takes depth and struggle.<br>  <br>  3) Dexter proposes to Irene because, at a certain point, he knows that, while his time with Judy will have been the happiest and most appreciated time of his life, Judy is something impossible to own and hold.<br>  <br>  He isn't surrendering his dream entirely, just content to watch and marvel at it from afar; he understands that Judy would not be as good for his life as she was for this dream and he awknowledges this by courting Irene.<br>  <br>  ***None of my answers should be held as 100% accurate and are always disputable. WINTER DREAMS is an often-analyzed work and open to many different interpretations so I suggest that you take my answers only as a starting point and make your own conclusions from there.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

22132efd0ae9e4768626dff2c8c8bd8caa	I found one small part on her on page 48 of my book. (It might be different if you have a different edition) Right after the movies Johnny and Pony are in the lot. <br>  <br>  "<br>  Since I was dreaming I brought Mom and Dad back to life... Mom could bake some more chocolate cakes and Dad would drive the pickup out early to feed the cattle. He would slap Darry on the back and tell him he was getting to be a man, a regular chip off the block, and they would be as close as they used to be. Maybe Johnny could come and live with us, and the gang could come out on weekends, and maybe Dallas would see that there was some good in the world after all, and Mom would talk to him and make him grin in spite of himself. "You've got quite a mom," Dally used to say. "She knows the score." She could talk to Dallas and kept him from getting into a lot of trouble. My mother was golden and beautiful...   <br>  <br>  "<br>  <br>  Pony talks about the country and then he talks about her. <br>  <br>  Page 123, <br>  <br>  "I remembered my mother...beautiful and golden, like Soda, and wise and firm, like Darry,"<br>  <br>  At the hospital after Johnny's mother tries to visit him. <br>  <br>  Thats all I found.

She was skilled in the magic of metamorphosis, the power of illusion, and the dark art of necromancy. When Odysseus landed on her island she transformed his men into animals, but with the help of the god Hermes, he overcame the goddess and forced her to release his men from her spell.

I would Love 2 read More!!!!!|`|93CMl5tcaa	i dont have time to read the whole thing but i read the first couple paragraphs and thought they were veryy well writen and cought my attention well. i will add more after i read it all. good job.|`|944a14c77cfd5df8decc7beffcf31f38aa	Well, I did read the whole thing so you managed to get me interested, despite the fact that I hate books that focus on a school setting, seriously I think your in school right? Yet you wrote a book with school as a setting? Do you like school? I personally hate school, with a deep passion, such that I would probably NEVER write anything involving a school, or at least not a normall school (and no not a vampire school or witch/wizard/zombie/superhero/robot/anim... school either.... so no school)<br>  <br>  Okay besides that..... which the point of that is me saying this "Write what you want to write about" I don't want to write about a school so I would never use a school setting, ever.... so yeah. Okay next:<br>  <br>  When you described the four girls I really think you shouldn't have first of all it's too much for the reader. I was pretty confused especially because you used name brands, (You lost me at Cruella Deville by the way) DON'T DO STUFF LIKE THAT! Try as hard as you can to not use name brands like converse, or over description like this "A wonderful pink prada bag, and a matching set of pink designer heels" it's too much, but whatever... again too much description and also THERE;S FOUR, do you expect the reader to remember each one so suddenly? You really shouldn';t describe each on in detail.... it's too much.<br>  <br>  Other than that I don't know I mean I read it, somehow it got me interested, and I've actually read books that are published that this seems to put to shame, lol, so whatever :)|`|AVYBazOEaa	Very amazing!<br>  Well done I truly want to read on!!! x<br>  When this is published you have to me seriously

djQ6UyzIaa	It's not really my style of book, but I've got to be honest with you, THAT WAS GREAT!<br>  <br>  It was not confusing, I found no mistakes and I really liked it. I do, however think that long strands of dialogue are a general (for lack of a better word) no-no so have your characters stop and think more often. Other than that, I would like to read more.<br>  <br>  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!|`|IHEdxoIpaa	It was interesting. <br>  so, i'm guessing Alex and Kaleb are linked together somehow?<br>  i don't think it caught my attention enough to read more though...|`|YDtSz60oaa	You got me interested! Well written too. you should put it on <a href="http://www.fictionpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fictionpress.com/</a> you would get lots of readers and reviewers on there.
l9Xg8Dv4aa	Britanny, come down from the tree and talk with me.<br>  What is your story about? The Le Lune Blue is an interesting Restaurant! Is it about the restaurant business?<br>   Evelyn has a good heart! I am sure she has hired Waitresses who are escaping bad situations and need work.<br>  Mason, well Mason seems to be drinking straight from a mason jar. Is the Story about him?( and drinking stale alcohol)<br>  I see different ways you could be headed, especially since Evelyn "Blew up in his face" and maybe sent him packing. Is the story about that?<br>  O.K. Go back up into the tree and answer those questions and then you will know where to go with it.<br>  Do not feel as though you have to use off-colored words to make a point. Your readers are able to sense whenever you detail. (Wink:)

The fact that I don't see any reason to believe that he does and my wife accepts the existence without question does not change the fact a bit.  Either God exists or he doesn't.<br>  <br>  We are being bombarded with grey areas between truth and non-truth.  Those touchy feely people among us would have us believe there is no absolute, only grey areas.  As I said earlier truth is absolute.  It is a bit like being pregnant or dead.  You can't be a little bit pregnant or almost dead, you either are or you aren't.<br>  <br>  Opinions can be argued.  You may seek and perhaps even find what you believe to be true.  However, that belief is either correct or incorrect based on the actual truth of the issue.

qThmcR1Aaa	I could go on for hours about the insults to the English language that go on at this place all day. I'm a copy editor and a grammar nut, so I know exactly how you feel.<br>  <br>  It amazes me how some of these people can get through school barely able to even spell their own name. Some of the questions on here are so poorly worded (or badly misspelled) that I can't even understand what's being asked.<br>  <br>  And of course, this stuff doesn't happen just here. As others have pointed out, it's infecting our entire society. Those pharmaceutical ads are notorious for botching parallel constructions in their long disclaimer sentences. And if I see another incorrect usage of "due to," I think I'll scream. It's not a synonym for "because of." It's an adjective phrase. It means "caused by." It answers "what," not "why." Grrrr.<br>  <br>  Bless you for caring. You get a star.|`|810513944bc1fc28c514a617993b162faa	I tend not to say anything.<br>  If they can't be bothered to use proper punctuation then that's their business, really...<br>  'Your' instead of 'you're' is like a thorn in my side, though.|`|TU7vDI95aa	I agree; people here are completely massacring the English language!|`|la9zji2Uaa	I know it really bug's me? x|`|XxtVwslraa	I absolutely agree with you. People think that I'm crazy when I say that text speak is ruining the english language. It's starting to creep into formal writing and one country actually had a debate trying to decide whether or not to allow it in formal writing. WHAT!! How they could possibly consider such an insane idea is beyond me. I'm a Creative Writing major so I like my words the way the dictionary has them. It's upsetting to see them any other way.|`|Tyj0gtqZaa	A lot of people don't know how to spell or how to fix their grammatical mistakes.  It's not that they're dumb, they are just lazy and don't want to do it.  This is on the internet after all.  Not very many people use correct grammar on the internet, makes it faster and easier to talk that way.|`|RrvJ99uaaa	"The grammar crime: Indicating possession is not a crime in itself; however, inappropriately indicating possession is."<br>  <br>  See the ten "most wanted" grammar errors below.|`|C1MZBjWpaa	It really bugs me. My worst pet peeve with apostrophes is on menus when they put<br>  burrito's<br>  taco's <br>  And also it's to show possession. Like "that is it's bowl."|`|vNDV3BMEaa	Lolz, I'm the same =P<br>  It really winds me up, ok, we all make the odd mistake, but some people are ridiculous...<br>  Oh and use of the spell checker???<br>  Sometimes I have no idea what people are on about =/<br>  <br>  sdj x|`|BzMQejGxaa	Oh, apostrophes at the end of things which are plural!

Finally, someone who is on my side!|`|TWsxP46Qaa	oh i know how to use them i just cant be bothered !<br>  <br>  if i'm writing my grammar improves dramatically,but if i'm just sitting here typing in YA i dont bother too much about punctuation marks of any kind usually,it doesnt take the Brain of Britain to work out what the words are without the apostrophes|`|EnHLX6bOaa	So many times have I seen the comma (,) used as an apostrophe. Such as: they,re or isn,t or you,re.<br>  It doesn't even make sense when they write it like that! I wonder if anyone knows where the apostrophe key is...|`|SFd9fLGBaa	I know how you feel, it annoys me when people don't use them. Although depending on my mood i will use punctuation but if im tired or stressed out i just dont bother.|`|HhW5lf8Daa	What is your question? Good for you to speak your mind out about what's going on and I agree with you. I get that you are some grammar freak, but what can you do if people decide not to use apostrophes? Maybe they are in a rush and forgot to proofread. Technically, it's not English class, but you cannot criticize someone for typing without care online. It's not fair to judge someone like that, because you do not know them. Maybe they are great writers, you never know and I agree with Katelyn for that. It makes it easier to type and maybe there are people who cannot type fast. (I know many that can't.) Don't get mad over something silly as that. The only time you should be complaining would be when you cannot understand what they are saying. "lYKe ZoMG hE CaMe Ovur YusterDAY eNd wE hD sO mUUUUcH FuNNN!" Something like that. (It takes more time trying to understand how to type that stuff than normally. I wonder how people do that?)<br>  So let's see <br>  "Im tired."<br>  "I'm tired." <br>  You still know what they are trying to say. And that mistake right there does not show them not knowing how to write. I had an English teacher when I was younger and he doesn't perfect himself online. He would use "u" instead of "you." But he knows English and is very good at it.|`|6Ss31wyBaa	'yeah' 'it' 'is' 'kind' 'of' 'annoying'|`|9Duha1k4aa	I get what you mean. Well, sort of. If everyone in our generation stops using apostrophes, then in the future, they will be something of a myth. <br>  <br>  If apostrophes don't exist, people will move on to taking grammar out of the English. So, instead of people saying "I'm hungry" in the future, they will be saying "me hungry". Have we passed the peak of human civilisation already?

oXCo6VX4aa	You can easily buy that kind of paper in A4 sizes at any Staples, Office Depot, etc...  It's just glossy paper.  Different magazines are printed on different paper weights, the lower the number the thinner the paper.  Usually if you buy it at an office supply store it's called flyer or brochure paper, make sure you get it in gloss because they sell it in matte too.

2HETgiwgaa	People who've had strokes or other trauma to their brains can sometimes forget and have to learn again.  I don't think it would be possible to forget otherwise - and very difficult to test as a theory because, as you point out, words are everywhere so there wouldn't be a chance to avoid reading altogether if you are living in the western world.|`|HkXYGAOdaa	No.  That's impossible.  That would be like forgetting to breath!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Not like that, no.<br>  <br>  But it's a fairly common symptom of some forms of stroke. In that case it's instant. The part of the brain which the sufferer used for reading is destroyed, and they have to learn all over again.|`|x38sIvyxaa	No, I don't think so. One of my friends claims that she forgets how to read when she's sick, but she's exaggerating.<br>  I think your reading skills can decrease after a long period of time. However, unless your mind has been seriously damaged, I don't think you can forget how to read.|`|d7a221dc65e9541431ba88edec210e7aaa	i don't think so... maybe if the person had a stroke or brain tumor...<br>  <br>  i certainly hope not tough, i read the toothpaste while brushing and the shampoo while washing hair!!|`|5uzHW4CYaa	Honestly..

It could very well be possible because we don't know how to read when we are born, we gradually learn. Afterward, I suppose that they could learn how to read again.. I am not sure if it is possible though. Your reading ability can decrease, as mentioned above, if you do not read for many years.|`|AA11806718	I dont think its possible to forget how to read with all the things we have to read in society on a daily basis.  <br>  I would never say never though.

N86vHKxtaa	Preservation of fresh food for a longer period of time (allowing for transportation before consumption) is a problem as old as humanity.  "Refrigeration" in colonial times consisted of using sawdust and ice to keep things cool in the summer heat.  The obvious drawback that the refrigerator solved was that you could only get more ice during the winter freeze and had to preserve it in your ice house until next winter.|`|NR3YnkVPaa	Geeez, can't you think of an answer to your own simple question? Why invent the refrigerator? Maybe to keep your beer and soda cold and stop the chicken from going bad so fast, and so you could keep some ice cream at home and not have to go out every time you want a  little bowl of it.

SPQdFOwKaa	Yeah, keep down the same path. Having characters representing the seven deadly sins is quite original and -well- quite brilliant. I kinda hate your for thinking it before me! But keep it thus, it's a pretty wonderfully-thought concept.|`|TU7vDI95aa	I absolutely love the idea of making each of the kids represent a different deadly sin, but I think the story you've written for Oscar will make him represent lust a bit more than gluttony.|`|CUMnu0OXaa	I love the idea of seven deadly sins!<br>  But I am not sure about Oscar. You say he is meant to have the sin of Gluttony but you make him sound more like a murderer.<br>  Maybe think around the gluttony idea.<br>  Sarah is good though! But if you take my advice you should make her give the murderer a heart attack. I think it would fit the plot of the seven deadly sins better.|`|Tyj0gtqZaa	Don't tell anyone your using the seven deadly sins.  Make the reader figure it out.

02JUswskaa	A writer uses personification to give human traits to ideas or  objects. <br>  <br>  It helps by making it easier for the reader to identify with them. It makes the objects or ideas more lively and understandable, and also helps the writer to convey much more information and control the reader's interpretation.<br>  <br>  For instance:<br>  <br>  A writer could say: " The apple was red. "  or , " The apple had bright rosy cheeks."<br>  <br>  The second example uses personification.

Two in particular, The Weirdstone of Brisingamen and The Owl Service, are very good, bringing the supernatural in but in a slow dramatic way so the tension build through the books.

EHrbDq0naa	I've read your other two posts as well and have enjoyed all.<br>  <br>  Okay, all personal opinion here: <br>  <br>  Without knowing more of this story -- is there more? -- this one sounds an awful lot like the scene from the move "Dragonheart" with Dennis Quade, when the prince's mother goes to the dragon (voice of Sean Connery) to beg for his help in saving her son. Of course, she doesn't die, but that's beside the point.<br>  <br>  This appears to be an excerpt from a larger piece. If it isn't, it should be. It doesn't tell enough of the story to stand alone.<br>  <br>  Your punctuation is a bit off. Commas, I see, are your demons, as they are sometimes mine. <br>  <br>  Verse 2, I'd strike the comma after the word being.<br>  Verse 3, I'd take them all out.<br>  Verse 4, take out the one at the end of line 2 (after hope)<br>  Verse 5 needs a bit of a rewrite. As it reads now, it would be better written using standard dialog format:  "Save him!" she demanded...  (and perhaps change the word command to plead?)  Then, "You must!" she whispered...   <br>  <br>  Side note: I don't know if you realize there are other sites much better suited for sharing your work.

shVgCizBaa	American Century is a term coined by Time publisher Henry Luce used to claim the historical role of the United States during the 20th century.[1] Luce, the son of a missionary, in a 1941 Life magazine editorial urged the United States to forsake isolationism for a missionary's role, acting as the world's Good Samaritan and spreading democracy. According to David Harvey, Luce believed "the power conferred was global and universal rather than territorially specific, so Luce preferred to talk of an American century rather than an empire."[2] He also called upon the U.S. to enter World War II to defend democratic values:<br>  <br>  Throughout the 17th century and the 18th century and the 19th century, this continent teemed with manifold projects and magnificent purposes. Above them all and weaving them all together into the most exciting flag of all the world and of all history was the triumphal purpose of freedom.<br>  <br>  It is in this spirit that all of us are called, each to his own measure of capacity, and each in the widest horizon of his vision, to create the first great American Century.[3]<br>  <br>  Today, it is usually used to illustrate United States dominance of much of the 20th century, beginning with the Spanish-American War and the important role played by the United States in World War II, continuing on through the Cold War status of the United States as one of the world's two superpowers, and ending with the role of the United States as sole superpower on from the 1990s. It refers not only to the political influence of the United States, but also its economic influence, as many states around the world would over the course of the 20th century adopt the economic policies of the Washington Consensus, and its cultural influence.<br>  <br>  Critics of the term regard it as overemphasizing the role played by the United States on the world stage.<br>  <br>  The name of the thinktank Project for the New American Century implicitly suggests that the 20th century was an American Century and that a goal of the thinktank is to make the 21st century also an American Century.<br>  <br>  With the advent of the new millennium, critics have been proposing the death of the American Century, most famously the late gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson who titled his autobiography Kingdom Of Fear: Loathsome Secrets of A Star Crossed Child in the Last Days of the American Century.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Century" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_America...</a>

09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	Unless you want to self-publish your book, in which case you must assume all responsibility for the results as well as for all of the expenses involved, it will be very difficult for you to find a mainstream publisher willing to buy your book.  As the first answerer suggested, purchase a copy of "Writer's Market" which will provide you much valuable information regarding the publishing process, as well as with lists of publishing companies interested in children's literature.  Mainstream publishers rarely (or never) accept unsolicited manuscripts, so doubtlessly you will need to employ a literary agent to represent you in the process; you will find agents listed, too, in the book.  However, if you are previously unpublished and unknown in the literary community, you must be prepared to be rejected, unfortunately -- even those authors who are currently writing best-sellers often experienced rejections in the past.  I have self-published two novels through Xlibris ( <a href="http://www.xlibris.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.xlibris.com</a> ) if you would be interested in exploring that possibility.  Xlibris is a subsidiary of Random House and is legitimate, although their books by amateur writers are not truly respected in the publishing world.  Additionally, you will need to market your own book, paying for the company's marketing material if you prefer to go that route.  Publishing packages can range from about $500 to many thousands depending upon what you want, what corrections you make, and  which "add-ons" you desire.  You will be able to have much control over your book, including the selection of fonts, the creation of your cover, and illustrations.  I have been pleased with the results; mine are adult novels, however.  The easiest way to succeed in selling your project is to be a celebrity!  Nevertheless, good luck with whatever you do!|`|IFL3GcM9aa	I agree with the person who said to find publishers in Writer's Market.  You can also find the address and phone number of the publisher on the back of the title page of books like the one you want to publish.  They usually have info with the copyright information.  If you call the switchboard, you can ask them what their submission policy is.  Usually they will tell you the name of an editor or assistant who will want to see a query letter.  (Most will not want to see the whole book.)<br>  <br>  For advice on how to write a query letter, read this article:<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4802852_write-query-letters-book-manuscript.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4802852_write-qu...</a>|`|hPt0hLyXaa	You need to get a copy of Writer's Market and look through it or search up on the internet for Children's Authors. Find a few near where you live and search them up on the internet. You need to make sure that they are good publishers, you like them and they are what you are looking for, vice versa. If something seems fishy, ask several people about them. Now for a children's book, I don't know if you need a query letter, or what part of the manuscript you send. This site offers a tutorial or something of the sort on how to publish a children's book. I hope that this helps you!<br>  <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?id=WdQumhLIDAIC&dq=how+to+publish+a+children%27s+book&printsec=frontcover&source=bl&ots=0ONTC4AB3i&sig=3CYklZHWu93A4FJBsz_cbgc0Uf4&hl=en&ei=7OSySav9FIr0MpHIqOQE&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPP1,M1" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.ca/books?id=WdQumhLI...</a>
ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	You may want to check out Shmoop on To Kill A  Mockingbird.

429093af889ade4be8f7e7ce8b917485aa	Its a subject that is not taught in history books or school, and still something never publicized...In Canada, Italian-Canadians, and Ukrainian-Canadians, and "other Europeans/European-Canadians" were interned in camps in some places in Montreal, Toronto, etc...<br>  Recently, some of this has been briefly exposed, in a CBC TV documentary-drama of treatment of Italian-Canadians in Montreal, and a Historic Plaque admitting to concentrating Ukrainian-Canadians, and "other Europeans/European-Canadians" in crowded quarters at the CNE grounds...well guess just which "other Europeans/European-Canadians" would be considered suspect, potential enemies?  They still won't admit it explicitly in historical documents, books, historic plaques.  Even after the war, child members of my family were pelted with big rocks at school and called names.  They would make new friends who quickly dumped and became hostile bullies when they found out German heritage, and were intimidated from normal success habits and normal school and social and career ambitions allowed only non-Germans.  Its invisible segregation and harassment that was ignored or considered justified, but not justified for the individuals trying to live a normal successful life like anyone else wants to do.  <br>  <br>  I see more famous German-heritage names in USA professional jobs in government, business, and almost none in Canada.  I think they might have been treated and still treated better in the USA than in Canada.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Here take a look at this,  there is a website with info you're looking for:<br>  World War II - The internment of German American civilians <br>  <a href="http://www.foitimes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.foitimes.com/</a>|`|AA12095483	How were Germans treated in America during Nazi Germany? <br>  What do you mean? The Nazis weren't in America. <br>  The Nazi party came into being  in 1920 and most Americans weren't even aware that it existed. That remained the case all during the 1920s and well into the 1930s. It wasn't until around 1936 and 37, when Hitler began making noises about annexing German territory, that the world even realized the Nazi party existed. <br>  WW2 erupted in 1939, but not for the US. They waited for three more years before they joined the Allies - and the only reason they did so was because the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. <br>  The US was far more concerned about Japanese nationals in their country, than they were about people of German descent. <br>  The US army was filled with people of German ancestry - and no one called soldiers names. They didn't go through anything at all. The Japanese who lived within 100 miles of the coast were interned and shipped to camps farther inland. But there were no repercussions against people of German descent.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	German-Americans were of course shunned. People with names like Eisenhower couldn't get a job.

There are however such things as E-books which are very cheap on amazon and if you have a credit card you could be reading in seconds. There are also audio books which are also very cheap and easy to get online. If you can't afford the book new just go to a used book store if there's one in your area.

qWuYaW6Paa	you have an opinion? i'm proper jealous|`|yOK32PM9aa	Paula hits on a truth when she says that infidelity is a major cause.  Jealousy is different from envy in that it involves fear of losing a love object (usually a person) to another, a "rival".  As such, I think it is likely to become a bigger problem as serial partnerships increase - going from one relationship to another as the norm.  This means that people will often have cause for anxiety.  "Am I as good as their last partner?"  "Are they looking for someone new?".  It is a very big problem, and can lead to lots of situations: withdrawing from the partner for fear of being hurt; physically or mentally attacking the rival; and so on.|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	It is a huge problem in many lives, and it leads to anger and resentment, which is kind of like drinking poison and hoping someone else gets sick.|`|0lU0ndAxaa	ooh, jealousy can rear its ugly head in many ways, but the most common i think is in infidelity,  someone just thinking they are being cheated on can cause a tirade of different actions from depression to murder depending on the individual.|`|4645aa71c3188c549273f361b5b02ad7aa	The truth is that everyone feels jealousy at one point in their life, now, the way you handle jealousy is what differentiate you from the others.

xjBFwsVMaa	Have the background look like its aged maybe brownish yellow looking. You could do like a pie chart and have the sections be three equal sizes like a peace sign... make it dark black so they can tell that that's what it is. Make sure, however, that the civilizations were not at war with each other. Then draw a house representing what housing they lived in, a person, and some random objects that represent each civilization. Have a border around your poster to make it stand out. Also do not forget to label the civilizations by putting the name of it around the outside of the section it is.<br>  <br>  If your having to do an oral presentation leave the background blank as to not take away from it. Make the teacher/audience think you didnt do it but then have the pieces that go on it in your hand. As you talk about each part of the civilization you could either tape or use velcro to stick the pieces up. You want the audience to be interested in it.<br>  <br>  If neither one of these ideas work for you then have it like all three civilizations have been introduced and now are in one community. Have the people you draw from each be together "talking", the housing be grouped together, and maybe some of the items be grouped together. Make it look like everything belongs where it is even though they are very different.

ceBTTCPwaa	A Separate Peace is John Knowles' first published novel, released in 1959.<br>  <br>  The Threat of Codependency to Identity ~ The central relationship in the novel—that between Finny and Gene—involves a complex dynamic of seeking to establish, yet being uncomfortable with, identity. Early in the book, the boys' relationship seems fueled, in part, by Gene's envy and resentment of his friend's dominating spirit. As Finny demonstrates his physical prowess, Gene feels the need to accentuate his academic prowess. Finny's fall from the tree, however, apparently purges Gene of his darker feelings and steers their relationship in a different direction so that codependency rather than envy characterizes it. The scene immediately following the fall symbolizes this evolution, as Gene dresses in Finny's clothes and sees himself as looking exactly like him. From this point on, he and Finny come to depend on each other for psychological support. Gene plays sports because Finny cannot, allowing Finny to train him to be the athlete that Finny himself cannot be. This training seems an avenue for Finny simply to live vicariously through Gene. But Gene actively welcomes this attempt by Finny, for just as Finny derives inner strength from fulfilling his dreams through Gene, so, too, does Gene find happiness in losing his own self (which he seems to dislike) in Finny's self (which he likes very much). Thus, the boys' relationship becomes a model of codependency, with each feeding off of, and becoming fulfilled by, the other. This codependency preempts the development of their individual identities, perhaps dangerously: by living within their own private illusion that World War II is a mere conspiracy and continuing to believe that Gene (and Finny through him) will go to the Olympics and that the outside world can never curtail their dreams, the boys are refusing to grow up and develop their own ambitions and responsibilities. Not even Finny's death, though it separates them physically, can truly untangle Gene's identity from Finny's—he feels as though Finny's funeral is his own. In a sense, the reader realizes, the funeral is indeed Gene's own; so much of him is merged with Finny that it is difficult to imagine one boy continuing to exist without the other. It is perhaps only his ultimate understanding that Finny alone had no enemy that allows the older Gene to reestablish a separate identity—one that he considers, however, inferior to Finny's.<br>  <br>  The Creation of Inner Enemies ~ A Separate Peace takes place during wartime and is emphatically a novel about war—and yet not a single shot is fired in the course of the story, no one dies in battle, and only the unfortunate Leper even joins the military before graduation. Instead, Knowles focuses on the war within the human heart, a war that is affected by the events of World War II but exists independently of any real armed conflict. For Knowles—or at least for his narrator, Gene—every human being goes to war at a certain point in life, when he or she realizes that the world is a fundamentally hostile place and that there exists in it some enemy who must be destroyed. The novel implicitly associates this realization of the necessity of a personal war with adulthood and the loss of childhood innocence. For most of Gene's classmates, World War II provides the catalyst for this loss, and each reacts to it in his own way—Brinker by nurturing a stance of bravado, for example, and Leper by descending into madness.<br>  Gene himself, though, states that he fought his own war while at Devon and killed his enemy there. The obvious implication is that Finny, as the embodiment of a spirit greater than Gene's own, was his enemy, casting an unwave|`|xJoMSkI5aa	The setting of A Separate Peace – both time and place – are integral to the story and its meaning. As you'll read, well, everywhere in this guide, the backdrop of World War II establishes a series of parallels with the daily lives of the boys at Devon.

GcMdjREaaa	i would say during the Flapper Era of the 1920s because that was a very interesting turning point for America, where things such as sexually were embraced and drugs were common.<br>  i would also say that the 1960s might have been the high-point for smoking for women-or any age-group really, because of all of the TV ads, as well as radio, newspaper, magazines, etc advertisements. (and hippies of course. lol)|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	I would say the 20s women were 'liberated in the those years' they also took cocaine and dressed in trousers. Once the depression hit they stopped doing those things it cost too much money which they didn't have again until WWII.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Smoking was popular with both men and women when it first reached Europe in the 16th century.  I am not sure when exactly it became unacceptable for women to smoke, but certainly in the 19th century it was not something respectable women did.<br>  <br>  Smoking became acceptable for women again in the 1920s.  In fact, it wsa encouraged because dieting became a fad, and smoking helped women eat less. "Reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet" was a popular 20s advertising slogan.|`|AA11323749	It was mainly the 60's.<br>  <br>  There have always been some women who smoked whenever the custom existed, but in the U.S., smoking was rare for women in certain times.<br>  <br>  After World War II we saw more women smoking publicly but the real swing came in the 1960's.  I remember a television commercial for "Virginia Slims" (a cigarette marketed to women) that had a catchy theme song that concluded "You've got your own cigarette now, baby.  You've come a long, long way."<br>  <br>  There have been several studies that show that heart disease among women began to trend up significantly after an appropriate lag from the time many more women started smoking.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Probably in the 1920's. Back in the 60's and early 70's, before all cigarette commercials on TV were banned, one brand ran a bunch of commercials showing women around 1900 or 1910 getting arrested for smoking in public or things like that. In some cases it was illegal for women to smoke, but not men.<br>  <br>   But I think during the "Jazz Age" in the 20's and 30's it was common. By World War II, probably as many women as men were smoking.|`|h17TYupuaa	I think it was around the1890's, around frueds era.<br>  Cause I remember watching this documentary about advertizing and psychology, Cigarettes were considered dirty, though with the up[stage of voting and stuff cigarette companies thought it would be a good idea to sell to women. Which caused like massive uproar and it was all over the news.|`|rlqAgQ3Vaa	it was in the 1920's they were called the flappers they were rebels|`|AOtnoozdaa	I'd say around the 1920's, because that's when most of the cigarette companies came into existence, and it got to a point where cigarettes were in the mainstream and everybody who was everybody smoked because it was "the thing to do"  People were so naive and unaware back then about the negative affects of smoking.  It's always been targeted towards women, because when you think of a flapper you stereotypically think of her with a elongated cigarette in her hand or on her lip.|`|qO6LFINTaa	Cigarrettes are good no matter what (IF YOU SMOKE) but obviously a male Upper - Class thing to begin with, male upper-class wives took over, about 1920's i'm guessing|`|BKbS9Ccjaa	1950's or 40's can't remember.|`|dSLCH5gHaa	im guessing 60-70s, but the flappers in the early 1900s are the ones who pretty much started doing it.|`|AhBJT5xFaa	When men started smoking. When cigarettes were glamorous in movies.... :)|`|gAV1nZymaa	the year 1715 at Vincennes (Indiana)
35GfsJ3Paa	No! Not if you want the corks of you clarinet to last, that it. Cork grease is not chapstick. Chapstick should not be used as cork grease. They are two different substances.<br>  <br>  If you are out of cork grease, use a VERY small amount of plain vaseline. It doesn't take a whole lot.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	No No No No No.<br>  <br>  It's not intended for cork, and there are other additives with the petroleum jelly. It's not good for the wood, it's not good for the cork, its not even good for a resin body instrument.|`|CUMdhfKzaa	Um.  This is the English site.  Go to the bottom of the screen for whatever country's language you're using.|`|2Dpg3jKyaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  But.....<br>  <br>  Just go buy cork grease. Its not too expensive to buy. I got 4 of them for free by asking my music instructor.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if they have the store Sam Ash anywhere else. But Sam Ash Music Store is a good place for cheap stuff.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	It should, works great for greasing the leather pump on a coleman stove and lantern.|`|qkiNLmPeaa	lol. mine frnd tried it and it worked just about the same. plus it has a scent to it. x]|`|pTG1JuDbaa	yes|`|fXAmnWTyaa	Yeah. Just make sure you get unscented/flavored. The flavored kinds contain sugars and will start to make keypads on your instrument stick, even from just applying it to the cork!|`|m7MhXTP8aa	Might be a little thin for long term use, but in a pinch, I don't see where it would hurt things.|`|wa47F7DLaa	yea i did it all the time with my saxaphone plus it smells minty|`|25mllixyaa	It probably will|`|sp1TB35Kaa	I guess.

You are describing the boredom of a "picture perfect" town, but obviously it is falling short in some other way(s).|`|09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	I can't find anything seriously wrong with your prologue; it seems to indicate that indeed something extraordinary is about to occur in that town --  a sort of "be careful what you wish for" alert to the reader.  My advice:  Continue writing the story; you can always return to tweak the prologue later if you feel the need; really, you're writing a rough draft, anyway, until your story is as perfect as you can make it.  Just go ahead creating your plot; see how it goes.  Don't become hung up on the prologue.  Good luck!

8ivnzNi5aa	The GAR started as a social organization for Civil War veterans.  The Legion started, I believe after the First World War, for a similar reason.  I'll bet that Wikipedia can provide more accurate information on the subject.

Yes, some people try to get others to be alright with something bad just to make them feel better about it but this is a definite wrong answer. We are not animals to succumb to the slightest whim of physical passion. That is for the savage and uncivilized who do not think and have no self restraint. It is our duty to overcome the pushes of our being.|`|VM9Vsf9naa	If it's an altruistic passion to benefit everyone (no harm done to others), then just follow your inspirations.<br>  <br>  If it's merely a selfish passion, take a deep breath and jump under the cold shower, lol.<br>  <br>  ;- )|`|pTlnCNYJaa	If your passion is the type that doesnt harm anyone else than go for it. Its our passion that keeps our souls burning and spirits alive providing its for good.

KBBonf97aa	Good singers are a dime a dozen, so the best thing you could do is learn to play an instrument so you can write songs.  Building a music career is a process so you have to do the ground work.  Record companies are only interested in signing acts that can draw crowds, so you have to get yourself into a situation where you're performing regularly.  For most singers, that means either playing solo acoustic shows or joining/forming a band.<br>  <br>  Most bands won't consider taking on a singer who hasn't shown serious dedication to music, so knowing how to play an instrument would demonstrate that you're not just another wannabe.  A band wants a singer who can make a legitimate contribution to the group, rather than someone who just wants to be famous.  Most singers who don't play an instrument or write songs won't get past the first audition, since the world is filled with people looking to use a band as their rocket to stardom.  You'll be competing with singers who not only play guitar, bass and piano, but have also taken the time to write songs.  I've been in quite a few bands and we never considered taking on a singer just because he/she had a good voice, since most people can memorize lyrics and sing fairly well.  Music is about much more than showing up with lyrics memorized, singing for a while, and then going home.  <br>  <br>  If you really want to be a singer, you should buy a guitar, learn to play, and try writing songs.  Nothing happens overnight, so be prepared to invest years in becoming a musician.  Even then, the odds of you becoming a star are very small.  Music is something people pursue as a passion, not because they want celebrity.  If you're not willing to start at the bottom and demonstrate that you have both talent and commitment, you'll never be taken seriously.|`|1aXaXUYUaa	get out there and audition for things. Anything that has tto do with music . . get out there!|`|kbJRRRp7aa	Life isn't about the end result its about the journey. Getting into the music business/band thing is not easy. Its a job that can really stress you out. You have to be prepared and expect it to be difficult or you will only put yourself down things get hard. If you want to get into vocals than I would recommend lessons. Then record yourself. Do Karaoke then find people who share your interests and build it up.|`|qVCUgKfAaa	practice in public
8fb24b6f111df0e972bbf73b72eb81d3aa	Elitism has unfortunately been a intricate part of most historical civilisations. The notion that rulers had been appointed by deities is a simple example.<br>  <br>  Another relatively easy example is to look at some of the Victorian Social theories like "Functionalism" - being the mind set that there is a place for everything - eg the "function" of poverty is to buy all 2nd hand products.<br>  <br>  .|`|KHSOVxViaa	It's human nature.<br>  <br>  Wealth means resources, people value and want resources.  We're cooperative animals, so we interact with others.  If certain people have resources, they can trade them for other things they want.  In human society, that means a certain amount of power.  More resources, more power.<br>  <br>  I can't think of any period in history where the rich *weren't* treated differently from the poor.  Usually the rich were top dogs, using their resources to pull stings and arrange many things as they wished.  Sometimes, such as in a revolution, the rich would be targetted by unhappy and angry poor, and their resources confiscated or themselves killed.<br>  <br>  It's only in the modern era, with the advent of accountability and democracy, that some of the differences have been ironed out.  While being rich can buy you more things and benefit social status, it doesn't get you any more votes or the ability to choose a government.  If you've committed a crime, it won't get you off or freed.<br>  <br>  The difference for the rich is now.

AA10092510	No because if you eat to much of the wrong thing it will kill you.<br>  For instants salt, you'll die from hi blood pressure. If you overdue anything you can die from it, and if that's the case everyone would be suicidal.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	Nothing can stop death, therefore life itself is considered suicide.|`|pTlnCNYJaa	Depends on how you look at it, your putting yourself up for suicide the minute you get on your car or walk across the road so yea I guess its how you look at it but I get the feeling that you're really asking where doe's one go if they do die by suicide and if you are asking this I am going to say heaven. Contrary to religious belief you do not go to hell if you commit suicide but having said that you should not disrespect your life that is given to you by the divine and live it to the most.
nb7OXa5Qaa	I get deja vu alot. I think its because we see a lot of our future in dreams so when we live it we remember it from our own dreams, but we can never prove that unless we write down every dream we have (which is impossible). A normall person can have up to 8 dreams a night.|`|1Y21zyokaa	I have no scientific backing for this except that some science professor told it to me.<br>  <br>  I think it has to do with a fault in our optical nerve. Your eyes both see things and send the message to your brain and then your brain process those signals at the same time. Deja vu is is when the signals are slightly mistimed and one eye transmits slower than the other. You literally see the thing twice in an instant.<br>  <br>  This means that you get the feeling you've seen it before because you have seen it before.|`|bFG6tvJYaa	I believe there are multiple reasons we get deja vu. I think it is mostly because we are in the right place (this is simply a theory) and that you have made the right choice. I don't know this but it seems right.|`|YA36FUf1aa	I swear I've seen this question before.|`|wDJRyzE9aa	Muscle memory|`|iY7ICn7haa	My theory is that the feelings of "deja vu" are just "brain farts" of sorts, they are probably due to neurotransmitters misfiring, but the widely accepted theory is that deja vu's are simply subconscious memories.   We go through our days and are constantly being fed information, some of it is totally useless to us and we remember only about half of it, only the stuff that is important to us gets stored in our conscious memory, the rest gets set aside somewhere in the back of our minds until something happens and triggers a deja vu. <br>  <br>  I also think that fatigue, sleep deprivation, or drug intoxication might cause feelings of deja vu to happen more often which is again due to the neurotransmitters misfiring.|`|yPsbcrkkaa	Well, I will put what every other answerer has been too afraid to put....because we actually HAVE been there before! <br>  What makes me so sure? What makes you so sure that yesterday happened to you? Because "everyone knows" it happened? Because you know it happened?<br>  You ARE a spiritual being and it would be very strange NOT to experience deja vu....you would have to be in a very bad state as a being to not even experience deja vu!<br>  Don't remember your past lives? Thats a worry! The only thing you CAN take with you when you leave this lifetime are your abilities.....all your physical possessions you must leave behind.

tHwXESv1aa	Life is a stage where we have to learn things, to learn how to love, be hurt, be happy and sad, to win and lose, to laugh and cry, just everything. This is the time to sharpen your wisdom. Death is another stage. You should not look at it as a negative thing. It is just another phase. Whatever you learned from life, you have to keep them with you when you enter the next stage.

Your camera has to be extremely flexible and durable to handle awkward and sometimes extreme conditions. More than 1 camera is highly desirable and must be able to work as hard as your 1st as well as take all the same lenses and accessories.<br>  <br>  You need to have a wide range of equipment that can allow you as much flexibility to be versatile in this kind of a market where there are cameras in every pocket and under every rock. P&S cameras just wont fully cut it here.<br>  <br>  You will need drive, experience, ambition, knowledge and be hungry to do this. Knowing a lot, about a lot, helps. Common sense is highly needed as well as the ability to focus your knowledge, your matching the equipment to the job as well as thinking on the fly.<br>  <br>  Your client(s) are expecting you to know what you are doing, and you must. You won't get a 2nd chance in your community for a 1st impression. Your ability's, or lack of them, will follow you and spread by word of mouth and the showing of your work to others by them not pleased.<br>  <br>  However, there are days when it seems you can't please anyone.

32xabB4oaa	My advice to you as a professional graphic designer is pursue that which you can live with. Back when I was in high school, i came to the crossroads of what i should do. I was always a good artist, nothing but praise, i loved it. But I was exceptional at math and science. I had natural interest and curiosity in all that was unknown. I had decided i could either go into design or become an aerospace engineer. One would lead me on an unknown path which i felt comfortable with, the other a solid carrer with money. <br>  <br>  After almost a decade I still wonder what could have been, but not a single part of me thinks i could live with myself if i did not pursue what wanted to do. I love every day when i think about what i do, and i smirk every time someone complains about what they do at work. It is a fun career, but some things need to be realized about it. <br>  <br>  First of all, your dad seems like a smart and reserved man. He wants you to succeed. Having said that, he and many other people often have a misconception on what a graphic designer is. Graphic designers are communicators. We take complex ideas and break them down into a simple and manageable bit for people to consume. We are philosophers, we ask questions. We are thinkers, we take existing problems and apply them in different ways to solve them. We are teachers, we allow people to understand things faster, quicker and with less effort.<br>  <br>  Does your father understand the idea that the car he drives was created by a graphic designer? Where he holds the wheel, where the console is, the way he sits in the car, where he places his cup in the cup holder? A graphic designer went through everything and figured out where and how everything should interact with the passenger. <br>  <br>  The computer. The way you interface, look at, interact, see and understand everything on screen. It was a designers job to do this. <br>  <br>  We are the gate keepers of information and human interaction.<br>  <br>  You want to be a comic book artist? Its not just about drawing a character and making something happen. Its about story telling, understanding human psychology, gestalt, color, type, interactivity, experience, printing, writing and so much more. It goes deep down the rabbit hole... there are people who have PhD's on these sorts of subjects. Not to mention all the side specializations you must know and be able to work with. But I'm sure you already understand this. Its just a matter of conveyance.<br>  <br>  My point with this; to become a graphic designer you must have a vast understanding of various schools of knowledge. We are not masters in all of them but we have to know enough to be able to communicate with those that are. Most career fields do not come close.<br>  <br>  How much you will make? You are following a field of knowledge not commerce. If you chose to be a graphic designer you will start off modestly and grow with your career. Its not a place to get rich quick, those that think this are under a false illusion of wealth. They are usually the first to fail. There are the rare exceptions of getting lucky. But I don't think your dad wants to hear about luck. Its hard work, but very fulfilling.<br>  <br>  If you chose to follow up on a few successful graphic designers here is a list. Most are published and successfull, their backrounds are varied.<br>  <br>  Edward Tufte <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/" rel="nofollow">http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/</a><br>  Curtis Hillman <a href="http://www.hillmancurtis.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hillmancurtis.com/</a><br>  Jay Ryan <a href="http://www.thebirdmachine.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebirdmachine.com/index.php</a><br>  Michael Strassburger <a href="http://www.moderndog.com/SWFX/" rel="nofollow">http://www.moderndog.com/SWFX/</a><br>  <br>  There are many however, some not as famous, just depends where you look.<br>  <br>  As for your Institute of Technology, I am unsure of it as I have had no prior experience with anyone from it.  I would do more research on it. Most technical schools only offer an Associates Degree. I would recommend an accredited college or university which offers at least a Bachelors Degree. Depending on how far you want to take your career, a BA will keep more doors open. I would also recommend something in-state as it will be much more affordable. In the end however it all comes down to your skill and willingness. Most people will not personally know what school you went to unless its something local they would be familiar with. A degree an your work will be all they see and are interested in.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Average pay is between 40-50 thousand a year.  You will make more as you gain experience.  If you specialize in web design or animation you can make even more.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to a very good designer: <a href="http://www.natesdesign.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.natesdesign.com/</a><br>  You can see a variety of things in his gallery.<br>  <br>  I don't know anything about FIT.  You should ask for a tour and get information on their graphic design program.  I would assume that they are more focused on the fashion industry, so I don't know how broad your education would be.|`|3whhpHHvaa	This question couldn't be more perfect for me lol. I'm a Digital Arts & Design major at C.W. Post. A lot of students that have to leave FIT (for financial or other reasons) come here, and they honestly smoke us. The arts program there makes you extremely strong in Fine Arts, and while my program is solid here, we don't even compare.<br>  <br>  The guy who runs my digital program is fairly renown as a graphic designer, and he does a great deal of work on the internet. The people that work under him and teach the kids just starting out here are people that have been in the industry since before computers even existed, and they tell you every in and out of working as a graphic designer. Even still, the kids from FIT absolutely OWN us.<br>  <br>  So, no, FIT is not a bad school. It's one of the best and certainly one to be reckoned with.<br>  <br>  As for your other point - Graphic Design is a huge industry. And while the economy isn't doing great, there are still jobs to be had.<br>  <br>  What you ought to do is go to school without the idea of being a Graphic Designer, but a Digital Arts major. Doing this will give you the degree necessary to be a graphic designer, but you will have the opportunity to do more than that as well. You will experience a lot of other career paths if you study DA&D. And I can promise that you will find other things you love to do digitally. When I came to college, I was pretty certain that I was going to be a graphic designer.<br>  <br>  Now, not so much. You will find a million and one things that a computer can do that you will love equally. I'm probably going to be a digital modeler, doing 3D rendering in programs like Maya and ZBrush. I never expected to want to do that.<br>  <br>  You're going to have plenty of time to find out which programs and tasks suit you, though. But you need the time, and you need to study. So tell your dad that FIT is a good school, and that the Digital Arts is still growing, and that there will be a place for you. If you want some contacts for my professors so you can hear it straight from the horse's mouth, just email me, and I'll be glad to get you in touch with them.<br>  <br>  My job is going to yield me over 100K a year after I've secured my seat at a firm for just a couple years. Being a true digital artist that is fervent and passionate is hard to come by. So if you're set on Graphic Design before you even make it to college, it sounds like you've got it. That will be respected, and you will do just fine. No worries.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|U5yWxIkeaa	Here are some statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor (2006) on careers in Graphic Design. There's a LOT of good information on that page.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos090.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos090.htm</a><br>  <br>  As with any career, how much you make depends on your natural talent, education, your ability to market yourself, as well as how hard you work to make your goals. Of course a little luck always helps too.<br>  <br>  I think you should listen to what your parents have to say on this matter, but in the end YOU have to be happy with YOUR career. This is what you'll be spending 40+ hours a week doing for the next 45 years (or so) of your life. You could go to college to be a doctor, engineer, or whatever, but if you don't enjoy what you do, you most likely will not live up to your full potential.<br>  <br>  You're a Junior in high school? Great! Try to find companies in your city that employ Graphic Designers, and learn about what they do on a day -to-day basis. Your guidance counselor at school might be able to help you with the introductions. See if you can shadow some graphic designers for a day. Try to get into a few different companies, since graphic designers are used in many different ways. See if you can get a summer internship this summer with one of these companies. These types of activities will help you learn for yourself if a career as a graphic designer is what you want to do.<br>  <br>  Just to play devils advocate on the topic, I will say that it's been my observation that a lot of companies do not tend to value artistic professionals as highly as they do the scientific professionals (engineers and programmers) when it comes to salary.<br>  <br>  In the long run, I say follow what YOU want to do, and work hard to be the very best [insert career title] there is, and you will be successful.|`|kr34vLJkaa	Wow, I wanted to go into the arts as a youngster, but I needed to work to survive.  I drew a lot and was told that drawing was a waste of the talents God gave me.  Talk about repression.  Now I am 41, and I am just starting back into drawing.  And after just two weeks of re-exercising my talent, after 23 years of not drawing a thing, I produced the portraits on my deviant page.<br>  What would have happened if I had pursued a career in art, doing what I loved?<br>  Hopefully you will not have to ask yourself that question.<br>  If it is an issue of whether or not your dad will pay, well I hope that is not the case.  If he is going to pay for your education then it should be for something you love to do.  After all, over 90% of those who get a bachelor’s degree end up not working in their degree field.  I wonder why?<br>  Good luck!
EBrgRBT3aa	He founded York (now Toronto) and was instrumental in introducing institutions such as the courts, trial by jury, English common law, freehold land tenure, and for abolishing slavery in Upper Canada long before it was abolished in the British Empire as a whole (it had disappeared from Upper Canada by 1810, but was not abolished throughout the Empire until 1834).<br>  <br>  Simcoe began construction of two main routes through Ontario which were intended to aid in the defence of Upper Canada but would also help encourage settlement and trade throughout the province. Yonge Street, named after the Minister of War Sir George Yonge, was built north-south along the fur trade route between Lake Ontario and Lake Simcoe. Soldiers of the Queen's Rangers began cutting the road in August 1793, reaching Holland Landing in 1796.

It is our experiences that will change us, the world of hard knocks, as some call it, so there's no need to attempt to change anyone's mind, that's a fool's paradise!<br>  <br>  If you want change in the world then begin with oneself and be a shining example of what you value most. It's rather like the parent with the child. The youngster doesn't always listen to you but will follow your example on how to act. So be that example!<br>  <br>  ;- )|`|BVf2eAWnaa	Here I'm interpreting world peace as a world were there are no wars (but still with crime).<br>  I think that when people have the same conditioning they become more similar in regards to right/wrong and that might avoid wars. A good thing about the internet is that there's a lot more information available for everyone (of course one might think it's too much), but in the end I think that might make people more similar. It also seems like religions are decaying and science being the new religion, which is imo another step against a more peaceful world (since we are finding out more how our mind works/ getting an higher understanding I think that when people realize that this is the only life they have they might not be in a hurry to be killed).<br>  Our knowledge is constantly growing and people are becoming more and more intelligent (similar), and I think that is the way to world peace. <br>  <br>  On a side note: Who knows, maybe we will become "one world" in the end when the majority have become similar enough. <br>  <br>  Also, when learning more and more about the brain, we might implant a controlling device or something like it.. hehe.. but this is very sci-fi now :)|`|pTlnCNYJaa	I think your right its totally unrealistic and unachievable. There's too many greedy people on this earth who unfortunately are in great power who want to lead and control.<br>  <br>  It would be nice but it would never happen so the next best thing to do is bring peace upon yourself and practise it in your daily living.  This wont change the world but it will have an awsome affect on the people around you.|`|qXFACB58aa	lol... It won't be peaceful. Even some out there who want peace have a different idea of what "peace" is. So you'd have to even change the minds of those that are already for the same thing.lol.<br>  In regards to those who don't want peace, the very first thing that randomly came to my head was a line in Batman (yes i'm weird) "some people just want to watch the world burn"|`|U0S9pdqSaa	I agree... the only way to achieve true world peace is by killing absolutely everyone in the world, which would kind of defeat the purpose anyway...|`|pnoQFcT4aa	World peace can be obtained and it will happen the moment the human race is extinct.|`|A5XuZ3pIaa	No...

shVgCizBaa	What is the earliest historical record? Writing was invented 4th millennium BC, there are paintings  in caves about human behaviour 20,000 or 30,000 years ago but  archaeology also can also  give informations on homo sapiens ,neanderthal man 100,000 years ago    .Geology can trace animals that lived  on earth millions years ago------------------  Recorded history (sometimes called record history) can be defined as human history that has been written down or recorded by the use of language, whereas history is a more general term referring to any information about the past  It starts in the 4th millennium BC, with the invention of writing. The period before this is known as prehistory.<br>  <br>  Archaeology is the excavation and study of artifacts in an effort to interpret and reconstruct past human behavior.[2][3][4][5] In the study of ancient history, archaeologists excavate the ruins of ancient cities looking for clues as to how the people of the time period lived. Perhaps most of what is known of the ancient world comes from the accounts of antiquity's own historians. Although it is important to take into account the bias of each ancient author, their accounts, are the basis for our understanding of the ancient past. Some of the more notable ancient writers include: Manetho, Valmiki, Vatsyayana, Vyasa, Kalidasa, Chanakya, Sun Tzu, Herodotus, Josephus, Livy, Polybius, Sallust, Suetonius, Tacitus, Thucydides, and Sima Qian.<br>  <br>  Primary sources are firsthand written evidence of history made at the time of the event by someone who was present. They have been described as those sources closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.[6][7] These types of sources have been said to provide researchers with "direct, unmediated information about the object of study."[8] Secondary sources are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyze, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. Tertiary sources are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources These are sources which, on average, do not fall into the above two levels.<br>  Prehistory  is a term often used to describe the period before written history. Paul Tournal originally coined the term Pré-historique in describing the finds he had made in the caves of southern France[citation needed]. It came into use in French in the 1830s to describe the time before writing, and the word "prehistoric" was introduced into English by Daniel Wilson in 1851.[1][2]<br>  <br>  Prehistory can be said to date back to the beginning of the universe itself, although the term is most often used to describe periods when there was life on Earth; dinosaurs can be described as prehistoric animals and cavemen are described as prehistoric people. Furthermore, the word prehistory can be said to have special relevance to the study of the human past, as opposed to, for example, that of other animals or the earth itself, and this nuance can be seen from its usage. In any case, usually the context implies what geologic or prehistoric time period is discussed, f.e. "prehistoric miocene apes", about 23 - 5.5 Million years ago, or "Middle Palaeolithic Homo sapiens", 200,000 - 30,000 years ago.<br>  <br>  Because, by definition, there are no known written records from prehistoric times, the information we know about the time period is informed by the various fields of the natural and social sciences, such as paleontology, biology, palynology, geology, archaeoastronomy, anthropology, archaeology, and many more. In societies where the introduction of writing is relatively recent, oral histories, knowledge of the past handed down from generation to generation, contain records of "prehistoric" times.<br>  <br>  The term became less strictly defined in the 20th century as the boundary between history (interpretation of written and oral records) and other disciplines became less rigid. Indeed today most historians rely on evidence from many areas and do not necessarily restrict themselves to the historical period and written, oral or other symbolically encoded sources of communication; in addition, the term "history" is increasingly used in place of "prehistory" (e.g. History of Earth, history of the universe). Nevertheless, the distinction remains important to many scholars, particularly in the social sciences. The primary researchers into Human prehistory are prehistoric archaeologists and physical anthropologists who use excavation, geographic survey, and scientific analysis to reveal and interpret the nature and behavior of pre-literate and non-literate peoples. Human population geneticists and historical linguists are also providing valuable insight for these questions.<br>  <br>  Human prehistory differs from history not only in terms of chronology but in the way it deals with the activities of archaeological cultures rather than named nations or individuals. Restricted to material remains|`|XwV1bar5aa	that would be the sumarians who lived in the fertile cresant just ending the age of prehistory since they were the first peoples to write anything.
kfOpbbCyaa	Since Mr. Collins was hardly a deep thinker, his views of pride (and vanity) would probably be whatever he'd read in what he considered "worthwhile" books of instruction.<br>  <br>  Therefore, his view of pride would undoubtedly be similar to Mary's (from chapter 5): "Pride,'' observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections, "is a very common failing I believe. By all that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed, that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonimously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.''<br>  <br>  I doubt he would recognize any pride in himself or in anyone he considered above him (like Lady Catherine de Bourgh).<br>  <br>  Yes, I think Charlotte and Mr. Collins would occasionally discuss his possible future inheritance and how their lives would be then. However, she would never permit them to live beyond their means in expectation of that day and would most likely always be trying to improve their present income. Charlotte was too practical not to consider the future, but, at the same time, too pragmatic to count on an inheritance which could conceivably never materialize. In other words, Charlotte would probably consider that Mr. Collins could die before Mr. Bennet and then, if one of the Bennet girls had a son by the time Mr. Bennet died, that son might, in fact, inherit over any son of Charlotte's.<br>  <br>  If the time came when Mr. Collins inherited Longbourn, they would lead a life of leisure just as the Bennet family did before them. However, Charlotte would make sure that their income would stretch farther than the Bennets' income did, because she was intelligent, unlike Mrs. Bennet. (If you remember, the Bennet family lived within their means only because Mr. Bennet made sure of it. Mrs. Bennet was very extravagant and, left to her own devices, would have outrun her income and eventually been in debt. Charlotte was shrewd enough that there would never be that danger. On the contrary, Charlotte would save money and be able to leave a nice portion to each of her children.)
i1gesbh5aa	I've tried to push that book out of my mind after being forced to read every agonizing page in the 9th grade.|`|w3uYxwiraa	I HATE Stella, but other than that it's a great book.|`|vsGtzWR8aa	It's not completely awful. I liked most of the characters (except for Pip), and it has a good ending.|`|a1fAaig3aa	I know I will probably be attacked for this by the literary critics, but ALL of Dickens is like that! They are all full of agonizing details that go on for pages. Great expectations is one of the worst, I sware pip could describe a door knob for six pages.<br>  I Love books and readings of all kinds but I could barely push myself through any Dickens books.<br>  They all have a good basic story line, but it all gets ruined with exhasting pages of rediculous details.<br>  I totally agree with you.|`|w0M3GY6Yaa	I am afraid I *Disagree* with you.<br>  <br>  Great Expectations has been regarded as one of his greatest and most sophisticated novels and, well apart from Miss Havisham, i really love that book. <br>  <br>  I guess u find it awful bacause it isn't the sort of modern books we read. What can u expect, i mean Charles Dickens was one of the greatest writers of his time, the 19th Century. That's how people used to read English, write it and understand it at that time. Imagine you post your next question: <br>  "Aren't Shakespeare' s writing completely, truly horrid? You dont get a word of what he says, what with all those 'thous', 'thees' and his 'thys'?? Dont u agree?" <br>  i dont think your question would be appreciated by the majority ;)<br>  <br>  But there are people today, quite a large populaion, who still loves Dickens and his writings. The popularity of Dickens's novels and short stories has meant that they have never gone out of print.  <br>  <br>  So i think its a bit rude to call Great Expectations "an awful, awful, awful, awful book", cuz it isn't. You'll agree when u get the depths of the story!!<br>  <br>  P.S. Replacing the "awful", with "amazing" would be a much better idea!! :D|`|qn9NilP3aa	"Great Expectations" is an amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing book!

That is the purpose of the LDK.<br>  <br>  Life Decryption Key-Shortest<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.

Although he felt that the US Constitution did not contain any provisions for acquiring territory, Jefferson decided to purchase Louisiana because he felt uneasy about France and Spain having the power to block American trade access to the port of New Orleans.-------------------------The Louisiana Purchase   was the acquisition by the United States of America of 828,800 square miles (2,147,000 km2) of the French territory Louisiane in 1803. The U.S. paid 60 million francs ($11,250,000) plus cancellation of debts worth 18 million francs ($3,750,000), a total cost of $15,000,000 for the Louisiana territory.[1][2][3]<br>  <br>  The Louisiana Purchase encompassed portions of 14 current U.S. states and 2 Canadian Provinces. The land purchased contained all of present-day Arkansas, Missouri, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, parts of Minnesota that were west of the Mississippi River, most of North Dakota, nearly all of South Dakota, northeastern New Mexico, the portions of Montana, Wyoming, and Colorado east of the Continental Divide, and Louisiana west of the Mississippi River, including the city of New Orleans. (The Oklahoma Panhandle, and southwestern portions of Kansas and Louisiana were still claimed by Spain at the time of the Purchase.) In addition, the Purchase contained small portions of land that would eventually become part of the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. The land included in the purchase comprises around 23% of the territory of the United States today.[2]<br>  <br>  The purchase was a vital moment in the presidency of Thomas Jefferson. At the time, it faced domestic opposition as being possibly unconstitutional. Although he felt that the US Constitution did not contain any provisions for acquiring territory, Jefferson decided to purchase Louisiana because he felt uneasy about France and Spain having the power to block American trade access to the port of New Orleans.<br>  <br>  Napoleon Bonaparte, upon completion of the agreement, stated, "This accession of territory affirms forever the power of the United States, and I have given England a maritime rival who sooner or later will humble her pride."  Background<br>   <br>  A contemporary mapmaker's vision of "Louisiana", edged on the west by the Rocky MountainsThe city of New Orleans controlled the Mississippi River through its location; other locations for ports had been tried and had not succeeded. New Orleans was already important for shipping agricultural goods to and from the parts of the United States west of the Appalachian Mountains. Through Pinckney's Treaty signed with Spain on October 27, 1795, American merchants had "right of deposit" in New Orleans, meaning they could use the port to store goods for export. Americans also used this right to transport products such as flour, tobacco, pork, bacon, lard, feathers, cider, butter, and cheese. The treaty also recognized American rights to navigate the entire Mississippi River which had become increasingly vital to the growing trade of their western territories.[5] In 1798 Spain revoked this treaty, which greatly upset Americans. In 1801, Spanish Governor Don Juan Manuel De Salcedo took over for Governor Marquess of Casa Calvo, and the right to deposit goods from the United States was fully restored. Napoleon Bonaparte returned Louisiana to French control from Spain in 1800, under the Treaty of San Ildefonso (Louisiana had been a Spanish colony since 1762.) However, the treaty was kept secret, and Louisiana remained under Spanish control until a transfer of power to France. The transfer finally took place on November 30, 1803, just three weeks before the cession to the United States.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_P...</a>|`|8ivnzNi5aa	I have no complaints about it.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	I'm glad, I live in the former Louisiana Territory and don't speak French. Well, I guess I would if he had not bought it.<br>  <br>  I don't know what would have happened if Louisiana had stayed French, or they lost it to their constant enemy, the British. It would be hard to say, would the East Coast states of America gone to war to get further west, stayed on the East Coast and been much smaller, and maybe weaker? Who knows.<br>  <br>  But I would say I would support the Louisiana Purchase with no reservations.|`|0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	Absolute support.  This was political genius.
hNinyCdBaa	I CAN'T WAIT FOR MARCHING BAND TO START!!!!!<br>  <br>  I play clarinet.  I love marching band.  I love the friendships you make with people and how close you get to the entire band.  Unless you hate someone, everyone's best friends.  There is something bonding about playing with other people.  I like making the visual storyline while playing.  I love that we can compete with playing outside of auditioning for bands.  I love watching other bands, meeting at third quarter break and staying out late and going to school two hours late after championships.  I love the inside jokes.<br>  <br>  Okay, you get the point.  I love everything about marching band.  I am going to be a sophomore next year and I am trying out for section leader with a really good chance of making it. We had a really pathetic section with five freshman, two sophomores and a senior last season.  The only other competition is a sophomore who doesn't even go to our school (vo tech).  I can't wait till our band directors tell us our theme!<br>  <br>  I Love Marching Band!|`|25mllixyaa	I can't wait for marching band either. I play the clarinet, and I, like you, want to try out for drum major. I just watch what the previous drum majors have done. I also watch what my conductor does for concert band. I've learned that you really have to be clear when you're conducting and if you have to yell commands, don't hold back. The band needs to be able to hear you. Don't be bossy, let the band respect you and they'll listen. I'm really excited and hope I make drum major, good luck to you.|`|pgskezsBaa	Can't wait. ITS SO EXCITING and its still close to half a year away. I play the euphonium.

I play clarinet.
piHVQmXdaa	Yes, the movie was based on (not copied) the novel 'Emma'.|`|vsGtzWR8aa	It wasn't copied from Emma, it's just a modern adaptation of it. Classic books are adapted into film- there are modern versions of Wuthering Heights, Pride and Prejudice, and many others.
iCpDKt5Caa	this might sound stupid but before class put on some music and go CRAZY dont worry about technique and the timing, just jump around and let your arms and legs flop everywhere, i find this losens you up and somehow helps you be more relaxed wen dancing properly (it helps me) also before you do your dance (especially before going on stage- particulary in eisteddfods and stuff) take a few deep breaths (remember to exhale) and just relax, itll make your performance HEAPS better.<br>  <br>  :) good luck (Y)|`|8S2icURfaa	When I dance, I wipe out my mind. and just do what I do|`|yrxENGqbaa	SHAKE IT ALL OFF JUST JUMP ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!|`|Ad9Dgx7Uaa	clear your head and just feel the beat<br>  forget all things your stressed out about<br>  and just feeel the beatttt!

Eventually he goes insane, or "explodes", knowing that all the dreams he has been putting off will never really come true.

KvBA8wS3aa	Yep it's very decent. It's not too often that I read a piece on here and make it all the way through to the end! Good job! the only bit I did not like much was "Im daisy" said daisy. It just didn't sound right. <br>  And the bit that says "Who's Fiona" said Daisy. It should be atleast <br>  "Who's Fiona" asked Daisy/ Daisy asked.<br>  All in all, it is good though. Well done.|`|S2yWlfiNaa	I liked it you are very descriptive. You have feeling and I felt that I was Daisy. Good job! Try to get it published when you finish it :)|`|4MYJpkZcaa	Not bad, it's charming. I like the use of description and the variety in wording. Also, I've noticed some character development already, that's nice. I would like to read more, actually.
h3gMzNS3aa	It would have to be both. There are way too many irrational influences around, but not being influenced by others enough results in solipsism causing me to become part of the proble of irrational influences.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say neither of them. We need influences to grow and we need to have some influence on ourselves so that we don't become thoughtless, predictable tools whose thoughts and actions a psychologist can point out before we even act. Perhaps it's impossible to influence ourselves if everything we are is a product of our environment. If any of us argue on Y!A that someone ideas are wrong or aren't happy with some ideas/teachings of other people, it shows we want to be an influencer to some extent.|`|OqlXBUsaaa	no.not at all.<br>  ,,<br>  i like to be, if i need the effects,,|`|BVf2eAWnaa	I would like to be both, like the first poster said. I am here referring to someone influencing me to change my viewpoint or similar and vice versa. I think I favor being the influencer when I'm thinking about it now because I am agreeing with my own viewpoints, but I constantly seek out others viewpoints too.  <br>  <br>  We are constantly influenced with everything around us and I'm not to fond of some of that influence - like how certain shows/channels/news etc.can influence a person, and even if one is aware one gets affected subconsciously.|`|AA11745732	well ive always been the type to want to be the influencer<br>  but if marijuana is the topic<br>  never tried it<br>  but lets be real]<br>  ive always wanted to see what the buzz is all about.<br>  so ill try everything alteast once b4 i die.<br>  good times 09 :) lol|`|pTlnCNYJaa	Well that depends, I dont mind being influenced if its for good and I dont mind influencing for the same reason. Sharing knowledge is the reason for that.|`|NzP09sGdaa	Neither.|`|ZLCPulYKaa	Depends...

QW4jdXGjaa	It was great.|`|TlCD6Jesaa	I loved it after I got past the first 50 or so pages.  The beginning is way weird, but the rest of the book is great.|`|yJdhhzypaa	It's one of my favorite books. It uses brilliant imagery and has a unique narrator. It's just incredible.|`|kdMkL4N9aa	Yes, the beginning is boring and confusing and nearing the middle it gets boring again but once it hits a certain part it starts getting interesting again. It was really good though, I'd definitely say read it if you are thinking about it.|`|iXNcB0vSaa	its good<br>  kinda boring at first but its really nice<br>  i love the ending this is my fav quote from the book<br>  "Heres a simple fact, you're going to die" -Death|`|ijGBvjMwaa	It was wicked awesome.

yOK32PM9aa	There is a sixth sense, in that Buddhists and some Hindus treat the mind as a sense organ which cognises thoughts.  And in the western philosophical tradition, thinking is another way of extending knowledge.  As for the type of sense that you are referring to, the explanations could be:<br>  1) pure coincidence. (What about all the people who were attacked by cougars, and felt fine just before?)<br>  2) some other (probably intermittent) type of sense that has yet to be fully explored<br>  3)  A subconscious decision made by a part of the brain that we are not aware of.  Just like in driving, where we can drive quite safely on "autopilot" while the body and mind still react to perceived threats.  Maybe we pick up the cues (sound of footsteps, distant cougar-call, etc) without being aware.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	I believe we as humans are always evolving.<br>  <br>  Not all animals have all 5 senses. Some animals have different senses. Maybe in a couple 100,000 years from now, humans may evolve and develop a sixth sense.|`|0vo7tDP5aa	scientists aren't necessarily about the tangible. they are about what can be verified. you can't touch gravity or time can you? however, those are used in science all the time. <br>  <br>  only a Logical Positivist would hold something like that.|`|pnoQFcT4aa	Scientifically speaking there are senses other than the ones you've mentioned (ie balance, hunger, spacial mapping when blinded etc). However, the main five senses are used as the basis for empirical knowledge.|`|OIC0vsEWaa	decent movie. bruce willis was pretty good.|`|Jbkk7NrJaa	Well given todays techniques I wouldnt be one to question it. It seems though, research clumps everyone together and suppresses your mind, saying 'you are nothing special'. The notion of a sixth sense has been explored in countless movies, such as a paranormal type deal ( The movie entitled "Sixth Sense" maybe gives it away as to what they are alluding to) and maybe superior senses of surroundings, perception.<br>  <br>  Perception isnt a term, though, to be taken lightly. Studies have been around for ages to debunk ESP (extrasensory perception, another paranormal ability) and stuff relating to Psi and chi. Though none of it has ever been proven, they havent individually studied 6 billion people, therefore the study is really never laid to rest.<br>  <br>  I think that everyone has their own unique sense. You adapt differently, therefore analyze and conclude differently. Knowledge and awareness may heighten these senses, but some are able to recognize and perceive with greater clarity, even without said knowledge. I would probably go so far as to say the sixth sense is unique perception attuned to yourself. People may not even realize it. Science can suppress not necessarily disprove. Can science disprove that?|`|leHQQX4paa	back in highschool i when i used to smoke weed i would talk about this all the time!  i think there is a 6th sense the same as you are talking of here. Then a 7th when you can feel as if there is a someone with you but no one seems to be around. perhaps it's the presents of someone passed.|`|bFG6tvJYaa	Have you ever heard of the Holy Ghost?
tKFO3u60aa	i don't know..what about that Higgs particle? maybe there are laws which we just don't see yet. maybe we're not meant to see them. miracles in the past have often been simple events that we couldn't explain, right? like, the sun 'rising' and the storms. so we say 'magic'. now 'magic' has become 'miracle'. i know i'm not saying anything new, and i like the idea of miracles, but, keeping history in mind, i don't see that there are miracles. have you ever read Sphere by Michael Crichton? i think our life would be like that if we met with 'alien life'.|`|b0AvMRqbaa	No, I don't believe in miracles in the way you are asking. I don't believe in sudden unexplainable events, even magic is explainable by magicians.<br>  <br>  Yes, there are miracles, we are miracles and every living thing is a miracle. Then we have the miracles we make happen ourselves, when countries achieve peace, when a medical cure is found, when people are kind to each other in day to day life, when we are healthy, when we have enough food, clean water. When we plan, work towards, then see the outcome of our plans. Everything is a miracle. There's nothing supernatural about it, reality itself is a miracle. The consciousness to observe it is a miracle.|`|VM9Vsf9naa	Nope, the wise men of old were not wrong, they knew more than we do about the inner workings of man and the universe.<br>  <br>  There are physical laws for the mineral realm, vegetable and animal realms which includes humans too. These operate within the dimensions of time and space, the world of effects, of which the causes are not so readily revealed.<br>  <br>  Then there are spiritual laws which supersede the physical realm. The more you become conscious of the spiritual realm then the less you will view the physical as the real for it is only temporary, transient, and ever changeful. Spiritual laws are eternal existing beyond the confines of time and space. It is man's purpose to become consciously aware of this greater realm by expanding his consciousness into the universal state of being - not the body, not the mind, but the central being you call "I" is your true spiritual selfhood, and it is eternal.<br>  <br>  Miracles are merely the workings of the higher laws and once you understand them you'll see there is no miracle but simply the fulfilling of the law of being, or consciously directed thought from a consciousness that is aware of Itself, one with the Infinite Intelligence, or Cosmic Consciousness.|`|wHqDY3vcaa	I believe in paranormal activity, not so sure about miracles.|`|0vo7tDP5aa	nope.|`|pTlnCNYJaa	There is the physical law that keeps society in order and there's lore that keeps the spiritual in order. Without either there would be complete chaos.<br>  <br>  You see spiritual lore manifesting all the time with natural disasters. This is natures way of cleansing.  In our culture each element has a guardian who takes care of that realm i.e the sea, the forests etc.  <br>  <br>  As for miracles, they're happening all the time, those are governed by the Angels.|`|iY7ICn7haa	every situation is a function of many, many variables, and like every function it should have an "optimal solution".|`|bFG6tvJYaa	Of course I believe in miracles. Having witnessed many myself. <br>  Look around my friend. See the world and you will see a miracle.|`|EAdZnaI6aa	No.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	I don't believe in miracles. Sorry. I think it is "impossible" to break the laws of nature. But if the universe is infinitely big, maybe there is a world where the laws of nature doesn't exist and science and math can be proved wrong. That world is way beyond my imagination...

Bx6xTLRbaa	I really do believe that. I even believe in fate..things do happen for a reason. Every person and thing in our lives effect us somehow and make us develop into the people that we are. Every time we win or fail in life we reach a new challenge. So think about where you are in life right now, you wouldn't be here if you hadn't made mistakes or those good choices before.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Everything happens because it was caused, if that is what you mean.  But the reason usually has nothing personally significant about it, tempting though it is to believe otherwise.|`|c7pbvYmpaa	Without reason, nothing would exist.|`|NzP09sGdaa	It seems like the reasons behind things stretch all the way back to the beginning of time which suggests a great deal of momentum but when you add the quantum element you have to ask: Does the observation of an effect somehow create the cause that creates the observed effect?<br>  <br>  To answer your question, I suspect that every observed thing may happen for many more than just one reason.|`|5VHEcfp2aa	Yes, because everything happens for a reason. Even when some one says they did something for no reason; "no reason" was their reason for doing whatever they did.|`|b0AvMRqbaa	Cause and effect<br>  <br>  For people, it's a battle of individual wills.|`|872f4d28837b0b839ed695238bef2e97aa	This whole universe is building up to something.  What that something is i have no clue, but when it gets reached we will understand why everything had to happen that way.<br>  <br>  It has been that way with my life, many of the things that happened to me as a child were preparing me for the things i am supposed to do today, i didn't understand it back then of course, but i see it clearly now.|`|bFG6tvJYaa	Of course.<br>  <br>  If nothing happened for a reason, then why did the Founding Fathers compromise about the House and Senate? Why do people fight about things? Why does anything happen if not for a reason? Why are you here if there is no reason? Why is the Earth around if there is no reason? Why did God once destroy the Earth if there was no reason to? Why did Adam and Eve take the fruit if there was no reason? <br>  <br>  Why would live go on, without a reason?|`|pTlnCNYJaa	Yes and thats a difficult one to explain.  There's no logical answer for the logical mind without going into predistined destiny, it just is.  Its only experiencing it and reflecting on it that gives you the answer. Sorry that sounds so micky mouse, cant explain it any other way.|`|VM9Vsf9naa	Yes, every effect has a cause. Generally people don't always make the connection and think it's an accident of fate.|`|qXFACB58aa	Yeah... whether I learn from them or not is a different story =P|`|tKb7i5jtaa	Yes, I do|`|D5MoDhBsaa	of course!!!|`|TIgk7Iabaa	i believe in free will
y8bFwXZEaa	To "court" means to make it public, especially before the king.<br>  <br>  When the king or queen held "court" they didn't want surprises and intruigue there, no whispers or drama or things going on behind the curtains, metaphorically speaking.<br>  <br>  If a man did not wish to come into disfavor with the monarch, he made his intentions known in "court." Then the monarch could show approval, or disolved the relationship.<br>  <br>  This carried over into civil society. A father could reasonably kill a man for being in secret with his daughter, so the young man needed to bring it out into the open, "date" his daughter, make it public so everyone knew his intentions.<br>  <br>  Because the men of the court were gentlemen, being public about one's affections became known as "courting," and the answer above me about the rituals becoming "romanticized' are correct.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Courtly love is the name of a set of ideas which first arose in mediaeval Europe, and became popularised by the troubadours.  It is based around the romantic love which a nobleman has for a lady.  He longs for her, yet there are a whole set of rituals which means that he treats her with respect and almost religious reverence.  It is to some extent bound up with Christianity, and is one of the forerunners of the idea of romantic love which persists today.|`|3bTE5snFaa	may I take you out to dinner !

d88ef8f1c01d01e57c385835f3395a78aa	Rubym explains it well - - - just have to add something your teachers will not tell you - - - -Northerners, even those who had been fairly tolerant towards 'blacks', turned against 'blacks' after the not so Civil War.  They feared an exodus of 'blacks' from the South into the North & West, and so many jobs & opportunities once open for 'blacks' were denied them.<br>  The IMPORTANT thing to keep in mind is that thousands then MILLIONS of white Europeans were encouraged to emigrate to the US of A in order to Deny 'blacks' jobs & opportunities.  Many jobs that had been open to 'blacks' were now given to hordes of White Europeans..  <br>  <br>  Also, once 'freed' many Blacks  in the South formed their own townships in the South; often draining swamps or otherwise working to make marginal soil support life in other words they moved off the plantations and forged communities of their own  (and often when they prospered, the whites came in, slaughtered them, and burned them to the ground;  ain't white people wonderful!)...<br>  <br>  Peace///////////////|`|NYU37jfGaa	In 'America's Women' Gail Collins writes:<br>  <br>  'After the war, the first thing freed slaves wanted to do was move about - from job to job, and from plantation to city.  Patience, an ex-slave in South Carolina, passed up a profitable job cooking for her former owner. "I must go" she said "If I stay here I'll never know I'm free."  The black population of Atlanta, about 20 percent before the war, reached 46 percent by 1870.  Most were women who got jobs as laundresses, frequently working in their own homes where they could watch their children while making some money.<br>  <br>  In 1879, thousands of slaves left the Deep South, intent on resettling in Kansas.  They were fleeing post-Reconstruction Mississippi, Louisianna, and Tennessee, where the fury of ex-Confederates against the freed African Americans was bitter and frequently violent.  They knew that if they could make their break from the South and farm 160 acres of Kansas land for five years, the law said it would be theirs.  They were called Exodusters, and one of the main reasons for their migration was concern for the welfare of their women.  "The white men here take our wives and daughters and serve them as they please, and we are shot if we say anything about it." one member wrote to the governor of Kansas.  Thousands of African Americans took riverboats up the Mississippi or walked the Chisholm Trail to Kansas.  Armed whites, alarmed at losing their cheap labor, closed the Mississpi and threatened to sink boats that transported the Exodusters.  The poorest ran out of money as they waited helpless on the riverbank for a boat with the courage to pick them up.  Those who made it to Kansas arrived broke and exhausted.  But within a few years, most of the 15,000 Exodusters who stayed in Kansas were settled homeowners.'|`|gW0nD5cEaa	All of the above. Some stayed, or left for a time and returned. They were then paid something like $1 a year or something so the plantation owners could not be accused of slavery.<br>  <br>  Many went into towns, and cities in the south or even further north, like St. Louis. <br>  <br>  There were thousands of immigrants coming to the US, often Irish or German. The Irish were usually getting the lowest paid jobs in the Northeast and some other areas. When the free Blacks got to New York, Boston, St Louis, Chicago and other cities, they had to compete with the immigrants and often lost out. <br>  <br>   There was not really a mass exodus of Blacks to the north probably until World War I, and more by World War II. But they did go north right away if they could make it that far.  Some were actually prosperous, doing various jobs, some returned to farming, to share cropping and tenant farming in the South, again sometimes for former slave owners, sometimes for other people.|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	The Emancipation Proclamation was basically a PR job.  It only freed slaves in the ConfederateStates, it did not release them in the Northern States.  However, the US government had virtually no power in the Confederate States, thus it was a PR move.
C77c0OE2aa	Eyes are certainly the most difficult part of good pet photography. I am glad to see you know not to use the flash, as that gives horrible results in pets eyes. However, your shots are very much lacking enough light on the face of the cat. Focus is also not good on some of them. Overall they are not too bad, but you need to try to get some better light onto the cat's face to bring out the eyes. Natural daylight would be best.<br>  <br>  There is also a blueish tint to some of the photos. That is because you are using the AUTO white balance on your camera in the shade. Look at your various white balance settings and you will see a selection for cloudy or shade. This will help to prevent the blue cast when you take a photo in the shade.<br>  <br>  By the way. Is that a Ragdoll cat? Looks like one to me. I had one that looked almost exactly like that. He was such a good cat. He died in 2007 and I still miss him very much.<br>  <br>  steve|`|WPhADGwEaa	these are nice but if your are trying to bring out the eyes only one looked like the eyes were some what okay quality<br>  i do the same thing following my pets around but its nice to have a human every now and then!!! just to get pratice<br>  good luck in being a pro:]|`|haiQ9dmpaa	aw your kitty is adorable! her eyes are amazing.<br>  hm... but i'm going to have to say, you should work with focus, colors, and lighting.

I like it a lot. you are good.<br>    but the 3 stanza is a bit ify to the topic =p|`|SipYL8nmaa	If you were to turn it in for a grade I will definately give you an A+ for sure.Love it!|`|QNj60Vmpaa	it's great|`|3whhpHHvaa	Overall, this poem is pretty good. I get the feeling you're a high school student, maybe even first or second year in college.<br>  <br>  Either way, your vocabulary and structure definitely set you apart.<br>  <br>  If you clean this up a little bit, it's really something to be proud of. The third stanza has the best structure. You should really try to keep the other three within that. Focus on pentameter. The first two lines have a good flow, so start by trying to match the next two lines up as far as syllable structure.<br>  <br>  The second stanza is somewhat troublesome. The flow is very off. You might try something to make it an easier read. Forgive my brazenness, but perhaps change it to something like this:<br>  <br>  "Within the walls of all persons<br>  Insanity waxes and worsens<br>  The minds of these people are gone,<br>  though they think they still sing the world's song."<br>  <br>  You'll note that in my version the flow is, I feel, better. Remember that when I read your work, you won't be standing beside me to correct on how to read it. The pentameter will be however it actually appears on the page. I do like the fact that you delve in approximate rhyme when you go from "gone" to "song." Most poets disregard approximate rhyme in the belief that only true rhymes belong in poetry ~ which as you can tell is a sentiment I disagree with.<br>  <br>  There are a few other points I would make, such as the use of the word "shan't." While I commend your usage, as most people forget the word ever existed, "won't" is actually the appropriate word. I applaud your use of higher vocab, though. That said, I would think the first stanza should appear more like so:<br>  <br>  "The never-ending realities<br>  that shape our endless brutalities<br>  exist for one reason only:<br>  so insanity never is lonely"<br>  <br>  Your call, though, really. I think you should also not use the phrase "the human race," and if you choose to revise, I would really recommend not using the phrase "I think."<br>  <br>  Put a little more time into this one, and I'd love to see it again so I can see how it looks.

Ec2uIBjxaa	Middle splits:<br>  Begin by sitting in a straddle stretch on a mat or like somethin soft, When stretching the middle splits during warm-up, go slowly. Even if you are very<br>  flexible, your muscles need time to adjust.<br>  <br>  Step2<br>  Lean towards each leg and towards the middle, just as you would for a plain "V" sit. Gradually work your legs wider, stretching your torso to each leg as you increase the straddle<br>  .<br>  Step3<br>  Roll your hips forward when your legs are fully split, moving your body into vertical alignment. The correct position is with toes pointed and your knees forward. The inside of your feet should lie flat on the mat. This is also the position you will use on the beam, allowing your toes to grab the edge.<br>  <br>  Step4<br>  Straighten your back. Although some arch is necessary due to your hip alignment, an over-arched back will receive a penalty in gymnastic competition. Lift your torso tall and tuck in your stomach.<br>  <br>  Step5<br>  Allow a gymnastic teammate to lift one of your legs carefully when you're in a full middle split. This helps you stretch into an over-split, which is necessary when performing your splits during a jump.<br>  <br>  Tips:::::::xx<br>  <br>  * Try stretching more often but not applying so much pressure that you're sore the next day. Instead of stretching once a day and forcing the split, stretch 3 times a day and use less pressure. Allow your muscles to warm up each time by proceeding slowly.<br>  <br>  <br>  * Relax into your splits. When doing the splits is uncomfortable, just sit there and breathe deeply for a few minutes. Your muscles will eventually relax, allowing your legs to stretch further.<br>  <br>  <br>  * Don't just drop down into the middle splits without a warm-up first. You could pull a muscle.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Left and Right splits:<br>  Spend 10-15 minutes every morning before school doing all your streches<br>  Spend 10-15 minutes every night doing all your stretches<br>  Point your toes at all times it helps!<br>  Maybe even get some one to slightly push you down..i mean really carefully ,you don't want any broken bones here<br>  <br>  <br>  If you dont know what streches to do heres a link that will help you<br>  <a href="http://www.runtheplanet.com/trainingraci..." rel="nofollow">http://www.runtheplanet.com/trainingraci...</a> <br>  this is a really good stretchh as well <a href="http://z.about.com/d/running/1/5/G/-/-/-/hammycropped.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/running/1/5/G/-/-/-...</a><br>  make sure you practice every day and night it really makes a difference dont say ohh nahh i couldnt be botherd today im so tired ill practice tomorrow<br>  practice all the time okay,beleive in yourself dont think negative<br>  <br>  -you can even search on youtube for some extra tipes<br>  <br>  You can also stretch after you have had a warm bath/shower<br>  Make sure you dont start stretching straight away you have to warm up first maybe 5 minutes jumping with a jump rope<br>  or 5 minutes running around in the back/front yard<br>  I'm a gymnast i know what i'm talking about<br>  if you really try your hardest and push further and further each time you will be able to do all 3 splits in approx 2 weeks or even less,<br>  <br>  <br>  think positive YOU CAN DO IT<br>  good luck hope i helped

bFG6tvJYaa	My friend, I do believe we can obtain inner peace. Have you never felt that warmth in your soul and spirit of complete and total peace? I suppose not. You see, yes indeed, mankind does continually change. However, concerning the after-life, we can obtain inner peace. What did you think we would do there? Sit and strum our harps? We were sent here to learn and we will continue to learn, for there is more to discover then we could comprehend as mortals. Yet as immortals we could. <br>  Think outside the box.

We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.

Everyone will have different views because we dont see things in the same light but I guess the final outcome is the same.  Much like religions I guess, all different views but the outcome is the same.<br>  <br>  We wont have the answer to every question, sometimes the answers wont be revealed until sometime down the track and sometimes our perceptions of an answer as you say will change as our thinking evolves.<br>  <br>  I believe inner peace is very much attainable but its being able to maintain it in our very busy lives and challenges that we face each day, thats the difficult part for me.  This I believe is all part of the learning to attain inner peace.

tKFO3u60aa	Hey Ferdinand,<br>  God doesn't hate you. Have you ever heard the maxim "God helps those who help themselves"? If you're religious, and you believe in a God, then it's impossible for your God to hate you. Impossible. However, God may be waiting to see what you can do on your own. God's always with you, but maybe not as protective and aiding as you want. Show God that you are the kind of person who can help himself in life, and take all the opportunities he can get. Don't be afraid of anything, but don't get too cocky. It sounds like you're a humble person anyway, don't give up on that. Just add some self confidence and self motivation to get you going. Soon you'll find yourself looking forward to everyday, just to experience a whole different world. Try to turn things into a positive light. Good luck!!|`|NzP09sGdaa	So you think God hates you because He hasn't re-created creation to suit you - despite the fact that you ask "all the time", right?<br>  <br>  A man might hate you if you repeatedly tell him that his creation "sucks" but - fortunately for you - God is not a man so the answer is "no". God doesn't hate you.<br>  <br>  God doesn't love people because they're "good". God loves people because HE is good.|`|eY0MhGfmaa	God never promised us that life would be easy. Jesus' life certainly wasn't easy, nor were the lives of any of the apostles.<br>  <br>  But we do have a reason to be joyful and optimistic, because we already know what the ultimate outcome of all things will be.<br>  <br>  Read the book of 1 Peter. It was written to suffering Christians who were being persecuted by the Romans. Not exactly the same sort of trials you're going though, but Peter explains how we can be joyful, even in the midst of earthly suffering.<br>  <br>  Lee|`|1lLGYQ6Waa	I think when your Praying, Your not listening. I pray rarely because I don't need help all that much. But when I do pray Oh boy does he answer.<br>  <br>  When I Say your not listening I don't mean with your Ears. When i Say he answers I don't mean with a voice. Open your mind and be Calm, let nothing Distract you while your trying to receive an answer.|`|bFG6tvJYaa	No God does not hate you, he loves you so  much you cannot comprehend it. <br>  Have you ever heard the song "Unanswered Prayers"? Well look up the words to it if you haven't. It explains a lot. <br>  <br>  Anyway, you might not be aware of it, but there is this remarkable thing called opposition in this world. It is not a theory but a fact that without the bad we couldn't know the good. <br>  If you didn't know what dark was, light wouldn't be anything interesting. <br>  If you had Christmas every day it wouldn't be that extra ordinary. <br>  Just like if you always had good times, they wouldn't be that good. You can't expect to have good times all the time, but you could just be being pessimistic. It's not unheard of. People just get lost and forget to pay attention to the good things going on in their life's. Try to look for them, don't focus on the bad but look hard for the good. I'm not saying it will be easy, but it'll be worth it.|`|fWxtrZ2Faa	"God helps those who help themselves"... Makes sense doesn't it? I understand how you feel, though, life can get me pretty down too sometimes. The thing is, we have to force ourselves to change: change your attitude, your mood, your outlook on life, and then: Voila! Change brings change, trust me on that, if you try to live more positively, more positive things will happen to you. It's not gonna be easy, but never get up, always move forward. And no, God doesn't hate you, He never will.|`|5ad5598dc77782773e361b3821253d4eaa	I asked for help from God many times and once I got a verbal answer. I prayed, "God what can I do?" when I was in trouble mentally, without work and my marriage on the rocks. Immediately I heard a loud chorus of voices (male) in my mind which weren't my will hollering, "Kill yourself!" I was shocked but not dumbfounded as I answered back immediately with my mind, NO! There were no further voices for a long time. That and similar instances got me into a mental hospital and diagnosed as schizophrenic paranoid.<br>  <br>  I don't now believe this was God but there is, in my and many other schizophrenics opinions, a supernatural which in many cases may be hostile to you.<br>  <br>  To answer your last question, my advice is to not depend on getting direct answers from god as they may be negative. Instead depend on the loving care of friends, family and especially a lifelong mate. Study and compare all religious and scientific claims with an open mind and above all never stop loving life, your self and others.|`|xkXCFpCMaa	Maybe your looking for something to automatically come to you. You need to make things happen yourself, believe in your ability to make things happen, and then the the acknowledgement of spiritual support of god will follow- when you expect things to change for you, you can be defined, and blinded to whats there, what you can do to initiate it:) Acknowledgement of god, gives a sense of centrality and hope- , a greater power does not make things happen for us, but if you believe its there, you can have the confidence to do so yourself.|`|pTlnCNYJaa	You may be asking the wrong question.  How can you find something to look forward to if  your busy asking God whats out there for you. Seek and ye shall find, in other words get off your butt and go look. God will help those who help themselves.  It all starts with you.|`|gGguRMVcaa	Because that's not how God works. You don't ask Him to fix everything for you, you ask for his strength to guide you.

Start taking action for yourself. Your life and how it turns out depends on your actions.

God gave everyone their problems and their good to see how they deal with them. god loves u and cares for u. But You have to get up and try to make ur life better and for u to get out there and look for something to look forward to. Volunteer, find new friends and go out wih them. Its easy! u just have to lead ur life, dont let ur life lead you. God gave you life, you need to stop thinking that god is the one that is controling ur every move, and u have to  take control.

Beautiful, double-page acrylic pictures with thick black-and-white lines show the small creature blending in with the bare fall trees and as she encounters a bullfrog, a family of opossums, and more in the shadowy night. The animals she meets are no real threat, though Little Raccoon shivers when she hears an owl hoot and wonders what that "rustle rustle" noise can be. It's comforting for both Little Raccoon and young listeners to learn, at the close of the book, that Mother has been following all the way."
EMLPlesmaa	Britain, France, America and Italy won. A Treaty was signed in the Hall of Mirrors, Paris. Germany had to give in, because they were being starved out of the war. <br>  It widely affected Europe because of the devastation of deaths, and destruction. <br>  The Treaty of Versailles was signed by Germany's (they had no choice) government (the Weimar Republic after Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated). It stated that Germany had to take full responsibilty even though Austria-Hungary was really to blame. Therefore they were made to pay ￡6.6 billion in reparations. They were forbidden to unite with Austria, had to limit their army to 10000 men, were not allowed troops in the Rhineland, were'nt allowed U-boats or air force, only allowed 6 battleships, lost a lot of land (Polish corridor for example). <br>  Many other Treaty's were signed between other countries too.<br>  Germany was very vengeful as you can imagine. They became bankrupt and started printing more money, until it became worthless which sent them in to a hype-inflation, this is where it cost around 1,000,000 marks for a loaf of bread.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps (it's quite brief)!|`|AA11620807	The treaty of Versailles ended WWI.

W4PkDqMkaa	????? ????? ???????? Devlet-i ?liye-yi Osmaniyye,[2] Modern Turkish: Osmanl? ?mparatorlu?u), also known by its contemporaries as the Turkish Empire or Turkey (see the other names of the Ottoman State), was an empire that lasted from 1299–1923. It was succeeded by the Republic of Turkey,[3] which was officially proclaimed on October 29, 1923.<br>  <br>  At the height of its power (16th–17th century), it spanned three continents, controlling much of Southeastern Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The Ottoman Empire contained 29 provinces and numerous vassal states; some of which were later absorbed into the empire, while others gained various types of autonomy during the course of centuries. The empire also temporarily gained authority over distant overseas lands through declarations of allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan and Caliph, such as the declaration by the Sultan of Aceh in 1565; or through the temporary acquisitions of islands in the Atlantic Ocean, such as Lanzarote (1585), Madeira (1617), Vestmannaeyjar (1627) and Lundy (1655).[4]<br>  <br>  The empire was at the centre of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries. With Constantinople (Istanbul) as its capital city, and vast control of lands during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent which largely corresponded to the lands ruled by Justinian the Great exactly 1000 years earlier, the Ottoman Empire was, in many respects, an Islamic successor to the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire.
EBrgRBT3aa	Ottoman Tulip Period<br>  Lasting from 1718 to 1730, the Tulip Era was a transitory period in the Ottoman Empire that was marked by cultural innovation and new forms of elite consumption and sociability. The Tulip Era (in Turkish, Lale Devri) coincides with the latter half of the reign of Sultan Ahmed III (ruled 1703–1730), specifically the twelve-year grand vizierate of Ahmed's son-in-law (damad), Nev?ehirli Ibrahim (d. 1730). The period is known for several breakthrough achievements, including the first Muslim printing press in the empire, various innovations in the arts and urban design, and the first cultural embassies to Europe. It is also remembered for the extravagance of the imperial court and the emergence of a Western-inspired, elite pleasure culture. The period gets its name from court society's passion for tulips, which were especially prized as a cultivar and artistic motif. Grandees imported tulip bulbs at great expense, experimented with hybridization, and, planting them by the thousand, celebrated their blooms in candlelit "tulip illuminations" in gardens throughout Istanbul.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/tulip-era" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/tulip-era</a><br>  <br>  Dutch Tulip mania<br>  The tulip was introduced to Europe in the mid-16th century from the Ottoman Empire, and became very popular in the United Provinces (now the Netherlands). Tulip cultivation in the United Provinces is generally thought to have started in earnest around 1593 after the Flemish botanist Charles de l'écluse had taken up a post at the University of Leiden and established the hortus academicus. There, he planted his collection of tulip bulbs—sent to him from Turkey by the Emperor's (Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor) ambassador to the Sultan, Ogier de Busbecq—which were able to tolerate the harsher conditions of the Low Countries, and it was shortly thereafter they began to grow in popularity<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania#History" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE<br>  I′m sure you can gather plenty of differences between those periods.<br>  <br>  ANSWER

stHol8ITaa	Your link didn't work, I'm assuming it was cut off though since this link worked: www.flickr.com/photos/lawren-photography<br>  <br>  Can't say I'm too knowledgeable about photography (only have done one and a bit years of photography in high school so take my critique with a grain of salt, especially since what is good and what isn't in photography is often subjective) but from what I see your work is pretty solid. <br>  <br>  All right, now to the critique:<br>  <br>  Your photo titled "Wouldn't Want To Touch." Interesting enough subject, but I don't like the focus; the way the background is blurred is horribly distracting from the subject. I'd go for a larger depth of field so the background is sharper. Also, the white in the background is also distracting; try to avoid bright colours in the background which will take the viewer's attention away from that spikey flower thing.<br>  <br>  "Noble Steed" - maybe it just boils down to personal taste, but I'm not fond of the way the rear part of the horse, and most of the rider is not in the frame; you could always step back, or zoom out, and if necessary crop the photo on your computer. The background isn't very exciting either and I don't think the subject is too remarkable; not bad, but quite an ordinary photo if you ask me.<br>  <br>  "Gloomy Boardwalk" - I like this one. You gave it a bit of an angle to give the boardwalk 'depth' and 'dimension', good framing, and the green and yellow at the top of the frame go well together since yellow and green are supposed to be complementary colours (be careful though, they can also distract the viewer from the boardwalk and the tunnel). The end of the 'tunnel', however, is very bright (though perhaps this could symbolise the optimistic idea of the 'light at the end of the tunnel'). The problem with this however, is that such bright, glaring colours at the end of the tunnel might be distracting, and while contrast is generally a good thing, I don't think it's a good thing when you have parts of your photo in a lot of shadows while other parts of it is bathed in direct, glaring sunlight. To avoid this you could take photos at a different time of the day (late afternoon?).<br>  <br>  "Childhood Chains" - good photo, though the flowers are a little cut off at the top, and there's a lot of empty space in your frame. I think a lot of empty space is better than too much clutter, however.<br>  <br>  The rest of your photos are excellent though, I love your work. I especially like "Discovering The Waterfront" (nice colours which complement each other), "Tall Giants" (that sun spot is very bright and glaring, but the light effects are interesting), "Slight Disruption" (again great colours which really give the scene an atmosphere of serenity disturbed by only the bird), "Perfect Presicison" (I'm a sucker for some black and white photos, and that's some great contrast), "Reaching Fingers In The Mist" (the mist gives the place a nice mysterious atmosphere).<br>  <br>  Considering your age I think you're very promising, keep it up.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	Considering your age, quite good.

SRcclEPfaa	Tuesdays With Morrie is one of my favorite books. Mainly because it does make you think about all the little things that you tend to overlook when you are busy and in your own little world. After reading it I did start to appreciate the little things that I just took for granted before. Sometimes when I am feeling down I pick that book up and read it again just to make me realize my life is not as bad as it seems.

vsGtzWR8aa	A book that contains an original, non-cliched plot, great multi-layered characters (preferably of young adult age). A story that doesn't need to kill off its characters to prove something. I do prefer fiction, and any category, really. Just as long as there aren't any tedious and unnecessary descriptions and too much exaggeration.|`|w3uYxwiraa	I think The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the 'perfect book', because even though it is not my favorite book absolutely everybody in the world can relate to some part of it. So basically write a total rip-off of The Perks of Being a Wallflower and The Catcher in the Rye and you'll end up with the perfect book. Which would be: A coming-of-age novel, realistic fiction, and characters who seem like they could be real.|`|pgHlTuRnaa	Well, a good book, in my eyes, would be exhilarating, entertaining, amusing, fun, and spontaneous. The characters have to capture me in their lives, their emotions. The style is important as well. The book itself, should have some fact in it, but I'm perfectly content with fiction books. I love fantasy books, like the twilight saga, and wild wood dancing. But an every day, wake up go to school boo, is also fine, like The bronze horseman, and Tatiana and alexander. Basically, to me, all books are especially good, it's the author that has the idea and puts it on a sheet of paper and decides how to write it. The idea, weather about vampires, mummies, wolf people, or the average joe, are interesting in its own way. It also depends on the crowd you're writing for. young teens, adults, etc... <br>  If you're looking for my personally opinion, I like romance fantasy... Romance is fine too, but I could deal with books like It by Stephan King. That's also an amazing book. I like when the main character is older then 15. To me, it seems a little far-fetched if the main character is going through a romance at a younger age... It though, is about a bunch of ten year old little boys, and it is one of the most capturing books. that's because its not a romance, its a horror book. A totally amazing book to me, would capture me from start to end. It would be descriptive, but not over the top. The characters, don't make them whiny and annoying. Make them normal... like me or you.. Also, the idea is very important. Another vampire book, isn't just another vampire book if the plot, the story line is amazing. I, personally, am sick of vampire books because Blue Bloods. The worst book EVER! But I have been told that some of these books are really good. See, not because of the vampires, because of the idea behind the monster... <br>  I hope I helped...<br>  Good luck!|`|klJ1QoWqaa	Maybe a book that has a variety of characters,<br>  the main character is around early or late teens<br>  other side characters could be around the same age or older.<br>  and i prefer fiction because the story can be more creative<br>  I really like fantasy with a mixture of love and action type of story.|`|n3sGt8Bgaa	i really enjoy all of the princess diaries books i am sixteen and they are fun to read , have romance and drama of course! i like them|`|jLLvmWJHaa	I really enjoyed The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini.<br>  <br>  :]|`|SKKKCRZdaa	I loved the Twilight saga by Stephanie Meyer.

You must read the book 'Can You Keep A Secret?'<br>  <br>  Meet Emma Corrigan, a young woman with a huge heart, an irrepressible spirit, and a few little secrets: <br>  Secrets from her mother:<br>  I lost my virginity in the spare bedroom with Danny Nussbaum while Mum and Dad were downstairs watching Ben-Hur. <br>  Sammy the goldfish in my parents’ kitchen is not the same goldfish that Mum gave me to look after when she and Dad were in Egypt. <br>  <br>  Secrets from her boyfriend:<br>  I weigh one hundred and twenty-eight pounds. Not one eighteen, like Connor thinks. I’ve always thought Connor looks a bit like Ken. As in Barbie and Ken. <br>  <br>  From her colleagues:<br>  When Artemis really annoys me, I feed her plant orange juice. (Which is pretty much every day.) It was me who jammed the copier that time. In fact, all the times. <br>  <br>  Secrets she wouldn’t share with anyone in the world: My G-string is hurting me. I have no idea what NATO stands for. Or even what it is. <br>  <br>  Until she spills them all to a handsome stranger on a plane. At least, she thought he was a stranger. <br>  <br>  But come Monday morning, Emma’s office is abuzz about the arrival of Jack Harper, the company’s elusive CEO. Suddenly Emma is face-to-face with the stranger from the plane, a man who knows every single humiliating detail about her.

It's about how a girl's boyfriend die's and becomes an Angel. He tries to save his girlfriend from his murderer but is finding it extremely difficult when he can't even communicate with her in any way. An amazing romance mystery novel. I love it. <br>  <br>  The Mortal Instrument Series by Cassandra Clare- The books are about a Girl who can all of a sudden see this whole other world, with Demons, warlocks, and shadowhunters- who hunt demons. She falls in love with one of the shadowhunters only to find out a terrible secret from her past. <br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins- Set in the future, The U.S. is overrun by a type of dicatorship called the "Capitol."

There are complications to the surgery though, and Tally has to figure out a way of saving the people she loves from the dangers of the World. <br>  <br>  The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold- Set in the 1960's I think, about a 14 year old girl who was brutally raped and murdered.

They were mostly sold into slavery by other tribes who had captured them and already were using them as slaves.<br>  They probably had better lives in the US as slaves.|`|gmaCvh00aa	The number one reason was greed, the cheap labor.  The big planters could not have built the wealth they did paying fair wages for labor, even by that day's standards.  <br>  <br>  Then they had to justify in their own heads reasons that the blacks were inferior, because admitting that they were human beings like themselves would stir up their conscience, and the human mind finds ways to ignore the conscience when greed takes over.  So they used the bible to justify slavery, and they told themselves that they were doing black people a favor by taking them out of their savage surroundings, never realizing that it was they who were the savages in this situation.<br>  <br>  On top of that, they had to use fear to keep the slaves from their natural inclination to fight their oppressors.  Whenever slave revolts rose up, the punishments were brutal.  If not death, amputations, blindings, some of these people were just friggin' sadists.  They used the punishment and killing of other slaves to keep remaining slaves in fear, which worked in many cases because even in the worst of conditions, the will to survive is powerful.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Guanotwozero is correct.  Skin color was not the reason for enslavement, it was merely the marker that made it easier to separate the "us" from the "thems".|`|NYU37jfGaa	Black families could be broken up simply on the whim of the slave's owner.  They could sell husbands away from wives, children away from their parents.<br>  <br>  Black slave women always ran the risk of being molested by their owners, they had no protection against assault at all.  <br>  <br>  But the biggest wrong of all was making them slaves in the first place.|`|Lh6pnwqHaa	They thought they were superior to blacks.

It contains an inherent racial bias.<br>  <br>  Arguably all slave owners (white or otherwise) treated all slaves (white or otherwise) wrongly, at least by today's standards.  I don't see that skin colour is an issue - slavery is slavery and equally immoral, no matter what the skin colour of master and slave.<br>  <br>  Changing race doesn't change morality.<br>  <br>  I don't think the white slaves of ancient Egypt, ancient Rome, medieval Arabia or medieval Scandinavia were any less wrongly treated than any other slaves in history.<br>  <br>  Why any slave masters behaved as they did was partly because they could legally, and partly because it was socially acceptable in their societies to do so.  It's only now, looking back and judging history by our current standards, that we see such practices and behaviour as abhorrent.|`|cfba62be301f6ab7c54be6fabc482682aa	so people could have something to complain about and start crap about 200 years later after its all over.<br>  Its way past time to let it go.<br>  White people were slaves before blacks.

K8kmbxZVaa	The Battle of the Bulge, The Amphibious Allied landing on Omaha Beach, The Battle of Midway, The Battle of Iwo Jima, The Battle of Okinawa, The Battle of Stalingrad, the Atomic Bomb dropping on Nagasaki and Hiroshima. Victory for the Allies meant Hitler, Mussolini, and Imperial Japan would no longer attempt to rule their sections of the world. Defeat for the Allies would mean the Axis would rule the world, the Jewish race would most likely be exterminated. The consequences of the war was that an estimated 55-60 million soldiers/civilians were killed. Wounded would most likely double the number of dead. The Atomic Bomb dropping on Nagasaki and Hiroshima sent the world into the Nuclear Age. Right after WW2 the Soviet Union and the U.S went into the Cold War.

ZW24GerXaa	Yes. Twilight has been completed. New Moon starts filming March 23, and is set to release in theaters November 20th in the U.S. the Eclipse is going to start filming right after and is set to release on June 30, 2010. However, with Breaking Dawn, Summit Entertainment has obtained rights to make it into a movie but it all depends on whether the actors will do it. Kristen Stewart said she would love to do the fourth one. but the fourth movie will end up being split into two halves. one half of it will come out, and then a few months later, the other half of the movie will come out. the reason for this is because the 4th book is so long and they cant fit it all into one movie because it would cost a lot of money and it would take to much time. so if the actors sign on for the last movie, then they will have one as long as they dont have ne other problems. (The character development for Renesmee mite be hard) so they arent sure yet. Robert Pattinson said there are plans for a Breaking Dawn Film.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Moon_(2009_film)#Film_adaptation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Moon_(2...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(novel)#Film_adaptation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_(no...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Dawn" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_Da...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|vrcxxRr8aa	Well, considering how much money the first one has brought, I'm sure the other books will become movies.

There are complications to the surgery though, and Tally has to figure out a way of saving the people she loves from the dangers of the World.<br>  <br>  Maximum Ride by James Patterson(Really good)*******<br>  A group of genetically enhanced kids who can fly and have other unique talents are on the run from part-human, part-wolf predators called Erasers in this exciting SF thriller that's not wholly original but is still a compelling read. Max, 14, and her adopted family–Fang and Iggy, both 13, Nudge, 11, Gazzy, 8, and Angel, 6–were all created as experiments in a lab called the School. Jeb, a sympathetic scientist, helped them escape and, since then, they've been living on their own. The Erasers have orders to kill them so the world will never find out they exist. Max's old childhood friend, Ari, now an Eraser leader, tracks them down, kidnaps Angel, and transports her back to the School to live like a lab rat again. The youngsters are forced to use their special talents to rescue her as they attempt to learn about their pasts and their destinies. <br>  <br>  Marked ( Book 1) House of Night series by P.C.

Those whom the creatures "mark" as special enter the House of Night school where they will either become vampyres themselves, or, if their body rejects the change, die. To Zoey, being marked is truly a blessing, though she's scared at first. She has never fit into the human world and has always felt she is destined for something else. Her grandmother, a descendant of the Cherokee, has always supported her emotionally, and it is she who takes the girl to her new school. But even there the teen stands apart from the others. Her mark from the Goddess Nyx is a special one, showing that her powers are very strong for one so young. At the House of Night, Zoey finds true friendship, loyalty, and romance as well as mistrust and deception.<br>  <br>  Blue Bloods Series by Melissa De La Cruz- The Blue Blood Series by Melissa De La Cruz- About a group of Vampires called Blue Bloods who try to do good in the world, only to realize that one of their own has turned from them.<br>  <br>  Eternal By: Cynthia Smith-******<br>  At last, Miranda is the life of the party: all she had to do was die.

When the moon is high, she feels the call to run wild in the woods, to feel the forest floor beneath her paws. But, when she moves into a new town, she meets a boy. A human. Her family disapproves but she is head over paws. With growing tension within her pack and her lack of control over her own abilities, she wonders if her boy will love her, or more importantly, if he will survive loving her. Jealously, isolation and competition within her extended family all threaten what tender happiness she tries to build.<br>  <br>  You can also check <a href="http://www.teenreads.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.teenreads.com/</a> <br>  Hope that helps.))|`|TlCD6Jesaa	I agree with Speak and other books by that author.<br>  Also, <br>  Just Listen, Sarah Dessen<br>  Does my Head Look Big in This?

She opened the door a crack and saw a young woman standing there in her raincoat, her bare legs spattered with dried mud, holding a crying baby wrapped in a blanket. The baby was Heidi, and they had come from the almost-empty apartment next door for help. Heidi's Mama can't tend her week-old child because she has, as Heidi later says, "a bum brain," so Bernadette steps in and cares for them both tenderly. Mama says her name is "So Be It," but with her twenty-three-word vocabulary, this is all the information she can give Bernadette.<br>  <br>  Also try Rules by Cynthia Lord.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rules-Cynthia-Lord/dp/0439443830/ref=pd_bxgy_b_text_c" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Rules-Cynthia-Lord...</a><br>  <br>  It's about a girl who has an Autistic brother. <br>  <br>  All you have to do is search on Amazon.

EBrgRBT3aa	Particularly heavy industry, boomed. Iron became the major thrust of industrial growth after the acquisition of Lorraine in 1871. By 1900 Germany had surpassed Britain in the manufacture of steel. It was used primarily to build railroads, a mighty merchant fleet, machinery for domestic use and export and, of course, armaments.<br>  <br>  The pride of this first German economic miracle was the electrical and chemical industry. Together, Werner von Siemens and Emil Rathenau were largely responsible for the electrification of Germany, including an extensive trolley system and over-land power-transmission stations. I. G. Farben became a trail blazer in the field of chemicals.<br>  <br>  ANSWER|`|bhTjO8MCaa	<a href="http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com/search.pl?query=Second+Industrial+Revolution" rel="nofollow">http://www.justfuckinggoogleit.com/searc...</a>
EBrgRBT3aa	The nineteenth century is also referred to as the "age of the college." While only a handful of higher education institutions existed in 1800, several hundred others were founded in the next fifty years. Leading state universities were established and other institutions were sponsored by religious denominations. Most fought for survival, competing for students and financial support. The Dartmouth College case, settled in 1819, granted private institutions autonomy from the state legislatures that chartered them. Many colleges offered few advanced courses, however, the rest being "prepatory" classes equivalent to those in academies or high schools. Through much of the nineteenth century, American collegiate institutions were dominated by a classical curriculum and an academic culture shaped by traditions handed down from the colonial period. Latin and Greek represented the core of the curriculum and most classes were conducted by recitation. There were efforts to introduce more scientific, historical, and literary studies. Francis Wayland advocated such innovations as president at Brown, but the Yale Report of 1828, a faculty document defending classical studies, helped to slow widespread change during the antebellum period. Tradition held the classical emphasis to be indispensable; without it, no course of study could represent collegiate standards.<br>  <br>  Change was evident, however, in the latter decades of the century. The first Land Grant College Act in 1862, drafted by Vermont congressman Justin Smith Morrill, established support for institutions devoted to practical and scientific study. A second Morrill act in 1890 provided even more support for these state universities. Meanwhile, visionary leaders such as Harvard's Charles Eliot broke the stranglehold of tradition in the collegiate curriculum, introducing a liberal elective system that allowed students to choose courses freely. Scientific research institutes had been opened at Harvard, Yale, and other institutions even before Eliot's reforms, and new research oriented universities were established afterward, with Cornell (1868), Johns Hopkins (1876), and Chicago (1890) leading the way. These institutions were influenced by the German model of higher education, which emphasized research-based learning instead of classical training. Flagship state universities, such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and California, also exhibited German influences and attracted professors dedicated to scholarship and research.<br>  <br>  Adult education found expression in the lyceum movement, which began in 1826 and within a decade had established more than three thousand local forums for lectures and debates. After the Civil War, the Chautauqua movement sponsored traveling and local exhibitions and lectures, eventually embracing hundreds of local associations. These forms of popular learning continued into the early twentieth century, when their roles were increasingly filled by universities, museums, libraries, and other institutions.<br>  <br>  By 1900, the basic elements of a modern education system were in place. Common school reform had established a network of primary schools, public high schools existed in towns and cities across the country, and colleges and universities were widely accessible. Americans attended school at higher rates than in any other nation and engaged in a variety of other educational activities. This keen interest in education would continue in the years ahead.<br>  <br>  ANSWER

EBrgRBT3aa	Many of us have heard the story of Rosa Parks, but may have never thought through just how her character was necessary to make her mark on the nation. <br>  <br>  First, she needed courage and determination to make her stand. In her own words:<br>  <br>      "When that white driver stepped back toward us, when he waved his hand and ordered us up and out of our seats, I felt a determination cover my body like a quilt on a winter night."<br>  <br>  Second, she was neither violent nor hot-tempered.  Had she been either of these, the press and lawyers might have swayed public opinion and juries by arguing that she was simply an argumentative rabble-rouser who deserved to be moved to another seat. <br>  <br>  Third, she had built a great reputation. The NAACP needed a person who could stand up to public scrutiny and represent Afro-Americans well. Rosa had completed school and studied to be a teacher. She had a job. She was faithful to her husband. She had developed not only a quiet fortitude, but an understanding of the political system.  <br>  <br>  According to Dr. Martin Luther King, "Mrs. Parks...was regarded as one of the finest citizens of Montgomery—not one of the finest ***** citizens—but one of the finest citizens of Montgomery." <br>  <br>  Her character not only motivated her to make a stand, but allowed her stand to shake the nation.|`|gmaCvh00aa	She didn't have extraordinary abilities.

It is a monologue, not a soliloquy.|`|QlEdEpwSaa	It sure is. <br>  <br>  Remember it is from the play Hamlet. But is not a soliloquy by Hamlet himself.  It is a soliloquy by Polonius giving advice to his son Laertes before he sets sail. <br>  <br>  This soliloquy is filled with many magnificent pieces of wisdom and advice - the best being contained in the last four lines.|`|1lprn6Ysaa	yea it is <br>  act one scene three<br>  :D|`|lWJ3GafJaa	yes it is:)
iNXqiDIYaa	The book is primarily an extended essay, titled "Genocide by Any Other Name," tracing the history of the mandatory transfer of Native American children (from their families) to residential schools. It analyzes this as a process of genocide (forced assimilationist policies including the prohibition of the use of any national language or religion) and catalogues the terrible conditions present in the schools (starvation, disease, forced labor, torture, and predation) resulting in the death of half of the children and traumatization of the survivors (who have suffered from a high rate of alcoholism, suicide, and "the transmission of trauma to successive generations" leading to social disintegration).<br>  <br>  The author describes the book as an attempt to compensate for "perhaps the most serious" of the deficiencies of his 1979 book A Little Matter of Genocide in which the system of residential schooling was covered with only three sentences.<br>  <br>  Included in the book are a number of photos and a list of these schools in the US and Canada

gnhl6hXYaa	hi[:<br>  well i think your story is pretty good just with some flaws in it..<br>  try describing taylor abit more.. and giving the scene more detail.<br>  the part where 3 weeks later they find the person who kidnapped her doesn't make much sense because you said the parents searched for her yet three weeks later they found the person who did it... try switching that idea.. maybe saying that the maids were the only ones in the house at the time they took her there for now that shes back for caution the parents fired all their maids.. idk just something different..<br>  and try explaining how the man knows that shes her sister maybe "those sorta look like my rents" or something...<br>  instead of 7 am.. say early in the morning because thats a little too over detailed. try describing her dress. was it old?dirty? maybe felt limp like a rag? try some pro nouns and adverbs or adjectives those will help <br>  well yeahh thats sorta what i think but over all your story was good id say a low 8<br>  -andrea<3|`|VESGTNzSaa	It is an excellent plot line but you need to offer more description to grab the reader's attention. I loved how it was mysterious at the start and then how you introduced her. I think you should describe the brother a bit more, like how they looked similar. You need to slow down with conclusion and make it longer, to explain it further.|`|31ba1fdf2248aeb7170e0ccabf1bb8ccaa	this story's too good. u need to expand it, this short version doesn't do it justice. Excellent twist btw, tho not COMPLETELY original - but, according to sherlock, there's "nothing new under the sun" anyway...<br>  <br>  anywho, you've got a WEE bit of a problem. you write the way your thoughts come into your mind<br>  <br>  PS!!<br>  <br>  It doesn't make any sense that they've never been able to find out who took her and then in a few weeks they can...<br>  <br>  you're going to have to fill that gap somehow...<br>  <br>  you write, judging by this short story, like a series of events.<br>  <br>  "first taylor did this, then she did that...then this..."<br>  <br>  you start all your  sentences with "taylor" or "she" for the most part.<br>  <br>  this is no good. The readers start getting bored by the monotony of the writing style.<br>  <br>  instead of a timeline approach, this then that, you need to LIVE EACH MOMENT in the writing.<br>  <br>  i mean, the whole "food drive doesn't come on sunday" really sold me into thinking you're an excellent writer at heart. that was an excellent way of showing her desperation. <br>  <br>  we always have to remember to make sure the reader is very very attached...<br>  <br>  ah, one more just general rule of thumb...<br>  <br>  there needs to be some other element in your story besides constant depression<br>  ____<br>  <br>  cheers!!
09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	Your plot sounds intriguing.  If you can write it so that it is original in its concept, not too formulaic, and if you can envision and create a compelling story, you may have a novel which would appeal to me.  You'll only know whether or not you've evolved a potentially great story when you've begun the actual writing.  Assuming that you're devoted to your ideas, my advice to you would be: Go for it!  See what you can write.  Additional advice: Take your time telling the story; write with emotion; be descriptive; and insert lots of dialogue.  But, perhaps you know all that!  Anyway, do write!  Good luck!|`|vrcxxRr8aa	The school for the magical and such has always been an interesting starting plot to me, but the book has to be well written to pull it off, including good characterization and character development.|`|W8F9PboZaa	Are you planning on making all 5 siblings main characters.

z9IoWlHGaa	You have to dance to the rhythm of the music. Don't worry. I have a solution to your problem. =). You should try looking at dance videos in you tube and try practicing the ones you like. Look for the groovy ones and the ones that have a fast beat. I think you tube is the best one for you. You should look at some home videos of peopple dancing to fast beat songs and try them. You'll improve! The effect isn't immediate but, u'll get used to dancing! Later on, you will be dancing like any other persson! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXeNJZqjzxo." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXeNJZqjz...</a> try this video!|`|jU0dGPzUaa	It's ok!

5AdVt7dEaa	If people were just looking at page one or just page two of your work, then they are missing the point.  I liked most of your pictures especially those on page 28 and 29.  They are the type of artistic work most photographers do.  Finally, I went back to your portraitures of your friends and family and yourself and noticed that everyone was enjoying themselves, was being themselves and having a good time. <br>  <br>   That is the essence of good photography.  Usually, people are stiff or uncomfortable in front of the camera, but you put them at ease.  So if you love what you are doing and your subjects like it too, you will be successful.<br>  <br>  Also, I think that the photo of the people making the circle in the snow has a sense of mystery and could be entered in a photo contest.  Finally,   the colors and design in the one titled 'elementary carnival' were excellent and a contest grade picture.|`|djNeNEOuaa	Well I looked at the first page and was getting ready to give you some bad news, however starting from the end and working back a ways, I think you do have talent and there are some really nice shots in there. I like the frosted window in particular.<br>  <br>  I say go for it you have the talent and desire, now you just need a guiding hand and more practice.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck.|`|dLHmyy2Qaa	You've got some quick snaps of family/friends which are nice but probably not what you're referring to. Others, especially outdoors are really good. I think you should continue with it in college, yes.|`|8XqzxKz9aa	HMMMM, there are some really cool pics, but I would say maybe take a couple classes at a community college and see where that takes you. But on a scale of 1-10 your about a 4.|`|AA11542772	I say yes you should continue I really like photo 90. However i think you should expand your horizons and take photos of landscape animals life or something besides just you lol.Good luck in what ever direction you decide to go!|`|W1GHZW3Caa	woops sorry i had a moment of dyslexia there. didn't read photography.|`|NS3pxwG0aa	uhh idk but nice monroe piercing|`|AwUN5uyIaa	yea, i like your sunglasses =]|`|JYAT5OTdaa	ask some people at the college what they think. who knows they may think that it is great. some of those pictures are actually really good. you make great baby photos. you should go with baby photography. lol. they are sooo cute !!|`|IqzqeNMVaa	some of them are really good. :)<br>  what city do you live in? its really pretty.|`|LZco6K5jaa	go for it|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	Photography is a highly competitive field. Making a bunch of silly faces and flipping the bird will get you nowhere...fast. Perhaps if you made a serious effort it would be worthwhile.<br>  <br>  Edit: Just to assure you I DID look at all the images. There is no consistency, just point and shoot images and once in a while you got lucky. That does not demonstrate control over the camera, which is what is needed. Hey, even a broken watch is right twice a day!|`|VALxlwYSaa	Nice! <br>  You should really give it a shot. Ha ha get it, shot? No jk. But yeah you should go for it your really good.<br>  And if the girl is you I like your hair a lot :D|`|b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	Well, to be honest, the first page really turned me off.  My thought was "oh great, another kid with a cheap little point and shoot digital camera who suddenly thinks they're a photographer."  <br>  <br>  Okay, seriously some of your pictures are nice, but the majority of them are very dull, ordinary snapshots.  They're great for sharing with your friends and family, but if you're seriously interested in photography then you need to change the way you think about taking pictures.  Towards the end of your pictures, you had some nice photos, especially some of the pictures with your family.  But most of the ones that you've been taking recently are just snapshots of yourself.  And just because you "photoshop" the picture by converting it to black and white or editing the colors will NOT make a boring snapshot more interesting than it actually is.  Photography is about getting interesting and meaningful pictures with your camera, not "photoshopping" your pictures on a computer.  And just because it's a digital camera, that doesn't instantly mean you will take great pictures every time.<br>  <br>  I also saw a lot of blurry pictures (especially one that you took of the sunset), so you need to have more practice with holding your camera steady.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to discourage you.  If you really want to learn about photography (and if you have the patience, passion, and discipline to learn), then you definitely can.  Anyone can learn pretty much anything if they want to and are willing to put the effort into it.  But, at the moment, I'm just saying that what I saw of your pictures was nothing really special.  Nice snapshots, yes definitely.  But you have a lot to learn.  Well, hey...that's what college is for, right?  I say go for it.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  LOL...Perki, I didn't even notice that picture!  Is this the one you're talking about?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/randis_reallycool/3280157001/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/randis_real...</a><br>  <br>  I didn't even really pay attention to the pictures on the first couple of pages.  They all looked like typical lame MySpace snapshots of herself.  She's lucky that I even bothered to keep looking.  It's kind of a shame too, because there are some interesting pictures, but you have to jump towards the end.  She probably won't even bother to read either of our answers though.  How much do you want to bet that this question will go to voters??  Or maybe she'll just chose one of the first answers and not bother reading any others.  <br>  <br>  I think most of the MySpace kids who post questions here just want a really simple, misspelled one line answer that says "kewl!  i like ur pics...do u liek photoshop???"|`|TQwhJSpraa	its great you should continue it especially if you really like it :]<br>  <br>  but to improve take less pics of yourself and more pics of animals nature flowers and what not|`|sBsFK2h5aa	I think your pretty good. Try taking more nature pictures. But you could definitly try college.|`|bghotovYaa	I think so...they are VERY professional.<br>  Go for it!
