Soprattutto per i pi giovani direi!  Le somande stupide sono domande serie mascherate.  Mettere una ciambella in un cd e scopreire che non funziona non  diverso dallo scoprire che anche nella nostra societ c' qualcosa che non funziona. L'angoscia c' in entrambi i casi.  Tot era un maestro nell'esprimerla "stupidamente".  Mi viene in mente "Miseria e Nobilit".  Ottima domanda!|`|8jYM2a5yaa	perch la ciambella nel lettore CD  un idea attraente :D|`|c8r8VvLiaa	Io ho risposto a quella intelligente.|`|fyGJFPm3aa	perch la vita e gi seria, si risponde pi volentieri alle domande scherzose|`|fx7Z8FGoaa	allora, nella domanda stupida ti possono rispondere tutti, bambini, adolescenti, adulti, anziani e sopratutto  un metodo facile - lo dico chiaro e tondo - per fare i 2 punti facili, senza sforzare il nostro cervellino!!    Invece nella tua domanda sull'immigrazione, l'argomento  pi serio, quindi gi ti dovrebbero rispondere un pubblico pi adulto e maturo, e sopratutto quelli che non vanno a caccia di punti, ma vogliono solo scrivere e ascoltare opnioni sul fenomento che tu hai proposto!    p.s. si ottengono pi risposte quando si fanno le domande negli orari di punta, ovvero quando ci sono pi utenti collegati, per esempio verso le 18, dopo cena..|`|f29bd3201a510263e55d25e1cc8d29e4aa	parlo per me: a volte dipende dal mio stato d'animo se sono in vena mi pice rispondere anche a domande impegnative,a volte per vengo su answers proprio perche non ho nulla da fare e quindi per non appesantire ulteriormente la materia grigia rispondo a domande stupide,ora infatti vado a rispondere ad un utente che chiede cosa succede se mette una ciambella nel cd...|`|c3ec7b199ea9ca14cd6231d72c2bbffbaa	Perch a domanda stupida equivale risposta stupida...che  piu' facile da dare di una risposta seria e intelligente...  se posti una domanda in cui chiedi che ore sn?? risponderanno in 30...se chiedi perch esistiamo ci saranno meno risposte e sicuramente il 99% saranno retoriche,scontate....|`|SnRsCStfaa	Perch nella vita ci vuole anche il divertimento!!! :)|`|COFOgXldaa	rispondere qui in answer e' un piccolo lavoro.

La tua domanda "stupida" evidentemente e' piu' facilmente ingeribile, non procura esami di coscienza..e non presuppone una conoscenza specifica di nessun argomento...(quindi alla portata di tutti)    Ecco il motivo perche' e' anche la piu' gettonata.|`|85910d5da6875ba45ef2aa45980890abaa	Io credo che la prima domanda sia stupida ma allo stesso tempo curiosa e divertente, mentre la seconda  ripetitiva e l'hanno gi proposta 345456727256fantamiliardi di volte.|`|xYLEZIGzaa	Percho si divertono a rispondere scherzosamente alle domande "sceme" oppure gli piace prendere in giro chi ha fatto la domanda...|`|uR1ay9yDaa	perch le persone trovano stupide le domande intelligenti|`|nkzVdqKcaa	Bah...Dipende in quale sezione inserisci la domanda, se la pianti in mezzo a "Yahoo answers" avrai una tuona di risposte perch la categoria  molto frequentata, se la metti che so, in Tauromachia non aspettartene neanche mezza (a parte forse la mia).

5ttA484waa	Ciao Laura! Come stai? Il diario  una buona idea, anche io da ragazzina lo tenevo, pur se non lo scrivevo spesso: comunque, fingevo di parlare con una persona amica e gli avevo anche dato un nome... solo che non mi ricordo pi quale fosse!! A volte l'ho scritto ridendo, altre piangendo disperata: a distanza di tanti anni, quando mi capita di risfogliarlo, mi viene da sorridere osservando come alcuni tipi di problemi siano uguali a tutte le et e come altri, con l'invecchiamento (eheheh) appaiano invece distanti anni luce: spero che un giorno, rileggendolo, anche tu possa trovare spunto per sorridere dolcemente, ripensando alla forza con cui hai saputo superare problemi pi grandi di te (e ricordati che non sei mai sola... ci siamo anche noi!). Ti accendo la stellina della speranza!!! Un bacio grande! Notte :)|`|Qld5ABOEaa	io scrivo cm se parlassi proprio al diario,cm se fosse personificato...t consiglio d inziare presentandoti un p e poi piano piano d scriverci i tuoi pensieri,emozioni,ci k t succede.. carino poi mettere delle immagini o foto k riguardano qll determinata situazione xk lo rendono pi vivace...la cosa pi bella  rileggerlo dp qlk anno e rimmergerti nei ricordi passati..bacio|`|ZYbewkf2aa	il diario  kome se fosse la tua coscienza... quello ke pensi senza maskere...secondo me  indifferente...deve contenere delle riflessioni...io ad esempio nn l'ho indirizzo a nessuno...parto con la penna senza neanke rendermi conto...CIAU ;-)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|s3qMF4Cnaa	io ho tenuto un diaro per tre anni...ora ce l'ho ancora ma scrivo di rado...quando sono gi...e ho bisogno di sfogarmi...penso che sia una cosa molto bella...rileggerlo adesso a distanza d anni m fa sorridere...ricordare storie passate...amicizie che ho perso crescendo...non c' un modo per iniziare particolare...direi di metterti l..davanti al foglio...con tanta voglia di raccontare...e lascia scorrere la pena...come se mettessi l quello che hai in testa...scrivi di getto...penso che sia la cosa migliore...quando le emozioni sn ancora fresche...spero di averti risp...stai tranquilla...un bacio ciau|`|ghLW8OqHaa	no..conviene..cio  pi bello come se lo scrivessi a qualcuno!! magari al tuo diario stesso!! come se gli raccontassi tutto quello k fai e tutti i tuoi pensieri!!  bello sai?? anke se io non ne ho!! ciao e in bocca al lupo!|`|I1AbNd4yaa	Ciao piccolina,credo che non abbia molto importanza se lo scrivi in un modo o nell'altro,di solito si comincia con : "caro diario,...." anche perch scrivendo a lui non fai altro che parlare a te stessa.  Hai avuto una bellissima idea ,l'unica cosa che vorrei consigliarti  di essere sempre molto sincera quando ti troverai davanti a quelle pagine bianche,non scrivere come se fosse un diario di bordo ( ...oggi alle ore 12 sono stata interrogata.. ore 16 mi sento gi...ecc) scrivi come se parlassi al tuo angelo custode,digli tutto ci che provi anche se qualche volta proverai o sentirai cose negative,sfogati se necessario ma non dimenticare di scrivere tutte le tue sensazioni,ferma sui quei fogli il tuo IO pi segreto e intimo,forse un giorno quando li leggerai ti saranno di aiuto e se non ne avrai bisogno saranno comunque dolci ricordi...  Un bacio|`|1e5cf9e227fcd900cf7f8fff5812919daa	io lo scrivevo in stile litizzetto, hai presente i suoi libri? ironizzare su certe cose mi aiutava a sdrammatizzare e ad avere nuovi punti di vista|`|3x2Bblwaaa	Io l'ho tenuto per tanti anni, e scrivevo come se l'avesso letto una persona.|`|6JYNXUQ6aa	io l'ho sempre scritto come se parlassi a una persona, come se mi raccontassi.. a volte lo facevo leggere alla mia migliore amica e sembrava mi rivolgessi a lei!  cmq bellissimo tenere un diario!!! ora non lo faccio piu' npn tanto xch sn grande ma xch se lo leggesse qualcuno credo mi sotterrerei! prendine uno col lucchetto eh! e nascondilo bene! baci|`|6BdL8N7vaa	consideralo come un tuo amico a cui puoi confidare tutto..|`|GTf48L5Taa	Io ho tenuto un sacco di diari...e chissa perch perdevo sempre le chiavi del lucchetto, quindi dovevo romperlo!! xD  Cmq, apparte gli scherzi, io quando ero pi piccola, parlavo o a me stessa (un p da pazzi), oppure proprio al diario, come se fosse una persona a cui racconto le mie cose...poi ho fatto un diario con due delle mie migliori amiche, raccontadoci le cose...e ne ho fatto anche uno parlando con il mio ex...per lui non l'ha mai letto, perch l'ho riempito di insulti... :P Una volta ho fatto un regalo alla mia migliore amica e al suo ragazzo..gli ho comprato due diari uguali, e siccome abitavano lontani, scrivevano ognuno si questo diario, e poi appena si rivedevano, se lo scambiavano e leggevano quello che avevano scritto nel tempo in cui non si erano visti.. :)  Insomma, hai un sacco di scelte...puoi parlare alla tua migliore amica, al ragazzo che ti piace, ad un tuo caro, o anche ad una persona che non c' pi...  Un bacio :*

"M.yahoo.com" (or another country's equivalent) is not the Yahoo.com version for mobiles, but a new site layout, which is tested on a couple of users without asking them for their consent first. Some users like it, but most don't. Many are upset, as they cannot get to their mails without clicking many different links before they get to read anything.

Answers points help you build your reputation on Yahoo! Answers and show the world what you have to offer.     You need points to ask a question but you can quickly earn the points back when you resolve your question and by giving answers that are picked as the best answer.    The points table linked below summarizes how many points you get for each of the different actions you take.     The points allow the community to recognize how active and helpful you've been, and they give you another excuse to brag to your friends.    The levels mark your activity and show what Answers usage privileges you earned.     The more points you accumulate, the higher your level, and the more privileges you get.     ?

nErAWfHxaa	If you ask questions, you have to wait for four (4) hours after asking the question in order to choose the "best answer." That's to give folks a fair chance to log in and find your question. Many of us log on and off periodically during the day and we may not be online when you posted.    Once the four (4) hours have elapsed, go back to view the question. You can do that by clicking on "My Profile" near the top the page, right hand side under the word "discover."    Once you're at your profile, look under your avatar (photo) and you'll see a list of all the questions you've answered plus a tab you can click to see the questions where you were chosen as "best answer," the questions you've asked and the questions you've starred.    Click on the word questions and you'll see the list of your questions, click the question and it shows you not only the question but all the answers. There will be a blue box under each answer. Click the box of the answer you liked best. You will get 3 points for choosing.    Be sure you pick the "best answer" before the time for answering expires or it'll be too late, it'll go into voting.     IF YOU DIDN'T ASK THE QUESTION, to vote on unresolved questions click the "answer" toolbar at the top of the page then click on the "vote" tab and it'll show you a bunch of questions in voting.|`|KN36rGMvaa	Wait for 4 hours after you submit the question and then go back to the question, you will have a blue tab under each answer, "Select As Best Answer", click the tab on the answer you consider to be the best.

Cheers  -Will|`|6qsTmMQaaa	To pick a best answer yourself, you have to wait four hours before the bubbles appear. The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer. You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.    To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	You cant ... yet.    You must wait until at least 4 hours have passed from the time you posted your question.

Under each answer that you got, you will see a big blue tab that reads, "Choose As Best Answer" ... just click that tab under the answer you like best, click "Submit", and you're done.

t2M1kXY4aa	"Fluff" questions get lots of answers.    REAL questions tend to get fewer answers, but usually BETTER answers.    Just the way it is.  Serious questions might take a few minutes to answer, and most Y!A users won't spare those few minutes to think up and type out a good answer.      Think about it ... unless an answer is chosen as Best Answer, it counts for 2 points ... regardless whether it's a good, detailed, well-thought-out answer ... or it's a "yes/no".  There is no motivation (points-wise) for users to answer the more complicated/technical/involved questions.    You need to increase traffic TO your question ... do that by making your subject line interesting.  To get answers, you first need more people clicking to open your question!|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	I'm going to agree with the person above me.   Questions like "Do these shoes look good?" take absolutely no thought, therefore people can answer them without exerting much effort.

r8drw5Dcaa	If the question is "Resolved", you cannot delete it, they are up forever.  They only way to keep others from seeing them is to get your account suspended, but even this won't delete the questions you asked.  But lets say someone is on your buddy list.  Well if your suspended permanently they can't click on your profile to look at past questions you asked.  But if they answered those private questions before it was suspended, they can go through their list of questions answered to go back to them.. understand?  You could report your own questions and have friends report it too, but that may get you suspended and well if you don't want that to happen then I guess you couldn't do that.|`|KN36rGMvaa	If the question is "Open", then click "Edit" > "Delete".

OaQWUfNoaa	I've just finished reporting one of them...it is a site that contains adult content- pictures that are supposedly of the guy's ex-girlfriend. It tells people to copy and paste a URL into forums to get enough clicks to unlock more pictures. I've seen similar links before on other forums (actually within Facebook itself), mainly Ihatejulia, which I believe the text is copied straight from as it actually calls the girl Julia in one line. I checked the website out before I reported it- even though I was certain it contained adult content. I knew it was spam though. Don't click on it, just to be sure you don't get spyware or whatever, type it in yourself if you want to verify what it is (that way the person doesn't get that click either- if it even works).

9c7c4192016169baf847ee7ae4705422aa	Consider this:    Your image "avatar" will only not go any farther in width than it is now, but the ehigth can be adjusted to much larger.  Basically, you can have a tall picture; you cannot have a wide picture.    In terms of actual length and width, consider that you cannot use an image that is, say, 100-length and 500-width, and expect it to be detailed.  You can, however, use an image with 500-length and 100-width and have it rather detailed.      Best of luck!
21hxcVyLaa	yes I have, I answered a question legit and just because someone can't handle the truth they will whine about it and they remove the answer.|`|KN36rGMvaa	Yes, but I appealed and won, and the answer was re-instated.        Cheers  -Will|`|22wKBmAyaa	A couple of hours ago (sad) we answered but,  the question was deleted. The asking persons profile picture was literally F^ ck, so it didn't surprise me.
CInHTKJcaa	well go to your profile  click on questions  then you can see stars received at the left of the question (though stars mean nothing at all)  or check your overall stars on your profile page    Edit:  you wanna know who starred them?  well click on the link to the question (open the question in new tab) and then move your mouse to the star like thing below your question....if you have received any stars, the star-ers will be listed there...|`|22wKBmAyaa	I'm people that star-ers your Q: Gotta luv it.

DFDKL0zXaa	I like the challenge of reading some of the questions where people don't take the time to spell correctly. It doesn't really bother me. Its going to be a problem later in their life not taking the time to practice proper spelling.    Here is a cool paragraph so you can learn something and get a laugh too.    i cdnuolt blveiee taht I cluod aulaclty uesdnatnrd waht I was rdanieg. The phaonmneal pweor of the hmuan mnid, aoccdrnig to a rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it dseno't mtaetr in waht oerdr the ltteres in a wrod are, the olny iproamtnt tihng is taht the frsit and lsat ltteer be in the rghit pclae. The rset can be a taotl mses and you can sitll raed it whotuit a pboerlm. Tihs is bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the wrod as a wlohe. Azanmig huh? yaeh and I awlyas tghuhot slpeling was ipmorantt! if you can raed tihs forwrad it.    Some people will tend to prefer brown rice over white thus rendering the saying "like white on rice" moot.    I tend to overlook others mistakes for, "how should we see the sliver in other eyes when we have a log in our own"    Just my three cents=    Whats the deal with these two words, ALOT, dsylexic?    I am just teasing, I like to read a good political rant especially when they encompass heaven, dry humor, and others shortcomings.|`|9VaWal2Daa	If it's an honest typo, .......I can SEE that.....and I ignore it.  Nobody is perfect, (But I TRY to be!)     If it's  text speak.....yeah, not my generation, but I get it, and I can deal .    If it's every other word........then that's just annoying and looks unintelligent.    I roll my eyes, but hold my tongue.     But what I will NOT tolerate, is someone who is posting some RANT, cursing out someone else for their "stupidity"......and then spells "stupidity" wrong.     Oh no.......if you are going to do that sort of thing.....then the person BETTER double check their OWN spelling, because I will be all over THAT like white on rice!    And I am a political blogger by nature, and I see ALOT of that sort of thing.............coming mostly from REPUBLICANS, cursing a blue streak at Liberals or democrats, and their rants look like they were written by dsylexic third graders.     That's just manna from heaven for me!    You can't possibly be taken seriously or intelligently, if your posts are filled with  countless misspellings.     and I don't mean TYPO's.......I mean people who can't SPELL. Period.     People who want to rant about Harry REED, or Nancy Peelozi.     (It's REID and Pelosi, for the record. )     If a person wants to rant.......it helps to have SOME clue what you are talking about........and SPELLING is the first indicator, if the person is intelligent or not.     Just my 2 cents.|`|22wKBmAyaa	If you are over educated will i get hung up on (gramatry) David Bowie.  Grametry doesn't appear to anything close to a word according the over educated spell checker. Grametry is supposed to be close to grammar. But it appears we have completely baffled spell cheedker.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	If you spell words incorrectly, it can confuse people who may otherwise be able to help you.  Stay awake in English class, for crying out loud!|`|KN36rGMvaa	It demonstrates a lack of intelligence.        Cheers  -Will|`|fHIXRFqHaa	Because you can't understand the answer. Some people are in serious need of an English class. There is nothing more beautiful than clear and precise grammar, spelling and punctuation. Just an opinion.|`|TYl7kmPeaa	its annoying  duh  you would understand if you could actually spell and have correct grammar|`|qLvhoRpsaa	To me it shows one or all of the following:  1.  Under age (such as you must be 13 or younger)  2.  Major lack of intelligence.  3.  Sloppy and therefore not the kind of person I want to give or get advice from.  4.  Only kids thinks that their stupid words like "s8terboi" are cutting edge, they are NOT!  5.  It makes me sad to see that people have such a poor grasp of the English language.  I know that if I am reading a well thought out sentence, good grammar and spelling and punctuation, it's always a pleasure to read. I get a headache and irritated with those that do not bother or cannot use proper English. Peace:)  Edit: Thank you Weasel for pointing out my mistakes.   Peace:)|`|xJezFnRMaa	i know right?!  some people over react d:    but whatever /:      it annoys me too sometimes ha|`|hwHJ1vzCaa	It wants to make sure your words are spelled correctly so people who want to answer your question can read your question.|`|U8gIdoXFaa	I dont know. Spelling police annoy the hell out of me. They dont seem to understand that the majority of it is 'text speak' and the rest is often just a typo or something. If the message gets through ok, who cares about spelling.      I does seem like the older generation who complain about this, but not all oldies do. Im 46 and it doesnt bother me. Im more interested in what's being said not how its being said. The others are just pedantic know alls. Ignore them.|`|vJj6lo4faa	bcox som o mose pepel ducking hat riddin long spelingz    gate eat?|`|oEfnqmp3aa	If you wish to convey an idea to others, it is best to make sure that you communicate in the clearest way possible. That way you will without a doubt get your message across clearly. Not to mention poor communication can come across as sounding undereducated, and is often followed by additional supporting evidence.|`|D2sMKkchaa	So you can actually understand the question/answer and not all people know slang like this:  U no me ppl dnt u?

But it just means that you just joined the community, so you get 100 points for starting your Yahoo!Answers account. And since it still hasn't passed the time 57 minutes ago, you just get one point because you just visit the site. And as for 17 seconds ago, it means that it has already passed 12:00 in CA, so the system renews everything and you get 1 more point.|`|VC5mEULTaa	The 'yahoo day' resets at midnight PST, so you got one point for visiting yesterday at (about) 11:13 pm PST, and another point for logging in today (about) 12:10 am PST.

To1nHfpuaa	ive noticed that too... amazon "was" my favourite online buying site. they started doing it around christmas and especially on the items that were out of stock in most toy stores and as for the market place i dont even bother buying from there... you can get most items brand new for the same price!|`|klDiZgKQaa	I totally agree, I rarely even bother with Amazon anymore.

You can use music that you upload to the web or music already uploaded to the web by other people (faster, easier method).    The song file must be an MP3 file and the web address for that file must end in .mp3. Also, only certain services (music hosting sites, file hosting sites, or blogging services) will allow you to create or use a hotlink to an audio file. So, if you use a search engine to find links, you should definitely check to see if it's working on your page after saving your blast.

5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	Your yahoo account comes as a package and can only be deleted as a whole. However once your questions and answers go to the vote or resolved they become the property of yahoo and stay in yahoo archive available for searching and browsing and only the yahoo team can remove them.                            But you can make them invisible with the following steps.        * Blank out your avatar to the grey silhouette.      * Change your nickname or just leave it blank.      * Close any links to your 360, and email.      * Delete your open questions and answers.      * Set your Network and Q&A to private.      * Delete your contacts and fans. To delete fans block then unblock.    Then just leave it. After you've applied the alterations no search will find your Q&A,s.

Maybe you don't understand, Yahoo!Answers is for asking and answering questions.  It isn't the "Joke Time with JJ! Show!".    As for the disgusting questions... they are there when no one reports them.  Did YOU report them?  No?  Then don't complain.|`|AA11366224	Someone complained.  You automatically get a Violation Notice.  Appeal and you will get your points back and the person who complained gets ignored in future.|`|mDkUmEUzaa	How frustrating!  Did you start the question with a question - if you know what I mean.  Did you say something like - "What do you think of this joke?" then tell the joke?  If it wasnt a question then you wont win an appeal.  It is really frustrating I know.  Someone once told a joke and I replied saying "ha thats funny" and I got reported!  It was perceived as "chatting" and not a proper answer to a question.   I appealed and lost my 10 points.  Some people have nothing better to do with their time do they.  Some of the questions on here are disgusting and yet people complain about little things like this.  I dont know what they get out of it.|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	Trolls - some "people" have nothing better to do than report innocent questions and keep the filth that some users leave.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	If it got zero answers after a certain amount of time it gets removed...

That would be either "not an answer", insulting, or chat.    You said "they said".  If you got a violation e-mail, post it here in a question and people can tell you the problem.  We need to see the question in the original form. If all you did was post a joke, that is a violation of the rules.  There are specific rules about posting jokes.     If all that happened was it was removed with no violation, it was probably "in voting" and someone picked NBA with their vote and it was removed as not having a "Best Answer".      Age doesn't matter.  Violations can be found years later by voting on old questions or doing searches on subjects of interest.|`|081NXWAeaa	trolls out agen they just report u for no reason    every day i sign in i get a violation notice but u get used to it|`|hfr9rLjkaa	It might be that you emailed people asking them to go back to your question.I know i received an email from you.It didn't offend me at all but some people don't like it.don't worry about it you sponge bob lover! lol xx|`|ta1ALj4qaa	Dont worry about it... weve all had one!!|`|3d6119cf4a9df27c12f9843ac9018153aa	Appeal!

When I contacted Yahoo! customer service they said 999 means I'm having a communications problem with my ISP.  Yet, when I remove the link the problem went away.    I pointed this out to Yahoo! but they then provided suggestions on using the Yahoo! Mail search feature, even though I said Yahoo! Answers.    From my searches on the web, 999 looks to be a "catch all" error code and occurs only when no other error condition applies.    Putting links into your initial question seems - SOMETIMES - to cause an error condition.  I'm not sure if you need to have so many questions or a certain level to avoid this error.      I did notice you can add / update the question with a link AFTER the initial question.  I did this with a friend who also saw this problem and it worked for him after we talked about it.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	It's the link that causes the problem.

Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."    The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.    It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret.   All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption and guesswork.    A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).    The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.    The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.    If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.    It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.|`|KN36rGMvaa	"Top Contributer"  is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.

Each Answers user can be a Top Contributor in up to three categories.     Badges come and go on Monday mornings. Yahoo keeps the formula secret, and it's subject to change at any moment. It probably also varies from category to category. Experienced users have formed guesses, but they're just GUESSES.    You probably need around:    ? 30-50 answers per week in the category.  ? At least 20 ''best answers'' in the category within the last 3 weeks.  ? 200 or more total points per week (including all answers, Best Answers, votes, and "thumbs up") in the category.  ? At least a 10% best answers in your chosen category.    If your level of participation falls, you will likely lose your badge. Concentrate on participating regularly and giving high-quality answers in just a few categories to earn or keep a badge.    Good luck.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	To be a TC, you need to show knowledge in one to three different categories, except Polls & Surveys and Jokes & Riddles. Choose the three you want to be a TC in, and just keep answering in the categories. Ideally, you need ten percent best answer, but I'm not sure, for I've seen people with seventeen percent best answer overall with two TC badges. Whatever it is, you need to prove that you are knowledgeable in a certain category, and the Yahoo! Answers community will allow you to have the badge(s).
e1amuRXSaa	copy it...    then paste the picture to the PAINT...    click on the magnifier....|`|yvoGbxshaa	try a different browser that usually works I use the flock it has the firefox engine but so much better I noticed it ended my no post problem too|`|5AwLW1buaa	Try again in a few hours, that's all it is.    Took my 4 hours to upload this picture to 360.|`|8a38a4a73d5d1f1deb43f39f15d98918aa	Check the URL - maybe try copy and pasting it directly into the address bar rather than just clicking on the hyperlink.    Although your avatar picture is small, it's looks appealing - I hope those other photos are equally so :)|`|e1c66ff4cd49e81cbfc0dc4a9da60358aa	FIREFOX is the best solution ;)   http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/  if that doesn't work  maybe there is a problem in connection speed or you need to put a proxy  usually i restart my connection for this.
0OWxFJNLaa	The error message appears for several reasons like:  Speed of your internet connection is too slow to display the page/upload the content. If this is the case u probably are on dial up...  so I would suggest u using opera or firefox cause these browsers are faster than ie and r able to display the pages even if ur internet speed is very slow.  Anyway, quick tip is: right click the cross that appears in the upper left corner of the enlarged pic (that actually is a blank box n not a pic ) n select "show picture" ( if u r trying to enlarge the pics u received in email... I don't know what exactly u mean by uploading photos).   Chances are the pics ur talking r some links to some web pages that don't exist anymore and hence the error message is shown when u try clicking them.   Good luck|`|yvoGbxshaa	check your browser settings too Sophi try a different browsers some of of them I use won't let me log onto yahoo because yahoo  security to low yahoo authentication is from 2006 it's too old

uVuYdcRcaa	Hi,            My ex works for Marks and Spencers so I just asked him and he said Marks and Spencers vouchers can only be used for Marks and Spencers.    If however, you have vouchers that can be used in different high street stores you will see loads of shop logos to where you can use them - if you see no logo for M&S then no you can't use them in the store.    But to answer question - no, M&S vouchers are to be used in M&S stores.    Lx

jhdpLhNcaa	For me it was the time that I was accepted in two different branches to study at university, I had a really hard time to decide between the two of them.One was the school I was interested to go & the other was the major I had always wanted to study but not at a school I wished. I chose the first one based on what my family & most of my teachers said but I never got satisfied with it & always regret it ! So if you are at the point of making an important decision be careful and think of it thoroughly. Time passes and you never have the chance of going back to change!|`|meG2ZZ5paa	I had to choose between two subjects, senior year............      I asked people on yahoo, friends and family on advice.........      I put out the pros and cons on each thing    and looked at what I wanted and not let anyone else influence my decision

If not there isn't a lot you can apart from contacting Yahoo! and waiting to see what they say. It could take a while though so be prepared to wait|`|1vi7PX0Faa	There must be some wrong answer in one of the questions.

AA11307940	I don't think it means anything significant, I see 11:11 twice a day and I'm not looking for it. This has been happening for years, so I used those numbers to play keno, etc, and nothing happened. I didn't win. So it's just a coincidence. I always think of someone and then the phone rings and they are on it. Or they will contact me on the computer. This is strong in your mind so it wakes you up at that time. Our mind does funny things to us.|`|2JAB7ODsaa	It means you will die 4444 hours after the first time you saw that number!!!    HAHA JK.. It's just a complete coincidence..... It's would have always been around as much, your just noticing it more now cause it's driving you nuts lol    :)|`|824365cb6706cbc66055bd834f29387eaa	i often look at things like clocks and there all at significant times like 12:34 or 16:16 but i see alot of 2's followed by 11's, i was born 2nd november 2/11. id usually say its just coinsdence but if u see it on something you can bet on id do it coz you may just win :)
f202428f23f47abf8c99a259c26fc13eaa	The BCC line (blind courtesy copy), is an address line meant to completely hide the addresses entered on it.    With Yahoo, you are required to put at least one valid address on the TO line---so most people put their own address there and everyone else on BCC. Your address is the only thing anyone will see.|`|7bnQmXksaa	You must put the people in the BCC column Test it first and make sure I'm correct.

VC5mEULTaa	Its your link that you have in your question that is causing it(some links set off a red flag when going through yahoo's filter which causes them not to post).    *Usually* if you submit your question without the link, and then when your question shows up add the link in then(Edit-> add details) it will show up then. However, I have seen several occasions where it causes your question to go missing again.|`|rhreN8wbaa	Well this one appeared.
