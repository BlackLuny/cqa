Thsi one included. Vincent is still obsessed with Lucretia, and the only thing Yuffie does that ever could be construed as romantic interest is in FF7, where she refers to Tifa as "Boobs" if you recruit Yuffie into your party during the time Tifa is leading the group.|`|PxxWqCjwaa	It's never said in the games but people just like to pair them together. A bit like people like to say that Joey and Phoebe have a 'thing' in friends.

ou1gZjacaa	Well that depends... whether you actually want to play a horror game.<br>  The IGN review of RE5 says that it has pretty much abandoned the RE series horror aspect and gone to focus on the action. RE5 is not so much a horror as it is an action.<br>  FEAR 2 on the other hand has it's "HOLY SH*T" moments and is a solid FPS with an intriguing story. If your a fan of the first I would recommend this.<br>  I just bought this today and it's kick *** and I'm buying RE5 in April.<br>  They both deserve your attention but if you want to be scared more than FEAR 2 is your game... if you don't mind that RE5 won't scare you than you may want to wait.<br>  Good luck in deciding mate!|`|vUVxS9Xhaa	Well here is a review on FEAR 2...based on this review i decided not to get it atleast for now....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/fear2/index.html?tag=result;title;2" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/f...</a><br>  <br>  as for resident evil i suggest you wait and see what score it gets...seriously these days its bad to blindly buy games they could end up sucking big time...i read about every game on this site or other sites before i decide to buy or not.<br>  <br>  The marketing for the game may look cool but the gameplay could very easily be awful and you have no way to know unless you find out.|`|JzYlReESaa	I bought FEAR 2 a couple of months ago, It was a great game, but ended rather abruptly and left you wanting the story to continue. <br>  Not that that deterred from the experience, the visuals, sound, game-play and the story were all amazing. <br>  <br>  Bought Resident Evil 5 today and played it. If your a fan of the series you might be taken aback by some of the drastic changes and the setting. Still a great game so far, but the new editions take some getting used too. <br>  <br>  My Opinion, FEAR 2 is definitely worth $60, it's a hugely atmospheric game with great action and some Truly scary moments, It leaves you hanging for FEAR 3.<br>  <br>  Resident Evil 5 drops the fear factor slightly an thus becomes a far more action oriented experience. Still loads of fun and the AI and Co-Op is fantastic, and a great way to hang out with a mate.<br>  <br>  Not really an answer, but you've got more to work with:-)<br>  Take Care|`|69c2d12eeb7bbe9bd822770056d87755aa	i totally agree with david c.i bought fear 2 cuz i like first person shooter but i love everything scary blood gore and bla bla.The game is good i really enjoy the shooting part and its not scary all the time but there are some moments when it can make u jump lol.Resident evil im probably gonna buy itcuz i loved the 4 it was very good but i have no idea how the 5 is going to be.if i were you i suggest you go on www.youtube.com and type in fear 2 gameplay and check if u might like the game or what and do the same for resident evil 5 .if u have playstation 3 go to the playstation store there is the fear demo that u can download and u can play it its really cool .Of course it s just a demobut it can give little taste of the game and help with your choice sooo good luck with ur game :)|`|PxxWqCjwaa	Resident Evil 5.

As of now, there has not been anything said about bringing it stateside.|`|7W5JCf4Naa	If you're referring to Kingdom Hearts 3, meaning referring to the letter Sora, Riku, and Kairi received at the end of Kingdom Hearts II, there is no information about it. It hasn't been announced as an official title.<br>  <br>  However, if you're referring to Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, which people used to assume was Kingdom Hearts 3 after they saw the secret ending in Kingdom Hearts II, that game is still in progress. People expect it to come out late 2009 or early 2010. The storyline is about the three chasers/keyblade apprentices (Terra, Aqua, Ven) and their search for the missing keyblade master (Xehanort - the old man from the secret ending, not Xemnas's other) and his apprentice. It takes place 10 years before the events of Kingdom Hearts 1, and covers how Maleficent obtained some of the princesses of heart, why Roxas resembles Ven, and maybe how Kairi arrived at the Destiny Islands.

It will be released in Japan on May 30, 2009 and has a rumored NA release date of August 31, 2009.

This game will be for the NDS. <br>  <br>  Kingdom Hearts Coded is about a new mysterious message that appears in Jiminy's journal that was wiped out in the events of Kingdom Hearts Chain of Memories.

8FlSSQIGaa	if you really want to play it go ahead and play it. but remember, 1. its a game based off of a movie, which means that it IS a bad game. it was rushed to be out in time for the movie to be released. it will have clumsy controls and terrible gameplay. 2. its based on planet of the apes, the RECENT one. which was a bad movie to begin with! so a game based on a bad movie does not sound like a game for success. but like i said. if you want to play it. just do it and find out for yourself. if youre not a very serious gamer youre probably gonna like it. if you are a serious gamer, you probably wouldnt be asking this question in the first place.

We answer the question with our fists in Atlus' upcoming beat-'em-up.<br>  <br>  The white suit, the '80s hairdo, and instructions such as "Beat down crime and restore peace!" are what Tokyo Beat Down is all about. This arcade beat-'em-up is set in the streets of Tokyo, and you play from the viewpoint of three different cops. It's full of hilarious references to video games and bad cop shows, and the dialogue is very well done to convey the over-the-top attitudes of the beast cops. These go-get-'em law enforcers are labeled as such because of their questionable approach to fighting crime. However, in their defense, they do what it takes to get the job done so that justice is served.<br>  <br>  Fight crime with your bare hands.<br>  <br>  You initially play as Lewis Cannon, a cop who refuses to drive, ignores the details on arrest warrants, and fights crime with his bare hands--and other assorted weapons that he may pick up on the street. Constantly chided by his colleagues and superiors for his reckless behavior and slightly excessive use of force, Cannon, however, is completely focused on giving the bad guys what they deserve--a knuckle to the face. Tokyo Beat Down is a classic side-scrolling beat-'em-up, similar to Double Dragon, where opponents will show up from either side of the screen and you button-mash your way to victory. As you clear each screen, an arrow pointing to the right blinks with the word "Go!" It's exactly like playing old-school 2D side-scrollers as you make your way through the streets of Akihabara and Shibuya, kicking oil cans and telephone booths to uncover items. There's no girlfriend or princess to save--at least from what we've played--but there is the lovely Rika Hyodo, a cop with a bare midriff and extra-short shorts to give the game a bit of a feminine touch.<br>  <br>  Fighting is easy to pick up since it's so basic, and the game does a good job of introducing new techniques as you progress. The Y and X buttons are for punching and kicking, and if you hold down the R button with Y or X, you can execute a more powerful move. Double-tapping left or right on the D pad will let you dash, and you can move up and down to quickly get out of the way if a thug fires a gun at you. The B button is to jump, and A is to pick up weapons and restorative items, such as hamburgers and sandwiches, along the way. If you time your attacks correctly, you can fire off your gun, which won't cost you any bullets. Otherwise, there are a variety of weapons you can obtain to mow down criminals. Don't worry, though; the bullets are made out of rubber. To fire, you have to bring out your weapon with the L button and hold it while tapping Y or X. Cannon is much quicker with his fists, and because of the delay in drawing your weapon, it's not that handy unless you're relatively clear and can fire from the other side of the screen. Shotguns and rocket launchers are fun, though, so there's no reason to dismiss them entirely.<br>  <br>  The story unravels in between your police work with amusing telephone conversations and reprimands at the office. Think of cheesy cop shows from the '70s and '80s as these beast cops go around town and get down to business. Cannon will utter classic lines like "Looks like I have a date with...justice!" and once you complete a level the words "You beat them down!" will appear across the screen. As you progress through the game, you'll learn more about the seedy underbelly of Tokyo and find that there are multiple paths to follow, which will lead to different game endings. After briefings with your boss you can choose to go fight some crime or check out other districts of Tokyo and talk to the locals. The neighborhoods you'll wander through convey the feel and vibe of the diverse metropolis, and they're a blast to go through while laying down the law. Atlus does another fantastic job with the localization; there's a lot of great dialogue, and outrageous one-liners will make you laugh because they're so absurd.<br>  <br>  They do what it takes to get the job done.<br>  <br>  Leave it up to Atlus to localize another offbeat game that would otherwise go unnoticed unless you like to import your DS games from Japan. Tokyo Beat Down is a lot of fun without taking itself too seriously. You'll have to check it out if you like arcade beat-'em-ups, because it's much more convenient to play without coins. Keep that Lewis Cannon in check, because your date with justice is set on March 31.|`|GxaGHGBNaa	For DS<br>  MUST HAVE!<br>  Ace Attorney 1,2,3 and 4 (Phoenix Wright and Apollo Justice)<br>  I love the ace attorney series<br>  1.Professor layton<br>  2.Pokemon Diamond<br>  3.Eledees(Wii and sequel is now out on DS)<br>  4.Spectrobes(1 and 2)<br>  5.Animal crossing <br>  <br>  For wii<br>  1.Zelda<br>  2.Metroid Prime 3<br>  3.Mario galaxy<br>  4.No More Heroes<br>  5.Resident Evil 4<br>  <br>  Don't forget the classic gamecube remakes<br>  1.Pikmin 1 and 2<br>  2.Metroid Prime 1 and 2<br>  3.Chibi Robo|`|wb8WwWMNaa	The Godfather for Wii: it's totally like GTA for Wii, funnest game yet!!

uctxzjIIaa	There's no real rule. Having a 4-year degree definitely will help, in that it not only will get you the basic skills, but also show that you have the dedication to work for years on a single goal, which is pretty important.<br>  <br>  Regardless of how you get your skills, the best way to get into the industry is to find a group of like-minded people and work together to make a game demo. You can then shop it around to companies, and when you find one interested in making it, they typically will hire the entire team to work on completing it. A slight variation on this would be making a mod for an existing game (Valve was so impressed with CounterStrike that they hired the creators to continue developing it as an official product). But you'll want to do this in a team; companies don't really care about people who work alone, since professional game development is a team project.|`|rBWm8pPuaa	3 or 4 but its up to the company you want to for though I've check them out they usually ask for 3-4 years|`|mUgHojvgaa	it depends on what kind u want to be but its around 4 years in computer development and 2 years in computer graphics

8FlSSQIGaa	uhhhh they are both pretty terrible. but i would say that sonic riders zero gravity is better by default. just because ironman was quite possibly the thrid worst game ever made. only behind #2 aquaman for the ps2 and #1 E.T. the extraterrestrial for colecovision|`|2SYrVb3faa	Both of those games got terrible reviews.  If they are your only choices, I would say go with sonic|`|daq5ySEPaa	Sonic Riders Zero Gravity, its better than you think<br>  Iron Man was really bad, don't bother|`|HCbbncSkaa	Though Sonic Riders is bad, Ironman is terrible, so I'd recommend getting Sonic Riders. That is, if these are your only 2 choices, Otherwise, you could get Super Mario Galaxy, Super Smash Bros Brawl, Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Zack and Wiki, No More Heroes, or any of the other hundreds of good games the Wii has to offer.|`|DJ4y1QkCaa	I would have to agree with the others that sonic is a better choice.  And Mario Kart is awesome.  Some other good games for the wii are:<br>  <br>  Mario Party 8<br>  Resident evil: the umbrella chronicles<br>  ghost squad<br>  Smash brothers<br>  and believe it or not, Monopoly...<br>  <br>  hope this helped|`|z4KDb5l3aa	Neither. Get Mario Kart and Super Mario Galaxy :)|`|uRTXwntCaa	yeah mario kart or smash bros for wii ar awsome
z4KDb5l3aa	Solution 1, The owners of the Gamestop website are lazy bastards and haven't updated your card info yet or<br>  Solution 2, You just have to wait. Website lag maybe?

9WTUjwUVaa	i think it was easier just to cover and take your time but then i found out the grenades just kept coming<br>  <br>  the best way to do it is by going on a particular side and working on it once you move up so does everyone else<br>  <br>  try and work for your next cover point instead of your next checkpoint and you should be fine<br>  <br>  btw it took me over 13 hours to finish it on veteran and can be really frustrating try and play some multiplayer in between

zgKda0Fhaa	Their is no competition here. Too Human was originally developed for the Gamecube but never got released, and it shows. The controls are quirky, the graphics awful and the gameplay is bland as hell. Oblivion is quite possibly one of the greatest games I have ever played. With fantastic character creation and a deep world you can literally be who you want and do as you want. The main campaign is quite short, but with a voice-over by the instantly recognisable Sean Bean and some great and entertaining sections it is good fun. The side-quests and exploration is what makes Oblivion epic in every sense, you can literally spend hundreds of hours trying to do everything, and that's without even touching on the expansions. <br>  <br>  Take my advice mate, Oblivion all the way, I never thought much of Too Human before playing, and when I played the demo it managed to even undermine that.|`|ap2QzoANaa	Honestly i'd pick oblivion. It's an awesome game (not necessarily an action title, but awesome), its got tons of play time and an interesting storyline backed up with good graphics.<br>  <br>  Too Human though, sort of is a flop. The controls are really difficult, and it has some bugs with the graphics. The lighting isn't done that well which gives the whole outlook sort of a grey/bland feel to it. The shooting in the game isn't effective at all, and sometimes i felt like i'd just rather run up and try to punch something to death rather than try and awkwardly aim this funky weapon at it. I put a link below so you can see for yourself.<br>  <br>  They're both two completely different types of games though. So if you're not into a sort of role playing game that's sort of slow at times... Maybe you should read a professional review of Too Human.|`|jJmSXUOwaa	I'll recommend you buy oblivion,i have play it until the end and am quite satisfied with it (though i played it in pc)<br>  Try reading the review about Too Human and oblivion in gamespot|`|0SYM7diNaa	Oblivion its amazing. Too human is more of the same old, nothing special, but thats my opinion.|`|gB5ATj7aaa	oblivion|`|9WTUjwUVaa	Oblivion is cheaper and is overall better gaming experience<br>  oblivion will give you more hours and actually lets you choose your angle nlike too human<br>  unfortunately too human didnt deliver after the hype it broke down the game was a big dissapointment not saying thaat its a bad game just games like oblivion and bioshock are better|`|2eGgbhVoaa	I reckon you should stuff the both of them and buy Fallout 3 instead.<br>  <br>  Like Oblivion, it's made by Bethesda, however it's a much more well rounded and entertaining gaming experience. The post-apocalyptic nuclear setting, excellent character design, and dark humour give the world so much more atmosphere than Oblivion could manage; while the combat and levelling systems are a vast improvement over the overcomplicated and slightly tedious offerings in Oblivion.<br>   <br>  I own and loved Oblivion but since buying Fallout have played it for all of three minutes before switching off and going back to the wasteland.<br>  <br>  I've never played Too Human, but I've never heard a single thing good said about it and can't really be bothered even to try it.<br>  <br>  Watch this: <br>  <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/420-Fallout-3" rel="nofollow">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/v...</a><br>  <br>  this:<br>  <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/213-Too-Human" rel="nofollow">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/v...</a><br>  <br>  and this:<br>  <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/75-Oblivion" rel="nofollow">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/v...</a><br>  <br>  then make up your own mind...|`|A5mgh8G2aa	both too human is ￡15-￡10 oblivion with shivering isles is like ￡20 that is still cheaper then the average game released in the past 5 months|`|3G7Lpah5aa	Too Human|`|qr16GzNnaa	Too human
wvaN6zPZaa	What you saw was NOT a download. That was simply a notification pop-up saying that the Mythic Map Pack was going to be released soon.<br>  <br>  You can get the Mythic Map Pack download code on March 3rd if you purchase the Halo Wars Limited Collector's Edition when it is released for the US. <br>  <br>  The Mythic Map Pack will be downloadable content for the public later on March 31st.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|9WTUjwUVaa	well the halo 3 screen just says halo war CE will get the maps earlier otherwise just go on recent download history|`|3G7Lpah5aa	you have to wait until March, 3 when the Halo Wars Limited Collector's Edition comes out. you will get 3 of them. the rest either come out soon after or when Halo: ODST comes out|`|KArAfyxYaa	It wasnt a download, it was a notification that the mythic map pack would be coming out soon|`|OtLLWJ9Raa	go to your xbox live dashboard.<br>  <br>  go to marketplace.<br>  <br>  Look around on there for halo 3 mythic map pack.|`|AOkcrpRraa	right now you need to either bea big time player or buy halo wars to get them

Then put it back together and turn it on, when it starts up it will come up with a DOS like screen that will load for a few seconds then come to a menu where you can link to your computer and install ANYTHING! Even Windows

Yeah and Don't challenge me cuz I am good enough to be in a montage (and I am in one).|`|NKWI02KTaa	Why boost in a game like that. At least play the game and get your rank up the right way.  If your a 50 and you suck its obvious you boosted. And you'll get crapped on online and made fun of.  If your boosting for achievements then thats a different story. (Example: The Darkness) No one plays that anymore so people boost the wins for the achievements.  Play the game and get good at it. Find a good band of friends that you can argue with but still play together because it will make you a better player.  Plus play a game that takes skill like COD4 :)<3
127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	You have to weigh them. Copper 3.11 grams, zinc 2.5 grams. A simple balance scale can be made using home items and test them all against a cent minted before 1982. if they balance it is copper.
NKWI02KTaa	Yes but it is stupid as you can't create a avatar because there is another update when you get NXE so you can create a avatar. And its not that great truthfully. Stick with the Blades. Easier to navigate in my eyes still.<br>  But if you really want it. Make sure you have a usb stick.  Google the NXE software update and download it to your computer. Un-RAR it which opens up the file. Put the update onto your usb drive. Then just stick the USB into your Xbox and it will prompt you to update your console. Ta daa. You now have NXE.

afJz77pjaa	Yes! The three points are in the Mediterranean, Amanda's boat, and in Thailand. You're lucky I'm in a helpful mood. I actually took some screen shots for you. Well, not that lucky...I didn't feel like hooking up my EasyCap, so you get digital camera shots of my HDTV. :)<br>  <br>  The first one is on the return trip back up to Lara's yacht. Instead of working your way to the exit, swan dive to the water below, where the octopus was. Choose where you dive carefully, because some parts are shallow. You can climb to the exit from there. <br>  Screenie:  <br>  <a href="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a330/niffer_marie/trscreens001.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a330/n...</a><br>  <br>  The second one is off of a life jacket box on Amanda's boat in the Mediterranean.

RADzvg6baa	It would take about 90k Maple Logs.  I don't know the current price for Maple Logs so find out and multiply that number by 90000 and thats how much money it will cost. :)
xDubataIaa	I would say yes, if you can can get the game for cheap. The map editor is powerful and you can make some pretty cool things. But no matter how cool your creations are, there is a chance you might not have anyone to try them out with. The online multiplayer community is very small, when compared to Gears 2 and Halo 3. Luckily for you, the majority of players online play custom games on custom maps. You are going to have to find players who play this game regularly and send them friend requests, because there are times when there only a few ranked matches going on.<br>  <br>  I rented the game through Gamefly for about 2 weeks back in November and I can only imagine the impact Gears 2 and CoD World at War have had on this games online community since then. I'm sure there are even fewer players now than there were then.|`|vUVxS9Xhaa	Well i guess if thats what you are interested in...but if you are hoping to have fun playing the campagin guess again.<br>  <br>  I found it to be so freaking boring, its the most repetitive game ever...if you like doing the same thing over and over again then buy it...if not then id suggest you find another game that has a map editor.

P4YKNZcMaa	Charging as you play later is fine but for the first charge it's good to let the battery sit until it is full.  If you do it'll last longer, hold a charge better and charge quicker.|`|yi8yqnQ5aa	Yes, you can charge it and play it at the same time.|`|HCbbncSkaa	You can play it while it's charging, and if it finishes charging while you are still playing, it will take power directly from the electrical  socket instead of taking power from the fully charged battery.|`|mQTUFWLeaa	Yes. You can play when the battery charges. I do it all the time.<br>  <br>  PS the battery charges when you play anyway. so even if you play while its charging and you take it off the charger itll be fully charged.|`|NZ6TMVGkaa	i know, that sucks, right!<br>  <br>  all it takes is an overnight charge, so if you can be patient for a night or so then you can play all the next day!|`|YJjUZU2jaa	That's no true you can play it while charging it for the first time.

sBdQoXSraa	um... hmm let me think. oh yeah, STREET FIGHTER 4!|`|jLe6GDu8aa	I suggest you check out this list if fighting games on Wikipedia:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fighting_games#Beat_.27em_ups" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fig...</a><br>  <br>  It has plenty of old school 2D arcade games you can get from the Xbox Live arcade as well as modern games. As far as games go without Xbox Live, for one, you're never forced to play a game online just because it supports online! On top of that, all 360 games support Xbox Live but not all of them have mutiplayer, so technically there is no 360 game without Xbox Live.<br>  The latest fighting games I can think of on 360 are the following:<br>  - Street Fighter 2<br>  - Mortal Kombat<br>  - Dead or Alive 4<br>  - Fight Night Round 4|`|CkFAWZMnaa	Yes. Soulcalibur is proplablly the best out there. umm... if you like rap there is def jam icon. some others just check the back of the boxes
c7f6a7fd0c7368115f0381d316f73c43aa	It sounds like you have Corprus Disease. It is the only "incurable" disease in the game but in fact has a cure. If you haven't gotten  to far into the main quest or the game then you should start over. But if you have gotten pretty far into the game then work on the main quest. It is the only way to get cured. Just go talk to Caius Cascades in Balmora and do the main quest. Eventually you'll get to a point where he will say that you have corprus disease and send you on the quest to go get cured. The quest sends you to Tel Fyre (southwest of Sadrith Mora) to the Corprusarium where you get cured. Idk if you can go there and get cured before the quest sends you there or not but it's worth a shot.<br>  <br>  It is most likely Corprus disease but if it isn't then it's either Blight or just a common disease. A common disease can be healed by any healer, alchemist potion, or Temple. Blight is easiest cured by the Temple.<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped!|`|Kqpqt69Vaa	by the sounds of it you were in a cave called ilunibi and just fought dagoth gares.if so you have corprus disease and you need to find divath fyr who lives on an island that you need to swim to or water walk.first go see casius cosades and this is what he will tell you.when finding the island go to sadrith mora and then head south west and look for a wizards tower.while your there you can also rescue the girl on the bottom level behind a locked door,bring her ring to her father in milk cave.also when you get to the top of the tower make sure you can open a lock of 100 because you will find the cuirass of the saviors hide,well worth stealing.also in the room that divayth fyr is standing in are a couple of chests,you can unlock them in front of him and take whats there.hope this helps,great game.|`|C3C6gsGvaa	1. Find out the name of this disease<br>  2. Then go to google and type in "Elder Scrolls Wiki", one of the first few links should be a wiki site focused on the Elder Scrolls games (Morrowind, Oblivion etc.)<br>  3. On that Wiki search for the name of that diease and you should get a the page on it. If you cannot find out the disease name, lookup dagithur then and you should be able to go from there.<br>  <br>  Also I recomend this wiki because it should be able to help you with any other problems in Morrowind in the future. Goodluck!|`|Lb0sZmYgaa	i say u shud start over haha

The BEST way to see if the price is raising or lowering is to go to World 2 (west side of ge) and see if theres people selling Bandos Godswords. Or just keep check on the price daily.

8t5vPDnqaa	Make sure you know the official rules of all the games.  Nothing worse than going to one of these things and the rules are being made up as they go along.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Make sure you get roulette and that silly money wheel for an office party.  Not a lot of thought, just place your bets and watch the spin.|`|F4gVAPlGaa	First off, if you promote this at all, please spell "Monte Carlo" correctly.  Try to get a hold of a inexpensive roulette set as well.  The "money wheel" is also a good idea.  Craps is also an option, but the rules are pretty complicated, so it may not be worth the effort.  I would also consider maybe running another relatively simple casino games like "casino war" or "3 card poker".  As another has said, make sure people running the games know all of the rules.  As a knowledgeable gambler, I would get annoyed real fast otherwise.

Then one summer at Coney Island, I went on the Cyclone, which seemed like the most unstable ride in the world, and I loved it. Now I can't get enough of rollercoasters. <br>        You can try gradually getting to more extreme rides or you can just jump on one.Or maybe you can just stay away from rides all together if you feel that way.|`|DGINTA4Saa	What i would do is try going on non-scary rides (kiddy rides). Then move up a lvl and go on some kinda scary rides (mt. everest). Then move up again to Scary rides (dueling dragons).

THb23TByaa	You can try a BigCity deck. I know, it's old school but it's still a great deck, especially since E-Hero Heat is released. You can also try Dark Gaia OTK. Don't play too much highstake monsters like Raviel but only Evil Hero Malicious edge and 1 Gorz. I was competing in a tournament a couple of weeks ago with the Gaia deck and I ended 2nd. But it's you're choice: Huge ATK or endless swarming. Remember, these aren't the toptier decks they play now but you can give it a shot. These decks are budget deck so you'll only need like 50 bucks to get the whole deck, the only expencive card you need is Solemn Judgment x2. I hope I helped you out a bit.|`|wTwC5ZAwaa	you could use antimeta deck it's kind of cheap and kills the metagame a lot.the only hard cards to get are thinder king rai-oh,solemn judgment,and others.3 solemns and 3 thunder king won't be easy to get it's about around $180:00 i'm not sure or you could look it up on youtube|`|PGvjEvjMaa	Try batteryman otk or control almost all cards are cheap except honest and guardian of order. i dont give decklists because then you can just netdeck it and that doesnt help you as a creative deckbuilder or dueler|`|clAnRWIMaa	The fact of the matter is there is none. People are cheap cheating little twats, and always will go for the cards with the most powerful effects.  What this means is nobody has original decks anymore.  Everything on your NOT list are the kinds of decks people use...If you want to keep it under $200, get a DS and get world championship.  There is a new world champ yu gi oh game comin out, Stardust Accelerator.  It has a story mode again, which they brought back in 2008, but it's basically just the Duel monsters game.  You can get lots of cards, and duel online any day, anytime.  The bad news is that anything on the official ban list, you won't be able to get without cheating yourself and getting a gameshark/action replay to put the card you want in your deck.  Also, everyone online is a cheater/whiny little twat so they'll have forbidden cards in their decks or cards like Dark Gaia. Few people still have the honor of dueling with an original deck while playing by the rules.|`|jTLxF4ZNaa	<a href="http://www.janime.info/Genex/cards_saiou.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.janime.info/Genex/cards_saiou...</a><br>  <br>  All the Arcanas have been release|`|SXAMtwqBaa	Dude, it's probably going to cost you more than $200 to get the cards for those decks.

uctxzjIIaa	There are a total of 5 Final Fantasy movies/animated serieses.<br>  <br>  The oldest is Final Fantasy: Legend of the Crystals, an anime series. This thing is old enough it was released on VHS, not DVD. I've never seen it, but I hear it was loosely based on Final Fantasy 5.<br>  <br>  Next came Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. This was the CGI movie made for Hollywood that practically bankrupted Square. It features many themes that were common in the early Final Fantasy games, and character designs clearly based on FF7 and FF8.<br>  <br>  I think the next one was Final Fantasy Unlimited, another anime series. Never got good reviews.<br>  <br>  Then was Final Fantasy 7: Advent Children. This is a CGI movie, and the first one to really tie in with any of the games. It is a sequel to the PS1 game FF7.<br>  <br>  Finally is Final Fantasy 7: Last Order. This is a 20-minute or so anime OVA movie. It retells the events of the "Nibelhiem Incident" that was featured in flashbacks in the original Final Fantasy 7 and as a main plot point in Crisis Core: Final Fantasy 7 (though all three tell slightly different versions of the story, as they are from the perspectives of different characters who were not in the smae locations most of the time).|`|RehgySLCaa	It doesn't matter which order you watch because they are not related to each other

PKULDaC7aa	You just have to keep playing. Make sure you're working on your hammer-ons and pull-offs as well because unless you perfect those you will never succeed at expert. Some people like to use practice mode but I always just played the game until I could play all the songs.|`|sBdQoXSraa	practice|`|SApZ3x5waa	The best way is to go into practise mode and slow it down. Get it perfect on a slow mode, then speed it up again. If you're still having difficulty, repeat above method on the next lower difficulty(hard) and then try expert again. Also, if its the rhythm you're struggling with, download the song and listen to it until you're familiar with the rhythm and progression of the song. Then you should be able to beat it.|`|3dOqAw8Saa	A good way is  do ridiculously hard songs over and over again. You'll see yourself get better as you take on one expert song at a time.|`|66AZhLnEaa	Practice on easier songs, then once you master those, go to the next level, and so on|`|uNc6C27Yaa	practice on easier songs and then go up and u can put wieghts on ur fingers to make them faster

This is contrary to consoles which, nowadays, have hard drives built into them making them SEEMINGLY have "unlimited memory" because their hard drives are so large in capacity. This system of inserted memory cards that the PSP uses makes it so that if you wish to have more memory all you need to do is buy a Memory Stick Duo with more memory (larger number of MB or GB {1 GB is 1000MB}). The bottom line is that an unlimited amount of memory can NEVER exist in the PSP or in any form at all. Everything has it's limit, the only difference is how much space the is between the beginning and it's limit.|`|OdUt8KDqaa	i dont think there is your psp will only hold so much memory its like and hard drive as such i dont think it can keep addin more|`|jgOdSsM1aa	if you can get unlimited memory, don't you think they would use that?

Also, GH Metallica comes with an extra drum pedal for the double bass.|`|4e44wRBWaa	No it will not. They are from two different company's. The best bet, if you already have Rockband, is tell a friend to get GHWT. Or visa versa.|`|CkFAWZMnaa	most likely. ask a retailer first|`|uNc6C27Yaa	i dont think so because they dont work on gh world tour so probally not|`|f7LAACXYaa	Yes they will... don't listen to these other people. RB2 drums I know for sure will work with it. Not sure about RB1. They're saying how would RB drums work with a Guitar Hero game such as GH:WT. But they definitely do. Look it up on YouTube. They just take away one drum on the screen. Pretty nifty huh? So in conclusion RB2 drums WILL work with Guitar Hero: Metallica. RB1 drums, that might be a different story.

XrGFZ2LJaa	You CANNOT install Empire: Total War without an internet connection. You must also have a PC with the minimum system requirements. <br>  <br>  During installation, you need to type in a unique 'key code' and have it activated through Steam. Other essential install files are downloaded from Steam for Empire: Total War. Lastly, you have to go through an "update" process, which only Steam provides.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'm not sure, but I don't think you can return it. Because Empire: Total War has been activated on your Steam account, it's permanetely attributed to it..That means it's a useless copy...only YOU can use it...That's why steam sucks.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Want any more help or clarification?

When that battery dies, the data is no longer there. And so you must start your game over, and you can no longer save.<br>  <br>  So the deal is, you need to buy a new cartridge. Try getting a used one online or from a friend cheap, or possibly free, depending on who you know.<br>  <br>  And though you don't want to hear it, you must simply put it in the past. I seriously doubt you'll find a way to fix it. I don't know anyone who has, and tons of people have that problem including neighbors, friends, and myself.<br>  <br>  I've seen it happen to Red Versions, Silver and Gold Versions, and even a Ruby Version. It is just horrible.<br>  <br>  But look at the bright side, when you buy or recieve a new Emerald version, even though you may not be able to save, you should still try to trade Pokemon from that game. If it works, you'll be able to get as many of each starter Pokemon as you want!<br>  <br>  Haha. I can't believe I haven't tried it yet. I'm going to do that today with my defective Ruby Version.<br>  <br>  <br>  Haha. Thank YOU for reminding me!

j6MvCr6Naa	Graphics:<br>  The graphics are good enough, but nothing special, they look a little dated in my opinion. The game can be quite beautiful at times though, the trees and vegetation are lush and bright and the game has this certain style that's quite appealing. But overall, they could have been a lot more detailed and textures look horrible in places.<br>  <br>  Gameplay:<br>  The gameplay can be very satisfying, this game isdifferent to most war games in this regard. You have different squads to control, you use them to ambush, outflank, supress and generally destroy your enemy. If used in smart way your squad is your best weapon, this adds a lot of complexity to the game. There is also an awesome gore system: whenever you make a perfect head shot, the camera will zoom in on the enemy and show you his head blow up into a million tiny pieces in slow-motion and that never gets old. Same thing goes for grenades, blow somebody up and the camera will zoom in on them and show you guts, blood, bones, limbs and everything in between flying around everywhere in slow-motion, very satisfying.<br>  <br>  Difficulty:<br>  It really depends on what kind of player you are, if you're going to start playing this game like it's Halo and go in guns blazing ignoring your squad and not using cover, you're going to get massaccared. However, if you use your head, use the environment to your advantage as well as your squad this game will feel just right.<br>  <br>  Here's the average score from reviews for Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/brothersinarmshellshighway?q=brothers%20in%20arms:%20hell's%20highway" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 76% meaning it's a pretty good game, but nothing special really, it's not going to surprise you or blow you away.<br>  <br>  If you really want a good WWII tactical squad-based FPS this is definitely the way to go, it's just that this game is too much like it's predecessors and feels a little dated by today's standards.|`|1WgOj89kaa	It is not the best war game. The graphics are stuck in the past. and the gameplay is very annoying. The only good thing is it is very cheap for a PS3 Game.|`|NqiLnwxyaa	graphics rubbish, game play poor!

xDubataIaa	Bungie has always said Halo would be a trilogy but we can dream can't we? I think a prequel would be the way to go. Dip into the past to move the franchise forward. Explore the Master Chief's past. Fight alongside fellow Spartans like he does in the novels. Experience some of the epic battles we have only read about. It would be awesome. No Flood or Brutes to show up and ruin the fun either. Just good ol' Elites, Grunts, Jackals and Hunters to do battle with. <br>  <br>  They could even add in some Ghost Recon-like squad based commands to tell your fellow Spartans what to do. Like telling your sniper to post up and give you cover and such. I mean, they do use tactics in the novels so it would make sense to act like a team. Keep the squad-based stuff to a minimum though to keep the game true to its roots with fast paced run-n-gun action. <br>  <br>  As far as a Halo CE remake? I think it is a little to early for that. It has only been one console generation since it came out. However, I would love to see it re-released with online multiplayer and co-op campaign.|`|X92FdfPeaa	Nah, Bungie "broke up" with microsoft a while ago, the only halo like game that is coming out is Halo Recon which is an expansion pack but doesnt include master chief.|`|xVTYpPcUaa	They aren't making Halo 4 thats why Halo 3 is called the stunning conclusion to the Halo series.  Halo Wars isn't made by bungie and its before master chief and Halo ODST is set during Halo 2.|`|BXOOnxXgaa	it would be ok.  I mean Halo:ODST is sorta like Halo 4 but with no MC.  It woulds be cool though
2Q2ltt1Saa	Most Intel graphics sets do not have T&L hardware included, used in a majority of today's games.  It won't "break" anything; it simply won't be able to process the spcific instructions and may make the game unplayable because you can't see everything.
a4f8d5e7eb7d39bff1562dc15d37ab53aa	No , some Pokemon you cannot get legally on Pokemon Diamond without trading/hacking. For instance , if you choose Piplup as your starter , it will be nearly impossible to get Turtwig or Chimchar. Also if yo u choose Pokemon Pearl you cannot get Dialga or Viceversa. You cannot get certain fossils in Pokemon Pearl (For Shieldon , ecetera) so the answer is:<br>  <br>  No.|`|5VvEm3hkaa	no it dosen its like ruby and sapphire u need 2 trade between diamond and pearl and also platinum 2 get em all or get pokemon platinum which is a combination of diamond and pearl...in fact u need all 3 to hav a full pokedex|`|SApZ3x5waa	No, there are many you cannot get in one, that are only found in the other.

uctxzjIIaa	It's about 40 hours to do just the main story.<br>  <br>  Add another 40 or so on top of that to get the optional summons, catpure 10 of every creature for the Monster Arena, and aquire and upgrade all the Celestial Weapons.<br>  <br>  Add about 30 hours on top of that to redesign and walk the Sphere grid in order to max your characters stats.<br>  <br>  Add about 10 hours on top of that to teach all the abilities to all of your summons.<br>  <br>  Add about 20 hours on top of that to make the best possible armors and weapons in the game.<br>  <br>  And add about 50 hours on top of that to max out the stats of all the summons.|`|7SIgFY1Faa	I racked up about 80+ hours as I was trying to get everything (which I failed miserably) and I was distracted by the blitzball which is a cool sports mini game.<br>  <br>  I thought ffX was probably the best (or joint with ffVII), gameplay was great, story was epic (even if it was a bit weird) and even the music was great (Road to Zanarkand).<br>  <br>  If you don't have it it is a must buy ....I wish I still had it :(|`|dg2ktkCOaa	Well that depends on how much you want to do. It would have minimum of 40 hours if you just handle the main quest and few secrets along the way. But, if you're like me and want to do everything possible, it'll easily last beyond +100 hours. It's been ages since I played it but even with the guide from "Piggyback" I logged +160 hours into that game. Levelling, the monster farm and hidden bosses take up about 60% of the time. Blitzball (I think that's what it was called) was also cool, could have made a sports game solely on that as well. Granted it's very linear for most of the beginning of the game but when you get to that stage when open exploration is possible, then it shows its true colours.|`|kUtvRGMPaa	OMG final fantasy 10.....my best game......ill have a look when i get home (lol its been in my ps2 since i got my ps3 wen it first came out)<br>  but as i remember...i clockd 40 hours, might be less time cause the boss's aint that hard.........not as hard as 8 anyway......fk those end bosses wer hard........looking forward to the next ones...they look insaign

First of all, both are reasonably priced and offer a great catalogue of exclusive games. Highlights are Halo 3 and Mass Effect, for 360, and Metroid Prime 3, Smash Bros, and the upcoming Mad World for Wii. Second, both offer good to great graphics for the technology. The Wii has no HD capability, so many designers have taken the time to include spectacular lighting and detail effects in the games. I've seen many Wii games that look better than PS3 games. 360 of course, has full HD output, free with the Elite bundle. And finally, it comes down to the sort of games you want to play. The Wii is getting lots of support from casual game companies, and is developing a reputation as a casual console, but it has a bevy of hardcore game coming up, like the Conduit, the House of the Dead, and the Dead Rising, Dead Space ports. The 360 has a solid catalogue of established hardcore franchises, but not a lot of groundbreaking new material is coming out.

AwT0VRz2aa	Yeh, a bit.
Fd9VbnN2aa	This will be a very long read, so prepare yourself!!!(actually,you can just go to my source and save time;-)<br>  <br>  DESCRIPTION<br>  Super mutants or meta-humans are mutated humans, products of the Forced Evolutionary Virus, or F.E.V.. They are much taller and bulkier than humans, have (mostly) green, gray, or yellowish skin, are immune to disease and radiation, and are gifted with superhuman strength and endurance. Although they are completely sterile, constant regeneration of their cells caused by FEV makes them biologically immortal (but not impossible to kill, of course). <br>  <br>  BIOLOGY<br>  Average super mutants stand approximately 10.5 feet (3.2 meters) tall (although they typically stand with hunched backs that reduce them to about 8 feet) and weigh around 800 pounds (360 kg), possibly even more. Their skin color is predominately gray with tints of green, although some mutants with other skin colors also exist. Their skin is extremely tough, and their muscle and bone structure is enhanced.<br>  <br>  Super mutant cells undergo cellular division at an increased rate. Mitosis occurs at a rate 15% quicker than that of normal humans. Cellular structure is said to be highly similar to normal humans. DNA strands are very complete, with all recessive genes for ailments eradicated from the system. The recessive genes which are commonly found in humans have been manipulated in such a way as to bring about the best possible combination. The RNA were also manipulated to allow for a greater transmission of signals.<br>  <br>  The mutation has some severe side effects. Chief among them is sterility. As the gametes of the reproductive system consist of 'half-cells' using split DNA, they are perceived as 'damage' by FEV, which repairs them, rendering the mutants sterile. Super mutants are unable to reproduce with any creature, whether clean or mutated. Other side effects include an alteration of pigment of the epidermis. While the super mutants originating from Mariposa are sterile, they do not lose their sexual organs. In contrast, the Vault 87 strain of FEV causes the subjects to lose most of their visible sexual identifiers.<br>  <br>  While they don't die of old age, they do get senile with age, which also makes them more prone to being killed. <br>  <br>  HISTORY<br>  <br>  There are two different known sources of super mutants - Mariposa Military Base on the West Coast and Vault 87 on the East Coast. The two populations have separate histories, and there are no known accounts of any interaction between them.for this reason i will only type the history of the east coast mutants.<br>  <br>  These Super Mutants were created in the Evolutionary Experimentation Program, the experiment assigned to Vault 87. The modified strain of FEV which created these mutants resulted in a new strain of Super Mutants which, in addition to becoming senile, grow larger and stronger as they age. They are different as they are green-yellow in skin color and less intelligent. They take prisoners to transform them into more Super Mutants.<br>  <br>  During exploration of Vault 87, information from a terminal reveals more about the process of mutation that Super Mutants go through, at least when it comes to the specific strain of FEV found in the Super Mutants of the Capital Wasteland. As a human mutates, its muscular and skeletal systems develop rapidly, while their mental faculties diminish. Most sexual characteristics are eliminated, transforming the subject into an almost asexual state.<br>  <br>  It is not known why Vault-Tec had access to information regarding the FEV virus when its development, construction, and control were the responsibilities of West-Tec Industries. It might be that it was a joint operation between Vault-Tec and West-Tec for the Vault experiment.<br>  <br>  Despite their supposed lack of intelligence, even compared to West Coast mutants, they are somehow able to organize themselves into a coordinated army (as evidenced by numerous raids and the attempt to reinforce their positions at the Capitol which led to the attack on GNR), procure large amounts of advanced weapons, ammo, and equipment, and even maintain the FEV infrastructure necessary to transform humans and increase their numbers. How they are able to pull this off is never explained as the player never meets a leader or governing body in the game. But it is possible they are controlled by one of the more intelligent mutants from the West Coast. Another possibility is that some of the violent mutants have retained their intelligence just like Fawkes and Uncle Leo, but that unlike these two they either lost their sense of morality or they may have been evil humans before being changed (i.e. they did not have any morals).<br>  <br>  It is unexplained why the super mutants are present in D.C., but it is often hinted they are looking for something. One answer could be F.E.V and Humans to expand their army, hinted at by the following quote from a Super Mutant soldier - "Have you found... green stuff? I haven't... maybe we are wasting our time. We could be out killing!" (or something to that effect)<br>  <br>  It is not known why the Super Mutants have occupied the D.C. Ruins, nor why the Talon Company fight them to inside of the Capitol Building and in the Mall area among other places. It has been alluded that the Super Mutants are searching for something inside the D.C. Ruins, but as to what, it is not known but may be found out in the new DLC Broken Steel. Sometimes, it is fun to listen in on their conversations with each other. A few of their quotes from Fallout 3 include: "I was thinking... AND IT HURT! Hurt my head! But I remembered things... from before... I think I knew a woman. Or maybe, I WAS a woman... Aggh! It hurts!"<br>  <br>  There is a single Super Mutant occasionally found roaming the border of the Scrapyard named Uncle Leo (Random encounter). He is, unlike the other D.C. Super Mutants, docile. He does not know what the FEV infrastructure actually is, he just calls it the "dark-metal place", and says that his brothers take people there to make more of their kind, endlessly. He protested against this and was driven out by his brothers to fend for himself. The peculiar thing is that he makes no hint, or mention of any kind about any one Super Mutant being in charge, he only says his brothers, alluding they're a collective and he's the black sheep.<br>  <br>  Another unique thing about The Capital Wasteland Super Mutants is that Giant Ants are not hostile towards Super Mutants and vice-versa.<br>  <br>  Super Mutants may be accompanied by Centaurs who act as watchdogs.|`|UtvEsQX8aa	They are looking for FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) to further their kind.

47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	first of all, DO NOT CLICK ANY LINKS given to you in here from people with random names linking to blog spots.  they are spammers and yahoo has been trying to get rid of them for months<br>  <br>  as for your actual question, you just have to think of the type of guild you want.  start by getting your guild charter signed by friends you know on your server, and who want the same type of guild as you.<br>  <br>   when you do an add in trade, inform them of what types of players your looking for (laid back, mature, what level range, what classes, etc) but DO NOT use caps lock. there is nothing more annoying than people who clog up trade with giant adds all in capital letters.  consider investing in more bank tabs, and a cool talbard.<br>  <br>    pick players who are helpful, and polite. high level people who are willing to run low levels through stuff, or at least offer helpful advice are ALWAYS an asset to a good guild.  make sure you all do your very best to learn your classes well, and be knowlegeable about good gear and where to find it. (atlas loot is great for this)<br>  <br>    if you DO invest in more bank tabs for a guild bank, make sure you put it so only certain people can get stuff out.  this way you avoid any low levels who want to get in your guild to ninja loot.<br>  <br>    pick a cool name.  seriously, that sounds so trivial, but people like cool stuff under their actual name.<br>  <br>    follow through on stuff.  if you set a guild event on the calender, make sure it happens.  if you promise your going to do naxx every friday at 7:30 server time, then it never happens, people will get pissed and leave.<br>  <br>    try to pick players that have a variety of professions.  every guild should have at least one member who has their professions maxed.  so you should have at least one high level herbilist, alchemist, tailor, enchanter, inscription person, and so on.  that way if people need something,  they can go to the guild members first.<br>  <br>    do fun stuff too.  try to break away from just doing raids, or just doing pvp.  one of my guilds had a bi monthly lottery drawing.  it was 1gold per ticket, you got your numbers in the mail, and the prize was whatever money got put in by people buying tickets.  people loved it! stuff like that always gets people interested, because its a break from the norm.|`|XnIdLz9xaa	If youw ant to make a serious raiding guild start with a core of your friends, then slowly invite other people you think are good and that want to join. Don't just invite randoms to get the numbers up... quality over quantity. Eventually you will become reputable and people will WANT to join, and you'll get good. Also, you need a vent server.

tX71oIplaa	When you beat the game in golden sun.<br>  In the starting menu screen there is a transfer icon. When you press it you will get a series of codes a bronze level which transfer only ur djinni. Silver which transfers character stats and dijinni and a gold one which transfers everything including items. Another way is the link cable which you just link both games with to gameboy advances and there ya go transfer complete. I offer an opinion if u don't have a link cable. I suggest you go with the silver code. The gold code takes a very long time to put in and is prone to mistakes plus, the weapons in godlen sun 2 are much better then the strongest weapons in golden sun. Good luck.

In-fact the only time you will probably get the RRoD is if you keep it in a dusty room, in about a year or 2 it will slow down the fan and it will get the RRoD for overheating. So don't worry at all about it, it will probably never happen to you.|`|BXOOnxXgaa	First one was after two months<br>  Second one was about year and a half but it is now fixed|`|613d5971b99debfdbfc4fe45b9e6f875aa	haven't got nethir yet|`|V1eEYWASaa	My friend just sent his in to get a new one. <br>  <br>  When Microsoft sent him his next one (or refurbished one, not sure which), Red Ring killed it in a month. <br>  <br>  Many people may not know, but the I believe the cause Red Ring is actually due to an overheated wire that when brought to a high temperature, breaks. <br>  <br>  There are actually ways you can repair your Xbox 360 temporarily by throwing towels over it, and leaving it on for a while (thus welding the wire back together). This may void your warranty, though.|`|RjGtp41Zaa	If u are asking cuz u baught a new system, don't worry. The newer models don't have that problem. My Xbox took a 5 months to get the RRoD|`|pLirJP9Taa	It depends on how often you play it and how well you have it set up so it doesn't overheat. I've had people that have it anywhere from 3 months to 1 year before it does that.

The fist card to be put onto the table is called the flop. The hands are just like in poker. You bet accordingly to what is in your hands. I usually will only stay in if I have a pair or possible straight. when the flop card is put down then you decide if you wanna stay in. Good luck and remember that the other people have the same cards on the tables so try to anticipate what they can be holding in their hands a lot of bluffers out there.

Check all the wiring on the back of the Xbox 360 and make sure they are all plugged in properly. Now you can contact Microsoft's Xbox hotline and get a repair order. This will charge you nothing if your still under warranty.

Then just ship it to them and you will receive it back shortly with a free month of Xbox Live Gold.|`|lLLsX3Efaa	I'd go for unplugging it and leaving it there for an hour or two (pull out the hard drive too). If that fails to work then contact Microsoft and (assuming your still under warranty) they will send you a box, you ship your system to them (free of charge) and they send it back to you fixed or they might just send a new one (in any case your told to keep your hard drive so no memory ends up being lost). Best part is, they send you a 1 month subscription to Xbox LIVE free for your troubles. Awesome. The downside? your gonna be without an xbox for about a month. suggestion? go to Game Stop one day, a friend's house the other day, repeat. Or if you devious like me, buy a new arcade system (make sure you have a warranty for 30 days to return it) plug in your hard drive, play away and when the system is returned (or your warranty is about to expire) return the system (and if necessary buy another one). Cheers mate, hope this helps.

GH also teams up with great bands to add more songs with (Aerosmith and soon Metallica) RB choose ACDC which isn't bad, but has nothin on Metallica.

UUC2KO3Daa	"..Unimproved properties, railroads and utilities (but not buildings) may be sold to any player as a private transaction for any amount the owner can get...."<br>  <br>  It appears that the rules do not say *when*. It appears that the owner can sell undeveloped property (not house and such) to anybody, anytime. As the rules state... it is a private transaction.<br>  <br>  If I can sell anytime to anybody, then a good time for me would be when I *need* the money.  And since the rules do not restrict me to who I can sell to, then a good person to sell to would be somebody I'm owe.<br>  <br>  The rules lead me to believe, to be on the safe side (as far as following the rules are concerned), the entire transaction (including sells and money) should equal the amount owed.  In other words I shouldn't be able to just give you a railroad for rent of $1000, just because you like me.

It's great if someone lands on you that can't pay and they have something you want!|`|oLQ3me02aa	what youre really supposed to do is have the person mortgage/ sell their property to the bank to get the money to pay you, but play it however you want!|`|zdSRsySNaa	Yes you can accept any payment you like (within the game that is, unless you're playing strip monopoly or somethinig). The debtor is also allowed to sell property to another player in order to generate cash to give you. If the player offers you the cash value of the rent you have to accept it. If it's property then it's up to you whether or not to accept it. You are also allowed to make suggestions of which property you will accept to the player - but if they come up with the cash then you have to accept that.<br>  <br>  Just to clarify - it's the equivalent of them selling property to you, for a price you agree and then giving you that cash back as payment for the rent, so while the rules don't officially allow you to take property instead of cash, they do allow the player who owes you money to sell their property to the bank or to another player, including you in order to find the money.|`|QxwzxjJTaa	if they are bankrupt or something|`|SmOefD5Raa	Yes, but houses and hotels must be sold (at half price) back to the bank first.

CNKBGVgQaa	I was also going to trade in my DS lite for the DSi, but have had second thoughts. I still have my SP to play all my GBA games, except for my like $75 worth of the Guitar Hero: On Tour Games. If you dont have guitar hero or many GBA games or have an SP, i would defidently trade your old DS in. The video of the DSi is amazing lol So I think you should get it regardless if you turn in your old one or not. I would also get black because it will match all accesories you might get for it and will hide any marks you might get on it! :]|`|0xMUStgiaa	How about you don't get one at all? The DSi sucks. Have fun with no GBA port.|`|HsZVvmWqaa	It depends on whether you would like to be able to use the game boy advance slot and also if you have a game boy advance. <br>  <br>  Some games do use the gba and DS games in conjunction with each other. However if your not bothered about that and DO have a gba, I would suggest selling your DS and getting the DSi. If you dont have a gba and you do want to use the gba + ds option, save up for the DSi and keep your DS<br>  <br>  Also, both colours are good, just dont get a white one. They show the dirt so easily.|`|9831f26e57b258c37ba1bda60cf4d8a7aa	basicly its the same exact thing with more things like a camera and stuff u should sell it  and id prefer black because it goes good with almost anything|`|VooQlYt3aa	Get the blue one.

(if it's not, it should be some other folder where that UFO extrawhatever)) then find a Run program (in the start menu) and go to the C:\Program Files\(a folder where the game is saved)\ProjectX.exe and open it. and you know what, it's incomplete instruction here i think. just try going to <a href="http://www.gamewinners.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamewinners.com</a> and search for your games|`|613d5971b99debfdbfc4fe45b9e6f875aa	don't use cheats it might mess ur hole game up

If you really do not like it, report the person and move on. But don't sink to their level. They ruin the game for everyone else.
zoD71BuKaa	I'm having the same problem... It gives me this message:<br>  <br>  ***Chat is only allowed for our most trusted players. As you continue to play on Yahoo!, you will be granted access to send messages to the lobbies and tables.

I recently created a new Yahoo! account, because my old one was getting around 400 spam messages a day... And with the creation of this new one, I am locked out of chatting. Not that I chat alot, but it's nice to be able to say good morning, can you click start, etc...<br>  <br>  I'm looking into it...

2RefT1hBaa	I think it has to do with the current bickering of Upper Deck and Konami for control over yugioh.|`|1VtYZq5Caa	The reason why US tournaments like Jumps have been Cancelled is because of the batlle between UDE and Konami.<br>  The battle is over now but Tournaments may have been just postponed to a delayed date.

I think the game is dying for us here in America.|`|QzD3rJtMaa	Well there has been breaking news on UDE.com.  I just got done reading it that the Courts have ruled against UDE and have forced them to permanently discontinue their support for the Yugioh game.  All tournaments that were temporarily put on hold have just been completely cancelled altogether.  As of right now the game is officially dead and there will not be any new product.  The only way the game can come back now is if Konami and UDE can come to some sort of agreement which I don't see happening because apparently Konami has no regard for their customers and the people who keep them in business.  This means that there will be no more new packs and no more tournaments and that this weeks Sneak Preview is more likely then not cancelled as well.  I hate it as much as everybody else, but there is nothing anybody can do.  It's all up to Konami now and even if Konami brings it back it just won't be the same and most of the people who once played won't bother with it.|`|MfDRFP7faa	i think yugioh is having its slow slow painful death in the us<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  8[

OZ0DgzrJaa	The most important thing to remember is to equip everybody.  If anyone in your party dies for too long they are replaced by a the next character in your character list.  <br>  <br>  Since I played 90% of the game with only my three active characters loaded with spells, this could be a problem.<br>  <br>  As far as what to equip, just give it your best.  There isn't any particular super weapon that makes this battle a cake walk, and most GF's will be killed by the boss before you can summon them.  Don't forget that the boss herself carries a spell you can steal!|`|9BIZ7eFMaa	GF's will be killed as soon as you select them so there's no point in using them.<br>  <br>  Go to the Ragnarok and the CC Card group is there. Play them until you get the Laguna card. Using Quetzacotl's card mod ability, refine Laguna's card into 100 hero's. Hero's make a party member temporarily invincible. They're by far the best chance to beat Ultimecia.<br>  <br>  You could also get Gilgamesh's card and refine that into 10 Holy Wars. They work the same as hero's but it makes all party members invincible.|`|RJXDMFKyaa	Theres nothing to make this fight really easy but I recommend that you have all of your weapons fully upgraded and that every character has magic junctioned to health, attack, magic, etc
