Im 16, and my dad said that he would buy me a bong for my b-day, but he doesnt want to because he thinks that they wont sell it to him if I am right there next to him. Obviously we are gonna act like he's buying it for himself, and not me, but could I actually be inside the smokeshop with him while he buys it? Mostly just because I would like to pick it out. And I am currently in Arizona. Thanks.
