PfxqdgZLaa	Psychologists have something to say about this.<br>  <br>  IF you start using the same numbers for a few games in a row, continue to use those numbers.  There have been multiple instances of people switching from their usual numbers and then committing suicide when their numbers come up and they miss out on millions.<br>  <br>  If you have regular numbers and ever just take a break from playing, don't even look at what numbers come up when you're not playing.  It would SUCK to find out your numbers came up the week when you didn't have a chance to stop in at the local Quickie Mart to buy a ticket.  Better to not even know.<br>  <br>  As for WHAT numbers to play...<br>  Assuming the drawing is 100% fair, there are no numbers that are more likely to come up than any others.  1,2,3,4,5,6 is exactly as likely to come up as 7,9,12,19,32,37.  <br>  <br>  So there is no way to increase your probability of winning.  HOWEVER, if you do win you would want to share your jackpot with as few people as possible.  To do this, try to pick numbers that nobody plays.  For instance, a lot of people use birthdays of friends and family to pick numbers.  This means that number 1-31 and especially 1-12 are used A LOT.  To counteract this, choose at least two or three numbers over 31.  <br>  <br>  Again, this doesn't make a win any more or less likely.  It just means that you're more likely to be a solo winner if you ever do win.|`|TQyaBoo8aa	it can be the same or different.|`|774c0eb5f31b806e89824993621a7184aa	lucky dip|`|fox5a3ePaa	keep the same|`|ch8DC4z7aa	keep my ones thesame then do 1 lucky dip|`|KCtdICMTaa	[ always use the same ones....<^><..|`|FTs2py0kaa	quick picks on the mega,,,,and same ones on the lottery(i get the year on line.......)

OoT is the best in the series because of the mix of its gameplay, plot and the difficulty of the game. Sorry guys, there was nothing difficult in beating TP. I would even go as far as to put A Link To The Past ahead of TP. Anyway, my vote is for OoT.|`|SjGpbohiaa	The Twilight Princess|`|GV4ipAp8aa	hahahahaha<br>  legend of the windwaker for gamecube.<br>  its my favourite gaame :)|`|zJZy2b7gaa	I know it'll sound cliche, but i think Twilight Princess is the best.

Just get a 3000, they have a built-in mic for Skype and are the same price as 2000.|`|734vKCXOaa	Those are just the different versions of the PSP the basically the only difference is that the more you go up the newer the version of the PSP is.

I know they're heavy and makes you go slow, but once you lying prone and you see tons of enemies coming, prepare for some killing sprees!|`|zJZy2b7gaa	Well, you could try using a double barrel or trench gun.

And if all else fails, theres always your knife.|`|SaG6rxj0aa	If you get super desperate, take off the telescopic scope and use the other scope because the telescopic scope downgrades your accuracy.

8UlMTI1Faa	If you take a look into the "pilot records" section below campaign and versus on the main menu, and click RB, it will show you what challenges you have completed and which ones you have not. This will give you a guide to what to try to achieve in the single mission section.<br>  <br>  Once all the single mission objectives have been done, you can attempt the versus multiplayer objectives, either by LAN or Online. These alone should bring you up to LVL 40 before they are all completed. <br>  <br>  If you do not have online and have completed all of the offline pilot records objectives, the mission "red eagle" combined with the Rafale C (AAspect missiles) on easy (for a high missile count) is the fastest way to gain XP

mEpj0k5raa	Well, recently, video games have been gaining momentum in being known as a sport.  Organizations like MLG (Major League Gaming) have stepped up to create competitions for games like Halo 3 that involve teams and money, just like physical sports.  Your boyfriend probably sees Halo as a sport because it is so competitive and team based, just like a sport.  While it is a competition, sport is a word mostly reserved for competitive activities that involve physical exertion.  Because Halo 3 requires almost no physical exertion, it's not really a sport.  However, it is just like one with respect to the competitive feelings it inspires, as well as the positive feelings of being part of a team, and winning.|`|KeGsrdyuaa	video games by definition are not sports. sports are considered physical activities. many gamers like to believe that games are sports and often call them so on websites and forums. however, these comments are written by people and not officials and therefore their comments are not necessarily true. by following the definition of sports, it can be said that video games are not sports however much people want them to be.|`|zJZy2b7gaa	Well, there is major league gaming.

GfwjOVGdaa	You might have to reinstall the game to fix the problem, and check what you recently downloaded because it might be carrying something thats harmful to your game.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Most likely, it's custom content.  Take all of it out (you don't have to delete it, just move it).  Then try loading the game.  If it works, it's some bad CC and you'll have to figure out what it is by adding some back, restarting, and waiting for it to crash.|`|VpGfonpqaa	It could be something as simple as a broken piece of CC, a hack or a problem caused by a cheat.<br>  <br>  You'll have to check for a broken piece of CC. Take your download folder for the Sims 2 and place it on your desktop. Start up the game and select the family. If it goes through with no problem then the problem is a broken piece of CC or a conflicting hack, it can even just be a piece of clothing you downloaded. You can either delete the entire folder or go through each piece of CC you have, slowly re-inducting it into your game until you figure out what caused the problem.<br>  <br>  If its caused by a cheat or an error code, your best bet would be to reinstall the game.|`|VwGfMv0paa	You probably just have some cc that is harmful.<br>  Take your downloads folder out of your game folder, and it will probably work, if it does, thats the problem.<br>  You dont have to live without cc, but you could try to find the problem item, or you can just delete it all and start new.|`|sooxreyoaa	if you use cheats it happens too

Xyj8I5aTaa	What platform?
GKGQQaObaa	To connect to the internet you're supposed to plug the ethernet cable from the Xbox into the router, not to a labtop. If you are connecting it to a router and it's still saying that, try unplugging the router and plugging it back in so it redistributes the ip addresses. If that doesn't work, you may have a bad wire or a bad ethernet port on the Xbox.|`|Med7VQI7aa	Try turning off you modem and then turning back on. It works for me.<br>  <br>  Or <br>  <br>  Also try unpluging some cords and putting them back in.
zJZy2b7gaa	Oh jesus where to begin. Well, your gonna need a good program. I hope you have experience with game creations. If not, start with something simple like Game Maker off of yoyogames.com. You'd need to learn code, and be willing to dedicate tons of time on it, considering RPGs are one of the hardest games to make. I would also reccomend finding some friends to help you. Unless you've made games before, I wouldn't reccomend trying this.

If you like being a zombie and doing most of the things I said above then this game is completely for you.  Me personally I love this game alot because I like ripping peoples guts out as a hunter.

Dso7k3sjaa	There are a few things that can cause this, but first try this to see if it will work because a lot of people are saying it works for them:<br>  <br>  Hold down the control key, the shift key and the Windows key all at the same time and then while still hold those three keys, hit the 'c' key and see if that will work for you. Seems odd to me, but a lot of people are claiming it does work for them, so just try that first.<br>  <br>  If that still doesn't work, then read this the posts on this link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bbs.thesims2.ea.com/community/bbs/messages.php?threadID=0b60abdf3a85acfc4a3e6b3d2ab97e1e&directoryID=44&startRow=1&openItemID=item.44,item.61,item.104,item.41,item.127,item.23" rel="nofollow">http://bbs.thesims2.ea.com/community/bbs...</a><br>  <br>  In the above link, it explains that some HP computers have a program installed when you buy them called HP Healthcheck and that program has "hot keys" so you can open it quickly. Apparently those hot keys are ctrl/shift/c. So, to fix it, you have to click on Start/Programs and then instead of clicking to open HP Healthcheck, right-click on the name of the program and scroll down to Properties and open that. Somewhere in that section is where the 'hot keys' are stored. So, you then either delete those keys or replace them with three other keys. Click OK or Apply if you see that, otherwise, just exit the Properties section. Now restart your computer, go into the game and see if you can now open the cheat bar up.<br>  <br>  If even that doesn't work, there is another program that's made to work on XP computers called Cursor XP. Here's a link you can read about it and how to fix it if that's what's causing the problem:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Cheat_Box_Won%27t_Appear" rel="nofollow">http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...</a>

Bzuo6xt5aa	The new release date is on June 2nd, 2009. As of March 12th (which is when I am writing this) it is 82 days away. I know it sucks.<br>  <br>  There was no defects confirmed, but the creators said they wanted to focus more on "advertising". They probably just want to wait, get more people interested, and then release it. Then more people might want it more.<br>  <br>  If you want to keep track of the release date, I've provided a link in the source box. You can post it to Facebook, MySpace, Bebo, Freewebs, Live Spaces, Piczo -- whatever. Good luck, and happy Simming!|`|sgRDJUXqaa	June 2.<br>  <br>  I don't think they said there were defects; they did say they wanted to focus on more advertising.  Besides, it's not always "defects" that delays a game; it could just be that they didn't have all the content in it that they wanted, or there were still bugs (like a refrigerator door not opening so your sim sticks his head through it, lol -- that was one from Sims 2), or they didn't get to test it enough.

HAYlmwdtaa	when you get the game there is an option to change the language content of the game.  if you like FPS and you like the call of duty series i would recommend it.  i have it and i'm not disappointed.  some of the language you might experience during gameplay ranges from:<br>  <br>  "DIE YOU SON OF A B****!!!"<br>  "Outstanding Marines...OUT F***ING STANDING"<br>  <br>  there is more mature language in Wolrd at War then there is in Modern Warfare.<br>  <br>  I might also suggest waiting for the fall season of this year when CoD: Modern Warfare 2 is released|`|dxjUr09waa	yes you should get it!!!!!!!!! its awesome !!!!!!! and when you do tell me so i can add you on wifi. yes they use bad language but its not that bad when playing online. during campaign, sure they curse most of the time BUT YOU CAN DISABLE THIS BY GOING TO OPTIONS SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT!!!! GEEEET IT!!!!!|`|veLyiJvHaa	yeah i recommend it. it is a good fps (first person shooter) for the wii.  there is mild language and violence which is why its rated M for mature. Id recommend it tho.  They dont swear a lot if thats your concern.
tcRpXd7Vaa	You can try and play stock market.<br>  <br>  Buy when things are low, and try to predict a boom soon.<br>  <br>  Say a crafting update might come soon, then stock on crafting items, so when noobs suddenly want to increase there crafting skill, they'll have to buy your stuff, at your slightly higher price to get a large amount of it.<br>  <br>  But you have to study up a bit on what they would release next and also start saving money to invest it. <br>  <br>  The greatest of these was when Rune essence and pure essence were split, stockers of pure essence became multi millionaires overnight. THey went from 30gp each to 110 gp each. But I bet no one will catch that break again.|`|mxdcQBxRaa	You can get free membership here just folow the instructions on site <br>  <a href="http://www.gaminglagoon.com/?ref=242296" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaminglagoon.com/?ref=242296</a>|`|zJZy2b7gaa	1st question.

Except know the update for fair trade completely ruined that. So pretty simply, Jagex killed off the best money making hobby,|`|JWMjnrbuaa	Yeah its pretty hard to make money now a days...<br>  Back in the day you used to be able to make a ton off of selling feathers to fly fishers and such. You can probably still make a decent amount off of it perhaps.
ZdpugvbXaa	Ok this is just an estimate but Im gunna guess roughly around 40-60 dollars because they rarely give $10 for any 1 game|`|27Sh9Dyvaa	You will problably get around 50-60 dollars I got 70 yesterday for Gears 2 Far Cry 2 and Left 4 Dead|`|Med7VQI7aa	Probably half of what you paid for or less. <br>  <br>  The original Xbox games can go as lows as the quarters.<br>  <br>  They give a little more for PS2 games.<br>  <br>  And the 360 and Wii games, they probably give you half of what you paid for. <br>  <br>  You'll probably have enough to buy those two games though.<br>  <br>  Check this website on the source.|`|HyqXzJtiaa	well, i sell my games at gamestop, but i only 4 bucks each. i know they do not buy the used games by half price from the original sale so they probably buy the games from ya by either 30% at the most or maybe by the VERY least, 5%, depends on the store location, or games popularity.|`|w7c6d2nzaa	they wont tell you over the phone (ive tried) but total 1/5 of what you payed if u sold all those games.|`|8XL8aC3Qaa	not very much youd be way better off selling them on ebay or to a friend<br>  <br>  for all of that maybe 200

m74SXLxqaa	First of all Halo wars is not an FPS like Halo 3 so you dont carry a gun and shoot people its an RTS and that means you control your army,resources and base to make a force big enough to defeat your enemy.<br>  Now Halo wars is really fun and it has the best controls on consoles when it comes to real time strategy,Graphics and Sounds are top notch and you wont get bothered by them at all its actually really cool to see a big army attack the covenant and blow them to smithereens.<br>  The cutscenes are awesome and you wont see better in any game nuff said.<br>  I love the game and so the eleven thousand players playing it right now <br>  BUT if you dont like strategy games then dont buy it.|`|C32K8iQVaa	if you like RTS games on the console then be my guest.<br>  They apparently aced the controls but the game made me bored within the first 5 minutes of the demo.<br>  I don't have A,D.D. but the whole idea and look of the game made me tell myself not to bother, I just smelt Bad all over it.<br>  <br>  Also once again, its a console RTS (Real Time Strategy) who the heck does this?!?!|`|4wNWz3Ykaa	Its really good.. I cant think of any reason not to get it unless you hate strategy games.|`|Og5MIoXZaa	It's so good my son can play it for hours.|`|3OwRKAhraa	Its an RTS, so if you like that stuff go for it.<br>  However the controls have a bit of a learning curve since they are on a console.<br>  The graphics are pretty good, i think, but that doesnt make the game.<br>  If your buying it to get the mythic maps like alot of people are, just wait for Halo: ODST if you prefer first person shooters.<br>  If you have xbox live get the halo wars demo and try it yourself.|`|5dK5p3yMaa	Gets boring and annoying quick, well that's my opinion.|`|9iSKgRF8aa	basicly if you like halo 1,2 and 3 then get this because you can see how it was back then where they were noobs at stuff, also the videos are great quality and the game play is great.|`|xgMQcCakaa	the movies are amazing. the game play is pretty sweet. the online play can keep it fun. if you like rts then its a must. i still play halo 3 though bc i love fps.
29maScwJaa	That's because it hasn't been built yet. You first need to make sure that you have sufficient power sources, water sources, and roads for travelling and construction before anything really starts blossoming. The 'commercial' sector will look blue, the residential sector will look green, and the industrial sector will look brown or yellowish. I hope that's what you mean... If not then I am not sure what the problem would be. There is an old update patch that fixes most of the main problems with the game though if you go to the start menu and check for updates for the game. I hope that helps, good luck
TYU3Mfjgaa	they dont make the old color ones anymore, you would have to go somewhere like cash converters or something. and the cost depends on which store you go to, and maybe the condition of it|`|df1TwMPBaa	try ebay or gamestation i Luv retro gaming i even got the first pokemon game|`|EVxBjkFRaa	I doubt that you can still buy them new, but I'm pretty sure you can buy them in stores used.

They also gave a game called something like Nagano Olympic Hockey '98 for the N64 a 0.0 out of 10, but I take this more as a joke, since the review is like one sentence saying "We'll give this game a real review when it is no longer Gretzky '98 with different uniform colors."|`|2C3jWDxdaa	The lowest score i ever saw in my game informer mag was a game called "lol", yes lol was the name of the game.

vtJDHJDYaa	I think Xion is the half Nobody of Kairi. We all know that Kairi has already have Namine as her Nobody. But what if Kairi's Nobody split into two by accident? That means Xion is the dark part of Kairi's Nobody while Namine is the light part of Kairi's Nobody. At the Square-Enix press conference DK∑3713, she was revealed in a trailer to wield the Kingdom Key and to have connections to both Naminé and Kairi.<br>  <br>  Little is known about her role in the game. She has now shown up twice: once in Twilight Town, where she aided Roxas and Axel, and again in Beast's Castle, where she and Riku had a verbal showdown. A recent Famitsu article has stated that she has a "tragic but brave fate." Axel was quoted saying that Xion often tries to escape, and he always brings her back. This suggests that Xion is not in the Organization on her own will, but is forcibly kept a member. There is still no confirmation on her powers, though she's revealed to look and sound like Kairi and have black hair, dark skin, and blue eyes.<br>  <br>  Xion (シオン, Shion?) is a new member that will be introduced in the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days. She has dark hair and wields a Keyblade. Xion was first shown in trailers for the new game and has also made brief appearances in demos. She was first believed to have been Naminé, but Nomura later informed the press it was a different character. The character's name was not revealed until summer 2008.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Xion" rel="nofollow">http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/Xion</a>|`|PTovC2Dqaa	That could be true because Aqua can wield the Keyblade and so can Xion. She can't be Kairi's Nobody because she already has one, Namine. Also, Kairi can't have a half Nobody, thinking that Xion is also Kairi's Nobody, too. A person can only have one Nobody that doesn't have a heart.|`|7W5JCf4Naa	I seriously doubt that. From all of the information that's out right now, Xion shows no relation with Aqua, and the two games aren't really related to each other. Each one has it's own story. Have you seen that one cutscene of Xemnas going into the Room of Sleep or something and talking to some armor? It's either Aqua or Ven's armor. Therefore, something must've happened to her. At that time, heartless didn't exist, so it's not possible for her to have turned into a nobody. And even if she did, her nobody should've aged. Birth by Sleep takes place 10 years before the events of Kingdom Hearts, when Sora was 4. Kingdom Hearts takes place when Sora is 14. That's 20 years. <br>  <br>  I believe that Xion is the other half of Namine. If you read the Ansem Reports, Ansem says that Namine was born differently from other nobodies. After Kairi lost her heart, her body didn't disappear and her heart instead migrated into Sora. Both Namine and Roxas probably came to be when Sora stabbed himself with the dark keyblade. Maybe somewhere in that process, Xion separated from Namine and came into existence.
5d0506fe6f86fded69f53c9e28c5f779aa	I had the same problem for a while and am just now getting the hang of it. First, it depends on if you're on rookie mode or not. Rookie mode only X will swing and you can guess the pitch but not the location. If you are not on rookie, X will swing for contact and square for power. Before the pitch you hold R2 and guess a pitch (x,o,sqr, tri, r1) and also guess a location using the left joystick. If you're guess of the pitch is correct the strike zone will do a quick flash of a red border just before the pitch is thrown. if you guessed both the pitch and location correct the location will blink in all red just before the pitch is thrown. I usually guess fastball with the guess pitch feature, that way I know if its not a fastball its likely going to be an offspeed pitch so I can at least get the timing down for each pitch.<br>  <br>  Once you get that down you also want to move the L stick to where the ball is going through the strike zone on each pitch to square up your swing. Next time you foul off a pitch or something press the L stick in (L3) and you will see where you moved the L stick relative to where the ball was to see how well the bat and ball connected. Once I learned to effectively move the L stick on every pitch to where the pitch was going I improved my hitting with more solid hits and my batting average began to rise and the game became more fun. Hope this helps.

This can only be done by going through Prestige. By going through this, everything but your Leaderboard ranks are reset. You will get more Custom gun slots and a different Ranking medal beside your name. This means that the rankings you had seen before will no longer be seen anymore next to your name. Prestige mode can be accessed after reaching level 65. (Technically, level 66 since you have to reach 0 EXP left to access it.)<br>  <br>  Or you can make a new account. xD.<br>  <br>  Overall, Prestige is a waste if you don't feel like doing it all over again.

Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 are excellent. They have such a compelling storyline.<br>  <br>  Harvest Moon has only one game that's somewhat like it. Sorry, I can't remember the name. It was an RPG, though, I remember that. And it was for the Nintendo DS. Also, the games Summon Night: Twin Age, and Heroes of Mana are great games. And The Legend Of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass. The Legend of Zelda games are definitely some of the best time consuming games I've ever played. Pokemon Diamond and Pearl are excellent games. Platinum is releasing in the US on the 22nd. It's going to be an awesome game!<br>  <br>  For Gamecube, that's tough. All the good RPG games were given to PS2...except Tales of Symphonia.

By then, there will be new cooler game systems anyway. However, if the PS3 and x-box are cheaper due to the economy, buy it. I would suggest the Wii due to free games and the extra fun it brings to all ages. PS3 and X-box tends to have more exciting teen games with action and violence. However, they are generally designed for ages 14 and are quite expensive.

AdtbjGUiaa	I do not know, but the closest I got to an answer was this(quote):<br>  <br>  "Gaia or Gaea, known as Earth or Mother Earth (the Greek common noun for "land" is ge or ga). She was an early earth goddess and it is written that Gaia was born from Chaos, the great void of emptiness within the universe, and with her came Eros. She gave birth to Pontus (the Sea) and Uranus (the Sky). This was achieved parthenogenetically (without male intervention). Other versions say that Gaia had as siblings Tartarus (the lowest part of the earth, below Hades itself) and Eros, and without a mate, gave birth to Uranus (Sky), Ourea (Mountains) and Pontus (Sea).<br>  <br>  Gaia took as her husband Uranus, who was also her son, and their offspring included the Titans, six sons and six daughters. She gave birth to the Cyclopes and to three monsters that became known as the "Hecatonchires". The spirits of punishment known as the Erinyes were also offspring of Gaia and Uranus. The Gigantes, finally, were conceived after Uranus had been castrated by his son Cronus, and his blood fell to earth from the open wound.<br>  <br>  To protect her children from her husband, (the Cyclopes and the Hecatoncheires, as he was fearful of their great strength), Gaia hid them all within herself. One version says that Uranus was aghast at the sight of his offspring so he hid them away in Tartarus, which are the bowels of the earth. Gaia herself found her offspring uncomfortable and at times painful, when the discomfort became to much to bear she asked her youngest son Cronus to help her. She asked him to castrate Uranus, thus severing the union between the Earth and Sky, and also to prevent more monstrous offspring. To help Cronus achieve his goal Gaia produced an adamantine sickle to serve as the weapon. Cronus hid until Uranus came to lay with Gaia and as Uranus drew near, Cronus struck with the sickle, cutting the genitalia from Uranus. Blood fell from the severed genitals and came in contact with the earth and from that union was born the Erinyes (Furies), the Giants and the Meliae (Nymphs of the manna ash trees).<br>  <br>  After the separation of the Earth from the Sky, Gaia gave birth to other offspring, these being fathered by Pontus. Their names were the sea-god Nereus, Thaumas, Phorcys, Ceto and Eurybia. In other versions Gaia had offspring to her brother Tartarus; they were Echidna and Typhon, the later being an enemy of Zeus. Apollo killed Typhon when he took control of the oracle at Delphi, which Gaia originally provided, and then the "Sibyl" sang the oracle in Gaia's shrine.<br>  <br>  It was Gaia who saved Zeus from being swallowed by Cronus, after Zeus had been born, Gaia helped Rhea to wrap a stone in swaddling clothes, this was to trick Cronus in to thinking it was Zeus, because Cronus had been informed that one of his children would depose him, and so to get rid of his children he had swallowed them, Gaia's trick worked and Zeus was then taken to Crete.<br>  <br>  Gaia being the primordial element from which all the gods originated was worshiped throughout Greece, but later she went into decline and was supplanted by other gods. In Roman mythology she was known as Tellus or Terra.

p1e15P7Laa	Well What You Should Do Is Tell Your Coach To Show Up More And You Should Practice More|`|bdSPKKqmaa	You could practice by yourself at your ouse or get a trainer|`|Kjy7FGNiaa	Why are you asking a board game section about soccer?|`|cxw5trhlaa	First off: <a href="http://users.erols.com/soccertip/" rel="nofollow">http://users.erols.com/soccertip/</a><br>  <br>  Understand that what your team is going to need most is a strategy that everyone is on the same page of.  Developing your personal skills is great, and I commend you on wanting to improve... but there's too many defenders for you to score goals on your own.<br>  <br>  As a left midfielder, your responsibilities are (in my opinion): Control the left center of the field... Create opportunities for scoring (through fast breaks or passing)... and assist the defense in getting the ball out of the backfield.<br>  <br>  The number one thing you should be doing is developing your conditioning. Midfielders run more than any other position on the field. <br>  <br>  Secondly, you should work a lot on developing your left foot. The easiest way you can create scoring opportunities for your team is to bring the ball down the left side of the field, and when you draw a defender, cross the ball to the center of the field near the goal, and hope one of your strikers runs on to it and shoots before the defense can get there.<br>  <br>  To pull that off, though, you need to develop a good kick off your left foot. Practice setting the ball on the sidelines, and kicking the ball into the goal area with your left foot. (Get your strikers to receive the balls and shoot... and get your defenders/keeper to practice clearing them)<br>  <br>  A third thing you can work on is learning to turn with the ball. By this, I mean practice having the ball kicked to you, and turning and running the same direction the ball is moving in one motion. This will prepare you for receiving the ball from the defense, turning and making an offensive move with it.<br>  <br>  In the long run, your lack of an engaged coach will be your biggest hurdle to overcome. Someone on your team is going to need to step up and take over strategy planning if you have no coach involved. <br>  <br>  Develop a strategy that isn't hard to do, and convince the rest of the team to buy into it. The simplest?  Stack your defense heavy and just blast the ball to the other side of the field as much as possible... then hope your offense can run onto the ball and score.  We called this 'Boomball' when I was a kid, and it's surprisingly effective if you have fast, powerful players.<br>  <br>  Good luck

JMgoJ5BNaa	hey cody<br>  Ill try to help you out a bit<br>  <br>  Sniper Class: Stick with the M40A3 until you get ACOG scope for it then live on that. I am on 10th Prestige and i still use it. Put on Iron lungs and stopping power and claymores. When you get ACOG i would suggest using steady aim though<br>  <br>  Assault Class: Try using the ak-47 or m4. They are both really amazing weapons and have decent damage. Put bandolier, stopping power, and possibly last stand if you want. I always put it. Or you can use deep impact.<br>  <br>  Sub Class: You can never go wrong with the mp5. Keep using it until you get silencer. That will give you the best usage ever (a.k.a. Noob mutilation :] )  You would need bomb squad, Stopping power, (and again my choice) last stand.<br>  <br>  LMG Class: RPD by far has the best iron sights in the game. You can either choose to keep the iron sights or red dot sights. (your choice)<br>  for the perks i would say maybe bandolier or RPG. Again i have no clue what your situation would be. Put stopping power and deep impact. (self explainitory)<br>  <br>  Pistols: For my choice i always use the m9 pistol due to its high firing rate. But when you get high enough level I would suggest to use a desert eagle.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps:)|`|5dK5p3yMaa	Well do u play hardcore or not hardcore?

They wont expect that.<br>  <br>  The campaign in so much more involving than in previous unmodded TWs, which is awesome. Also, I know far less about this period than the Middle Ages (or Rome) for that matter, so I'm not having little red flag pop in my brain when something isn't quite right. Mind you, I'm doing an Imperial Britain course this semester, but all that is doing is making me want to go home and play!<br>  <br>  Also, more than any other game recently, I really need to upgrade my computer for this one.
QyNAJxGyaa	Here are some ideas. <br>  Stain Glass Paint - All you would need is a vase or a glass bottle (you can get that for a dollar at a thrift store) and transparent glass paint (you get that at Michael's as well as paint brushes.<br>  <br>  Paper Mache Mask Making - You will meed new paper, a balloons, glue and paint brushes.<br>  <br>  Paper Mache Boxes - You can make storage boxes from old magazine pictures. Just need some old magazine, glue, scissors, and a paint brush.  <br>  <br>  Scrapbook - Get all your old pictures together and get a scrapbook kit, it will come with ideas for pages and not only will you be crafting. You''ll have you pictures in a nice book.<br>  <br>  Knit & Crochet - You could learn to knit and crochet. Just get a beginners book or kit. If you get the kit you will get free needles and yarn.<br>  <br>  Card Making - If you pick this then you will never have to by another card again. Just get some card sock, scissors, colored pens, ribbons, maybe some stamps. You can get really into it or just keep it simple.<br>  <br>  Jewelry Making - It's not as hard as you would think. But get a kit to start you off, because they come with every thing you need.<br>  <br>  Candle Making - You could give these as gives when your done.<br>  <br>  I have tried all of these and I love them all.

Just get HL2 or far cry, its better than both of them anyways and HL2 and Farcry came out at the same time (2004) So they are relatively new.|`|146a5124fcd1b234656c4ae9dbeafd90aa	I'd recommend the Orange Box, which has Half Life 2 (and the expansions, Episodes 1 and 2), Team Fortress 2, and Portal, at least one of which will probably be to your liking.|`|AA10237746	I would vote for F.E.A.R 2.  <br>  <br>  The graphics are nice, the style of the game is cool and I like it.|`|df1TwMPBaa	how about medal of honor and brothers in arms also farcry

Lvl 60 or Lvl 80? Alot of things come into play when trying to reach higher dps. Generally though Unholy will do the most DPS, then just run instances (heroics if your 80) for items with Strength/AP. Also make sure you are using the correct rotation (using your runes up before you use your runic power abilties, etc.)|`|k3ScdHhzaa	I think frost is best dps and let me tell you why, there are alot of rotations for attacking so there will never be a period where u wont do instant attacks, from what ive seen also unholy dks can do great dps as well but doesnt have as much instant attacks. With frost you do this rotation (Ice touch, plauge strike, blood strike blood strike, Obliterate/ howling blast (depending if you get the grime buff), then frost strike x 2 to waste your runic power. Then repeat this process it hits really hard my dk is 78 and hes already at 2k dps so what does that tell ya :) <br>  <br>  I Hope this helps|`|kBEExFAaaa	Blood is the best for leveling and is decent for DPS<br>  <br>  Frost os the best for tanking, well thats what i hear.<br>  <br>  Unholy is the best for multiple DPS.|`|goA7HnSsaa	Go full unholy and look up my pal hes a level 80 Dk Blakice on Shadowsong hes geared like crap and really good.|`|UObv7Athaa	<a href="http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=jfVMVZZfMbhxckgcoMfsut" rel="nofollow">http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=jfVMVZZfM...</a><br>  <br>  I believe this is the most used PvE spec as of right now.

lOcNcz2Zaa	**SPOILERS**<br>  <br>  <br>  I felt Killzone2 was a great game the story could have been longer but I love the crazy stuff you get to use like the Exoskeleton and the VC5 Electricity Gun the tank is also pretty cool. When i had beat the game I was very unsure if there was going to be a third game or not and I still am. I feel there can be one. During the ending you can see they are way out numbered by the air fleet but then again it does not show them being killed. There also the fact that the Sev sits on the stairway it kind of looks as if he is giving up. Scolar Visari is another factor he claims that the ISA have not won the war on Helghan and also when he is shot he state "Madness... The madness.... begins. At the moment I hoping there will be a Killzone3 but there also a chance they all die but a doubt it. I cannot see why they would just leave everyone just sitting there. Anyways that's what i thought of this game and sure hope there is another one on the way.|`|Xxviy63Paa	Sure, Killzone 3 will be released in the year 2013, right on schedule, just before Resident Evil 10 and God of War 5, and soon after Gears of War 4, Halo: Enemy Territory Wars Fortress2, Resistance 4: The Chimerans Still Aren't Dead, and Metal Gear Solid 6: Wizened Snake. And maybe about a year before the full version of Gran Turismo 5, which of course will be in 2014 if there are no more delays.<br>   <br>  There are lots of other sequels too, and lots of games like Killzone that use pc-style mechanics despite having an advanced 2-stick controller available. Game makers are still beating the dead horse of "look the ps3 can play fps as well as pc's!" instead of being smart and making 3rd-person shooters instead. You can't do fancy 3rd-person moves on a keyboard, but you sure can with a DS3.<br>  <br>  My boycott of sequels continues.|`|bKo79vnBaa	I hope not. Killzone sucks.

mHQl6FmGaa	Yes, when Microsoft releases with a new system and the PS3 stays out for 8 more years. <br>  <br>  The reason for this is because Resistance: Fall of Man only used 10% of the PS3's true power. Uncharted: Drakes Fortune apparently used 30-40%, leaving 70%-60% untouched. So if you were to take these figures, you would realize that the PS3 has a lot of untapped power, but is slowly being tapped into.<br>  <br>  I assume Microsoft will have to release a new system soon, due to the fact that their newest game, Gears of War 2, has to load map textures before a game (and sometimes doesn't load until 20 seconds later...), So it's plainly obvious that the 360's power is at its full potential.<br>  <br>  So in all, yes, I assume eventually the PS3's sales will get close to those of Microsoft.|`|O2RNsEOraa	I hope it does.<br>  PS3 is way better than XBoX360<br>  BTW, Call of Duty:World at War is sick.|`|kmeZBSlcaa	the two first guys above are both wrong...<br>  im sorry <br>  <br>  two weeks ago i was talking to a big time Gamer at GAMESTOP<br>  and he said if 360 stopped making games completely that it would still take ps3 two years to even catch up to the 360.<br>  <br>  now yes the 360 is a great console but it breaks way to much i used to won one <br>  <br>  now i own a ps3 and i love it <br>  <br>  Also the guy above me is wrong<br>  <br>  Call of Duty 5 haha i baught that game 3 months ago i played it for a month loved it. but then u have the glitchers that amde the game very unfun almost every game i got into had a glitcher and after a while i got so good that even with the glitchers ruining the game it got boring<br>  <br>  1 recommendation: Metal Gear Solid 4. play that game online.... never ever gets old game play changes evertime i get on.|`|HYeirHgqaa	Yes, when the price drops and when the exclusives start rolling in, people will choose the MUCH more reliable console of choice.<br>  But for now will we have to wait....................|`|11PsymVQaa	Yes i guessing it will.<br>  By the way call of duty world at world is more the sick!!!<br>  Even better when you go online.

Xxviy63Paa	If you beat the World's Hardest Game, no way was it the world's hardest game. The hardest game ever made was the text-only adventure rpg "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." I first played in on Commodore 64 in the 1980's, and never got more than a few dozen points. I tried again a few times over the decades, and have never completed the adventure the whole way through. I have never heard of anyone else actually winning it either. In fact, there is a hints section that tells you the crazy secret behind just about every part of the game, but even then it's still pretty much impossible. <br>    If you don't believe me, try it. It's still available on abandonware sites. But don't cheat by looking for walkthroughs or secrets with a search engine. See if you can actually beat it. Otherwise you'll be just like the one with the -1000 points - a cursed glitcher. <br>  Fair warning: it's nothing like the book, after you get to the Heart of Gold.|`|bKo79vnBaa	He is just that good.|`|NuRts8tRaa	if its a flash game then your answer is simple. its a program called Cheat Engine. it is a freeware program that lets you alter almost any number in a flash game. a bit hard to use at first but you get the hang of it

61N9UoP6aa	If you are a newer player to the game pick a hunter. The hunter is really easy to pick up and is a quick leveller. The paladin, the more difficult class to roll, will prove to be a better choice in the long run but they take a long time to level.<br>  <br>  I would pick the paladin.|`|AA11371251	depends on your playing style they say hunters are easy especially for beginners but I have a hunter and I suck at it I cant play it at all I am now leveling a priest and it is a lot easier for me so start one and see how it goes have fun be prepared to spend all day everyday in your house this game is way too addicting|`|AA12328571	I would definatelty go with the Hunter, so much fun having the pet there and get like double dps with you and the pet.|`|Y16olPxlaa	Hunter. Because it doesn't specify exactly what you kill so you sound cooler.<br>  <br>  Not a Paladin because I don't know what it is and its annoying to type and say.|`|5D4T6h7waa	Night elf hunter. hmm lol.|`|eBt2wwkFaa	can't  give out 100 points...|`|hprR6qfHaa	Depends on if you're focused on the end game or the process of getting to the end game.<br>  <br>  Rolling a hunter, you will get to 80 faster.  Paladins level really slowly.  If you roll a hunter though, you'll have a hard time finding a guild at 80.  Most top guilds already have hunters, but paladins are harder to find (because they are harder to level).  Healing vs. damage is another consideration you should make, although paladins can do both.<br>  <br>  Overall, I think paladin is a better choice once you get to level 80.  You have a range of things you can do once you get there and guilds will like you more.  Furthermore, hunters are pretty broken right now (Blizzard hasn't bothered fixing them for awhile) and are complaining quite a lot about their lack of viability.<br>  <br>  The choice is yours, but I'd pick a paladin.|`|CGJdITxzaa	Well it depends on what kind of player you are hunters are a great beginner class but if you want to do DPS pick a Rogue or Warrior but a hunter can also DPS too though or you want to be a healer then pick a paladin, druid or priest but each class has 3 different Talents or as people who play WoW call them "Specs" where it allows you to choose  from different spells or cast (Example) Like warriors their specs are Arms, Fury, Protection..........Arms is mostly for Arena, Fury is for DPS and Protection is for raiding Look it up at <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/talents.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basi...</a>|`|6xMkf08eaa	I would vote hunter just because I am a fan of good DPS. However, it all depends on your playing style and what you are mainly going to focus on.<br>  <br>  Paladins can have high DPS or they can also serve as healers for a group.   Hunters are mainly just DPS.<br>  <br>  <br>  I will say this also, playing a mage is very fun|`|Q3FdhYgRaa	there are very few tanking paladins so you should go with paladin just to be different and tanking is always needed.|`|FKsxbgOSaa	Hunter definitely|`|R6ajHB27aa	night elf hunter because leveling is fast if you use this class.|`|sBYigrsEaa	hunter just cause|`|x1qKGmzSaa	hunter.lol. and how would someone give 100 points?<br>  <br>  :)

If it went wacky like San Andreas (planes, jetpacks, crazy nonsense), it'd be the best game. Don't get me wrong, it's a hell of a game.

3oKcNr3caa	not legally|`|fub5QVFfaa	Not normal wow, but if you just want to test it before downloading completely, most Private servers allow for some patches to not be online to work. Also, getting a friend who downloaded them to put them on a USB or CD works well, as you just copy and paste them into the world or warcraft file in program files. The game wil "download" the files (not really, just looks like it, it really just scans that you have them in the folder) and will allow almost instant access.

Wmn5Bh1Zaa	Yes it's fine.  I used a basic Razor scooter (the original kind, back when they first came out) and they worked fine.  Don't get one with a wheelie bar (if you can), they just get in the way.  Your main problem will be grip.

There's a hot key to do it too - look it up in the options/controls menu. Pets will try to get behind their targets when engaging in melee combat.<br>          Follow: This command tells your pet to ignore everything else and just follow you.<br>          Stay: This is useful when you want your pet to stay in place. You can leave it outside of town or a building, go do your business, and then come back to it.<br>  <br>          Aggressive: If a monster comes within range of the pet, the pet moves to attack the monster.<br>          Defensive: The pet responds if attacked but otherwise won't act.<br>          Passive: The pet just sits there and does not attack, even if attacked.<br>  <br>  Pet Control<br>  You need to manage the hate of the monster between you and your pet. If the monster attacking your pet is about to kill it then you need to either heal your pet or get the monster to attack you instead. You can transfer the monster over to you by casting spells or using abilities on the monster that cause a high amount of threat.<br>  <br>  If the monster is too focused on you, you can use special abilities such as Feign Death, or have your pet use whatever abilities it has to make the monster angry enough to fight it instead. Learning how to properly manage monster hate can take some time. The goal is to keep both you and your pet alive until the end of combat.|`|Idg3Bhqraa	Maybe he is on "Passive".<br>  There should be a pet bar on your screen to control your pet.<br>  If not, you may need to relog or disable any addons if you have any.<br>  <br>  If he is on "Passive", turn him either to<br>  "Aggresive" - attacks anything in sight<br>  "Defensive" - attacks anything that attack you.|`|23336d0f54bb17d00c5e25199524de6caa	um..is he a non-combat pet?|`|nmejm9Nmaa	You have to command it, a small pet bar should be clickable when your pet is out for hunters and priests, not sure if any other classes have pets, I don't remember.

The moment she gets in, your money will gradually decrease. Drive her to a deserted alley and let the car sit. Eventually, the car will begin to rock, first slowly, then faster. Your health will increase as the vehicle shakes. Who knows what's going on inside? In the end, your health will grow to 125, and will last until the next time you croak.|`|hMSVmJN5aa	you gotta take a course i think and pass alot of missions before u can...it takes a **** long time to get the helicopters in that game, get san andreas its way better|`|4zjqU4zpaa	theres only 1 plane you can fly, its at the airport and is a piece of shhit to fly.<br>  the cheats are pretty mad too, you can make cars fly like planes|`|QTejwdtgaa	ya. you must do a lot of misson until go to number 3 island.and you enjoy your plane but thats  plane cant fly but run like car.=.= i have play it and hate the planes|`|Z2k0W9F7aa	There aren't any planes or helicopters in GTA 3 I am a big Fan of GTA i got all them but san andreas.

EFsM3t9Xaa	Essentially, your pokemon is gaining EVs every time it defeats an opponent.  So, once they beat enough enemies to rack up the limit of 510 EVs, vitamins no longer work.  However, if you use the special berries (Pomeg for HP, Kelpsy for Atk, Qualot for Def, Hondew for Sp. Atk, and Grepa for Sp. Def) to bring its level back down (assuming it has not reached lv. 100), you should be able to feed them vitamins.  The rest of this answer gets more into the details.<br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>  <br>  "Effort values, often abbreviated as EVs, are an important part of Pokémon training to consider. While raising a Pokémon's level is a very important part of its training, making sure that a Pokémon gains effort points in the correct stats is just as important to making the Pokémon the best it can be.<br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>  <br>  "In Generation I, the basic EV system was introduced. Each Pokémon would give out either 1, 2, or 3 effort points, depending on its species, in a particular stat (Attack, Defense, Speed, Special, or HP). With these effort points, a Pokémon would get stronger in a specific stat by battling the same kind of Pokémon over and over. For example, continually battling Jolteon after Jolteon, with its high speed, would cause a Pokémon to eventually have a higher Speed.<br>  <br>  At level 100, a Pokémon's stats will be one point higher in a specific stat for every four effort points gained in that stat compared to an untrained counterpart. Though leveling up stops at 100, addition of effort values can continue indefinitely, until the Pokémon reaches the maximum possible value for their stats using the box trick, where a Pokémon's stats are recalculated to reflect the amount of effort points it has gained when it is deposited in a PC. "<br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>  <br>  "In Generation III, the effort value structure, like many other things, was overhauled completely. A Pokémon now could not have an effectively infinite amount of training, but was limited to 510 effort points total, with 255 effort points being the maximum for an individual stat. This means that two stats could be maxed out (with 252 being the highest number evenly divisible by four), while another stat could get one more point. The box trick could still be performed, but only on Pokémon up to level 99. Level 100 Pokémon were unable to receive any effort values from battling no matter what.<br>  <br>  The vitamins of the previous two generations would also not merely add stat points, but instead added 10 effort points to a specific stat, and could not be used if the specific stat was at or above 100 effort points, or the total effort points amounted to 510 or more. Likewise, the Special Attack and Special Defense stats were finally split, and Zinc was introduced so as to give the Special Defense stat a vitamin enhancement."|`|8IX9X2U1aa	Right after u catch them would be the best time,since they haven't been trained so they wont have any ev's that u don't want them to.
nmejm9Nmaa	For DKs I would go full blood for DPS.<br>  And from 70 to 80 it should take about a week.<br>  If you're having trouble, don't run many instances unless they changed the exp rate, but I know when I played the exp gain from instances was terrible, go quest, turn on some music, and quest you're *** off, also do it alone, you'll finish quests quick and you'll level fastest this way. Good luck.<br>  <br>  For 77-78 you should be getting the quests done in Storm Peaks, these quests are really fun and should go quick.<br>  <br>  78-80 you should nail the quests in Icecrown.<br>  <br>  Yeah, I know what you mean. What I really didn't like is it was very possible to level back in Outlands just by running instances, I mean at 60 you got like almost a whole level from running Ramps once.

q6uyloYdaa	I don't think there is a cheat. But, a good tip is this: When you get an attack (broken string, etc.) hold onto it and watch what he's doing. Give him attacks when he is about to get an attack himself so he'll screw up and he won't be able to attack you. Once I figured that out beating him became much easier.|`|XbEqcwuYaa	If he gives you lefty mode, use a mirror for the fret buttons. If he gives you amp overload, sometimes you have the same notes and you can look at his. Store up powerups. If Slash is about to attack you, use your powerup.<br>  <br>  These hints can apply to Lou, and Tom Morello.|`|dKeltBtbaa	save all items until u get 3, then strike him and keep goin from there
n1AKTnfJaa	Well, it's sorta hard to tell without the movesets, but its seems like a pretty decent team with different types. However, a lot of people do not really like to battle legendaries. Anywho, I'd give you a 7/10.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	I don't help cheaters. Your not going to have any ev's and you cannot check IV's. I don't even know the natures and your too legendary dependent.

EFsM3t9Xaa	I looked up the pokemon, and I would strongly discourage evolving ASAP for most pokemon, and using lv40-50 as a rule of thumb is generally a bad idea.   So here are some more specific answers.<br>  <br>  To find what you are looking for quickly, type Ctrl + F and then the name of the pokemon you are considering evolving (not the fully evolved pokemon), or the method of evolution.  I also included pokemon who evolve through trading.  If there’s anything confusing or I have left out, just email me.<br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>  <br>  Moon Stone:<br>  <br>  The Nido families have many pro's and cons for when they evolve.  Check out the moves they learn and decide.<br>  <br>  Nidorina - Bite (lv22); Helping Hand (lv26); Fury Swipes (lv34); Flatter (lv43); Crunch (lv53)<br>  Nidoqueen - Body Slam (lv22); Superpower (lv43)<br>  <br>  Nidorino - Horn Attack (lv22); Helping Hand (lv26); Fury Attack  (lv34); Flatter (lv43); Horn Drill (lv53)<br>  Nidoking - Thrash (lv22); Megahorn (lv43)<br>  <br>  Clefairy, Skitty, and Jigglypuff learn no moves after evolving.  So I would wait until you have all the moves you want from them.  They stop learning at levels 39 (skitty), 45 (clefairy), and 49 (jigglypuff).<br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>  <br>  Sun Stone:<br>  <br>  Up to lv18, Sunkern's moves are the same as Sunfloras, but then they branch.<br>  <br>  Sunkern - Endeavor (lv25); Sunny day (lv30); Synthesis (lv37); Giga Drain (lv42)<br>  Sunflora – Bullet Seed (lv25); Sunny day (lv30); Petal Dance (lv37); SolarBeam (lv42)<br>  <br>  Gloom should not be evolved until the last possible point, as Bellossom only learns Petal Dance (lv44) and SolarBeam (lv55), and Vileplume will only learn Petal Dance (lv44).<br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>  <br>  Leaf Stone:<br>  <br>  For Vileplume, see Gloom entry under Sun Stone.<br>  <br>  Weepinbell and Nuzleaf learn no moves after evolving<br>  <br>  Evolving Exeggcute should probably be put off, as Exeggutor only learns Stomp (lv19) and Egg Bomb (lv28).<br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>  <br>  Thunderstone:<br>  <br>  Pikachu learns no moves after evolving.<br>  <br>  Eevee is in its own category below.<br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>  <br>  Fire Stone:<br>  <br>  Vulpix should be evolved AFTER lv41, but BEFORE lv45.  This way Ninetales can learn all moves possible.<br>  <br>  Growlithe should be evolve sometime AFTER lv43.  Then you have to make a decision.  At lv49, Growlithe learns Flamethrower and Arcanine learns Extremespeed.<br>  <br>  Eevee is in its own category below.<br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>  <br>  Water Stone:<br>  <br>  Poliwhirl should not be evolved until AFTER lv27.  Then, you must make a decision between the 3 movesets (and at what level):<br>  <br>  Poliwhirl - Body Slam (lv35); Belly Drum (lv43); Hydro Pump (lv51)<br>  Poliwrath - Submission (lv35); Mind Reader (lv51)<br>  Politoed - Perish Song (lv35); Swagger (lv51)<br>  <br>  The only move that Starmie learns is Confuse Ray at lv33 (Staryu learns Minimize at lv33 as well).  However, Staryu can learn Light Screen, Cosmic Power, and Hydro Pump after lv33, so you have to choose.<br>  <br>  At lv36, you have to decide which movesets you want for Shellder:<br>  <br>  Shellder - Clamp (lv43); Ice Beam (lv50)<br>  Cloyster - Spikes (lv36); Spike Cannon (lv43)<br>  <br>  Lombre learns no moves after evolving.<br>  <br>  Eevee is in its own category below.<br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>  <br>  Trading (with or without items):<br>  <br>  Kadabra, Machoke, Graveler, Seadra, and Haunter should all be evolved ASAP, because they learn the same moves at the same levels.<br>  <br>  Porygon’s moves are the same as Porygon2s, except at lv24, Porygon learns Sharpen and Porygon2 learns Defense Curl.<br>  <br>  Onix’s moves are the same as Steelix’s, except at lv52, Onix learns Sand Tomb and Steelix learns Crunch.<br>  <br>  Scyther’s moves are the same as Scizor’s, except at lv26, Scizor learns Metal Claw instead of Wing Attack, and at lv41, Scizor learns Iron Defense instead of Double Team.<br>  <br>  Clamperl should be evolved ASAP to whichever you’d like (DeepSeaScale for Gorebyss, DeepSeaTooth for Huntail), as Clamperl doesn’t learn anything.<br>  <br>  Slowpoke’s moves are the same as Slowking’s, except at lv36, Slowking learns Swagger instead of Amnesia.<br>  <br>  For Politoed, see Poliwhirl entry under Water Stone.<br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br>  <br>  Eevee<br>  <br>  For Eevee, only the highest level moves are worth learning.  Nothing that you would keep shows up until lv36, so unless you have a big Move Tutor plan, I would strongly suggest evolving Eevee as soon as the right stone comes into your possession.  At most, I would wait until lv36 (Baton Pass), because you aren’t going to miss much if you wait.  Also, you can get both Eevee’s and the next stage’s lv36 move if you evolve it right at lv36.|`|BgxZSnSDaa	immediately. it'll take longer for them to learn moves that they'd learn before the evolution but they'll be stronger.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	That depends on the moves you wan't I would say wait until lvl. 40-50 so you can get all the eevee moves. Then you evolve and change accordingly.|`|EUaIGX0Gaa	Any time because in Celidon City you can buy more so it doesn't matter just evolve the pokemon ASAP<br>  <br>  Hope this Helped<br>  Mip
6EocUFbhaa	When you say Rikku do you mean a typo for Riku as in the guy or you mean Rikku the girl? Rikku in Kingdom Hearts is just a little tinny fairy thing. Riku is amazing. He was the original keyblade master but then he turned to the dark side and then it picked Sora. <br>  <br>  Sora>Rikku<br>  Sora<Riku|`|7W5JCf4Naa	Be more specific with your question.<br>  <br>  The person you may be referring to is spelled Riku, who was supposed to be chosen as the keyblade master, but Sora was chosen instead because Riku's heart was corrupted by darkness. Riku > Sora<br>  <br>  The person your spelling suggests is Final Fantasy X-2 Rikku, part of YRP (Yuna Rikku Paine), who has been turned into a tiny fairy in Kingdom Hearts.

6RUJu3rpaa	Ret paladin, Blood/Unholy Deathknight or Enhancement Shamans are INSANELY fast to level trust me each of mine are 70 and only spent a week leveling them only three hours a week. if you have any questions hit me up im on USA Emerald Dream my characters names are Webbles Apocalypsei and Notnilc(ive leveled every class so i know for a fact these are the fastest) ive played wow for a few years :P<br>  <br>  EDIT!:Samantha wtf? lol shamans and hunters are completely different classes you need to learn your WoW. I hope you mean Draenei Hunter or you're probably newer. and blood elfs arent a class they are a race :P<br>  <br>  Edit2: I just noticed you wanted a race too. race doesnt matter besides for PVP id go HUMAN Paladin DRAENEI shaman and HUMAN Death knight Humans get a free pvp trinket 2m cool down that requires no trinket slots. (im alliance :D)<br>  <br>  FINAL EDIT: I agree with SoCal but the running outta mana and the first 20 levels of leveling a mage is HELL because you are so squishy you die at anything that comes near you but from 20-80 its a lot easier|`|hzQDocWaaa	?|`|32c5a26e00e77bac07f6445e8dafc461aa	Out of all the classes that I DO have, IMO my mage has leveled the fastest probably because we 2 shot everything and we can AOE grind.<br>  <br>  samantha, are you a noob? you can't be a shaman hunter....they are two different classes..|`|R6ajHB27aa	night elf hunter, although in my opinion, it would be faster if you let someone run you, or you get a leveling guide, just my 2 cents.|`|23336d0f54bb17d00c5e25199524de6caa	Peoples answers here made me giggle.  I have to agree with enhancement shaman.  I have levelled many toons, and my enhancement shammy was by far the fastest.|`|nmejm9Nmaa	Blood elves, I know many players addicted to blood elves who wouldn't play another class. They're pretty awesome.|`|RjAon06Haa	Huntersss. So easy. Night ely hunter. or shaman hunter.
25bf37e0a92ccb8a258d3686a5324e72aa	UGH my BF was addicted to this game like a man on crack. I guess it is all the different characters like elves, undead, sages, (etc) colors, quests, lands, all in the same game. I guess it was cool for him and it is an online game that you can play with friends but when they do the "raids" where you do a quest with a group of people in your alliance it would literally take HOURS.  He would come home and play and play and not pay any attention to me and I told him it was ruining our relationship and he finally stopped playing and is healthier for it.|`|nmejm9Nmaa	It's the bright colors, the smooth interface, the fun groups, the way the spells look, the way the skill trees work. People get so comfortable with this game it's hard to move on. Unfortunately the game does get kinda repetitive and boring towards the end play. It is a very fun game when you have good people to play with.|`|R6ajHB27aa	Well WOW is such a fun game because you get to have a pet, dig for golds and do raids with your friends. You are enjoying the game at the same time meeting other people from other countries.  But you should also know how to manage your time. There's still a lot of things to do other than playing WOW ok?|`|eMUSTCQfaa	I wish i knew.  When i played it i seriously couldnt stop.  It was like a crack habit man.  If you figure it out tell me about it.|`|2ymGlZ4faa	yeah! it's addicting. I'm an honor student and I tried to play that game and I was like, "WOW, COOL!" So, I played it frequently but not for long because some of the students(most boys) from our class are deteriorating because of the game, how will they attack, what weapons will they use, it's very strategical.|`|23336d0f54bb17d00c5e25199524de6caa	I think it is because of the social aspect of it.  You create and level a toon and make it yours.  You own it, and a piece of your personality is there.  It is challenging for sure, and competitive, and you know that behind those other toons are other people who are actually intracting with you.  It is full of interesting lore,  and yes...as many have said..ther are some bright colours lol.|`|BgxZSnSDaa	because it's essentially an alternate reality that's incredibly time consuming and demands almost constant attention, thereby ruining the social lives of millions. i was lucky to escape while i still could.|`|4z0aHyN1aa	i play wow and its a fun game im not addicted but i play it alot because im into these games coz im only 14 but if your like 40 or somethin i dont see how its THAT fun of a game :S|`|MkWaocwMaa	Quote: why is world of warcraft so addicting?<br>  <br>  ahh, because it is a really really good game...|`|iT2qK4Tpaa	not for me but trust me i was like that with maple story and it ends....eventually|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	I, personally, don't feel that it is addicting.  People who claim they are addicted to video games would blame their behavior on something else if it wasn't video games.  They just have addictive behaviors and would find some excuse for the way they are.  I used to play 8-10 hours a day with several friends.  I could also get up and walk away from it at any time.  It's not the first thing I think of when I have been away from home for weeks at a time.|`|3788e558db37b44f3577186d780dfdd6aa	no. i tried to play it and it sucks.

MAUCfTrEaa	It looks to me that your strategy is all wrong. Defense may seem like the best thing to do, but in reality, its not.<br>  <br>  If you are playing as zerg you need to rely on quickly getting offensive troops, and expanding.<br>  <br>  As Terran, you need to pump out marines (if you are playing against zerg) and overpower him with M&M (marines and medics).<br>  ________<br>  This is what he is doing that you are not - he is expanding. In other words, building another base to boost his economy. You need to expand as well. Especially if you play as Zerg.<br>  <br>  Another problem, you should be scouting him with your overlords. See what he is doing. Knowing what the enemy is doing in starcraft is a key to victory.<br>  <br>  Be fast, practice getting over 100 APM (actions per minute) to start off with. Learn the hotkeys, and know your build order.<br>  ______<br>  <br>  Now if you want to play Terran like me, which is much harder unless you are very quick, then here are some tips.<br>  <br>  -He will come at your base very quickly with zerglings (if he is good at all)... so you will need to have marines out as fast as possible<br>  -Be aggressive, take out those sunkens<br>  -Ruin his expansions, if he can not expand, he can not grow.<br>  <br>  Here are some sites if you need some help with build orders and strats<br>  <a href="http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=49681" rel="nofollow">http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmess...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gosugamers.net/starcraft/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gosugamers.net/starcraft/</a><br>  <br>  p.s.

eD7qRBKHaa	There are four theme parks, Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom, and Hollywood Studios.  A ticket allows you into any of these four parks.  If you buy the base ticket, you may go to any ONE park of your choice per day.  <br>  <br>  You may buy the add-on hopper option (adds to your ticket), and you may hop between these parks - meaning, you could go to one park in the morning, one in the afternoon, one in the evening, or whatever.  You can go between the parks and go to more than one park on the same day. <br>  <br>  To get into the two water parks, you have to purchase another add-on to your ticket, the water parks and more option.<br>  <br>  The cheapest way is just to buy the basic 4-day ticket (one park per day).  Each option that you add-on costs you money!|`|jHDeIPEfaa	You can go to any of the Disney World parks. There is no limitation as to which parks you can visit.|`|f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	The four main Theme Parks are Magic Kingdom, EPCOT, Hollywood Studios, and Animal Kingdom.  A Park Hopper ticket allows you to go between these 4 main parks as many times as you want for the 4 days your ticket is valid.<br>  <br>  The Water parks(Blizzard Beach and Typhoon Lagoon) are not included in the Base Park Hopper Ticket.  However, you can add the Water parks and More Fun option to your ticket(I beleive this is an additional $50).  This gives you a set number of admissions to not only the Water Parks but also to Disney Quest in Downtown Disney.  The admissions are based on the number of days of your ticket.  So a 4 Day ticket gives you 4 admissions.  Which means you can go to 1 Water park 4 times, both water parks twice, or Disney Quest once and split the remaining 3 between the two water parks...etc for any combination of the 4 admissions.|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Animal Kingdom<br>  Epcot<br>  Disney World <br>  <br>  for sure<br>  <br>  I believe you can go to Blizzard Beach, Typhoon Lagoon, and MGM Studios too- but call Disney's info line for more specifics.
ZNeadVNXaa	proxying is not permitted in sanctioned Magic play, but it can be a cheaper way for you to test out cards in a deck or to even construct new decks. You probably have a ton of old commons lying around. Why not write"BoP" on 4 and see if it helps your mana curve.<br>  <br>  There have been Vintage and Legacy tournaments that allow a certain amount of proxies, to help even the playing firld. These non-sanctioned events are run by stores looking to attract players, either with prize money or power 9 cards. <br>  <br>  I say if your testing deck ideas, go aead and proxy first but once it works, make the effort to get the cards you need. It hurts the game if everyone isnt willing to trade or buy the cards they want.|`|VxuMyTo3aa	As the previous poster noted, there are decent numbers of Vintage and Legacy tournaments which allow proxies. Since these formats have a very high barrier to entry (the cost to build a competitive deck), allowing 5-10 proxies allows players to build good decks without spending a fortune.<br>  <br>  For example, the typical Vintage deck can cost upwards of $5,000. By allowing 10 proxies (the typical amount), players can just proxy whatever uber-expensive cards they don't have (think power 9 and stuff like mana drains). This increases tournament attendance from 8 to 80.

irFvDZmNaa	If you are a solid player, then it should not take you too long to earn $500. However, a lot of suspiciously weird things happen on Full Tilt. Therefore, it doesn't matter if you were an excellent player, you cannot win if you are being cheated. I would be very careful if I were you. <br>  <br>  I consider myself a very solid player also, but I refuse to risk money online because I know many great players who win all the time at live games, but lose abnormally often when they play online. <br>  <br>  Lastly, just think about this for a moment. There is a donkey in the room, and you are waiting for the right time to set him up. Finally, that time has come. You have the best hand by far, and the Donkey only has ONE OUT!  Just one out! You get all your chips in the middle, and sure enough the RIVER brings the donkey the ONE CARD that he needed to beat your EXTREMELY GOOD HAND. <br>  <br>  OR, EVEN WORSE, suppose you have the best hand on the FLOP. Then, you reraise the donkey ALL IN because you know he has a crappy hand. You are sitting with the Ace High straight. The donkey has only 1 pair. You are extremely happy until you realize that the TURN, and RIVER dealt the donkey 2 perfect cards to recieve his full house. Now you're beaten. <br>  <br>  This happens ALL THE TIME! So be careful. Many great players do not even play online because of similar reasons as I have presented. Anyway, if you're a solid player, then I am sure you've experienced these events quite often. <br>  <br>  The real money is in Live poker, Blackjack, Baccarat, and Roulette (assuming you have a profitable system).<br>  <br>  Good Luck! I wish you much wealth and fortune!|`|WxmNSxNGaa	A decent return for a good player is 3-5 big blinds per hour, per table, but can be more at the micro limit tables. 50 cents per hour at the 5/10 tables is certainly do-able, and $2-4 an hour at the 25/50 tables is reasonable. So, if you really are a good player (just because you say so doesn't mean you are) it could take anywhere from 100 to 400 hours depending how much time you spend at each table. And if you're actually good, you should be able to cut that time down considerably by playing several tables at one time.|`|t8FJyxdpaa	Thats a question only time will tell. <br>  Thats up to how much u play and many other factors. <br>  But if you are playing without rake back it will take a lot longer. <br>  Check out my website for more info.<br>  <a href="http://s1.webstarts.com/sitnbitch/" rel="nofollow">http://s1.webstarts.com/sitnbitch/</a>

tHZtPo9Zaa	The Domino Theory was about Asian countries falling to Communism.<br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  <br>  You have probably seen those creative tricks, using dominoes, that start <br>  with rows of dominoes carefully set-up with each domino standing on end.<br>  The dominoes fall one-after-another when somebody tips the first domino.<br>  ? ? ? The first domino knocks down a second domino,<br>  ? ? ? The second domino knocks down a third domino,<br>  and after that it typically gets interesting and entertaining how the dominoes all fall.<br>  <br>  The Domino Theory was a foreign policy theory, promoted by the US government.<br>  They claimed that, if one land in a region came under the influence of communism, <br>  then the surrounding countries would follow in a domino effect. <br>  The domino effect suggests that some change, even if small in itself, <br>  ? ? ? will cause a similar change nearby, that will cause another similar change, <br>  ? ? ? and so on in linear sequence, <br>  by analogy to a falling row of dominoes standing on end. <br>  <br>  The Domino Theory was used by successive United States administrations during the <br>  Cold War to justify American intervention around the world, including the Vietnam War.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_Theory" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domino_Theo...</a>|`|UVUYG5jaaa	-make a good pizza<br>  -stay away from dominoes with the brass center, it breaks the dominoe in half|`|g4APbW4Naa	You should probably post this question in the Politics forum, not the Board Games forum.

sqHGKKhLaa	i think so cos when they are enchanted they get added abilities on........i think.......slivers are cool|`|648027ace1a4720fb2f2c005258439e1aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Stifle can counter any activated ability (that is, an ability of the form "COST: EFFECT") or triggered ability (that is, one that says "Whenever <something happens>, <do something>" or "At <time>, <do something>") that isn't a mana ability. This includes abilities on any permanent, including enchantments and even lands (although most abilities on lands are mana abilities).<br>  <br>  For example, Ooze Garden is an enchantment which says "1G, Sacrifice a non-Ooze creature: Put an X/X green Ooze creature token into play, where X is the sacrificed creature's power.  Play this ability only any time you could play a sorcery."<br>  <br>  If a player uses Ooze Garden's ability, you can cast Stifle targeting the ability, and they don't get their X/X creature.  Nor do they get their sacrificed creature back (that's a cost of the ability, and the cost has to be paid when the ability is announced, whether the ability actually resolves or not). The Ooze Garden remains in play; only this particular activation of its ability was countered.<br>  <br>  As another example, Sigil of the Empty Throne is an enchantment which says "Whenever you play an enchantment spell, put a 4/4 white Angel creature token with flying into play."<br>  <br>  If your opponent controls Sigil of the Empty Throne, and then plays another enchantment spell, the trigger for Sigil of the Empty Throne goes on the stack, and you can target it with Stifle, as it's a triggered ability. If you Stifle the ability from Sigil of the Empty Throne, they won't get their creature token. (Again, Sigil of the Empty Throne remains in play, and it's only this particular instance of the triggered ability that's countered. If your opponent plays another enchantment later, they'll still get a token unless you play another Stifle.)|`|ZNeadVNXaa	Stifle looks for an ability thats activated or triggered, so it has to say something like "do this : target that gets this" or something to that affect. The key thing to look for is an activation cost, listed before the colon, If an enchantment has that or says ench. creat. gains " x: tap x critters" then that could be stifled, but if the enchantment says ench.   creature gains flying, it isn't activated, it's static.<br>  <br>  And now triggered effects! All those will start with "when(ever), or has an interviening "if" clause. OR, even "at (the beginning/end)" You can even stifle a championing of a creature, since it's a trigger. Triggers look for a certain condition, and then go on the stack.<br>  <br>  BTW stifle is a great Extended format card. Try using it on your opponents fetch lands after they sack it. Since it targets the ability, the source doesn't have to be in play anymore! Now stifle acts like a strip mine!

AA12165015	Yahoo was updating the sites  you game demo may be bad.read info on how to fix it below.<br>  Yahoo games and rooms open with a pop up.  Turning  off the pop up blockers like Yahoo  says doesn't work very well!  Most tool bars like yahoo and Internet explorer have pop up blockers! When you try getting in lounge or room and it doesn't work. click on pop up blocker on yahoo tool bar. On the drop down list click on Always allow tab it will say recent pop ups blocked. high light Yahoo.com then click allow. On Google  blocker click on blocker and  it will allow site.<br>  . IE browser settings to allow pop ups Right click on Tools, Internet options, privacy tab, cookie over ride. Type in www. Yahoo.com, allow then OK.  If your tool bar has a blue gear with tools beside it, Click on it and a drop down list will have pop up blocker listed.Type in www.yahoo.com, click allow.  It is rare but sometimes the demo can go bad. To check, click Tools, Internet Options, Click Browser settings ,Then view objects. If any are bad it will say corrupted instead of installed. If bad delete it  and load the new demo next time you play.<br>   This is the proper way to use the pop up blocker. I have never had a problem or had to hold  any keys down to get in.  1st thing you do when you get in lounge is check small windows in options box. Once in room make sure you expand it to see chat area. You only see top half of the cards but you can still play. This also gets rid of the big ads at the top of the rooms.
LiTMU2Dhaa	I'm not really sure what rides will or will not be open that time of year.  I'm sure you could ask a park worker or look it up on the computer<br>  <br>  Johnny Rocket's Diner  is good if you want a quick meal like burgers and fries and built right inside the theme park!  Another great restaurant is Mrs. Knott's Chicken Dinner Restraunt!  Those are pretty much the one's that come to mind!<br>  <br>  Hmmm... not sure about that one.  I would think around $150 - $200 is a safe amount!

The least scariest rollor coaster was the Ghost Rider; its an old wooden one that has no loops. I was there about 2 or 3 years ago, but i still remember having alot of fun, all the rides are fun but alot of them have long waiting lines if you go during the busy season, i went in august so it was busy.  I don't remember alot but i hope this helps. You should get a map of the place so you don't get lost, bring suntan lotion, i believe there is a water park there so a bathing suit is reasonable. Alot of the rides take pictures so if you would like pictures bring money---a good amount of money would be at least 200.00 at the most if you plan on buying alot of gifts and food. HAVE FUN!!!

u8Km1J3Gaa	The only way to get them back is to move in a townie and get them to adopt your child. When they call the adoption agency they need to ask for the age that your child was, as they will be first in the adoption pool.<br>  When the child is back, you can marry the townie into the family or move them out leaving the child with the family.<br>  The child will not have any memories or relationship with the family so you'll need to use SimPE to get the relationships back (there is tutorials on the website).<br>  <br>  Next time, don't save and reload the family.<br>  If he won't do his homework and you don't mind using cheats, use moveobjects cheat and go into buy mode and delete his homework. His grades will not go down, but I think for this cheat to work he needs to have done his homework once so that his grades will increase.

The girl who answered first got the order right.<br>  <br>  As for the stuff packs, I don't think it matters as much as the expansions, but still try to get the order.|`|u8Km1J3Gaa	You don't need to install them in order, because I didn't.<br>  All I will say is that if you have mansion and gardens stuff pack this will need to be installed last. In my experience when I installed a stuff pack after this (I had everything installed except Family Fun Stuff) I installed FFS, and M&G wouldn't work so I had to uninstall and reinstall M&G
9NjGMSwkaa	I don't know if this is real and/or the full list but here's what I found on youtube<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yAIB2Rw2-Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yAIB2Rw2...</a>
fqP6u6YDaa	As a owner of both lemme put it as simply as possible:<br>  360 better software but cheaper<br>  PS3 better hardware and free online<br>  <br>  Both of them have great exclusives<br>  Xbox 360:<br>  Halo Series (Although Halo War is kinda dull)<br>  Gears of Wars Series (my fav)<br>  Dead Rising<br>  Left 4 Dead<br>  <br>  PS3:<br>  God of War 3<br>  Killzone 2<br>  Resistance Series<br>  Uncharted Series<br>  Metal Gear Solid 4<br>  <br>  I honestly prefer my PS3 cuz the online is free and hardware is much more reliable. DVDs get scratched easily so I have to take good care of my 360 games while I throw my PS3 blu ray games around and they dnt even get scratched.<br>  <br>  It's up to you, both are good consoles, if the price is not an issue go for the PS3. (Most people prefer the 360 because they own one, but I'm taking an unbiased stand on this, and the 360 is a great console but PS3 is slightly better in my opinion)<br>  <br>  Hope that helps =]|`|AAPJlIqxaa	XBOX 360! I love it. <br>  But there have been loads of problems with them: the Red Ring of Death, freezing etc. <br>  But they offer a free repair service. <br>  Also, the online features are better on the XBOX, but you have to pay for membership.|`|VXy34K7Caa	Get an X-box 360, they have the widest selection of games, sure a PS3 has a good history, but they don't have that many games for it in comparison to x-box, but PS3 has 1080dpi setting for a lil' better graphics.<br>  i'd get a 360 if i were you, just because, they are cheaper and have alot more games available to them :)<br>  (the onlines excellent!)|`|9NjGMSwkaa	I say you should get a PS3,it has some pretty awesome games coming up for it,i heard that DC online will be on it when it comes out but i don't know when,and  Dragonage Origins will be on it,now that game is gonna be awesome!!! don't believe me,check it out,but i guess to each his own opinion<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dragonage.bioware.com/origins/" rel="nofollow">http://dragonage.bioware.com/origins/</a>|`|Jsp3LFdmaa	if u hav a hd tv then go with xbox, ps3 dosnt come with hd cable and the control pads dont have vibrate u will have to upgrade all those things so xbox is a well rounded console yo buy.|`|OvWEj1rWaa	x box  360 better games all around i used to play nothing but play station till i picked up halo and was hooked for life. great system all around|`|C4l5HZYNaa	Xbox360 is far more popular out of the two, and it's also cheaper.<br>  <br>  There are quite a few good games out for Xbox360 and Microsoft games can be released on Xbox360 before they come out on PC and other consoles. I've got and xbox360 and haven't regretted it since.|`|nHLlruh4aa	xbox....better games better gameplay better online better everything
9512e3899fcf53d00edd8803dcbdec7eaa	I don't condone pirating software, so you should really buy the game you want to play.<br>  <br>  However, if you really want to download something for "demo" purposes, torrents are your only option.<br>  <br>  to learn more about torrents, just google utorrent.
XAv3og6raa	did u host the game? for some reason when you play this mode online most of the time the host doesn't earn any xp points. this has happened to me loads of times and its a fault with the game. i feel sorry for you, but im on ps3 so im glad its not only ps3 which has this problem
3Iyu7hrcaa	I always bring the maximum allowed to bring.  I don't want to feel pot committed at the first hand I raise.<br>  <br>  I don't reload to the max every hand (maybe I should), but I at least start that way.|`|t8FJyxdpaa	all sites have an average buy in. It will be in the middle of the min and max.You can change it to take as little or as much in between the limits as you want. <br>  You should play with about 1/30 of your bankroll. So if you have 300 you should start at a tables with 10 or less. This helps with variance.
