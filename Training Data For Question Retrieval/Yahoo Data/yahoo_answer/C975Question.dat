20060907032355AAKL4Ov	Sports;Football (Soccer);2006 FIFA World Cup(TM)	Chapeau bas! Hats off! Gi√π il cappello! GREAT France... but where was Italy?	Was Donadoni right? He said 'it'll take 2 months to watch the real Italy again'. Yesterday France dominated the match, their players were running twice faster than Italians, had lots of scoring opportunities, great plays, never suffered (only in the last 20' of first half Italy gave the illusion to challenge the opponent). Italy? Few ideas, useless long passing, ugly fitness, basic mistakes (too often French forwards were unmarked on field's sides, some attempt to low ball assists unlikely to be unstopped, wandering midfielders and so on). It was a full Lithuania match replica, with a top level opponent, it could end in a worst way, because second half was easily controlled from French, they reduced willingness and tempo when winning 3-1, since 75'...   Now, preliminaries are a difficult task. And could lacking of fitness be enough to explain such a poor performance?. I think they were out of focus too. Only some bit of willingness avoided an unforgettable loss...   What do you think?

On this website you could design your own car, hire a driver and crew chief, and name your team. You could collect codes to make your car stronger/team better from cases of Miller Lite and off the in car camera shots in Rusty's #2. So here's my question----Do you remember this? Did you participate? And was you any good. I never had much success....I don't drink so the only codes I could get were from Rusty's in car...which weren't as good codes as the cases. Would you like to see them bring them back? I know I sure would. Just an opinion as always.

Celtic made 8 signings in total during the transfer window, 7 of whom are being termed 2 year projects. Surely if they are good enough these guys should be involved in and around the first team. The board have taken a massive risk in my opinion if they presume the first 11 is strong enough to fight on 3 fronts for the remainder of the season.      Im not going to jump on the bandwagon that John Fleck is some sort of wonderkid but after seeing him twice, he has improved rangers yet he is only 17. Will Celtic try the same thing?

20090203045520AAgP12u	Sports;Baseball	If Pedro Martins somehow stay healthy in his entire career, is he the best?	Just pitchers in last two decades please because I have never seen other pitchers pitch before that. There are four names that are comparable in last two decades:      Pedro Martins   Greg Maddux   Roger Clemens   Randy Johnson      They are four of the best in my generation so far. Maybe the likes of Johan Santana, CC or other big name pitchers can catch them up but the fact is they are not their yet.      In these four names, Pedro shines the shortest time but probably the best of the four at his best. In his prime, he is Roger Clemens and Greg Maddux hybrid. Too bad his magic is gone due to various reasons and makes him fall behind Randy Johnson.      Let‚Äôs say he did not have those problems, is he the best of all?      Please don‚Äôt mention Roger‚Äôs drug problem. Not the main point here.
20090203044730AAW1f6l	Sports;Tennis	How is this for a crazy thought?	Tennis world seems like all about Federer fading and Nadal‚Äôs dominance. How is this for a crazy thought? Andy Murray will win French open this year by knocking out Nadal in Semi and beat Federer (or whoever) in the Final.      The ability that Andy has to get to the ball is quite impressive in this past half year and he reminds me of Michael Chen but with better ball control and serves. Even though serves is not a big factor on Clay, I believe Andy‚Äôs new physic and more mature attitude should get him far in French Open.      Yeah, everyone is saying how Nadal and Federer hitting the balls are out of the world and impressive as hell but the thing is in tennis, not everything is about big shots. In US open and the Masters, Andy proves that he can out run the likes of Nadal and Federer. I believe he is able to annoy them to death with his style of tennis.      What do you think?

I know that most of them are a lot better than me but I really wanted to be on that team.  I was sick for part of tryouts so I asked to be reavaulated so I could possibly get on this team.  Dont think that I am doing this just because i want to be on this team. its because I want to be more challenged and I am really passionate about soccer.  Anyway, when i made the team everyone was pretty mad at me and were making up things like my dad called in(hes hedmaster) and everyone said that I dont deserve to get on the team.  I just ignored it for most of the day until it got to PE period.  people were talking about me and saying that i am horrible at playing soccer.  it has gotten better and better since then, but still people hate me.  .........

For the Raw chamber, I'm not sure what to predict concerning the World Heavyweight championship.      But for the Smackdown chamber, I think they will have Edge survive the match, and then go on to Wrestlemania to defend the WWE championship. And at Wrestlemania, I think they will have Edge lose the championship to either Triple H, Jeff Hardy, or Undertaker.      What are youir predictions for the two elimination chamber matches?
