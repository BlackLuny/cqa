His record is shorter than Wenger's but one of almost unbroken success. His first job as Head Coach was at Porto, where he won the league in 2003 and 2004. He also won the Portuguese version of the F.A. Cup in 2003. In 2004, he won the Champion's League with a Porto team that cost a fraction of either Wenger's Arsenal or SAF's United. Wenger's had plenty of both time and money to achieve European success but never managed it.<br>  <br>  In England, he won the league in his first two seasons in charge. He was World Manager of The Year in both 2004 and 2005. He's currently on an unbeaten home record of 110 league matches (38 with Porto, 60 with Chelsea and 12 with Inter). <br>  <br>  Inter are currently sitting 9 points clear at the top of the league.

IjUqYbIxaa	I really hope the Pirates can put a magical season together this year. I was 4 years old the last time the Pirates had a winning season, so I hear ya, I am one of those fans hoping they will finally break through. The thing is, it is bound to happen, no team loses forever. They are really going to have to overcome not having a high payroll and working with the young players they have. I think the Pirates can win 75 games this year, I don't know if they will hit 82, but I surely hope so.|`|4uSRVZNNaa	yeah they might get 500 fans to come to a game once or twice.  but that's about it.  even less when they trade mclouth by the deadline for a few deadbeat prospects.  you're not excited about the pirates anyway, it's just leftover from the super bowl parade.<br>  <br>  whassamatta? truth hurts?|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Its possible.  I mean, I really don't see them being successful this season, but just being "near .500" doesn't necessarily equate to a great season.

Hahaha.  Seriously, yes there is, if only for the fact that this is a young team that is one year better.  Do they have a chance to do anything more than that?  Heck no.  So although I would be greatly surprised if they reached .500, I wouldn't completely count it out.  Stranger things have happened.

SSvgklu8aa	i KNOW ITS COMING FROM A GIRL...but i played for 16 years ok...trust me. Depends on the part of the body you are using. I'm assuming you are using your knees. Sounds crazy...but don't watch the ball. If you feel like you are going you lose the ball...use your foot to bring it back to you. Try to keep the ball on the center of the thigh...if you make contact at a part of the lower thigh it is more likely the ball with stray.  I can do about 45 on my thighs and 20+ with my feet and head each. A little bit of practice and you can do it.|`|viIC9hUfaa	lol 5 is good.......last year me too could only do 5.....well now i can do 15-20 easly the main thing is to keep praticeing and make sure tht when u juggle the ball dosent go in front of u it should be in between so where it is not to far and where u can get it...it just takes practice thts it.keep balance.

ZQCBqYTbaa	Hi Wiggysan, its still strange to me thinking about the costs of building a prototype 600.  Thinking you cant use an engine from a production bike, you cant use the frame from a production bike - where does the cost cutting come in. I know this is going to happen and might be as soon as racing against the 250s next year.  But its confusing me (which I admit is quite easy) as to how this is going to help cut costs. if they get into legal arguments over running a 600 class it could be more of a disaster than it is looking now. If teams cant afford to run an 800 I fail to see how running a 600 can be any cheaper. rider fees and travel expenses are the same. parts have to be custom made just the same. the number of races are the same.<br>  Maybe Im missing something again.  maybe smaller is cheaper ?<br>  As for the bike Im sure it will look great when it appears on the world stage.|`|IuwVj2kGaa	Hi Wiggysan<br>  <br>  With the engine and bike development of the last 10 years the 800 cc is now extremely powerful. Every year regulators look for ideas to slow down the bikes on corners or straight lines for the sake of safety. <br>  <br>  Perhaps the new Moto2 is the base line for a new TOP category.<br>  <br>  I think the distance between 125, 250 and 800 was very clear and adequate, Now the Moto2 is to close to the premier class and this one is downgrading so I think your are right , it might "cannibalize" the resources from 800 cc.<br>  <br>  There′s still a gap to cover between the 125 and the Moto2|`|e46d2c3d2a60fbc79b6ad9ededf072abaa	I haven't raced since 1984, when I raced FIM F2 bikes ( 250cc 2 stroke twins, 400cc four stroke twins, and 500cc four stroke singles) when mono shock rear ends only came on dirt bikes, and 16 inch front wheels had to be custom made.<br>  The bike you've shown is hot, and I wouldn't mind throwing a leg over it just to see how it handles.<br>  Looks like a real kick in the tail pipe.<br>  Does Kenny Roberts still ride/ coach/ manage for Yamaha?

VJ1Gsr0Xaa	well, im not sure about winning the East. especially with the Phils being the defending champs and all. as for the choking mutts, im not too concerned with them. <br>  <br>  winning the wildcard could be a different story. the rotation is among one of the best in the NL. Josh Johnson, Ricky Nolasco, and Chris Volstad are as good a top three as any NL team that made the playoffs last year. the offense is always very good, but its all going to depend on the health of the starting rotation.|`|E6EyY1klaa	I'm a Yanks fan, but it would be kinda cool if we don't win that the Marlins do.

Unless you live on an island, I am sure there are plenty of other places to go. You say you can't switch gears, is this because you don't know how, or is the bike broken? If you don't know how, learn, then you will have gears you can use to go faster, or to climb hills. If your bike is broken, get it fixed, then you will have gears to go faster, or to climb hills.

They turned it into a race car (their money), but they had<br>  a problem.. Kerry crashed the car on his week end, and they fixed<br>  the car on Jr's week end (Kerry still crashes)..<br>  Jr got his own car, and ran his own team.. Dale always thought that<br>  Kelly should be the racers, she was better than Jr.. She went to school instead..<br>  When Jr got pretty good, he got try outs (it isn't a bad thing for a race driver to be Dale Earnhardt's son, Kerry got them too)..<br>  He went on from there.. At the time Dale had stopped driving Busch..<br>  He had his own 3 car (DEI), and put one good driver after another in<br>  the car trying to replace himself, and nothing worked, they never did the ride justice.. In 97 he tried Jr, and he passed the "test"..<br>  The next season, Jr won the title, and the year after as well..<br>  In 2001 DEI started as a Cup team built around the driver that gave him two Busch titles in a row.. Ask, Boyer, Burton, Kenseth, Edwards, or Kyle Busch how hard that is to do..|`|muc8sq9naa	Sadly because so many people expect him to be just like his dad, and drive just like his dad.  The public has given him mighty big shoes to fill.  He just wants to be his own man, judged on his own merits.  He started out working in the garage doing oil changes at his dad's car dealership.  He and his brother bought a kart to race and made enough to buy a car to race, and moved up from there.

He's got 12 wins since 2002, and hasn't won a points race in 2 yrs(if non-points races don't count for Jr, they don't count for anyone else either). And remember this from 2001-2003 Kevin was basically driving repainted #3 cars. Aside from the 2003 Championship Jr and Kenseth have very similar numbers(Matt finally caught up in the win column this year). The same with Kurt Busch. I'm not saying Jr's the best driver out there, but he's not the terrible driver that haters make him out to be.|`|UVb2a1BZaa	He is greatly overrated. He makes far too many bone headed mistakes for a driver with his experience. When he makes a mistake in the pits or something frustrates him, he drives way over his head and ends up taking other cars out.  It's all about Jr.   I'm sure he's the "most popular" driver(big hairy deal), but he is not even in the top 10 best drivers... Trust me....  Kyle Busch, Jeff Gordon, J. Johnson, Harvick, Biffle , Kenseth, Edwards, etc..... are far better drivers than he his.<br>  He's under the gun now because if he can't win with Hendrick, he just can't win.|`|E4bbO2Cdaa	Jr.'s a great guy, a good driver, and entertaining.  Is he the best driver?  NO.  Not even in the top 5 as far as I'm concerned.  Now for likability, he's COOL!  And I think with the drivers and power at HMS he's going to get better, but right now...he's got to be in 7-10th for "best drivers" and even that's up for debate.|`|l4ZQchFkaa	Man I went to the october race at Talladega 2001, 2002, 2003!

People are jealous cause he's popular, and because of his last name. Well GET OVER IT JR HATERS he didn't ask for it, it just happened and believe it or not he cares alot (probably) to damn much about what his fans and others think. then we always hear...he's not his dad...WELL GET A CLUE HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE...and besides when he does act like his dad a little then the haters have to start their crying and say things like did you see what Jr did, or can you believe he was driving like that...WELL I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU ALL, IF IT HAD BEEN HIS DAD OR KYLE BUSCH OR TONY STEWART THEN NO ONE WOULD OF THOUGHT TWICE ABOUT IT. No matter what Jr does, the bashers and haters have to dog on Jr, that's all they've got to do.I guess. I still say let them worry about their driver as much as they do Jr and all would be alright. So I don't think Jr is overrated, his popularity is just the way the cards were dealt. People don't give him enough credit. They also don't have any idea what they are talking about when they say it was handed to him on a silver platter cause Sr made him work for anything Jr got. That's just something they'd have to think about, and it takes to much energy. The bashing comes easier. BTW I agree with your last statement and now I'll quit my ranting.|`|PGlZn1wEaa	He's not overrated at all.  He's rated where he finishes every season.  Last year he was rated 12.  The year before 14th,  Right now 35th.  Maybe by the end of the year he'll be rated 1st or 9th.  Gosh I hate that word and it makes no sense.  He's rated where he freakin finishes.<br>  <br>  I do have to hand it to him, Fox and DW yesterday though.

I saw an older guy there. He had on a long sleeve denim shirt that was embroidered over the left pocket with a green #18 Interstate Battery, and a white #96 Ask.com ball cap. I nudged my sister and pointed at him and said, "Now that's a fan any driver would want." <br>  Also, during the 500, at the end of my row, was a woman who, EVERY time the cars came out turn two and headed down the back stretch, screamed "GO KYLE! GO! GO! GO KYLE GO"  above the crowd and the engine noise. She never missed a lap. Not once. Not ever. And didn't lose her voice. It was only after Kyle wrecked that she was quiet. <br>  As Winter Glory stated, it doesn't matter what other people think. By the numbers, Jr isn't the best driver. That didn't stop me from yelling and screaming when Tony pushed him to the lead in the 500. By the numbers, Kyle isn't the most popular driver. That didn't stop Miss "GO KYLE" from stressing her vocal chords at the Daytona 500. <br>  People say a lot of things that don't mean diddly. Does it matter how Jr "got" where he is? Nope. He is a Sprint Cup driver and he has a huge fan base. Nothing can change that. I like Jr for a lot of reasons and most of them do not include his heritage, his wins, or his championships.  (that last one is obvious!) <br>  I just hope that all of todays Jr and Kyle fans are like the Bobby Labonte fan I saw at Daytona. True fans, through the good times and the bad.|`|CnLigrwbaa	this has been going on since dale sr. died.<br>  look<br>  think what you want.Dale Jr. has talent, and thats why people like him.

You just have to get stronger and you can really improve your speed. The fastest runners don't collapse at the ankle/knee at ground contact. To get stronger do 'negatives'. Stand on a chair, on one leg, on ball of foot. Lower yourself to the floor on one leg as slow as you can. When you can do 8 reps under control hold some weights and work back up to 8 reps. Your running will really improve as you get stronger. Also run under distance sprints practicing staying as relaxed as possible.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	you need to go and run 3-5 times a week ask your track coach for a plan , but you need to put in some miles to gain endurance|`|4A3LOZkuaa	Im in seventh grade and joined track team also.

IWM1khX7aa	2-0 Atletico v Porto: Atletico has the home side, but they haven't been that great lately. Porto have beaten Arsenal in UCL, but I don't think they will win now. Segio Aguero and Diego Forlan will each have goals.<br>  <br>  1-2 Lyon v Barcelona: Lyon haven't lost in Ligue 1 since December, and Barcelona haven't won in their last 2 games in La Liga. But I think Barcelona will take the negative energy and use it defeat Lyon. Karim Benzema will score for Lyon and Eto'o and Messi will score for Barcelona.<br>  <br>  0-0 Arsenal v Roma: Arsenal has not scored in the Premier League since January. They don't have Fabregas, Walcott, and Rosicky. If they can't score against Sunderland, don't expect them to score against Roma. Roma has not faced Arsenal, and I don't think they will do well either.<br>  <br>  2-0 Internazionale v Manchester United: Both teams have done well lately, but I think Inter will win the first game at home. Manchester United have not done well against Italian teams. Ibrahimovic will score a pair of goals for Inter in their win.<br>  <br>  3-1 Real Madrid v Liverpool: Real have not loss since "El Classico" against Barcelona. Liverpool drawed against Man City. Real Madrid als ohave the home side and Juande Ramos has been fabulous since his arrival at Real. Rafa benitez on the other hand has been under heavy fire. But Klaas Jan Huntelaar will not play in UCL at all. But Real will still win, with Higuain, Raul, and Robben all scoring a goal. Torres will score one for Liverpool.<br>  <br>  2-1 Chelsea v Juventus: Chelsea have Guus Hiddink as manager now, and he has had a successful managing career for average teams. I don't think Juventus will be a problem at Stamford Bridge. Nicolas Anelka and Frank Lampard will score for Chelsea and Del Piero will score for Juve.<br>  <br>  2-0 Villarreal v Panathinaikos: Panathinaikos will not last long in UCL, and Villarreal will kick them out instantly at home. Rossi and Santi Cazorla will score one goal each.<br>  <br>  1-1 Sporting v Bayern: Both teams are not at top form, so Sporting will not play their best, even when they're at home. They haven't faced a real challenge at all during the UCL because they had a pretty easy group (Barcelona as the exception, but FC Basel and Shakar Donetsk were in Sporting's group). But Bayern have lost their last 2 Bundesliga games, so they are not good either. Joao Mountinho will score for Sporting while Ribery will score for Bayern.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Atlético - Porto 1-2<br>  Lyon - Barcelona 1-3<br>  Arsenal - Roma 0-2<br>  Internazionale - Man.

xhPKkkELaa	First Question:<br>  <br>  "Rhode Island, with its hidden coves and rocky outcrops, receives the lion's share of Southern New England surf. It's divided into two, roughly equal-size surf zones, Newport and Narragansett. They are separated by Narragansett Bay, one of the sailing centers of the world, and connected by a toll bridge. With all the hurricane season hoopla, Newport has become the most famous surf area north of Cape Hatteras, but the photo coverage of epic days is misleading. Newport is not the Hawaii or Santa Cruz of the East Coast because the Atlantic Ocean just does not generate swell with the consistency needed to justify such claims. On rare occasions, large, perfect surf can happen during the 10-week window when water temperatures are comfortable. Because of the endurance and dedication required to cope with the flatness and frigidity of the rest of the year, locals are protective of their short time in the sun. After staring at the Tropical Update throughout the long, hot summer, willing tropical waves to circulate and grow, the last thing they want to see is their favorite peak overrun by hoards of strangers. Being the smallest state in the Union, there isn't much room for interlopers."   Surfline.com<br>  <br>  "Staying true to its label as the melting pot of the nation, New York is all about diversity -- from the madness of Manhattan, with its 24-hour bars, sex clubs and theme restaurants, to the suburbs of Long Island, with its disgustingly normal homes with white picket fences, 2.2 kids and a Ford Taurus in the driveway. The surf scene is just as diversified, from Jersey-like waves exploding along groins in the west, to the long, uninterrupted, Hatteras-like beaches in the Hamptons, to the classic, New England-style points and reefs in Montauk. There is something for everyone. To truly score, you must be a motivated and versatile surfer. Monday, you could be surfing a 2-foot sloppy beachbreak, and Tuesday, you could be dropping into an overhead freight train at a pointbreak."          Surfline.com<br>  <a href="http://www.surfline.com/travel/#4716" rel="nofollow">http://www.surfline.com/travel/#4716</a><br>  <br>  Second question<br>  <br>  This question comes up a lot on YA Surfing, and it is impossible to answer it accurately on-line. Although I am sure you will get lots of "advice" the real BEST ANSWER is to go to a good local surf shop and discuss your skill level, your size and local wave conditions with the folks there. they will give you much better info than ANYBODY out here in cyberspace. When you are finally ready, you should really think about buying a decent board, and avoiding popouts , and boards made in sweat shops in China, unless that's just all you can afford. And don't forget, there are always used boards for sale in every surf shop. After 42 years of surfing, I still get my surfboard buying advice at good local shops in the places where I surf.<br>  <br>  And, I know there are lots of nice kids who want to share information with you on line. But don't take the advice from youngsters, who may know even less than you do about surfing, a surfboard is a big investment. I am sure you are mature enough to read through the BS that lots of people throw at you on line.<br>  <br>  Anybody, on-line, who gives specific advice on what size board someone should buy is foolish. Anyone who takes that advice is more foolish.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avalonsurfschool.com/index.ht..." rel="nofollow">http://www.avalonsurfschool.com/index.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mckevlins.com/nopopstory.htm</a><br>  Boards made in far eastern sweats shops:<br>  <a href="http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkSTwhvv9kI/AAAAAAAAAfg/QMqBFAtXzQ4/s1600-h/chinaboards.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bp3.blogger.com/_hPACOtZKKko/RkST...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_su..." rel="nofollow">http://www.surfing-waves.com/beginner_su...</a><br>  <br>  Third question:<br>  <br>  I don't really know how well you are doing. You may have ridden the waves "into shore", but you may have been 'pushing the soup', and not getting very much out of the wave, quality-wise. OR, you may have been carving like crazy on those slammers. The only way I could answer that question is to see you in the water. However, what is MOST IMPORTANT was that you had great FUN. Surfing is about fun. So, as long as you use good surfing etiquette, surf safely (for yourself and others) and really, really enjoy it, you are doing fine.  Good luck!
XieVq09Xaa	I miss the bra and panties especially!All thoose matches were great and fun but these fa*g*ts complain and would rather see John cena take his shirt off!!!! >=(|`|zQQOcvInaa	Yeah,When u said "Women wrestling"All i heard was Blah, Blah, Blah,<br>  Mens wrestling is so much more entertaining.<br>  All u hear is the girls saying 'OW WWW' 'OUCH' 'AHH' o"DON"T PULL MY HAIR *****"<br>  It's so pointless.|`|3dW0GQNYaa	Once Trish Stratus and Charles Robinson had to be rushed to the hospital after they suffered eye poisoning injuries in her B&P mud match with Stacy Keibler, the messy stuff was cut way back.  They had enough people getting hurt with by actual moves in the ring to have the "ring" causing some as well.|`|Y7cZC9KYaa	I've never heard of women's wrestling.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Maybe it is because that those matches were originally made for perverts and not wrestling fans.|`|smcDn76jaa	Sir there are starving kids in Africa that would appreciate all that food. In all seriousness they disappeared when WWE went PG(which I'm not against). Besides why do you want to watch that? Get with the times man go watch porn or something.|`|Pvgzw1bIaa	you like those matches.  I remember someone performing a DDT in the pudding and the other lady no sold because it was pointless.  Yep the way of the Dinosaur!  Now if we get great matches again like Trish - Mickie and Mickie - Melina we'd be okay.|`|1JywgkyMaa	if wrestling is so gay,why do you post questions about it you cock sucking little prick,oh,and your mom was right,i should of used a condom with her last night|`|1UKAho1iaa	Those matches were stupid and pointless. Plus, if they wrestled in some type of food, it was just a waste of food.|`|WyPOnZdSaa	Ahhhh... What?
6QWXJ7PXaa	That's exactly the reason, cuz he can say it, and every time he goes there and proudly/arrogantly says<br>  "I'm the face of Extreme here on ECW, I'm your ECW Champion, Jack Swagger",<br>  he only fools himself and people makes joke of him and now a face superstar (Christian in the case) makes joke about the Lisp every time|`|Pvgzw1bIaa	Because no one in the corner got Swagga like Jack, Swagga swagga like Jack.<br>  <br>  Either that or he is Swagger Jackin'.|`|Hp40PucSaa	because it rthymes|`|1JywgkyMaa	cause swagger means to be arrogant,and arrogance is part of his gimmick|`|XuVj5IdEaa	because he is Swagger in and out of the ring!!<br>  <br>  hes jack swagger<br>  <br>  AND HES GOT THE JACK!!<br>  <br>  HES GOT THE JACK, JACK, JACK, JACK, JACK, JACK, JACK, HES GOT THE JACK!|`|smcDn76jaa	Forget his lisp for a second and think about his character. He is confident, grinning, and swaggering to the ring all the time. Thus the name Jack Swagger, or Thwagger whatever your choice.|`|P93I8CHtaa	swagger
splWem0Zaa	Maybe it's the pressure of playing in an actual game.  I often pay better with my friends and at practice than i do in games.  I'm that way with high school too.  I play way better with my club team because I really don't care how I play, but in High School I play real tentative because I don't want to make a mistake (I'm a back).<br>  <br>  You sound like you should be a striker if you are fast and can shoot well.  Be the farthest man up the field, so you can blow by people for a fast break.|`|UnE1cycJaa	i used to be like that, but what i did, was i just didnt pay much attention to the actual games, and pretended i was just messing about, turns out i play really well like that. <br>  <br>  position wise, i think you would be a good midfielder, since you are fast, though you'd have to practise on your passes. as a midfielder you can defend (since you are strong) as well as shoot :)<br>  that's my position! :D|`|GEsyKBeUaa	maybe mid-field or forward> for your speed<br>  <br>  i would just think of your games as fun with your friends and the games aren't SERIOUS....have fun with it.<br>  <br>  my friends in goal....i make them pretend the ball is the most prized posession..like their dog.<br>  you should try to pretend the ball is like your dog or a chicken egg that you can't break. it actually works.<br>  <br>  oh and dont get too cockey...."my endurance,speed and skill is great"...drop the attitude!|`|3sWRv9xEaa	so basically your bad at the basics?<br>  <br>  um i dont agree that you should be a center mid, center mids need good passing and touch which u do not.....<br>  <br>  you should be a forward|`|LxLLDVFWaa	u should be middle because u go back and front and its fun being middle because u play more|`|amf1lwLcaa	Well first off you shouldn't be mad that you must pass because thats what you're supposed to do. But then again if the time comes when you must dribble through people don't lose your confidence. Remember if you lose the ball you can always get it back. But from the way you are describing yourself ( which I'm sure you're probably giving yourself a little too much credit but whatever) You should be a forward/ striker who's duty is more to score than anything else. But you must still be able to do the essentials. I hope you keep playing for many years, it's a great sport.|`|5X0p45Zbaa	1.Maybe your nervous when you play the actual game or you play with friends or stranger more thats a problem that happen to my friend and this is what he did!<br>  <br>  2.Sounds like you have good speed , acceleration , shooting , and Skills but your bad at  heading and passing try the position Strikers (Forward) because it mostly needs speed and moves and shooting but what you need is at least pass alittle and when its time for corner try getting better at headings and all you need is practicing!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.Soccer-training-info.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Soccer-training-info.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.Soccerwarmup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Soccerwarmup.com</a>

Nick Jonas would then not be able to do concerts with his brothers, causing 11 year old kids to get upset, thus giving the WWE a bad rep, then parents wouldnt allow there kids to watch, thus the WWE going back to TV14.|`|pnsp765saa	NO|`|1UKAho1iaa	Yeah.

bArDLkJoaa	they are illegal to use with out a prescription|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Steroids is a big deal cuz they CHEATED ! Is it fair to david wright who puts up 30 homers and 100 ribies every year and A-rod who hits 50 and 130 but cheated. Of course players who used steroids will find it eaisier getting to the Hof then players with talent but dont make the cut. I dont think the NLF,NBA or NHL do steroids and if they every did probably less that %5 percent would have taken them. The thing is those sports are a real team effort. With the bases loaded in the 9th whith a rund down u cant just pass the ball to Kobe and take a nice baseline jump shot. You get up to bat and take a swing. Theres more freedom in the other sports so theres less pressure to preform is what Im saying.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I'll try to answer all your questions.<br>  <br>  1) Baseball players use them because they help with muscle gain, which in turn adds strength and makes you hit the ball harder and farther, which means more home runs.  You're right, the side effects and long term damage could be worse than the enhancements they provide, but many people don't care.  Many are willing to sacrifice the future for enhanced performance now, which will directly relate to having bigger contracts.  Look at a player like Ryan Howard.  His batting average sucked this year, .251, but he led the league in HRs with 48, and besides being a poor hitter, he's still worth tons because of his power alone.  Not saying he used steroids, but its an example of how pure power will relate to more money.<br>  <br>  2) There are reasons why baseball is the only one that gets the brunt of the steroids allegations.  Increased strength directly helps baseball players when it comes to more home runs and more power on pitches.  Baseball also just recently started testing, for awhile players were able to get away with it.  Also, there are reasons they aren't as prevalant in other sports.  <br>  <br>  NFL - Really the only other league that players would benefit from steroid use.  The problem is that the NFL tests a lot more.  Every week 10 players per team are randomly tested, and the penalties are harsher.  The NFL tests for more substances than any other sport as well.  Also, NFL contracts aren't like baseball contracts.  You cant have a great year and get a 10 year guarenteed deal like A-Roid.  In the NFL contracts aren't guarenteed, if you regress you can get cut and that big deal you signed is gone.  Its not worth the risk.<br>  <br>  NBA - Basketball players won't gain as much of an advantage by using steroids as other athletes.  Extra strength isnt going to make or break a player.  Basketball is more about skill and overall athletic ability.  While I do think that its posisble some performance enhancing drugs may be used in the NBA, steroids aren't them, so thats why no one even brings it up.  Something like EPO that increases endurance would be more likely to benefit a basketball player than steroids.<br>  <br>  NHL - Same reasons as NBA.|`|sBdOzbx5aa	They took advantage of the fact that there was no rule against steroid usage.  They knew it was wrong and illegal,  but the financial reward was too great.  They cheated their peers(clean players),  players who chose to train and recover within the spectrum of what is legally allowed by the laws of the nation.  And it's not that I have a problem with some guy just trying to be the best he can be,  I just kind of feel sports needs to be played on an equal playing ground.  It is what is fair.  It's like everyone uses woods bats,  then some body decides he is going to use an aluminum bat.  Well I don't like the attitude that you feel you should be able to do things the others can not.  I won't even talk about statistical comparisons to the past players either which got altered during the roid era.|`|A2SogiGCaa	becasue it kinda like a cheat to the athelthes. example: when you are taking a test, if you have the answers in your desk and look at them that is cheating. The cheating paper is the steriods.|`|P93I8CHtaa	its a enhancment drug<br>  <br>  its also used around real-life wrestling|`|fJ4nYzVWaa	Players use it to get better numbers and thus more money. They arent thinking about the health issues when there is money and fame involved.<br>  <br>  You raise a good point when you question why other sports dont worry about it. Being an athlete myself, I know for a fact that steriods would increase performance more in football than baseball. To my knowledge, the NFL has a very good drug testing policy, as is confident that the integrity of the sport is still in-tact. For baseball, someone like Alex Rodriguez cannot be blamed since he was one of the MANY people who used and got caught. Yes he did cheat, yes he lied but many others did. The whole era is tarnished now, and this will lead to better drug testing policies and hopefully a better MLB.|`|hBNMTd2Haa	It is a big deal cuz the people who use them are cheaters and they have ruined the historic numbers that baseball prides itself on. As for the other sports, they all drug test and baseball just jumped on the bandwaggon.|`|X6xsnDJ8aa	There a big deal because people cheat if they use steroids then they get better, and they get more money. Then the team gets better, and the team gets to the playoffs and then the win, just because one person CHEATED!!!|`|i0Exuxi2aa	Dude, why is a Rolls Royce a big deal?!

910875de6723862c69bd16bf9f5b2249aa	Hearns last fight was just 2-3 years ago.  I saw the fight and Hearns knocked out a decent fighter at light heavyweight.  Hearns fighting a championship fight is a bad idea.  He had decent movement and great power in the last fight but every year that passes is bad for a fighting Tommy Hearns.  Hearns doesn't seem to have any effects from boxing hopefully he stays out of the ring.  He could probably pull it off but why risk it.|`|3q8LkLLDaa	calzaghe will be happy ,he just found his next opponent  lol<br>  i am only kiddin<br>  <br>  prolly hearns needs money|`|xHc3KGDmaa	he should not fight again he is to old to fight|`|kqP7GwOcaa	The Detroit News did a spread of boxing articles a couple days ago, and interviewed Tommy for one of  them.  Hearns says he want's one more fight, preferably for a title.  Nobody wants Hearns to do it, his fans, friends and family do not want to see Tommy in the ring at 50, but considering the parasites that feed off the bottom of boxing, anything can happen.  Hopefully it's just talk, but given today's climate in boxing and the debacle of Holyfield, Azuma Nelson, and other old timers, as sad as it makes me to say this, it is possible.

As for Pau Gasol being traded ummmmmmmmmmm that happened about a year ago so...|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Pau Gasol already got traded from the Grizzlies.|`|ySYCvabwaa	Ummm they already traded him to the lakers last year, were you in a coma?|`|Y7cZC9KYaa	MARC GASOL, sure, but Pau Gasol is long gone- THAT EXPLAINS WHY THEY ARE DOING SO BAD.|`|w8AFCj5xaa	you mean Marc Gasol ?|`|n6GvdeIXaa	do u mean marc gasol?|`|znqX7je0aa	si..no...si..no..si|`|d62609feeef052232f9aa56525f7e0bfaa	If you're not talking about Marc then I don't know where you have been for the past year. To be honest I don't think the trade was fair for the Grizzlies to trade Pau Gasol, but it what's done is done. <br>  <br>  Now if you're talking about Marc, no they need to keep him around a little longer to see more of his potential. He's not a bad player and can help the Grizzlies. But now the Grizzlies have Mihm, so he'll help inside.
9sWePMdqaa	Hey man you have to believe in yourself first. Just running a couple of miles everyday doesn't make you in shape. You need to CLOCK IT. Watch your time and compare your 2 mile speed with the top players on your team. Being in shape is the most important thing in Soccer trust me our coach's been telling this forever. Lift weights to gain upper body strength and do squats to get your hamstrings and thighs and calves worked out. Speed comes from your hamstrings. <br>  <br>  Keep working hard. There is really no magical way to go about this. You just have to be persistent.|`|55XTsmmFaa	put on another 10 ******in stone **** ****|`|bCcdHPlSaa	buy a protein shake at a local store. follow its instructions and find a workout program that works for you. also practice a lot with the ball. it is the most important thing|`|oAtdaDzhaa	PROTEIN SHAKES EVERYDAY,<br>  leg extension on 130 lbs and keep going up til 180 lbs. incerease 20 lbs everytimes, 10 reps each.<br>  leg curls on 70 lbs, all the way to 110 lbs. increase 10 lbs each time.<br>  10 reps per set.<br>  sleep a lot and eat a ton, thats my advise|`|GEsyKBeUaa	>practice for like an hour everyday<br>  >go to the gym and:<br>  -lift weights-<br>  -tredmill-<br>  -eliptical machine-<br>  <br>  get some advise or practice from and with the older guys or the coach!|`|4kAsly6gaa	juggle as much as u can and do track as well as soccer.<br>  because speed is a very useful tool in soccer.<br>  look at tricks and beats on youtube.|`|AdPiRXwOaa	All you need to do is play smart, if you trick them out or maybe do something they can't and you'll so do could.

Rosenfels did a fine job taking over when Matt Schaub goes down.  He has a very good completion percentage.  He would be perfect for a team that needs to manage the offense by merely being effective in the passing game to open up the run game.  He is not a Tom Brady or Peyton Manning, but that is not what the Vikings need.  They only need a QB that can consistently complete passes to keep the opposing defense from stacking the line.  It keeps them honest.<br>  <br>  Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|Jp7qZKfMaa	NO! Not sage Rosenfels! He's not even good enough to be a starter.....that's not getting the Vikings anywhere!  That just makes 4 qb's they have that's not good enough to start! They need to get Garcia....that would fancy my fat..
r07Mr0iHaa	Knock-Out is in basketball...here is how you play:<br>  <br>  Choose a set order for all the people participating. Once the order is designated, it only changes when someone is knocked out.<br>  <br>  Step2<br>  Line up single file, in order, with the first person at the free-throw line.<br>  <br>  Step3<br>  Give basketballs to the first two players in line.<br>  <br>  Step4<br>  Allow the first person to shoot. If the shot is made, the player tosses the ball to the third player in line. If the shot is missed, the player must immediately try to rebound and score before the following player shoots a free throw or the player is knocked out of the game.<br>  <br>  Step5<br>  Understand that if the second player also misses, that player must try to rebound and score before the first player rebounds, scores and quickly passes the ball to the third player waiting at the free-throw line, or the second player risks being knocked out.<br>  <br>  Step6<br>  Note that play stops momentarily when a player is knocked out, and basketballs are again given to the next two players in line.<br>  <br>  Step7<br>  Continue playing until one player remains.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	It's a game where you use two balls, first two people in line have the ball. 1st person shoots, then the 2nd shoots.

AA10702710	In southcentral PA, at least one  parcel of land near me was selling for about $400 an acre (200 acres for $80,000).  Plenty of lookers but no buyers.  The problem was, it had no mineral rights, and the timber had been cut about 20 years ago.  It was next to state game lands, so that was a plus...and plenty of wildlife.  But, no buildings or roads on the property.<br>  <br>  Land like that is great if you are worth a few million and are retired and can enjoy the time spent there.  But, I've had friends that bought properties like that...and all they did was pay taxes.  Their hectic jobs kept them too busy to really enjoy it.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	That sounds like a fair deal.  Jump on it if you have the means.<br>  <br>  Oops, I forgot to ask:  Is it accessible by a road, and is the road paved?|`|QrjuueMCaa	Land around here (W.central Wisconsin) is going for about 2.5K an acre. You should absolutly take the deal!!|`|fcc5487b88b4303d263e3ddb1df9a865aa	wow wish i had that chance here(and land close to purchase) up here in pittsburgh they sell crappy 1 acre lots for $10k-$20k(thats with houses right next to your property) and back in southeast ohio where i used to live they get between $3k-$5k per acre(even if its very hilly and mucky swampland) thats a great deal and you could probably flash $20k cash if you got it and have some nice hunting ground-excellent deal man! i know if you buy a big amout of land you get a better deal,but ive still seen crappy rough land go for $250k-$400k per 50 acres-very nice deal indeed!  ;)|`|aDNdND6oaa	Not bad, but great if water and electricity are available.  Hard to call something without seeing it.  I know the area a little, and I'm thinking their are some steep hills.  Check your trees to see if they can ever be an asset to your income.

aEwd0f5Waa	They tend to have more of an upper-cut swing to get the ball in the air.|`|MG6bYy6Qaa	It's much easier to pull a homer than drive straight-away or to the opposite field.  Thus, most Derby participants will try to do this to hit the ball far.  <br>  Also, it seems to me that some of the guys who aren't homer-happy guys in the first place (see: Abreu) definitely do add more of an upper-cut to their swings, and find it hard to re-adjust later on.<br>  But, in my opinion, the more reasonable explanation is that the drop in success after the Derby is attributed more to fatigue from the first-half of the year and either way (participate or not), they'd still tail off in production.  But seeing others drop in production has scared off some hitters from participating.  Also, some are self-conscious and are afraid of losing.|`|8qH5q7TGaa	It has a lot to do with trying to get air under the ball and trying to hit it far, as opposed to trying to hit line drives, which is what you really want to do.|`|QVDJi2GTaa	Its just an excuse to not compete,|`|fJ4nYzVWaa	You tend to possibly pull off of the ball to try to pull the ball, if the dimensions are shorter to your pull side. Also, you tend to drop your hands to try to get more power and left, while realistically this makes you lose pop. People just get bad muscle memory and it does in-fact worsen your swing. A good hitter though will keep to his swing and not fall into these bad habits, and probably has a better chance to win the derby + continue his good season.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	All that swining can leave ur arms and chest very sore. Sure the ball is slow but ur still using the same amount of force that it takes to hit a 90 mph heater.|`|YjTU7Psyaa	Just like everyone else said, its an upper-cut swing which is probably not the normal swing for most players.<br>  <br>  Also, the biggest reason is because you are trying to hit a home run with every swing of the bat in the home run derby. That's not what they usually do when they play regularly. This means they are swinging A LOT harder and faster over and over again through the rounds. They are not used to this during the regular game play. It strains the muscles and can then affect the original swing when they try to return to it. Its not an excuse, think about it.<br>  Go Twins!
l4WEwTWwaa	People box for a certain amount of rounds. It is either 4,6,8,10,12. The more inexperienced the boxer is the less rounds he boxes. Usually once you are fully experienced and fighting for world titles it is 12. The fighters fight for the agreed upon rounds and whoever wins the rounds in the judges opinions (there are 3 judges) gets 10 points. If there are no knockdowns the rounds goes 10-9 to the winner getting the ten points. If there is one knockdown then it is 10-8. The more knockdowns the more points get subtracted from that nine. If it makes the distance whoever has the higher points on two out of the three cars or all three win the fight. But if he gets knocked down and can't get up in ten seconds the fight is over and the guy wins by knockout. If the ref stops the fight because you are getting your *** kicked it is a Technical Knock Out, or TKO win. Or the boxer can quit on his stool and it counts as a knockout. In the case of a bad headbut that causes a bad gash they go to the score cards if it made it past four rounds and whoever was ahead wins. If it happens before 4 it is a no contest and doesn't count. Last but not least the ref can disqualify someone for intentional fouling.|`|xgBNImTHaa	who ever kicks the oppents *** it goe's 12 rounds no biting lol no legs just a good ol *** whoopin
9zyrMXF5aa	When you get to the point where you can play decent tennis then it's important that rather than knowing how to play, you know how to win. Learn tactics and strategies.<br>  <br>  Personally I think the most important part of tennis is versatility. Being able to adapt to any situation. Take Nadal for example who is an extremely versatile player. He adjusts his playing style constantly to best suit his opponents. Quickly find your opponents weaknesses and strengths and use them to your advantage. If the opponent has a monstrous serve then maybe try starting a few steps behind the baseline and moving in. If the other player tends to hit the ball deep take a step or two back, or if he tends to hit the ball short then maybe take a step in front of the baseline.<br>  <br>  Consistency is really important but the easiest way to do that is practice. Have a solid second serve. This gives you confidence. If you're confident that you can get your second serves in then you're less likely to hold back on your second. Be patient and wait for your opportunity. The biggest mistakes usually come from when you try to finish a match too prematurely.<br>  <br>  If your backhand isn't the best then here are some tips.<br>  1.) Hit the ball as it comes up rather than as it comes down. Even if your shot is still weak it gives your opponent a split second less to prepare for it giving it the illusion of being faster and stronger.<br>  2.) Move your feet fast and get solid positioning. Most weak shots come from rushing and not being able to position yourself fast enough. If you can plant your feet solidly before you take your swing then your shot will be much stronger and much more consistant.<br>  3.) Attack! If your strong offensively then your opponent is less likely to give you a backhand shot that's hard to prepare for. Most of the time you can even run around it and hit a forhand.<br>  <br>  Be confident. That's probably the biggest thing. But LOOK confident. Looking confident even when losing can unnerve your opponent enough to give you that slight edge that can be just enough to win you that match.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	well when u hit a big serve or hit a great angled shot.. go for the volley aproach..<br>  <br>  u can try.. keep at it...
CjgVacZlaa	Yes I think he should boycott it, but not just him, I really think everyone should do it. I really admire Rodick's decision to boycott it. <br>  But on other hand I don't think prime minster should have any saying in this.It's his decision and if he wants to play he should. If i was in his shoos ( or any other tennis player, not just jewish) I would boycott it. But don't get me wrong I don't hold it against Andy Ram, I am just huge opponent of discrimination in any way, shape or form.|`|pYieTvDqaa	Well I can see why the Israel PM would feel that way, but he has to think about it from Andy's perspective he's a tennis player trying to make it in a competitive sport like tennis and maybe he feels this tournament is important to improve his ranking and grandslam draw entry chances by playing this tournament. That's what everybody seems to forget he's still a tennis player trying to make it and I honestly believe everyone should stop telling him what he needs to do and let him be the one to decide what's best. It would seem like it's unpatriotic but really it isn't because he's been given the chance and he wants to take it so let him have it. Appropriate actions will be taken with Dubai and that should be the end of it. Boycotting really wouldn't help anything, it still happened and players can do or say what the way it still happened.|`|vFX2DPdIaa	Sooner or later someone is going to have to stop with the mixing of politics and sports.  Why not Andy?  If it was truly his desire to NOT go to Dubai, he would have said it when he was given the visa.  He could have said "You denied my countryman and now because the whole world is watching, you give me a visa.  I do not accept."  He probably wants to go; but now that his PM is butting in, he'll probably feel he should not.  No one should be put under this pressure.  It is a game.  I hope Shar Peer tells him to go ahead and demonstrate patriotism for the sport.|`|fAxVhD67aa	Why are jews not accepted anywhere?|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|9hC7bbf7aa	A touch subject indeed...Andy Ram was put in a tough situation.  He has been given a privilege to play because of Peer's sacrifice...Ram made a sound decision to show his respect for UAE for a special visa,IMO. Although UAE had given him the visa due to a tremendous international pressure. Do we always have to fight injustice at the same level as the injurer ? As a true sportsman, sports ethics should stand before patriotism or solidarity. Besides this event isn't the Olympics, representing his country ?  I hope something valuable and positive result comes out of this ordeal, for tennis and peace in the region. Tennis is well capable of contributing the mission however small it might be... I'm sure Shahar cheered Andy to participate in the match, I would if I were in her shoes. I have to disagree with the PM. Other players could have boycotted the Dubai tournament, but not Andy Ram, the last person to ignite more fire as a player from Israel...

oAjbBLDpaa	It hasn't really impacted it in my opinion and any impact was for the better. <br>  Basically these are the changes:<br>  No swearing - if the wrestlers needed to swear to get to become entertaining, you are just easily amused by offensive words. <br>  No Bra and Panties Matches - the divas are wrestlers, not strippers, they shouldn't degrade themselves for your entertainment. <br>  No Divas in Playboy - same as above<br>  Less hardcore matches and blood - hardcore matches were really about weapons not wrestling. The old ECW was the only promotion that could effectively use wrestling and weapons while others made hardcore solely about the weapons. Blood should only be used as a storyline enhancer, not a commonplace object that means nothing. If you see blood in a weekly show it means nothing but if it comes up once every other PPV you get the illusion of a painful match and serious damage. <br>  <br>  It really made the WWE a more effective wrestling and entertainment company that widened it's viewership with it.|`|1UKAho1iaa	It means that the WWE is less entertaining and will continue to be so as long as the PG era is going on.|`|DJeij6Pgaa	Yeh its really stupied why the hell should kids watch it anyway and if its pg why still show half naked divas.

The Deer collapsed where it was standing, it got back up and went Nine yards and expired.* A 90Lb cross-bow should not have any problems with penetration in a human body whatsoever.*|`|75NmeGKeaa	Depends on where in the body, but I have seen arrows from a 60 lb compound bow travel all the way through a deer.

You don't need to be constantly replacing your racquets.  I was about as good as you when I was your age, and I never replaced my frames.

But you have the depth to cover.<br>  <br>  The biggest weakness is in the left side of the infield.  I'd suggest packaging Beckett with Young or Cantu for an upgrade.<br>  <br>  Catcher is also risky.  I suggest dropping Putz or Arredondo, or making a 2-for-1 trade like above to open up a spot and pick up a Backup catcher (best-case scenario - Shoppach who can pair well with V-Mart).|`|oMVSKGKbaa	7 Crede is a mild risk and Helton has had some decline. Putz will probably set up this year. I Like your SP line up. <br>  <br>  See if you can bust a move for Matt Capps RP, he should shine again this year and has great numbers. I Would also look for a back up catcher like Cris Snyder from AZ. <br>  <br>  You will not finish the season with that whole team intact, watch for slumps early especially Matsui. <br>  <br>  Overall solid draft!

xxtvhn5Naa	In American football and Canadian football, defensive backs are the players on the defensive team who take positions somewhat back from the line of scrimmage; they are distinguished from the defensive line players and linebackers, who take positions directly behind or close to the line of scrimmage.<br>  <br>  The defensive backs, in turn, generally are classified into several different specialized positions:<br>  <br>      * Safety<br>      * Cornerback, which include<br>            o nickel back, the fifth defensive back in some sets<br>            o dime back, the sixth defensive back in some sets<br>            o The seventh defensive back, in the exceedingly rare 'quarter' set<br>                  + known as a dollar back or a quarter back (not to be confused with the offensive player who throws the ball)<br>  <br>  The group of defensive backs is known collectively as the secondary. They most often defend the wide receiver core, however, at time they may also line up against a tight end or a split out running back. They are usually the smallest, yet quickest on the field.<br>  <br>  <br>      * Cornerback (CB) — Typically two players that primarily cover the wide receivers. Cornerbacks attempt to prevent successful quarterback passes by either swatting the airborne ball away from the receiver or by catching the pass themselves. In rushing situations, their job is to contain the rusher.<br>  <br>      * Safety (FS or SS) — The safeties are the last line of defense (farthest from the line of scrimmage) and usually help the corners with deep-pass coverage. The strong safety (SS) is usually the larger and stronger of the two, providing extra protection against run plays by standing somewhere between the free safety and the line of scrimmage. The free safety (FS) is usually the smaller and faster of the two, providing variable and extra pass coverage. Traditionally, teams have looked for safeties with reputations as hard hitters. More recently, however, teams have been looking for hybrid safeties who can do both jobs, as in a cover 2 defense, when the strong safety has a greater role to play in coverage. Safeties are also used in a variety of blitzes.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Defensive ends and tackles are collectively called defensive line.<br>  <br>      * Defensive end (DE) — The two defensive ends play on opposite outside edges of the defensive line. Their function is to attack the passer or stop offensive runs to the outer edges of the line of scrimmage (most often referred to as "containment"). The faster of the two is usually placed on the right side of the defensive line (quarterback's left) because that is a right-handed quarterback's blind side.<br>  <br>      * Defensive tackle (DT) — Sometimes called a defensive guard, defensive tackles are side-by-side linemen who are between the defensive ends. Their function is to rush the passer (if they can get past the offensive linemen blocking them), and stop running plays directed at the middle of the line of scrimmage. A defensive tackle that lines up directly across from the ball (and therefore, is almost nose-to-nose with the offense's center) is often called a nose tackle or nose guard. The nose tackle is most common in the 3-4 defense and the quarter defense. Most defensive sets have from one to two defensive tackles. Sometimes, but not often, a team will employ three defensive tackles.|`|tIJ4fELfaa	DB is cornerback or safety, they both cover wide receivers and are generally deep, you need to be fast and agile to play.<br>  <br>  DE is s a player that is on the defensive line, he is on the edge and his job is to rush the QB on pass plays and contain running plays to the outside, you need to be lightning fast and pretty strong<br>  <br>  this is as simple as i could make it|`|6029e75ca40f064c546c13a9a3dc9f85aa	Defensive Back: Skinny, Speedy, Plays defense on wide receivers<br>  <br>  Defensive End: Bulky, Fat, Rushes and sacks the QBs
AA11456163	80,000 IS a lot of a cards -- if you don't own a store!<br>  <br>  You have a myriad of options, and it all depends on your motivation for keeping them -- AND, your husband's original purpose in buying and collecting them.<br>  <br>  DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A PROFIT?<br>  <br>  This will be the most time consuming choice.   But, if 25% of the cards are valuable, it will be worth your time.<br>  <br>  (a)  Make an inventory.   This is going to take weeks, if you spend 1-2 hours a day.   But you have to set a foundation.  <br>  <br>  If your husband doesn't already have the cards in boxes or binders, you will need to grab a stack of cards, and slowly begin to categorize them.<br>  <br>  I'd simplify them by (1) Year of release (which you'll find on the back of the card as a (c) copyright date, and (2) Name of manufacturer (e.g. Topps, Bowman, Fleer, Ultra, Stadium Club, Collector's Choice, et al.)<br>  <br>  You'll have to go to a hobby store and buy the white slats of cardboard which fold up into rectangles.   They come in different sizes -- I'd choose a large size, at least one that holds 330 cards.<br>  <br>  After you complete each box, mark the date and manufacturer name.    Put your boxes in bins or, if you have space, in a large empty space of "that" room.<br>  <br>  (b)  Now -- you'll need to price your cards.   Buy an online price guide, like Beckett.   That way you can not only assess WHAT you have, but HOW MANY of each.<br>  <br>  Either you'll have to go back into the boxes and list what you have, or list what you have before you placed them into the box.<br>  <br>  (c)  When you add up your collection, then you know what they're worth.   Obviously, if you're selling them in lump form, you'll give a discount to the buyer.<br>  <br>  CHALLENGE:<br>  <br>  Not every buyer wants to buy the common, ordinary card of a "nobody".   Not unless they're completing a set.   To entice them, you'll have to offer your lump with a few enticing deals.<br>  <br>  Example -- "For sale:  1992 Score baseball cards.   125 assorted cards, some duplicates.   Includes bonus cards:  _____, _____, etc.   OR, you might throw in free shipping, which isn't the best idea, but it depends on how badly you're trying to unload this collection and get on with your life.<br>  <br>  IF YOU WANT TO JUST DUMP YOUR CARDS:<br>  <br>  You'll have to be willing to take a loss in the value of the cards.  For example, if your 1994 Topps Cards added up equal $125, you'll sell them for $45, with shipping and handling added.<br>  <br>  SET GOALS:<br>  <br>  If you're determined to sell these, then don't start until you're truly prepared to go for it.    Be willing to accept a few losses, and learn from the experience.   <br>  <br>  REALITY CHECK:<br>  <br>  As I re-read your summary, I'm reminded these were not the very best years for baseball cards.   If your husband is 90% certain there's nothing valuable in most of the cards, you have 3 options:<br>  <br>  (a)  Find a hobby store owner who's willing to take them all off your hands.   A large store with plenty of help is constantly putting together sets.    Don't appear desperate when you approach them, or make them sound like you're dumping unwanted stuff/<br>  <br>  Tell them how important these cards were to you (after all, the hobby store's life IS cards, you know -- and turning a profit).  These cards are important to you, and you'd like to find a home for them.<br>  <br>  If you're not interested in a big profit, ask the store owner what is the best deal he can do for you.   Don't haggle over a few dollars.  After all, 80,000 cards will be removed from your life!<br>  <br>  (b)  Ask the hobby store owner, or do a google search, and see which charities take cards.   Hospital charities, or orphanges, for example, distribute cards.    You can donate them, and make them a tax-write off.<br>  <br>  You can also donate them to a thrift store for the same tax purposes.<br>  <br>  (c)  Unload them on eBay in one large sale, or several.   If the entire collection is worth $500-$1000 for example (assuming they're not great cards), offer them as a "BUY IT NOW" option of $149, and whatever the shipping and handling costs are.<br>  <br>  You could also sell them with a starting bid of $34.99, plus shipping and handling, and hope there's a bidding war.   Be honest in your description, but make sure you list the valuable cards, for sure!<br>  <br>  DON'T THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY YOU SHOULD BE GETTING:<br>  <br>  If the ultimate goal is to unload the collection, you'll have to assume you won't get anything close to what you paid for them.|`|AA10622982	If I were you I'd start with buying a comprehensive Beckett price guide to find out the value of these cards.  I used to be into collecting baseball cards big time myself, and I know it would also help to find a fellow collector to inform you what kind of market there is for these cards, what players are selling well, what players are not, etc.|`|AA10836764	Hey Philly:<br>  <br>  I own a comic book store in Toronto and I deal a lot with non and sport cards.<br>  <br>  First off, the fact that they arre abseball cards does not give us any info.  We need to know who made the cards:  Opee Chee, Donruss, UD. etc.<br>  <br>  But what you can do is pick up a Tuff Stuff or a Becketts and start looking up the cards.  Given the time frame, I do not suspect that you are going to have many gems.<br>  <br>  You can also check all the cards and look for rookies.  Then go on e-Bay and look up that card.<br>  <br>  80K really is not a lot of cards.  I realize that it is a lot of work to see what they are but you need to do some footwork to see if they are worth anything.<br>  <br>  TFTP|`|AA12285263	keep them...how will your kids or your grandkids know about baseball without those awesome cheat sheets?|`|aefd7c27f4186725df53d951d09d8221aa	go to ebay

GDBcPXlSaa	it's hard to tell you how to improve without seeing you, but there are some basics. First you need to have a running approach that is consistant, find a spot to start from that you don't have to studder-step when you get close to the bar, and always start with the same foot. when you take off, drive your knee that's closest to the bar up as high as you can, that gives you alot of momentum moving upward. I dont' know if you play basketball ,but it's kind of similar to a lay-up, so practice those to get the hang of it. And I know that high jump can be frusterating, there are days that I don't jump well, but sometimes it all comes together and I can jum 6'8....and most importantly, have fun, not everyone is going to be a great high jumper, but everyone can have fun with it.|`|8a9b18cfda4155409a011be661d9062eaa	keep practicing. you will get better. hope this helps. good luck.|`|4909f6c47584b258424324ed86d8da55aa	do a little weight lifting, like squat, or sit on your couch and with one leg jump as high as u can and do that like 10 times and do it every night|`|9zYEK7VRaa	be sure to arch your back, you'll go over easier, when you land you should end up almost looking like your doing a summersault (sp?)

1006dad6f03407c05ab75f0401d314dbaa	Initially I think Greise should start. He is a proven veteran and could teach the younger guys a thing or two.

AA11480683	it's weird man, this takes me back to when I was a kid, I had thought about would if there was such a game as KILLER FOOTBALL, I remember at the time i was a young lad and I had just saw ROLLERBALL and then I thought hey would if the football had long spikes on both ends and when you made a touchdown you had 30 seconds to get off the endzone before a bomb went off, stuff like that, crazy I know but who knows maybe someday. As far as your question goes I think a lot of fans especially now a days would be extremely pissed if the game was stopped, maybe 98%?????? They would't care if someone died, they want their moneys worth|`|06a2e512c17638eea5b84a9bdb57c04faa	First of all there are really only 3 true sports - mountain climbing, bull-fighting and auto racing, the rest are all games (according to Hemmingway) and I know that in auto racing they do carry on if the mess can be cleaned up in time - back in '94 when Senna died on the track they carried on and I think they finished the race a few years back when Greg Moore died during a race. <br>  <br>  Can't speak for the other pseudo-sports though - I would guess they would carry on time permitting. They're all big business and a shortened game means less revenues.|`|601018a316038e04c16aed9854183bf9aa	Umm no, out of respect I would think they wouldn't continue playing.  It is usually either rescheduled or it is determined a tie.  When a life is lost the winner of the game doesn't really matter anymore.  <br>  <br>  I don't know of any games where someone has died on the field, they usually have some problem and are taken away and then a news broadcast announces they died at the hospital or on the way to the hospital.

See any good movies lately? Guess what? It was fake too - get past it)<br>     Your question refers to the fact that aside from a very few characters (DX/Orton/J Hardy/Benoit/Mr Kennedy - maybe 2/3 more) the WWE has become geared for kids or the mentally handicapped. The WWE is a shell of it's former self cause whoever is really in charge cares nothing about putting out a quality wrestling product. They 've got their $ billions. I still cannot understand how they get these guys to go out there as these dumb-*** characters to say and do dumb-*** things they do. <br>     If you are a wrestling fan for a while maybe you remember WCW? Well these reasons and more are why WCW was  ahead of WWE in ratings for 80-some weeks.  <br>      If you haven't already seen it, and want to watch a good wrestling program, check out TNA Thursday nights on Spike (TNN, near USA on the cable guide usually)   They do it the right way and have new + established stars. Do the names Kurt Angle, Christian, Billy Gunn and Jesse James (New Age Outlaws from old DX) or Team 3-D/Dudley Boys or Sting ring any bells?<br>     Well even if not - check it out and not just for one show. try it for a few weeks straight and get to know some of these new guys.

TRsTJ8Sgaa	The reason they brought him in was almost entirely for the Shaq factor.  They came close to beating the Heat last year but had absolutely no answer for Shaq.  They had nobody with the size and defensive presence like Wallace and don't forget the great effort he did in denying Shaq a championship a few short years ago.  Yes Wallace is older but has never had serious injuries or prolonged injuries that would suggest a short career.  Transition years can be difficult and since the Bulls were already a really good defensive team all around last year, if not the best in most categories, some of those defensive stats  like rebounds and blocks are taken up by other teammates.<br>  And yes Krause was crazy to give up Brand!  How many all-star teams has Tyson been on.  And this is his first all around good year while Brand has had numerous.|`|HEKKJv6vaa	if you are not as intense as the coach..scott skiles..you are not going to be on this team...chandler and curry were too young...as for ben..new team, new style of play, he is a role player who has  to adapt to the different style of players he is playing with now..power forwards who take up his space down low..it will come around..bulls made no mistake signing him..as for chandler he putting up good #s but not for the bulls..brand..hmm how many allstar teams has he been on...chandler made a trip yet?|`|LBOQYOyVaa	I dunno... it got me thinking.

Curry. Chandler is a good defensive pressence, but Curry is a great low post threat. It would have balanced out their offense and made them a top tier team. Wallace is a good player, but the system is not ideal for his skills.|`|f52c1172dc9eea32d8c4ac2cca4be22daa	Some people when they have been on a team for so long must go to a new place to really develop.  This was the case for Tyson Chandler and Eddy Curry.  Granted they are having career years....they would not be doing this in Chicago.<br>  <br>  As for Ben Wallace....well thats what happens when you have a household name, people remember you for what you was, not what you have become....which is old lol....That contract was a horrible mistake.|`|HFgyL7Hmaa	from the looks of it, he is out of sorts... perhaps he doesn't fit well with the bulls' system? perhaps he needs a little bit more time to adjust and get familiar with his teammates?<br>  <br>  remember, he was the dominant center of the east and played for the pistons with an entirely different system, one that's built around a stifling defense....|`|efad8a43d6222fe648dbf9c73de1f162aa	Ben Wallace is the greatest centre on Earth, he has alot more experience then Tyson Chandler, and I believe thats why the Bulls bought him over.
sWXjOaZnaa	I applaud you for such comprehensive statistical data to prove your point,as with the question I think this team can defend and has shown that they can make some stops and actually play "D".They have a great and agile defender in Shawn Marion,an under the radar shot blocker in Amare plus with this team's speed they can get into the passing lane which can lead to steals and ultimately scoring opportunites.A lot of people look beyond the suns ability to the defend because of their high octane offense.Their way of play is to challenge other teams to outscore them,something that rarely happens thats why people tend to overlook the defense of the suns and perhaps everybody's forgotten why they traded Quentin Richardson for Kurt Thomas.It's because they had no person to guard other bigs in their conference,that is why they brought him in,to bolster their defence.This team,thier system has been built for offense and sharing the ball and for that reason people neglect and fail to see their ability to play excellent defense.|`|08fe913638e6eb694bf01bd3717062a7aa	Bad argument.<br>  If they played any kind of defense they wouldn't be ranked 25th overall in team defense, giving up 103 points per game.<br>  <br>  Regardless of their run and gun style, the only reason they're where they are is because they out score, not out defend their opponents. Seriously, they chuck up (24.1) and make (9.6) more 3 pointers (39.9%) than any other team in the league. When you're making so many 3 pointers and the other team is making 2's ..... you can pretty much win all the time.<br>  <br>  Just because your offense doesn't use most of the 24 second clock down the floor, doesn't mean your defense can't force the other teams offense into doing so. Suns have no and play no defense. Period, end of story.|`|Dm2UXfhLaa	Please.<br>  <br>  Nash did not create All-stars.<br>  <br>  Marion was already an All-Star before Nash came in. Amare was the Rookie of the Year before Nash came in.<br>  <br>  He gets the ball out to shooters for open jump shots, but hitting open shots hardly qualifies a person as a star. More like a solid role player.<br>  <br>  Joe Johnson left the Suns and became an All-star. Nash had nothing to do with him.<br>  <br>  As of now, Nash has 47 steals. Good for about...122nd in the league. He turns the ball over 3.8 times a game, making his steal/to ratio about .20, making him 394th in the league. That's some evidence how Nash doesn't play defense. <br>  <br>  I think you give Nash a little too much credit. He's a good player, but get your facts straight.|`|b71073e7826de2c958bec5363eb2a465aa	the suns dont defend what about the daughters|`|f2fbb3a02107b698c939a7a19fb6d10daa	I agree with you until you got to the part where you said Nash deserves MVP if he was so good then his team should have the best record in the leauge! Look at the Mavs (holder of the best record in the leauge) the MVP should be Dirk and will be Dirk but other than that i have to agree but the Mavericks also have better Defense than the Suns too!|`|5cb7f33712dcb55d25a4c8c25cfcae3caa	ya i know. that's what they all say..."the suns have no d!". but i don't know, i think their pretty good. shawn marion is a good defender, amare blocks shots. but i think that they are more of an ofensive team...but hey! if they have no d, how come they have been the pacific champions 3 years in a row and were able to reach the conference finals?!...

Tiki Barber is a star player. L. Betts is a good player that has a good matchup, but it's not worth starting him over Tiki Barber.

So start Tiki Barber!|`|d31e5ca4d3aca06ec2364133c20df1daaa	Start Betts this week.This is a solid pick. Barber is getting pulled in the red zone. Barber has been a big bust so far this year.

This is what makes football interesting.<br>  <br>  When you have Barcelona v Real, Man Utd v Liverpool, Newcastle v Sunderland, Brazil v Argentina or England v Germany. You have matches that to most people are worth more than winning a War because thats exactly what it is - A warzone on that field for 90 minutes.<br>  <br>  No sport even comes close and this is the thing that the United States hasn't caught on to yet. To win in a major football tournament is for each fan like winning the lottery.|`|i2U9s4jcaa	this sport is so old and classic that everyone loves and enjoys it. Since it is so old many people understand the game and tactics and its just the greatest time when a team scores when goals are so rare. Of course I can obviously tell you that you are an AMERICAN . Everyone outside of the US is very interested in football. If I am wrong that you are not an AMERICAN, than I must be a horrible guesser. In the US it seems so boring because, well, hate to break it to you that all the great players move to the EPL (English Premier League) or even the second division in England. The skill there is very very high. MLS has very if not at all skill in their league except for some  like upcoming Beckham, or Freddy Adu. The thing is tho is that Adu has had meetings with Manchester United and other great teams in the UK. And Beckham was first starting in Manchester United so the skill in the US is very limited. Also if you havent noticed that a football game only has one time to pause, halftime. On tv, that means comercials which means $$$$. The problem is that theres only one break time for commercials so ur sports network wont get as much money as say putting a baseball or american football or basketball game on because there is more $$$ to earn and its shorter... So lets put it in perspective, less time more money or longer time less money.... WHAT DO YOU THINK?????<br>  Also people like the game because it shows the true skill and endurance of a player. Because teams only have 3 subs in a game  and usually use these subs around the 65 th minute or later. this means that players usually play for an hour straight. Well not really the transition of the ball lets them hav SOME rest time but they still have to have full on sprints half the game. And for 45 minutes they are not rehydrated with water. American football, baseball, and basketball have plenty of breaks so the score isnt about how much  endurance a team has or how good they are. Truthfully, skill is being CONSISTANT. I think personally. basket ball and even hockey have unlimited subs. Which means when you need some water ur out right then and there. The game is also huge because there is no real requirements to become a football player. You dont need to have overly huge muscles like baseball and american football, you NEED SPEED and endurance. You dont need to be 7 ft tall to play, basketball has alot of people that can either be very very very tall or can jump really really high. Im not sayin all basketball players are like that but majority are. Football is great and is known world wide!!! On the finals of the WORLD CUP I bet you 85% of people who could afford TVs in the world sat down and watched. When the World Series or whatever comes up, only people in the US are watcing. <br>  Also football isnt boring!!! watching transitions of playing isnt boring the boring thing i have to say is watchin a pitcher pitch bad or good pitches as the batter swings and misses. Or watching the defence line switch to the offense line and play. That is quite boring. SOCCER IS UNIVERSAL|`|e52001d228c1ef6c9756cbfef16c9377aa	soccer is the great game.....it is a chess match.....each team looking for an opening.  THe game may be slow sometimes but unlike american football and basketball there is no commerial breaks. If you are watching the MSL you may loose interest.|`|f30193c2e64bfb6773ec2b22c8676713aa	Not for anyone who likes lots of scoring, certainly.  The pace of the game is often deliberate, as one could say about baseball. Many Europeans think baseball is a terribly boring game but many others see the finer points.  In football with usually low scores, every goal is so critical.  Often 1-0 or 2-1 are the scorelines so each goal is fought over and cherished.  <br>  <br>  I think it's a wonderful game.|`|33862b331feb40bc5677bee4431a0284aa	AMERICANS, DON`T HAVE THE PATIENCE.EVERYTHING IS BUSINESS AND that`s why they like basket-n-ball,burger-ball and american fatball. Lots of breaks, lots of "tasty" commercials, hot dogs and coke,.....................etc.Now in soccer(football) you have to have patience, passion, knowledge and be in shape. It`s not only a sport it`s a tradition,a lifestyle and yes for some people a religion! I was born in Europe and i take a lot of pride in KING OF SPORTS which is soccer(football) or calcio or however you wanna call it!
C1UN0ZNqaa	The wrestler who played him was Steve Lombardi also more famously known as The Brooklyn Brawler. The wrestler you are thinking of is "Abe Knuckleball Schwartz, aka MVP: Most violent player. The latter was the WWF's attempt to capitalize on major league baseball's 1994 players' strike. The promotion was trying to say that while those other, so-called 'legitimate' sports were just out to steal money from the audience, the WWF was there solely for the fans."|`|AA12207048	Brooklyn Brawler|`|9e2a0d2b66abeb2cdb4c325545cd5903aa	i cant remember .............|`|NPWHuIsoaa	The Legend<br>  The Phenom<br>  The Deadman<br>  The Undertaker

I don't remember off hand, but I believe what i've read is he has the gap power of Matsui, but he won't put up the same dominant numbers he did in Japan|`|sfYxKk2Jaa	Well - he was a 40 home run hitter in Japan and I guarantee he doesn't do that here in the States.<br>  <br>  I expect him to put up around 20 home runs though and he will be a bargain wherever you get him.  He will be a solid option if you have an opening at 3B, just don't expect him to put up ARod-type numbers.
zjha18Xsaa	Piazza just isn't going to play nearly as much as people think...I would drop him and find someone else.  Drop him.<br>  <br>  Also, drop Lugo...Lopez is better.<br>  <br>  I think I would also drop Drew.  He has really only had a few healthy seasons...I just don't trust him to be healthy all season again.<br>  <br>  I think you are right...if you don't have solid SP's you need to hold on to you're relievers.  Thome and Teixeira are solid, Rolen should bounce back, and Shef will split time between 1st, RF, and DH but he will play everyday.|`|WXLuwxSiaa	If you you need to keep both these catchers I'm stumped,otherwise dump:Lugo ,Drew and Piazza|`|a1d22388d4c016e75cc4b2a7fd74c827aa	Jenks'''Ray''''Drew Suck's''''''''''|`|wx1tHdsCaa	CUT LUGO!!!|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	If it were me I would drop Drew...he has too big a history of injuries and with the big contract may not be properly motivated.  Lopez....I have to disagree with everyone who says Lopez is better than Lugo, check eachs career numbers and then consider that Lugo is hitting at the top of the Red Sox lineup (that means Big Papi and Ramirez hitting behind him) while Lopez is managed by Manny Acta who anyone who follows baseball closely knows isnt big on running (so the on category he could be real good at he might not get the opportunity) and no Soriano or Nick the Stick (injured yet again) to hit behind him, not much run producion (the other ctaegory he usually is good at). And Piazza would be my last choice....not sure he can adjust to AL pitching quick enough and there will be some good catchers available during your draft (think about guys like Martin...Barrett or even someone like Liard in Texas). After the draft you may want to move Jenks...his mechanics were horrendous at the end of last season and the White Sox decided they arent sure he wont have arm problems so they signed McDougal just in case.|`|26a69d0af5e49be523c550f517ec93e2aa	Okay, you obviously want to keep Tex, Thome, Rolen, and Sheff<br>  After this I would say keep Jenks, Ray, Piazza, and Lopez
IGLggE3daa	If I were your coach, I would have you start a long toss program to build throwing speed and accuracy.  Then we could see about an outfield position (depending on range and improvement in throwing).  First or second base are also possibilities.  <br>  <br>  Throwing is more a matter of body mechanics than actual strength.  After all, you are throwing a baseball, which only weighs 5 oz.<br>  <br>  Improper weight training programs can hurt your throwing ability, so be sure to talk to a coach before doing too much of that.  Do not use weighted balls!  They will slow down your arm speed and can ruin your rotator cuff (shoulder).  There is no upside, no matter what any well-intentioned so-called experts may say.<br>  <br>  If you have good coaches, they will also try to put you into a position where they think you have the best chance of developing to play at the next level.  That may not be the position where you are most comfortable now, or even where you could be a dominant player now.  <br>  <br>  Edit: You say you are playing Little League this year.  Definitely make sure that you check out who is ahead of you in high school, or on a travel team if high school ball is not big around where you are.  Concentrate on developing your throwing and try to slot into a position where there is a good chance you will have a shot at playing at the next level.  Most coaches will be glad to help you if you show coachability.  We really do like to see improvement and success for our players.<br>  <br>  Take a look at <a href="http://www.baseball-excellence.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.baseball-excellence.com/</a> .  They have the best approach I know of on the internet to teaching baseball.|`|92243b08ebde93f065e4e902b8e2a18aaa	left field; you don't need a terribly good arm and speed is of the essence.  I think you could be a standout player in left if you apply yourself.|`|94ac361fdff04f0ebdf4bbba89f6585faa	i am a good baseball player and the only positions you can play without a good arm are first base, and second base.|`|P8o37kNXaa	wait, your 15 and going to play little league, I don't see how this is possible........little league majors max age is 12........finally 6 feet 150 how skinny are you?? Pretty easily hit a homerun, maybe on a little league fence.|`|UZ39hyuxaa	I'm more concerned about your throwing arm. If you are lefthanded, the only real choice is first base.<br>  <br>  If you think you'll make the team as a hitter, first base will keep your fielding woes in check. If you have the range to play second base, try it out, but don't go further down the infield.<br>  <br>  Another alternative is being a catcher. It's a bit risky, but if you keep the ball in front of you, and can hit, your weak arm won't be an issue.|`|f33492b79df2800958e3c123aaef78b1aa	If I were coaching you I would see how you could go to your right at second base. If that would not be a position of value then first base. I prefer outfielders with arm strength and accuracy. Third, SS, and C requires that as well. Also you need to be timed from home to first, home to second, home to third, and for the cycle if inside the park. This too will help determine a better course for your game. A tip to help your arm strength and accuracy: do curls on both arms to get better tone. Then to practice accuracy, take a dozen balls to the OF and then set a bucket at second laying down. Practice one hopping the ball into the bucket like into a fielders glove. Then do the same thing to home but trying to get it in the bucket in two hops. This is something you can do without having anyone there with you. Good Luck and keep practicing.|`|mnAM9Iseaa	first base, no question|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	First Base is definately the spot for you.

ZepfzXdmaa	okay so i completely feel you.  i played select/travel soccer for like six years and then hurt my shoulder really badly so i had to take a season off.  Long story short i started playing lacrosse.  it was really frusterating my first season because our team was mixed with select and two first-timers.  after that season i feel in love with lacrosse.  i went back to soccer in the fall and i too was getting a bored with it.  im a ninth grader too so soccer and lacrosse are in the same season.  i have fallen in love with lacrosse and have thought hard and long about soccer.  i am going to try out for lacrosse but am going to continue playing soccer on a house league.  dont pick lacrosse over soccer or soccer over lacrosse.  trying something new is always good and continuing wat you love is good too.  so if you pick lacrosse and try something different and new, continue to play soccer just do it with a summer or house league so you wont be as bored with it and if you pick soccer play it for the love of the game and not because anybody said you had too.  i hope i helped you out!!<br>  <br>  ps. as for lacrosse sticks i would use a friends old one until youve made a team.  if you just want a stick DeBeer, Warrior, Brine, and STX are all good brands.  Wooden sticks are really hard and i dont recommend them.  if you have any more questions feel free to email me! stixchick19@yahoo.com|`|BS6KpEJaaa	My older sister was in your same exact position.

9fcb12c4def0911931b6a0574333942eaa	Results from last week.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Results:Dx lives<br>  By Noah Starr<br>  January 15, 2007<br>  <br>  In front of a fantastic crowd of WWE fans in Shreveport, La., Shawn Michaels proved that some legends just can’t be killed. In an incredible show of strength and determination, HBK got the best of Rated-RKO in a 2-on-1 Handicap Match in the name of his injured partner and best friend, Triple H.<br>  <br>  At New Year’s Revolution, DX faced Rated-RKO in a tag team match that sent The Game to a medical facility and eventually into surgery with a torn quadriceps tendon. This week, Edge & Randy Orton entered the ring and declared that they would put an end to DX once and for all. Orton threatened: “We’re not going to stop, Shawn Michaels, until you are down permanently!” The pair then dragged out a bloody “Hacksaw” Jim Duggan and let the Raw locker room know that if anyone else tried to interfere in their match, they would suffer the same fate. Edge then landed a ruthless Con-chair-to on Duggan, and later in the night, after Ric Flair vowed to support Michaels, he was rushed out of the arena in an ambulance presumably at the hands of Edge & Orton.<br>  <br>  Rated-RKO vowed to destroy Michaels and the DX legend in Shreveport -- the very town that hosted HBK’s first televised match -- but Michaels had other plans. After delivering Sweet Chin Music to Todd Grisham, an irate HBK stormed off. Minutes later, with Mr. McMahon’s help, Orton & Edge instructed arena security to confiscate any and all DX signs. Once the match began, Michaels put in a valiant effort against impossible odds. When Edge grabbed a pair of steel chairs the referee rang the bell. But nothing could stop HBK; armed with Triple H’s sledgehammer, the remaining member of DX seemed to be fueled by his emotions -- anger at the callousness of Edge & Orton, the pride of being back where his television sports-entertainment career began and care for his ailing best friend. Michaels pummeled Rated-RKO and sent a message in the form of a Con-chair-to to Orton’s skull – DX lives!   <br>  <br>  Earlier in the night, Jonathan Coachman announced that WWE Champion John Cena will face Umaga at the Royal Rumble with the WWE Championship on the line. With Mr. McMahon’s approval, Coachman allowed Umaga’s manager Armando Estrada to decide the type of match, and he chose a Last Man Standing match. The match has no rules, except to beat your opponent so severely that he is unable to answer to a 10 count. After signing an official contract, Cena wasted no time in attacking Umaga, even pummeling him with the steel ring steps before giving Estrada an FU right through a table.<br>  <br>  Throughout the night, Mr. McMahon waited to get his old friend Donald Trump on the phone. After reading a letter from Trump that panned last week’s Trump vs. Rosie match, the Chairman showed the Donald how he would have handled the Miss USA scandal (with the smoking hot Torrie Wilson playing the part of Miss USA). Before Mr. McMahon was able to act out the end of his scenario, Carlito entered the arena to save Torrie and inform the Chairman that he and his ideas were not cool. Mr. McMahon punished Carlito by pitting him against The Great Khali. After Khali floored Carlito, Mr. McMahon had just three words for him: “Now, that’s cool.”    <br>  <br>  Also on Raw, Intercontinental Champion Jeff Hardy teamed with Maria in a Mixed Tag Team Match against Johnny Nitro and Melina. The rivalry between Hardy and Nitro was only heightened at New Year’s Revolution when Jeff retained his gold in a thrilling Steel Cage Match; Hardy was victorious again on Raw, landing a perfect Swanton Bomb and pinning Nitro for the win.<br>  <br>  Speaking of victory, Ric Flair picked up his first one-on-one win against the talented youngster Kenny Dykstra. In vintage Flair style, the “Nature Boy” pinned the younger man with his feet on the ropes moments after Kenny had been admonished by the referee for the same infraction. Both Flair and Dykstra will compete in the 30-man Royal Rumble Match where their rivalry will no doubt continue.<br>  <br>  In other Raw action, WWE Women’s Champion Mickie James successfully defended her title against Victoria in a rematch of their New Year’s Revolution confrontation. Mickie even added insult to injury in the middle of the match by delivering a severe spanking to Victoria’s shapely behind.<br>  <br>  Chris Masters emerged from the locker room with a letter from Mr. McMahon stating that the Master Lock is officially still unbroken. The letter stated that when a soldier in Iraq broke the hold, it was only with outside assistance from JBL. Masters celebrated his inclusion in the Royal Rumble Match and vowed to take on any challenger in another Master Lock Challenge. Ron Simmons stepped up to the plate and was holding his own when Super Crazy attacked Masters, allowing Simmons to escape. Due to outside interference, however, the Master Lock is still officially unbroken.  <br>  <br>  Two powerful tag team competitors were on their own as JTG faced Shelton Benjamin in a singles match. Shad interfered while the referee was distracted with Charlie Haas, allowing JTG to pin Shelton and steal another Cryme Tyme-style victory.|`|loevlWIZaa	try WWE.com and/or www.prowrestling.com|`|0093382286e191b54fe019326d1aa456aa	www.gerweck.net<br>  <br>  This has all wrestling news.|`|aa19d2e055dd84a1bbdbb32717b8c214aa	MICKIE JAMES WOOPED VICTORIAS @$$!!!

I was killing everybody in a baseball custom league last year thanx to Ryan Howard, Reyes, Wright, & Beltran. Yeah, I had three of the Met studs on my team. Anyway, I was offered a "bogus" trade of (Sabathia & Blalock & Jason Lane FOR Howard & Kazmir), and I told the guy to get real. The other guy was the commish, and he locked me out, dumped all my players, and added all the studs to his team. Funny thing is, he still LOST, LOL! Loser! The only way to stay away from that is to make your own leagues, or stay in the public leagues. I was told that Yahoo! wants to make a rating system for managers where you vote whether the manager is honest/dishonest! I've ran leagues for 7 years now, and I've finished last in one and never cared, mostly b/c they're free. My friends & I play all the time, but if it involves any money, we play in our own league!<br>  <br>  It also irritates me when ppl don't watch over they're team after the draft & during the season. I hate inactive owners! 9 times out of 10 a terrible trade will be pending, but there's not enough veto votes b/c half the managers don't exist! That's my biggest problem with Yahoo! Fantasy.

Just accept the fact that some people aren't very good at the game and need to cheat to win.

Some dude invited me to join a league and I said sure and sure enough four of the teams in the league all sent their best players to his team and then never made a move again all year. He screwed me and a few other guys over, so I just quit paying attention and moved on.<br>  <br>  Since then I've only participated in my own league with my friends.

Km7z9SQoaa	I have the same problem as you.   I quit las year and have been coaching myself since.  I'm 11.  I also have my roundoff backhandspring backtuck.  I can only make it half way around to.  Everytime I try to do a full I get scared and don't do it.I think you should just practice.  That's how I learned my backtuck and layout.  That's the only advice I can give you, since I have the same problem.  Also I was wondering, I have a beam.  Do you have advice on how I can teach myself how to do a backhandspring on it.  I can already to a backwalkover on it.  Now I want to learn to do a backhandspring on it.|`|d2359ab4ecd6093abc8a4a670574eaa4aa	A tuck full or a layout full?  Hmm... sorry, just wondering.  :P<br>  <br>  Anyway, make sure you get enough height.  Set first before you twist.  What I mean by that is don't twist right off the floor.  A lot of people have that problem when they're first learning how to twist -- their body and their feet tend to already start the twist before they even finish the back handspring and take off for the flip.  Set first, arms above your head, and go up off of the ground before you start your twist.<br>  <br>  The half is a very good place to start.  It's easier to rotate the full when you have the general feel for it.  So try starting out with the half, then jumping the other half right after you land.  That way, you get the feel for it.  As you start feeling more comfortable and more confident with it, try pulling yourself around sooner and sooner.  Eventually you'll get the full all the way around.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is to be patient!  Keep at it, it'll only come if you work at it!  Best of luck!  ^.^|`|87d60e4aafaca3962ea40c5cf0eb2be0aa	WOW ok im only 11 but im on a level 6/7 team so i like just got my layout and ur onl a year older than me and u have ur half jeez ur good!!!!!!
n4rP1SXNaa	Kobe is so much better than t-mac. T-mac cant stay healthy for a year and he doesnt even put up stats in the same range as kobe. plus kobe has the rings.|`|d18a7c1a67198c269bf100c4f1e7500caa	kobe bryant simply becasue he has 3 rings and t-mac has none|`|b8ec72ca37bd23d7b831e5cc34b48776aa	Kobe, he averages more points about the same assists and rebounds for his career and he is injured less. He is usually on better teams. He is starting to prove he can do it without shaq now as well. I don't like him but I think he is the better player. By the way, mcgrady attempted more field goals than kobe, kobe was third and mcgrady second in attempts.|`|1d1755edfe8b941417a1c511c94cb654aa	t mac|`|507226b731da09ac860e3b08754dd06baa	kobe is so much better than T-mac...T-mac is a bum he is always hurt and cant score like he use to...and for all u kobe haters that say he is a ball hog he doesn't even shoot alot this year he passes the ball all the time...kobe is the best player in the league|`|cb0aa7ed03290e23a6dab3c8518ab4caaa	I love both, but I gotta say Kobe. I believe Kobe has a better defensive game that T-Mac.|`|0b33972919e0f93f7ef5787540af6bdbaa	T-mac by far!! Just because kobe's a ball hawg doesn't make him that good in my opinion.|`|2f0b352c31204690e3f47ef24aa849c3aa	kobe because averages alot more in points and assist and other things and plus he has been in the league longer|`|BqKlFu83aa	It's a toss up! Kobe will get done what ever it is! T- mac has been injury prone and isn't the T- mac he used to be, but still a very effective person. Overall and has the rings to back it up - Kobe-yashi. I'd take Carter over these two though!|`|Sn9tZRoHaa	I have to go with T-mac kobe is nothing but a ball hog|`|V0bhgH4eaa	They are both good, but Kobe is the best.

AA11286196	Funny,the guy who posted b4 me tries to sound like a real soccer fan,but the fact is,sure USA is good a Football,which the word actually means soccer,but anywayz. Mexico will win,no doubt. And as a Mexican-American,I like USA,but they're no match for Mexico.1 more thing,what's with the high scores,its usually around 1-2 goals the whole game,unless the team sucks real bad,haha.

Once more, Mexico stinks when they play in US soil.|`|HZ3QVYFvaa	U.S.A. 2 - Mexico 1<br>  <br>  USA is going to start to be actual competition to other teams around the world.|`|k4nIu8ghaa	It's just a friendly, yet the Mexican squad, & media here in the states are all hyped up as if this was an official FIFA game, even criticizing the US squad for not making much noise about it, that's because for the US boys there's nothing important at stake. If they lose (which they won't) it'll be no big deal, they'll still sleep good tonite. For Mexico & Hugo Sanchez, on the other hand, it'll be a disaster to lose "again" eventhough it's just a friendly. I wonder will the Mexican fans come down on Hugo the way they constantly did on La Volpe, if they lose? specially to a US squad with less experience players, compared to the "mighty" Mexican team, with all their re-patriated players. I predict USA 2 - MEX 1|`|AA11041009	USA 2, Mexico 0.  <br>  <br>  Mark one up for providence...|`|AA10713144	Mexico has never scored 3 goals on the US on US soil , in fact they haven't even scored a goal in 5 years on the US in America, lol-good luck with 3

They aren't nearly deep enough unfortunately.|`|d3a1040a053c8a125a3cec4c40c6343eaa	I only watch American football
n4rP1SXNaa	if you need offense you should definitely do it as Marcus Camby loses touches to Melo and AI but if you need blocks stick with Camby. They are about the same at rebounding. I would say accept the trade because Jefferson is the second scoring option for Celtics and their primary post player while Camby is the third option offensively.|`|hr1tHSJyaa	yes. Is this cards or what|`|AA11302827	Any chance to dump Camby is a good thing.<br>  <br>  He is the most injury prone player I have ever seen and I watch alot of this game.<br>  <br>  Pull the trigger.|`|d0bab771b454818815c59d4e5d35c898aa	Jefferson's production and minutes are dropping now that Pierce and West have returned, he is getting less looks at the basket.<br>  <br>  Camby is injury prone, but Childress has been out 3 times this year already with injuries of his own, so that isn't a strong argument either. Plus Childress is constantly fighting for minutes in the Hawks strong troupe of guard/forwards, including Joe-Joe, Josh Smith, and the two 1st round pick - Williamses.<br>  <br>  Keep Camby, unless Denver trades for a PF he is going to be their only true threat for points and rebounds on the low block.|`|fDfiMn5Naa	This would be a horrible trade unless you are desperate. Childress comes off the bench and get minimal fantasy points. Jefferson is a strong rebounder and scorer, but gets few assists, blocks, or steals. Camby is a very good rebounder, and gets many blocks and steals. basically this trade would be camby for jefferson, because you can find a better fantasy player than Childress in the free agency. If you think Camby is going to be injury prone in the second half of the season, then i guess go through with this trade, but camby was only hurt for a few games in the first half of the season, and jefferson's fantasy value might decline since pierce came back. I would either hold out for a better deal, or just decline and hope camby stays healthy because he is a top choice at center when he is healthy
3Hj5yMfIaa	Who cares.|`|B5DDAvQtaa	I think they should go defense frist round. Leon Washington isn't half bad. He averaged 4 yards a carry. They allowed an average of 130 rushing yards a game. I think DeMarcus Tyler would be a good choice at DT.|`|AA12064604	Irons|`|7e19a5f5d3fb6d047f7caa76c6032082aa	i think they may upgrade their pass rush with gaines adams or jamaal anderson then second round take puszluzny if possible the late rouund take garrett wolfe|`|AA11204785	They need a shutdown cornerback.  Their Running Backs are good enough.|`|AA11802214	Danny Wuerrfel|`|ZGD72DoKaa	I would select Marshawn Lynch their running game since Curtis Martin went down has suffered and Lynch would be another Reggie Bush|`|UF5WHWFZaa	Marshall Lynch grades out a little higher then Kenny Irons and he does have good hands which should mean a good replacement all around for Curtis Martin.<br>  <br>  The real question is at the number 25 spot if he will still be there, Green Bay and New York (Giants) may get him first if they don't trade up.<br>  <br>  Micheal Bush out a Louisville would be a good choice as well and not a stretch at No. 25.  I like him better than Irons.<br>  <br>  Kenny Irons would be a good second round choice if they miss on Lynch on Bush|`|fae2d0503626142709759cf720fa2359aa	well a few mock drafts have them going for a TE, i'm not a jets fan, so don't matter much to me, but i would think if a good back is still in the draft worth taking in the frist round then i would say yes most deff they need more of a consistant running game then they need a TE, but if there isn't a back that they can't wait for til the sec round i wouldn't dout them trading down not haveing a frist round pick taking one early sec adn getting another 3rd round pick as well, to have 2 sec and 3 thirds if not for a player

How's Your Stamina? If you're a pitcher, having a good variety of pitches is key.  I play right field because of my arm. It's good, no 2 ways about it. The scouts from different teams look from different things. Some teams need a good pitcher that can last a while.  Some look for a good arm. It depends on how good you are.

There are 30 teams with 25 players each, that is a total of 750 players.  The demographics have really changed through the globalization of the game.  Roughly half of the players in MLB today are from outside the US.  The Dominican Republic and Venezuela represent about 35% of the players.

Start with your back turned to the thrower and then have him start throwing balls.  When the ball gets about 1/4 to 1/2 way have him yell.  This will make you know to turn around and react quickly.  <br>  <br>  Another good exercise is to play pitch and catch with those tiny nerf balls.  They're really small and require soft hands.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I'd suggest getting four people to stand around you about 10 yards aways from you.  Then have them start throwing balls in a pattern (left to right, etc...) and try to catch the balls as fast as you can.<br>  <br>  These are some of the drills that I give to players and they seem to work really well.

He was suspended from being on the road for a few weeks to enforce wellness program after he was found in suspicious o drugs (probably steroids, but maybe not).  A week before his suspension was dropped, Test wrecks his camero into the back of a parked car.  The only reason I could see for him wrecking his car into a PARKED car is he was under the influence of something.  Maybe Vince just got sick of Test being a liability, and even though he was a major part of the ECW brand, he's expendable, and can serve as an example to others who might be juicing up, popping pills, or drinking heavily.<br>  <br>  This is just suspicion on my part.  I don't know the true reason he's fired, but I'm sure that was a factor at least.  Test was a talented big man who, if served with a big enough push, could've been something in the industry.  Look at his career up until DX took over WWF back in the day, he was top dog, but it was all shot down at a small drive-thru wedding chapel angle.|`|BtgWySWFaa	what in the hell vince is thinking ? he should release a poser like the miz not a good wrestler test|`|HFgyL7Hmaa	it's actually a mutual parting of ways. test was quoted as saying that he will continue to wrestle as long as it is still fun with him. apparently he reached a stage that it is no longer fun to do wrestling.<br>  <br>  he added that when paul heyman was at the helm of ecw, it's hardcore wrestling at the highest. when heyman went, so is ecw because heyman is ECW.<br>  <br>  he also mentioned the locker room politics. perhaps some of the more influential players got the better of him because test could no longer position himself.|`|dbd321fb08640ea557f8ffb4b79535efaa	That's a shock considering how close he was to winning the ECW Championship.

1fd98b747fcb94e6671ecf6d8630d56caa	Good offense and nice pick of Santana at No. 2. Lugo is a nice pick at 2B ... he should help out with the runs, singles and maybe some steals.<br>  <br>  I would be worried about your bullpen. Gordon is old, so is Jones and he probably won't finish the year as the closer and Wickman definitely won't. I would check the waiver wire for someone who might start at a No. 2 and then move into the closer role. Like Gonzalez of the Braves.|`|oDuKD9t5aa	8/10, the only thing wrong w/ you offense is Dunn, he strikes out alot and brings your average down. Good closers and good starters. If you can try to get D.Cabrera from the Orioles. He will get alot of K's this year.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|26a69d0af5e49be523c550f517ec93e2aa	Overall the team is pretty good, your league doesn't count AVG as a category and it does count walks, so Dunn is much better here than he is in a standard league.  Try to package Helton + Jones for a top notch 3B.  You might want to turn over your closer situation, Jones and Wickman will probably both either get hurt or lose their jobs by mid season.  Also, mid season look to move Gordon for a different good closer, because he will fade down the stretch.

4BuVGC2Gaa	Drop 3rd strike, if  there are less than 2 outs and 1st base is unoccupied the hitter may advance to first base if the catcher drops or misses the pitched ball, ie error on the catcher, or if there are 2 outs the batter can run to 1st base on a drop 3rd strike and be safe if he gets there before the ball. Either way if the catcher doesn't catch the ball or it hits the ground before it gets to the catcher the runner can advance on what would be a 3rd strike usually swinging.|`|03f30bd1a0f7c0bf1ca13710b67a8318aa	i agree with steve xcept there can be 2 outs and u will still be able to run if nobody is on first|`|AIgryp4Kaa	Yes, the catcher, Josh Paul, made the catch without the ball touching the ground. The umpire wasn't clear with his call. AJ shouldn't have gone to first base. The Angels probably would have won that game, going up 2-0 in the series. Doug Eddings is not popular here in southern California.|`|IGLggE3daa	First I will quote Official Baseball Rules (OBR) that cover the situation:<br>  "6.04 A batter has legally completed his time at bat when he is put out or becomes a runner."<br>  <br>  "6.05<br>  A batter is out when --<br>  ***<br>  (b) A third strike is legally caught by the catcher;<br>  Rule 6.05(b) Comment: “Legally caught” means in the catcher’s glove before the ball touches the ground. It is not legal if the ball lodges in his clothing or paraphernalia; or if it touches the umpire and is caught by the catcher on the rebound.<br>  If a foul-tip first strikes the catcher’s glove and then goes on through and is caught by both hands against his body or protector, before the ball touches the ground, it is a strike, and if third strike, batter is out. If smothered against his body or protector, it is a catch provided the ball struck the catcher’s glove or hand first.<br>  (c) A third strike is not caught by the catcher when first base is occupied before two are out; ***<br>  <br>  (j) After a third strike or after he hits a fair ball, he or first base is tagged before he touches first base; ***<br>  <br>  6.09<br>  The batter becomes a runner when --<br>  (a) He hits a fair ball;<br>  (b) The third strike called by the umpire is not caught, providing (1) first base is unoccupied, or (2) first base is occupied with two out;<br>  <br>  Rule 6.09(b) Comment: A batter who does not realize his situation on a third strike not caught, and who is not in the process of running to first base, shall be declared out once he leaves the dirt circle surrounding home plate."<br>  <br>  The comment to 6.09(b) was added after the 2005 season because of the play you are talking about, so it was not in effect at the time.<br>  <br>  In the case you are talking about, there were two out.  The catcher did not catch strike three.  The umpire called strike three, but did not call the batter out.  The batter then could advance to first base and the Angels needed another out.  They could get that out by retrieving the ball and tagging the batter/runner, or by throwing the batter/runner out at first, or by tagging any other runner who happened to be available for a force or tag out.  They did none of those things, so he was safe at first and the Sox half inning continued.<br>  <br>  Since the addition of the Comment to Rule 6.09(b), if the same situation came up again, he would be out because he left the dirt area on his way back to the dugout before running to first.<br>  <br>  The best thing for the defense, which is taught to most young catchers, is just to always tag the batter on strike three if there is a chance the umpire will rule that it was not caught.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.<br>  <br>  PS, it also helps to think of it as an uncaught third strike, rather than a dropped third strike, because that is how the rule is set up.<br>  <br>  Addition:  The replay did not show conclusively whether the ball was caught.  But even if it did, it would not be the first time an umpire made a mistake.  What was conclusive is that the umpire called strike three, but did not call the batter out.  The umpire is required not to give advice to the players about what actions they should take on the field, so they make their rulings and wait to see what the play is.  He did exactly what an umpire is supposed to do in the situation when he thought strike three was not caught.<br>  <br>  Hence, under the rules as they were at the time, Pierzynski was not out until he entered the dugout, or until the Angels tagged him or made the play on him at first base.<br>  <br>  Whether or not the umpire was wrong concerning whether he caught the ball, the catcher needed to be aware that the "out" call was not made and he needed to make the play.|`|c5mR8QONaa	You guys are pretty much right on with the rulings, but the BIG point of that whole play was that replays showed that the ball never hit the ground. It was caught by the catcher.|`|tTqJL0dTaa	The home plate umpire ruled that the ball hit the ground and nobody tagged hime out or threw to first.  Since he hadn't made it into the dugout yet, he took off to first.  They actually changed the rule now so that won't happen.  As soon as you leave the dirt area around home plate, you're out.

IGLggE3daa	A few small tips:<br>  <br>  1. The ball will almost always carry farther than you first think.  The only exceptions are a topspin line drive or if the wind is blowing in.<br>  <br>  2. Try to get an angle on the ball.  The hardest to judge are those coming straight at you.<br>  <br>  3. It is easier to come in than to go back for a ball, so cheat back a little.<br>  <br>  4. When going back for a ball, learn to catch them over the shoulder like a wide receiver.  You won't always do that if you get back in time, but it is a good way to recover if you have misjudged a ball.  That is a skill you should already have from playing infield.<br>  <br>  5. Watch where the pitch is.  An outside pitch will have a tendency to be hit to the opposite field and will tend to slice.  An inside pitch will be pulled more often and will tend to hook.  A high pitch will have more backspin and will "float" more.  A low pitch will usually not carry as far in the air because it will have less backspin.<br>  <br>  A ball hit with topspin will sink quickly and it is rare that you will have the chance to catch one of these in the outfield.<br>  <br>  These are tendencies and not hard and fast rules.<br>  <br>  6. No matter where the pitch is, a ball that is pulled will tend to hook and a ball hit to the opposite field will slice, usually.  You can think of this in another way: a ball hit to left will tend to drift farther left (towards the fielder's right) and a ball hit to right will tend to drift farther right (towards the fielder's left).  This is because of the rotation of the ball imparted by the contact with the bat.<br>  <br>  7. Practice.  If you have a friend who wants to practice, hit fungos for each other.  Besides just catching them, also practice by standing in your normal outfield position and pointing to where you think the ball will land.  That allows you to practice judging the ball without the distraction of executing the catch at the same time.<br>  <br>  After taking a bucket of balls that way, then go back to catching them.  Many players see an immediate improvement from that drill.<br>  <br>  If any of this helps, I am happy for you.  If it does not, then you'll have to try something else.|`|78e7e9c17b8334ec766297d516daab9aaa	First get a friend to hit fly balls to you for a while.  If that does not work then go to the eye doctor and you might have a focusing problem.|`|I2nYlUUHaa	Judging a fly ball is all FEEL.  Practice Practice Practice.  Also, stay focused and do not take pitches off when you are out there.    In high school ball trust your ears.  The metal bats seem to give you a better feel as to where the ball is going.  One last thing.  It is easier to come in for a ball then to go back for one.  So play a little deeper until you get more comfortable out there.|`|mdHKZF8Eaa	all you can really do is practice, take fly balls and try hard, sorry you can do|`|cKymXQYXaa	Here's a few tips for judging fly balls.<br>  <br>  First and foremost, your first step is always back. This is the biggest problem with young outfielders. They see a ball hit hard and low and charge in to try to make a great play. Then, two or three steps in you realize oh sh*t its over my head, and you're out of luck.<br>  <br>  Also, I agree with whoever said to get your eyes checked out. That can make a big difference.<br>  <br>  After a while, when you get the feel of the position, you'll be able to judge them fairly well, but remember that even professionals mess up and don't get discouraged.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Practice.   I have the same problem,  I am a Catcher/First Baseman,  but as a switch hitter I end up in the Outfield on occasion.   Its far more difficult to judge them out there because of the distance.    <br>  <br>  The way I solved it was to simply take as many fly balls as possible,  rather it be in a field or on the diamond.   Make sure they are hit to you,  rather than thrown,  because thrown balls tend to look the same.   Just keep practicing,  the more you see,  the better routes you will take,  the more you will get to.    Just give it time.|`|654e1035fdd77d4e22d79bc2c3c20351aa	OK all you got to remember is "First step back then step forward" that all ways works.
eU63OI31aa	why isn't this asked in baseball? baseball isn't really exciting its entertaining if you understand the game, but it does get riviting with men in scoring position or late in the game|`|AA11671587	IMO<br>  <br>  Fun to play, fun to watch LIVE, fun to watch HIGHLIGHTS, boring to watch on TV, boring to hear on RADIO<br>  <br>  when i play, it reminds me of my childhood. but when i watch, all i see are grown-up kids, not adults, playing baseball. <br>  <br>  when i hear about how much money the best players are making, i wonder is it too much? just because you have been labeled "best player in baseball now", do you deserve hundreds of millions of dollars?|`|1znkKYTWaa	Basball is just too freakin' slow.<br>  <br>  With the current game, before long they will have to use the seventh inning stretch to mow the grass.<br>  <br>  To solve this, I have determined that baseball would be much more fun to watch if there was a "shot clock".<br>  <br>  The pitcher MUST pitch the ball within 20 seconds. If the batter shows up... great. If he is not there... oh well. <br>  <br>  Next, how many times have you seen the batter motion to the umpire to stop the ENTIRE FREAKIN' GAME while he steps out of the batter's box to SPIT? Ummm... you would not need to spit nearly so often if you did not have four pounds of ballast in your cheeks. Now at the plate... "Rocky the Squirrel"....<br>  <br>  "Stop the game, everyone! Hold it right there, viewers at home! Rocky  needs to SPIT!<br>  <br>  The players also need to learn how to wear an athletic supporter. In one game there can be as many as 413 time consuming "adjustments". How often does that happen in hockey? Why the big dfference? For baseball's new rules, If you adjust, you get a penalty. Three minutes on the bench should give you time to adjust it sufficiently... out of view.<br>  <br>  These guys get paid mucho dinero. What do you suppose would happen if YOU showed up for work today and spent 74.6 percent of your time adjusting your crotch or spitting on the floor? Would would your performance review say? "He was a team player..."<br>  <br>  Criminy... lace up the skates. I bet there are LOTS of hockey players that can play baseball. How many baseball players can play hockey?<br>  <br>  <br>  Ooop. I guess I strayed from the original question...|`|654e1035fdd77d4e22d79bc2c3c20351aa	Because it is like Hockey it is firkin awesome!!!!|`|IGLggE3daa	I like baseball a lot, but baseball is rarely exciting.  It is interesting because of the strategy and tactics involved.  In an average baseball game, there are roughly  200-300 pitches.  Each pitch is selected, then the pitcher and catcher must execute the pitch, and the batter has to figure out what to do with the pitch.  Can he hit it?  Will it be a bunt.  WIll the runner steal? <br>  <br>  Each pitch is an episode in the game, so it keeps you thinking the whole game through.  In addition, there is no time limit, so it ain't over 'til the last out is made.<br>  <br>  It is better to watch in person rather than on TV.  And better yet to play or coach, because you get to participate in the game rather than just follow it.<br>  <br>  Since you ask this in the hockey section, you must want a comparison.  Well, they are two very different games requiring different skillsets and different temperaments to be successful at a high level.  You also need to be in a different frame of mind to enjoy a baseball game vs. a hockey game.<br>  <br>  I like them both, for different reasons.|`|f0ae872151117fd780248c80b4d530bdaa	Its the slowest game on earth there's more action watching grass grow. it shouldn't really be called a sport as most players just stand around for 3 hrs. not that exiting. and the league knew for years players have been using steroids and did nothing about it cause of all the great home run competition over the years.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  GO HABS GO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|UiwXlUWZaa	it isn't. it is slow and boring and the players are way overpaid and prima donas|`|e48c1b23fce4eccf9877aa1bc873804baa	It isn't.

0iQ94ukQaa	I like Digger and Bilas. Bilas is knowledgeable and manages to not let his Duke affiliation get in the way of his calling the game. I like Dickie V, but his constant praise for his "favorite" coaches can be somewhat annoying. Digger is ok. But he reminds everyone that he used to be a coach a little too much. Anytime someone on the broadcast disagrees with something he says, he trots out the phrase, "Well, when I was coaching..." Vitale and Bilas are my favorites though.

adr4KgIfaa	Its Free-running, Pretty much jumping over stuff, down stuff or Flips off stuff<br>  <br>  Parkour is a physical activity that is difficult to categorize. It is definitely not an extreme sport, but an art that resembles martial arts. However, most traceurs are content to simply put parkour in its own category: "parkour is parkour".<br>  <br>  The most characteristic aspect of parkour is efficiency. The basic meaning of this is that a traceur must not merely move as fast as they can, but move in a way that is the least energy-consuming and simultaneously the most direct. In addition, since parkour's unofficial motto is être et durer (to be and to last), efficiency also involves avoiding injuries, short and long-term.<br>  <br>  Type Parkour into youtube - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUksaD-JJgI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUksaD-JJ...</a><br>  <br>  or go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour</a><br>  <br>  for a better idea on Parkour|`|02409713f3d8682c4d3533f1442a8039aa	Parkour is the original French name for the relatively new sport also known as Free-jumping.  According to Parkour.net  'Parkour is an art to help you pass any obstacle. This art is developed by David Belle, inspired by his father.'  It's sort of a cross between an extreme sport and gymnastics(!) where people use big jumps to move as efficiently and quickly as possible, and can be practiced in urban or rural areas, which makes it a very accessable sport, since you don't need any specialist equipment either.  It looks powerful, but graceful at the same time, and is very impressive to watch.<br>  <br>  If you've seen Casino Royale, you've seen an example of Parkour - at the beginning, the chase sequence through the building site is one big load of free-jumping!<br>  <br>  For more info look here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour</a><br>  <br>  For more movies containing Parkour look here: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/keyword/parkour/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/keyword/parkour/</a>|`|a11569e41e0a1462c89daba0e0d91382aa	parkour or free running was discovered by david belle.he has 15  yrs of experience in it.he has acted in b13 and in lots of ads .sebastian foucan is also a good free runner.he has acted in casino royale. for details see wikipedia.you wont understand if i say.the best way to know about parkour is to go to youtube and search for parkour videos. i appreciate your interest in parkour.

It does NOT increase hand eye coordination, speed, smoother running, good hips, position knowledge, catching capability, field vision, and route running. Without those, strength would mean NOTHING. So that said, all this steroid frenzy, bashing of the people who do them and say they wouldn't be anywhere without them... Just shut up, like i said, they only increase strength, not skill.<br>  <br>  Now, to the point. No, steroids should NOT be made legal. You're in the NFL for a couple reasons, elite playing skills and dedication.<br>  You shouldn't need to have to take steroids to build up your strength. Building your strength without them shows how dedicated you are and shows you're going to work your butt off to get yourself better to benefit yourself AND your team. That builds MAJOR coach points and can easily get you a starting spot on your team, wether it be high school, college or pros.<br>  <br>  If you're taking roids, you're cheating to get stronger, it also shows you're not willing to take the time for your team, THAT meaning you shouldn't even be playing sports and should be kicked off the team.|`|4eIXUy4paa	Why would anyone consider making steroids legal?|`|AA12179372	No! Its takes the competitive part out of sports. There are many downfalls, and no benefits. And yes it is harmful and does cause family issues. Many people on steroids have had bad reactions and gone and killed themselves or od'ed. If you need steroids to play, why don't you just admit you have the talent of a 5 year old and stay out of sports. They are illegal for a reason, they will affect you in some negative affect.|`|AA10609313	The fact that so many athletes are using them does not justify the legalization.  If steroids and HGH become legal then leagues will be filled only with guys who can afford them.<br>  <br>  Watch it trickle down to little league.  Do you want your kid facing an 8 year old pitcher who is 6 feet tall 225 lbs?|`|dyBoy623aa	no|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	Absolutely not.  Even like what the NFL has done for this year namely anyone testing positive for steroids will not be in the Pro Bowl or be eligible for any post season awards.|`|DbB2yCJ7aa	Take a look at pro wrestling (however fake it may be) 40% of pro wrestlers die before the age of 45 and it is widely known that they use steroids and pain killers. That would be the outcome of football/basketball or sports as we know them. There would be a bunch of giants walking around (even bigger than todays giants) made almost completly of muscle. They would have heart problems and we would begin to see a trend of athletes dieing younger and younger due to heart problems mostly. Men are not supposed to die at that age when theya re in that good of shape. Steroids should in no way be made legal do to the horrendous outcome that would follow its inception.
adr4KgIfaa	Heres how to ollie<br>  To ollie, place your back foot so that the ball of your foot is on the tail of your skateboard. Place your front foot between the middle and front trucks of your skateboard. That’s where you want your feet to be right before ollying. If you find that it works better for you to have your feet shifted to other places on your skateboard, that’s fine.<br>  You can learn to ollie while standing stationary, or while your skateboard is rolling. Ollying while standing still works the same way as while rolling, but I think rolling ollies are easier than stationary ollies. If you would like to learn to ollie with your skateboard stationary, you can place your skateboard on some carpet or grass to keep it from rolling. If you prefer to learn to ollie while your skateboard is rolling, don’t go very fast at the start. Whichever way you learn to ollie, once you feel comfortable you should try to ollie the other way as well.<br>  <br>  When you are ready to ollie, bend your knees deeply. The more you bend your knees, the higher you will go.<br>  Slam your back foot down on the tail of your skateboard as hard as you can. At that moment, you want to also jump into the air, off of your back foot.<br>  <br>  As you jump into the air, your front foot needs to roll slightly inward, and with the outside of your foot, you want to guide the skateboard as it flies into the air. <br>  <br>  Level out land and roll away<br>  <br>  Imagineing yourself landing trick always helps in skateboarding for any trick becuase it builds self confidence<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|8ueW8pfOaa	stand with your knees bent and your back foot on the tail and your front foot on the middle of the board.then slam down on the tail and at the same time slide your foot up the griptape at a 45 degree angle.then once you are in the air slam down with both feet on the bolts.then just rollaway.you might want to try it stationary first.=)
AA12074189	There is no gurantee. It's really one of the saddest things ever. One of my best friends was one of the best quarterbacks in the country when we played on our high school football team. He had already commited to Florida, then in our state semifinals, he tore his Achilles tendon, and tore his ACL on the same play (it was scary to watch). Scholarship revoked, and he ended up having to go to community college cause he didnt have the money. Just work hard and try to stay injury free.|`|L5nNZx7Daa	There are no guarantees, especially in football.  All you can do is work hard, know your assignment, and stay in shape.  Go after it if you want it bad enough.|`|4627aed3d384c5365814d6a84c7bea3faa	Actually. If u are very good and stay healthy and away from injuries.

KA74uUGdaa	i play softball for my highschool team, and its supposed to help you hit the top of the ball. I mean the coaches loved it but i honestly think it didnt help. It just broke a couple of days ago, so it didnt even last two weeks. I mean it is an inexpensive cool way to hit, and you can make it seem like all different kinds of pitches, but it just want for me.|`|AkZQztZtaa	No|`|pfuU6BQWaa	I've practiced with this, and i thought it was really cool! I think it's a great tool because it can help you practice hitting at various speeds. And its easier to hit the top half of the ball, but you can still hit it anywhere. I really like it.|`|AA12131869	You like baseball? Coem to Anahiem CA and marry me.... i cant find girls here who truly love baseball!!<br>  <br>  Tony|`|RSFEYZowaa	Yes|`|XFbdWhBVaa	Yes.|`|f11d03cbf0b863e75120783fad1f63c1aa	Probably not.  It just depends on what kind of a hitter you are.  If you're going for power you want to hit the middle of the ball.  If you play softball and want to slap the ball then it is good for you.    Remember that if you hit the top half of the ball youre going to ground out more|`|x6RnzCwMaa	The zipline does teach you to hit the top half of the ball, but if your going to get a baseball aid, I would recomend the hit away only because it allows you to take more swings at a time and it is a good way to practice the same swing over and over again.

92cc3e06fa9a36ae5c02f6ba5ee3c7b7aa	it used to be this way a while back, like when jeff hardy came back, and the weeks leading up to wrestlemania and backlash, etc. but now things after the draft have quited down and people are on their respective brands. But this does make for crappy *** shows, because brands like SD have no top tier talent, so I'd like raw vs. sd interpromotional matches every week. I think that would boost ratings, but not much. nothing they do these days seems to boost ratings....|`|9sbGaeDRaa	The WWE is now about keeping the brands equally divided, I think Vince is stupid because doing this is actually hurting the ratings. If he has all superstars on the same shows more people will want to watch Smackdown or ECW. But I think the reason he continues the division of the brands is so if people might actually want to watch every show to see whats going on that show.

75fGnRzWaa	I wouldn't make the trade period, but if you had to, I'd definitely take Francouer over Byrnes, as F plays in a much better lineup and will have much better numbers at the end of the year.|`|bNlYFkB3aa	Idk, this trade looks ugly.. I guess it depends on who you're starting at SS before this trade.<br>  <br>  If it's anyone around this talent...<br>  <br>  Hanley Ramirez<br>  Jose Reyes<br>  Rafael Furcal<br>  Carlos Guillen<br>  Miguel Tejada<br>  <br>  anyone of this talent calibur, then no! Keep BELTRAN!!!|`|SPCyHAFLaa	If he made the original offer he was trying to make an equitable offer to meet needs on both sides.
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	You should make the deal. Hard to say if his current slump is something minor or not but the bottom line is he has no track record and Rollins has a very good established track record for being an elite fantasy SS. A.Ramirez is a great bat to add to your lineup and makes up for anything you lose dealing away Beltran (except SB...but he isnt exactly stealing a ton himself either) plus Francouer is a solid outfield addition (Byrnes is great when he is hot, when he isnt he is horrible) and Nady is okay as a bench player. See who you have to drop to make this deal and if you have to get rid of someone you dont want to part with revise the offer and just do a Ramirez, Rollins and Francouer for Hardy, Beltran and Green deal...that way you dont have to drop someone you dont want to cut (you could just eliminate one of the other guys if you really want Byrnes or Nady). Either way you end up with the better of the deal on risk alone....but i think Ramirez, Rollins and Francouer easily outproduce Beltran, hardy and green the rest of the season.|`|AA10613925	I would do it, in a heartbeat. Hardy is definiteyl this year's chris shelton. He is good, but he is not nearly good enough to keep up those kinds of numbers througout the season. You are getting Jeff Francoeur, who is pretty much a poor man's Carlos Beltran, minus steals. Then, you get Aramis Ramirez, who has been the best 3B in fantasy since Chipper Jones got DL'd, and A-Rod crashed back down to earth. Shawn Green has really not been as good as he has been in the past, and should be traded. ZThen, Rollins is just great, and is the 3rd best SS behind Reyes and Hanley Ramirez. FInally, Nady has been hot over the past 2 weeks, but he is going to cool off, and yo should trade him ASAP, once you get him. This trade is easy, and I would accept it.|`|0iMYQ3STaa	I like that deal for you, especially if you're losing patience with Hardy. He's always been a good talent, but no one predicted 50 homer power at any point. His hot streak is similar to that of Shelton putting up softball numbers last year, but Hardy's got talent and won't fall completely off the map.<br>  I think this trade should be Aramis, J-roll, Franc, and Byrnes for your three, because now you'll have to drop a guy to make it work. If Nady's better than your worst bench guy, (say for some reason you still have a guy like Cust hanging around) this is steal even. Beltran's good, but he's not as good as 4 quality players.|`|5b09f1eeb355a7dd0ff8b23e44f61062aa	ooooooo....take the deal.....you get a lot in return......green is injured for a long time (broken foot) and beltran and hardy are on a cold streak right now.....take the offer and run.....|`|AA11334723	Personally, I traded him for David Ortiz. But the deal that someone proposed you is great. Rollins is worth Hardy, Byrnes and Aramis are worth Beltran and your getting Francoeur and Nady. Got for it man.|`|hJmznzUgaa	Accept the trade! This is an amazing trade for you. JJ Hardy won't hit more than 30 HRs. I would trade him for Jimmy Rollins straight up at this point. Besides...<br>  Francouer, aramis ramirez, nady, and byrnes for beltran and shawn green(worthless) is the best trade offer you might ever receive|`|Ps5LFbTMaa	trade him to me....... i would personally hang on to him right now and wait and see at the mid way point then see what is out there
AA11095587	There are "unwritten rules" in baseball. The players police themselves. With some of the questions you have asked, the guilty player will be tried in a "kangroo court" where one player is the judge and the rest of the team will vote as if they were in a jury as to wheter the player committed a violation. The scenero would take place in a teams clubhouse and no one but the players own team would be allowed in the clubhouse. The player is usually docked a sum of money that would go into a pot where the players would use to on after a predetermined amount of time. This isn't an example where the kangaroo court would be used, but one where unwritten rules were violated: I remember a situation where a team A had a no-hitter going and they were up by 8 runs, so 8-0 and a player on team B bunted to reach base in the 9th inning. Team A manager was furious saying that this player simply bunted to break up the no-hitter and that the team had no chance of winning.|`|1oRJPoyZaa	i love playing ball when i was a kid we used 2 do all that stuff but is good to c how are the laws 4 that in major leage games|`|qTnpXnNIaa	arent these the things that make baseball americas greatest sport, this stuff has been around since before you or I and im sure it will be going on after we are dead and gone. i think if we want to preserve our national pastime we need to focus not on these trick plays but team chemistry and these me first major leaguers we see everywhere today.

OPwRovqdaa	Great Fued. <br>  <br>  I remember watching their matches. All of them were incredible. Both very athletic people who can actually wrestle. Both were great WWE champions during their fued. I love how they started it all off with the Angle injury thing, and Lesnar being there helping him out and stuff. That fued, I believe, was the appitimization of Brock Lesnar's character. A massive, strong, and at some time phyco character. <br>  <br>  One of my favorites of all time. <br>  <br>  <br>  The funny thing is, they beat eachother up so much, and hurt eachothe rso much doing all of those edgy moves that you have to be very athletic to do, or else someone will get hurt. They executed them very well. If you havn't already heard, Brock Lesnar and Kurt Angle HATE eachother so much they are trying to schedule a MMA fight between the two to beat the snot out of eachother.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  (My favorite was Triple H vs.Mick Foley (Mankind, Dude Love, CACTUS JACK) I thought the matches were bore brutal, like the royal rumble street fight in 2000, or the 2000 No Way Out Hell in a Cell match where Foley was thrown off 2 times again, making his total 4 times of falling off of the top of the Hell in a Cell. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Top two fueds of all time are Triple H vs. Mick Foley, and Brock Lesnar Vs.

jQerQl0Eaa	Your team looks very, very solid.  The only position I see that could stand an upgrade is at 1B.  Young is having a career year in his 12th season.  Most players obviously don't have a career year 12 years in. To me, that means he is VERY likely to revert back to previous form at any time.  On top of that, he is not hitting for any power at all.  I would replace Young with Ryan Garko, Adam LaRoche, or Chris Duncan (in that order).  All 3 had a huge second half last year and all 3 are currently very hot.  One of them should be available in your league.<br>  <br>  You do have 1 other problem in that Hughes will be coming off of the DL soon.  I would drop Okajima to open up a spot for Hughes.  With Boston's trade for Gagne, Okajima's value dropped tremendously since Gagne will now be the one to get any save opportunities when Papelbon is not available.<br>  <br>  Here is a nice little trick when dealing with activating players from the DL.  Drop Okajima and pick up someone currently on the DL who might help you before the end of the season.  If for some reason Utley hit the waiver wire due to his injury, pick him up.  There are several other injured players likely on the waiver wire who could provide some depth later like Hank Blalock, Howie Kendrick, or maybe even Joel Zumaya.  Once you pick up the injured player, swap his position with Hughes.  You have now picked up a potential starter without losing anyone on your current roster that you weren't going to lose anyway.|`|0093382286e191b54fe019326d1aa456aa	I woudn't mess with it/=.|`|FeyO5GE9aa	I think you have a great team right now. Dmitri Young is having a career year, so I'm not sure if you were looking to upgrade at power for a decrease in average at first. I might consider getting rid of Kelly Johnson and adding another starter. I think you have a good team and I wouldn't make any moves, just wait for the playoffs.

Wenn du nach 5 Minuten bereits Probleme bekommst, solltest du das ganze vielleicht anders angehen. Bei Trainingsbeginnern sollte der Rythmus zwischen laufen und gehen noch kürzer sein, 2 Minuten laufen, 1 Minute gehen. Versuche es langsam zu beginnen und achte auf eine gleichm??ige Atmung. Weiter ist es wichtig nicht einfach los zu sprinten, sondern besonnen zu laufen unter Berücksichtigung des Pulses. Errechne deine aerobe Schwelle und versuche innerhalb der Werte zu bleiben, damit es einen Effekt hat.

Ich habe dann wirklich mal versucht, ganz langsam anzufangen. Aber wirklich so langsam, dass ich fast normal gelaufen bin, und dann hat es geklappt. Aber selbst wenn ich dann nach einer halben Stunde schneller werde, passiert es mir immer wieder, dass ich Seitenstechen bekomme. Ich habe schon alles versucht beim Atmen. Nase, Mund, mitz?hlen,...<br>  Ich bin ganz ehrlich, mir ist die Lust am joggen etwas vergangen, weil ich nie vorher sagen kann, ob ich ne Stunde schaffe, ohne Seitenstechen, oder ob ich nach 10 Minuten umdrehen kann. Und wenn ich es am Anfang mal habe, dann bekomm ich's immer wieder, wenn ich schneller werde (wie du ja auch schreibst).<br>  Ich habe mir jetzt angew?hnt, wenn ich outdoor-sport machen will, dann setz ich mich aufs rad und düs da ein paar kilometer runter. da wei? ich wenigstens, dass ich jetzt sport machen kann...<br>  viel spa? noch,|`|0a82861e72cd8dc81d47f7e03c03de76aa	falsche atmung|`|347ma3MVaa	Es ist nicht bewisen, woher seitenstiche kommen. entweder kommen sie vom falsch atmen oder von der erschütterung beim laufen. versuche beim n?chstenmal einfach gleichm??ig zu atmen und wenn du trotzdem seitenstiche bekommst versuchs mit langsamer laufen, aber bleib nicht direckt stehen. erst wenn das nicht hilft würde ich stehen bleiben.|`|3QZk6vT7aa	Entweder du hast kurz bevor du laufen gegangen bist gegessen, oder du atmest falsch.

ABoo1doVaa	The short version, the got shafted by the NCAA.<br>  <br>  The long version, two of their players were paid for work at a car dealership that they didn't perform. When Oklahoma's coaching staff found out, they threw their starting QB and a starting lineman off the team. The NCAA came in and told them they had to forfeit the games that the two played in in '05, because Oklahoma didn't keep a tight enough watch on their players. In D1 when you have 100+ players you can't watch them all the time. <br>  I could care less about OU, but seems to me the punishment didn't fit the crime.|`|1469145fbc54553729532a83a0ba1985aa	Two of their players were paid by local businesses, making them nearly professional players making them illegal in college sports. <br>  <br>  They really lucked out though. All they had was their 2005 season taken away. They could have had their eligibility taken away for the 2007 bowl games!|`|AA11090061	2 players were payed by a car dealership for jobs they never had to show up to work for...<br>  <br>  <br>  Their 2005 season is worthless now (harmless) and they lose 2 scholarhips for 3 years.

DbB2yCJ7aa	Well being an OSU fan first and a big 10 fan second (excluding Michigan unless it is in competition with other conferences) i would have to say Troy Smith. He knows how to play with good players, and with the way is draft stock is he will likely get taken at the end of round 2, 3, or 4. Meaning he could be on a good team backing up a good QB. If Troy Smith gets talent around him he will excel. I dont know how he will do with a mediocre team, but we should still remember that these guys are all pros and will probably still help him. Drew Stanton and Troy Smith both have amazing arms and can throw the ball a good ways. When both are practicing and in good shape they have great accuracy to help it. The best part of both is that they are athletes, and if needed they can move in the pocket and tuck it. They both have the potential to develope into very god starting QB's in the NFL within a few years.|`|AA12160701	Drew|`|65d0af556b239cc76cf131a750b1879daa	a lot of it depends on who drafts them. If they are placed in a system that suits their respective strenghts. If the teams player development dept. is any good, if they have a decent o-line, etc.,etc. when comparing the two as a Michigan fan I have seen plenty of both. I believe Stanton is the overall better athlete but Smith is miles ahead of him in intangibles like leadership, reading defenses, and whatnot. Stanton tends to crumble when the stakes are high.|`|HpSZbQaoaa	None? They will be backups their entire careers not really breaking out.|`|L5nNZx7Daa	Stanton is a better NFL QB.  Bigger, stronger arm, and not so reliant on his legs.  Stanton will lead a better career, but it still won't be all that great.|`|XP0a4cYQaa	I think Troy Smith will have a better career in the NFL. Before that horrible florida game he blew people were talking about him being a early first round draft pick. Just because of one game he messed up in doesn't mean people should think less of him. I think he will have a better career then Quinn and Russel. Stanton didn't show signs of NFL talent in his college years. To me i think he is just a overated College QB destine to be sent to the NFL europe. The truth Hurts.|`|ZhpyxTUaaa	Troy Smith, he can move and he can throw the ball better. He played in bigger games.|`|tNvnbVllaa	troy smith.
NMVXmuQzaa	But when Cena gets in this match with Lashley, he's gonna lose. I know what chu mean, man. The same with Ashley and Mickie. They always win. They have to lose a little to the heels once in a while. That is what spices up the story. It makes them more hungry for a victory and they always wrestle at the top of their game. Matt Hardy, no offense to his fans, but the dude is boring. Haven't watched none of his matches. Besides, he alway's win any way. I wanna see kristal, kick some *** and win. Victoria too. I don't know if it's new WWE story writers or something, but WWE better do something, and quick. Get some more divas, or something. For Cena's sake, thaey need to make him give up the title, because he's losing a lot of fans, not out of hate, but out of boredum. Just to get the fans coming back. Come back in a few months and collect your title back again.|`|0pLcEgU1aa	Its fun to watch. but every time i watch it i feel like im pysch and i know wat is going to happen. Two words! Fire McMahon!

kvk4kZ8qaa	December 24, 2004<br>  <br>  And in a historic move, the Red Sox named Varitek just the third team captain since 1923. Varitek was given the honour at a news conference on Friday to announce his signing. Only Carl Yastrzemski and Jim Rice have borne the title of captain in the last 81 years.|`|Trxn2gy8aa	Jim Rice was the last captain before Varitek. Evans never was named Captain of the team. There have been only 3 Captains of the Red Sox.....<br>  <br>  Jason Varitek (2005-present)<br>  Jim Rice (1985-1989)<br>  Carl Yastrzemski (1969-1983)|`|aee4rCEzaa	Good question. My off the cuff answer would have been either Yaz or Fisk.
XwlvPfhaaa	Wells = $180-$200<br>  Larry Dierker = about $50<br>  Greg Zaun = About $40|`|690f634819c851a9e8a40aa888cb095caa	Probably about $350 if it is an authentic baseball.|`|qTnpXnNIaa	just my educated guess but i would say about 50 bucks solely because you have Wells and Biggio on the ball, if each were on separate balls it would be higher maybe as much as 25 or 30 each for Wells and Biggio and 20 dollars each for Dierker and Zaun

You can also do on legged body squats. You do this with NO weights. Just do a regular squat on one leg, do 10-12 reps on the left leg, then do 10-12 reps with the right leg. Do about 4 sets. Lunges also work. There are a lot of exercises. But you do need to incorporate playing some ball with these excersises to weave in the motor skills because body control is also a factor.|`|ffNGq0lSaa	do more reps with less amout. instea of 10 sets of 150, do 20 sets 75 or 30 sets of 50|`|kxfBYslUaa	yes i play basketball and some of the things you can do is wall jumps when i was in school i did the box jumps and the fog leaps.  another thing you can do is put weights on you leg when you exercise

wqcbmNSmaa	Hola Kris, no se que este pasando pero espero que estas palabras te den animos y te hagan sentir mejor.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hoy Quiero regalarte...... Amistad, para que cuando tu alma a?ore un amigo , sin pensarlo busques, y ese alguien corra a tu lado. <br>  <br>  Sonrisas, para que cuando tus lágrimas escurran tras la cascada de tu mejilla en un día gris, sean las risas las que iluminen tus tristezas. Grandes sue?os, para que cuando en tu mente exista un vacío, sean aquellos bosques cubiertos de invierno los que atrapen la atención de tu pensamiento. <br>  <br>  La fuerza de unas manos, para que cuando tus tobillos se cansen, los hombros de alguien te sirvan de fuerza al andar. <br>  <br>  Un ramo de abrazos, para que cuando los tropiezos te dificulten el andar, sean los ánimos una esperanza que te ayuden a continuar. Una estrella joven, para que cada vez que el sol descanse, sea esa fiel luz la que te acompa?e. <br>  <br>  Un pedacito de humildad, para que cuando los éxitos engrandezcan tu persona, sea la sabiduría el aire mágico que te haga valorar lo que otros desprecian al llegar a una nueva orilla. <br>  <br>  Mi cari?o sincero, para que cuando sientas que nadie te acompa?a, recuerdes que en paisajes verdes o valles áridos mi pensamiento siempre te lleva de la mano. <br>  <br>  Un abrazo inmenso, para que cuando necesites sentir tus fuerzas sean éstos, el puerto de tus emociones. <br>  <br>  Un par de lágrimas, para que se alberguen entre tu alma y corazón; así, si en algún segundo la soberbia da?a tu andar, sea una muestra de sensibilidad ajena la que te ayude a no cometer injusticias. <br>  <br>  Hoy quiero desearte... que compartas tus alegrías con los seres que amas, para que cuando creas que caminas en la soledad, mil angelitos resguarden tu mirada. <br>  <br>  Hoy quiero obsequiarte... lo más bello que puedas recibir mientras transformas estas líneas en un espejo; donde la ternura que aquí encuentres y donde la belleza que aquí nazca, te de la certeza de que no estás sola . la alegría y la satisfacción de servir.<br>  <br>  saludos amiga.<br>  <br>  .|`|MxafgzLHaa	Buenooo.Yo tambien estoy depre porque me gustan cena y batista pero tampoco te pongas asi.Seguro que de ahora en adelante les irá mejor o por lo menos eso espero.<br>  Besitossss|`|av5NjZXZaa	Pues lo siento.salu2|`|gfWas5ycaa	Bueno, lo de Cena si fue un asco, pero esperemos que se arregle en raw de esta noche, yo pienso que a Cena lo protegen mucho en los ppv, asi que esperemos, lo de Batista, bueno eso si era predecible, no le iban a quitar el titulo tan rapido a ese gigante inutil, pero espero y confio que esten guardando el titulo nuevamente mara el Undertaker.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|iLMotelDaa	lo mismo digo.<br>  agregame: <br>  e-quijote@hotmail.com<br>  <br>  saludos|`|j666qTiJaa	^o)|`|TxqfkoeYaa	Por lo menos el público demostró lo que quiere a Cena, y lo de batista se podía esperar, pero a lo mejor la revancha es un punjabi prison match o un hell in a cell.<br>  <br>  Pero de todas formas hay que ver hoy raw, puede que hayan sorpresas, o eso me gustaría.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|B22Q1FRYaa	Saludos Kriss!!<br>  <br>  Te comprendo muy bien lo de Cena no tiene nombre o si pero no quiero ser demasiado despectivo en mis respuestas bueno habra que ver RAW hoy haber si ocurre algo.Respecto a lo de Batista se podia esperar y como ya dijo The Game se puede esperar la revancha en un Punjabi Prison Match.<br>  <br>  Suerte!!

1rlVjfxAaa	Investigando encontré esta historia:<br>  <br>  La historia de Nike es más casual que otra cosa. Todo comenzó con la pasión por el deporte que profesaba Phil Knight, un norteamericano vinculado a la Universidad de Oregon. El joven, recién licenciado en empresas, viajó a Japón a finales de los a?os 50 y consiguió una entrevista con la firma de zapatillas de deporte Tiger, de Onitsuka, una de las grandes del país nipón. Se hizo pasar por representante de una importante distribuidora de calzado americana interesada en comercializar su producto al otro lado del océano. En esa misma entrevista y fruto del apuro nació el nombre y la empresa germen de Nike: Blue Ribbon Sports. Blue Ribbon Sports consiguió vender las zapatillas japonesas Tiger en Oregon, donde se estableció su primera tienda.<br>  <br>  A mediados de los 60 BRS ya tenía ganancias considerables y Knight decide registrar un nuevo nombre para la empresa: NIKE, que significa victoria en griego y alude a la diosa griega Atenea Niké. Será por estos a?os cuando se una a la empresa un amigo de Phil K., entrenador en la Universidad de Oregon, Bill Bowerman, que será el encargado de los dise?os de zapatillas.<br>  <br>  Gracias por permitirme conocer esto contigo.|`|iQcePtCHaa	Viene de la diosa griega, hay una pelicula que te explica vien como nacion. perdona pero en este momento no me acuerdo el nombre pero esta buena|`|Oin9oQ6iaa	la palabra NIKE con acento en la E significa VICTORIA  en griego clásico., suerte en pila|`|wqcbmNSmaa	de una estatua localisada en la mano the la diosa Athenas<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Arts/Nike/Nike1C.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Arts/Nike/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Arts/Nike/Nike2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlahanas.de/Greeks/Arts/Nike/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://comenta-la-obra.blogspot.com/2005/12/templo-de-atenea-nike.html" rel="nofollow">http://comenta-la-obra.blogspot.com/2005...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.arqhys.com/contenidos/templo-athena.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.arqhys.com/contenidos/templo-...</a><br>  <br>  saludos<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.christiangrantham.com/blog/archives/nike021806.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.christiangrantham.com/blog/ar...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fossilizedcustoms.com/Athena.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.fossilizedcustoms.com/Athena....</a><br>  <br>  .

58a0547b180f824d46b4e6cf2f907dcaaa	Chiefs have done alright so far Signed Napolean Harris (see how that works) welcomed back Donnie Edwards from San Diego. Most important Trent Green is on his way out the door which is great for the Chiefs. If not for Damon Huard  KC would have been out of the playoff race by week 9 or 10 wisely Herman Edwards is making it a competition for the job. Green did not deserve to finish the season. No he shouldnt lose his job due to injury but it was very obvious after coming back he just didnt seem to be able to read defense and just made too many mistakes. Should  be a good season   unless your a SD fan they are gonna suck big time|`|7VoiHvXnaa	I agree with you.  Maybe with Bly there on opposite side of Bailey, they will FINALLY beat the colts!!!|`|b17d326fa3bdf4dc44d09f61d90ad780aa	Denver has definately done more talent grabbing (even though I have heard Bly does not want to play there & Stokley is a used to be)<br>  I have not heard much about the Chiefs except that they got back Donnie Edwards.<br>  The Raiders have sucked as usual.<br>  <br>  However, the Chargers have simply kept the great raw talent that will take them even further this year. Sure, the Bolts mixed the coaching team up, but its still basically the same offense and defense as last year. Perhaps a little addition by subtraction. <br>  I forsee the Donkeys and Chiefs giving the rest of the AFC a run for its money by the end of the season. The Raiders will find themselves where they belong, in the gutter.<br>  The Chargers will be the top dog in 2007-08!|`|Hv496AkOaa	The Broncos. They addressed every need in free agency accept defensive line, and the draft is loaded with D-Line talent. They're in great position|`|L5nNZx7Daa	The Broncos have also had a pretty rough offseason emotionally.  Two tragic deaths of young and upcoming players could dampen the mood.|`|TSEqHvS4aa	colts? try beating the chargers first.|`|2YpujXoGaa	Definately the Broncos so far. They have the best cornerback in the game who can effectively shut down the other teams best reciever and then added one of the most talented, but inconsistent cornerbacks in the game to start opposite Champ in Dre Bly. Then added the perfect running back for their type of run game and zone blocking scheme in Travis Henry. Hes gonna have a monster year - think pro bowl guaranteed. Also picked up a starting caliber Tight End in Grahan, and lost little to nothing. They have to be right up there with the Chargers depending on how Cutler plays.|`|tWNJXN0taa	In terms of adding talent, the Broncos have had the best offseason. Adding Bly is huge for their defense. I'm not as impressed with the Stokely of Henry signings though. Stokely's best days are behind him, and Denver could have plugged just about any HB in their system and produced a 1,000 yard rusher.<br>  <br>  However, the best offseason has to go to the Chargers. Not in terms of what they added, but rather what they kept. Re-signing Dielman was HUGE. Keeping the offensive line together that helped pave the way for a record setting season by LaDanian Tomlinson was critical to continuing the success the Chargers have had.

BEAST, SHAWNE, BEAST!|`|amOEo8ibaa	No i don't thing Merriman took the steroids with his own consent, and if he did then i don't think it will make a difference this coming year.  if u watch some of his videos on youtube you can see its 100% heart.  Like when merriman is 30 yards away form j.p. losman of the bills and he sprints his heart out to make the tackle on the otherside if the field.  plays like that indicate hes a natrual beast.

Talk to your coach, let him know you're in fact interested.<br>  <br>  Here are some things that your coach will probably look for.  Number one, know the offense.  The three people who need to know the offense down more than anyone else are the head coach, offensive coordinator and the QB.  The QB more than any other player needs to know what every player on that field is doing.(obviously it helps in any position)  From then on QBs need to be able to react the right way.  In high school ball protection is key.  Have crisp hand offs and know when to take a sack or throw the ball away.  Interceptions happen to everyone but coaches only get annoyed at the stupid interceptions, you know balls that should never have been thrown.<br>  <br>  Accuracy is probably the way you could show your coach you are a capable QB.  This is also one thing you'll be able to work on for the next couple of months.<br>  <br>  In High School learn how to read some of the more frequent coverages, Cover 0(man to man) Cover 2(2 deep, 2 in flats) Cover 3(3 Deep) and the increasing trend of the Tampa 2.  Though all regions are different so ask your coach what the teams in your division use the most.  Know where to throw the ball in these coverages and how to identify them.<br>  <br>  Finally footwork is probably the most undercoached aspect of QBs so make sure you know what your coach is looking for here.<br>  <br>  But in a nutshell, requirements? Come in with a great knowledge of the game, be of at lease average height, have at least an average arm and at least average speed.  Thats all you really "need"|`|tqm1aaKGaa	good grades, tall, dark and handsome, quick, and lean, smart.

Trust me, I've become the starting the wide reciever on my team, and I am the only white guy on the team, I missed try outs, I am kinda slow, not the tallest guy around, but I run real good routes, catch pretty well and work harder than anyone else on the team...

eEVSSVOtaa	SpaDes,<br>  Some leagues don't allow you to put a player on the DL. <br>  Tico,<br>  I would drop Iwamura. A-Rod is cooling off but still has another 30 HRs in him and 70 RBIs. BJ Upton is on fire, this kid can hit right now. I would drop Iwamura from your team for now or put him on the DL if possible. Marquis is on fire and I just recently added him too. Iwamura will sit on Waivers for a bit and if you want you can pick him back up right before he is due to come back. No one usually takes an injured player that is a Rookie off of Waivers until they are due back, or get back into a Groove. Marquis will help you right now, Iwamura will take up space, especially with Upton and A-Rod. You probably could even move Upton to a team with a weak 2B or 3B for a good pitcher. As long as he is hot he will be able to get you a good pitcher. A-Rod will come back and get you his Yearly Stats. Hell, you could even trade Upton with Marquis after you get him in a week, and keep Iwamura as your back-up til he's healthy. That is what I would do.|`|KrjgAJcDaa	BJ Upton is "real hott" right now. And so is A-Rod. I don't think you'd even play Iwamura if you have A-Rod.<br>  <br>  Also, can't you pick up Marquis anyways? You should have a free roster space since Iwamura is on your DL.|`|6d550bdc650cfbf9e37324ba115eb72eaa	I would keep him on DL. He is on fire right now.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  M

eEVSSVOtaa	Yes. Quinn will be a starting QB. The Browns are desperate and need someone to Win, and that is not Charlie Frye. They will compete for a job and Frye will have an edge becuase of his NFL Experience. If Quinn does not beat him out then, he will get his turn as a Starter, because we all know Frye is not the answer. Frye is nothing more then a decent back-up. Quinn will probably be starting after the first couple of games. He's too good to let him lay in waiting. I'm sure the Browns would like him to hold a clipboard and learn his first year, but like I said they are desperate. Don't expect him to go out there and have a Great year. He is young and is going to make mistakes. If they have him throwing short patterns he will perform well. Next year he will be the starter and a sure thing. He has too much potential to not be a good NFL QB. I expect him to look like Brady, because he was groomed by Weiss, but will not have the decision making and Play Maker Ability Brady has. I don't think he will have as good a Rookie Year as Jamarcus Russel though, because Russell can run and has a cannon for an arm. Russell will try to overthow it or throw it too hard though. Quinn is a solid guy and a good bet in an NFL Keeper League. Hoped this helped some.|`|26a69d0af5e49be523c550f517ec93e2aa	On a fantasy team, not this year, he doesn't have the weapons to be a matt leinart type story.

809649985f9497ce9420ca960348d02caa	It wont work out financially.<br>  Due to Minnesota and L.A. Lakers being over the cap, the 25% trade rule is invoked. Minnesota and L.A. Lakers have to be no more than 125% plus $100,000 of the salary given out for the trade to be possible, which did not happen here (only Minnesota met the condition). This trade does not satisfy the provisions of the Collective Bargaining Agreement.<br>  Even if it work out, Minnesota would be giving up too much.<br>  Also, you forget rule number 1 of management, never trade withing your conference.|`|6a0ac3439c718875d8529d339afa07c4aa	HECK YEAH because the lakers will have another domate player and they amost got in the secound round this year|`|CmCKs7qFaa	No it's never gonna work out Garnett would not be able to get along with Kobe Bryant he wouldn't be the leader of the team Kobe would take all the shots and KG would just stand their watching while his teammate scores and scores and scores.

But as the Lakers' 1st round defeat taught us, they could use some shaking-up on their roster.<br>  <br>  If they can get the Timberwolves to give them Garnett in exchange for Andrew and Lamar, then go ahead, if you feel like it. But if they're going to trade two players for one below-average player, then don't bother. Remember, the goal here is to reach the playoffs, or possibly to win a championship.|`|4vhJAiX0aa	Yes.<br>  But I doubt if the Wolves will agree to it. KG is a court leader with 20-20 (points-rebounds) capability. Odom & Bynum are not worth that much. Pau Gasol  of the Grizzlieswould be a better trade equivalent for the two.<br>  <br>  The Lakers will be better off retaining Odom and getting a dominant center like Okafur or Camby for Kwame, Bynum & Turiaf. Without a strong force in the middle, the triangle offense will not succeed.|`|ln4kpFIuaa	Yes, only if they want to win NOW.  However, they're in the west, they still wouldn't beat the spurs or the suns!
GU1o3sP0aa	WORLD SERIES<br>  <br>  *1960 World Series was played between the Pittsburgh Pirates (NL) and New York Yankees (AL). It is most notable for the Game 7, 9th-inning home run hit by Bill Mazeroski, winning the game for the Pirates 10-9, and also winning them their third Championship, their first since 1925. Bobby Richardson was named MVP of the Series, the only time that someone from the defeated team has been so honored.<br>  <br>  *1961 - World Series of baseball matched the New York Yankees (109-53) against the Cincinnati Reds (93-61), with the Yankees winning in 5 games to earn their 19th championship in the last 39 seasons. After the summer-long Roger Maris/Mickey Mantle pursuit of Babe Ruth's season home run record, the Series proved anti-climactic as the Yanks subdued the Reds easily.<br>  <br>  *1962 World Series matched the defending champion New York Yankees against the San Francisco Giants, who had won their first NL pennant since moving from New York in 1958, defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in a three-game playoff.<br>  <br>  *1963 World Series matched the two-time defending champion New York Yankees against the Los Angeles Dodgers, with the Dodgers sweeping the Series in four games to capture their second title in five years.<br>  <br>  *1964 World Series, the 56th playing for the championship of Major League Baseball, pitted the National League champion St. Louis Cardinals against the American League champion New York Yankees, with the Cardinals prevailing in seven games.<br>  <br>  *1965 World Series featured the National League champion Los Angeles Dodgers against the American League champion Minnesota Twins, who had won their first pennant since 1933 when the team was known as the Washington Senators. Both teams improved from 6th place finishes in 1964; the Twins won the A.L. pennant with relative ease while the Dodgers were locked in a season long 5 way battle in the N.L. between themselves, the Giants, Pirates, Reds, and Braves. The Dodgers used a 13 game September winning streak to clinch the pennant on the next to last day of the season over the 2nd place Giants. The Dodgers prevailed in 7 games to capture their second title in three years, and their third since moving to Los Angeles in 1958.<br>  <br>  *1966 World Series matched the Baltimore Orioles against the defending champion Los Angeles Dodgers, with the Orioles sweeping the Series in 4 games to capture the first championship in franchise history. Despite the general consensus that the Orioles were short of pitching when compared to the likes of Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax, Orioles pitching allowed only two runs in the entire series and ended up with a 0.50 team ERA, the second lowest in World Series history.<br>  <br>  *1967 World Series matched the St. Louis Cardinals against the Boston Red Sox, with the Cardinals winning in seven games for their second championship in four years and their eighth overall. The Series was played from October 4 to October 12 in Fenway Park and Busch Memorial Stadium.<br>  <br>  *1968 World Series featured the defending champion St. Louis Cardinals against the Detroit Tigers, with the Tigers winning in 7 games for their first championship since 1945, and the third in their history. <br>  <br>  *1969 World Series was played between the New York Mets and the Baltimore Orioles, with the Mets prevailing in 5 games to accomplish one of the greatest upsets in Series history, as that particular Orioles squad was (and still is by some baseball pundits) considered to be one of the finest ever. The World Series win earned the team the sobriquet "Miracle Mets."<br>  <br>  SUPERBOWL see: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sup...</a><br>  <br>  STANELY CUP see: <a href="http://www.nhl.com/cup/champs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhl.com/cup/champs.html</a><br>  <br>  OLYMPIC GAMES<br>  *1960 - Fifty-four years after Italy had to give up hosting the Olympics, Rome finally got its chance. They made the most of their dramatic history, holding the wrestling competition in the Basilica of Maxentius. Among the other ancient sites that were used were the Caracalla Baths (gymnastics) and the Arch of Constantine (finish of the marathon). Paul Elvstrom of Denmark won the gold medal in the single-handed dinghy class yachting - for the fourth consecutive time. Hungarian fencer Aladar Gerevich earned his sixth consecutive gold medal in the team sabre event. In canoeing, Sweden’s Gert Fredriksson won his sixth gold medal. Yugoslavia, which qualified for the final by winning a coin toss, won the football tournament after losing in the final three times in a row. Sante Gaiardoni of Italy became the only cyclist in Olympic history to win both the time trial and the match sprint events. By winning the silver medal in light-welterweight boxing, Clement "Ike" Quartey of Ghana became the first black African Olympic medalist. Five days later in the marathon, Abebe Bikila, running barefoot, outlasted Rhadi Ben Abdesselem of Morocco to become the first black African Olympic champion. Rafer Johnson and C.K. Yang were decathlon training partners at UCLA, but in Rome Johnson represented the United States and Yang represented Chinese Taipei. In a dramatic finish, they took first and second places and then, exhausted, fell against each other for support. Suffering from concussion and a broken collarbone after a fall in the endurance test of the three-day equestrian event, Bill Roycroft left his hospital bed to compete in the jumping test and ensure the gold medal for Australia.<br>  <br>  *1964 - The 1964 Tokyo Games were the first to be held in Asia. The Japanese expressed their successful reconstruction after World War II by choosing as the final torchbearer Yoshinori Sakai, who was born in Hiroshima the day that that city was destroyed by an atomic bomb. Judo and volleyball were introduced to the Olympic programme. American swimmer Don Schollander won four gold medals. Abebe Bikila of Ethiopia became the first repeat winner of the marathon - less than six weeks after having his appendix removed. Russian rower Vyacheslav Ivanov won the single sculls for the third time, and Australian swimmer Dawn Fraser won the 100m freestyle for the third time. Al Oerter of the United States did the same in the discus throw despite a cervical disc injury that forced him to wear a neck harness and torn rib cartilage incurred a week before the competition. Hungarian water polo player Dezso Gyarmati won his fifth medal in a row. Another Hungarian, Greco-Roman wrestler Imre Polyak, finally won a gold medal after finishing second in the same division at the previous three Olympics. By winning two medals of each kind, Larysa Latynina of the Ukraine brought her career medal total to an incredible 18. She is also one of only four athletes in any sport to win nine gold medals.<br>  <br>  *1968 - The choice of Mexico City to host the 1968 Olympics was a controversial one because of the city's high altitude, 2,300m, which meant that the air contained 30% less oxygen than at sea level. Sure enough, the rarefied air proved disastrous to many athletes competing in endurance events. On the other hand, the high altitude led to world records in all of the men’s races that were 400m or shorter, including both relays, and in the 400m hurdles, in the long jump and triple jump as well. Bob Beamon’s spectacular long jump of 8.90m would last as a world record for 22 years. The Mexico City Olympics, the first Summer Games to include sex testing for women, were blessed with many outstanding heroines. Mexican hurdler Enriqueta Basilio became the first woman to light the cauldron at the Opening Ceremony. Eulalia Rolinska of Poland, Gladys de Seminario of Peru and Nuria Ortiz of Mexico were the first women to compete in shooting. Wyomia Tyus of the United States became the first repeat winner of the 100m dash. The most popular female athlete of the 1968 Games was Vera Caslavska, the Czech gymnast. After the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia two months before the Olympics, Caslavska went into hiding for three weeks. She emerged to win four gold medals and two silvers. On the male side, Al Oerter of the United States won the discus throw for the fourth time. The 1968 Games also saw the first drug disqualification, as a Swedish entrant in the modern pentathlon, Hans-Gunnar Liljenwall, tested positive…for excessive alcohol.<br>  <br>  OTHER EVENTS<br>  *1968 - Jean-Claude Killy wins the Triple Crown of Alpine Skiing at the 1968 Winter Olympics.<br>  *1968 - the Open Era in tennis begins<br>  *1966 - England wins its first and only World Cup<br>  *1965 - The Imperial Cricket Conference becomes the International Cricket Council.<br>  *1965 - Bret Hanover wins the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers.<br>  *1964 - Cassius Clay, later known as Muhammad Ali, wins the World Heavyweight Boxing Championship<br>  *1963 - Craig Breedlove breaks through the 400 mph barrier in setting a new Land speed record<br>  *1963 - football Bundesliga formed in Germany<br>  *1962 - Rod Laver wins the men's Grand Slam in tennis (the real grandslam ie all 4 titles in calender year)<br>  *1961 - The World Figure Skating Championships are canceled after the entire United States team is killed in a plane crash<br>  *1960 - First Paralympics;<br>  *1960 -  USSR win first European Football Championship; *1960 - American Football League is formed.|`|x5u1Al4raa	Sorry I am in a harry, the death of all senior players of Manchester foot ball team in an airplane accident, the coming up of Mohamed Ali Clay, England won the foot ball cup  in England.

Dont get me wrong, Edge is an athlete, but the rocks combination of speed, size, and strength make him incredible in the ring. The Rock and Edge are both in my top 20 for best wrestlers of all time.|`|6defc03801c63f04501f702f6e9260c6aa	Okay, I like Edge, but I think the Rock won this battle.

UoT86gbiaa	You definitely need more in the bats, especially for power.  Delgado and Cabrera just can't carry a team by themselves.  <br>  <br>  Your OF is about as bad as it gets.  Bonds won't finish the season with even 30 HRs, and considering he still takes a ton of walks, his fantasy value is in the toilet.  Swisher is servicable, but is better as a back-up or fill-in.  Taveras is only OK as a SB specialist.<br>  <br>  You also desperately need closers, at least 2 more.  Hennessey is just taking over for SF, so he might be available in your league.  Capps is also taking the caboose in Pittsburgh, and maybe he can be had in free agency.<br>  <br>  Your starting pitching is fantastic.  That's decidedly your position of strength to deal from.  Try to find someone with 4 OFs but is short on arms.  You could get a big contributor.<br>  <br>  You also have 2 top 3Bs.  If you can't get any saves from a free agent, find out what you can get for Wright.|`|TE6Ba7Spaa	You need to work on your OF. <br>  <br>  Nick Swisher won't do it for you. You might want to trade Carlos Delgado for a solid OF.<br>  <br>  You need to keep Taveras because of speed.<br>  <br>  Put Todd Helton in for Delgado.<br>  <br>  Once Joe Mauer gets off the DL, get rid of Estrada for another decent pitcher. You might even find Boof Bonser on the waiver wire.<br>  <br>  Use Ted Lilly as trade bait while his stats look decent. <br>  <br>  Also, trade Tom Gorzelanny for another decent pitcher that will last.<br>  <br>  Trade either David Wright or Miguel Cabrera for a very good SS. Try to get Jose Reyes or Derek Jeter or Jimmy Rollins.<br>  <br>  Then put Hideki in at the Util spot.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|BeGG3Utbaa	That team actually looks good. Don't know what is going wrong. Good luck coming back.|`|VnAy62mTaa	Wow, no offense, but I can see why a team like this would be in second-to-last-place. This is one of the worst teams I've seen built up in a 12 team league. Plus, with the players that you already own, you've made great mistakes. Matt Cain is an excellent starter and so you should atleast for now start him over Roger Clemens. Roger is not having any action lately, he's only been pitching in the minors so he won't even count for any stat, lay him down on your Bench. <br>  <br>  Secondly, you should trade for much better players. Your offense is nowhere near decent, it's downright horrible. You don't have any speed so no stolen bases and there's no power on this te am except for Miguel Cabrera.<br>  <br>  Finally your pitching is another reason you should worry. Your crew will get you not many wins, since Roy Halladay is ALWAYS prone to injury, with your stable pitchers, a bad ERA, not many strikeouts, and here's the worst part: not one save. You need quality closers on a team and the only one you've got is Rafael Soriano? That won't get you anywhere.<br>  <br>  So until you fix your team up, you're not aiming for first place in this league and you're probably not even making the playoffs.|`|a20d04464bca9e167576f5def572aac1aa	Alright man....these bats are weak but not as bad as everyone is making them out to be. Your getting a decent amount of HR's from ALL your players rather than 1 guy who hits bombs all days. Thats what these kids are freaking out about. The bats you have are just starting to wake up. Example: Delgado and Wright.<br>  I can't wait for Mauer to get back he's on all my teams.<br>  <br>  Here's what you can do to improve:<br>  Batting:<br>  Your bench is good. Too good to be chillin on the bench. Trade away Helton and Matsui for a nasty outfielder. I'm assuming Taveras is only in there for the steals. You may even want to trade Wright for a nasty OF....than move Taveras to the UTIL spot. Think of your UTIL spot as a place to help a certain category that your losing in during the course of the week. If you wining in steals, play someone that hits for avg, etc..<br>  <br>  Pitching:<br>  Starters are good. Clemens will help you. It's actually a very good staff for a 12 team league. But you have ZERO closers. You must have like 7 Saves on the season so far. Trade one those pitchers like Verlander or Schlling for a decent closer like Izzy or Putz.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|sWy1XGfWaa	your team will come around but theres a few positions you obviously need to fix,( OF,RP)|`|0aRTae6eaa	its solid.....your startting pitching is amazing try dealing away gorzelanny and lilly becasue lincecum and verlander can start......and u need to play hideki over willy tavera and trade helton n peralta or phillips for a better ss/2b but its a solid team

Johnny Lee Clary<br>  <br>  World-Wide Evangelist<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The tragic deaths of Chris Benoit and his wife Nancy and son Daniel have shocked the wrestling world. The police are calling it a double-murder-suicide, but is it really? Let’s look at some facts. It has been 10 years exactly since Nancy divorced Kevin Sullivan to marry Chris Benoit. In the 1980’s Sullivan, along with his then-wife Nancy, were running a gimmick in wrestling of how they were Satanists, and Nancy was known as “The Fallen Angel.” She later became known as “Woman.” The trouble with the Satanists gimmick was it was for real, and was not a work, or fake. In the 1990’s Kevin Sullivan was the booker for WCW, and he scripted his wife Nancy into having an affair with Chris Benoit who was a member of the Four Horsemen. This made for a good angle, except, the acting became reality as Chris and Nancy actually fell in love and Nancy divorced Sullivan to marry Benoit.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Benoit left the WCW to go to work for the WWE which was then known as the WWF. It is a fact that Sullivan threatened Benoit and told him he would kill him. Yes, that was 10 years ago, but Kevin Sullivan is no dummy. He is known for being a calculating, cold-hearted individual. Today, according to a source close to me, Kevin Sullivan is a high ranking member of the Satanic Church. The police need to consider the possibility that Sullivan carried out these gruesome murders in order to have his revenge, which is what Satanists live for. He could have entered the home, with an accomplice or accomplices and held the Benoit’s at gunpoint, Sullivan could have then bound up Nancy, and made Benoit and his son watch as he strangled the life out of her. Then the next day after making Benoit and his son spend the day in agony, murdered Benoit’s little boy because of his hatred for the offspring of Benoit and Nancy. Then he could have made Benoit wait an entire day before killing him to by hanging him in the basement.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  By doing this, not only would Kevin Sullivan have lived out his Satanic Church creed with his lust for revenge, but he would have destroyed Chris Benoit’s reputation which is what has happened now as the wrestling world is attacking the memory of Chris Benoit remembering him as an insane baby killer and wife killer instead of the great World Champion wrestler and friend that he was.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Satanists hate the Bible and the police have stated that a Bible was found next to the bodies of Benoit’s wife and son. This would serve as a bizarre calling card as if to either say “What good did your Bible do you?” or to throw off investigators to keep them from suspecting Sullivan and his Satanists would have been involved.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Another thing to note is the fact that Kevin Sullivan was also associated with Sherri Martel, who died just a few days before the bodies of Chris Benoit, and his family was found, and the full details of Martell’s death have not been made known as of the time of this writing.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I wonder why the police have not even considered investigating the possibility the Kevin Sullivan killed Benoit, Nancy, and their child. It is certainly a possibility worth looking in to.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, Benoit was going to be crowned ECW World Champion on Sunday night. Why would he murder his family and kill himself when he was going to be on top again and make lots more money?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Why would he tie his wife up before killing her? He would have no reason to, but Kevin Sullivan sure would!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sure he had some problems with Nancy, but that was 4 years ago and what married couple doesn’t have problems? Remember also that they reconciled and as far as everyone knows there has been no other incidents reported.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  One also needs to consider the fact that Benoit loved his kids and was so proud of his son that was killed. His kids wore suits and ties to his wrestling events and was proud of their dad. He was loved and respected by all those who knew him.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, there is no way he would have murdered his family. This whole murder case has Satanists written all over it and Sullivan is a Satanist and has the motive to murder them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I am encouraging anyone who reads this to send this to police authorities and circulate it on the internet, so these facts can be investigated, before the case is closed and Benoit is written off in history a murderer. If Sullivan is the real killer, justice should be served!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As a former Pro Wrestler myself, now a born again Christian and world wide evangelist, I am hoping and praying for justice no matter who is responsible.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Rev.

AA11570437	yea, practice of course is needed<br>  but to make it really better, you got to have the comfortable "throwing" stance while you shoot the ball, and to have a more controlled follow-through while shooting, have a "follow-through finger" that should leave the ball last while shooting it.<br>  for example,  observe michael jordan while he's shooting, his follow-through finger is his index finger, and if youll look closely, his index finger leaves the ball last prior to launching the ball to midair...|`|LY2kDJbfaa	practice makes perfect, however perfect is unreachable. well just keep practicing you will get better with rhythm, timing, and comfort level.

D5xuT7bbaa	The whole trade was for Frye who they see as the perfect young pf/c to cover Aldridge and Oden.  He's a solid citizen, decent player and most importantly smart enough to accept the role to win.<br>  <br>  Without Francis and with LaFrentz off the books at the end of the year they will be able to pursue 1 perhaps 2 quality free agents to add oomph to their outstanding core of young guys.  If they can move Miles and Pryzbilla they will if not they may try to pay them out too.  Paul Allen is a very, very rich man and he is happy to spend as much money as it takes to win.<br>  <br>  I would say their next moves will be to extend Webster, Frye and Jack at the end of the year for the extra season for rookies.  Miles contract will finish the year after that and his exprining contract (about 35% of a cap) might be attractive to another team.  Pryz is a solid big man and his contract is in the low 20% of the cap so they might be able to trade him.  He has 3 more seasons left as of now.   A club desperate for frontcourt back-up strength may look at making a trade for him.|`|ae345652f667f856647a7e90ee32c6ccaa	Roster Space and Cap Space and I don't think the blazers likes the idea of Steve "I THE FRANCHISE" Francis hanging around with the young up and coming future stars.

Thats the only reason.  Next year (or this if they get antsy) they can unload Miles and Lafrentz then they have all the cap space for Aldridge, Roy and Oden. I think they are up to something though.  Dickau, JOnes, $30mil and Randolph for Frye the Blazers are up to something.|`|iREDESO4aa	They already have Jarret Jack at PG, and just drafted Taurean Green in the 2nd round to play backup PG a few weeks back.  They shipped off Zach Randolph and his huge deal and essentially got Channing Frye out of it.  This is great for the Blazers because they know how a HUGE and talented frontline- Oden, Lamarcus Aldridge, Channing Frye, and Josh McRoberts from Duke, who they also picked up in the draft.  I believe Pryzbylla and Magloire are there too, and they're trying to ship their contracts out as well before the season begins.  This team is definitely on the way up.

Also, it's funny that of all the guys on the Texan team, only one (T-Mac) is truly American (no, Duncan, the US Virgin Islands don't count).  Meanwhile, the Californian team is completely devoid of foreigners once you take Biedrins out.  <br>  <br>  Kind of interesting right?|`|IzuruMXPaa	Of course Texas!

There are alot of new pics of him in the August issue of WWE Magaine which display some of his new tattoos.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what they're going to do with Kane for Summerslam. Maybe they'll just put him in some sort of tag match or maybe a dark match. Since no one is feuding with him right now, I could see him involved in some sort of 6 or 8 man tag match.

nKV3RFX1aa	Yes, he should play!  The case is based on hearsay. The so-called eyewitnesses are themselves engaged in dog fighting. There is no evidence that put Vick at the scene of the alleged dog fights. There is only the "Cooperating Witnesses" (C.W.) that are making these claims against Vick. The "C.W." are all engaged in dog fighting. So, they are pointing the finger at Vick because he is the biggest fish in the pond. <br>  <br>  This case is about the mainstream media wanting to bring Vick down. They made him a Superstar and he did not behave the way they felt he should behave. Therefore, he must be punished. Of course, he aided them with his careless and reckless actions. However, he has not murdered any people.<br>  <br>  I am appauled that the media, the NFL, Nike, Reebok and the rest of the braindead public are calling for the end of his career. This is totally insane! I can't believe that we have become a country of ninnies. These are dogs, not humans. If he was engaged in dog fighting, it was wrong, but to make it out to be as though he was a serial killer is totally insane. What has become of our society? Are we that idiotic?  The rest of the world laughs at us because we are so superficial and ignorant. This is a public display of how shallow and insignificant we have become in the world. <br>  <br>  We are fighting a war in Iraq and CNN, FOX, MSNBC, and other major news outlets are talking about banishing this guy to the end of the world for dog fighting. Give me a break!<br>  <br>  At least one troop is killed a day in this war. Where is the outrage??  <br>  <br>  We are fighting the insurgents while the Iraqis are playing soccer. Where is the outrage?  <br>  <br>  We are fighting to help stablize Iraq while the Iraqi government goes on vacation for the entire month of August. Where is the freaking outrage???<br>  <br>  This is crazy! We ought to be ashamed of ourselves as nation to call for the end of a career over dog fighting. What is this case really about? Surely we can't be that shallow and superficial! I can't believe grown men are on the airwaves talking about reading an indictment about dogfighting "makes my stomach turn".....Get a clue and get a grip on reality!  IEDs are blowing up our troops on a daily basis...now that should make all of our stomachs turn!<br>  <br>  We are the laughing stock of the world. Come on, get it together and stop this madness! Halt the presses, leave Michael Vick alone! Enough is Enough!!!|`|99SNFVGgaa	The scandal itself will, and has, greatly damaged his career.

AA12243350	The .380 is considered to be the minimum caliber for defense against a human, although I think it is too light myself. But with the proper bullet, it does work. Some of the newer HP ammo from Hornady, speer etc all will work well at closer ranges. The only "advantages" to it, are small size, light weight, and very low recoil. But those don't outweigh the negatives to me.<br>  If I have to depend on something to save my life, or that of a loved one, I'm gonna stack the deck in my favor and carry the hardest hitting, Proven man stopper out there. That is why I still carry a compact pistol in .45acp. I carried it both on, and off duty. I've seen the results of shootings with most calibers, and the failures of many.<br>  shoot safe|`|HZvMciZ9aa	a 380 is basically the same caliber as a 38.  But 38 doesn't come in automatic, 380 does.   It is stronger than a .22, but even a .22 is a killing tool in trained hands.<br>  <br>  380 is easier to conceal than larger guns.<br>  <br>  It is lighter, which is better for women in particular, because it makes it easier to hold it steady and aim it true.<br>  <br>  Unless you are going up against crackheads, meth heads, pcp users, etc.  I would go with a 380.|`|8VrlRUfhaa	It was good enough for Bond, James Bond.|`|H4dswqRlaa	Randy is right about the 380ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol) cartridge (in whatever brand of gun it happens to be chambered in) being the minimum caliber to trust your life to, and that only at limited range, and preferably only as a backup. The "Smurf" models in 380 are imminently concealable, and small people find them just right in "surgeon-sized" hands. However, some 9mm models are also quite small, and with the lighter bullet weights have minimal recoil, so some folks who thought they might have been limited to a 380 on recoil basis, maybe should check that out to see what they could train up to in a few months of occasional practice. That said, I see listed in the Hornady Reloading Manual their 90 grain JHP with 3.4 grains of Titegroup powder in a Beretta 84F pistol with 3.88" barrel getting 1100 feet per second! That's 242 ft-lb of energy. Regular 357 magnum loads on the same footprint size only are twice that, and are fine for scoped pistol deer hunting out to 120 yards with good broadside hits. The point here is that with a properly loaded 380 used at close range, a two-tap (both lungs) will give an assailant something to consider in their remaining minutes. Or using the 100 grain FMJ roundnose in winter to penetrate heavy clothing, the two-tap technique gives them 15 minutes. That's over 4.4 grains of Power Pistol powder, 950 fps, 200 ft-lbs. Good luck is where preparation meets opportunity. Good luck in getting properly prepared. Regards, Larry.|`|95ePURHyaa	Yes, the .380 ACP has stopping power. If you shoot someone with it, they are going to go down. If they are on PCP, then they may not notice they have been shot, but otherwise this round has proven itself over and over as a manstopper.<br>  <br>  The .380 ACP is just slightly less powerful than a 9mm Parabullum round (while firing the same bullet), and the 9mm has been stopping men for about 100 years now. Most pistols that fire the .380 ACP are light and easy to conceal. <br>  <br>  If you find your self in a personal defense situation, a .380 ACP should be more than you need to fend off an attacker. It will not penetrate kevlar, and it won't stop a bear, but it will deter your average mugger just fine.|`|3y2G8wgjaa	Personally, I have my 'Drathers' as far as priority handguns.  However, the .380 is good for semi-adiquate stopping power and I would highly recomend it for someone who is small framed and has a hard time dealing with a 9MM or .40 S&W...or larger.  I have a .380 as a back-up and it is virtually much better than a .22, .25, or .32.  James Bond, 007, is a Charactor in a series of movies.  I think they use this caliber in these shows because of its easy concealment.  I wonder what Mr. Bond would use for back up?|`|AA12034449	.380 satisfies the first rule of a gunfight...always have a gun<br>  <br>  I'd hate to depend on a380 for more than contact to about 10 feet ... But the 380 has some history as a manatopper at short distance with good defensive ammo|`|dd1bce7bddbe2e3eb6a98a7a76a80171aa	ACP or Winchester? I wouldn't want to be hit by either.<br>  Oops. For some reason I was dislexic. My brain thought .308 while at the same time knowing that .380 was acp. <br>  <br>  OK. Let me actually try to help. The .380 is considered by some to be underpowered. I was just reading last night in my reloading manual that the .38 super was meant to give a solid boost to the round. It is the same size, but with more powder. The super is popular with competitive shooters who prefer less recoil than larger calibers. And with some hollow points it becomes an effective round for self defense. The only thing is that you need to use a gun designed to handle the higher pressures. <br>  But the .380 by itself? You have to take the pros with the cons. It is small, has little recoil, and is used in concealable sized weapons. But at the same time, it has mediocre performace. Some find the pros better than the cons.

3493d59b4e744663cb0f171ed6e344feaa	bueno, no soy espa?ola, pero igual te contesto;<br>  <br>  la verdad estoy esperando que la fia explique las causas exactas de porque fue esa sancion; me imagino que van a decir las evidencias que habia para sancionarlos; porque en realidad lo unico que se sabe es la sancion, pero no los fundamentos; y ahi habra que ver si habia que sancionar a los pilotos o no.<br>  lo que pasa creo es que si sancionaban a los pilotos iba a ser demasiado ya; yo creo que esta bien que los pilotos puedan seguir corriendo y no pierdan puntos;<br>  <br>  <br>  teniendo en cuenta lo que lei de la fia; cambio mi respuesta; deberian haber sancionado a los pilotos tambien; no quedan dudas|`|QKP9j002aa	Claro que no ofendes, por lo menos a mi. Es un punto de vista distinto al mio igual de respetable que el mio. Pero te explico mi punto de vista:<br>  <br>  Por que ha sido McLaren sancionada?<br>  Por infringir el articulo 151c del codigo internacional del deporte que dice esto:<br>  <br>  151. Incumplimiento de las reglas: cualquiera de las siguientes infracción, además de cualquier infracción previa cometida, será considerada incumplimiento de las reglas:<br>  c) Cualquier conducta fraudulenta, o cualquier acto perjudicial para los intereses de cualquier competición o para el interés de los deportes del motor en general.<br>  <br>  Y mi pregunta es: Que ha hecho Alonso para infringir esa regla? Alonso no ha perjudicado ningun interes del deporte y ha colaborado con la FIA cuando se lo han pedido. Quienes han espiado han sido Stepney y Coughlan y quien deberia de haberlo denunciado y no lo hizo fue Ron Dennis. Que culpa tiene Alonso? Alonso obedece ordenes por que es un trabajador mas de McLaren, un piloto pero trabajador y se debe a su escuderia. <br>  <br>  El auto no es ilegal, lo que es ilegal es espiar. El coche ha pasado por todos los test de la FIA para que pueda competir, siempre lo hacen antes de una carrera. En ningun articulo de la FIA dice que un coche es ilegal cuando ha habido espionaje por parte de la escuderia. Y si lo hay que me lo ense?en. Otra cosa es si moralmente nos parece adecuado o no pero Alonso no tiene la culpa de eso, el trabaja con el coche que le dan. El no es ingeniero ni ordena en McLaren. Si el patron de la escuderia permite que haya espionaje ni Alonso ni Lewis tienen la culpa.<br>  <br>  Y yo estaria muy orgulloso de que Alonso ganara este mundial. Ha tenido que luchar contra las injusticias de la FIA (le quitaron la pole injustamente en Hungria), ha aguantado que su escuderia se alegre mas por las victorias de su compa?ero que por las suyas, Ron no se ha portado bien con el cuando pidio perdon a la prensa britanica en Monaco por que Alonso gano etc etc... Y si con todo eso ganara me alegraria muchisimo aunque espero que para el proximo a?o se vaya de esa escuderia que espia y que da?a y desprecia la imagen de Alonso.<br>  <br>  Perdon por la respuesta tan grande jeje  que si no explico todo reviento jajaja|`|jtVaBxQzaa	Me gusta qué hables de Alonso campeón, creo qué Hami corre con la misma escudería,  ? él no es tramposo ?  ? el coche de Alonso no es el mismo qué el de Hamilton ??  pregunto humildemente..

Quando il battitore manca tre palline deve uscire. Una lancio perfetto del lanciatore si chiama strike se il battitore lo manca.

Se lo fa in un tratto, viene assegnato un fuoricampo (homerun) e ottiene due punti.|`|gt0eivBGaa	Il baseball viene giocato su un campo a forma di quarto di cerchio, suddiviso in territorio buono e in territorio foul. Nel territorio buono sono poste, su un quadrato di mt. 27,43 di lato, le "basi": i cuscini di 1^ 2^ e 3^ base ed un pentagono di gomma detto "casa base" o "piatto". A mt. 18,44 dalla casa base, sulla diagonale della 2^ base, è posta la pedana del lanciatore.Una partita si compone, normalmente, di 9 riprese o "innings". Ogni ripresa è suddivisa in due fasi, "battuta" o attacco e "difesa". Una ripresa termina quando una squadra si è alternata sia alla battuta sia alla difesa. Una fase ha termine quando tre giocatori dell'attacco vengono eliminati.<br>  Ogni squadra è formata da 9 giocatori più le riserve che assumono, quando la squadra è in difesa, le posizioni di: lanciatore, ricevitore, prima base, seconda base, terza base, interbase, esterno sinistro, esterno centro ed esterno destro.<br>  Solo la squadra che è alla battuta può segnare punti ed i suoi giocatori si presentano alla battuta uno per volta, secondo un ordine prestabilito, assumendo il nome di "battitori".<br>  Il battitore deve tentare di battere le palline lanciategli (dal lanciatore) che attraversano "l'area dello strike" o "area di battuta", cioè quallo spazio sopra la casa base compreso tra la linea delle ginocchia e la linea delle ascelle. Se le lascia passare o tenta di batterle senza riuscirsi, l'arbitro gli chiamerà uno strike. Dopo tre strike il battitore è eliminato.Sarà pure eliminato se la pallina da lui battuta verrà presa al volo o se verrà tirata da un difensore in 1^ base prima che lo stesso battitore raggiunga tale traguardo.<br>  Se la pallina lanciatagli non attraversa l'area dello strike, l'arbitro chiamerà un ball a suo favore; dopo 4 ball il battitore acquisisce di diritto la prima base.<br>  Riassumendo, compito del lanciatore è di ottenere o con tre strike o concedendo delle battute pessime, l'eliminazione dell'avversario. Compito del battitore è raggiungere salvo la prima base, o con una buona battuta o con una base per ball.<br>  Il battitore, non appena batte la pallina, o non appena guadagna la 1^ base per ball, diventa "corridore" e da questo momento costituisce, per la squadra in difesa, il principale pericolo, poichè egli può segnare un punto. Infatti, approffitando o di una battuta di qualche suo compagno di squadra, o degli errori dei difensori, o "rubando" le basi successive, tenterà di raggiungere (dopo aver toccato tutte le basi nell'ordine), il piatto di casa base dove segnerà un punto.La difesa può eliminare un corridore se riesce a toccarlo, mentre egli non è a contatto con una base, con la mano che tiene saldamente la pallina, oppure eliminandolo facendo arrivare la pallina al difensore a contatto con la base verso cui stà dirigendosi detto corridore, quando quest'ultimo è costretto ad andarci per liberare la base su cui si trova (gioco forzato).<br>  Se un battitore colpisce la pallina in maniera da mandarla al di là della recinzione esterna del campo corrispondente al territorio buono, ottiene un "fuori campo"; nel qual caso a diritto a compiere l'intero giro delle basi conquistando egli un punto più gli eventuali punti dei compagni che si trovavano sulle basi (non potendo la difesa recuperare la pallina per tentare di eliminarli).<br>  Vince la squadra che segna più punti in nove riprese.<br>  Nel Baseball non esiste il pareggio. Se dopo nove riprese il punteggio è in parità si continua ad oltranza, fino a quando non si termina un inning completo con una delle due squadre in vantaggio.<br>  A parte le partite delle squadre giovanili, nel Baseball non esiste limite di tempo. Mediamente una partita dura dalle due alle tre ore, arrivando anche alle quattro ore e mezzo.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ecco queste sono tutte le regole del baseball ^^|`|oHPILyEzaa	vai su www.yellowteambaseball.it avrai tutte le informazioni che cerchi!!!

So it will have a low kickpoint, meaning harder, more accuracy wrist shots, but not to the same extent as the xxxx, or xxx-lite.

AA11215068	The Equalizer handicap formula is a software program that is only available to APA League Operators and you cannot get a copy of it no matter how virtuous your intentions might be.<br>  <br>  In response to Joseph B.'s answer, "it just ain't so". The APA handicap system is just about as complex and fair as a system can be and the ability to manipulate (sandbag) the system is near impossible. Joseph is obviously a good pool player considering his skill level numbers, but the players that seem to be under-handicapped are a result of a few things. The player's score keeper probably fails to enter the correct number of innings and then number of safeties when they're shooting during the regular session. Additionally, the League Operator might not be as thorough at keeping up with their paperwork as they should as it relates to their data input for the system.<br>  <br>  A classic example is that our county is divided up into two franchises and some players play in both leagues. Some players are a skill level lower in one than the other. That's due in part to there not being a "centralized" system for the league. I understand that a change is on the way that will take into account any matches you play anytime and anywhere. That means that your skill level will be the same regardless of where you play.<br>  <br>  |`|jxrhBIr1aa	I don't think they give out the formula for calculating handicaps to the general public. If they did everyone would be underrated and the handicap system would be pointless because everyone would cheat the system. Trust me I was briefly on a team that tried to get me to go down to a skill level 3 or stay a 4,but I knew I was a skill level 5. I joined another team that let me play my own game instead of sandbagging. <br>  Basically if you don't want to go up,don't run out all the time and if you don't want to play defense,play 2 way shots. If you miss,you still leave your opponent hard although you were clearly going for the shot. Most scorekeepers would not catch it and could not mark it as defense. I'm not condoning sandbagging but there are ways to avoid going up.<br>  Plus the league operators put all the match information in a computer. There might not even be a formula since handicaps are determined by a computer program.|`|Iwtv6QyIaa	I do believe that information is privleged only to the league operator.  It isn in the computer program they use and nobody is allowed to know or lay eyes on it at all.  That is the way it is run in my area.  Only the league operator or a non member assistant may enter data or access any player information.  His wife died on the final day of our "City" tournements and he had to stay there till the bitter end because he was the only one who could access the info.  I felt soooooo bad for him that day.|`|c905a19f0c9c1bd695d4901d138120cdaa	I'm not an expert but I browsed this site and found this: <a href="http://www.poolplayers.com/equalizer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.poolplayers.com/equalizer.htm...</a><br>  <br>  Let me know if this helps.|`|KgvUC9bzaa	The person above me gave you the correct chart. Let me just explain a few subtleties as I have experienced them while playing APA. <br>  <br>  First, I've been to the NTC in Las Vegas. It was last summer and my team went for 9-ball. I was the co-captain of my team. My captain has been twice before for a total of three times. My skill level is 8. Everyone who had been before warned me that when we got there, everybody would be under-ranked. It was true.<br>  <br>  The thing to remember in APA pool is that there is no centralized skill level database. That's what makes the "equalizer" not so equal. When I got to Vegas, my team went 2 and out. In fact, I was the only player who won at all. Everybody and on my team, including me lost their first match, and everybody but me lost the 2nd. My first match our team was losing terribly so we just decided to put me up in hopes of saving a little face. It was a moot point. I was a 7 at that time and 7's must reach 55 balls. I got beat by a skill level 3. 25 to 37. <br>  <br>  My next match was against an 8. 55-65 race this time. The final score was 55-23. Now I am not a sandbagger by any stretch of the imagination. My team was already going to lost the first match when I got put up so why would I not go out and play my best to try and beat a 3. I got killed. We were losing again when it was my turn to play the 8, but I killed him. How is this equal? The short answer is it isn't. The only intangibles to take into consideration are consistency of your own game, and luck of the other person. Admittedly, I wasn't playing my best against the 3, and I was pretty on fire against the 8. But in an "equal" handicapping system, there should not be so much disparity between skill levels.<br>  <br>  Edit: Ok, Now I understand your question. Unfortunately, the only people who are privy to that information are APA Corporate officials. The operator of the league I play in is a pretty good friend of mine, and even he doesn't have this information. It's all computer based. The league operators just input the scores, and the software does the rest.|`|B2eGb9ZEaa	hckystar has it right and Joseph B just illustrated the APAs motto of "Anyone can win".

RS3fjNboaa	I agree with your assessments. Colt Mccoy is a passing threat only and the defense has too many problems for them to be ranked fourth.  Mack needs to make his changes immediately  and correct the problems if we are going to have any success this year. OU and Nebraska looked very good yesterday. You could be right. They may lose three games this year. Lets see how they do against TCU.|`|AA10180046	I hope they learn something from this game,and don't take their ranking for granted,just look what happen to the Wolverines|`|9gTMz4k8aa	Oklahoma is going to beat Texas like an old rug!|`|JsC3rThcaa	Yes Houston we have a problem scoring.|`|cb8d2f766180887e63ea4f1806c0b1b2aa	Hehehehe Yall have Colt McCoy and we have Stephen McGee or as Many people see him, Vince Jr. I mean A 65 yard rushing Touchdown ole Colt will never do. I mean he is made of Glass. We knocked the hell outta him and TU last year and we are gonna take him out for REAL this year. Get a real Texas Quarterback. I mean Texas Football needs real men, not just little girls from Austin. OU and TAMU are gonna DESTROY TU and it wont even be FUNNY. Well it will, but not For the TSIPS and the other BEVO lovers out there. We are gonna make taco meat outta him!.
BS6KpEJaaa	chargers over GB they are pissed and focused<br>  <br>  the guy below me said new orleans. NO WAY. They have absolutely no defense. they got smoked by TB and we all know how good they are...|`|HeFcizPlaa	New England<br>  Indianapolis<br>  San Diego<br>  Baltimore<br>  New Orleans|`|mc1exO7Qaa	New England at home against Buffalo.  I think the last time that New England lost at home to Buffalo was in 2000.  The last time buffalo beat New England period was back in 2003 in week 1.  That is the most confident I feel on any game that I had to pick this week.
eZsBPaRSaa	i wouldnt trust Ellsbury hes in a slump and Hart is playing good but not to good they are both in a slump but i would keep Hart<br>  <br>  Hart has more power and more rbi's opportunity batting 5 in the line up and Ellsbury is batting 9 or 8 if iim not mistaken<br>  <br>  <br>  Keep Hart|`|8a7cf145fbd0dc8e44c4f04987fc2fd6aa	Im not unloading Hart.Elsburry is a leadoff hitter.He is good for runs and steals.Hart hits deep in a great offense with more chances for all categories runs,rbi,sb,hr etc.Hart is a 5 tool player who is yet to have his breakout.No matter what Hart will be in a better position to put up fantasy stats.|`|bkJSIzHaaa	I would wait a couple of days and moniter both hart and ellsbury and see who does better over a cople of days if ellsbury looks like hes gunna turn it up at the end of the season again than do it if not than dont|`|htayiRsnaa	Dont trade.<br>  Hart is ranked 67 overall in fantasy baseball ellsbury is only ranked 118|`|qmyZZGFzaa	Cory Hart has been solid all year it is too late in the year now to take that kinda of chance on Ellsbury but keep him on your radar next year|`|AtbbOLXxaa	no i believe jacoby will come through again
23BITUqbaa	This is true.<br>  <br>  Perhaps, a team would allow him to play one play on a 10-day contract and the other team allow him the 2 or 3 yards and then he goes out of bounds.<br>  <br>  I've seen something like this before, but it was to a mentally challenged high school runningback.  The other team's coach told his team to not do anything and let the kid score.|`|ABoo1doVaa	No one is going to break that record. It's even hard to do on Madden.|`|BS6KpEJaaa	what if the moon was nuked and the radiation hurt the player and he decided to donate his life savings to the rabies foundation and then is attacked by the red army?? then what|`|K1NbbzECaa	Since he broke the record I believe so.<br>  <br>  And Emmitt really should call up all of those Hall of Fame quality Offensive Line men each day and thank them for allowing him to surpass a superior Running Back's rushing record, Walter Payton.<br>  <br>  Oh and he should kiss Barry Sander's buttocks for retiring early
8X3x34aXaa	I think they were truly outmatched. Maybe not in talent, but in devotion to winning. I'm not saying that the Rays didn't want to win, but this is the first year they were respectable. The Phillies have been continually getting better for years. They have the perfect team and they really just were more well rounded and on fire than any other team in baseball. I think the Rays could have beat any other team, but they were simply outmatched by the Phillies' ambition.|`|dQ99YWeoaa	The Rays were overmatched in most areas...<br>  <br>  The Rays' AND the Phillies' starting pitchers were both very good. Tough to compare the two.<br>  <br>  The Rays had an iffy bullpen...Balfour, Bradford, Howell...not exactly the most reliable. Price was great. But the Phillies bullpen has been on fire all season. They had the edge, by far.<br>  <br>  That empty spot in the Rays lineup (Upton, Pena, Longoria) hurt them a lot. The Phillies offense was incredible the entire series.<br>  <br>  Both team's defense was pretty good. I think it's tough to give one team the edge over the other in that area.|`|oKlD65njaa	Overmatched|`|TCehI17kaa	How about that the Phillies where just the better team?|`|0ceb8bb5d28e614b360992212b3419edaa	The Phils were a little hungrier.<br>  <br>  The Phillies have some excellent homegrown players.They were in the playoffs in '07 and were dispatched quickly, after steamrolling the Mets, who tripped over themselves, in '07. This season, with that notch of postseason experience under their belts, they were in the thick of things and won the division with their ambition and talent, which got them the WS trophy.<br>  <br>  The Rays were doormats for their first 10 years of existence. Through intelligent player development and transactions, the Rays were built into a power in the AL East with staying power. The Rays matured this year; this was evident by holding off the Red Sox. It's not like they backed into the playoffs by accident; they commanded throughout the year. Nonetheless, this group has no prior postseason experience as a team; no prior taste of coming close to a title like the Phillies.<br>  <br>  Both teams are built for the duration and will be at the top of their game for years to come. It wouldn't surprise me to see the Rays win the WS either this season or next.|`|VInxBVZZaa	just ran out of gas.  its unrealistic for upton, longoria, and pena to do what they did in the alcs, and its unrealistic for them to do as poorly as they did combined in the world series.  play that series again and you're going to get different results.  they might still lose but longorias not gonna go 1-20.  and they were definately overmatched by the phils bullpen.  price is their only outstanding reliever|`|tfG95ZGhaa	by the way, the phillies obviously don't suck, they just won the  WORLD SERIES "must be a Mets fan who said that".  I think it was a combination of all three things.  The Phillies bats were better, the pitching a bit better, and they were probably even in the field.  I am not taking anything away from the Rays, I actually think they have awesome potential, they just need more time to grow as a team.  Great year of baseball, can't wait till next season!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|vPpiHZSSaa	They weren't outmatched. Every game in the series was very close except game two. Could we just like move on though? To clear things up I don't think they ran out of gas at all. According to espn, they weren't in the right mind set. They said "We made it here, thats good enough". I don't think they cared for the outcome.|`|qTnpXnNIaa	the experts answered correctly even before the first pitch of the 2008 world series, Rays were just over matched all around, Longoria, and company (spare BJ Upton) left there best bats in tampa bay and the bull pen just couldnt match well Brad Lidge.|`|FNDC0NOnaa	Ran out of gas. We gave everything we had in the Boston series that went 7 and just lost our energy and drive after that. That was a huge accomplishement winning the ALCS and the weather didnt help us either.|`|Tmr7f3Xgaa	Usually when a team takes a quatum leap from one year to the next to get into the World Series they usually lose it. The Rays did fine this year. |`|aOsqICKraa	They got out-hit, out-pitched, and out-managed its that simple|`|oyXltJZpaa	They are just an unexperienced team!!|`|meNI6vuyaa	It was the pressure cause everyone knows that tampa had the series in the bag|`|V25THlPKaa	I think they ran out of gas.  They had just beaten the Red Sox in a very tough - physically and mentally- 7 game series.  The bull pen which was so good all year was not as good and the big bats did not show up.  Iwamura had 7 errors all year and had 3 (I think) in the WS.<br>  <br>  Going into the series, I thought the 2 teams were evenly matched and it could go either way.  The Phillies stepped up to the challenge and the Rays did not.
EFAJuvizaa	Brian Urlacher because Tennessee will run the ball alot in the game which would led to more tackle from the LB units of the Bears and Urlacher would benefit from it.

You will have to start buttering your ears to get though the door.Texas Tech played an outstanding game yesterday. They will have to get past TU. If they get cocky they will get their A$$ handed to them. Look at the past teams that were supposed to beat TU and failed. If and I say If they beat TU the worst thing they could do would be to underrate OSU. I know you are a hyped fan. I'm sure the Texas Tech players don't feel the same way you do. They realize that their season has just gotten a lot tougher with a lot more on the line. 
ghUm8M3laa	Watching that hapless player for Texas dropping the interception on the play right before the last touchdown.  How do you suppose he feels now knowing that if had just stepped up and played like a champion on that one play his team would still be number one?  That was awesome.|`|aCxK0PT4aa	The whole game.

0J5eyIe7aa	No, Drew brees will bounce back.. he was amazing lastg year you have to give him SOME credit. and now that mccalister is out that puts more pressure on him.. he will pull through. keep drew brees!!|`|055603dd45f468c2c3615eca53f799f9aa	You obviously didn't watch the game last night... NOO!|`|CmRH29zgaa	I'm nervous about Brees. He just doesn't look right, Deuce got hurt, and that team seems on the brink of imploding. And Roethlisberger is playing very well with a coach that is a lot more willing to throw the ball than the previous one.<br>  <br>  That said, Brees overall is the better QB, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  How is your team doing? If you are doing well, I guess I would stand pat. If you are struggling, Brees probably has more upside, so it might be a chance worth taking.<br>  <br>  Just a thought.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|69isqFDNaa	not even close, don't do it. brees is iffy this year, and roethlisberger is supposed to be SICK this season. he wont throw too many interceptions, and with a sick RB like parker and sick wr's like ward and santonio holmes, he'll have open receivers and will get you a lot of yards. dont trade away big ben.<br>  good luck|`|dbCgs8IGaa	Take Brees.  He will begin to come on after his bye week. Of course you will need help during the bye week.  Who is your backup?
23BITUqbaa	The guy above me doesn't know what he's talking about and obviously doesn't watch football.  The Indy D is good.  How can you not think so?<br>  <br>  Anyways, the good choice would be Galloway, so he's right on something.<br>  <br>  The defense for the Colts will have to decide whether to watch out for Earnest Graham, the newcomer, or Joey Galloway as a deep threat.  I can even see the Bucs beating the Colts if Indy isn't careful.|`|jXKqXMLAaa	I'd go with branch for the simple fact that hasselbeck is still a pretty good QB and that's his go to guy... plus they'll possibly be playing from behind and will resort to more of a pass game.|`|AA10034577	Galloway.  Indy D is...well...Indy D.|`|AA11566494	TB have a better chance of playing from behind not Seattle. but Seattle does have a better QB. It's a close one but i would go with Branch.

People do not argue if a quick clean kill is achieved.<br>  For is it keeps the numbers down as when they get into a chicken coup over night they kill the lot and may not even take one to eat.<br>  <br>  Andy C|`|I3CNklLKaa	Because it would be much better sport to set the hounds on people who ask ridiculous questions.|`|4BeKVZsPaa	hunting foxes isn't unfair and stupid. its only looked upon that way if you live in a city. you see this wonderful furry creature with a huge fluffy tail and want to cry every time you see one getting hurt.<br>  but if you live in the countryside, you see a fox in a whole new light.<br>  it is a murderous pest that will kill your livestock simply for the sheer hell of it. if it gets in a chicken run, it will kill every single chicken in there, even though it only wants one. it may even kill them just for fun.<br>  it will rip baby lambs limb from limb leaving blood and guts all over the place, it will pee on your crops killing them and will tear your cat to pieces if it could catch it. wonderful lovely creatures that they are. hunting them is a rural thing, it gives the horse sport, the hunters sport and the dogs sport. it clears the area of a murderous pest and lets you sleep without the screams of your small animals waking you as they get ripped apart by a malicious fox. there are more people in the cities and therefor, more votes. foxes have been given the okay to carry on their good deeds by the majority of city folk that think they are cute. maybe the farmers should get some recompense by dumping all their cowsh!t in t he cities, after all, it's only fertiliser isn't it?|`|oYf3jSq6aa	You're the one that thinks it's stupid<br>  Why don't you share your vast wealth of knowledge on the subject and show those of us that don't share your opinion the error of our ways<br>  <br>  Or you could just follow the example of the others here and attempt to propagate the myths and lies based on ignorance and PETA propaganda|`|SV4NxwROaa	I agree. If you have a fox problem, grab a rifle and fix it yourself.

It is not intended to be so.  If it were, you would hear about the hunters who were killed by a pack of foxes!<br>  <br>  Hunting foxes is simply a method of keeping the population in control, and them out of the hen house.<br>  <br>  There is nothing immoral about it.  <br>  <br>  It certainly is not 'stupid'.|`|DHIudHy2aa	A traditional english fox hunt is basically letting dogs go on a fox until it was too exhausted to run and would then be ripped to shreds by the dogs. I don't really agree with this as it isn't an ethical way to hunt, I would much rather just ethically shoot one when I see it then chase it all day and cause it to suffer.|`|VEoG1VCsaa	Brief explanation:  It isn't either.<br>  <br>  Advice:  Stop trying to incite argument from others due to your ignorance of the topic.<br>  <br>  Question:  This is the hunting section.

BS6KpEJaaa	definitely jacobs.<br>  <br>  For wynn, he was JUST named the #1 guy-meaning that he wont get ALL of the carries. look for him to split with Morency for at least this week. So I would not start Wynn.<br>  <br>  as for the other one i think you just have to look at the matchups and go from there.<br>  Based on matchups I think that you have to go with steven jackson. Its a fairly big risk because he still might not get a huge % of the carries and has not proven himself yet. however i think that he will be your best option. <br>  <br>  TB plays JAC<br>  <br>  STL plays CLE.

Good luck.|`|PEZmeuJuaa	Jackson against a bad Cleveland and Mr.Graham.....The Giants are going to throw all over the Fins...Wynn plays on an offense that doesn't run. So that leaves Graham who has stepped up bigtime and they will keep throwing his way because that is how Garcia is successful..short pass and dump plays.<br>  <br>  Jackson is the only for sure start here <br>  and i like Graham just because he fits the offense best of the other 3.|`|c0e14d7d647dbc349cc2802d5f42eaa3aa	Jacobs is indeed a no brainer. I would go with Wynn as your second back. The Packers will look to take advantage of the Broncos poor run defense while trying to avoid Farve interceptions at the same time.|`|vJIipAglaa	Brandon Jacobs is a definite starter and i would also start Steven Jackson. Its his first game back and he has something to prove, plus he is running on a terrible run defense. I have no faith in Green Bays running staff and Ernest Graham is good but how many more explosive games do you think he has left...

AA10719505	It was a no contest.|`|yVF3KA1Vaa	It was a no contest. Once the show went off the air due to Regal, he came out and announced that the match is over. As Orton was heading back up the ramp, Triple H came up behind him and threw him back in the ring and gave him the Pedigree. It have since been to the point that since this match was a no contest, Orton gets to fight another day with his rematch clause and he will use the Rematch Clause to fight Triple H in a Steel Cage at Judgement Day.<br>  <br>  They should make it Hell In A Cell instead because Steel Cage is too lame because you either win by Pinfall,Submission, or escape from the cage. Hell In A Cell only relys on a pinfall or submission.|`|SsPzyryhaa	It didn't count. After Regal's demands of ending the broadcast, Triple H made Orton tap out. Legally, Triple H won the title BUT now they have to face off at Judgment Day to make it real this time!<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Forget the part where Orton taps out. I didn't see the other answers.

AA11757375	7/10 maybe.<br>  <br>  You can never go wrong with the likes of Brees and LT. What really hurts you is your depth and wide receivers. Your bench is really weak. Chance of Forte or Graham making an impact is minimal, while Mason is more a of flex slot player. <br>  <br>  Besides Andre, you are really hurting at WR. Marshall has potential, but may be suspended for the first three games of the season.

gXUrEEshaa	Well, lets make sure you're getting the kick right first.<br>  1. Once you're under water, push down with your chest, letting your feet come up a bit. <br>  2.Whip your hips and thighs down, bringing your chest back up slightly.<br>  3. Allow the whip motion to continue through your feet, snapping them back.<br>  4. Start again.<br>  <br>  Now, the breathing problem might be a couple different things. <br>  -If you normally surface before you get to the flags above the water, then you might not be pushing off fast or hard enough. Work on your lung capacity so you can compensate.<br>  <br>  -If you normally surface at or farther than the flags, then it might be that you are blowing out your air too fast. Don't blow it out in time with your kicks like you might with freestyle kicking, you'll run out too fast. Just try and concentrate only on your kick a couple times, and then only on your breathing a couple times. Repeat, and eventually you'll be able to put the two together. <br>  <br>  Good luck, and happy swimming. |`|NMHmpBCzaa	okay you just need to not release so much air as you go along. keep it tight with arms up locking the ears in. its all in the motion of your hips, i had my coach explain it to me in the best way i can describe lol. he says its like your having sex, you gotta thrust those hips and get the whole motion that almost follows through from your hands to your feet in one big wave.|`|VLUv4hA0aa	It is an excellent tool in swimming and can definitely improve times, BUT when first getting conditioned to use the underwater dolphin, you should expect to be slower and winded.

KyKGQJiPaa	Hightower and LT|`|IuNbBWsRaa	Steve Slaton scored something like 70yds and 2 touchdowns the last time he played the Colts.  Given your choices, I would definitely start him.  Hightower is playing a troubled Seahawks team so I would give him some consideration although he didn't do too well in fantasy land last week.  LT would normally be a must start, but the Steelers run defense is top notch, and he is drastically underproductive this year.  If you wanna trust that his break out will come against the Steelers, start LT and Slaton.  If not,  I would go Slaton and Hightower.

Vlad and the rest of them didn't step up, and Boston pitched out of their minds.  <br>  <br>  They really have nothing they can do.  They can try to resign Texieria...although the price tag may be too high...and Mark is an east coast guy...so that is playing against them.  Maybe they can sign Giambi, let him grow the hair and goatie back, show the tats and pull up the sleeves...and maybe he will become a .350 hitter again like he was in Oakland.  <br>  <br>  There is nothing that team can really do.  Everyone is back.  They have Lackey, Santana, Saunders, Weaver and Garland all back.  Plus Escobar comes back.  They can only afford to sign either Tex or K-Rod, and personally, closers come and go...I would let K-Rod walk and put all my efforts into bringing Tex back.  <br>  <br>  Other than that...they really have nothing to replace.|`|Awfv7TV3aa	how about getting some guys that can bunt.<br>  you know Mike Scioscia is known to take risks and they usually pay off.

07a3beaf73716f65188fe5b9cc6968ffaa	Jets may have the best passing game in the league if Favre really is comfortable with that offense.  They needed their time to adjust and they got it.  Now they should be together.  Favre may pass for more than 40 TDs and will likely earn his 4th MVP.  He currently leads the league in TDs and passer rating.  If the Jets offense keeps that up (or improves on it), expect the Jets to win 11+ games with their extremely soft schedule.  That aggressive Jets defense, which has given up a lot of points is better than people think.  The team is on the positive side of the turnover ratio.  The Jets will probably go to the playoffs.<br>  <br>  The Jets are for real.<br>  <br>  The Dolphins are grasping at straws with this "wildcat" offense, and it will not last as other teams learn to defend against it.  It may have surprised a couple teams, but not for long.  They have a new coach and that usually means some time to rebuild.  No playoffs for Miami.<br>  <br>  The Dolphins are not for real.<br>  <br>  The Ravens have played well because of their defense.  I would not call it "ultimate", but it is good.  Flacco has played okay for a rookie.  I still think they should have given him a year to sit first.  Again, a new coach and rookie QB means that this team will have some time when they will struggle this year.  They may have looked good against weak teams, but it will not last.  The Ravens will not make the playoffs.<br>  <br>  The Ravens are not for real.<br>  <br>  -----Just because the "wildcat" offense of the Dolphins will not last doesn't mean it isn't fun to watch right now.  And it is always exciting to watch a rookie QB have some success like Baltimore.  Look at Atlanta and Matt Ryan.  They're doing well right now too.  Of course it helps to have the leading rusher in the league in Michael Turner.<br>  <br>  But the sad fact is that these teams usually do not finish strong in the end.  The Jets have something that the other teams do not have, experience.  They're coming together.  To call Favre overrated is foolish.  He leads the league in everything but yards.  When the season is over, Favre will still lead the league in TDs.  Get off the guy's back already.  He's one of the best and is a once-in-a-lifetime player.  Enjoy it while you can.

They're not going anywhere.<br>  <br>  The Ravens' "ultimate" defense always seems to disappear in crunch time aginst good teams.

Nle2XorTaa	Their is a number of things. 1. A little secret but the tip of were the pump would go into the the ball facing upwards.<br>  2. Lean back.<br>  3. Put as much as your foot under the ball depending on how high you want it to go.<br>  4. Before you hit it put the opposite foot of which kicking the ball of were your foot should go ( which is about an 1and a half inch away from the ball ). |`|99Te46cVaa	you need to put your foot a little bit behind  the ball and strike or kick it with your powerful foot.use inside foot for short passes and outside or up side like toe to kick fast and harder for long passes|`|aKPlFEgjaa	lean back and aim for the lower part of the ball.<br>  the lower you go the higher the ball with go but if you don't lean back enough you will chip the ball and it won't have any power.<br>  lean back too much you will end up on the ground or with an over powered kick.|`|292b6e70c064ba92c39108f65ad678fcaa	You must lean backwards when you hit the ball.

y5TTkgFYaa	Just contact Pechauer and they should be able to put one of their joints on one for you.  Predator sells blank shafts for that very reason.  And I'm sure that they will be able to help you out.|`|zFTSg47waa	I haven't done a lot of searching, but I don't think it's a common joint that a lot of stores will carry. You may want to try contacting Billiards Warehouse directly since they seem to offer other Pechauer cues with Predator shaft. Otherwise, you can always order a partial shaft from somewhere and have a cuemaker put the right joint on it, as long as they're familiar with 317 speed joint.|`|WxmNSxNGaa	Seyberts sells 314-2s with two different Pechauer joints. I don't know if either one is the one on your cue specifically though. I would suggest you call them directly and see what they can do. Worst case scenario, you'd have to mail them your cue, and they would custom fit a shaft to it, but I'd imagine they can fit that joint to a shaft without doing that, even if it's not listed online. <br>  <br>  Good luck. 
BGOsWzeraa	I am an avid snooker player/fan/obsessive. A new cue is definitely the right choice. A plastic tipped american pool cue is no good if your serious about snooker. Its a completely different game that requires much greater accuracy. I assume the size of the balls you are using are suited to the table? (2inch diameter balls on a 10ft table, 2&3/16inch on a 12ft table. -i think) i would reccomend a 10mm leather tip. 9mm may be a bit too small if you are used to U.S cues. 10mm is the standard for almost every person i know who plays the game, no matter what size snooker ball. as for the cue itself, just find one that feels good in your hands. With a good leather tip, it shouldnt matter too much what you buy. Blue diamond are the best tips! Hope that helped?|`|zFTSg47waa	It has to do more with the size of the balls rather than the table. Snooker balls are smaller, so snooker cues have smaller tips in order to more accurately apply spin. However, I have seen people use snooker cues with regular pool balls and vice versa, so if you're comfortable with it, I wouldn't bother investing in a snooker cue right away. There's not a lot of US manufacturers and you can get snooker cues pretty cheap (see link). Maybe you can borrow someone's snooker cue first and see if you like the smaller tip.<br>  <br>  EDIT @sir_bobless: Most American cues do have leather tips. The ones that don't are usually specialty jump and/or break cues. As far as tips go though, make sure the tip glues on and doesn't slip on or screw on. Some of the cues in the link even have Blue Diamond tips.
sHnt5vrmaa	Absolutely not. Your new cue shaft will be just fine without waxing it, nor is it a required process.  <br>  <br>  Don't use liquids or sand paper either!  <br>  <br>  The only safe liquid to apply to your shaft is rubbing alcohol. Apply the alcohol to a clean cloth first ---then to your cue shaft.<br>  <br>  Keep your hands clean! Wash your hands BEFORE handling your cue. Stay away from talc and hand-chalk too.<br>  <br>  Keep a clean dry towel with you while you're playing. Use it for your cue and for your hands.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your nice new cue shaft!<br>  <br>  LAG|`|1X8Kjdilaa	Don't wax it that will stuff up your shot when it does not slides along on your hand,All i do on a new pool cue is give it a light rub down with 1200 wet and dry sand paper to make it smoother witch makes it slide better on your hand<br>   I only use timber cues with a varnish finish
jxrhBIr1aa	If it's the same one in the website below and if it's in 90 to 99% condition,the cue is worth $800 to $1000.<br>  |`|wdrILdSpaa	I would say over 500. Meucci usually are expensive which I never understood because I have always felt they are overrated cues|`|c617fdca1c0b850eb041f25daedc9147aa	I'd say about  1,000 to 1,300 dollars.  That is a great brand of cue.<br>     But I favor Scorpion cues....lol

Same as saying that because some men rape women, all men are rapists.  You can't judge an entire group of people by the actions of some.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	Nah.  Some of the skateboarders I knew growing up were also the most respectful of their parents as well as accomplished students.  It's all in who people have an association with.  Lord knows I've met a fair share I'd like to have shoved down a flight of stairs but, to assume all skaters are punks is unfair.

There was a previous penalty that moved the ball to the 15.|`|fe1fb057c5c82b734b2027481e503befaa	It was 2 separate penalties, and it's sure nice seeing that whiner Mack Brown act like the total jerk he is.|`|9a9de1b5845ae3e59cbfc58aad1e97d8aa	Well Texas isn't LSU...LSU would've won the game with one second left..remember LSU vs Kentucky 2002?????  Texas looked like a bunch of idiots out there and Mack Brown was a total prick cuz he lost...instead of saying we got outplayed he ran off the field as quick as he could.  I guess it's embarrassing when you get beat by a "2nd" rate team like Texas Tech....but then I guess what does that make Texas--#7 in the nation??<br>  <br>  The Texas QB couldn't believe it.  He was in total shock...and rightfully so...there was only 1 team that could do it in a minute 29 with Harrell and Crabtree.  <br>  <br>  WHAT A GAME!!! BYE BYE BCS TEXAS!!!!! HAHAHAHAH
AA11928970	New England|`|EFAJuvizaa	GO with Tennesse, they are playing against the Bears with Rex at QB so except alot of sacks and some INT.|`|igEKY5UYaa	TENNSESSE NEW ENGLAND DEFENCE IS WEAK|`|9NzCLWoXaa	TEN. they will destroy Rex
AA11310677	go with addai. rhodes is hurt so there wont be much splitting of carries and ryan grant really hasnt been consistent.|`|EFAJuvizaa	I start Grant over Addai just because MIN DEF can be throw at and the Packers will get to the red zone and Grant will get the carried. I think both will not have a lot of yards this weekend but Grant has more chance to score a td.|`|9NzCLWoXaa	give grant the ball. the steelers defense is ranked number 1
KuuJOITFaa	I really hope you didn't listen to the people who told you to bench Thomas Jones, because he put up monster numbers today.|`|vWu8Bntnaa	Hightower.  The Cards will use him as the feature back for the stretch run, and he's always dangerous in the red zone ... important to consider since they'll be visiting it more against SF than Pitt will this week against Indy.|`|YK348t2maa	Well I have both of them on two diffrent teams But the 49ers have been given up a lot of fantasy points so go with Hightower|`|9NzCLWoXaa	dont play jones and start both moore and hightower|`|cb9ca28b1fc52caf41d3101097654316aa	start hightower and moore. they will get a lot more yardage and points for you than jones will|`|KcZhGG74aa	id go with both and bench Jones|`|GmW0bxGXaa	That's tough... I think they'll both go over 100 yards and have at least 1 touchdown... <br>  <br>  Pitt likes to run especially at home and big Ben hurt<br>  <br>  On the other hand Cards will probably get up big early and run the whole 2nd half...<br>  <br>  I say Moore will put up better numbers but is there no way you can fit them both in? I picked Moore up off the waiver wire and I'm starting him instead of Calvin Johnson this week. |`|EFAJuvizaa	Hightower all the way, he is playing agiainst SF and the ARZ offense is on fire so except 75-90 yds and 1-2 tds this weekend. Plug him in and he will score points for you.
EFAJuvizaa	Rice, he had been hot lately so the coach will ride with him against this weekend.|`|9NzCLWoXaa	rice will play. after last week you dont know about willis|`|C4BMh73Qaa	nope get jackson outta there although i am an eagles fan. both curtis and brown are back which will affect the amount of recpetion for jackson.<br>  <br>  if mcgahee is injured start rice. but if they get a share of carries pick up Mewelder moor if u can or green-ellis<br>  <br>  Rice- 70 yards and a TD<br>  Moore- 80 yards and a td<br>  green ellis- 45 yards and 2 td<br>  <br>  this is what i think will happen|`|vWu8Bntnaa	Rice.  McGahee spent three hours molding the bench to fit his butt last week, and Rice has been getting more carries the last few weeks.  DJ is good, but WR's don't get the same opportunities as feature backs.
EFAJuvizaa	I would go with Cotchery because Favre will likely throw the ball alot. The Jagars will run the ball alot this weekend, so I expect jones to have a big day in receiving yards but not td. Cotchery is more of a risk,but i bet he will have around 70-80yds and 1 td this weekend,|`|9NzCLWoXaa	go with jones at det. he is garrads main target|`|C4BMh73Qaa	defffff matt jones. he is a stud... cotchery will have no more than 50 yards because favre has more players to pass it to. <br>  <br>  Matt jones 90 yards and a posible td|`|KJME6WxMaa	Cotchery has been having a good season <br>  <br>  he has at least a 6 pts. plus 79% of the time
6otcNxxFaa	DB|`|kipu9yL8aa	wide receiver tight end quarterback|`|8a8c6129d92df8b6fab4d08bee1e988daa	defensive back. and try to knock somebodies head off every time you hit em|`|VtMIHQMtaa	Lol at everybody saying DB.  Unless you can jump, you're gonna get burned.  Trust me as a DB, the QB will look at the short guy guarding his receiver and just lob it.  And there's gonna be guys around 6'0", even as freshman.  Don't play DB unless you're gonna be around the same height as your WRs.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend RB.  You're height would help there since you have a low center of gravity and would be harder to tackle.  That's why NFL RBs are usually around 5'10-11.  Trust me as a defensive player, I hate getting down low to take some guy out.  And since you're strong, it's gonna be that much harder to bring you down.  You're also fast, so you can get past on a outside run or be dangerous on the screen passes.<br>  <br>  Look at successful RBs in the NFL right now.  LT is only 5'10, which along with his speed and power makes him one of the best in the game.  You'd have potential at RB.|`|PPVd25fDaa	Try Cornerback. I would also give widereceiver a shot. You might also help as a specialist kick and punt return. Good Luck!|`|VTN4Qun9aa	Probably running back or defensive back are best.  Wide receiver is also a possibility.|`|vxeMZXrgaa	~middle line backer~|`|U3ZR4aMcaa	Play fullback aka blocking back if you want O. On D, (if you bulk up), go linebacker|`|YK348t2maa	a DB or a SS|`|6dj8RWDaaa	I would say that a running back would be the best for u...<br>  my bro is also small and thats what he plays!
7pjCev9naa	vc by mile ....pierce is not as good as vc he only won the finals because of garnett and allan . vince carter is great maybe not as great currently but even currently vince is better than pierce he led his team to the finals and pierce can never win a slam dunk competion vince is also kind enough to give up his all star starter appearence to jordan for his last season. |`|Sd85wdRyaa	I can't beleive some of you twats actually said Carter is better than Pierce. No question Pierce is better than Carter. He can rebound, pass, defend, he can do it all. Carter is a glorified dunker/chucker.|`|apfvBQ9Waa	Vince Carter. Even though Paul Pierce is on a better team, Vince Carter is just a better basketball player.|`|2VVU7gNfaa	Paul Pierce is my choice.<br>  <br>  When has Vince Carter ever won an important basketball game?|`|QidI7xU8aa	Vince Carter. He PWND last night against the Raptors.|`|AA10323435	vince carter|`|eWmv7Jujaa	Umm Th?S ?NE is HARD f?R m? ..iM G???A cH?óSE PA?L P?eRCè|`|SpAv1g2maa	I choose Vince Carter|`|csKyqot0aa	Vince Carter.|`|00aaPLCjaa	paul pierce because he won a nba championship ring last year|`|bwibB9Cnaa	Pierce is my fave player so my answer is def biased. i think pierce is a better shooter and combined with his broad shoulders he uses to drive, i say he is better. his defense is also better in my mind. also his rebounding is alot better. so i say Paul is better. then again he is my fave player so my answer is a little biased.|`|G1ZxaqNVaa	If you saw the nets game against the raptors <br>  <br>  you should already know that vince carter is better|`|nynlxGmNaa	carter|`|W6Y1pyk0aa	VC is the best but KOBE IS BETTER !
8lx7EWivaa	For power running use sleds, do squats, train with weights going uphill. For speed, do sprint intervals, which is running short distances starting off slow and gradually gaining speed til you're at a full sprint. Walk a quarter of the distance you ran and then do it again. Repeat several times. You will know when to quit. Try to add an extra sprint after a few days rest. You will be faster and have explosiveness, jumping ability will increase as well. GOOD LUCK!!!|`|tIJ4fELfaa	sprint uphill, wear weights on your leg|`|lBfsFAp9aa	Running is good Stretch first. if you lift weights to up strength, do cardivascular at the same time so you dont get out of shape or become uncoordinated.
l3ZUVqB7aa	He is a hall of famer, he was cosistant in winning, having won at least 11 games in 17 straight seasons. Among pitchers, he is 33rd alltime in wins (270), had 23 shutouts along with complete games (57). he is 33rd all time in games started (535), and 66th all time in innings pitched (3,562.2), 19th all time in strikeouts (2,813) and has a BB/9 IP (1.98), and has a career .638 win-loss percentage.<br>  <br>  5x All-Star selection (1992, 1993, 1994, 1997, 1999) <br>  7x Gold Glove Award winner (1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2008|`|qTnpXnNIaa	yes probably, for no other reason then he played on a lot of winning teams and the Yankees, but he will probably don a orioles cap cause that was the team he started his career with, how ironic hm mm|`|6odf7XfRaa	You do realize a hundred other people have asked this? But I say no.|`|oKlD65njaa	yes! 270 wins 100 more wins then loses 3.60 era in the american east and the steroid era,|`|AA11612572	yes|`|WpYIT4IEaa	I'm not a Yankee fan at all, but I do think that he has his place in the Hall of Fame, while Clemons doesn't deserve it.|`|FtZU0jpFaa	yes with out a doubt. 
7x4VtGtFaa	Not really. But in 2005, Chelsea had an 11-point lead over Man United in mid March and never relinquished the lead.|`|40kCOPicaa	It's already wrapped up after liverpond drew with Man City 1-1|`|d1b38b13b953ba1dbaf4d9bcd50f9de4aa	No, not since the start of the Premier League in 1992-93. The earliest so far is Man Utd winning on April 14th 2001.|`|hfQnUqnVaa	This years not been wrapped up yet!!!! don't get cocky you Man U fans!!!!!!! chelsea will win!!!!!!! Man U needed the head-start that we gave them!!!!|`|tfotPdeZaa	Er.. no and not this year either :)|`|AA10526130	,,,,NO ,,,but it is this season|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	good luck to you...enjoy|`|d1zz0Afwaa	We'll know when Man U hammer liverpool|`|hgz7XiVBaa	shut up u muppit it is not over till the fat lady sings|`|jiFHJ6daaa	MAYBE.........LOOKING NOT FOR SO.......|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Pride comes before the fall|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Nope and probaly never will. Man Utd had a 12 point lead in Feb 1998 and still lost the Premiership title to Arsenal. A couple of more injuries or a fixture pile up and they could slip up again. as long as it's mathematically possible any of the top 6 could still win the title.|`|B7LyNQtBaa	Yeah in 2005 chelsea a 11 point lead over United.<br>  And Arsenals undefeated league in 03/04|`|RSJbqioUaa	Ermm....well if you're implying that it is this year. It most certainly isn't!|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Doubt so. But April is still a good target ;)

OCa7HxA6aa	Concordo contigo, seu time realmente está muito bem nessa temporada. Para mim é claro que o Palmeiras é um forte candidato para conquistar o campeonato paulista desse ano, e fazer uma brilhante participa??o na Copa Libertadores, pois elenco e competência o clube demonstra em ter de sobra, somente pela imoportante presen?a de Edmílson para equilibrar e desenvolver o setor defensivo e de arma??o, e pelo grande oportunismo de Cleiton Xavier e Keirrison, esse último é tido como a grande promessa do Palmeiras nesse ano.|`|jxxXTEG4aa	N?o sei se é o favorito para a conquista do título mas, com toda a certeza, é a equipe que tem tido o melhor desempenho neste início de temporada. Veremos se conseguirá manter o ritmo ou se vai ser um cavalo paraguaio. Mais algumas rodadas e teremos uma boa base para analisar o desempenho do Palmeiras.|`|IV8HHi71aa	Verd?o 100% esse ano......O Paulista o palmeiras pode ganhar mas eu n?o quero só paulista,tem que ser libertadores também !!!!!!!ah,e ainda por cima o Brasileir?o...tem que aproveitar que esse ano o time tá "b?o"e reconquistar  os titulos que n?o ganhamos a anos,e colocar o "Parmeras" lá em Dubaih.....<br>  <br>  Té mais,bjs do bob...|`|7r8lhRhraa	Dizer que é favorito, seria muito esnobe, mas está bem melhor que ano passado. Esse jovens talento vai longe, ainda mais com o melhor técnico do Brasil.|`|aek6bugsaa	Acho que teu time vai ser campe?o do Paulist?o mais o meu Inter vai ser campe?o do Gauch?o e ainda vai acabar com o corinthians na primeira rodada do Brasileir?o hehehe|`|xRmi9bnKaa	n?o quando ele perde a primeira vai come?ar a perder tudo , o time é muito joven se ele chegar as finais vai pesar a idade|`|YOMhn3Fmaa	palmeiras ta com um time bom mais como bom e velho corinthiano ja mais darei moral para o palmeiras e aposto as minhas fichas no timao !!!!|`|XsiXFcPVaa	realmente é uma boa pergunta...mas vc tem raz?o, se n?o for S?o Paulo será Palmeiras!!!|`|bujgDyzsaa	Com certeza será o palmeiras o campe?o paulista. Apesar do Corinthians ter um tima?o, o palmeiras n?o ficará atrás n?o. Com Vanderlei Luxemburgo no comando, esse ano o time conseguirá muitas conquistas, eu aposto pois ano passado deixou de ser campe?o brasileiro. Mas o verd?o ainda mantém muitos jogadores bons como o Diego Souza e o Marcos e as contrata??es de Edmílson e Keirrison prometem esse ano.<br>  Abra?o e boa sorte pro palmeiras.|`|BZF7z5mwaa	Oiiieeeee  primaaa.<br>  Eita nóis, lá vem ela falar do Palmeiras.<br>  <br>  O Palmeiras tá jogando bem mesmo, o Cleiton Xavier e o Keirrison foram excelentes contrata??es e t?o jogando muito. O Palmeiras esse ano tá com média de 3 gols por partida. Mas o S?o Paulo tá na briga também viu prima? kkkkkk<br>  <br>  Mas o teu time ganhando o paulistinha e o S?o Paulo ganhando a Libertadores, o Brasileiro e o Mundial já tá bom demais né??? kkkkk<br>  <br>  Beijooo primaa!<br>  <br>  Fui!|`|5gGmWq7Oaa	UAHuhauHAUhauu <br>  <br>  Com certeza seu time esta bem, olha pode ate ser favorito hein, rs apesar de eu ser S?o Paulino naum nego que seu time ta arrazando..<br>  <br>  hihihih<br>  parabens...<br>  <br>  bjuuu..|`|J2p036VMaa	Eu acho que esta muito cedo pra saber quem esta bem ou mau, mais calma.|`|CmNetbisaa	n?o|`|xHBUkH9taa	Se fizermos uma análise apenas de futebol, jogado, sem interferência de árbitros e tribunais, aí sim, o Palmeiras torna-se o grande favorito. Mas, depois da roubo de domingo, no jogo Bambis x Botafogo, já come?o a pensar que o título tem destino certo, e pelos meios mais inescrupulosos possíveis!!!|`|zrjm5mFcaa	Verd?o 2009 vai dar na cabe?a naum tem pra ninguém porco,porco,porco,porco é campe?o!!!|`|rvesM6X9aa	N?o sou paulista, mas acompanho o campeonato e acho que o Palmeiras é oque esta melhor preparado e entrosado no momento.|`|UQlIeQRUaa	Há três favoritos ao paulist?o: Palmeiras, Corinthians e S?o Paulo.|`|ECc4Yqcaaa	Depois que seu time jogar com times realmente de porte, como por exemplo o S?o Paulo, você refa?a esta pergunta!|`|W8evZNwJaa	oLHA AE eu torco pro  mas eu acho que o Palmeiras ira ganhar esse campeonato paulista.
nRBC4E5saa	You should check out Wanderlei Silva.  Kind of like a white Brazilian Mike Tyson, except with kicks, knees, and head stomps in addition to punches.<br>  <br>  Anyway, Tyson's best days were 20 years ago.  He has no MMA training.  His speed has declined.  He turned into a head hunter.  If he fought in MMA, he'd get taken down, and once on the ground he'd have no defense.<br>  <br>  It's possible he was the hardest-hitting heavyweight of his time, and in his heyday he was very techncial for his style.  But like I said, his best days are far behind him, plus he doesn't know the MMA game.  He'd get eaten alive.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	I can honestly say I don't follow this but last I heard he isn't allowed to take part in any officially sanctioned fights. This was a few years ago so that may not be the case now.<br>  <br>  It would be a gimmick and I don't think the UFC would go for it, especially after the Kimbo slice debacle with Elite.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	whats with all the yelling.<br>  i would thing because they wont allow tyson to bit ears off of people. they kinda frown on that technique. and most ufc people would like to keep there ears. they are not done with them yet.|`|Qn6ERwZcaa	DUDE, THAT'S LIKE SAYING WHY LARRY BIRD GO BACK TO THE CELTICS AND WIN THEM A BACK TO BACK CHAMPIONSHIP|`|YN93QRdyaa	Well he won't be knocking Kimbo's head off in the UFC, since Kimbo has not, does not and likely will not ever fight in that organization. <br>  <br>  Second, yes, the biting is old. So is Tyson. Did you see his last half-dozen fights? He's done. Personally I actually think the Tyson myth is greater than the reality (he lost the REAL big fights), but the state he's in nowadays, if Kevin McBride can stop him somebody like Cheick Kongo (not a great fighter, by the way) would probably murder him. <br>  <br>  I'm not even going into the whole 'hasn't got a ground game' business.|`|681cdc7b4046a0a5541c9e3d94132feaaa	Nobody wants to here " I want to eat his children ,praised be to ALA".<br>  The guy tattooed another guys face on his face hes got serious mental issues, and I highly doubt anybody wants anything to do with him. He bit  Holyfield's ear off to get back at him for a head but, whats he going to do if somebody accidentally kicks him in the groin?Lets not go there.|`|O9NHDTj3aa	quite simply coz he would get his *** kicked he is way past his time theres talk of him and bob sapp allrite but i think even sapp would kick his *** so if he couldnt beat sapp then he is not worthy of a spot in the best mma org there is in the ufc.|`|oTb67zNYaa	<a href="http://www.sportaphile.com/2008/04/25/mike-tyson-is-fat-now-the-camera-adds-65-pounds/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sportaphile.com/2008/04/25/mi...</a> this and his age|`|6qMaZ0N4aa	I think he is too old now is the issue and not in his prime any more had he done so when he was in his prime as in teh 80's that would be a fight to watch then!|`|mABnezzDaa	Because he's too old now, and even if he did there's probably no way he could keep up with any A or B level fighter in MMA, He'd be a novelty fighter just like Kimbo...|`|TnTXGNyMaa	because he would get his *** kicked. tyson was a great boxer, but thats it.. UFC fighters are trained in every aspect of the game, they would take tyson down and submit him in seconds|`|9UuAFa4Vaa	hes old now.|`|NWMwWTxyaa	none of the fighters would want the baggage a fight with tyson would bring....it would just be a media stunt if you asked me......but tyson is a biter lol imagine him and what he would do to a fighter you had him on the ground in positions hes never been in before....plus he will threaten to eat their heart and children....|`|A5aYD4S3aa	tyson is a bum.always has been always will be. now ali was the best.and if he was in his prime tyson never would have got the belt|`|RqQDKEVHaa	He was an excellent boxer with anger management issues. But being an excellent boxer isn't enough. Unless you know something we don't, he had little/no ground game or submissions. If he could keep it stand-up, maybe it'd be interesting. Even then, though, we'd have to assume he has no particular kicking skill.<br>  <br>  And remember the gloves in MMA are just 4 ounces. It's a much different strategy than boxing.<br>  <br>  As far as anger management, you have to remain in control. I'm not sure Tyson has/had the temperament.<br>  <br>  Still, I do like to see crossovers. So I'm not saying I wouldn't like to see Tyson (or some other top boxer) attempt MMA. But without well-rounded skills, I don't think he'd get very far.|`|zZjgLhRWaa	it wouldn't be a very long match it would be over in just 2 bits.
nqBhFyt7aa	For your last question: Flyers have to be pretty small and could be really short to medium height. And the flyers have to be strong enough to hoist themselves up into the bases hands. <br>  <br>  Okay, this next part will be VERY long and it answers your first question: <br>  Before Tryouts:<br>  Get yourself into shape [cheer exercises]. You should work on your flexibility, power, and your endurance. You might want to find out if there are any tryout camps, practices, and/or sessions before tryouts to give you some practice. You may also want to look into getting involved in some tumbling and/or dance classes to help with your technique and get your body physically prepared. Here are some other tips prior to tryouts:<br>  1.) Stretch as much as you can [stretching exercises] - focus on your hamstrings and legs for toe touches and stretches<br>  2.) Work on your Endurance [endurance exercises] - work on your endurance so that you can keep up at tryouts<br>  3.) Strength train [Strength exercises] - you need to be able to lift and be lifted. Many skills require you abs, legs, arms, shoulders to be ready to handle the stress.<br>  4.) Power train [Power excersises] - many cheerleading skills require for you to be explosive even if you are a flier or base.<br>  5.) Work on your Jumps [jumping excersises] - it will be a required skill and you can work on it in the safety of your home.<br>  6.) Take Tumbling classes - you will get a leg up on the other girls trying out, because some will not be able to tumble<br>  7.) Take Dance classes - dancing is similar to cheerleader, so get used to moving your body.<br>  8.) Work on motions in the mirror - it is the little things that count and I have even seen college girls make the mistake of not working on their motions.<br>  <br>  Tryout sessions pointers:<br>  Tryouts will usually have a practice session beforehand. You will be given some cheers, chants, and a dance to memorize during this time. You will also be given the chance to work on your skills beforehand so use your time wisely. Here are some session pointers:<br>  1.) Don’t compare yourself to others. It might make you nervous. I have seen girls who would have made the team give up, because they thought that they were not going to make one of the spots.<br>  2.) Don’t' be afraid to ask for help. Get all of your questions answered before the tryouts. It makes you look like you care about the tryouts, and you get all of your questions answered so you confidence improves.<br>  3.)GO to the sessions. Some girls won't even go to the sessions, and I guarantee you will miss something that you could use in your favor.<br>  4.)When practicing the cheers, chants, and dances be sure you stand somewhere were you can see the instruction.<br>  5.)Pay attention to questions asked by the other, and NO goofing around.<br>  6.)Take a blank tape to be able to record the music for the dance.<br>  7.)Again practice you motions in the mirror. BUT this time also do it with you cheers, chants, and dance.<br>  8.)Pratice with other individuals so that you can critique one another.<br>  9.)Go full out when practicing, so that when the time comes to do it in front of the judges you are ready.<br>  <br>  Morning of tryouts:<br>  1.)Get plenty of sleep<br>  2.)Eat a good and healthy breakfast, but don't fill yourself up.

It depends on the coach and how good they think you are.A fligher has to do basket tosses and cradle.No it is not hard well to me if you know how to lock your knees or you will get hurt.A flyer is chosen by if you are really tall you will be a base cause a really tall fligher will be hard to throw also if you have muscles you will be a spot or a base it just depends .I hope this helps remember to practice a trampoline and a pool are great ways to practice your jumps .|`|SJ64zwYDaa	well im no cheerleader but my girlfriend is a junior in high school and one of the stars on her cheer team.  She is a base which holds up the flyers and catches them.  Flyers are the girls that do the stunts in the air and are the ones being held up during stunts. Flyers should not be too tall or heavy because they need to be caught and no one wants a fat flyer! Just be confident and dont be scared when you get thrown in the air and most importantly trust your teammates that they will catch you!  Good luck :D|`|qAGeCYVlaa	You will probably be expected to do a back hand spring and you need to be really LOUD!! It's difficult to make a football cheer-leading squad in high school because football is THE high school sport, and they want the best. I'm a back spot so I don't really know to much about being up in the air, but they are normally strong and shorter than the people basing them. Good luck to you!|`|MgInp7sWaa	Well, I'm a flyer myself, and pretty much to be chosen you have to be pretty short, light, and flexible. One thing that really helps is CONFIDENCE even if you have no idea what they're asking you to do. Your coaches and your probable teammates will really respect you if your willing to just pull the tricks they ask you to do because it shows your reliable and adaptable.

zg1lIy7Oaa	There is no rule in the book that you can't use a retired number. Any player can use a retired number but due to respect (if a retired number was used by a great superstar), you can ask for a permission to use the retired players number. Take Shaquille O'Neal as an example, he used to don jersey #32 for the Orlando Magic but when he transfered to LA Lakers, he didn't used it because it was used by Magic Johnson and it was known worldwide that #32 of Lakers is Magic, he can't used #33 either because that number was don again by another great, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar so he used # 34 instead. He can actually use #32 or #33 but he knows that his number won't be unique if he also use other "greats" number. There are some franchise who retired different player jerseys with same numbers.|`|4uW1QdMpaa	i never thought there was a rulebook, but most rookies will not ask for a retired number.. in respect to the legend that it is retired to|`|vFthoB6Haa	if a number is retired it's retired! it's there to honor a player's achievements...hey, nice moustache! is that borat?|`|A79MHUNtaa	Yes there is|`|piZ4xDBqaa	There's no rule that says the number can't be unretired, but it's not likely to happen.  The only way you could do it without a huge amount of fan backlash is if the player who originally had the number publicly says it's okay.  Seriously, can you imagine what the fans in Boston would do if some rookie trotted out there wearing Birds number?|`|kFcdwVwdaa	well to be clear, if a rookie went to boston and asked to use any of the retired number he wouldn't be able to. take kobe for example, when he went to the NBA as a Laker, he wanted to be number 33, but due to Kareem, he couldn't. he then chose number 8 due to the sum of the number he used in the high school all american game, which was 134 i think. if he had gone to another team that didn't have the number 33 retired he would have been able to have it, but not as a Laker.<br>  so what i'm saying is that it depends on the team that he went to
