Hi,      I'm going to Washington DC for a band trip in April (I know it's too early to think about it, but I need to get it over with in my head).

I probably wont even use it, but I'll bring it just in case)   Dry shampoo (IT IS MY LIFE, lol)   Brush   Toothbrush/Toothpaste   Razor (shaving)   Straightener (again, probably wont use it)   Specs and their case   Contacts and such (Never use them, but father will make me bring them      OTHER THINGS   Cell phone and charger   Ipod and charger         Anything I should add or take away?

20090308103310AAWurc1	Travel;United Kingdom;Other - United Kingdom	Scottish people being anti-Welsh?	Why do so many Scots, especially the Nationalists have such a problem with Wales? But what do you base your opinions on?    When I go to Wales, I see more of a country than Scotland. Because you all speak English, your national anthem is in English, you're trying to wipe out your languages (I'm not including 'Scots' as it's just a dialect of English). Also, all your signposts are in English, but I do know you have Gaelic ones in some areas.   The Welsh still have their own language. Scotland chose English as their language, while the Welsh were forced to speak English. Yet, they have saved it from dying out.      I have more respect for Welsh people, as they have more respect for their country. They don't base their nationality on hating us, and are proud of their culture. Wales has had cultural nationalism, and I don't think Scotland has ever had something like this. Also, Scotland went into the Union, because you were bankrupt by the Darien scheme, and England bailed you out, yet you still hate us! Independence- You're so blinded by anti-Englishness, you'll do anything to get away from us, even at the expense of your country's wellbeing.       Why do you believe that you've been oppressed by England, and Wales has had an easy ride? Do you know their history? Why do you enjoy being 'victims'? Why do you have this 'Braveheart' mentality? It's 2009!      My girlfriend is Welsh, and she had a lot of hassle in Scotland for being Welsh. She speaks her language, and so do her family. They're really proud people, and I have never seen this in the Scots. Just anger and bigotry. And not just towards the English and Welsh. Heard some nice anti-Irish chanting from Rangers fans.    I'm not aiming this at all Scots, just the ignorant ones.

On 2/14/09, my 6-year-old daughter left her Nintendo DS backpack in the overhead compartment of a Southwest jet.  Inside the backpack was a Nintendo DS, several DS games and a Sony MP3 player.  We just realized the backpack was missing when she went to look for it today.  Then, we remembered the last time she had it was as we boarded the plane.        I contacted Southwest this evening.  They said it will take about 14 days for them to process the claim and try to locate the lost item.  They seemed confident with their lost/found process.  But, I'm just wondering if any of you have had an experience with Southwest's lost and found department.  And, if so, what was your outcome?  I just wonder what the statistics are.        Any info will be helpful to us.

On the Ryan Air website, when i go to book where it states 'how many bags to check in' if i put one bag and airport check in, which 'bag' am i referring to? My suitcase? Or the one i store in the cabin? If i want to take both a suitcase and a hold all for the cabin do i have to put two bags?   All answers appreciated, I'm clueless!    Thanks.

I was just wondering about the EMH at Epcot. We're not staying at a resort hotel so technically we could not get the bands or whatever is needed for EMH. But if we've already been there all day couldn't we just continue to walk around the world showcase? Or do they have people looking out for the wristbands past the normal close time?
