20090205034341AAAgc4h	Sports;Golf	Playing a Hawkeye...7 Wood, by Callaway?	I posted before that I'm a 16 Hcp player, been playing 18 months. But also played about 30 years ago.      I'm using 1,3, 5, 7 (hawkeye) and 9. Then 3, 6, 7, 8, 9,  Approach, Pitching and Sand Wedge....14 clubs in the bag with the putter.      I favoured the 7, using it everywhere, like on par 3's...even teeing off on tight fairways, for accuracy...I can hit it 170, depending on flight, ball will roll...180, 190....sometimes rolling off the back of the green. But if I line up correctly, the club is very reliable and accurate.      The problem is I've actually been hitting the ball over the green...if I ease up I don't get the same shot. Like today...I had 180, hitting over a screen.....I hit the ball one bounce on the green...straight into the clubhouse on 18..ball rebounded back.       I'm really wondering about the alternatives...9 wood would be short, 3 wood also long, but not so accurate...5 wood...not always able to get the distance.      So it's either ease up on the shot? How would you do that and still get a decent shot? Or go with the 5 or 9 and be short.      What am I missing?

20090205051250AAJEhTc	Sports;Wrestling	Regarding icon vs icon, can I ask you something (inside) ?	We all know that we will most likely have Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels at Wrestlemania 25. since HBK-JBL storyline is most likely end in No Way Out and I don't see Taker winning the title at EC.      We can't argue if this will be an icon vs icon match. But regarding this icon vs icon match, do u think this match will live up to its hype as one of the most anticipated match and perhaps one of the best match in the history of Wrestlemania?      I mean, if we look to the previous icon vs icon, which is Hulk Hogan vs Ultimate Warrior, Stone Cold vs The Rock, and The Rock vs Hulk Hogan, I didn't see quality matches.      Stone Cold vs The Rock and The Rock vs Hulk Hogan maybe more legendary than Batista vs The Undertaker, but Batista vs The Undertaker at Wrestlemania 23 has more quality and tension than every icon vs icon combined.      So again, do u think HBK vs Undertaker will live up to its hype? Do u think we could finally see quality match in icon vs icon?  Why or why not ?
20090205050630AAoDgNl	Sports;Wrestling	What do u think WWE could do to make John Cena more 'watchable' ?	Before anyone start cussing me, please hear me out first. We know Cena is a good role model and perhaps currently the most passionate star in WWE. Although he has so many haters, he deserves to got some respect.      The only thing upsetting about him is his haters most infamous reason, five moves. Now, I could understand WWE trying to protect him from injuries so they make him look like a superman and destroys his opponents in five moves, but seriously, it's getting tiring.      I've heard so many times that Cena has decent wrestling ability and I think the fans deserve to see him using those moves. Because if he keeps using 5 moves, I bet his going to be boring. Unwatchable, in short.      My question is, what do u think WWE could do to make him watchable? Since WWE limited his move sets, I don't think not limiting his move sets will be an answer. What's your suggestion ?

20090205045424AADRslE	Sports;Football (American)	Which NFL team do you think should come to Los Angeles?	If football in L.A were to come back, and it wasn't an expansion team, which team in the NFL would it be?      They've been saying that possibly the Chargers and the Raiders.      Another one is the Buccaneers or the Saints.      The teams whose leases with their stadiums are ending pretty soon are the Rams, Raiders, 49ers, Saints, and Chargers.      Now the 49ers would be stupid to leave San Fransisco with their strong tradition there.  With the 5 Super Bowls and all.  And the Chargers are doing very well in San Diego.      But the Rams and Raiders would make sense for them to return to Los Angeles.  The Raiders are terrible and could go anywhere really, but the Rams have a big established fan base that still roots for them in L.A.  Plus, the owner Chip Rosenbloom is the son of Carrol Rosenbloom who owned the Rams in Los Angeles before Georgia Frontierre took them out 20 years after his death.      Could Chip Rosenbloom want to return the Rams to L.A?        What do you guys think?

Sting is starting to get rusty, but can still go.       These two are more well known and can draw if people heard about them fighting for a World Title.

20090205055208AAyuq0f	Sports;Baseball	Why those so called “experts” start to say Braves is a contender again?	I am a Braves fan but I don’t think they can contend in NL East after both Phillies and Mets had upgrades and Marlins’ become a more mature team.      In fact, the 2009 teams are actually worse than the team in 2008 at the beginning of the season. The 2008 Braves rotation contains John Smoltz, Tim Hudson, Tom Glavine, Mike Hampton and Jair Jerrijens. Only JJ were known but the top four suppose to have a great season that with two of them possible CY candidates. 2009 rotation has whole bunch of horses but none of them are even remotely consider to win CY.      The bullpen is basically the same except in 2008, Peter Moylan and Rafael Soriano suppose to be healthy with Gonzo coming back. 2009 only Gonzo is available with his velocity falling plus question mark with Peter and Rafael’s health.      The line-up is about the same minus 110 RBIs from Tex and Jeff suppose to get 100 RBIs as well. 2009 Braves need to consider Jeff is up to the test and still Braves do not have the formidable middle line-up like 2008.      Bench is about the same.       Now on paper, this Braves team is actually getting worse. Yeah, you can say they will all stay healthy but who would predict the 2008 Braves having to lose so many major players.       Again the future is unpredictable but just by judging the surface, Braves cannot be even consider the top three in NL East.       They are the dark horse, far from a contender.

Serious question - should overtime be left as is or the rules changed? Why?      Not so serious question - What sort of overtime rule would you implement?    An example would be something like put the ball on the 50 yard line and have each team line 11 guys up on their 40s. Blow the whistle and whoever gets the ball gets the ball.

And Swisher also could be an option looking to have a better year than last, he could provide more homeruns than either of the other guys.  I'm actually kind of hoping Yankees could make a trade for Rick Ankiel if the Cardinals lose the arbitration battle with him.  I'd trade Melky or Gardner and pick up a few extra million for Ankiel's contract.  What does everyone think?

20090205071351AAtA7aG	Sports;Football (American)	How is Bob Sanders the best safety in the league?	I can name a few guys actually better than him. I mean, he has really shown absolutely no coverage ability, and he is just a run stopper. But the thing is there are actually Strong Safeties in the NFL that are around the ball more often than he is. So because the team's defensive scheme depends on a guy running full speed ahead at the line of scrimmage (I have seen him play and that is mainly what I've seen). I mean of course players run the other way, how many of you would let a guy ruining full speed at you throw his body at you and lay a big hit when you knew you could avoid it? I know he is a big hitter, but to me it takes more than that to be considered a good strong safety.      Stay Cool        Kaine

I've noticed some people hitting with 2 and some others hitting with 1 and me and myself personally, i hit it with 2. i feel i get more power and grip with 2 hands. more security as well. but i noticed that a player like Federer only uses 1 and he hits it like its nothing. so much strength and control.      I saw him hit it with 1 hand vs Roddick and Nadal during the Australian Open. (as im sure he hits it with 1 hand vs everyone else)      do you hit your backhand with 2 hands or 1? why?      thanks

Even at the French Open you saw how happy he was, but when he won the title he just celebrated like it was any other title. Do you think (other than Australian tennis players) that the Aussie Open matters as much to players as the other three Majors? Also, did it seem to you that Nadal was not too overjoyed with winning?

20090205072318AATe9pk	Sports;Wrestling	What are your thoughts about a queen of the ring tournament at wrestlemania?	Someone suggested 2 months ago a queen of the ring event. The usual king of the ring was integrated to raw in 2008, but it would be cool storyline-wise if a minor title like queen of the ring was added. It would also free Beth and Melina from a continuous spotlight, and allow some alternance from one episode of raw or SD to the next. 7 matches in one night takes too much tape so we'd get like the semifinals and finals at WM, or just 4 contenders and 3 matches.      In case you are still reading, i have thought about another PG option:   The "bread & butter basket" match featuring two baskets and two divas. During that match, each diva must bring a basket full of bread to a wrestling hall of famer like Moolah, but some sort of wolf guards the way down to the Hall of Famer. So the wolf must be tricked. Also the two divas can assault each other, and the first to bring a basket to the hall of famer would win.       Do you like that?

20090205073458AAVEFsK	Sports;Basketball	Will the Miami Heat win 45 games this season?	They are 26 - 22 at this point and in order to win 45, they need to go 19 - 15 the rest of the way.    This is important only in that there has only been one team to ever win the NBA Championship without at least a .550 record and that was the 1977-78 Washington Bullets who went 44-38 (.538) in the regular season but defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in the NBA Finals.    In order for Wade to get any real consideration for MVP, his team would have to win at least 45 and most likely 50 games. (but not realistic to expect them to go 24 - 10 the rest of the season)

20090205042009AATT6rW	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	What do you think about this Pique's interview about Man U and SAF....?	Q:How does it feel to be back, living in Catalonia again?      A:There's just no comparison possible between living in Maresme and living in Manchester, but I don't regret at all the decision I made. In Mancheser I learnt to be a football player because there's nothing else to do there. You can only play football.         Q:Tell us about your problems...      A:Well, I wouldn't call it problems because I became a true player in Manchester. But I arrived without a very good knowledge of the English language and I got a bit lost in conversations.      Q:And even more when talking to Ferguson...      A:The gaffer, which is how Ferguson is known in Manchester, talks English with a Scottish accent which sounded like Chinese to me. But I wasn't the worst one, there are players in the current squad who still don't understand him. ... HAHAAHAHAHA      Q:This food regime, monitored by a dietitian, is something new to you or you already knew that from your time at Manchester?      A:In England, it's horrible. Everyone ate what they wanted and if you know the English food, you can imagine what I'm talking about. Every two weeks we got into the 'folds machine' to test the percentage of fat in our bodies. It would be a scandal if people would see how some star players almost damaged that machine because they lived on hamburgers and beer.

I am a cheerleading coach of Middle School girls and we are having our end of the season banquet in 2 weeks. There are 20 girls on the team. 4 of which have perfect attendance and I think that should be recognized especially considering that half the team was usually late or not present entirely too many times. Every girl will be getting a trophy for participating. However I wanted to do special honors such as best tumbling, best dancer. The issue I'm having is there are a bunch of girls who were lazy and don't deserve an award at all. My question is should I give EVERYONE a special recognition? Or go with my original plan of just selecting about 10 out of the 20 girls to give special recognitions to (and run the risk of having angry parents upset that their child didn't receive anything but a participation trophy?) ugh! please help

20090205081500AAbHjOK	Sports;Hockey	How can you NOT like Brind'Amour?	I think most everybody likes Rod Brind'Amour.  In my opinion, currently he is the best example of a great captain.  He can pump his team up, show class like a veteran, demonstrate leadership in the locker room, has more than 1000 pts in more than 1000 GP, and still has a 60% face-off winning average.  He has been having problems with his lower body for quite some time now.  Reports say he was sent home early during Carolina west coast trip.  Do you think Brind’Amour is done after this season?  If so, will Staal be the Hurricane’s next captain?        Also, do you like Rod?

He claims that if a player from one team is standing out of bounds and a player from the other team throws the ball out at him and it hits him before hitting anything else, the ball is off the player who threw the ball because the play from the other team is already out of bounds. I was saying that if the player from the other team is on of the 5 on the floor hes active so if he was standing out of bounds and someone from the other team threw the ball out and it hit him, it would be off of the player standing out of bounds.

To tell you the truth I think the Divas, I mean lets face it weather you like the divas or hate the divas or like one and not the reast or Whatever they always Kick ***.      There are divas I don't really care for like Beth or Layla but Hell even I have to admit they both Kick ***,      It dose not matter if they were Womans Champion or Playboy cover Girl         All the divas kick ***, Trish Stratus was an awesome Wrestler and I know I don't say it alot but she was super HOT.          and I feel that there really has not been anything new with the superstars just the same old guys beating up on each other and Bitching like little girls when they lose the title or match         HELL the divas our tougher then that I have not heard one diva cry over loseing a match but yet I here Orton and Y2J cry all the time not only that but they take 15 to 20 min of the show talking about it            So Go Divas they 100% kick ***

Well they have a fan base that spreads all walks of life and all ages, unlike pop stars that only appeal to teenage girls and wussies or washed up rock stars from 30 years ago that had a great 5 or 6 year run and now are just well done for. Most importantly of all most people find their music to be tolerable even if they don't like them. And finally I have seen them live a few times and they put on a hell of a show whether they're playing their old school in your face thrash that I grew up on or their newer more radio friendly tunes. And before anyone tells me how much they sold out just remember you could have Justin Homolake.

Ronaldo has only scored 14 goals in 31 games, and hasn't scored any goals in the champions league. He doesn't have many assists either         Anyone who knows anything about football knows that Messi is more naturally talented than Ronaldo.

My goal is to become comfortable with sleeping overnight in a tent in the woods alone.  I have had this desire for years and years to camp in various states and go on hikes spending the night on the trail. I am asking you outdoor experienced people what I can do, or what has helped you be able to accomplish this.            I like to hike and kayak but want to learn how to be comfortable camping in the woods or on the beach alone, to broaden the selection I have of places I can experience. The problem is I get antsy even when trying to camp in a suburban backyard (my home).             I have taken 3 camping wilderness courses which included weekend trips together in a class. Also, I have invested a lot of money on camping items - 300 just in the past 3 weeks, and also a lot over the last five years. I hate absolutely hate the cold weather, and I am never able to get to sleep in a tent, only getting a couple hours sleep, or none. To give you another idea about me--- I tried sleeping in my new sleeping bag while it was laid out on my bed last night. It was comfy, but I kept nodding off and reawakening for hours, until I had to give up and sleep without it.            Anyone know what I can do? I also have been considering borrowing my mother's dog so I won't feel so alone. I know my problem seems amusing, but I am serious in my endeavor. Please help.
