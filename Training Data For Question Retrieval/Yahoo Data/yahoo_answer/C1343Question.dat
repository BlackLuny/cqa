20090220104831AAmhg4V	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why must white men be surprised of more white women today getting more flab, while this isn't a new thing?	many white men, especially in this forum have been asking things like “why the white women NOWADAYS are getting more f_t?”, as if like  white women in previous times was much more common with slim and slender bodies,      while they’re actually just the same as today, where different people came up with different body types.      so, flabby or overweight white women in big numbers aren't something new and there's nothing really wrong with it, unlike how some men here have been making a fuss out of it.       here a few examples:      1. Albertina Agnes, Princess of Nassau, ca. 1675 -  http://www.digitalcrocker.org/digitalcro...          2. Salome, around 17th century -  http://www.digitalcrocker.org/digitalcro...          3.

I've lived in London, Los Angeles, and Chicago, and I find it interesting that every single homeless person I  have seen is either black or white.

Poor Indians don't tend to come to this country, and Asian and Hispanic families are traditionally close-knit.  Does anyone else have any thoughts?

20090220105459AAorsFx	Social Science;Psychology	Why should I keep living after breaking up with a truly-loved best friend of two years?	Many people say that suicide is wrong and one should move on, but I genuinely don't understand why I should keep living after loosing a friendship that made up so much of my life (indeed, it just seems like a dream or past life now).      My loved ones would be hurt i.e. parents and this is why I don't think I could ever do it, but I feel I have to. Why should someone keep living after loosing a loved one? Why live with tragedy? This is what I don't get. A mahoosive loss is a mahoosive loss. Mine has caused me to be friend/friendship/social phobic and social anxiety. I am a loner. I lost my friend in high school and I am now 18. I'm at college btw.

20090220111352AADPqUC	Social Science;Psychology	A question about a vivid imagination?	When I have my eyes closed and imagine something--say a clock--the resulting image is so vivid that it looks like it is being projected onto the back of my eyelids. Then, when I open my eyes and look at a wall, I can see a fuzzy reddish outline of whatever I imagined. If I blink my eyes, it loses definition and seems to grow slightly larger, the same as though I had looked at a bright light, or image on a computer screen in a dark room.      Others I talk to seem to think this is unusually vivid, as far as imaginations go. The only explaination I can think of is that my brain is actually activating my eyes in some way, causing them to change in the same way that they would if they saw the thing I am imagining. Is this possible?

20090220111931AA2Y09b	Social Science;Psychology	Would you stay in a relationship like this?	So I've been going out with my boyfriend for half a year now and I met him at work. He's 27 and I'm 18 and I regret not listening to people's advices earlier on about the apparent age gap. However, in the beginning of the relationship, we would only make out and we respected each other by not going beyond that. He said that he wouldn't touch my private parts since he believes that that should wait till marriage. However, my parents did not really approve of us dating due to the age gap so we had to break up. We ended up continuing the relationship underground with only my and his close friends knowing. When we got back together, I was really passionate about him since he did some sweet stuff to get me back apparently and he seemed to have used that to his advantage. A few weeks after we got back together, he started wanting to touch my private parts even if he knows that I'm not that comfortable with it.

20090220115511AAbIygZ	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I dreamed of scorpions..what do you think this means?	I know this has been asked before..But I believe as far as dreams go..to each his own.  In MY dream, I was in an unfamiliar house, my oldest brother was there.  There were other people, but focus was never put upon them, so I could not tell you if I knew them or not.  It seems that my brother introduced the scorpions to the dream, they were fairly small, white, and VERY VERY fast.  They would not sting me maliciously, but only if i disturbed them enough.  They WOULD, however, always run towards me and stand between, or under the arch of my bare feet.  If i ran, I was never fast enough.  I was not "scared" but more...antsie...uncomfortable.  If i touched it with my feet or hands too much, i would be stung multiple times, FAIRLY painful, but the stings produced no lasting effects, and no marks were made.  If I ran, and was caught, a scorpion would crawl into my hair, where i would try to knock it out.  In the end, I picked up the two scorpions with my hands (I was stung A lot, no marks, fairly painful) put them into a bag, and piled snakes of various colors and size on top of them.  The snakes kept trying to escape though, but I tried to put them back in, then my mind wondered to another dream that I need not mention here.        I would deeply appreciate any unique or open minded answers out there, based on details I have given.      Thank you VERY much,      Slug.

I was talking with my boyfriend on the phone last night about a serious topic (regarding our relationship and the continuation of it) and he was very hesitant to share his thoughts.  However, when he did finally tell me what he was thinking, in the middle of talking, he said this: "I think it's a lot like Leanna.  It was the same thing, it was the same thing, it was the same thing, it was the same thing..."  He also did the same thing later on in the same conversation, repeating his response "I don't know" multiple times, in the same exact tone.  He's never done this before (at least for as long as I've known him, which is about two years), and he'd repeated it too many times for it to just be for "dramatic effect".  It startled me and made me wonder if perhaps he has some sort of anxiety tic.  I just want to know if it's common for people to repeat like that if they don't have a disorder?

20090220123427AA7IkAJ	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can anyone tell me what this dream meant (kinda long)?	I had a really freaky gore dream last night. But it was completely third person. I was someone else and I didn't recognize anyone. I didn't know their names either except the girl I was suppose to be. Her name was Annie. This is the dream:      Annie was visiting her grandma for the summer and a bunch of her family members were there. Three were three older men, two older women, her grandma, three teenage boys, and Annie's older sister. Well after getting bored, Annie and her sister went down this trail in this wooded area and the come to this pier... I don't know if it was a pier of a dock. But it was high above the beach about 20 feet and covered by a thatch roof. The beach had a "backing" of black volcanic rock like it was separated from everything else. The pier type thing went forward about 150 feet but there was also an extension that went to the left that went all along the rock and at the end about 1000 feet. It had sort of a little shack at the end with paper walls (like they have in Japan). Well Annie and her sister climbed down to get on the beach and we were swimming and having a great time. There was this killer whale that kept swimming around us. Then this boy appeared. He was about 16 or so. He reminded me a lot of Taylor Lautner. He was on a surf board and we hung out and swam together. Annie like him a lot but it seemed like he was more interested in her sister. He even kind of spoke to the whale to come and play with them too. Eventually they swam back to shore on the other side of the pier (it was a small area like 5 feet wide because there was another rock "wall" there) and we were getting bit by these little fish. the guy told them to move and he was explaining about the fish and told us to put some steak on a hook and they would come and get it. Well it was getting dark and Annie decided to go up to the house to let people know where they were. The house was completely empty so she grabbed some paper and a chunk of steak, rope, and a huge hook and wrote a note saying they were down at the beach. Then she went back down to the pier and she tied the rope to a beam on the pier and tied the hook to the other end, put the steak on it, and dropped it in the water. Then she took another piece of paper that said that they'd be swimming and attached it to the string. There was a man behind her and she turned. It was a family member of hers (he reminded me of Hugh Laurie) and he was holding a small book like he was reading. He told her that she shouldn't go swimming anymore. But Annie smiled at him and invited him but he said no to the offer. Annie didn't see her sister or the guy on the beach so she started heading towards the little shack. When she was about half way there, she heard a chainsaw and some screaming. She started running towards the shack and stopped when she was about ten feet from the open door where she saw the boy holding the chainsaw over her dead sister who was cut to pieces. The boy smiled and said her name but she started running. He ran after her and she made the decision to jump off the pier. She landed and stood to see if her leg was broken. Luckily they weren't and she ran to the pier. The boy had jumped down too and was chasing her. Then her older family members and he hacks through them. Annie is screaming and crying but still running. She eventually gets to the pier ans the three younger guys were there waiting. She ran behind them crying and when to boy came up, he killed one of the boys who tried to get the chainsaw from him then suddenly an old VW Bug comes rushing down the pier and knocks the guy off and apparently kills him. The boys smack their hands together and woot and talked about how easy it was because the breaks were slippery. Annie was in too much shock to say anything. Then my dream cuts to the scene where the two boys and Annie are in a car and they're talking and saw a hatchback off in a ditch and Annie suddenly felt a chill. Like it was some way that guy could come back.      Then my dream ends.      Please tell me what you think? I want serious answers. Not to just tell me to look it up in a dictionary or something. And please don't just comment for the two points.      Thank you.

20090220122811AA7mjSr	Social Science;Psychology	Is there any chance of saving our relationship?	I'm a freshman and my exboyfriend is a senior. We met at the beginning of this year & he became one of my best friends. He told me in October that he had feelings for me, but he thought I was just too young. We have been "talking" since the first of January, but were in a relationship for only a few weeks. He broke up with me on Wednesday and said the age difference was just too much right now at this point in our lives and it wouldn't be such a big deal to him if we were older. He told me Monday that I was a good kisser, though, and he said he'd been thinking about us separating only since the day before. I miss him like crazy.. Is there any chance of fixing our relationship? How do I win him back?

20090220135259AAyRmEA	Social Science;Sociology	How can I get an annoying boy to leave me alone????????? Please answer!!!?	ok so there's this guy that's in my math class n he is the most annoying boy on the planet i swear!!!!!!! last semester he was in my study hall/pe (we hav pe b days n study hall a days) n in study hall he n his friends used to harrass me by yelling "your hot" across the room, going through my stuff, sitting by me, asking questions about my boyfriend, putting my name in the song ice ice baby, whispering things when i walk by, trying to follow me in the hall. It got so bad that the teacher threatened to call the office if they didn't stop harrassing me. In pe he would yell things at me when he ran by, wave at me across the room and stuff like that. But now he's not in my study hall/ pe anymore he resorted to bothering me other places. If he sees me in the hall before schools starts he'll say hi to me and he insists on high-fiving me everytime he sees me. And before math starts he says my name really loud and says hi to me (he even says hi to me even if he already did that day) And at lunch if i walk by their table he screams "hey" to me and insists on high-fiving me every time. and yesterday he and his friends kept asking me for hugs. If he sees me after school he always yells something at me. And yesterday (we got out early and didn't have school today) he said he to me, high-fived me, n told me he can't wait to see me agian. And informed me he was coming to my house even though he doesn't know where i live. He even told me at lunch the other day he was adding me on myspace. This kid is really annoying me. I know he doesn't like me because my friend told me he and his friends do that. And he even told one of my friends he doesnt really like me. Why is he doing this? It's getting really annoying I just want him to stop what can I do??

The teacher saw it and she just giggled. When I told my mother about it she just laughed and said that it was the oldest trick in the book and she did it to boys too when she was young.

I  really do not smile in public, lots of people have told me to "smile", but i think that frowning has really become part of me. When i was little, no one told me that i was not smiling until when i started growing up. I think if i had someone to correct me when i was young, it would have been much better. I have tried my possible best to smile in public and keep it that way, but when i smile, i dont know when my face would change again (frowning), because am so used to it.  People cannot tell when i am happy from when i am unhappy with my  frowning face. I am sooooo tired of this lifestyle. It  has and is really, really affecting my social life (people most times do not want to associate with me becos of that; in other words they avoid me)..... when i am in public, i feel isolated. I am just sick and tired... Does any body know of a solution to this problem pleasssssssssseeeeeeee?

20090220142902AA1Q5VB	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Does this woman deserve equal pay, yes or no?	I went to the U.S. post office last month and shipped out several heavy boxes. I did this on more than three occasions. On the first occasion a rather rotund, but well able man, dealt with the subsequent lifting of the packages onto the scale (to weigh for postage) and then the removal and physical transport of them, to a large cart about 5 feet behind him.      On the second occasion a rather elderly, yet taller man, performed the same service and obligations       On the third occasion, the woman who attended to me asked if i could place the packages on the scale FOR her and then upon seeing the remaining amount of packages on the floor behind me (20 to 30 which varied in size and weight and which were about the same amount her two male co-workers had dealt with) asked me to go to another attendant, because she could/would NOT "deal with that".       In fact her male co-workers were obviously conditioned to respond all too eagerly in carrying the weight of this task for her.      Does this woman deserve the same pay for her position at the post office (if she denies performing the job obligations and requirements ; which include lifting packages of up to 70lbs) ?      Yes or No?

20090220144450AATE7pV	Social Science;Psychology	My theory of racism. What do you think?	I have this little theory going on. I've learned to get out of this "American bubble" and look at other countries, only because I had a little bit of an inspiration from this French exchange student.. But that's a different story.      Racism: A form of discrimination dealing with one's "Race" whether they are black, white, Hispanic, American Native, etc.       I've learned, and observed from watching the World Cup over the years, it seems that Europe has just as much, if not more racism as America. I was extremely ignorant to think that racism was an American thing, and that no other society has racist tendencies.       I believe racism exists because some people can't, and will not chose to understand a person of another color, creed, and all things different. I know you might be thinking "That's just an excuse to be racist." but in psychology, I learned that people tend to hate what they fear and vice versa, and that gets me thinking. Those certain people might not admit it, but it all bulls down to cowardice upon some levels.       I honestly don't understand why people are racist... We're all HUMANS. There really should be no such thing as "color" or "race".      I may have white skin, it does not hide nor change the fact that I am human. My friends may have tan or black skin, and it does not hide nor change the fact that he or she is human. We are all Homo Sapiens. Let's learn to accept the fellow man.

20090220144746AAVUgNH	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Yesterday I was watching a question and answer exchange between feminists here on GWS and they were ...?	... talking about whether the male regulars were 'as organised' as the female radical feminists are.      I was befuddled.      And then I held back and read some more.      By asking if the men here on GWS were 'organised' what the women meant was if the men 'club together' and destroy a person's account by ganging up and mass reporting him.      What was funny is that a radical feminist said:  "Yes the men are organised"      I have never heard that term before. It shows that the term 'organised' is a term used by feminists on this board to show that they communicate with each other in order to wreck other people's accounts.      It's odd.      Why would a group want to do away with people who disagree with them?  It's much smarter to change the other side's perception than just destroy them.      I think I may have proven a point that the feminists on this board are weak and they do - in fact - want to destroy any possibility of a discourse with men      'Organised'      What a childish and cowardly concept.

20090220131107AAojUQ7	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do you ever get the feeling every other person (you see everyday but)who doesnt interact with you is conceited?	I think we "cross" many people everyday, but we only get to know really know someone when we talk to them, not hearing rumors/stories about them.       I feel that most people are great to know, when you talk with them. But we might feel someone might not want to interact with us because they might think they are better than us. This may be because they might be more popular because of their beauty or something.       But I think every one is human, whether it's the most beautiful person you've come across. I think even most average looking men have a chance to be intimate friends/bf's of the most beautiful women in the world, because that's what happened to me.      I'm an average (not bad) looking guy, but have a pretty interesting personality. I thought this girl would be really conceited, because she was extremely beautiful; but was nevertheless the queen of my heart. We're going out now :)

It seems from what sociobiology teaches that a certain set of selfish, egotistic, macho values is what determines success and alternatives are doomed to failure. If this is true. And one disagrees with these values, why be bound to any will to live? Life is a gift? Open any newspaper. How can it be argued that living is preferable to a dreamless sleep?

I think that as long as your happy it shouldn't matter right?   ..but then why does it bother other people.. have they got self esteem issues by putting other people down?      If I see someone else who is sure of themselves I don't judge them, I just live and let live.. I got my own worries to worry about and not to get wrapped up in the way people behave, unless they are rude, which is blatantly obvious to anyone anyway!! ... so long as that person is nice.. who cares!?....
20090220140145AA0xbMC	Social Science;Psychology	Possible repressed memories of being molested as a child..?	Please get your 2 points some where else.      I've always had an inkling that my father (biological, whose own father sexually abused his two daughters) used to molest me as a child. His personality is obsessive and controlling. As I got older (now 20) I became more and more uncomfortable around him. I felt the need to hide my body from him. Recently my mother let it slip that my aunt (father's sister) accused my father of such acts but my Mom dismissed it and won't talk to me about it. She says that my aunt is just crazy. Which is partly true, she's a drug addict and a drama queen. But just today I tried to ask her and she stutters out that its nothing, nothing happened. Which only adds to my assumptions.      However I feel that there is no reason to accuse my father of molesting me if nothing happened, because that is very serious. But after my mother said those words, I felt a confirmation in my inklings.   I never liked the way he holds my niece, (his step-granddaughter). I started to look up the meanings of my dreams, as I used to have vivid dreams of being chased and murdered, and read that this means possible child abuse. I've become obsessed and paranoid about the possibility. Part of me feels that it did happen, but I have no memory of it. And when I try to think of myself at a young age, I have no memories, a few scattered and very short memories that end abruptly.       Like I said I always had an inkling. My father always seemed to know everything. I know he is very nosy. Always searching through my room (and my brother's), and I work at his office, which he watches me on his cameras. We also have cameras in the house (where I no longer live) and wonder what other types of surveillance he has. I'm afraid to go to anyone because they'll dismiss it and think I'm the crazy one.   I have a work jacket with the logo and everything, that must have been replaced recently because of its new condition. My mother and father denied everything, but I still do not believe either on of them.   I was also raped when I was 14, my mother said nothing, my father said he would "take care of him". (Which he did not, he's contacted me and searched me out several times since then..six years ago.)      I know I typed a lot.. but I tried to give as much info as I could so this wont keep getting played off as "nothing". If nothing happened, why am I always worried. I'm afraid that he's seeing this now!! This is no way to live. And I don't want to hate my father for nothing, but I ..think I'm strong enough to handle the truth and say good bye. He may pay for everything (like my car/gas/phone) but I don't want to be his daughter if he never treated me like one.

20090220144250AAe6Xyx	Social Science;Psychology	Please read this, I don't know what else to do any more...?	My Mother's acting like a total cow. I'm 14 years old and she's 33. I'm so sick of her bullsh*t, she gives out constantly that I disrespect her and a few minutes ago she confiscated my phone and threatened to send me away, for reasons I'll explain in a minute.      She's just come back from a three-day trip to Paris, and since she got back she's been biting the head off me. [She didn't bring me with her because it's in the middle of the school year, that's fair enough, she said she'd bring me in the summer after my exams] She was out for dinner tonight and she came back, I was sitting on the sofa watching TV, and she started snapping at me, telling me to get up and let her sit down.      I don't know why I got angry, but I did. I can't remember exactly what I said, but I rolled my eyes and made a sarcastic comment like, "Yeah, you must really need to relax after your stressful holiday", and then I got up and left and went down to my room. I slammed my door after me.      She followed me down and grabbed my phone off my bed and started roaring at me, saying, "I work damn hard, I won't be spoken to like that, I raise you on my own and I don't have to take your cheek, I'm this close to making a call to get someone to look after you". I don't know what that meant but I think she means my father, I have serious problems with him that I don't want to get into here, I couldn't believe she'd even bring him up.       Then she took my phone with her and left. I'm not really annoyed that she went on holiday without me, but I hate the way that she can go off and be so relaxed and as long as she's having a good time everything's okay, but as soon as she comes back and she's not having a good time any more, if I do the slightest thing wrong, she goes nuts. She's such a narcissist. She thinks that just because she's a single parent, it means that everyone has to worship her.      I don't mean this in a bad way, but it's not like I asked to be born. I don't make it hard on her. I don't drink or smoke or do drugs, I get really good grades. I'm not a troublesome kid, and that's the honest truth.      I have enough on my plate without her being such a b*tch for no apparent reason. Can someone please help me to deal with her?

Like if i'm spending the night at a friends house, i always make sure i'm not the only one spending the night.  I rarely go by myself.  I'm not sure why i'm like this!

And i was diagnosed when i was around 11 or 12, i'm now 15.  I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it; but it might so i'm telling you.

Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) are an alternative to traditional fixed-rate mortgages in which payments are fixed in dollar terms.  With an adjustable-rate mortgage, the interest rate changes every year, depending on the movement of an index of interest rate in the market.  Are adjustable-rate mortgages beneficial to homeowners or to the banks (or other financial intermediaries) that offer them?
