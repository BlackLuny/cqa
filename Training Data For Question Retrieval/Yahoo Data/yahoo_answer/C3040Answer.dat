AA11452852	Probably.  You can deduct the lost value of your house from the fire, or the cost of repairs.  However,    1.  You must itemize your deductions to be able to claim a "casualty loss"    2.  There are limits on what you can deduct, based on your income    3.  (Most important), you are not entitled to a deduction for whatever your insurance company paid.  In other words, if the fire did $10,000 worth of damage, and the insurance company gave you $7,500, then the most you can deduct is $2,500.    I'm sorry for your loss, and I hope this helps.  Good luck!!

Plus, the minimum age to work is 16 years old in Sacramento.|`|AA10906062	What about dog walking service ? Pet sitting ? Mowing lawns ? Housekeeping ? Babysitting ? You can place ads on local church bulletins. Good luck and sounds like you have a really nice Nana.|`|GmHlk8Iqaa	Baby sitting is a fantastic way to earn cash. Once people find a baby sitter that they can trust they keep them. <br>  <br>  If you rack up three families to babysit for, there going to keep you far after you've earned enough for your trip. That's the best thing for someone of your age.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work you can always try selling limeade. :-)|`|wlVqU2EBaa	If you like kids, try babysitting - theres always lots of opportunity for that.|`|EbrZy7JUaa	aw im sry bout ur parents, but im sure u have an amazing nana. :)|`|bru2xnlRaa	Any work you do and earn money is a JOB. <br>  Your options are limited. Most businesses want you to be 16 to hire you for gainful employment. <br>  <br>  Time to be inventive, <br>  My suggestions to you:<br>  <br>  Make up fliers and pass them around in your neighborhood. <br>  Offer to do whatever work it is you want to do, such as :<br>  <br>  Computer work, Babysit, Clean Garages, Organize Cupboards, File Papers, Wash Cars, Mow Lawns, Pull Weeds, Tutor the neighbors kids, wash Dogs, Dog sit, Clean the Pool, Assist the elderly, whatever... <br>  <br>  <br>  Post first whatever it is you want to do or are good at ...<br>  However, You should keep your options open and make a decision after the persons call you instead of not giving them many reasons to call.<br>  <br>  Your neighbors who might hire you do not have to be residents, they might be local businesses that need a little job done. Do not be afraid to ask and apply. You won't get a job if you don't try.

M9mjCEQpaa	The only place I can think of would be Richmond Ave.  I haven't been to clubs in like 10 years.  I know that the strip on Richmond has a lot of different things like the Daiquri Factory (not sure if it is still open), Sam's Boat, Dave and Busters, and I am pretty sure there is a Country bar down there and a couple of others.  I am not sure where you are coming from but if you go to the websites of some of these clubs they will tell you where they are located and when you have time you can drive up and down Richmond on a week night so that you can decide where you want to park and walk from...we use to drive when I was younger, its all a short distance from each other, but I don't know what is there now and what isn't.  My friend is getting married soon too and we are doing the Bachlorette thing too and we were going to all pitch in and get a limo so we could go all over Houston, but then she decided she wanted to go to a Comedy club.  So the tickets are free and we can drink there.  We are all 30 though, so I don't know if that is your cup of tea or not. The majority of us are all married and the club scene is not what we like to do anymore. We go to the Comedy show and have a few drinks (we have a designated driver) and we go home after that. So just some suggestions.

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	It depends which course best suits your career plan, having done a few Management courses in the past, and a postgraduate course 5 years ago in management, I think that the International Management course would have the most benefits with a wider area of expertise.<br>  <br>  That's just my opinion, which to be honest isn't worth a lot. <br>  Your choice is picking the best course for you, compare the prospectus from each course, decide which is best for you.  <br>  <br>  Each Uni must be having Open days soon for new students, go and find out, have a look around. <br>  Search the web for the student union blog, most uni's have them, you can find out a lot of information about courses and how good they are from the students themselves.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your decision.|`|6oSCCqYcaa	Cardiff

QAIc4VVPaa	well i was thinking just by watching others and my own past is this. why dont you try to help your neighbors with things that they need help with. isnt there a family that both or the only parent is always working and do not have any time to mow their yard,water their garden,maybe even cleaning the house. i did this when i was a kid. they are great people to have for references when you are older and may want to work in the same type of job that they do. they are the ones that need time to pay for their bills and you are the one to help them do that.|`|IIwhkNZuaa	14 is really young to be getting a job.
