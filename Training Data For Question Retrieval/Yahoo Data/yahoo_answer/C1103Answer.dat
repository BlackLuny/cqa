o1Gg8HOOaa	I always shop alone! It is best that way. I get way more done. It sucks when you are trying to find good bargains and you have someone else with you waiting on you or you on them. <br>  I enjoy shopping alone.|`|igrdohopaa	I do it all the time. I hate it when people are rushing me (=<br>  I like to go around and take my time.|`|jKA8SovQaa	yes :P <br>  its funn ^_^<br>  do you ?  :P|`|uDOVf2vvaa	I almost always go alone if I am doing a lot of shopping. It saves time because you can go where ever you want and not have to waste time waiting on others to try on things. But I'll go with my friends if they ask and I'll just be a companion and help them.|`|6359LQLNaa	once in a while.<br>  actually its sometimes kind of relaxing. you get to go shopping for yourself and you don't have your friend going "yeah...its cute" but you can tell that they don't like it so you don't want to get it. <br>  plus you can look at what you want not what others want to look at|`|kmAMgkiraa	Yep. It's actually nicer. It's more relaxing and you save time and don't get dragged else where. You should try it! You'll probably feel nice and relaxed when you're all finished.|`|Dd9Lc3tDaa	Yeah, sometimes I just need something and I don't want to waste time.|`|iPje1iyGaa	Yes, I go shopping alone quite frequently.  It's actually a lot of fun!  I tend to find what I want much more quickly, and everytime I go alone, I am less afraid to do other stuff by myself, too!|`|m2bSgeRWaa	i do. i go to the mall with my mom and we go to different stores and stuff and then we meet @ a certain time @ a certain place

QBV4cFbqaa	I love all types of jewelry. You should look into fashion magazines to see what is in this season and the next. Look for inspirations. I would love to see you make some long necklaces and with a little charm at the end. Right now the big thing is chunky exaggerated jewelry<br>  that ranges from cuffs to necklaces.Hope i helped a bit. You can always visit my fashion blog.

QibZyzPmaa	Wear fitted dress with high heels a great great thing for you|`|71204fadefeb0aef75f4761be2bfbc09aa	Hey!<br>  I did a study on height so I know a lot about this.<br>  It would be helpful to know your age and height because some things are not right for everyone.<br>  As a general rule, wear fitted clothes, not baggy ones. Wear v-necked tops and shirts, not round-necked. Don't wear low-rise pants or tops that go past your waist. With skirts either go short or long. And as a lot of other people have said you can wear shoes that give you extra height (although it doesn't have to be heels!)<br>  I have loads more detail and if you want more individual advice you can just contact me through my profile. I'd be happy to help.<br>  Simon<br>  ;-)|`|C8AgEq3Aaa	Monochrome outfits help your body look longer and leaner. The secret is to use one color in many different tones and you have created a monochromatic look. If you love colour then with a monochromatic look you can also wear colours.<br>  <br>  No Horizontal Stripes: They make you appear wider and shorter because they cause the visual illusion of added width. Instead choose vertical stripes, which make you look longer and, leaner. <br>  <br>  Elongate your body: Most of us are not very tall, so try to elongate your body to look slimmer and also to add extra length. Use pants to cover your shoes...............<br>  <br>  Check this link on how to look slimmer and taller: <a href="http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2008/11/look-slimmer-with-smart-dressing.html" rel="nofollow">http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2008/11...</a>|`|iPje1iyGaa	1.  Wear tighter clothing - this helps to emphasize your lines ultimately making you look taller<br>  <br>  2. Avoid capris or bermuda shorts - these make your legs look shorter and stumpy<br>  <br>  3. Wear medium heels - flats make you look shorter and high heels make you look like you're trying too hard<br>  <br>  4. Wear dark jeans - avoid flare leg, stick to boot cut, straight, or skinny<br>  <br>  5. Wear long shirts - this makes your torso look longer... but don't go too long because then you'll shorten the look of your legs<br>  <br>  6. Choose darker clothing - darker clothes make you look skinnier, thereby making you appear taller<br>  <br>  7. Layer - wear darker colored v-necks over tank tops<br>  <br>  8. Wear your hair shorter - long haired styles draw the eye to the length of the hair, making the rest of you look shorter<br>  <br>  9. Wear stripes - especially vertical ones, and test whether skinny stripes or wider stripes work better for you<br>  <br>  10. Emphasize your best feature with bright colors - just remember to match it with dark colored clothing|`|Ys0kV4O8aa	High heels are a great great thing! But, if you're short, dont wear big clothes that drown you, wear nice fitted ones, skinny jeans are a great way to look talller. But i'd invest in the heels.|`|xQGCf8GGaa	whts ur age?<br>  if under 18 u need excercise like cycling and swimming to increase ur height<br>  u should wear high heel shoes or sandals what ever girls tells that thing<br>  salwar and jeans|`|6359LQLNaa	pinstripes.<br>  heels.<br>  long shirts|`|f5NXsiayaa	You can wear those long shirts, with leggings, and heels. You can wear any kinds of heels, and you can wear wedges heels. You can wear skinny jeans (if you don;t want to wear leggings.) You might be uncomfortable wearing really tight clothes, so you should wear perfect sized clothes. If you like dresses (sun-dress) you can wear them with flats with a little heel, or bigger heels. You can get those shirts with a built in belts like underneath you breasts, and make sure it's not loose, or realy,really tight. And hopfully it works out for you!|`|eVubSKcEaa	Try tops that have full sleeves or very short sleeves/sleeveless.. dont wear looser clothes.. also try body fit jeans.. use high heels or platform shoes.. these will emphasise your height..<br>  dont let height bother you.. even shorter girls look really good...|`|WW66AkgJaa	long shirts and skinny leg jeans. and wear jeans that over heels half way so you can wear heels and look tall without everyone knowing.|`|m2bSgeRWaa	tunic tops and leggings<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  skinny jeans with a bright colored top|`|rSaD6d8Gaa	Wear clothes with vertical lines.Wear deep necked dress.Use high heels.Deck your hair in a knot

XlmvIBiAaa	I used a similar bag all through college. I hated back packs.  Anyway, wear the bag just right around your waist level in a position that is high enough so that your legs or butt aren't causing the bag to bounce around and bang against your body.  If you wear it near your knees you are going to trip! LOL  By the way, those bags are not the best for your back because the weight of your books are not distributed as equally as they would if you were wearing both straps on a conventional back pack.  That is the price of fashion I guess.|`|FWor7uTaaa	my opinion  is that you should wear it at your waist. By my experience it looks better than the bag all the way down by your knees. Also if it is by your knees the weight is added on which can be difficult and it can be difficult to walk|`|tu5BHpe8aa	Well,<br>  I like shoulder bags are cool.

It doesn't streak or make you orange. it comes out like a white cream and blends into your skin. The first time I used it I was skeptical and put way too much.

Trust me, I wasn't sure about that feature but am so satisfied with this product.|`|KpO4UtElaa	use the jergens natural glow. they have one for fair skin. it does the tanning gradually and it won't make you orange.
VdZJ7nJQaa	Tattoos on the wrist don't hurt too bad. Mine took 3 hours and I handled it fine. Are u sure you want a heartogram?

Just really make sure you know exactly what u want. Goodluck!|`|BJERgbM5aa	I love it.  Very unusual.  Sort of like a star with a heart.  Maybe that's what  you and your sister, stars with a heart.  Or even like the Star of David with a heart.  Even more significant.  anyway, the application process on the wrist is uncomfortable, but not what I would classify as painful.  Good Luck.|`|gW8VFRmjaa	you should be fine. i have tattoos on the inside of each wrist and i dont think i take pain too well and i was fine.|`|rOj4B5QNaa	Make sure that you love H.I.M. enough to have to defend your music choice that you made when you are however old you may be right now.  I think the heartagram is an ok symbol, but not something I would personally want.  On the wrist it's pretty easy.  Feels a bit funky going over veins, but I'm guessing that the tattoo wouldn't take very long and you should be able to deal with it for 30 mins or so.|`|k3V1Hn5Kaa	It hurts for a while but it'll eventually go away. Make sure that you want that tattoo because if in a couple of years you don't like it anymore it hurts a lot to get it removed. trust me (my cusin)|`|OehjuDxVaa	Come on, the heartagram?|`|NffE7Nz8aa	Just think, a heartogram might mean a lot now, but what about when you're older and possibly grown out of that phase?<br>  Plus, it's not that original.|`|w8AyVsjRaa	For your tattoo are you getting just the black part done?

63b55743beb7a12e37d89fb0e78f29a3aa	yep my bf likes it that way|`|56KYR6WAaa	Ilike to shave that way.Its also landing pad lol|`|b3586153c230af1842263c5f9b44fa97aa	Generally it is a pubic shave that leaves only a strip of hair running in a downward direction. Hence fourth called a landing strip. Me personally I don't care for shaving, because new hair growth tends to itch, and sometimes shaving causes a rash. I would only recommend trimming and shaping. But lots of people consider it a part of grooming.<br>  Be careful if you try it, not a place you to nick yourself.|`|w8AyVsjRaa	I'm not very hairy at all so I only shave my arm pits and legs on my legs i guess i shave in upward motions and my arm pits just anything to get the hair LOL|`|Mj9laiM3aa	A strip of pubic hair that goes to your crack.

GHZ3fZlsaa	No natural skin care product would have anything like Benzoyl Peroxide in it....it is a nasty chemical irritant used to bleach hair or whiten teeth - the last thing you should do is put it on your skin.<br>  <br>  If you don't get a bad reaction to it, it will whiten your skin and dry it out - check your pillows, if they weren't white to start with, they probably are now!<br>  <br>  Any product you move to will probably take your skin a couple of weeks to adjust to, so if you get a breakout, it probably isn't the new product or lack of the old...just part of the process.<br>  <br>  Natural products are great for anyone with acne - I'd suggest starting off with one formulated for sensitive skin, then as your skin improves, move to one that suits your skin type - e.g. one for T-Zone/ Combination skin.<br>  <br>  Consider using a cream cleanser instead of a facial wash and don't overwash your skin with harsh detergents or soap.<br>  <br>  I always use Pai...and frequently recommend it...so look at their Chamomile & Rosehip Sensitive Cream to start:<br>  <a href="http://www.paiskincare.com/product_details_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.paiskincare.com/product_detai...</a><br>  <br>  And then move onto a different one once your skin has settled, such as the Geranium & Thistle Combination Skin moisturizer:<br>  <a href="http://www.paiskincare.com/product_details_3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.paiskincare.com/product_detai...</a>|`|1TwS77Jnaa	There is a new product launced recently from<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.koreintact.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.koreintact.com.au/</a><br>  <br>  Apparently it contains Colostrum which is in the breast milk used for new borns.<br>  <br>  Have a read on the website as it is quite intresting how it was developed.|`|dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Stick with using creams - they are better than any natural remedies, honestly. Apart from drinking lots of water, there's not much natural that is going to help your spots.<br>  <br>  Stick with ProActive, or if you want something cheaper, try Quinoderm which contains benzoyl peroxide too and works really well for me.<br>  <br>  I hope that answered your question.

Doubly so if it's an armband.<br>  <br>  Why do you want a badass tattoo?  Why not get one that you like or one that represents who you are?|`|8EkxqqAbaa	Tacky, stupid, typical, boring.....<br>  <br>  Try something unique.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	I think if you're going to get a tattoo that you should try for something original and meaningful.  Barbed wire is way over done and was most popular years ago.  Meet with an artist, tell him what you like, what you don't like, what you're trying to do looks-wise, and get his ideas -- he'll be able to draw something up for you that will be uniquely you rather than a knock off of others.  Barbed wire can be cool when incorporated into an  otherwise unique piece of artwork.  But I just think it's so commonplace because it's been used so much that I'd rather have something different.|`|rOj4B5QNaa	I think the exact opposite of badass.  If you want to be respected in the tattoo community then you don't do cliche tattoos of that nature.  Almost everything is over done when it comes to tattoos, but barb wire falls into the same categories as tribal, butterfly w/ tribal on the lower back, etc.  They are unoriginal, and there isn't anything artistic about them.  I prefer my tattoos to be feminine, but to each their own!|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	that fad died out in the early 90s (just a guess...I was young)<br>  so out of your choices...stupid and super tacky would be my votes<br>  <br>  <br>  also, the fact that you're just trying to look "badass/tough" means that the tattoo will almost certainly have the opposite result<br>  <br>  also.....you're 17 and you spell like you're 13....I really hope you sit on whatever idea you pick out, for at least a year|`|6zblh7Tiaa	Tattoos don't make you bad-*** or tough, being tough makes you tough. How bad-*** are you when your on the ground picking up your teeth cause you thought you were tough.|`|d185f39553435f17970e180ddffe3d53aa	I think "How un-original" and I wonder how many people out there are walking around with the exact same tattoo.|`|SQ39aHSoaa	I personally wouldn't like a barb wire tattoo on a woman's upper arm because to me it just doesn't seem to be very girl/woman like.  Pamela Anderson has one.....what do you think?|`|0ef851000b538b263ac2c3058c608291aa	sorry to tell you, but its super tacky, and sooo 1990s. come up with something unique.|`|k3V1Hn5Kaa	tacky, sorry.|`|d9B4EVFxaa	Personally when I see barbwire on anyone I think it looks tacky and ridiculous!!! Sorry to tell you no tattoo will ever make you tough or bad-***!! You yourself will make you tough or bad-***...like someone else said how bad-*** are you going to feel when your picking up teeth because you "thought" you were tough!! <br>  <br>  I'm not going to say you shouldn't get a tattoo because of your age because I got my first tattoo at 16 second at 17...but I put lots of thought into my tattoos and they mean something to me...I didn't get them to try and portray an image!!! <br>  <br>  So if your serious about getting a tattoo defiantly do some more thinking and get something original!!|`|XYIijuE8aa	Remember a tattoo at 17 will not be the same when you are 30 and have your own children . Will they think of mom as a bad ***/ tough girl or stupid?. So your tattoo should be something you can live with the rest of your life or can change. good luck|`|1eQjDsNraa	It's your body, girl! If it fits you then get it. Who cares what everyone else thinks? I'm not much for barbies and manicures and other girly stuff so if want a tattoo that mostly is done on men, I would get it, but like I said: Make your own decisoin.|`|NffE7Nz8aa	I think they look tacky and unoriginal<br>  Not tough or badass at all.<br>  Get something that actually means something|`|w8AyVsjRaa	It depends on your size. If I see that kind of tattoo on a larger girl (big boned) I get kinda scared but on anyone else it can look kinda tough but also cute no tacky don't worry :)|`|MP1nA5fRaa	TACKY|`|qNOeBcvraa	it makes me think of pam anderson. get something original!!!!!!!!|`|08ff27fe3110ddd7da36736daaf4c2dfaa	be original about it. its going to be there for the rest of your life.|`|B3Sree53aa	i don't like it on anyone.
8aab8899dd193ce67ce616064d6e4fb9aa	Yeah, after a warm shower, you should have a blast under the cold for ten seconds as thins closes the pores.<br>  It works the other way round to having a hot steamy bath, as thins opens your pores, making them easier to pluck eyebrows<br>  To help this, also switch your foundation to a liquid hypo allergenic foundation, this will not clog them, and should help them reduce back to their normal size|`|bf3ee8e740da5b4ef76fa104d1e49f7eaa	You can get/give yourself a professional facial. Washing your face and using a toner often cleans the pores. Clean pores look smaller because they don't have anything in them to make them appear larger. You can also apply a mask that is known to shrink pores. Also, cold can help pores shrink because your skin/pores tightens to keep in heat. So running ice across the area may help before apply makeup. I hope I have helped atleast a little.|`|G7YBTbN7aa	wear make up??<br>  <br>  <><a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220105824AAhGN8H>" rel="nofollow">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|WcINQ0aBaa	when ur done taking a shower wash ur face with COLD water <br>  that way your pores can close! ; )|`|BhEVhdvDaa	There are lots of products out there that can help minimize pores.

They're really helpful and skincare is their nitch. Good luck!|`|uy6HXzSPaa	you should boil water and put your face over the steam, that will open your pores up, and then wash your face with hot water so they stay open and they are cleansed, then just rinse your face with cold water. Or, what works even better is putting ice on your face. Your pores will looks smaller when they are closed up, but they cant close until they are clean.
bf3ee8e740da5b4ef76fa104d1e49f7eaa	Depends on the rate of growth for your hair. I have to wax every week and a half for bikini line and for eyebrows every 2 and a half weeks. <br>  To get waxed you need a minimum length of hair which is 1/4 an inch.|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	Every thirteen minutes should do the trick.|`|jBIaUfUzaa	i usually wax once a week
WLuEIwp5aa	It might be.  It's usually a week before I can wear normal clothes over healing tattoos, but it'll probably be okay.|`|eGMe5qknaa	In the past I have covered my tats with cream and then tape on gauze. The gauze is easier to get off and the seeping doesnt wreck your clothes. I've done this a few times to help from ruining my dress clothes.

Have patience.
AA11461724	well in my experience, doing it yourself with box dye doesn't damage it as much as getting it done at the salon. hair dye is a tricky thing. store bought box dyes only come in 20 volume and don't lighten hair up all that much. they can only lighten hair 2 levels lighter than your natural color but you can make it as dark as you want. at salons, the dye is totally different. they come in red, green, blue, violet and gold bases. beauticians know what color and base to use for a particular client's hair and what volume of peroxide to use, such as 20, 30, 40 and even 50. you don't have as many options with box dye unless you really know what you're doing. if you want to make your hair more than 2 levels lighter than your natural color, you can still do it yourself. you can go to a beauty supply store like sally beauty and buy what you need there. say you have naturally medium ash brown brown hair and you want to go medium golden blonde. you would need to buy a bottle of blonde color with a gold base and some 30 or 40 volume peroxide, depending on your hair's texture. you would have to do a strand test first to see how long you have to time it and if the results are what you want. i know it sounds really intimidating, but all this can be done. i learned by trial, error and research. you can try store bought box dye if you want to stay close to your current color or darker than your current color, but if you want to go much lighter, you can go the way of sally beauty. if you have any questions, feel free to ask the girl there that knows most about hair dye. no matter what sally store location, she always knows a lot and helps out as much as she can until you are ready to purchase what you need. good luck!|`|099f9932fda7deca1bf90d1e23d79b0eaa	Going to a saloon will be better.|`|s32Z9oe3aa	No it does not damage your hair more than an in salon color but you should not try to go more than one shade lighter than your natural color with a box color but you can go up to 2 shades darker with a box color.  If you are trying to go more than one shade lighter box color does not have the proper amount of peroxide to lighten enough and look good.  If you are just trying to add aliittle color with out going lighter than you could try and simipermanante color that washes out in 28 shampoos.|`|YkNBotofaa	depends on the brand. <br>  <br>  loreal is the best. <br>  doesnt damage my hair. it actually makes it look nicer.<br>  my cousin gets her's done at a salon and hers looks really dry and frizzy. ]<br>  mine is soft and silky and i've dyed it many more times than her. <br>  [with l'oreal feria and superior perference]|`|wsC2g0Dbaa	It is all the same really. I have had my hair done both ways and as long as you don't dye your hair over and over and over again in a short period of time then your hair will be just as healthy.

2ZsRAxkuaa	Ditch the polysporin. nasty stuff.<br>  Sea salt is good, and should be all you need. How much salt are you using with how much water? 1/8tsp in a cup is a good one.<br>  You can also buy saline premixed in big bottles. Use twice a day.<br>  <br>  Satin or provon soap is about the only other thing you should use to clean with. But it isn't good for using too often.<br>  <br>  I don't think its infected though. Infections are actually pretty rare. They hurt like hell, lots of swelling and have dark yellow/green smelly pus. You'd know if you had an infection :)<br>  The only thing that will sort those is some broad spectrum anti-biotics from the doctors.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately it might be rejecting? Its a surface piercing, and pretty common. Go have your piercer take a look at it for you.|`|Au4gWgEiaa	I would be going back to where you got it pierced and have them check it out.  Don't use polysporin, it is probably not helping.  Continue cleaning it once a day, try not to touch it any other time.  You are using sea salt, correct?  How long are you soaking it for?  You should try to have it as warm as you can stand it without burning yourself and soak for at least 10 minutes or else you are just getting it wet.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like your body just does not want that piercing :(|`|8aab8899dd193ce67ce616064d6e4fb9aa	Evey self respecting piercer should always, always tell you to soak it in savlon every few hours.<br>  The kind in a clear, long blue bottle does it<br>  Spra spray spray spray every hour, infections really hurt whether on your belly button or your eyebrow|`|xCM9Xxaiaa	Get rid of the eyebrow piercing, cause most people dont find it attractive. Then go to the person who pierced it and say what the **** man

qOKFuXfLaa	No, I don't trust ebay when it comes to purchasing things like Makeup, purses, jewelry. My neighbor purchased a 42 piece set that claimed to be a MAC set but when she received it she knew it was fake. She kept them anyway and said the brushes shed more than her dog. She said some of the brushes broke off really easy and they smelled awful. She threw them out after 3 day use. <br>  <br>  Here are some tips to help determine if the ebay listing for the brushes is fake:<br>  <br>  1. When the brushes come in a set of 40 including a brush holder pouch (MAC does not have such pouch and never sell brushes as sets unless its for a holiday collection but the collections are usually 5 SMALL travel kit sized brushes.<br>  <br>  2. When the lister does not list the numbers of the brushes. Each one of MACs brushes has a name/number (ex: 239, 217, 242, 187). If the listing does not provide brush names/numbers then there is a big chance the brushes aren't real. <br>  <br>  3. The location of the buyer. Most fake items come from outside the USA (China, Taiwan, Singapore, Phillipines, etc) I would stay away from sellers in that area.|`|4A8lGwYJaa	some people say they are fakes.. but trust me it is like the real thing!! the only difference is that the mac letters are not engraved but they are real soft like the ones you buy at the mac store, and they are not expensive.
fCSGDpROaa	I would try putting a makeup primer like Urban Decay Primer Potion on before.<br>  <br>  You could also try setting it with a shadow the same color as the liner.<br>  <br>  Or try a new eyeliner all together.  I would try a gel liner since they stay on no matter what, like MAC's Fluidline or L'Oreal H.I.P. Gel Liners.|`|xT024KMsaa	It sounds like you just need a primer. I use Too Faced eye primer and my liner and shadow both last all day.|`|GOsRusM9aa	Try a waterproof eyeliner?|`|ReEac96jaa	use black eyeshadow to prime it or use it to set it (prime: put eyeshadow under liner)or(set:put shadow over liner|`|ALTGCqgFaa	im not sure if this might work but you can put  a thin line of black eyeshadow then put the eyeliner over it?|`|XJwiFPg5aa	i put liquid eyeliner on because it doesnt smudge|`|VlTGV9DUaa	make sure your face is oil free, use a matte pressed powder or loose powder, gently brush all over your face-concentrating on your eyelids and where the eyeliner will go.<br>  <br>  also liquid eyeliner stays on all day with no smudges so try that (but this CANT be used on the inside of the eye (the waterline)) just on the upper and lower lashlines. the best easiest to use liquid liner is Rimmel Exaggerate. ive tried loads of more expensive ones but this is the best, colour stays true all day with no smudging. it takes practice to get the line straight though but once u get the hang of it its easy!<br>  <br>  i wear it on my upper lashline with white pencil liner on my waterline to get this look:<br>  <a href="http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/37/l_347e67fcd99a4944800f29e6080502e7.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c4.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...</a>|`|o7JfhhLbaa	liquid eyeliner is the best thing it doesnt smuge or fade nd it is essy to put on.|`|qXHjguYiaa	I'm not positive but u could try a make up Primer...i hope this helps

HrDcaocMaa	If it's creative and a little intricate lettering we'd charge $75|`|WbKBHh8Haa	I have 2 letters and 2 numbers...$80.|`|T1CuRwm3aa	If you are charged more than $150 you are being over charged|`|SVuYaK8maa	I have two.  One on my lower back that took two hours to get is 12 incs by 12 inc. and that cost me around 200.00.<br>  <br>  My other that is a small rose is only about 4 inc. by maybe 3 inc.  That one took 60 due to the color.  would have been 40 if I did not get the tiny green leave.   <br>  <br>  It depends on the place you go.  Don't just walk in and do it.  Get to know the person-people who do it.  If you feel it's not placed right tell them.  After you get poked you can not go back.  Make up only coves it so much.  If you need place it on you with a marker.  Keep it their for a week and see how you feel.  I love mine and was well worth the money and pain.  I also knew both people who did it to me.  Don't be scared of them.  If you are you will bleed more and maybe shake.   <br>  <br>  Best luck my sweet.|`|HJjo8sHRaa	i hate to not give you the best answer but honestly it depends on what size and if you happen to call a tattoo place they will most likely tell you that they need to know exactly what size it is also it depends on where your going some shops are more expensive or cheaper than others im thinking a rough 40--60 but im not sure<br>  <br>  <br>  best answer quality fo sho *|`|qNOeBcvraa	at the shop i worked at they would charge 60 at the least for anything. depending on detail size and color..   60_100|`|bEOHVM1Faa	Depends on the size of the tattoo.

Think about potential jobs, church, funerals, meeting new people, and first impressions you could make.  Some people judge others by first impressions, and some people really don't like tattoos.  I suggest you think about all of your options and your future.  Try the inside of your ankle or the top of your foot.  I have one on each of those places.

I always wanted one, so he paid for mine as a birthday present. I absolutely LOVE it! It is pretty small (about 2" by 2") and I'll explain why. <br>  <br>  I had two of my girl friends go with me. The shop is about 45 minutes from my home, so we had a lot of time to discuss the upcoming event. I wasn't too nervous to start out because my husband had gotten his 2 most recent tats from the same guy and told me that he was very gentle. However, by the time we got to the shop, my friends were VERY nervous and it had rubbed off on me (a little). <br>  <br>  I wasn't sure of the exact tat I was going to get, but I had a general idea of what I wanted. I knew I wanted a butterfly, so I was standing there looking at the pictures on the wall when Mr. Bill (the tatoo artist) turned on the [tattoo machine]. That freaked me out! So, I told my friends I was going to get this little tiny one (about the size of a dime). Almost immediately I thought "No, I can't be that big of a wuss!" So, I settled on the one I have now--not too little, but not too big, just in case it hurt too bad!:) <br>  <br>  I sat down in the chair, Mr. Bill adjusted me so he could reach my shoulder (which is where I got it) and he started. He was really wonderful! He explained everything to me as he was doing it and I actually sat there and talked and joked with my friends the whole time. It only took about 1/2 hour and when it was all over, I wished I had picked one a bit bigger! But that's OK because I'm going back this year to get another one for my next birthday! <br>  <br>  Mr. Bill asked me when I sat down if this was my first tatoo. When I said yes he informed me, "Well that's OK, it won't be your last." Never were truer words spoken! <br>  <br>  For all those who are thinking about getting your first tattoo, I have some advice. First, make sure you REALLY want it! Second, make sure you choose carefully. Third, make sure you go to an extremely clean and reputable artist! Fourth, if you are worried about the pain--I don't know what to tell you. Only you know how high your tolerance is for pain, but I can tell you from my experience, the only discomfort (I won't even call it pain) I felt was when he was doing the outline of the tat, after that there was nothing! Also, if you have ever given birth to a child or went through a minor surgery--you should be able to fly through a tatoo!!! Good Luck!! I hope my story helped you out some.

I have really thick long hair &  have always struggled with a good straightener at a low price.  I finally gave in & when to Sally Hansen store & purchased a $45-$55 straightener called Titanium Tools.  It has a thick base so it doesn't take for ever to do all your strands vs. chi or all those smaller ones.  It also has a more rounded edge so it doesn't pull your hair much.  Everytime I straighten my hair with it, (and its been over a year I  have had it) my hair looks good in pictures & I live in a humid area so my hair doesn't tend to stay straight long.

SQv8DGb7aa	It sounds like something i use to get. The best thing to do if you cant afford a manicure (we all trying to beat the credit crunch) is buy the following:<br>  <br>  1) Cuticle nipper - used to nip off the dry skinny bits next to your nails.   <br>                         Dont chop off anything the looks like living skin or <br>                         cuticle, only the dry bits. It doesnt hurt! Any do not try<br>                         and chew them off with your teeth!

kCdISEGqaa	Yeah, scars can be tattooed over, but texturally, they still feel and look like a scar on the surface, just tattooed.  Make sure you go an experienced artist, some artists may end up making it worse and causing your body to reject the ink.  It should be fine though.  Is it a keloid, a raised scar?  That would hinder the possibilities.  One thing to keep in mind, when doing a tattoo over scars, some artists will make you pay for touch ups since the skin is damaged and may not take ink well.  I say go and ask, it's not going to hurt anything.  Best wishes!|`|7f470211cac73cf1d4d69ada59f60764aa	Typically, tattooing over scar tissue isn't much different from tattooing over unmarred skin, but you should talk to an artist beforehand. If it was that long ago, you should be fine; worst case scenario, the artist has to go over that spot more than just once or twice, and you might need a touch-up.|`|xc8bnpCvaa	I WOULD TALK TO AN ARTIST ABOUT THE RISKS/PROBLEMS THAT MAY OCCUR BEFORE YOU DO IT IT. BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY.|`|qNOeBcvraa	it all depends on he scar! you have to let them take a look at it. but its an iffy situation!! b cautious
HQmAP5EVaa	stick to the salon relaxer.. wait for your stylist to be a available and make an appointment or make an appointment with another stylist at that salon. your friend who went to cosmetology school should know better than to use a store bought relaxer. The chemicals in a relaxer are not always the same and when mixed can cause a 'chemical haircut' which basically means your hair will break off where the relaxers are overlapped. So stick with your salon relaxer.|`|MzIDFWYPaa	I never had a relaxer in my hair before but ive heard of the Dr miracle relaxer I think it should be fine if you want it now instead wait for your stylist it doesnt hurt to try new things you may like it more then the salon relaxer give it a try C=<br>  message me && tell me how it works I wanna try it<br>  Thanks

8cttUra2aa	wat about it? wat do i think about it? i absoulutley hate it!!!!! if i went 2 a skool with a uniform i would die!!!! forcing people 2 all dress the same is horrible. every1 should have thier own personal style and personality. everything is so bland with uniforms. at least its kind of getting more uncommon these days 2 have uniforms. NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WEAR A UNIFORM!!|`|nOVSf06Raa	Good idea this way everyone will be the same ,no more competition among students and cheaper for the parents as well .|`|l0xnIquFaa	i think uniforms are stupid. my school just inforced them last year but we only have to wear them on wensdays (stupid ik), good thing im in 8th grade. my class is throwing a 'uniform burning' party at the end of the year. i cant wait!|`|a7a9c9857b51d02851d336bf7020c2cdaa	I wore a uniform to school for twelve years and loved it. You can still express your personal style with shoes, and jewelry, or hair accessories. And a lot of times there would be out-of-uniform days when you can wear whatever as long as it was appropriate. You never had to worry about what others were gonna say about your outfit, and it took me like two minutes to get ready in the morning. But I also went to an all girls catholic high school, so I never really cared about how I looked. Where I am from there are a lot of catholic all-girls or all-boys high schools, so it's normal for me.|`|ugng770raa	What about it?!<br>  It's not that bad, I've had it for 11 years :)|`|XobTPu26aa	HUH??|`|7TqqVP4Laa	If you mean what I think about it, it really isn't bad :)<br>  <br>  It doesn't eliminate the whole i-have-better-clothes-than-you thing, because people use juicy couture school supplies and earrings to show how much money they have, but it cuts down on dressup time :)<br>  <br>  It also hids little fat pooches under our shirts, which is FANTABULOUS, especially when you are bloated -- that is my favorite part of the uniforms<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, everyone thinks that school girls look adorable, and if that is not what you are looking for, there is always a way to make it look sexier!!! Roll your skirt and tease your hair -- BOY MAGNET!!! :)|`|VWZPAWUMaa	I loved my uniforms! Especially the one in high school. What I didn't like was having to pull my shirt from under it (it was more like a dress that separate pieces). Loved it! In Puerto Rico, children are mandated to wear uniforms, so I really don't know what the big deal is. it gives a sense of security: if someone sees you, they can tell from what school you are and if you go missing, they might be able to help.

I did a quick search and there are several listings for 'One Source Talent' but I wasn't sure where your agency is located. There was one listing in Beverly Hills and that particular location received an F. So beware1 Any time you are looking to start doing business with a company that you are unsure of, it is important to look at the Better Business Bureau website, especially when a lot of money is involved.<br>  Using BBB, see if you can find a reputable talent agency that will get you results.

My hair is flat and needs a lot of volume, and the straightener helps give it to me. You should probably buy a different flat iron. Get one that is AT LEAST 1 inch, because those are best for thick hair. The best straightener for your type of hair, would be the Conair Nano Silver. It is about 100 dollars. It has a built in comb to get tangles out, a steamer, 5 different heat settings, and also you can put water in it, to give your hair a shiny and healthy look. IT WILL NOT make your hair frizzy, even if you use water with it. It locks the moisture into your hair. My best friend has very thick wavy frizzy hair, and I use this straightener on her every time she comes over, she loves it!!|`|pltf2teCaa	The best bet for you would be to first off, buy a good straightener. A Chi, is by far the best one. Go to Amazon.com and they have decent prices on them. When you get your hair cut, get it thinned with a razor (not the thinning scissors - it makes your hair look bad). I also have very thick, curly hair and these 2 things make my hair so much better. Also, when you straighten your hair, separate into sections for better straightening. And it can also help if you blow dry it straight w/ a round brush before straightening.|`|2618b27ee1b1bc95bede9c4c3e930725aa	Pantene shampoo, straight and sleek, it's fantastic, and I'm sure they do other straight and sleek products aswell xxx|`|cS5ynTJIaa	use less conditioner it stops flluffyness &Friz<br>  also try a ionic hairdrier.<br>  hope it helps.|`|ABMvstsaaa	Get GHD's there alot better ...straightens your hair quickly and stays straight 4 a longgggg time|`|4WReav26aa	I'll swap mine for yours any day.|`|pBMRDqGiaa	try straighning shampoos lyk lee stafford poker straight...<br>  that one really works for mee    <br>  hopee i  helped..X;|`|6lkNOFNlaa	I'm not irish or celtic but I have puffy hair too and whenever I straighten it, it doesn't stay straight.

xc8bnpCvaa	If you tell the person doing your pedi that you have a new tattoo, and don't soak or scrub that foot I think it would be ok. You will just have one foot that is prettier than the other.

qOKFuXfLaa	liquid and powder foundation is best when applied with a brush. <br>  using your fingers can cause the foundation to cake or look uneven.<br>  to be honest, i do not like the foundation brushes because they can cake up the face. i like using a stippling brush (for either liquid or powder foundation). i use powder foundation and apply it with a stippling brush (aka, a skunk brush). <br>  <br>  <br>  the white part of the brush picks up the right amount of foundation and the black part of the brush gives an even smooth look|`|CTZQbwdRaa	Fingers I think.

Instead of smearing it on your face, pat it instead. It will make you have better coverage. Try not to put foundation on every area of your face. If you have to, then pat it in until it dissapears into your skin. You have to KEEP PATTING IT for at least 5 minutes or you will have an uneven skin tone. After you do this, take a big make up brush, and blend powder all over your face AND neck. Just make sure its the same color.|`|Ps5rsLyeaa	I've heard the best way to apply powder foundation is to apply it with your fingers.. Yes the brush can come in handy... but I've heard from quite a few people that it makes your skin uneven while using the brush so many people just apply it with their hands.|`|42LovADyaa	powder with a brush cause it works great and its not messy and liquid dont use a sponge cause it soaks up all the make up and you will go threw it like 5 times faster, just use your hands..clean hands ha|`|nfQhsRvfaa	Don't listen to her. Use a foundation brush it goes on flawless.|`|IzNAgdleaa	There is no best way, but the most natural way I find is with your fingers - if you make sure they are clean, or with a makeup sponge.<br>  <br>  A foundation makeup brush works really well as well and is more sanitary than a sponge, since you can really get all the makeup out (you should wash it once weekly).<br>  <br>  The best way to keep it from looking blotchy is to exfoliate beforehand and apply a fair amount of moisturizer. Instead of rubbing the moisturizer in and then applying your foundation, apply the foundation over it - the combination of both will make the texture more sheer and blend it in a lot better.<br>  <br>  Here's a good foundation that blends well :<br>  <a href="http://www.covergirl.com/products/product.jsp?productId=trublend_liquid_makeup" rel="nofollow">http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...</a><br>  <br>  Keep blending it into your jawline and hairline, and don't forget silly little places like right above your lip.<br>  <br>  With a big fluffly brush, apply a loose mineral powder over it to set it and keep everything in place.

Your lucky!!|`|UNspaI3vaa	Yes, dye it a lighter color, like something brown and yet has a little red, because not alot of people have red hair, also some highlights would look good I guess, you also need some style! Get some layers and maybe bangs!!|`|JZMfUDylaa	i don't know if blonde highlights would work BUT because your skin is so light you could deff. get away with dying your hair blonde. not Platinium cause that will look tacky but maybe a honey blonde or something|`|ieDarpkVaa	If you do REALLY want to highlight it, you may want to dye your hair black or something like that. If you dont want to do that there's just about nothing else you can really do.|`|nfQhsRvfaa	Maybe try like honey blonde or something not TOO dramatic. DEFINATELY get a professional to do it though. BTW you are GORGOUS!! Beautiful eyes and face and skin!! I wish I had skin like yours I'm jealous.lol|`|AlJ557gHaa	leave it the way it is. that color red is amazing! i wish that i could pull of red hair :(|`|ITJtxINpaa	I think you shouldn't highlight your hair. You look really pretty with orange hair [:|`|Nc7clhzIaa	I could do like everyone else & like people tell me... Don't do anything to your hair cus it's beautiful the way it is, but you are anxious for something a lil different & I know that feeling.  If you decide to highlight I would not do a drastic blonde.  I would do a sort of warm tone.  Caramel blonde is a very nice color.  It has nice warm golden tones that has some brownish tones in it.|`|uij93NOjaa	I always wanted red hair with blonde highlights!!! I think it would look really good, especially since you don't have really dark red hair. It will add a little extra pop to it!! If your gonna do it, I would suggest thin blonde highlights not the chunky ones. Go to a professional to get it done!! And if you don't like it, they can fix it for you!!!|`|EZzZE544aa	Although your hair color is pretty nice , highlight will be a good change for you. it will be pretty nice on red hair.check the link below it will help you to make a proper decision, you can also find red hair highlight in google image<br>  goodluck|`|wsC2g0Dbaa	That color red is truly amazing but if you want something different i would suggest putting both highlights and low-lights so the color evens out. and it will give your hair more dimension.|`|0OB7yhCKaa	your hair would look great with blonde highlights! a light blonde! however i wouldnt do it yourself! i'd save up the money and go somewhere cuz it rarely works the way you want it when u do it yourself!|`|IuDWWYTDaa	I wouldn't get highlights.<br>  I looove you're hair color right now, i think its beautiful. I would just leave it the way it is.|`|AA11907123	So why do you want to do blonde? Try something like brown, or green or blue if you're really funky.|`|nEE4kSvCaa	hey. my best friend has red hair with blond highlights and her hair looks amazing. i love you. if your sick of your hair, then try something new. Be a rebel and get crazy !|`|XlmvIBiAaa	Had a ex-girlfriend with red hair. She went with a combination dark blonde highlight and some lowlights.  It came out well but I hope your stylist knows what they are doing.|`|eOOoEP0paa	wow your hair has such a beautifull color i wouldnt change it but if you want to blond woul be okay you should get something light.<br>  hope i helped

Q0Ky6DeLaa	I love this style. It's called Prep School or School Prep or something like that.  xD|`|YjPeEUSaaa	elegant schoolgirl look.<br>  <br>  VERY EXPENSIVE CLOTHES !<br>  <br>  not that much effort tbh (to be honest)|`|Wt4jJOV2aa	I love Blair <br>  girl rocks<br>  <br>  Even though I like Jennys styles better<br>  I do love Blairs look|`|cu8k7tWUaa	its cute, maybe not an everyday thing though<br>  <br>  and i'd call it maybe preppy?|`|y2fIAsETaa	tbh, i think you would look ridiculous walking down the street like that.<br>  but it looks pretty good on tv.|`|R6Z8onywaa	blair preppy chic<br>  <br>  maybe you want to wear a blairish top and just jeans<br>  <br>  or blairish bottoms and a plain top|`|63b55743beb7a12e37d89fb0e78f29a3aa	personally i dont like it...looks more like oldy business attire to me
zlXofrG4aa	Are you having them done by gun or needle?  As much as I don't condone the gun, I find it to hurt the least.  It's like a little pinch.  By needle/ piercing parlor it hurts a little more but it's nothing big.  Trust me you'll be fine either way.  It only hurts for a microsecond and then it's done.  Just keep thinking about the outcome!  You'll be happy you went through a tiny bit of pain for them.|`|ztj8nBzOaa	Ok im like hate needle, but the only thing that makes you nervous about getting them done is the fact the gun makes a loud noise. It really doesn't hurt that bad at all. All you have to do is go and take a deep breath.  Maybe drinking some water would help too.|`|63b55743beb7a12e37d89fb0e78f29a3aa	the lobes dont hurt...i dont know about the other part of the ear tho|`|AA12221820	JUST ATKE A DEEP BREATH WHEN U THINK ITS GOIN IN ND IT HELPS..|`|OQFuO3Jdaa	trust it doesnt hurt as much as u think is will. i got a second ear piercing with the gun thing and it didnt even hurt that much but my sister just got one on the top of her ear with the needle and she said she didnt even feel it at all.  just make sure the out the rubbing alcholal before and after they do it. and if u r getting one on the top of your ear u gotta get a special kind of soap to kill it everyday for a couple days. hope it helped. and good luck! :)|`|wHtvhkMiaa	omg... u were like me ! it dsent hurt atr all even in the cartalige it dosent hurt.... trust me! ok ? hey go to a mall and then go to claires because there not going to have any at a store on the road!! TRUST ME IT IS NOT GOING TO HURT AND GO TO CLAIRES!! go to this site right  here if u dont know what clairs is!! >>>><a href="http://claires.com/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://claires.com/index.asp</a>|`|HRFaAyKOaa	I have 17 piercings. It's not that bad and I've never had any mistakes made.|`|CAFTBC9naa	i got mine when i was 6 and it didnt hurt at all. dont worry you'll be fine|`|i01egybJaa	I was terrified too! Don't worry, I was so nervous, and when they did it, I couldn't even feel it. After they were finished I was thinking, wait what? Because I barely felt anything.|`|Au4gWgEiaa	Getting your lobes done with a needle?  Good for you!  So many people go with a gun for that still (even I have 5 done with a gun, but that was when I didn't know better!)  The pain is not bad, even getting your cartilage done is not excrutiating or anything.  I would imagine lobes done with a needle would be similar to an eyebrow, which I did not feel!  <br>  <br>  Just remember to breathe, your going to think it is going to be a lot worse than it actually is.  It's done in a matter of seconds and the jewelry will be in.  I assume you are going to a professional, if they are reputable they should rarely make mistakes.  They know what they are doing! :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!
2ZsRAxkuaa	No!<br>  Its bad stuff. It does kill all the germs that cause infection. But it also kills all the good stuff in your ear, making way for new bad germs to come in.<br>  <br>  The only thing you need is saline solution, it helps the good guys, rather than nuke everything in sight.<br>  You can buy it in big bottles from chemists, its also used as contact lens solution or eye wash.<br>  <br>  Or you can make your own. 1/8tsp of pure sea salt in a cup of boiled water, stir well and use twice a day.|`|xEZclTh4aa	i wouldn't <br>  it takes the dead skin and leaves it in your hole <br>  i would go for warm water and sea salt <br>  its good<br>  <br>  although i only have facial piercings|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	no- you're not supposed to use HP for cleaning wounds of ANY kind! it kills both bad AND good bacteria, and does more harm than good to the surrounding "healthy" tissue.<br>  <br>  Use rubbing alcohol instead.|`|kDab6zpTaa	perfect|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	Yes, it works quite well actually. And it is not unhealthy.|`|wxggEPLNaa	yea...later on though, not as soon as you get it, maybe a couple of weeks later...|`|1ZfFSH6maa	I LOOOVE your pic!<br>  hayley is so stellar :)|`|i01egybJaa	It's absolutely perfect. It's what I used when I got them pierced.
8fbvXY5waa	I would use a deep eggplant as a liner and a natural shimmery eyeshadow over your lids.|`|wGOtDZ0Uaa	try any of the lavender shades also any of the browns.|`|qOKFuXfLaa	i have dark blonde hair with hilites as well with green eyes<br>  ive been told that purples bring out the green<br>  Almay makeup has a palette for designed to make your eye color stand out and the palette for green eyes is purple.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	purple will bring out your green eyes.
NrwJyffxaa	Going strictly from my personal opinion. Beautiful women don't have tattoos.  Sexy lusty women have tattoos to advertise their rebellion.  Ugly women have tattoos to get your attention off them and on something else. <br>  <br>  I view tattoos as a sign that the person lacks self-respect.|`|kCdISEGqaa	Wow, you're really being slammed for this one.  I am a female tattoo artist and have two full sleeves, both of which are very feminine.  DO do an ambigram, they don't age well, and even when you go to a great artist, they look bad because the script is so odd looking.  As you age, so does your skin, and any tattoo you put under your skin, will age the same way your skin does.  This tattoo would look like a big blob of faded black in with time.  I am all for tattoos, but, choice means everything.  As for your placement, my husband is a teacher and has tattoos on both of his wrists.  He has never been confronted about them.  Does your district have a no show policy?  Like I say, I encourage you to get a tattoo, just make sure placement and design are well thought choices.  An amibgram by itself on your forearm would look manly and out of place.  Best wishes!!!|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	"im a teacher....then i no imma have"<br>  <br>  one of the more depressing things I've heard in a while<br>  but it explains so much....<br>  <br>  <br>  I think that if you have to ask strangers for approval for a tattoo<br>  and you, a teacher, type like you do...<br>  that you shouldn't be getting a tattoo|`|sw8gU10yaa	trashy|`|pHPOslowaa	Are you really a teacher? What do you teach?|`|MP2OEEnDaa	mmm classy for a whore

TCpTlCTRaa	Postpartum hair loss is common. Your body is going through a lot of changes having a newborn and now another pregnancy. if your body feels too stressed and out of balance the hair loss may continue. It is important to take good  care of yourself during this time. Aromatherapy scalp massage is very good for hair loss but the essential oils that can be used during pregnancy are very limited.|`|20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	Maybe you should go to a salon, and ask them if they could help. They have products for that I'm sure. If not, then you should go to a scalp specialist.|`|Zefep1sKaa	Hi there :) After delivery your female hormones go down and they cause hair fall, its normal to shed after delivery. U must immediately start on hair & nail vitamin and if you are not breast-feeding try Rogaine to immediately stop hair loss before it gets too late. Unfortunately i didn't use it after delivery neither did i continue breast-feeding and i lost all my hair and as a result i started rogaine too late when i nearly got bald. Come on get up and start on it. Oh yeah while breast-feeding u lose nutrients from your body, that might cause anemia, eat well, take iron supplements if needed. Good luck and don't worry we all went through this phase  as moms....
kgCHQQshaa	Yeah, they kind of are.|`|3z3P6j49aa	No not really.

You can get real hair from sallys for $80|`|zlXofrG4aa	I don't think they're tacky as long as they're real human hair, not the shiny plastic kind, and match your hair colour really well.|`|QsPwh6xtaa	nope...not at all.
ZFwC23mqaa	Look and see if the bikini's have measurements, normally they say under a section titled 'details'.<br>  Really, it depends on the bikini- you have a size ten back, but your larger bust might make some cups too small for you.<br>  If you get a halterneck bikini where you can tie the strings yourself, i'd say go for a twelve, because then you can have the larger bust but make the strings small enough to fit your back. If it's a fizxed size top, stick to ten =]|`|PwQLpawkaa	well i'd say you should go for a 10, since you have a small back i think a 10 wud be perfect.
KSJBhgdxaa	Your daughter is cursed with the worst of all physical traits, an abnormally large forehead. The only cure is amputation.|`|zm7TM1rCaa	i have a big for head too. it's not that big but it's wide. i barely put all my hair up, i normally do bangs, side bangs|`|i01egybJaa	She should get side bangs or a full fringe|`|yZVJaHt4aa	Yeah, it will look bigger. you want to get some kind of bangs to balance it.|`|X05GAaLeaa	Her forehead will look bigger , she should get side bangs....|`|1R4x0CRdaa	your head will always be the same size try it you wont know untill you try|`|QsPwh6xtaa	BANGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|8jY4JUw7aa	since her hair is curly let's  get a professional to straighten her hair first, next let's get the professional to cut her hair, definitely bangs with a swoop to one side now this should cover her forehead  -the reason you should get a professional to do her hair is so that the cutting of her bangs lye flat  I think to just leave the hair curly with bags, would only draw more attention to her forehead  -    hope this helps and good luck|`|DkLDNPgTaa	i agree with side bangs, because if you pull<br>  it back, her forehead will look hugeeee! <br>  dont get stright across bangs because that will<br>  make it big too. and some eye make up will<br>  help and long hair dont cut it short|`|IAdcNUioaa	My friend had the same problem just give her bangs not side bangs just the front ones and whether you put it in a ponytail or leave it down her forehead will look fine.|`|uUkJx3UDaa	Bangs. If you wear  those pretty cloths on your head, then push the hard part foward a little bit.|`|wsC2g0Dbaa	bangs will help, just get them professionally done.|`|YkNBotofaa	side swept bangs!|`|yUpHZwTMaa	side bangs.. that's how i camouflage my fore head =]|`|NdzaCG08aa	put in a side fringe :D xxx

20da7e19a185ca8c01b2a311761afcd6aa	Since you have pale skin, you should stick with a light color. If you wanna go darker, try light brown, auburn, or copper colors. Trust me, I have just about the same hair color and skin tone as you, and I died my hair dark brown one time..it looked like **** lol. Just keep in mind, pale skin looks best with light colors. If you go to dark, it will look too harsh.|`|nbtZ4ixoaa	you would look great with a really dark chocolaty shade<br>  think poppy in wild child, looks really rich and shiny :)<br>  <br>  my friend had same colour hair as you and she went dark brown and it looked fantastic, really deep :)|`|fB6Vz7gTaa	I would say carmel/ light brown!|`|63b55743beb7a12e37d89fb0e78f29a3aa	i like your hair like that...try to get the yellow tint out tho for it to look more natural|`|BXKiLVbZaa	any color you like !!!|`|GEsyKBeUaa	the blond look is good on you<br>  <br>  i waould try:<br>  maybe a light blond/red|`|I6zQeNGzaa	I like the Blonde.

MmXHvBlNaa	Looks like you obsessed with Taylor Swift, You will never look like that sweet ***.|`|B5EgyPlpaa	the first one is better. it is more unique and it stands out.|`|aeL8F2qeaa	get a digital perm. or if that costs too much for your budget get a regular perm. but if you go for regular you should get it kinda loose. use a curling iron to get the right curl.<br>  <br>  the best thing to do is to go see your hair stylist with the pics and let them know that that is what you want and then ask what they suggest.|`|pltf2teCaa	You should do curls with a flat iron. A Chi flat iron is the best one to use, but a similar one, such as a Conair one would work. Make sure it is 1 inch and has a ceramic plate. Separate the hair into sections and do small sections at a time. Take a piece of hair, (1/2 inch - 1 inch wide) then take the flat iron, start at the top and then turn the straightner to your left while pulling the hair through. It will take some practice, but it gets easier. Here is a sample video.<br>  <a href="http://www.expertvillage.com/video/4147_small-ceramic-flat-irons.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.expertvillage.com/video/4147_...</a><br>  click on the Hair Styling with Small Ceramic Flat Irons video if it doesn't start playing automatically :)|`|w8AyVsjRaa	It depends on your hair type. Is it curly or straight? If curly I recomend either curling it or putting hair scrunching gel in then drying it with a defuser.

IbWBAwVPaa	I myself have a lot of tattoos so I think it's HOT when women have them too. So long as they are GOOD tattoos, I don't have a preference and have dated women with ink and without. Some men might find tattoos unattractive but those aren't the guys you want to be with. If the guy loves you he'll love your ink too!<br>  <br>  I have run into women who don't like tattoos and this is unfortunate, FOR THEM! If they are going to let my looks stand in the way of finding out what a great person I am, this is really sad and they are the ones missing out. Some people are like this and those aren't people I would be with so I really don't care what they think. The world is full of people who have tattoos and who love them. <br>  <br>  For every bad reaction I get (it's VERY rare to find people who hate them, at least in my case!), I have many more positive ones. There is no shortage of people who love my ink! So why be with someone who doesn't like it, when there are plenty of women who are actually turned on by it? Another thing to note: Some people really don't care either way and just love you for who you are inside. Those are the best kind of partners to find!  <br>  <br>  If you really want a tattoo, don't worry about what people think. Get something you love and if a guy loves you, he'll love your ink too! It's your body and your choice and any person who doesn't respect that isn't worth your time. Best of luck with your new ink!|`|PEG4x9yCaa	Im not a guy, but i think tattoos are hot on girls. it just depends on where you get it. get on like a cute spot - not like on your face or anything you know? lol and don't get like a big dragon or flames and stuff get something pretty--whatever is cool for you- because it will be on you forever. like i have my initials and a chinese symbol on my lower back and then i just got the little chinese symbol for hope on the back of my shoulder. anyways you should get a tat because YOU  want it--not for some guy. and if you have a tat and some guy thinks is gross and don't wanna be with you just cause of that then you don't need him in the first place|`|CD2KkYJnaa	please please please dont get the tramp stamp, you know, the one just above your ***.  it just screams trashy or sleazy....in my mind at least.   get something, but just not above your ***, too many chicks got that now a days.  tattoos are cool though, just not huge ones or a whole lot of them|`|GSgECq4uaa	it depends on the tattoo, if its a small one on the wrist, hip, butt then its find. but not if its huge and very noticible of a manly thing like a dragon or something.<br>  personally, i prefer a girl with no tatoos, i guess its just personal preferance.|`|myhTgsdMaa	There are definitely guys that think it's hot and guys that think it's not.

tDdIAJh9aa	Ok you are a little young yet but just give it a few months and then see x|`|dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  If you're only 5 foot you won't get on the catwalk I'm afraid. But there are lots of other kinds of modelling, like in magazines (like Shout, Bliss or OK!) or on adverts. Face modelling would be best for you (although obviously you have to have the looks).<br>  <br>  Look for respectable modelling agencies on the internet, like Storm and send a photo to magazines. There are also many modelling competitions out there too. You could also try and make it to the London Fashion Week (although admittedly that is this coming week!) or Edinburgh Fashion Festival.<br>  <br>  You may have to send your pictures off to many agencies, but remember you should never have to pay to send your portfolio.<br>  <br>  And don't forget too that modelling is a competitive business, and not as glamorous as it looks. It's every teenage girl's dream to become a model at one point in their life, but very few make it and the job is quite an unstable one - if an agency sees a new look they prefer, they'd be quite happy to get rid of you and you could find yourself out of a job in the click of a finger.<br>  <br>  I hope that answered your question.<br>  ~ Mystic.

Then, tell them what you want, and let them wok with you to make up the design.|`|0ef851000b538b263ac2c3058c608291aa	the best thing is for him to go to a great tattoo artist, tell him his ideas, and what colours and styles he likes. the artist will draw up a few ideas and he can go over them, pick out what he likes, maybe take one piece from one sketch, and something else from another. thats the best way.|`|HGi9XjZ9aa	Go to the zoo.

U56SKlloaa	Ahh, your worrying to much sweetie.  All you have to do is go into town maybe with a friend (if they're real friends they won't mind you getting personal stuff like that) and just pop into a nice shop (if you live in the UK then Primark sell lovely bras and underwear) and then just pop into a shop like Superdrug and buy tampons, every woman in the world has to go through periods so nobody will really pay attention.  Nobody will turn around and point and shout 'ERRR SHE'S GETTING TAMPONS' it doesn't happen :) And if anyone did do that then the store manager would just throw them out and report them.<br>  <br>  Don't worry chick<br>  x|`|PEG4x9yCaa	look at the size of the bras your mom buys you on the tag. then go to walmart or something and find that size in a prettier color or whatever you want. its not that big of a deal at all really. there are even GUYS in the bras and underwear section sometimes at the stores. im sure they are the ones who are embarrassed. you wont attract attention at all just don't act all nervous and look so suspicious all the time. idk what kind of tampons you like, but i think the easiest ones to use are tampax pearl, and same with the bras, you shouldn't be embarrassed at all. you're a girl--this is what you're supposed to do.|`|zlXofrG4aa	Hun, you have a woman's body, and so do all the other females on the planet.  You shouldn't be embarassed to look for new bras or buying tampons.  They're things you need and most every other girl does too.  Don't ever be embarrassed to buy things you want or need, seriously.  Who cares what someone thinks about you!  Psh if someone sees you shopping for bras, let them!  You're picking out some cute new bras and who gives a crap, you'll look fabulous in them (even if no one but you gets to see them).  Get what you want and don't let stares or wandering eyes ever get the best of you.|`|AqU180claa	Look on your bra's that you do have,and glance at the white tag near the straps and it should say what size you wear. Then write down your size and just go to walmart and they have diffrent racks that have diffrenet sizes. And look for your size. You shouldn't be embarresed. You are woman all women have to wear that stuff. <br>  Try the Sport Tampax tampons. They are very easy to put in. And the box is pink with a little green on it. I think they are like$6.00 -$7.00|`|V1NMsoEKaa	go to a underwear shop like la sensa. then you cant feel embarassed because everyone is there for the same reason! and with the tampons, if you feel weird buying them then alot of places have self checkouts now. I know that boots do becasue i use them all the time! :) x|`|CFnkrvyvaa	It's really not embarassing to buy bras and tampons. All girls have to do it!

It's nothing to be ashamed about. Act natural and confident and you won't look awkward.|`|7dPm35LYaa	it's not a big deal! If people haven't figured it out by now that is what girls do, they have their period and they have boobs. don't be embarrassed would they rather have you leak? or wear no bra? Just act confident like it doesn't bother you b/c it really shouldn't :)|`|dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	It's really not embarrassing. 52% of the population have to buy bras, tampons, condoms and various other things. It wont attract attention, I promise!|`|NPhepcBkaa	just go in and get them, there will be other girls getting them too, its no biggie, i bought tampons today, woop de doop.<br>  xxx|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Don't worry about it.  You'll buy bras in the lingerie section of a store, and the cashier sells that stuff all day long.  She won't bat an eye.<br>  <br>  When you buy tampons, just buy other stuff at the same time.

eXDYvvuxaa	It can hurt so Ive heard, but not like excruciating, just the same type of pain you might get when plucking or waxing. It can be worth it depending on your financial means it can be very costly, but the hairs will not grow back ever, meaning no more plucking or waxing so i guess in the long term you would be better off getting unwanted hair lazered

Zga8cNC7aa	Men, women, and even children may deal with thinning hair at some point in their lives. Some people are resigned to the progressive baldness, while others seek out measures to halt present hair loss and prevent future loss. There a few things that could cause this hair thinning.<br>  <br>  Hair Thinning Causes<br>  <br>  Hormonal changes<br>  <br>  In women the use of birth control, pregnancy, and/or child birth may cause some hair loss. Once hormone levels return to normal, you will see re-growth after time. In men, excessive amounts of male hormones testosterone and DHT-dihydrotestosterone will cause hair loss.<br>  <br>  Stress<br>  <br>  Physical stress- serious illness, extremely high fevers, and injury may trigger hair loss. Emotional stress-anything that is unusual (loss, illness, financial or family issues) may also cause hair loss. Nervous habits such as hair pulling, pulling out hair, or rubbing your scalp too frequently will break hair and weaken follicles causing hair to fall out.<br>  <br>  Hair Care<br>  <br>  Washing your hair too often and blow drying your hair too much can damage the proteins necessary for hair growth. It can weaken the hair making it prone to fall out. Hair styles such as pulling your hair into a pony tail or the hairs lying in unnatural positions for too long causes hair loss. Combing through or brushing through your hair too roughly, causes breakage and pulling out hair thus resulting in hair thinning and loss.<br>  <br>  Hair Thinning Treatments<br>  <br>  Topical treatments<br>  <br>  These are applied directly to the scalp to help block DHT- dihydrotestosterone that shrinks hair follicles preventing growth and causing hair loss. It helps to re-grow hair over time.<br>  <br>  Pharmaceuticals<br>  <br>  Oral medications are available that are used to treat hair thinning. These medications may have sexual side effects in some men. Other side effects that are more serious include swelling in the lips, breast pain and growth, lumps, or nipple discharge. If any one or more of these occur stop the medication immediately and contact a physician.<br>  <br>  Natural Products<br>  <br>  Oral supplements may contain a blend of herbal extracts, minerals, and vitamins.<br>  They are specifically formulated to benefit hair loss. They may come in gel or capsulized forms.<br>  <br>  Hair transplanting and hair cloning are both surgical procedures. They take healthy hair and transplant into thinning areas, or in cloning they take healthy hairs and reproduce them in great quantities and then place them in balding areas.<br>  <br>  Dealing with Hair Thinning<br>  <br>  Many people resign themselves to the fate of going bald. Others do whatever they can to cover up the loss by changing styles or using sprays. Others will seek the help of their physician and use medication or topical treatments, but these are not without side effects.<br>  Many people are turning toward natural products such as supplements to treat their hair loss. Natural products have few if any side effects and are less expensive than other treatments. Still others simply use wigs, hair pieces, weaves, or extensions to give the illusion of a full head of hair.<br>  <br>  If the treatment is the result of medication such as that used in chemotherapy or radiation, pregnancy, childbirth, or thyroid problems once these situations are done, hair will grow back. It may take some time to get acceptable results.<br>  <br>  Hair loss is or can be an emotional problem for some. Consultation with your doctor, looking into options such as wigs, and doing research will help you feel more in control of things. There are solutions.<br>  <br>  Conclusion<br>  <br>  Hair thinning is not necessarily inevitable and can be treated in most cases. Treatment methods are varied and you and your physician can determine the one that best meets your needs. Take an active role in your treatment plan and you will likely feel better and more in control.<br>  <br>  For more resources, visit;<br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/beasnm" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/beasnm</a><br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/b968wa" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/b968wa</a>|`|fB6Vz7gTaa	my sis is the same age and did the same things!<br>  you might need special shampoo or cream.<br>  ps<br>  it could be expensive so that's it!
FVWvN07xaa	you should complain<br>  and you should say her name, even if she was having a bad day she should still of been as helpful as poss. <br>  you have rights to be treated with respect and without you and others, she wouldnt have a job hence wouldnt get paid. espesh in the recession.<br>  If you name her then the manager can talk to her and work out why she was like that. She'll prob just get a warning but you are a customer so should of got help and served in a polite fashion.|`|xdyM3IVmaa	Yes, complain. <br>  <br>  You probably shouldn't have let yourself be pushed around like that... I mean, you are in there to spend money, helping to pay HER paycheque... she should have done her job and helped you out, regardless of whether you needed the help or not. <br>  <br>  More upscale shoppes should really have much better associates than they do. Go in to the store and ask to speak to the manager, and express your disgust for the service you recieved. Say something to the effect of "I enjoy the quality of the items in your store, and I am a frequent customer of ((name stores)). I would like to be able to shop here, but from the experience I had, I'm going to have to give my business elsewhere. Your staff was rude to me... etc. etc."<br>  <br>  If it's a good manager, you will get some sort of an "I'm sorry" gesture... many times they will also discount any other purchase you will make in the future, and I've even had a place give me a gift card because of the fact that I complained about the service i recieved. <br>  <br>  Don't take bad treatment. You are the one spending the money. They cater to YOU.|`|IfGTdMvAaa	complain!!!!|`|hSaLWg74aa	you should complain!<br>  mean sales assistants think they can get away with murder and im sick of it! <br>  email the head office... and i hope she loses her job because if she really needed the job, she would make the most of it and treat customers with respect!|`|Li9oemwqaa	I would complain, but maybe just complain about the genral feel of the store, how you were statisfied with the help and how you had to wait a long time to get served, if you want tell them that the till person treated you poorly<br>  If the shop wants to take it further they will just look at the cctv and see the till person<br>  Make sure that you tell them that you will not be returning to the store or recommending it to all your friends due to the lack of assistance|`|ZjYLTdovaa	a bad day is one thing but that woman is rude. she should have someone complain about because she prolly acts like this everyday and thinks there's nothing wrong with it. upper management would want to know how their employees are doing because they really only hired these people to provide exceptional service to higher end customers who are expecting something better than bargain store manners and they deserve to know what exactly is going on in their stores. that kind of attitude is prolly costing them even more business on top of the recession. hit send.|`|92a5d9f7c40dbec7dc7ef3c068fb1505aa	definitely complain and name names! if that company values their customers, then they should reimburse you somehow. If not then don't return to that store and tell everyone you know about their customer service!|`|L9dNuqIvaa	I would complain.
CTZQbwdRaa	Its your makeup to be honest. I used to have that problem until I used Revlon Colorstay liquid makeup for combination/oily skin. It lasts really long, doesn't clog pores, adds a matte look although it might need topping up with powder near the end of the day and is oil-free.<br>  <br>  You could try a primer, but I have no experience in that end. Smashbox is rumours to have a very good primer.<br>  <br>  =]|`|zlXofrG4aa	I have very oily skin as well and this is what I've found works.  First you need to get a mineral powder like bare minerals (what I use) or everyday minerals.  Both are good but bare minerals is better for coverage and staying power.<br>  Your skin is oily because of your genetics but you can help that!  You need to condition your face into not making so much oil.  To do that you need a routine.  Start by exfoliating your face with a beaded wash and warm water, then rinse with cold water.  Hot water makes your skin produce more oil, just so you know.  After it dries apply a facial lotion very lightly.  And then apply your makeup.  It will take some time for your face to not produce so much oil but it will work.  Of course you'll still have the semi oily skin because it's not a miracle routine but it really helps!<br>  Good luck hun :)|`|QljMDhg2aa	i have this same problem!<br>  Try using oil blotting sheets and just dab these over your face before you put on your makeup. There isn't really much you can do to stop getting makeup on things though. Although i have heard some people spray a light coating of hairspray over their makeup before a night out and it does stop makeup from running or comming off so you could always give this a try, Good luck x|`|8fbvXY5waa	Are you using liquid/creme foundation? If so, I would switch to powder, since your skin is oily.<br>  <br>  If you like the liquid/creme foundation, you could try putting on a makeup base before applying it and then dusting powder on it to set it afterward.
OvGhGkL9aa	Purple will be perfect, but if you don't like that idea then wear maybe a gold? That will look good to!|`|i01egybJaa	Shades of blue and purple will look excellent on you.|`|HqahkvLeaa	I think a purple silky dress would look nice on you......<br>  <br>  :D:D:D<br>  <br>  It would certainly show the blue especially if it is darkish purple :D:D:D|`|ztj8nBzOaa	Well if I were you I would wear either a aqua or turquoise blue.  That should really make your eyes pop. You could also wear like a soft pink too.

And I'm a white girl and I definitely find Asians attractive I think they have really good style and they are cute, in my opinion. People are just so ignorant sometimes when they make assumptions|`|dkMceLYhaa	noo well that white girl must be blind i find asian guy most attractive cuz i watch alot of asian dramas and i used to live in japan so i like asian dudes and i'd rate that guy 8/10

It's called "fishing for compliments". It's quite pathetic, no one cares how you wear your hair. Get over yourself.|`|OIzMpibdaa	curly is unique but straight is way cuter.. but whenever u like better..<br>  i have curly hair it def makes a girl stand out but straight hair is always nice..change it up a lil bit|`|MIh7pA2baa	You look cute both ways but you look better when it's stright! Maybe try to put it up or something..|`|yT7MRdCAaa	I thinkk straight looks better with ur face shape, maybe curly without headband wud look better.|`|sZI8R3oGaa	Straight, but you look cute either way|`|z4V9kdR8aa	curly|`|Sl5usIvCaa	I would have s e x with u both ways so not bad.|`|CZw2Gpbraa	you look amazing when its straight, i love how its kind of wavy|`|cW9rscpJaa	stright looks much better|`|tb67ss8Naa	straight!|`|qqHx4KmMaa	definitely straight, it gives a smoother prettier look.|`|8uy5SZCfaa	i like straight best but curly also looks fab if your going for a more casual/natural look|`|MGOmVeMfaa	straight<br>  but i think the curly  would look just as pretty without the headband or with a thinner headband|`|i01egybJaa	Even though it looks great both ways, I like it better when it's straight. :)|`|p8rxpA98aa	I like it better straight. It's cool both ways though, so u should do it both ways. Don't just stick to one thing.|`|3jMsJXjGaa	i say curly

I used to be really into this style but after a while, I found myself looking at old photos and wishing I looked like that again.<br>  You're absolutely gorgeous, girl! Why not make your hair all one colour, maybe a light brown!|`|oojO4WAraa	You are a pretty girl.  The hair looks awful.  Go to a good hairdresser - it is worth the money.

You probably should try not to use too many products at the moment if you seem to be experiencing oily, dry and redness in your skin. Maybe speak to a dermatologist or a doctor if your symptoms persist. I would advise you to use an oil-free moisturiser as a base for your make-up and apply in light layers, this ensures that it doesn't clog the pores. Finally, make sure you take off all your make-up before you go to bed at night as this can cause unhealthy skin. <br>  Good Luck : )|`|BYwOv0nOaa	If you use a flannel or sponge when your washing your face make sure you clean it regularly because it can get really dirty really quick!<br>  Also After you've had a wash try re-washing it with cold water. This closes  your skins pores and makes it tighter!!<br>  <br>  Then if you can still feel they dry/oilyness use a moisturiser thats suitable for your skin type and then apply your foundation :)<br>  <br>  I used to have really dry skin and it worked for me! :D<br>  <br>  Hope i helped! x|`|WImLNgbYaa	Your using way to many products at a time.<br>  For dry skin, use vaseline or savlon, as they heal the skin.<br>  And as for oily skin, i used to be the same, just wash your face a lot more than you do cause your washing away all the dirt and sweat you've gathered during the day and it will cause spots to come quickly.<br>  And as for the redness. I'm not quite sure. Try using a tinted moisture that compacts with your skin.|`|i01egybJaa	Did you ever consider that maybe you were allergic to these products?

BUT your hair has to be damp. Take sections of your hair, and twist them into buns and pin them on the top of your head. Spray them with hairspray, but dont spray TOO much, just enough to make them hold. Do your make up, and whatever else you need to do, then unravel the twists EASILY.

Look in pharmacies, people with allergies and sensitive skin often need unscented lotions.  <br>  <br>  Last time I got ink (2 years ago), A&D or Bacitracin was OK.  It's more about keeping the skin soft while it heals, so the tattoo can "set" and heal correctly.<br>  <br>  If you can only find scented lotion, I do not think it will cause issue.|`|xc8bnpCvaa	A&D Ointment works, and there are several lotions out there that will work. I am not sure why Lubriderm is recommended (unscented is only to prevent allergic reaction) but there are several lotions that are better than Lubriderm, because they do not contain MINERAL OIL (it is used for makeup removal, permanent and semi- permanent ink removal, and many other uses, it can cause skin irritation and prevents the skin from absorbing moisture)

Do something more constructive that builds confidence in your ability to think and do, not your ability to look pretty.  Just a thought.

zpovg4U7aa	No I don't believe that people like that exist. I think everyone has an underlying side, it's just how much it comes out.

I6zQeNGzaa	Using natural henna, yes you can and yes the color will intensify. It will be a darker red. <br>  Since you have dark brown , the red color isn't going to be very noticeble until some sort of bright light hits your hair. You will see a  red tint.|`|LaQ8Ejt3aa	<a href="http://www.hennacaravan.com/shop/hair.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hennacaravan.com/shop/hair.ht...</a><br>  you can redye with henna, just be sure to get great quality henna.<br>  If you got cheap henna with hardly any dye content, it will not work well|`|7OBmjYHNaa	MY ADVICE...STAY AWAY FROM HENNA OR "DEMI COLORS" - <br>  <br>  <br>  Demi & Semi Permanent colors "coat" or "stain" the hair. If you use them too often they will build up on the hair and eventually - it will become impossible to highlight or lift if off the hair. (I once was the poster child for demi color) It's no fun if you get a build up of this "stain" and want a change.|`|59shiRofaa	you can dye your hair twice with henna <br>  but the colour u want in your hair wont come up as good|`|e7a5a3e802c87fca0253811255c9ab2baa	you can dye it more than once with henna|`|EZzCqUWKaa	should be ok, henna is natural|`|9Gsx32Skaa	Just make sure you don't use chemical coloring on your hair or you will damage it severely.<br>  As long as you use mineral free henna, you should be fine. The box should say pure henna. 'All natural' henna boxes can still carry additives.<br>  Henna "builds up" on the hair, which can shift the color to burgundy with repeat applications.<br>  It's a commitment too..once you henna you have to stay with henna until you cut your hair (if you want to dye over it again).You can't use it one month and then switch back to regular hair colors when you don't quite like the shade. Henna can't be removed or stripped from your hair the way conventional colors can.<br>  Here's a good source for pure henna,<br>  <a href="http://www.mehandi.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mehandi.com/</a>|`|tq4UtRATaa	Yes, it would intensify the color every time if applied more than once within a short period of time. Make sure you are using Natural Henna. You also have to consider that henna can make your hair dry so if you already have dry hair you should not over apply. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hennafair.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.hennafair.com</a>|`|sZcf3DaLaa	yes

ahsICuyvaa	OH! I had this happen to me my very first time i ever got them waxed :)<br>  <br>  What i was told to do is next time i go in, tell them to not heat the wax as hot as they did. My dad told me that that is a big factor of the skin ripping off, especially since the eyebrow area has some pretty sensitive skin. If you really like the place you go to, give them another try. If it happens again, go to a different place and tell them about the last. Make sure they understand and not heat the wax as hot.<br>  <br>  I, also, am nervous about going again. It hurt so bad! Good luck, and tell me how it works out! :)<br>  <br>  ~Michelle|`|tj9NgXPzaa	Well, sometimes, it's not the place where you get them done. It's the person who does it for you. Tell them what happened last time. Not all people are good at waxing eyebrows. When I get my eyebrows waxed, sometimes the person who I usually go to, to do them for me isn't there. So I ask someone else, and they don't do it like I want. You can ask for a "clean" or something like that if you don't want a big arch or if you don't want them to hurt you. Telling them what happened before is a good thing though, you should do that.|`|Nc7clhzIaa	Obviously she is not experienced at what she does or this wouldn't have happened.  If you go to this same salon all the time & it usually doesn't happen, tell the owner & request your usual person or someone else. However, if this was your first time there, first impressions can sometimes leave a lasting impression.  I would go somewhere else, maybe somewhere your friends go all the time so you will never have to deal with that embarrassment again.  Good Luck.|`|gq0EEM2haa	Try out a new place. That happened to me, the girl yanked on my eyebrows for a good 20 minutes. After leaving I noticed a spot under my eyebrow that was bleeding and it burned so bad. Later on when I was ready to wax them again, I found somewhere that was 8 dollars cheaper and they never burn/ or hurt me.|`|hAs2X0bCaa	That happened to me too, except on my upper lip.  I had a big, long and dark scab there for a couple of weeks, it was terrible.  I never went back to that place, I just picked better places to go.  And never let someone who is still learning how to wax do it for you!|`|pW5Of9kiaa	if that happend to me i would tell then what happend maybe they used a old soultion or something and it did something but if that happens again i would go to a different person thats not worth paying them if they mess up|`|6NZj3uEEaa	yes, go to a new place becausethat shouldn't happen. tell them what had happened. they will probably use a wax that isn't as strong as the one that was used previously.|`|rNfT62zOaa	get them plucked out its easier and painless. it might take more time but its worth the time because plucking is more accurate

yjfl3j5iaa	I say go for it - the colours you described sound beautiful. Not many people can pull off platinum blonde and you only live once! My eyes are almost black and I would love to wear it light blonde, it is a really nice colour.<br>  But if you have doubts, you can always have contacts, then the eye colour choices are unlimited - good luck I think you will suit it xxx|`|z2mpC5NDaa	no.. you would be all washed out..............<br>  i'm about as pale as you can get and i have green eyes......... an auburn color looks best..... it makes you pop and not look so washed out............ or blended<br>  i have auburn hair and i have highlights through it.............. looks great.........|`|NQuPNHPyaa	It would look good. I would also make your eye color come out. GO for it girl!|`|3AlFMrA5aa	no it would not look good|`|goCugDOKaa	Whether it looks good or not, platinum hair is incredibly severe.  You will need to touch up the roots every three weeks or you will look ridiculous, even if your hair is light to begin with.  Also, the processing is sheer torture to your hair.  You are removing all of the pigment in your hair and even when you go back to a darker color, it will never be the same until all of the processed hair is gone.  This dries out your hair A LOT!  You will need to work double time to condition.  If you have a sensitive scalp (and maybe even if you don't) it can be a painful process.  And if you over-process, your hair can fall out.  I have seen this happen and it is NOT pretty.  You should think about it before you go through with it.  There are very few people who can successfully get away with this look and even then it finishes up making them look fake.|`|2gTgw9o9aa	<a href="http://s266.photobucket.com/albums/ii244/carazygirly/?action=view&current=aaaaaaaaa.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s266.photobucket.com/albums/ii244...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  it looks like this, itll look good  =)|`|ssGDXxToaa	I think it could work, a pic would be best to tell.

civjrSYIaa	You shouldn't care about what idiots at school say because I know your better than that and you don't honestly care what others think.<br>  <br>  Building up your shoulders would make you look in proportion if you did have a big head..which i don't think you do :)<br>  <br>  You taught me that beauty is what is in the inside and don't lose the hair its too sexual and I will miss it dearly.<br>  <br>  Take care hun x|`|PQRcItmdaa	If you want to get a short cut, get bangs.

Long hair, medium, short hair, bangs always work. I'm Asian and I have a pretty big forehead. When I was little, I had bangs and I hated them, so I wanted to grow them out. When I did, I looked really weird. I then got that "Asian" look with the bangs swept to the side and I always get compliments now. A big forehead shouldn't be a problem. Talk to a stylist or something about a hairstyle that will fit you.
2992c9f572b21b27b8cb0f9e0f893ddaaa	MAC make up is good quality but the prices are a bit over the top.<br>  Sometimes i wonder if your paying for the name.<br>  I have a few products, the best i'd say is the concealer and foundation. The eyeshadows are just like any other eyeshadows, they fade quickly even with a primer. The Blushers are good but also fade quickly.<br>  Its just exciting to buy something everyone says is great.|`|rx79PskAaa	With cosmetic companies like that your paying more for the name than the actual product itself.<br>  <br>  An eyeliner is an eyeliner to me, and buying an eyeliner pencil for ￡1 would be very similar to the one for ￡8, just may need to re apply it a bit more often, and for the smudge problem, using powder under your eye before putting on eyeliner will fix that. <br>  I have the MAC prep+Prime, and it caused my skin to break out- i would never go back to it again. I use a much cheaper one now and its does a much better job and is good for my skin. <br>  <br>  I like MAC because of the variety of eyeshadows, MAC has AMAZING colours and has the most variety, i think, out of all of them, and i think tha'ts the only thing i would buy from MAC. <br>  <br>  So yeah, your really paying for the name rather than the makeup.|`|tESdl7gbaa	I love m.a.c so much, but im with you on the price! It is really expensive, but then again its really worth it - its make up artist quality and is so long lasting/pigmented .. i adore it all! haha|`|oOMWYEyaaa	MAC is really good makeup, but its not the makeup to use for the daily use .. its does stay on longer but its not healthy for your face ..<br>  <br>  I use AVON makeup for the daily use ...|`|xieiM0FRaa	It's not my make-up of choice. I prefer Maybelline and I get a lot of eyeliners from Avon since my aunt works there, so it's more convenient.|`|EgqtI7ovaa	mac is brilliant<br>  they make great quality products and they supply make up for the west end in london. So theres proof.|`|KzljfKjpaa	i love mac.<br>  i dont pay full price tho my cousin works there so i get a sixty percent discount|`|42LovADyaa	pricey but way worth it it stays on forever and it never needs touching up!!|`|JhJXKRkOaa	nice make-up brand, but way to expensive.|`|GItWq2mGaa	THE best! best pigments in shadows, great selection , foundation is OIL FREE and gives you the flawless look (when used correctly, it wont clog your pores as it hypoallergenic) use the concealer for your troubled spots and blend over with the studio fix. just don't use the studio fix for touch ups or to refresh, that's not what its made for, it may look like a powder and feel light like a powder but it is in fact a foundation just like the liquids! if you want to refresh/touch up use a blot powder (translucent but with a tint of color so you don't look powdered or pastey) a pressed powder or the fix plus thats what they are meant for! As long as you are matched up correctly and shown how much to use (ie how to use it CORRECTLY) you should also wash your face at night and use a moisturizer to keep your skin clean and fresh (if you don't want to look powdery with the studio fix use the STROBE cream before you put it on, it will give you a luminous glow). Prices are also way below other high end cosmetic lines, and best of all, you can try ANY product out, even mascara and lip stuff, and if you dont like it you can bring it back for a FULL refund! will last you 3 times as long as drug store items, Look better, Feel better, more choices, and in the end, save you money and make you beautiful! Mac addict for life here!|`|cWK4FVbCaa	I think they are good but are very much over rated big time!<br>  Most of their products are good quality i know but for example their lip glosses are sticky so you can buy the same quality for a few pounds.<br>  I think eyeliners and mascaras can be bought for cheaper and have the same if not better quality in some cases.<br>  <br>  Try collection 2000 glitter eye liners MUCH BETTER AND CHEAPER<br>  No7 liplicious lip glosses in a squeezy tube - about the same price as a mac lip gloss but you get more, not sticky or drying at all and are great colours and good pigmentation meaning overall they are better than mac IMO.<br>  Mascaras from mac arnt the best and most people know this i like maybelline and rimmels mascaras :D<br>  Liquid eyeliners try 2True only ￡1,95 and great!<br>  <br>  Things i think are worth it from Mac are the eye shadows although they are pricey and i won't be buying many because there are some cheaper alternatives, they are good quality.<br>  Foundations - i have two of their foundations and think they look nice and their concealer but i think there are cheaper alternatives to the moisture cover.<br>  <br>  Anyways im talking too much but overall i think they have some very good stuff but are very much over rated.|`|1vaqtRI2aa	You may be paying more, but you're paying for better quality.<br>  Plus, it's the LOWEST prices you'll find on HIGH quality make-up. Chanel, Lancome (which is more expensive but total crap, in my opinion), Benefit and others are a LOT more expensive than MAC.<br>  <br>  Yes, some of the stuff is overrated at times because of all the MAC addicts (me being one of them), but it's still a fabulous line.<br>  <br>  And once you empty out 6 eye shadows, lipglasses or lipsticks, you get a free one, because they recycle the empty containers. They are cruelty-free and fair trade.<br>  And if you ask for a palatte, The eyeshadows will be $11, not $14.<br>  <br>  The always come out with awesome collections, like the Hello Kitty collection. They also have a Viva Glam collection, where 100% of proceeds go to AIDs research.<br>  <br>  The eyeshadows are my favorite MAC items. They are fabulous quality, and really stay on and are high pigmented. Just stay away from Idol Eyes, that eyeshadow is evil. Two eyeshadow must-haves are Carbon (It can be used as an eyeshadow, as well as eyeliner and for your waterlines) and Nylon. They're fabulous!<br>  <br>  The lipglasses taste yummy and have a good shimmer. I prefer to get C.O. Bigelows lipglosses or Victoria's Secret Beauty Rush lipglosses.<br>  The lipsticks are nice, my favorite is Viva Glam II.<br>  The foundations are fabulous. The studio fix is AWESOME!<br>  <br>  If you want some more recommendations, e-mail me or I/M me. Hope this helps and sorry it's so long!|`|n5G5IIbOaa	Some of the stuff is kinda pricey but if you compare it to some other really high end brands like the stuff in Fraser and Harrod's (omg) then it's actually quite reasonable, especially for the quality.|`|7faf93da45d83739157172f0932e02ccaa	i dont think its all that, i have a mac mascara which is ok but the wand is a bit tricky to use and i brought some eyeshadow which didnt show up that well.

oXNgstLYaa	Mabeline Full & Soft is the way to go!

d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	There's a simple trick that will quickly get rid of it. Use any oil and with finger tips rub forward and back on and along the line quite vigorously. Do many times. The massaging friction will greatly diminish it. For fastest result do for 2 to 3 minutes a few times a day. I can send you testimonials from users who have virtually completely got rid of their wrinkles. The sun is not responsible. A constantly held facial expression while awake is the cause. Catch yourself doing it and then learn not to do it. I had the same problem but not anymore.<br>  P.S. Many sun screens are skin harming and skin aging and skin wrinkling. To avoid harm thoroughly massage face with olive oil, splash with water, dab dry with tissues then apply sunscreen on top. Surprisingly, it is just, if not more effective. I spend many hours in intense sun with only one application. The oil massage will greatly benefit and rejuvenate skin and can greatly lessen all other wrinkles.<br>  <br>  SOURCE(S):20+ years research - natural treatments & cures of skin conditions, skin enhancenent and anti aging, rejuvenation treatments.

AA11461724	i don't know if rogaine would work ... i don't know about any of those hair growth formulas. they will grow back within a few weeks ... you could try getting an eyebrow pencil in the shade of your eyebrows and lightly pencil them in where there's no hair. some people think it would look too fake, i did too but i use eyebrow pencils every day 'cause my eyebrows are really light and practically nonexistent, it looks good.|`|uhKBBQ9raa	hmm possibly 2 weeks or so, but you can use makeup to cover it :)

MNHjJzRnaa	i tried secret clinical strength too. <br>  && i thought it didnt work.<br>  <br>  but, it came up in a converstation w/ a friend and she was all like.. are you using it right??<br>  <br>  It says to put it on overnight so it has time to work...<br>  <br>  Anyhow, I decided to give it another go, (except w/ clinical sport) and guess what? after a couple of days of using it it started to work. Before this, I found some relief from switching between deodorants, and avoiding tight sleeved shirts. But if nothing seems to help- doctor it is for you! <br>  lol.<br>  good luck.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	okay teen sprint and make sure u buy intipersperent its different then deoderent deoderent makes u smell good anti persoerent gives wetness protection|`|ogeRU7KEaa	I use Dove- Rose.

I actually started using AERIE deodorant and it works well. But if that doesnt work or whatever, you can and should talk to your doctor.

WLuEIwp5aa	Nah, it's going on your skin forever, you gotta be sure it's exactly what you want.  Any tattoo artist getting pissed about it (as long as you're not being wishy washy about actually getting it) isn't someone I'd want to deal with.<br>  <br>  I work stuff out with my artist, sometimes it's 45 minutes after my appointment starts before we even get a stencil on me.  I don't feel bad asking to move things around or change little stuff, and he never (seriously) gives me any trouble about it.|`|8THz1sp9aa	It doesn't sound like you are being very descriptive to begin with. If you want a certain hair on the skull you need to speak up and give as much detail as you can. If you have done so, and the artist is going ahead and drawing up what she thinks looks good then you need to find yourself a new artist. <br>  <br>  remember you definitely shouldn't feel bad for being picky, this is going to be on your body permanently! and they will (and should) understand that.|`|qhKP68eiaa	Think about it like this...the tattoo is going to be on you for the rest of your life, not on your tattoo artist.  I believe that they do not mind being critiqued as long as the customer is happy.  <br>  <br>  You're going to spending the money, you might as well be 100% happy, spare the drama and the worrying about the feelings of the tattooer.|`|5jsMY4RIaa	It's your body. And it's her job to put something that YOU love on to it. If you're not happy with the rough sketch then you won't be happy when it gets inked. She wants you to be happy with your tattoo.|`|UtND0R2Baa	I don't see why anyone should get mad. It is her work but it's on your body and you're paying her to get the tattoo that you want.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	hell no! its your body that tattoo is going to be on forever, not the artist, so it better be what you want, not her! when i was looking into getting my first tat there was an artist everyone was recommending but when i went to have him draw something up for me he gave me total attitude when i asked him to change one part of it. he said it wouldn't look right but you know what, i took my business elsewhere. i dont care if he doesn't like the way it looks, i like the way it looked so i found another artist to do it no problem. i still love it to this day!|`|quHnUWyWaa	by you being totally satisfied you are going to tip her better, plus you will be a living billboard of her work, and personal references from satisfied clients, and repeats are always appreciated. so be totally honest with your artist, and you will always have a tattoo waiting in the wings to be added.|`|d922d8a0409a4a04d2023991a654551aaa	It is important to get just what you want otherwise you may be disappointed about a tat you'll have forever. I recently had a tat done. I brought in a design I worked hard on for days. But the artist changed some of it and I am disappointed. Other people say it looks great but I'm not totally pleased. For that kind of money you should get what you pay for.<br>  <br>  Only a **** artist would get upset over changes. If that happens go to someone else!<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|sTAQX6EQaa	A Tattoo is forever and if you dont line it and get it anyways.. your going to regret it.. the only thing i regret about mine is where i got it.. cuz i cant see it everyday.

0e8mlXveaa	Lots of water, foods with vitamin E and essential fatty acids such as fish oil (or flaxseed oil if vegetarian). Exfoliate once a week with a gentle product for young skin (Lush do some fab face masks which also do this for you) and use light diffusing make up such as the YSL Touch Eclat pen or a cheaper own brand alternative. Always use a product with SPF in it too, it's a good time to start protecting your skin from the sunshine as it is really dehydrating and ageing.|`|VGij9p0Taa	Hi ya <br>  There is a great website called ELF cosmetics uk (eyes lips and face)<br>  try there mineral booster and bronze they will give you a healthy glow like people in magazines!!!<br>  the cost is about ￡3.50 plus postage|`|lBRud4y5aa	Healthy food and lifestyle. Avoid rubbish food (MacDonald's) don't drink too much and don't smoke at all. Exercise in the fresh air, even when the weather is bad. Avoid makeup as much as possible as it clogs pores and keeps oxygen off the skin. There, no charge on this occasion.|`|GHZ3fZlsaa	If you want your skin to glow, then you should polish it!<br>  <br>  Your skin will look dull and lifeless when dead skin builds up and isn't removed - you may also got the occasional spot or blackhead as dead skin blocks pores.<br>  <br>  Every 4 weeks the entire top level of your skin dies and is replaced by new skin, so needs to be removed.<br>  <br>  I suggest you use a cream cleanser (a natural one without any nasty chemicals which can damage skin) and most importantly, use a muslin cloth to gently exfoliate - lifting away dead skin.<br>  <br>  The cloth will also have a polishing effect, helping it to glow.<br>  <br>  If you're 16, your skin is probably in its best possible condition, so you won't need much in the way of cosmetics.<br>  <br>  Avoid anything with Methyl-Paraben (check the ingredients) as that prematurely ages skin.  Also avoid harsh facial washes with lots of soap or detergent.  Don't use anything with alcohol either - all will dull your skin and hide your natural glow.|`|j7HeuFeVaa	Do you mean products as in cosmetics?<br>  I'm quite pale and i use Georgia by Benefit, you can get it in debenhams or online, its a powder for the face and it's a peach colour but it's really subtle and just gives a lovely "peachy glow" complexion, it's quite expensive at ￡22.50 but mine still looks like it's hardly been touched!!!!<br>  Hope I helped :)|`|IuDWWYTDaa	Jergens Natural Glow Daily Moisturizer.<br>  It works great and doesn't make your skin blotchy or orange.

Clinique has this fantastic face scrub called 7-day-scrub and -du-uh- you can use this face scrub every day -preferably every morning. <br>  <br>  Now, what you wanna do is open your pores with some hot water before you apply the scrub. Then you gently operate from your neck to your fore-head in small circle movements. Once finished the scrub, wash it off and dry your face GENTLY! Then apply your moisturizer, your eye cream (every girl should get a good eye cream from the moment you start using mascara), allow your creams to be absorbed before you apply your make up.  :) Do this every morning and you'll start seeing changes in your skin tone. What you actually do is that you remove the top layer of your skin (the dead skin cells) so that your healthy glowing skin is revealed.  Make this a morning routine and you'll look fantastic! <br>  <br>  :)|`|neOtvhRJaa	Start using a moisturizer for sensitive skin and one that has SPF 15 or more. <br>  <br>  www.votrevu.com/successteam - luxury french skincare at affordable prices. <br>  <br>  We have a fantastic selection of skincare for all skin types.|`|Pybx037Taa	Using a bronzer might help I hope I sorta answered your question
R4WX5twzaa	I see nothing wrong with those eyebrows. In fact, they're nicer than mine. I don't know who told you that eyebrows are the only thing girls look at, but it's not true. Unless you have huge bushes over your eyes, girls don't even pay attention to eyebrows. I know how you feel, though, because my eyebrows remind me of owl's eyes. They kind of stick straight out and up closer to my nose, it drives me nuts! But no one notices them, so they don't bother me that much. If you think about it, people have more important things to notice on your face, like your eyes, your lips, and your smile. They're much too distracted with all those things to take the time to notice your eyebrows. So relax, and don't be so self concious. When you find yourself attractive, other people find you attractive too :)|`|geuF7GsHaa	PLUCK THEM!|`|DCwGQDO9aa	Trim them things fellow.|`|M5oDWsLPaa	getta a shaver and shave off the amount of eyebrow u feel happy with and keep repeating the process

Yerwit5Aaa	Yea, you could, but I have a better option. When you finish a tube of mascara, take out the lid with the brush, soak it in warm water to get out the goop, and then let the brush dry. It works very well. I dont like using mascara, so i just wet the brush and use it on my lashes when im going out.

gzyj2Zrsaa	Trying looking into various products made for sensitive skin. The Venus line works very well (I have some of the same issues) and if you have problems with creams I would suggest trying to one with the shaving gel built in. It works the best for me.    Besides that you may want to try a lotion with darkening solution (not as strong as a fake tan) to help give your legs some color, if you're of a paler skin tone.    And really, just ask others what THEY think, honestly. Sometimes as humans we get so caught up we think we look a lot worse than we do...|`|y5qZRyLraa	i don't know.

AA11461724	well everything that you're doing shouldn't make it bad ... you don't dye it too often, you don't blowdry it and that's really good 'cause blowdrying is really damaging and the vitamins is a good thing ... straightening isn't good for your hair but as long as you don't do it very often it should be fine but teasing ... teasing is really bad for hair. i did it once for halloween one year ... it got knotted constantly, it had SO many split ends, it was fried. it finally looked good after it all grew out and i cut it off. just remember that, and take really good care of it and do treatments for split ends, even if you don't have any, it will be really good for your hair since you tease it. good luck!|`|goCugDOKaa	Hmmm... Ok, when you use the iron, make sure you use a heat protector... this is crucial.  The hair iron is worse for your hair than anything else because you are applying direct heat to your hair.  As far as coloring, if you are putting a darker color into your hair that is not so bad.  When you lighten it, you are taking pigment out and that really stresses your hair.  After awhile, yes, it will become damaged.  However, if you decide that you no longer want the red hair, it is very difficult to get the red out.  I think as long as you take care of your hair, you will be fine.  I cannot stress the protector enough when heat styling though.  The heat really takes a toll on your hair.  Make sure that you condition well.  You should do a hot oil treatment once a month or every two months.|`|wYLmaUTRaa	If your hair is naturally dark brown i think you should let the roots grow in for a little bit. Brown isnt that much off from red. In fact you if you go out into the sun with your dark brown hair it usually does go into a red color. It isn't healthy to dye your hair, you shouldn't really dye the whole head. I think to keep your hair from getting damaged  you should start to just do the roots once a month. Don't wash your hair every day - do it every other day - it will keep it healthy. Its not gross, once you get use to it. And straightening your hair does cause the color to fade, so you might want to cut back on that to once a week and it will lead to split ends after a while of straightening but you could just get it trimmed|`|v0fpIMhdaa	i seriously think you need to wash your hair at least every other day or 3-4 times a week. you would be better off blow drying your hair rather than straightening it that often. straightening stretches the hair folicle and the intense heat seriously damages your hair. you would be better of blow drying it and if have to then straighten it only once a week. which is still a bit much. and give your hair a break at least on your days off and weekends. you will find your hair dry and a lot of breakage from the straightening. you need to do a deep conditioning on your own to save money. with your dry hair. apply good thick conditioner to your hair till it is saturated and do it from the bottom up and in sections so every part is covered. then put on a shower cap and let it sit on your hair for at least 30 minutes. i would do this at least once a month. and DO NOT brush your hair when it is wet. either comb it or pick it out. or use your fingers.|`|QU1sVsBIaa	I'm afraid of that happening to me....i hope your hair will be fine...I know this is rude to say but its VERY important to me: can some people answer my question...its on my profile its the most recent question i have...plz help me too!!! and to the person who asked this quesion...i want my hair like that too except idk if its called a dark Auburn...anyway plz help her and me!!|`|jSHoDLVXaa	from experience you are treating your hair brilliantly, you dont over colour, or over heat your hair, so im sure it will be fine. just a quick tip though. make sure you give your hair a good condtioning treatment after colourings.

FQJoYIamaa	i would definitely recommend  for your eyes eyeliner for the bottom of your eye , mascara to uplift the eyelashes so it shows the colour of your eyes more, i wouldn't recommend a liquid eyeliner for your upper part of your eye as i don't want the mascara to be covered and it will also make your eye look much smaller.. a light blue eye shadow would look nice in metallic. your hair would look nice as straightened and then slightly curled at the bottom but not too much as it doesn't look that nice and a light streaks look awesome of any colour.

If you choose to do it, you could always pin it back if you didn't like it, or push it back with a hair band. <br>  <br>  Personally, i think a shorter side fringe would really suit you, that sweeps across your forehead, and tjat will makes you look older.<br>  <br>  Full fringes are really hard to keep as well as I got one a couple of months ago, you always have to keep straightening them etc.. But i grew mine out into a side fringe wich is much better.<br>  <br>  Hope you get something that you like!|`|XDgY8KXeaa	hey<br>  My honest advice is that if you do not know how to maintain a fringe I would'nt do it but if you do than go ahead. I actually think it will make you look a little older so that would be a plus. <br>  Fringes are always nice when done by a professional the problem is whether you are able to keep them looking like that. <br>  At least it is something that if you do not like will grow back quite quick in most cases.|`|sws4tl5Daa	Omg totally!

GItWq2mGaa	I did not have any features that I was trying to cover, specifically, I just like heavier makeup sometimes. I was thrilled with the results in the beginning. My face was completely even, a beautiful creamy color and velvety texture. I have to say though, that as the day wears on, the makeup does not look as great. It begins to look somewhat chalky or powdery, and much less natural. I have problems specifically in the area around my eyebrows, as the makeup seems to dry, powder, and cling to the brows. It's very odd. Also, any undertones, like pink or orange, become more pronounced as the day wears on and the makeup dries out. It does last all day though, which is excellent, it just doesn't stay the same as it was in the morning.<br>  <br>  After using this for about two weeks as a foundation, I decided to try it as a concealer, and switch back to my regular foundation. As a concealer, this is superb. It will cover absolutely any blemish, freckle, scar, etc. It blends in wonderfully with my regular foundation and stays on all day. It doesn't feel heavy at all, which it sort of did as a foundation. I had had no complaints with my old concealer, Maybelline's liquid tube one, but this surpasses that in terms of concealing and staying power.<br>  <br>  I have dry, sensitive skin. This did not irritate it. I'm not prone to breakouts, so I can't offer any information on that, other than to say the packaging makes no claims in terms of clogging pores. I'm sure Clinique.com could answer anyones questions on that.<br>  <br>  All in all, Ii would absolutely recommend this as a foundation for purposes like theatre, weddings, or any other day that you need heavy coverage that you don't want wearing off, or for anyone with scars or something they want covered. For day to day use though, I would have to say it makes a far better concealer than foundation, and enthusiastically recommend it.|`|na2axA4taa	ill google it then get back to you in a min as i want to give you the best answer i can<br>  hope my answer helped and have a nice day x
AA11461724	you should try a shampoo for oily hair and only wash the oily part with the shampoo for oily hair. part your hair separating the normal/dry part from the oily part. wash the oily part first then wash the rest of your hair with shampoo for dry hair and get a leave in treatment and put it on your split ends and get a trim. use a leave in serum too, serum is great for hair that gets tangled/knotty all the time and smooths it out. paul mitchell super skinny serum is a really good one. as for conditioner ... try mane 'n' tail, it's meant for a horse's hair so it works really well on human hair. good luck!|`|i2xLDJaraa	You should talk to a docter about overacting sweat/oil glands<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how-does_4572599_skin-produce-excess-oil.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how-does_4572599_ski...</a><br>  <br>  By the way you shouldn't wash your hair twice it makes your hair produce more oil from rubbing your scalp and the shampoo.

At the place, the guy told me it could take up to 9 months, and if it got infected, even a year, but it shouldn't be that long  I got mine done without numbing though, which made it heal a bit quicker, because my body didnt have to realise it was done 2/3 hours after i had actually got it done though    I wouldn't take it out until at least 3 months and make sure you clean it everyday with warm salt water. Try not to fiddle with it much as well because you can pass on infection into the open wound.    Good luck!|`|gQtbwpyCaa	about 8 weeks i took mine out for the first time in the shower because it loosened up all the scabby bits eww sounds mingin but it helped|`|QlnTwifraa	If u mean once you've taken it out for good, then ages.

These do kill bacteria but they also destroy your healing flesh. Dead flesh then becomes easily infected  It is possible to change jewelry during the first 6 months, but this is best done by a professional piercer. Once a piercing is healed anyone can change the jewelry|`|Y1mI9zd3aa	it depends on your body....................some people heal in four months and others heal after a year.|`|ZInh6QVOaa	hi,  i got my belly button pierced when i was 16, and vowed never to take it out until i got pregnant, altho as you get older and you dont have the body you had when you were 16, (im now 24) i decided to take it out a year ago.  now i have a have a hole where it went in and it is purple and altho the hole has closed up and i cant get it back in it still looks like a hole.  i dont think it ever really closes up.

Cartilage is also used by the body to shape and support other structures, including the nose.   Over a lifespan cartilage can be replaced by bone in certain areas, including the nose.   Cartilage can be manipulated because it is made principally of water, about 70% of cartilage is water.   Cartilage can be redistributed with movement, but cannot be made smaller with pressure.   Other components of cartilage include collagen, proteoglycans, and chondrocytes, proteins and cells that help support and build the cartilage.   Understand that to make your nose temporarily smaller using this method you are doing home surgery by manipulating the cartilage in your nose.   Wash or moisten your nose area. This isn't compulsory, but it's a little easier to do this on smooth skin.   Hold the top of your nose with your thumb and index finger.   Slowly bring your fingers to the sides of your nose. Don't press or pull because this might make the nose bloat up a little bigger and can damage the cartilage.   Do this for two to three minutes, starting at the top of your nose each time.   Repeat about 50 times a day or even more.   The results may be visible in 2-3 months time.   As soon as you stop, and if you have not permanently disfigured your nose, your nose will return to its normal shape.   The side effects of this are not postive, so you know what to do   Don't pick your nose. Compulsive nose picking, known as rhinotillexomania, can increase the size of your nose and introduce infections or more serious problems.   Before you try this technique you should be ready to continue doing this exercise every single day for the rest of your life. Your nose goes back to its original shape if you don't do this regularly.   Even while you're doing this, don't stress yourself! You look great just the way you are. We're all beautiful in our own way!   Jennifer Lopez has a weird nose and yet she is one of the most beautiful women in the world.   It Will not budge   Messing with your nose can have serious side effects including infections, difficulty breathing and even (iatrogenic) deformities.   The younger you are the softer and more malleable your cartilage is, however it also makes you vulnerable to deformity or other side effects.   Remember, your nose is probably a whole lot smaller than it looks to you.   Don't press on the nose when doing this because it makes the whole exercise useless.   Never do this if you have a good singing voice. It will change your beautiful singing voice to a flat nasal voice by changing your nasal cavity.   Also - You might move the bridge bone down too far and this will lead to breathing problems.       x0x0_LEi|`|VRxAgYyGaa	Yes,  With a darker concealer, or foundation, shade the sides of your nose with darker for smaller and lighter for brighter or larger look.

When the shop's clerk asks why your names don't match up have the friend's mom say she got through a rough divorce, and went back to her maiden name. WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T ATTEMPT TO PIERCE IT YOURSELF! (And don't go to one of those needle-gun kiosks in the mall).    There was an article a couple years back about a woman who's daughter re-pierced her own navel, got a horrible infection, and was later found by medical techs to be in ill-health, having lost quite a bit of weight, and wearing an adult diaper because she'd lost control of her bodily functions (granted this was a severe infection, and the mother was jailed for negligence). The girl made a full recovery, but is it really worth the risk?    However you get your navel pierced, be sure it's done by a professional, avoid wearing tight pants and tops, and keep it clean.|`|3lsL9YWHaa	Use Ice to numb it and then a percing ring to perce it, keep it clean use salean salushion, "sorry can't spell" you can find it at a drug store it will help to keep clean.

It looks like **** now >.|`|AA10388823	Do NOT risk doing it yourself. You could have serious complications. Better ask your parents first! And believe me, after you get it done, you would have to clean the area like two times a day. I say, don't do it! I don't even have my ears pierced yet, and I am almost 20.|`|mkAQ6Uksaa	I would never pierce myself even if I really wanted another piercing.  It could get infected and so on.  I would persuade my parents otherwise they will find out sooner or later.|`|fGdpO2U2aa	well my friend did mine but then it got infected b/c it was a huge ball and i had to take it out b/c i told my mom   but all you need is a sterile needle and a belly button ring but get a small one then you want to clean the skin with peroxide or rubbing alcohol or soap and water, then you find the middle of ur belly button and pierce it its like three pinches and a pull and u have to get it through then you take the ring and you want to make sure that the  screw is on top and the ball is on bottom and you want to clean it every hour with either a little bacertraton or how ever its spelled then take it out with in 5 days then take peroxide and clean the belly button  and soak the ring for 5 minutes then repeat it over until u feel it time to change it to another ring|`|DpbZdIsUaa	I'm in New Zealand so I can't tell you where to get it done in Connecticut or the laws you need to abide by.   When my daughter got her belly button done she was 16 and horrified to find out that they wouldn't do it unless i went down with her and gave them permission.  She was telling me about friends of hers that got theirs done without their parents having to go in etc.  I actually got mine peirced first to see how bad it was etc,  Anyway there are good piercing studio's and there are bad ones.  The good ones usually care about you and your piercing, whereas the bad ones don't really care at all as long as they get their money.  My daughters friends who got theirs done with no questions asked, all had problems, they got infections, the peircings were done crooked, one girl got her nipple peirced and it got infected really badly, now she is minus one nipple.  Another one got an infection in her belly button and had to take the bar out/ let it close up but it left a horrible scar on her belly.  Get it done professionally, don't do it yourself.  Anyone who has done it themselves without any problems have been extremely lucky.   A piercing parlour, that botches up a peircing or done one on someone under age without consent, can be heavily fined or even closed down so alot won't take the chance.  All equipment has to be sterile and new (only to be used once then thrown away).   Get your parents consent. If they won't, then wait, it'll be worth it in the long run.|`|IIkoO1cRaa	i wouldnt do it yourself. try and talk them into it, or wait till your 18. i tried doing my friends and its harder then it seems. and it could easily get infected.

ZyQFd6NVaa	Unfortunately many people aren't aware of the fact that while hair can be extraordinarily resilient, once it has emerged from your scalp is has no facility for renewing itself.  It is considered to be dead protein.    The average person has around 100,000 strands of hair on their head and the average rate of growth is a mere one-half of an inch per month.       By the time the ends of your hair actually grow down to your shoulders, they are approximately two years old.    Think about it. Two years is a long time for hair to be subjected to the daily wear and tear of the environment, washing, drying, brushing, combing and any chemical processing.  Just imagine what a piece of silk or fine fabric would look like after 2 years of constant handling.    Even if you take the best care of your hair possible, your hair still goes through a natural aging process which can also impact the growing cycle of your hair.    Maximizing Your Growth Cycle     Gorgeous Long Hair     HB.com- All Rights Reserved.     The right vitamins and minerals play a major role in keeping your hair healthy. Any nutritional deficiencies can lead to thinning hair or even total baldness.      It is a well known fact that an under active thyroid can result in frizzy or brittle hair while an overactive thyroid turn hair greasy and limp.    The bottom line to this thread is that your hair ultimately reflects the overall condition of your body.  If your body is healthy and well nourished, your hair will be your shining glory.      If you are having any health problems or suffering from any nutritional deficiencies, your hair may stop growing or show damage.    If your body is in good health, you can maximize your genetic growth cycle through taking the proper blend of amino acids and B-vitamins.      It is also important to include B-6, biotin, Inositol and folic acid in the supplemental program.  It has been found that certain minerals including magnesium, sulfur, silica and zinc are also very important toward maintaining healthy hair.    Beta-carotene is also essential to hair growth.  This is because it is converted to vitamin A as the body needs it, helps maintain normal growth and bone development, protective sheathing around nerve fibers, as well as promoting healthy skin, hair and nails.      Beta-carotene is found in green and yellow vegetables and fruits.    Protein Is Important     Gorgeous Long Hair     HB.com- All Rights Reserved.     Since hair is protein, a diet that is too low in protein may cause some thinning in hair or a retardation in the growth cycle.  The converse is true,  If you eat a protein-rich diet it will often result in improved hair growth.    Some nutritional experts suggest the dietary utilization of calves liver, brewer's yeast, wheat germ and a daily dose of two tablespoons of granulated lecithin to maximize hair growth, strength and beauty.    Other good food sources for protein include fish, eggs, beans and yogurt.  Soy protein has also been found to be helpful in stimulating hair growth.     One study of the results of soy on the hair found that it not only strengthened the hair but caused it to grow. A great source of soy is tofu.

rt3wnxw0aa	Oval faces can normally wear any style, so the only real thing you should think about is the texture of your hair. The style you mention works for just about anybody. If you have fine hair, a longer fringe is best, probably side-parted. Layers are great for both, although the type of layers again depend on the texture of your hair. If the texture of your hair means you can pretty much do anything, think about your features, make your first layer start at the spot you want to highlight, like your cheekbones or your chin. Best thing to do is look at pictures of hairstyles with hair similar to yours.|`|KvZutMEZaa	Here are the best suggestions:    http://beauty.about.com/od/hairstylephot...    http://www.beauty-and-the-bath.com/Oval-...    http://celebrity-hair-fashion.blogspot.c...    http://celebrity-hair-fashion.blogspot.c...

Some people want more boobs, some people can't get their boobs to stop growing, life is so unfair. :(|`|p7nBo7VWaa	damn.....<br>  <br>  anyways my friend went through the same thing she was flat one day and then the next it was like she was smuggling two basketballs (exaggerating) under her shirt it will eventually stop it took her 2 months i think she said ....|`|e25149c4b92661e23727bb5ebba001f7aa	Well when you are like 20 you can get a reduction, big ones can give you alot of back problems.|`|kePcrUYTaa	idk im almost a 32c so i know how u feel. all my friends tease me for it. and i cant wear tight shirts cuz guys stare. dont worry about it atleast ur not like me 5' 3" and 96 pounds. and boobs that look huge on your body. it's probly just genetic dont worry|`|lBRud4y5aa	Why would you be worried?

I am 15 and also a 34D but I think they stopped growing! Thank god! Anyway I am turning 16 in March. My mom works in a doctors office and says that having big boobs isn't bad, but if your as skinny as you say then you have to be careful. She says that she gets alot of patients who are sticks and have really big boobs and complain that their backs hurt. You should only be worried if your back is hurting. If that was the case you have to go to the doctor and get checked, because you may have to get breast reduction. I am not trying to worry you, but I am just telling you as a precaution. But other then that IT'S IN THE GENES!|`|SEMYH5Ccaa	it could be just in your geeansss.

If so, I would recommend what is called a "poofy" dress.  Formal in length with any style of bodice and a full skirt. Think: lots of petticoat. This style will help downplay some of your body characteristics, while still looking feminine and pretty. I wouldn't buy anything that you can't try on first and I would start at bridal shops that also carry dresses suitable for pageants. Pageantry Magazine has a website and the current issue is devoted to prom, and you could start getting ideas as well as finding links to retailers. I don't know where you live, but here in south Texas, there are lots of stores that carry these styles of dresses. Good luck and have fun!

GItWq2mGaa	I have dry, flaky lips so I decided to give this a try. The first step is to smooth the lip exfoliator over your lips and do a little scrubbing, this has a nice fine grit, and then wash it off. This should remove any dead and flaky skin you have. Then you top it all off with the lip silk step your lips will feel positively baby smooth. I did think this was a bit pricey when you can use any exfoliator and lip balm and pretty much get the same effect as this. But if you do buy this product you will not be disappointed, it does work. I will not be buying it again though as I can accomplish these two steps with products I already have.|`|1vaqtRI2aa	Here's a link I found of a ton of reviews on it.

GM3zog4Jaa	I have heard from a lot of people Rimmel Kohl liner is very good.<br>  If you want an expensive one, Urban Decay is good.

Black is often harsh looking, unless you want a vampish look for evening.|`|tESdl7gbaa	First off, to save yourself spending money on an eyeliner - you need to learn how to use the eyeliner you have :) . Okay so if its really hard, i suggest placing the tip between two hair straightening plates (dont close them on the eyeliner leave them open, just make sure they're on maximum heat) and hold it there for 30-60 seconds and it will soften up and feel creamy and so much easier to use. if you dont own straightener you can do this with a radiator, house fire (as in a fire, fire - dont start one HAHA) or ... a hairdryer :)<br>  <br>  otherwise, i'd suggest:<br>  <br>  m.a.c's eye kohl pencil - ￡10.77<br>  m.a.c's technakohl eye liner - ￡11.27 (ITS REALLY WORTH IT!)<br>  rimmel's eyeliner - ￡4.00 ish..<br>  barry m's super soft eye craying ￡4.50<br>  <br>  hope this all helps|`|n5G5IIbOaa	You should try Urban Decay 24/7 liner in 'stash'.<br>  It's really soft and stays on for ages without smudging. The colour stash is also good because it's a brownish/kahki colour with a slight shimmer (this is not visible at all when applied). It doesn't look brownish either, just quite subtle, not harsh like black.<br>  Or you could try swiping your eyeliner through a flame (let it cool a little first) and then applying it, which will make it go on softer.<br>  Good luck :)|`|aMNharREaa	I would try Mac, their eyeliners are nice and soft, here's their link<br>  <a href="http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CAT151&PRODUCT_ID=323" rel="nofollow">http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp....</a>|`|ILLm6gnZaa	Rimmel kohl eye pencil in jet black, its really good and recommended in lots of magazines :)|`|xrE5x6Gdaa	avon is a very good line of cosmetics, i would reccomend the eyeliners they sell anyday. <br>  i have annabelle soft grey kohl liner, i think it works great.<br>  and it was only about 10-12$ i believe.<br>  <br>  if you want to find one for you at your local drugstore you can test them out on your hand. draw a line on your hand, wait a few minutes, then try and rub it off. if it is hard to rub off, that means it will be a good longlasting eyeliner. if it wipes off, you should test a few more out.<br>  they also work better if you take a lighter and lightly put the flame over the end of the pencil, just to make it softer when you apply it and it will go on better.<br>  <br>  i always find black looks too harsh on blondes, if that is your problem.. go with a dark grey or brown.|`|3HFXZ2Oqaa	Try Avon's Glimmersticks.

0e8mlXveaa	I had a very dark colour stripped with a bleach bath (which stinks!) and then dyed 4 or 5 shades lighter and it cost around 75 pound - I live in a small town in England.

XxDZTyiNaa	sounds like a white one would work better since you already tried the beige one and it is too dark. try the white one! See how it looks!|`|Dfqu7UTJaa	Try a nude colored bra, something thing that's close to your skin.. something with too much padding is going to look too bulky and obvious under your shirt, and since you are big-chested anyhow you don't need the extra padding. I wear my nude bra almost every day under anything and everything, so I splurged a little on a really good one. You may want to do the same. Why don't you wear the shirt to the mall and go in a few different stores and try bras on under it, to see what works best for you personally?|`|NVAVj7doaa	You could try white, or you said it was too dark?

I don't know what it is; maybe it's that most guys who do have longer hair don't really like to style it. Don't get me wrong; I definitely have seen a few who can pull off long hair, but verryy few.|`|b33b2b841b148ef2f8f73241b4f3bd75aa	Not to long, but medium cut.

b33b2b841b148ef2f8f73241b4f3bd75aa	Well make sure you wash it really good before you go, maybe a double rinse to get everything out. Then make sure you use hairspray each day, becuase hairspray soaks up greesy stuff in your hair.|`|CD0JesQeaa	I would just keep it up in a pony tail.<br>  <br>  <br>  I have really long hair too (its down to my elbows) and I keep it up in situations like yours. Plus its a lot less to deal with while you are busy.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: about the baby power. I have light blonde hair so I can put it in my hair no problem. I would not reccomend using it if you hair is brown! Another thing about baby power is that it makes you hair clump together and makes the split ends puffy (and they stick up.) I would reccomend putting your hair up in a pony tail and (if you have to) put a LIGHT layer of power on the top of your head.|`|4CyXKudJaa	Just keep it up in a ponytail and try not to touch it too much. Also try to drink lots of water. Diet and exercise help prevent your hair from getting greasy, but it won't make much of a difference if you're leaving so soon.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Put a little baby powder on your hair then brush it through thoroughly until the whiteness is gone.|`|zlXofrG4aa	Get baby powder and rub it into your hair.  The powder absorbs the grease.|`|pdO8hKqnaa	wash it in a sink. hopefully there are bathrooms on the train. as well as sinks.|`|69MIm6bEaa	Make sure that you wash your hair well before you leave. Use a clarifying shampoo and make sure it's completely clean. Don't apply any products other than possibly a conditioner to the ends of the hair.<br>  <br>  After your hair is washed, put it up into a bun or ponytail. Make sure you keep it off your face. I know from experience that bangs get greasier first because the oils from the skin will transfer onto the hair making the hair greasy. At the very least you should hold your hair back with a headband.<br>  <br>  I usually go a few days without washing my hair, and it usually starts to get greasy around day 2 or 3, but if you keep it off your face it should be fine. <br>  <br>  And the baby powder trick does work, but it works best if you use a blowdrier to style.|`|goCugDOKaa	Definitely don't use product.  Try not to touch your hair either.  Get a small container of baby powder.  You can sprinkle a little bit into your hands and massage it into the roots of your hair - only the roots though, your ends usually stay less oily and you don't want to dry them out too much it's not healthy.  The baby powder absorbs the oil and makes your hair smell better. Also, you can use a scarf as a headband and pull your hair into a ponytail.  It looks cute and disguises any oily parts.|`|xrE5x6Gdaa	well, like the others have said, apply baby powder to your hair at the roots.<br>  if you do not have baby powder handy, you can also use cosmetic powder, loose powder is preferable but pressed powder will also work.<br>  just take a big brush and apply it to the roots and you should be good.<br>  <br>  try not to touch your hair alot or the natural oils in your hands will make your hair greasy faster.<br>  <br>  straight, down hair looks greasy easier. maybe try styling your hair up in a pony tail or something..braids would also work well. if you don't like putting your hair up, you could try just putting up your bangs.<br>  or another option is to scrunch your hair with gel and/or mousse although you said you did not want to do that.<br>  <br>  you can buy these pads for your face, to remove the oil and grease if you are worried about looking greasy too.. and maybe if you rubbed them along your hair it would work too ? its worth a try.<br>  <br>  although probably alot of other people on the train will not have access to showers, so they might be equally greasy.. plus, you will never see them again, so if nothing works then don't sweat it :) <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|7OBmjYHNaa	I don't know a short term fix, but...if you have greasy hair or skin - the more you wash and remove oils - the more the oil glands are going to produce - wash your hair as little as possible (when you can stand it or are home - like on weekends) and the oil production will slow down.<br>  The same with your skin - if it's oily - don't go to extremes to strip moisture - apply moisturizer and the oil glands won't feel the need to produce so much oil for you.|`|Fv9SC6zRaa	slowly bring out the days in between washes(before the trip) and your hair will get used to not being washed thus it won't get greasy quickly.<br>  when on the train don't leave your hair down and don't keep touching it like rubbing your hand through it all the time as this DEFIANTLY will make it greasy!|`|uSwtMWb7aa	yes, keep it up and before you go shampoo at least twice, maybe three times. it might dry it out a bit but thats ok. bring a powder like foundation or baby powder (cheap, because you'll use quite a bit) and when your hair starts to get to greasy put a bit in your hands and then, with your head up-side-down and hair down, work it into your roots ans scalp as if it were moouse. dont use too much, or it will show.<br>  this wont improve the texture of your hair, but it will definitelly imporve the look. brush it out afterwards.<br>  <br>  thats a really long train ride.... i'd get so bored. good luck!|`|AAYlvzbaaa	yes. baby powder is the PERFECT source for not having greasy hair.<br>  and try to avoid touching your hair at all times (esp. your scalp) because the oils on your hands go into your hair and it makes it greasy.<br>  Also brushing your hair too much makes it greasy..<br>  <br>  --kayy!<br>  *good luck!|`|ElKECev3aa	Just a little bit of baby powder on your hair really helps, Be sure to rub it in well and dont over use or else you'll have white hair.|`|IsmVnrvraa	dry shampoo!<br>  it's a godsend and you can get it alot of places, plus it's pretty cheap<br>  spray it on your hair, comb it in and you're good to go!<br>  :)|`|HcURGiOcaa	Don't wash your hair as much! Try cutting back on washing your hair because the more you wash it the more oil it is exposed to from your shampoo and conditioners.
ZUepTX57aa	I notice their eyes.  Many people have uniquely beautiful eyes, and I think not enough people are told that they have pretty eyes....but of course, I don't either, don't want to tell total strangers I like their eyes!|`|HnTpvVEEaa	omg im totally with u on the teeth! crooked teeth are annoying and VERY unattractive my friends think im wierd lol but im obsessed with teeth! i also notice eyes i deff. dont notice noses unless theyre really wierd!|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Eyes usually.<br>  And you're incredibly shallow if you hate talking to certain people just because they have crooked teeth.|`|e25149c4b92661e23727bb5ebba001f7aa	Ha, I was going to say teeth too!

QaGu72v9aa	They are looking for someone who will represent their salon in a positive way. That means friendly personality (bubbly) and attractive/well-groomed looks. You would most likely be the first person someone will see when they walk into the salon. Another big thing with salons is selling products. Many of them make most of their money by selling products such as tanning lotions and supplies. So assure them you will be a great salesperson. Background information on the salon is always good too.     Good Luck|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	most of the girls at the tanning salon are brown, supposed to be white, but brown. go in there pale *** white, that will make you stand out! HOPE YOU GET THE JOB!|`|SS87lbOCaa	i havent worked in one before but make sure you have a good explanation on why you want to work there and its always good to know some background info of the salon.  Good luck!|`|Z96XbROJaa	Do you have any experience in sales/commission-based jobs? If so, make sure you have included that in your resume/application. Most tanning salon positions are sales-based, therefore, managers/owners are looking for people who either have experience or have potential in sales. <br>  <br>  If you don't have experience, never fear! That's not the only thing they're looking for. Show that you are friendly, outgoing, and are able to interact with customers. What will set you apart most times, is a desire to learn and a willingness to work hard. Many people who apply think that tanning salons are "easy, laid-back" jobs so show the hiring manager that you're not like that. (That's so not true by the way!) <br>  <br>  Are you tanning already? At that location? If not, research a little about the salon just to get a little background information. We're not talking book report research, just enough to know what their hours are, if there are other locations, what kind of lotions they carry, etc. A lot of times interviews are in a group setting to see how each individual will interact with not only the interviewer, but the other applicants. Show that you are approachable and can make "small talk" with others. <br>  <br>  Be yourself and be enthusiastic about the opportunity to work for that company! Good Luck!|`|eQ4yXkXtaa	Be extremely happy. Like ADD SMILEY HAPPY.<br>  If you don't already tan there, why don't you go like the day before and buy some tanning visits and tan? Introduce yourself. Maybe you shouldn't mention that you'll be applying. But to see everything. Maybe they'll recognize you at the interview.<br>  <br>  I work at a salon, and all I mostly do is clean clean clean the tanning beds. It'll be really great if you know the tanning supplies. What brands are good, what tanning lotions also moisturize, which are the hot ones, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|NzHMY29caa	Well i for one hav a sister who works at a tanning salon and she says she loves it there. If i were u i would just be urself and make sure u hav a real nice tan:) Good luck!!!!
2c7c08556cdc459f7b2028cb74b1ce6faa	that would work [: <br>  <br>  you could also try a more sparkly top too, to go with the hat. A gold or red sparkly shirt would look very circus like. haha.<br>  <br>  but if you don't want to have to find a sparkly red/gold top just go with that stripped one because it is still cute. <br>  <br>  [:|`|Ym9bRgcDaa	It's a sexy circus! I like it :)|`|yVDaoZTpaa	no!<br>  its gorgeous!<br>  good choice!|`|ZooNlo77aa	I wouldn't wear that top. If you're wearing a sparkly red top hat, and you want it to be circus-y, you could wear a sparkly red top as well, or maybe a gold one. Your outfit's not gonna stand out enough with just the striped shirt, for inspiration you can look at circus themed halloween costumes and that will give you an idea of the colors and styles.|`|qDeoA37Daa	Definitely NOT!  That would look amazing but i think you should do black tights and the red hat might be overdoing it a little but take your chances ,if no one likes it at the party then throw it someplace its just a hat *i am a part time model so you should pay attention to this advice =]*|`|bmJf3AVPaa	it would not look stupid.  it would look super cute!

I think you should focus on school and being yourself, you're only 14! :)|`|RqY7HA9eaa	I've been approached to work at Hollister twice and told to come back as soon as I turn seventeen.. but that doesn't mean that they want you to model for them?

lvOR401haa	Erm...the 1970s??? Hehe just kidding -<br>  <br>  Black or something equally as bright such as yellow for the mega look.<br>  <br>  I'd say it'd depend on your colouring - if you have darker skin and hair, the yellow, or for paler skin and hair the black.<br>  <br>  :-)|`|c7818c69859401e8c0b0a3e4bd029a47aa	Maybe with a white or black v neck top or if its cold outside try them with a jumper and team it up with dr martins

So you get used to them. A drastic change like pic #2 could upset you and you will hate it, also it is more damaging to your naturally beautiful hair. <br>  <br>  2.) Your dark eyes look better with the darker hair, and adding too much blonde will be bland. <br>  <br>  3.) The damage to your hair. I regret putting any dyes in my hair more than anything ive ever done. I suggest putting only a few highlights on top, and for the rest on the bottom you can get extensions at a beauty supply store. Just google "hair extrensions" with your city name and call around for prices. Cheaper to buy and sew them yourself, even human hair.. will cost around $60-80 for a full bag of hair. They can sew it for you, or you sew it yourself. With that, you can make a few "clips" for chunks of whatever color you want for the middle of your hair (will look like highlights) or larger chunks to look like, well -- CHUNKS...   I love them. :)|`|a386ef2869afa3e59c3ae1150654e650aa	how about white? like storm.|`|8Ic3r9i8aa	well if that 1st pic of you is REAL, well im about to cry b/c (dont take this to offence) you are hot!<br>  well anyways, im no chick, but in my area, mad chicks have highlights like that. especially the Spanish girls, <br>  i can kinda see them on you, but i can see it if they were a bit darker|`|uIZDd3y5aa	dirty blonde, or light brown|`|e9JRcA35aa	I really like the second a lot, but that will make your hair more blonde than anything.

I think it would look very pretty on you.. Not too be creepy, but with the face that you have, you could pretty much pull of anyhair color.. except bleach blonde. <br>       It's not too much. When you first get it dyed, it may seem like too much, but after a couple days it'll start to blend and u'll get more used to it.|`|klOP21xTaa	If that first pic is indeed you, dont change a thing about yourself, i dont think ive seen such a preatty girl in my life, no bull.|`|0o34GTmeaa	You should go for light blonde and brown streaks.

JMBT0LSUaa	Blow Dryer+ Brush= Straight Hair.<br>  A Straightener is way easier though...|`|JEOWwUELaa	instead of a straightener, how about an iron?  :)|`|fi3HRxABaa	i use a chi iron...i have really wavey hair and it makes my hair sooooo flat. stores like walmart have them for like 20 bucks. mine was around 100, it doesnt burn my hair and has a ceramic tile that heats up the hair. min gets to 360 degrees in less then 2 minutes...it doesnt burn my hair, makes it so soft and baord straight....i couldnt or wouldnt live without my chi!|`|vigFmfLmaa	You can blow dry it straight.  Use sleekening/straightening products and good heat protection.  Or you could have it chemically done.  If your hair's not really curly that would work well, but it's pretty expensive.  I've used home straightner in mine too.  I just put it in like a home perm and combed through then followed rest of directions.  It worked ok but I've learned to not fight my waves so much.  I usually go with the flow and my hair looks healthier now.|`|1vaqtRI2aa	I'm in the same boat as you, but I have to use a straightening iron everyday.<br>  <br>  The only way you're gonna get straight hair is to use a heat protection spray, a straightening spray or gel, a hair dryer, and a round brush.<br>  <br>  Watch these videos so you know how to do it.|`|xGbmFlesaa	An iron works like magic!<br>  Put a clothe on the floor<br>  lay down and iron!<br>  Someones help would work for you|`|vwoqIUR6aa	use a round brush and a hair dryer. this should give you some volume as well. dry it in sections.|`|T8ITCq97aa	There are tons of way to straighten your hair, from a less advanced, 'weighting' your hair, and straightening gels.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beautyencounter.com/04356113.html?utm_source=froogle&utm_medium=na&utm_campaign=froogle" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautyencounter.com/04356113....</a> --- a gel like that, can be put in wet or dry, I believe, and will give you that semi, straightened feel. <br>  <br>  Also, after you get out of the shower, you can break out the comb, and blow dryer, and dry your hair while pulling into a straight position and whatnot. This is a little more time consuming, but works just as well.|`|xiK7347Eaa	After you take a shower, brush it out when its still wet. Take your blowdryer and run it down your hair so that its touching the hair. I have the same kind of hair, but its probably less curly.

8rEiZsL0aa	I have a Monroe piercing and it has been the easiest to take care of, your mouth is the fastest healing part of your body, so that's a plus :) you can change it now if you want, but when you do make sure your hands are clean and the area around your mouth....soak a cotton ball with bactine spray (does not sting, and it's my favorite to help with healing my piercings ) for about 5-10 minutes. If you dont want to use bactine, use sea salt (not table!) and water, soak that in a cotton ball and apply to your piercing for 5-10 minutes as well...do this at least 2x's a day until you are healed and you should be fine :) I hope this was helpful and good luck :D

FqM6zbepaa	ive had the same prob, my hair kept fading to a horrible gingery inbetween colour and i had to dye it dark again every month and that was pushing it , even when i went to the hairdresser, although i haven't dyed my hair now since the beginning of dec and it hasn't faded at all, first i started dying it while it was still dark not completely faded and that held better and i also started using john frieda luminous colour glaze its amazing stuff, u just put it on for 3 mins after conditioning, it has a bit of colour in it (not much just stops the fading) and makes ur hair so shiny .  just keep at it.  hope this helps x|`|qfvqOHnyaa	garnier my cousin used it last summer and still has a wonderful glow

k6D1HmtRaa	Even I have started using Trilastin Sr since last month and I can see some gud results but since my marks are old so I have to keep pateince and keep on applying it with a positive attitude coz it can take more than 2 months to get visible improvement.I think in the next 6 months I'll get rid of my stretch marks.
8e4f5CLuaa	get a pack of hairbands from asda they have not got the metal bar in them and you can get them in the sam colour as your hair also they are strong and rarely break they cost around 2 to 3 good luck please stop useing elastics as they snap and rip clumps of your hair out|`|ZyQFd6NVaa	Men should use the same hair bands that girls use. Please stop using those rubber bands because the more you use them the more they break off your hair and you dont want that. And to answer your question about there being an easier way to take off the rubber bands my answer is no.        here is an example of what im talking about: http://www.thinksimian.com/images/hair_t...|`|3lsL9YWHaa	Hair bands. They are like rubber bands but have woven cloth on the outside so rubber doesn't tangle your hair you can get like 40 for a buck just about anywears.
aLl5RGetaa	u can buy it from any shop as its very local
Jp3cWTJiaa	they are pretty much regualar haircuts just styled.... they have been teased A LOT and have been doused in hairspray... lol One of the new looks these days is what I would call an "elvira" look.... where you tease and push all your hair in a cone on top of your head... I don't like it, but then again I'm not everybody. Good luck....|`|DCwGQDO9aa	The last two are just basic Up-Do's.<br>  <br>  I don't know what the 1st one is called but if you want it print the picture and take it to your hairstylist.|`|sws4tl5Daa	UP-DO's with LOT'S OF hairspray. AND TEASED ALOT! WITH A TEASING COMB. answer my question please on the source(:|`|5HfsDZh4aa	Both pics look like they used some barrel curlers and let the hair hang in first pic and second pic curled it and pinned it up!
SroGRBUDaa	Well I believe Olive Oil would fry your hair is it only gets hotter.  It isn't considered a insulator.  I think you should try a non alcoholic insulator.  I don't know if you can go to the store or if you are looking for something from home to use.  But if you do plan on purchasing something, you can use Redken Heat Glide, its amazing for taming frizz and helping dead dry hair.  Also there is a product from Sephora called Oscar Blandi, Jazzmine Oil, it is pure jazzmine, and really conditions the hair as well as straightening.  I have had good luck with Garnier Frutice Sleek and Shine but it does have alcohol so it shouldn't be used every day.<br>  <br>  Also I use a product called Redken butter treat, its a smoothing buttery conditioner, that leaves your hair very silky after using it. (its one you rinse out but I don't rinse it out all the way).<br>  <br>  Hairspray is the absolute worst you can ever use, it is full of alcohol and just fries your hair.  They also have more natural hairsprays at Sephora, Ojon spray is made from the nut from the rainforest and is conditioning.  Ojon Twaka, is the same but has a natural elastic that makes your hair bouncy.  <br>  <br>  Most of the products I mentioned can be bought at any beauty supply, only the Ojon and Oscar Blondi have to be bought at Sephora or Ulta, or online.<br>  <br>  Blowdry downward to close the hair cuticle, if you blowdry upward you will open it up and create frizz.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  UPDATE:  From home, I would say to use some of your conditioner, very lightly and massage it in your hair.  Dont rinse, and blow dry DOWNWARD.  Do you have any oil at home?  Baby oil?  Its not the best but will add shine for this one time.  Conditioner will tame the frizz and baby oil will add shine, just dont use it often|`|u18GBKmiaa	why dont you just buy some more straighteners your hair wont be perfectly straight without them|`|58qreqK6aa	Put a little leave in conditioner in after you have your shower, or if you don't have any, then a tiny amount of normal conditioner left in after you shower will do the same thing.<br>  Try letting it dry naturally - it might be better and less dry|`|xzJi0bcSaa	I would stop blowdrying your hair, my hair is the same way so... I never blow dry if I can help it. What kind of shampoo and conditioner do you use? I would also recommend getting a leave in conditioner. I use Nexxus shampoo with hair color protectant (because I dyed my hair) and hyrosomething  or other(but pantene shampoo is really nice too) and pantene pro restoration conditioner. I also use a leave in conditioner after Im done washing my hair then let it air dry or gently towel dry it. Since Ive started using that combination. Ive used Dove in the past and that never really did anything for me nor did Suave. Give that a try. Also, keep the curling/straightening to a minimum or use the low setting because that really fries hair. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|5rsqJrFYaa	same used to happen to me...but just dont blow dry it cuz that will make it more frizzy...just let the hair air dry and then tame it down with some frizz-ease or something...really works...try it!|`|P5YJbxBdaa	Scrunch it with your fingers and add hairspray|`|0zkQaWm9aa	My hair is exactly like yours.<br>  Do you have some mousse?<br>  I don't use my hair straightener anymore because my hair is completely split from constant use.<br>  So I'm generally in the same situation as you, minus the split ends.<br>  I just put a a tiny amount of mousse from the middle to the ends, part it the way I want and brush my hair. Then I run the blowdryer over it for a few seconds (not long enough to dry it) and then let it dry naturally while brushing my fingers through it once in a while. The hair is still curly, but it's tame and it's not particularly frizzy.<br>  But you could do all this without mousse, it just works better with it.|`|WHcvP8ZVaa	Same has happened to me. when i got out of the shower all i did was towel dry my hair and put a small amount of conditioner in my hair.  after you do this blow dry hair but don't blow dry it upside down. part your hair the way you want it before blowdrying.After all that i used an actual iron.  put the ironing board all the way to lowest it can go and put sections of you hair on it to straighten.  sounds silly but it really works and steam works well just don't get too close to ur head. if it still doesn't look good after all that, straighten ur bangs with a curling iron and wear it in a ponytail it still looks good and won"t look frizzy. hope this helps some.|`|ZlXZb9P8aa	Hi well buy a round brush there not that expensive and when your blow drying your hair just run the brush through it as you blow dry it and if you towel dry your hair before you put the conditioner in then put it in and leave it for about 30 minutes to 1 hour then rinse with cold water this helps soooooooo much<br>  <br>  hope i helped :D|`|uYh1Dhvvaa	Buy a flat iron to straighten your hair.  Or ask a hair dresser what to do.  Use this conditioner: Herbal Essences Curls and Waves conditioner or Herbal Essences None of your frizziness conditioner.  My sympathies, my hair is just like yours. :)

Jp3cWTJiaa	yeah.... what? that doesn't make any sense.... add more details!!!|`|DCwGQDO9aa	What????
AA11461724	awesome! there's so many options. you can go to a pro and have them do something for you and you can also do it yourself, which is what i swear by. i had my hair done by a pro once ... i didn't get the color i wanted, my hair was really damaged and it cost me 50 bucks! but don't let me scare you. it all depends where you go and who you have do it. at home color is a great option too. most at home store bought box kits will only make your hair 2 shades lighter than your natural color, but you can make it as dark as you want. loreal superior preference is a really good one ... herbal essences color is really good too ... loreal couleur experte is really cool 'cause it comes with a base color dye and a highlight kit in one box for you to do after you dye it the base color. if you want to make your hair more than 2 shades lighter, most people go to a pro but you can still to it yourself, but you would have to go to a beauty supply store like sally beauty. you can go there, ask the girl there that knows most about hair colors and ask for her advice. if you know what color you want, ask the girl what volume of peroxide you should use. that's really important. say you have medium ash brown hair and you want medium blonde hair. you would need to get a golden blonde color bottle and some 40 volume peroxide to get your color to lift enough to be blonde. and so on and so on. if this is the way you go, just ask the girl there and she will answer all your questions. good luck!|`|iMaYLGECaa	if you're going to dye your hair get in done the first time at the salon and they can help you choose a colour too...if you do end up dyeing your hair then when your roots come back through i would try and use store bought hair dye (loreal paris is probably the best) as it would work out cheaper that way and its not difficult|`|Jp3cWTJiaa	Coming from someone that has screwed their hair up more than once trying to go cheaper and use the DIY stuff in a box you buy at the store.... PLEASE! JUST GO TO A SALON!!!! Its so much cheaper in the long run and the results are better! I spent $330 last July trying to get it fixed in California on vacation, and then I just spent $140 last month after I tried to use a box again... yes dumb, I should have already learned my lesson... lol but hey.... a $ a $ until you have a screwed up head and then you just have to shell our more $$$ to get it fixed.... Good luck!|`|sws4tl5Daa	I suggest not to, because, it will make your hair more frizzy, and it will kill the ends. More split ends. But the good thing is, a new style, but it could go bad. Then maybe you would want to dye it again &again, and again. I suggest stick to your natural color(: ANSWER MY QUESTION TOO ON THE SOURCE PLEASE(:|`|WYuIwhsKaa	visit the salon and ask someone you trust there and also you didnt show a picure of yourself or what color your hair is =D so thats all i can say.|`|5HfsDZh4aa	I don't recommend dying hair because the chemical dries your hair out and breaks it off even with hot oil treatments|`|TteTBJ40aa	I just dyed my hair for the first time yesterday. I went to a store called ULTA which is a make up/ hair store. The ladys there gave me advice about what to use. The said to not do blonde through the box because it'll be more likely to get messed up. They recommended that if i was going to dye my hair that i should go darker. I also brought friends with me to help me decide what color would look the best. I used Feria by L'oreal Pairs. It worked really well. I recommmend it for any color you choose! Best of luck!! :)|`|fc1Ih92Gaa	dyeing your hair is fine just be sure the color you are dieing it is the color you really want also DO NOT BLEACH IT !!!!!!!!! i bleached my hair and had to die it black just because it was so bright and it took all the mosture of my hair out so just be carefull but express yourself.

f5803cdda3ccc62f55a13d4aba530986aa	You are dealing with 2 different size paradigms.<br>  <br>  The 24, 25, 26... is an actual measurement of the hips (it would be waist if it were men's sizes) and is a real measurement you can depend on.<br>  <br>  The 0 2, 4, 6 etc... is the traditional "We aren't going to tell women how big our clothes are" idea that has flabbergasted women for ages.  The measurement means absolutely nothing as a size 0 from one maker may be a size 6 from another.  The sizes are simply relative to other sizes from the maker on the same product.  The more expensive the jeans, the larger a size 0 is going to be.  What my wife would tell you is "women don't want to know what size they really are" is why this is a common size scheme.<br>  <br>  So, there is not only no way to convert one size to another ... you can't even really tell what size the second measurement is compared to another maker.<br>  <br>  BTW - Marilyn Monroe was a size 16!|`|iMrrBafPaa	I think 24-30 sizes are used more in Asia or Europe.

MjUQQyU6aa	1. When you get the pierced the piercer will make you nipples hard so they stick out.<br>  2.No size of the Breast does not affect healing time. <br>  3.Everyone loved them!! Until they realized I could not stand to have them sucked or touched to much! they were to sensitive!<br>  4.They close real fast. Mine took 2 days(had them for 7 years).

Many people don't do dye their eyebrows when they get their hair done. I dye my hair blonde, but I don't dye my eyebrows. Someone said once that I should do that and I said no way! Marilyn Monroe had blonde hair and brown eyebrows, and so does Pamela Anderson.  DEFFINATLEY don't try to do it yourself... if it is something you feel will bother you, you can get it done professionally at a salon for not very much. Its not something you want to try to do yourself because the stuff you can buy is not meant for the face... it could burn your skin or make your eyebrows fall out completely. Then people would call you Whoopi and no one wants that. Another thing you can try, if you really don't want to pony up the dough to get them done at the salon is use a black eye liner pencil or a black eyebrow shading pencil to color over your eyebrows. If you keep your eyebrows plucked fairly thin this would be your best bet.|`|bWgF0NoTaa	not at all..  i dye my hair but not my eyebrows..<br>  <br>  my natural hair color is a dark reddish brown, but my eyebrows are dirty blonde.. it doesn't matter..  i wouldn't dye them though unless you go to a professional.. even then, i wouldn't do it..|`|4XYjZNWeaa	you could do but if you are gonna dye your eyebrows, go to a professional because they use a slightly different dye to the hairdye<br>  xx|`|jZORzgQyaa	YES DYES THEM.

bx0ZZEyeaa	I don't know if I can exactly help you with what you want. But when the size is a big number like 36, it's usually referred to as inches. However, it's commonly only used in men's wear. So, I would assume that it's a men's pair of jeans. However, all brands are different. If it fits you the same, then technically it's the same size, but brands always call it something different. You know what I mean? Like I could be a size 0 at banana republic, but might be a size 4 at macy's.|`|c1uqy4akaa	ok... you wear size 4 in american jeans for sure. and in nz you are definetly a size 6.

Wear mascara, and eyeliner a shade darker than your complexion.|`|nJMINFQQaa	*  If you want to make your long nose look smaller, apply foundation, a shade darker than your skin tone, on both sides of your nose. In case you have a wide nose, apply the same foundation underneath the nose where the nostrils meet. This will make the nose look smaller.<br>      * Wear eye makeup. Line your upper eye with an eye-liner and then apply a suitable mascara. By doing this, others will pay attention to your eyes instead of your nose.<br>      * Highlight your lips with a shimmering gloss. You may choose a lip color that makes you look attractive.<br>      * Highlight your cheek bones with a blush. Pink will be suitable for light skin, whereas shades of berry will look nice on darker complexion.<br>      * Take care of your hairstyle as well. Avoid slicking your hair back, in an attempt to make your nose look smaller. Instead, part your hair on the side and make it an attractive hairstyle, so that others are deviated from your nose. Do not cover your face with hair. Instead, tie it up so that you provide more facial area.<br>      * A small exercise for your nose can also bring about a significant change to its size. Hold the top of your nose with your thumb and index finger. Now, slide your fingers slowly to the sides of your nose.

oA066Stbaa	yeah iam tan too, and people always think i'm mexican or spanish or italian or greek but i'm neither. at least i don't think so. if u ask me tan skin is a lot healthier looking, everybody and wants it but can't get it. consider yourself lucky. also most guy i know have said tan skin is so pretty and beautiful. seriously enjoy your skin. my friend is so jealous of my skin cause its tan and she tried everything to get tanned it just dosen't work. but if u really wanna the try lighter shades of powder for your face although it could look weird compared to your legs or arm. so my advice KEEP OUT OF THE SUN!!! at all cost, or wear long sleeve shirts or something to cover your arms or sunscreen. legs are ok to get tanned because they look better than pale legs seriously pale legs are hideous!!!you'll look like a ghost. also wear sun block spf 50+ if u get tanned easily. and apply again every 2-3 hours. keep out of the sun stand or sit in the shade especially in the noon and afternoon cause the sun will tan u the most at that time! wear hats to prevent tanned faces, and sunglasses. try layers in light colors. like put on light shades like pink yellow and white, rather then black, navy and grey. and dress in layers like wear a tank top and throw on a zip up hoodie over it just leave it upzipped or you'll be boiling. or wear a long sleeve or 3/4 sleeve shirt over or under both are cute. try making cute summer outifts with layers so your arms don't get tanned or burned cause i want the same thing i don't like having tanned arms it's not attractive in my mind. but seriously tanned skin is gorgeous everybody loves it, be happy and love your beautiful skin no matter what, cause i'm sure everybody envies u for your skin. i bet u r b e a u t i f u l!!!!!!<br>  anyway good luck;)LOL!!!|`|DVXypPKgaa	You can't be if that is ur natural skin color sorry :-)|`|acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	The Mexicans that are "pale" at your school are probably just naturally light skinned. Unless you want to bleach your skin, which I wouldn't suggest because it's potentially harmful, you're just going to have to put up with your skin color. You could always apply a light face powder or foundation to your skin, but that could result in your skin looking blotchy since your natural skin color is darker. I had a few Mexican friends in high school, and many got lighter skin in the winter and darker skin in the summer. Perhaps you could wear sun block to protect your skin from the sun in the summer, which may prevent your skin from getting darker. Other than that, I really don't know what else you could do. You should just enhance the skin color you already have. Both fair skin and tan skin are nice.|`|oOzNMiKtaa	I know you might not want to hear this, but here goes. If you are Mexican and have tan skin, I KNOW you are VERY pretty. You HAVE to be. Every Mexican girl I have ever seen in my life, is just plain gorgeous. They have that pretty long, thick black hair, great bone structure and killer skin. I am tan (black and white) and people ENVY me because of my skin. You will get that too, I promise. Please don't try to change you skin color! When you get older,  you will be grateful for that tan skin, because you will be less susceptible for skin cancer and wrinkles, AND you will look younger then your actual age.|`|6jI9TGlzaa	hey im full mexican except im naturally light skinned sorta. during the summer i get REALLY dark though. Ive been wanting pale skin though recently because it looks overall better on me. Ive been putting on sunscreen everyday before school and sometimes during the weekend dont even go outside until night. It's worked very well and i have the light skin ive been wanting! good luck|`|0KNR3ohWaa	First of all you should not want to be pale. Seriously you shouldn't care about what other people look like and what they think. Being pale sucks really, and once you are pale you are going to wish that you were tan again.|`|sBJtxJG9aa	dude why would u want to be pale with beautiful mexican skin? there is no possible way besides plasticsurgery but that makes u all stiff and i believe it is illegal in the US|`|330718658afa202c6c1e35e1fbc8785faa	You can't really make your skin lighter than the natural tone that you were born with. They do make skin bleaching creams, but those are meant more to fade freckles and age spots on small areas of the body, like cheeks, hands, etc.<br>  <br>  But to be as pale as possible, use a high spf sunscreen every day, especially on your face. Neutrogena makes some excellent ones. (It's good for your skin too; the sun ages you!)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, but just don't forget that you are beautiful the way you were made :)|`|uoMoDCdXaa	You don't want to be pale. be happy with your color, trust me im white, some say pale (which im not THAT white) and im dying to get a tan.

TunsJLw4aa	Hi! I'm very interested in buying things from Gmarket, too but I'm too scared. It's a VERY legit site but it can be VERY confusing and difficult to use. It's similar to ebay except you don't bid, you just buy.<br>  <br>  A lot of people have complained about the difficulty of using paypal. Here is a link that will be VERY useful to use. It's a blogger who often buys makeup from gmarket and she explains everything about gmarket in full detail!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://lotuspalace.blogspot.com/search/label/Gmarket" rel="nofollow">http://lotuspalace.blogspot.com/search/l...</a><br>  <br>  Basically, the sellers on gmarket are mainly from Korea but some live in other parts of Asia as well. The sellers ship the items you buy from their online store to gmarket headquarters. From there, gmarket will package everything you ordered and ship them to you. You have to pay an estimated shipping amount upfront which is always very very expensive. But after your item has been shipped, gmarket will refund you the leftover shipping costs. The refund is gcash and you can only that money for your next order on gmarket. If you want it transfered to your paypal account it will cost you $35! So, you might as well buy something small or more items for next time.<br>  <br>  BTW, there is no certain amount you have to spend in order to buy on gmarket. Also, I heard it's easier if you use a credit card to buy instead of paypal. Like I said, please read everything from the link I gave you. It should answer all of your questions. Good luck buying off of gmarket coz I heard its a pain in the butt! lol

This is basic knowledge to anyone in the business, but the general public seems to think that your hair grows forever.<br>  <br>  As a rule, the hair generally only stays alive in the root for about4 to 7 years.  With poorer health, it is shorter, good health and it is longer.  When you have a new hair, it forms in the root, and comes to the surface of the skin.  It has a soft point on the end, no colour; as it gets older, it becomes fatter, and gets colour, and grows very fast.  After a year or two, it grows at a regular rate of about half an inch (1.5 cm) a month. As it nears it's full life, the root starts growing slower, until finally it stops altogether, and eventually the hair is shed.  It doesn't all fall out right at that moment, but by brushing, shampooing, pulling, the hair does come out.  Sometimes you may get a handful and become really worried.  That is alright.<br>  <br>  You will see that the hair at the root will have a smooth end, perhaps slightly enlarged.  If you were to pull out a live hair from the root, you would have a bulb shape on the end (and it hurts).<br>  <br>  In about a couple weeks, another hair will start to form, and the process starts all over again.  When the root dies, a new hair will never form again.  You are born with all the hair follicles you will ever have.  When you lose one, that is one less hair you have.<br>  <br>  The good thing is that all the hair doesn't stop growing at once!  Then we will shed like the animals do.  Still, we do tend to shed more with seasonal changes (we are still animals).  Because of this, we say that you may lose about 80 to 100 hairs a day.  Because you have so much hair, you don't notice these are missing.  In fact, you may lose hair over several months before you notice any thinning.  It generally takes a couple of years for the hair to get thinner. As we get older, we do have less and less hair than we did in our teens -- the peak period.<br>  <br>  The length your hair can reach is whatever you get in the 4 or 7 years that the hair lives on your head.  Some people just do not grow hair very fast, and it won't be long.  Some others can produce hair at a quicker rate, and for a longer time span.  But on an average, 7 years only produces hair of about 42" or just over a metre.  There are some rare people that can grow it a little longer than that.<br>  <br>  Because of the uneven hair growth, your hair will become wispy on the ends.  Not all the hair is of the same length; even after getting it trimmed neatly, it gets uneven in a few months.  So by trimming it neatly on the ends, it "looks" thicker, but that cannot happen.  And it may grow evenly after that, but cannot grow any faster than it did.  Cutting had no effect on the roots at all.  Cutting only makes the hair shorter, and neater.<br>  <br>  Yes, hair only grows to a certain length, and then no more.|`|A3s2eg3Aaa	i've been TRYING to grow my hair out since i was 11. i cut it to i'd say about neck length, really layer-y. i'm 16 now, and the longest its got was to just below my heart. my chest basically. that took 5 years. and i cut my hair 2 inches last month because the breakage was really bad. my hair just doesnt grow, so i use clip in extensions sometimes.<br>  <br>  it sucks lol

Tell them you are thinking of getting your hair cut shorter -- quite short -- really, really short!  Get them used to the idea.  You may find they will agree with you.<br>  <br>  Don't shave it all completely.  That looks very odd.  But cut it quite short -- perhaps to a finger width, or even a little less.  I know some that go down to about an eighth of an inch.  That's quite short, but there is still some stubble.<br>  <br>  You will find it much easier to look after, but it is cold for the first few days.  I'm sure your parents will be shocked how short it is, but will get used to it.  They may actually prefer it.  But tell them first.  Always a good policy with anything.|`|mPsNadNUaa	i would ask your parents because if i was you mom or dad i would freak if you shaved all your hair off.

rOj4B5QNaa	I have seen a guy that tattooed his face to make it look skullish (not on the internet, in person).  I felt bad because I couldn't stop staring.  I never saw it, but a bartender at my favorite watering hole had a piece of the male anatomy on her rear end.  She also had lots of random things on her fingers- a light bulb, a fingerstache, and the $@&* symbols that Wile E. Coyote would get whenever he would run into something.  She over all had the stupidest group of tattoos, but the guy with the skeletal face definitely scared the crap out of me!  I also saw a guy with "your name" tattooed on one butt cheek and his ex-wife's lips on the other.  His were kind of funny though because they fit his personality and his brother was an artist that decided to randomly tattoo him while he was passed out.|`|TJ8fgBpWaa	Obviously homemade tattoos on e guy's hands in the Army years ago: l-o-v-e on the knuckles of 1 hand, h-a-t-e on the knuckles of the other hand.

I mean his gut was the size of a small car, and he had tats all over it.<br>  <br>  But the face tattoos on prisoners is sooooo disgusting. Hopefully they aare lifers, 'cuz their chances of ever getting a job in the outside world are nil, unless it's as a freak in a carnival.<br>  <br>  Probably the stupidest, that still makes me chuckle, was a skinny short dude at the beach who had a "Kill a commie for Mommy" tattooed on his upper arm.<br>  <br>  It seems that tattoo REMOVAL is a booming business, expensive and painful.

Z96XbROJaa	It all depends on your skin type and how you tan or burn. <br>  <br>  Your initial visit will probably be spent touring the salon, assessing your skin type, and then a short tan session. Your tanning consultant will help you determine how long you need to go in for and how fast you can build up to the full amount of time. The time it takes you to build and a base and then maintain that base all depends, again, on your skin type and what kinds of beds they have. I prefer to use medium beds to my base, then mix in high pressures every few sessions. Mixing up your beds will give you amazing color. <br>  <br>  Also, invest in a tanning lotion. They can be pricey but when you average it out, the cost comes to pennies each time you use it. Try either an accelerator or a soft bronzer. My favorites for first-time tanners are Crystal by Australian Gold, and Metro Step 1 product, or Ionyx by Cal Tan. <br>  <br>  And remember, yes, the information about skin cancer is true, but just don't over-do it.|`|p6XPhIxnaa	Well it depends on how well you tan, as for me, it takes me forever to tan! So I take it super slow I start out at 8 min for a week and then slowly work my way to 15, and then go for 15 for a bout a week and bump up to the full 20. If you don't want to look bronzy (orange) be sure to get a lotion that does not have any kind of toner or bronzer in it. Stay away from the tingles as well! I would def start some time in march just to get a good full allover color! Or if you don't want to start in march at least by April|`|KGppArcfaa	Tanning beds dont make you look orange, its sunless tanners that do that. Tanning beds tan like the sun does-just quicker.<br>  <br>  When you go to the tanning salon they will asses your skin and tell you how long you should go for, i cant really tell you from here.<br>  Depending on how pale you are (it may take long for you to build a base tan) I would recommend going 3 times a week, but honestly, once you start going you'll see how your skin reacts and you can judge from there how often you should go, theres no exact rules for it.<br>  <br>  You will need a good lotion. I really like Tan-U, Devoted Creations, Designer skin and Supre lotions. I do find they are overpriced at salons, so ebay or lotiondeals.com is a good place to shop.<br>  <br>  Dont get a tingle lotion unless you want to get really dark. A good beginning lotion for you would be something with maybe one bronzer and some accelrators. If you need help finding a lotion, feel free to let me know =)|`|a6kZ2q8Kaa	You are not immortal and its not BS. Get a spray-on job - its safer.|`|sxP8G12zaa	but the "BS" about tanning beds increasing your risk for skin cancer dramatically comes from dermatologists.  i would just use self tanning cream or spray...but buy a more expensive one from a department store.|`|es3feuhxaa	when you first go tanning in a tanning bed you have a high chance of burning so you want to make sure you use a good lotion and start out at a lower time and work your way up.<br>  like 5-6 minutes your first time, then 8 minutes etc.<br>  depending on your skin type you will usually see the tan in two or three sesions.<br>  and you won't turn orange from a tanning bed unless you use some funky lotion, you turn orange from self tanners.|`|0KNR3ohWaa	I would never use a tanning bed, tanning creams work so much better and using them you don't have the risk of skin cancer. I get one from bath and body works and it works great for me. But like I said I would never use and tanning bed!!!!

THEN take a dark brown and apply it to the edges of the crease, blending down, and up again. then finally blend the edges nicely to create a nice soft finish. add a highlighting color, like ivory or white underneath your brow and youre done. a REALLY good set for this look is this set from bare escentuals: <a href="http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P101200&categoryId=S11503&shouldPaginate=true" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?...</a> <br>  just add black mascara to your top and bottom lashes, and then black eyeliner. <br>  <br>  she looks like she doesn't use blush, but you can add a nice pink blush if you want. otherwise, just use a foundation or powder in your skintone color to create a really nice smooth finish. <br>  <br>  as for her lips, go with a peachy pink. if youre looking at the mac slimshines, i'd say that from the swatches, you should pick funshine.<br>  <br>  hope i helped! <3|`|MUIEn7RWaa	first off, who would wanna look like kristen stewart? she's hideous and i bet youre way prettierthan her.<br>  but if you wanted to do makeup like her tone it down and do it natural, or else add a smoky eye here or there depending on where youre heading.

n7ZH7cyxaa	Honestly I've tried the spoon things and no they don't work. Then I was told to put vasseline on them and then freeze, but that didn't work either.<br>  <br>  But I did find something that worked :) cuccumbers! Get them from the fridge (my mom freezes them,) slice, then instead of putting the whole thing over your eye, cut it in half and put the half circle DIRECTLY on the low dark circle :) for about 20 minutes, at first it's not a huge difference (but I was told it was a noticeable difference from friends after one time) but if you keep doing it it'll really work for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have the all around dark circle-ness you can also do it this way<br>  <a href="http://www.mythbusterbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/facial.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mythbusterbeauty.com/wp-conte...</a><br>  But I find the other way better, just holding the half circles|`|nMfEX97Qaa	EHMAGAWD, YOU ACTUALLY THINK MY QUESTION IS STUPID?

Combine this with a strong sunscreen for the area around your eyes, such as Factor 30 – not only will this protect your eyes from the sun's UV rays, it will keep your skin strong.<br>  <br>  · Drink lots of water. Pure water has long been associated with smoother skin and an effective barrier against aging. · Get as much rest as you can. Not only will you feel more alert yourself, your eyes will feel less strained, reducing the chances of dark circles under them.<br>  <br>  If you have already noticed that you have dark circles under your eyes, then there are a number of methods you can make use of to reduce the circles, and they can all be used with simple household items:<br>  <br>  Cut some cool cucumber into two slices and apply them over your closed eyelids. Leave them on for 15 minutes for the best results.<br>  <br>  Similarly, get two cool teabags (normal tea, though, not herbal) and apply them to your closed eyes as you would the cucumber.<br>  <br>  Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables with Vitamin C and iron. When these two vitamins are combined, they strengthen the skin, once again reducing the chances of dark circles under the eyes

Some people prefer to have reasons...doesn't mean you have to.<br>  <br>  I really like that picture too, it's cute!|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Two of my several tattoos mean something, the rest are just pretty.<br>  <br>  Who cares if it means something?  If you love the art, get it.|`|AA12032352	I think liking the picture can be enough reason to get a tattoo. <br>  <br>  That being said I think you need to think about the picture and placement for a long while. <br>  <br>  Is it your first tattoo? Then I would say at least 6 months to a year before the needle. Also if it's your first I would think long and hard about such a visible location.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	personally, i dont think a tattoo has to have some special meaning to make it special to you. if you like it merely because the design itself speaks to you, then go for it. everything in life doesnt have to have some deep special meaning.|`|U9QSOLUtaa	It all depends on you.<br>  Now, you may love the design just because, and that's fine.<br>  However, in 10, 20, 30 years, you will probably look back on that permanent mark with a whole different opinion, and think, "Why did I do that?" There will be no reason, no memory for that to connect to, so you might regret it.<br>  <br>  I personally would think it over VERY hard, and maybe get something a little more meaningful to you before you mark it on your skin forever.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|clInlnIqaa	It doesn't have to have meaning to you. I have a cross done on my back that means absolutly nothing to me. But I love the style of the cross and the era it came from. Only thing is you have to be careful because it may not be something you would like five years down the line.|`|g3IXprk9aa	Getting a tattoo doesn't always mean it has to mean something personal to you. And liking a piece of art that you want tattooed on you, is personal.<br>  <br>  There are many art enthusiasts who get types of art and things on them for the love of it, not because there is a personal meaning behind it. Just consider it like your body is a canvas :-)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a bit!|`|fsKvR0r6aa	well i want a tatoo 2 but i want something that means something that i care about cuz remember a tattoo stays forever so pick something that is meaningful to you|`|8DjbA8ouaa	get whatever you want. i have damn stick figures shooting each other with guts everywhere. who cares if it doesn't mean anything. do what you want.|`|Jgvb2hrBaa	thats kinda big to have no meaning.. but it'd be easy enough to hide if need be.<br>  plus it's your body.<br>  it is really cute.. hah.<br>  i'm not helping that much..|`|Mo3XzhLFaa	no not really but see if you can find someone who makes/made a difference in your life and base it on that|`|C3aviMmyaa	if you like it you like it. <br>  <br>  My sister has four that she picked out on the spot and loves them

Everything SERIOUSLY CHECK IT OUT!!!|`|vigFmfLmaa	38DDD here and with boobs that big no one cares what the bra looks like - they aren't looking at the bra!  I buy mine at Lane Bryant.  The have full figured bras and even if you aren't plus sized they probably have your size.  They have some pretty ones with silk and lace and everything and others with fun prints.  I used to order stuff from Fredericks of Hollywood but I think the mailman thought I was a stripper...LOL  I know what you mean about ugly bras though.  Some look like they were designed by the military or something.  They have that pointy torpedo effect going on.|`|e25149c4b92661e23727bb5ebba001f7aa	You need to shop at a plus sized store.  Lane Bryant, Fashion Bug, Avenue.  They have cute bras that are big.  I have the same issue.|`|qAcrK4KTaa	Well if you lost some weight all of your clothes would fit better. And if you lost enough weight then hell you would have a spectacular time buying some new clothes. The "I dont want to loose my boobs" excuse is the fat chick answer.. omg if I had a dollar for every time... Besides if you did "loose your boobs" just get them Enhanced they would look a ton better anyways.<br>  <br>  As far as your question... all the good bras come in your size. Its the women who are like a size 0 - 5 who have real Huge Wonderful racks and weight like 110 or less that can't find a bra that fits. Because not enough designers realize that there are some Extremly hot women that are very small around but very LARGE up top. <br>  <br>  I blame it on all the fat girls... and the smaller girls who have a "chest" like a boy.. and not Real "Breasts" like a girl.<br>  <br>  And those are the facts to your question.|`|dvwiToU6aa	It's a shame isn't it, there's some lovely ones about but they all stop at about a C cup. I'm a 36DD myself and I know it's difficult to find particularly nice bras. Although it's pricey, I recommend you visit La Senza as they have some gorgeous sets. New Look can be quite good too, you just need to rifle around the rails quite a bit as the larger sizes are scarce! xx|`|7lmtBhdMaa	I'm a 44DD. and bras are made in those sizes only to hold them up, not be cute.|`|QsPwh6xtaa	because all the desighners are all little flat chested wanna-be's who wish they had what we got...lol :)|`|kB63WTfdaa	Maybe your shopping in the wrong stores, there are a number of items designed for cosmetically enhanced professionals.  There are specialty stores that are not 'adult' type stores.|`|oncDS4FKaa	Old Navy has really nice and sexy bras for us full figured gals :)|`|arXdjAhmaa	DKNY bras come in many sizes n they are pretty nice|`|nNJDUjYraa	It's not hard. Brands like Freya (<a href="http://www.freyalingerie.co.uk/lingerie/best+sellers.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.freyalingerie.co.uk/lingerie/...</a> -my personal fave) and Fantasie make pretty bras for those of us with big boobs. Granted, they aren't cheap, but if you're looking for cute, quality bras, I would find a place that sells those two brands.

6ecc6e12199942712e192baf0a06a2e3aa	Yes you can use the hair dye.  I have done that myself. You need to be very careful doing this so it does not get in your eyes. When your done with your hair put a little dye on your finger tip and gently rub over eyebrows. If you do not want to use the dye or if it does not get dark enough use brow liner. You should be able to find at most Walgreen's or other pharmacies. Or contact your local Avon representative.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	yeah but thats really risky and ur ebrows for dark hair are three shades lighter than ur ussuall but if ur blonde three shades lighter|`|GItWq2mGaa	Yep, brow powder with a small angled brush. The powder clings to the hairs, making brows look fuller and more dramatic. You can also use hair dye to dye your brows, but this is tricky business and best left to professionals.|`|Lwq12ZpTaa	I use Too Faced eyebrow pencil. It comes with a nice little "brush" on the end to even out the color if you need it. I love it and have used it for 5 years now.

enNFDXqSaa	Avoid anything that has a plunging neckline and make sure that you always wear a good fitting bra. You can make yourself look thinner by creating the allusion of height, wearing heels for example. Also, if you have skinny legs, do not try to emphasize that, you will look out of proportion. Wear clothes that fit, boot legged jeans will create a streamline look. To cover love handles, try getting wrap tops, this creates a gathering affect and takes attention away from the hip area. Avoid anything cropped, especially for tops, if anything, go longer, this will elongate your torso and create a thinner look.|`|JMBT0LSUaa	Try Torrid|`|WCy8G51Raa	extra large?|`|YQxxVdLNaa	Wear clothes that show off your figure. guys love that.

And remember, sweep the blush and then swirl it in circle-like motions across your cheeks.<br>  <br>  And when you're applying a darker color to the hollows of your cheeks to create a more sculpted look (this is called contouring), take the brush and follow it from where the tip of your ear starts to the middle of your cheek.<br>  <br>  I used to have a hard time doing this, but I just followed that advice and now it looks like I have awesome cheek bones. Hope this helps!|`|tESdl7gbaa	Okay, well first off, you don't need cheekbones to know where blusher goes - because its not blusher your meant to put on your cheek bones! For blusher, smile and lightly brush the blusher onto the apples of your cheeks, and this will look natural and create a fresh glow.<br>  <br>  What you really need to create the whole "contoured & cheekbone" look is a bronzer, a highlighter and perhaps a blusher.<br>  <br>  1. Using a large kabuki brush (<a href="http://www.mommymakeup.com/images/D/silver_kabuki_600x716-b.jpg)" rel="nofollow">http://www.mommymakeup.com/images/D/silv...</a> and using a light bronzer dust it all over your cheeks and a little bit down your neck, but remember light, light, light! don't go excessive or you will actually look ridiculous, your aiming for a healthy glow.<br>  <br>  2. Then if you want to use blusher, smile and apply to the apples of your cheeks, choose a blusher with golden undertones if you want a healthy glow, if not dont use the above step. I suggest rimmels blusher in 012 coral rose.<br>  <br>  3. Then, to create the 'illusion' of cheekbones, suck in your face so you look like a fishy, and taking an angled blusher brush or a small blusher brush apply a HIGHLIGHTER to the little crease that appears when you suck your cheeks in. You can also get highlighters in stick forms which are great.<br>  <br>  Highlighters;<br>  <br>  some brands to look for, for highlighters are m.a.c, nars (almost definitley) no.7, miners etc. if you can't get hold of an actual highlight, then use a white or cream eyeshadow, it does the same trick :-)<br>  <br>  i hope this helps :)|`|j7HeuFeVaa	if you feel beside your eye and bring your finger down you will be able to feel your cheekbones, you should start in a sort of line on your cheekbone and work up the cheek blending it into the rest of your skin.<br>  :)|`|pBMRDqGiaa	if yoo want ur blusher on your cheekbones then pout then u'll see da shape...if yoo want to put it on ur apples of ur cheeks then just smile and there you'll see themm aswell...<br>  well both of them work for me ... so i hp it workzz fr yoo aswell <br>  hope i helped  X;|`|7nkQyM0Laa	Ask Pikachu!|`|QuUoDkBLaa	smile and your cheekbones will reveal themselves then just apply from the apple uptowards your eye.

Or youtube it, theer are tons of vids there that can help u!|`|pOohscv9aa	Suck your cheeks in so you may look a bit like a fish at this point. and you will be able to see your cheekbones more.|`|3EBGykXEaa	its best to apply it on your upper cheek, slightly on your "nose curve" and to the other upper cheek; when you smile really big, that part.|`|wFXM8155aa	You need to suck your cheeks in and apply to your cheekbones that way
Ys0kV4O8aa	First of all, if you're a size 8 i cant see your legs being that bad :) but anyway, to tone your legs you should start doing leg exercises, look on youtube theres plenty of great ones! also, fake tanning is a great way to make your legs look great. I advise on a tanning mousse as these are more even and easy to apply :) as for hair removal, if like me you aren't up for waxing, then a hair removal cream does the trick and keeps legs smoother for longer than shaving. But apply fake tan afterwards, because the hair removal cream removes fake tan! I suggest you invest in a good exfoliater to keep your legs nice and smooth. Hope this helps :)|`|Rf2r23sYaa	If you're a size 8 then "flabby and horrible" is all in your mind. Having said that- tan skin looks thinner and more toned. So, a quick fix would be a fake tan. You can get lotion plus self tanner at any drugstore. I use one by Jergens. As far as removing hair I think just shaving is fine. For toning you legs you can do squats and lunges in your living room or running would really shape up your legs but at a size 8 I really don't think it's necessary.|`|lBRud4y5aa	Take up cycling.|`|90Gf3ajvaa	Going for a run frequently will help tone your legs. As for hair removal, either get them waxed, or use an epilater (you'll get used to the pain). But if you're a size 8, I doubt your legs are that bad. Besides if you walk out with confidence, no one will notice your legs|`|QuUoDkBLaa	To tone up your legs you should exercise in short sessions but regularly. Try skipping, running, squats and lunges!<br>  In hair removal I prefer to either shave or use deliparatory cream e.g. Veet, to get them shiny try using moisturising after baths and showers.|`|x6nnPJD9aa	My girlfriend is size 8 is I secretly think she is kind of skinny. I don't tell her that of course, because then she'll hate me.<br>  <br>  =]<br>  <br>  Try jogging if you think you have too. It's hard, but you'll have boys of you like crazy!|`|OLJekQVwaa	You could work out! Try going to the gym and use the bike for 30 min everyday and will work wonders! I promise. And about hair removal, you could try Nair or Veet. Those work really good. And about the smooth and shiny part, you could put lotion on everyday after a shower or bath. Or you could try Vaseline. That will definitely give you the shiny part that I know you like!|`|B7cI6RfZaa	Alright so I will give you the lowdown on what to do. First, for getting toned, I recommend Pilate's. It really gets them toned and it doesn't leave you achy. For hair removal, try shaving up and down the leg one for the perfect close shave. And as an extra, once you are done try leaving your legs a little bit damp then mix a little self tanner with good smelling lotion. Thanks!|`|HHJpfF8Saa	Best stuff for smooth legs-- Exfoliate!!<br>  <br>  I looove St. Ives Smoothing body scrub(like $6 @ Target)...Use in the shower w/ a pair of those exfoliating gloves($4 at Target)  a couple days a week, then use a lot of lotion.. I like Eucerin the best.. A bit expensive, but well worth it! <br>  <br>  Yoga & Pilates!|`|JfLwHEUlaa	start running and doing lunges

UoMOLXdfaa	ok, first you really need to wash your face really good every day and night. this cleans out oils and other extra things you really dont want on your face. this should give your face a nicer effect and gleam to it and prevent acne. so first put on a bit of your regular brush. dry mineral blush tends to look more natural. then put on your bronzer everywhere, but not to much. then put on some lip gloss. doesnt matter what color. i think a clear lipgloss gives my lips a nice shine and its not too much. for your eyes, take a nice skin toney gold color and apply on your eyebrow bone. that is like under your eye brow. on your eyes you can do what ever color but i like to stick with the goldish color. then you can use what ever eyeliner you want but i think liquid eyeliner looks more natural and is nice and thin. take like a navy blue or black like and put it as close to your lashes as possible. then do your maskara. there is a really nice video on youtube i will give you the link. she is makeup geek! hope this helps!|`|rZES19XPaa	don't use foundation,or bronzer, just use a dark brown eyeliner(preferably not liquid,and don't coat it on. also don't get a powder one.) use a little bit of eyeshadow each day (preferably a light tan color) then clear mascara or whatever color your hair is. if you must, use blush(peeach color?) then lip gloss. good luck!|`|ITJtxINpaa	First, wash your face really good with cold water.

Then, I would apply some dark brown eyeliner to my eyes, and curl my eyelashes. Then, you apply one or two coats of black mascara. I don't think you will need eyeshadow, but if you want, then you can always apply a light brown eyeshadow.

Wavy hair tends to behave better when it has some length/weight.  Plus if you get it too short and not layered you could have that triangle look going on.  If you get it cut I would suggest layers and let it go with it's natural wave.  Just google wavy hair styles - lots of sites out there.

sHUnctqIaa	The lip piercing is a funny one, because when there actually piercing it, it doesn't hurt much at all. It's not until a few hours later that it really starts to swell and sting. It takes about a week for the swelling and soreness to go down, during that time its really important that you keep it clean and follow all the aftercare precaution, as lip piercings can be highly susceptible to infection. I've had my ear lobes done numerous times, upper ear cartilage, nose and lip all done and I thought that the lip was one of the better ones. The upper ear hurt more on me, but it's different for everyone.|`|JqQkp3MPaa	how are you gona jump from a second hole, all the way to a lip piercing?. pierce your bellybutton or something first and see if you can handle that, its so much easier then your lip.|`|6twOL4TTaa	Lip piercings don't really hurt. Well, mine didn't. The worst part (I think) is the clamp, but that kinda numbs out the area. After, mine didn't hurt at all, but they swelled up pretty bad. When my friend got his done, it didn't hurt after, but everyone has a different pain tolerance. Just be careful about infections.
QzfHwGOQaa	I am 8.5 too and Converse will look fine. The high-tops make your feet look bigger.

2qAdwf8Daa	Cleanser, Treatment, Moisturizer.<br>  Facial foaming scrubs have more / larger granules so they really exfoliate (good for deep cleaning or bad acne). Cleansers/washes are more gentle; I guess you could say that they are not as strong as scrubs but they still get the job done (good for daily use).<br>  It is important to always use moisturizer no matter how oily your skin is because if your skin is dry, it will produce more oils to cause acne.<br>  It's also recommended that you use a facial mask about three times a week.|`|MLqtSzaMaa	That's the problem with a lot of companies. They sell you stuff that you really don't need and that complicate things. For example, Clinique will tell you to use their Acne Solutions system with their classic 3-step system, so really you're using 6 different products.<br>  <br>  Just Cleanse & exfoliate with a gentle scrub and moisturize with a oil-free moisturizer. 2 products is all you really need. I use to have acne and I never used a target solution, just the basics and I stopped drinking soda.|`|v9ZXQYnKaa	first you cleanse, it can be a scrub or foam they all work the same way<br>  Then you use a toner,<br>  Then moisturise,<br>  <br>  you can look different types to suit your skin, <br>  (dry,oily,combinations if you get both)<br>  <br>  Use all the products in a circular motion on the skin (like your doing little circle) be carful around the eyes.<br>  <br>  Any brands will do depends which smell you like they all are different on different skin types the only way to try is to buy and see how they work I would advise to use each produst for atleast 1 to 2 weeks before deciding it doesn't suit you! <br>  <br>  I no it's confusing! feel free to e-mail me if I have just confused you or if theres anything you would like to ask xx|`|BAPj9JW3aa	get a makeup remover first (if you use makeup)<br>  get a facial cleanser....i really like Alba facial cleanser($12 at drugstores)...then get a moisturizer i like cetaphil spf 15 daily moisturizer($12 at drugstores).|`|1ZfFSH6maa	cleanser, treatment, moisturizer|`|BhEVhdvDaa	The Foaming Scrub is mainly used for a mild (mild because it's foam) exfoliation. The acne wash/cleanser is for people who are acne proned. One or two breakouts a month isn't really an acne problem. You could get spot treatments for those.<br>  <br>  If you wear make up you'll need to use a make up remover first. Then use your Cleanser, then a toner, then a moisturizer, and then your spot treatment. I use Clinique's 3 step skin care routine. It's similar to ProActiv but a lot more gentle and effective.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clinique.com/templates/products/supercat.tmpl?CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY3881&cm_sp=topnavs-_-3step-_-landing" rel="nofollow">http://www.clinique.com/templates/produc...</a><br>  <br>  Take their Skin Analysis (On the left hand side) to see what skin type you are.

AA12264519	A few years ago, I had really bad acne (whiteheads and other red stuff all over my face). My parents ordered Proactiv for me and it's the best product which I have ever tried. My skin is typically oily so I didn't experience a drying effect at all.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should try a smaller amount of the cleanser, toner, and lotion. Don't overdo it.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you can use a moisturizer if your skin in very dry. Proactiv does sell one with SPF 15. Any other compatible moisturizer would work as well.<br>  <br>  Yes, I did read about the money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with their products within about 60 days or so.<br>  <br>  It's all up to you to make the final decision. Sorry that I can't be of further help.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WZ7J9Nifaa	i'm like you. i don't have bad acne but sometimes i get little break outs.<br>  i use proactive when i get them and it works good for me. <br>  i don't use it too much cause i have sensative skin.<br>   but it comes with medicated lotion so you don't have to worry about your skin getting dry.|`|EvoRPcnTaa	pro-active doesn't work for everyone. you should see a dermatologist they can help basically find out what will work for your skin type, and any problems you may have. could be your diet, sleeping conditions, even stress.|`|Mj1XqiUSaa	It really works!!! <br>  <br>  However, it's costly per month. Results show within 2 to 3 months of use. Skin will calm within 2 to 3 weeks.|`|ssT6J7ifaa	omg girl i have the same problem i have proactive here and there and it really works i love it|`|mCTFHsVXaa	yes it worked for me. but thats me and that was my skin. proactiv contains benzyol peroxide which really works for my skin but not for others. salcylic acid is also a comom ingridiet in acne products. salcylic acid does not work for me at all. <br>  so it really depends on your skin type. <br>  also if you have the energy to go through all the steps of using proactive. <br>  just try it and see.<br>  u never know.|`|2qAdwf8Daa	I use Proactiv. It works well for me but it is very pricey. I still get a few pimples now and then; my skin is not absolutely perfect. It doesn't dry your skin out because there are moisturizers that work well. I guess that overall it is not very different from the other acne products I have used such as Clearasil and Clean & Clear. Although I will probably continue using Proactiv, I'm not sure it's worth it.<br>  I have actually been wanting to try SkinID.com, but I'm not sure.|`|IKq25y8faa	My sister had REALLY bad acne and she used it and it really worked on her at least. She hasn't used it in like 2 years and her face is still clear, so it just depends on your face....everyones different!!|`|vWRk0gViaa	UMMMM.... I think that clean and clear would be better... But you can try it. Hey wat u got to lose....|`|b6BvjNrKaa	I used proactive it's true it kinda makes your skin worse so you should try skinID.com

It's in Redondo Beach, I have no idea how close this is.<br>  <br>  I really hope this helps- the salon looks AMAZING!!<br>  <br>  PS., If you go, e-mail and tell me what it's like.
3ab796e59e654e494e3c24254858129baa	I used it and it had really little to no effect at all, but my face is generally clear just a little acne here and there.<br>  <br>  A lot people I know that have used it says that they broke out much more in the first two weeks using it everyday and then gradually started to clear up.<br>  <br>  However, using it everyday could dry up your face and cause even more break outs.<br>  <br>  So be careful! It works differently for everyone!|`|mkSxfmzqaa	It differs from person to person.

BENiX8eDaa	I've seen some of the lifeguards at my daughters swim classes wearing t-back sports bras under their suits, even with the low-back style suits. I personally think it looks sporty and just fine. It shows you are practical and obviously blessed to need support anyway. It's much better than them falling out or nipping out or flopping up & down...<br>  <br>  Really, I think you could find like a nice little discreet black one with thinner straps if you look around, even in the swimsuit type of fabric, and I think it would be cute, athletic and self-respecting to wear it.|`|dVnr5EtBaa	pull a bay watch i guess? that sucks im sorry :X

Or boots?<br>  Anyway, I find that if I'm wearing flared jeans and am trying to fit them in boots, I take the bottom part and wrap it around my leg until it is smooth enough.  I then tuck (carefully, mind you!) the jeans into the boots.  It isn't too lumpy anymore.  This would probably only work if you have taller boots, though.|`|mMLci6LSaa	I've tried that too.  Looks so bad when it's bulky.  I would suggest just going with a nice pair of pumps or ballet flats, and buying skinny jeans for next time you want to wear the boots.

AA11461724	you mean blonde tips? or blonde highlights in an underside layer of your hair? either way, i think it will look good if you don't go TOO blonde. like platinum blonde would be too harsh. medium caramel or honey blonde would look awesome. good luck!|`|EZzCqUWKaa	i would try a light brown/red instead since your is almost black plus blonde would be damaging|`|HQmAP5EVaa	making the ends blonde would be very damamging.. considering how dark your hair is.. it would be pretty hard to remove the color without damaging it.

But DON’T show all your assets  at once, unless you want to look like you’re a good time girl ready for more. Choose one body part you really want to flaunt (legs, boobs, or belly) and show the other body parts in moderation. Remember – leaving something to the imagination never hurt.   <br>  <br>  When it comes to shoes, DO wear higher-than-high heels. DON’T wear stripper shoes though, that’s a bit much – unless, of course, you are a stripper. <br>  <br>  DON’T wear layers upon layers of necklaces and bracelets – it’ll look too much like a  costume. If you must layer, pick one form of jewelry to bulk up on. Necklaces if you’re wearing a cleavage-bearing top, bracelets if you’re trying to emphasize your legs.  DO match long layered necklaces or several bangles with a nice pair of sparkly chandelier earrings to catch the light, and you’re set."<br>  <br>  For your hair I would just wear it down, may be give it some nice wavy curls!!|`|o2dnH9WAaa	well my homecoming dance theme was rave, which is basically nightclub. the tradition at my school is that you make your own dresses. ours looked like this: <a href="http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-snc1/v374/44/45/600257095/n600257095_1515835_1138.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://photos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-s...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps.|`|8Ik3EQsPaa	Night Club is really cool! its sorta like you going to a Club... its sexy!! but not too sexy.. remember its a dance! lol.

GgXtwjaZaa	CoverGirl's Lash Blast Luxe Mascara is one of the best mascaras that can be found at a pharmacy for a reasonable price of about $7.50. Lash Blast will maintain curls but also adds a bit of volume and length at the same time. As for clumping, you should change your mascara (along with other makeup) every 3 months to prevent from bacteria buildup and over-used products. Otherwise, Maybelline's Full n' Soft would be another reasonable choice, although it did not my lashes did not stay curled for as long of a time.

IN6YBU8Jaa	You shouldnt do that. It is very bad for your hair, and damages it. While your hair is still damp (after taking a shower), tie it in a loose bun ( unless you want tight looking waves ) and let it air dry. After you take out the bun after wearing it for a while, you can add hairspray or something to keep the waves :) i think you shouldnt blow dry your hair at all, because it could take away some of the waves if any hairs come loose if it's still in a bun, or if you've taken it out already. Its happened to me before. :p and letting your hair air dry is better for it, it gives it a break from heat if you often style your hair. this is what I do occasionally with my hair.. Hope I helped ! :)|`|pq0c8FbEaa	mmm bad idea the chemicals in the salt water can really REALLY damage your hair! if you want it wavy then next time you take a shower do not blow dry it. put it in a bun let it sit for a while and then blow dry it while still in a bun(if you want you can add a little mousse for a little extra waves)|`|Ngny2jrCaa	Don't do that! Or this can damage your hair. <br>  <br>  Wash your hair as normal, remove all residues, use a curl enhancer product and dry it using a diffuser attached to your hairdryer.|`|6RmWCmUNaa	Maybe its the wind and the sea mist that makes your hair go wavey? mine does when its windy and i straighten mine with GHD hair straightners....try using curlers put slide through your hair so it makes it wavey and not completely curly, or try waving your strightners in and out through your hair as you go down. =)|`|iEH5MLFOaa	It is very drying to your hair.

YHvbL7VVaa	you're hair seems very similar to mine, and a couple days I ago I just got my hair cut, with just some layers, and its helped it a lot! It frames my face more so its not just dragging me down, ya know? And yes it will still look good when you curl it because I have too, it just will help it a lot, trust me. You don't need to get a lot of layers, just a few will benefit you! And I think you would still be able to pull it back as long as you don't get too short of layers! Good Luck, hope I helped =]|`|NVs2dprzaa	YES get layers|`|yrwq0gNcaa	K well my hair is very puffy and curly!! So I just got layers in my hair and it helps so much!!! Also i have to put it up in a ponny tail for all the sprots im playing!!! So yes most definitely!!!|`|xdUe5CKcaa	yep!!!|`|fRX6sSdTaa	layers are great for people with thick hair!  it thins it out in a way.  I have layers, I'm never going to go without.<br>  <br>  Yes, layers will look good curly or straight.  They will make your hair less "poofy" like you said and give it a fresh look.<br>  <br>  depending on the length of your layers, you may or may not be able to tie back your hair.  When you get your layers cut, tell your hairdresser that you want to be able to tie your hair back.<br>  <br>  If you straighten your hair you shouldn't wash your hair everyday.  Curly hair tends to dry out faster so if you straighten your hair and then wash it all the time, your hair never gets to renew it's natural oils.  When your hair is straight you should be able to go 2 days with it.  That way, it's less damaging to your hair.|`|oA066Stbaa	i have hair like that too and i layered it and it felt and looked so much better prettier and lighter and less poofy. i have gorgeous curls everybody tells me that and in layers they look so good even better than regular hair. and yes u can put it in a ponytail just maybe not your bangs, which u hould get some. side swept bangs are the best. it'll look great here are some pics of layered hair with curls:<br>  <a href="http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/side-swept-bangs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-cont...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.hrbangs.com/jessica-alba-side-bangs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hrbangs.com/jessica-alba-side...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mynewhair.info/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/side-sweep-fringe-bang-layers.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mynewhair.info/wp-content/upl...</a><br>  miley is a excellent example of curly hair with layers. her hair is beautiful i love it.<br>  <a href="http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/d/o/miley2.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/d/o/mile...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mymostwanted.com/gallery/data/3131/miley-cyrus_dot_com-vh1bigin06-2006dec12_19_.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mymostwanted.com/gallery/data...</a><br>  <a href="http://images.teamsugar.com/files/upl0/10/105309/06_2008/15475090.preview_2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.teamsugar.com/files/upl0/1...</a>|`|AMsNZDnPaa	you should try blow drying your hair<br>  first before straightening it it helps a lot<br>  and it would still look right in layers<br>  either way<br>  you can get it in layers but not really<br>  short maybe an inch off. <br>  and as long as your hair isn't really short<br>  you can still put it in layers.|`|izZ92HNtaa	Totallee!!!!!

EeabLB5eaa	The mannequin im not to sure about. But I'll google. Okay everyone says ebay so but it there.<br>  <br>  And you can wear<br>  A bright green sweater pink colored shirt underneath, pink or green or white headband, denim skirt, juicy socks pink or green (get them at centruy 21 4 cheap) and uggs and let the socks peek out. I always imagined Massie in this preppy way.|`|EiuRCypqaa	you can get a mannequin at Jo Anne's|`|EzZk2pyNaa	You're insecure. P.S. Try one of those fabric stores. They might have mannequins.
uJmGgoK6aa	considering that your hair is already blonde i wouldnt die it black  because  your skin tone probably wont look good with black hair because it would make u look even more paler than u already are. But if u have tan skin then i would suggest a light brown with carmel high-lights :)<br>      hope i helped!!!|`|Q0mcr4HSaa	auburn or chocolate brown.|`|ikekDCRxaa	From your eyebrows i'd say go for a light shade like caramel or strawberry.|`|3JWuKRycaa	wats ur fav color???<br>  if its to light than go for a dark<br>  it just may make u look diff rent|`|DySUxIn4aa	Maybe a carmel brown.. you don't want to go too dark cause it looks like you have pale skin.|`|S5utPIrgaa	an aurburn color would suit you! you are a really pretty girl but  do not put on so much make up it makes u look to fake!

AA10305732	you can get you one of those sweater dresses (in black of course, cause it makes you look slimer), a tad above the knee lenght, and then wear it with leggins and flat shoes. It is very cute and feminine but at the same time it's simple and not "too much"!|`|Ottobe8xaa	You could wear a simple yet pretty black dress that cuts just above the knee. That way it's not too dressy but it is acceptable for presentation. Or you could wear your favorite top with a black cardigan over the top and a nice skirt that again cuts just above the knee to make your legs look a little bit longer but remains acceptable. With the shoes you should go for flats because it is school but what ever you do don't wear sneakers. Good luck, hope it all goes well!|`|p4yoY1roaa	ok well a black skirt and a gray or red or even blue top. Or dress pants and a shirt.|`|Kb4yS1xsaa	u can wear black dress pants, and a nice top.|`|jPJaSIXPaa	black pants with a brown tank and a leapored vest or sweater or something and black high heeled boots or red high heels!!!|`|qAIRY6AOaa	Sweater and skirt combo sounds cute. Make sure the colors are okay and the type of skirt fits you personally. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com/lounge/types-of-skirts-935.html" rel="nofollow">http://lifestyle.iloveindia.com/lounge/t...</a><br>  <br>  Thats a website talking about different types of skirts. If you even just wore some  nice jeans but dressed up the top then you should be okay. Play around with some jewellry without going overboard. If you wanted to you could try a nice summer dress with a little cardigan over top. That would look casual but not too casual at the same time. Make sure that if you do a skirt or dress that you pair it with shoes that are appropriate. A dressy little pair of flip flops may work well. No old and "tatty" shoes such as runners and old flip flops. I hope everythin goes well! Good Luck!
r2QIbmPIaa	Use a dove product face wash. I have the same problem but I have noticed I can use any product, I just have to keep rubbing it onto my face until it;s soft. If i don't have the time i just put cream on after and it's fine.

As you do not show a picture it sounds very much like you are suffering from low self esteem.  I suppose you will now try and find a picture to post that is not actually you.  People with self confidence to do need to post such questions.
J670EOFBaa	Depending on which porn company u want to work for, but most have contact info on their sites and just email them or call them and let them know that ur interested. Thats a huge industry and they always need people to join regardless of what you are going to do there. Just let them know u would be interested in doing makeup and see how it goes. Try and apply at some big name companies that pay well instead of little crappy amatuer stuff lol that do not pay hardly anything. =)|`|paHjJrrdaa	Well simply go apply.  Bring them pictures of your work and a buisness card.  If something opens up hopefully they will call you.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I agree with the person who first replied. Good luck!|`|XXCYmARlaa	So Cocaine, you have a slutty/trashy style?
kCdISEGqaa	A full-sleeve, yes you would be hard pressed to find a job as a teacher.  My husband is a teacher and has a tattoo on each of his wrists, and has never had a problem.  But, they are not full-sleeves and they do not stand out.  You sound young and impressionable.  Grow up a little and establish your adulthood, then, when you are settled into a job, ask your administration about the possibility of adding to your tattoos.  Remember, employers can discriminate based on tattoos.|`|TJ8fgBpWaa	Think about it long and hard.<br>  <br>  And keep in mind that tattoo REMOVAL is a booming business these days; it's also much more expensive AND PAINFUL than the tattoo ever was.<br>  <br>  Finally, before I do almost anything, I ask myself: "WWJD?"|`|RY3OJxM9aa	of course my horse|`|vigFmfLmaa	It won't stop you from being a public school teacher but private schools have strict dress codes.  Some even tell the students how to cut their hair.  I wouldn't think they'd let an inked teacher work there.  (but who would want to anyway...)  Just wear long sleeves at your interview; that's the professional way to dress for an interview anyway.  Then when you've landed the job you can be more obvious with your creativity.  Just as long as you don't have any obscene tats.|`|6PhSENcXaa	Most companies frown upon this now and tattoos are not welcome into there company.  So I would think about your career options first before making a major move with this tattoo.|`|AA12041870	That all depends on where you apply for work.  The military will never take you with tattoos like that.  Some schools may find it inappropriate, too.|`|PHOyKsmPaa	Trust me, like it or not, being heavily tattooed will give people the impression your not professional.  The older you get, the more distinguished you will want to appear. Getting more tattoos will be something you will almost certainly regret in the future.|`|aAYjs8Bxaa	My husband gets crap all the time for his tattoos, but he's not exactly in a field where physical appearance is an issue..If you want to be a teacher, I'd have to say it will be an issue.|`|nKEKG0Cqaa	if you're a guy many male teachers i know wear long-sleeve button-up shirts anyway.  if you're a woman, you'll probably need some long-sleeved shirts.  i love my ink too, but, it's a professional world.|`|eRIge5D9aa	i'd cover them up at a job interview and until you get your tenure...it's a sad thing but it can narrow your job opportunities...i plan on getting a sleeve oneday..|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	It probably will since you want to be a teacher. You'd have to wear long sleeves all the time.|`|PTshTOSUaa	you probably wouldnt get a job teaching at a private school, but my cousin has tattoos tht he can cover and is a teacher|`|B3Sree53aa	it depends on who hires you and how well you hide it. I've seen teachers with loads of tattoos soo idk!|`|MpoQljzOaa	no as long as your shirt covers it at work|`|8pREK11aaa	As long as you wear long sleeves all the time, probably not.  I work at a public school, and though they are more lenient about those kinds of things, compared to private schools, its still a conservative fashion environment.|`|2D2vnHImaa	DONT GET A TRAMP STAMP|`|6ef0e0ba6af3df8415ccaf3351847985aa	at this day and age... no way... you just might have to wear long sleeves to work
lU8e0VQFaa	You NEVER remove an infected piercing, that traps the infection inside the body and allows it to fester and possibly abscess. Go back to your piercer and see what he says. You may need oral antibiotics so a trip to the Dr may also be necessary.|`|MmXHvBlNaa	My neighbors kid lost half her tongue from that ****|`|7f0mKbzCaa	I would say to go ask a doctor, because this could result in serious side effects. But you might want to remove your toungue ring. Or it might also be the type of toungue ring you have lyk the metal or something. But seariously i would go talk to your doctor.
BvjPU3wkaa	You need to go for something that is either waterproof or long lasting.   I find gel/cream liners seem to last the longest.  I would suggest either L'Oreal H.I.P cream eyeliner or MAC's fluidline.|`|23Zz2yrPaa	You have to use a liquid liner for that...but you have to be careful that it doesn't go in your eye.<br>  <br>  I use Loreal's felt tip because its really easy.<br>  <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.asp?pid=179727&catid=98579&cmbProdBrandFilter=5369" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugstore.com/products/prod.a...</a>|`|3HFXZ2Oqaa	I use avon Glimmersticks, and I never have any problems.

UnGfd71kaa	I know exactly what you mean, I've had it with the hairdressers in Lincoln, I went to talking heads expecting it to be good as it charges loads and I went out with the tips of my hair looking like paintbrushes. :(<br>  <br>  I tried Mark Jeffs for the first time and had Rachel. She gave me a really good haircut and the service and atmosphere is great. It is quite costly but defianately worth it. Good luck :)
JARRyCQVaa	Okay so I had the same problem with my ears.  You'll be fine :).  It sounds like you are really taking care of your ears unlike some other people.  Ever since I got my ears peirced, I rarley wear earings; I don't really like them.  But, every once and a while I put a pair in.  My ears are still fine.  Your ears may feel like they are closing up, but they won't.  If you got them peirced at a more proffessional place, you''l be able to not wear earings for more than 4 months and then put a pair in and they still will be fine.  You are okay and your ears are too.  :)|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Generally, you re-pierced your ears so you should go through the whole care process.  It took my ears a whole lot longer then they said it would to stay open if I didn't have earrings in so I just left my earrings in all the time.|`|FmhUZLgoaa	My ears close up after about a week and I have had them pierced for about 6 years now if not more. My routine is I take them out every 2 days and clean the ear and the earring. Your ears will  be fine just keep cleaning them and turning them!|`|chfILbonaa	Yes I have had to do that many times just clean it every night and turn them after a while they should still be okay|`|O3U7aLCDaa	Don't worry about it.  I"ve had my ears pierced for like 7 years and they still close up sometimes (I heal really fast so I"ve had to do the same thing you did and push it through.)  Just rub your ears with rubbing alcohol daily (it will probably sting but do it anyway.)  But don't leave your earrings out after you use the alcohol just put your earrings right back in.|`|qzkWahFeaa	Leave them in for a bit, and clean them lightly. Make sure not to pull on them or irritate them, so as to bring down redness and stop any pain. Even if you left them in for a while, they just started to close up, so I suggest not taking them out for a while, and maybe using earrings with thick posts to keep the holes fairly large, so if you want to put in thicker ones later it doesn't tear the skin any more.|`|zpovg4U7aa	I have a few friends who had done that before, but they always just went along with the cleaning again for a while because better safe than sorry, I guess. I would recommend that you keep cleaning your piercings every night and don't take out your earrings for a while. When I got my ears pierced I just kept them in two to three weeks longer just incase. If you see any infections or if the pain is a lot worse than when you first got it pierced, you should go see the piercer, then maybe a doctor? But most likely, I'd say you'll be fine. But keep cleaning them (including your earrings - the needle part).|`|QW5MhnB8aa	That has happened to me plenty of times. I was 8 years old when I got my ears pierced and my left one also does the same thing and i'm 17 now. You don't have to keep them in for the 8 weeks again, just keep doing what you're doing.<br>  <br>  P.S. You're ears will be fine. lol!|`|0b719092b4d69772e046d90f96e26879aa	Yes, that happens to me a lot if I leave mine out for too long. Just leave the ones you have in now, don't touch your ears, and clean them with the sanitizing liquid they give you once a day. Your ears will be fine, don't worry about it!|`|h7igZipgaa	Err well just just dump the whole bottle of the santizing bottle on your ears they gave you :] Dont touch your ears either.|`|Aojye1ROaa	Yeah happens to me all the time. It's going to be tender but don't worry it'll be allright. Just keep them clean with soap and water (no peroxide)|`|ZSOUi3B9aa	Trust me, I've done the same thing more than once. First, do not touch your ears, the oil from your skin will irratate them. Second, every night but the cleaning antiseptic on them so they stay clean. Absolutely do not take the earrings out for another month. Then, I would suggest changing the pair of earrings right after you take the others out. From there on out, ou should be fine. However, if you get a rash, redness, pain, or if the area arond your earring swells up, see a doctor to get medication. Good luck!|`|tpn7iR48aa	I would imagine that you don't have to do the whole process over again. It would be a good idea however to take them out and put alcohol all over your ear lobes and on the earrings to clean everything. The swelling should go down shortly and i would suggest getting into the habit of taking them out every now and then but not for such long periods of time. I would not use petroleum jelly if i was you as this could have caused the reaction. Just keep it clean and try to get used to putting them in and out more regularly.

Not too bad though. It'll make your eye(s) water immediately too. Shouldn't take too awfully long to heal. The healing also depends on how well you take care of it.|`|QKbUdjYTaa	Surprisingly, it really only hurts for a few seconds. I'd recommend buying a topical 10-20% lidocaine/benzocaine cream and apply about an hour before, then again 20-30 minutes prior to the piercing. Right before, just wash it off. These ingredients are often found in smaller doses in sunburn aloe to numb & I use the higher doses prior to photofacials (which are super painful). <br>  <br>  As tempting as it is to change really quickly I'd wait a good 3-4 weeks. I did at 2 and it was too early.|`|Q2gWzfy3aa	i got mine done a couple of hours ago.<br>  it barely hurt, and it doesn't even hurt now.  he pierced it and i opened my eyes and was like, "was that it?!"<br>  your supposed to leave it in for two months i'm pretty sure, and it takes a year for it to be perfect.|`|Qs9KtSfDaa	yeah, all piercings hurt, but not more than the average person is able to handle. you'll be fine

6twOL4TTaa	Your piercing will be fine, just clean it and don't play with the piercing. I've done that to my snakebites so many times when I first got them, and as long as you keep it clean, it will heal perfectly.|`|RWt78jE5aa	You probably just ripped it. You can either take it out and wait for a day to put it back in so the hole goes down a bit, or keep it in and have the hole not heal.<br>  <br>  I ripped my tounge ring down my tounge when I first got it pierced, it was a small rip tho, but after I took it out for a couple days I put it back in and now its fine =]

You can always grow into it if it's too big.|`|AA12041870	So, what is the question?  If you don't want the coat, take it back to the store.  Why did you buy something that doesn't fit?

Now I just cleanse with Clearasil every now and then, or I just use a make up remover without any problems.<br>  <br>  Have you tried Clean and Clear? I had a slight improvement with their cost-friendly products. (They're VERY affordable!) I have oily skin so they didn't work wonders for me, but they may for you!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dv8267AAaa	Neutrogena doesn't work for me at all, well maybe their deep clean... but not their lotion, toner, or neutrogena bar.

I think pretty much every product has mixed reviews. I guess there's nothing to do except to keep experimenting. I used to use Olay and Stridex. Didn't work out for me. xP|`|SVuYaK8maa	My mom use's them every day.  I can't.  They made my face brake out more and flake.  But that was stuff that was in a blue tub and was white.  I now use neutrigena that has 3 thing's in it.  Cleaner night cream and day cream.   It's not working 100 for me.  But every one is going to act different from one thing to one thing.<br>  <br>  How i know is because my child has been on 3 different type's of med's and still is not under control with what she need's.|`|SHoGWZWPaa	If they didn't work, nothing will. You are just at that age. You can go to your dermatologist and get a prescription like Retin-A. That's what I use. If you use Accutane, it makes you clear but is dangerous. You have to get blood work done monthly for 6 months.|`|1A1ozEaKaa	not really<br>  clearasil is the absolute WORST :@ and neutrogena doesn't really work ( i have the pore refining toner, and my pores havent been refined)<br>  go for all natural products, they work more effectively and are sfae to use|`|cMpV5aRsaa	i used it for a couple months and it made my face very dry and i had to use a moisterizer and all that i hated it.

The gun is not the best way to pierce your ears... you're basically having a piece of blunt metal pushed through your flesh by force by somebody trained to cut hair and not trained in piercing.

BDOBSPQnaa	Dress #1 is much cuter, and since you already own it, you're taken care of.. && I wouldn't worry so much about what the ladies think. I'm sure they wished they could still wear younger looking clothes.<br>  Wear delicate jewelery, the dress itself is enough color.<br>  Have fun. Be different.|`|4beOKtogaa	Both dresses look like they were made for teenagers, and for summer wear.<br>  For this event and this season, you're better off getting something a little longer and in a deeper color, one more suited to the season like a soft green or blue.<br>  Also, if you want to impress classy 30-40 year olds, try something with straps going over your shoulders.

Jp3cWTJiaa	If your hair is already dyed I don't think that the sun in will do anything.... that stuff works on your natural pigments not dyed. It does work though... I used to use it and probably still have the bottle somewhere.... lol but, if you do decide to try it.... make sure you read the back to make sure it says its okay to use on colored hair.... and ALWAYS do some on the underside FIRST to see what it will do BEFORE you do your whole head!!! You wouldn't want it to come out like a rainbow!!! Good Luck! :-)|`|HQmAP5EVaa	please please please dont use 'sun-in'<br>  <br>  it is horrible for your hair! i see so many girls in the salon with terribly damamged hair from using it.

HlXrHd52aa	No, not normal at all!  I get waxes on a regular basis, and yes, it hurts...and yes, you will be red and a little puffy for a while...but at the most it has lasted me a couple of hours.  I take ibuprofen before I get a wax, and that probably helps the pain and puffiness.  But it has never been painful to walk or get dressed!<br>  <br>  I would go back to the salon and have them look at it...they know that it's not a normal reaction, and hopefully they will give you your money back (I'm sure it ran you about $80).

rgNP0Qo6aa	NO!<br>  <br>  Okay... science answer:<br>  <br>  You grow in at least 80% of your hair during puberty. When you have laser hair removal the hairs it kills will never grow again. But you still have up to 20% of your normal thickness that will grow in throughout the rest of your life. So people get touch up sessions every 3-5 years after their big 6 treatments. You need about 6 treatments, one each 2 months for a year, because the hair grows in different stages and it can only kill hair in the active growth stage. The laser works by targeting dark color (the hair follicle) and passing through light color (the skin) the hair and skin have to be very different shades of color for the hair to work. The darker and coarser the hair and lighter the skin, the better results you will have.<br>  <br>  Okay... Personal Experience:<br>  <br>  I've had 2 out of my 6 treatments so far. It HURTS! It's like being poked with a sewing needle over and over, but it's not as painful as a tattoo, and that's not as painful as childbirth, maybe that can put the pain in perspective for you =) I've had my legs, underarms, and bikini area done. When you get your bikini area done they do ALL of it! Including spreading your butt and vaginal lips apart to laser all the cracks... It's sorta awkward. After the 2 treatments I've had so far I've lost about 60% of leg hair, 40% bikini hair, and 25% underarms hair. It's because the underarms hair is the thinnest and the leg hair is the coarsest. But the legs are the most painful. The more it hurts the better it works.<br>  I spent this much for 6 treatments in each area:<br>  Bikini-$750<br>  Underarms-$750<br>  Legs (toes to bikini)-$2,500<br>  <br>  Email me if you have any more questions about it!|`|f13c61e5eac8be2f275c050b8cdb9a2aaa	If you get it at the same time youll die!!!! No im sure you would be fine.. :D|`|tUtdxkDYaa	just rip it out with duck tape|`|AA12063701	Yes.|`|HO9RGUx9aa	yes you could
bx0ZZEyeaa	Measure the largest part of your head with a tape measure. One used for measuring bodies not industrial, of course. And then go to the online site and they will have a size chart. You find the size that matches up with the size of your head. Always buy rounding up in size rather than rounding down. So, if your head were 23 inch and the hat sizes are 22 1/2 or 23 1/4, you want the 23 1/2.
