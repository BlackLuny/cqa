20090309120640AADPJlQ	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Can State Police officesr pull a driver over for no reason?	I was recently pulled over by a NY state trooper because he believed my inspection sticker was expired. The sticker was issued by the DMV as a 10-day pass, enough time to get the car inspected. After he realized my sticker was legal and not expired he asked for my licens and ran my name. I was arrested for driving w/ a suspended licens. Now I understand driving w/o a licens is breaking the law (duh) but I had no other way of making it to school or work so I had to take my chances. I was informed I could get the case dismissed because I was pulled over simply because he thought my 10 day sticker would have been expired... is this true?

Okay, basically I've decided to contest a silly ticket I got for "failing to yield to an emergency vehicle" that was hundreds of feet away and it was a hot day and I had my AC on full blast & I drive a loud SUV so I didn't hear anything.       I've heard that requesting extensions for tickets is very good if you want to fight off the ticket because the cop will have a less chance of remembering everything.       Now my question is: Is it best to ask for all possible extensions then do the "submit trial by written declaration"? or will that look bad to the judge?!      Also, I'm 21 and I've only had one ticket my whole life and this is when I was 16 just 2 months after driving. Since then I've followed all laws and have never had one ticket, not even a parking citation. I'm thinking of making this point in my contest declaration along with the facts that I didn't hear anything. Is this a good idea?       Thanks

20090227150902AAo2rc1	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Slander???  I want to choke her!!!!?	Long story so I will try to make it short...      A few years ago my sister was best friends with this girl named Kate and they had been close friends for years.  Unfortunately Kate's father got cancer and died a few months after being diagnosed just days before Christmas.      Well the following summer Kate practically lived at our house for the whole summer.  Her and my sister did a lot of things together and she came with us on our family vacation to the beach.  My dad was really close friend's with Kate's father and after his death my dad felt sorry for her and wanted her to have somewhat of a father figure in her life and that daughter father friendship so my dad was there for her, helped her when she needed help, got her out of bad situations and bought her so many things.  She was practically like another sister that summer.  When New Year's rolled around my sister threw a party at our home.  Kate didn't come because she ended up going to another party with people she barely knew and they had E and cocaine there.  Well when Kate's mom asked her why she didn't go to my sister's party she gave her mom the most bizarre and horrific answer saying that my dad was a pedophile and that him and my sister were sleeping together along with many more lies.  Why she told her mother those things I don't know but Kate's mom is a bubble so she believed everything her daughter told her even though she herself knew my dad since they were teens and knew the kind of person he is.      My dad is the most caring and laid back fun person you will meet.  I almost lost him because of a life threatening heart attack he had last summer and I am so blessed that he is still here and hearing her say these false statements about him breaks my heart and angers me.  She started saying those things about my dad 3 years ago and to this day she is still saying these things to her new friends and their parents!  Why? I have no clue but is this slander?  I swear I want to rip her eyes out for talking bad about my father but she is 17 and I am 22 so would I still get in trouble for emailing her?  I wouldn't be threatening her but I just want to get my point across and tell her to STOP or she will be taken to court when she turns 18.  What can I do and what would you do if you were in my shoes?      So much for trying to make this short.....sorry                                 i

This will take the United States completely out of the picture of having ANY competetive advantage at all. I think of that cartoon on the cartoon channel called The Jetson's. This cartoon has a far better grasp of economics than America has. It's about a guy George Jetson works for named Mr. Spacely of Spacely Sprockets and his fierce rival Cogswell of Cogswell Cogs. They are both trying to get the upper hand over the other by any sneaky means possible. That's what competition is and, like it or not, that's how you survive. For example, right now Mexico has vowed an over the border trucking trade war against the United States. So rather than focus on fighting back, we have decided to let obaama and his ilk of slickmeisters extort money in order to further weaken America's competitive advantage. They figure America is too weak to get in the game anyway. I'm sure the economists in asia are getting a big kick out of this as well.

20090309135742AA2GsKl	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you agree with my view on abortion?	? Abortion should remain an option for women who are not legally married or bound by any legal documents to the potential father of the fetus, except after the second trimester.    ? Women who are legally married or bound by legal documents (i.e. civil union) must receive consent from the potential father 72 hours prior to an abortion, the woman is exempt from permission in cases of rape/incest, and her life is in danger and has been confirmed by two physicians.   ? Physicians must have the option to NOT perform an abortion in cases where the life of the mother is not threatened or there was rape/incest.    ? States must legislate whether physicians have an obligation to discuss with the woman the potential mental and physical effects of abortion or share sonograms as criteria to perform an abortion. [Excludes rape/incest, mothers life is threatened].   ? To allege rape as an excuse for an abortion a woman must have filed a police report 72 hours after the incident. [Excludes cases where the girl is underage or where there was no way for the woman to file a claim (she was threatened by abuser or kept away from authorities).

It seems that after the Reagan years our nation has frogotten about the Marxist failures in the world. Now so many would like to corrupt the only true democracy in this world. Grant it its not perfect, its up to our Citizens to hold our leadership accountable for their mistakes. However, un-Educated European Socialist are trying to break a Constitution that has had a long success vs The French Revolutionary model that so many Socialist nations have followed by Creating Political Genocides in nations that think that Socialism works. IE. Men cannot work the perfect goverment under Socilism. To much corruption, worse than ours. At least here we can go after the corrupt.

20090227151704AAWkf8b	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Slander???  I want to choke her!!!!?	Long story so I will try to make it short...      A few years ago my sister was best friends with this girl named Kate and they had been close friends for years. Unfortunately Kate's father got cancer and died a few months after being diagnosed just days before Christmas.      Well the following summer Kate practically lived at our house for the whole summer. Her and my sister did a lot of things together and she came with us on our family vacation to the beach. My dad was really close friend's with Kate's father and after his death my dad felt sorry for her and wanted her to have somewhat of a father figure in her life and that daughter father friendship so my dad was there for her, helped her when she needed help, got her out of bad situations and bought her so many things. She was practically like another sister that summer. When New Year's rolled around my sister threw a party at our home. Kate didn't come because she ended up going to another party with people she barely knew and they had E and cocaine there. Well when Kate's mom asked her why she didn't go to my sister's party she gave her mom the most bizarre and horrific answer saying that my dad was a pedophile and that him and my sister were sleeping together along with many more lies. Why she told her mother those things I don't know but Kate's mom is a bubble so she believed everything her daughter told her even though she herself knew my dad since they were teens and knew the kind of person he is.      My dad is the most caring and laid back fun person you will meet. I almost lost him because of a life threatening heart attack he had last summer and I am so blessed that he is still here and hearing her say these false statements about him breaks my heart and angers me. She started saying those things about my dad 3 years ago and to this day she is still saying these things to her new friends and their parents! Why? I have no clue but is this slander? I swear I want to rip her eyes out for talking bad about my father but she is 17 and I am 22 so would I still get in trouble for emailing her? I wouldn't be threatening her but I just want to get my point across and tell her to STOP or she will be taken to court when she turns 18. What can I do and what would you do if you were in my shoes?      So much for trying to make this short.....sorry

20090227152424AAiBuno	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you support having highway cameras to catch speeding drivers?	We have them here in Phoenix where I now live, which has some of the worst drivers in the nation.      I personally think they are a wonderful idea and we need more and more these cameras covering our highways. The fines are steep. My roommate was recently going 15 MPH over the posted limit in a construction zone, and got hit with a $175 fine. It's great to see a car zooming by me at breakneck speed, and seeing that camera flash. Boom - that driver's gonna get $175 ticket in their mailbox.       While Phoenix has mostly horrible drivers, in fairness most (if not all) people aren't interested in obeying the speed limit, and don't care if they cause property damage or hit a pedestrian. These folks need to be whipped into shape with a big fat fine. Putting up signs that say "Speed Limit 55" are interpreted as mere suggestions.      A lot of people bitterly oppose these cameras, saying they're Orwellian. But, in reality, aren't the only people who oppose these cameras just people who don't want to obey the speed limits and keep our highways safe? These cameras are not meant as a form of entrapment, otherwise there wouldn't be signs that say "Speed Enforcement Zone 300 Yards Ahead" warning drivers that they're on Candid Camera.      After all, there's a very easy way to avoid getting a ticket. It's called "obeying the speed limit". ;-)

I mean look at just these examples and tell me you can trust any system that does this kind of crap?      1. Loews lost $182 million from continuing operations last year, and its stock price sank 44%. Yet the board paid CEO James Tisch $7 million—8% more than in 2007, when Loews generated $1.6 billion of net income from continuing operations.      2.

(Rival Nasdaq dropped 50%.)       Amid the deepest economic collapse in generations, corporate America is coming up with a novel way to justify extravagant executive pay: Ignore the bad news or at least so it seems to me      Companies that sank into the red last year are looking past a host of business expenses, ranging from asset write-downs to higher-than-expected operating costs, to rationalize paying brass even more than they got in flush times.

20090309142846AATwOXI	Politics & Government;Elections	If Obama and Pelosi get socialized medicine, will you support tort reform?	Many people believe liberals support trial lawyers as a means to break the back of the health care industry, to force socialized medicine on society.       What a great strategy!  If you burden the health care industry with exccessive and frivolous law suits and make every person and company pass on HUGE costs for malpractice insurance and force patients to endure and pay for needless tests, procedures and operations (all for fear of litigation) this strategy to break the backs of the health care industry works! At the same time, you relentlessly claim that helath care costs are too high!        The USA is THE only country in the world,  who does not follow the English court of law system "the loser in the law suit, pays for the costs and harm to the wronged party".  Huh?  Only in the USA, can a plaintiff file a ridiculous law suit and pay nothing for the costs that the innocent party has to spend to defend themselves.  Only in the USA, courts are all backed up with litigation caused by trial lawyer's ability to file contingency suits where the plaintiff is looking for a "lottery award" from a liberal judge or jury filled with democrats.        If you really care about health care costs, you would support tort reform- at the least, place some reasonable limits on trial lawyers and awards but liberals fight this bitterly.  But, the issue has never really been about the costs of health care, nope, its about breaking the back of a capitalist economy to force socilaism onto the public.       If Obama and Pelosi are successful achieving socialized medicine, will they stop their "cancer of society" aka "trial lawyers"?  I guess this is an issue between the sheep and their masters. The sheep, who drink the Kool-Aid, don't have the ability to see the motive of their manipulators but the manipulators may not want to see their (wet dream) socialized medicine, fail ?          Liberals, if you get socialzed medicine, will you call off your ambulance chasers or will allow them to destroy your socialized medicine industry as they are doing to our capitalist system?

(SINCE ON 9-14 MCCAIN WAS AHEAD)       http://atlasshrugs2000.typepad.com/atlas...       Electronic Run On Banks - $550 Billion Withdrawn In 1 Hour, Federal Reserve Halts Withdrawals - US Economy Would Have Collapsed    Rep. Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania explains what former Treasury Secretary Paulson and Fed Chairman Bernanke told congress during the September 2008 closed door session. During the first third of the video an enraged caller is ranting to Rep. Kanjorski about how wasteful the first $700 billion bailout was. The best part is 2 minutes and 15 seconds into the tape where Rep. Kanjorski reveals what Paulson and Bernanke told congress that shocked them into supporting the first $700 billion bailout.      On Thursday Sept 15, 2008 at roughly 11 AM The Federal Reserve noticed a tremendous draw down of money market accounts in the USA to the tune of $550 Billion dollars in a matter of an hour or two. Money was being removed electronically.      The Treasury tried to help, opened their window and pumped in $150 Billion but quickly realized they could not stem the tide. We were having an electronic run on the banks. So they decided to closed down the accounts.      Had they not closed down the accounts they estimated that by 2 PM that afternoon. Within 3 hours. $5.5 Trillion would have been withdrawn and the entire economy of the United States would have collapsed, and within 24 hours the world economy would have collapsed.      Kanjorski also explains why Paulson spent the bailout money differently than he originally proposed.      Some other gems from the recording:      It would have been the end of our economic and political system.      We would have had to spend 3 to 4 Trillion dollars to buy up all the toxic assets. But we didn't have that much we only had 700 Billion.      Without a banking system you don't have an economy.      We are no better off now than we were three months ago.      Someone threw us in the middle of the Atlantic ocean without a life raft. We are trying to determine which is the closest shore and whether there is any chance in the world to swim that far. We don't know.      More to think about. Somebody took a lot of money out of the banks.  A lot.      So where did it go?   Who to?    http://www.capitalismgonewild.com/2009/0...

I mean I know eventually he will be an adult and be held responsible for his own actions, but I just wonder if they can make the parents pay.      Just for the record, I don't think they should make the parents pay. It was not their choice to behave in that manner and they should not have to pay the consequences. I am not sure what the answer is, but I think there should be some way found to make the boy have to be responsible for his actions.      I am not saying the girl isn't at fault here too...just that they both need to be responsible for their choices.

(granted, times were different; Kennedy became president in the middle of the Cold War)      But Teddy Kennedy has just moved this party so far to the left that it's off the charts. Two years ago, the word "Liberal" was considered an insult. Now, that word seems tame compared to the word "Socialist".       With Obama now the voice of the party, the Democrats have gone from being Liberals to Socialists.       Does anybody agree? I know Y!A is dominated by conservatives who would agree with this.

I have talked to recruiters and many others. First I should probably say I'm not a little kid who just saw Black Hawk Down and now want to be Delta Force. I know that It is more than not likely to happen, and thats why I am asking many for help. I am well aware that you need to be in the military and than from there work your way up.. But what can be done while in college to help me out in the future. Learn a new language, be an officer, join MARSOC, maybe ARSOC. Currently I can speak arabic, and have no criminal records. What should I focus on doing first to be able to work my way up. I would really appreciate the help. I figure being in the army instead of the marines would be better but that is why I ask for those who know.    I know this isn't the best place to ask but please do share your knowledge. Thank you

20090309161520AAe93kF	Politics & Government;Elections	Since we now know that Mike Steele doesn't have any balls, will the GOP elect a new leader?	Instead of rallying around its newly appointed leader Steele, GOP honchos have either taken the side of Rush Limbaugh or remained conspicuously silent. Even Steele himself caved into Limbaugh, apologizing for his remarks and removing any lingering doubt about who the real don is. By allowing Michael Steele to be publicly undressed by a party extremist, Republicans have tacitly confirmed what many of us already knew: they haven’t changed one bit. Despite their post-November promises to rise above bitter partisanship, the GOP decided to cosign Limbaugh’s anti-patriotic machinations. Instead of living up to their promise to broaden their message and appeal, Republicans have instead opted to defer to the steward of its most vile, ignorant, and bigoted constituency. Most disturbingly, they have legitimized their antidemocratic enterprise by hiring a black man,  but giving him no more political muscle than the queen of England.

20090309155340AA6Nwxe	Politics & Government;Politics	Which political figure am I?	§  I was born in one country, raised in another.     §  My father was born in another country.    §  I was not his only child. He fathered several children with numerous women.    §  I became very close to my mother, as my father showed no interest in me.     §  My mother died at an early age from cancer.    §  Later in life, questions arose over my real name.    §  My birth records were sketchy and no one was able to produce a legitimate, reliable birth certificate.   §  I grew up practicing one faith but converted to Christianity, as it was widely accepted in my country, but I practiced non-traditional beliefs & didn't follow Christianity, except in the public eye under scrutiny.    §  I worked and lived among lower-class people as a young adult, disguising myself as someone who really cared about them.     §  That was before I decided it was time to get serious about my life and I embarked on a new career.    §  I wrote a book about my struggles growing up.  It was clear to those who read my memoirs that I had difficulties accepting that my father abandoned me as a child.    §  I became active in local politics in my 30's then with help behind the scenes, I literally burst onto the scene as a candidate for national office in my 40s.  They said I had a golden tongue and could talk anyone into anything.  That reinforced my conceit.     §  I had a virtually non-existent resume, little work history, and no experience in leading a single organization. Yet I was a powerful speaker and citizens were drawn to me as though I were a magnet and they were small roofing tacks.    §  I drew incredibly large crowds during my public appearances. This bolstered my ego.    §  At first, my political campaign focused on my country's foreign policy.   I was very critical of my country in the last war and seized every opportunity to bash my country.    §  But what launched my rise to national prominence were my views on the country's economy.  I pretended to have a really good plan on how we could do better and every poor person would be fed & housed for free.    §  I knew which group was responsible for getting us into this mess. It was the free market, banks & corporations.  I decided to start making citizens hate them & if they were envious of others who did well, the plan was clinched tight.     §  I was the surprise candidate because I emerged from outside the traditional path of politics & was able to gain widespread popular support.     §  I knew that, if I merely offered the people 'hope', together we could change our country and the world. So, I started to make my speeches sound like they were on behalf of the downtrodden, poor, ignorant to include "persecuted minorities".   My true views were not widely known & I needed to keep them unknown, until after I became my nation's leader.    §  I had to carefully guard reality, as anybody could have easily found out what I really believed, if they had simply read my writings and examined those people I associated with.  I'm glad they didn't.      §  Then I became the most powerful man in the world.   §  And the world learned the truth.      Who am I???

The situation is this, I was hammered drunk at a party one of my med school buddies was throwing. So, I had a bit...well, way too much to drink, but we were all having fun and whatnot.      So, this girl I had met once before at another party was there. We started talking, etc. Eventually, we ended up in the bedroom. She was drunk, too. We ended up kissing and all that, then she told me she wanted to have sex. I was like "Okay", and we started the act.       Less than a minute in, she told me to stop and that she didn't want to. I didn't think she was serious since literally some seconds ago she was into it. So I kept going, she started screaming and here I thought she was role playing, therefore I put my hand over her mouth.      Anyways, the next day I received a phone call. It was the girl's mother who told...well, screamed at me a few things: a) that I was a scumbag, b) that I will spend decades in a jail cell, and c) that her daughter was actually underage!      I had no idea and I was shocked by this. Please, any tips here? I didn't know she was underage, nor did I realize how aggressive I'd been as I was drunker than Captain Jack Sparrow.

20090309140249AAa3UN4	Politics & Government;Politics	We just spent 800 Billion Dollars on Pork why do we need another 7 Billion? Mice or Men?	2 Questions      So if we had a Stimulus/ Recovery Package what ever that freaking thing is named       That is just one big Earmark, and we all know that is the case so why do we need another 7 Billion in pork? Is that just the 10 Billion they cut out of the Stimulus bill that was 700 billion then 800 billion then 900 Billion and then got cut back down to 850 billion? So what we did is just put off the other 60 Billion till a later date but those earmark pork barrel spending projects are getting funded? Are we Mice or Men?       We contend that for a nation to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle.      And SECOND Question?       I don’t care which party started the earmarks I don’t care which party is getting the money what I think the focus is that it is there, wasn’t there a promise that this admin said NO EARMARKS! NO WAY! Not on my watch and then boom he hits the ground running with Pork. I mean that is the truth of the matter, why not just say YES THAT IS THE CASE so we can move on and hopefully work together and unify as a people and fix it. If we were to in unity say NO! make our voice heard and say this is failed policy then maybe instead of it just being no big deal cause it is only 7 billion dollars, we can say WOW 7 billion dollars come on take it out. Lets cut every where and any where we can not just this 7 billion but there is more fat we can trim?

All of the arguments used by slave-owners to justify slavery were either ideologically or theologically conservative.      - The Conservatives' response to the first Great Depression was inadequate, inept, and counterproductive - they sought to prop up favored corporations and the wealthy at precisely the time they should have been putting purchasing power into the hands of working people. Their response to this one was and is even worse.      - Conservatives - mostly Southern Dems at the time - were the most staunch proponents of segregation.      Et cetera.      Now, why is that? Could it be that conservatism is an arcane, bankrupt ideology?

20090309122543AA3bSBs	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do you think the specter of socialism is haunting the American ruling elite?	One finds in the media increasing references to the prospect of socialism. The different factions of the bourgeoisie accuse each other of socialistic tendencies, while insisting on their own absolute commitment to the principles of free enterprise.   It is ironic that this discussion of socialism is engaging a political and media elite that for decades has promoted anti-communism and anti-socialism as a virtual state religion. No faction of the political establishment is advancing a policy that in any way challenges capitalism or the interests of the financial elite. Nor is there yet a mass socialist movement of the working class.   However, there is growing nervousness within this layer over the implications of the capitalist crisis and the potential for mass social opposition to the policies of the ruling class. Thus far, political discussion in the US has been contained within an extremely narrow framework. The diversity of views in the media and on the talk shows encompasses various shades of opinion within the wealthiest one tenth of one percent of the population.   Yet there is an objective logic to developments. At a certain point—sooner rather than later—discussion of policy will escape their tight grasp. The masses of people who are directly affected by the global depression will become involved.   There is a sense within the ruling class itself of an enormous anger building up, which, if unleashed, will assume the form of mass opposition to capitalism directed against the wealth and privileges of the financial elite. They are worried that socialism will then develop not merely as a specter, but as a living political movement embedded in the consciousness of millions of people. And they are right to be worried.    http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/mar200...    Thoughts, opinions?

20090309174528AAggIjA	Politics & Government;Politics	Whats wrong with being a liberal?	Think about it: Whats wrong with being a liberal.. Christ wasn't a conservative. He fed the hungry simply because they were hungry. He didn't require that they go to work first. He healed the sick, simply because they were sick. He didn't push them into an insurance company, or let the drug companies gouge them on prices. Jesus was a liberal; Herod was the conservative.       Moses was the liberal; Pharaoh was the conservative. Abolitionists were liberals; slave owners were the conservatives. Mandela is a liberal; the South African apartheid leaders were the conservatives. That's why conservative Dick Cheney supported apartheid over Mandela, and approved of keeping Mandela in prison.       The Suffragettes were liberals; those who opposed the vote for women were conservatives. Martin Luther King was a liberal; the segregationists were conservatives. He wanted to end racial discrimination; they wanted to conserve it.       Advocates of national health care are liberals; George W. Bush, the HMOs and drug companies are the conservatives. They profit from the current system and want to conserve it from reforms that would make health care affordable for all Americans.       America was a liberal idea. Washington and Jefferson were the liberals; King George was the conservative. America was founded on the proposition that ''We the people'' were endowed with inalienable rights -- including life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And when oppressed by an unjust ruler, we had the right to declare our independence and establish our own form of government.       And America was built by liberals -- by dissenters, by those persecuted for their religion or their race. The Statute of Liberty doesn't say, ''Send me your privileged, your wealthy, your powerful yearning to conserve their fortunes.'' It says, ''Send me your tired, your poor, your humble yearning to breathe free.''       Today the choices are equally clear. Bush and Cheney argue for tax cuts for the wealthy; they want to consolidate the wealth and power of the ''have mores'' that the president calls ''my base.''       Liberals are for rolling back tax cuts for the rich and investing in education so every child gets a fair shot. Conservatives would conserve the two Americas: one system of education, health care and retirement security for the powerful, and one for the rest of us. Liberals would make certain that everyone has the right to a high-quality education, to affordable health care, to a decent retirement.       Bush wants to cut guaranteed benefits under Social Security while privatizing it; liberals want to save Social Security so that all Americans have a basic floor beneath their feet.       Bush is against a minimum wage; liberals want to raise the minimum wage. Bush wants to weaken the 40-hour week and reduce those eligible for overtime; liberals want to make certain workers get paid overtime if they have to work more than 40 hours a week.       You can pick your side -- liberal or conservative, for change or for the status quo, for the poor or for the privileged. For me, I stand with Christ against Herod; Moses against the Pharaoh; the abolitionists against the slaveholders; King against the segregationists, the Suffragettes against the male politicians; the many against the few, and liberals against this crowd in the White House.       But whatever you choose, the next time Bush and Cheney rail about Kerry being too liberal, remember that America was a liberal idea from the start.

20090309125908AAbyUdR	Politics & Government;Military	Fenian trying to awake the British lion again?	That awful and cowardly attack on the British soldiers in Ireland yesterday,    How do the IRA think this will help them?      Dont they know that the British army can come down to county Armagh and other Catholic areas and crush them in 5 minutes?      Dont they also know that Britains can have foot soldiers walking into the Irish Parliaments in less then 3days with a full scale invasion?      So why are they once again poking the stick at the British lion?      All for what? more tit for tat?
20090309123448AAuKlP6	Politics & Government;Politics	Why doesnt Britain retaliate against the IRA like lsraeli style?	Israel now that's a country you call a proud country that despite what anyone says will do its job, make up its own mind no matter what in protecting its people from terror.      If an outrage like happened in Israel e.g them 2 poor soldiers dying like they did in Northern Ireland Israel would have turned the other guys home into a desert. Look at Lebanon and Gaza what they did to them!      So my question why didn't the British army retaliate by firing a few cruise missiles into County Armagh or other Catholics areas of Northern Ireland? and show them what happens when you dare mess with the greatest country on earth that invented Fish and Chips, Cricket, tea and crumpets, nice cool autumnal rains and the sliced bread?      Why dont Britain like Israel start taking out the Sinn Fein leadership e.g tit for tat like the Israelis have done so successfully against Hamas operatives, and nearly crippled Hamas ability to continue terror?      Why dont the Brits also attack the Republic of Ireland too and send a strong message to the Irish goverment and people in the south that we will no longer tolerate them supporting terror?       Why dont the RAF turn the clock 20 years back on Ireland and Dublin the same way the Israeli airforce did to Lebanon and made Hisbollah in the end Beg for a ceasefire?      Especially given the lesson that no amount of "talk" or agreement will suffice the terrorists given the fact Gerry Adams not condemning the attack on Sunday.

20090309164702AAVkhMZ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Has anyone ever been bound and gagged in a home invasion or robbery?	I live alone in a 1 bedroom apartment.  2 weeks ago i was sleeping when at around 3 ocklock in the moring i woke to a bright light shining in my eyes.  A man and a woman were standing over my bed, holding flashlights.  They told me to keep quiet and do as i was told, that they were just here to rob me, and that i would not be hurt.  I decided to co-operate, but was terrified.  Especially when they pulled out several lengths of pre-cut nylon rope, and told me to turn over on my stomach and put my hands behind my back.  They then proceeded to tie my wrists and ankles together, then bend my knees, tying wrists to ankles, so that my fingers actually touched the soles of my feet.  My knees were also bound together.  Then they told me i was going to have to be gagged and i almost died of embarrassmant right there.  They stuffed  some cloth in my mount til it was full, and wrapped duct tape around and around my head to secure it.  I was basically unable to move or speak.  I honestly was more humiliated then scared.  They ended up taking my valuables, and leaving me bound and gagged, where i remained for 5 hours, until i finally could roll off the bed, and dial 911 with my toes.  It was truly a frightening, embarrassing thing, and i have become much more security conscious since then.

20090309171610AAL0hco	Politics & Government;Military	Am I impersonating a soldier?	I'm a civilian turning 16 in April. I'm enlisting in the Army after high school so I'm very supportive of the armed forces of America. I recently purchased the top part (jacket) of an Army Combat Uniform. I also purchased a rank, name, branch of service, flag, and unit insignia for said jacket. All of these things were bought LEGALLY and were paid for in full. I do not own a full uniform, nor do I own any military ribbons, awards, or anything of that nature. Just the things listed above. So am I violating the law by wearing this jacket? I'm curious because I bought it all without the need for military ID or anything like that, yet many people mistake me for a soldier in public. And, it's not a full uniform. It's only the jacket. Please answer my question so I can know whether or not I am doing something wrong or dishonorable.
20090309171941AAZ4Cx7	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Cop runs in road to flag me down for speeding. Contest it?	Coming home from a nice hike at a state park with my dog. I am driving along casually behind a big red I think Dodge truck. I am in the lane to the left of the big truck and behind him. I am in a small champagne colored Pontiac Vibe hatchback.     All of a sudden I see a person step in the road as the big red truck passes a car. Its a person and they look like they are going to keep walking in front of my car!!! I freak out omg I dont want to hit them! then he stops walking points at my car then points to the side of the road. Its a cop!! So I like slam on the brakes and pull to the side of the road. All this happened in like a fraction of a second. My heart is pounding in my freakin chest and Im kinda shaky all over!    The officer comes up to my window and I say omg I thought I was gonna hit you! Why were you runnin in the road behind cars? That red truck had my view blocked of him completely!    He gets pissed off and says he wasnt going to site me. But he has decided to now. He said he clocked me at 65 in a 55. Im wondering how since my view of him was completely blocked by the big red truck until he stepped in the road. also the red truck was goin abit faster then me I think I was goin to slow in the left lane so he was passin me on the right which i could care less. I think he clocked the red truck is this possible?      The cop told me I need to calm down and I made a mistake and said excuse me for being upset about thinking I was about  to hit another human being. I do have problems with anxiety and overreacting but I dont feel like I was wrong here.      I know I will prob have to pay the ticket regardless but I feel like goin to court just to say how messed up I think it is that cops are running in the middle of the street to flag people down. I mean I could have ran over him and he was all calm about it. I would have felt horrible.       What do you guys think? should I bother going to court to give them a piece of my mind or just send the money in and forget about it?      This young cop will prob die if he keeps running in the middle of the road like that.

We've been approached by buyers looking for this sort of thing. Even if we did want to sell this sort of stuff, it can't be found. Then we hear about dealers in border states selling hundreds to straw buyers every week and quickly getting them down to the war zone in Mexico. Over 1,000 murders this year alone. It is next to impossible to legally buy a gun in Mexico, yet Mexican criminals are buying what you can't. Seems to me something is wrong and it has NOTHING to do with the current President.
