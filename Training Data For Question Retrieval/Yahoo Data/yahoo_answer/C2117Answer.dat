oOly8Wj2aa	The answer depends heavily on what you're using as your e-mail software. If you're using web-based software like Google Mail, Hotmail, or Yahoo! Mail, then this is probably caused by a slow internet connection or by web browser plugins that interact with your mail. If you're using an offline mail client, it can be caused by any number of things, such as too much e-mail being in the Inbox or in the mail software in general, a broken copy of the e-mail software, or a lack of free hard disk space.<br>  <br>  If you're using Microsoft Outlook, consider using the "Compact & Repair" option you might have, or try deleting some old, large e-mails. Unfortunately, I can't give you suggestions for every e-mail package available (there are thousands) here, so if you want more specific advice, you'll need to ask a more specific question.
cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	In order to refer to a photo on Yahoo Answers you must upload it to a photo site. Three examples are Photobucket, Flickr, and TinyPic. You then post the complete address, including http://, in your question or answer.<br>  <br>  For Photobucket copy the "direct link" under the photo and paste into your question or answer.<br>  For Flickr click on "all sizes" above the picture then copy "Grab the photo's URL" at the bottom.<br>  For TinyPic use the "Direct Link for Layouts".<br>  <br>  NOTE: Do not post a picture and ask if the person is pretty or to rate them. That is considered chatting and is a violation of the guidelines.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?

1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	To encourage participation and reward great answers, Yahoo! Answers has a system of points and levels. The number of points you get depends on the specific action you take. <br>  <br>  While you can't use points to buy or redeem anything, they do allow everyone to recognize how active and helpful you've been. (And they give you another excuse to brag to your friends.)<br>  <br>  Levels are another way to keep track of how active you (and others) have been. The more points you accumulate, the higher your level. Yahoo! Answers recognizes your level achievements with their special brand of thank you's!<br>  <br>  And finally, as you attain higher levels, you'll also be able to contribute more to Yahoo! Answers - you can ask, answer, vote and rate more frequently.<br>  <br>  For more information about points and levels in Yahoo! Answer, click the link below ▼▼|`|n4tPArAAaa	spend them on asking questions<br>  points attract you to yahoo answers so you can keep answering questions you lost them by asking too many questions and being naughty<br>  look at the point system by clicking on how many points you have|`|415b73f4e9911495575d995988a025aeaa	The yahoo answers point system has been instituted by the administrators to give a motivation for people to answer questions on the site. Think about it: if their was no motivation for users to limit the amount of questions they ask, and answer that of others, yahoo answers would be pointless. People would post, but no one would answer. The asker would post, only to later on be disappointed in finding out that no answers have been given. Users would lose purpose, quit, and pretty soon, yahoo answers would be an unused service. You can thank the point system for the answers that you will receive on this very question.<br>  <br>  The point system for yahoo answers is pretty simple. Basically, for every question you answer, two points are added to your count. For every unresolved question that is in voting, you can gain a single point by voting for a best answer. However, be weary of the amount of questions you post. For each question asked, 5 points are deducted.<br>  <br>  As you gain points, you will increase your Y!A level. Y!A has a system of seven levels. When a user begins the service, they start at level one, and are given 100 points to get them going. Once your point count exceeds 250, you move up to level 2. At 1000 points, you become a level 3. This system goes on until you gain 25,000 points, making you a level 7.<br>  <br>  Level 1: 1 - 249 points<br>  Level 2: 250 - 999 points<br>  Level 3: 1,000 - 2,499 points<br>  Level 4: 2,500 - 4,999 points<br>  Level 5: 5,000 - 9,999 points<br>  Level 6: 10,000 - 24,999 points<br>  Level 7: 25,000+ points<br>  <br>  For each level increased, you will gain rewards that you can use to improve your influence on yahoo answers. For example, once you reach level two, you gain the ability to rate answers with a thumbs up or a thumbs down. You will be able to answer and ask more questions per day as you get a higher level, and once you reach level five, you will not be limited to the amount of questions you can answer and ask.<br>  <br>  For more information on the yahoo answers point system, see this link: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_system;_ylt=AtIrPstAwZrfT7XsQOY56Hjpy6IX;_ylv=3">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...</a>

Once a question is in 'voting' or has been resolved via a Best Answer being chosen, the question belongs to Y!A and is in their database forever (or until they start archiving old Q&As anyway).<br>  <br>  To delete your question while it's still open, go to the question page, pass your mouse over the pencil icon in the toolbar below your question, and click Delete Question.<br>  <br>  It works the same way for your answers.<br>  <br>  :o)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/ask/ask-76322.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...</a>|`|AA10520442	You can delete an open question you have asked by using the pencil icon underneath and choosing "delete" from the dropdown menu.<br>  <br>  A resolved question can only be removed by Yahoo, usually as a violation.<br>  <br>  You can make your profile private and opt out of accepting fans/contacts.  Your questions will still be on YA but no one can find them all in one place if your account is private and you don't have fans/contacts.

hqLFfXs7aa	Not only do I feel these people are fishing, but maybe the women are working for them.  If you have noticed that they tell you to go to an online site for their safety and it's free to join.  When you open a account and try to look at their profile the online service then wants money.  I think they work for the online service and collect a commission on all the guys they can get to join up.  When I have asked about this to the women in question I have not gotten a response back.  Like the previous answer stated, be very careful.|`|Flpy5bLkaa	hmm,,,,ive been getting the same thing and honestly i think its a big scam i mean all the messages i have received have also been the same so my conclusion is that most of them are bots..so i wouldnt trust them if i was you because just as when you are chatting on yahoo messenger when you get those annoying cam show request...well they are bots fishing your information

cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	In order to refer to a photo on Yahoo Answers you must upload it to a photo site. Three examples are Photobucket, Flickr, and TinyPic. You then post the complete address, including http://, in your question or answer.<br>  <br>  For Photobucket copy the "direct link" under the photo and paste into your question or answer.<br>  For Flickr click on "all sizes" above the picture then copy "Grab the photo's URL" at the bottom.<br>  For TinyPic use the "Direct Link for Layouts".<br>  <br>  NOTE: Do not post a picture and ask if the person is pretty or to rate them. That is considered chatting and is a violation of the guidelines.<br>  <br>  ? ??l???q ?

I find it more annoying when people ask questions which could quite easily be answered using their search engine.<br>  Questions such as: 'What is the capital of Burkina Faso?', 'Where is Timbuktu?', or 'Who wrote the novel Shirley?'<br>  I'd call them lazy.<br>  Last week a colleague called me and asked if I could find telephone numbers of hospitals in Enugu, Nigeria. I told her I was busy, but that I was sure I could find them. Which I did. It took me less than 2 minutes. It has to be said that my colleague is not a native English speaker, so I understood why she asked me.|`|82niQjyCaa	yer the names idiots|`|g0xB8Z1Oaa	I also get sick of the ones who post a link, saying answer mine....bleat, bleat bleat!|`|eO1o511daa	The only thing that annoys me is when they can't be bothered to check their spelling, and use i instead of I when talking about themselves.|`|s1qUJ4aJaa	www.dirtbikes.com<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry, I couldn't resist|`|3FKMMoXkaa	yh they are annoying|`|0bckNgILaa	Sometimes, those irrelevant links contain viruses.

1ac3781b361a0972a1980084331b52c5aa	You cannot tell who has reported you, it's anonymous. If you guess that the asker is the one who reported you, this is only a probability. Usually for your answer or question to get deleted, more than one trusted reporter should report you.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	The only thing you know when you report a question is the name on the avatar, the same thing when you report an answer, just an avatar name.  I am led to believe that the person who has been reported does not know and will never find out the name of the person/avatar who reported them.<br>  You could answer a question and another answerer comes along and takes exception to your answer and could report it. Its one of life's mysteries.|`|u7vrul2Faa	I never just assume it is the questioner as it often can turn out to be either one of the other answerers or somebody who is browsing the question. There is no way of knowing unless they tell you that they have reported you, plus it usually takes 2 or more people to get your answer reported and removed with success.|`|CJvHQl5vaa	You can't know, and you can't assume it is the person who put out the question.  A lot of members here are more than ready and willing to report abuse of the YA section.  Usually it takes more than one person making a report to get something deleted.|`|AA11408911	The reporting system (community moderation) is completely anonymous, as such any of the 130 million users world wide could technically have reported your content. <br>  <br>  All the best<br>  Chεεrs|`|JhvqUvlsaa	No it is anonymous; you can only guess who it might be.|`|1thzSbS8aa	Don't assume anything. You could have been reported by the asker, by another answerer, or by a user who merely opened the question and read your answer. All three possibilities are EQUALLY likely.|`|LIxpXTnLaa	I go to the question and just spam the asker and all the answerers. It's more fun that way anyway.

Que pergunta mais complexa esta heim!<br>  Mas eu acho que o ideal  é amar e ser amado… mas nem sempre e possível e muitas das vezes temos de optar ou somos amadas(os), ou amarmos…  a escolha é bastante difícil a meu ver, pois vamos sofrer das duas maneiras. Se escolhermos ser amados acho que nunca vamos ser realmente  felizes, vamos fazer sofrer a pessoa a quem n?o queremos magoar, vamos estar a magoar a pessoa que nos ama, a meu ver ser amado só tem uma coisa boa sobe o “ego” as pessoas que s?o amadas.. Amar sem receber nada em troca também magoa mas magoamos  a nós próprios n?o faz mos ninguém sofrer, há sempre aquela adrenalina toda de conquistar a pessoa que amamos, todo aquela coisa do frio na barriga, parece que somos as pessoas mais “parvas” do mundo, coisas próprias do amor, talvez. Eu sou sincera se tiver de escolher escolho amar, prefiro sofrer que fazer sofrer… prefiro amar, lutar, sentir aquela adrenalina, sentir que somos pequeninos ao pé de quem se ama..<br>  <br>  beij?o no ? meu lindo!|`|3IdpRUsIaa	Amar!!!<br>  Abra?o!|`|5bec40e88b25e969c2c25868b1d83b21aa	Amar.|`|7ffad7099d37f5d59d72b929dd5b763faa	Bahhh............. boa pergunta?

6SJ8QHKcaa	Shame on him for not thinking of the advantages for his daughter!  We never know if we will be able to be there for our kids or not, so we do all we can do JUST BE THERE!  Our kids look up to us & depend on us.  Sure, we all fuss when we get bombarded with a lot to do, but come on!  This is his child!!!!  Maybe he finds it "too feminine" for him to do,but it's really about supporting his child ... it's not about HIM!<br>  <br>  I'm sorry you had to go through this, but in the future, I wouldn't depend on him.  We women generally have to do it all anyway.  That's why we are the stronger sex!|`|pFlkWQySaa	Don't be too sure that he's not experiencing some depression. It's the only thing that could excuse his boorish behavior.|`|RnHDnSgPaa	spoiled little whiney brat!!!<br>  <br>  first of all<br>  ie he is just collecting unemployment and has nothing to do he should be spending more time with his kids!!!<br>  <br>  once he is older he will realize how much he screwed up!<br>  his kids will turn 18 and it will feel like it was just yesterday they they were kids and he wasnt there for any of it!<br>  <br>  and he needs to get a job<br>  sounds like a kid!|`|Wb1ydezNaa	It sounds like he has gotten so used to being at home without any "outside" responsibilities that doing something is like an unwanted chore.In my opinion you are not being too hard on him.you offered for him to participate in a school project for your daughter.I would suggest,even with him looking for work,doing some activities outside the house,even if it's going to the park or something,being indoors all the time is not healthy|`|AA12262089	he is acting like a kid. your child will only be little once while they are growing up sharing their activities is the best thung you can do. you will never regret what you are doing. but your husband will when your child is grown and has no time for him. you hang in there|`|cJLVPyAFaa	I don't know what kind of husband you have but right off the top of my head I think maybe he just realized that he would be totally out of his element with a class of 5 year olds  (the more he thought about it , it probably got scary to him). He needs to realize that there are times we have to step out of our comfort zone and get involve especially when it has to do with our kids. Can you sit down and talk to him and get an idea what responsibilities he is willing to take on to help while he is unemployed? Keep the lines of communication open it's the only way to truely know what each of you expect at this time. Good luck to you|`|DSrLXRS0aa	be strict with him<br>  tell him to get his a** up or your gonna slap him in the mouth <br>  cause he promised yesterday<br>  tell him he's being immature and your sick of his sh*t<br>  rip the video game out of the wall|`|Plu6OVoGaa	He was being jerk but being unemployed can hurt a man's pride. <br>  <br>  *He isn't your father. Every parent is different.|`|bajMF7LLaa	he needs to suck it up and be a man and put the child in front of gaming.<br>  <br>  I'm on your side|`|33d7210d104ceb5ac8526a1cc2d5871baa	You just answered it yourself.  Yes, he is being a spoiled brat.  I was laid off nearly 4 months ago and aside from continuing my writing, my time is free.  Its no big deal to help out at a child's school or to do some volunteer work.  Its not like he has anything else to do. <br>  And you are absolutely right that this is time he will never get back and never see again.  It is so important for him to grab each and every moment in his child's life right now because when its gone... it will never come back.  Then he will be asking himself why he doesn't have a good relationship with his daughter.|`|OwxsF94Gaa	Well;as a father ; it is his responsibility to take care of his child and help her in her school work.<br>  <br>  From his prespective; he seems to be frustrated because he is desperately looking out for a job; which I presume hasnt found one yet.<br>  Hence to relax and to divert his mind; he is playing video games.<br>  Even ; if you force him to help the child in her school project ; he may not be able to give his 100% as he is already frustrated.<br>  <br>  I would recommend you to understand his situation and be compassionate towards him. <br>  Having said that; then you can make him realise; that helping the kid would help him divert his mind and relax.<br>   Also; it would help him boost his confidence.<br>  So by this way; you would have a WIN WIN situation.<br>  <br>  Remember " Restrictions lead to revolution". <br>  If you restrict or force  things on anyone ; even a CHILD; the person would always be tempted to do the opposite. <br>  Eg: If you ask anyone not to smoke; he/she would SMOKE.<br>  Thats human psychology...<br>  Hope that answers your query and helps you resolve the issue...

acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	The same thing happens to me. When I upload a photo and save it, the picture doesn't show up. I only get a box with a red square in the corner and the picture doesn't get uploaded. I don't know what the problem is. It's been this way for a week from what I've noticed, maybe more. My picture's in the right format, JPEG, and is under the recommended size. Maybe it's a glitch or they're going through updates? I'm unsure.|`|7u77AiBjaa	Make sure that the image you're using is under 5 MB in file size and is JPEG-formatted. You may need to re-save the image in Microsoft Paint (or another photo-editing program). If you are trying to get your 360 image appear as a picture on Yahoo! Answers, make sure to follow the instructions below. It's not clear that you actually have a Yahoo! 360 profile:<br>  <br>  <br>  Create a 360 space at <a href="http://360.yahoo.com">http://360.yahoo.com</a> . Click "Get Started" button on the far right section of that page. After going through the activation process, you can click on the teeny tiny "Yahoo 360 Home" link on the upper right of that page (or the 360 main page) to get into the 360 space.<br>  <br>  Make sure a JPEG formatted photo (with .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe extension) under 5MB is saved to your hard drive.<br>  <br>  - Click your "My Page" link at the top<br>  - Click "Edit Profile/Personal Photos" over the empty picture frame<br>  - Click "Browse" and upload photo into an empty field. Then click one "use as primary" radio button on the right before saving (if you've uploaded more than one image).<br>  <br>  You can't upload more than 4 profile pictures (this includes an avatar). Make sure that you are following the 360 Personal Photo guidelines here: <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/guidelines/guidelines-06.html">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/360/gui...</a> .<br>  <br>  Then, come back to Yahoo! Answers.<br>  - Make sure that it is the same Yahoo ID that you used for 360.<br>  - Click the "My Profile" link to the upper right of this Yahoo! Answers page, then click "Edit My Info" in the top left box on the Answers profile page.<br>  - Scroll down to the image section and check the option of showing the 360 picture. Click Preview and then the OK button. Then, WAIT.<br>  <br>  NOTE: The image may not show up right away in Y/A, as it sometimes take hours, days, or weeks for the system to catch up. So, in the meantime, you will be without any picture on Y/A (a gray unisex icon) or an old 360 image. Just go through the above process and let your picture stay that way until the system makes your 360 image appear. If you don't want to wait, then just use a Yahoo! Avatar (<a href="http://avatars.yahoo.com">http://avatars.yahoo.com</a> ) and forget about using the 360 image.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS: <br>  *** If the 360 space is recently activated, you may want to wait a few days before changing settings, as Y/A may not recognize that you have a 360 space right away.<br>  *** You may want to enable all the communication options on your Y/A profile and/or enable the Simple URL option in your Yahoo! 360 "Basic Info" and "Blog" settings pages. Sometimes that helps make the Y!360 image appear in your Y/A profile for an unknown reason. You still may have to wait for anything to happen though. <br>  *** Although, some people have found limited success in continually trying to re-select the 360 image option in their Y/A profile. I recommend waiting though, as to not inadvertently cause further delay.<br>  *** Some people never see an image show up. You can always post a bug report (or piggyback on other's bug reports) on the issue at the Y/A forum: <a href="http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answers">http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...</a> . This link between Y/A and Y!360 has been buggy for years.|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	First check your settings. Make sure you set the 360 picture as “primary” and saved then go to your profile check that “use my 360 picture” is set, click preview then OK.<br>  <br>  But having said that With the ongoing work by yahoo engineers on changes for the new version of yahoo 360 expected sometime soon (see the blog below for more info), some delays with the 360 avatar can be expected, and it can take minutes to days for the avatar to show.<br>  <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-1qCkw2Ehaak.hdNZkEAzDrpa4Q--?cq=1&p=59806">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-1qCkw2Eha...</a>

Get a restraining order against them, film the poor behavior if you can, and then call the police and let them do their jobs.  "To protect and serve" means just that.  Granted, they will probably try to retaliate if they are the kinds of people they sound like, but they would do that anyway if they are already getting more aggressive now.  It may get a little rough temporarily, but things should get better.  <br>  <br>  Also, hopefully it will never come to this, but in this day and age self defense classes for yourself and any of the kids that are old enough aren't a bad idea in general.|`|AA11830777	Don't reply to the insults.

yugSHwd1aa	Hi, there are a couple of ways you can go about doing this. It kind of depends on exactly what you are trying to do, but I can give you several options.<br>  <br>  1)If you are trying to email a picture to your friends: First, get the image you are trying to send. If you have it on your computer already, skip this step.If you are downloading it from a camera, then you need to plug the phone into your computer and download it to your computer. Name it, and store it where you can find it. If you want easy access to it, you can simply store it on your desktop. If it is on your phone, go a head and email it to yourself and then download the image from your email to your desktop. To do this, you simply click on the image within your email and you will be prompted by the computer to save it etc. Just follow the prompts. If it is on the internet, you can either right click on it and do a "save as", then name it and save it to your desktop. Ok, so now you have your image on your desktop and named appropriately so that you can easily find it. <br>  <br>  2)Now you are ready to put the image somewhere that your friends can access it.There are also a few different ways to do this.One way is to simply upload it to either your Myspace page or facebook or whatever. If you do have an account with either of the sites mentioned, go ahead and email your friends and tell them to check out your page to see the picture. OR, you can upload the image to a new email message and send it out to your friends as an attachment to the email. In turn,they will be able to download the image to their computer and look at it that way. If you don't know how to do that, you simply click the attachment icon (Depending on what email acccount you have, you just need to search around a little bit for the icon, sometimes it looks like a paperclip or something like that) You will be prompted after clicking the add an attachment icon to find the image on your computer and choosing the image from your desktop and it will be attached to your email. Another way to do this is to go to the site called photo bucket. (photobucket.com) I haven't been to the site in a while, but I do remember that you need to register to make an account and I believe you simply upload the image to your account. Then you can send a link (by copying and pasting the url to an email and send out the information that way, OR Photobucket may have a way to send out an email that will give directions for your friends to access your account page with the image very easily. There are plenty of easy to understand directions on that photo bucket site.<br>  <br>  There are three different ways for your friends to see your images. If you still have problems, then I would reccommend doing a search on the internet for something like 'uploading images to my computer', or 'sharing  photos with friends on the comptuer' or something like that. Good luck. If you still have problems, add to your "yahoo answers" original question and post your problem. I will check back in with the question to see if I can help any further<br>  <br>  Good luck
02217d0e7d25f290ffa319e130d7b364aa	depending what Yahoo you have click on TOOLS then OPTION or INTERNET OPTIONS...once in there you can see what is entered for your homepage...which should be yahoo.com.

If you were creative and made that up instead of giving something factual that you couldn't possibly forget, and don't remember it, you'd be out of luck.

Yahoo will not just give it to you without proper proof.|`|L4rlu2BDaa	Yahoo don't give passwords, you usually have to choose your own password when signing up for an account.

(i.e. Microsoft Outlook, yahoo, etc.)  <br>  With Outlook you will need to check your system settings.  It is possible that your system unchecked the settings.  It is also possible you have a virus.  Do a complete virus scan and defrag your computer.<br>  If you are in a more common email setting, like yahoo, then you will need to call customer support under the contact us tab.  You should still be able to use form fill fields even if you aren't able to send out emails.  If after all none of the above fixes the problem, then contact a computer support specialist.

Each user can be a top contributor in a maximum three categories.<br>  You earn it or lose it depending on your recent participation in a certain section.<br>  The more positively you contribute, the more chance there is that you will get a TC badge. Just like featured users or category leaders, it's another way to give credit to community members."<br>  <br>  The TC badge is awarded on the number of questions answered and best answers received by the user in a particular week, in a particular category.<br>  <br>  It is rumoured that you need at least a 10 percent best answers in your chosen category to get a TC badge although the actual percentage and the number of answers is Yahoo's secret. <br>  All you see and read on the subject is speculation, rumour, assumption, imagination, and guesswork.<br>  <br>  A user who is on the leader board may or may not have a TC badge, the criteria is measured on weekly participation in a particular category (number of answers and % of best answers in the category).<br>  <br>  The easiest way to get a TC badge is to concentrate on one category where many questions are asked and hope to get some best answers.<br>  <br>  The Polls and Surveys and Jokes and Riddles categories do not have Top Contributors.<br>  <br>  If you have contributed enough to meet Yahoo's criteria, the orange badge will appear below your avatar on Monday morning.<br>  <br>  It can disappear just as easily on Monday morning, if you don't keep answering questions in your chosen category.|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	To be a top contributor you need to be knowledgeable in up to three category's. the exact formula is kept secret by yahoo but the common theory is that you need a minimum of 10 percent best answers in each particular  category and is said to be reviewed weekly. <br>  <br>  The top contributor badge is not permanent and can be removed at any time.So choose the category's you feel you can get best answer and research every detail you can find with links to add to the answer and do not answer questions you don't think you can get you best answer (it will lower your percentage of best answers).<br>  For more information read this yahoo blog.<br>  <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoRKeB12yOcnUQp.9VCFos?p=19664">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-d8pH0dcoR...</a>|`|0fviV0lNaa	Just answer one category, and be as specific as possible.

BLACK GUY!!! yer im not racist but doesant it sound racist... f*ckin d*ckheads goin on bla bla bla he said black guy or ****** lets arrest him, dude i avoid black people... you know why?... because im a goth and black people are typically into different music (rap r&b) different clothing styles and different humor and i want a friend like me so i avoid black guys cos ive never seen one i would like as a friend and im not gonna assume every black guy i see is an exception... i hate racism, so unless u said something noticeably bad i probably would just rant on for half an hour about how i would kick the offended small minded persons *** on xbox live... check out the resident evil5 hipocrism, resi evil 4 is loved by everyone and often considered the best game and the game is based in spain featuring an american killing el spaniards constantly (the game is awesome) but as soon as they make resi evil 5 in africa with an american white guy killing black africans everyones like omfg lets sue capcom the racist b*stards... the moral is people are dumb and the saying goes theres no reasoning with stupidity... p.s. flowers love and smiles kick *** yaaaaaaay go love!!!|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	I'm assuming it was removed? It does not have to be because it 'offended' anyone. There are a lot of rules on here and things get reported for many reasons. Chatting is the #1 reason; another is 'ranting' -- not really asking a question, but posting something to soapbox your own opinion and get others to agree to it.|`|19JRf8Cxaa	I don't think that sounds offending. You are pretty much just asking people for their opinions, and if people don't feel comfortable sharing that information with you (and others) they don't have to answer the question.

CBgDc1Auaa	well what happens with creatine is that it puts water in in your muscle fibers... so to speak... and that makes them look bulkier...<br>  <br>  I have taken creatine off and on for a long time and never had any side effects. it also gives you energy when you're working out. <br>  <br>  protein shakes are crap, and won't do anything... just make sure you're eating a lil more protein a day... but honestly, you gain more muscle by eating carbs like pasta, breads and potatoes...|`|YUXvCttVaa	You will experience some water retention with the use of creatine. But you should not have any side effects. Protein shakes are a GREAT way to supplement protein. Laugh at the skeptics! Good luck!!

suPD7c3gaa	If you put these files ON Briefcase, don't you have them on your computer someplace.  I know I put things there because I had documents I worked on at home, and used Briefcase so I could work on them on other computers.<br>  <br>  But here's what you can do.  Take however many files you have to remove to be within quota, and save them to a folder created just for that purpose on your computer. Then you can continue to do whatever you wanted to do once you are at an acceptable limit.  But do take a serious look at these files.  Aren't there some you haven't looked at for months?  If so, you probably have no need for some of those files.  Do try to delete some if you've got that much saved in Briefcase.  There are many free file sharing/storage websites available.  So if you save all files to your home computer, you can then put them all on a new site.  That's what I would do.|`|oTP7zhXmaa	Yahoo is closing Yahoo! Briefcase on Tuesday, March 30, 2009. After this date, you will be unable to access Yahoo! Briefcase or your files within the Yahoo! Briefcase account.<br>  <br>  Why? Because, in a Web 2.0 world where Yahoo!

Mail" and underneath it says "Trouble logging in", click "Trouble logging in" and you will have the option to check your mail with original Yahoo! Mail or switch back to original Yahoo! Mail.

AA11610307	Put your addresses in the bcc area.  This means blind carbon copy.|`|AA11059368	If you're sending a message to a bunch of people, use BCC (blind carbon copy) instead of putting everyone in the To or CC box. When you are composing a message, look for a link that says Add BCC above the To box. That will add another box similar to the To box that you can place your addresses into. Putting addresses there sends your email to everyone, but it only shows each recipient's email address when they receive it, instead of showing the entire list of addresses you sent it to.

I assume that you're using Internet Explorer because it seems to be the most used.<br>  <br>  There is not an actual way to change the websites you visit, because that would mean you'd have to hack into each and every website and change the background color, or whatever color you want to change.<br>  <br>  However, you should notice that whenever you click on a link and come back to the page, the link changes color, usually from blue to purple. This is the only way I know of actually doing that besides looking at your history.
