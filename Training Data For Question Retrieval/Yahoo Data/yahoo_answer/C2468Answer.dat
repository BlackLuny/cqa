Because of this, there was hysteria about Communism, and anyone who had a reputation for being sympathetic toward Communism, even years in the past, was in danger of losing their job.

gXB8snqEaa	hi<br>  you might want to ask your teacher about different types of shoes, maybe a different length or hardness of shank would benefit you more.  <br>  until you break your current shoes, experiment with different types of toe pads, gel, gel and cloth, lambswool pad, just lambs wool.  <br>  also, if the pain is on specific points on your toes, you could try this, it sounds a little weird, but get a pack of these foam things called corn pads from the drugstore, they're small oval shapes with a hole in the middle.  if you cut them to size and put them over the hurting spots on your feet, it relieves pressure from that area.  it's a miracle worker, those pads got me through 3 performances when i couldn't so much as walk without them on!  <br>  you might also want to see if your teacher could help you soften or bend your shoes, don't try to do it yourself!!  you don't want to over bend or break them, but it might help your toes a bit.<br>  i hope you find something that works!!|`|HYVKARkyaa	in pointe shoes your second position doesn't have to  be as wide as in demi ponite shoes, this way you can get on to full pointe.|`|I6NwduJPaa	Just to add a bit to the other answers, you can get a variety of pads and gel filled things for your toes.

Second, though, is still one of the hardest positions to get over your box in. (I personally have never had a problem with it but I have several friends who do.) Just work on strengthening your foot and FULLY pointing your foot when you are en pointe. The pain in your big toe might be caused by have a shoe that is too square for your feet. (Are your toes tapered?) If it feels like all the pressure is on your big toe, then this is likely the case. Try taping a piece of foam make-up applicator under your second toe with toe tape if this is indeed the issue. (This is what I had to do when I had my Grishko 2007s until I found the Grishko Ulanova IIs)|`|adwkFYYraa	I have been on pointe for about a year. I had the same problem about straightening my knees too. Just remember to push your arches out, stretch your legs from behind into your hips , and use your seat muscles. <br>       You are probably feeling pain in your toes because you aren't pulling your body out of your shoes, which will cause you pain and will kill you shoes quicker. Just really try to pull up outta your shoes through your abdominal muscles and use your back. You could aso try putting lamb's wool in your toe pads, but pulling up will have a greater affect.

The documents are not so much to avoid disputes (although it can do that), but it confirms that what you do find is correct. <br>  More important.. what you find about grandpa (grandma) CONNECTS to where you look for his parents. Example.. you find grandpa's death cert, that shows not just when he died, but the name(s) of his parents AND the location of his birth. Unless grandpa is very talented (or was adopted), his parents will normally be in that location at that time. Now you would know to look for <insert name> in Los Angeles in 1927.

He has a high-pitched, very soft, effeminate voice and with a slight whistle lisp. He is often seen wearing a light blue robe and slippers and uses a zimmer-frame walker to get around. He becomes fixated on Chris in To Love and Die in Dixie when Chris took up a paper route and developed an unhealthy obsession with him. When the family returned from the South, he left 113 messages asking what had happened to the paper boy. Herbert frequently seems to make inappropriate, sexually-tinged comments to teenage boys. It is revealed later on that he is the eldest member of the Skull and Bones secret society. <br>  <br>  edit OriginsOriginally, he was going to be either a creepy driver of a school bus that Chris was afraid to go near, or as an eccentric ice cream man. <br>  <br>  Herbert has a high voice and speaks with a whistle. According to Seth MacFarlane, Herbert was created when Mike Henry would use his voice to scold the writers when they had trouble coming up with new ideas for episodes. He admitted that it made him laugh every time and decided to adapt him as a character. Mike Henry had also said that the inspiration was a senior citizen that used to greet him at the grocery store. <br>  <br>  Herbert first appeared in two episodes of the third season and was originally intended as a small time gag (as a lot of other previous characters before him), but due to high acclaim from fans, featured more regularly and was greatly expanded on in the fourth season. In The Courtship of Stewie's Father expanded Herbert's back story, revealing that he has a dog, Jesse, who not only looks similar to Herbert but also has mobility issues and has similar utterances. <br>  <br>  In the fourth season episode Petergeist, Herbert saves Chris when an evil tree in the yard grabs him. After the tree initially attacks, Herbert states, "Hey Skinnybritches, that there is my man, why don't you pick on someone your own size?" Duplicating the scene where Gandalf confronts the Balrog from The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring, he then proclaims, "You shall not pass" and slams his walker into the ground, causing the ground under the tree to split sending both the tree and Herbert falling down a long chasm into water, again mimicking the fight between Gandalf and the Balrog at the beginning of the Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers film. It appears that he may have died in this episode, although a scene cut for time (and, according to the DVD commentary, Standards and Practices) had Herbert and the tree climb out of the hole after the Griffin house vanishes and Herbert asks the tree whether he was a giving tree or a receiving tree. The scene was later re-added to the DVD version. Herbert also tried unsuccessfully to hit on Stewie while he was doing Chris' paper route, saying "Oh ho, we've got a fighter" after Stewie verbally shot down his effort, exclaiming, while on his tricycle; "Piss off, you perverted old freak". His last appearance to date was in Play It Again, Brian in which he volunteers to babysit the Griffin children because he's "watched" several children, he makes several attempts to seduce Chris at one point trying to get him to bathe him, Meg does it instead remarking "Rats!", later he reads the story of Peter and the Wolf to Chris and he asks him if he's a

Idk why the specific number is important, though.  The Nazi b*stard killed as many Jews as he could round up, and Anne Frank is a living testimony that they could care less if it was a young female child.  <br>  <br>  However, it is of importance to note that Stalin killed about 60 million of his own people... which is wayyy more people killed than 11 million!<br>  <br>  Also:  Stalin didn't kill an ethnic race that he deemed as a threat; he killed his own people and people who he paranoidly thought of as in his own party!<br>  <br>  Next, Stalin wasn't even elected.  Hitler, at LEAST, was elected.  Stalin took power violently and bloodily, through force, as a member of the Bolsheviks.  Not only that, but once in power, he kicked out and killed all of his opposition.<br>  <br>  Lastly, the people in the USSR under stalin didn't have a right to free speech!  They would hang giant pictures glorifying stalin, so if the spies (KGB) ever went in their house, they could say "I love stalin! dont take me away to the gulags!" The people not only didn't have free speech at all, OR the freedom to leave the country, or freedom of job, or ANYTHING... but they also had to defend not being a traitor constantly! (And it's not like the hollywood 10, where the celebs were blacklisted when they WOULDNT say "im not a communist"; the people who were suspected of being traitors in USSR were dragged away, kicking and screamign and crying "I love stalin!" to the Gulags, to die.<br>  <br>  PS also, Hitler just gassed the people he wanted dead, to get it over with; Stalin worked them to death!

We know we are here because we feel, hear, see, taste, and smell it.  For all we know, reality could contain anything beyond our senses.  To answer your question, reality could be as simple or as complicated as you want.  Our theory on reality is based on our questioning of existence.

Not only did I want a good title for the first novel, but I wanted a connection to my other planned books in the series. That's my suggestion: If you're writing a series find some sort of connection with all the books. For example: All the Harry Potter books are all called harry potter because harry is the main character. The Lord of the Rings is called that because Sauron is the lord of the rings. The twilight series is a little difficult but there still is a connection. Each title always has something to do with the horizon. the horizon in turn is relevant to the emotions of each book.

You said you don't like Twilight, so think of some of the things "Twilighters" would hate the most.  Example:  Make the vampires the bad guys.  Make one of the vampires realize their evil nature with the help of a human.  Try to think of everything opposite of Twilight.<br>  <br>  I have a suspicion that your teacher wants to see if your class will take "vampire" literally or not.  For a really creative plot, have a character be a "symbolic vampire".  There are many novels out there that contain vampirism with no fangs.  A vampire in literature is merely a character that "feeds off other characters".  Create a character who is in controlling relationship.  For example:  a boyfriend who is extremely controlling on his girlfriend to the point where she is deteriorating.  Perhaps have her realize this fact and create a plot in which she tries to escape?<br>  <br>  <br>  Most importantly, just be creative, and don't sweat.  Hating Twilight means your probably have a better shot than your classmates, because yours will be more original.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|AA10771303	Make your vampires evil and soulless--go back to the original idea of vampires a la Bram Stoker.

You get a nice three-way love triangle for plot purposes (evil soulless vampire -- desirable person -- vampire hunter) and you don't have to make any googly-eyed vampires.|`|1DySEaRraa	Since your not into the topic I would suggest doing a spin off of some sort.

So when she calls, you simply stick to generalities and keep your private life to yourself... and time her out at a reasonable amount of time, say, 10 minutes, then make any excuse to get off the phone.  You need to learn these skills. It is all about their control issues and your boundaries. <br>  <br>  Your BF is essentially a replay of the hang-ups you have with your mom. You cannot make your BF happy... he has to decide to be happy on his own. It starts with an attitude of gratitude... he escaped his low-life family, and he has a job and some reasonably nice space to call home, and a nice girlfriend... he ought to be grateful. Ask him why he is unhappy... make him spell it out.<br>  If it is his roomies ragging about you, he needs to grow up and develop his own boundaries... tell them to sod-off. <br>  If he is tired of you, then fine. It is probably him whining about not getting enough sex. You can find a much better BF with more potential rather than wasting any more time on this guy. <br>  You are too young to be making a serious committment right now.

If I had read the first one, I wouldnt have enjoyed it as much.  but the entire series is addictive and you become insatiable for more more more.  the last book was written many years after the fourth and it was painful to wait for it!   :)   A most memorable character 'Ayla' and her life adventures.  Beautifully written and very inspirational and at the same time a realistic historical look into man's early beginnings.|`|QlB3VXWraa	Another vote for "Earth's Children" by Jean Auel. Best prehistoric story ever. "The Clan of the Cave Bear" is the first book. It's meant to be a six book series but number six isn't out yet.<br>  <br>  I'd also recommend "Hawaii" and "Chesapeake" by James Michener. Very good historical fiction. They're not series but they're both very long epics. For example "Hawaii" covers a period from before the the islands were discovered to modern times.

ymh10ZNOaa	The movie musical you seem to be thinking of is the 1952 movie Singin' in the Rain. It has been turned into a stage musical as well, licensed by MTI (Music Theater International).<br>  <br>  The song you referenced is Make 'Em Laugh, sung in the movie by Donald O'Connor. By the way, if he looked orange in the movie to you, that's because he was so bruised from the many takes for Make 'Em Laugh that they needed a really thick coat of makeup so you can't see all his welts and bruises. (That's a second hand, maybe apocryphal tale- I worked with a guy named Ed who was one of the original Marlboro Man models, and he worked with Donald O'Connor, who supposedly told him that the reason he was orange in the movie was the bruises and the thick makeup....)|`|JxUFDutxaa	Singing in the Rain|`|4saIcqO3aa	Singing in the rain|`|JdpTdHe4aa	It's singing in the rain.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqAqTIX2wFK_B9xMFkhuOqXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304152853AA1I9cN">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  answer mine please!|`|qftrNT4gaa	Singin in the rain.
HORACAnlaa	It is the perennial human concern to imagine the world is going to end during their life time. Yk2 was one great example but human history is littered with the remains of people worrying about the end of the world. The religious see the world ending in the rapture while the non-religious imagine the world ending in some type of climate change. The whole 2012 thing is just the latest in a long line of stupid worries that the human race has had about the world ending.|`|zw7B0Zciaa	i think that the world can die any day, so just live life to the fullest which is probably something you've heard a million times.<br>  i think that we should just live life to the fullest, whether or not it's going to end in 2012 or not.<br>  do i believe this date is really it?<br>  no. i don't. i believe that people make scientific errors, like in the atomic bomb, i believe that people make theories to explain things that aren't always right. and i think that by now we would have a lot more scientific evidence if the world was going to end in 4 years. <br>  it wouldn't just be a theory....it'd be really really obvious.<br>  then again, that's just my opnion, a little 13 year old. so who knows....anything is possible.|`|iF5CS457aa	The mayan calender is divided into times of a galactic day…?and right now we are in the "dark before the dawn" and december 12 2012 is the ending of exactly one galactic day.

Insanity: "doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.<br>  Albert Einstein<br>  <br>   "In the great day of the kingdom judgment, many will say to me, `Did we not prophesy in your name and by your name do many wonderful works?' But I will be compelled to say to them, `I never knew you; depart from me you who are false teachers.' But every one who hears this charge and sincerely executes his commission to represent me before men even as I have represented my Father to you, shall find an abundant entrance into my service and into the kingdom of the heavenly Father."<br>  <br>  About 2000 years ago a group of Christians got together to follow the teachings of Jesus and living a communal life of sharing with the intent of being prepared for that day when Jesus would return and begin a new world. Generation sense have developed a similar practice with teaching along with the end times. The Mayans had there own way of dealing with the spiritual Realities and we all know what happened to them. To believe any thing they did seems to me a loosing cause. I prefer to believe the Teachings of Jesus and not the teaching about Jesus.<br>  <br>   Most of the so-called Messianic prophecies of the Old Testament were made to apply to Jesus long after his life had been lived on earth. For centuries the Hebrew prophets had proclaimed the coming of a deliverer, and these promises had been construed by successive generations as referring to a new Jewish ruler who would sit upon the throne of David and, by the reputed miraculous methods|`|Fmd2z3S3aa	If space is infinite, then theoretically everything possible happens somewhere.

Alot. (here i am going to my religion) Well, god has pretty much everything planned out right? and the future can always change. Who knows, maybe the road we are on will lead to destruction of the earth, or maybe we<br>  re on the right road.(if that makes sense) The mayan calender ends. yep. but do u know if they created calender.(probably not) and tell me where on the mayan calender it says: THE EARTH WILL BLOW UP! or HUMAN WILL ALL BE EXECUTED. well, it probably won't say that but plz, tell me where it says that we will die. The mayan calender is like a cycle. personally I don't think the world won't end.(if it did, that would be so sad, my friends b-day is on that day.) I believe that the mayan calender is like one of ours(a little longer though ,lol).<br>  it might just roll over. but then again, I'm just a student in school. so what do i know?!? oh well, hope i answered your question.|`|mXpBRJZoaa	Well, I have done a lot of research about the prophecies of 2012 and for awhile i did believe it because i can be the most gullible person ever. Not long after I realized all of it can be false, that the "world is going to end."<br>  But for the part of me that is still partly believing it, i think the world is really not going to end, earth is not going to explode or anything like that, but what can happen is that "our world" will end. If you read the predictions by the Mayans, Nostradamus, and the Bible (Book of Revelations), they mention events that will affect the people greatly, most likely for the worst. Now you wonder, why would these people predict such things? Simple, I THINK it is all bound to happen due to what WE ALL have done and keep doing to this Earth. For example, war, caring more about bigger and better things like buildings and cars other than saving the air we breath, greed over money, oil, materialistic things, and sins such as killing each other for things i mentioned above. What we do affects the earth in many ways, as many of you know that already.<br>  <br>  Lets say 90% of the world started to truly believe the world is going to end and start searching for places to hide from the floods, volcanoes, massive earthquakes and radiation and try to save their lives, where would they go? Everywhere will be affected from such catastrophic events and in reality, there are not that many "safe" places left in this world. I say that because this world is infected with evil. yeah, that's a pretty pessimistic way of looking at things, but its pretty much true, just watch the news.<br>  <br>  All I am really saying is don't assume this or that is going to happen, just open your eyes and see what is already happening. This world is our home, we have nowhere else to go (Its sad how people are starting to care now after we have officially began to be in global warming, like its always been- you dont really care until something bad has happened to it or a person, in this case- the earth). <br>  <br>  It is only real as you believe it is.

In Manila, the cost of living has forced residents to live in low quality slums and shanty towns<br>  Urbanization occurs naturally from individual and corporate efforts to reduce time and expense in commuting and transportation while improving opportunities for jobs, education, housing, and transportation. Living in cities permits individuals and families to take advantage of the opportunities of proximity, diversity, and marketplace competition.<br>  People move into cities to seek economic opportunities. In rural areas, often on small family farms, it is difficult to improve one's standard of living beyond basic sustenance. Farm living is dependent on unpredictable environmental conditions, and in times of drought, flood or pestilence, survival becomes extremely problematic.<br>  Cities, in contrast, are known to be places where money, services and wealth are centralised. Cities are where fortunes are made and where social mobility is possible. Businesses, which generate jobs and capital, are usually located in urban areas. Whether the source is trade or tourism, it is also through the cities that foreign money flows into a country. It is easy to see why someone living on a farm might wish to take their chance moving to the city and trying to make enough money to send back home to their struggling family.<br>  There are better basic services as well as other specialist services that aren't found in rural areas. There are more job opportunities and a greater variety of jobs. Health is another major factor. People, especially the elderly are often forced to move to cities where there are doctors and hospitals that can cater for their health needs. Other factors include a greater variety of entertainment (restaurants, movie theaters, theme parks, etc) and a better quality of education, namely universities.<br>  These conditions are heightened during times of change from a pre-industrial society to an industrial one. It is at this time that many new commercial enterprises are made possible, thus creating new jobs in cities. It is also a result of industrialisation that farms become more mechanised, putting many labourers out of work.<br>  <br>  Economic effects<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  One of the last houses of the old Russian village of Lukeryino, most of which has been mostly demolished over the last 30 years to make way for 9-storey apartment buildings of the growing city of Kstovo, such as the one in the background<br>  Over the last few years urbanization of rural areas has increased. As agriculture, more traditional local services, and small-scale industry give way to modern industry the urban and related commerce with the city drawing on the resources of an ever-widening area for its own sustenance and goods to be traded or processed into manufactures.<br>  Research in urban ecology finds that larger cities provide more specialized goods and services to the local market and surrounding areas, function as a transportation and wholesale hub for smaller places, and accumulate more capital, financial service provision, and an educated labor force, as well as often concentrating administrative functions for the area in which they lie. This relation among places of different sizes is called the urban hierarchy.<br>  As cities develop, effects can include a dramatic increase in costs, often pricing the local working class out of the market, including such functionaries as employees of the local municipalities. For example, Eric Hobsbawm's book The age of the revolution: 1789–1848 (published 1962 and 2005) chapter 11, stated "Urban development in our period [1789–1848] was a gigantic process of class segregation, which pushed the new labouring poor into great morasses of misery outside the centres of government and business and the newly specialised residential areas of the bourgeoisie. The almost universal European division into a 'good' west end and a 'poor' east end of large cities developed in this period." This is likely due the prevailing south-west wind which carries coal smoke and other airborne pollutants downwind, making the western edges of towns preferable to the eastern ones. Urbanization is often viewed as a negative trend, but in fact, it occurs naturally from individual and corporate efforts to reduce expense in commuting and transportation while improving opportunities for jobs, education, housing, and transportation. Living in cities permits individuals and families to take advantage of the opportunities of proximity, diversity, and marketplace competition.<br>  [edit]Environmental effects<br>  <br>  The urban heat island has become a growing concern. Urban sprawl creates a number of negative environmental and public health outcomes. For more than 100 years, it has been known that two adjacent cities are generally warmer than the surrounding areas. This region of city warmth, known as an urban heat island, can influence the concentration of air pollution. The urban heat island is formed when indu

HORACAnlaa	It depends who & what the evidence is for. If you're looking for evidence to figure out who murdered someone you don't want subjective evidence. However, if you're evaluating evidence to see if your wife, husband, etc., is involved in an affair than the starting point is almost always the subjective feeling something is wrong. This is the type of subjective evidence one should act on but with caution. One shouldn't share subjective evidence with another person, especially with the person being accused, but you should try to confirm or dis-prove the subjective feeling with objective evidence.|`|IGAzs2UEaa	evidence can be subjective.<br>  but further knowledge from that point would be subjective too.|`|U5nwTswfaa	Not subjective, but circumstantial.<br>  <br>  Your personal experience is filtered.

uGmEjSLDaa	I recognized it fairly quickly, but I also appreciated it for its dramatic irony; Chauvelin didn't look like an idiot for not recognizing Blakeney. Jews weren't exactly France and Great Britain's favorite people at that point in time, so it's conceivable that Percy-in-disguise would never even occur to Chauvelin and his men when confronted with an old, pointedly weak (IIRC he gets a beating) Jewish guy as a disguise.<br>  <br>  As a character, I think Percy is clever but is also blind to certain things, as the previous poster mentioned: His lack of a reveal to Marguerite is used for good dramatic purposes, but it's amazing that neither of them have enough faith in the other to piece it together. And, if you've read 'Eldorado' (fourth in the series), he gets himself into a situation that he really should have been smart enough to avoid (arrested by Republican soldiers and held captive until he turns traitor).|`|bogfZ6Xsaa	Believe it or not it took me a bit....except I cheated and watched the original movie...lol....,but it was a great movie!<br>  Hope this helped!|`|yvyewZrWaa	I began to realize it around the same time you did, I think.

fAJpyzuiaa	The emergence of the crusades was initially an important step in the Papacy gaining more power at the end of the 11th century (before that their influence was considerably less) as it was the Popes who could call for a crusade, and had a lot of influence in how they were managed.  For example, the church now had to raise funds for crusades, so they implemented in new taxes and levees.  They also created new religious orders, like the Hospitallers and Templars.  <br>  <br>  But by the 13th century, with the gains made by the initial crusades receding, the crusades were seen as a negative thing, and the Papacy got a lot of criticism for their handling of them, and for proclaiming crusades against their Christian enemies - Popes would launch a 'crusade' against a local lord just outside of Rome because of a land dispute or something like that, not for any reasons of protecting the Catholic faith.
7SCjPftKaa	Fate is a large part of the play as you suggest. There is a discussion of the breaking curse on the House of Labdacus which resulted in Oedipus- 'that night long past which bred a child for us'. <br>  <br>  Sophocles seems to be suggesting in this play that one cannot overcome their fate no matter what. In the Lattimore translation, Jocasta scorns the delphic oracle that Oedipus had received, saying "oh oracles of the gods, where are you now?" after learning that King Polybus was dead and 'listen to this man and when you hear reflect what is the outcome of the holy oracles of the gods', suggesting that they are meaningless. Furthermore, she proclaimed that Phoebus' oracle that had foretold Oedipus' actions to herself and Laius prior to his birth to be 'so clear and false', urging Oedipus to 'give them no heed'.<br>  <br>  Jocasta could not have been proved more wrong as you well know and she suffers accordingly. A clear statement by Sophocles who believed that, when it comes to the gods, 'you will never understand them, though you may search to the ends of the earth'.<br>  <br>  Other themes include sight and blindness. Oedipus is completely blinded to the truth about his incestuous crimes but, once physically blinded, is able to 'see' the truth. Furthermore, Teiresias is a blind seer- he can 'see' the future but he cannot physically see. It is ironic that this blind man is more capable of understanding the truth of the situation than the able-bodied Oedipus.<br>  <br>  Tyranny is a large theme of the play. The democratic Athenian audience would have absolutely abhorred a tyrant and so inclusion of the tyrannical side of Oedipus' nature- how he badly treats Teiresias (particularly bad given his age which would have meant  great status in the archaic period), Creon and even the herdsman ('if you'll not talk to gratify me, you will talk with pain to urge you')- is an instant and deliberate indicator of a bad character by the poet/playwright.<br>  <br>  A less obvious theme would be Oikos and Polis- the only two things that the Greeks had to rely on. The Oikos (associated with females) was the home and family, Polis (the male sphere) regards the city. When Oedipus fulfilled the prophesy unwittingly, it was not only an attack on the Polis by killing a king, it was also an attack on the Oikos given that it was his own father. These two concepts would have been more significant to an ancient audience. Since it is not the normal ways of mankind for a son to kill his own father, this act actually breaks natural law which is particularly severe. These themes are far more prominent in other Greek texts than Oedipus, however- particularly plays such as The Medea by Euripides.

If you did not think anything you would have not written in here.|`|AA10729675	You are thinking all the time, therefore even in the negative, you are!|`|AA12079397	If you don't think then you are not alive. But the dead cannot say this because after death no one lives in any form. A human being is a combination of several spirits. After death if good spirits go to heaven, bad spirits go to hell and a human being becomes nothing.
KLTktDV1aa	The Cirque Du Freak Series here is a summary:<br>  <br>  the books are about a boy, Darren Shan how loves spiders. He has a best friend Steve. The end up going to a freak show and Darren gets involved with the world of vampires. I would say that they are very very suspense full, lots of twists, and some blood. It is teh best books I have ever read and i have read a lot of good books in my 12 years of living.I am very sure that u will like them. Here are the books listed in their order.There are twelve in all. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.scifan.com/series/series.asp?SR_seriesid=2577" rel="nofollow">http://www.scifan.com/series/series.asp?...</a> <br>  <br>  If u scroll over the names, u will see a litle pic of that book. PLz read them!! u wont regret it!!|`|ZxKLOqAlaa	Definitely the Lord of the Rings series. Those are the best fantasy books I've ever read. I don't know if you would like them. It takes depth to read them, they are pretty original. <br>  <br>  It's amazing to me though, to think how J.R.R. Tolkein created this amazing world purely from imagination. I mean, there are literally no holes in his plot. He even created a language (elf) to go along with his books! They are wonderful, and talking about them is making me want to read them right now :)<br>  <br>  Or other fantasy books... I'm not going to recomend Twilight. I mean, it's alright I guess, but its really a light read and pretty corny and its got a lot of plot holes. <br>  <br>  <br>  Read the Princess Bride. I love that book too, and the movie is amazing :D|`|NQbtQwOUaa	A couple of my favorites: Wuthering Heights, Tale of Two Cities, Count of Monte Cristo, The Three Musketeers, if you're not into classics then you can read Master of the Game by Sydney Sheldon.

O9sIjX2Eaa	Song poem by Otteri Selvakumar is undoubtedly the greatest work that his poet has produced. Although previous works were professionally constructed, they are mediocre in comparison to this Magnum Opus. The poet’s previous best work, Cat Singing, although packed with poignant meaning, at seven lines long was verbose. Note how this work centres around the second word ‘kaa’ emphasising the central theme of the work which is the ‘song’ and not merely the ‘crow singing’. The fact that the crow is ‘Boor with crow colour’   leads the reader to the inevitable conclusion that the ‘song’ itself stands at a distance from the ‘crow’ who is actually ‘singing’, but whose input into the ‘singing’ is merely transitory. The verse startlingly ceases with the word ‘colour’, thereby deconstructing the whole essence of the poem by drawing the reader’s thought from the actual verse form to a visual impact of colour. Overall the verse produces  a harmonisation of unity, intimating to the reader that the work overall is quintessentially a load of crap.|`|wLupiz7raa	enough of your kaa kaa ,I want to know your inspiration for such poems|`|wWL934E8aa	look<br>  <br>  see sky<br>  <br>  colour blue<br>  <br>  smiles
JEP4CmyUaa	Eclipse:<br>  <br>  The story begins with the revelation that Seattle is being plagued by a string of unsolved murders, which Edward suspects are being caused by a vampire that is unable to control its thirst. Edward and Bella fill out college applications, while Bella explains to Edward her desire to see Jacob, her werewolf friend, again. Meanwhile, Alice Cullen has a vision that Victoria, a vampire who is hunting Bella for revenge, is back in town. Although Edward fears for her safety, Bella insists that Jacob and the rest of the werewolf pack would never harm her, and he eventually allows her to visit Jacob once in a while. A few days later, Edward proposes to Bella and, despite having an aversion to marriage, she accepts.<br>  <br>  Bella and the Cullens realize that the murders in Seattle are being committed by an "army" of newborn vampires, controlled by Victoria. The Cullen family joins forces with the werewolf pack in order to combat this threat. As everyone else prepares for battle, Edward and Bella camp up in the mountains, hidden during the battle, where they are later joined by Jacob and Seth Clearwater, a young member of the werewolf pack, to wait out the fight.<br>  <br>  In the morning, Jacob overhears Edward and Bella discussing their engagement and becomes very upset. He threatens to join the fight and get himself killed. To stop him, Bella kisses Jacob and realizes that she is in love with him. Victoria tracks Edward's scent to Bella, and Edward is forced to fight. After Victoria and her army are successfully destroyed, Bella explains to Jacob that while she loves him, her love for Edward is greater. After receiving a wedding invitation from a humble Edward, Jacob runs away in his wolf form to escape the pain he feels, angry at Bella's decision to become a vampire.<br>  <br>  Breaking Dawn:<br>  <br>  Breaking Dawn is split into three separate "books", or parts. The first part details Bella's marriage and honeymoon with Edward, which they spend on a private island off the coast of Brazil. Edward grants Bella's wish and makes love to her. Soon after, Bella realizes that she is pregnant. After contacting Carlisle, who confirms her pregnancy, she and Edward plan to return home. Edward, concerned for her well-being as the fetus develops with unnatural rapidity, urges her to get an abortion. However, Bella wants to keep the child and so contacts Rosalie for support, knowing that Rosalie has always wanted children.<br>  <br>  The second part of the novel is written from Jacob's point of view, and lasts throughout Bella's pregnancy and childbirth. The pack of werewolves, not knowing what danger the unborn child may pose, make plans to destroy it, even though they must kill Bella to do so. Jacob vehemently disagrees with this decision and revolts, leaving the pack to form his own with Seth and Leah Clearwater. Bella soon gives birth, but the baby breaks many of her bones and she loses massive amounts of blood. In order to save her life, Edward changes her into a vampire. Jacob, who was present for the birth, immediately "imprints" — an involuntary response in which a werewolf finds his soul mate — on Edward and Bella's newborn daughter, Renesmee.<br>  <br>  The third section of Breaking Dawn shifts back to Bella's perspective, finding her changed into a vampire and enjoying her new life and abilities. However, the vampire Irina misidentifies Renesmee as an "immortal child", a child who has been turned into a vampire. The creation of "immortal children" was previously outlawed by the Volturi. After Irina presents her allegation to the Volturi, they plan to destroy Renesmee and the Cullens. In an attempt to save her, the Cullens gather vampires from around the world to stand as witnesses and prove to the Volturi that Renesmee is not an immortal child. Upon confronting the gathered Cullen allies and witnesses, the Volturi discover that they have been misinformed and immediately execute Irina for her mistake. However, they remain undecided on whether Renesmee should be viewed as a threat to the secret existence of vampires. At that time, Alice and Jasper, who had left prior to the confrontation, return with Nahuel, a 150-year-old vampire-human crossbreed like Renesmee. He demonstrates that the crossbreeds pose no threat, and the Volturi leave. Bella, Edward and Renesmee return to their home in peace.|`|AA11269060	Yeah, but the entertainment is in actually READING the books.

The house has multiple chimneys, infested with birds' nests, and presents a rather uneven face, populated by moss and fungi and the like. The front of the house overlooks the market-place, which isn't considered particularly attractive, and a darkened alley rounds one side of the building. The alley leads to an ugly, ancient door, opening onto the back court. The architecture of the house is described as "Palladian".

Try to learn and memorize the steps they show you so you can draw the pictures on your own. Of course, this depends on what style of art you want. There are a lot of books out there. I have a couple like "how to draw japanese manga," how to draw animals," "how to draw famous cartoon characters," "portraids," etc. But you got to be patient while learning how to draw. Hope this helps.|`|EXOJIrkVaa	Having taken many advanced level college art/drawing classes, I have come to realize that with all the talent in the world, you won't reach your full potential without intensive practice. <br>  <br>  There are limitless artists out there who are pleased to teach art/drawing lessons for a reasonable price. For example, craft stores often hold art classes by professional artists. Pick up a book on basic drawing as well. <br>  <br>  Go to a craft store and pick up a set of drawing pencils and charcoal sticks. Practice drawing anything in a quick, loose manner. Each drawing should not exceed a time of 3 - 5 minutes. Work quickly and from the heart. Over time, you will begin to develop a language of art that is all yourt own. <br>  <br>  Don't be afraid of making mistakes, as mistakes are learning experiences which will help you improve. If you draw enough, regardless of your talent, you will eventually develop something that impresses people. I find this to be one of the most rewarding aspects of art. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind, perhaps for every 100 works of art, you may create that one beautiful piece worth framing and selling. The more art you create, the better your chances are of creating something spectacular. <br>  <br>  Most of all, keep your passion for what you draw by finding subjects to draw that interest you. Surround yourself by artists, visit galleries for inspiration, and look in your local newspaper/ art magazines for non-profit organizations that offer studio time for a minimal fee. <br>  <br>  For example, in Tucson there is a place called The Drawing Studio. Take a look at the web site to see what they're all about, and take a look around your city for a similar organization. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thedrawingstudio.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedrawingstudio.org/</a><br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and if you can, perhaps audit art classes at a local college. <br>  <br>  Best of luck, and remember, your best art comes from the subjects you find passion in. <br>  <br>  In addition, begin your drawings with basic geometric shapes using a light pencil, and refine those shapes gradually to achieve a well proportioned subject. Use your pencil, or a ruler to gauge proper proportions. Another technique I use is to hold the drawing up to a mirror. This will give you a fresh look at the drawing to see where things may appear out of proportion etc...<br>  <br>  Pay attention to light and it's direction, include shadows that match the direction of light.

i5OVORXgaa	Nikon D40 or Canon Rebel XT|`|pZGLhV2Waa	Any of the Pentax DSLR's would be a good choice. The lenses from your Pentax 35mm will all work on the digital SLR's. There is no reason to look at any other brand because you would have to buy all new lenses. If you no longer have your Pentax then you can look at the Canon Rebels or the Nikon D40 or D60 as well. Prices start at $450 and go up to about $600. The Pentax K2000D body only is $502.95 at B&H right now.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=search&A=search&Q=&sb=bs%2Cupper%28ds%29&sq=asc&sortDrop=Brand%3A+A+to+Z&ac=&bsi=&bhs=t&ci=6222&shs=&at=Brand_Pentax&basicSubmit=Submit+Query" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controll...</a>|`|wml6FnfQaa	the nikon d200 body only is pretty cheap now, but is still a great quality camera. it's what i personally shoot with. if you do a little searching online i'm sure you could get the d200 and a used lens for around $1000<br>  edit: the d200 works with manual lenses, which are a little bit cheaper and you would probably like if you're used to a manual camera. all you have to do is set the focal length and maximum aperture.

i5OVORXgaa	You would definately need a camera that would allow you to have full control... I suggest the Canon Rebel XT or Nikon D40... however, you must be willing to learn how to control it, otherwise it would be a waste of money.|`|4Ug9FdFdaa	Its not about the camera you use<br>  Its about what setting its set to<br>  And How you take It|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	Timing is everything. ...well almost, lighting is a big part of it, too.|`|k8AcVixTaa	Its not the camera that makes the photo but the photographer.

AA10408380	Yes. I heard that most realities are fantasies first. Inventors think of things the masses can benefit from before they invent it. See, fantasy becomes reality. Logic doesn't have to be there. If I fantasized about living somewhere, and then I lived there for a while, that's my reality now. But there might not have been any logic behind it, I just went and lived there. But logic could be applied, because reality would tell me, that I would need funding to make my plan go through, so most ppl would get a job in the chosen place, but then, there are some folks with endlesss income, that can make their fantasies realities anytime.|`|jiMAtaCraa	Placing fantasy and logic in the same sentence is an antithesis - both are mutually exclusive. What the older generation fantasized and dreamed of was in essence "a fantasy" because there was no logical foundations to support their ideological premise. It was only through the means of technological advancement (i.e. logic) in the later generations that transformed the once-idea to actuality.|`|3AAJqErnaa	Who needs logic to live in a reality created by fantasy? If you think it, it is real... I don't need anyone telling me that what I believe is not real, because I know that by believing it, it them becomes my reality, and that is very logical to me.|`|xkXCFpCMaa	yeah, you never know whats possible. And fantasy can be real in terms of if the suppositions on which thier based were possbible then the conclusion would be possible. so even if we cant know it could be.|`|FwdBKodSaa	We have three things here: fantasy, unknown reality and known reality. Fantasy means something we imagine but do not know to exist.|`|yW62Xm9caa	hmmm i don't know good question.People say that seeing is believing but if you say saw a dragon which is supposedly fantasy would you believe it? Would you think it was a joke or your eyes playing up or something.Would you tell anyone if you did see it or would you not because people would think your crazy? is there life on other planets? if people proved this would you believe them? if someone told you they saw a dragon or alien or something would you believe them.Seeing isn't necessarily believing.People believe in god but nobody left on earth has actually seen him so for all we know it could be just stories and people got the wrong idea.It could be fantasy but people still believe.Some people say dinosaurs are fantasy but they were alive.Just because it doesn't exist now doesn't mean it didn't or wont.Fantasy could be real out there just undiscovered.Some things cant be explained by science or logic. Hope this helped.|`|gwM3ZXuEaa	That which is thought of as fantasy changes with possibility. So yes, if possibility changes, that which was once fantasy, can now be logical.<br>  <br>  It is not an opinion, it is logic.|`|Xr2GBsMraa	Honey, your thinking of Scientology.|`|KjVKNjwNaa	i really hope all mine become reality!!|`|SsB7aRExaa	Nope.  Your question doesn't even really make sense.  I know it's fashionable in some circles to "question reality", but doing so really only shows profound idiocy, not intellectual sophistication.  Robin Williams' famous line, "Reality!  What a concept!" is an example of this, and of course, the audience laughs and nods knowingly, showing how cool they are that they don't believe there really is such a thing as objective reality.<br>  <br>  Simple-minded hogwash!<br>  <br>  Reality IS, like it or not.

5MHtDIXlaa	Well first, it was not my fault I was clumsy!!<br>  Also he was interested in me because he saw that he couldn't read my mind. Then he reilized he loved me and we are happily married!!!!<br>  IF YOU DON"T LIKE ME KEEP IT TO YOURSELF!!!!!!!<br>  HISSSSSSSSSSSSS|`|3jOiEZtraa	I totally and completely agree with you on the spoiled clumsy brat part. Edward is attracted to her at first because of her smell. She smells so good to him that it is physically painful for him to be around her. Originally, he decides to stay away from her, but then he realizes that she is the only one whose mid he can't read and that intrigues him. He then starts to..well...i can't put this so it sounds sweet like Stephenie Meyer. He stalks her. he hides in th trees outside her house. He also trys to listen to her through her father, but he can only hear the tone of his thoughts. I know.. weird. The main reason why he loves her is becuase of the fact that she is vulnerable and needs saving (clumsy), she knows waht she wants (spoiled),and doesn't take crap form people (bossy). i personally don't understand it, but I think only Stephenie Meyer does. And anyway, she writes so amazingly that no one would ask that question until they finished the book and actuallyl started to question it. But hey..that's love I guess. <br>  By the way, I know what Edard did becuase of Midnight sunadn his partial description in Twilight whe nthey are in the car after the dinner.|`|92Oj0Ilzaa	well I am not what you can call a fan of Twilight but I did read the books....Let's put the cards on the table here.True,Bella isn't the most attractive woman or even the type of girl a guy would fall head over heels for but as far as people calling her bossy lol to her dad she is!She is clumsy and a freaking drama queen but yeah...<br>  <br>  On the other hand though,I don't understand what's the big deal about Edward,let's face it,if you are looking for the controlling boyfriend type,Edward would be your perfect match.He breaks into her room,searches her belongings,wreck her truck so she can't get out of town and on top of that,if she dare ask a question,he tells her not to be difficult...hmmmm......I could bet that if Stephenie was writing another book where Bella breaks up (divorce) Edward he would end up killing her....Could make the whole thing a lil more interesting though.<br>  <br>  Anybody else feels like me??<br>  <br>  oh and to answer your question,he likes her because she is easy to control and she is blinded by love,on top of that Edward's a freaking blood junkie(yeah I guess vampires are like that) and she's his brand of drug....He need to see a psychiatrist.|`|LfaXUWVGaa	lol its call love dear friend. He is attracted to her first because shes the only person that he cant read. lol and that he loves her scent...as in her blood. and edward is so sweet, of course he likes bella..who is kinda weird but overall shes a brave woman =)<br>  BTW theres no real reason to love someone, u just love that person because its her. <br>  lol hope this makes sense. <br>  <3 go team edward!!!!!|`|wUVfgDmZaa	edward fell in love with bella cause he found her vulnerable and mysterious due to the fact he cant read her mind, and he was drawn to her.|`|NQbtQwOUaa	Because he did! Why do people fall in love?Because they do.|`|zy5qcc0Raa	He was first attracted to her because of her smell, and then he loved her because of some those things you mentioned; her clumsiness, and the way she blushed, and the fact that she wasn't perfect, and that she loved him even though he was a vampire. Plus, you can never really explain love, sometimes it just happens. If you read Midnight Sun (Twilight from Edward's point of view) you would understand a lot more about his feelings for her.|`|pIDd2y8Xaa	because she's not self centered. he is endeared to her clumsiness, because it reminds him of how fragile she is, of how she needs him to protect her. she's bossy because he is controlling!|`|054bfce8ce5933a083f96a2cc71caf09aa	I don't like Bella either. She is a brat and poorly devoloped but his only reason is because she smells good. She didn't do anything to get him to like her. That's logic in Twilight, A girl with the personaility of a bean gets a super hot bf.|`|2QTktDQsaa	Because her blood smells good, and he finds her interesting.|`|RrtUV5wcaa	because he wants to eat her.|`|yJdhhzypaa	She smells good. Wait, that's lust, isn't it?|`|8X0nWxBYaa	I was just wondering... just out of curiosity. Could you please give me examples of how she is bossy and spoiled? I would just like to understand your opinion more. <br>  <br>  Thank you.|`|InslW3QMaa	You are right!!

s9WMTbUMaa	Well, After Feudalism came the hundred years war where new army strategies were made. For example, Phalanxes were developed which meant that walking men would form together in square units and have their pikes sticking out and up in the air to create a kind of porcupine effect. Another thing that was developed was the crossbow, for better shooting technique and accuracy. After the hundred years war came the black plague. This decimated 1/3 of European population! Although this was devastating, it preceded to the destruction of Feudalism due to the fact that many lords and serfs had been killed. This gave new incentives for people to try new jobs and positions that they had not been able to try to do before! A little after came the Renaissance which is a revival of the Classical texts and humanism. Throughout this time, trade was revolved around mercantilism policies so Spain happened to be a predominant power at the time because they had a huge influx of Gold from their conquests in Mexico. Artists began to sign their names and new advances in the body and sciences were begun.|`|ZyRC5j7Saa	Pretty cool,lots of opportunity,taverns proliferated as income went up. You would have loved it.

I love to make friends, but I need to make the first move! I never go to talk to someone first.. it seems to me that whenever i do, i always make a fool of myself, and just end up being hated by whoever i've tried to make friends with.

N86vHKxtaa	Wilson's vision of an association of nations that would be able to prevent a future war was partially achieved (see League of Nations) and the US was firmly established as an international power.  It also broke a long-standing tradition of isolationism dating back to Washington's presidency.  All these, however, are goals-- not ideals.<br>  <br>  To talk about ideals, you need to discuss which American ideals you refer to.  Liberty? Democratic, representative government? Equality under the law? Primacy of the constitution and rights of the people? Limited government?<br>  <br>  Personally, I think the US did achieve what it set out to do.  Namely, prevent the triumph of autocratic government over more representative democracies while supporting long-time US allies like France.  The war ended most colonial expansion which also was a benefit to the US.  Conversely, the implosion of Russia and descent into communist oppression proved to be a problem for generations and the failure of the US to restrain French and British demands for reparations form Germany set the stage for both the depression and WW II.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	The largest national project the country had ever undertaken, World War I led to an increasingly large army and more power for the federal government. By the war's end, over 50,000 American soldiers lay dead on Flanders' Fields, with even more felled by disease. World War I marked the end of the old order in Europe. For the United States, it marked the beginning of the American Century. <br>  <br>  From Shmoop/World War I|`|ulY2cmutaa	Yes America proved to be a great super power during this time. Not, only did they end the war by being the first to drop the A-bomb. But, put an end to Hitler and the Japenese. Unlike this crappy war that were currently in (Iraq). WWII brought about jobs and $$$ out of depression
NnDkqau6aa	It is possible to make things be the way you want them to be...only if you change the way you want them to be to fit how things actually are:) We have to compromise to be happy.|`|ecWtpGoAaa	Well yes, you can change things in order to make them they way you want them to be, but along with it comes the will and energy to make it that way. <br>  One famous quote you can refer to is "Love is in the eye of the beholder." In other words, love is what you want love to be.<br>  <br>  If you want to achieve success in both your life and career, obviously you will need to have previous education and knowledge in order to accomplish tasks that may get in your way later on. Remember, an effect has a cause to it, and whatever you get as a result is a result of your cause.|`|XLBwRZjDaa	you are being human. to not conform and always want perfection. that is to be one true self. perfection is felt by the hearts desires don't give up and just keep on trying|`|2nsUmrV5aa	You must find what it is that gives your life meaning, or you will always come home feeling this way, empty.|`|FoIxsunVaa	If you set your mind to create the world in your own image, you can accomplish that, but it ends up looking like a funhouse mirror. Try and accommodate to the world as it is. Be a worker among workers and a person in the world. Then you can be satisfied with your life.|`|bzvS0659aa	Well, part of the issue depends on numerous factors.<br>  First, are the goals attainable? If you try to put a round peg in a square hole a hundred times, no amount of "hard work" will accomplish it. This is the goal itself is not logical. For example, no one, through hard work, will turn their skin pink, grow wings and gills, and swim to bottom of the ocean and then, fly into outer space and hang out on the moon. <br>  Second, do you have the abilities to attain the achievable? We must be aware of our own limits. Most people will not be President (since there have only been 44 in the entire lifetime of the country). We must work with what we have. So, if you are born and grow to be only 5 ft tall, the likelihood of playing in the NBA is low. Not impossible, just unlikely. We must know when are work is not making progress anymore.

sRw9oiQdaa	It's very good.  Kind of sad at the end though.  Hemingway reads quick due to his writing style.  It really captures the era.  I love it.|`|hPKEI9Lyaa	I really didn't enjoy it at all.  Hemingway was depressed all of his life, and it shows through in his writing.  The whole story is very hopeless.  He communicates his views about the world in way that is slightly unsettling.  The book is thoroughly charged with apathy, immorality and death; a mixture that is not pleasant at all (to me, that is).  I didn't think the ending resolved the story very well, even though it was consistent with the tone of the book.<br>  <br>  It makes for interesting discussion, but I wouldn't say it's an enjoyable read.

If it's a dream, it would have no means for me to read the previous book. Finally, we knew that it isn't a dream. But, if my guess is wrong, I would get really mad and never read the book again. The Maximum Ride fans would get angry against James Patterson. Probably, they wouldn't buy Maximum Ride: The Final Warning though the fourth book disappointed many people (not including me).|`|44Jmnip9aa	Oh. my. gosh!!!!!!!! That was i thought too!

It implies that the colonizing country has rights to expand in places around the world, partly to keep up with other colonizers.<br>  <br>  Examples would be Britain with India, the US with the Philippines, and France with Vietnam.|`|dQL4wPqnaa	Colonial imperialism is basically when one country or territory is controlled by another country outside of its borders. A good example of this i swhen  the colonies of the United States were controlled by England. England not only controlled the United States colonies but declared them as their own territory which England had ownership over.<br>  <br>  To simplify it even more, think about two countries.

Many sympathized such as Jefferson which put him at odds with the Federalists such as Hamilton. It is in retrospect today that we can see how bloody the French Revolution was. At the time it did not appear so bloody. This was because communication and transportation were so slow. Even people in England received mixed reports. The bloody part of the revolution was contained to Paris and outlying regions. There were more people killed in the American Revolution. Also you must look at the times. England had hanged their King a century earlier. There were many Americans who were appalled at the reports. Other Americans took pride because they felt the French were encouraged by Americans who revolted against a King.|`|8iAOasaxaa	The French Revolution was the only war the French ever won|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	Several Americans were sympathetic to the King-killing but not the slave-freeing.<br>  <br>  'It's wall enough agin a king to draw resolves and triggers,<br>  But libatty's the kinda thing that don't agree with ......'<br>  <br>  'The Southern Editor's creed'|`|AA10242125	While sympathetic, people like George Washington worried that America would be dragged into foreign wars and would be sucked back into England's control.

There's another one, too, but I'll post that later.<br>  <br>  Harry Forever<br>  50 reasons why Harry Potter is best.<br>  If anyone tells you that Twilight is better than Harry Potter, simply hand him or her this list (this is just for the books).<br>  <br>  ? Harry Potter books are deeper and more meaningful.<br>  ? There is more character development in HP.<br>  ? Characters are more human; they make mistakes and are more realistic…<br>  ? …So they’re easier to relate to. <br>  ? Harry Potter books get more intense, powerful, and thoughtful as the series goes on. Twilight just sort of fizzles out.<br>  ? You say Stephenie Meyer had a dream? Try being a single mom, penniless and living on welfare because your husband ditched you!<br>  ? Twilight is really melodramatic, with very little humor. <br>  ? Harry Potter books are epic.<br>  ? Harry is a hero, willing to die to save not only his friends, but also his enemies.<br>  ? Harry Potter books allow you to become familiar with the characters-to laugh with them, to love them, to cry with them. <br>  ? Edward leaves Bella. If he really cared about her feelings, he wouldn’t have.<br>  ? No man in HP is a danger to his girlfriend!<br>  ? HP is appropriate for all ages to read.<br>  ? Twilight has no seniority compared to HP-it hasn’t passed the test of time.<br>  ? Most Twilight fans are so excited to hear the movie version is coming out, they don’t realize it’s a bad movie. If we HP fans see something we don’t like in the movies, we get mad!<br>  ? Twilight drags after a while.<br>  ? Harry Potter is not gory or sickening (remember when Bella was giving birth?)<br>  ? Harry Potter books will not seem stupid or immature as one grows older, as Twilight does.<br>  ? Harry Potter books use wonderful imagery and vocabulary while staying accessible to young readers.<br>  ? Twilight doesn’t give any life lessons.<br>  ? Bella is so helpless. Get a life, Miss Swan!<br>  ? Edward is so tortured. Get over yourself, Ed!<br>  ? Alice is so strange. Stop being so weird, pixie!<br>  ? Rosalie is so aloof and mean. Suck it up, diva!<br>  ? Carlisle is so controlled. Suck someone’s blood, Doc!<br>  ? Jacob is so nice. Teach Bella a lesson, Jake!<br>  ? Leah is always mean and nasty. What’s her problem?<br>  ? Renesmee? Are you serious? At least the weird names in HP are in context.<br>  ? The whole imprinting-on-a-baby thing is, quite frankly, creepy.<br>  ? In Twilight, it’s either good or bad. With HP, there’s some good in everyone and some bad, too.<br>  ? A lot of people who love HP have been with Harry since the start-ten years ago, before it was really even popular. HP fans will always be devoted to Harry,<br>  ? HP books can be enjoyed by all genders, while boys will be turned off by all the, well, you know, mushy stuff in Twilight.<br>  ? Edward sets unrealistic expectations for young girls. Now they will consider every boy who is not perfect (aka 99.99 percent) inferior.<br>  ? Because of the above, many girls will become old spinsters.<br>  ? Edward is fictional, so it’s bad for girls to fall in love with him. We HP fans are dreamers, too, but we just wish the world of Harry were real. We have accepted the fact that it is fictional, and live in the real world.<br>  ? It’s hard to get attached to any of Twilight’s characters. With HP, there are so many distinct personalities that there’s someone for everyone. <br>  ? Twilight books can get confusing.<br>  ? You can’t dress up like a character from Twilight. All you can do is wear a Twilight shirt. Ha, ha!<br>  ? There’s so much tension between Twilight fans concerning Edward vs. Jacob.<br>  ? Twilight gets very overwhelming if you try to read it for too long. Reading Harry Potter books is like a breath of fresh air.<br>  ? Twilight is really awkward to read with your mom, like renting a really inappropriate movie when you didn’t know it was inappropriate and then you end up being embarrassed.<br>  ? Harry Potter books all contain elements that will appeal to many readers: action, drama, comedy, romance, fantasy, battles-the list goes on and on.<br>  ? There are no distinct props or anything worthy of collecting from Twilight.<br>  ? Twilight came out too fast for fans to be able to anticipate and appreciate the books. As soon as they became popular, the last book came out.<br>  ? It’s sad and terrible that Bella wanted to sever ties with her parents just so she could have Edward.<br>  ? Bella depends on Edward far too much, and gets depressed to the point of suicide when Edward tries to leave. Extreme, much?<br>  ? Likewise, when Edward thinks Bella is dead, he tries to get killed. In what way is that the right thing to do? <br>  ? J.K. Rowling respected the bounds of myths and stories concerning the types of creatures in her books, while Meyer threw tradition to the winds.<br>  ? Bella is not special in any way, so why would Edward love her? It doesn’t follow normal reasoning.<br>  ? The Harry Potter series is the bestselling series of books of all time.|`|5y4uMfIvaa	Maybe people are getting bored|`|H2bFiDNAaa	Yep. I think people are starting to realize Twilight is pure rubbish.<br>  We're getting stronger!!!

P1mf9Zzeaa	Here's a little secret about the acting world.  Everybody, at some point in their life, doesn't get a part.  No matter how good you might be, there are some parts that you just aren't for.  You concern, when auditioning, should never be, what if I don't get the part?  Because if you concentrate on that, you won't concentrate on your acting fully.  You should always be considering things about the audition.  Who is my audience?  What are they looking for?  What part am I really gunning for?  What is this character like?  What happened to this character to prompt this speech/song?  Focus and stay in the moment.  All you can do is focus on what you can control.  Go in and do your best, but after you audition, it's out of your hands.|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	and your question is???|`|oiqNhzz1aa	If you do the best you can at the audition, and you know that your competition has done the best they can at audition, be proud of yourself.  Not many people can perform on a stage in front of an audience.  Not only do you put yourself in the spotlight and set up for a negative response, but you have to deal with rejection on a constant basis.  Whether you win the part or not, show good faith to the others that do and DON'T  for whatever reason run around saying i got it i got it.  This makes the others feel even worse.  Reach out and pat them on the back and say you did good, shake hands, and be supportive of them as they are experiencing the same mixed feelings you are.|`|naEk1QkSaa	well, u wont get the part and if u can take rejection you'll be fine!<br>  <br>  But if u can't there will be a problem between u and ur friends!<br>  <br>  Hope u get a part!

shVgCizBaa	The Allegory of the Cave <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/cave.htm" rel="nofollow">http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/32...</a>  -------------------   Plato's Allegory of the Cave: Analysis and Summary The “Allegory of the Cave” by Plato represents an extended metaphor that is to contrast the way in which we perceive and believe in what is reality. The thesis behind his allegory is the basic tenets that all we perceive are imperfect “reflections” of the ultimate Forms, which subsequently represent truth and reality. In his story, Plato establishes a cave in which prisoners are chained down and forced to look upon the front wall of the cave. When summarizing the “Allegory of the Cave” it’s important to remember the two elements to the story; the fictional metaphor of the prisoners, and the philosophical tenets in which said story is supposed to represent, thus presenting us with the allegory itself.<br>  <br>  The multi-faceted meanings that can be perceived from the “Cave” can be seen in the beginning with the presence of our prisoners whom are chained within the darkness of the aforementioned cave. The prisoners are bound to the floor and unable to turn their heads to see what goes on behind them. To the back of the prisoners, under the protection of the parapet, lie the puppeteers whom are casting the shadows on the wall in which the prisoners are perceiving reality. The passage is actually told not from the perspective of the prisoners, but rather a conversation occurring between Socrates and Glaucon (Plato’s brother). While the allegory itself isn’t the story, but rather the conversational dialogues between Glaucon and Socrates (Plato often spoke his ideas through Socrates in his works), the two are not mutually exclusive and thus will not be treated so.<a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/22696/platos_allegory_of_the_cave_analysis.html?cat=38" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a> -----------------------The Galileo Affair  No episode in the history of the Catholic Church is so misunderstood as the condemnation of Galileo. It is, in Newman's phrase, the one stock argument used to show that science and Catholic dogma are antagonistic. To the popular mind, the Galileo affair is prima facie evidence that the free pursuit of truth became possible only after science “liberated” itself from the theological shackles of the Middle Ages. The case makes for such a neat morality play of enlightened science versus dogmatic obscurantism that historians are seldom tempted to correct the anti-Catholic “spin” that is usually put on it. Even many intelligent Catholics would prefer that the whole sorry affair be swept under a rug.  <br>  JOHN PAUL II AND GALILEO This is not, however, the attitude of Pope John Paul II. In 1979, he expressed the wish that the Pontifical Academy of Sciences conduct an in-depth study of the celebrated case. A commission of scholars was convened, and they presented their report to the Pope on October 31, 1992. Contrary to reports in The New York Times and other conduits of misinformation about the Church, the Holy See was not on this occasion finally throwing in the towel and admitting that the earth revolves around the sun. That particular debate, so far as the Church was concerned, had been closed since at least 1741 when Benedict XIV bid the Holy Office grant an imprimatur to the first edition of the Complete Works of Galileo. While Galileo's eventual condemnation was certainly unjust a close look at the facts puts to rout almost every aspect of the reigning Galileo legend. Until Galileo forced the issue into the realm of theology, the Church had been a willing ombudsman for the new astronomy. It had, for example, encouraged the work of both Copernicus and sheltered Kepler against the persecutions of Calvinists. Despite the fact that there was no clear proof for heliocentrism at the time, Galileo was intent on ramming Copernicus down the throat of Christendom. Eventually Cardinal Robert Bellarmine challenged Galileo to prove his theory or stop pestering the Church. In spite of the warning, Galileo persisted in promoting the theory as fact. Nevertheless, his crusade would not have ended in the offices of the Inquisition had he possessed a modicum of discretion, not to say charity. Galileo used exaggerated caricature, insult, and ridicule to make those still holding to the Ptolemaic system look ridiculous. His run-in with the Church involved a “tragic mutual incomprehension” in which both sides were at fault. It was a conflict that ought never to have occurred, because faith and science, properly understood, can never be at odds. In fact, as Stanley Jaki and others have argued, it was the metaphysical framework of medieval Catholicism which made modern science possible in the first place. - CERC <a href="http://www.astronomynotes.com/history/GalileoAffair.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.astronomynotes.com/history/Ga...</a> --------------------Refuting the Myth of Adam and Eve<br>  by Ras Tyehimba <br>  November 07, 2006  There is a lot of important information that though cannot be reasonably disputed, is not incorporated fully into the mainstream body of information|`|AA11712689	If this is for school, I am not sure what your teacher is thinking about with these three subjects as MYTHS....? Anyway, here ya go;<br>  <br>  Well, the Galileo Affair, was when Galileo Galilei came into conflict with the Catholic Church over his support of Copernican astronomy. which was considered a defining moment in the history of the relationship between religion and science.<br>  <br>  In 1610, Galileo published his Sidereus Nuncius (Starry Messenger), describing the surprising observations that he had made with the new telescope. These and other discoveries exposed major difficulties with the understanding of the heavens that had been held since antiquity, and raised new interest in radical teachings such as the heliocentric theory of Copernicus.<br>  <br>  In reaction, many scholars attacked the theory because it seemingly contradicted several passages of Scripture. Galileo's part in the controversies over theology, astronomy, and philosophy culminated in his trial and sentencing in 1633 on a grave suspicion of heresy.<br>  <br>  Basically he said that the EARTH, therefore MAN, was NOT the center of the Universe....but the sun, kind of knocking humans down a peg or two.<br>  <br>  The Allegory of the Cave,  is an allegory used by the Greek philosopher Plato in his work The Republic to illustrate "our nature in its education and want of education". It is written as a fictional dialogue between Plato's teacher Socrates and Plato's brother Glaucon.<br>  <br>  Plato imagines a group of people who have lived chained in a cave all of their lives, facing a blank wall. The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of the cave entrance, and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows. According to Plato, the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to seeing reality. He then explains how the philosopher is like a prisoner who is freed from the cave and comes to understand that the shadows on the wall are not constitutive of reality at all, as he can perceive the true form of reality rather than the mere shadows seen by the prisoners.<br>  <br>  As for Adam and Eve, Genesis tells the story of Adam and Eve in chapters 1, 2 and 3, with some additional elements in chapters 4 and 5.<br>  I'm not gonna copy Bible verses here, but you can look up those chapters at the site I listed below.<br>  Also with this story, it really depends on WHOSE traditional version you read.<br>  There's a MUCH older Hebrew version that states that Eve was NOT Adam's FIRST wife, Lilith was.

Its really the kind of jobs you get in the field of photography. <br>  <br>  You can start by trying to sell photos of big events in your neighborhood to local newspapers and magazines. Or working in a with a professional in a photography studio<br>  <br>  The jobs you can get with a degree in photography:<br>  Photojournalist<br>  Photography Professor<br>  Director of Photography<br>  Commercial Photographer<br>  Or if you feel confident enough Write a How-to book or an artistic Photography book.<br>  <br>  But if you want to make serious money, Wedding photographers cash it in good.

Most places pay pretty pathetically for stock photos.  I used to do a lot of stock work and made $75-$200 per single use of photos.  Online I recently sold use of two photos through a stock photo agency and made $2.00 (two dollars) Whoopie.  <br>  <br>  Getting started is simple.  Take classes or join a club.  Get a good camera and start learning composition and how to visualize photos.<br>  <br>  In most instances no, no college degree is required but that said many places will only hirer if you have some kind of degree or previosu experience.  many of the best known photographers have had no formal training and still have been able to make it.

lPxVt2XYaa	Stalin had two major policies that helped consolidate his grip on power; the Five Year Plans for industry and the collectivisation of agriculture.<br>  The Five Year Plans:<br>  Stalin said: "...we are fifty to a hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must make good this distance in ten years. Either we do this or they crush us".<br>  The Five Year Plans were an attempt to close this gap. The plans were devised by the state planning board - Gosplan. And they set out the number of things to be made, how much coal to be mined and how many trees to be cut down for timber. It also set out huge infrastructure projects, dams, how many ships to be built, canals and new factories were all built.<br>  The state took ownership of all businesses, all shops, all small enterprises everything, and Gosplan told them what to do.<br>  There was a political reason for the policy - Marx said that the first stage of communism was the workers owning the means of production. As the communist party claimed to represent all workers, then, they were taking the first steps towards communism.<br>  <br>  Collectivisation:<br>  The aims of collectivisation were three-fold; to create a rural working class - peasants were paid wages (lower than urban workers) and the land and machinery was now owned by the collective. Collectivisation as also designed to modernise farming practises to create a surplus to sell abroad for hard currency and to free up manpower as they wee needed in the new factories; and finally it was designed to break the peasants as a political force.<br>  See:<br>  Stalinism & After - Alec Nove<br>  <br>  There is a lot more to Stalin - especially his brutality and his creation of a state of fear.  If you need any more information just ask.

OhLRQqibaa	Slavery: depends on the religion, culture and means for survival.<br>  <br>  The African tribes had little resources to sustain their own people. If they raided another tribe for food, supplies and animals, they would capture those people, and some became mates, others became barter with other tribes or the Muslims that would "pay" for many with guns, food, animals, etc. So, for profit = money = looking to fight to have more to "sell".<br>  <br>  To save their own tribe, it was generations old to have slaves, but when it became for profit, with outsiders, it open the doors for outsiders to even take the "sellers" as a prize and to sell them.<br>  <br>  Slavery for bondage. Like with the Israelites and Egypt. To use people to work without compensation, but only for survival of their own communities is even a problem today. Missionary religions are known to use people of other religions as 2nd class citizens, a minority among them, to do their bidding, in Africa today. It is a problem when this world condones missionaries that target others, to teach that someone is not of your faith is less of a human is what triggered Hitler to use Martin Luther's booklet, "Jews and Their Lies" (check on a English version). Today in the Sudan, Christians and natives are being round up for slaughter, slavery and bondage if they do not convert. The urge to control the population for the oil underneath is hidden behind religious ideology.<br>  <br>  Slavery as chattel. Using people as animals, having no worth as an equal, religiously, socially, or economically, can trigger bondage of a community. Romans were good at this, using people in the salt mines, tanning factories, sex toys (children, boys, girls, adults, no one was spared), without regard to their welfare of their slave, if they died, so what, they went and took another.<br>  <br>  Slavery as "indentured' people originally was seen first in European countries and England as a way to have free labor from apprentices that after a period of time, like 10 years would become a "master" of their training and then would be paid.<br>     This lead to indenturing people to get their estates cultivated by such people without providing training and eliminating any compensation. Read the book "Everyone is a Slave" a good book on the differences among religion and Christianity vs. Judaism. <br>  <br>  Each definition or one work is bound to another. Like "servitude", being so powerful you have total control of a person's destiny, life and even their food. Which covers the other words listed. Servants of the Crown, early in history, worked 24/7 for food and board only. Being a butler or a chamber maid became an art the rich could not live without. Thus, in time, you would find the need for servants overwhelmed the supply, that salaries and even housing was provided for the best. Today, there are schools for butlers and a gentlemen's gentlemen. Nannies can make a good living in many countries that do not want to take the time to raise their own children. <br>      Today, in some rich Muslim households in Kuwait made the news when American girls were lured by the ads of good salaries as a nanny and ended up as indentured "slave" by taking away their passports, limiting their travel outside the home, and even using these young women as sex partners against their will. Read on line, many modern stories of American girls used this way in Japan, Kuwait, France, and other countries. See how today, poor Pakistan children are "brought" and used as camel drivers as young as 6, or as household servants with no chance of freedom. Children from poor countries are sold into slavery for pedophiles, house slaves, houses of prostitution, even as brides.<br>  <br>  In the Hebrew sense--slavery was not unknown, and jail cells were not a norm. Those that were found guilty of robbery (only men could be), when the land was righteous and were still in the First Temple period, if you wronged a family, you served out your "sentence" with the family, to rehabilitate you to see the "light", so to speak. Thus, your treatment was with kindness, same beds, same food, same medicines and even had a day off, the Sabbath.<br>       This was lost in translation among the pagan empires, and other groups that thought it was ok to have slaves. The closest in kindness were the Greeks, but they still used people for horrible jobs, sex, and to be at the front of the line in wars.<br>       When Rome began running out of their own citizens to do battle, they enlisted slaves from all over the empire, promised freedom and land if they won and even promised some of the bootie. Well, this spurred attacks on communities that were within the Empire, just to get their goods and lands. Slaves did not follow the Roman practices of leaving behind your sword when a war ended, but kept it to keep on robbing people and the word "highway" robber became the norm. Land was not only grabbed, but ships, and piracy became a business, like it is today. In Rome, it wasn't how you got the power and money, but that y|`|obpDap72aa	This is not a stupid project, but one of enlightenment.  Begin with the definition of slavery in the Bible,  then slavery during Rome, Asia, and in the Americas, when it is more recognized and condemned.  From there you can continue that slavery still exist today in the form of prostitution, so called legal contracts where individuals have to work for x amount of money.  Slavery is/was wrong, no one can own another human being.  No one race of people is above another, due to the color of their skin, heritage, religion, sex, or social class.  Thats five for you right there.

79HCxPFgaa	"The nightmare began when I woke up."<br>  <br>  That's the opening line for one of my stories, which is sadly unfinished. Use it if you want. It's a pretty flexible line.|`|V1I0oKteaa	You could start off by writing a few years ago and the main character and her friends started mocking and hurting this guy/girl because the person's brother/relative betrayed them, so they decided to take revenge upon him/her.<br>  <br>  Then the main character and her friends move and find out that the person they mocked/hurt died and the person that betrayed them knows secretly.<br>  <br>  And now the person they hurted haunts them and it shows that the guy that betrayed them is pretending to help them but really is helping the person they killed.<br>  <br>  And then it turns out that the person they 'killed' was a close friend/gf/bf of the person that betrayed them. But then he feels guilty and blames himself/herself for his/her death and so tells the shadow to stop.<br>  <br>  Blah blah blah. If I continue this, it's going to be a long page...<br>  <br>  So, I'll let your imagination go to work.<br>  <br>  (:<br>  <br>  But really, it's up to you.

Everything i had just seen and heard was locked in my head and the flashbacks of the killing came back to haunt me every time I blinked. Tears were in my eyes but I could not yet cry them because I was in shock. My eyes scanned the wall and I looked everywhere for the shadow. Then I remembered yet again that the shadow wasn't coming back as a shadow, but as a dark drained body that was once my (whatever relative you want it to be,) but was no more because of the thing. That thing would haunt me for the rest of my life until I was finally safe in a casket. I hoped my family would not mourn me, because death was what I wanted. I just wanted to get the terrible images out of my head. I wished the shadow had taken me, so i would not have to stand this terrible agony that was just in my head. My parents would think I was crazy when I told them, but what would they make of the note that was written on the wall in blood. 'take me, kill me. Let me die!

oJVBrkYcaa	this answer is coming from a guy who is self taught at the guitar. i picked it up about four years ago, and have been loving it ever since. but i wish that i would have taken lessons. i'm pretty sure that i'm doing several things wrong, and i don't really know basic music theory. i do it all from memory and figuring stuff out by ear. i would say to take lessons until you know basic strumming patterns, and have a good idea of music theory, and you can play some basic scales. afterwards, it wouldn't hurt to take a lesson every once in a while, just to make sure you're on the right path. everything i know, i figured it out by myself. and i'm an ok guitar player. <br>  <br>  check it out.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SynRokr7" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/SynRokr7</a>|`|A2TwkmGLaa	well it differs from person to person. i would recommend taking lessons, and until you feel you understand everything alright, then you can self teach yourself. i would just go take lessons, and when you see results you can stop and self teach. or you might find you rather just learn by that particular teacher. good luck and happy playing!|`|tyVMmNsnaa	You can advance with online lessons right now!

aOy01jFEaa	If the world may serve to conspire with my desire's fulfillment. Then it will be a great chance for me to make an oppurtunity to work on with the world's betterment. For as I strongly desire to overcome poverty to promote good health as well as it may become a path to world peace.<br>  <br>  That I will also conspire with the world, so as to achieve its fulfillment.|`|AA11564934	flat out wrong|`|houWY7qvaa	I believe it's the exact opposite.|`|mMnRmYvNaa	I see a way that your locution is true. Here's how: People with plans see opportunities. It's like pieces of a puzzle that suddenly fall into place. It's almost as if the world were conspiring to help you out. Here you are looking for a piece -- shaped just thus and such way -- and suddenly there it is right before you --- WOW!<br>  <br>  People without plans -- never see the perfectly shaped piece. They are not looking for anything in particular -- just sort of drifting along -- feeling like a hapless victim -- because that's what they have created for themselves -- victim-world.<br>  <br>  If you don't know where you're going -- any road will take you there.<br>  <br>  Corrollary: If you have a specific destination in mind, pathways open up for you -- often several -- including some good ones -- that will get you from here to there. Opportunity is a function of the alert mind combined with a set goal.<br>  <br>  So the world does seem to conspire to help the person on a true mission. I allow "conspire" here to be a metaphor. I mean "as if it conspired" to be logically precise and syntactically correct -- which for a philosopher is de rigeur, as I'm sure you know.|`|w2qV8WEmaa	Things you desires the most are usually the things that you couldn't have ;-p|`|EPe2p55Eaa	then they out cast u with full of SHLT life even though they know u no money and work hard to make money for yourself. cos your desire is stolen.|`|XfSJZCEyaa	If you strongly desire something; you live and breathe that one thing every single day.<br>  <br>  Its this consciousness that lets you spot the opportunities that come your way. The more you think of something, the more 'little plans' you make in your head. The more plans you have, the more things appear as potential opportunities. And you, being conscious of it, grab that opportunity. <br>  <br>  So its actually all you.|`|wK9iTaQiaa	I think maybe this could be true...i mean, the world is made of energy, and your like a magnet, if you are feeling postive you attract positive things, if your feeling negative you can attract negative thing. eg. Stub your toe in the morning, be in a mood, then everything goes to ****.<br>  Now, if you want something, so postively, you can get it, because you attract it too you, i was thinking about get a specfic job, i kept saying i would get it..and i did, easily, the first to get it actually. ..then i got sacked cuz i went on a big downer...negative energy. <br>  so yeah, the world works with you to get what you desire, you have to desire it positively though.

sc4BtGxGaa	Any college that would take you without an audition is NOT a place you would want to go!  We have a college nearby that used to do that - and NOBODY from there lasts in a job - many do not even get past the interviews.  When we were in a position to hire for school districts, we would listen to the CDs these idiots would send us - and laugh until we HURT.  You might find some colleges with no audition - STAY AWAY.<br>  <br>  If you think are good enough to major in music, and make a career in music, then you darn well better be good enough to pass an AUDITION.  Start looking on websites for what what is required.  If you have NOT been studying SERIOUSLY and recently with the FINEST serious teacher you can find, then you are NOT going to pass an audition - end of story.  Just today, someone told me about their son, who was NOT taken into a prestigious conservatory (how dare they reject him???), but intends instead to attend a local state school to major in performance.  Well - if you are not good enough to get accepted in a PROGRAM - then you are not going to survive a career.  This kid will end up working at Sears - because he is STUBBORN - and NOT a top talent.  Helllloooo>>>> - weak is weak.  This business is tough - and if you KNOW you do not have what it takes, or are a coward - save yourself some heartache, and go do something else.<br>  <br>  There are a few questions up right now that I will not answer - they are along the lines of "I want to be a fashion designer, and then part-time play in a symphony orchestra and teach lessons - so - will that work out?? "  or " I want to be a professional singer and famous and stuff - and a veterinarian - so - how does that work?  Where do I go to college??"   The life of an EMPLOYED musician takes WORK - and if you are not up to it, then find what you ARE good at.  <br>  <br>  Now - you can always get a BA in music - which is a music appreciation degree. It prepares you for NOTHING in the performance world - it is more academics than music courses.  This is the case in MOST states in the US - there are a few exceptions - I wish the nomenclature was universal, but it has been my understanding that it is NOT.  There will be people who write in you have one - well, what are THEY doing??  Not much serious, I will suppose - except in a few cases as indicated above.  And they will be all over me - but I have the education and the experience to support my opinions.|`|E0Lybd6Vaa	1st person's got it right. I'm a music major and you can't do it without auditioning. they need to know you're vocally or instrumentally proficient or bottom line is you should not be a music major.

cyt7oh97aa	As a wedding photographer, you don't use lighting during weddings.  Most churches don't even allow flash.  You have to work with what you got in the natural lighting and unfortunately churches tend to have really bad lighting.  Learn how to use your camera to make the best of it and consider buying photoshop suite so you can color correct everything on bridge.<br>  As for formals and reception, you'll really just need a flash to put on your camera and that's it.|`|162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	You're just "getting into" photography and you're taking up the offer to shoot a wedding.  Have you ever worked with studio lighting before?  It is true, occasionally professionals use lighting during weddings, usually for group formals, seldom is a venue ever set up with umbrellas for the actual ceremony.  Also shooting with accessory lighting is not a thing a novice can learn in a day or two.  More the norm would be available light and modified or diffused  strobes, sometimes multiples used off camera.  Sometimes assistants hold those, sometimes they are set on tripods or stands.  Off camera flash technique takes a lot of practice, too.  Also there is liability to consider.  What if some kid or elderly person trips on your light stand and gets hurt?  Do you have insurance?<br>  <br>  How long before the wedding?  How skillful and knowledgeable are you already on the basic technical and artistic sides of photography in general?  What do you know about shooting weddings in particular?  What equipment do you already have?  Backups?  etc etc etc  <br>  <br>  I would suggest getting a Gary Fong lightsphere instead.  (I use the clear, cloudy is an option as well)  Learn how to use that for portraits.  I am also using a Stofen sometimes, and a Lightscoop which does a great job controlling vertical shadows without a bracket.  These are less expensive and easier to learn to control than umbrellas, and do the job in 99% of most wedding situations, providing the photographer is competent and has practiced with them.<br>  <br>  A beginner photographer shooting a wedding is not a match made in Heaven to say the least.  That's not to say you wouldn't get a good shot, and you may be lucky and do pretty well, but it is highly unlikely that a beginner will produce much beyond the snapshot level.  Hopefully decent snaps at least, but I have seen and heard some horror stories where nothing was useable at all.   Weddings are one thing you can't do-over at leisure.  There is one chance to get the shot, and if it's missed the moment is gone forever.  So be sure and stress to the B&G that they won't be getting the kind of images they see in the wedding magazines, and urge them to hire an established professional photographer whose work they have seen and liked.  Otherwise, be prepared to take some grief if all isn't as rosey as they thought it would be.  Here is a link for a first time shooter.

But then they realised he was a maniac when it was too late!|`|UDEMDcGuaa	To some extent it probably was ignorance although people must have realized that something (bad) was happening to the Jews and Romany peoples but since anti-semitism was fairly endemic in European culture alot of people were happy to look the other as the jews were eliminated and other  western nations also increased the tragedy by denying Jewish refugees entry (also due essentially to anti-semitism)|`|1M7ACqBmaa	who?<br>  europe?<br>  or german citizens?<br>  <br>  well, there was very little freedom of speech in nazis germany when Hitler got in power. <br>  and plus, kids were brought up to believe nazis crap and therefore, indoctrinated. <br>  people were told to hate jews, and with no opposing view they did, after all the ww1 left many germans hopeless and jews were blamed. <br>  <br>  anyone who didn't agree would be sent to concentration camp one night, so you had no choice but to hush up.<br>  <br>  <br>  as for the rest of the world, they didn't know what was happening, they were suspecting something but didn't know.|`|XSIvL60maa	People didnt let it happen...<br>  Of course it happeneed you idoit at number one,<br>  Is all of the physical evidence mass graves german reports missing people and spoken evidence not good enough for you,.. google it you can even have pictures...|`|Gox4ol8Zaa	First, the nazis tried to keep it secret...and if anyone did speak out (and people did) they would get killed.

A<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/American Revolution|`|shVgCizBaa	The Royal Proclamation of 1763 was issued October 7, 1763, by King George III following Great Britain's acquisition of French territory in North America after the end of the French and Indian War/Seven Years' War. The purpose of the proclamation was to organize Britain's new North American empire and to stabilize relations with Native North Americans through regulation of trade, settlement, and land purchases on the western frontier. The Royal Proclamation ceased to be law in the United States following the American Revolution, but it continues to be of legal importance to First Nations in Canada.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Proclamation_of_1763" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Procl...</a>    ----------------   Sugar Act was passed by Parliament on April 5, 1764,[1] and it arrived in the colonies at a time of economic depression. It was an indirect tax, although the colonists were well informed of its presence. A good part of the reason was that a significant portion of the colonial economy during the Seven Years War was involved with supplying food and supplies to the British Army. Colonials, however, especially those affected directly as merchants and shippers, assumed that the highly visible new tax program was the major culprit. As protests against the Sugar Act developed, it was the economic impact rather than the constitutional issue of taxation without representation, that was the main focus for the Americans <br>  New England especially suffered economic losses from the Sugar Act. The stricter enforcement made smuggling more dangerous and risky, and the profit margin on rum, so the colonists argued, was too small to support any tax. Forced to increase their prices, many Americans, it was feared, would be priced out of the market.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Act" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_Act</a> -------------Quartering Act is the name of at least two acts of the Parliament of Great Britain. The Quartering Acts were used by the British forces in the American colonies to ensure that British troops had adequate housing and provisions. These acts were amendments to the Mutiny Act, which had to be renewed annually by Parliament.[1] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartering_Act" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartering_...</a>  ----------------The southern British army marched to Yorktown, Virginia where they expected to be rescued by a British fleet which would take them back to New York.[65] When that fleet was defeated by a French fleet, however, they became trapped in Yorktown.[66] In October 1781 under a combined siege by the French and Continental armies, the British under the command of General Cornwallis, surrendered. However, Cornwallis was so embarrassed at his defeat that he had to send his second in command to surrender for him.[67]<br>  <br>  News of the defeat effectively ended major offensive operations in America. Support for the conflict had never been strong in Britain, where many sympathised with the rebels, but now it reached a new low.[68]  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution#Yorktown_1781" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Re...</a>            shot heard 'round the world".[The Battles of Lexington and Concord were the first military engagements of the American Revolutionary War.[8] They were fought on April 19, 1775, in Middlesex County, Province of Massachusetts Bay, within the towns of Lexington, Concord, Lincoln, Menotomy (present-day Arlington), and Cambridge, near Boston. The battles marked the outbreak of open armed conflict between the Kingdom of Great Britain and its thirteen colonies in the mainland of British North America.<br>  <br>   Ralph Waldo Emerson, in his Concord Hymn described the first shot fired by the Patriots at the North Bridge as the "shot heard 'round the world".[9]<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_...</a>|`|RdvL6CGmaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkhhWeHlI.KmPMZY1nLOW.vsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227084306AAfrX0f">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

It can take weeks to wait for inspiration which is original but it finally comes to you and you end up loving it.|`|HiJ2xPeWaa	Basically you have to be someone who's easily inspired (?)

YzrYXeAgaa	My first lit class, my teacher (mis)quoted this about why we analyse literature:<br>  <br>  Literature is is like an onion: You peel it off one layer at a time, and sometimes you weep.<br>  <br>  Analysing literature IS very subjective as you suggested, usually there's no "right or wrong" answer about what you think something symbolises. <br>  How a person analyses a piece of work is usually linked to the worldview of the author and the society from which he/she is from. Many symbols used in literature are traditional and are the same in different works, though the writer might put their own "spin" on it. <br>  <br>  Frankly, it just takes some work and practice to get the hand of understanding and analysing literature.|`|GqrRBZ3faa	Personally, I think literature was created to enjoy, not to dissect. If I were Jane Austen and I was in heaven and God was all "Hey! Did ya know no one reads your books, they just like to give it to students to do work on!" I'd be pissed.<br>  <br>  The trick to analyzing is just reading between the lines. Maybe people make it up, but other times it is obvious the author crafted their work to represent other things as well.  Lots of symbols deal with foreshadowing. It hints to something that will happen later in the story. Other symbols and rhetoric devices are there to help with description and to provide a deeper meaning to the text. Figuring out the significance of a 'fire' in a sentence is easier than it seems. Just pick out those objects that are important and ask questions about it. What else does it mean? Why did the author say this instead of something else? What is the purpose of this 'fire? etc. Dig deeper and try to read between the lines. It's hard to tell how to do so, maybe it's something that certain people grasp and others can't. I suck at history and can't remember anything for the life of me, but deciphering text is a peice of cake. It's okay if you can't get it. Just try as hard as you can and the more books they push your way, the better you will get at analysis.|`|17NeW0cvaa	First, is make you think. <br>  If you start thinking about the age in what the narrative develops, how was the moral, the political, social and economical circumstances, why people behave in determined way  or why not. what literature shows you is the people, the environment, the emotions. If you don′t know if something is symbolic or not, try to use your imagination get into the character (s), so can start knowing. read opposite tendencies (realism vs. fantasy, etc.) but enjoy your lectures.

yJXlvFfeaa	Main article: Presidency of Thomas Jefferson<br>  Jefferson repealed many federal taxes, and sought to rely mainly on customs revenue. He pardoned people who had been imprisoned under the Alien and Sedition Acts, passed in John Adams's term, which Jefferson believed to be unconstitutional. He repealed the Judiciary Act 1801 and removed many of Adams's "midnight judges" from office, which led to the Supreme Court deciding the important case of Marbury v. Madison. He began and won the First Barbary War (1801-1805), America's first significant overseas war, and established the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1802.<br>  In 1803, despite his misgivings about the constitutionality of Congress's power to buy land, Jefferson purchased Louisiana from France, doubling the size of the United States. The land thus acquired amounts to 23 percent of the United States today.[23]<br>  In 1807 his former vice president, Aaron Burr, was tried for treason on Jefferson's order, but was acquitted. During the trial Chief Justice John Marshall subpoenaed Jefferson, who invoked executive privilege and claimed that as president he did not need to comply. When Marshall held that the Constitution did not provide the president with any exception to the duty to obey a court order, Jefferson backed down.<br>  Jefferson's reputation was damaged by the Embargo Act of 1807, which was ineffective and was repealed at the end of his second term.|`|0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	Thomas Jefferson wished to be remembered for three achievements in his public life. He had served as governor of Virginia, as U.S. minister to France, as secretary of state under George Washington, as vice-president in the administration of John Adams, and as president of the United States from 1801 to 1809. On his tombstone, however, which he designed and for which he wrote the inscription, there is no mention of these offices. Rather, it reads that Thomas Jefferson was "author of the Declaration of American Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia" and, as he requested, "not a word more." Historians might want to add other accomplishments--for example, his distinction as an architect, naturalist, and linguist--but in the main they would concur with his own assessment.|`|rpRzeGN5aa	Began and won the First Barbary War (101-1805)<br>  Established the US Military Academy at West Point (1802)<br>  Embargo Act (1807)<br>  Sent Lewis and Clark on their famous expedition (1804)

zwpJCdrJaa	I would suggest sitting down with your parents and talking to them about how you feel on dancing. Also i think you should wait until after high school to go to NYC.That way if you don't make it you have something to fall back on. Don't let your dream pass you by. If you have an opportunity to dance where you want to and this is the only time, then go for it. If it can wait and the opportunity will still be there wait.You have to chase your dream and if you don't go for it you could lose your chance. I hope everything works out.|`|vn6A6xK1aa	finish high school. get an education. then, if you still want it and are good enough, then go for it!
EXOJIrkVaa	Put together a portfolio of your best 12 works of art, network yourself in the community and advertise. You may also want to look into a 3 - 6 month certificate course in graphic design at a college to learn the basics of the industry standards. This will also help you get your foot in the door by meetng other aspiring graphic designers, and those who want to hire them. <br>  <br>  A very important aspect of freelance design is to have the proper legal documents which will protect you from being taken advantage of by clients. You may want to search online for these documents, have an attorney write them up, or go to the book store where they have books containing these documents made especially for freelance artists.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!
oHO0XOQVaa	"He was the type of guy that would ask a single question and can get the whole story in one minute."<br>  You started out past tense (was the type) then used the word "can," which is... not... past tense. Please replace it with "would."<br>  <br>  "I shuffle around the cold floor, even though my hands and arms are bound with thick rope…" Sounds like it's trying too hard to be intense. So what if your hands and arms are bound from rope, how does that stop you from shuffling around? Should be easy enough actually.<br>  <br>  "trying not to make to much of a clatter, he might hear me." After the ellipses this is like a new sentence. So, when you write it like this it actually sounds like "He might hear me trying not to make much of a clatter." which I'm pretty sure is not what you're going for. Correct it by saying, "Trying not to make much of a clatter, I'm scared he might hear me." or something similar.<br>  You're using too many ellipses by the way. Not sure what the plural of that word is... ellipseses? Anywaaaay.<br>  <br>  I don't like the halting fashion of these sentences. It's trying waaay to hard to be intense, it'd be better to find another way to be intense rather than forcing the reader to stop and consider each sentence.<br>  <br>  After the begining part it sounds much better though... The forshadowing is nice and the subtle hints are nice too. Seem a little typical, but fine enough. The eagle outside the window was nice enough too. Personally don't like the style but, whatever.|`|5dycdvZoaa	It's alright. Good suspense.

W8F9PboZaa	I did music in years 9 and 10 as an elective and hated it. I hated the pressure of it, that if you had a tiny mistake when you were playing (or singing in your case) you were gone. It's not like any other subject where you can just cross it out. But i guess you're ok with that if you love drama. I therefore didn't do music in year 11 and 12. One of my best friends did. She had an issue with playing infront of the class as well but during the HSC only 5 people did music at my school and by that stage we were all friends with each other because our band goes touring a lot (Europe, America, everywhere in Australia). So she got over it and started doing solo's. She really enjoyed music.<br>  <br>  One of my friends was a singer who did music. She had a singing tutor who she said really helped her confidence. Perhaps you could try that. <br>  <br>  My advice is, if you've got enough units, and there's nothing else you're really passionate about doing, then do it. If someone told me that in year 10 i would have laughed in their face, I hated music so much. If you really do not like it then don't worry about it. Do not let your parents influence you at all. That is a great way to fail your HSC. Do what you're interested in, what you're passionate about. For me I only had 10 units so I through chemistry on because of hte good scaling. FAILED it. I mean i also FAILED maths but what can you do :)|`|DrBYcIg9aa	After a while you'll feel more comfortable with singing. Singing can be a huge part of drama, and you should keep up with it. Singing in front of an audience will only help you with performing as a drama student.<br>  <br>  Music is a great thing to get into. Maybe you should try an instrument?
9v2p7cwdaa	when i need inspiration i sit on my front porch and people watch. it allows me to think of my lead lady and were i want to take her next in her life. i also like to sit at the bar (no not to drink) but also to people watch. this helps when i want to bring in a new character into my story. music is good one, i like to listen to anything that has no words or spanish so i can listen  to music and not the words. i hope this helps... good luck|`|0tKNkAMuaa	take a bubble bath, it helps you think! good luck!|`|UEzTKxwYaa	Music helps sometimes.|`|dpuY0jWiaa	Take a break, go for a walk and open up your mind and heart to what's around you.

It's very good but a little to deep, it sounds like you need a physiologist though. No offense.

IU4uNH97aa	My niece has read it and shes 14 almost 15. I'm not sure if I would suggest it to a 14 year old because i think even for my niece it was to graphic and she should have waited a couple of years to read it.|`|nBNzYDpLaa	I'm sorry, but I haven't read this book personally.<br>  In my grade (Gr9 - 14/15 years old) it's pretty popular. I would suggest reading "Crank" by Ellen Hopkins, it's written.. eh, differently. It's interesting (kind of confusing at first, though. Although not for long). It's not too graphic, either. It's actually kind of an intense book. Again, sorry I couldn't actually help, but you should look into that if you haven't read it.
AA12339318	You can enlarge your image to any size you want, but the problem will be that, with so few pixels, to make it the size you describe, you will be printing at about 50 pixels per inch.  Those will be HUGE pixels.  This will not be a problem if the poster is to be seen from a distance, such as across a classroom, but, from closer up, each square pixel will be clearly visible.<br>  <br>  Still, any major copy shop can do this for you, such as a FedEx/Kinkos.<br>  <br>  I just did the math, so, unless you are willing to let the image stretch and distort a bit, blowing it up to fit won't fit exactly onto that size poster.  (divide the 1000 pixels by 22 and you'll get 45.4545... pixels per inch.  Divide the 1200 pixels by 28 inches and you'll get about 43.57 pixels per inch.)  You will, either have to print to the lower PPI and trim off a bit of the poster paper, or, have the copy shop stretch the pixels to fit the paper.  The distortion is going to be pretty minor and may not be noticable.<br>  <br>  In any case, the resolution of your poster will be pretty low. (as mentioned, 300 PPI is pretty standard)  It WILL become pixelated.<br>  <br>  As far as the part of the question you asked about how big you CAN print the image, then do the math.  If you want to make the image at 300 pixels per inch, then the image will be a little less than three inches by four inches.  Not exactly poster size.<br>  <br>  But keep in mind what I said about you being able to print it any size you want.  It doesn't HAVE to be 300 PPI.  You might decide that 100 PPI or 200 PPI will be acceptably clear enough.  And, you can ALWAYS trim off a "standard" poster sized paper to any size want.|`|uJBnZWtcaa	Your graphic is really small.  What's its resolution? What's its file type?  It has to be 300 dpi for printing.  It would be best if it was a vector and easily resizeable.  I can't imagine any way you're going to be able to do the enlarging yourself, starting with such a small original.  If you must have it 22X28, take it to professional photo printers.<br>  <br>  FYI: I have my large stuff done at a local "reproduction" shop that does blueprints, etc. for architects and contractors.  They do a lot of business with artists.  These smaller, locally-owned places will also take the time to talk with you about what they need you to turn in to them.  Their prices are usually very good, too., They'll print and mount.

Once its on paper you can always mess with it to make it sound more like what you imagined. Also if you are writing and you get bored its totally normal.

Just continue with the story and leave the beginning for later. Start at the middle or a scene that is freshest in your mind.<br>  <br>  As for the awesome idea part, it happens all the time. It sucks but you just keep going.

gvukdlOjaa	The answer to that question is a very long and detailed one, but I'll try and break it down as simple as possible.<br>  <br>  Understand that WW II presented an opportunity for the Soviet Union and the US to become major players in the world stage.  After WW II, The Soviet Union and the US emerged as the strongest and most influential countries in the world.  The US had an edge with the atomic bomb, but the USSR followed soon after.  With Eastern Europe under Soviet control, the USSR wasted no time in creating satellite Soviet states.  To keep out Western influence, the USSR cut-off ties with Western Europe and the US, which had offered to help rebuild those countries with the Marshall Plan.  The end result was the Cold War.<br>  <br>  I don't feel that any side is to "blame".  Like in the movie "Red Dawn" where the shot-down F-15 pilot explaned the start of WW III was a result of the "two biggest kids on the block...sooner or later they're going to tangle", many feel the Cold War was just the result of the two most powerful countries on the planet butting heads.|`|x4LYGAIkaa	Probably the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan. The US was actually supposed to receive Soviet aid in fighting Japan, but you know how the UK and US felt about Russia--they didn't really want them to benefit the USSR from the war. So after they showed off their nuclear power to Russia, it was a sign of don't mess with us. Then Russia soon developed one, and so on.<br>  <br>  Who is most responsilbe, the scientists and governments.|`|shVgCizBaa	what in your opinion spawned the cold war?My opinion is when USSR after WW2 put communist governments in Eastern Europe countries and in North Korea.They tried to expand communism everywhere in the world.----------The Origins of the Cold War are widely regarded to lie most directly within the relations between the Soviet Union and its World War II allies the United States, Britain and France in the years 1945–1947. Those events led to the Cold War that endured for just under half a century.<br>  <br>  Events preceding the Second World War, and even the Russian Revolution of 1917, underlay pre-World War II tensions between the Soviet Union, western European countries and the United States. A series of events during and after World War II exacerbated tensions, including the Soviet-German pact during the first two years of the war leading to subseuquent invasions, the perceived delay of an amphibious invasion of German-occupied western Europe, the western allies' support of the Atlantic Charter, disagreement in wartime conferences over the fate of Eastern Europe, the Soviets' creation of an Eastern Bloc of Soviet Soviet Socialist Republics and Soviet satellite states, western allies scrapping the Morgenthau Plan to support the rebuilding of German industry and the Marshall Plan.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_Cold_War" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_...</a> ---------------------------<br>  Although the US and the Soviet Union were allied against the Axis powers during World War II, the two states disagreed sharply both during and after the conflict on many topics, particularly over the shape of the post-war world. The war had either exhausted or eliminated the pre-war "Great Powers" leaving the US and USSR as clear economic, technological and political superpowers. In this bipolar world, countries were prompted to align themselves with one or the other of the superpower blocs (a Non-Aligned Movement would emerge later, during the 1960s).<br>  <br>  The suppressed rivalry during the war quickly became aggravated first in Europe, then in every region of the world, as the US sought the "containment" and "rollback" of communism and forged myriad alliances to this end, particularly in Western Europe and the Middle East. Meanwhile, the Soviet Union fostered Communist revolutionary movements around the world, particularly in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia.<br>  <br>  The Cold War saw periods of both heightened tension and relative calm. On the one hand, international crises such as the Berlin Blockade (1948–1949), the Korean War (1950–1953), the Berlin Crisis of 1961, the Vietnam War (1959–1975), the Soviet war in Afghanistan (1979–1989), and especially the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, raised fears of a Third World War. The last such crisis moment occurred during NATO exercises in November 1983, but there were also periods of reduced tension as both sides sought détente. Direct military attacks on adversaries were deterred by the potential for mutual assured destruction using deliverable nuclear weapons.<br>  <br>  The Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s and the early 1990s. With the coming to office of US President Ronald Reagan, the US increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressure on the Soviet Union, which was already suffering from severe economic stagnation. In the second half of the 1980s, newly appointed Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the perestroika and glasnost reforms. The Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, leaving the United States as the sole superpower in a unipolar world.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War</a> -------------There is disagreement among historians regarding the starting point of the Cold War. While most historians trace its origins to the period immediately following World War II, others argue that it began towards the end of World War I, although tensions between the Russian Empire and the British Empire and the United States date back to the middle of the 19th century.[7] The ideological clash between communism and capitalism began in 1917 following the October Revolution, when Russia emerged as the world's first communist nation. This outcome rendered Russian–American relations a matter of major long-term concern for leaders in both countries.[7]<br>  <br>  Several events fueled suspicion and distrust between the United States and the Soviet Union: the Bolsheviks' challenge to capitalism[8] (through violent overthrow of "capitalist" regimes to be replaced by communism), Russia's withdrawal from World War I in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany, US intervention in Russia supporting the White Army in the Russian Civil War, and the US refusal to recognize the Soviet Union until 1933.[9] Other events in the interwar period deepened this climate of mutual distrust.[9] The Treaty of Rapallo[10] and the Munich agreement.<br>  ---

glGOW68Xaa	It's really good for a draft. Of course, when you edit, you might wanna spell check. Besides this, you should also consider the flow of your sentences. ^_^ I don't remember what that's called but you get my point. Here's an example:<br>  <br>  Here's what you wrote:<br>  <br>  The elavator beeped and opened with the sliding metallic doors. John Hashing looked up at the red numeric digit above the doors. "1". He looked down at his black leather briefcase. His wife had bought it for him as a christmas present. <br>  <br>  Here's the example I was talking about:<br>  <br>  The elevator beeped and opened with the sliding metallic doors while John Hashing looked up at the red numeric digit above them. "1". He looked down at his black leather briefcase, which is wife had bought for him as a Christmas present.<br>  <br>  (You may also add some flowery but don't overdo it.)<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep on writing!<br>  <br>  -tepishane-

DBvjwPTcaa	Nikon D90 is a good camera. Tere are two things you would want to consider...<br>  As you are reffering to Shutter speeds setting or Shutter priority, it refers to a setting on your camera that allow you to choose a specific shutter speed while the camera adjusts the aperture (lens opening) to ensure correct exposure (bigger opening, more light in). <br>  <br>  This is different from manual mode, where the user must decide both values, aperture priority where the user picks an aperture with the camera selecting the shutter speed to match, or program mode where the camera selects both.<br>  <br>  Shutter priority with longer exposures (low shutter speeds) is chosen to create an impression of motion. For example, a waterfall will appear blurred and fuzzy. If the camera is panned with a moving subject, the background will appear blurred. When photographing sports or high-speed phenomena, shutter priority with short exposures (high shutter speed e.h. 1/2000sec or more) can ensure that the motion is effectively frozen in the resulting image.<br>  <br>  Shutter priority is often abbreviated with Tv (literally, "time value") or S on a camera mode dial.<br>  <br>  Do take note that high shutter speeds works best in bright daylight like at the race track. <br>  <br>  And if you are working with still objects, you will have to balance the shutter speeds, aperature and note your surrounding objects and lighting conditions. If there is a slight breeze, use a slightly higher shutter speed when taking a flower. If the flower is still, I prefer a slower shutter speed. In bright afternoon light a higher shutter speed.<br>  Note: A close-up require you to set the Macro function.<br>  <br>  Get a small note book, Do take many shots at same distance, position from your object at varing shutter speeds, aperatures, time of day and lighting conditions (weather conditions too), record these down. You will also see the difference on a computer when you transfer.<br>  <br>  Lastly, Get an old fashion light meter which will tell you the best shutter and exposure setting when you point it and read the meter around the object or person indoor or outdoor.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|wml6FnfQaa	there is no difference in quality between different shutter speeds, unless you go to low shutter speeds like under 100 because then you get motion blur (unless you use a tripod that is). what affects the quality is the ISO. the lower the ISO number the better the quality. high ISOs create a lot of noise in an image.<br>  so basically there is no one "best" shutter speed for shooting under normal conditions. you should decide based on what you want the picture to look like. for example, if you want shallow depth of field in a bright location you'd want a very high shutter speed so you can use a lower apeture.|`|uXHnwqxjaa	Awkward question.  Shutter will vary depending on your light source and what depth of field you want around your object.  If you're using strobes or flash, you'll dealing with the flash sync of your camera max.  If you're dealing with continuous light, you'll be dealing with the sweet spot aperture of your lens and the depth of field.  <br>  <br>  Since this is still life, you should work from the opposite thought.  What is best aperture for the object you're photographing.<br>  <br>  Since you're doing still life and people it would ALWAYS be a good habit to use a sturdy tripod.  Makes a world of difference.. you shake and posed people shake.|`|HlQCmCG0aa	First, using a tripod properly always makes a difference.<br>  <br>  Second, there is no 'best' shutter speed without  knowing all the perimeters of what you are shooting.|`|8ZhowoPMaa	With stills, I base my shutter speed on the correct lighting exposure after I have determined my ISO and fstop.  I generally tend to stay on lower ISOs like 200 or 100.  And most of the time I prefer smaller fstops because I do a lot of selective focus.  So, after I get my ISO down to where I want it and set my fstop for the right depth of field, I use the camera's meter to set the correct shutter speed to get the correct exposure.|`|GsSRY7quaa	400 is good for general usage. slower for low light levels, faster for moving pictures.|`|fvxz0XAAaa	Depends|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	The best shutter speed depends on many variables, your ISO, your lighting, your lens length and your subject. Hand holding under 1/60 is iffy most of the time. The shutter speed hand held should be the same as the length of the lens (ie: 300mm lens 1/300th of a second) Tripoded, any thing goes.|`|i5OVORXgaa	Usually, 1/125 is pretty good for portraits... but it really depends on the situation.

wxSO48E3aa	Hi, on first impressions your drawing looks familiar to other characters I've seen, so I'm guessing it's not original.  Which isn't a bad thing because it looks like the original which means you have a talent. <br>  <br>   I liked the close up better than the first picture because the line drawn arms looked unfinished compared to the rest of your drawing.  Good expression on the face though for not having much tint, tone, shadow or other detail.  Would work well in todays comics.|`|tUu5N2vcaa	really good considering it is your first time drawing an emo based character|`|wvPwc4PGaa	haha nice. i love the face.

Then do it with 'E' and so on. <br>  <br>  Make sure to use your eyes so they look bright! Eyes are some of the most important parts of facials.

ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	Both interpret. Both are creative and, to be good, require considerable skill/ training/ talent.<br>  I would think an actor might be more bound to a text than an illustrator. <br>  Actors also often work from material which has been performed before (think the classics like Shakespeare or modern 'classics' like Arthur Miller) and can have others' performances as a point of reference or comparison. <br>  An illustrator, on the other hand, is often creating something for the first time, even for a familiar text.<br>  Illustration is something one can do until you 'keel over'. Acting opportunities, depending on where you choose to do it (theater seems to have a longer life than film, unless you're a character actor), can be limited by age and gender (you probably won't see many, if any women playing the title role in Macbeth! It's highly unlikely to find a 50-year-old actor playing Hamlet.)<br>  Sure both are challenging because many may 'try out' but few make it.|`|bE9qW0p4aa	An illustrator illustrates. An actor acts.<br>  If you want to be an illustrator you should illustrate something or discuss something. If you want to be an actor, you act like drama or be famous.|`|EsZyWjGZaa	i guess in some ways they are similar, for the creator/actor must "get into character" to portray its personality well|`|AA12339318	I clearly see your point about the similarities.  In creating a character for an illustration, I have to relate to that character so that the action or pose depicted is believable, even if it is a fantasy or other non human image. <br>  <br>  The character has to convey the moment, occupy the space.  Gravity works the same way for adorable bunnies and for super heroes.  If you have ever seen documentaries about how animators work, you might have seen the artists "acting out" their scenes before putting anything down on paper.  If my character is reacting in "surprise," his face, hands, feet and the rest of his "body" does specific things that show the observer this reaction.<br>  <br>  This is exactly what an actor must also do to make HIS character believable.

NYU37jfGaa	In 'Elizabethan england' Alison Plowden describes a shopping expedition by an Elizabethan lady, Lady Ri-Mellaine:<br>  <br>  'Meanwhile, though, work was going on in countless workshops throughout the city, where tailors, printers, and metalwokrers, brewers, coopers, wevaers and upholsterers, seamstresses, embroiderers and harness-makers plied their trades, most of them in their own homes.  Down on the riverside wharfs, cargoes of wool and grain, hides and salt, silks and spices, barrels of tar and casks of wine were being loaded and unloaded.  <br>  <br>  By mid-morning the crowds were congregating at the Royal Exchange in Cornhill, built by Sir Thomas Gresham as 'a public place for the meeting of merchants' and opened by the Queen in 1571.  The Exchange was another of the sights of London and favourably compared by foreigners with the grest Bourse at Antwerp.  The open quadrangle where the merchants met to do business was surrounded by a cloistered walk with shops and storehouses opening off it, but the best and most exclusive shops were to be found on the upper storye, and here we can follow Lady Ri-Mellaine and her friends as Erondell describes them on their way to 'cheapen' or bargain.<br>  <br>  Attrcted by a pretty girl standing at the door of a draper's shop fluently praising her wares "Mistress, I will show you the fairest linen cloth in London." - they go in, and her ladyship proceeds to haggle expertly over some cambric. The assistant dares not show such a knowledgeable customer anything but the best, and asks 20 shillings an ell (45 inches).  Lady Ri-Mellaine offers 15 shillings and eventually they settle on 16 shillings.  Her ladyship resists all offers of shirts, ruffs, handkerchiefs nightcaps and edged lace.<br>  <br>  She then calls for her coach to take her to Cheapside.  Brightly painted signs - dragons, crowns, roses, mermaids, lions - wing over every shop door, and Lady Ri-Mellaine visits a goldsmith at the sign of the Green Dragon.  Here she examines his selection of pearls and they have ahighly technical conversation about the supposed magical properties or "vertues" of the various precious stones.<br>  <br>  Ordinary town-dwellers did their day-to-day shopping in one of the many open street markets.  London's principle market was held in Cheapside.  Housewives bargained over stalls made from open carts.  Fruit, vegetables, cheese, fish and meat were all on sale. Country dwellers brewed their own beer, but townspeopell bought this staple of daily life from the barrel, or by the barrel. '<br>  <br>  In 'The Tudor Housewife' Alison Sim writes:<br>  <br>  'In spite of the hard work of Tudor housewives it is a mistake to think that all food and drink was home cooked and prepared at this time.  There were always plenty of cookshops in towns where food could be bought ready made.  Food took time to prepare so an unexpected guest could mean that a trip to the shop was the only quick answer.'|`|6wb3fBpzaa	in my highly advanced opinion there were also cobblers-apple, peach mmmm, there wasnt any walgreens if thats what your asking<br>  did you know cobbler is the only profession that is also a food?|`|AA12095483	There were far fewer manufactured products in Tudor times. For example, there would be a shop selling cloth but you would have to buy the cloth and hire a dressmaker to make clothing from it. <br>  There were butchers, blacksmiths, bakers, chandlers or ironmongers (who sold a very limited supply of what might be classed as hardware today). There were cobblers, or shoemakers (shoes then were very basic and either shoe fit either foot - there were no lefts and rights). There were tanners who sold leather and leather goods, saddle makers and people who made swords, armour and all that sort of thing. <br>  What was different about the small shops was that each sold only one kind of product. There were no stores like Walmart or Target that sold a range of products. <br>  Much was home made as well - women would card and spin their own yard, then knit it into sweaters, sox, shawls etc. They made their own soap from fat that came from their kitchens (not a huge priority as washing wasn't very popular) and grew much of their own food or bought it from small farmers.

y8bFwXZEaa	Adam Smith did define the workings of the capitalist system. However, no one is the "father." But there is a cause. When men learned the value of the "division of labor," <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_labor" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of...</a> it was not only the value of getting more done in less time with less effort. <br>  <br>  It was that in the process of getting more done in less time with less effort, they discovered they had capital--literally. If it used to cost a day to tan a hide by yourself, but the division of labor meant that 5 hides (in a small factory) could be done in one day, then the value of the hides increased, not necessarily by 5 times. <br>  <br>  For example, if someone says, "You give me 5 in one day and I'll pay you 10% extra for each one because that is how valuable it is to me to have 5 in one day," then obviously the capital has increased that much more. That is how the stock market works. If I see the value in something that some company is doing, I will buy their stock on the hope that others will see it also and make the price go up.<br>  <br>  So now, another tanner sees the price of someone elses hides have increased by 10%, that means the first tanner has 10% more capital than the 2nd tanner.<br>  <br>  Each has expenses, of course, but even considering that other men would have to be paid to tan hides, the original price would have included their wages. Then to get an extra 10% on top of that is called<br>  "capital gains."<br>  <br>  ADDED:<br>  wow, I have never explained that before!|`|X3q2DMdmaa	"THE WHITE MAN" lol no i dont know if its the father of capitalism but the father of economics is Adam Smith I think he becam famous for this work "  The Wealth of Nations" Hope it helps<br>  <br>  heres his wikipedia page<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith</a>|`|iY7ICn7haa	Adam Smith<br>  <br>  edit: you could find plenty of information on him through wikipedia|`|Om7OhWRUaa	Adam Smith, and the founding document is "The Wealth of Nations".|`|Dt06gcbIaa	Yo momma

DvToP5h7aa	The Giver -- Lois Lowry<br>  <br>  MORE...<br>  ?  As Jonas gets closer and closer to the top of the hill, he realizes that he's completely freezing, exhausted, and going numb. And yet, he feels happy. Joyous even. He's flooded with memories of Fiona, Asher, his family, and The Giver.<br>  <br>  ?  He whispers to Gabe that they're almost to the top. He knows, he says, because he remembers it. This is a memory of his own.<br>  <br>  ?  And then, Jonas finds the sled from his first memory, waiting for him at the top of the hill. He settles on to it, pulls Gabriel close to him, and feels hopeful as he begins to surge down the other side of the hill.<br>  <br>  ?  Jonas struggles to stay conscious as they fly downwards. He knows that Elsewhere is waiting for him at the bottom of the hill.<br>  <br>  ?  Looking ahead, Jonas can see lights and colors. He knows he's going to a place of love.<br>  <br>  ?  Then, Jonas hears music for the first time. He knows they are others waiting for him.<br>  <br>  ?  Jonas thinks for a moment that he hears music coming from behind him, too, back from where he came. "But perhaps it was only an echo."<br>  <br>  Full Chapter Summary<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/event/literature/lois-lowry/the-giver/chapter-twenty-three.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/event/literature/l...</a>|`|zxhppf3Caa	I think Jonas and Gabriel die...I have read this book so many times in my life, and as a young girl I thought that he and Gabriel survived.  Now, in my late 20's I think they froze to death.<br>  <br>  I have never heard of the sequels thought, wonder if they were by Lowry as well?|`|WxAjSjj2aa	I haven't read it in a while so this is going off what i remember.<br>  <br>  He was given a lot of memories by the Giver. And if you remember Rose (i think that was her name), when she died, the town gained some of her memories, causing a commotion.<br>  <br>  So one possible explanation is that he sacrificed his life to bring the memories back to his village. With the memories something was bound to happen. He had many more memories that Rose did so it would have much much more of an effect, something that even that town couldn't keep quiet.<br>  <br>  If you read the messenger (SPOIL ALERT) then you'll meet someone who seems to be Jonas (or maybe it was Gabriel, i forget) and they're a blind 'Seer'. Assuming that when he went through the cold it damaged him enough to lose his sight, and since it's somewhat of a magic based world, he over compensated his sight loss by being able to see new things.|`|YVxy0MJZaa	In my opinion, the Giver was setting up Jonas the whole time, giving him those specific memories because he knew this would happen. the Giver prepared Jonas for what he would see, and Jonas realizes this when he sees the sled. He then goes on to live a life in the normal world|`|WChZRrcBaa	I've read Gathering Blue and I'm under the strong impression that at least Gabriel survives. There is mention of a man with blue eyes being in one of the far off villages, and I believe it to be him. I like the idea of thinking they made it. Other thoughts just make me sad!|`|JA60LLGhaa	either he found the wonderful land of all that good stuff or he died.  im not really sure wat happened.|`|5ejSdj2jaa	Jonas rides off into another community, a better community.<br>  <br>  To find out, you should read the sequels to the Giver: Gathering Blue and then Messenger.<br>  <br>  They're really good.
9DWuZ5gCaa	The Renaissance was more of a reaction to people wanting to learn and better themselves.  People were exploring science, philosophy, geometry, biology, and well pretty much everything.  And while people were learning all these new ideas, Renaissance art still mainly focused on the traditional Christian subject matters because the Catholic church was commissioning the art.  However, the advances made in art during this time were incredible. One point perspective, for example, was developed by an architect/engineer Brunelleschi and allowed for painting to be all the more realistic.|`|eu4QOfE6aa	there was no purpose they wanted to explore new things that they did in the past they were extremley curios
2kKr0tzKaa	I like everything except the part where they see her taking the body out to the car. That part really doesn't sound right. Maybe you could say that they saw her taking a large bad out to the car if you have to have that in there but I would try and think of something else for that. I LOVE the part with the fire and the girl having to live with him ( the 14 year old) and liking him. You should keep that part. I am not the one of spelling and grammar but it's good! Names... I am not sure. Maybe for the boy Kurt, I like that name, and the girl that likes him, lexi, or Alexa, I like those names. Keep working and  I know you will get it you seem like a talented writer!|`|K0SOqyAbaa	i like the idea. it seems like many plots that well suck in your readers. <br>  maybe a intresting topic that well get the reader to pick it up. like the mysterious neighbor. or murder on _______ steet.(the street they live on)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|MQbmazyEaa	that sounds like disturiba.<br>  just start over<br>  not good, if someone already thought of it(:|`|xixgmkGVaa	Try going for a "discrete" scary story. What do i mean? Well, like for example: a man goes off to get the morning paper, when he opens the door, he sees a stuffed doll who looks like him. He doesn't think much of it, so he throws it out on the street. He goes back to his house goes to him kitchen to get coffee, as he's going to sit down, to his horror, he sees the doll on the table! well. good luck. What i'd suggest for you, is this. Lay on your bed, or something you can relax ON. and think. or whta i do. Just get a nightmare, and as soon as you get up, write what happened on it down. I got some freaky nightmares after watching Quarantine. Like one that a guy just got back from work, and turns on his radio to listen to it, and as soon as it gets dark, he hears ritualistic chanting coming from the radio, and soon strange things start occuring in his house. Please don't use the examples i gave you. Just write down your nightmares and make a story or novel out of them.|`|lHFWke4Baa	This sounds like the movie Disturbia with Shia Labuf.

I love books with twists. <br>  2. Personally if i were to find this book at the library and was to look at the summary, i would put it back on the shelf. It's doesn't have an interesting enough plot line. (no offense) When i read your summary i thought it sounded like i know where's it going and that's not interesting. Just from the summary you have an idea of where it's going. You want to make it more interesting to the reader and readers like surprises.<br>  3. No names.<br>  4. ummm.....

31N3gl6Iaa	I read that book. I had to do summer reading for a class & that was one of the books, and it personally was my favorite because the other 2 books I had to read were hell compared to "The Things They Carried'. If you think that's bad, read "The Scarlet Letter" or fricken "Schindler's List" during your Summer! It was killer. I hated those books, except "The Things They Carried". It's just another one of those books you're forced to read in high school...Nuff said.|`|7KfY9Lbfaa	I guess it's not easy as a peacetime female in the 21st century to identify with young male GIs fighting for survival in an alien country of which they know neither the culture nor the language and, even worse, are not quite sure what they are fighting for.

These men in battle have so little control over anything, but the one thing they do control is what they carry with them. These items say something about them, both the items they packed by choice and the ones they were forced to carry.<br>  <br>  Perhaps if it had been vampire soldiers, you'd have a bit more respect for the Vietnam vet who wrote this, and the real men he fought and died with.

Take a not so well organized advertisement and then compare it to a new colorful apple (mac) advertisement. You are gonna be more intrigued by the apple commerical or advertisement then the old plain one. And art is all about making people notice it.

For me, my pets are what I look forward to at the end of the day.  There is also study, the search for God, or spirituality in some form, hobbies, or personal growth.  For every person happiness is dependent upon something different.  I personally believe, that we all go through stages, and at any given stage our primary source of happiness changes.  At times, we may have very few human relationships, but still be fundamentally happy, and at others, a human relationship is the only thing that will make us happy.  We are all ever-changing individuals.

shVgCizBaa	So how fast did the effects of the 1930's Great Depression happen?This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression.So people became gradually poorer from the oct-29 market crash to the depression starting in 1933.It was  a gradual collection of bad things.-----------<br>  ------------------                       The deflation spiral<br>   <br>  US Farm Prices, (1928-35).The Great Depression was triggered by a sudden, total collapse in the stock market. The stock market turned upward in early 1930, returning to early 1929 levels by April, though still almost 30 percent below the peak of September 1929.[10] Together, government and business actually spent more in the first half of 1930 than in the corresponding period of the previous year. But consumers, many of whom had suffered severe losses in the stock market the previous year, cut back their expenditures by ten percent, and a severe drought ravaged the agricultural heartland of the USA beginning in the summer of 1930.<br>  <br>  In early 1930, credit was ample and available at low rates, but people were reluctant to add new debt by borrowing.[citation needed] By May 1930, auto sales had declined to below the levels of 1928. Prices in general began to decline, but wages held steady in 1930, then began to drop in 1931. Conditions were worse in farming areas, where commodity prices plunged, and in mining and logging areas, where unemployment was high and there were few other jobs. The decline in the US economy was the factor that pulled down most other countries at first, then internal weaknesses or strengths in each country made conditions worse or better. Frantic attempts to shore up the economies of individual nations through protectionist policies, such as the 1930 U.S. Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and retaliatory tariffs in other countries, exacerbated the collapse in global trade. By late in 1930, a steady decline set in which reached bottom by March 1933.During the Crash of 1929 preceding the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%.[citation needed] Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $9 for every $1 an investor had deposited.[citation needed] When the market fell, brokers called in these loans, which could not be paid back. Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse, triggering multiple bank runs. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets.[13] Outstanding debts became heavier, because prices and incomes fell by 20–50% but the debts remained at the same dollar amount. After the panic of 1929, and during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 US banks failed. (In all, 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s). By April 1933, around $7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the March Bank Holiday.[14]<br>  <br>  Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans which the borrowers did not have time or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending.[13] Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated.<br>  <br>  The liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices which it caused. The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed, relative to the value of declining asset holdings. The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it. Paradoxically, the more the debtors paid, the more they owed.[12] This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#The_deflation_spiral" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depre...</a>|`|fzU2hP4yaa	It happened in spurts, just like we're seeing today.  The stock market crashed in October, 1929, but it rallied and looked a lot like it would recover completely.  The a few major banks went bust several months later, followed by growing layoffs over a few more months.  It took about two years for the whole thing to get really bad.<br>  <br>  Also, just like today, people couldn't see into the future, so they didn't know what was coming.  There was a lot of continuous talk about how this was as bad as it was going to get, things will start improving now.  Things didn't, of course.<br>  <br>  Sound familiar?|`|AA12097624	Many lost all their savings after the initial crash of 1929. Many of those people were also then in debt. So for many it happened very fast and that spread to the rest of the nation. It was not seen as a depression until number of years later. They went through the cycles hoping for recovery much like what we are experiencing today.|`|5VQrGtIIaa	Very Fast

It's not light reading, it's extremely in depth and colourful in both words and descriptions. <br>  <br>  What I mean is that he describes prostitutes as "little birds."

f4Nn0W1xaa	Spray paint works best on metal but you could probably do acrylic too. Either way you should definitely do a few coats of a clear sealer. Paint wears off of metal pretty easily if it's getting carried around. <br>  By the way, it's always best to do a few thin coats of any paint, but especially spray paint. It'll look better and last longer. Good luck!|`|k0ESJ6vIaa	The first answer is correct, but might I add that make sure the room in which you paint, or if you paint outside do so during warm temperature, in the cold paint will run and the finished job will be awful.

Ys47rcdkaa	What is this "story"? You need to distinguish between a 'story' and an 'idea'.<br>  Whatever it is that you have, make sure it's written before you do anything. First however, you must decide WHAT this is supposed to be. A short story, a novel or a screenplay?<br>  I'm really not sure how gaming companies go about story ideas, but you'll still need some written work, and most likely, a query letter.

21gJZ9i3aa	Expect commitment, muscle that hasn't been there before, and soreness in places you forgot were even on your body. But it's totally worth it. You make life-long friends, who become like your family, have a lot of fun, and you get to feel beautiful and entertain people. You'll get the hang of it probably after a year or two.

M1vvXIdvaa	Wow, you have a lot of potential. For being 13 you are quite good. You are better than some of the people I go to art school with ha ha ha, and they are all at least 20 years old. Keep practicing and NEVER give up. Educate yourself because an important part of being an artist is to know your history. <br>  <br>  My tips for you:<br>  Draw what you see, not what you think you see. If a persons eye is squinty and small, draw it that way. <br>  <br>  Explore different mediums, you might discover something you love.<br>  <br>  Make an ever expanding list of favorite artists and reference their work in yours, until you are able to develop your own style. <br>  Some of my favorite artists are Rene Magritte, Lawren Harris, Otto Dix, and Egon Schiele. <br>  <br>  Get yourself and your best art out into the world. Amazing artists will go unnoticed unless they advertise themselves.<br>  <br>  If you keep it up, you will definitely have a career in the art world.|`|jtPZfZU9aa	wow well for 13 i think u have potential i think ur a very great artist! just keep working on it a little more to make it a little it more realistic! and then u got it:D now thts my opionion:D|`|tUu5N2vcaa	yeah love your work<br>  if you love it then pursue your dream|`|EXOJIrkVaa	Coming from an experienced artist I would say yes, you have potential. Your most important thing to do is keep up the practice and have your art critiqued by other artists. <br>  <br>  From my viewpoint, if you add more diverse contrast to your pencil drawings, you will achieve a better depth and captivating drawing. Pick up some professional drawing pencils at your local art shop. These pencils vary from light, to dark values. They will be labeled as 2H, 2B, HB, and EBONY. 2H is the lightest shade, progressing to EBONY which is essentially a jet-black pencil. These pencils will allow you to include the full range of shades necessary to create a drawing that is dynamic and full of depth. Pay attention to the direction of light and the shadows that the light casts on your subject. Create highlights by utilizing a kneaded eraser and an artgum eraser. Purchase blending tortillons to help achieve smooth value changes where needed. Quality art paper is also very important to the outcome of a quality drawing. These supplies are rather inexpensive, so you should be able to make quite a few drawings on a limited budget.<br>  <br>  Keep up the good work, be determined, and don't be afraid of mistakes; they are learning experiences. <br>  <br>  Further educate yourself by emulating different styles that other artists use to diversify your personal 'language' of art. <br>  <br>  Begin to develop a comprehensive art portfolio of your best work to show art schools for admission.<br>  <br>  Look for artist groups where you can gain studio time. In Tucson, we have a non-profit artists group called the Drawing Studio. There are bound to be similar groups in your city, it's just a matter of asking around to find such a place. <br>  <br>  I'm posting a link to the drawing studio to give you an idea of what this group is all about. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thedrawingstudio.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedrawingstudio.org/</a><br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck in your artistic ventures, and remember to experiment and have fun with what you do. The boundries are limitless.

isnHOG0Waa	Wow. Its called know the part before you get the part. <br>  <br>  1. Know your script. Read, re-read and then read again, and not just your own lines. From this foundation you can go on to identify the reason for your lines, this will help you react with the right lines and make remembering easier. <br>  <br>  2. Listen actively, you should give the impression that what your character is hearing is purely of that moment. Resist the temptation to be quick with your lines, just to prove you know them, it is a conversation after all. <br>  <br>  3.Be brave, the quickest way to improve your acting is to realize that your first choice will usually be the easiest for you to do - not the best one for the part. Look beyond your initial choice. <br>  <br>  4. Learn to breath, practice 20 minutes a day. Inhale as deeply as possible and exhale for twice the amount of time you spent inhaling (i.e. inhale 15 seconds exhale 30 seconds). This will help pre-audition stress and stage fright. <br>  <br>  5. Be professional, turning up on time, or early, will give you all the warm up time and, more importantly, the space you need. <br>  This one might not be so obvious, avoid bad mouthing your fellow actors. This is not only good advice because eventually they will find out what you've been saying, but also the actors who are quick to insult other actors are the ones who blame others for their own shortcomings. If you always blame others, you will miss out on the opportunity to accurately evaluate your own performances. <br>  <br>  6. If everyone around you is loosing their heads - keep yours. If you find yourself in a situation where every piece of furniture is being chewed by your fellow cast members, hold your nerve and avoid the melodrama. Your performance will stand out like the calm at the eye of the storm. <br>  <br>  7. Act! The more you act the better you should get. Practice makes perfect after all. The more acting you do, the greater the number of actors and directors you will work with. This will help improve your acting by enabling you to find the truest way for you to develop. <br>  Improve your acting by making your colleagues look as good as possible. It might sound odd but getting the best from colleagues will reflect on your own performance and help you develop. It will also improve your professional reputation which, in turn, should mean you get more work. <br>  <br>  8. Finally, be thick skinned. You have to have the courage to stick to your guns when you think your right, even if you consider the criticism harsh, or are getting lots of rejections. Be honest with your self and be brave, most actors get rejected for most jobs most of the time!

Ojbc8rc6aa	Black is good.  The dress sounds very appropriate- professional, simple, stylish, modest (make sure it's modest- boobs are distracting!)  <br>  <br>  The flats are a good consideration, for the same reasons as the dress.<br>  <br>  The only other thing I would say is to tie up your hair if it's long, and even if it's not, make sure you pin it back or something so you don't have to flip it out of your face every two seconds.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and don't be nervous.  Remember that these people are probably watching lots of auditions, and I guarantee there has been someone worse than you, no matter how badly you mess up.  Just have confidence in yourself and that you're doing this because you couldn't possibly do anything else with your life.

3jOiEZtraa	SPOILER ALERT!!!!!<br>  In Breaking Dawn, yes Bella does get pregnant. She has a daughter that is half vampire, half human. Bella almost dies in the process of having the baby, so Jacob has to give her CPR to save her life. This doesn't work, so Edward has to inject his venom into her heart, resulting in her becoming a vampire (finally!!). Their daughter is named Renesmee Carlie Cullen. Renesmee is a combo of Renee (Bella's mother) and Esme (Edward's mother). Carlie is a combo of Charlie (Bella's father) nad Carlisle (Edward's father). Because she is half human and half vampire, she grows at an alarming rate (and yes, she prefers blood over food). I won't go into the details, but Renesmee is mistaken for an immortal child (which are illegal) and the Volturi feels the need to intercede. Bella, Edward, Jacob and the rest of the Cullens have to prove to th Volturi that Renesmee is not adn immortal child.|`|9HCypvHJaa	Yeah.|`|ukRpBJ6Daa	yes<br>  <br>  shittest book ever|`|DDTiZRvzaa	YES!!!

Renesmee's middle name comes from a combination of Charlie (Bella's father) and Carlisle (Edward's 'father')<br>  <br>  Bella had hoped that it was a boy so she could name him Edward Jacob (E.J) But she is happy with Renesmee!

nQ3kFPMVaa	Cirque du Soleil regularly advertise for casual front of house jobs every time they tour in the country. You can find these jobs advertised on their site, sometimes in the newspapers, or on sites like www.artshub.com.au or www.alia.com.au. They don't generally take just anyone, but people who already have experience (professional) in theatre and backstage jobs. Also, they may hire through local production companies, like Showtech, for which you would also need experience.<br>  <br>  Acting agents have nothing to do with it: actors use agents, stage crew don't.<br>  <br>  Also, if the show is already playing, I doubt you can get a job with them for the current season. They will have already booked in all of their crew and usually advertise way ahead of opening night for crew; you'll just have to wait for the next season.
1Y21zyokaa	True.<br>  <br>  Baier is saying that we can sometimes lie for good reason like when the killer comes to the door and asks if Tom is home. Even if he is, we should lie in that instance.<br>  <br>  This ties into Anscombe's criticism that Kant has not set out the parameters of how we define the action we're undertaking. I could say <br>  (in the above example) 'I'm lying' and be done with it. Or, I could say 'I'm lying to save a life' or 'I'm lying to fool a murderer' or any number of other ways.<br>  <br>  Anscombe points out that because Kant never says what level of detail I have to go into to describe my action his idea of universalizing actions is sort of meaningless.<br>  <br>  Final example; if I can use any level of detail then I can walk into a room and shoot an innocent person and then describe the action as 'walking into this room at 3:30 on Tuesday the 3rd of June and shooting Jon Jonson while he's at the desk'. I can then be fine with universalizing that statement because it's never going to happen again so sure, let's all act as though that's the right thing to do.

gOYWfyFOaa	Acid Flower is very good in my opinion... For the most part its just sex scenes but as a plus I love the main characters and their stories. No Money (Okane ga Nai) is also good, but it does have a bit of a softer side to it as well. <br>  <br>  Acid Flower is a romance between a student and the priest at his school... The priest has a super ****** up personality that is hard not to love.<br>  <br>  No Money is about a boy, Ayase, who ends up being sold in an auction as a sex slave because of his cousin's debts. He is bought by a man who he believes is his saviour but the guy (forgot how its spelled) ends up being pretty awful even though he does have deep feelings for Ayase.

exxHakadaa	I have a district contest tomorrow, too. It's in Skiatook, Oklahoma. Anyway, you need to do everything you can to get "brownie points". Act like you know what your doing and show manners. Play all of your dynamics, accents and all try your best to stay exactly on beat. Play all of your short notes short and long notes long. Use a lot of change in your dynamics. Try not to be nervous. Act like your with your director playing in the band room. Mainly, just concentrate on the solo and have fun. Good Luck!
2TLXfQKDaa	You can get a blurry background even at an Fstop of F11.  Unless you understand how depth of field works, using a 1.8 lens could still get you a background that is completely in focus.  Anyone that says otherwise needs to be slapped.  Depth of field has a bunch of factors you need to be mindful of.  One for instance, if your subject is standing about 1 foot away from a fence, and you're say 10 feet back from the subject, even at an aperture of 1.4 you'd still get a fence pretty much in focus. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tutorial9.net/photography/depth-of-field-in-photography/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tutorial9.net/photography/dep...</a><br>  <br>  Check out that link, it's one of the thousands out there that explain DOF in layman's terms.|`|i5OVORXgaa	It's because your lens doesn't allow you to... you'll need to get another lens.<br>  <br>  A lot of people like to use the Canon EF 50mm F/1.8 II... this lens is pretty cheap and will allow you to open the aperture as wide as F/1.8.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-Camera-Lens/dp/B00007E7JU/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1236389921&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-Cam...</a>|`|wml6FnfQaa	different lenses have different maximum apertures. if you can't get it lower than 4 then that is the lowest fstop (max aperture) on that lens. lenses with the same focal lengths can have different maximum apetures, if you like shooting with shallow depth of field you should buy a 2, 1.8 or 1.4.keep in mind, the larger the maximum aperture the more expensive a lens is.|`|uXHnwqxjaa	The aperture depends on the lens you purchased.    With the zooms you listed, they probably only up open to 4.0 or 5.6  depending on the zoom setting.  You can get a zoom that will go down to 1.8, but it will cost at LEAST a few mortgage payments.   <br>  <br>  Every photographer should have some basic prime (non zoom) lenses. Get a wide angle 24mm, and a 50mm  lens.  They are not that expensive,  and they will go down to 2.8 and 1.8 respectively.|`|0Dj8pOgoaa	Its not about a camera its about LENS... if you have lens with aperture f/4.0 than you can't go lower than that :)) to use aperture f/2.8 you need to have Lens with this aperture... let's say: you have 70-200mm f/2.8 thats mean that you can use f/2.8 on 70mm focal length and 100 and 120 etc... all the way to the 200mm.... but if you have lens 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 this is mean that with focal legth 18mm the lowest aperture value you can use is f/3.5 but when  you zoom your picture and use 55mm aperture than your lowest aperture value will be f/5.6,,,, you wanna have nice bokeh (thats the name of nice blurry background) you can buy great lens 50mm f/1.8 (than you will have lowest aperture value f/1.8 and no zoom)... this lens is great for portrait when you using with XTI and other not FF cameras... this lens should cost no more than $80 brand new... you should read something abou Deep of Field (DOF) this is how you creating your blurry background and your primary object in focus.... you need to read about lenses and photography... cuz without that you don;t need dSLR camera....

A cell phone in my left pocket. I was walking very slowly to the store...not caring anything else. I was thinking of how slow my life was. All of a sudden, a loud lightning hit off along with a gun shot came hit my purse. I panicked as I turned. A man who was wearing dark black clothes with black mask on him so I couldn't idenify him. I was trying to move my legs; however, I was frozen! What was going to happen to me now? He held the gun in front of my heart and I didn't want to die now. I was trying to find a way to escape from early death. My purse! I immediately grabbed my purse's strap, took it off of me, and hit the gun off the man's hand. I kept on hitting him with my purse until he has fallen onto the sidewalk. I knew it was safe to run and I ran with the speed of my life! I screamed out for help! No one was able to hear me!

KBBonf97aa	The best thing you could do is go to a guitar store and test drive a bunch of different guitars, since each one will have its own feel.  If you're just getting started, you'll probably want a guitar with a thin neck and low action (the distance between the strings and the fretboard), which will make it easier to move around between notes and chords comfortably.<br>  <br>  Ibanez makes great guitars that have thin necks and low action, are built like rocks, sound great, and are often nicer than instruments costing twice as much.  Squier by Fender guitars are also great players.  Epiphone makes very nice guitars, as well, though the necks are a little fatter, which can make them challenging for beginners to play.  But if you've got long fingers, that might not be an issue.<br>  <br>  A lot of guitar companies offer starter packs that contain everything you'll need to get started.  Those usually come with the guitar, a little amplifier, a tuner, picks and a strap.  Some also contain books or DVDs with guitar lessons.  The amps are small and really only good for practicing, but you can always upgrade to a larger amp when you're ready to play with other people.<br>  <br>  If you want to do some research before going to a store, Musician's Friend is a great resource.  You can search by brand name, price or customer rating.  Customers also post reviews of products so you can see which guitars play great and which ones have "issues."  Here's are links to the guitars and the starter packs:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/electric-guitars/solid-body" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/elect...</a><br>  <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/navigation/electric-guitar-value-packages?N=100001+306243" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/navig...</a><br>  <br>  Since the economy is bad, a lot of musicians are parting with equipment to pay rent, so you might be able to find a good deal on a guitar you like at a pawn shop or craigslist.com.  But it's definitely worth making a trip to a guitar store to see which guitars feel natural in your hands.  How a guitar feels to you is more important than the brand name on the headstock.  It's worth spending all the money you have at the moment to get a guitar that feels good to you, since you can always buy an amp later.<br>  <br>  Trust your instincts, since one person's dream guitar is another's nightmare.  The more comfortable the guitar is in your hands, the more you'll practice and the sooner you'll become a great guitarist.  Good luck!|`|0AUPrCMZaa	it would be to your benefit to go to a guitar store and check what is in your price range....<br>  <br>  this is just an example of what is in your price range...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product/Ibanez-GRX20-Electric-Guitar?sku=519417" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/produ...</a>|`|vsRjnbTfaa	If you're just starting to learn how to play the guitar, i would not start with an electric.

And it's not. Why not have a character who has like, brown eyes or whatever, be actually mean when the main character thinks brown eyes means sweet? Seems a lot more realistic and less perfect, instead of everything going the same way.<br>  <br>  A person with brown eyes can be as cold and mean as a person with gray eyes. They don't choose what color eyes they are born with, therefore their personalities don't necessarily match that color.<br>  <br>  And it all depends on interpretation. Gray eyes to some could be distant, but to others could be a really pretty color.<br>  <br>  ETA: Well, it's not like everyone has to have different eye colors in a novel. You can have two of the same colors, there aren't many to choose from to begin with, unless you make your own. <br>  <br>  As for the harder to read thing; that's not eye color, hun. ^^ That has nothing to do with the color of the person's eyes.<br>  <br>  ETA: No, no, no. You're confused. You can't read someone's eyes by the COLOR. It's not the color that you see emotions in, it's the eyes themselves. I'm talking about the color. You CAN see emotions in eyes, but the eye color has nothing to do with it. I'm saying that people may associate gray eyes with being cold and unwelcome, but that's not necessarily true. Someone with gray eyes _could_ be cold and unwelcome but it has nothing to do with the color. It's just their personality.|`|kFBrOSMZaa	Green =D I dunno, I just like green eyes...|`|9RTuRPviaa	How about a light shade of green?|`|Ke0oWj4oaa	totally hazel<br>  <br>  or perhaps grey
AA12339318	Whether this works or not depends on YOUR marketing skills.  What will NOT work is you just putting up a website and just HOPING someone sees it and buys something.  Your site will be competing with tens of thousands of others, all with people HOPING to sell their stuff.<br>  <br>  Just Google the term, "custom designs" and see how many results pop up.  These are your competition.  Some of them are making money, but most are probably not.<br>  <br>  The primary function of ANY freelance artist is SALES.  Unless you have a customer, no one is going to pay you.  I spend a considerable amount of time and MONEY on three or four marketing campaings EACH YEAR.  I do direct mailings at TARGETED markets, where my skills are more likely to be needed.  All of my brocures, flyers, postcards and such are designed to showcase my talents and, if possible, create, in a potential client's mind, a NEED for my skills.<br>  <br>  This means a LOT of research.  MY research and methods won't apply to YOU, so you will have to plan out your own strategies.  But, you can't just sit around and wait for customers to come and find you.  YOU have to find your customers and SELL yourself and your wares.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

Either that or start dance at a junior college and then transfer to a performing arts college.<br>  <br>  After that you should try to dance for a professional dance company for a few years. Most schools want someone with professional experience. Not to mention a lot of professional dancers teach dance during the off season when they are not touring to supplement their income.<br>  <br>  A lot of the dance fields are specialized, into either, ballet, contemporary, or jazz dance, even hip hop to name the major ones. So try to find one you like and specialize in that.<br>  <br>  The other alternative is to get to know someone who has a school such as a relative, and have them take you under their and learn dance to eventually teach.|`|KsjUQ2Vuaa	well first you need experience ( well duhh lol ) <br>  requirments are: <br>  attitude <br>  experience <br>  commitment  <br>  effort <br>  and a buncha other stuff <br>  i assist and sub classes and im only 13 and love to dance <br>  be a dance teacher its soooo funn

I hope you find what you're looking for!|`|WxAjSjj2aa	Well there are more than one way to get a feeling across with it...<br>  <br>  Like "When Lives Cross" could give a Days of Our Lives feeling. Somewhat of an over cliched title.<br>  <br>  Or like someone above me mentioned "Jack and Randy" (or the brothers names), it would give it almost of a sitcom feeling. More of a relaxed, casual feeling.<br>  <br>  But something that i really suggest is making the title something that doesn't really give it away. Maybe since she's always switching lives between the two brothers, you should name the title after something that stays the same. Maybe a small item that symbolizes things staying the same.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your story :)
TQZnBFQOaa	Coolio! Sounds like you have a great idea going so far. I really like the title...hmmm I'm such a perfectionist when it comes to things I'm interested in and for some reason I'm interested in this now, and I'd love to help you come up with the perfect, creative album cover, but I just can't think of it yet... hm. For some reason something about a flower keeps coming to mind, I can't wait to figure out what my imagination has in stor for this (if anything ;)I'll keep thinking though!<br>  <br>  EDIT: I THINK I GOT IT...But It would be very hard to design WELL, so I'm sort of hesitant to say...<br>  <br>  If the 'Make Me All I Failed To Be' is directed to the girl (maybe I'm completely misinterpreting) then, I imagine this picture of the girl shaping clay into a beautiful pot type thing, but the guys' (or whoever is being made into something they failed to be) face could be vaguely seen on the pot--NOT in an obvious photo shop way, but somthing where his face is  distorted/ abstract considering it's like he's being spun around on a pottery making spool thanngg.  <br>  So idk, maybe you'll get that and it will sit well and grow wings for you, and if not good luck on your idea hunt!
nCLcdJO0aa	I liked it.<br>  <br>  In the middle, it says that Dad 'didn't care that my mother had died.'. Then, it starts saying that 'my mothers death affected him more than he let on. He never seemed to really heal from that wound.' That doesn't make sense, because first it's saying that he didn't care at all, and made him seem like an awful dad, then it says that he cares a lot.<br>  I'd change that if I were you.<br>  <br>  Other than that I only have one complaint about the last sentence. Change it to: (btw, pretend that capital letters is italic)<br>  THIS IS GOING TO BE FUN, I thought.<br>  <br>  <br>  That's pretty much everything, good luck writing!|`|NwpGhT31aa	It sounds good!<br>  <br>  E-mail me the rest when you have done the first chapter???|`|qbzt3r4xaa	Is life such..

5wF7FOqwaa	The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. Katniss has to choose between love and life, survival and humanity:<br>   "In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. The Capitol is harsh and cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing them all to send one boy and one girl between the ages of twelve and eighteen to participate in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV. Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives alone with her mother and younger sister, regards it as a death sentence when she is forced to represent her district in the Games. But Katniss has been close to dead before-and survival."<br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Hunger-Games/Suzanne-Collins/e/9780439023481/?itm=2" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Hun...</a><br>   The Maximum Ride series by James Patterson is a really good sci-fi series.

ii1AtjJ9aa	I don't see why not.  Impressionist paintings are loose and have lots of movement.  The paintings are the impression the artist gets from the subject matter, they are alive with feeling, light and color; they are a snap shot or moment in time.  if your painting exhibits these traits then it is an impressionistic painting.  You could also cut your sponge down to be able to have a bit more control if you like.  Have a look at some impressionist artist such as Monet and Renoir.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	A truer statement of impressionist painting might be that it involves building color images using a palette that has little or no black or dark browns - shadows being created by contrasts - and images are built up largely of dabs of color near each other, not mixed on the canvas..  The lack of dark makes the pictures glow with light and since most of their work is outdoors, that is what they are playing with. <br>    On the other hand, most of the junk amateur painting ("I don't see why they didn't give a prize to that one, it looks very nice") is impressionist in that it gives the impression of the scene and the artist shows no hint of drawing ability or of accurate rendering if it were needed ("Lets do a lovely stroke of dark green here for a tree trunk and another behind it.")<br>    I personally would think a sponge would be a poor tool for making the tight color by color spots that I consider hallmarks, but you might surprise me.<br>    Why do you have to label it?|`|TLzknS0eaa	I'd go for it Cookie and show what you've done. You could still excercise a fair bit of control and it was all about an impression of light and colour and not being a camera. Look at Monet's large works of water lilies;to me they are the start of abstract expressionism.|`|3ERx4opSaa	to me, impressionism painting is a style of painting that involves putting ones own impression of his or her perception, it can be done with a brush, palette knife, sponge, or a finger!

It's not video games, it's not music, it's not movies.

Neither did the media that gave them all the attention they craved.  Imagine how upset people would have been if Columbine wasn't heavily reported.|`|Q3xhERA5aa	Who can really answer this question.  All I can say is that children need love, time, guidance and direction.  They need to feel wanted and  find a purpose in life. They need to be nurtured and cared for. They need to have significant people in their lives spend time with them and listen to their problems and someone to turn to when life seems impossible.   Did these kids have this?  Who knows.  Did these kids every see the inside of a church?  Did they have anyone who ever prayed for them?  Who knows.  What a tragedy for everyone involved.|`|fZEVgFe8aa	The reasons are too numerous to contemplate.  I'm sure the many people directly involved still have no answers and never will.  No one can really know exactly what their relationship was with their parents but it might have played a role.  Also, through no fault of their own, lack of security and planning on the part of the schools.<br>  And, no offense to gun supporters, but their easy access to guns and bullets was also a major factor.|`|9A2qByAUaa	Why you posting a tribute to them? They were school losers and couldn't take life so they needed some attention.

People like Hitler, stalin and kim jong il are a**holes.  These people make it their life goal to start things on a massive scale.  <br>  <br>  From a scientific perspective, murphy's law and chaos theory come into play.  That, and the wide range of genetic coding and DNA, makes each person unique, and therefore there is going to be people who will start stuff.<br>  <br>  From a mathematical perspective, it is all in the numbers.  With that many people, and that many conflicting ideals, ideologies, religions, beliefs, governments, countries, races, and backgrounds.... there is almost a 0% chance there will EVER be complete peace on earth!<br>  <br>  From a religious perspective, the Abrahamic faiths all acknowledge that God has stated (which he has, at least according to the Bible) that there will never be peace on Earth, for men are turned evil and wicked because of Satan.<br>  <br>  From a moral perspective, some people are simply born evil, and relish in it.<br>  <br>  From a psychological perspective, nobody on earth is perfect, and NOBODY can go an entire lifetime without any even minor altercation! (With the exception of Jesus... to my knowledge, he didn't do this.)  Therefore, once those minor altercations start, pride and vengeance and emotions take over, and the fights escalate, and if they are between countries, war breaks out!<br>  <br>  From a utilitarian/governmental perspective... altercations, fights, and wars are not simply a loss of life, men, money, supplies, and resources.  They are ALSO a means of gambling- a chance to either win big, or lose big... and gain or lose territory and international standing in the process.  (See "the winners rewrite history".  Why do you think there is 10 times more hatred towards Hitler than towards Stalin?  This thinking, however, is eradicated when one looks at how many deaths each dictator was responsible for. :P )<br>  <br>  From an Irish perspective, God had a good day when he gave us beer, whiskey, gin, champagne, shots, wine, and all the other alcoholic beverages out there.  These often lead to angry fights as well.|`|76dcb099ecefd4237e1f33f3914a97baaa	From early childhood we are all brainwashed to be egomaniacs.|`|RrKED6b2aa	luv it =]?|`|YmtNel5haa	what a sad price we pay<br>  at the end of the day<br>  all the glory is gone<br>  what did we do wrong?<br>  the shame is real<br>  so why don't they feel?<br>  it's beyond all this...<br>  <br>  <br>  HH- you know I am not a poet.

b8e7225eb1b9214f4836b0310368ade6aa	Hitler and his National Socialist Party played to the natural desires of a large portion of the nation. Like italy w/ Mussolini, the country was in tough economic straights and he pandered to their desire for "change!' They accepted change at any cost at that time, so they were complicit to some extent, (kinda has a familiar ring to today doesn't it?)  <br>  Remember the Nazis were not some outside group of individuals, they came from the rank and file of Germany. In all fairness, there was some virulent opposition prior to his becoming Fuhrer by the Christian Democrat party members and others, but that was quelled quickly after attained absolute power. He even quelled opposition in his own party after his control was not in doubt anymore. (See "night of the long knives")|`|QusqTXCaaa	In all fairness, Hitler was appointed Chancellor before the elections.<br>  <br>  After he was appointed Chancellor, he used government money to fund propaganda and the spread of hysteria.

Once Hitler took power, membership in the party was mandatory for government workers. Eventually the party took over most  the functions of the government.<br>  <br>  In short, it's impossible to separate the Nazi party from the Germans|`|6k90tHsAaa	It is a mis-conception.  Not all Germans were Nazi`s that`s like saying all US citizens are Republicans.  It`s just not true.  It is sometimes easier to say "Germany was evil" when what is really meant is "Nazi Germany" committed some heinous crimes as a whole.  There were many groups that resisted, the white rose resistance and the 15 assassination attempts on Hitler evidence this, but the Gestapo and SD were pretty compelling to at least force passive support of the Nazi party.|`|TskZHzZyaa	I would encourage anybody that has the chance to visit a Holocaust Museum.  I have been to the one in Washington DC.  Germany was the primary country that committed the crimes, but lets take the one against the Jews.  Several countries could had said no but did not.  Two did - Bulgaria and Norway.  Bulgaria actually dragged their feet and made great excuses to not allow the Nazis to take their Jews.  <br>  <br>  Mussolini and the Italians were on board with fascism and anti-semitism, too.  Like followers of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States they bought into Jews being bad because "history" says they killed Jesus.  <br>  <br>  Anti-Semitism was ingrained into the Germans though thanks to the writings of Martin Luther, the founder of Lutheranism, Germany's prominent religion.  Poor economics, Germany feeling raped by the treaty of Versailles, and Hitler's fanaticism raised the furor of patriotism and hatred in Germany to fanatical levels.  Sadly the Lutheran Church did not denounce these writings until 1994, a full 49 years after the evidence of the Holocaust was exposed by the allied troops.<br>  <br>  The Germans perfected the art of war too.  And let's face it, the Germans lost - had they not they would be calling teh US and Soviet Union the bad guys.  And we would be speaking German, if not clones of Hitler.  They really did horrific things to Europe and the world.<br>  <br>  One of my friends was so tired of the WWII shows that she referred to the History Channel as the Hitler Channel.|`|N64LKqWkaa	germany was primarily 1 party under the rule of the nazis, other parties such as communist were driven out or accused of something and sent to a camp, or fleed the country.|`|Mxe36NZEaa	Most Germans at the time were supportive of the Nazi party.|`|cF2Wa1tqaa	because germany was like 90% nazis at the time, they all supported hitler, the ones who didnt were killed..|`|9X4inaEpaa	idk its kind of like the china and communist party

qMnuRO50aa	I don't really know how the clarinet transposes and everything, because I know there's B flat clarinets and A clarinets, among others...<br>  <br>  All I can tell you is this... since you say that you have three flats in the key signature and are raising the B flat, that means you would be playing the c harmonic minor scale, because a harmonic minor means a raised 7th - and the 7th note of the c minor scale is a b flat.

They might even create an insulative effect on the wall and prevent the fire from reaching you.

You know why you (assuming you're American) can't eat a bald eagle for the same reason Canadians can't eat maples. BUT if Canadians can eat maple syrup, you can eat bald eagle syrup, vice versa.|`|LbipT3yIaa	because maple syrup isn't alive or endangered|`|om0zcFigaa	Hmm...|`|1JnS7nNkaa	If your question were a logic puzzle, then the answer would be that you couldn't eat a bald eagle if you weren't an American.<br>  If your question was an exercise in clear thinking, then the answer would involve the need to distinguish between national symbols and products which bear a likeness of those symbols.<br>  If your question was intended to stimulate thought on comparative legal systems, then you would realize that although it is against our laws to kill a bald eagle, it is not illegal to ride a Harley.  It is not an outrage to draw a picture of a bald eagle. You won't get death threats for making a movie about them. A child wearing an eagle costume for the school play won't provoke an honor killing.  Going to an Eagles concert won't get your ears lopped off. All of which makes not being able to eat a bald eagle a rather insignificant price to pay.<br>  On the other hand, if you're just carping, then consider this: if you were doing your business out and about in the Canadian woods, no one would care if you used a maple leaf. Besides, they probably have most of the bugs worked out of their socialized medicine program.  Time to emigrate, eh?|`|oLj0VTX5aa	Because Maple syrup does not come from a source that is protected.  Also, the correlation is off.  Maple Syrup comes from trees, which leaves the trees intact, where as eating an bald eagle kills the bird.

suxCcXkAaa	While the novel does touch on the dangers of censorship, Bradbury was adamant that this was not his focus. The novel is about the dangers of television, he said, and his fears that such mindless entertainment would replace recreational free thinking. Remember that in the 1950s color TV was the hot new thing; it represented the burgeoning empire of leisure. Add into the mix Cold War fears of “suspect” individuals and a need for straight-laced conformity, and you’ve got an environment ripe for Fahrenheit-style fears. Critics recognized the relevance of Bradbury’s work then, and still do today. <br>  --From Shmoop.<br>  <br>  For more info on that, check out the link below.|`|BzMQejGxaa	It's not considered a classic book.

But only a few weeks ago, in Beverly Hills one night, a husband and wife passed me, walking their dog. I stood staring after them, absolutely stunned. The woman held in one hand a small cigarette-package-sized radio, its antenna quivering. From this sprang tiny copper wires which ended in a dainty cone plugged into her right ear. There she was, oblivious to man and dog, listening to far winds and whispers and soap-opera cries, sleep-walking, helped up and down curbs by a husband who might just as well not have been there. This was not fiction.[8]<br>  <br>  Bradbury directly foretells this incident, and perhaps the ubiquitous iPod a half century later, early in the work:<br>  <br>  And in her ears the little Seashells, the timble radios tamped tight, and an electronic ocean of sound, of music and talk and music and talking coming in. p.13|`|hQ95u9OLaa	Because it is about a topic near and dear to the minds of writers and authors. It is the highest form of censorship-the burning of books which is the burning of ideas.
kjm5A5Ikaa	I am into Urban Theatre. Three plays that I have seen and loved are "Fabric of a man", "Love on layaway" and "Diary of a Mad Black Woman". <br>  <br>  The first two were created by a playwright named David E. Talbert.<br>  <br>  The Fabric of a Man is a story of Dominique Majors (Tammy Townsend), an up-and-coming fashion designer, a strong young woman who believes in her talent and has a passion for her work. She is in love with Blair Godfrey (Clifton Powell), a self-centered stockbroker who wishes she'd focus less on her career and more on him. One night Dominique stumbles into an old-school dry cleaner, where she meets Joshua King (Darren DeWitt Henson), a good-looking young tailor who takes interest in more than just her dry cleaning. Her father is a minister and she has stopped going to church to concentrate on her career and boyfriend. Even though everyone tells her he is no good for her, she makes excuses for his behavior. <br>  <br>  Torn between the comfort of finance and the potential of new romance, Dominique is forced to decide which fabric of which man best suits her. The acting and the singing is superb(I didn't know Tammy Townsend could sing like that), and the plot has the capability of holding the interest of the viewer throughout the performance.<br>  <br>  Love on layaway(my favorite) is about three couples crowded into a Philadelphia brownstone attempt to live together without losing their minds in this filmed performance of David E. Talbert's popular stage play. It seems that the romance in all three couples' relationships has hit the skids, and Monique Graham's (Deborah Cox) displeasure with her commitment-phobic boyfriend Anthony (Mel Jackson) is only the beginning of the romantic woes. Single mother Epiphany (Joi Campbell) is hard-pressed when forced to make a choice between her current boyfriend, Reggie (Chico Benymon), or her precocious six-year-old son, Man Man (Robbie Lewis Jr). And speaking of epiphanies, Ms. Willanetta's (Cassi Davis) recent religious experience has forced her to question her relationship with Renzo (Buddy Lewis), a man with whom she has been romantically involved with for over a decade. Let me show you the clip of my favorite part; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBbi2K2XTR8&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBbi2K2XT...</a> (I missed Deborah Cox. She is one of my favorite singers. I loved her performance in this play, and I was SOOOOOO happy to hear her again after a long time.)<br>  <br>  Diary of a Mad Black Woman was different from the movie. It was more light-hearted, funnier, and I had more sympathy for the husband in this play, than the idiot Charles in the movie.|`|6KABGtqvaa	their all musicals but i love them<br>  <br>  seven brides for seven brothers<br>  singin' in the rain<br>  chicago<br>  <br>  and a whole bunch more but it only said three :)|`|3BMkVvitaa	Mary Poppins,Little Mermaid,and .....oh...i love Shreck!it rocks!|`|124b8214eb664ed4dbd7ada2f92c942daa	Dark of the Moon is amazing! so is "The Actors Nightmare"
fbd87c7846199694ba9130c99b6e261caa	An executive producer is basically a producer who is not involved in any technical aspects of the filmmaking process, but they are still responsible for the overall success of the production. Usually they handle the business and legal issues.<br>  <br>  A producer is the head of staff of a movie production in all matters other then the creative side of stuff that the director does.  A producer is responsible for raising funds for a film, hiring key personnel, and arranging for distributors.|`|S01zIagOaa	The bigger the budget the more separated the responsibilities are of the various producers. The lower the budget is, the more various producers will wear multiple hats. <br>  <br>  In general Exec Producers at the independent level are generally fund raisers or it can be a credit given to the actual individuals who've put their money into a production. At the studio level it's generally an individual or individuals with the clout to bring a "package" together. The package being a group of stars, director, writer (script) and other producers.<br>  <br>  Producers are more day to day personnel from Pre production to production and through post production. Their job is to generally pull and put all things in place that everyone from cast to the crew will need to carry out a successful production. A producer may very well be the person who optioned a screenplay or novel and brought it to the Executive Producer to secure financing or whatever overall deal making that persons clout allows them to make in order to get the production off the ground. For instance, there are two guys credited as producers on Michael Bay's Tranformers. They didn't actually do any producing duties on the film, they were simply the guys who kept the project alive while it bounced around Hollywood. Once Michael Bay was on board (credited not only as director but Exec Producer), his usual crew of producers took over from there. <br>  <br>  Line Producers: Draw up the line item budget for the production which the producers (if they are smart) will treat as their bible. <br>  <br>  Assoc. Producers: Is generally a credit given out in lieu of actual money. It can be a star or producers assistant, it can even be individuals who've put minor amounts of financing into a production. There's no real hard and fast rule.|`|aKj4ZxAFaa	the producer is the one who produce... haha, well in fact he is, but he is the one in charge of "Cam 2, closer to Brad pitt eyes" "Cam 3 Full shot to angelina and maryl" and that stuff, and the executive...i dont know haha good luck bye bye

CwJtuJ8Kaa	I think i shud agree somewat with u dear...<br>  <br>  History is a tool for strongest to twist real events!!!<br>  many of the current written history are wrong(of course with the help of excavation and science some are being re-written, maybe into truth(only The Creator knows whether they are true or not) ) <br>  <br>  I shall give a striking expl.<br>  Its is said that Aryan people migrated(invaded is what so called PhD historians uses, new scientific excavations all over South-east Asia cannot confirm any invasion) from Europe !!!,West Asia(some says) to South-east Asia. And the Clue thay got is "Horse" ya that’s it just an animal which even now is a free-range animal. The theory claims that South-east Asian region wasn’t having any Horses, so if at anytime horses are seen in this part then it could only be because someone from the North-west(Europe) brought them!!!.<br>  Okkk okkk now i too got a PhD ..so here is my theory ....<br>  "Sarus crains was brought into many parts of the world by someone from Siberia!!!!<br>  and penguins seen at the coast of South Africa was because someone from Antarctica gave them a lift on his cruise boat abut 5000 years ago!!!!<br>  Suppose horses cannot migrate, then was it only possible for people to go in only one direction i.e from north-west to south west-central-south east!!!!!<br>  A British Imperial solider, in his findings found out this thing...after Buddha there was a great migration of Buddhist disciples towards all sides. he even go forward and says that Christianity is borne or bore Buddhist ideology and thats because a Mahayanna Buddhist monk(there was two sect of Buddhists; Henayanna[they dont wear any cloths] and Mahayanna Buddhist[they wear white cloths]) came to Jerusalem and preached his teachings residing at some caves...and he could hav taught John(who baptized Jesus) Buddhist philosophy... .Remember immersing oneself in running water was a new concept to that society,thats y it became a custom. But all the Buddhist .Jainist ,Hindus where doing this for many many centuries before Christ.<br>  In customs of Brahmanism(Hinduism),if someone get some impurity due to his or someone's deed, then he has to immerse himself in running stream, river or in a pond.(Impurity will not go if he just pour some water over the head)<br>  And tell me how the ritual of baptizing was carried out on jesus by John?!<br>  From thousands of years the hindu pandits(prests) use white clots alone..and in vedas it is written that they shud only use cloths that are not swed or stiched...and it shud be white cotton in three peices.....tell me the wardrobe of a Hagi going to mecca or abut the gown of jesuit followers ....<br>  How Japan got Buddhism (and remember Japan is at the extreme east)<br>  If u wants more ancient thought then we can go to them also...to the Pagan religion societies who where the mighty before Semitics...Think of where u can find clues of pagan religions in our present world...The only strong prominent pagan religion in existence is HINDUISM! and tell me from which part of the world this religion has its origin??<br>  Think how cud Cambodia got AngorWat(one of the seven wonders of the world)<br>  Think ..ancient Egyptian's used to have animal gods, they revered Sun/Fire and river/water<br>  <br>  Then abut language. Sanskrit is the mother of all of the so called Indo-Aryan language.<br>  1st thing people in a society will do is to find an identity for them, for that they has to define and distinguish themselves from animals. so they will define themselves ..and definition we all no..its "MAN" isnt it???? do u no the root of this word "Ma" is in Sanskrit and the word itself derives from "Manav" ,means human in Sanskrit(it is still used in Hindi and other lang) <br>  there are thousands of words whose roots can be found in Sanskrit.<br>  But this doesnt mean that everything sprout out from Sanskrit and south-east area ..saying that will we be following the 1st line of this comment...<br>  <br>  Taking and giving was, is and will be the way forward for all the human societies and one who can accept this in heart can calm himself/herself &get happy by knowing that predecessors of his/her ancestors are every where and all are one!!....yes we all are one<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Now , THE HISTORICAL THOUGHT OF THE DAY ( Very serious one ) ;-P <br>  <br>  After many many centuries students will learn their history from their PhD historians like this<br>  "...American (US) people where the ancestors of Europeans(at least Britons)....in the middle of ___ century many US citizens gone to the tiny island of England for holydays. Then gradually they established holiday homes...then they settled..."<br>  Think, even now of if this is taught in some closed controlled society (take N.Korea or talibanized regions in afganistan and pakistan) this will became a true history in that society. suppose assume that such a society becomes the mighty influential power in the world and their leaders are selfish and pride in nature then the history they say will be the History!!<br>  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...<br>  Thank god no one upto now hav said that Inca people are from centeral asia or from inda or Iran .....but u no...if some catastrope happen to the world and if somehow no one will be der left to describe old history(our history) then the new generation will start "escavation" and will findout this and will write on to their new history texts ...".... true indians where people of American Continent..they wr called incas azetica and so on...and to distingush their superiority over other indian's(aryan indians,dravidian indians..othr asian indians..europian indians african indians !!) they wr called <br>  RED INDIAN...meansing  RIGHT INDIANS  " lwith a subnote telling " the word RIGHT changed to RED by the continuous verbal usage"!!!!!!<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  i dont no on wat basis the buddy who posted reply just abv mine makes his point.....<br>  The theory of migration and colonization. .ohhh phruooo i'm tired by hearing that again and again......why shud some group from a same society go to colder north and another to hotter south...are they mad!!!!...The area that everyone speaking abut is called Asia-minor ..which in my opinion never existed at all....<br>  then abut settling at the northern part of India....if they can travel large distance from central asia..then i'm asking why they ***** just travel few more Kms south to the fertile areas of Andhra pradesh and Karnataka(which are in the southern part of India)????one cud go to south india from north india in under 30-45 days that too simply by walking!!!<br>  Then before Jesus (that’s era around 300-200BC) the records are there abut emperor Chandragupta Maurya's courtesans and female guards which the emperor "imported" from Europe(greek-roman) and Africa(maybe Egypt &other parts)<br>  Also,the Great Indian Mathematician Aryabhatta(an aryan Bhramin),Arybhattyem was his work, was a south Indian, most probably from Kerala ,the extreme southern tip of India.. Many many prominent others the so called "aryans" are also there who are from the south ...<br>  Then abut the word Arya and Dravida<br>  these doesnt denotes any two group of peoples..<br>  Arya in Sanskrit means "the able noble one:"  and "dravida" is the place of a region...in many hindu scriptures people of dravadian regions are addressed over and again by this title of "Arya"<br>  its just has the meaning of present day "SIR"(somewat)<br>  then the epic Ramayan and Mahabharatha tells us alot abut people of Indian sub-continent traveling all over India and sometimes abroad....<br>  And abut language conection with South Dravidian and North Aryan (Sanskrit)…its wrong to say that southern dravadian language don’t hav any connection or similarity with Sanskrit…of course the writing script is different(like english and sanskrit scripts)... but many  words of Dravidian lang are derived from Sanskrit…lets take the Man(english) ,Sanskrit(manav) <br>  In Malayalam and tamil (the two of the four south Indian languages,the states these languages are spoken is at the extreme southern tip of india) <br>  The word for Man(Eng)/Manav(Sank) are  “manusyan” and  “manam” respectively …how cud thay get such a similarity if they are not connected….many other word eg are available|`|JS3Zy6ASaa	The kinship of indian languages with European ones was noted as long ago as the 18th century by Sir william Jones.

Most, but not all, of the languages in Europe are akin to the languages of Southern Asia.  It was called the Indo-European invasion.  The two languages that I think that are not Indo-European are Finnish and Magyar (Hungarian) and they are very closely related.  If my memory serves me right, they are Ugric.  that point is interesting in that those two languages are separated by a lot, many many miles.

The Indian branch ended up linguistically dominating the north, while the western branch dominated all of Europe except the Basque country.<br>  <br>  While any such people likely intermarried with locals along their route, it would be entirely possible that there are genetic lines that continued through these migrations.<br>  <br>  However, often a language or parts of it can be transmitted by other means.

The Ainu people are Japanese people who were affected by S.Russian Aryans( from the Iranians and Indians) <br>  The effect is obvious, but not much people realise it. Most Japanese people have hair color other than the E.Asian black hair, including blonde and red hair, their skin color is whiter than other oriental skin colors, their names are closer to Aryan names,their language is different(some words sound Farsi), and especially their logic is different.

BMxNOJ39aa	Generally, arguments that question the moral justification of using atomic bombs have suggested that Japan was doomed and would have surrendered shortly. The suggestion has also been made that the atomic bomb "should have" been used as a "demonstration," that it be dropped offshore and away from Japan. These arguments tend to ignore the military and political situation that existed in 1945. They question the use of the weapons based on records captured after the surrender of Japan, plus the morality of today, coupled with opinions shaped from 50 years of living with atomic weapons. In other words, information and facts not known to those that made the decision in 1945. Japan however, still had an effective air force. One bomber on an announced flight path could have been shot down. The "demonstration" would have failed, and the bomb lost. There were only two atomic bombs in the Pacific theater.<br>  <br>   The following are some facts about the period before the use of the weapons.<br>   <br>   The expected initial invasion of Japan on Kyushu would have resulted in an estimated 1,000,000 allied casualties. This was based on the 20,000 casualties at Iwo Jima and 50,000 casualties at Okinawa. After the war, President Truman placed the "killed in action" estimate at 500,000. (The term "casualties" includes those killed, wounded and missing) While these estimates have been revised over the last 50 years, even the lowest numbers constitute very high numbers of dead and wounded. The numbers do not include the Japanese. The defenders of Iwo Jima and Okinawa fought to the death, (there were only a very few prisoners taken). It was expected that the few soldiers would surrender in their defense of the home islands. The civilians on the island Okinawa committed suicide in large numbers rather than surrender. Given these facts, the expected Japanese death toll would have been huge.<br>  <br>  The invasion of Kyushu was not intended to take the entire island. Only the southern half would be occupied and it would be turned into a network of airfields. From these airfield bombing of Japan would proceed at a 24/7 rate. During the spring of 1945 a two week period had 1,600 sorties against four cities, destroying 31 square miles of occupied areas. The firestorms created produced temperatures of over 2000 degrees and became self sustaining. In one raid on Tokyo, 46 square kilometers of the city were burned, 267,000 buildings were destroyed, and over 120,000 people killed. The use of the atomic weapon at Hiroshima resulted in 66,000 killed. Relieved of long missions from distant Islands (The B-29 had a range of 1,500 miles) and supported by fighters, American bombers could bomb Japan almost at will. Imagine night after night where firestorms kill at the same level of the atomic bomb.<br>   <br>   Japanese were warned five days prior to the first actual bombing. Rather then act on it, they chose to not reply. Diplomatic records have been interpreted to suggest that Japan was trying to surrender. However, the terms of surrender had been repeatedly stated and were known to the Japanese government. There were diplomat contacts through Switzerland so Japan was not cutoff from communicating with the allies. Japan could have simple broadcast on commercial radio frequencies as surrender. "Tokyo Rose" a propaganda program aimed at US troops was listened to by many of the Americans. A surrender request would have been quickly acted on.<br>  <br>  The Japanese knew that there were very few beaches in the home islands suitable for landings. Rather then evacuating the civilian population away from danger, they mobilized the population to defend their homeland, some with no more than bamboo spears. Again, considering the actions of civilians on Okinawa, it was expected civilian casualties would have been much higher than those of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.<br>   <br>   The kamikaze missions are still a source of Japanese pride. For the allies they were a horror. A means of attack that was almost impossible to defend against and conducted with a seeming disregard for human life. This had an enormous psychological impact on the allies. They simply could not understand the motivation of the Japanese. To the allies, the kamikaze attacks would be expected during the actual invasion, plus suicidal attacks from the ground forces.<br>   <br>   The Japanese military could still muster three million troops. It had stockpiled thousands of planes for suicide attacks on the invaders. In fact, after the decision had been made to surrender and the emperor had recorded the surrender message, troops attempted to stage a coup, seize the recording, and continue the war.<br>   <br>  Japan had announced that an invasion would result in the execution of all allied prisoners. The POWs knew this and volunteers were ready to rush the wire when the killings began. Already many POWs had died as the ships carrying them to Japan had been sunk by American submarines. Japan made no effort to safeguard the POWs on the ships.<br>  <br>  Japan's un|`|AA11304025	no, it's always wrong to burn babies|`|AA11464625	As a person who studies WW2 and makes a hobby of interviewing vets from that war, I can tell for a fact that most vets (any U.S. military) from that generation, justifies the drop of the atomic bomb. Many vets where tired of the war and wanted it to end. As positive as the war effort from that era looks to us today in history, many of the vets were tired and ready to come home. No matter how hard of a time some might give Truman for giving the go ahead he was no major in physics and had know clue (neither did the physicists of that time for that matter) and understood the horrid outcome and long term after affects of those two bombs. Those old atomic style weapons were very dirty and caused the people of Japan a lot of slow and painful deaths. Do I think Truman signed off the bomb knowing that? No. No matter what some extremest might say about Truman, I think he was a man who would not have slept at night if he knew what he had done to the people of Japan. He wanted the War to end and Japan was not making it easy on us to bring it to a end. Truman saw it as saving men's lives and dollars and cents and had no clue what he unleashed. <br>  <br>  To answer your question by today's history knowledge, no he was not justified but for that time period he was. I know that is not give you exactly what you are looking for but it is my opinion.|`|pI5jKfmaaa	Since you want to make your thesis on the subject you deserve all the help that could be provided.

He needed to end the war in the Pacific and he needed to show the Russians who had an army of a million ready to invade from korea that the United States was a major power and had something the soviets did not. <br>  <br>  In reality the bombs probably did more to aid the latter argument than the former. although some advisers said that millions of men could be lost in a land invasion of Japan these projections are on the pessimistic side and most other advisers thought that the american army would be able to walk all the way through the country without firing a shot. <br>  <br>  So no, the dropping of the bombs was not justified but war never can be.|`|DjAKQrtraa	The implicit counterargument is that if Truman had not used the bomb, then no one would have used the bomb. This is illogical. If it had not been the US, some other country would have eventually used the bomb. Singling out Truman or the US and somehow assigning blame for "setting this chain of events in motion" is ignorant of the fact that technological progress is inevitable and someone was going to develop and use nuclear weapons around the middle of the 20th century. It might as well be the US, then at least we keep the initiative.|`|w5C0XrNOaa	Imagine this: You, not your grandfather or great-grandfather, but you are 20 years old in May of 1945. You're in a little town in Germany that you'd never heard of a couple of weeks ago called Roblenz. The War in Europe is over and except for a couple of weeks here and there for 11 months youv'e done nothing but kill people and tried not to get killed yourself.  But about 10 months ago you realized you'd probably never see your mother or your father or brother or sister again. You've seen half of your friends die in horrible ways, some of them breathing their last breath as you held them in your arms. And because some didn't die because they had done something foolish, they were just in the wrong place when a piece of steel or lead came out of nowhere at a very high velocity and struck their body, you realized there just too many ways to die out here and too few things you could do to prevent it. <br>  But by some miracle you had made it, the fighting was over and you are still alive. Thoughts of home could once again be brought up and you even start thinking about what your going to do when you get there.<br>  Now imagine this, you hear a rumor about a bomb so powerful it can destroy an entire city. Then you hear another rumor that involves you and rest of the guys lucky enough to have survived. Your going to be shipped over to the Pacific, go through some more training and then be part of the assault on the main Japanese island and that casualties were expected to be very high.<br>  What would be going through your mind at that time?<br>  Maybe: How long can my luck last?<br>  Maybe: I was at Omaha, I know what heavy casualties means.<br>  Maybe: Haven't I done enough?<br>  Maybe: Why can't they use that bomb I've heard about so I can have a chance to find a girl and get married and have kids and grow old?<br>  What do you think about whether using the bomb was justified or not now?|`|waSOgHroaa	Hard to say...the Japanese were obstinate little bastards who refused to surrender and the only way seen was to drop the bomb on them and show what terrible power could be unleashed upon.

iNXqiDIYaa	It is generally considered to be an adult fantasy novel<br>  <br>  Lilith is a fantasy novel written by Scottish writer George MacDonald and first published in 1895. Its importance was recognized in its later revival in paperback by Ballantine Books as the fifth volume of the celebrated Ballantine Adult Fantasy series in September 1969
AA10997286	Favorite: Jane Eyre. She's a strong, passionate woman who stands up for herself and doesn't let anyone walk all over her. Simple, straightforward, expressive and optimistic. Her horrible childhood also made me pity her. Her drawings sound beautiful. Her words are meaningful. She suffered throughout most of the book and got what she deserved in the end. (But then, I also love Lizzy Bennet from Pride and Prejudice.)<br>  <br>  Least: Bella Swan from Twilight. She is the most painfully annoying character I have ever come across. I've read about bad characters in the past, but she takes the cake. Whiny, stupid, horny, indecisive, snobby, a Mary Sue, a try-hard at sounding modest, inconsiderate and the cliche damsel-in-distress. She made horrible choices in the end and is a bad role model for the hormonal teens who enjoy Stephenie Meyer's books.|`|usvPMtMtaa	favourite - dumbledore<br>  hate - bella swan or edward cullen. perhaps all twilight characters in general|`|kfOpbbCyaa	Several would fit into a favorites category and several in a least favorite, but I don't have one particular character for either.<br>  <br>  Favorite at this moment in time (though it can change between characters as the mood strikes):<br>  Elizabeth Bennet (Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen) - She's flawed but honest and full of wit and humor, and much more.<br>  <br>  Least favorite at this moment in time (though, like my favorite, it is liable to change based on my whim):<br>  Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte) - He is so consumed by the need for revenge that he strikes out at anybody and everybody.|`|yvyewZrWaa	My Favorite: I have quite a few, but I'll just list a couple of them-<br>  Mr. Rochester from "Jane Eyre", not because I relate to him, but because I always find him very amusing and Bronte made him sympathetic despite his faults/mistakes. I also quite like Jane. <br>  Mr. William Guppy from "Bleak House", because his antics always make me chuckle, and he and his motives are surprisingly complex despite him being a secondary character.<br>  I also always liked Anne from "Anne of Green Gables" because she is very realistic and imaginative.<br>  <br>  My Least Favorite: Cathy/Heathcliff. You may recall that she says "I AM Heathcliff" at one point, so I think they can count as one. Cathy is an bit of an idiot and I always found her to be a real b****. I dislike Heathcliff because he has serious self-control/boundary issues, although I suppose you can root them back to the psychological pains inflicted upon him as a child. Still, they deserve each other.<br>  Edward/Bella are in the same boat. Actually, they're worse because a.) their story lacks the genuine passion and poetry b.) they lack originality c.) they have no excuse whatsoever for their bad personalities d.) he sparkles.|`|Hc16k31qaa	Jessica Darling from the Sloppy Firsts series is probably my favorite character. She's just a mix of things that are full of life, and she is an adolescent which shakes things up a bit. <br>  <br>  I don't think i have a least favorite character. Every character serves a purpose, so there's not really a reason to have a least favorite character.|`|InslW3QMaa	My favorite character: Emily from The Book Of Luke because she is so nice but she is trying to act very rude and I also like Luke in that book to. <br>  Least favorite: THE F*** twilight book all the characters suck pointless and they don't really have a personality. I want to burn those stupid books|`|F7EhEYSYaa	Sydney Carton - The Tale of Two Cities<br>  Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy- Pride and Prejudice<br>  Edmond Dantes - The Count of Monte Cristo <br>  Fred Weasly- Harry Potter 1-7 <br>  Sirius Black- Harry Potter 3-5 <br>  <br>  <br>  Least Favorite- Bella Swan<br>  She's so annoying and Whiny, and Stubborn, and WHY must she always be the Damsel in Distress??|`|U3qsVeqZaa	I don't really have a favorite, because I love a bunch of characters.<br>  <br>  Least favorite would be Lena Groove from Light in August. She is dimwitted, and a bit slow to realize some things...I just don't like her, though Joe Christmas is a cat!|`|U5TDVhBFaa	my favorite -Dr.Faustus-a true heretic,the one written by Christopher Marlowe.<br>  I hated the Rose Cabarcas,in Memories of My Melancholy Wh@re$,by Gabriel Garcia Marquez- she is a child sex trafficker-total sociopath|`|u0zEutf1aa	Favorite: Erik from "The Phantom of the Opera" by Gaston Leroux. He starts out a complete myster of whom we only know from all these stories and notes of his (a death's head! No, a head of fire! No nose! Sits in Box Five and freaks everyone out!) That made him interesting to me from the start. When we finally meet him...well, he made me laugh, cry, and freak out. He has a horrible looking face and nobody ever showed him love, so he wanted to force a young woman to love him, but then he let her go, because she had kissed him. The last scene was so sad and beautiful. <br>  <br>  Close runner-ups: Edward Rochester, Sydney Carton, and, strangely enough, Javert<br>  <br>  Least Favorite: Phoebus, from The Hunchback of Notre Dame by Victor Hugo. Esmeralda loved him, was willing to give up everything for him, and he just used her for sex and didn't even care when she was about to die. <br>  <br>  Close Runner-ups: Cathy (from WH) (the first one), Victor Frankenstein<br>  <br>  ?M?|`|uGmEjSLDaa	I like Sydney Carton, above, but I've got to go, for favorite, with Huckleberry Finn, because he is one of the most 'real' characters ever created (interestingly, another one that came to mind was a real person: Perry Smith from In Cold Blood, who is the saddest and most twisted person ever written--I empathized with him when I first read In Cold Blood as an impressionable fourteen-year-old, and that's a testament to Capote's skill in drawing him as a character.)<br>  <br>  Most favorite genre fiction character is probably Ged from Ursula K. LeGuin's 'Earthsea' novels (narrowly beating out Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser, Kid ('Dhalgren'), and Nazhuret from R.A. MacAvoy's 'Lens of the World' series).<br>  <br>  Least favorite character: Howard Roark sucks. Ayn Rand sucks too. The fact that she thinks Roark is admirable is just amazing. Roark would be great as an antihero or villain, but he's supposed to be a true-blue hero, and it just kills me.|`|S4W7FojCaa	My favorite: Alexander Claybourne from Deeper Than The Night (this book had a twist): It's been a while since I read the book, but he has always been my favorite. I remember just going 'oh my gosh' whenever he did or said something. The author was very good at portraying the character. The book was a romance, but there was some pretty good action in there. The twist at the end really made it worth while in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Least Favorite: Bella Swan: She is so boring, whiny, stubborn, only thinks of herself...I just loathe her!|`|SBhVZD4Xaa	Sydney Carton from A Tale of Two Cities.  The story takes place during the french revolution . He's an alcoholic attorney who thinks life's hopeless until he meets this one girl.  She likes someone else more though, and when her lover gets sentenced to death, carton goes to the guillotine in his place out of deference to the girl he loves, even though she doesn't love him as much.

I could feel how upset you were by your vivid descriptions. I took a few poetry classes in college and  the poems that I think were best did not necessarily tell a story like this one but gave more feelings.

WJLl0d3Jaa	Tip: Don't choose photography as a major, especially during these times. Go for something that'll put at least a roof over your head, pay for groceries, etc and for your camera gear.<br>  <br>  Besides, you don't need a degree to become a photographer. If you want to work with newspapers and stuff, take a few classes, but major in something like journalism or even sociology. Otherwise, hold a day job and open your own photo business.|`|k8AcVixTaa	You don't need to major i anything to be a photographer.  It is good to get a college degree but is not necessary.

They were more interested in what I could do.

She is also very critical about marriage as a business, and instead believes it should be about love.<br>  <br>  Oh, and in the 19th Century, Jane Austen was considered hilarious with her dry wit- so maybe, with popular culture changing a great deal, this humour comes out as cynicism today?|`|DvToP5h7aa	Jane Austen Biography: Life and Family (1775-1817)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jasa.net.au/jabiog.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jasa.net.au/jabiog.htm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/janelife.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/janeli...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/janeinfo.html#janetoc" rel="nofollow">http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/janein...</a><br>  <br>  Jane Austen - Biography & Works<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.literaturecollection.com/a/jane-austen" rel="nofollow">http://www.literaturecollection.com/a/ja...</a>|`|9Nw85MAdaa	I would actually call her a romantic.

I am so sorry he is experiencing this, as all children are so innocent and beautiful, so I prey that he will be free and at peace. And from what I know there is no heaven or hell, as those are just metaphorical words for the experience of transforming from this body into another plane.

One is the way to heaven, one is the way to reincarnation. There is no hell, only returning to this earth to live again. You get into the first door by having good actions in this life. You won't know what's happened until you get through whichever door you're going through though.|`|fQFdG9Zgaa	This is the price we pay for being intelligent beings...we are aware of our own mortality. Think of it this way if you don't really believe in the afterlife: Its exactly like it was before you were born. That concept kind of messes with the mind, huh? But honestly, I really don't know. Nobody does.<br>  <br>  Despite the fact that many people claim to know what happens (christians, muslims, hindus, etc...) nobody truly knows. They only "believe" that they do. I'm an agnostic - I can admit that I don't really know and I don't let blind faith in a (man-made) religion control my thinking. IMO people invented religion to explain the unknown.<br>  <br>  Honestly speaking, I hope that there is something after death and that there is a higher being that we can connect with...one that won't throw me into "hell" for not praying to him. ;) But until someone comes back from the dead to tell us, we simply won't know.
pI5jKfmaaa	POMPEI<br>  Virtual Tour<br>  A Christian Perspective<br>  <br>  Copyright ? 2001 <br>  Michael S. Cole, M.D. <br>  <br>  <br>        It is my opinion that Pompeii is the most important archeological site anywhere. Almost every other ancient urban site is simply the remains of a ghost town, long ago deserted by its citizens who carried away with them everything of value. Prior to the eruption of Vesuvius, Pompeii was a thriving city. Then it was buried with so little warning in 79 A.D. that Pompeii was literally frozen in time. <br>         If we want to know details about what life was like in a Roman city during the first century, I think by studying Pompeii we can get the very best perspective with the least speculation. We can understand how the privileged rich man and the ordinary slave lived from day to day in the Roman Empire during the time when Christianity was beginning to spread throughout the Mediterranean. A better understanding of life in Pompeii, a city with both Roman and Greek influence, can help us to better understand many of the writings of the New Testament. <br>  <br>        Thanks to the United States Navy, I was stationed near Pompeii in the mid-1980's. My wife Jeannie and I visited the ruins of that ancient city many times. Our first tour was conducted by Tony d'Ambrosio, then a professor of archeology at the University of Naples, now the director of excavation at Pompei. After studying everything I could find about Pompeii, I served as an amateur guide for many friends and relatives. <br>  <br>        The slide show and commentary provided here will give you a glimpse of what you would see and learn if I could personally escort you around the streets, villas, temples, theaters, baths, shops, and forum of Pompeii. As a bonus, I've also included photos of many items from the National Archeological Museum of Naples where most of the treasures of Pompeii are housed. If you're interested, you should check out some of the many books and Web sites from which you can learn lots more than I'll be sharing with you here. <br>  <br>        If you're planning to visit Pompeii, perhaps this virtual tour will help prepare you for what you will experience there. If you've already been to Pompeii, maybe you'll learn something new from my perspectives. If you're likely to never make it to see Pompeii for yourself, I truly hope your time spent at this Web site will educate, enlighten, and inspire you.

OMJTZprXaa	NO we can never be greater than God in any way.<br>  <br>  We are not God. If we were God, we would not have any questions. This is a very important point. Do not buy into such philosophies that tell you you are God. We need to realise our position as a fragmental portion of spirit soul of God. We have the same qualities, but God is infinite, we are infinitesimal. A speck of Gold has the same qualities as a Gold nugget, but it is different in quantity. <br>  <br>  In the Bhagavadgita As It Is - by A.C. Bhaktivedhanta Swami Prabhupada, God is described as having the characteristic of "All Renunciation". He is perfectly renounced. So, No we can never be more renounced than God. No<br>  <br>  Read the Bagavadgita As It Is - by A.C. Bhaktivedhanta Swami Prabhupada for perfect  instructions for all philosophical inquiry. This will save much time. We cannot reach the ultimate truth by philosophical enquiry. Instead we need to become devotees and God, and surrender to Him completely. <br>  <br>  Your question is about detachment.<br>  <br>  In regards to this: You should be equipoised between: 1.Honour and dishonour; 2. Happiness and distress; & 3.Success and Failure.<br>  <br>  This is the description in the Bhagavadgita.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, you should be attached to God. Do not just try to be detached from your pain, instead, try to devote all your activities to God. When you suffer, be aware that God has delivered this suffering so do not deny it in any way.<br>  <br>  You should only care about things that help you to love God more - ie -spiritual things, not material things. But do not become dead & cold or apathetic, this is not the right idea.|`|D3rw1C8faa	How could God be indifferent if he gave his son to die for your sins?  How could he be indifferent if he allowed a book to be written giving you everything you need to know to live a happy, fruitful, productive life?  He gave you a world in which to live and supplied you with all the food and liquid your body needs to survive.  He gave others so that you would not be lonely.  He gave you a magnificent brain so that you could make rational decisions. <br>  What makes you thing he is still alive?  Maybe he died millions of years ago and this world is continuing until it runs out of steam.  Maybe by God creating this universe (and who knows what else might have been created by him) he was alive just long enough to see that we would eventually end up killing ourselves (each other) and that along with violence and pollution that perhaps he knew it to be inevitable that this world would eventually cease to be.|`|XxDQGEalaa	I think if you really didn't care, you wouldn't invest so much time and energy in a fantasy character.|`|ssK4oJi9aa	indifference is stupid because it necessarily excludes happiness. the buddhist emphasis on release from suffering is misguided because we need suffereing in order to feel pain. yin and yang. without the existence of suffering there can be no happiness and without happiness no suffering. the middle path is a path of quasi non-existence as in dead.|`|FoIxsunVaa	If you can be as compassionate, as ruthless, as judgmental and as concerned as the Old Testament God, the combination of all those emotions is also indifference.<br>  <br>  It is called being ABOVE THE FRAY.<br>  Actually now that you mention it, OT God is sort of partisan.

If you were asking for a basic or plausible meaning of life, then pretty much any answer would do, but you are asking for the "Meaning which is true for everybody.  So, you would have to strip away all the components of such an answer that will not be true for some people.  This immediately rules out God, since Buddhism, Islam, Taoism, and most pagan beliefs differ in their concept of God.  Christianity won't accept that, so you have excluded them entirely from your assessment of life just by excluding their notion of God.  Procreation cannot be considered in this question, because many who have children consider procreation to be what's wrong with their lives and therefore would exclude themselves from this component of life's meaning.  Are you beginning to see where this is going?  That's why Existentialism is so successful.  The true meaning of life, in this argument becomes nothing more than the efforts of preserving one's own existence--the mere act of breathing, drinking, eating and . . . the other end of the mastication process. Even the Cartesian maxim fails to apply here, since "Cogito ergo Sum" requires intelligence, and since "Ignorance is bliss," you cannot have happiness and existence in Descartes' world.  So there you have it.  "True" meaning in life is fairly empty.  It isn't good tho think about such things.

pI5jKfmaaa	Some say the split into an eastern and western empire governed by separate emperors caused Rome to fall. The eastern half became the Byzantine Empire, with its capital at Constantinople (modern Istanbul). The western half remained centered in Italy. Many say the Fall of Rome was an ongoing process, lasting more than a century. Since Rome still exists, it is argued that it never fell. Some prefer to say that Rome adapted rather than fell. [For some more details, see Decline of Rome.] A related question, one subject to even more discussion is:<br>  <br>  Why did Rome Fall?<br>  There are adherents to single factors, but more people think a combination of such factors as Christianity, decadence, lead, monetary trouble, and military problems caused the Fall of Rome. Even the rise of Islam is proposed as the reason for Rome's fall, by some who think the Fall of Rome happened at Constantinople in A.D. 1453. <br>  Theories on the Fall of Rome<br>  Historians of the Fall of Rome<br>  The first major historian to deal with the decline and Fall of Rome was the 5th century historian Zosimus, but the best-known name connected with the Fall of Rome is Edward Gibbon. Historians of ancient Rome have long been fascinated with the fall of this powerful empire. Recently there has been a spate of books explaining it:<br>  Fall of Rome History - Recommended Books<br>  The Decline and Fall of Rome<br>  The Roman Empire not only expanded but was modified by the conquered people. The structure of the Roman government changed to deal with new situations -- including moving the capital away from the city of Rome -- but not necessarily enough. <br>  Alaric and the Fall of Rome in A.D. 410<br>  Articles on the End of the Roman Empire<br>  The Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire Volume 1 Chapter, by Edward Gibbon<br>  The Extent of the Empire at the Time of the Fall of Rome<br>  Take a look at the maps to see the changing area of the Roman Empire. Rome started out as a small settlement in the middle of the Italian boot. By the time it was an empire, it looked completely different. Some of the theories on the Fall of Rome focus on the geographic diversity and extent of the territory the Roman emperors had to control.<br>  Rome and Roman Empire Maps<br>  In its more than a thousand years of history, Rome spread from what was once a single small settlement on the Tiber. First Roma spread to the surrounding territory, then all of Italy, and finally the Roman Empire covered most of western Europe, north Africa, Greece, and Asia Minor. <br>  <br>  Reference Map of the European Provinces of the Roman Empire<br>  <br>  From The Historical Atlas by William R. Shepherd, 1911.<br>  More Images (3)From its early days as a monarchy, through the Republic and the Roman Empire, Rome lasted a millennium ... or two. Those who opt for two millennia date the Fall of Rome to 1453 when the Ottoman Turks took Byzantium (Constantinople). Those who opt for one millennium, agree with Roman historian Edward Gibbon. Edward Gibbon dated the Fall to September 4, A.D. 476 when a so-called barbarian named Odoacer (a Germanic leader in the Roman army), deposed the last western Roman emperor, Romulus Augustulus, who was probably partly of Germanic ancestry. Odoacer considered Romulus so paltry a threat he didn't even bother to assassinate him, but sent him into retirement.*<br>  At the time of the coup and for the two preceding centuries, there had been two emperors of Rome. One lived in the east, usually in Constantinople. The other lived in the west. The emperor whom Odoacer deposed had lived in Ravenna, Italy. Afterwards, there was still one Roman emperor, Zeno, who lived in Constantinople. Odoacer became the first barbarian king of the western empire. <br>  <br>  While this bloodless coup in 476 is a frequently accepted date for the Fall of Rome and the beginning of the Middle Ages, it was not, at the time, a major turning point. Many events and tendencies led up to it and there were many people who continued to think of themselves and who continue to be thought of as Romans. <br>  <br>  The following is a list of features on this site related to the end of the Roman Empire and the Fall of Rome. This includes theories about the Fall of Rome (including lead) and several of the Roman emperors whose actions hastened the end of the Roman Empire in the West. There is a section with information on important men whose origins were far from the city of Rome. <br>  <br>  Causes of the Fall of Rome<br>  Theories on the Fall of Rome<br>  Non-Romans With an Impact on the Fa|`|BTk2yLqbaa	The main cause of Roman decline was internal. What it all boiled down to was that the latter Romans, particularly in the West, no longer cared about the Empire enough to go all out to save it, as the original Romans had always done. People say the Empire fell because of barbarian invasions, civil wars, corruption etc. Rome had ALWAYS faced deadly foreign invaders; Hannibal was a far more formidable opponent than any third-fifth century barbarian, or probably just as effective as any of them. Likewise, assasinations, civil wars and monetary trouble, even plagues, had occurred long befoe the third-fifth centuries. The difference is that the original Romans always were motivated to do what they had to to cope; the latter citizens were not. Te decline of motivation was due to reduced identification with Rome. The new, christian population had long been persecuted and could not be counted upon to go all out to save the Empire. This was especially true in the West where the church was strongest. Likewise, the late Empire had many barbarian settlers, and soldiers, who did not really relate to it much; they couldn't be counted upon much either.|`|BVbDNm23aa	The Roman Empire stopped expanding, infighting weakened the economy and military, and auxiliaries were being used more than legionaries. Also a series of weak emperors, and a corrupt Praetorian guard who kept assassinating Emperors and giving the Empire to the highest bidder.<br>  <br>   The Legionaries were also becoming more loyal to their Generals than to the Emperor. Combine this with hoards of barbarians eager for conquest and you have a collapsing and deteriorating Empire. <br>  <br>  The main reasons i think were responsible were, that one Emperor couldn't realistically rule such a large Empire efficiently unless they were very competent, weak Emperors destroyed what strong Emperors had built. <br>  <br>  I also think if Germanicus had survived and become Emperor, the Roman Empire would have lasted much longer, and become much bigger. Read the book Blood of the Caesars, by Stephen Dando-Collins, if you haven't already, it gives a very good explanation into this period of the Roman Empire.<br>  <br>  The Roman Army was not Weak, it was the finest fighting force in the world for hundreds of years. It is i think one of the most successful military in human history. In Britain, for example a Roman force of around 10,000 men held off and defeated a force of 200,000 + Britons led by Boadicea, with 400 casualty's and killed approx 80,000, that's having a kill ratio of 200/1 in a battle with 20 times their number. <br>  <br>  That kill ratio is about the same as the Navy Seals in Vietnam. The Roman Soldier could march 25-30 miles a day with a 90 pound pack in almost any weather, then set up a fortified camp in the dark. Of course this is at the Empires height, but you get the picture. <br>  <br>  The Roman Army was not weak, but it was gradually replaced by a basically mercenary army of Auxiliaries, and the Roman Army, and its training and discipline that had won the Empire, faded away until it had lost its true identity and its successes faded with it.|`|A9MGo10daa	One was the how the government didn't cooperate about governing Rome. They were more interested in surrounding themselves in luxury than putting Rome first. Rome's political system failed and eventually the citizens of Rome lost faith and loyalty in the government.<br>  <br>  Another was how Rome's army got weaker and weaker from different invasions from a whole bunch of, well, invaders, not to mention how the army was disinterested in the government because, like said, of its lack of ruling. The main ones were the Germanic tribes, Slavs, Huns, and Visigoths.<br>  <br>  Before, Rome kept conquering and conquering and conquering new lands to tax. because the army wasn't really interested, they could not get as much taxes as they got before. So, instead, they raised the taxes of those already in Roman territory, so citizens became unloyal, poor, and hungry.<br>  <br>  Now, as you can see, all these reasons were able to tie in together and in some way sort of connect. So it wasn't just one thing. It was many things that "made a big pot of Roman-Falling stew".(Metaphorically speaking!)|`|30R7gIXtaa	some thing was pushing the tribes from the east<br>  rome in lots of ways was an accidental empire, it never had an effective tax system to support a large enough army<br>  so i would say its beaucratics systems were not good enough<br>  <br>  if you go to the roman forum there arnt government buildings per say, the was no real bureaucracy to support the empire, so the government wasn't big enough for effective administration|`|C4knGt7Iaa	Greed|`|waSOgHroaa	The changing demographics of Roman society, Romans removing themselves from military and civic duty in the later stages, crippling taxes imposed by emperors on citizens that were already impoverished just to support a huge and innefficient army, changing of the Roman military setup...later era legionarries were no comparison to Caesars due to the increasing barbarianization of the army, overextended borders and finally Christianity.|`|7794b0c8c949bf5a0269d9e615b01f73aa	over expansion Rome didn't have weak military Rome just didnt have a big enough one

LVpyaf48aa	a photographer who creates a work of art using his talent and tools (camera etc) first asks one basic question.<br>  <br>  is this for profit?<br>  <br>  if the answer is no, then cost is not an obstacle because the best model for the job may be a supermodel or may be a nobody. its all about the art and the cost to produce it is irrelevant.<br>  <br>  if the answer is yes, then a budget is proffered that fits a specific profit/loss ratio. the best model for the job is not necessarily the one who will make the best art but the one who will work for the amount of money allocated in the budget.<br>  <br>  but I think you may be asking if more experienced models are worth more than inexperienced ones. the answer to that question is.... sometimes. <br>  <br>  models with no experience posing nude are often nervous and that emotion shows in the final photo. but I have worked with very experienced models who could not follow simple directions with two hands and a flashlight. very experienced models can also sometimes fall into the 'diva' category and if you dont remove all the green gourmet m-n-m's from the bowl and make sure they have an endless supply of their top ten favorite starbucks drinks on hand then at best they will be unhappy, pouty, and not at all interested in working with the photographer to complete the project (try having that emotion show in your final piece of art) and at worst will walk away from the project leaving the rest of the team in a lurch to find another model and reschedule the shoot.<br>  <br>  the best you can do is answer the for profit question and if paying a model is required, negotiate a rate that makes everyone happy.

Parker, a tall Canadian girl who prefers smoking and listening to records to playing sports, and Chase, a South Carolina good old boy, become unlikely bedfellows--in a sense. They even end up in Mal Pais, Costa Rica--a playland of surfers and hedonists--for a week. Their alliance is threatened by a ghost of sorts--an expelled girl in a blue coat who shows up again on campus one spring day.

The most remarkable administrative feat of the Middle Ages, the survey was carried out, against popular resentment, by panels of commissioners who compiled accounts of the estates of the king and his tenants. As summarized in the Domesday Book, it now serves as the starting point for the history of most English towns and villages.

BMxNOJ39aa	705 people were saved among 1,316 passengers and 891 crew. Twenty lifeboats (this includes 4 collapsibles) were launched. Some of the boats were cast adrift and some recovered. Lifeboat number 6 "came back" in that the crew attempted to return to the sinking to rescue survivors.<br>  <br>  Some of the remains recovered were interned in Canada.

In the accounts of people swimming in the water, only one lifeboat returned to look for live people floating about of the 20 nearby--not that only 1 boat of people ever were seen again. The lifeboats were discovered by a boat responding to the Titanic's SOS call came soon after the sinking and took everyone aboard from the lifeboats.<br>  <br>  Q2. I don't think that the Titanic is located in an area too presurrized, as there are many surviving artifacts intact.

fbd87c7846199694ba9130c99b6e261caa	On average an assistant to an agent makes a salary in the 30,000 range but that varies a great deal. I have known assistants who were making 9 an hour and I have known ones on salary. You are talking about some of the bigger agencies so you potentially would be looking at about 600 per week but know those jobs are hard to get and usually you start off interning without pay before you work your way up to assistant unless you already have quite a bit of experience under your belt. <br>  <br>  Although the pay would be less you might be better off starting with a smaller agency where as an intern or assistant you would have a greater opportunity to get some hands on experience.|`|S01zIagOaa	It varies depending on the agency you work for and the particular agent you are assisting.  I knew someone at Endeavor a few years ago, he was around $24,000 I think. He lasted about half a year before washing out. The attrition rate for agent's assistants is VERY high.

b412254e11519aaa92cbe9efe511c454aa	Lots of people. Lots of people who have been to a lot of other auditions, in other words, professional audition attendees. They've probably told you to bring in something in your 'key' with music for an accompanist, they'll also probably give you something to perform...especially if you make 'the cuts' which are to be expected, along the way. Though, they'll probably teach you a combo, and weed out the non dancers first....but i guess it depends on what you're auditioning for....expect at least one 'cut' and expect a lot of drama....and if you're there long enough, tears. In the end, expect a lot of competition, expect well seasoned, very talented singers and dancers many who were '1 away' from the cut last year, if you want to survive this kind of environment, expect to learn from what you see others do...or 'not do'. If you don't succeed with Disney this time, make sure there is another time...and learn from this experience for next time. They can be nasty and seem mean; they don't really but I have seen that kind of thing when someone repeated the audition year after year...and the 'judge' thought it was best to tell them so they could best manage their expectations.  It's a tough, but fun experience, especially if you get a job....but if you don't it will make you better, and a little bit tougher....and that's what it takes. Best of luck. i couldn't do it again.....|`|YzS16M9daa	Here is a few audition pointers:<br>  1. You need to be prepared for everything.<br>  2.

Learn from the experience<br>  7. Don't trust the other auditionees (unless the audition is group work)<br>  8. Have a good night sleep before<br>  9. Eat a good breakfast<br>  10. Think of the outcome of this if you get the part! (this will motavate you!)<br>  Goooooood Luck and I hope you go far! XD

Rager <br>  <br>  The Tiger and the Zebra <br>  <br>  The tiger phoned the zebra<br>  and invited him to dine.<br>  He said "If you could join me<br>  that would simply be divine."<br>  The zebra said "I thank you,<br>  but respectfully decline.<br>  I heard you ate the antelope;<br>  he was a friend of mine."<br>  <br>  On hearing this the tiger cried<br>  "I must admit it's true!<br>  I also ate the buffalo,<br>  the llama and the gnu.<br>  And yes I ate the warthog,<br>  the gazelle and kangaroo,<br>  but I could never eat a creature<br>  beautiful as you.<br>  <br>  "You see I have a secret<br>  I'm embarrassed to confide:<br>  I look on you with envy<br>  and a modicum of pride.<br>  Of all the creatures ever known,"<br>  the tiger gently sighed,<br>  "It seems we are the only two<br>  with such a stripy hide.<br>  <br>  "Now seeing how we share this<br>  strong resemblance of the skin,<br>  I only can conclude that we are<br>  just as close as kin.<br>  This means you are my brother<br>  and, though fearsome I have been,<br>  I could not eat my brother,<br>  that would surely be a sin."<br>  <br>  The zebra thought, and then replied<br>  "I'm certain you are right.<br>  The stripy coats we both possess<br>  are such a handsome sight!<br>  My brother, will you let me<br>  reconsider if I might?<br>  My calendar is empty so<br>  please let us dine tonight."<br>  <br>  The tiger met the zebra in<br>  his brand-new fancy car<br>  and drove him to a restaurant<br>  which wasn't very far.<br>  And when they both were seated<br>  at a table near the bar,<br>  the zebra asked "What's on the grill?"<br>  The tiger said "You are."<br>  <br>  "But please, you cannot dine on me!"<br>  the outraged zebra cried.<br>  "To cook me up and eat me<br>  is a thing I can't abide.<br>  You asked me for your trust<br>  and I unwarily complied.<br>  You said you could not eat me<br>  now you plan to have me fried?"<br>  <br>  "And what about the envy<br>  and the modicum of pride?<br>  And what of us as brothers<br>  since we share a stripy hide?"<br>  "I'm sorry," said the tiger<br>  and he smiled as he replied,<br>  "but I love the taste of zebra<br>  so, in other words, I lied."<br>  <br>  --Kenn Nesbitt|`|TTgLTMpDaa	Look through Roald Dahls poetry - hilarious stuff, generally.

qThmcR1Aaa	One of the best autobiographies I've ever read is "Where White Men Fear to Tread," by Russell Means. It gives a sobering perspective of what it meant to grow up as an Indian (he doesn't say "Native American," and neither do I) in a nation that had a history of breaking promises and forcing people off their traditional lands. Means tells a story of how he refused to let his spirit be broken, and how he spoke out against the government -- sometimes in very shocking ways. His goal in protesting was to draw attention to the plight of the American Indian, and he certainly succeeded. Some Indians find him a hero for what he did, and others are angry with him. Either way, he brought something to the nation's consciousness that we may otherwise have never heard about. <br>  <br>  Highly recommended read.|`|uth8Ztbdaa	Running With Scissors by Augusten Burroughs (funny and not very long)<br>  <br>  Capote by Gerald Clarke (about the author Truman Capote who wrote Breakfast at Tiffany's)<br>  <br>  Georgiana: Duchess of Devonshire by Amanda Foreman (movie was made based on this biography title "The Duchess" and starring Kiera Knightly)|`|G4BSv4jbaa	Excellence: Sons of Xavier Forever - George Brennan, Jr.|`|Vm0iVpYPaa	Kerry Katona's is really good and there is alot of info in there!!!<br>  <br>  Good |Luck xxx|`|1l74hQL3aa	A Long walk to Freedom  by Nelson Mandela|`|5ae0627320d71f72055a25e93fb7784caa	I got my Mum Julie Walter's autobiography and she really enjoyed it.

zhsTxqGxaa	Propaganda is "advertising" to go to war.  An example of propaganda used today is Uncle Sam.  If people didn't go to the war, they felt like cowards.  If people did join the war, they regret it and have a strong urge to go home and see their families.|`|shVgCizBaa	Propaganda Postcards<br>  of the Great War <br>  Introduction.<br>  The site features a collection of war-themed postal cards produced during World War 1 (1914 - 1919).  More than 2,500 cards will eventually be displayed in an organized fashion. The cards are mementos of a world at war during the second decade of the 20th century. <br>  This web-site has been established to provide a tool to students, researchers and postcard collectors with an interest in the period of  World War One in general or "Great War" propaganda in particular. <br>  These cards are historical artifacts which are not only often beautiful examples of the lithographers art but are also of interest to students of art, military and political history. The site is a creation of two individuals who bring a combined total of 50 years experience as amateur historians  and active collectors. All of the cards pictured in the site are authentic originals. The site is itself a "work in progress" and it will be so for some time!  A significant number of cards are "rare" from a collector's viewpoint and we therefore hope that this increases both the usefulness and interest. We thank you for looking.

German propaganda organizations such as the German Literary Defense Committee distributed over a million pamphlets during 1914 stressing their strength and will. Allied propaganda called on historical ties and exploited German atrocities, both real and alleged. Despite all the attempted influence, the propaganda made little difference to America's public opinion. Ties of heritage, trade and the course of the war, not propaganda, decided the American position.  Answer <br>  Propaganda was a popular tool used in WW1 to change the opinions of the masses. Most propaganda was negative and/or misleading and lead to feelings of anger or sadness by using blackmail and over-exaggeration. Propaganda is thought to have helped the war effort by getting people to support the war by doing things such as buying war bonds. The effects of WW1 propaganda are still around today aiding many of the very strong opinions harbored by many. Propaganda was used during the war to influence the public on the home front and boost moral. At the beginning of the war it was used to encourage the fact that the enemies were evil and also to boost enlistment figures. <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_did_propaganda_influence_World_War_1" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/How_did_propag...</a>
