MKtiALuXaa	Yes Salt Lick is Cash only they have an ATM Machine there but I think it costs like 5 bucks to use it or something stupid like that. I think most dinner plates run around $12-$13-Bucks! It's pretty cheap<br>  <br>  The food is great, the people are fun and yes the wait staff both men and woman are hot! <br>  <br>  Also it is BYOB So don't forget your ice chest. <br>  Salt lick is like the best picnic in the world Great food and all you have to do is bring the beer. During the summer they usually have live music while you wait. Oh man save a seat for me I think I'll join ya!|`|AA11266853	Truthfully The Salt lick did not do much for me. maybe i hit them on a bad day. Plus its out in Drftwood, little driving.<br>  <br>  My take on other BBQ Joints....<br>  <br>  Rudy's: Meats OK, sausage just so so, they do have good sauce.<br>  Stubbs: Good meat, good sausage.<br>  Ironworks BBQ: Very nice meat and sausage. Very busy<br>  Green mesquite: Good smokey flavor on everything.<br>  Arts Rib House: verrated ribs<br>  County line: Best beef ribs anywhere! Good all round 'cue<br>  The Pit BBQ - An austin classic, good prices and not bad 'cue either.<br>  Sam's BBQ - A lesser known BBQ joint in east austin, great sausage, and good 'cue. Very small place but very mom and pop.<br>  <br>  If your up to a drive, try these<br>  <br>  Kreutz(Lockhart) Awesome! Worth the drive. I miss their old location but still puting out great food. No plates, just butcher paper. old school.<br>  Blacks BBQ (Lockhart) Also awesome! Near Kreutz's, hit both places! <br>  Coopers (Llano) So so brisket but their smoked ribeye was awesome. and decent sausage. their sauce for their meet was too thin and vingary.<br>  Mueller's (Taylor) Most excellent, good prices too. Sauce to die for.<br>  <br>  <br>  Blah...(BBQ for those who just want some semblance of BBQ)<br>  Bill Miller<br>  Pok-e-Jo's|`|4bedkpvLaa	Rolling Bones<br>  377 Edgewood Ave SE<br>  Atlanta, GA 30312<br>  <br>  (404) 222-2324?<br>  rollingbonesbbq.com|`|Aw61EdOvaa	Oh Dude!

I love it, it is so good!  I'd bring about $50 if you plan on drinking.  Its pretty moderately priced, about $15 or so a plate.|`|750114d15c8548fd7799c30eb4760991aa	It is BYOB - they have an on-premise license but do not sell alcohol.<br>  <br>  Family style is $18.95 per person and it's a lot of food.  Plates are $11.95 and $12.95 so it won't set you back too far.
AaXl3vcCaa	they run out because alot of people order them, there are only so many deep fryers in there and how many people do you think order them at lunch time? i personally would rather wait and get fries that i know are fresh, i think its worse to get soggy fries then wait for fresh delicious ones :)|`|40f9996319d13867c4bbea47b436ef3aaa	I never have to wait for fries.

HA8Ehs3Gaa	I don't believe you should have paid that because it was they're mistake. I had something similar happen at a burger king and the manager aggreed to pay the mistake. The manager at the resturant should have paid for it, not you|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	You should pay the menu price of the item that you ordered.  If the item you ordered cost $5.00, you should pay $5.00.  Not $3, not $7.    Better yet...leave and go eat at some place local that's not a chain.|`|ksoMldqYaa	Don't do anything, you wanted a monster burger and you got it.  You were planning on paying full price for it when you went in there, so what's the big deal?  Yes, they made a mistake and probably should have let the price difference slide but like I said you had all intentions of paying that price from the get go, so you're not out anything.|`|hKyOUVXIaa	These are tough times and nobody gets anything for less.  I guess they feel like that even though they made the mistake, they're better off to tell you that you made the mistake and now must pay for what you want. It's kind of like if you went to a car lot, bought a Hyundai, then brought it back and demanded a Lexus for the price you paid for the Hyundai.      The Hardees people didn't believe you, and based on how many people lie with a straight face these days, I'm not sure you can blame them.  So I guess you could either have eaten your chicken or paid for the burger.|`|AA11759382	Well, you have a responsibility too.  You should have a good idea how much everything should cost and with a 2.23 price difference, I would have said are you sure you got my order right?  did they even read your order back to you?  They have to go with what's on the receipt.  if they only charged you for the chicken, then they have to charge the difference.  Pay attention next time.|`|FCKdRZd1aa	If you ask me poor customer service if i was you and you were that upset about the incident i would find a 1-800 number they sould have one for questions and comments or they might have on their website where it says contact us or something on there website im sure u just put in the store number tell them what happened and never know they might mail u coupons or something if u put in a address witch they might have you do.|`|eua5YYYcaa	Sorry to say this but let it go...I think they should have given it to you just for good will, but what can you do?  Forget about it!|`|NITJ2A0Saa	Let it slide. Yes, it was their mistake in the first place. But if they hadn't made that mistake you would be paying the $2.23 difference anyway.
uSeApMt9aa	Try fire and ice in harvard square (boston) good priced, a little romantic. You get your food at a food bar and bring it to the chefs. They cook it in front of you. Great food too.|`|ncojw5ttaa	If you want a little romance and some good Italian food, head to the North End. Try MASSIMINO'S.

It's also bigger, with dim, romantic lighting and a very relaxed atmosphere.<br>  <br>  I think that the North End is overly touristy, but a lot of people enjoy the restaurants there too.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|W2JUHdSfaa	The Fireplace<br>  <a href="http://www.fireplacerest.com/menus/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fireplacerest.com/menus/</a><br>  <br>  also Johnny D's in Davis Square<br>  you take the red line and get off at davis and its right across from the movie theater<br>  never been for dinner before, but on saturdays they have brunches played by a jazz guitarist<br>  its a  nice place to have breakfast, and you get a lot of food. the staffs very nice and the musics good|`|KChldumraa	whenever i think romance, i think italian:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.menuism.com/restaurants/cbfQiWjROr245yabBlKsEs-grotto-boston-ma" rel="nofollow">http://www.menuism.com/restaurants/cbfQi...</a><br>  <br>  Grotto is worth a try. they have an extensive and interesting wine selection and fantastic, authentic spread of dishes. tips: order the fondue, and don't skip dessert.|`|tsLHAD5raa	Boston means italian food.<br>  The best places in the City are:<br>  Giacomo's [locations in south end and north end]<br>  AND<br>  Via Matta (downtown)|`|eGtxoXKUaa	American Joe's !

lys5kB9Daa	its pretty amazing steak. my work brought us there for christmas and it was expensive. a regular steak cost $40 and a bigger one or with toppings (onions, etc) about $50. and that does NOT include any sides- just the steak. the side dishes come meant for 2-3 people so dont each order 2 sides! the sides are about $8-10. appetizers are a complete waste we got the stuffed mushrooms and an order of scallops and they each came with 4 pieces for $10. but if you love steak and have the money i would recommend it :)|`|NrvrH4zQaa	The steaks are excellent.  You will likely spend $75 - $100 per person, including tip.  I've been to Ruth's Chris restaurants in both San Antonio and Tampa.|`|JrC2KGOQaa	We've eaten in the Philadelphia RC several times and it's always been good.

aw2xkdSbaa	It sounds like he's a caring guy. Next time you go out, suggest something else for him off the menu that is not a salad. See what his reaction is. You could also insist on paying half the check, or treating him once in awhile.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	Usually it's the other way around. You got to hope that at least he'll stay thin that way.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	he really wants a steak|`|ygGr1nX7aa	It's impossible for us to know better than you do what's going on in his head.

Don't complicate simple things.|`|8ea4731a729b705912f2536fb0cd0430aa	I would just get what you want. Eating a salad isn't a given that you chose a meal with less calories. Some salads are higher in fat than a burger or a burrito for example. He may be ordering a salad because  he wants to make sure he has enough money or he just likes salad.  It could be that he is not comfortable eating steak or lobster in crowds.|`|5vT3UDYaaa	If he says get whatever you want then do it! Well actually even if he didnt say that I'd still get whatever because he's the one taking you out and shouldn't regulate what you eat. Second, I think he just likes salad. My boyfriends fav. dish at this Thai restaurant is a salad dish sooo I dunno..But eat what ever you are craving and def dont feel bad about it! If he ever says anything just say " your the weird one for only ordering salads at amazing restaurants!" haha :)

The "heart" sweetbreads are more spherical in shape, and surrounded symmetrically by the "throat" sweetbreads".    If you read-up on it you'll also find most of these Dishes that are NOW sometimes called Delicacies were originally "Poor Peasant" food.....the Irony of it is almost laughable!  Pizza is also one. The Peasants were so poor they would roll out BREAD dough, which was plentiful, and put Tomato sauce and cheese on it and cook it.
