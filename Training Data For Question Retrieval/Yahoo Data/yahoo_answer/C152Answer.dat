qStmw7qgaa	Water would be my first suggestion, also certain veggies will make his urine smell.|`|DDIBEvUTaa	more water & dilute his juice. can u get him to pee in the potty? if so is his urine dark or cloudy?|`|afc692e37eb08c220509639ca2e1a9f5aa	You should try giving him more water if that doesnt work take him to see a doctor.|`|mlT1ZrZtaa	DRINK MORE WATER   if it persits call the doctor  to get rid of the smell i surgest oust|`|qHAgbuHkaa	First of all, juice is good in moderation, but too much is not good. Its sugary and can lead to tooth decay and it adds unnecessary calories to his diet. My son is 22 months as well (turns 2 on April 23rd) and he gets a cup of juice for breakfast, and a cup of milk with lunch and dinner, but the rest of the day, its just good ole healthy water. If it continues, take him in to see if he has a bladder infection.|`|Zof09ZWJaa	He needs to drink more water. Too much juice is not always good. Once he starts getting more water in his system, his urine will start to have less of an odor.  Your body needs water to keep your organs functioning properly. Juice even 100% juice has sugar in it and too much is not good.
phwivaqNaa	Yes, through your whole pregnancy.  Some women more than others.  I am 40 weeks today and have had to wear panty liners most of the time.    Good job going to the doctor, even with the negative.  You want to make sure everything it ok and you are healthy either way.|`|0k5hixiWaa	discharge is normal in pregnancy and i think esp in the beginning as your cervical mucus is being formed....|`|wzXJOSIeaa	Lots and lots of discharge comes along with pregnancy.|`|6L4fCcyGaa	yes|`|4XfjUcvDaa	i had discahrge, and thought that it was my period coming along, but it wasnt.|`|duinadV4aa	yes|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	u mean discharge? when ur pregnant u tend to have a lot of that so that's not really an indicator eithe rway|`|kT7GVOosaa	yes. you will have the white stuff during the whole pregnancy|`|DTg3USppaa	you can get a yeast infection easy even if you are pregnant, but if you are having a leak as though you had began/finished your period, I would have that checked out. I didn't find out I was pregnant until I was 6wks pregnant. You really have to rely on those pregnancy test with a grain of salt. Go see your doctor...they are gentle! :)|`|xfZWmPJPaa	oh boy,   do you ever.  LOL|`|kQC4HX6vaa	Yes, and A LOT.|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	you even have discharge if you're not pregnant so that is not a good indicator of pregnancy. the only for sure way is a positive test so just wait until your dr app and find out that way.|`|8mLJJVGhaa	Yes you do, it could be to do with hormones either way x|`|jLNwrVZRaa	Yes, it is common to have a discharge while you are pregnant.  It will most likely get heavier as you get towards the end of your pregnancy.  It helps to keep everything clean in there as well.  I had that while I was pregnant and it can get very annoying!|`|k1dUerzVaa	you think thats bad wait until you find  out what a mucus plug is|`|rFMRgHTdaa	i dont remember to be honest but i have experienced cysts in my ovaries which cause my period to not come.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	Yes that is normal. You can also be missing your period because you are stressing out. Try to relax.
DdKsz5A8aa	Curiousity is definately a good thing! and yes you should wait til your done with the traveling to get him into full on potty training however, it will take time so putting a little time aside to sit in the on potty to get used to it would be just fine, and highly recomended.     I suggest using the new pampers pull ups that get cold when the child wets them, the feel helps them realize when they are going "potty" and etc.    Definately let him expereience with the potty and when you are home and settled set him on the potty frequently and within 10 - 15 minutes after eating and drinking.    Also positive reinforcement! stickers - charts anything!!  :) Good Luck!!|`|jhFuwR7Jaa	ONE THING I TRIED WITH MY SON IS SING A POTTY SONG OR TAKING HIM TO THE BATHROOM WHEN YOU GO ANOTHER THING BUY HIM A DOLL OR TEDDY BEAR THE SIZE OF HIM AND SITTING IT ON THE POT THEN HE WILL START TO DO THE SAME WHEN HE SEE SOMEONE OR THING DO THE SAME KIDS DO WHAT THEY SEE|`|m2aznd8xaa	i have a 20 month old and is fully trained.once your child is 18 months and is showing signs of readyness thats the best time to start. my 9 year old was potty trained by 17 months she learned much quicker ,each child is different. i use pull ups only for night time and outings for just in case. but i prefered undies because baby will hate feeling wet when they have there accidents and tend to catch on qiucker. the sooner the better.and its best to wait til your done with all the moving around too. youll have more time to focus on the whole potty training business and it will be less stressful on both of you. good luck and the trick is once you start dont go back to diapes no matter how frustrating at times .  pull ups do feel to much like diapers so use them wisely. just stick to it. and give lots of praise and dont forget those stickers as a reward for going potty.|`|z7a9F4HNaa	there are good tips here o potty trainig http://www.learning-graph.com/teachingdi...|`|vue9NOhYaa	22 months is still pretty young for potty training. Few kids are ready/able before they are 2.      So I would definitely wait until at LEAST after the end of this month. And then, if you try and he isn't  interested or ready (potty training goes quickly when a child IS ready,so don't think you will need to be at it for many months/years), then just go back to diapers.  "Watching you flush" isn't really a sign of readiness.     I would recommend naked training. Let him just run around bare for a few days.   If he IS ready, he'll catch on pretty quickly, and you can then go to regular undies, though he'll certainly have the occassional accident.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	training pants is what u should use first,also i  think u should start training him now even if you r traveling,u can always make a pit stop to see if he has to go potty|`|pwdgRBtLaa	well my twins are going to be 2 in a few weeks, they have shown signs of being interested in using the potty, they sit in theyre play kitchen sink pull their pants down and pretend to go to the bathroom then pretend to flush it, its pretty funny. but my mom told me to buy a kiddie potty so they get used to the feel of it, and every so often tell them oh its potty time and take them to the potty and let them pretend, and when they are ready they'll make the leap.   im trying to potty train mine to but ive just decided to wait it out until their speech gets a little better and since we travel plenty also it is easier for us if they just go in their diapers while we are driving across country & we can just stop every so often to change them.  i preferably like the pull ups that you can rip at the sides to take off, i think it makes them feel a bit more comfortable, my kinds wouldnt wear the underwear cause i guess it was tighter on them, i dont know.    if i were you, i would wait until the travel slows down, traveling from place to place and using different potties is hard for the young ones, some of them like the security of their own home, like my husband the anti-public bathroom guy, haha.    best of luck to you!
FCcbgriuaa	Yes headaches are related to pregnancy! I had them when i was!  Maybe you are wait to test! Good LUCK!|`|4DoXomHZaa	If you ovulated on the 31st, you'd be 3 days. The egg would not have even reached the uterus yet. You would have absolutely no symptoms yet.|`|2HETgiwgaa	It would be very early - almost certainly too early.  But, headaches are a symptom of pregnancy for some women.  I'd wait til AF is due or late then test - good luck and lots of baby dust :-)|`|tQAdImhZaa	Yes headaches is a symptom of being pregnant.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You can use cloth diaper pins to hold it on.    Or you can use iron on velcro, put the soft side on the seat and the hook side on the mirror using super glue.    Or you can use a locker mirror (plastic, non-breakable) and use an iron on patch over another magnet to hold the magnet to the seat.|`|A7SJT50Kaa	i'm not sure which one to get, just wanted to give you a warning that a  carseat inspector/police officer gave me about those things.    she said if you are in a car accident with one of those mirrors, baby's face can hit the mirror pretty easily and they get a lot of serious injuries from them.|`|AA11476782	We have this one by Fisher Price and I love it.  It looks like it can be used even without a headrest.  http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...|`|RNZaUdxSaa	Im pretty sure I have seen the ones that stick to the back windshield like with the suction cup! I would look around cause I know they have one for your situation|`|qYNCV6L1aa	They do. I have one by Fisher Price that I got from Walmart but I've seen Eddie Bauer ones at Target as well. Do you have the latches/hooks on the shelf behind the back seats (over the trunk)? The mirrors come with straps that fit around the latches and the mirror just kinda hangs forward enough so you can see baby through the rear view mirror. But your car has to have the latches for it to work.|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	I don't exactly have an answer for that one, but I'd love to find out. We tried getting one for my son when he was rear facing in my little Civic and I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to get that thing secure, so I just kept it in the front with me. It still came in handy over long trips when I was in the passenger seat and could sneak a peak into the back to see if he was sleeping or not. There must be a brand that works though.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I had the same problem, I bought this one. Don't let it's low rating bother you, all it needed was a little tape. It was a lifesaver!    http://www.target.com/Eddie-Bauer-Baby-B...|`|XOtHsTo0aa	We have the Rainforest one with the animals on it that lights up and plays music and rainforest sounds.  You can use it on the latch if you have one.|`|JP2h62qiaa	I have the same car. But an 05. I got the Fischer price rain forest mirror.  The one with out the toy bar on top of it. I had to have my husband get in the drivers seat and tell me when he would see the car set. LATCH it with the hook onto the back of the seat up top and then use the suction cups to hold it steady. You will have to suction it to the window....I tried the Eddie bower on first and it wouldn't work. This is the ONLY mirror I could get to work in my car.    I will try and find a link to the exact one for you.  http://www.target.com/gp/search/182-4303...    * It is the 4th mirror down.    The 3rd one down has these foam velco peics to attatch to your seat itself so you can just velcro the mirror to it. I used this for the first couple months but it got ripped off the velcro too easy.|`|AA10636233	I found this one at babies r us ==> http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp... it uses has several attachment options, including attaching to the tether hook that is set in most newer cars specifically for attaching car-seats! I also found this one  ==> http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp... with three attachments, and it says it works for middle seats or headrests both!
v2qZFS7maa	Hmm... I really don't believe you can get an answer by what your craving or eating. Its a mental thing, if you think/believe your pregnant than you are gonna convince yourself to eat un-ordinary things. And I believe cravings start a bit later in the pregnancy. But the best way to find out is a simple pregnancy test.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	Could be need to take a test!!!|`|SMy4P5Bxaa	Buy a home pregnancy test.  That's the best way to check this, and you could also go visit your doctor.
87WOSjwgaa	I had a TON of discharge! And cramping, I never had cramping with my periods before. I just somehow knew I was or figured that I was. I didnt want to jinx it so I never said I was. I was also naseous a lot. So all that let me know that I was. then I took a test just to confirm.|`|6L4fCcyGaa	i had cramping like i was coming on my period, but never did. the end of the month i felt like a was coming down with something|`|bAp35x7uaa	My main symptoms were.... no symptoms!    Let me explain - every month at ovulation, I'd get discomfort, cramps, bloating, nausea which would last until my period came.  The month I found out I was pregnant I had absolutely nothing.  I even posted a question on here about missing PMT and whether it was normal, LOL.    I did early tests though so found out a week before my period was due - so I was literally only about 7 days pregnant.    After then - at around 4-5 weeks - my cervical fluid became so copious I felt wet all the time - still do!  I was positive I'd gotten my period.  Also felt the cramps/twinges and backache that I'd normally get with a period.  Still get them at 14 weeks!  Apparently that doesn't stop - it's the baby growing and your uterus/ligaments stretching to accomodate.    Good luck and baby dust to you xxx|`|d6dzoHvvaa	I was extremely nauseous. I went home from work throwing up on 2 mondays in a row and then I took a test. I figured I was before I took a test but I think I just didn't want to believe it and the other main thing was my boobs, they hurt sometimes when I am about to start but this was like constant throbbing and if it was cold outside then they would hurt real bad. good luck.|`|b3CwObBdaa	I was ttc, but it was my hubby that thought something was up.  I tried to 'ignore' any sign and not read into it at all.  i was about two weeks late when he told me i was still pms'ing and to go take a test.  i was pregnant.  so, i guess my signs were basically the same signs as i would get during pms.  boobs, back ache, abdominal cramps, leg cramps, etc.|`|FplTPoAyaa	I was SUPER tired.  All I wanted to do was sleep. I also had problems fitting into my jeans...all of the sudden it was like my hips just spread out ! I didn't know I was preggers yet, and I couldn't get my jeans on...I just thought I had gained weight, but in reality, I was preggers ! Good luck !!!|`|rFMRgHTdaa	I just new i was pregnant i guess a gut feeling type of thing. I felt this way with both of my babies also i was feeling very nauseous in the mornings and it seemed like i could smell everything.|`|phwivaqNaa	Period symptoms and Pregnancy symptoms are very similar.  I honestly think I had more "symptoms" the months I WASNT pregnant.     The month I was I wasnt expected it and wasnt looking for anything and therefore had no symptoms.  Your pretty early on if you cant test until sunday.  Try not to drive yourself crazy and good luck.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I was really tired...exhausted.  And very irritable.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	both my pregnacy i felt flu like with pms but everyonr will be different Maybe yo ucan get an early test so you can take it late today?|`|OU9xnW86aa	I had cramping and felt like I was coming down with the flu. And food just tasted completely weird and different then usual.|`|8mLJJVGhaa	I felt sick, I couldn't smoke (which was a good thing!) I couldn't stomach alcohol or coffee, and my boobs were on fire! Also I had many irrational mood swings! Good luck x|`|sG4YCiLbaa	If you are pregnant you will know- I just found out that I am 6 weeks and I knew before I took the test. Mostly, you will have some cramping like your period is coming, you will probably be sensitive to smells and just really tired.    I hope everything works out for you, whichever way you want the test results to be!|`|jLNwrVZRaa	My breasts were REALLY tender and I also had a discharge.
F6lZHRkVaa	Just be as nice as possible to your brother. Offer to get him a drink, ask him about the game, find out what is he has plans for the weekend, etc. Make nice small talk. Hopefully he'll eventually warm up.    If you can't imagine being super nice to this guy, then you'll want to consider having the kids just meet somewhere where the adults aren't forced to talk to each other - like a skating rink or a big park or something along those lines.|`|3mb5IV1Zaa	I think you two should try to work it out, with no children around. If this is impossible, then you two should make every effort to keep the children in each other's lives. After all, if you had grown up knowing that your brother existed, the two of you would probably share a close bond, instead of so much hostility. Let your children have the opportunity to have what you didn't. I know it's difficult, but you have the opportunity to break a cycle by being the bigger man :o). Life can be messy, and I hope it gets better for ya!|`|gJlxZdL5aa	Well I'm not a parent yet but I also have a half brother I didn't grow up with and we don't see eye to eye (infact he has been very reluctant until recently to even have a relationship, he hated me at first) but if we both had kids and our kids enjoyed spending time together I would not have a problem with them spending time together.    As far as your situation you are family and family doesn't always like each other but you need to figure out what is best.    I mean if its so bad that your kids are uncomfortable don't take them around him.....if its just you that is uncomfortable well suck it up and just let your kids have fun|`|0vfX40Qxaa	Yes I would still bring them around to be with their cousins.  This is your opportunity to heal the rift in your family.  It may never happen with you and your brother, but it doesn't have to be that way for your kids.   Tell your brother what you said here, that your kids get along, and you want to get along with him for their sakes.  That you want them to know their family and that includes him.  Any father worth a damn will put aside his animosity for the benefit of his children.  Keep making the offer of friendship to your brother, he may eventually come around.  If your wives or girl friends get along that can also be an avenue to making peace.
DI25ZrcVaa	I am sorry to hear this.  We were having the same issues with our daughter and a friend of mind recommended a product called Hyland teething pills.  This worked very well for her.  The good thing is that it is a all natural product.     I am from Austin, TX and we could not find it at our Supermarket or Walmart.  We had to go to a specialty all natural drug store.    Another thing we would did in the past is give our daughter Popsicles.|`|aWPQXoIAaa	This happened to me too. However, the bad nights lasted only a few nights and I was able to sooth him and put him back in the crib. He only woke up 2-3 times a night. By getting him u are probably getting the baby back into a habit of u soothing him. So if this is constant, it's more u then the baby.|`|lzivF4Idaa	tell your husband to get the **** over it.    && try teething tablets, orajel, tylenol (if its THAT bad), and whatever else will sooth him without overloading him on things.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	Well if you're not wanting to co-sleep [which can turn into a terrible habit to break when you want it broken]. I would suggest trying Infant Tylenol, and Orajel, feed him very heartily before bed.|`|9bhZVJ61aa	I say you tell him  to bite ur big fat tusshyy  Because I don't care what makes him happy its about making your son comfortable not if  your husband doesn't want to be bothered GO WITH YOUR GUT. DO what mommies do best which is mothering thats exactly what your doing...|`|qStmw7qgaa	This is very old fashioned suggestion, and I know I'm going to catch some heat here, but have you tried to rub some rum or whiskey on his gums?  Obviously not a lot, but a little will numb them and that will help.  During the you could give him a frozen ego waffle to naw on.  They mush up really nice their mouth and wont choke them.  I had to do that w/ my niece when she was teething.  Or if that idea makes you nervous, try the teething cookies if you haven't yet.  There should be a baby teething gel that you can rub on their gums too...it doesn't work as well as the rum, but if that rum idea makes you nervous, the gel is great.  Good luck.  This is not an easy time.  Patients is the best thing too for all 3 of you guys...though I know that that is hard to find when your baby has been trying to teeth for that long.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Its not about hubby, its about baby.  Yes of course mommy and daddy are important, but the first year is all about baby.  Mommy and daddy SHOULD be mature enough to adjust.    You think my hubby wanted to be up with my puking toddler all night and then go to work the next day?  No but I was puking my guts out and the baby was sick too so you know what -you deal with it maturely and with as little whining as possible!      =============  Why babies should never sleep alone: A review  of the co-sleeping controversy in relation to SIDS,  bedsharing and breast feeding  http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/articles...    http://www.drjaygordon.com/development/a...  This arrangement is not just adequate and tolerable, but actually feels easier to moms who can just roll over, nurse a while and fall back to sleep with their babies rather having to get out of bed to nurse or, alternatively, refuse to nurse and get their babies back to sleep some other way.    Lots of parents continue this pattern through the first year and well into the second and beyond, but some get tired of it -- or just plain tired -- after a while and are looking for a way to change things. Saddest of all, some moms and dads think that total weaning from breastfeeding is the best way to get more sleep. They choose not to look into nighttime weaning as a good option instead.    [...]    I don't recommend any forced sleep changes during the first year of life. Probably the only exception to this would be an emergency involving a nursing mom's health. There are many suggestions in books and magazines for pushing "sleeping through the night" during a baby's early months or during the first year. I don't think this is the best thing to do and I am quite sure that the earlier a baby gets "non-response" from parents, the more likely he is to close down at least a little.    Don't get me wrong. I love the family bed, child-led weaning and cuddling all through the first, second, third year or more if it's working well and if the family is doing well. Don't let anyone convince you that this is a harmful choice or that there will be "no way" to get him out of your bed if you don't do it now. Don't believe anyone who says that babies who cuddle and nurse all night long "never" learn to self soothe or become independent. This is simply not true but it sells books and the myths stay in our culture.    Some moms just don't want to do this after some months or years and there should be a third choice to the dichotomy of crying it out or giving in to all-night nursing. Again, I support the family bed and frequent night nursing for a long time and even attempt to pull some parents along "just a little farther," but I often have to switch tacks and support and help families with difficult choices.
ejHfqSD1aa	Raspberry leaf tea. With some women it works and some it doesn't. So don't get disappointed if it doesn't work. Good luck!|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	rasberry leaf tea,softens the cervix.  i took tablets from 36 weeks and i had a really quick great labour!|`|QT5ROElraa	ras tea|`|MtC3CWZraa	Raspberry leaf tea is the one always named, but I can assure you there's no science to back it up.
d6GvS2Dpaa	My 10 week old takes anywhere from 4-6, but more often 4 oz., every 2-4 hours.  He just had his 2 month appt and is 13 lbs and 24 in.  6-7 oz.  seems like a lot, but if he takes it fine and doesn't spit up (a lot), I wouldnt' worry about it.|`|zwctZ812aa	That's plenty.  At 10 weeks, my son was taking 3 ounces every 2 hours.  At 13 weeks, he is still only taking 4 ounces and is in the 91st percentile for height and weight so he is getting enough.|`|OxFV92hJaa	My youngest is right at 8 weeks, and takes 3 oz at a time from the bottle. She nurses a lot though, but I have no way of knowing how much she's getting.     That sounds like a lot to me. I don't remember what my other 2 were taking then though, and this one came 3 weeks early....so who knows lol.|`|BUCwZYnzaa	waht really? my 10 month old takes taht much. but i booby fed so i dunno
iu4SOin3aa	Not that young.  You would miss out on so much like friends, parties, freedom, and an education.    I got pregnant when I was 18 and I still feel like I missed out on just being a regular teenager. Your friends leave you, chances are the guy wont stick around (mine did, but he's wonderful), and Im sure your parents and his wont want to support yall and the baby.    I know babies are cute, but they are very very hard to deal with, expecially young.    In short, dont be stupid.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Yes it is bad. If it was OK for your mom, it was because she busted her butt to make it OK. I can guarantee there was a lot going on behind the scenes that you didn't know about. Things that she had to put off, rearrange, and plain give up so you could have a decent life. Do you want to have to do that now? Do you think your mother wants this for you? Seeing you struggle the way she had to? A pregnancy will be a disappointment to her. You don't want to do that.    You get pregnant and he'll leave you. And even if he doesn't, where will you live? Will you finish school? Will you go on to college? Where will you work? Who will babysit when you want to go to some party? Or your high school graduation? Are you going to be able to live without X newest, coolest thing because the kid needs a new coat?    Get yourself on the pill AND use a condom. Every time. No exceptions. Period.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i cant even answer this because i have no idea what to say|`|kwMA5I1iaa	I would say no. It wasn't ok for her to get pregnant as a teen. It happened and she worked through it, but it would have been a better situation if she had waited. If you think she would approve, ask her if she thinks it's okay for you to have a baby right now. Honestly, she would be the one supporting the baby since you're still in school and your boyfriend can't possibly make enough to support a baby and put the baby into a daycare. Ask her and see what she says.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Actually it is not wrong but it is difficult. You might think you know your boyfriend, but adding a baby to the mix just makes things harder!why? You may ask well your parents will feel hurt with you and dissappointed also they might feel resentment towards your bf because he has done this. You will be happy with your baby but you might get frustrated because you have to worry about how to finish school and who will watch him/her and since you are 15 then i bet you have about 3/4 yrs of high school left right? When i was 15 i wanted a baby too and so did my bf we ended up having one when we were 17 & another at 18 i love my children but it did make finishing high school tough for me, what i suggest from experience is if he wants to have a bby because he is in love with you and doesnt want to loose you then he should trust that you will stay with him. He should get a job and save money so that in the future you guys can move in together and get married that way you are doing this in a way that will make your parents proud of you and also they will like him for you. At the end of the day it is your decition but you are a baby yourself and if you like to hang out with your friends at the movies or at parties then how can you continue that with a baby? Maybe your mom will watch the baby for you right? But your the one that wanted him/her in the first place so you should be the one watching the baby. Good Luck & think about your future before you make a life changing thing.|`|8pDblyCBaa	Why would you want to ruin your life? First of all, when he turns 18, it will be considered rape. He will go to jail!|`|k9VvIG3gaa	No..it is not okay!  Plus trust me hun..you DONT want to be..  I love my daughters and all..but its really hard being a teen mom...  You HAVE to get a job..do schooling..find someone to look after the baby while ur at school and work..buy EVERYTHING the baby needs  Its ALOT of work..    You should just wait till you are in a committed relationship...have a good job.and are COMPLETELY ready for a baby|`|E5CnUdhsaa	no it is  NOT  ok to have a baby just because your 17 year old boyfriend wants a baby, and your mother did it...sorry but that comment alone makes you sound like your not ready at to make your own choices and whats best for you let alone a baby|`|4DoXomHZaa	Oh dear God no.    You can't work, drive, buy a lotto ticket...and you want to be a mother? You are still a child. Anyone who ever had a baby that terribly young will tell you it's a bad idea.    Wait until you are an adult, have a job, your education, your own home and car....when you are independent and won't have to lean on others like the grandparents and tax payers for money.    Your bf is obviously very immature to think this. And very selfish. What kind of life can you give a baby when you'd have to find a sitter to go to PE class?    Use your brain.|`|kT7GVOosaa	Don't do it! I thought I wanted a baby when I was young and I am so glad I didn't. you really are to young and if you and your boyfriend love each other then you love each other enough to wait till you are older.|`|wzXJOSIeaa	I wouldn't call it "okay" but it is def. the norm these days. Look I know you probably love your boyfriend, but if he loves you, he will wait until you finish school at least. You have no clue exactly how much a baby  changes your life and trust me at 15 you don't want to know. Don't get me wrong, being a mother is great but only if it's at the right time. You have plenty of time for all of that. Could you image what your Senior year would be like? You couldn't go out with your friends because you have a child to tend to at home. Or College...wait what college...if you have a child. Think about this long and hard before you make a decision.|`|MCeh0uIaaa	sometimes things turn out nicely & both the parents and child have a happy life. sometimes that doesnt happen though dear. getting married at such a young age increases the risk of a nasty divorce. a baby is a big responsibility. dont you want to have a career? or at least finish high school?|`|djjVYhWiaa	No.  Do not have a baby yet.  Wait until you're 21+ at least before you even think of such things!  You're far too young and this could ruin your life.  My mother had a baby at 17 and whilst she loves all of her children, she wished she'd waited.|`|l9ab36z4aa	well if you are a teen mum it is likely your child will be one too if its a girl. You will face some social stigma and it will be harder because your education might suffer. I hope your mum is supporting you. I am also 15 if I got pregnant i don't think my parents would be understanding, just make sure your boyfriend and your family stay by you, and be the best mum you can be.   I wish you all the best.|`|GUswFG2Raa	Hell no. Don't Be Stupid. Having A Child While Your A Teen is not ok in any sense. at 15 you shouldn't be having sex, but if by chance you do , and you do get pregnant, then that's one thing. Don't go trying to make a baby. that will ruin your life.|`|4uqj8Nf1aa	it all depends if u want a baby! and if your in a stable relationship with money and a job.  im a teen mum and i love it but that just because its right for me.  everyones different.|`|acxgIMviaa	NOOOOOO!!!!!!  it costs so much money for a kid and you will have to drop out of school to raise it and you will be making bare minimum.  go to school, go to college, get married, and then have a kid. if he doesnt want to stick around that long then he doesnt love you. also ask your mom what it was like.|`|5YYzUgf7aa	No, yall are to young you and your boyfriend needs to wait intill yall are moved in with each other before yall decide to have kids and make sure that you can afford the baby.|`|3gSbn1nfaa	It isn't bad to be a teenage mother but it can be hard when you are not so sure about your decision. I think it's great that your boyfriend wants to settle down with you and start a family, but a baby should be wanted equally by both parents. Don't let your mother's experience influence your decision because we are in two completely different times now.|`|8ff3196b10cd4c3afc116407535b3666aa	No, being a teenage parent is usually an "accident" people don't plan teen pregnancies. Some do, but they didn't think it through completely.     Just because you're mother did it doesn't mean anything. There are way too many teen pregnancies. A baby is a lot of work and takes a lot of money. You can't even have a job at your age, except McDonalds or something like that and at his age his job is probably not that great either if he has one. You can't even drive yet. At your age you are not emotionally or financially stable enough for a child. Also I'm sure the relationship is not as stable as you think it is. You are still a child yourself, you don't need to be having a child. Think about it this way, do you want to have a 2-3 yr old when you are getting ready for college? Will you even be able to afford college? How much of the responsibilities of raising your child will fall to your mother because you will be at school. Are you willing to give up hanging out with friends because babies take your time? Are you willing to give up seeing your boyfriend often, becasue you won't be raising the child together most of the time because you live in different houses.     Wait to have children.|`|Zof09ZWJaa	It's not very smart to go out there and intentionally get pregnant at such a young age. At this age there is not too much you can do to provide for an infant. You are still in school and without a high school diploma you won't be able to get a decent job to support the baby. Children will be in your life forever, why rush things, you have your whole entire life ahead of you. At this age, do you have the patience and experience to deal with an infant at 2 in the morning? You can't even drive, how will you get your baby back and forth to the doctor. Neither one of you is an adult yet, you can't just assume you'll be able to live off your mom. Yes, it happens. I was a teenage mom. But it's so hard. You lose your friends, you don't get to hang out whenever you want or sleep in as late as you want. Kids grow out of their clothes quickly and you need to be able to provide everything from diapers, clothes, wipes, formula, etc... And he may say he wants a baby now and he'l be quick to get you pregnant, but there is nothing stopping him from leaving you and not being a part of that baby's life. It happened to me, he told me one thing and when I got pregnant he cheated on me and that was the end of our relationship, my daughter is 4 yrs old and he has NEVER seen her, talked to her or me, or provided for her in any way at all.  You need to be more focused on school and what you want to do in the future. The time will come for you to have children. And I assure you, now is the time you want to be more focused on having fun and chillin with your friends. I know from experience and I urge you to think twice before you set yourself up.|`|3O5k2HUjaa	No you should not have a baby this young because times are just to hard to bring a baby into this world. Your boyfriend probably just wants to have a baby to show it off or tell his friends about it. If he really loves you you can tell him no i am not ready and he will understand. At this age and wanting to have a baby it's not ok. You can't continue your education because you will have to take care of your baby. You will miss out on a lot of things like parties,prom,and having a fun in your teen years. I suggest you party it up while you can and wait until you know that your absolutely ready.|`|hGY08GjRaa	Being a teenage mother is not something you should strive for.     IF  you accidentally get pregnant, that's one thing, yes, teenagers can make good mothers, and you can make it in life.     But you should never TRY to become a mother at your age. The responsible thing is to wait until you've finished college and are married. A child needs financial stability and a 2 parent home.     Do you have ANY idea how much a baby costs? I'm sure some can enlighten you. How are you gonna pay for it? Will Mommy?     Again, I do NOT reccomend abortion or adoption if you DO get pregnant.. but there is NO reason in HE** why you should PURPOSELY get pregnant at  your age.     Trust me.. I've heard this situation over 100 times.. IT's always teh same. the boyfriend wants an excuse to have sex with you... and as soon as you get pregnant,  he'll soon find a way to exit. Trust me.. seen it a thousand times.. PLEASE learn from people who are a bit older than you and  have seen more of the world.|`|cix8nCpmaa	NOOOOOO you will be ruining your life when your friends wanna go to the mall you won't be able to go you will be busy taking care of your baby,you will be made fun of in school,i doubt your mother chose to have you as a teenager and im sure if you told her you wanted to get pregnant she would say not to you are ruining your childhood and i doubt your boyfriend will even help take care of the kid

reO9Dgmsaa	Sophie still often shares my food, since the kids' meals are huge, often overpriced, and usually junk she is not used to.  She enjoys most of the food we eat, and has since she was about 9 months old.  I just ask for a plate or bowl for her, and give her veggies, chicken/fish/steak, rice etc.   One of her favorite things is Japanese food!  She scarfs the seaweed and tofu from my miso, and steals my pickled ginger too LOL!  It was really funny watching her eat the ginger at 8 months.  :)|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I would order something for myself which I thought baby could have a little bit of and ask for an extra side plate - or, if it's a friendly, casual restaurant without a completely rigid menu, I'd ask the waitress if there's any chance baby could have a small plate with a few pieces of well-cooked veg on.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I would often bring table food for my kids to eat - yogurt, milk, applesauce, things I knew they would eat. Veggies, especially carrots, have to be overcooked, practically, so I can see your concern. You can always ask them to really cook them for her so they're soft enough for her to eat safely.     One option is a buffet - although for some reason, the minute you mention buffet - with all its choices, etc - my kids won't eat. I don't know what type of restaurants you go to, but pasta is usually a hit and easy to eat. I usually opt with something that has lots of side dishes to choose from, like vegetables, cottage cheese or applesauce - things they'd normally eat at home, in other words.     If she likes ethnic food, then just cut up into small bites whatever you're eating and I"m sure she'd do just fine.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Vegetable quesadillas are not particularly exciting, but they are easy to eat and fairly mess-free, just right for a 1yo. Admittedly not miles better than a grilled cheese, but.    Vegetables out of my salad have always been popular; babies can gum things up quite well without molars. Tomatoes, cucumbers, and peppers are all easy to pick out of your salad and hand over for even quite young babies.|`|vue9NOhYaa	You have several options.    For a baby this age, your best bet might be to just feed her off your plate. She isn't likely to be eating enough to make it worth ordering something for her.    If she DOES eat enough, or what you're having isn't appropriate, you could order an appetizer or side dish for her.  Or ask the waitress if they can provide something simple and healthy -- a baked potato, a bowl of rice,  an egg, a  dish of applesauce, and so on.     Or visit buffets.  Little ones usually eat free, and you can always find something appropriate.     (Kids menus used to drive me nuts.  The endless routine of chicken nuggets and hamburgers gets real tiresome.  I usally ordered an appetizer for my daughter.)|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	When my daughter was that age at American restaurants i would order her mashed potatoes and then give her some of whatever i was eating at Mexican restaurants beans and rice or caldo de rez(vegetable soup with beef) and at Chinese restaurants egg drop soup and white rice mixed together other than that if it's a type of food you aren't familiar with ask what they suggest mom and pop type places are wonderful about offering information on what they feed children in their culture that's what i did with mine and she's almost 4 and will eat almost anything|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Even if it is not on the menu you can order a side of vegetables.  You really don't want the veggies to be mushy, even for a 1 year old.  You are teaching your baby how to eat for life, and overcooking food is a bad habit.    I usually just let my kids eat off my plate, there's way more than enough for one person usually.|`|dp7VR8BJaa	If you have an Ethiopian restaurant near you, I would highly suggest you try it out.  It is very healthy fare and my 12 Mont old loves many of the dishes, mainly lentils and veggies.    Generally, though, we don;t eat out because of the hassle, the cost, and like you mentined, the difficulty finding healthy options.|`|hieQHR0daa	Why can't she have a side plate and try things from your,and your husband's plate. That will encourage her to try new things and you will still have some control over what she eats.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	at that age I would bring my son's food along.  Now he's 19 months, and will just eat some of what I'm eating.  But for a long time, I just packed him a meal when we went out.|`|WirFwirLaa	Mac n' cheese & applesauce and milk to drink. His ped. says that's just fine as long as were not eating out every night (which were not...)  He loves it!|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Yeah I usually just give him some of mine or my husband's food (like if ours has chicken in it I will give him some chicken from it or vegetables) or if what we are eating is not appropriate I order an appetizer of some sort for him, chicken tenders, fries, quesadilla, grilled cheese, something along those lines.    I am not too picky about it being the healthiest thing considering this is just one meal once in awhile, not like you go you every night.|`|qStmw7qgaa	Honestly, I would be bring her her own meal with you.  With that age that is what I would do.  I agree, the kids meals are just unhealthy.  If you want to get her something from the restaurant then I would order an extra side of veggie melody w/ your meal, and then just bit and give it to her, or some mashed potatoes.  Or feed her off your plate.  I hope that helps.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	at 12 months she can eat what you are eating! I share my dinner with my daughter or sometimes order her someting from the kids menu that she requests. she loves soups too!|`|K7f3B4scaa	Most place will usually let you order Ala cart so you can pick and choose what you would like your child to eat.|`|TeqjaDZmaa	Depending on the restaurant you could maybe get some plain pasta or maybe some plain chicken and ask for some veggies. A lot of restaurants now are coming out with more fruit and veggies for their kids menus. When my kids were little I found it much easier to make them like a sandwich or bring something simple like that from home. Then you know they are eating healthy and you know that they will like it.
AcOVnKtlaa	Hello again mommy09,    The World Health Organization standard is 20.000.000 sperm per milimeter of ***. Because usually men's semen volume when they ejaculate is about 2 ml, that gives them around 40.000.000 sperm normally.    Why do you need so much of them? That's because it's that difficult to make certain that pregnancy can be attained. The journey from the women's cervix to the egg is difficult. 90-95% of the sperm died during the journey . Not to mention that there's two fallopian tube (as the container of the egg) and only one contain the egg at any specific time. That cuts roughly another 50% of the sperm that survived, on the account that they gather in the wrong fallopian tube. Moreover, since sperms have a short lifespan, the timing of the intercourse is vital for them to be able to reach the egg in time.    But,don't worry. There's a fast and easy way to help your husband increase his sperm count. More details about it are on on source articles.|`|7AYnWg3paa	i think sperm is supposed to be somewhere in the billions so yea it is kinda low....|`|mx3gFmIKaa	18 million is low, over 20mil is considered normal, average are 40-60mil and can go up to 100mil    Many things affect the count, I had infertility, when the RE checked my husband his sperm analysis was 44mil, but on day of insemination, that sample was only 8 mil because we had sex the day before, and I got pregnant from this sample    and the other two answers are completely inaccurate    Joe P has a good accurate answer|`|yCR6qg0baa	Technically, it should be between 200-400 million, but NO that's not too low to get pregnant. It only takes ONE sperm and if he's got 18 million swimming around, I think the odds are in your favor. Good luck!    Edit: I noticed all the thumbs down. I guess all my college biology professors lied to me. Hmm...
uqLUKbMbaa	You can't stop him Lyndsey no matter how hard you try. I have read the other answers and they are good.  But this is something that has to run its course.  Somewhere along the line your son will meet his Waterloo.  No matter how big we think we are, there is always someone bigger.  And ultimately, the day will come when he realises that through his own actions, he does not have any friends. Unfortunately there may be tears.  But that is where you and your husband come in.  You will catch your son when he falls.  There will be no recrimination on your part.  No one saying, "I told you what would happen".  And this will take him by surprise.  Many children do what your son is now doing.  All your husband and you can do is teach him by example, which is what you are doing.  You are not the only parents to be going through this kind of thing with your son.  Neither will you be the last.  Good luck Lyndsey.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Have you talked to him about how he makes other people feel, about themselves and about him, when he does that?  Then, asked him if he likes being the kind of person who makes people feel that way?      I'm guessing the answer would be 'No'.  (If not, you've got more basic things to teach him about life)    At that point, brainstorm with him ways to change, to break the habit, to notice when he's doing it & redirect himself (with your help, if that's what you decide, together, is the best approach).       Involve him in solving the problem for himself|`|F6lZHRkVaa	When you catch him doing it (and it's important to catch him at the act) gently lead him away and say, "Now it's not nice to make people feel like they're not as good as you. Let's find something about them that's very good. Do you like shoes? What about his backpack? Ok, let's go tell him he has a very nice backpack." And then lead your child back to the fray and have him tell the kid he has a nice backpack.     And so on and so forth. You have to catch him at it though, if you just tell him without backing up the action it won't be drilled into his head. Good luck!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Listen to how kids talk amongst themselves. This is normal. Keep talking to your son telling him why he shouldn't be doing this stuff. Wait until you hear some of the things he'll say as a teen.
fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milkc...  Many mothers wonder how much expressed breastmilk they need to have available if they are away from baby.    In exclusively breastfed babies, milk intake increases quickly during the first few weeks of life, then stays about the same between one and six months (though it likely increases short term during growth spurts). Current breastfeeding research does not indicate that breastmilk intake changes with baby's age or weight between one and six months. After six months, breastmilk intake will continue at this same level until -- sometime after six months, depending in baby's intake from other foods -- baby's milk intake begins to decrease gradually (see below).    The research tells us that exclusively breastfed babies take in an average of 25 oz (750 mL) per day between the ages of 1 month and 6 months. Different babies take in different amounts of milk; a typical range of milk intakes is 19-30 oz per day (570-900 mL per day).    We can use this information to estimate the average amount of milk baby will need at a feeding:        * Estimate the number of times that baby nurses per day (24 hours).      * Then divide 25 oz by the number of nursings.      * This gives you a "ballpark" figure for the amount of expressed milk your exclusively breastfed baby will need at one feeding.    Example: If baby usually nurses around 8 times per day, you can guess that baby might need around 3 ounces per feeding when mom is away. (25/8=3.1).    [...]    If baby is taking significantly less expressed milk than the average, it could be that baby is reverse-cycling, where baby takes just enough milk to "take the edge off" his hunger, then waits for mom to return to get the bulk of his calories. Baby will typically nurse more often and/or longer than usual once mom returns. Some mothers encourage reverse cycling so they won't need to pump as much milk. Reverse cycling is common for breastfed babies, especially those just starting out with the bottle.    If your baby is reverse cycling, here are a few tips:        * Be patient. Try not to stress about it. Consider it a compliment - baby prefers you!      * Use small amounts of expressed milk per bottle so there is less waste.      * If you're worrying that baby can't go that long without more milk, keep in mind that some babies sleep through the night for 8 hours or so without mom needing to worry that baby is not eating during that time period. Keep an eye on wet diapers and weight gain to assure yourself that baby is getting enough milk.      * Ensure that baby has ample chance to nurse when you're together.      http://www.workandpump.com/reversecyclin...   Reverse Cycling    Reverse Cycling basically means that your baby has nights and days mixed up, and eats more at night and sleeps more during the day. This sounds like a nightmare, doesn't it? A baby up all night? You've got a job to go to, how are you supposed to sleep?    Well, it's not really all that bad. In fact, some moms actively encourage their babies to reverse cycle. Why?? Well, the more your baby eats when you're together, the less he'll need when you're apart. Bottom line - less bottles, less pumping. For moms who work in places where it's really hard to pump, this can be a godsend.    The keys to making reverse cycling work for you are 1) Making sure your baby gets enough to eat, and 2) Getting enough sleep. Both of these can be solved with the same strategy: Having your baby sleep close to you.    If your baby is close to you at night, a few neat things happen.    Your baby eats more: If your baby is close to you at night, you'll probably find he eats more during the night. The reason for this is that when your baby wakes up, you're more likely to wake up with him and feed him. He also may wake up more often with you close by. Babies who sleep alone sleep more deeply (a risk factor for SIDS) and tend to eat less at night (needing more bottles during the day).    You get better rest: Wait a minute, I just said your baby would wake up more, that you would wake up more - how does this make for better rest?    The secret is that you and your baby get into similar sleep cycles. When your baby is in a separate room, he wakes up on his sleep cycles, you're on yours, and there's no coordination - so he might be waking up when you're in your deepest sleep (when it's a lot harder to wake up and harder to fall back asleep).    Also, if your baby is in another room, he has to wake up all the way and start crying before you hear him. You have to wake all the way up and get out of bed, and most likely you sit up in a chair to feed - awake the whole time. Then what? It's 2am, and you're both awake, taking longer for both of you to settle back to sleep.    If your baby is near you, you'll wake up when he makes his first noises, little half-sleeping grunts. You just reach over to feed, you can nurse lying down, the whole feeding routine is less disruptive to you and your baby's sleep. Falling back to sleep means either sliding your baby back to the co-sleeper, or just drifting off where you are.|`|zwctZ812aa	It does seem like so little...my 13 week old goes through four 4 oz bottles while I am at work from 8:30 to 5:00.  I feed him at 7:45 and 5:30, so he takes four in between those times.  How long have you been at work for? If it has been a bit and she doesn't seem to be losing any weight I would say you're okay, but keep an eye on her.  If she seems to be losing weight, call her doctor.  If not, just bring up your concerns at her next well check.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I'd say 3-6 oz every 4-5 hours is right..not written in stone of course. we arent always hungry on schedule. But in Daycare centers this is the reccomended schedule and amount for 2 months old|`|I3V7hE32aa	Your daughter would indicate if she was not getting enough to eat.  If she isn't fussy during the day, and seems content with the 2 - 4oz feedings, then I wouldn't worry about it.  If she wanted more, she'd cry or be really fussy.    Just take your cues from her and it'll be fine.|`|AA11476782	Your daughter sounds healthy and big.  From my understanding, you have to count total feeds in a 24-hour period, so even though she may just have 2 in those 10 hours, she can make up for that by eating more frequently in the other 14 hours.  As long as she is growing and wets and dirties diapers enough, she's eating enough.|`|XQIbx7Plaa	it seems like her weight is VERY healthy, and that is what we, as parents, should look at when trying to determine wether or not a baby is getting enough nutrition.

HXfHkoSHaa	When they can hold it, give it to them.  It's much easier to introduce it when they're young.  Then they're often not as attached to their bottle.|`|uTEr67Bhaa	I gave my son a sippy cup starting at 8 months and completely took the bottle away by 10 months.|`|qStmw7qgaa	My brother and sister in law did 8 months to try and give her coordination.  But I personally just help them drink out of a normal cup that way they aren't always walking around w/ a sippy cup.  But that is just me.  But yeah, my brother did 8 months, and it seems to be working pretty well.  :-)|`|ibeYAlwpaa	i started to give my daughter a sippy cup at 6 months. They have ones with soft tops that make the transition very easy for  your baby.|`|dPmK83UYaa	6 months for my first baby  7 months for the second    there are sippy cups w/ different stages. you just need to make sure your child is getting all the nutrients they need through formula or breastfeeding until age one. If u can put it in the sippy, its cool, just make sure it doesn't come out too quickly. it can cause gas. I like the dr. brown ones.|`|LzCn7Ggqaa	my daughter is 6 months old and drinks water from her sippy cup|`|AA11101279	8 months to get rid of the bottle by 12 months|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	7-8 months
Q6YboW9Daa	There are a few...    I love the ultrasounds...especially when I paid for a 2D/3D/4D to find out the sex.      I also love being able to feel her kick and now being able to see it when I'm lying down in bed.    Lastly, I love shopping for her =]  Little girl outfits are just too cute to pass up!|`|gx4s68s8aa	The ultrasounds by far.  Since week 18 I have to have a full 2D ultrasound to check for a blood clots in my babies placenta every few weeks.  But my high risk doctor (I have two for this pregnancy) is so great that after then necessary things are taken care of- he always does 3D and 4D pictures.  It has been so nice that he has done that.  I have gotten to see her develop even in the womb.  And I can see her pretty little face.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	the u/s and feeling baby move|`|Z1FdawAOaa	i would say when you find the sex out!|`|zSABr7praa	The ultrasounds, I cry every time :)  I also love buying baby cloths!|`|5JB1fHz9aa	I was going to say the ultrasounds too... I had the 3D/4D ones too, but lucky me my office does them for free at your regular schedule ultrasound (if you wanted an extra one than you would have to pay).  I just saw my baby at 38 weeks and he is so cute and chubby! The tech said it's harder to see the baby this far along because the their size, but we still saw him pretty good.  Also I just like feeling him move around... it seriously is the coolest thing in the world although this one hurts me a lot, my first never hurt when he moved.|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	There are 3 that stand out for me, I'm not yet far enough along to know the sex or feel baby bean move, but here ya go:    1. Seeing that postive test after so many negative tests in the months before...I was stunned.    2. Telling my husband, one of the best moments ever.     3. Getting ultrasounds/listening to the fetal heart monitor at the doc's office! Really good confirmation there's really a baby in there!|`|buoqtZeFaa	Feeling the baby move! I love those little kicks|`|FIJ1QmEIaa	feeling her move! it was awesome|`|vYAgIMLdaa	being the father.  Men can't handle all the stuff you ladies go through.|`|cAnha6sjaa	The fact my wife thinks it's hers.|`|bAp35x7uaa	The best bit definitely has to be seeing little beany at the ultrasounds.  It's incredibly comforting.  And I've got a week and a bit to go before I can hear the heartbeat at the doctors so am holding on until then :-)|`|mxixfE3Raa	The ultrasounds. It didn't feel real until I saw my babies. Especially because i'm having triplets, there's so much to worry about, so the ultrasounds really put my mind at rest.|`|cBMwHdn4aa	when my son would get the hiccups!  i could always tell the difference bw that and other little-or big-kicks.|`|3qI1oyFaaa	feeling my little man move, and catching onto his personality already (he's a smart as*, just like me and his daddy :) )    the ultrasounds were nice too, but I get to feel him each and every day :)      congrats and good luck!!|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	the ultra sounds and feeling the baby move for the first couple of times|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	I can see my belly button for a while!!|`|Q0DLGuGwaa	so far the ultrasound i had at 8 weeks got another on thursday woo cant waitx|`|YuA7a08Maa	I definitely love the ultrasounds.  They're amazing.  But for me, I think it'll be feeling the baby move.  There's nothing as "real" as that.|`|Y7sio6Yhaa	ya i agree it was finding out i was having a girl, i was so stoked.|`|Zb7AGTwAaa	I would say the beginning.....the last 3 months has been hell!!!!|`|iWrXIWcPaa	yea, the ultrasounds are amazing! i just had a 3D/4D one yesterday and they captured her first "angry " face. i was also able to see her eyelids opening and closing and see her breathing movements. its really amazing what those machines can do! my favorite part however is learning i will possibly have my baby if not tomorrow than within a week!|`|xfZWmPJPaa	my fav. part was of course like everyone else said, the ultrasounds. and movements, but most of all!! the hickups! I LOVE IT.  although my daughter had them 20 out of the 24 hour day!  it was awesome. and i also had the 3d ultrasound done aswell, that was pretty awesome too!:)  i loved it:)|`|AA11284789	even though i have 4 weeks left  for my c section.........and am so ready for this baby to be out.....I am loving feeling her move, I know i will miss it when she is out...its such an amazing feeling. This will be my last baby and i need to cherish every movement :)|`|H2ciLJoPaa	Feeling and seeing the baby move :)|`|9a1eb97689a998e5c4bdd3b7fcbea028aa	Well i liked the ultrasounds. Also feeling the baby move and the my hubby doing EVERYTHING for me when he is there and taking care of me.|`|uTEr67Bhaa	Feeling the baby move.  That is an incredible experience.
n8vBnA9Iaa	I had a VBAC 14 months ago. I was very on the fence about doing it because of risks involved and I was really scared about it. We had a normal pregnancy. Then when my son was 3 days late, we had a consultation with a specialist. We went over the risks and the pros to having one.  I went into labor at 3 am. And I never once thought about the risks. I delivered my 10.3 lbs son in 4 hours. It was amazing.    If you want to have 1, I would highly recommend it. We are now expecting our 3rd in October and I will have a vaginal birth unless there is an emergency.|`|9P26sacKaa	Find a good doctor or midwife and a good hospital, or decide on a homebirth (HBAC).  You will need to ask a lot of questions of your doctor/midwife and all those you interview to make sure you have someone who is compatible with your beliefs and who believes in VBAC and a woman's right to true informed consent.      Interview more than one doctor, including your current one.  Ask the interview questions to find out what your doctor thinks and will want to do.  Will there be a limit on labor? (there shouldn't be one) Will they induce you? (they shouldn't)  How long will they let you be pregnant before wanting to schedule a repeat c-section?  (it should be 42 weeks)    There are a lot of questions for your doctor.  I would also call the hospitals in your area and ask the charge nurse if she can recommend any good VBAC doctors.  I have a resource where I can look this up for you if you'd like, but it's better to just call and ask that question and also ask if the charge nurse has ever seen a VBAC with your particular doctor.  Some doctors say they are pro-VBAC, but they have all sorts of ridiculous rules that your labor must follow or they're just tell you that they have to cut you again.    Remember your rights and stick by them.  Hire a doula.  Pick the risk provider.  Pick the right birth place.  It's all up to you.      Go check out ICAN (International Cesarean Awareness Network) and look at their VBAC information.  http://ican-online.org/vbac/home  (from this page, look on the lefthand side for links to more info on VBAC information and papers).    There is so much knowledge and wisdom on that web site and in the women who build up the community of ICAN.  They have forums and email groups and all sorts of resources that you should utilize and ask all the questions you could possibly have.  They have all of the studies and all of the information.      Catastrophic rupture (when it's actually a problem for mom and/or baby's health and livlihood) only happens in 1 in 2500 attempted VBACs.  Other obstetric emergencies that are just as severe are more common than this number.  The reason why rupture shows up so often as such a big risk is that they count a lot of things as a rupture, even if the scar is still intact but a "window" is present, as in the tissue stretched so much as to make it very thin.  They can call this a rupture even if there were no problems at all, no problems for the future, and no symptoms or signs of a problem whatsoever.      Good luck.  You CAN do this.|`|AA11284789	uterine rupture is the main one, i wanted to do a vbac after my 1st c section but my child was too big almost 11 pounds....Best of luck to you, id say go for it, the doc will let you know if he feels it is too much of a risk.....|`|y2ywR3X9aa	it depends on why you had the c section. if it was because the baby was big you wouldnt be a good candidate for vbac.also if it was an emergency  c section and you had the top to bottom cut you are more at risk for having your uterus rupture. uterine rupture is the biggest risk.your uterus may open where the incision scar is causing you to possibly bleed to death or need a hysterectomy. Talk to your doctor.because of the risks and the chance of malpractice lawsuits a lot of doctors will not do a vbac. I know some woman who had success with a vbac. I couldnt have a vbac because my second child was measuring big(he was 10lbs 2 oz) and the risk for rupture was higher so I opted for a second c section which was easier than the first. Like I said talk to your doctor and really think about it. Good luck|`|AA11210211	Uterine rupture is a big one here is some good info you should read:    http://www.webmd.com/baby/tc/vaginal-bir...|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	There is a scar inside you, on the top of your uterus from the C-section. During a Vbac, the baby or placenta can rub against that or tear it off on their way out, causing bleeding and uterine rupture or collapse, making you very at risk for bleeding or unable to have future children. While it is a risk, it is not very common. Michelle Duggar, the woman who is famous for having 17 or 18 kids has had her last few via Vback. It depends on how comfortable your doc is with this procedure, how big the baby is, and your blood tests, some women are more susceptible to bleeding and hemorraging.|`|0iUxfCMcaa	i had my first vbac 2yrs after my csection and they monter your uterus during labor to watch over you and the baby. since its been three yrs since your csection the risk of anything happening now is very slim. :) vbacs are so much easier to recover from|`|4ilM2hCwaa	The risks are minimal and the benefits noticable.  you must discuss the options with your OB, s/he is the one who can give you a realistic picture of your situation, not a buch of unknowns at a answer board.  Here's a little info:     http://www.webmd.com/baby/tc/vaginal-bir...
AA10636233	Identical twins are a fluke of nature, and you are just as likely as anyone else to have them.The fertilized egg splitting in two is  basically random.  Fraternal twins are inherited because the condition where the mother releases more than one egg each month is passed down through your genes! We have this gene in my family since my mom had 2 sets of fraternals, so I was definitely worried.  So, if your family's twins are identical then you are likely in the clear, but if they are fraternal, then good luck! lol!|`|AA11296044	Boy oh boy, twins sure do run in your family.    Evne if you do become pregnant with twins a twin pregancy is not much different than any other pregnancy.  You have a few more prenatal check ups, you will probably get a little bigger and you are at a higher risk of having a c-section or your babies a couple weeks early.  However healthy twins are born to women everywhere every day.      THere is no need to worry.|`|qStmw7qgaa	I personally think twins are awesome...especially if you have twins your first time around...because there is nothing in the world that you could do.  :-)  Everything seems easy after that.  My Aunt was 5'1" and had twins...you should have seen her...and they were both 7 lbs.  Yikes...and she had an easy birth.  It was hard to walk at 9 months though.  I think you guys should try and get pregnant.  And if you get twins...consider it a blessing.  :-D|`|hJoB7VR1aa	Twins can be a genetic trait. There are 30 set of twins on my side of the family and my BF has 26 sets on his. When I was pregnant with my daughter I had an extra sac that was empty. I am now pregnant again but as far as we can tell there is just 1. I know the thought of twins can be scary, but you have to look at the positives as well.   You have a good chance of having twins, just be happy, there are so many women out there longing for a child. If you get 2 then you are just doubly blessed.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	Multiples are inherited through the mothers line.      My mother is a twin, and I am a triplet, me and my fiance birthed our single son last May.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	It just runs in the family.You can't stop genetics. If you get pregnant,there is about 70% chance that you will have twins. But thats a blessing :)|`|ds5MCdS5aa	Twins do tend to run in families, and it looks like yours is one for sure!  I wouldn't worry too much about wether or not your going to get pregnant with them.  You will, or you wont! Just remember that your body is set up to do this, and you will be under a Dr.'s supervision.  You, and your baby(s) will be just fine.  Think about all the women out there who cant even have one, and just be thankful!  Good Luck!
C5pVfdzwaa	He digs you, and even if he didn't, he sounds like a guy worth going after.  Just talk to him.

He might be too shy to make the first move.  Be brave and good luck!|`|iSMWMhHraa	Talk to him, even say hi or ask how his day was. Don't spend your whole life wondering "what if?" and waiting for others. Seize the day!|`|acxgIMviaa	the door thing is polite. but sit with him one day and talk out something. it doesnt matter what it could be about legos and you will see if he will start flirting with you. or if he is quiet and listens to your every word then says something it could be a friend thing.|`|ThFCLbYpaa	well i would help you but u didnt specify wether ur a guy or girl so i dont know if ur a homo or not, cause if you are theres a guy named david hurley that could rly help you out.
I3V7hE32aa	Absolutely.  Your child needs to learn to socialize with people other than you.  Not only with the adult caregiver, but the other children.    I kept my son with me for almost two years.  At that time he would talk, but it was kind of his own language/babbling.  He had never been around other children either, so he didn't even know what it was like to be around children and to play with them.  After only 1 month in day care, he was speaking with normal words, counting to 5, and generally excited to go to daycare each day to be with his new friends.  It was the best thing I could have done for my child.    I know children who never went to daycare and they are spoiled, do not share, throw fits if they don't get their way (since it's only ever been "their way"), and cry if mom and dad leave their sight.  Imagine the shock it will be for them the first day of school!    If you do not like the idea of leaving your child for 8 or more hours per day, and if you do not have to go back to work, consider taking your child to daycare for just a couple hours each day.  And maybe only 2-3 days per week.  Not only will it be great for your child, but you will be able to get some free time as well.|`|K7f3B4scaa	I think so. She'll learn social skills and learn how to play with other kids. My daughter has been in daycare since she was 4 months old and now she's 14 months, and a people person. I think it will be harder on you then it will be on her.|`|aNGzulgpaa	my daughter will be 3 in March.  She was in day care from October 2007-April 2208 because i had to start working after being home with her from birth.  She was hysterical the first week ever day when i dropped her off she would freak out.  But after that, she would clap when we would pull into the parking lot.  She LOVED it, and i noticed that while in day care, she learned more. She would sing new songs, and also learned her ABC's and learned how to count.  i took her out in April of 08, because i lost my job and i was home with her again.  I noticed she got bored easily, and would ask to play with her friends.  So when i got a new job in August i have been looking since then to find a day care that i was happy with.  I just recently found one that i like, and she will start there this Monday.  She is SO excited to go back to school, and talks about it all the time.      I can say that I was apprehensive at first to put her in day care and let strangers take care of her.  I didn't trust anyone to watch her and care for her as good as I can - being that i am her mother, i know best.      But i must admit - now that i know how much she learns....i am happy to put her in day care.  And to those opposed to day care ( i was once one of you)....no it doesnt make me a bad parent because my child is in day care........it makes me a parent that has to work to provide for her child, and i do it very well......i have the polite, respectful, sweet, and inteligent little girl to prove it!|`|IuOxDlzCaa	there is a mix of both i guess. the bad side would be the initial seperation and settling in. worrying for you and a little stressful for your child. but as soon as they realise that the people looking after them are nice and they make friends and enjoy the variety of new toys and resources avaliable to them they may pick up new skills that you cant offer when its just you and your child. such as sharing with more children and joining in with group activities and simply socialising with children their own age! so there are benefits i believe :-)|`|Tvq32ptlaa	What is the reason you're putting her in daycare?  I'm guessing work.  If not and you're utilizing it as a socialization tool then that's a different answer.  I'll start with what I think is the easy short answer one first...    Socialization:  There are plenty of other ways to get a child familiar with social skills and interaction with other children.  Contact you local hospital and find out about mommy & me classes, contact the public library and find out about age appropriate group sessions.      Work: Have you done your daycare homework??  Have you reasearched the daycare, double checked their credentials and made sure they were up to code?  Have you checked out the facilities?  Have you popped in (unannounced) at least once of a couple of times to see a "real" environment (not one where they are expecting you-and on their best behavior).  Did you talk to other parents that take their children there.  Have you asked what their turn-around rate is, do kids come & go often or quickly (bad sign)    There's a lot to ponder and consider before you should dropp off your child at the door.....|`|ztug2gLjaa	she'll be able to interact with other kids at a younger age which is good.  She'll be taught how to share and that's good.  My kids have been in daycare since they were small but I have to work!  It helps them in many ways so I wouldn't worry.  The only downfall is that she's gonna get sick alot...but that will build up there immune system.  since my kids go to daycare I give them vitamins everyday to help them!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	A "good" thing for her? Is it necessary? Are you having to work now or is there some reason to put her in daycare? If not then I would never, ever put my child in daycare. They can get socialization at playgrounds, playgroups, preschool programs where you can volunteer. I would not let my child be alone with strange people and in a strange environment without me. I don't think it's a safe or healthy environment personally. But of course that is for everyone to decide individually.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	i think daycare is a good thing, they teach children well.|`|kT7GVOosaa	yes. she needs to be introduced to many childern her own age. she will cry the first and prolly second and third day but after a while she will be prefectly fine there. and it is better for her to get socialized before she starts school and has no idea how to make friends.|`|agTCqkLDaa	My mom always did the half day preschool (I guess it's called Mother's Day Out now?) and that was always good.  I got exposed to other children, but I didn't start calling other people Mama.|`|ENANtueuaa	In moderation, while the parents are working, daycare is just fine. It provides a safe, nurturing, learning environment, and allows your child to interact with other children. I am a daycare teacher, and in most cases the children do just fine. The first couple days can be a little rough, but as soon as they learn that you are coming back, they actually enjoy coming and playing with all the other children. However, I see a lot of children that get dropped of from 6am when we open, until 5:30pm when we close. It's so sad to me that a parent can leave their child in someone elses hands for 11 1/2 hours a day, knowing that they do not work that long. So, in excessive amounts like that, then i do not agree that that is the right choice for the child. If you aren't working and need a place for your child to interact with other children, you could try a preschool, or playgroup, or even the local library. Swimming and gymnastics can be fun activities also. It doesn't sound like you have a choice...don't worry, he will be just fine!! Hope this helps!|`|SgOVFseaaa	I do think that it is very important for a child that age to be cared for by others sometimes.    We have this myth that children were traditionally kept home with their mothers 24/7.  It's not true at all.  Throughout history, most women have worked outside the home - whether it was as an nurse, selling in the market, picking in the fields, sewing, etc.  It was only the very rich women who could afford to stay home with their children all day.    Throughout history, children were typically cared for  by other members of the community.  Grandmothers and other women in the community...  I don't see any reason why they would be less safe in a daycare setting.  If anything, they will be safer today because of the training, rules and guidelines that most daycares must follow.    I think that in today's society, we're so isolated.  Women are taught to think that it is wrong to go out and work, and that they are not good mothers unless they stay at home, bored and unstimulated, with their young children.  I think that it prevents children from learning how to negotiate and play with other children.  Also, your child will learn in daycare that he is not the center of the universe.  It is healthy.|`|AXEqOEloaa	If she absolutely has to be there she will be fine, if you are only doing it so she can interact with other kids there are plenty of activities you can do with her where she can have time with other kids her age. Not bashing or judging anyone who has to use daycare but I would not put them in there just cause.
mc6YtaRbaa	You should be ovulating around 2/1-2/6. You should baby dance every other day until 2/10 just to be sure. If you baby dance every day, his sperm count will decrease, but if you do it every other day it's better and the sperm will live inside you for a few days. Good luck!|`|CuTvFlxTaa	You don't say how long your period was this month. When was the first day of your period not the last? Was it the 22nd of Jan? Count 14 days from day 1 of your period, then on the days leading up to day 14...ie:- Days 10,11,12,13,14 do the baby dance to increase your chances. Remember it takes up to 12 months to conceive.|`|Pxe5jVpPaa	Observe ur secretion. Is it eggwhite type transparent and stretchy? Then u r in ur fertile phase. Then baby dance every alternate day starting today. Had u posted this a little earlier, I would have suggetsed u to buy Pre-seed. It has 6 applicators costing 16-17 $. Available on drugstore.com. Check at ur nearby chemist if he keeps one. If so, use it this time. Pre seed basically helps to maintain a sperm friendly atmosphere inside the woman so chances of getting pregnant are more. Also after the sex, put a pillow under ur bum and raise ur legs in air and keep in that position for at least 10-15 minutes. Hope all this helps.
5YYzUgf7aa	Let everything cool down and then talk with him. But its goin to be awkward  for a long time.im sure everything will be  fine yall can still be friends. you just might feel a littke weird around him but that is okay over time the feeling will go away and yall will forget about what happen..     GOOD LUCK|`|PZ9jIk5zaa	talk to david hurley  hes an expert with this kinda stuff|`|ThFCLbYpaa	i know this guy named david hurley, hes the biggest deusche bag ull ever meet but he could rly help because this thing happened between the math teacher and him where he got her pregnant and it was rly akward and ****. idk how but he found a way to fix it...... so talk to him|`|8pDblyCBaa	Give it time and see what happens!|`|4DoXomHZaa	SOunds like you did lose a friend over this. The two of you made a poor choice and will now have to deal with it.     It's awkward for you, but maybe he got what he wanted and now hit the road. Otherwise, why wouldn't he said one of those impersonal texts and say "I'm embarassed"??|`|NzzH2VNSaa	i like to use the o i was drunk...and i tripped and feel in.....the truth about drinking is that your true feelings so out don't feel awkward because he proble thinks he was getting lucky but if you feel that you don't want to be with him then he needs to understand that|`|pMKaf73kaa	Never apologize. It takes two to tango. It wasn't all your fault. Just leave it be. Let it cool down. Try approaching him and say, you're not regretting anything and leave it at that. Give him time to think things over. Maybe one day, he'll come to his senses.|`|szVvf7Nkaa	I think he could be hurt because you text him telling him to forget about it. Maybe this guy does not want to forget about it. Text him again and ask him to meet you somewhere. Tell him that you really need to talk. If you are not sorry that you made out with him then let him know. And on the other hand it could be that he's sorry for making out because he never wanted to cross that line with you. You say you are good friends then good friends are able to talk to each other. It could be that you both made a mistake by making out but you need to know. Let  your friend know that his friendship means a lot to you. And let him know that you don't want to lose his friendship.|`|tg9D0tVGaa	wow, ive been there  lol  leave it a while n if nothing happens between you two then pretend it never happened  that helps things to not be awkward  if it happens again talk to him|`|eOZvYxJTaa	let things cool down for a bit and then talk it out.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	Sounds like maybe he was hoping it meant something. You can really hurt people leading them on like that.  If you didn't want to loose a friend you shouldn't have acted that way.|`|AA10572259	Whats done is done and you can't change that.  If you are sure he isn't interested in a relationship then its not worth even looking into.  I would just try to act as natural as you can.  You shouldn't feel bad or say sorry for what happened.  You both took part.  Maybe he is worried that you are mad at him for some reason.  If he isn't mature enough to just put it behind you and stay friends then its his loss.
zwctZ812aa	What an ignorant statement Leah.  Having to havea  caregiver has nothing to do with being lazy.  some parents have to work to support their children...how does that make them lazy? Sorry we are not all blessed enough to be SAHM's.  As for why do newborns need a caregiver...because they are helpless.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	because they cant drive yet|`|c0Hx73ITaa	They don't. Babies can take care of themselves.|`|0c2d52d9d2a37dd0ef833700ac7163c4aa	Im sorry I don't really understand the point of your question, I mean obviously a newborn cant take care of itself.|`|AXEqOEloaa	If you are asking why they need a caregiver other then the parents it is because some are just lazy. For them it is easier for someone else to raise their kids.
f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I found i barbie foot in my sink about a half year ago!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	One time I found a slimy toothbrush in my bathroom sink at my old apartment from some previous tenant. Gag. I'm not sure how water ever managed to drain! <br>  <br>  But most recently, I found a slimy straw in the drain in the kitchen. Not mine ... honest!|`|fdnbXfvfaa	The contents of my husbands wallet..with the faucet running.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Cat puke... I had to thank the cat though, at least i didn't really have that much of a mess to clean up! LOL|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	I found my sons goldfish, it was actually a few weeks ago.  He is going to be 6 in a few months, i was complaining about how i didnt feel like cleaning the tank, so he was trying to be nice and cleaned it for me ( i wasnt aware lol).  WELL he left the fish in the sink!  Apparantly he got side tracted..  the tank was in the room back on his dresser, it was clean and sparkly.. with a few bubbles of soap on top.  I told him he forgot spongebob in the sink and he said oops.  Spongebob sadly didnt make it lol.<br>  <br>  Oh, this isnt about a sink, but my bestfriend moved into a new house, she was looking through the cabinets and found a box, she opened the box to find a bag of ashes, which where the remains of Taj mah!!   Someone left their family member!!!!  Then a few days later she found a bag of human hair under the sink!  The last three tenants all moved out after exactly 3 months...  kinda creepy!|`|kSZx9cY5aa	ANTS! I don't know if it's the strangest thing i've found, but it was the most disgusting! Someone left a plate covered in golden syrup in there, and I came home to an ant infested sink *sigh*.<br>  <br>  The strangest would probably be when we were having a really warm day, and one of our cats fell asleep in the sink! Funny sight..|`|zmpk29BLaa	My dog when my sister left him in there to give him a "bubble bath". It was cute.. the water wasn't high enough to where he could drown or anything.. but it was kind of funny to walk into the kitchen (I was home visiting my mom and sis for the weekend) and see our little dacsuand covered in bubbles in the kitchen sink while my sister went to look for a sponge.|`|de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	Although it used to be a common occurrence before I had kids, I saw my own reflection in the sink a few weeks ago.  I'm unsure how that happened.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	My daughter brought in some leaves today and decided they needed to be washed.|`|4iXL4C6paa	I would have to say Doras shoes lol|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Cat pee :(|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Not really strange, but I find my husband's little chin hairs in there all the time.  I call them chin pubes.  You know, those little tiny hairs from when a guy shaves.  I can tell he has halfway tried to clean them out, but he never does a very good job.  It irritates me tho!  Thank God for Lysol wipes LOL|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	a stinky, dirty sock,....i was afraid to ask so i just tossed it in the laundry basket   lol
OHq5gSjJaa	He has probably just gotten into a routine of needing to have a bottle when he wakes up in the middle of the night.  With as much as he is eating during the day he should be able to go at the very least 6 hours at night.  (Unless he is teething or something else bothering him).  What I would try doing is at night when he wakes up instead of offering the bottle, go rock him or sway him on your sholder and see if he will fall back asleep.  It may take some time to break the habit but eventually it should help.|`|AHSjo9omaa	My son is 5months and 2 weeks, and He was taking 15oz bottles of formula milk at 10weeks old. I was getting up 3 times in the night to feed him, so my mum suggested mixing:<br>  <br>  1oz baby rice to every 4oz of formula milk and 4oz water.<br>  <br>  He slept through the night the first time i tried it.<br>  <br>  That was at 10weeks,<br>  now hes almost 6months and eats probably 4 jars a day with cows milk for a drink and juice sometimes.<br>  He has slept through ever since.<br>  <br>  But with his last bottle before bed put 2oz of baby rice in it, and buy a medium flow teat if you havent already, and he'll sleep.|`|l0YvaYTDaa	I asked a similar question the other day.  My son is 5 months old and is up all the time.  3-4 times would be heaven in comparison.  He seems to be eating enough...who knows, he might still be hungry.  I'm breastfeeding, but I know that when my son wakes up after feeding him 1-2 hours earlier, half the time he's not hungry (barely sucking etc.).  I'll try anything else before feeding him (i.e. soother, rocking etc.).  I will finally feed him as a last resort if he's still up and crying/fussy.|`|ZmeW2h5kaa	My 8 month old still wakes up 5-8 times a night so 3-4 times sounds good to me!  I guess it is all relative :)  Apparently, our babies are supposed to be able to sleep through the night at this stage but I have heard that it still very common to have a 6 month old still waking up that often.   Check out Dr. Jay Gordon's website about night weaning.  Hopefully, it will work for us.  Good luck!|`|GMQfejxKaa	That does seem like an awful lot for a six month old to be waking up at night. I'm sure he's not hungry he is just used to waking up and getting feed , so that is what he is going to continue to do. Most babies don't just start sleeping through he night out of nowhere you have to teach them . I read a book called "Good night , Sleep tight" and it was really helpful. My seven month old now sleeps from 7:30 at night to 6 or 7 in the morning. I hope this helps you some, good luck!|`|tjLbXhtEaa	mix a little cereal in with his night bottle, he may be Hungry...<br>  worked like a champ for our kids. (they both we doing this @ 3 months nut they weighed 9lbs 3 oz when they were born.|`|c5519f0ed7a867f4c4afd56a3ecd58b1aa	I think it is I have a 5 and 1/ 2 month old and he wakes only once to eat. How much are you feeding him when he wakes?? also may be keep him up more like only one long nap during the day and short after. keep him up like 4 hrs before bedtime he will be tired. good luck glad I am not in your shoes.|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	Sounds pretty normal. My son JUST started to sleep through the night. (hes a yr) It will get better.
DHyUnhS1aa	6 teachers to 200 students.  But each kid has at least one legal guardian.  I'm guessing the fear of being skinned alive by said guardian if word got out they rebelled in the cafeteria probably helps the 6 teachers.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	POWER OF THE ADULT.

bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	I take it that you are going to be married at a Justice of the Peace or City Hall.  There is nothing wrong with letting her dress up and be part of the civil ceremony.  You can even have her carry a little basket of flowers, but not throw the petals.  <br>  <br>  She probably wants to be included so that she feels that you are "marrying" her too and becoming her real Mommy.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I think its more the flowergirl and def not the fact your getting married.|`|fc5KHr6aaa	Even if you are just going to the courthouse, you can buy hew a new pretty dress and let her be there with you. If you already live together and she is okay with that, then I would think that she is fine with you getting married. Explain to her that you love each other and her so much that you want to make it official! I do think she will feel left out if you do not include her at all in the act of getting married. I was a 2nd grade teacher and one of my students ended up in counseling because his dad eloped without him knowing.|`|d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	You answered your own question.. but Ill point it out...<br>  <br>  "said she didn't want us to get married then because we wouldn't "let" her be the flower girl."<br>  <br>  She is six... do you really think she is going to have alterior motives? Maybe at 16, but not 6. <br>  <br>  If you are worried about her feelings. Let her be the flower girl. You dont have to have a big wedding or even like one on TV, Ask her what she would like to do and let her do it. She wants to be PART of the "Married" Seriously tho, you are marrying both of them so it is only fair to let her have a part.|`|CNgVwJgEaa	Aww she's 6, don't worry, it's definately about being flowergirl.<br>  <br>  If you explain to her you'll buy her a lovely gorgeous dress like a princess which she can wear when you get married (on the day take her with you in the dress) then I'm sure it'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!|`|NnXKDZIsaa	My best friend just got married through the JP last month. She was with her partner for 8 years and they decided to get married just a week before they did. They did it spontaneously, and pulled it off. They didn't have much time to organize and even forgot to invite a brother. There was a total of 30 people, family mostly. The cute part was their eldest son, just age 4 self appointed himself as the ring boy. He must of seen this on t.v. or somewhere and assumed his role, even tho they didn't think they needed the flower girl/ring boy part of it all. The ceremony took a total of 10 or so minutes, it was casual and everything think turned out. I would recommend allowing her to be apart of however she would like. Pretty her up and make her feel good. She will remember this at her age, and will be proud. What's the worst that could happen?|`|H6Lc79EOaa	If there's no big wedding, are you going to a courthouse?  Can she at least be there to witness it?  Then she'll see that there is no wedding party that she thinks she's be left out of?

Maybe i just had a really good tech.  either way - looks like it's normal to not see it.|`|kIblsxJQaa	All in all there's not much anyone can say on here that will make you feel better until next week when you have another scan.

Congrats and Best of luck!|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	I know it is really hard hun but all you can do is wait.

I had a scan at 6 weeks 5 days and her heartbeat was seen, so you should know by your next scan hun.    xxx|`|GdSzrtmAaa	Relax and don't stress yourself out. Wait a wk and see what happens.|`|0k5hixiWaa	no need to worry as you are still quite early in pregnancy to see a baby or a heart beat.  They say the best time is the 7-8 week mark to have U/S.  dont worry, if you knew how many women could only see a sac at this stage in pregnancy you would be releived and not worry.  you m/w is right to wait and do another after a week before you start jumping into any conclusions!! Dont worry! - your body and your baby doesnt need worry right now!  try to relax and try to talk to other women - im sure you would feel much at ease...    Wish you the best  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|WPI0Z47saa	That is why your first appointment isn't usually until you are 8 weeks pregnant.|`|4lpJRXYsaa	you have nothing to worry about, most doctors don't like to do an ultasound until 8 or 9 weeks because that is the stage where the heartbeat is heard strong, and the baby is a lot bigger than at 6 weeks. Lets put it this way.... a heart starts to beat at 5 weeks, but it is so small and doctors can only see a heartbeat and not hear one around 6-7 weeks, but can be heard as soon as 8-9 weeks. The yolk sac is like 5 times the size of the baby at this point, but every week the baby grows and the yolk sac gets smaller|`|AA11284789	dont worry they couldnt see mine till i was 8 weeks.....i was worried for 2 weeks!!! cause they tried first at 6 weeks and it was just too early....try and relax, u should be fine.....Best of luck to you|`|L4HQt733aa	Please don't stress yourself out too much about this...I just went through the same exact thing and like you are probably doing, I worried myself sick for a week. The 1st ultrasound showed nothing but the sac. I did the blood work over the next few days and that came back normal.  I went back yesterday for another ultrasound and this time, not only did we see the baby, but also the heartbeat. We couldn't hear the heartbeat yet because it's still early, but we saw it on the monitor. I was very relieved and a little mad at myself for worrying as much as I did. I know that some worrying is normal because it's involving our baby, but don't stress too much like I did. I will keep you in my thoughts because I know exactly what you're feeling right now and I'm sure you'll have better results next week.|`|yOy5OpqFaa	I am very sorry it sounds like a blighted ovum. I had an u/s at 6 weeks and you could see the little circle that was the baby and he had a heartbeat.|`|auDQxiu6aa	when i was 6 weeks and 5 days i went in for my u/s and they couldn't even find my son! its okay sometimes our little peanuts get scared and hide.....believe me when you go to get the other u/s there will be a baby.....they just get scared the first time because of all the noise them things make in your uterus.....and when you go they will try and find the baby's heart beat but sometimes them ancient things can't find them...don't worry so much....it will turn out for the best!
0c30f5fdc0cc17a33e0ba8fe4201b997aa	Why do you feel embarrassed? Most girls know the ups and downs about having their period. I don't usually talk about it with anybody, but I don't feel embarrassed if I'm talking about menstruation with another female. All of us girls understand what it's like. You should embrace that you have someone to speak to and piss and moan to when you're having a rough period.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	every girl has one...theres nothing awkward about it.<br>  its not like shes gonna judge you based on your period.<br>  lol.|`|AA12206581	eh you just have to get over the fact that you are a woman and will have to deal with it. at this point i can talk about periods openly. even if my guy friends ask me, ill answer their questions. ha.|`|jcEtRUVZaa	It's a normal part of life. Think of it this way, your sister has had it for 20 years, she's pretty darn used to it. It's not embarassing to her to talk about it and she doesn't really get that it IS to you.<br>  <br>  Just tell her that you have some questions and you feel weird about asking them. Or, ask here and we'll answer. ;)<br>  <br>  You'll get through this, after a while it will seem old hat to you too.|`|GIs1jMhHaa	In all honesty, it's normal to be embarrassed about those kinds of things, but you have to realize it's natural and just about EVERY girl out there knows what you're talking about, or how you're feeling. Your sister is 34 yeas old, she's going to give you good advice/knowledge. <br>  I'm sure you'll get over it sooner as you get older.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|QSUg9vNLaa	You just got to tell yourself " Its just part of my body.

I'm sure your sister will feel great that you want to go to her with your concerns. <br>  <br>  One suggestion that might make it a little easier - could you e-mail her something along the lines of, "Hey, you know this is embarrassing for me, but I need to ask you some female-oriented questions (period) next time you come over, ok?"<br>  <br>  That may help break the ice and make you feel a little bit more comfortable.|`|fec699811ba6e1b0d043374af7afd151aa	just say hey sis can u tell me a little about the thing that girls get every month|`|aoGh9umlaa	meh...just dont worry about it.

People think they will get ALL the symptoms at once, thats not the case. Symptoms gradually appear over time as your body changes. <br>  <br>  Most people experience PMS-like symptoms and nothing more. So fatigue, sore/swollen breasts, and period-like cramping are the most common. <br>  <br>  The nausea usually appears between 4-6 weeks.|`|9E91O09caa	Duh you could be pregnant.

You would want to be safe rather than sorry, especially when you have a baby on the way|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Yeah, its normal to hurt.  I swear you start getting tighter or something when you're pregnant.  You shouldn't make an appointment for that, just ask at your next prenatal visit.  Ive felt constantly wet the whole time i've been pregnant! LOL|`|VDUDKkRuaa	The discharge is normal. I'm not so sure about pain during sex though. It could have been because you were tight and he reopened you up. I would still call the doctor and ask their advice. As  long as there wasn't any blood you should be fine, but still tell the doctor.|`|DPa5Rxycaa	the whole sex deal is normal....<br>  i would just call your doctor to let him know about the discharge, after sex, the increase in discharge is usually normal|`|uajQrEPQaa	I've had the same experience and there was no issues.<br>  If your worried see you dr because stress isn't good for you.<br>  Always trust your instincts when it comes to your pregnancy.|`|68ce7bd873a8d57e0241369627f2ef71aa	i would call just to be sure.|`|LxnN2hePaa	Yes i would contact a doctor asap and just confirm that the discharge is normal. you may not have to go as far as making an appointment though.

TQScv7Tcaa	LMAO @ Amanda..i dont mean to be rude but i have NEVER heard of a 2.5 month old babies saying ANYTHING but mamamama, dadada, bubububa etc and just because at 2 weeks she is making noises doesnt mean she will be making SENTENCES by 10 weeks. Again im sorry but that is just crazy!!!! <br>  <br>  Anyways my daughter is 17 months and in the past few weeks she has just started putting some things together like....shut the door, my bottle, all gone etc she has also just started saying 1,2,3 and ready setty goooooooo....babies usually won't say sentences until about 18 months - 3yrs. If you repeat phrases often, read the same books over and over again, sing the same songs etc it makes it easier for them to pick up.....i have said 1,2, threeeeeeee to my daughter since she was born (like when i pick her up) and ready, setty, goooooooo aswell and that is why she says them she has no idea she is counting just repeating what i say....good luck and 9 words at 15 months is pretty normal i think :)|`|Z5s5DV6haa	my baby is 2 weeks and she already says mama and dada. im thinking shell be talking in scentences in a couple of months.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	Ya, Amanda is full of it, she has two other accounts and goes around being a troll...

y87oMhEKaa	Just try to hold him as much as you can right now. Honestly, that is the best thing for him. Babies need their mommies when they are that sick. The only advice I can offer is to try and lay him right next to you on your left side so he can feel the warmth of your body and hear your heart beat. As for the fever, you can give him Tylenol but CALL THE PEDIATRICIAN to get the right dosage. Never try to guess that on your own. Good Luck and hope he gets better soon!|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	Let him lay with you or next to you...maybe just not ON you if it bothers you.  Poor lil' guy needs some extra cuddles tonight.|`|7U90RM46aa	Don't put him on you just next to you or if he kicks and nudges then next to your partner. He'll drink when he is thirsty and eat when he is hungry- so don't worry much about that. But you can try to keep the pedia-light in the fridge to cool it off so that it feels better on his throat. Also you can give him a bath with corn starch on the bottom of the tub. It will help his little bottom heal faster and cool that off as well. (You can put some in his diapers to help) <br>  If you must put him in his crib then you might just have to deal with a little crying and maybe even give him something special. <br>  My Mother when I was a kid gave us a stuffed toy she had when she was younger to sleep with only when we were sick. To this day when I am visiting if I get sick I get the stuff animal.  Its just a sign of comfort when Mommy can be there that you are still there in thought through this little toy. So give him something special to cuddle and sit near by until he falls asleep.  Maybe even try to lay him down when he falls asleep next to you. You could even put a soothing soft CD on to play for him. For some reason this will often work well when they are extra tired. Good Luck and I hope he feels better soon.|`|hChhOhOGaa	Is he allergic to milk or some type of food or medication?  Maybe a second opinion/different doctor.

a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	you are doing it right but you missed out very impt detail and that is ovulation. You need to ovulate in-order to conceive and the best way to detect is to monitor your cervical mucus everyday when you wipe. Sometimes it may be dry, creamy, cloudy, milky and abundant. On the day when you feel really wet down there, put some mucus between 2 fingers and feel the texture. Fertile mucus are slippery and very stretchy (kind of like those muscus coming out from your nose, sorry for the TMI), it should be able to stretch more than 2".. you may wan to confirm with ovulation test. It should show positive..

mqHL4UcRaa	It takes approximately 2-3 weeks for your body to go through the fertilization process, implantation process, and for your body to produce a high enough level of the pregnancy hormone to make you feel symptoms or even test for. So about 2-3 weeks after unprotected sex.<br>  <br>  In other words, you would start to notice symptoms around the time of your missed period. People think they will get ALL the symptoms at once, thats not the case. Symptoms gradually appear over time as your body changes. <br>  <br>  The earliest, I would say 1 week before your missed period (IF your in-tune with your body).

Yn2n26zXaa	When dieting, you should never do anything that is harmful enough to hurt your body period. You need to focus on either losing the weight or getting pregnant. Doing both, in my opinion, is just too much stress. Which is more important to you? If you get down to your ideal weight and then get pregnant, you will gain the weight right back and still be facing the body issues you face now. My suggestion, exercise and eat well. Don't stress too much about your weight. You have enough to worry about with getting pregnant. Accept your body now, the way it is, because once you have a baby, it will change forever. And those changes can be even harder to accept than a few extra pounds. As long as you eat well and exercise, you are doing enough. Good luck and remember to enjoy the journey and don't get too caught up in conceiving. Half the fun is making the baby ;)|`|eV5E9MhUaa	There's nothing wrong with walking, and running. Just as long as your not doing any strenuous lifting, or going into a sauna. It's good to exercise and get healthy. Just don't overexert yourself. While your trying to conceive it's good to just act like your all ready pregnant to get your body prepared. Take prenatal vitamins, exercise and start eating right. Good luck!!! :)|`|n6NthDxwaa	Lots of water for starters. Bread, carbs at breakfast are okay, but none after that, or if you have to, take it easy. High protein, lots of green foods. Go w/ mustard in place of mayo. Grandma told me in regards to all dairy " A minute on the lips, forever on the hips!"  And walk, don't take on any serious exercise. Good Luck!!|`|puCOYwMmaa	Eat healthy, lots of fruits and vegetables, high fiber foods to fill you up.  Cut out the junk and processed foods.  Drink only water, not juice or sodas they're just empty calories.  Get 20-30 minimum minutes exercise everyday (even if it's something like taking a walk after dinner or on your lunch hour).
eV5E9MhUaa	Ask your Dr., but I wouldn't take anything like that while I was pregnant.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	skip the kelp & continue taking prenatal vitamins.  speak to your OB about specifics.

Ugh. <br>  Unfortunately I lost the baby at 15 weeks but I got pretty big pretty fast. Some women just show sooner than others.

6eaWRGaqaa	I know you have probably gotten this answer before... but people change in high school. Trust me! Sometimes not for the better. Last year I was so tight with the 8th graders (I was in 7th) and now they never talk to me. Haha. I hope I'm not the same way next year :\<br>  <br>  From your description, I think he is doing all of that "lovey-dovey" stuff in front of you because not only does he want to prove to you that he wants to move on, but he mostly wants to prove to himself that he has moved on.<br>  <br>  I know from experience because I care SO much about this guy who I used to date, like if he were to ask me out again (which he actually has on numerous occasions) I would be freaking out, but whenever I'm around him I make sure to point out that I do have a boyfriend. I want him to realize that I have moved on and I want myself to feel better for wanting to move on. It may sound complicated, but it really isn't.<br>  <br>  It'll take some time to get over him! Trust me... I'm still not over my ex-best friend stealing my crush last year and I'm still not over crushing on that crush that my ex-best friend stole from me. That was a year and a half ago... I've even gone out with three or four guys since. I'm not over any of those guys either...<br>  <br>  I'm sorry this isn't so reassuring but my point is that it'll take time. If you want him to be your friend again, just talk to him! Explain to him what's going on inside of your head. Text him and say "hey, i really liked seeing u this afternoon on the tour! i really miss having u around as my friend... cud we get bac 2 that?" or something like that. Try to use the word 'friend' as much as possible. Let him know that you JUST want to be friends.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)<br>  -Catherine|`|0c30f5fdc0cc17a33e0ba8fe4201b997aa	Just try to move on.

LNnRSLdtaa	sorry but just because a mean teacher says you should act doesnt mean youl actually be good enough for it or get lucky enough <br>  the voice is only a small part of acting<br>  <br>  im not trying to put you down im just trying to be realistic<br>  you said youve never been on a stage before which is going to harm your chances<br>  alot of the stars on tv today where in tv adds when they were 4 <br>  <br>  but if your serious about acting (and its hard work, not just glitz and glam) <br>  get acting lessons <br>  get on a drama course <br>  audition for absolutly anything you can, be it a photoshoot (emotions are often needed for modelling) or a tv advert <br>  <br>  alot of actors who start later in life start with modeling, its something that gets them noticed and is pratice for them <br>  <br>  <br>  also find out if you look good on film <br>  get a friend to record you just talking etc because if you look bad on camera you wont get hired by alot of people|`|qlKcOKC5aa	I think you should definitely give it a try! If your teacher was impressed with your voice and performance, that says a great deal. Theater can be a great way to meet people, an excellent learning experience, and a lot of fun. <br>  <br>  No one says you have to go into acting as a profession. You can always enjoy it during high school, college, and in community theater. There's no harm in giving it a try and seeing if you enjoy it. <br>  <br>  Good luck at your poetry slam and make sure you audition for something soon!|`|a448ILgCaa	can you memorize lines? grab the attention of audience members with one line? can you move and say your lines perfectly at th say time? are you good under pressure? if you answered yes to at LEAST 3 of these then try joining school plays and hit like.|`|AA11296427	Go for it ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|Y4uR2izAaa	just because you have a good voice doesn't necessarily mean you should be an actor and acting is hard man|`|UfOP3xtcaa	You should join Drama that will tell you if you should do acting or not.|`|aoGh9umlaa	ughh...youre the terrorist that made jokes about World War IV....but yeah sure do whatever you want man|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	millions of people aspire to be actors and actresses, only a lucky few make it (weather they have talent or not).

a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	the fertile mucus is similar to those mucus coming out from your nose.. semi-transparent, slippery and very stretchy. (sorry for TMI)when you experience this, it is best to re-confirm with opk, it should be +ve by now. Opk is consider positive when both control and test lines are equal darkness or test line is darker than control line. Are you sure you got a positive last week?
PkUBJMd9aa	Some symtoms that could indicate you are pregnant:<br>  <br>  ‘My periods have stopped’  <br>  The problem is some women’s periods don’t always stop in pregnancy; women have been known to have light periods up until month six, and sometimes even all the way through their pregnancies. And a missed period doesn’t always mean you are pregnant, so further investigations are a good idea.<br>  <br>  ‘My breasts are changing’ <br>  Even before your period is due you may see some changes in breasts. Most women’s breasts become tender before their period is due and the veins on them seem to protrude even more, so your breasts resemble a road map (oh-so sexy). Amazingly, even at this early stage your breasts are changing for milk production. <br>  <br>  ‘I have a little bleeding’<br>  Often mistaken for a period, implantation bleeding, as it’s known, occurs when the fertilised egg arrives in your uterus and embeds itself in your uterine lining. You’ll find you lose a small amount of blood around this time, or just before your period. The blood tends to be reddish to begin with, but then quickly turns brownish. It only tends to last a day or two, so if it does stop quickly this could be a sign.<br>  <br>  ‘I keep weeing’<br>  As soon as your progesterone levels rise and the embryo starts to secrete the hormone HCG, the blood supply to your pelvic area increases, which leads to pelvic congestion. This leads to your bladder becoming irritated, and in the process it tries to expel urine at frequent intervals - even in small amounts. Most women therefore experience a desire to wee more often than usual. This can happen as early as one week after conception. <br>  <br>  ‘I have a strange taste in my mouth’<br>  The saliva in your mouth often reflects the chemical content of your blood and with rising hormone levels the taste in your mouth can change. Women have often described their mouth as having a metallic taste. This can make the taste of certain foods such as tea, coffee or your morning bowl of cereal different from before.<br>  <br>  ‘I have a strange sense of smell’<br>  A strange sense of smell, too, can be a sign that baby is on the way. Strong smells, particularly, such as the smell of brewing coffee or frying onions – even if you loved them before - can suddenly make you feel sick. Perfume can have a similar effect and you may notice the way your perfume smells on your body also changes because of the alterations in your skin’s chemistry.<br>  <br>  ‘I’m craving certain foods’<br>  You suddenly start to crave foods you never even thought twice about before. Many women crave tangy foods such as grapefruits, oranges and lemon juice. Other cravings are more peculiar, such as coal and chalk (this is a condition called pica – and we don’t need to tell you that eating coal is not good for you or the baby, do we?). One theory is that cravings are your body’s response to a deficiency in certain minerals and trace elements. If you crave citrus fruits, for example, you could be deficient in vitamin C – although we don’t know this for sure yet.<br>  <br>  ‘I feel so tired’<br>  You feel completely exhausted throughout the day – like you want to sleep forever, partly due to the high levels of progesterone in your body, which has a sedative effect. During early pregnancy your metabolism speeds up in order to support your developing embryo and your vital organs, which have to cope with an enormously increased amount of work. And the tiredness is probably worse if it’s your second or third baby, when you’re less likely to have a chance to rest.<br>  <br>  ‘I feel sick!’<br>  Not only in the morning, but sometimes all day, although nausea is often worse in the morning mainly because you have an empty stomach and your blood sugar has dropped. Pregnancy sickness has been associated with poorer diets, infrequent meals and stress associated with the pregnancy. The hormone HCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) is probably the most likely cause of pregnancy sickness. <br>  <br>  But at least there’s a positive side to nausea and vomiting in pregnancy - it’s a sign that hormone levels in your bloodstream are high enough to ensure that the pregnancy is well established (although don’t worry if this doesn’t apply to you – some women are lucky enough to sail through their pregnancies without feeling sick).<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck if you are.....and do a pregnancy test!!!<br>  <br>  and i know your probably asking for personal opinions and not medical research i understand...<br>  when i fell pregnant evrything knocked me sick....smoke...brews...toast i had a metal mouth and also i slept for england...these are good signs go and have a test tho hun good luck xxx|`|VeuJB4lEaa	wait until you are due on hun, i have just got my BFP and one of my first signs was the metalic taste, i just cant budge it, not with food or nethin lol...good luck x|`|VMASMHX6aa	If you had a normal period at around the time you expected it, then it is very unlikely you are pregnant.<br>  Do a test just to make sure if you are concerned.
nuTvB84Gaa	It should come back out.<br>  But I would be very careful not to fall asleep with her on you.<br>  Next time make sure to get in a position that she cannot roll around or fall if you do fall asleep.<br>  And make sure that you wouldn't roll over on her.<br>  <br>  And keep rotating her every time she sleeps from side to side and back.<br>  Then it should come back out.<br>  <br>  best of luck<br>  hope i helped :)|`|whROrAhFaa	How old is your baby, unless she is Newborn this should not have happened.<br>  - Mom of 3 in baltimore<br>  <br>  At 3 wks her bones are still very soft, I would definitely take her to the doctor, just to be safe.  And don't feel bad, many parents fall asleep with their newborns, some may not want to admit it though.  It's tough your not sleeping very much, try to make sure to nap when she does to keep from becoming too drowsy.  It could become a dangerous situation.  I'd also suggest getting a "Boppy" pillow, which is supposed to be a nursing pillow but is great for all infants.  You can wrap the pillow around your mid section and she can lay on that while you feed.  I ended up putting the boppy into the port a crib with my second child and she napped on it, ate on it, and played on it.  It works thru learning to sit as well.  Good Luck, I do hope all is well, but I'd not let it worry you too much =)|`|AA12383195	Maybe have a doctor take a look for a proper analysis. You wouldn't want your baby to have suffered further damage, would you?|`|EKDv7HS8aa	That sounds pretty bizarre...Babies get flat heads and what not from sleeping the their back every night...but getting a large dent from taking a nap on your hip sounds pretty odd.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	What!?

cTk9nbvRaa	I understand what you are saying, but if your sister still wants to have your daughter in the wedding, why not let her be?  If you have told her that she may cry, and she still feels like she wants her niece to be a part of the wedding then go ahead and put your beautiful daughter in it!  Just make sure you are nearby in case she does get fussy.  <br>  <br>  Besides I don't think your daughter crying would spoil her wedding at all!  People will probably think it's cute and they won't care at all.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and Im sure your daughter will do wonderfully and look beautiful too!!!|`|TQScv7Tcaa	Surely your sister is aware that she may cry? She is a baby after all and thats what babies do best :) Just tell your sister she is likely to cry and that you dont want it to ruin her day and leave it up to her, if your comfortable with your daughter being in it otherwise then just leave the decision in your sisters hand :)|`|8KZ7HKgvaa	Well 4 month olds cry all the time, and as long as she understands the consequences and you are okay with your daughter sitting in a wagon..

Give up on the idea.  Nice idea though but NOT LOGICAL!|`|1VOsRV8Maa	I would suggest that the one pulling the wagon be you, and that if she starts crying, there will be a designated "babysitter" to take her out of the sanctuary. She could have your baby in the wedding, but would have to have someone on hand for her the whole time in case she has a meltdown in the middle of the ceremony. Preferably the babysitter would be someone who's not necessarily family so if they had to leave the ceremony area, they wouldn't be missing a sister/niece/daughter/cousin's wedding.

2pxiK9waaa	Those are the only things he has control over. When he no longer gets attention from doing them, he's going to stop. When he hits, throws things, bangs his head, he is put in a pack'n play to calm down. That way he gets no attention and you know he's safe. When he makes himself throw up, ignore him and clean him up without looking at him or talking to him. If he does it in his crib, put down a towel and pull up the towel when he pukes and leave the room again.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Well sometimes when teething they jam their fingers down their throat. My son did that (13 months old) and actually did that about 3 weeks ago because it hurt so bad. He also bangs his head on the slider glass door I have when I go out side on the porch I don't know why he does it but he finds it funny. Tearing paper if fun hell I do it sometimes when im bored lol. As for the smacking in the face well that is just to see how far he can push it. He is old enough so I suggest that when he goes to hit you that you grab his had and tell him NO that hurts mommy. then take his hand (when he is calm) and gently rub it to your face and say "NICE,NICE". Eventually he will get that you need to be nice. I did that with my now 2 year old and he is teaching his brother lol. You have to be stern with children not mean but stern because if they are allowed to run all over you, they will. I hope this can help you. Good luck<br>  -Tyffannie mother of 2 year old and 13 moth old boys who are overall well behaved|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	Take control and show him who the parent is.  Tell him each time he does wrong (in a nice and calm manner) what he did wrong and put him on a time out chair or in the corner.  Do that for 1 minute (1 minute per year of age).  Each time he hits, smacks, etc. time out.  If he is doing wrong you have to be consistent.  Not yell from another room or say stop and not follow through with the time out, etc.  He is lashing out for attention and seems to be doing it in drastic ways.  Talk to his dr and see what they can suggest.  Create a sticker chart and encourage good behavior and dont show anger or drama when he lashes out.  Pretty soon he will do better because he knows you praise him for it.|`|aYCjy8Neaa	Chances are he's just exploring. My son used to always put his fingers down his throat and gag himself. It was a phase he got out of. And he also bangs his head on the wall because he thinks it's funny. A all kids tear things apart, especially boys. They like to see what they can get away with. My little guy is very ddestructive I wouldn't worry too much, sounds like he's completely normal to me.|`|mtOVRAnbaa	I agree with the answers below.. He knows in doing this it probably gets a reaction out of mommy and thats probably what he is going for.. Just ignore it.. He'll stop and hopefully find a more postivie way to gain mommy & daddys attention =) good luck and god bless|`|H2l7tFFHaa	That's normal for a 2year old! But you need to discipline him for hitting you so he will learn that it not ok to hit others. Avoid giving him sweets!|`|1999a48b2a09871cc4c7474323cbd854aa	The sticking the fingers down his throat, banging his head, and tearing paper apart is pretty normal. Ever kid goes through that stage of trying to get attention, so try ignoring him when he bangs his head on the wall or sticks his fingers down his throat. Kids love to tear paper, they just do. Just like when you buy them a toy, they are going to play with the box. The smacking and pinching is unacceptable. You need to decide which route of discipline you want to use and then practice it. So if you are going to try time outs, then be consistent with it. Don't give him a time out once and then slap him the second time. He needs boundaries, but at this age...simple ones. Good luck!!|`|y87oMhEKaa	These are very normal things. My son went through all of those things. He will grow out of it. Just make sure to not make a big deal about it because he will see that he is getting a reaction out of you and continue to do it. But make sure he knows that it's not ok to hit or pinch. That is the only thing I would try to stop now while he's this young. As for everything else, he will grow out of it.|`|3MFkp3WJaa	My son is always sticking his fingers down his throat and making himself throw-up banging his head on the wall...tears paper apart smacks me in the faces pinches he is only 16 months im so lost<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.iseestupidpeople.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iseestupidpeople.net/</a>|`|nrGsxWw3aa	My 2 year old bangs his head on the floor when he doesn't get his way.

QvoPb2SBaa	I had a similar problem, only the poop was never very green. My breastfed son had streaks of blood in his poop and sometimes a little mucosy. Very much like when you sneeze and your phlegm/snot comes out with a little streak of blood. He had an intolerance to soy that I was consuming and then passing on through breastmilk. Its rare, but it happens. Take him to a pediatrician and ask if thats possible. <br>  <br>  I stopped eating dairy and soy for 2 weeks-3 weeks (until there was no more blood in the poop and the color wasn't greenish). Then reintroduced dairy (I suspected it was soy instead of dairy cause he started getting it when I had consumed a large amount of soy) for 2 weeks. Then tried soy and his poop had blood again. So soy was the culprit. For formula (for days when you don't want to breastfeed, use Nutramigen or Allimentum).<br>  <br>  I would rule out an infection cause the blood work and stool culture came back fine, but check with a pediatrician. The good thing is that he's eating, pooping and peeing fine, so he's intaking nutrients.<br>  <br>  oh yeah, my son was colicky for 4.5 months. Good luck!|`|teptsmeKaa	Couldn't know for certain, and I think your doctor is disregarding it a bit to much... As one person commented, you should bring the diaper along with you to show next time maybe? <br>  I did look it up on the internet for you though, and I came across a useful site maybe you'd like to check out. It answers what may be causing blood in an infants stools.<br>  It said it may be consitpation, blood from breastfeeding, or intussusception (an internal blockage of some kind). More in-depth on the site.<br>  Did your doctor have an ultrasound preformed? X-rays may not find everything.|`|0rpN2419aa	The only thing I can suggest, is to take a diaper with you again, especially if you see blood streaks in it.  That isn't normal.  Stool does change color occasionally, but the blood does concern me.|`|khFGiA1iaa	This sounds like maybe something you are eating is irritating his bowels and maybe he is allergic to something. Look at this website. It is at babycenter.com<br>  I'm not sure what exactly to tell you, but I went to this website, typed in your question, and people with similar problems had answers from their doctors. The stool coloring and the blood in it seem to be because of foods you are eating. The link I found is about a 9 week old baby, but same situation. Here is the link:<br>  <a href="http://www.babycenter.com/400_my-9-weeks-old-babys-stools-got-some-blood_2370484_165358938974.bc" rel="nofollow">http://www.babycenter.com/400_my-9-weeks...</a><br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and good luck!<br>  <br>  Jessica|`|irHF6CBPaa	I can't help with the stool but I will tell you get a knew DR one that pays attention to your baby I don't think bloody stoll is at all normal So look around for a DR that accepts your insurance|`|5XwY9aP8aa	Definitely change doctors.<br>  <br>  Although, when both of my step kids had ear infections (18 months and 3 years old) they had the green stool.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Then it's time to find a new doctor who will refer you to a pediatric gastric specialist.|`|xue72D76aa	I would seek a second opinion.  I do know that green stool can be indicative of an infection working its way through the system.  My daughter had a virus when she was 5 weeks old and it started with projectile vomiting and ended with bright green stool with traces of blood in it.  She still occassionally has a green or greenish stool and it's usually when we've noticed behavioral differences with her (crankier than usual for example).  As for the blood, it could be something irritating the stomach or intestinal lining.  Another possibility is that it is your blood - are your nipples chapped at all from breastfeeding?  This was a possibility a doctor raised to me when my daughter had the blood in her stool, so I thought it worth mentioning here.  I hope things clear up soon and you find out what's going on!

RwoN3E9Uaa	I'm listening to my daughter on the monitor right now making sleepy noises, she rarely is quiet all night long.  Occasionally for a nap she will sleep like a log but it is rare.  Sometimes she does wake herself up by rolling around in her crib.  When she was learning to crawl she would crawl in her sleep, lol!|`|jNQbVDHSaa	let them be, it is normal with babies. sounds like u have twins|`|1VOsRV8Maa	I wish I could help, but I can't. My 8 month old son sleeps like a log. He sleeps so deep and quiet sometimes it scares me. I don't know if he makes noises after I fall asleep with my hubby in the other room, cause we don't keep a baby monitor on. He usually sleeps pretty good and I'll wake up if he does. Mama instinct? I guess so! :)
eV5E9MhUaa	Being sick has been known to throw off your cycle, but highly unlikely. Wait another week, and then retake the test. Or, she could just go to the Dr. right now and get a blood test to be totally sure. Having sex can't mess up your hormonal cycle.

bOsk4ih4aa	My daughter is also three months old. She's been sleeping through the night since about 5 weeks old. I HIGHLY recommend the book called: On Becoming Baby Wise<br>  <br>  I'm a new mother and this book has been a huge help in the sleep department! I have a friend and her son is 14 months old and she's still getting up 5x a night with him. Ugh. I cant even imagine how awful that would be. <br>  <br>  Anyway, the jist is this....make sure you and you baby have a routine. The book mentions this pattern to help you get your child on a schedule. Feed your child and THEN allow for playtime. Followed by a nap. Don't feed your child to put him to sleep. This will help you establish good Feed/Wake/Sleep habits. <br>  <br>  Also, if you want to try something I found online here's a website:<br>  www.thebabysleepcoach.com|`|uPywMyqAaa	My baby is 5 months and I'm still having trouble with his sleep pattern, he won't sleep until after midnight no matter what I do, he's always been a night owl. <br>  There is no set time, just because you have been told by your midwife or read it in a book does not mean it will happen to your baby, all babies are different. They will eventually start to sleep through when they are ready, but I wouldn't put cereal in his bottle.|`|I9BbQ5Qmaa	my daughter is 3 1/2 months old, i give her a bath, bottle then bed by 7, for the first few nights i had to keep going in to give her, her dummy, but now she knows the routine she goes to straight to sleep and sleeps till 7|`|zPYyGw8oaa	Dont put cereal in his bottle, ask your doc if it is time and if so use a a spoon.

I understand totally your frustration. I was told shell grow out of it once she starts eating more, but alas im still waiting|`|WlU3NFu6aa	Not all babies sleep thru the night at 3 months. My baby started sleping thru the night at 13 months. Its only been a few weeks since it started, and still she doesnt sleep all the way thru every night. Just most nights|`|c5519f0ed7a867f4c4afd56a3ecd58b1aa	It doesn't go for all babies, some just wake until their 1 or even older. If he sleeps your one of the lucky ones. I have a 5 1/2 month old and he sleeps by 9 pm wakes either at 1am or 3 am to eat and then sleeps until 7am. so I am here with you but I am glad he isn't at that stage anymore!! wait for him to get older he should sleep longer.
2TrHH0rkaa	Aleigha-I prefer this spelt Aaliyah or Aliyah.Ahleya is another option although it's a little confusing to spell. Aaliyah Rose would sound gorgeous.<br>  <br>  Cheyenne-I really like this name. Cheyenne Rachelle would be very pretty although possibly a little long.

QM2UqZmuaa	Cats and dogs stop getting milk from their moms and venture onto catfood and dogfood just in the same way human babies start off as breastfeeding and then venture on into human food.<br>  <br>  Or do you think breastfeeding your babies should be done permanently? As with animals?|`|eu6UQElYaa	Most cats and dogs do nurse until they are old enough to be weaned.  To say that they should nurse all the time instead of eating dog food is more like saying you should still be nursing from your mother as a teenager or adult.   Dog food isn't really like formula (they have actual puppy and kitten formula), it's more like solid foods for older children and adults.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	No, because those animals have been weaned from their mum and no longer need milk for nourishment.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	You are ignorant.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Puppies and kittens do nurse from their mothers  (just like all mammals)........

All they do is throw junk in formula, just like they only throw junk in pet food.|`|irHF6CBPaa	Report this Troll!!!!|`|nhgQKvwEaa	When kittens get old enough, they're able to eat kitten food, then cat food. They no longer need milk when they get bigger. That's like saying should an adult breast feed from their mom even when they're grown. Cats don't nurse cats, they nurse kittens.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Amanda-Seriously??? Do you have NOTHING better to to??? You really must be bored.|`|vCWVimTzaa	umm..cats and dogs are different from people and their young nurse for as long as they need and then they usually learn "hunting" type behavior through play with their litter mates. The reason kittens and puppies stay with their mom for 6 to 8 weeks after birth is so that they can nurse. But when they are older they eat food. like you eat food and you no longer nurse. Different species need to care for their young differently...human babies need a lot of care for longer...thats why we have one or two babies instead of 8 at a time. This is kind of a ridiculous question.

If she did an ultrasound in the begining then the chances of her being to far off too far are pretty slim. But you never know. As far as when your period would have been, depending on when you ovulated could change that date. I ovulated 3 weeks after my period instead of too. And when shooting for maternity leave, that's hard to say. I mean the baby could always come weeks early or weeks late, that's the joys of being pregnant! Good luck!|`|EKDv7HS8aa	The 40 weeks would start from the first day of your last period. If you dont know it then they have to estimate. It should be relatively close.

ZDqdYhdGaa	My step father did this to me a couple times. I am a single mother and live in another state, so obviously he don't support me, he was just trying to get more money back. Your son needs to contact the IRS and explain (you should be around to back him up when he calls) that his father is not supporting him. <br>  <br>  Since he is above the age of 18, the child support order is no longer in effect and your ex doesn't have right to claim him anymore unless he IS supporting him, which isn't the case. <br>  <br>  Once the IRS gets the information, they will readjust your husbands tax return and he will have to pay the money back. Your son will then be able to file his. Contact the IRS asap to start the process of straightening it out. Let your ex know that he is no longer allowed to claim him legally and that you will be contacting the IRS to reverse it. He can re-file himself (my step-dad did when I called him out) and avoid the IRS investigating the situation, or he can argue with you about it and let the IRS get involved in which case he will lose and possibly end up in trouble or fined some fee's. <br>  <br>  Oh and the way that the system works, your son cannot claim himself until your ex's tax return is corrected. You have to undo what he has done (by contacting the IRS, or your ex undoing it himself) in order for your son to be able to claim himself.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|AA11021960	As long as your son was supporting himself and no one could claim him as a dependant, then he can claim himself.  If the father was paying child support during the year that your son was 18 (even if it was only for a couple weeks), then your X can claim him because he paid out on him during that year.  Next yr your hubby will not be able to claim him unless he is supporting him.  <br>  If your hubby had not paid any child support, school tuition, med insurance or anything else out toward the support of your son in the 2008 yr, then he wouldn't have been able to claim your son.  <br>  If that is the case then you can go to an accountant (not HR Block or some other expensive hack-those aren't accountants by the way) - go to a licensed accountant and that person can file to have your sons refund returned to him.  But, he would have to prove that his father had not paid out anything during the year.  <br>  BTW-licensed accountants (cpa's) are actually cheaper than HR Block and are far more knowledgable on your taxes.  When you go to HR Block and the like, you are pretty much just paying for the person to open computer software (that you can buy at the store) and input your info for you.  You can do that at home for free, well, except the cost of the software, like TaxPro.<br>  Anyway, I would call a cpa (certified personal accountant) and ask this exact question.  They will answer it for free and then you know you have an educated answer from someone who knows the laws on it.<br>  Good Luck, I hope this helped!!|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	If your ex is not sending any support, then he can't claim him.|`|87WOSjwgaa	Contact the IRS and they will send you a form to fill out. It will take the money away from your ex husband. I am assuming you are the parent he lives with, so your ex has no right to claim him. You can also go on the IRS website to read up on it! You actually have to fill out a form for your ex to even claim him! Follow up and dont let him have the money!|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I don't think that the father should have claimed him since your son is an adult now and does not live with his father. Your son should have been able to file without anyone claiming him.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	If you are supporting him, then you do.  Your ex's rights ended when your son graduated high school.  You claim him, and let your ex deal with the IRS.

Um... Maybe you don't know, but when a baby can sleep 12 hours without food, it's HEALTHY! Read this nice little book called "The Baby Sleep Solution" It teaches you how to feed your baby enough during the day so they have enough to sustain them specifically for a 12 hour period! My baby's been sleeping 12 hours straight since 3 months old! Just cause you have 2 kids doesn't mean anything! By the way, even at 3 months, you can indeed give your baby a little bit of cereal. I would start with a little in the morning, and a little during her last feeding of the evening. You most likely will see changes in her sleep pattern! Good luck!|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Uhh, I would wake up hungry and pissed off if I went almost 12 hours with out eating.  It is best for your baby to wait until she is at least 6 months before you give her anything other than breast milk and or formula.  Also rice cereal offers no nutritional value, I suggest waiting until she is old enough to sit up and feed her something healthier for her:)<br>  <br>  "**Baby's intestines need to mature.  While cereal may indeed make your baby feel full, it could be causing other problems. Before the fourth month, a baby's tender digestive system simply isn't equipped to handle solid foods of any sort. In fact, feeding solids too early can lead to problems with food allergies, pulmonary difficulties (from inhaling tiny bits of cereal into their lungs), constipation, and other tummy troubles. Some experts also worry that starting solids too soon might contribute to obesity later in life because a baby learns to take in calories that she doesn't need. That extra cereal is also not likely to help her sleep: Studies show that infants given rice cereal will start to sleep through the night no earlier than those who are exclusively breast or formula fed. Add all that evidence up, and it's clear that adding cereal to your baby's bottle is a bad idea. <br>  <br>  **And supplemental water? Also not a good idea right now, unless your baby is constipated (look for hard stools that cause pain or bleeding) and your doctor has advised you to offer her a bit. Remember that your breast milk is the perfect food for your baby, giving her all the nutrients and fluids she needs. Filling her tiny belly with water can sabotage her appetite for the good stuff, which, in turn, can mess with your milk supply (remember that what you make depends completely on how much she demands). <br>    <br>  If your baby really doesn't ever seem to be getting enough to eat, but she's still gaining weight as she should be and keeping up a normal output of soiled and wet diapers, it might be that she's going through a growth spurt that's making her extra hungry (growing takes energy!). Don't worry; your milk supply will soon catch up! If you still have questions about when to start solids, talk to your pediatrician, who will know what's best for your baby."-http://www.whattoexpect.com/first...<br>  <br>  <br>  CMU, wtf? Did I even offend you? I AM aware at this age babies should be sleeping a lot something like 16-18 hours a day and it's fine if they sleep 12 hours in a row but why would anyone be surprised if they wake up hungry? Thanks for informing me on your "nice little book", I guess BUT at 3 months my children were being breast fed on demand(best for them) during the day and I didn't mind getting up at night to nourish them when/if they needed it. Me putting "mommy of 2" under sources wasn't supposed to "mean anything" other than "mommy of 2" and just "cause" you read some baby sleep book doesn't mean you know everything. I am just a mom offering my advice as asked, If someone doesn't like it that's fine there are plenty of other responses for her to read:)  I personally want the best for my children so my advice is always in the child's best interest not always what is easiest for the mom....<br>  <br>  Chris915 are you kidding?! lol!  It is a "proven fact" that formula is the same as breastfeeding or just as good?! haha  I would love to see that article on a reputable website!  Don't get me wrong obviously if a women is drinking, doing drugs not eating healthy, or whatever formula would definitely be a better choice.  It is however a proven fact breastfed babies have higher IQ's, less likely to die from SIDS, less likely to deal with depression, lower chance of obesity, lower risk of high cholesterol and heart disease and a ton of others.  I guess all this research is wrong???  Don't think so.  Try doing some research on webmd.com or aap.com(American academy of pediatrics)|`|smcWIZxPaa	i started my son on rice cereal at 3 months, the doctor told me it would be alright seeing as a bottle wouldn't satisfy him and he was wetting through diapers like crazy from all the formula he was taking in.  I would say that she sounds ready.  Just ask your doctor, just make sure it is kind of runny because its hard for them to digest it at first and they can get constipation and gas.  Get some mylicon gas drops if she gets really fussy.|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	Usually the doctors have you start them at 5 months. I don't know about where your at but here we can't start our daughter on rice until she is 5 months. But there is some formula that has rice in it and i had to give my second baby that cause he started doing the same thing at 3 months also. But i would talk to your child's pediatrician before starting baby on rice this early just to be sure its ok.|`|qx4F2SJmaa	Start now.<br>  <br>  But make sure you water it down to start, as it can cause constipation!<br>  <br>  Why the thumbs down? People are so dumb.|`|TLjNUJHLaa	It's not recommended till 4 months. If she's still hungry just give her more milk.|`|whROrAhFaa	I have a few things I'd like to say, all of it is my opinion and the opinion of my ped.  To begin with lots of dr's disagree on many points, some think it's okay to give cereal early some say no.  Some believe children can have ADD/ADHD some say no, so whose right??  I'm sure everyone thinks their docs are but my son was only 2 months (9 wks) and the dr had me put cereal into his bottles (all of them) as he was suffering with infants reflux.  The recommended time to start is GENERALLY 4 months but ALL BABIES ARE DIFFERENT.  The back of the "Gerber Rice Cereal" box says that cereals and 1st foods are fine with "assisted" sitters, 2nd foods and mixed cereals are for babies sitting on their own.  All 3 of my kids have been on by 3 months, including my 4 month old who not only has cereal in the am but cereal with fruit in the evenings.  She only sleeps for 6 hours at a time at night, and always has.  The cereal changed nothing.  Your baby may take it and may not, if she'll eat off a spoon I'd def try, if she gets an upset stomach stop and wait a few more wks.  I think the only difference you'll see is the weight gain as most babes do put on the cheeks when they start the solids =)<br>  **Happy mom of 3 in baltimore<br>  <br>  And I did notice you said her "BOTTLE" not breast, as for the comment about the breast being best, actually it is a proven fact that formulas are now made with the SAME nutrients, without the chance of passing along every chemical adults are eating in everyday food and drinks. =)|`|0gAQ7lkGaa	I gave my daughter rice cereal at 3 months. She was just like your baby. She got very hungry soon after a bottle of 6.5 ounces. I called her Dr and she said to give her the cereal. I gave her a little in the morning mixed with formula about a half hour after her morning bottle then again at bedtime. She's 5 months now and still eating cereal ( now mixed with stage 1 fruits) and she's sleeping 9-10 hours a night! <br>  Best of luck!|`|AA11435162	My pediatrician says to wait until my baby is four months old.  My baby always seems hungry and she takes 6oz every 3 hrs.  She cries a little when she is through with the bottle but then she is fine.|`|GMQfejxKaa	Depends on your baby, I would probably hold off until atleast four months, but if you think she is ready you could ask her doc.|`|gvdoMC1baa	My pediatrician gave me the ok to start my 3 1/2 month old on rice cereal.

Really! Its great and ALL that you are such an advocate for breastfeeding, however, not all moms can and some choose not too and regardless either way its none of your business. Why does it bother you so much that some moms do not breastfeed? The only thing that should even remotely matter is if the baby is healthy, thriving, and growing properly....You really need to lay off of the mothers who cant or choose not to breastfeed. Its none of your business whatsoever! This is a place where people are should be free to ask questions without being judged like a immature person like you!  P.S- I formula fed my Daughter and she is healthy, thriving, and growing wonderfully!|`|KwBF3WvGaa	The doctors say 1 year is best!

rhPCJfeuaa	First of all, you don't say how old your son is which makes a huge difference.  Secondly, why in the world does he think this is normal?? And, thirdly, did the girl get upset or were they just being curious together?  I don't think this is going to be a slight slap on the hand, either way.  Most schools have zero tolerance for things like this, so there is a good chance he may get expelled.  Own up to it, and profusely apologize and see if there is a deal that can be worked out where he speaks with the counselor for a while on a regular basis.  I would even go so far as to suggest you take some parenting classes so that you feel more confident about setting limits about personal space and other issues that will come up over the next several years.  Good luck.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	It is your job to teach your son to keep his hands to himself. It doesn't matter if he thinks its normal because its not. He violated the girl.<br>  <br>  How old is your son? If hes in 6th grade or above he could be expelled. You can't just go around touching people inappropriately.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	how old is he? if he is like in first grade then thats just what kids do, but any older then that and he should know better and that is up to the parents to teach their children about that|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	If you son touched a girl's private parts, there is no good way.  Your son was wrong and you need to address this situation before it escalates in expulsion and consoling sessions.<br>  <br>  You need to teach your son to keep his hands to himself and to respect other peoples personal space.  Hopefully, if you son is in Kindergarten, it will be just a talking to.  If he is older, expect time a suspension.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	Tell the school that you will talk to him, and make sure he knows that touching other peoples private parts (boy or girl, you might have to be specific for him to understand) is inappropriate.  <br>  <br>  It all depends on his age, but if its his first offense they'll probably let you handle it at home. If he does it again, be prepared for a MUCH harder punishment.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	You don't say how old he is.<br>  And why haven't you taught him that it isn't normal|`|52cc7aea6be5f841604eaa406ced87e2aa	Well first of all if he thinks it's normal then you need to reinforce it that it's bad for him to do it to others and it's not good if someone does it to him. You have to teach him that it's very inappropriate and that touching people at all is not right in any place if they don't tell you it's okay. You should remind him just to keep his hands off other people period and teach him the no-no private zones as well. The school probably just wants to evaluate you and him together in a setting and see what's going on. They might offer counseling which might not be a bad idea. But the best lessons come from home. If he's really young then it's not likely that they are gonna take him to jail but he needs to understand that this wrong. Good luck!!!|`|8SjoUQmEaa	Well, my mom is a day care provider and a 4 year old boy touched a 4 year old girl "inappropriately" and it got blown way out of proportion.

I can't think of any reason to need to know when my kids were no longer virgins.  I suppose it's because I feel that is a personal issue between them and their future spouse.  I say unless they come right out and ask you if you are a virgin that there is no need to tell them.  The person who may more likely want to know is the person you eventually marry.  Actually, most parents aren't as out of touch as you might think.  I can probably pretty accurately guess when each of my older 3 lost their virginity and to who.  My youngest is still on the fence between thinking boys are gross and being attracted to them.|`|Lftu0e4Daa	If they don't need to know then I wouldn't tell them. I lost my virginity at the age of 15 and after 4 months of having sex I received a STI called a UTI (urinary tract infection). I kept it a secret from my parents because I thought that it was an STD since a UTI has the same symptoms as another STD, I can't remember which one it is,. Anyways my mom found out when I had to go get a physical to join my school's sports team, I had an excessive amount of nitrates in my urine and so I had to go to the hospital for pills to get rid of the infection. My mom knew it was from sex (it was protected though, the condom broke and the ripped latex must have caused some sort of irritation)  but she told my dad that I could get it from anywhere. My dad knows that I'm not a virgin anymore but I'm not sure how long it took him to find out or how he found out. Unless you are pregnant or have an STD/STI you really shouldn't have to tell your parents, but if you do then you should tell your parents, I could have seriously hurt myself if my mom found out later than she did, thankfully I was ok.|`|T3T9geFiaa	I'm 15 and not a virgin.

hzgFAJv0aa	Dear Kangaroo,<br>  <br>  There really isn't much of a difference. Different states use both terms for the same role. CASA stands for Court Appointed Special Advocate and GAL stands for Guardian ad Litem ("guardian at law").<br>  <br>  Both terms can apply to either a specially trained volunteer or to an attorney. Both are appointed by the Court. Some states require CASA/GALs to be attorneys and others do not. <br>  <br>  Both of CASAs and GALs are supposed to represent and protect the rights and best interests of minors (or other people such as the mentally disabled) to the Court, both are given limited investigative powers and are held under strict confidentiality rules. (One of their slogans is :  " Be the voice of a child in Court"They have acess to DSS, Court, school, limited medical/therapy records and other evidence pertinant to the case. They are usually required to visit their client and to attend CPD/DSS meetings, etc.and they are allowed to interview family, co-workers, neighbors, etc. They are required to submit reports to the Court for consideration and make recommendations about what might be the best course of action for their client(s). They may be called as witnesses, may testify on behalf of their clients and may (or have their lawyer - volunteers are usually assisted by staff attorneys) subpoena witnesses and information to support their reports and recommendations. <br>  <br>  Both programs are run under the National CASA Organization.<br>  <a href="http://www.casanet.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.casanet.org/</a><br>  <br>  ETA: Yes, unfortunately some state's laws are very lacking in requiring the CASA/GAL to do their jobs or be held accountable for their mistakes. <br>  <br>  I was very close to all of my GAL clients and am still in touch with many of them years later.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	A GAL is a guardian ad litem, or guardian for the litigation.  In my district, a GAL is always a lawyer.  Some judges do not even require that the GAL's ever meet the children.  <br>  <br>  As a CASA, I knew the child(ren) very well.  I was very involved in their case.|`|ETcBRko3aa	In my state a CASA is a volunteer that is NOT a lawyer and the GAL is a lawyer.  But, both look out for the best interests of the child.<br>  Sometimes in this case, the GAL is also called the "Child's Attorney."<br>  <br>  In some states, CASA  and GAL mean the same thing and neither has to be a lawyer.  They look out for the best interest of the child.
00XBwf1Haa	They are both fine . Just make sure the bassinet is in your bedroom so you can see & hear the baby.  Bassinet has a weight limit, check that.

Seriously.|`|2pxiK9waaa	Depends on the age of the child. As soon as an infant can roll over, a bassinet is no longer considered to be safe. A crib is considered safe from birth until well into toddlerhood. The age depends on weight and the ability of the baby to climb.|`|JvM44Bx5aa	It's up to your baby's age.  Bassinet or crib should be carefully considered for your baby's comforting and sleeping well.  Once your baby is able to roll over by himself or herself, at three or four months of age, it is no longer safe for the baby to be left in a bassinet as he or she could tip himself or herself out, so your baby must use a baby crib instead.<br>  <br>  You can find some special prices of bassinets or cribs here below:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/fisher-price-bassinet-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/fisher-price-ba...</a><br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/da-vinci-convertible-baby-crib-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/da-vinci-conver...</a>|`|rjVALevtaa	Either one is fine.

sr7jX2wYaa	My  Opinion is  if  more people  were  like you & showed a little more compassion to children at  a young age & they knew that someone  really cared  a lot them would have their lives  turn out differently. I realize  the  reason  most  do not  feel it is appropriate, and  depending  on the  situation & type  of  hug I might agree, but  what you are doing  for these children  is something  they probably  have  very little of, & that is a simple caring  gesture. & I commend you for it. I hope  others  realize  that as well.*|`|AA10620596	I have to throw out my story here too. I am a student teacher, and one of our rules for the classroom is that we are not allowed to touch the children AT ALL. It is the most horrible rule I have ever heard. The class I am in is 3rd graders, and most of the others in our group are either Kinder or 1st grade! <br>  <br>  Knowing that children are in need of touch (after all, it is on Maslow's list of our basic needs), I asked what to do in the situation you describe. I was told that we have to back out of the hug and tell the child that we are not allowed to do that. I am so upset by this. I know many children who do not get any affection at home, and I can't imagine what their lives must be like to not get any at school either. We are a society of idiots when we let people dictate to us how to act around every person with whom we come into contact. There will be restrictions on WHO we can talk to next. <br>  <br>  So obviously my opinion on your hug is that it was just fine, and that is what the child needed. If a Kinder student asked if you were his girlfriend, most likely it was one of those typical silly kid moments, and it didn't mean anything. I think its great that our kids can feel comfortable with hugging their teachers, and I think we should encourage it, just in the way you have been doing. Keep up the good work!|`|jiwTWNNtaa	Teachers should be able to hug kids without fear.<br>  Today sucks.<br>  Hugs are good.|`|WW5Xp6ofaa	WHAT THE HELL. If these kids are getting abused first off tell the freaking police. Second of all hell yes these kids need loving. So hug them. Wtf that little boy was just confused, you can hug any kid up to 5th grade like that. Their just little kids. But since you don't care enough to hug them call social service. Because either way their still getting hurt at home. And that's unacceptable.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	:(  I hugged my teachers ALL the time as a little kid.<br>  <br>  It sucks that now a days teachers have to be so scared to hug their students.|`|mygpnrK1aa	It's too bad that a few disturbing pedophile teachers have ruined a warm-hearted touch between a teacher and a student. I teach elementary children, and I have several kids that come up to me on a daily basis and hug me. We don't have a hands-off policy of any sort, but my own personal policy is to give a one-armed hug (kind of around their shoulders). Teachers spend so much time with the children, and it's only natural that some of them want to hug or be hugged by their teachers. Since your school has a policy, however, you should abide by it. Maybe the first day you are in the classroom, set a standard signal for a hug. Like drawing a heart in the air, or giving a hug in sign language. But there's nothing like a good old-fashioned hug.|`|unLTNlnFaa	I personally don't think there is anything wrong with hugging your students, especially since they are young. Children need love and attention, and since they are not getting it at home, they will go to you for it because they trust you and respect you. If the students were older, I could see it being a little awkward if you were to go around hugging them, but they are just children, so hug away :]|`|FHiZ0a6Uaa	You know its a shame when we can no longer hug kids when they need it, this is another example of  stupidity in some of  today's parents. They take every thing to the extreme so that even hugging is considered sexual harassment. My gosh, how did we ever get in the shape we are in. 4 or 5 year olds can't even give hugs to their friends or even their grandparents without it being taken way out of content.|`|n336SjRiaa	I honestly think there is absolutly nothing wrong with hugging small children, it isn't weird to them, and they need someone to hug. a student is only as good as his/her teacher. inspire them. be the best you can be for the children. think about why you wanted to teach in the first place.|`|Tcvlxw7yaa	hugging doesnt nesessarially mean your clingy... jus yu feel comfertable enogh with that person and like them enogh to hug them... sometimes yu really need a hug or it is jus comferting to that person... its normal... as long as it doesnt get touchy fealy (i yu kno what i mean) then its fine|`|BgRGlU9jaa	In this situation that should be totally allowed.<br>  Clearly these kids need someone to show them<br>  that they care. That was very wrong for them<br>  to ask you if you were his girlfriend. If the kids <br>  are clingy just try your best to let them know <br>  you care without hugging them if hugging <br>  happens to be a problem in this school.
NRHHHrcaaa	Unfortunately, this is normal! I am going through this with my 25 month old. She just started in the last couple of weeks and it is getting to be unnerving! I catch myself getting upset at her for getting upset at other things....this ISN'T the way to help! As long as I stay calm and speak normally to her, she will usually get over it quickly. My problem is that I have the wonderful habit of running late to important appointments and she WON'T let me carry her! It takes at least 3 times as long to get anywhere. But, the whiny and constantly wanting attention could be coming from some stress in the home? Did you recently move? Are you expecting another child? Are you having relationship problems? Or financial stresses? Children can sense feeling that you have and she may be reacting by being clingy.<br>  Hope I helped!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	hold her more often -that will solve the clinginess -invest in a backpack.  ignore the whining so that it doesn't become a behavioral trait.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	It is normal. When my son was that age he was all like that too. It's a stage all you can do is try to explain to them that the world is not based on her wants.
FHiZ0a6Uaa	Amen to that . . .  I get so tired of seeing kids 6,7, or 8 years of age having a temper fit in the store. Mine did this one time only & the reason he did it one time only is I spanked his butt right there in front of everyone. If they want to embarrass me in public then I don't mind embarrassing them either. Our children are going to hell in a hand basket because they no longer are disciplined by anyone & they are becoming a very rude next generation.|`|C0GpfPYOaa	There's nothing more annoying than manic screaming brats running around in the supermarket, unless they're in front of you at the checkouts.<br>  People don't just hit or trip or push (or whatever) kids in supermarkets- well, other people's kids- for no reason. It's common courtesy to the community to teach your kids how to behave appropriately in public.<br>  I could go on, but I'm going to the supermarket in a minute.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	I've never had to do it with my kids, but I've wanted to with others. Parents today think it's cute when their brats knock over stuff in the stores, or run around like animals in a zoo. If they are not willing to discipline them, they shouldn't have kids.|`|CiK4WrSsaa	You Really are the scum of the earth. you should be buring in hell. you attack kids just for running around. if you come across someone smart you would walk away severly handicapped, the way you deserve to be.|`|Q68wyCuMaa	Are you kidding me?<br>  IT'S NOT YOUR KID TO HIT, IT'S NOT YOUR KID TO DISCIPLINE AND DO THEIR PARENT'S JOB.<br>  Jesus Christ, man.|`|u66CkBJLaa	OOOOHH I WISHED YOU DID THAT TO MY SON AND YOU'LL HAVE TO ANSWER TO HIS FATHER!|`|K6tSirOUaa	why is everyone answering saying ****|`|2AylNnmXaa	If that was my kid, I would knock you out cold.<br>  <br>  You're the one who needs to get smacked........|`|OTFZtGCaaa	I’m new to GGMG and your post is the very first one I read … and I couldn’t believe someone would really write something like that … and even worse actually act upon.  Since you have to be a mom/parent to be in this group, I feel sorry for your child(ren).<br>  <br>  I’m all for discipline and in a perfect world children wouldn’t run through the store, yet on the other hand children running around and (joyfully, not hysterically) screaming has never bothered me … it brings a smile to my face.  If it gets out of control, it’s the parent’s job to rein them in.  I personally act somewhat like Amber W – and really don’t care what other people think and/or if I get disapproving looks.  We as parents have to teach and discipline our children so that later on in life it is easier for them as they learn how to behave and be respectful to others.  You’re taking it out on the wrong party.<br>  <br>  You seem bitter … get some fun and happiness into your life!  All the best to you - I hope you’ll seriously consider changing your attitude and actions.|`|zmpk29BLaa	Realistically, I'm sure there are times when all of us fantasize about hitting a kid that's being unruly. But actually doing it is a little extreme.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is an excuse for a kid to be running around like that, but keep in mind that if they are like 5 or under they do not completely understand that they are being rude. To them, they just think they are having a fun time. If their parents don't say anything to them about it, then they don't know.<br>  <br>  If I was you I would just say something to the parent. One time in Kroger, a little girl kept running around and she actually ran into my cart once, it was quite annoying.. when I saw her mother come around the corner, I just pointed out, "Excuse me, but I'm worried that your daughter is going to hurt herself or someone running around like that." So she picked her up and walked away.. problem solved. But I would never actually hurt the kid.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	you know what, you just havent gotten ahold of the right persons child yet. as annoying as undisciplined children are, its the parents that  need knocked out , not the child. deal with them, they are at least your own size.|`|lzivF4Idaa	knock my kid down in a grocery store and there will be problems. one day you'll run up upon someone like me. kthnxbye.<br>  <br>  EDIT- i agree with TTC #2. knock my child down and it would completely be worth a phone call to his father(whom i dislike even having to think of) and he would come destroy you while me and my kid were at home laughing and eating lollipops.|`|prqrQcd1aa	What I hate is when I go to the grocery store...and i'm looked at "funny" when my kid is whining or pouting and i've said "NO" for the 2nd time, then I give them "the look". They usually stop by the time they get it... I also hate when you do this and you get looked at "funny" because you are actually telling your child to stop doing what they are doing, or because you have given your child a look that says...You better stop the crap now!<br>  There is a double standard for these types of things.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	i'm a parent.<br>  and it's not my job to 'trip' or 'knock down' my children.<br>  and neither is it yours.<br>  so thanks for doing my 'job' but no thanks.<br>  oh and if we see each other in a grocery store and my kids start to act up --i'd like to see you f*ckin' try your luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  answer to XP.  we're all saying f*ck because, as the great wigglesbee says, we're all getting 'defensive'.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i agree with bizzurke. no i dont hit my kid when he starts to act up i leave the store. and take my kid to my sisters and go back to the store?|`|JnLoHaoAaa	No I've never smacked a kid in the grocery store. Deliberately hurting them is just wrong. Now an evil glare, that's ok.|`|o34YHLiraa	No, I have never and will never lay hand on a child that is not my own. That is completely wrong and also illegal. Yeah it pisses me off when kids don't behave, but it also pisses me off when adults don't know how to behave.<br>  <br>  I do not have children of my own (I am 19) but I have cared for my young cousins, neighbor kids, etc. many times. Sometimes they are unruly despite my best efforts... that is the way little kids are. <br>  <br>  So I guarantee you, if you shove my little cousin over, I WILL get defensive. You have no right to interfere in a situation that is already being handled, and you have no right to attack anyone, least of all a little kid. You'd be damned lucky if I didn't push you over.<br>  <br>  Your behavior is SERIOUSLY out of line.Knock it the f*ck off.|`|2lDQktYjaa	You are an agressive person and you obviously don't like children. They way you are talking, it seems like theres a misbehaving kid in every square inch of the grocery store. There are some kids standing by their mom, most are not even creating any problem. I just never saw a kid running into me or disturbing me in any way, although it could happen like once a month but it just never happened to me.<br>  Wondering where u do your shopping...but seriously kids like to play while you as an adult should know better than knocking down a kid.|`|sAAnquoTaa	Well first of all let me tell you, you have no business touching someone else's child! It's there probiblem if they're kid is making them look bad, and you hae to remember a child is a child and will act up and be hyper sometimes and sometimes, you just have to let them be a kid. <br>     Second, as a mom, and aunt, I'd NEVER hit a child in public, I was hit in public as a child and it was so imbarrassing, not to mintion degrading...I'd never do that!|`|0y64qUHOaa	You're an A$$hole!  First of all, it is against the law to hit or injure a child, whether they are your's or someone else's!   If you ever laid a hand on MY kid, for whatever reason,  you'd have a real problem on your hands...  you know, like,  who would pay for your surgery after the beating YOU'D get within an inch of your life.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	Authoritarian bigots like you annoy me, so I'm going to kick your ***, or go to jail and when the other prisoners find out your a child beater, you'll rape and dead with in the hour.<br>  <br>  Dogs annoy me when they run up to you barking does mean I'm allowed to kick them and beat the owner?|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	This thought pops up in my head all the time, i would never act on it,  i have to remember its not the kids fault its the parents.. an besides my kid isnt always an angel in the store.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Let me get this straight...you punish the adults' lack of parenting by *hurting* the child?  Your logic is way off.  <br>  <br>  And, no.  I do not fantasize about hurting children.  I DO however daydreaming about giving the adults a good smack.|`|oCNFZhdraa	That's fuc?ked up

OQnRP6xVaa	Actually, we have done exactly that! Our children have been adopted for 6 years and we have sent pictures and letters about twice a year out to some box no where...<br>  <br>  6 years and 2 months passed with No sign they were received an no information about anything--then Wham! About 2 weeks ago we received contact from the legal department representing mom...asking if she could write and send gifts...<br>  <br>  So...ya never know! The way I see it is that it really doesn't take me much effort to drop her an update and some pictures. I don't know if she has been to pained to respond until now or if she only went to get the 6 years of updates until recently and it doesn't matter to me. <br>  <br>  It's just too easy to give her a thought once in awhile and drop a Prayer to God that she is able to recover and make herself whole for them when they go looking for her.<br>  <br>  What does it cost me? 15 minutes and a roll of film with a postage stamp... Just too small of a price to pay even if I never hear another word from her--I think she deserves to know the children who were taken away from her are well cared for and not being taught to hate her for her own illness and lack of resources and skills.|`|j0xfBk5Caa	Unless you are sending the letters to a friend or relative of hers, someone you are actually in contact with, or by registered mail directly to her you have no way to know if she is getting them.<br>  <br>  My son's adoptive parents may very well be sending me letters every year but I won't know until he is 18 and I can access the post adoption registry. Any info sent to me goes to the registry and I can't get any of it until he is of legal age. Same thing goes for what I send. If your letters go to an agency of any kind you have no way of knowing that these letters will ever be given to her.|`|7JEojMgQaa	That depends, where are the letters going? Do you mail them direct to her or do they go to the agency? If the answer is the agency, I wouldn't believe that they were never picked up. The agency has gotten their money from you, and this is not a life long arrangement. Lost of things have never been passed on, letters, pictures, medical info. It just piles up or gets ruined in the flood. <br>  <br>  You have no idea what they are telling her. It is quite possible that she is being told to move on.|`|2f49jsLpaa	Just because she hasn't written back does not mean that she isn't recieving them, and cherishing these letters- she may just not know how to respond, or may not feel comfortable writing back for some reason. Also, even if she hasn't gone to read them yet, she may change her mind eventually, and it will mean a lot to her to know you kept sending them. You definetly shouldn't stop writing them.|`|AKJwWqdZaa	Like Lori said, there could be many reasons why you have not received a response, however, if I were you, I would continue to write the letters. Actually, I would send one and keep a copy, just in the off chance she has not been receiving the letters. In that case, hopefully when she makes contact (perhaps years later), you will have a collection of letters to give her.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	No,<br>  <br>  Just keep sending them in, just because she hasn't responded doesn't mean she won't one day want the information. What do you to lose by doing it? Nothing. Your child will be glad you did when they're older at least they know you wanted some form of contact and you did what you agreed to do. <br>  <br>  Kazi's right, I keep copies of all the letters I send. Just in case my kids want to know what I've been writing in years to come.<br>  All the best|`|29f92985b9fb483985c8c89cbc7a99b3aa	Nope. I would keep writing. She may not be able to answer them, but she may be reading them. The more you send, the better it will be for your child when he or she seeks out their mom, because then, she will know a bit about her child.|`|NZF45pJmaa	Nope.  Keep writing, just becouse there is no response doesnt mean she doesnt appreciate recieveing the letters, very important to keep writing for your child.  Just my opinion. Good luck.
2H6j4j8taa	Seizures are pretty rare, even for people that have epilepsy. If the son hasn't had seizures in a while then the chances of him having one when you are babysitting him tomorrow, are very, very slim. He most likely will be on medication as well, which prevents most seizures.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can suggest is that you ask he mother to explain (or even write down if possible) exactly what to do on the odd chance he has a seizure and get her to leave a list of contact numbers with you as well (which she should do anyway).<br>  <br>  If it makes you feel any better, my 6 year old cousin has epilepsy and for all the times I've seen her, I have never seen her have a seizure once. She also has some learning disabilities and a speech impediment, but I just play with her like a normal kid and she is absolutely fine.|`|Xwr2LKCSaa	try to think positively. i know it's hard but try to.<br>  make sure to have all the numbers your going to need just in case of anything.<br>  <br>  good luck.
6Knhikr1aa	AIO's or all in one's are a great way to go because you dont have to have seperate stuffers or covers or pins. hey go on with tabs just like disposables and then you wash and dry them. I use swaddlebees which I really like. I do a lot of laundry anyway so having the diapers to wash is no biggie. I still use disposables if we will be out for a long time and overnight, because they get a lot wetter overnight and cloth diapers need to be changed more often as they arent as absorbent. I also use disposables the first couple of weeks as I am WAY to busy and tired to wash them then lol.Cloth diapers are much better for baby's skin and dont have the harh chemicals of disposables. They are cheaper in the long run, and yes they dont sit in landfills forever! They have become so easy to use now too.<br>  Good Luck!|`|jS6Qkj0faa	using cloth nappies is also way cheaper than the single use disposables and when bubs grown out of them you can still use them for mopping up spills etc. you can buy terry squares which are like squares of towelling or you can opt for a fitted cloth nappy that is sewn in the same shape as a disposable. some of these have extra layers of fabric called 'boosters' or 'soakers' to increase absorbency for night time/ heavy wee'ers. you can purchase them pre made or you can sew your own. theres heaps of instructions and free patterns on the internet. you can either have seperate waterproof pants (callled pilchers) or you can have nappies with it all in one piece (called all-in-ones or AIOs).<br>  i cant give you brand details as i assume you are in america and i have no knowledge of os brands.<br>  landering is no biggie and dont let anyone tell you that cloth nappies use more water than disposables- it takes over a litre of water and a cup of crude oil to make a disposable nappy. when bubby does a poo you shake it off/ wash it off into the loo (you can get attatchements for the toilet that make things a whole lot easier). put nappy in a bucket with a well fititng lid and once a day pop the whole lot in the washing machine. sunlight is great for getting stains out- a lot of the premade nappies come in a huge range of funky colours though so stains arent really an issue.<br>  i have used cloth with all four of my children- for my last one- a girl, i sewed fitted nappies for her and was always getting compliments on her 'funky bum' because i had used fabric with butterfly prints or hot pink peace signs etc.|`|u2rYPblDaa	Over 20 years ago I used cloth diapers because it it cheaper and because dispossable's are bad for the enviroment. Both have theyre advantages and disvantages.
lQbyeAcHaa	i wish i can give you the answer that you wanna here but i can't you are pregnant one month i can see but two months is unlikely i would tell your mom what happened and explain everything truthfully have her get you a pregnancy test and get checked by a doctor there is a pill now that will abort up to three months so hurry up and act now sorry i could not give you better news|`|4GnzqUxzaa	Well because your so young your body along with your menstrual cycle is still developing. Usually at young ages there are skipped periods and is not something unusual. As for the fingering and the boy having *** on his finger, sperm dies as soon as it touches air so I'm guessing from where his hand was to get some on his finger to your area it was in air for some time. The best I can tell you is to maybe get a pregnancy test to ease your mind. But I don't think your pregnant. (I could be wrong!)|`|1Q0ZnVdaaa	I think you are worried and you should talk to your mom about it.|`|IPsjE9Rpaa	First kids are way to active at a young age..... 2nd you need go have a blood test done and see a doctor get your parents to take you and tell them you want to go in alone.... Doctor will hold your privacy and tell them whats up and you want a blood test and that your dumb for letting him finger you when he had *** on his fingers and your just a lil kid that didnt no any better that its your parents fault for not watching and teaching you the right way when its really your fault!!!! =)|`|E3SJNlIUaa	Well, you are young, and your period is probably not stable yet. You might be a little paranoid. But you should check to make sure, if you were ovulating and his *** entered your vagina there is a chance. Though, I advise you not to waste your money on a pregnancy kit until you start showing some more symptoms. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanpregnancy.org/gettingpregnant/earlypregnancysymptoms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanpregnancy.org/getting...</a>|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	as long as the *** is wet the sperm are alive so yes you could be pregnant.  talk to your mother immediatly.|`|HwcQYXxoaa	If he had that on his fingers and there was sexual activity involving his fingers--there's a possibility for pregnancy.<br>  <br>  If you have missed you last two periods--there's a possibilty for pregnancy.<br>  <br>  See where I am going with this?<br>  <br>  However, none of us on Yahoo! Answers can truly confirm if you;re pregnant or not, so the best advice would be:  see a doctor.  If you cannot afford it, or you want to keep it a secret, you could visit a free-clinic on your own.<br>  <br>  Or, you can take a drugstore pregnancy test...  They're not as accurate as the doctors' tests, but they're pretty close.  Keep in mind that you may miss periods for other reasons, such as disease or health disorders--this is another reason you should see a doctor.|`|AA11187287	ya there is hun...get a pregnancy test right away k? and if it helps i always used to skip my period when i was 14 so it could be normal

Yes there are teens that come one here. but these women who are ttc just want our opinion and its not right for someone to go around gripping about it. Its y!a. If you dont want to see these questions then dont sign in. but really dont grip about the women who ask if we think they are pregnant. have some respect for the women who have been ttc and just want some hope.|`|by3Ea7x9aa	It doesn't bug me at all.  See what you don't understand is that they're extremely nervous.  With plenty of mixed emotions that made it 10 times harder to deal with.  Just like depression, keeping this bottled up makes the situation seem more difficult, they feel like they're trapped, and they are more anxious.  Since this is a very serious situation, they want to make sure that they are exploring all possibilities as well as making sure that their entire basis is covered.  You can't blame them-at all.|`|f858ecf4de718b7fb5e2a81c2598e330aa	some people don't have anyone to talk to or some one that is understanding a lot of people ask common since questions or things they can find out about on web md but for some nothing beats answers to questions that haunt you even if it is from a stranger|`|TlFnIei0aa	I don't open those questions.|`|SM4xIodaaa	HANNAH you are rude!<br>  <br>  LuKas you too!
RiqNF0l1aa	Oh my. My little boy started having seizures when he was 3 months. He has them all the time. But he has a brain issue that causes his.  My husband just now started having them and has nothing wrong with him. They told us it has to be his lifestyle. The stuff he s eating how much he is sleeping and his stress levels. Just because your son has it again doesn't mean he has epilepsy.My son don't have it and has seizures all the time. My husband does have it and don't have seizures all the time. It is very difficult thing. The best thing you can do for your little boy is remain calm. I know its scary but if your scared they are gonna be. They are already scared even if they don't remeber them. Put them on their side and just help them threw it. Talk to them let them know you are there.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	take the test results to the neurologist.|`|KNXprBi2aa	My daughter had her first seizure one week after her first birthday.  It went for one and a half hours. There was no temp or noticed bumps to the head. She was not behaving differently beforehand but it was full on.  She has them every seven years and her last one was when she was five months pregnant with our beautiful granddaughter - now nearly two. <br>  Apart from these turns she is as normal as the rest of us. Every time she has one she has all the tests and nothing shows up.<br>  A person can have one seizure a life time or several and be normal.<br>  Go with the doctors, ask questions, lots of questions and don't think that they might seem too stupid to ask.  Knowledge is important for you here, as this is also part of your life and so you do need to know too.<br>  Sometimes they never find out why, and sometimes they do and can fix it.<br>  Good luck with it all and I hope I have helped relieve some of your stress.|`|MXMMlSJPaa	It happens to my baby seizure without any  fever and even colds.

She confined in the hospital for 4 day, and the doctors findings is eletrolyte imbalance, lack of sodium, pottassium and chloride.I|`|dH6lBcGlaa	This can happen for many reasons, dehydration, fever's, etc. I wouldn't be too concerned unless it happens again. Keep an eye on her temp in the future. I have two friends that this happened to, and never occurred again with both of them.|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	My Dad had a seizure last summer.They did cat scan and a bunch of there test they also though he might have epilepsy,But in the end they said No.I do Hope you Son is ok.|`|EWETAH0daa	my niece only got seizures from trauma. but some people devolp epilepsy and no conection to family or injury. if he has another just know it is managable. a pill crusher and some pudding makes it go down... good luck i'll include ya'll in my prayers|`|im1pB72Saa	I have been in and out of hospitals since September with my now 16month old. (He stops breathing and passes out) they first told me it asthma related. Then neurological, and diagnosed him with epilepsy. They told me he was having seizures that cause him to stop breathing while he is seizing. I did research research research and was not and am still not satisfied with their diagnosis. They gave him a EEG which indicated specific readings conducive to seizures/epilepsy. We started seeing a neurologist weekly and after literally demanding further testing while his EEG shows he has had a seizure he in fact doesn't have epilepsy. I still have not been shown how they know he had a seizure.... He has had 2 Echos, 3 EEG's, 2 Chest x-rays, MRI and multiple doctors visits and no explanation yet.<br>  <br>  They tried to tell me it was Febrile Seizures sice there is no other proof of seizures, they are commonly cause by rapid increase in temperature, but he didn't have a severe rapid fever ever.<br>  <br>  My advice is research!!! Read everything about any possible diagnosis they give you, you are the only one who knows your sons behavior, he may have symptoms you never noticed, he may be perfectly normal. Ask lots of question! My doctors say I am the most prepared patient's mommy every, I say "my only fear is the unknown, I'd rather know everything than wonder about nothing" I am sure they are a little annoyed by my questioning but if I didn't question everything then my son could have been on VERY dangerous drugs for something he doesn't have.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
7a57235219ee07bdfd4f569a85d2a3e3aa	I understand what you saying. Cuz of his nature, you must have suffered like anything, and you are the one showing patience every time. He needs to be less selfish when it comes to the natural desires of a woman to become a mother.<br>  I am sorry, but he seems non-serious about the relationship. Its not you who will always make sacrifices for him, an its not him who will decide all the things about you both. Tell him that you will work for the sake of baby.<br>  <br>  Like the way he is doing, I guess u can also consult doc on your own, take the Clomid, don't tell him what you doing, and hopefully once u get pregnant, work hard and tell him then, maybe he changes his mind. And certainly he doesn't have a right to suggest you to abort the baby. <br>  Its ridiculous that if you are loosing 'golden time' of your fertility, at least he must realize the somewhat urgency of the matter.<br>  <br>  You must see your doc and be brave.. you have full right to fulfill your desires. He and you can cut short your extra-expenditures in order to pave a nice stable atmosphere for your baby.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|GrUuRwk5aa	Men are logical thinkers. he is worried about money. There no worse feeling for a man then feeling like he cannot provide for his family. Save some money then have the baby. You will be much happier that way.<br>  <br>  If money is no issue then talk to him about a timeline. Let him know how you feel and schedule a time that works for both of you. The best way to get your way is to include him.|`|87b5VgaOaa	If you can't live without a baby and would not be happen I move on if he keeps it up because this happen to my sister and she ended up getting a divorce at 30 and is now happily marred since 32 but they having worse time having a baby. Doctor said if she tried when she was younger she would a had a child. As with me and my husband he wanted no kids we have a son lol we didn't plan if be gift I ever got. He is now going on 4 but I know if it didn't happen way it did we would never had a child and he loves his son so much guys can just be scared. I ready for another one but he does not want anymore so I hopping going give us another little gift soon. We don't use anything so got to happen sooner or later. So if he really don't want one he make sure you guys use something so you don't have one...other wise I say try have one as long you having sex and you don't use anything has to happen. It be much his fault as is yours so it not like your tricking him. But just try talk him see what really wrong...make sure that he really wants one.|`|WnlzScIyaa	Girl, my husband was the same way, except I am only twenty one. I finally just kept talking about it all the time, and he became more comfortable with the idea. Now he is open to anything I want to try that will help us have a baby. We have been ttc for 15 months now, so i am glad we started when we did! I would just start talking to him, and let him no that it takes time, and with your health issues you need to start tryin now. Just go out and buy the opk's and othr stuff, he will become more uderstanding. That's what I did and now he is all into it with me! good luck|`|rNbNIEAIaa	give him the benefit of the doubt and save a little more money... i know how you feel though, i've been trying to get pregnant for almost two years now and it seems like time slips away, but just stay calm and don't give him a time line. <br>  <br>  he'll come around and soon you too will have your hands full :)<br>  <br>  men are never "ready" for this stage in life, so maybe you have to take the bull by its horn, <br>  have another talk with him and tell him how you feel, tell him the problems that may occur in trying to get pregnant|`|lzcglDnMaa	Wow, are you sure your talking about your husband instead of mine? They sound exactly like. My dh and I have been trying for 2 years, but it had not happened yet. After going to the docs, they told me I don't ovulate and they said they could help us. So, I talked about seriously trying and my dh is like we don't have the money, not a big enough house and so and and so forth. Well, I am 26 and he is 33 and I know that since I have been trying for 2 years and it has not happened I didn't want to wait longer. I kept talking to him about it and told him that the older I get the harder it is for me to conceive. Discuss with your dh about the finances and tell him how your body works. Men don't comprehend the same stuff that we do. They don't understand that you only ovulate for so long and you go you have to bd at the right time of the month. Keep talking to him and eventually he will see your side of things.  My dh did and now we are seeing a fertility specialist and I am on my 3rd round of clomid. Good luck to you and hope it happens.|`|13hFRGN9aa	just keep talking to him. i talked to my husband about having a baby and he would tell me the same about not being financially stable. however that is not an excuse money comes and goes. what i did is continued talking to him about a baby. I told him how him telling me No affects me because I feel like I'm getting old and not any younger. the critical it is for a woman to have a baby at an older age. and how that topic is very sensitive to me because of him not wanting one. Well i convinced him and we have been trying since May of last year. I went to a fertility doctor and i have been on clomid for 6 months now. Now he doesn't only want to have one but he hopes to get pg with twins. don't worry you will convince him just a little patience. good luck
MqFeJiukaa	I can totally relate.  Its really important you follow your Drs orders.  Maybe you can do some chores while sitting or laying down like folding clothes.  I was on bed rest with my 2nd and it was almost impossible to stay in bed because I had a toddler and not always a babysitter and my husband had to work for us to live.  I ended up induced and spending 3 weeks in Children's hospital with my daughter.  Trust me you will regret it if you don't do what is best for your baby.  Good Luck!|`|AA11920812	Can you compromise? I mean, you could sit and arrange your cupboards. Or, your kids and babies drawers - clothing. Just rearrange make sure everything is there. Put stuff you will need in special baskets so its handy.<br>  <br>  Can you sit and polish some silver, lol.<br>  <br>  I know its so tough! Maybe you could explain what needs to be done and have him help?|`|4jeqIx6Paa	i wish i was nesting , i dont even feel like cleaning anything , i guess thats bad but i just feel lazy ! i like to Organize nothing ! :( i know not good... but im 30 weeks pregnant maybe itllcome to me in couple of more weeks !|`|mPLXUorTaa	You really shouldn't be doing a lot of cleaning no matter how bad you want to.  Maybe you can do something that doesn't require a lot of physical movement.  Polish some silver, clean out a junk drawer, organize your wallet, etc.  Or maybe you can get your husband or other family member/friend to take orders from you for a while.  Most likely you'll find someone who's willing to do exactly what you want since you're so restricted right now.  It's not the same as doing it yourself but at lest you know it's getting done.|`|jLI0IgWkaa	If you are soooo stressed out, that you fear it is worse for your baby and body --- being stressed, than just relaxing in bed, then get out of bed, and so some cleaning, for your happiness and sanity. But work slooowly, not with the same vigor as you would use, if you weren't on bed rest. and don't climb ladders either.<br>  <br>  I say this because being stressed, and depressed is unhealthy for the unborn child.<br>  <br>  good luck .|`|F2wI6NGNaa	you need to ask yourself which is more important your nesting instinct or possibly having a preemie baby could you forgive yourself if you had to see your little baby hooked up to machines because you wanted to clean? nesting is natural and imsure its driving you insane right now I would suggest either make somone else do it or hire someone professional|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	if your only 33 weeks & youve already gone into labor twice... then i think it is way more important to you and your babys health to relax. youll have plenty of time to clean and nest as the weeks go by. maybe try taking a nice long nap one day, and when your done get up and slowly clean. not the fast, nervous, "i dont have time" cleaning... lol... but just walk around and pick up things. have your husband help you, and get him excited and involved. :) just make sure everything is okay with you and baby. good luck and congrats!|`|klcqgST9aa	Hmm, I'd say clean just a little, if there's anything you can do sitting, do that. Polish silver? Emotional stress is worse for the baby, I think. And if you can prove to your brain that you're doing something good, you'll feel better without hurting yourself.|`|8RfmosODaa	First off just breath! Remember that you are doing this for your baby so listen to your hubby and just relax!   Cleaning is not that important to put you or the baby at risk, you can get to it later! Maybe your hubby could clean it up for you or a family member.

10b1R3ibaa	Gee, maybe you're right.<br>  Maybe it's because all women don't do anything else apart from stay home, clean and cook meals? Thats all we're for, right?<br>  <br>  What are you, victorian?<br>  Maybe if you stop being stereotypical and referring to all women as one, people would care what you think. I'm not outraged by her. To  be honest, I feel sorry for her eldest kids. Where are they whilst she's getting all this attention?<br>  <br>  I have never ever bought one of those magazines. For a start, I had no idea it wasn't natural until the kids were born, that's how much I don't watch TV and gossip about things I quite frankly don't care about with my friends. Maybe, maybe I'm the exception, is that what you'll tell yourself? Aye, fairplay. Except almost every single answer is telling you the same thing!|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	I am not one of the women who will watch her reality show, send her money, or buy the magazines.<br>   I don't feel "outraged" I feel a little sorry for her.. she is only a single parent because she is divorced.  She is  in need of some counseling because she decided to have more children even though she already had six. She doesn't really seem any different to me than the Dugger family so I dont understand why everyone is so outraged at her and accepting of the Dugger family.|`|dLLDwZaraa	I admit I watched an interview with her on MSNBC, out of curiosity, to see her reasoning in having a litter of children she cannot afford.<br>  <br>  Im not "outraged" by her.  I feel badly for her children.  She's an idiot, along with the majority of the people who cover the same magazines you're speaking of.  If they werent, they wouldnt be on the cover.  Everyone needs a little entertainment once in a while...this lady happens to be this month's.|`|rrMYRLpXaa	Please don't be stereotyping women or men. There are women out there that do not buy the magazines, and there are men who do.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, "OctoMom" will most likely not have a reality show (at least on TLC) because of her poor circumstances. I mean, why would they want to film a "family" that WOULD be on the brink of poverty if not for the media attention and welfare?|`|VKQzj4Pmaa	I do not watch tv, nor do I buy magazines. It is all about nonsense, and her stories create nothing more than idle talk. People like juicy gossip, mainly women. Women also feel good to criticize other women, it is a known fact. They feel better about themselves, and it helps them feel empowered. However, most of the time it is unconsciously done, so they do not admit to it.|`|f2LDPr56aa	I believe people buy into these things because it makes them feel better about their own lives lol<br>  <br>  TLC is like the channel to raise ur self esteem "woa hes fat im skinny" "im glad i dont have a ton of kids and talk nasty to my husband" ect<br>  They will end up on TLC <br>  <br>  Nothing like walking by a news stand in middle of day feeling bad about work and going oh look a lady on welfare with 8 kids ahahaha i suddenly enjoy my job|`|oSsVEXMxaa	"Women" my ***. I have never bought a tabloid, and I've stopped even reading articles about her because I know she's desperate for attention. So you can shove your stereotypes where the sun don't shine.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	I don't buy those things that tend to lie. Maybe some people buy them for reading about Caylee Anthony for example. I saw her on the front cover and browsed because Caylee Anthony's picture was in the corner.|`|20117c2d24d216a72c5b973e9d412b2caa	Frankly, I don't waste my money on any of those ridiculous tabloid magazines. I would just as soon sink my money into a novel that I could really get into.|`|dzqxQmpFaa	And do you personally know that the people buying the mag are the same ones expressing outrage?? It's a big population over there I believe and there'll always be plenty buying the trash mags.|`|h5cFkP35aa	Who? Not me. There are morons in both genders.|`|LCgFShB3aa	Not all of us are buying them.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	The only magazines I buy are parenting ones and I certainly don't watch TLC shows.<br>  <br>  The only money I am "giving" her is that which she steals from us tax payers.|`|j2mRop0laa	I have no idea. I can get more info off TMZ.com for free!|`|eu6UQElYaa	Us women?  Like to generalize don't you.   I've never picked up a copy of a woman's magazine with her in it or on it.  I didn't watch her interview.  I've never went to her website.  And really I'm getting pretty sick and tired of hearing about her.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Don't give a flying rat's butt about the pathetic OctoMom!<br>  <br>  Don't read articles, etc.!|`|lzivF4Idaa	i dont buy magazines. =)|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Im not outraged at her im more upset at the people who are criticizing her. I watch a documentary on her and she seems like a very nice woman. The only reason why people are criticizing her is because she is not married. Although I have not bought the mag's on her or anything I believe she has the right to have children. You don't need to be married to be a good mother. Although she is on assistance right now it is because she was injured at her job and she does want to get back to work again. Nobody had a problem with the people whom had 7 babies a few years back because they were married and gave them free diapers a new house a new car free formula and paid all their kids tuition for collage. So I think people need to back off. <br>  -Tyffannie proud mother of two boys|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	I think its her life, she didnt make the best decisions, but i dont care its not my problem.  I wouldnt care about buying a magazine an any profits going to her, hell i give bums money all the time... its not hurting me to give a buck here an there, and they will be in the same boat with or without my dollar.  If anything its helping the children, who didnt get to pick their mom.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	I certainly haven't bought any magazines or watched any TV shows but I would suspect this is like any other freak show. Why do people pay to see the two headed chicken? <br>  <br>  I agree that if folks would ignore her, she might stop hatching out kids. If she gets a big book or TV deal, she'll probably just keep doin' what she's doin'.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	its not that we're supporting her, its we feel badly for those babies. they didn't ask for this.<br>  <br>  and i'm actually not taking care of her and i wouldn't watch her reality show if she got one. i think she is ridiculous and made bad choices. i don't support her in anyway.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I've never bought those magazines or watched an interview with her. But it's the same thing as when people buy a magazine with train wreck Linsday Lohan on it or something else similar. People don't want to read about boring good stuff, they just want all the juicy, nasty gossip|`|87WOSjwgaa	I am outraged by her and I REFUSE to buy anything with her face on it or watch any interviews with her in it. I think people send her money because they view it as helping her kids out. I think she is selfish and wouldnt trust her with a cent!!!|`|Qh01Ey7Daa	We aren't supporting her.  We just feel bad for her children.  How the heck is she going to support all those kids.  It was NOT a  support thing.  We just pity those poor children that are stuck with such an idiot.|`|VSCYTZ38aa	I have refused to buy anything with her picture on it and try to avoid watching stories about her on tv if at all possible. She makes me sick.|`|9tyx5BkPaa	the money for the magazines goes to the mom? pleeease. I dont think so.
TYRRjIv4aa	I think it's a timeless and classic name that can age quite well. When the child is young she can be called a nickname like Mary etc. I think of a woman that grows up to be very caring and nurturing to people around her.  The appearance I believe would be any because in my opinion the name is universal.|`|wLzuCDmfaa	Unlike Londen I love the name and i picture a very funny, smart girl with brown hair, green eyes and freckles.

My husband are not trying but were not preventing either.|`|VHHis05Naa	I miscarried Dec. 2004 and got pregnant two cycles later with my daughter.|`|HSUfe3m7aa	It depends how far along you were. If you miscarried completely on your own (just bleeding), it's possible to get pregnant the next cycle. If you had a D&C you should wait at least one cycle. <br>  <br>  Doctors say 3 cycles more for emotional healing. After one cycle you should be back to normal. It is also more accurate for pregnancy dating. I tried again right away and got pregnant right away. But I was only 5 weeks along and had a complete uncomplicated miscarriage.|`|Lz2N7D0yaa	I miscarried in May 2008. I was 9 weeks then. I had a really tough miscarriage though and was in the hospital for an infection (still unknown) for a week. My fiance and I have been trying ever since and had no such luck. We've gotten to the point where were going to stop trying and just let it happen. But it's hard. My cycles got back to normal almost right away, but now they are completely out of whack! It's really depressing to hear about all my friends getting pregnant again for the 2nd time when they just started trying. My dr advised me to start taking daily pills with folic acid which should help get pregnant. We'll see. This is my first month taking them.<br>  Good Luck!|`|yV373JUiaa	I just miscarried as well, but my husband and I have decided to stop trying for a few months.

1z3C0R2Vaa	14 day before your period good luck.........|`|lzcglDnMaa	Starting on day 1 of your cycle which is the first day you have  a full flow, count to days 12 thru 14. These are your most fertile days. You can tell by checking your cervical mucous. When it gets stretchy between your fingers you will be ovulating. You need to baby dance as much as you want. Stick a pillow under your bum and this will help the sperm to know where to go. Keep it there for 20 minutes. Good luck to you.|`|cbEa0uKNaa	2 weeks before your period, which is also 2 weeks after your period....so Both, before and after.....|`|MoFrhr0iaa	12 to 14 days after the first day of your period is when you ovulate.
LOH6UVh7aa	I love it. It is one of my favorites. I am Irish & my husband Scottish.  Here is the meaning of the name. <br>  <br>  The Vikings plundered Ireland in the 9th and 10th centuries and the native home of the Norwegian invaders was known as Lochlan "land of the lochs." But once they settled and intermarried with the Irish Lochlan became a popular name and was generally given to boys that had fair or red hair - a tribute to their Viking ancestors.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I think it's actually quite cute.  I never used to like it at all, they i started thinkin it was ok, and now i like it, and think it's cute, so it's growin on me lol, Hope this helps, :D.|`|igvUbqkyaa	I don't like it. It doesn't sound like a name to me. It is very harsh-sounding.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Love it! I knew siblings names Lachlan and Siobhan; such a cute pair!|`|DCJAMtkHaa	Yeah - I saw the name on several australian baby-name lists of popular names.  It's not that common here in Canada either.  I don't really understand how it got to be so popular in Australia considering it's Gaelic/Scottish.  But then agian.  Most baby name trends defy explanation.<br>  <br>  I rather like the name.  I think it's cute.  it's quite original.|`|EhD32t2Kaa	I personally think that unless you are planning to live in Australia, Lachlan might be a little too uncommon. Try something like Liam.|`|Am54a7c0aa	I've always liked the name Lachlan. But than again it could be because I'm Aussie. :)|`|B7nqTcttaa	I always liked this name, he can have lots of nicknames too, Lock, Lockie. I had a friend called Lachlan and we used to call him Locker.|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	i like it! its different yet sounds kinda traditional for some reason.|`|XfCEooqSaa	this would probably be a bad name choice since most people probably can't even pronounce it|`|NePgB9b2aa	I LOVE this name.|`|flspL64taa	i like it. my neighbor is named lochlan but i think i like that spelling better than lachlan|`|uSmZT0pCaa	I like it a lot.

We hardly use any minutes though :-)<br>  <br>  That's the point of paying the extra $10 a month for unlimited messages!!|`|Uz4yUUMBaa	Why the hell does it even matter. For one thing, the plan is unlimited, and for another, you're nineteen which makes you an adult. An adult that makes his own decisions, and clearly does not ask stupid questions. Clearly.|`|gtTIILgyaa	ummmm......I am 27, have two children, am a single mother, work a full time job and send WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY more text than that a month. As long as the plan is unlimited and another part of your life is not "suffereing" I think it is fine......|`|nTDlqdHIaa	Why does it matter how many texts you send if the plan is unlimited and if you are 19 you're an adult so why would your parents be able to take anything away from you?|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I am 25 and would prob send that|`|Jswomud7aa	I don't think it's that big of a deal. Most of my messages are really small, like 3 or 4 words at most, so who care's how many.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Oh thats not bad. I know people that send over 10000 a month. I sure she wouldn't be angry. If she is, tell her its UNLIMITED for a reason. Trust me, thats not alot. If the school wouldn't take my phone all the time I would send that much too.|`|a8IRxC4raa	I wouldn't be angry, because that would not solve the problem.<br>  <br>  My child would lose her cell phone because she would have shown that she does not have the  maturity to use one responsibly.  <br>  <br>  She would get it back when she either showed the necessary responsibility or could afford to buy and maintain one herself.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|lzivF4Idaa	i send more text messages than that!!! lol <br>  i wouldnt be angry cuz thats the point of having unlimited texting!!!<br>  i wouldnt care, no punishment.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	i wouldnt care, thats kind of the point of having the  unlimited texting feature.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	If the plan is unlimited, why does it matter?
x4T2cFDcaa	sad case for these children who did not ask to be born<br>  <br>  I think the mother should have been better checked for<br>  mental stability <br>  <br>  I hope she did not do this just to be famous<br>  <br>  and CPS may investigate though they are overloaded<br>  and hopefully this mother will do what is truly best for<br>  the children|`|QhLpr1Ibaa	if she cant take care of them yes my sister was a wonderful mother but loved alocoholh to ... :(<br>  it broke my heart to see them babies cry for there monther and cry when they had visits only 1 and 2 they were it was terriable  so i would say yes if she cant take care of them and if she loves her children then get her *** up get a job and have some responsability  and a ******* mother to those children ...!!!|`|de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	Child services can't step in because a family lives in poverty, because a home is going under foreclosure or because of family size.|`|f2LDPr56aa	then who will she have to live off of publicity wise<br>  <br>  give her a while to get in contact with TLC and she will be making them work for her in front of the camera|`|Jswomud7aa	In order for any child to be taken away from the mother there has to be serious evidence that the children are being neglected or abused. Because the Octomom's mother is enabling her behavior I doubt the kids will get taken away. Although, there are many many eyes watching her behavior from now on.<br>  <br>  I personally think she should give them up for adoption. There is no way she can provide a good life for her children given the state of her mental health. I hope that a church tries to intervene and give her some help if she decides to keep them though.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Ok, Stop with the questions, Seriously she had 14 kids that was her choice...and leave it at that whatever the "government" decides is for them to do it, not us.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	So you think she should have her children taken away just because she can't support them without some government assistance?

Because it's getting OLD! Go find a hobby or something! GEEZ!|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	I doubt CPS will get involved. They only seem to get involved on false reports or they wait until the very last minute when the children are so far neglected that they have to get involved.<br>  I personally think she should give them up for adoption or at least to foster parents until she can get a job that pays enough to support those children.<br>  I understand her want to have a big family, so do I, however its not right nor should it be allowed for her to continue to reproduce and have a large family then stick the taxpayers with the bill.|`|Dwz8V6dPaa	Her own father knows she has a screw loose. She would require approximately $135,000 a month in child care costs to take care of all of them. Do we have a choice in flipping this bill?

At 12-14 weeks, you will not have breast lactation, or other breastmilk issues.  Be happy at 12-14 weeks pregnant, and be thankful that you don't have to deal with boobs or breastmilk yet!  At your stage, you should be dealing with morning sickness, and not asking about breastmilk.<br>  <br>  Colleen

I had a Spanish teacher in middle school she said that when she and her hubby had kids that she would only speak to them in Spanish up to a certain point and that he would only speak to them in English.|`|AA12351337	If you speak both, it is going to help them SO much.  I took Spanish in high school and failed it....miserably (La Chica Bonita...The Beautiful Women?  Ha, I still know some).  Because languages are not easy to teach, it's different for each person.  You being there mother, you can teach them the way they need  be taught.  Then it will help them in high school, provided nothing changes.  I HAD to take a foreign language my sophomore year to graduate (that one I passed).  So If they already know Spanish, (or any language the school offers), and a language is required, then they can take that class, it would be like a free class, they already know the language.|`|AA11026077	yes. it would makes things easier for your kids in the long run. learning languages is easier when you are younger. i heard that being multilingual helps something with your brain or intelligence, i guess like how they say learning music does. plus, spanish class in high school will be easier if they know what the words mean beforehand. but if i were you i definitely would teach them|`|4NcshCDvaa	I know two parents who are trying to help their babies learn two languages.

6Knhikr1aa	Why would you not got to the doctor? Yes, it can spread and cause a urinary tract infection and then a bladder infection, eventually it can become systemic and that can kill you. I would say it's unlikely, but only because most people treat it before it gets to that point. Also, if you have used yeast infection treatments and it's still there, It's probably NOT a yeast infection, but something else that could be much more dangerous! You really need to see a doctor and find out what it is.

It makes me sad!  LOL!  She used to hate lettuce but lately has been stuffing her face with it.

Hmph!|`|SaRDq9iLaa	My daughter is only 6 months but she LOVES rice, barley and oatmeal cereal; sweet potatoes, carrots, peas, green beans, pears, bananas and apple juice.

LOL|`|LbkLg4RFaa	Currently Will's favourites are watermelon, rockmelon, bananas, pineapple, blueberries and carrot.  If he sees any of these foods he will crack it until he gets some.

Can't even get him to eat Garlic & Rosemary Roast potatoes though which he usually loves or mashed potato with a little onion gravy.|`|DxbaEPbUaa	try giving your baby more nutritious foods like yogurt instead of hot chips. oatmeal or any hot cereal is a good source of fiber and iron. try giving her cooked tomatoes. you can disguise them in some spaghetti. try to give her as much green veggies (cooked) as possible. introduce foods slowly and if she doesn't like them try reintroducing at a later date. the important thing is to not give up on certain foods just because she doesn't like them right now.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	My daughter is 10 months-The only thing she doesn't like are the Gerber meals that have meat in them-Other than that she's not picky at all lol!<br>  <br>  My son is almost 3 and he's the pickiest eater ever-If we let him he'd eat nothing but fruit snacks, cookies, and juice! He's such a skinny little boy, so we try to give offer him healthy but high fat and protein meals-Mac and Cheese with pureed squash or carrots in the sauce (we use jarred baby food), Spaghetti Os with meatballs (surprisingly healthy), and vegetarian "chicken" nuggets.

It upsets me. Sometimes I try really hard to make him meals that are not the same ole same ole that I was fed and my son will just make a mess out of it...He'll "spill" it so he doesn't have to eat it or something like that.

Anyways, i went upstairs for a few minutes and came back to see him feeding his chicken and macarronni to the dog :(   while eating his brownie! He is almost 6 lol

Until you are in that situation or know the whole story then i would not go around judging everyone who has had one.<br>  <br>  edit- I read the story under mine and more power to her for keeping her baby but again every story is different.

Get it right before jumping on your soap box.|`|MWWUPWNiaa	These type of questions always get many responses =] MY opinion is that all women should have a chance to chose whether they want to keep the baby or not. Many women that are drug addicts for instance get pregnant and their children have high chances of having a not so promising future. By getting rid of abortion we could be DESTROYING the living womans RIGHTS. Its already a painful process for the pregnant mother but to make them women feel worse about it is sad and very IGNORANT. If YOU got raped and would rather not keep the child because of this would you honestly keep the child? And how do you explain its existence? OHH YOUR DADDY PUT HIS PENIS IN ME AGAINST MY WILL?? I think not.|`|kVBDpAMTaa	I am completely against it no matter what!<br>  I think that if more people watched an abortion video they would rethink getting one.

Well, anyone could be the next genius. It's a matter of you're brought up and the nurture you recieve.<br>  <br>  Though if you're bringing this baby into the world and YOU know that you cannot care for it, yet you wont give it up for adoption for some reason then those people should have the choice to abort.<br>  <br>  There's enough people in this world.<br>  ..and if someone is just bring a baby into this world because and know that that baby wont be cared for then they should have the option<br>  <br>  Like I said this question can be debated.<br>  <br>  I don't agree with Obama's choice for born abortion.<br>  That's completely wrong and people should give that baby up for adoption.|`|gfIWn6QDaa	I am pro choice.<br>  <br>  I think that there should be laws limiting women on how many abortions they can have. Now, there is a lot of sick and twisted cases out there. There was a story about a six year old, yes, I said SIX YEAR OLD, whom was raped by her stepfather and half brother and she was four months pregnant! It is really sickening, if I can find the article I would link it, but I think that abortion should be allowed in cases so extreme like this. Raped victims will not always feel connected with their child because sometimes it is an ugly reminder of what happened that night. Now, I say some, not all victims are like that. There is just really too many cases to say what is okay and what is not.<br>  <br>  I am very much against women who do not use protection, get knocked up and wander in and out of an abortion clinic abusing the system. I think that if you are not responsible to stay protected and stay safe, you should be offered a chance to have a surgery to allow you not to have children. <br>  <br>  This is really a touchy topic especially on this next of Yahoo Answers because so many women are trying to becoming mothers. Should save this for a another area of discussion. :)|`|nuTvB84Gaa	Im totally against also.<br>  I think if the girl/woman was sexually abused then she shouldn't abort it.<br>  She should let it have a life. It's not the babies fault or hers.<br>  She should kill her child because she was raped.<br>  I see how looking at the child would bring back bad memories.<br>  I personally would keep my child if i was raped.<br>  But if the woman didn't think she could handle keeping the child then its ALWAYS better to put it up for adoption and let him/her have a chance at life.|`|7g3IWCBvaa	Im all the way against abortion<br>  every baby deserves to live|`|AhBJT5xFaa	I'd say if the girl was raped than it's okay!!!<br>  But in all other situation I am totally against it. :\|`|7aVPODR8aa	Against.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	I'm totally against abortion.

Bz8tcAOyaa	I like it for a boy too. It sounds masculine to me. You are right though; it is very popular for girls right now.|`|IoQF4g1Gaa	Personally, I think it's better suited to a boy too. <br>  That's probably because in my area we have a lot of little boys named Reagan / Regan lol!|`|FsiG5WtQaa	I kinda think of it more for a boy. <br>  I think of Teagan for a girl tho.|`|5FqNsXRNaa	neither...I think president...then the girl in the Exorcist|`|ln0wLqZhaa	I really don't like the name , but when I do hear it  i automatically think Girl.|`|j0Jkq4z2aa	sorry.. but i disagree : ) I like it more for a girl.

You can use it for either.|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I prefer it spelled Regan for a girl, not Reagan like the president. Regan is from shakespeare and I think it's really cute for a girl. I probably wouldn't use it though.|`|igvUbqkyaa	I like it for a girl but spelled Regan - that is a girl's name. Reagan is a last name. It just seems to feminine for a girl.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	It reminds me of the girl from the exorcist so I guess girl.|`|PuRpsENEaa	For a girl|`|DCJAMtkHaa	Me too - I prefer it on boys because of the meaning.  I think it's a really cute, really uncommon and quite masculine name for boys.  I'd much rather use it on a male child than a female.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But I have to say, I dislike the name Keagan, which people seem to also like on both genders.|`|Am54a7c0aa	In my opinion, Reagan is a boys name.|`|NePgB9b2aa	None. President.|`|LJ0uNLlAaa	Neither, cause I don't like the name.<br>  But, I'd say its a boy name.<br>  Sounds jock-ish.|`|LOH6UVh7aa	Both|`|a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	BOY.|`|B7nqTcttaa	Boy, i don't like the name though.|`|tHEBPDenaa	it works for both just when i hear it i first think of a girl.
m2aznd8xaa	you definatly need them to be a little more seperated for a little while. i went through it with my now 9 yr old when she was little too and it drove me crazy.  finally i got fed up and one day said no she will be up there with u when i say she can. right now she is busy with me  i have her on a schedule now.  and if she dont behave or i dont get evrything i want done in one day there is always tomorrow. i stated limiting their time together by letting her be with my kid weekends only.i used to live in the basement and she would come down almost eveyday just so my girl could hear her and my kid would start balling but i didnt give in. i was too fed up. we are the parents now and we want things our way so put your foot down and let him know you can still see her but to a minimal until things start going your way.the in laws dont seem to care they spoil them let them run wild then when your with your kid you have to deal with how the kids want things done like grama.put you foot down.the only reason your kid want grama more is cuz he gets away with more and is doing thing his way.remember your the parent now so do things your way. good luck. i know also have a 20 month old ive been moved out for over 5 yrs now from my in laws basement but they know better than to interfere and now do things my way. my kids see them on weekends and me and the in laws get along better they seem to have more respect for me now and alway call me to make sure if its okay for my kids to do certain things when they are over there.  i feel more incontrol and i have two happy kids on my hands.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	He likes her and wants her because there's no rules with Grandma.  Y'all are playing "good cop, bad cop."  When your son runs to Grandma when he is in trouble or is supposed to be doing something he needs to be told to come back.  Talk to Grandma and tell her that she needs to back you up when you ask him to do something.  If she can't back you up then schedule "grandma time" and keep your schedule separate from hers until it is time to see grandma.|`|G9TocOkAaa	why is YOUR child the responsibility of your MIL?|`|ZZMkENyeaa	we went through this with my nephews. It pissed me off so bad cause they'd get up at 3 or 4 in the morning every morning and wake everyone else up fighting on their way to my parents bedroom. So I ended up playing mommy for a full year and 1/2 to two boys that had no respect for me and wouldn't listen to anyone. Every time my nephews got into trouble they would scream bloody murder (regardless of whether they were across the room, or if their dad actually got their butts) and run for my dad. Dad would always baby them and take their side, no matter what they did. They could do anything short of murdering and my father saw nothing wrong. They had some serious issues.<br>  <br>  My brother put a stop to it, FINALLY. He told dad, "look, these are MY boys not yours and no matter where I am or who I'm with I am in charge of them. They will do as I say, and you're NOT going to undermine me infront of them EVER again." When he was able to move out, they spent a good 6 months away from our house, that really helped the boys. They are older now, and a lot more respectful and easier to handle. Basically put your foot down and restrict their time together. Good luck.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Its not her son. Your husband is alive isn't he? She didn't kill him so she did something right. i dont think this is about her being "irresponsible" i think this is about you and your son going to your mil rather then you. Which is fine if he does. My son when we are not in the house, he doesn't want me, he only wants who ever else is around. When we are home he really has no choice its either me or daddy. Latley though he is clinging more to daddy and he is almost 2. Its normal, its just a phase and it will fade with time.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	this is because he feels more love from her.  consider some anger management sessions with a counselor and start appreciating your wonderful family.

LJ0uNLlAaa	Double R is adorable.<br>  Riley Roxanne is so unique.<br>  I love it.<br>  Its incredible.<br>  I wouldn't go with any other name.<br>  Its beyond perfect.<br>  ?|`|igvUbqkyaa	I like the name Riley and I think Roxanne makes a great middle name (especially since it really means something to you). But I don't know about the two together - they don't really flow and the double R doesn't sound great.|`|cd962e52b53659b6dacb1df7cbdf7a87aa	To me Roxanne has a very harsh sound.  id prefer Rose or a soft name with it if I had to use it.|`|AA11391968	Beautiful name!!|`|9y4mUvaFaa	Riley Roxanne has a kinda cute twist to it, but its not my style at all. The Roxanne does make it girlier. i think any name that doesnt start with an r would sound good with Roxanne like these:<br>  Sophie/a Roxanne<br>  Olivia Roxanne<br>  Lily Roxanne<br>  Isabella Roxanne <br>  Madelyn Roxanne. <br>  I would actually go with ur choice of Riley Roxanne as long as ur last name doesnt start with an r aswell lol. the last name will help break up the r's!!! goodluck|`|Ty4UC8GLaa	I like it. Is Roxanne the middle name?? Because if it is then it doesn't matter about the double R, because Roxanne won't be used as much. But I still like it even if Riley Roxanne is the whole first name.|`|Vk6oCBgQaa	I love it...when she gets older she can have either riley or roxy for a nickname...and the double r doesn't sound weird.|`|2CYfjPA6aa	i am not a fan of Riley, but I love Roxanne.|`|ZxJw85hfaa	I think it's adorable!|`|wLzuCDmfaa	Very cute|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	I don't like the way that they flow but I LOVE the name Riley on a girl! I would spell it Rylie though, if you like that spelling lol. ~I LOVE DEREK|`|fboC1N7gaa	I'm not in love with the double r.

I think myn hate me too. But anyway, you are doing great & achieving much more than they did and that's all they want.  Do good and get to a good college. then you can be on your own. Until then, stick it out, times a re hard and save your money.  Korea is not the answer.  You will achieve much more here in success!|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Do they know how you feel?  Maybe when she talks about putting you in the orphanage she is joking. Like my dad before he died (I was ten we he did) would say to me "We might just have ta' take ya' back to the pound."<br>  <br>  God I miss my dad.|`|Jnv47zQgaa	no they dont hate you, they care about u too much. dw they will get over it|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Aww, im sorry :(<br>  <br>  They dont hate you, they just arent very good at the whole parenting thing, some just arent.   They werent probably given a lot of encouraging words as children.  Its really sad, children need encouragement from parents and they need to feel appreciated and accomplished.  It sounds like you over acheive just to get a reaction from her.  I think its great you accomplished so much at such a young age, and i would be so proud if my child did this.  Im sure they are proud, but dont know how to say it.  Don't ever blame yourself, it isnt your fault.. even if your a pain in the butt once in a while there is no excuse for this kind of behavior from a parent.  It isnt wrong or selfish to want recognition, you need it, it is very important to your success to have it.   I would write your mother a note, tell her how you feel.. if it doesnt make any difference just keep on doing your best, work hard and get out of there as soon as you can, make a great life for yourself and when u someday have children compliment every success you can, and hug them every chance you get :)  <br>  <br>  GL!  You sound like a great kid.|`|WKgvwCNZaa	You should really tell your parents how you feel... Maybe try to find what you do for her to be like that, gain her trust and love.<br>  <br>  Just think about what you doing to make her angry. Maybe you don't know yourself. You can't fix something that you are not aware of.<br>  <br>  Good luck,|`|70kh6VSoaa	i hate these questions cause you never get the real or whole story you are still a kid and its most likely not as bad as you make it out to be|`|DWOwIGWJaa	You need to find some adult mentors other than your parents. Do you have a favorite teacher? A pastor or scout leader or friend's mom whose friendship you can cultivate? Someday you will understand that your parents are sick, pathetic people who are the real losers, not you. I know it's hard, but you just can't take what they say to heart. You need to get your nurturing from SANE adults, and your self esteem ultimately comes from yourself, based on your good deeds and accomplishments. Nobody can take this from you. When you learn to do this, you become a mature, healthy person, no matter what your parents were like.|`|X84Yn5wdaa	ah, sorry about your troubles.so here's the deal, it sounds like your mom has very high expectations that can't be succeeded. Next time she gives you ****, just say something like, "you know, mom, I try really hard in school and i'm a practical perfect student. i do everything in my power to succeed, everything to be the best student i can be but that doesn't seem to get through to you."<br>  did she get great grades in school? did she do well like you?<br>  if not say, "mom, i know you were no perfect student and i know you never did anything great like me. mom, im saying this because i know im everything you weren't in school. don't you see that i'm trying and, mom, would have you done all this in school?"<br>  you need to remind her how great you are and i know that sounds a tad pompous but it seems necessary. Tell her you love her but you can't take to be ridiculed any longer.<br>  if none of this works you should get a job, stay at a friends house or rent a place if you can find one. become independent, i mean, tell your mom that you dont need her. tell her that you can be independent but remind her that she'll miss you.<br>  okay, that was a lot. basically if nothing i say works, find a relative here in the u.s. if you have one OR go to korea then move back here when you've graduated school and show your mom how great you turned out.:)<br>  good luck,<br>  nikki|`|de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	I grew up with an abusive dad and heard it all as well.  He really wore down on me.  The only advice I can give is don't rely upon your mom for praise.  If you've done something well, just be proud of yourself.  Take the time to remember every day that you are important and are worthy of love.  Keep in mind that you'll be an adult one day and won't have to take their criticism.
ca9dEvSAaa	My mom is going to be there. The baby's father said months ago he wanted to be there. But he changed his number and the last I heard he moved to Colorado! WTF?|`|Coc593Ikaa	Just my husband. My mother makes little comments here and there about how I must be upset with her, but I just brush her off and ignore them. It is my choice. <br>  <br>  When it comes down to it, the majority of the time is me being treated for pain. I don't want to deal with other people then. I don't want to have to worry about being polite or making sure everybody is settled, since I live in a town a couple of hours away from my parents. And I don't want to worry about them being tired. And I don't want to feel pressured to "hurry up" because a crowd of people has formed. <br>  <br>  Nope, I just want my husbnad there to help me through it. He's all I need and all I want. He'll be able to handle it, no problem. And when the baby comes out, it will be he and I bonding over our child first. We say that he and I are a team, and now we have a third member on our way. I want to celebrate with my team.<br>  <br>  ADD: Oh, my dad! He would come into the room if I asked him to, but he would be so amazingly uncomfortable and fidgety! He'd be looking everywhere but at me. I don't think he'd deal well with seeing me in pain or with seeing me with my knees to my chest!|`|MXXOICquaa	i know that my husband will be there and i want my aunt there because she was more like a mom than my mother but my mom doesnt see that and i think she will be pretty mad if i let my aunt in there and not her but i dont want my real mom around because she was never there for me and i would go months without talking to her before i got pregnant and now that im pregnant she is trying to be the perfect mother and i think its a little late for so i may not call anyone when im in labor but my aunt so she can be there and then she can leave ill call the rest of the family and she can come back like she never even heard from me until my baby boy arrived|`|ilLPvvU7aa	I had my husband, mother and mother-in-law.  I thought my Mum would be the best to have with me but to be honest, she annoyed me a bit!  Believe me, when you are in there........you don't care who sees your bits........you just want that baby out of you!!  <br>  <br>  Bottom line - whoever you feel comfortable having with you.  Good luck!|`|cO9sxO9raa	I think I just want my husband in there. My parents live in another state so if they make it on time most likely my mother will be in there with me...but I can totally see her freaking out and getting all emotional. I would feel so weird if my dad came in...I think we would both not look each other in the eyes for the rest of our lives lol =)|`|3Boqr4Jjaa	If you have to convince your dad it's not a good idea. Mother and sister are the best. Woman understand the process but Men generally especially your father have a hard time understanding the birthing process.<br>  <br>  Or sell tickets !! Just a Joke!!<br>  <br>  RN|`|RE6GBw0Baa	heya hunni,<br>  <br>  IF i ever get the chance i only want my fiance in there, my mom would do nothing but clean and i dnt think donking her on the head would do my labour any good hahaha.<br>  <br>  good luck hunni, not long left !!!! xxxxx|`|DoaMYpfMaa	i had my husband.  but  my mom was there too. i wouldn't want my dad in the room!!!|`|DyxZSbYnaa	Just remember to let your family know,  If you get to a point that you ask anyone to leave then for them not to take it personal.  You might not be yourself.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	I'm going in alone, don't want my husband in, he'll just pass out :) And my mom is overseas so she'll be coming a bit later.. I think I will do on my own with doctors better.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	With my first baby it was just my mom in there with me (she played the role of my baby's daddy lol, he left when I told him I was pregnant). With my 2nd baby I had my husband and my mom in the room with me, my mother in law was going to be there but unfortunately she had passed away suddenly/unexpectedly before I gave birth. With my third baby I only want my husband in the room if he can make it, otherwise I'd rather be alone this time.|`|8ELfnTODaa	I'm having my mom and husband in the room during labor and once it's time for the baby to come i'm going to let my mother in law come in. she's not my favorite person in the world but she's done a lot for me and i think she deserves to see the birth of her of grandchild lol. <br>  <br>  she's just not allowed look at my vagina hahaha|`|quTKsQPhaa	I am not pregnant, but would love to be soon! I will have my (soon to be) husband in there, as well as my mom and mother in law. I don't live in the same state as our families anymore, but hopefully I will go into labor while they're visiting. (We've got this all planned already lol)|`|jKMH27gKaa	OMG def. not my dad -- he has heart probs, lol! My husband was a superstar at our last delivery and he's up for the job again -- I'd definitely have my best friend if he weren't available though, or one of my sisters. :)|`|pWDYcBA7aa	Hey I just want my partner in there with me...and possibly my mother...<br>  MY partner wants his mother to be there too but I wouldn't feel comfortable...
3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Lol...when I was around that time, I was excited about showing too.<br>  <br>  Then my belly popped out.  I had to invest in a new wardrobe.  And the fronts of those shirts have stains on the belly where I accidently bump into foods I'm preparing and eating.  I have trouble bending over to put on my socks and shoes.  I can't sleep on my stomach.  I can't shave my own legs (okay, I can...but the results aren't great.)  And having a belly somehow gives strangers the right to comment on me and my pregnancy...(I learned really quickly that a pregnant woman should not buy her husband's cigarettes unless she wants to be hassled!)<br>  <br>  Not trying to be a downer...grass is always greener.  :)  You'll be showing soon enough and then you'll be ready to have your old body back!  And good job on the quit...6 months for me now!|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	omg i know exactly how you feel :] when i was 11 weeks you couldnt really tell, just a little bit... and from that time to where i am now (13 weeks 4 days) i seem to have exploded lol. i mean im not huge, and i dont have a big pregnant belly, but you can definately tell that i am pregnant. i just cant wait to have that big belly... i think its such an amazing thing... lol i cant wait for my baby to get here!|`|CiFR2xuBaa	I'm 8 weeks and I'm excited so I can start buying cute maternity tops and dresses, I probably won't start showing until about 20 weeks though....I didn't show until I was 7 months with my 1st child and I wasn't even overweight then.|`|3Boqr4Jjaa	O boy or O girl give it time. In a about 20 years you will happy again when you get a tummy tuck.<br>  <br>  God bless and best of luck!<br>  <br>  RN|`|DF6ihDDCaa	Im 13 weeks and already gaining<br>  weight. I'm very excited to start showing <br>  more :)<br>  Congrats on the baby!
UwKrgP3Maa	I was the same as you, sex drive really high towards the end of my pregnancy, my husband was more than obliging.  I believe more men are turned on by pregnancy than turned off.  We were back having sex just 10 days after the birth ... I was a bit nervous at first thinking it could be quite painful, but it wasn't, and things start to tighten up again as time progresses.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I'm only 8 weeks..my husband and I have sex alot though...but I'm scared of what his reaction will be when I'm bigger as well..I've always been small so I'm hoping he isn't turned off..but I heard alot of guys are like that.<br>  <br>  =(|`|eu6UQElYaa	Some guys get a little nervous or feel a little awkward having sex when their wives/girlfriends are pregnant.  It's normal, just like women not wanting sex when they are pregnant is normal.   You could try talking to him about it to find out his reasons for not wanting sex and then you'll be in a better position to try and work it out with him.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	If your bf is turned off by your belly he is a shallow prick! Tell him that the bump is his child growing inside you, and he should think it's beautiful! Don't be too hard on yourself. If you are just thinking that he's turned off, then maybe you should ask him if that's the case. If it is in fact the case, than he doesn't deserve you! You are a beautiful woman, and the fact that you are growing a beautiful little life inside you is SO amazing! Doesn't it make you feel lik super woman? Most men I know are more turned on by a pregnant woman! I know my husband is! He thinks it's SO awesome that he "put" a little baby in my tummy and he gets to watch me grow as our baby grows inside! He thinks it's wonderful! I'm sure your bf would think so too if you told him how you felt! Yes, my sex drive was totally high at the end of my first pregnancy. I'm 11 weeks along with #2, and I'm not feeling that drive so much. I almost haveto make myself feel it, but once we start I get SO into it! :) Good luck! Hope you and your bf can get it on while you still can! 6 weeks without it is a VERY long time! (We only made it 4 weeks, but it was STILL hard! LOL)|`|sMvWJDqsaa	I made sure to put the guilt trip on my man when I first got pregnant to insure that we would still have sex...seem like it turned on me though because now he wants it all the time and I don't want anything to do with him! All that I can think is "You helped me get this way or sex is how we got here in the first place..." I guess I never thought that gaining some weight would be such a turn off for me!!|`|j9axB0YMaa	i'm 32 weeks and I currently have no sex life. I'm on meds to stop contracting so I think my husband is scared to have sex with me. I could care less about it I have absolutely no sex drive. I'd take one for the team and put out if he asked, but he doesn't and that's just fine with me.|`|xMy0QEvFaa	I'm 27w4d pregnant and my sex life is gone, I hoping it comes back during third trimester though :)|`|zF1MRdUFaa	maybe he is afraid of hurting the baby my husband was.|`|70kh6VSoaa	i am 34 weeks well i will be on monday and my husband lets just say theres been no change try talking to him|`|h5cFkP35aa	You're a pretty girl and that's his loss!
X2EPEEwbaa	Depends on how much sleep they've had... my 11 month old son goes to bed around 7:30pm and he's up between 6 and 7 am.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	when the ten month old is ready, unless the caregiver has a reason to wake the child up earlier.  this is the same answer regardless of a person's age.|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	My oldest son was always up at 6 in the morning at 10 months, my second boy he was up at 8 in the morning at 10 months and my 3rd son was up at 7:30 every morning, and my 4th child is up at 9:30-9:50 in the morning. So it still varies at that age and now none of them nap during the day except for my 4th child who is 2 1/2 months. The time she wakes up every morning could change as she gets older though. You never know lol....|`|zPYyGw8oaa	My son goes down at 8 or nine and is up for good around 7:30...it all depends on the baby and schedule|`|KvgesBMZaa	It depends on your family's schedule and at what time the baby goes to sleep. My daughter goes to sleep at 9 and wakes up at 8 30. It also depends on the length of the naps (s)he takes.|`|DNygQdmVaa	depends.<br>  My 14 month old gets up around 10am.|`|34b98d0fb9022e3e0f94cc0edf1474b0aa	Mine is 11 months and he goes down around 7:30-8:00pm and will wake up around 7ish. If I am still sleepy I can lay him next to me and tell him nite nite and he will go back to sleep until 10ish but that is as good as it gets.|`|6ivXGkKMaa	Mine goes to bed about 7:30pm and wakes up around 6:30 am.  It kind of depends on what works for you.|`|2WZGclIwaa	My 9 mth old and I get up at 7 every morning, but sometimes she does sleep in till 8, and I let her, I love the extra sleep!!
RwoN3E9Uaa	She crawls all over the house and we "chase" her<br>  She plays with blocks<br>  She "reads" books<br>  We read books to her<br>  She sits with our dogs and pets them<br>  She likes to take walks in the sling and point things out<br>  She practices with a sippy <br>  She plays with her assorted toys<br>  She pulls up on the couch and cruises around (I put interesting things on the couch to look at)<br>  She sits in front of the toy box and pulls out her toys one by one (I tell her what they are)<br>  She dances and enjoys listening to music|`|zPYyGw8oaa	my son is 9 months but he loves playing with the tupperware while i clean the kitchen. he adores going for walks and feeding our ducks. we also play a game I call "catch mommy" I crawl and hide then he comes and finds me and so on...he likes to be on the patio in his walker in the fresh air. he also likes to sit and play with his toys and games :)|`|706fa9fa645a352ed4dc9e7315894893aa	does your baby crawl yet?<br>  <br>  well if he doesnt...you can always give him lids from containers....my daughter loves those til this day and she 13 months almost 14.  but if does crawl you could find those play houses things that you can find at babies r us or toy's r us and when my daughters friend comes over (it's a boy)...he loved playing with the house. there is so much u can do. here's the link to it......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2265260" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
0KtFtnZVaa	Because black hair and brown eyes are dominant genes you will probably have a dark hair, eye and skin colored child. Your child will not be blond and blue eyed unless you have a blond blue eyed ancestor and have those recessive genes....and then it will only be a 1 in 4 chance.|`|n3IoftMFaa	Why is your avatar white then?|`|yjhpBM11aa	your baby will be a cutie pie! Congratulations!!!    YAY  !!!!!|`|PJLpvZQRaa	hehe similar to me and my hubby! They come out with lighter skin, and typically dont become too tan until they are older and spend more time out in the sun! so don't be upset if you baby comes out white! My hubby has dark tan skin, dark, eyes, dark hair and I have light brown hair, blue eyes, and pale skin! our first born girl has light skin, golden hair, and blue eyes and our boy has lighter skin still and dark hazel eyes and dark hair. im sure you're baby will be beautiful; every parent thinks so!!|`|d6r5hRjYaa	im married to a moroccan and im american with red hair. my baby who is almost 2 has very light skin, light brown hair and dark brown eyes. i  thought he would have dark skin but he doesnt at all. but he still looks like his dad|`|ca9dEvSAaa	lol I'm sorry but there's just no way to know for certain. You'll have to wait and see!|`|Coc593Ikaa	Your baby will look like Sir Ben Kingsley, from the moment he is born.|`|URpJodMLaa	Most likely the baby will have light brown skin and look on the darker side because everything dominates over the white gene. Though some cases it's the other way around. It all depends on your family history.|`|ig0klGBXaa	prolly black hair dark brown eyes and light browned skin.  I am white and my husband is Mexican our baby Girl is really dark, black hair, and dark brown eyes (just like her dad).  I think the dark colors will be dominant|`|9v2p7cwdaa	if your lucky your child might be as beautiful as mine.... congrats!!
AFi5kTiEaa	I dont think this is a huge deal.  If she goes to bed willingly, or as willingly as a 3 year old will let her be.  You could move her to her bed when she is asleep so she gets used of sleeping in it again, and she may decide it is more comfortable.<br>  <br>  If you would feel more comfortable with her going to sleep in her bed, you could take her shopping and let her pick out new sheets and a stuffed animal to sleep with.  tell her if she gets these...whatever she picks she should try sleeping in her bed.  You can also try rearranging her room and ask her where she would like her bed to be????????|`|AA10325228	why not put a toddler mattress on the floor|`|sw2R5A9iaa	either put the mattress on the floor or create a nest with lotsa padding.  this is a non issue.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	Get her a toddler mattress and put it on the floor or one of those fold out Dora or Elmo couches that fold out and let her sleep on that.  She wants to be on the floor, so be it.  She will get in her bed eventually - sooner or later - or when she realizes its much more softer.  She may just feel more comfortable on the floor.  Plus, you dont have to worry about her falling out and bumping her head. :-)|`|7euYlgjSaa	I don't see anything wrong with your daughter sleeping on the floor. But you should definitely give her a sleeping bag or a small air mattress. Something a little more comfortable than the floor. I think she will eventually grow out of it. So its no big deal.|`|J2gr1ogHaa	be glad its not your bed, my 2 1/2 yr old still sleeps w me!!!|`|HUsv9VU9aa	I think you should be happy that she wants to sleep on the floor and not with you. My 6 year old always tries to sleep on my bed and I have to show tough love and send him to his bed. :0)

b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	babies don't get rls.. they are active for other reasons.. first and foremost - happiness; why not wiggle all the finger and toes if the sun's up? :) another reason is that baby's nervous system has not been developed yet.. the nerves in an adult's body are sort of "insulated" with a layer of fatty tissue, so when the signal is traveling down the nerves, it's fine - but in a baby's body there is not much fat to go around so many nerves are actually touching one another, so that the signals get mixed up and instead of one hand moving, the hand and the leg are moving.. so the baby is in a constant motion.. at the same time, i think it's a nature's way to make sure that the baby's muscles develop and to keep mom busy :)|`|VXhOLgDEaa	I don't know if that's possible...but if it is...I'm worried for my daughter..because I have the worst case of restless leg syndrome and it drives me nuts!!! Especially when I'm trying to go to sleep I feel as if there's this little nagging feeling in between my knees that make me want to keep them moving...I swing my leg over the side of the bed right where my knee is and crack it in my sleep. If that makes any sense...anyway..for me to get relief I have to crack my knees ...and I don't think that's good at all ...I feel my knees get weaker everyday!?|`|AA11927655	I dont think so, they are not fully developed yet, are you sure she isnt having a seizure? maybe you should check with your doctor! good luck!
Xrwvu5Uraa	it doesn't sound like an STD at all. the plan B isn't 100% effective, but only 8% of women have gotten pregnant after taking it, so you never know. you should schedule a doctors appointment, because you could be stressing out which is causing your period to be late, and cause the spotting, or the spotting could be because you are pregnant. your doctor can tell you for sure. good luck to you, and don't worry about it so much!|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	sounds like you are going to be a mommy hope you are ready. good luck<br>  -tyfftaff|`|9EkFrApiaa	It isn't an STD.  That is just breakthrough bleeding from Plan B.  If you took Plan B I am sure you are fine-- or you are pregnant but I doubt it is an STD.|`|MOsStEbqaa	All you can do now is wait.|`|4RxE1Ad6aa	i am no pro but i think you are gonna have a baby|`|xBd96wvRaa	If you want a professional opinion then go to a professional and get one.<br>  <br>  No one online can tell you without an examination whether you are pregnant, have an STD or simply experiencing some bleeding as a result of the plan B pill. <br>  <br>  You need to be tested for STD no matter how low the risk base don the fact you consider it a possibility is pent enough reason to get tested. Even the mildest of treatable STDs can leave life long consequences when not treated.|`|s2PcI5D0aa	Plan B did the same thing to me! All i can say is on the day that you are supposed to get your period take a test when you get up that's what i did ?|`|FOUCV6Cmaa	Its now a waiting game.... Wait till your period should be here and take a test.  Trust me it will be the best sight in the world if you start your period!|`|H6Lc79EOaa	I'm pretty sure an STD wouldn't just show up within 6 days.|`|zF1MRdUFaa	want a professional opinion go to the doctors.|`|0f9a21a748ca2c979bde592494593878aa	Your friend's mom might be right--it could very well be implantation bleeding even though it was brown. Brown is the color of older blood, that's all. Implantation bleeding is typically similar to spotting. I didn't have that with my first two but definitely did with my third child. I'm not a professional, but I do have three children and help teach fifth graders about sexual education. Here's a website about vaginal discharges and what they could mean: <a href="http://www.pamf.org/teen/health/femalehealth/discharge.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pamf.org/teen/health/femalehe...</a><br>  <br>  In it, it says that it could also be normal spotting. If you haven't missed your period yet, then it very well might be that. If so, consider this as a warning from your body I guess. Even while on birth control pills or using condoms, you can get pregnant. Be careful. If you find out you are pregnant, please talk about it with your mother or an adult that you can trust.|`|1ikl5q97aa	You need to relax hunnie because stress is not going to help also if you've been having sex with your boyfriend and only your boyfriend for longer than 1 time the STD probably would have shown up before , so i wouldn't worrie about that . But the Plan B pill is very high for stopping the pregnancy and also is known for having "spotting" or discharge the morning after taking it , so do what you said and take the test after your supposed missed period and just relax , do something you like to do it will help you relax . :) Don't get stressed it will stop your period from coming when it should . i've been there and done that :) Good luck hunn .|`|2ObqoJbKaa	I doubt its an std. Bleeding isn't usually a symptom of an std. Also, don't freak out too much yet. You possibly could be pregnant, but if you took the plan b, that is usually pretty effective, especially if you took it within a day or two after sex. Your probably bleeding and spotting alittle, because you took the plan b. That pill has side effects, such as messing up your menstrual cycle. It can cause spotting, and can maybe make your period late. Don't worry too much yet. Just wait to see if you get your period. Take a test if you don't to find out for sure. good luck.|`|wJbaTS0Aaa	I absolutely understand what you're going through, but the only thing to do is wait. You can't draw any real conclusion until you've had symptoms for about two weeks. No STD would show immediate signs, and pregnancy wouldn't either. Trust me, I've had the same sort of pregnancy scares in the past. You did everything you were supposed to do- using a condom and then taking the plan B pill. Now all you can do is wait and take a test after your period.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|HUsv9VU9aa	I don't think your pregnant, but this is only my opinion. I hope you get your period.  If you are going to continue to have sex get on the pill or a safer method to take care of yourself.  You do not want to have a baby at your age. I got pregnant at 16.  Believe me, I had plenty times to think about what I was doing, but I thought it couldn't happen to me. Take care and be safe.
Xrwvu5Uraa	sometimes the second line is really light compared to the first one. a faint line is still a positive line. i'm not a fan of at home tests, but you usually get a false negative(like mine), not a false positive! i'm pretty sure you are pregnant!<br>  <br>  www.peeonastick.com gives a lot of insight about "faint and light" lines on pregnancy tets.<br>  <br>  go to your doctor! good luck and congrats!|`|p0prrzf2aa	if you got positives your pregnant! NO DOUBT|`|eu6UQElYaa	Generally when you get a lighter line on the second pregnancy test than you did on the first, it's because there is less hcg in your urine due to the fact that you've already peed that day so the concentration isn't as high, therefore the line is lighter.  That won't happen the farther into the pregnancy you get.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	It means your hormones are not strong enough to turn the line all the way, it still is pregnant. A line is a line.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Congratulations, Mom!|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	CONGRATS MOMMA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOUR PREGO!!!!|`|wnxOXBuKaa	Yeah, I'd say so especially if it was two different tests. <br>  You can do three things in this situation if you definately need peace of mind. <br>  <br>  One) call the doctor and they can do a blood test<br>  Two) Get another cheap test but take it in the morning when you first get up because the hormone level will be higher and the line may be darker<br>  Three) spring for the expensive test that gives you the definate "PREGNANT" or "NOT PREGNANT" in digital. <br>  <br>  <br>  But I'm pretty sure you are if you already have two with lines on them! <br>  Congratulations :)|`|1ikl5q97aa	you will only come out positive if you have the pregnancy harmones in your body so yes you are pregnant mommy . just being lighter than another means there probably wasn't a lot of pee on the stick , the more pee the more darker the line . Hope everything goes good ! Hope this is also what you wanted , good luck .|`|tvRll1Uvaa	If it says one may be lighter than the other and both tests came out the same way, I would say you are probably pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Definitely go to a doctor though...that's the only way to be 100% sure.|`|zF1MRdUFaa	mine was the same way, means you are pregnant. Usually the one line is the test line which is usually darker than your result line.|`|OdYABaIbaa	yeah ur pergo my test was the same way and when i went to see my Dr i was prego. but just to make sure see ur Dr|`|h5cFkP35aa	Yep, you're preggo. Doesn't matter if its not as dark as the other line.|`|PJLpvZQRaa	if you get two lines at all, faint or dark you are pregnant! have a happy and healthy 9 months!|`|8kTiRyi0aa	yes|`|LCuMtvbEaa	trust me this happened to me also...and i went to the doctor and i found out i was pregnant...that just means tht you are very early in your pregnancy even the doctor told me that...good luck with everything..|`|XQQ6ELVpaa	be a good mother :-)
bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	No one child may exhibit the same signs. But I would watch how the two interact together. And if something just seems "off" about their relationship. <br>  <br>  You can always just ask her in private. When her brother is no where around.|`|aRRQrwd9aa	can act more sexually, hard time getting emotionally close to others, have depression, and lot of other problems.|`|9aIotOULaa	I think it really depends on the individual person - their genetics/hormones, their counseling resources, etc.<br>  <br>  but i would guess there would be great distrust between the siblings, and possibly other people<br>  the teen might not how to deal with there emotions so they'd act out<br>  they might have a harder time developing healthy sexual relationships<br>  <br>  but many people who were sexually abused, with the help of others, have overcome their past and are completely functioning in society|`|7nev9Jxiaa	ummm probably she'll allways be calling him disgusting <br>  or try to be away from him as possible...<br>  allways screaming and fighting....<br>  HATE of course... <br>  everytime he gets close to her <br>  she'll scream and tell him to get away....<br>  is kinda obvious the behavior she'll have with him<br>  dont u think?|`|hvNPSOd1aa	Were you raped by your brother?<br>  <br>  If so, I suggest calling the police.
zVZgYEjMaa	Do I think adoption is right?  Well, no.<br>  <br>  But I think you may be asking a different question...  Do I think it is right for you to try to find your mom?  Yes.<br>  <br>  She may not want to see you.  And then there is not much else for you to do.  But you won't know unless you try.  It doesn't make sense to leave it up to her to find you, either, because she may be hoping you will seek her out, and she may not want to contact you first in case you don't want her to.  No one knows what the end of their search will bring.  All you can do is try.  And I do think it is good to try if you want to.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Of course it is ok to find her.  She may not want you to disrupt her life (her new family may not know about you) but I bet she would like to meet you privately.|`|kBp9IzQqaa	I don't think adoption is right because it is a subject in our society that is sometimes frowned upon since people don't have the proper information.  People in this society are ignorant, and unless they understand that an adoptee's heritage is not a pedigree of crack-ho's, then there is a problem.  We had a drug talk at my school, he said they SELL babies.  That's not true.  I think we can make a program for teen mothers so they won't feel pressured.  We can't do that now because the child would "suffer."  I have news for them.  They wouldn't!|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	Adoption is fine if done for the right reasons. <br>  <br>  If you want to search one day for your natural mother then do so that is only something you can decided.  If you do search its important to go into it with an open mind. If your natural mother does not want contact with you it will probably hurt but you would need to accept her wishes. Just as she should accept your wishes if she searched for you and you didn’t want contact. Hey even if the reunion didn’t turn out the way you expected its still possible you could get information medical / heritage information out of it. You might even find a natural family member who is open to contact with you.|`|9Ng5sqpnaa	personally i dislike adoption unless it's absolutely the only option. it's not right because it's not practiced ethically in many cases in our country.<br>  <br>  as far as finding your mom - i would sure try if i was in your shoes. if she doesn't want to see you, she will tell you and you will be able to handle it. usually that doesn't happen though. <br>  wondering and worrying is much worse.|`|ee7335f3bdae606bbfe534bef63fe2e0aa	I do think that adoption is MUCH better than the alternative.  I feel that every child deserves a loving home.  Be careful that you don't get your hopes up too high, not all meetings between bio parents and adopted children go well.  Good luck & I hope you have your happy ending.|`|JPBh5WT3aa	This is your mother, and you have every right to see her, and should not feel guilty about it. It is completely natural to want to know about your mother. Most first mothers desperately want to know about their kids too. Chances are your mom will too. And even if reunion isn't a bed of roses, you learn and you grow from there. <br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Adoption is wonderful. :)<br>  <br>  Are you happy? Did you have a pretty good life?  Loving parents? Food, clothing, shelter? Go to school?  Get help when you needed it?<br>  <br>  If so, what's wrong with adoption? <br>  <br>  Your mother was to young to care for you and may have had other problems. You are lucky you were adopted by a (hopefully) loving family that you call mom and dad.  <br>  If you want to find her go ahead and try. There is no guarantee she'll want to see you or talk to you.  If it was a closed/sealed adoption you may not be able to find her anyways.  Ask your parents if they'll help. Tell them you just want to try to find her and see what the deal is. If things go well...great (but your mom and dad are still the ones that raised you).  If not you still have your adoptive family and they ARE the ones that kept you and cared for you.:)<br>  <br>  Do what you feel you need to do. If it makes you feel better or answers questions you may have it's o.k.|`|7JEojMgQaa	I think it is better to know than not know. If you can not form a relationship, then get your information and walk away. It took my daughter 10 years to find me, she started at 18 also. She would search for a while and then quit when she got frustrated. It took us 9 years to spend the night together, in part because of the distance between us and in part due to our schedules. <br>  <br>  You are entitled to your information. If you manage to form a relationship you got the bonus package. Be ready for anything and expect nothing.|`|w2NA1KuXaa	I don't agree with adoption in many forms.  <br>  <br>  I think its a very personal decision to search, but I think any adoptee who wants to search is perfectly right to do so.  <br>  <br>  My reunion with my mother, sister, and her side of the family failed 9 years ago.  I contacted my sister again recently, and we are doing quite well.  But even though things didn't turn out all candy and roses, I will never ever regret searching and finding.  Of course there is a chance she won't want to see you, but it would seem that instance is a minority.  Don't let anyone make you feel guilty for finding your truth.|`|993127072b7a2a0e8c555efdb241a674aa	is adoption right?? there is absolutely no black and white answer to that. was my adoption right...yes. are there others that it was terribly wrong...yes. there is no one answer for it all<br>  <br>  now...should you find your bparents?? again....it is a matter of choice. i am a believer that you should. i did and i can without a doubt say it was the best thing i have ever done for myself. its not right for everyone. you have to make sure its what you want. you also have to consider the idea that she may come looking for you. you just never know. <br>  <br>  i think reunion is healing. even if it turns out poorly, you know. in my eyes its better than spending your life wondering 'what if'|`|nESfk0bXaa	I'm not a big adoption fan.<br>  <br>  However, I found my mama when I was 22.  The first thing she asked  was what had taken me so long to find her.<br>  <br>  It doesn't work out that way for everyone--but isn't it worth a shot?<br>  <br>  I wish you great luck.  Don't ever let anyone make you feel bad for wanting to know your history--you are curious and brave--good things to be!<br>  <br>  Hugs.|`|JP04HX6maa	Only if done for the right reasons.<br>  <br>  Without feeling as thought one "needs" anything that is only possible because OF adoption.|`|hY5JSbRBaa	I'm a birth mother and would LOVE nothing more than to have my son contact me. Some birth parents may not feel like this. If you can find her try a letter, see what happens.|`|rbv1FH62aa	I have to really wonder how many adoptive mothers answered this question..and how many adoptees who searched and found? Sounds to me like the majority of answers so far are coming from adopters. <br>  <br>  OP..I had just turned 18 when I lost my newborn baby to adoption, I was given no choice in the matter. When you are ready, by all means search for your natural mother/family. Doesn't matter that your Mom was only 16, I wasn't much older than her...and I never, not for one day forgot about my baby or ever stopped worrying about her. A piece of paper does not erase the fact that you had a mother prior to being surrendered, nor does that piece of paper erase the fact that your mother had a child that was legally hers, BEFORE the act of surrender. Let some of the more enlightened and knowledgable adopted people here guide you to information and online support groups for adoptees..it can be a great source of education, compassion and understanding. Only another adopted person who feels like you, can understand your doubts and inner conflicts. <br>  <br>  I searched and found my daughter..34 years later, reunion has served us both well, in a myriad of ways. It can for you too. There is only the very smallest percentage of surrendering mothers who refuse contact. The overwhelming majority of surrendering mothers welcome contact and reunion with their child. Be brave and trust yourself... and join a few adoptee support groups...I feel confident that you will gain much from talking to other adoptees who feel like you. Best of Luck and wishing you all the very best!|`|0f9a21a748ca2c979bde592494593878aa	Chances are, your birth mother has moved on with her life but probably won't be horribly upset by your appearance. I think the best way to find out is to write her a letter rather than appearing on her doorstep. Open up the lines of communication in that way so that she has the ability to take in the shock first before responding. Be sure to explain what you want and hope for but don't put too much pressure on her. I'd also talk this over with your mom that you have now. Talk it over with her what you're feeling and why and re-assure her that you love and appreciate her. Good luck.
Xrwvu5Uraa	YES. if you've been on birth control for 6 or 7 YEARS you could become pregnant.<br>  <br>  best to use the pill the condom at the same time...that usually adds a lot more protection.<br>  <br>  or not to have sex at all!|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	Use protection for the first two weeks of taking the pill at the exact same time as the day before.<br>  Two weeks allows your body to get used to it and start working properly. After you've taken it for over a month and if you miss it just once, wait a week before you can have intercourse without a condom.<br>  Your doctor should have told you this...|`|FOUCV6Cmaa	The doc always tells me to take the whole pack first.  Its better to be safe and wait an extra month before doing it without a condom.|`|70kh6VSoaa	yes you can still get pregnant you need to al least finish one packet before having sex unprotected|`|L8eNBQelaa	more than likely. you need to finish a whole pack before your b/c is effective.|`|PJLpvZQRaa	if you take them correctly it is very unlikely.|`|1a4a0605fa5bff2fbd65a4bcec08a3b5aa	It depends on where in your cycle you start taking the pills and on what kind of pill you're taking. The easiest way to find out how soon yours is effective is by asking your doctor or reading the insert that came with your pills.|`|oqcjAMJQaa	there is always the possibility that u will become pregnant. but for specific details, read the directions that come with the pills. they will tell u exactly how many days after starting the pill u can have 'safe' sex. good luck!|`|qJDdvybeaa	Yes, miss happy to have sex.  Slow down a little and let the pill get in your system.  Sometimes it can take months for it to be in your system to keep you from becoming pregnant|`|7aVPODR8aa	It takes three months for birth control to become 99% effective. Most people don't realize this and end up getting pregnant.
SEzIkGNiaa	Be yourself.  Show them that you are interested with children, enjoy having children around and are not just there for the money.  Dress appropriately.  Don't wear something to skimpy.  Wear casual jeans and a nice top.  Be honest.  Ask questions if you are not sure about something.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|sKu21AJlaa	I'm in my 20s, but remember babysitting!  Just make sure you take a deep breath beforehand, relax, and come across confident and calm.  If you haven't met the kids, really try to make a connection with them.  Maybe bring a simple craft or something you could do with them so the parents can see how you interact?  Good luck!|`|mHQN3Ml6aa	Be confident.  Let them know you are honest & reliable.

kpnSKV6Eaa	doctors reccomened that you try for 8 months before you start thinking that something is wrong.. i tried for 6 mos before i got prego... i wouldnt worry about it yet... keep trying. you must have sex while you are ovulating.<br>  going pee after has nothing to do with it, that protects from infection. but if you are truly trying maybe you should lay down for a bit afterword so that "it" can get up there instead of running to the bathroom to let it all drain out|`|JDxpjT34aa	It's very common for it to take longer than three months. Getting pregnant is not as easy as they make it sound. Keep in mind you only have a window of a few days a month that you can actually conceive.|`|BzYbEa6Taa	Even a couple that is 100% healthy in all aspects only has about a 60% chance to conceive each month so long as she has a regular cycle.<br>  <br>  Assuming that all of the above are met I would recommend that after sex you refrain from urinating instead place a pillow under your hips and lay like that for about 30 min.<br>  <br>  If after a year you still have no results go see a OBGYN  because it very well may be infertility.<br>  <br>  ~A~|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Ok I tried with my fiance for several months and wasn't able to fall pregnant and half the time I did the same thing... I would urinate right after because that is an uncomfortable feeling afterwards.<br>  Finally I started thinking the worst and went out and bought ovulation tracker and started taking prenatal vitamins (they help increase the chance of pregnancy) also have sex every other day because if you have sex too often his sperm count will not be able to regenerate and your husband could be shooting blanks!<br>  Also after intercourse put a pillow under your butt and sit that way for about 20 minutes after sex to let the sperm swim freely into your uterus.<br>  I hope I helped!<br>  Good luck and baby dust to you =D|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	no it really doesn't have anything to do with it.and it doesn't mean you are the one with issues either, if there are any at all.<br>  here are some things i hope will help<br>   take a break from sex for a week or so to let hubby's sperm count climb<br>   when he ejaculates have him hold it in instead of continuing on in the motions<br>   avoid eating citrus fruits or juices for the time that you and hubby take your break and for about 3 days after.....this is supposed to have some natural effect on sperm having to do with the ph balance of your body<br>   make sure that you are performing at the correct time by using an ovulation test<br>  <br>  <br>  most important of all relax and have fun<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	No.  that has nothign to do with it.  They say you need a good 6 months of sex before you can say something's wrong.<br>  Give it time.  It's been 3 months!!!!  You're only able to conceive like a whole 9 days of those 3 months!!!!!|`|JvbvGtrBaa	it could, your supposed to lay in bed for 20 mins to half hour.<br>  try doing head stands afterwards|`|gfIWn6QDaa	No no, going to the bathroom is perfectly normal. Hey, pushing against your bladder is gunna make you wanna go!<br>  <br>  But anyways, I would seek out professional help. You may be able to take a pill to jump kick your cycle and so on. Also, you may want an ultrasound just to make sure that there is no cyst or cancerous object lingering and preventing you from having children.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|rzO0RX9vaa	I had unprotected sex with my husband for 5 years before I got pregnant and then again for 4 before I got preggo again so probably not.  You could always go see a dr. if you need a little extra help and DON'T pee afterwards!  Put your legs up and hold that stuff in for as long as possible!  Good luck!|`|2dfb4da7f1768d9def3522c5622bf4b2aa	It can take a healthy couple up to a year to conceive. You should try using ovulation predictor kits to pinpoint ovulation if you have not already.

GL!|`|9v2p7cwdaa	don't worry about. it took me 6 months to get pregnant with my second child and a full year for my third. if it is really something that bothers you, go see your dr. they will have the answers your looking for.|`|8fyMtGjdaa	Going to the bathroom after wards has nothing to do with it, they are two different holes.

L8eNBQelaa	if you have any reservations at all don't do it. you could get pregnant even if you are using protection.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	NO! You should NOT!

If you don't feel ready to take on the risk of pregnancy (not to mention stds) then don't do it.<br>  <br>  Talk to your boyfriend about your fears. I wouldn't feel comfortable having sex with anyone that I didn't feel comfortable having that conversation with.  A guy who's worth having sex with won't pressure you into doing anything before you're ready.  So don't let him make you feel guilty or try to convince you.<br>  <br>  And just so you know, I'm not just talking out of my a$$, when my husband and I were dating (we were about 19, in college) we decided after we started having sex that we weren't ready to risk pregnancy so we talked about it and stopped having intercourse for a while.  Guys worry about this kind of stuff too even though it can be harder for them to talk about it.<br>  <br>  That being said, (depending on how old you are) you might decide you can live with the risks involved (and remember pregnancy isn't the only risk with sex!!!).  That's your choice, don't listen to other people who want to judge you, it's none of their business.|`|AA11865529	No. Don't have sex if you have fears and doubts about it. That means it isn't the right time for you. Wait until you are able to handle it if you do get pregnant. No birth control is perfect and there is always a risk.<br>  <br>  Do NOT double up on birth control pills. That can have serious consequences.<br>  <br>  Don't let BF pressure you into having sex. If he loves you, he will wait until you are ready. If he won't wait, then he doesn't love you and is more interested in his physical needs than your emotional ones. Not someone to have sex with.|`|GR07LyyTaa	if you have to think about it then no i wouldn't.. you need to be 100% sure and have no bad thoughts before you do.|`|hmQDjHs6aa	WAIT! Whats the deal? if u don't wanna be pregnant, don't have sex.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	What do you mean it would be safe?  The only way to be safe is to keep your pants zipped.  NO bc is perfect, even if you use it perfectly.  If you mean it's a safe time for you, there is NO guaranteed safe time.  If you mean he would withdraw before ejaculation, people who use the ejaculation method are called parents.<br>  <br>  Don't be having sex if you don't want a baby!  If you really mean to do it anyway, go see your doctor and get reliable birth control, then use condoms also.  Feel free to ask him about my answer to your posting.  Remember it takes a few weeks for pills to become effective.|`|sDAnuaBYaa	You should only have sex if YOU want to. If you feel uncomfortable about it don't do it and wait until you feel better about it. It is perfectly acceptable to wait. <br>  <br>  If you do want to have sex, but are just scared of pregnancy, double up on birth control methods, condoms and the pill, and you should be safe.|`|PJLpvZQRaa	no. pregnancy is a risk of sex, protected or not. If you do not want to become pregnant you should not have sex. there are other ways to please eachother without the risk.|`|5p0AW33jaa	there is really no such thing as "safe sex". if you are really afraid to get pregnant then better not do it. just wait till your ready and believe me it will be all worth it!|`|qaMrAspCaa	YOU SHOULD BE SCARED TO GET PREGNANT!!! THIS IS NO JOKE! YOU COULD CREATE A LIFE! DON'T DO IT!|`|EUTRJqCsaa	there's always a chance so no, if you couldn't handle getting pregnant then don't do it.|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	Don't do somethig you don't feel safe doing. Wait til you're ready.|`|0KtFtnZVaa	If you feel any anxiety about having sex then don't have it. When you feel ready you wil not feel worried.<br>  <br>  Also get on the pill. It will not prevent disease but it can prevent pregnancy if used correctly. Most states will allow a female over the age of 16 to get the pill from their doctor without their parents consent.<br>  <br>  Be responsible. You can get pregnant using a condom so be smart about it.|`|SqrYOiK7aa	NOOOO!!!   Don't do it!  yes, you should be scared of getting pregnant.<br>  Its always possible.<br>  Wait till your married, then you know for sure that your ready, you don't have to worry about that if you do get pregnant that the guy might desert you. Wait for true commitment. Its the right thing to do. Even since your asking people if its right, shows its not the right thing to do.   <br>  <br>  Don't let peer pressure get to you!!!<br>  Stay strong!|`|fec25f298a046824d209e22ca386b7f1aa	If you are nervous, then don’t do it.  Wait until you are comfortable with it, and never let anyone rush you into it or you will hate yourself for it. When you’re ready, you will know.|`|ig0klGBXaa	not if your scared you will get prego just goes to show you are not ready and should think about it some more.|`|7ZQT19Szaa	buy a really think condom. ask ur bf to put on two if ur really prtective. overall i think you should be fine sweet heart.|`|2dfb4da7f1768d9def3522c5622bf4b2aa	It's never 100% safe. If you don't want to run the risk of getting pregnant then do not have sex.

oYmZUO8Caa	I can definitely agree with you. I think sometimes people go on a whim and don't think about the consequences. I wanted to name my daughter Couture..but I was young and now realize it would be AWFUL to go through life with that name. I now look at more "classic" names.. I don't think I'd really go for "trendi" or "designer" names.|`|1A1ozEaKaa	it's a thrill i suppose; technically, the baby is theirs and they have the freedom to name it whatever they please...and quite often, that power is abused. Some religious names are hard to pronounce or sound bad when said in an American accent (ie mine) and sometimes, parents name their kids for the meaning. But Bronx Mowgli Wentz is inexcusable.|`|FsiG5WtQaa	Because they're trying to think of something that no one else has thought of. When I was in school, girls were known as Emily B and Emily F because so many kids had the same name, that there were referred by their last name. Parents aren't trying to make things hard for you, just don't realize that other people can't pronounce it as well as they can.<br>  <br>  and I like Bronx Mowgli, it's cute and original and has meaning to his parents.|`|B7nqTcttaa	I think they are trying to be unique and give their child some thing that is personalized to their child only. I like names that are different but that still sound nice and don't look made up. Some parents just go too far and forget that less is more 90% of the time.|`|XRzSxgUnaa	i dont know i like to spell things different but still reasonable. like Halie instead of Hayley. Aiden instead of Aidan or Aaden. Holli instead of Holly. Aaren instead of Aaron. <br>  <br>  But I'm not going to spell my kids name Jacovich and be like oh it's pronounced Will-yum.<br>  <br>  <br>  Whats your name?|`|3ca77814669342ed7f9e8a6abb737a33aa	I think its because they want their child to be unique. Also many parents might like the meaning of a specific name or how it sounds.|`|NePgB9b2aa	Just out of curiousity- what is your name? :]|`|Bz8tcAOyaa	Yeah...I'm curious too...What is your name? :)|`|6h03UjAuaa	Lol... I have a unusual name too... people always say it wrong, it has been 20 years, i just get use to it.... About your unusual name.... I really don't know, you should ask your parents... as you said is good to be different, I would rather want a unusual name than "Mary" or "Betty" ....|`|v1bFaKP1aa	well, my name is Dara. NO ONE ever gets it right even after I correct them. they always pronounce it darr-uh or dora, when it's pronounced dare-uh. Thats the first thing i would think if i saw that name. not darra or dora, it obviously donesn't have an O in it.|`|FS8n1FUQaa	I'm tired of it.  My friend named her daughter Mykynzy.  I think this crazy naming phenomenon is just the new, bolder generation of, "No, that's Tony with an I, and the Nevaehs of today are the new Heathers.|`|2rOQyvaKaa	We give off the wall in your face way out there names to our children. We got them from four sci-fi fantasy anime comic book geeks.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	I think people are just stupid and try to pronounce something stupid and hard when the name is obvious. Like my name is Tyffannie simple right??? NOOOOO I have people think just because it is spelled differently that is is pronounced differently and they just butcher it. Just like my husband and sons name. Entric spelled just like it sounds but NOPE they will call eccentric entrees all kinds of thing it is annoying|`|XZ8zBBpbaa	Why act like clones or robots and use the same name that millions of parents choose to name their newborns year after year?<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that it's ok to name your child something that people can't pronounce, but naming your child something that isn't on the top 1000 names isn't wrong. In fact, I'm purposely looking for names that aren't on the top 1000! <br>  <br>  I was the only Sherri in my class, in my church, in my extended family and in my neighborhood, and now at my jobs... and i LOVE that!<br>  <br>  People didn't have to be like: Sherri who? Sherri B, Sherri V or Sherri M??<br>  <br>  It was just Sherri =]<br>  And I want my kids to experience that too|`|PuRpsENEaa	I don't know. It sort of bugs me when mess around with spellings. It looks ugly and is annoying example and I swear to you i am not making this up. I know a girl name La-a! You know that is pronounced? Ladasha! And thats the spelling on her birth certificate :l <br>  Then an example of people trying to hard is with the name McKenzie. The weird ones are MacCenzee MkCenzie, it just looks gay!|`|tHEBPDenaa	they think they're being unique and creative when they spell their kids name really crazy and original... but i think they usually just look stupid. like, do you really need to spell michaela, mihkayhlia? does isabelle need to be spelled ihzobel? it's just weird.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	People who spell things wrong are generally trying to be unique. The thing most of them don't seem to get is that Emily - Emilie - Emileigh - Emilea - Emilee - Emmalee etc are all pronounced the same and therefore not at all unique! Many of them are uneducated or very young and make up names like Nevaeh and Kenzley because they think it's cute (really it says that they are 14 and childish).<br>  <br>  I personally have a popular name which I hate and I promised myself years ago that my children would get unusual names. I'm not talking Moonbeam Calyx and Axyanna Lilliput or anything; just classics that don't get used enough like Annora, Faye, Cooper and Sullivan. I don't like unpronouncable names unless they're ethnic. I adore Saoirse and Siobhan but no one here can say them so I wouldn't use them (but I wouldn't fault someone who did).<br>  <br>  It sucks that you've had so much trouble with your name but you're luckier than me, at least you like yours...
q0vKbocHaa	I'd try to explain your case, but I doubt that the Chinese government will comply, they are notoriously difficult. But if I were you, I'd just go back to taht providence and explain your case there, it would yield much better results|`|JUXpVYC4aa	?????? I didn't get one bit of that|`|zSABr7praa	Hmm..that's a really tricky situation.  It seems silly to ask, but I'm assuming coming back to the states for the pregnancy and birth is out of the question?  I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help, i'm interested to see what advice other posters will have for you.<br>  Best of luck, and congrats.|`|puCOYwMmaa	Is there a US consulate near you?  You could call them and see if they have any information or if they know where to point you.
5mh1XE1Maa	Yes, you should not be punished for something you did not even do.<br>  <br>  Here's what you want to do: Ask around about who would be the best Principal (if you have multiple principals) to talk to about this situation, than go to the office and make an appointment to speak with him/her. Be polite.<br>  <br>  Once that is done, and you get to talk to the principal, tell the WHOLE story (don't leave out a SINGLE detail), and be as respectful and polite as possible. I know it sounds lame, but believe me when I tell you...it gets you places. After the story, state that you do not believe it is fair that you be punished and recieve a mark on you record. Offer him/her to speak with the teacher that wrote you up about the situation. <br>  <br>  Don't ditch the detention. Trust me. You'll just get yourself into a bigger mess, and if anythin happens in the future where a principal needs to speak with you, he/she will see that (cut) on your record and not give you the time of day. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|p25p9jTYaa	don't go. this is NOT appropriate, and you don't deserve it. Tell your parents what happened, and ask them if you can stay home, because it's obviously not fair. Those guys are total *** holes, and they need to see that. Not cool stupid guys, not cool.|`|y7IiZwuYaa	its not your fault that they cant keep there hands off of you.... dont go and if they have a problem monday, ask them how it was your fault|`|eevOrwypaa	yeah that is totally unfair to you. but don't just ditch. Talk to a school supervisor about what happened. State that you know it was inappropriate contact for school, but you couldn't control what the boys did. Hopefully that will work :) If not get your parents to call the school. just don't ditch. that could cause more problems for you, such as suspension. <br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|Nt1Tz3zuaa	whatt thats ridiculous, just dont go and if the y give you a hard time about it tell them you didnt do anything wrong, becuase you really didnt. people in my school like makeout in the halls and the teachers dont say anything lol|`|pVaZty4Maa	if i were u i wouldn't go either|`|vzcXt2Dsaa	Go to your teacher and explain to her that you weren't involved in touching anyone. She'll probably be understanding. But if you don't go turn up to Saturday school without explaining, you might get into more trouble.|`|ZJz87tUCaa	Dude i totally understand that. But before u ditch the detention thing, plead ur "case" to the teacher first. and if that doesn't work get your parents in on it.
9eea524767f83cbb7a8107fff558ab83aa	It could be nothing at all but a simple cold.  But if you ever get the feeling that it could be something more don't hesitate to call.  Don't think you are over reacting because you have to be a advocate for your child.  <br>  But there is something called RSV that can be very harmful to newborns up to 2yrs old.  Adults and older kids carry it like a common cold (it is a certain strain) but in baby's it can be deadly sometimes.  99 temp isn't that bad but keep a eye on it.  There isn't much you can give her at this age, maybe if use a Humidifier in her room.  <br>  Good luck...|`|n6XYYyoLaa	as long as she is eating, the fever is low,  and she's not vomiting anymore that is probably fine; if she starts vomiting enough that it seems she's not keeping enough down, or having enough wet diapers, then i would def call doc back and insist on an appt|`|AA10747411	I'd want a second opinion.  usually temps rise at night, so if it hasn't risen tonight I'd feel better.  Still I would want someone to check her out.  Good luck.|`|EWETAH0daa	its bound to happen to most babies no matter how hard you try to avoid it. the doc is right since baby's can't regulate there own body temps yet so 100.4 says there is really some thing wrong|`|HRFaAyKOaa	Yes - unfortunately (I'm an over paranoid mom, so this has always driven me nuts) but your doc is right on. If you have a rectal thermometer, I would use that to ensure more accurate readings (be careful not to puncture anything). But, sometimes they will have a fever for a few days while their body fights off an infection and then poof, it's gone. If it gets up to 100.4, don't panic. It's actually not high enough to do damage at that point yet - but, it's a clear indicator that something is up and you need to head to the ER or her doc (whoever is open) to have her checked before it gets higher. Stay calm, keep an eye on her and remember that a fever is actually a good thing. It indicates that her little body is doing what it should be doing (fighting off her cold) and that everything is working properly.
qAkLi8oQaa	wow...for your sake i hope its your month too lol(just kidding of course)...his sperm should be fine|`|AA11764194	Since you are TTC better have sex once in 2 days to build up the semen quality..<br>  <br>  good luck and baby dust|`|nhhCow4haa	Im in the same boat as you, been trying for 7 months, this month we bd 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19! Hope it works! Goodluck. I heard somewhere that a mans 'average' sperm count can replenish in as little as 3 hours. Id say you will be fine|`|hwZMijykaa	If you're TTC, it's not really a great idea to do the BD EVERYDAY. It's true that the egg has a lifespan of 24 hrs. But sperm has a life span of 2-3 days. And your husband needs time to build up/rest so when he releases, it would be mature sperm and not immature sperm (which can lead to birth defects). So doing the BD every other day around the time you ovulate would be more ideal.<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust to you!|`|S3t69kh2aa	But you should have ovulated around Feb 5.  You may have missed it this month.
AtVRWrwCaa	it could just be from having sex the first time. Not to be gross, but depending on the guy's size it can cause tearing, and even a period. I would not think you were pregnant unless you missed a period.|`|H9Dr0Bxeaa	the day you go to the doctor|`|vLAGnmGEaa	That doesn't make any sense, but if you had it again then you can't be pregnant.|`|JoU7WTadaa	You said it was the first time for you...well I don't think it was your period the next week then. That's what happens the first time, or so I hear. I actually don't know. But I'm sure you could find information on the internet somewhere. But if it truly was your period, then you are not pregnant. If you're still worried, (or excited, however you look at it lol), you can always invest in a pee stick :) Haha those commercials;; "The most sophisticated piece of technology you will EVER pee on..."<br>  <br>  Toodles :)|`|zvnNHvNwaa	it takes probably 2 days im slmodt certain or within a couple of hours|`|64oOqELCaa	idk|`|s6Y2IsGHaa	means you need to wait another few weeks then take a test.  sometimes the preg hormone isn't detected right away so wait then take a test.<br>  Even though you had your period the next week i don't believe that's enough time to say you're not <br>  <br>  p.s. did you us any birth control methods?|`|lM6ePQLiaa	Your are not pregnant if you have your period.<br>  But don't do it right after you have your period. You are fertile 10-15 days after the 1st day of your period.<br>  <br>  You can know if you are pregnant if you're delayed. Take a pregnancy test just to make sure.|`|MpTgh6MMaa	i don't think you are pregnant. woman usually don't have their period after sex when they are pregnant. go use a tester if your not sure, i think it takes about 3 weeks to 6 weeks. im not sure|`|XdEiBZgHaa	umm usually if you have another period the your not pregnant...but maybe a pregnancy test or a trip to th doctor...sounds like something is up if you have a period a week after your first one...<br>  <br>  good luck|`|fca955beb49d4a429f82c81ab9b4f959aa	It takes atleast 5 days after missed period. Trust me i was pregnant before even though im only 14.|`|PlHjhwtAaa	means your body is responding to the sex, you probably aren't pregnant|`|g6QiwoLxaa	9 or 12 months.|`|m16eJuGzaa	im a dude so i wouldn't know the signs, but i suggest a pregnancy test
edHTskosaa	It's only been 2 weeks so I suggest that you wait it out a bit. Wait and see if you're period comes down. It's too soon for a pregnancy test. If you miss your period than take a pregnancy test. If you're not satisfied with the test than see you're doctor. If you can't afford a doctor or you don't want your family doctor to know you can always go to planned parenthood. <br>  <br>  Just don't stress now, it's too soon. Good Luck.|`|FwQ8Y8kGaa	Probably not. You're probably ovulating. It happens about two weeks after your period. When you ovulate, you discharge. I suggest you DON'T have sex now. Unless you're trying to conceive. <br>  <br>  But you may be pregnant. I'm not a doctor.|`|dSobv28maa	I havent been pregnant, but i heard it is.|`|SnanuNKiaa	either your ovulation, in which case it'd be the consistance to egg whites, Or you have a yeast infection.  if you had sex on your period more than likely your not, unless you have an EXTREMELY out of wack cycle|`|V1oq7FeDaa	well just wait. wait till your period decides to show up.and if it doesn't<br>  go take a pregnancy test or something. you're probably not.

reO9Dgmsaa	The most fertile CM, at the time of ovulation,  is like raw eggwhite, which it doesn't sound like you had.  BUT there are women who ovulate just fine and never have EWCM.  Creamy and watery CM is still fertile.  :)<br>  Your two days of VERY dry CM would signal to me that you ovulated on Monday.  <br>  I hope you conceive soon!  I miscarried in October too. :(<br>  <br>  **Since you have irregular periods, I'd suggest you take Vitex (also known as Chaste berry).  It helps with any fertility issues.  Don't take it if you take Clomid though, since they cancel each other out.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I know Vitex helps with PCOS too.  :)  Good luck!|`|KihffCc5aa	Oh hon, I'm so sorry that you are going through all the science of ovulation!<br>  <br>  As soon as you have the thick egg-white-like, assume you are ovulating!  Pains won't matter much unless you have poly-cycstic ovarian, or other probs.<br>  <br>  When you have the first signs of thick mucus, egg white, discharge.  That is the means that you are ovulating.

Coc593Ikaa	No I didn't do anything similar. I took the pill for over a decade and never did anything so silly. The pill only works if you take it continuously (excepting the non-active pills). If I for any reason missed pills, I used condoms for back-up. Why did I take the pill in this manner you ask? Because I READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!<br>  <br>  Do realize that you can become pregnant from your usage of the pill in this manner. When will your period come? Who can say. It might not even come at all...<br>  <br>  ADD: If the last time she had sex was January 21st, then it is not too soon at all. It takes 2-3 weeks after "the deed" for the hormone to begin to be detectable. And it has been 4 since her last unprotected encounter. I recommend getting a strip test rather than a digital. They can be harder to read, but they are more sensitive. Also the generic brand HPTs work just as well as their more expensive brand name counterparts.<br>  <br>  Also, try using this scare as an opportunity to talk to her about using her birth control properly.|`|e76nQKKZaa	If you're not taking the pill at the time you have unprotected sex, it is uneffective.

It's horrible that this happens and most parents (well some .. not most) just tell their children to work it out on their own..however when it becomes THIS serious then you have to act. I am SO glad you didn't do that.

koxMcDHuaa	OH MY GOD, Thank you for taking the words right outta my mouth! <br>  <br>  I cant stand it when these moms or dads dont do sh*t to control their bratty nasty violent rotten children! This IS my #1 pet peeve of all time!<br>  <br>  They "think their kid(s) are Gods gift to the universe and actually think that their kids are superior to everyone elses. <br>  <br>  To the parents that say their kids behaviors are out of control, yet they are highly intelligent. And possibly "understimulation is the cause" I say that your kid is actually below average intelligence, and if he/she cant sit still for 5 minutes or cant be reasoned with, or hits, bites or uses violence to control situations. Perhaps they are brain damaged or have a serious certifiable medical/mental condition. You should be seeking medical help, not ignoring it & thinking its a normal phase!<br>  <br>  Read all these posts! We all seem to unanimously agree that you & the monsters you created are quite annoying! Or type in the words "parents pet peeves" and see 1000's of other posts on the same subject that agree as well that you should not have children if you dont know what the heck your doing. Especially if you cant put in the effort it takes to turn them out into the world without pissing off everyone they encounter.<br>  <br>  Imagine the psycological damage you are causing because your are too ignorant to realize that it does affect them severly when they finally realize no one likes them, or wants them around & they have no friends.|`|EvXqkrvAaa	Although you do sound as whiny as many of the mothers on here b*tching about their "bad" kids I do agree with what you are saying. My advice to them.....smack your child more, take their tv and toys off them, give them no treats or snacks and do NOT show them extra love or attention. Make them accept the fact that if they misbehave they will get NOTHING from you. I normally get thumbs down but if they bought their child to my house for a day and compared their child to mine and how I deal with her 3yr old cr*p they would do exactly as I do. Also don't you hate seeing mothers in the shops say RIGHT! Onnnne, twooooo, threeeeee and then smack the child...OH no she's counting again how scary....ASK the child ONCE then TELL the child ONCE and then SMACK THE BRAT. No 1,2,3 sh*t|`|LQuCb310aa	I am not really sure if you are being 100% serious or if you are being sarcastically funny at eh same time but the latter of the two is how I am reading it nad this is one of the best little rants I have read in a while... I am a single parent of 6 boys under 10 and it is sooo funny to me how people do this CRAP though. I men come on you are past the point of redemption. What they should be doing is trying to learn how to raise the kid instead of being online first of all huh,...and not only that but all of the practices that other people list are obviously not going to be tried anyway, I think people form their little rants in a form of a question so they can get others to agree with them as opposed to actually wanting a question answered they just need to hear that they are not the only ones(hence the reason why they chose some answer similar to the question they gave in the first place) Takes one to know one I would say and bad company loves bad company...LOL...made my day thanks LOL!|`|eya1WDS4aa	Wow awesome job! i have been wanting to say something like this for a long time but never knew how to word it. i agree 100%. I started swatting my son on the butt when he turned 18 months old and started getting really bad with his temper. im also pregnant with my second and wanted my sons behavior under control before i had my daughter and he do something to hurt her. my son is now 22 months old and pretty much an angel! Its amazing what a little PARENTING can do huh! instead of trying to bribe them with things and  rewarding their bad behavior. I answered a question earlyer about a guy and his kid acting bad and another mother said bribe her that's what i did with my son....wtf? Since when did kids become the parents!!!!  That's why their are so many bratty kids these days that you see throwing fits in walmart. drives me nuts too. Parents need to be parents and not friends. You can spank your kids, and still love them. Its not like spanking them when needed is really gonna kill them or hurt them. All that spanking is abuse crap and it hurts them is just a bunch of crap. honestly if we where to take away everyting that could hurt our children then they would be living in plastic bubbles with no outside contact.  Thank you for actually putting this out there!!!|`|ORy1HG0yaa	Interesting thoughts. /shrug<br>  I just raise my kid like I see fit.|`|jLI0IgWkaa	ditto .<br>  <br>  I agree with your point of view.|`|BWVDKixeaa	I'm a teacher and for the most part I agree with you BUT I have known lovely children from horrible parents and horrible children from lovely parents. Oh and some children who are lovely but have siblings with behaviour problems.  Some children are just easier to manage than others and some need more work than others. I guess some parents aren't prepared to put in the extra work or are just so frustrated that they give up and give in (perpetuating the problem obviously). <br>  <br>  Parents seeking help (such as posting on here) know there is a problem but I think probably think the answers requiring action is all just a bit too much for them (hence choosing those in simular situations).  When you have let it get to the stage where your child is out of control, taking action will mean things will get worse before they get better (all hell will break loose like nothing even those parents have seen before but they need to stick to it and it will get better if kids realise they are serious and consistant).<br>  <br>  Maybe you could submit a small parenting tip along with your grumble per week LOL.  How to raise 4 very well behaved kids!  By the way, well done because it is a tough job.  I'm not a parent but I'm a 2nd grade teacher (I have to manage the behaviour of 20 plus students and they aren't even mine).|`|Mbgck2ifaa	Well, you have to think of it from their perspective, no one likes to give up admitting that they are a horrible parent, and even if they are a horrible parent, they still need to make it right and help their child. The whole hugging and showing extra attention helps if the child is feeling insecure, for example, when my sister and her husband got divorced their son had a really hard time, and was really confused, and he couldn't speak clear enough for people to understand so when he tried to talk he just got more frustrated so he'd throw a tantrum or hit. He missed his dad when he was with his mom, and vice versa, he was only getting 1/2 the attention he had been getting before so the extra attention helped.. but that doesnt mean don't punish him, we'd put him on a time out, and when he calmed down we'd give him hugs and tell him we love him, etc. Children have different ways of dealing with stress, and when they act out it doesnt always mean its cuz they have bad parents, just a less than ideal situation. so yea.. that's my opinion, maybe i can get you're opinion on my situation?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219214509AAWQ6ZV">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|TVqXrOq2aa	Too true, too true. i think parents these days are lazy, plain and simple. I hear more and more about kids not being potty trained until 4 or sometimes 5 years old. That was unheard of when I was a child. And bottles also at these ages, come on, grow some balls and stand up to your kids! No wonder they don't respect you and they spit, hit and bite. I am a nanny for 2 kids (5 and 3) and my 2 year old comes with me as well. The 2 kids that I watch get a new toy (no kidding) every week it seems. Every time they go to the dentist or reach a goal they get a new present. It's sickening! And guess what, they don't share, imagine that! <br>  <br>  Props to you for speaking up!|`|sLkruqYVaa	i don t disagree with you to be honest however i do think that a child can have a bad moment no matter how good the parenting is, ALL children throw tantrums at one point or another (as we all know it's usually in the supermarket cringe)<br>  <br>  As for hitting your children  or as you all say "smacking" (which by the way may sound nicer but is still just as violent) it's never OK, the only thing you are teaching your child by smacking him is that that's the only way mummy and daddy know how to punish, and when your child feels that another child has been unjust he'll probably "punish" him too.Does that seem all right to you, parents that punish by hitting? A parent who has decided to not smack or scream at their child is NOT a wussy parent it's a parent who has made the decision to show their child wrong from right without bringing unnecessary violence into their lives|`|3oJL2Go3aa	I totally agree. These are the type of parents whom kids are Troublemakers. I hate the parents who sit there and think its cute for their kids to be beating up on others. If my daughter ever did that she would have a rude awakening. I can understand standing your ground and not letting others pick on you. But when it comes to bullying then that is not tolerated. Just because the kid has social issues doesnt make them dumb or "special". It just means they have problem interacting with others and needs help. I agree with the get off your *** comment. I cant stand the parents that just sit back and expect the kid to raise themselves. I agree on not bending to their every cry. But when they sit there and reach out for help and your not there then they are going to be bad or as they would say "special". I know most mothers will not admit to bad parenting. But this is one mother who will if my child was like this. I would be saying its my fault and I did something wrong. My daughter is a year old and very well behaved. She gets a lot of hugs and kisses. We also have our time where I will play with her toys with her. I dont want my daughter thinking that Im a bad mother and I dont want her to feel like she cant come to me when something is wrong. I know when she gets into her teenage years that she isnt going to come to me about everything. But my mom raised us about how I am raising my daughter. My mom was the first person I told when I lost my virginity. I told her in the bathroom out of all places. But my mom is my bestfriend. I will tell her everything except my sex life. There is just things a mother shouldnt know. LOL. But I totally agree with the more hugs, kisses, and trips to the park.|`|xJW1RSaAaa	I personally am what some people consider a soft mother, BUT I never tolerate smacking or nastiness to other children.  I do not smack my child, and try not to shout to explain, sometimes I FAIL and do shout. <br>  <br>  I understand exactly what you mean when you say how would they like it if their child was being bullied. My son is really friendly and loving, and we went to a playgym and he kept following these other boys round, smiling at them. These kids were horrid!! They kept saying mean things to them and one sulky little b*gger actually pushed him over! His mother did nothing so I explained to him why not to hit or push.<br>  <br>  I DISAGREE WITH ALL the parents saying smack your child.  IF a child is smacked and verbally abused, neglected, unattached form their parents - the their behaviour is poor - but it isn't their fault, it is the parents.  Children who are smacked have lower self-esteem and get angry - what does anger lead to? Poor behaviour and depression in later life. Sorry for those who use this convenient form of discipline but it doesn't work. Unless of coiurse you make them scared of you - and then they aren't attached to you either so you both suffer.<br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/6/T060100.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/6/T060100...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/6/T062100.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/6/T062100...</a><br>  <br>  My mum used to smack me to get rid of her anger, and I have never gotten over the humiliation, the lack of trust, the lack of empathy.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER there are some children that have behavioural issues that may not be ontrolled by the parent, and occassionally this is because of higher than average intelligence - boredom to naughtiness.

n6XYYyoLaa	they recommend that you don't use sleep positioners or rolled blankets or anything in the bed with baby....they do say once baby is able to maneuver, let them go; our dd started sleeping on her side around that time....now at almost nine mos, she can sleep in some weird positions...but they also state you should lie them down on their back and where they go from there is ok to let them go....as long as their surroundings are safe...and by now, your baby should be able to move and support his own head and neck, and even if he can't roll back, he can wriggle around, bc he must have some strength to move that way in the first place...believe me, if you keep trying to keep them on their back for the first year, neither of you will sleep :O)

6Knhikr1aa	The baby can sleep in your room for as long as you want! And you can co-sleep if you want too. It's your family and it's up to you. Wherever your family is comfortable is fine! Co-sleeping is very safe and soothing for baby and easy to nurse! It also decreases the chance of SIDS.Having baby in your room in a bassinette is a good compromise because they are still close, but you can have your space if you want. Baby doesn't need their own room, but if you chose to do that, windows are not absolutely neccissary. Wait until baby comes and see where you feel most comfortable having her. For me it's sleeping on my belly on top of me or on my arm and I just latch them on when they get hungry. They sleep throughout the night that way from day one which is nice! You will get a feel for whats right for you. Don't worry what other people think.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	the baby can live as long as you want in your room in their bed; mine is almost 9 mos and still sleeps in our room...across the room, but in the room; she naps in her crib in her room during the day....i wouldn't use that room unless i just had too , i find anything without windows depressing, and baby would have no idea when it was day or night, so they might get them mixed up....|`|u94HOVz7aa	the only thing that would bug me is no fire ecsape|`|8yTP3jO8aa	I'm not sure where you live, but in most (maybe all, I'm not sure) areas of the US, a room cannot be considered a bedroom unless it has a window.  You can use it for a bedroom, but it technically isn't one, and isn't nearly as safe as a room with a working window.  Windows allow easy entering/exiting the room in an emergency situation.  If the hallway outside of the door is on fire, you could use the window to leave the room.  Or, with the layout of our home, if a fire was burning in the middle of the house, we could go out through one side of the house and enter our son's room from his window, rather than have to go through the fire.  In a disaster (man-made or natural), it is important to be able to get out of a room, and a room that only has a door and no windows is much harder to exit.<br>  <br>  So, yes, you could use the room as a nursery, but be careful and have thorough and detailed escape routes.<br>  <br>  A baby can sleep in the parent's room for as long as you want.  Do laws exist putting an age cap on it?  I doubt it.  As long as all of you are comfortable with it, it is fine.  My little boy started sleeping in his own room when he was about 3 months old, but right after Christmas he learned how to climb out of his crib and hated sleeping in his room.  He wanted to sleep with us, so he sleeps in our room (he's 22 months).  He doesn't always sleep on his mattress ( <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ps_l3Mkthtk/SZ5AwwTqsfI/AAAAAAAAADg/uUPRm-OE0Ps/s1600-h/alexsleeping.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ps_l3Mkthtk/SZ...</a> ) but he sleeps in our room.<br>  <br>  For newborns and small babies, sleeping in Mom and Dad's room actually helps reduce the risk of SIDs.|`|jYPeis3Saa	i dont htink its unsafe or bad, but wouldnt you want your baby to get some kind of fresh sunlight in their room? <br>  <br>  and for a room to be considered a "bed room": it has t6o have a closet and one window.|`|zPYyGw8oaa	It is not bad or unsafe, just be sure to leave door open for ventilation and plenty of light...baby usually stays in parents room up to 6 months then it is recommended to transition them into their own space:)|`|bc9inzicaa	Personally, I would want a window for my baby's room, but every situation is different.  If you think it is okay, then use it (i see no safety risks).  <br>  <br>  As for the sleeping in your room:  My baby is seven weeks old and he has been sleeping in a co-sleeper in our room since birth.

2SKd9996aa	He told you not to have sex because the sperm can live for days inside the vagina. If you had sex, were ovulating, and he removed the IUD, you would no longer be protected.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Yes you can get pregnant with it in place. Your symptoms may be your body adjusting to it being removed. If you don't get your period in the next week, go to the doctor for the blood test. Sometimes those HPT will turn a false positive after sitting for a while, that's why the instructions say not to read after...I think 5 minutes..or that general idea.|`|qMfBq3Vlaa	you can definitely get pregnant with an IUD,however, the chances of getting pregnant with an IUD are very low.<br>  but if you do get pregnant while the IUD is in, the chances are high that will end in a miscarriage. so if you think you are pregnant see you at once.

a57c02189e8a496f061aa934ef40807baa	Hello AKA....it's me. I think it was terizzle. Hahahahahahaha...<br>  Anyways....all 4 of my kids ate what I ate. Very rarely did I buy baby food. It was just too expensive and way too easy to mash up fruit, vegys' even certain meats.  In fact all of my kids teethed on Pork Chop bones...with a little bit of meat still on them. Great way to teeth any child...pass it on to your friends.<br>  As for spices, I think they're fine and good for the immune system. Some people will probably say that's crazy, but who cares! !  Just be careful that you cut it up into small pieces and only give her a couple at a time. Babies tend to be hamsters and save up food in their mouths before swallowing....thinking maybe they won't get more, or they just want more period. That's soooo funny because it's so true.<br>  Your a good Mom Kelly. Like I said, just make sure she swallows each piece before giving her more.<br>  Happy Daze : )|`|V1pMYowDaa	well according to WHO, a child of 1yr requires more than 18gm  of prot minimum daily in addition to daily intake for better development. <br>  Like you could give meat. <br>  but only factor here to be taken into consideration is whether it is cooked well or not.

Maybe try to give her a piece that doesn't have that much garlic on it or if you think she may have allergies she shouldn't have it. Most likely it'll be fine though. We're having something simple tonight...cheesy hamburger helper, green beans, and dinner rolls. Our 12 month old is having some apple sauce with his (:|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	Yep, as long as it's tender enough for your little one to eat.  People around the world eat plenty of spicy foods all the time, so there's no reason toddlers can't handle it.  Obviously, different people are sensitive to different things, so the garlic or BBQ could upset his/her tummy, but there's no way to know until you try.<br>  <br>  I have a 5-year-old, a 4-year-old, and an 18-month-old.  Last night, we had BBQ chicken (and my toddler loved it!).  Tonight, we had ham with mustard and brown sugar, corn, and salad.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	My 1 yr old has a lot of spicy, seasoned meat. Just make sure its tender enough and not gummy.<br>  <br>  The menu tonight was rice cooked in chicken broth, mixed with pea's. We had a late lunch so only needed a light supper. It was the first time both my kids having that combination and they loved it. My daughter rarely ever finishes her meal and she ate two bowls of it.<br>  My son loved picking out the pea's and eating it that way. :)|`|LbkLg4RFaa	Absolutely.  At one our son had eaten mild curries, Marinated (mint sauce) roast lamb, Chicken stir-fry and Beef marinated for stir-fry.  Having a nice easy lamb and vegetable casserole for dinner tonight.|`|u94HOVz7aa	as long as it is cooked well done it should be fine.
Kl1h5dCaaa	Sorry I don't understand the term *free time* or *relax*<br>  <br>  I certainly cannot relax on here these days. Hopefully you'll be on in the morning so we can run a muck, I need some serious cheering up.|`|5p7gpj36aa	read - YA - watch a show if I'm really tired and it's late (and I usually fall asleep)-   oh I got one --- take a bath!<br>  <br>  I used to light a fire in our old house -- and I love the wine answer - I think I might do that one tonight!<br>  <br>  Snowmobile!   that's cool I've never done that -- I used to 4 wheel all the time for fun... and used to horseback ride too -- or just go for a drive by myself with music on and no destination.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Free time? Oh, you must mean that time when it's just me & the baby and I'm trying to get him to sleep. Closest I ever come to free time! I'm either here or playing WoW. Which is starting to look like a better option!|`|J87cQEuzaa	I also search the web, check my email, watch T.V.

Right now, my oldest is in bed, and my husband is putting my youngest to bed.  I love it!|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	Depends on what kind of stress I'm feeling.  If it's just some "what a day" kind of stress, I get online or watch my favorite shows on tv.  If it's "OMG what am I gonna do now?" kind of stress, I pour myself a glass of wine, sink into a hot bubble bath, and sit there soaking in the tub until the water is cold.  ;-)|`|prqrQcd1aa	I do the same thing, in fact i've read all the harry potter books! I know i'm at 27 year old harry potter geek lol.|`|dPULl5hjaa	I'm a SELLER on ebay, craigslist, & YA!|`|G9ywiLqvaa	free time?<br>  ooohhhh!!!  you mean SLEEP!<br>  lol!

If you need any extra embryo's let me know!<br>  <br>  Emily-noooo TRAIN him! :)|`|lzivF4Idaa	no. maybe oprah will though....good luck with that.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	What if you had sextuplets after having twins you couldn't care for, and TLC gave you your own reality show, free vacations, clothes for your kids, chefs, housekeeping, minivans and a million dollar home??  Jon and Kate Gosselin could give you pointers!!!|`|NDQS5HJyaa	LOL i was wondering where the hell she got the money for it. Just makes me think less of Dr Phil, actually. I used to be the type of person that would defend him, especially after the whole Britney Spears thing... but this just tops the cake. Maybe Dr Phil can help with the recession too?|`|AA11021960	WOW are you kidding me!!!!  Not that there was a whole lot of interest in Dr Phil as it was, but I have lost all respect for him.  This woman has been quoted stating that she completely wasn't stressed because she figured she would live off donations!!!<br>  Dr Phil- the enabler!|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Maybe. Who are you going to get plastic surgery to to look like? Madonna? Sheryl Crow? Some other celebrity that's adopted from different countries?|`|XOtOMncwaa	ha ha i follow that story everyday, and now she's telling people that she NEEDS a van! So I'm trying to find a way for my fiance to get me pregnant with 9 kids (not really but....), so I can out-do her and live the high life, but I will throw in more things then a home and a van... I mean seriously... <br>  That woman really disgusts me... she's gonna have a hard road ahead, and eventually her story will get old, but I guess she's hasn't thought of that yet... she'll probably just get pregnant again. I mean I'm all for people having children, but having children for money and publicity is just sickening.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I missed something didn't I.<br>  <br>  I say go for it, if you want that many kids, personally my sanity means a lot more to me than a million dollar home.|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	Must be nice!!!  After all the publicity and "donations" she can afford a nany for her kids too!!  <br>  <br>  Save a room for me, my kids and my pugg.. my pugg is great but eats cats.. sorry Smile hehe|`|RD05jXYwaa	too much information too many questions. tmm|`|6IJScRyeaa	no way!?<br>  just goes to show how right i've been about him. he's an enabler.|`|MOM1ljWNaa	i don't really know|`|87WOSjwgaa	What?
j2mRop0laa	Do you mean like a child writes a story about he gets fed nothing but coal and lives under a bridge.. yet, obviously the teacher sees the child eating healthy packed lunches and knows the child gets off and such and such house from the bus? Then no. A child is just using their imagination and it should be taken that way, not reported to CPS.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	No way.<br>  <br>  If that was the case, almost every kid would be in foster care right now.You cannot be around your kid 24/7.You are not responsible for what others show your kid or what they read to your kid when they are not in your care.<br>  <br>  Also, reading and seeing are totally different than actually being abused (unless a parent is showing their kid porn or something.Now that would warrant CPS' attention)|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Do you mean hearsay? No. Something they saw as in witnessed as in abuse? Yes.<br>  <br>  It's a fine line to draw, in general they should have some sort of proof, though it is difficult when they have instinct a child is being neglected but nothing concrete (and they're right, and later the child ends up in hospital or whatever).<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|AA11537580	depends<br>  if the parents purposely showed the child porn  then yes<br>  if the child sees his mother beaten every day then yes|`|f339a9f3cf7d571157484d675d6af3b7aa	If they did not witness it they would have to get irrefutable proof of whatever they read or saw.|`|prqrQcd1aa	It honestly depends on the situation here. Many situations come to mind, and I'm not going to get into each one of them.
3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Yes, it does sound like depression.  And there is no reason to feel ashamed of or embarrassed by it.  It is simply a chemical imbalance in the brain.<br>  <br>  Your OB is likely familiar with this.  I know mine has me fill out a survey on a regular basis to judge how I am doing so she can intervene if necessary.  I was on meds for a while (prior to pregnancy) for depression, anxiety, and OCD.  I know it is hard initially asking for help...but you will feel SO much better once you get that help.  The best way, imo, is to just be blunt and honest.  Until Monday, try and treat yourself....maybe a nice bath, get a pedicure, etc.  Don't hesitate to get ahold of someone immediately if you do have thoughts of hurting yourself or your baby.  Best of luck dear.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Call and ask for an earlier appointment.  Print out this posting and tell him it's yours.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I agree with Cindy. Printing this will explain everything. He'll be able to help and guide you through it. =D|`|seU9VwIJaa	The way you're feeling can actually harm the baby. I agree with the first post. Print this out and tell your doctor what's going on. It won't get better without help. My older sister went through the same thing and said the best thing she did was tell her husband. Your boyfriend should want to help you as much as possible. <br>  Don't be embarrassed! More people go through this than you think! Hormones are evil. I will even cry at the most lame commercials. <br>  Congrats on your little one and good luck! Everything will be ok! =)|`|PYafv6gSaa	i say your obgyn for answers he has helped more than just you at prenatal depression<br>  all signs lead to it and it will continue after the baby is born it is not your fault and you are still beautiful pregnancy is beautiful you feel like this because its sad to watch your body change  i still have trouble realising but in the end your child will think your beautiful and your child loves you and to a child you are the most beautiful thing|`|9v2p7cwdaa	i would call in and ask to be seen sooner. dr are good when it come to pd. they know it is to be expected. you have nothing to be embarrassed about. it happens to a lot of us. i had it with my second child. they were on it like white on rice. call the dr's office, tell them whats going on. make sure its a woman if you feel better talking to another woman. mother seem to forget from time to time that we are most important. take care of yourself to be there for you child.|`|FOUCV6Cmaa	Hang in their honey it will get better.  I have suffered from post partum depression and really was embarrassed to tell anyone too.  It only made things worse for me and my family in the long run.  I had the same symptoms as you and felt as if I had no where to turn.  Talk to your doctor that is what he is there for and he knows all about that stuff.  Once I told my dr how I felt it made it easier and he helped me out a bunch and had different strategies for me to try.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	I think when you go to your obgyn apt. that you should just say "hey, i have a concern........" and tell it. Trust me talking to people will make you feel so much better. I would see if you could get a councilor and so you could go maybe once a week just to let your emotions go. It will help you and your baby. I hope the best for you and by the way I so understand your feeling on your body but trust me it is SOOOO worth it. Please talk with someone though. <br>  Tyffannie mother of 2|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Nothing to be ashamed of. I think this is more common that you might think. But most women don't get help for it,they just chalk it up to pregnancy hormones. <br>  I think you should focus on getting help and feeling better and not so much worrying about what someone will say. And I don't think anyone in a professional field would dare say anything to make you feel bad about this.
UTjWlj9Yaa	Mine have gone up almost two cup sizes and haven't stopped hurting since. They have also started leaking collostrum, which is SO fun, let me tell you! I use a body butter with Vitamin E infused in it. I am 21 weeks pregnant with no stretch marks as of yet, knock on wood.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	yes cocoabutter is not a bad idea, esp to start now and use it faithfully!<br>  <br>  it doesn't seem that your boobs would be growing already<br>  <br>  mine didn't really grow until the end of my fourth month and well into my 5th.<br>  <br>  sore and swollen maybe but nothing too noticeable.<br>  <br>  good luck to you|`|1VOsRV8Maa	Yep! Normal! My boobs are big normally, and at 8 weeks they were about the size of footballs! LOL! My husband loves it, but I hate them! Most likely, if you're prone to stretch marks, you won't really be able to prevent them. But, if you use cocoa butter, at least your skin won't crack or dry out IF you get stretch marks. Believe me, I put on SO much cocoa butters, oils, lotions, creams, and my tummy STILL looks like a map of the moon! LOL! Good luck! Congrats on baby! God bless!|`|DTVJtHYLaa	yea mine started getting bigger very soon i wen up a cup size by the time i was 13 weeks i delivered at 21 weeks due to a weak cervix it's been a month now and they haven't went down i guess there here to stay..lol|`|L8eNBQelaa	yes it is normal. you should start spreading on the creams, oils, and butters now. hopefully they will work for you because they sure didn't for me. good luck|`|J2f5ZzSnaa	Yep, that happened to me. I would lotion them all the time! I did, and got stretch marks anyway...|`|PYafv6gSaa	its normal and stretch mark cream will help also buy some lanolin cream to rub on your nipples it will help with the pain of breastfeeding it prepairs and repairs your nipples|`|ig0klGBXaa	completely normal.  They only get bigger so be prepared and yes it is a good idea to start putting cocoa butter on them now.|`|8kTiRyi0aa	yes
HUsv9VU9aa	Girl, I wish I was there to tell that boy to shut up and tell everyone to stop laughing. But truth is...I'm not. And I know that is very hurtful.  The only thing you can do is "let go". Which means let go of your fear and just go up to your friend and talk to her. Everything with time passes and this will pass.Sadly they will find someone else to make fun of. Just hang in there and keep your head up!|`|7ZQT19Szaa	tell the head principal that u are having some trouble. if that doesnt do it, tell your parents so they can deal with this one on one with that girl's parents.|`|hvNPSOd1aa	This will help you.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRH...</a>|`|OK9SqlPbaa	Just act like you dont care what they say, if its not true then you shouldnt mind it|`|MigBOiUPaa	ok if i were u i would just laugh along with everyone when tht boy says tht sh!t out loud again. and just be like u guys r so stupid if u believe tht!<br>  <br>  and dont let tht mess get to u. and if it does get to u dont show it to them. tht will just give them the satisfaction tht they're rly hurting u.<br>  <br>  just keep ignoring it. and dont live in the past theres a reason why ur friends didnt make it the future with u.<br>  <br>  make new friends and have fun! dont ever let anyone break you down. no matter what!|`|p25p9jTYaa	well... obviously ignoring hasn't done anything, pay no attention to answers to tell you to do that. Don't stoop to their level. And definitely DO NOT go to a teacher because that's just going to cause more issues. Maybe try confronting her? Ask her why she's doing this when all you did was, well, nothing. Tell her that there's no point in doing this, and it's just immature. Like I said, stooping to her level is not going to improve the situation in any way. I really don't even see how people would believe a rumor like that. You could try making jokes out of the rumors. Be creative, I'm sure you'll come up with something. It's just a teenage girl acting like a five year old, and sh!t like this is going to happen all through out your life, you just have to stick it out or attempt to improve the situation.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	Don't give them the satisfaction of reacting.  Just hold your head high girl.  You know the true story, and anyone who truly wants to be friends with you is going to be willing to listen to you and your take on the subject rather than what some idiots think.<br>  <br>  They're just trying to get under your skin.  Don't give them that satisfaction.  Tell them they're just jealous of the dog =]|`|uAzToWC7aa	ask your friend what has caused her to act like this, and try to become friends with her again. but instead of looking sad, look confident and ignore what they say, because they only feel insecure about themselves, so they need to make themselves feel better by putting someone else down.|`|lPvfWzHZaa	stop complaining<br>  take a deep breath<br>  go to bed|`|wRckyuh6aa	Okay well don't cry. I've been in this position before. If you just ignore them and if anyone asks you just laugh and be like um no that's not true. I know it will be hard but hold your head up high and don't let them get there way by hurting you. Do you do any extra curricular activities? If you don't you could start doing one. Trust me it helps taking your mind off it. But yea there's this girl who has always been a B***** to me and puts me down all the time. What I do is try to keep my distance and have as little to do with her as possible. If you do have to talk to her, act like nothing has happened and be real nice to her, this will surprise hre and hopefully she'll leave you alone. Hopefully if you don't respond to her immature bitchy behaviour she'll get over it and move on.<br>  <br>  best wishes.
5B02WP2waa	<a href="https://account.live.com/SettingsPage.aspx?mkt=en-ca" rel="nofollow">https://account.live.com/SettingsPage.as...</a><br>  <br>  ?_? I think it should work. Sorry if it doesn't.
SJx9IWWtaa	I agree with sofia and theos mom...make her fix it!  The impact of having to fix her mistakes will last longer than a spanking or time out.  <br>  <br>  Try a reward system.  I know it sounds silly, but make a calendar and let her pick out a "reward" at the end of every week if she doesn't get in trouble ALL week long.   As her behavior gets better, extend the days or add on other things.  Like maybe doing all her homework AND being good all week etc.  You can make up one for you son too, that way he doesn't feel left out.  :D  Some kids just respond better to this kind of thing.  <br>  <br>  We did this for ours because she kept faking being sick for attention.  If she goes to school EVERYDAY for the whole month she gets to pick a prize.  (We typed up little slips of papers with pictures that say things like "rent a movie", "get a $10 toy from the store", "get to play games till bed time" etc)    So its all up to chance as to what she gets.  Though I have to admit because of money reasons the game is a bit rigged...odds for toys or going to the movies are far lower than family game night, or an ice cream cone from McDonalds...  But you can make the rewards anything you think your kids might want.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped!  Sorry if it was really long.  :D|`|Jswomud7aa	You can go to Home Depot and buy the materials you would need to fix it. Depending on how deep the carving is you probably only need wood filler, sand paper and wood stain. <br>  <br>  Make her FIX IT! It's a perfect lesson, teaches her a skill she can use in the future AND the headboard gets fixed. It's not exactly a fun thing to do either. <br>  <br>  I would also ground her for a week. She KNOWS she was being destructive and it wasn't something she should be doing.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Make her work for the money that it would cost to have it fixed. Also take away tv,vidio games, phone, friends house|`|rNvXWMOMaa	I disagree, I'm not a fan of spanking either,<br>  But when scolding, explaining and grounding doesn't bring<br>  the desired behavior, it's time for the old fashioned spanking.<br>  <br>  The humiliation of being put across your knee at the tender age of<br>  9 will have her thinking the next time she decides to do some<br>  vandalism in your home.<br>  <br>  You must put a stop to this before she vandalizes her school<br>  or someone elses property.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry but a spanking is called for in this case.<br>  Mind you, palm of your hand on her butt only..<br>  Spank but don't abuse.|`|AEAxZEveaa	It sounds like she's looking for attention. If grounding doesn't work, I doubt taking things away or even spanking would work. I think you need to work on your relationship with your daughter. I'm not saying you're a bad parent or you're doing anything wrong, but I just remember my relationship with my poor mother. She would get mad at me for something and I would retaliate and then she would get even madder and I would get back at her again. Then she couldn't understand why I would get so upset when she would compliment someone else's child. I just wanted her to appreciate me the way that she appreciated them. I was too young to put this into words, but I think you need to understand where this is coming from. Sometimes acting out isn't about being a bad kid, it's about trying to get a parent's attention. You can punish her all you want, but if you're not getting to the source it's never going to get better.<br>  <br>  I also agree with the people who said that you should sit her down and have a calm talk with her and ask her why she did it, then tell her that she has to help you fix it. I think she will understand what she did wrong and that you are concerned about her feelings (ie why she did it), but she will also understand that it's not appropriate and that she has to pull her own weight in the family. I think it will definitely make a point more than a traditional punishment.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I would have her work for a new headboard.  My sister and I used to do little destructive things like this, I don't know about her, but I'd just get in a mood and do something that seemed mildly destructive at the time and then been like "... oh crap WHAT DID I JUST DO" like I just wasn't even thinking about what I was doing until it was done.  Making her work to replace the headboard would make her think of the value of that headboard and make her think more about what she's doing.|`|nSyYo1TGaa	well, many people are not fans of spanking but some strongly belive it works. so what i would do as a mother is i would spank her. you say she does not listen even when punished other ways, so i think spanking her would be approbiate in this situation. i actually had a similar situation not to long ago with my son, i spanked him and his behiavor has straighted out. so try it.|`|Mm5NsrF8aa	you have to figure out what is a punishment for her...take away TV, or computer, phone time, time with friends, or doing more work for no allowance to pay for the headboard...she is smart, willing to do what she wants and take the punishment she expects you to give. Find what works as a punishment for her|`|WKgvwCNZaa	Well, you try to take away some stuff of hers, maybe her phone, computer. Have a good talk with her, ask her why she does it. And tell her what is wrong with he behavior and how she can fix.<br>  <br>  Tell her that behaving like that is not okay. <br>  <br>  Good luck,|`|87WOSjwgaa	Take away tv, video games, friends houses etc. Make her do more chores and make her write sentences.|`|ij5ivVUWaa	Make her give you money to pay for a new headboard. Make her work for her brother for 1 day.|`|gtTIILgyaa	Make her pay for the headboard....she can "earn" money by doing chores around the house....|`|GDnJYq0Aaa	bear butt spanking. If grounding doesnt work
oHO0XOQVaa	Duct tape is what I would use. Duct tape it to the spiral, or first page and back if isn't a spiral. Leave a little space between the spiral and page so the two pieces of tape will stick together right there, that way, it will be easy to open and close because the tape will be a hinge right there.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	duct tape it then draw on it with marker. make it look cute :)|`|VmuLzz0Waa	1.tape it up or bye a new one it's only common sence.
IlIjGTdiaa	It all really depends on whether your story is a romance, comedy, thriller, crime etc. The name can help you a out a lot. Eg, Melanie Sophia Foxx in a romantic story can play on the word Foxx. Melanie Sophia Parker, or Petrick sounds like a crime story etc.<br>  <br>  So choose the name based not only on what sounds best together, but what name suits the personality you want in the story, the genre, the age etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Parker I love that name with Melanie|`|tmckNa4baa	I agree with the first one, Willows is a beautiful name! =D =P|`|hCpCvT0gaa	FOXX OR WILLOWS i like them both its like a kind of natural last name witch goes. i like Willows more though!!!!

Im very hormonal. There's not much you can do about it. Just let out your emotions and express yourself. Its healthy to do that. Also, try talking to family members and friends who can make you feel better and be there to comfort you. They won't last forever. I can't wait tell mine are gone. good luck.|`|qgJLZPDJaa	if you wanna hear crazy...i called the cops on my boyfriend twice in a week because he was getting on my nerves. <br>  <br>   i cry when oprah comes on.<br>  i cried when mcdonalds ice cream machine broke<br>  i cried when walmarts green apples werent up to par<br>  and when americas best dance crew is on.

a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	It is best to wait till you missed AF for at least a wk b4 you test as testing too early may result inaccurate reading.. GL|`|jQnxo57yaa	Some tests let you do it 5 days before your missed period however....it is usually on a 50% chance it will be right.  the longer you can wait the better chance you have of getting an accurate answer on the HPT.

Ok, with my first son I took a test about 3 days before I was supposed to start. It was so positive. Then with my second son I was like you I just couldn't take it sooooo about 5 or 6 days before my period I took a test. I know that's early but it was positive. It was so light that we could barely see it but it was there.<br>  <br>  I'm a very impatient person. I would test before my period but that's just me. Just know you could get a false negative.<br>  <br>  Hope my answer helped. Lots of baby dust to ya.|`|sK67bBy5aa	I soooo know how you feel!! The wait is killing me!!
f13a57f6d14edd4a8467dfc406d92b60aa	Your period changes are due to the decrease of hormone levels in your body which was triggered by stopping the birth control regimen. You did have a period it was just lighter than usual. Due to that fact as well as the fact that your pregnancy tests are continuously coming up negative for hCG (pregnancy hormone), i think it is safe to say that you are not pregnant. Your pregnancy symptoms such as tender breast, and nausea can be caused by the hormonal changes that your body is going through right now. <br>  Hope this helps|`|9EkFrApiaa	No...just the bc waring off.  You aren't pregnant.|`|e685416e5feb3fff30918d919b216b83aa	Sarah,<br>  <br>  I think you might be pregnant|`|KHVRElGZaa	well if you had your period than no you are not pregnant. It doesn't matter what color.|`|s2PcI5D0aa	LOL well i just have to say that as soon as i went of the pill i had a little abnormal bleeding and such but by the time the next month came around everything was back to normal. I am 20 weeks pregnant now with my first and i have to say my husband and i were the same way as you and your BF as far as the bedroom scene goes. What i think is so funny about what you said was at the end you said you were leaving it in gods hand and ya know we said the same thing and by the next month i was knocked up lol!!! Its funny how when we said that it happened like BAM! I would say you are safe but if your really worried you might want to go have a blood test, that never fails! Oh and do you have any of the symptoms you had with your first pregnancy? That's usually a good indication?
rNbNIEAIaa	first of all don't stress. i also have pcos and have been ttc for 2 years <br>  never lose hope and especially, don't stress,<br>  <br>  i'm also taking metforming and provera to induce my periods, and i'll start clomid on day 5 so hopefully it will work for us, <br>  <br>  and don't feel like a failure, your body may not be ready to get pregant so just give it time and stop trying so hard....<br>  <br>  that's all i can say, stop stressing and don't lose hope|`|GLJkGgloaa	Dear Friend,<br>  I know that your struggling. It hurts.<br>  I really wish you all the best.
2da81cc85aeb7179918ba4daff446df3aa	Honestly, I don't think it's good to travel for so long during pregnancy.  If it were only one day then yeah but since it's 3 days there and 3 days back I really think it's too much on you and the fetus.  You don't want to risk going into premature labor at 23 weeks, this is when it's most dangerous to have the baby.  If you were in the beginning or end of your pregnancy then I'd say the risk is less but right in the middle is not a good idea.  Why don't you have him drive by himself and you fly and if he does't go for that then suggest to him that he take a sleeping pill or a Xanax about an hour before the flight.  My sister is afraid to fly and she did just that when she came to visit me.  She couldn't actually fall to sleep on the plane but she was very relaxed and as soon as she arrived to my house she went and took a good long nap.<br>  Best of Luck.|`|PEw2L6Mgaa	y dnt u fly there and let him drive. It wouldn't be to good for you to be riding that long without resting comfortably.or you could tell him you talked to your doctor and he said u should fly|`|fc5KHr6aaa	Wow, he must be really scared of planes! I can't imagine spending 3-4 days in a car instead of choosing a 3-4 hour plane ride. Just tell him that you will be having to stop and pee every hour, and that you get uncomfortable very easily. You could add up the costs of gas and motels and see how that compares to the cost of a plane ticket.

Just because most dads I know <-- keyword there so I'm not stereotyping...are the workers and everything and the moms are the ones that are always more involved in the kids lives so they husband sees it as not caring for his kids, but babysitting them.

I know quite a few women who have to "ask permission" to have a night out and worry how to ask him and try to catch him in a good mood.<br>  My husband actually gets annoyed if i have a night out and someone says he's "babysitting".. Like he says he's the father NOT a sitter.<br>  A good friend of mine has 3 children to her ex, when they were together it was rare she got a night out and when she did he'd moan about having his own children. When me and her went shopping for my wedding outfit he said to her "so you will only be an hour then"? um she pointed out 20 mins to get there 20 mins to get back , and he said "yeah and another 20 mins to shop"...OMG we were still on the bus going there when he phoned to ask how long she would be.<br>  My hen night and he was phoning every 10 mins making the kids talk to her, if she did not hear her phone he would send a nasty text.

My friends partner phoned her and accused me and her of having men at my house..

0f9a21a748ca2c979bde592494593878aa	With true labor, the contractions won't come and go... they'll just keep on coming and they'll get closer apart and not fluctuate. If your contractions are regular and increase with timing and severity, then it's getting closer. If your water breaks, then it's definitely time to go to the hospital. You might be disappointed if you go back to the doctor... at this point, you're probably not too much more dilated. One thing you can try doing is putting up your feet and seeing if that slows things down. If it does, then chances are, it's not the real thing yet. Don't worry, the time will come soon I'm sure! Then you won't have any rest--babies wake up every 2-3 hours! So, get as much rest as you can. Be sure you have everything packed. If your contractions get down to five minutes apart or if your water breaks, then it's time to go to the hospital. Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S. I've heard that trick with having sex does help speed up the labor if it's close enough.|`|eV5E9MhUaa	haha... you have to walk a LOT. Try going up and down stairs.

For instance, if you're a student, you can get a discount for having good grades.  If you're young, you can take a driver education program (not the one that you took to get your license, a different free one offered through insurance companies). If your car is old, skip the comprehensive or accept a high deductible...etc.  Don't just go on the web and get quotes. See a real person in your town.

Bw1h5xAcaa	Ask your mom. If she asked if you're interested in attending the birth I doubt she will be upset, but ask before watching the video.<br>  <br>  And I'll tell you, it's not very common for there to be male labor & delivery nurses. They are out there, but they are few in number. Not a lot of women are comfortable having a male labor nurse (even though many OB/GYNs are still doctors). But if this is what you want to be, good luck to you!|`|706fa9fa645a352ed4dc9e7315894893aa	I think thats great that you want to do that. Alot of guys would be grossed out by it.<br>  <br>  Well i would ask your mom first to watch the video just to make sure. but im it would be ok if your going to be in the room with her when she' giving birth! but if it was me...i would ask first!<br>  <br>  And about being the birthing room....all that stuff you would really have to ask your mom.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11927655	The miracle of life is a beautufil thing! If you want to witness this then there is nothing wrong with this! Your mother is great to allow you to be a witness. my husband was about 14 when he saw his brother being born, he also video taped it!!!! now he has beautuful vedio and pictures of the birth.I really wish I could have done that! I say if this is what you want do it! goodl uck!|`|j9axB0YMaa	Well if your mom is willing to let you see your sibling being born I'm sure she won't care if you watch your video. I'd just tell her hey I'm going to watch this so I know what to expect in the delivery room. They might let you hold her leg while she pushes it will probably just depend on the Dr.|`|HOdblqIkaa	i dont think she would have a problem with you watching your birth video if its something you think you would like to pursue in the future as a career. i actually doubt she would mind at all seeing as most kids wouldnt want to watch their mom giving birth to them. if you are going to be in there to watch her next birth then she shouldnt feel awkward letting you watch your own birth but you should get permission first. as for holding her leg thats something that might not be too helpful as the dr and nurses need to be in there to work and if something goes wrong you wouldnt want to be in the way, but then again if you ask they just might let  you.|`|wnxOXBuKaa	I would ask your mom if she would mind you watching it..just incase whoever filmed it for her had it on zoom straight up in the action...she may not want you to see something of her THAT detailed, yanno? <br>  Then again, if the person who filmed it did so tastefully, she probably won't mind and actually may want to watch it with you. <br>  <br>  Just give her a heads up so if, for any reason, she doesn't want you to see it she can let you know.|`|7aVPODR8aa	I'm a labor and delivery nurse :)<br>  Ask your mom whether she wants you to be in the room. We usually allow up to three people in the delivery room. I'm not sure if you can hold her leg, they will be in stirrups, but if it's okay with mom you can certainly hold her hand.|`|L8eNBQelaa	maybe she want you in the room up by her head. i don't think i would be too comfy with my son seeing me give birth. you will get experience soon enough with delivering. are you sure you want to see your mom vajaja. i hope this doesn't upset you i just want to give you a different point of view.|`|ig0klGBXaa	I think I would ask mom about watching the video first to be sure you can hang with her in the delivery room.|`|Lo3GXOxZaa	nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... dont watch it itll be weird look at your moms hugh grossssssssssssss|`|FOUCV6Cmaa	Ask her to watch the video.  Just tell her how you feel, I bet she will understand.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	I think you should just make sure it's ok with your mom first before you watch it. Sounds like your mother's a pretty open person. That's kinda cool. It's also pretty neat that you think you'd like to pursue a career in obstetrics or L&D. I think it'd be a good idea to watch the video before you brave the delivery room. Also, keep in mind that it's MUCH different watching it on youtube and watching in real life. Especially with someone you know and love like your mom. Be strong, little nurse...
cTk9nbvRaa	I think this is so great!  You are being so mature and I just love that you are so interested in child birth!!<br>  <br>  I would ask your mom first, and if she says yes, then go ahead and watch your birth video.  I say to do this because if you can watch it and know that it is you coming out of your mother's vagina, then you will be fine while watching your sibling being born!<br>  <br>  As for holding your mom's leg, or standing by her vaginal area to watch the birth or your sibling, talk to your mom.  Find out what she feels comfortable with.  If she says she just wants you to hold her hand and stay by her head, then that's what you should do.  I think that if you tell her honestly what your future plans are and how important this is to you, she will understand.<br>  <br>  Good luck and stay smart and goal oriented!  You are an amazing person and have so much to offer to this world!<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie!|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	If you want to watch your birth video just watch the birth video. I am sure the reason it was taped was for you, your mom, and your dad to watch someday.|`|fGJsfcW8aa	I think you should definitely ask your mom before you watch it. It's sort of private and I think your mom would appreciate you asking first.|`|SezciXnFaa	Go for it..and good luck. Just joking XD|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I would ask your mom first.  I doubt she'll say no if she said you could be a witness to the new baby.  But out of respect you should ask first.<br>  <br>  Although I don't know if at 15 they will let you in the delivery room with your mom.   You may want to check with the hospital.  <br>  <br>  If you really want to be a nurse, keep your grades up!  Its expensive to go through school!  Good luck!
yOLeRiTZaa	.<br>  <br>  ~_~.<br>  <br>  Rashada, Sweety---YOU HAVE MY SYMPATHY!! You REALLY do, but at the moment, I'm also shaking my finger at you !!! :\<br>  <br>  I'm going to e-mail you, but I 1st want to say..YOU HAVE GOT...To let go of some of that stress!! Another thing<br>  STOP Cutting yourself !!! By doing that your body is in overdrive trying to heel. It's NOT going to allow an egg to implant cu'z you have your immune system on HIGH ALERT!  The female body see's an embryo as a foreign object at 1st & tries to get rid of it. And your giving it a head start. SO STOP!!<br>  <br>  Another thing, the brain works in mysterious ways as well, and if your brain has a feeling, that you feel he's not good enough for you, let alone be a father, you are going to essentially, mentally NOT get pregnant. It's like a reverse hypothetical pregnancy. Understand?<br>  <br>  You'll hear from me shortly.<br>  <br>  _____  ~_~.<br>  <br>  .|`|96HWpdkFaa	Obviously sweety, right now a baby is not the best thing for you.<br>  A baby doesn't need this type of living situation. You need to learn to love yourself first.<br>  <br>  I wish good things for you in life.<br>  <br>   stay strong and quit trying for a baby for awhile until things get better...I know you want a baby..but that's selfish right now seeing how things are going you need to work on your life and your relationship with the boyfriend before you bring a baby in this world.|`|NWv9hOFYaa	Well! You need to fix your other problems before having a child. This is sooo sick! O my God! What the heck is wrong with you!!!?|`|8n3NvYQwaa	get to the doctor both of you to see whats wrong....  your eggs his sperm...  He is not much of a boy friend if he hangs with other girls and wont talk about your situation...  You need love, touching..  compassion and he is not giving it to you...  shame...  41 and you `18  he should take good care of you..  He is a lucky man..  I do wish you well....   God bless   Grant M|`|S5n5Za78aa	wells its definitley not funny.. because most of us are in the same boat, but do you really love this guy?? cause it doesnt sound like you guys are serious sweetie! dont bring a baby into the world with someone you dont love! its nice the thought of just having your baby but you have to think about the babies life and the outcome too. theres so many people that grow up with out fathers and its not ok! but i know how you feel sometimes i feel so low i feel like harming myself to but you just have to think that this may be god telling you NO right now wait till you find someone you love and marry them and he may bless you with a baby do you have any medical conditions ?? well i hope you make the right choice and i wish you the best were still young and we have plenty of time its just that were impatient thats all <br>  good luck|`|ij9N9r5waa	I don't mean to sound rude, but you need to get rid of that boyfriend, find someone who cares about you and will care about his family if and when you have one.  Now is not the time, Do you really want to bring a child into a volatile relationship like the one you have now.  Remember the Baby is a human with feelings and needs.  Are you going to be able to meet those needs in your present condition?|`|4V4m2uZ5aa	Wow you have really got me tore up. Where are your parents? Do you have any family you can turn to, a friend? You can get help for this. Go somewhere like planned parenthood or something. They can point you in the right direction.<br>  Please reconsider having a baby right now. It's really the last thing you need. <br>  Another thing get rid of this guy. He may not care about you but you need to care enough about yourself to know you deserve better. You may have made the mistake of picking him but you can fix that. Leave please.  I have to question the intentions of any 41 yr old man with an 18 yr old girl.<br>  You are the only one who can change this and you can do it. Good luck

AMFXWj6Caa	I dont know much about abortions, but I do know that you can go to a clinic or a doctors office, and they can recommend someone for you to go to. You need to have the abortion done professionally, bc if not there is a chance that your girlfriend can die. Also trying to have a miscarriage is not good, because it can be harmful to your girlfriend. I know that you dont want to have and keep the baby, but maybe  you  could have it, and then let someone adopt the baby. Its better than an abortion, but this is up to you.|`|nuTvB84Gaa	Don't have a abortion.<br>  All ways are painful for the infant.<br>  And can cause depression for the mother for the rest of her life.<br>  It can also cause her to never be able to have a child again.<br>  <br>  Put it up for adoption.<br>  Tell your parents.<br>  Tell them you want to put it up for adoption.<br>  <br>  Don't try to have a miscarriage.<br>  If the babies big enough the mother may have to birth the baby and go into labor if she does have a miscarriage.<br>  <br>  please don't kill the kid.<br>  It's you guys fault don't take it out on your child.<br>  Let it live and have a good home that will care for it.<br>  It can also be painful for the mother to get a abortion.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped.|`|UfOP3xtcaa	First let me tell you that by the second month the baby is alive the heart has started to beat and by aborting now you would basically killing your first child. Second let me state that if you did not want to have a baby then you do not need to be having sex. Third there are a lot of good people out there who want kids that can't have them so if you must out the baby up for adoption. And for my last thing if the only reason you don't want a baby is because of finical reasons then you do know that you can get all kinds of government assistance when having a little one. You can get a house paid for, food stamps, a free ride to college for ANY degree. I am a single mother so please do not abort your only child. Pray about this before you make any rash decisions. Please reconsider....|`|0cM2pYk2aa	Yes, you CAN have the baby. Who said you had to keep it? Give it up for adoption. That's the best thing. Abortion is NOT the way to solve this.<br>  ---<br>  Did you already post this question in the past?|`|hvNPSOd1aa	Learn to spell please, then we might help you.  By the grammar and words you use, I highly suggest you not being the father of the baby.|`|ZDqdYhdGaa	IT IS TOO LATE TO HAVE AN ABORTION! I am pro-choice so no I am not an advocate lecturing you, but this is a baby now not a fetus. It is way too late for you to have an abortion and you can't make her have a miscarriage at this point! Like I said it is now a baby! If you try to take it into your own hands you will be committing a crime! You can actually go to jail if you try to go to extremes and you will put her life in danger. Even if she does end up having a miscarriage at this stage, she will still have to go to the actual hospital because the baby is too large for her to fully pass on her own (to be blunt they will have to finish removing the baby) and they will end up contacting her parents because it is a surgery so they will find out period! <br>  <br>  You need to suck it up and tell your parents, you may think that it is the end of the world but the worst that can happen is they are going to be mad and yell at you, I promise!!<br>  <br>  Your only option is to have this baby and either keep it or put it up for adoption, there are soooo many people out there who would be happy to provide a loving home for him/her!|`|gdvCvWrLaa	What the he'll is your problem.  Abortion shouldn't even be an option. Are you seriously gonna kill your baby for your missltakes.  Yeah your rich you did make a mistake. And you knew pregnancy was a possibility so maybe you should own up to it. At three months your baby's heart is already beating.  And it's body has alreay formed a bit.  You should go to the doctor and get a picture.  And by the way whenyou get an abortion it is just a vacume that rips the baby apart limb by limb.  Guess it is a good thing you parents didn't do it to you because now you get the chance to do it to an innocent child.<br>  <br>  If you can't take care of your baby try adoption. It is always an option.|`|8WqTvPBbaa	You want to kill your baby because it's not working out for you? That would be like saying your parents left you at a gas station on vacation because you were annoying them, and maybe you should take an English 101 class so you can teach your baby proper English.  Abortion isn't an option, you can have the baby it was your mistake, every action has a re-action now you have to deal with the re-action, you should go through with this have the baby and then put it up for adoption so a loving family that is ready to raise a baby can have a happy baby.|`|7MKmxkjlaa	um. i dont know much about abortion ... but i do know that its illegal to have an abortion after 3 months. And the only way you can get one after that is if the child is severly brain damaged. And thats only before 5 months.<br>  <br>  And dont try to cause miscarriage ... cuase it will be putting your girlfriends health at risk ... and it may not nessesarily work ... then you will have a mentally retarded kid ... and that will cost you LOTS of money.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	I'm sorry you're in this situation.<br>  I'm from Ontario too...and have also been through the same thing.<br>  <br>  DO NOT try and cause miscarriage!<br>  Your girlfriend would be putting her own health in jeopardy.<br>  If abortion is what you both have decided on, then she should go to a womans clinic, or her family doctor to find out more information.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,|`|txG1hqV4aa	Your mistake; Deal with it.<br>  <br>  What if your parents said "We Can't have this baby.  That's no option".<br>  then you wouldnt have a life now would you?<br>  <br>  Abortion-NOT an option.|`|5p0AW33jaa	i suggest you talk to your guardians about this... they should know and they could be the ones to be helping you out. abortion is a serious thing and the girls health will also be put at risk.|`|q20gVmLyaa	Oh my gosh. We're talking about a baby here, who cares about best answer. I'm not going to help you with the abortion, however, I'm going to try to convince you not to have it. You're extremely irresponsible. You had sex, you got a girl pregnant, you'll get an abortion, you'll never do it again, oh well. Grow up! It's a baby's life. Imagine how painful abortion is, the baby can feel! Please consider giving the baby for adoption! Why can't you have it?|`|R21aV2mLaa	ok you need to have this baby!! it is not fair to abort this baby!! you and your girlfriend does not need to have sex, if your adult enough to have sex then you are adult enough to have this baby!! you can always give it up for adoption!! please be smart it will come back on you later in life you will regret murdering this baby!!|`|uTN69Vodaa	adoption! Why kill an innocent human? Really... watch this. It will change your mind. There's no icky, gross pictures.

lRq81lu7aa	I had gestational diabetes with my first child.<br>  <br>  From now on, try to limit fruit juices, candy, pop, fruits, chocolate.  Any thing that is really sugary.  <br>  <br>  What you can do is have smaller portions of sugary foods.  Increase your fiber and protein so you feel full.<br>  <br>  So, example have whole wheat toast, eggs or cereal with milk for breakfast.  Then about 2 hours later have a snack, like peanut butter and crackers.  Then at lunch have a piece of fruit, a sandwich with meat and cheese and  lettuce.  Then 2 hours later have another small snack, like some cheese or crackers.  Then for dinner have meat, vegetables, and milk.  This helps your blood sugar stay stable and you won't become diabetic as quickly.  <br>  <br>  It is all about portion and timing.  It may seem like you aren't eating as much, but you are spacing it out over shorter periods and you aren't depriving yourself or your baby.  <br>  <br>  Ask your doctor if there is a nutritionist that can help you with a meal plan to make sure your blood sugar stays normal.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!  Good Luck!

It's entirely your choice, you're both adults, and if they don't like it, I'm sure they'll get over it. They shouldn't control your life. Break the news when you're ready, how you want, and they have to accept it. If they're unhappy, I don't think there's any way you can make it easier for them, though it's considerate of you to want to try.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I don't see how asking if your having another is rude, but each to their own.<br>  Just tell you MIL its none of her business.

We were struggling and her parents were helping.  They had inferred if we had another child they weren't as likely to help.

The only thing I've heard that is consistent is the older you are when you conceive, the higher you chances of having twins. If you are African American, your chances are also higher. BUT, twins are a lot of times just a "lucky shot." That is what most websites will tell you. I'm sorry if you're hoping for twins. I don't want to dash your hopes. I also have heard that if twins are genetic, then the "twin gene" usually skips a generation. Which would make your chances higher, since you're the 3rd generation. But, I've also read that it's the man's sperm that determines whether it'll be twins or not. So, if your hubby has twin on HIS side, your chances will be higher.

fGMmSOxAaa	The antics you describe are silly, but not very unusual for an 8 year old girl.  They like to be silly the way some little boys like to be active and climb trees.  She is less likely to do this without an audience, however.  <br>  I don't do homework with my kids.  That way I don't get mad.  My 8 year old used to whine so much about it last year I would put her in her room or at her desk and say "Come see me when it's done.'  I found the homework took longer and involved a lot more difficulties and whining if I hovered nearby to "check up" or "support" them.  I now pay no attention whatsoever to my children during homework time except for reading practice.  (They are in grades 3, 2 and SK so only the oldest 2 get homework although all 3 have nightly reading from readers.)  I try to get my own work done so when the homework is done we might have time to play a boardgame, talk or I can read to them.  <br>  <br>  One thing I do that is a bit different is we eat supper usually within half an hour of them arriving home.  I find they are STARVING because they get no afternoon recess so they haven't eaten since noon when they get home at 3pm.  I got tired of filling them up with 2 or 3 snacks then trying to force feed them a meat and vegetable dinner. So now I give them what I really want them to eat when they're starving and they can snack later if they like.  Odd, but it works for me and they aren't hungry during homework time.  <br>  <br>  I have taught her grade and if you think an adult sits beside her all day at school to make sure she does it I can assure you, she does it mainly by herself.  <br>  Time after time I would have students who would do 2/3 of a math paper or other assignment completely independently in school whose parents would complain about the terrible time they had getting them to do it at home.  They completely forget everything they learned all day during the walk home?  Not really.  <br>  <br>  You need to put her in her room and tell her to come out when it's done.  It is HER homework, NOT yours.  Remembering this is absolutely crucial to homework peace.  Obviously if she is getting good marks in school (I assume they give tests or in class assignments to evaluate her) she can do the work.  If she can't do the work independently (or at least 90% independently) send it in undone with a note to the teacher saying that your daughter told you she did not understand it.  (I often found they "remembered" how to do it miraculously if I made it clear that gym class, recess etc. was indefinitely postponed until the work was done. If they really didn't understand though, a look at their incomplete work often made their trouble easy to spot. )   If she really doesn't understand it I, as the teacher, want to know what the problem is.  If the parent does most of the work for the child at home that just masks the problem.  Definitely send a note (or she'll likely be punished) but don't do it for her or even very much with her.|`|6bK5Vfpdaa	First of all, you shouldn't ever want to Smack your child!!!!! If you do, that''s just not right. She's just frustrated with her work, after all, she's a kid! Spend some time with her before homework! Just leave the room when you get angry..kids will be kids, and she is a kid. Sounds just like me when I was 8. i mean, how much homework can an 8 year old have???|`|XRMNQPUIaa	Watch the super-nanny.

Anyway, don't let her know that she's getting to you.  If she gets no response to her behavior she will stop...it may take a while for her to get the idea.  Spanking doesn't work so well with my kids and its not always the answer.  For now though go to your bedroom...turn up the radio so she cant hear you scream or kick your pillow around the room.  My daughters have given me some bad times so this is from experience.|`|pN0N0xjkaa	keep giving her time outs.. punish her as if she was still a little kid ( younger) it seems like she WANTS to be treated that way..|`|0lU0ndAxaa	spanking will get you absolutely no where, my son was the same way, i had him tested for everything under the sun, and the end was that he needed a teacher to teach him , not just throw out assignments and expect the kids to just get it or not.  this is what schools call kids falling through the cracks,  the ones who don't get it without instruction are always the trouble makers and come from disfunctional homes.  yea right, i changed his school and he was a much happier student, they actually took the time to teach instead of babysit.|`|1Vxayygdaa	I teach second-graders, and I have a third grade sister who does very similar things---like telling my mom she doesn't know the answer to 1+1 or something like that.  It can certainly be infuriating.  Please don't be disheartened by some of the commenters' replies.<br>  <br>  One thing that really helps me as a teacher (and trust me, I have had some DIFFICULT students) is to picture two lines.  The first is above the second and represents me.  I want it to be straight, unaffected by the line below.  I imagine it straight.  The second line is lower and represents the child.  It looks more like a roller coaster, but always stays below the first.  ( I wish I could draw this for you.)<br>  <br>  Now, here's the important thing.  Children are learning to deal with so many things and often don't know how to express their wants and needs.  (I know it's hard to remember this when your daughter does something "ridiculous".)  That is why they look like a roller coaster.  <br>  But, you are the adult.  You can keep the control over yourself and your line, or you can give it to your child, who will take it.  You have the power to keep your line straight and unaffected by your child's line.  What I mean in real life is that your line (your emotions, words, behavior) does not have to follow the example of your daughter's.  <br>  <br>  So, in real terms, what does this mean?  Many other people have said it--leave the room, keep your voice calm, praise her good behavior--even if you have to stretch the truth a little (sometimes I've stretched it a lot), set clear rules so your daughter knows what to expect and THEN follow through!  She won't take it easily, but if you stay firm, she'll get the picture sooner or later.  If you don't, she'll know she is really the one in charge.  <br>  <br>  One more thought--you might ask the teacher to help.  Sometimes we teachers have little tricks that help students who don't respond as easily to parents.  <br>  <br>  Wow!  This was long.  Good Luck!|`|3884ed81dd37e4db9226c11478973595aa	she is just hyper and cant sit still. what 8 year old WANTS to do homework.<br>  I am in your same shoes. <br>  My 7 year old goofs off while we do her homework and it drives me nuts.<br>  "i dont want to do my homework"<br>  Well, youknow what???? ME NEITHER! but becasue i am her parent...I HAVE TO! <br>  anyways...now that i have that out of my system...i have found it is easier to do it the second she gets home from school while she is still in "school mode" before getting into "play" mode.<br>  Get it done early and knocked out and dont worry about it.<br>  OH...and you have to have patience.|`|9jJnDQ6uaa	i think the best plan would be a structured homework time. make the rules and consequences clear. you can even write them down (which should help you know what to do in each situation).<br>  <br>  first, set a time. it would be best to make it before dinner (otherwise you'll get  "i'm tired/ i have to go to the bathroom").  let her have a snack (grapes, toast, etc.) during homework time, but for your sanity's sake, make it something soft. imagine all the sounds she could make with say, a bag of chips.<br>  <br>  next, set a time requirement. she must work for at least so long every day. make it reasonable according to the amount of work she has had in the past. if she finishes early, she has to finish out her time either reading or starting the next lesson early (which is especially good if she's having trouble in any specific area). if she's not finished on time, she has to go into overtime. she's not done until all homework is finished.<br>  <br>  that's a basic homework plan. as far as rules go, set whatever you want. my suggestions would be:<br>  <br>  1. she must go to the bathroom before work time. if she has to go during it, she must forfeit something (maybe ice cream after dinner or 30 minutes of tv), and there is a time limit (5 minutes tops) on her bathroom break, after which she gets another consequence. or you can stop your timer as long as she's gone and she can make it up when she's through.<br>  <br>  2. keep a behavior list each day. every time she misbehaves, mark it down. if she gets up to a certain number of marks (3-5) she loses tv for the night or something else she would want. if her bhavior is completely outlandish, she could lose it for the week. however, if she can finish the week with less than five or so marks, then she gets something that week-end (take her out for ice cream or to see a movie. you know what she likkes, so pick a treat that she wouldn't otherwise get).<br>  <br>  the idea is that, since the consequences are known ahead of time, she will have to choose to regulate her own behavior. she knows that if her antics make her run out of hw time, she has to make it up and might miss her favorite tv show. or her 20 minute bathroom break might cost her a dessert that everyone else gets. plus, she loses the satisfaction of getting you angry. you already know what you need to do for each situation, so you can do it calmly and consistently.<br>  **************************************...<br>  as it relates to everything else, set a time limit for each job to be done.  keep an outfit she hates in your closet. if she's not dressed on time, she has to wear that instead. if she's not cleaning her room, sit in her room and watch her do it. if that's not enough, set a timer on your phone (so she can't set it back). if she's not done when it goes off, she gets another consequence. she can act up as much as she wants to, as long as the job's done in time. most schools have a specific plan of consequences that go along with misbehavior, so i'm going to guess that that contributes to her behavior there.<br>  <br>  if you can make a list of her consequences and the order they come in, that will probably help you a lot. (tv time, computer time, phone time if she has it).<br>  <br>  i hope this helps....<br>  <br>  p.s. if her homework is on loose paper, you can tape the corner down so she can't drop it.|`|guu2EtT8aa	a few things u could do without hitting her, first off go outside and just take a deep breath to calm u down, then if u get mad shel see that its making u mad, which is kinda of a kids goal to bug the parents, just don't pay attention to it and she will stop.

Explain how its improtant to do your homework  and develope good habits so when you grow up you do all your work wel and become smart and go somewhere.

427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	I think it's fine -- no different than adults eating mashed potatoes, right?  :-)<br>  <br>  As for salad and raw veggies, they're so hard to chew that most kids don't really take to them until at least age 2 or 3 (in my experience).  It took my girls until about 6 months ago to really eat more than one bite of lettuce b/c they didn't like the texture (and they're 4 and 5).  <br>  <br>  My 4-year-old likes bell pepper, but only orange (I think, or was it red...).  All my kids like raw carrots.  My 4-year-old and 18-month-old both like cucumbers quite a bit (the 18-mo loves them!).  My 5-year-old used to prefer cooked carrots, but she told me the other day that she now likes raw ones better.  None of my kids are big fans of tomatoes, but I'm not either.<br>  <br>  It's easiest to get kids started with carrots and celery (and other raw veggies) if you offer them with "dip", like Ranch dressing or peanut butter or whatever they like.  Kids love to dip, so as long as you can get them to eat the veggie, too, and not just suck off the dip, they'll get used to the veggie.<br>  <br>  Just keep offering a variety of veggies that you're eating along with her preferred veggie mash, and I think she'll come around in time.  As toddlers, my kids have always preferred canned veggies (we get the "no salt" kind) b/c they're softer and easier to eat.  Just another idea for you to try...|`|LbkLg4RFaa	No we still eat mashed potatoes or sweet potatoes sometimes.  Even I do.  We do still offer lots of vegetables but he is sometimes goes through stages where he will only eat a certain vegetable.<br>  <br>  Will has eaten some capsicum but usually only when it's in a stir-fry.  Lettuce he won't eat and tomato maybe one diced piece.  Cucumber occasionally.  We usually grate carrot, add some sweetcorn and pineapple to salads so he eats those.  <br>  <br>  Now that he is 15 months he does seem to eat less at lunch and dinner than he did a month or so ago.  Pretty normal I think seeing as their growth slows down after 1 year.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	I personally think if your daughter likes her veggies mashed then give them to her mashed.  At least she is eating them.<br>  <br>  My son will eat like a pig one day then barely eat anything the next.  Kids at this age are very unpredictable.  I just don't force anything.  I figure if he is hungry he will eat.  <br>  <br>  He is almost 17 months old btw.  He has only tried salad once and he ate a little..but it had dressing on it so that could be the reason.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	there is nothing weird about giving your child veggies.. no matter what shape they come in - mashed, cooked, fried - as long as they end up in her tummy :).. my child hates some of the veggies (especially salad-type ones), so i have to mash them (actually, i cook them and puree them with a handheld blender) and she happily eats them :).. i do not think babies are into the salads at all - mine is using it (if given) as a mosaic tiles to decorate the table top :).. well, you do what you have to, so keep those veggies coming :)|`|dLLDwZaraa	Veggies are veggies, whole, mashed, raw, cooked, whatever.  However she willingly takes them is the route I'd go.  <br>  <br>  My daughter IS a fan of salad and I always have fresh veggies sliced in the fridge.  She chows cucumbers and red peppers with a little dill dip.<br>  <br>  And since hitting 15 months, her appetite has slowed down.  Some days she just nibbles and others she gobbles...

fMilDRgLaa	Hi, when you say full time...are you talking that the baby will not be on the breast at all?  If you still are giving your child the breast one of the best ways is after nursing pump for about 10 minutes afterwards.  This singles your brain that you need to maintain and even perhaps increase your milk supply. However, if you are doing the pump alone them be sure you have a GREAT pump like the medela pump n style advanced.  Hospital grade pumps are the best, but can be expensive after months of rental.  One other thing is to be sure your breast shields are the correct size...there is no pinching of nipples when pumping or the breastpump brings too much breast tissue in the shield. Basically if the pumping hurts check the breast shields.  Any hospital shop that seels pumps or a lactation consultant would be able to help if you have questions.|`|1YHih8wyaa	what about fenugreek. i know you can buy the caplets at gnc and health food stores.|`|3abc27d467d6cd664b8b7d1716054291aa	Make sure to not go over three hours without pumping and four hours overnight. Try using Breastea at www.breastea.com. I've been using it for awhile now and it has really improved my milk supply. Other then that just take care of yourself and give yourself time. Hope this helps.|`|ho0XRinGaa	Good luck!! It is hard work. Try thinking of your baby or having them close to you while you're pumping. Apparently that's meant to really help.

My middle name is Leigh and I always wished it was spelled 'Lee'<br>  <br>  Tristyn Skye- sounds trashy, hate the spelling. I feel like it's sort of a porn star name<br>  <br>  Khloe Victoria- reminds me of Khloe Cardashian. I would stick to Chloe if you really like the name. Victoria is boring.<br>  <br>  Aralyn Layla- what a mouthful! wayyy too many A's.

1a4a0605fa5bff2fbd65a4bcec08a3b5aa	Even in the technologically advanced days of now it's difficult to determine exact size and weight on an ultrasound. <br>  <br>  Labor with my daughter was induced when I was only 38 weeks along because the doc told me she was measuring at about nine and a half pounds and he expected her to gain at least one more pound before I made it to 40 weeks. <br>  <br>  She was seven pounds even at birth. =P<br>  <br>  Congrats, btw. Glad you're excited.|`|ETvV9aypaa	no doesnt mean that your baby will be bit... i had that later on in my pregnacy they said he was going to be whopping 8-9 pounds but he was only 6pound 4. go figure.... congrads and good luck
Ej2EOsvKaa	I totally know what you mean! People who do not know what the heck they are talking about, the the most junk! Everybody bashes it (at one point I did too) and not until your either in that situation or know of someone who is in that situation then they will never understand! <br>  Alot of people are not open minded, they go by what they are told (ex. Abortions are BAD) therefore, they go on thinking there whole life that it is wrong or sinful. It has a lot to do with religion also.<br>  My family was raised catholic and in that religion abortion is not an option......well that seemed to change when my 15 year old sister was claiming she was preggo! Right away my parents knew what they had to do. THey did not even think of religion, luckily she wasnt preggo. <br>  <br>  anyways, people are so shallow that they will say anything to anyone! Especially about abortion because all they know is abortion kills. Ok well they dont take the other instances for example young age, abusive relationship, health, money! Nobody takes that into conideration. Very good and interesting question! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  ps. whinie....touching story I see you are still going strong good for you! Dont let anyone tell you otherwise.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, for the person who answered that the dad raped the little girl! That is a total case for abortion poor child would come out really confused and messed up! Everyone is responses were really interesting|`|AA11065140	For the same reason they bash other people about whatever topic randomly pops up.  I've heard it called "keyboard courage"...basically, the anonymity of the internet "allows" them to be as rude as they want to be.  It's easy to mouth off, when you don't actually have to look someone in the face to do it.|`|ixR3qfYdaa	I completely agree with you!! anyways what business is it of anybody else's? Are the women who are raped supposed to keep the child inside of them that will remind them everyday of the horrible experience. I know ppl are going to say that it's still a child and deserves to live, but what about the people raped by family members? My best friend was raped by her dad and got pregnant, should she have kept that baby? I think not!|`|4p9sBdyTaa	Your question calls for me to know the operation of someone else's mind. I can only tell you how I feel about it and while I do not feel abortion should be used as birth control I am pro choice and do not feel it is my place to dictate who is and who isn't allowed to abort.|`|eb9Mptu3aa	I have a feeling this question will be deleted...<br>  <br>  That said, anyone in a life or death situation should have the right to save their own lives. If they don't, then TWO people die. So, I don't know why anyone would bash this person.|`|G0QugnQ8aa	Yeah, I know what you're talking about...this is supposed to be a Q & A site where you can post a question and get an answer based on facts instead of what someones opinions or ideals are.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I agree with you. They don't even sound like educated mature parents. They sound like school bullies in elementary. MURDER they yell.<br>  <br>  It's pitiful.|`|dShnJ20raa	They are making people feel worse about themselves than necessary. I mean seriously these women, at least some of them, really did want that baby and now they are hurting because they didn't have much of a choice in the matter, and now people are giving them a guilt trip!!! <br>  <br>  I am on a lot of medications due to a mistake the hospital made and prior to it we were trying to concieve, we stopped as soon as I went on all these meds but if I had been pregnant without realizing it and had been taking all the meds I wouldn't hesitate for a heartbeat to terminate. I know a lot of people think it is wrong, but a lot of them also aren't educated on the subject.<br>  <br>  Think before you type please all you people booing those who have had abortions or require them, you may be doing a lot of damage to a woman who is already in a lot of pain. You think yourselves so high and mighty just because you think you would never do that but you can't say that until you have been in such a situation that would require you to make that monumental decision. Do that and THEN you can judge til then keep your mouths shut and back off!|`|AGcwdZGmaa	well i don't believe in abortions but it is a personal Choice i had to chose between me and my baby and choose my baby and everything ended up okay anyway they are some things that you cant avoid a abortion for eg eptopic pregnancy<br>  yeah it would be different if the people who bash women for have an abortion for medical reasons had to have one does that mean they should be bashed too they are just !diots|`|cj7sSPZEaa	OMG I wish I had seen that question because that is a horrible reason for people to be judgmental.  Some people are so very rude and unkind.  I had to have labor induced at 22 weeks due to a severe uterine infection and the doctor said that if I didn't do it I would die.   It wasn't an option to save me or my baby- we were both in danger and the baby wasn't going to make it no matter what.  There was nothing they could do for my little girl and if anyone has anything to say- if anyone thinks I was wrong to let them do that then they need to be shot.   No one has any right to judge another person unless they are in their shoes.|`|wxbGmxbOaa	I also agree with you. While some abortions are inexcusable, not all of them should be judged. I believe if it is a life or death situation, the woman should not be judged for her choice. The only time I get extremely upset with abortion is if it's an act committed by someone who had unprotected sex and just doesn't want their unborn child, that to me is not an excuse and should never be the reason for abortion.|`|7gLX624Gaa	I agree with you. I'm not for abortions but sometimes it really is the better option. In life or death everybody who makes rude comments would probably make the same choice.|`|apUkTo3maa	CHILL OUT PREGNANCY HORMONES RAGE|`|lzUF22l0aa	i deffinatly think that each women knows whats best for their life noone else knows what goes on behind closed doors and if you dont have nothing nice to say on here than dont answer the question. Everyone one persons situation is completely different from everyone else's so they should not make that person feel any worse than im sure they already do. I am also pregnant with my second child.... best of luck to you and your children!

I have lost my plug, and they don't listen.<br>  I also have a 13 month old to chase around. I've told them this and they just say that unfortunately its a part of being pregnant. And they're right.<br>  All women experience a great deal of pain and discomfort in the final weeks of their pregnancy, but you just need to wait.<br>  If the doctors are right by their dates, your baby is not ready for at least another 2 weeks anyways. There isn't much anyone can do I'm afraid. There are only a few weeks left.<br>  If you are in excruciating pain that you can't possibly handle anymore, or your water breaks, then go to the hospital.|`|yea2hci5aa	Go back to the hospital!

6GiYZTx5aa	i am also due may 5th and my back hurts all the time, just kinda dull and achy. It is from the extra weight and being pulled from your center of gravity by your belly. I am not big at all so it just depends on how your baby is positioned. My doctor told me to get a couple tennis balls and have your husband roll them over your back, i tried it and it was the best massage ever. you may experience back pain that does not completely go away until after you deliver! <br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!!|`|H20Qz1Tvaa	Pregnancy will give you all sorts of back pains. I had terrible lower back pains from 12weeks on, and as soon as I delivered, they disappeared.|`|9b58cae7f52f394f5b0dee9240e28275aa	Kidney infections are common during pregnancy and cause back pain. Do you have a fever? I would call your doc just to be sure!!|`|khSCs1rbaa	Yes, I did experience the same at lower left back, near pelvis when I was around 25 wks. It hurt when I stand or walk but bearable. It seems to go away for a few days & come back again. I noticed a "clark" sound when I turn during my sleep & checked with the doctor at my 28w appointment & she said that is normal as our body is stretching.|`|wxbGmxbOaa	I am 27 weeks and 5 days and I've been having a pain in my right should blade. I asked my midwife about it and she said it's probably just from the extra weight I'm carrying around and that it's nothing to worry about. My bf also has been giving me back massages, they are great while he's doing it, but soon as he's done, my back is right back to hurting. So we're kind of in the same boat. My pain has kinda died down some the last couple of days, so hopefully yours will die down soon. Good Luck and congrats on the little one.

OydLOXgJaa	Well first of all, congrats! Even if it wasn't planned, babies are a blessing for sure.   :)    <br>  So far everyone's key point has been "beware of crabbiness" and that is SO true. You have no idea how out of control our hormones get, so just be prepared and don't take it personally! No matter how much you hear about it, I don't think anyone is ready for that. lol. (Seriously, PMSx10. Haha) <br>  Also keep in mind that she is going to be feeling uncomfortable a lot, so any massages and being sweet to her is a definite must! (plus it helps the crabiness)<br>  Typically it is very appreciated if you go to the prenatals as well, so that you can ask any questions you are curious about, and so that you are there to support her.<br>  Other than that, I would suggest reading up about pregnancy online so you can see what she is going through and what to expect from her next, as well as starting to buy diapers & wipes etc very early, especially since you are young and money will probably be a little tight. Just save the receipts in case the sizes aren't right you should be able to exchange later on. Oo! One more thing that I've been doing (since money is a little tight in my situation as well) is when I go shopping at walmart or target or wherever, I will buy a pack of diapers, as well as a $15 gift card here and there so that we won't be tempted to spend the money, but it will be there when we figure out something else we need, or even for after the baby is born. I have some baby stuff, but since we don't know the gender yet I am waiting on a lot. It's always good to save up money gradually, so you don't get stuck having to buy anything you don't get at the babyshower all at once!!   :)<br>  Over all though, just try to support her emotionally and physically, and make her pregnancy as fun and light-hearted as possible instead of focusing on the stresses of it all, cuz believe me, it can get a bit stressful. <br>  Congratulations on your arriving little one, and I wish you both the best of luck! I think it's really cool you guys are keeping it, and that you are so interested in doing the right thing. :)   <br>  Take care!|`|EOyujCyBaa	put up with everything she throws at you for the next 9 months, remember its just the hormones talking! try and go to all her doc appointments with her and scans, the support from you at those is greater than a friends support because you both have a connection with the baby.. always seem interested when shes picking out things for the baby even if your not lol.. and most of all don't ditch her to be out with your mates when she is as big as a house and cant move off the couch lol.. give her lots of love:) and for the labour, be there every step, its the hardest thing she will go through phisically and emotionally and your support in labour will bring her through to the end.. best of luck with everything:)|`|973GEZrZaa	it almost shocked me to hear a dad actually bothering to make some effort.<br>  <br>  congratulations babe.. hope everything goes okay. look after her well..<br>  <br>  xx|`|FNs6T9qGaa	Just try your hardest to be nice to her... she will probably get some moods swings... tell her you llove her everyday.<br>  :]<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. it happend because you two must have slept together. lol|`|qJG6lFILaa	wow! you are an incredible guy! i am very impressed to hear you are going to stay with your girlfriend and help out with the baby...i mean no offense, but we all know that most guys would leave once they found that out, so that's why i think you're so great!<br>  <br>  you just have to be really sensitive with her and not push her because the hormones are going to be going crazy. one second she's going to wanna have hot sweaty sex with her and the next, she's gonna want to to fall off a cliff and die. sound harsh? yes, but it's true. buy her some pickles! i'm not even kidding there...it would help!!|`|AGcwdZGmaa	congrats just so you know she may get really snappy just remember its the hormones|`|DySUxIn4aa	Cater to her.. just do little things for her and she'll appreciate it.|`|jCvdW3WGaa	Wow, congrats! Ok, she's gonna have lots of conflicting emotions especially in the first few months. You're the person who's mostly going to be on the receiving end of all that. You can help her by getting some pregnancy books out from the library and reading them together, go down to the chemist and get her some pre-natal vitamins, go with her to doctor's appointments, and just basically look after her. Life as a teen parent can be challenging, but it can also be a lot of fun. It seems like you're both being pretty mature about this, and i can only applaud that.|`|yNoENquTaa	i'm the same age and 14weeks along. my boyfriend rubs my belly and talks to the baby which makes me feels very loved and happy. she will at times be difficult and it's important that you communicate with her and also do nice things for her. but remember that new dads also need the support too, so if your feeling a little overwhelmed, make sure you talk to someone.<br>  also you can go to appointments with her, especially the ultrasounds. =] they are amazing. how far along is she?<br>  ???|`|XxZQ72J4aa	Be there every step of the way, whether it's being loving to her, or planning logistics with her, or working to support the baby. Raising a baby is very hard, ESPECIALLY when you're young. This can be really intimidating, which is why teen parents will often bolt. Stick together and you'll make it!<br>  <br>  Also, pregnancy involves a lot of hormone production, so watch out for her being moody and be comforting. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|35kVNi5oaa	she's going to be super bitchy for the first few months..
5q7uPqVmaa	I'm so glad that somebody else has a similiar child!  My daughter has always seemed to operate on very little sleep and my dad said it was because I simply didn't put her to bed at 7 like my brother put his daughter to sleep them.  Well, I tried it and honestly, the child laid patiently in bed for TWO HOURS without sleeping, looking at books and playing with a stuffed animal.  I can't fathom asking that of a kid who clearly isn't about to fall asleep.  I guess that some kids just operate on less sleep than others.|`|0lU0ndAxaa	i have no idea, my gran is the same way.  i try to let her play outside as long and as hard as she wants but that just perked up her appetite, good luck.|`|4Y2w3EeXaa	in a bag of white powder|`|uCnmYEPBaa	Children have the same amount of energy that us adults do but theirs are in smaller packages.|`|xBH4O6Cwaa	Sometimes you just can't.

Ignore his crying fits and continue feeding the 16 month old.<br>  <br>  Or buy a special juice box or chocolate milk (something he doesn't usually have) and let him have that when you breastfeed.  Explain to him that the baby needs mommy's milk to grow and he needs apples (for apple juice) or chocolate (for chocolate milk), etc.|`|50zbKv0jaa	your his mother not his friend<br>  you are an authority figure<br>  the answer is "No your a big boy now, this is for your brother"|`|AFi5kTiEaa	At 16 months old he shouldnt be nursing that many times during the day.  You could start not doing it in front of the 3 year old.  when you need to nurse, put on his favorit tv show or get him interested in coloring, painting or a puzzle, go to a different room and nurse.  have daddy, occupy him when he is home.  find something he likes to do and have special time with just him, big boy time.  Say you are so lucky to be able to to...whatever with mommy, your brother is to little to do it.<br>  <br>  He is jealous and needs something just for him and mommy do together, something special, like his brother has.  Not something babyish, something for a big boy.|`|J2gr1ogHaa	you are going to have to be firm, otherwise he'll backtrack in EVERYTHING! Have a talk with him, alone, and tell him all the exciting big boy things he gets to do that his little brother doesn't yet. The 2 of you come up with something just the 2 of you can do everyday for about 30 min that can't include baby brother.|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	Well he is still a little boy.Tell him only "babies" need mommy milk.Maybe have him do things only a "big brother" can do.Help with diapers,giving a bath etc.Make sure he has cups or dishes that he uses but the baby can't.|`|0PVmzXc0aa	tell him he already had milk when he was kittle now it is his brothers turn and that when the bay grows it will be the same as t is 4 him now..|`|AFXE4cmxaa	tell him "No" and that he's a big kid now . all kids want to be seen as a big kid:)|`|bqCk3lEWaa	Maybe give his a special "job" to do while your nursing your youngest, so he doesn't just lay there and watch wistfully.  Maybe he could read a book out loud to you while you nurse, or put on a puppet show, or sing you some songs.<br>  <br>  The others are probably right.  It's not that he wants to breastfeed again, it's likely his expression of wanting to be close to you.  You could even set a timer, so he knows when you'll be finished and then set 5 minutes to just spend some special time with him.|`|m84Ml3Opaa	Well, I realize that you don't want to hurt his feelings, but you're just going to have to let him cry about this one. At first I thought maybe since the other sibling came along he needed some attention. You should find something for him to do that's just for him, helping him to accept being a big boy. Give him some kind of active role, maybe hand you a diaper when you're changing the baby and other things that include him.|`|umGi6gTcaa	It so funny that the people who tell you to stop breastfeeding are the ones who never did it, you don't know jack so SHHHHHHH!<br>  <br>  Do your best to explain to him that the baby (although call him by his name, studies show that the word baby to a slightly older sibling arouses jealousy) needs the milk to grow so he can be big and strong like his brother. It's only fair that baby get it since he did. When he asks to nurse tell him "You can't nurse but if you want you can go pick out a book that we can read together". Try to give him some special time, even if his brother is there.|`|oqcjAMJQaa	You have to give him tough love. Tell him that no is no, and that he is not allowed to breastfeed. You must learn to draw a line. As far as hurting his feelings... he is young and will bounce back soon. If you refuse to back down, he will eventually get the idea and stop asking for it. Do NOT give in to him. good luck|`|rt4OnxkYaa	tell him all the benefits of being a "biig boy" and iif he still needs mommys milk he wontget to experience all the fun 3 year old things!|`|fHJcGAyTaa	Give him a special little juice carton everytime so he still feels like he is getting a treat.|`|ocNUYENRaa	Tell him he's still your little boy, but he's grown so big for his milkies (or whatever you call nursing, it's milkies around here :-}). Pick a snack that he likes that's nutritious (not chips) and let him have it when you're nursing. Alternately chose a special activity or book that's only for these times. Regression this age is normal, is he going through a change right now, like potty training, preschool, etc?<br>  <br>  I know you said that him starting again isn't an option. When my second son was born 3 months after my older was weaned he asked for milkies. I said "really?OK!" My son was so shocked that he erupted into giggles and said "NO, it's for baby!" That was the end of that.<br>  <br>  You've done a great job, especially with nursing 16 months. It sounds like your boys have a good bond! :-)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mama of 2 boys, 34 months and 4 months.<br>  <br>  edit - really. don't wean your 16 month old. Would you take advice from someone who can't spell wein? haha
SxgOy9uPaa	Sit down with your Mom & tell her,that your stupid,dumb,GNFIwhy this is happening to you..Once Mom gets over the shock,of her baby,having a baby..You both can get on with making plans IE adoption,keep,all  of these things that have TO BE done prior to baby's arrival..Unpleasant it may be but has to be done.. Please respect your Mom in this,you will need her understanding,her encouragement during the bad times & above all her HUGS so you know your not alone..The jolly best of luck to you & your Mom..My best wishes to you,will say a prayer for you..Take care please &stay well..|`|kTZevQNHaa	Oh dear...Don't delay--inform Mom right away...you NEED to because the clock--it's ticking and if you wait too long, your options will be less...well your best bet is to FIRST go to your school guidance counselor and  discuss your options...then get the counselor to accompany you while you tell your Mom...and then you both can make an informed decision about what to do regarding this untimely pregnancy.<br>  <br>  When deciding , try to keep in mind that if you do keep your baby, your life will dramatically change and then life is no longer just about you--but you will then have to be THERE to raise your child--with child as top priority...and kiss your youth  goodbye honey--that baby is your responsibility for the next 18 years...and that is not to say don't  have and keep baby--but just to help you be prepared for what is in store. There's lots of loving and sane couples just praying for a baby of their own--who'd do a good job raising your child and offering baby all the luxuries and opportunities in life which you may not be equipped to handle--financially or emotionally...and then the grim option of abortion...it's up to you which your heart says is best...but weigh your options carefully...with an open mind and heart.<br>  <br>  This underage sex is a risky venture...seems fun at the time but there's such consequences that can hurl one into the adult world with lighting propulsion...one moment you're a carefree teen...next thing you know--it's time to mann up and be a Mother...and that--that's a lifelong committment...so next time, think with wisdom...and use a condom or wait till you're older to have sex.|`|HxfE4oYwaa	First of all, its okay to be scared, just don't do anything extreme, my cousin got pregnant and ran away out of fear but came back two weeks later and everything is okay with her now she kept the baby and her boyfriend is helping and involved in the baby's life, she was 17.  But my best suggestion if you don't want to face her directly, write a letter to her, this way you can say all you want without your words getting lost in a storm of emotion.  This will also help you to cope with your emotions by getting all out and down, your also able to give more thought to it of what you want to do, express this so your mother can help you better.|`|CYYWX0x6aa	okay...<br>  lets see...<br>  soften her up, make her day, give her compliments on everything, help her out, but dont be too predictable, and then tell her the good news, when she's in a happy mood.<br>  or, you can tell her straight out, and then add that the husband's parents and him agreed to help you out, and assure her that they will take care of you and the baby<br>  let her calm down, think it over, and assure her again|`|aL0OCQG3aa	Theres no way to avoid this, youre going to get bigger and bigger, and you need to see a docotr for the health of this baby. Theres no easy way to tell her, you just have to sit here down and tell her. Before you have sex again, remember: if you're mature enough to have sex with someone, you should be mature enough to handle a baby.<br>  Best of luck, I hope everything works out with your baby|`|uNIHqmH8aa	Just say it without thinking. Looks like your good at doing things without thinking. Being that your young enough to be worrying about it.<br>  <br>  -Nov|`|SDjHVnALaa	She'll yell yes you got pregnant it was a mistake probably. noones perfect everyone made a bad decison on wearing condoms or not. Just tell her.|`|y7IiZwuYaa	just be like mom, im prego. and just talk to her and tell her you really need her right now because your scared|`|iNPamc3Faa	First apologize and say that you love her and are grateful she was such a great mom to you. Sucking up always works ;]. Then just come right out and tell her. She'll understand but if she yells or anything, don't yell back! It'll make it worse. Just apologize over and over. Good luck with your mom and good luck with your baby!|`|EHQCkDaqaa	sit her down and tell her that theres something really important you need to tell her.. ( i always think that by starting out that way, it sort of starts the shock process)..<br>  <br>  then if its your boyfriend.. talk about him... that will kind of get her thinking about it... <br>  <br>  but the easiest thing to do is to say that you are pregnant. rip off the bandaid...|`|454bbfa3cd9f581722ab32321ee38ec9aa	Do the old. "Mom, I need to talk to you" I told my mom I was pregnant when I was 17, she was disappointed but the sooner you tell her the sooner you can go to the OBGYN and get the care the baby needs.|`|uAzToWC7aa	well, you need to tell her asap, so that she can help you. have you wantched secret life of an american teeanger? well, say, mom, stay calm, but i need to tell you something important. im pregnant, tell her how long youve been predgnant. and then see the doctor asap|`|zSpFXIrfaa	sit her down just you and her and explain it. it will be fine|`|4RxE1Ad6aa	have her sit down and say mom i am pregnant|`|MOM1ljWNaa	tell her mom umm i have a bf and i am pregnant don't be shy|`|kPhDSht2aa	ask her this: mom, how should i tell u that i'm pregnant?|`|Nytn8HB8aa	First you need to be sure you're pregnant. I know that sounds dumb, but false alarms are possible. <br>  <br>  Second: People may say this is easy, and maybe saying the words, "Mom, I'm pregnant" are physically easy to produce, but this comes with a lot of emotional response and a lifetime of responsibility. If the father is in the picture, I'd bring him. Find your mom when she's in a good mood and not busy with anything. Ask her to sit down because you have something very important you need to talk about. She'll probably be nervous and look at you questioningly. You can either start slow or jump right in, but be prepared for questions, outbursts, and to give her some time to think. <br>  <br>  I wish you all the luck in the world. Also, the sooner the better in my mind.|`|0cM2pYk2aa	To Slasher: STOP TROLLING YOU LOSER!<br>  <br>  ---<br>  Just calmly sit down with your mom and say "Mom, I don't know if this is the best way to tell you this, but...I'm pregnant. I know I was being irresponsible, but I want to go through with this and have the baby. I need your help. Can you please help me?"<br>  <br>  You should have the baby :] Even if you may not want to keep it, having it is the best option, rather than abortion.|`|loqsl5xXaa	make sure u really are.. I would go to planned parent hood and find out for sure.. you wanna make sure before you spill this kind of info. THEN SIT down with her and in a calm way just spit it out. She wont hate you for it. May be disappointed which is worse. She will be there for you just trust her to and trust yourself. Talk with her on what you want to and what is best for you. She may cry, yell, just be very shocked and overwhelmed, but she will come around. She can be your best friend through all of this. Talk to her now. the sooner the better and trust me you need her support and love through all this. be brave stay calm and let her know.|`|ERYBYZA5aa	how old are you if you are 17 and down then wow you wouldnt have to tell her anything if you werent messing around<br>  <br>   and if your older then...my bad ;)|`|3hBQz33Yaa	when i got pregnant with my first i was afraid to tell my mom also. you have to sit her down and tell her..obviously shes going to find out eventually better for you to come forward and just be honest. i know your afraid and she will probably be shocked and maybe mad but i bet her reaction wont be near as bad as your expecting..atleast with my mom it wasnt. goodluck hun!|`|OK9SqlPbaa	Just be onist, im not sure how to spell it.... if she loves you she wont kill you....trying to say it good|`|klOP21xTaa	NO EASY WAY, simply sit her down and tell her she will freak as would any parent, you have let your parents down big time, be ashamed, but beyond all that there is the small matter of the child, you must keep it, no way round that either, don't become a murderer as well, god is watching.|`|aa803315bcb1f313aaf607262e3f91d0aa	well if she knows you've had sex before then that would be a bit easier. also watching the first episodes of the secret life of the american teenager.<br>  but you just need toll her "Mom, I have a real problem that  I need your  help with."

u94HOVz7aa	ive seen both chunky and skinny babies from both breastfed and formula fed babies.  <br>  <br>  examples:<br>  one of my cousins breastfed and her daughter was always in 10th to 25th % for weigth<br>  another cousin breastfed and her daughter was in 75th to 100th plus% for weight<br>  <br>  i formula feed and my babies are always skinny as in 10th -25th % for weight, <br>  while my sis in law formula fed and her babies were chunky 75th to 100th % for weigh<br>  <br>  i dont think its just one way causes one or the other|`|HqOkC2YHaa	I think it just depends on the babies appetite.

Mine is a chunky monkey and he is formula fed now.|`|JsEd4H0raa	They both are.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	HA HA yea right...that's why my formula fed 8-month old is only 16 pounds.  I think it's the OTHER way around.|`|fMilDRgLaa	Normally, formula fed babies are chunkier. Although my pediatrician always said my 2 breastfed boys were "juicy". It takes alot more formula to fill a baby up then breastmilk.  Breast milk is like the concentrated version and BTW much better without all those crazy ingredients you can't pronounce on the can of formula.|`|CvESLNnkaa	I really don't see that much different but the better question would be are they healthier.  My son was feed on formula; I couldn't breast feed to a condition I have.  I don't think there is near the difference they make it out to be so do what ever you feel is best.|`|QvoPb2SBaa	No way to tell. My breastfed baby was born 7lbs 2oz and he just ate and ate till he got fat. He has surpassed the michelin baby stage and is now a sumo wrestler. lol... hopefully solids that we just introduced now will get him a little smaller. My arms are aching now!|`|dpMssGdnaa	breastfed babies are bigger when babies but healthier when toddler and adults. Bottle fed babies weight less whenbabies but tend to have more obesity problems are they also take longer to recognize when full.|`|oem5yEUDaa	Formula fed babies are often chunkier because if they don't finish the whole bottle some mothers will force them to. Baby knows when to stop and you shouldn't try to make her finish it if she doesn't want to.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	I think formula fed babies are chunkier. My son is 2 weeks older than his cousin and much smaller. My son is BF his cousin in formula fed.|`|Gr78AFvyaa	I have a chunky breastfed baby. she was 8lb 4oz when she was born (9 days ago) and she weighs 8lbs 17oz today....|`|UY3j47ozaa	my baby is breast fed and chunky...|`|aJLx0nhNaa	There is more danger of over feeding with formula-fed babies.  Formula is expensive and parents sometimes feel pressure to force the baby to finish the bottle.  It would be highly unlikely, for example, for a breast fed baby to become dangerously overweight.<br>  <br>  But babies are chubby normally and among my friends it varies.  I've seen slim formula babies and chunky breast fed babies.  My son is a chunkster and formula fed.|`|kzt8Kdkfaa	For most babies, being chunky is controlled by genetics.  It is easier to overfeed a formula fed baby though, so "unnatural" chunkiness would be more common amongst formula fed babies.|`|pJiTbIpYaa	My daughter is formula fed (breastfed first 3 months) And she is not chunky. She is still quite tiny. She was 2.5 kilos when born and is only 8.5 kilos now and she is 1. We thought there was something wrong but she is just petite. My sisters kids, formula fed and they were so chunky. I think it can just depend on the baby.<br>  <br>  To the person above, i hav never met a formula feeding mother who forces her child to finish a bottle. I certainly never have.<br>  <br>  I also think it has a lot to do with the baby's movement. If they move around a lot (like my daughter) they tend to burn more body fat If they don't move around that much then they don't burn as much fat. I guess it also depends on the baby's appetite.<br>  <br>  Once again, formula feeding mothers don't force their babies to drink a full bottle just because formula is epensive. It only costs me $26 AU for a 900gram tin of formula.|`|vKEYa8aeaa	i think it just depends on the baby, ive seen chunky BFd babys and chunky FFd babys, and both the other way around too.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	no it IS the other way around. my baby is both, and shes fatter than babies i know who are exclusively formula-fed.|`|LWXRVO5Haa	My breastfed baby is fat and happy.
ro4gGSh8aa	I would say that the woman probably found out at the earliest October 16th, 2008. <br>  <br>  This is based on you saying 5 1/2 months pregnant which would = 22 weeks gestation. <br>  <br>  If you calculate due date from that she would be due June 25th, 2009. There is a pregnancy calculator that will calculate things forward and backward. <br>  <br>  The date of LMP would be Sept 18th, 2008 and date of ovulation would be October 2nd, 2008. <br>  <br>  You typically test 2 weeks after ovulation which would be October 16th, 2008. <br>  <br>  See source below.|`|lwPbfbMEaa	i would say maybe round 26th september?
AA10015577	You just have to know that everyone is different and also depends on how you are carrying.  With my first I was 5'9" at 128 lbs. (underweight for my BMI) and didn't start showing until I was about 16 weeks.  It's normal.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	hey <br>  <br>  possibly darling. But before 14 weeks on first pregnancy it is usually bloating.<br>  Every one is different. on average it is 16 - 24 weeks<br>  <br>  god bless x|`|6L9jJnchaa	It's probably just bloating at this point.  I'm 23 weeks and still people aren't asking me if I'm pregnant, lol.|`|jOyzcJd7aa	Don't worry! I'm about 5 nothing and weighed 95 before the pregnancy and I started showing around the same time! I guess since we're so small it shows faster. A couple weeks ago my stomach would be HUGE at night then shrink by morning. Well good luck and congrats!|`|apUkTo3maa	YES SINCE YOUR SO TINY THAT IS WHY YOU ARE SHOWING SO EARLY|`|AA12282580	I didnt show until i was 5-6 months|`|mqHL4UcRaa	Heres how it works. Your uterus (the bump) gradually stretches/expands upwards to womb the baby. At 11 weeks, its just peeking above the pubic bone. This means any other tissues/organs are going to move up as well. So the bump may not be the uterus YET but its causing everything else to pooch out a bit. <br>  <br>  When you reach about 14 weeks you will be able to feel the uterus. It will feel harder than the rest of your belly. Then when you reach 20 weeks it will be level with your belly button. So from your belly button down will be hard. The process continues until your 40 weeks with a solid stomach (uterus).|`|vfq04nc1aa	hi!<br>  First of all congrats!<br>  Im quite skinny and petite too and im 17 weeks pregnant. I started to get a little bum around this time too. My doctor just said its the uterus getting bigger. I noticed that my clothes were getting a little tighter. Hahaha and now that im 17 weeks there is no denying i'm pregnant. Just show off your little bump and be proud of it! <br>  When i first started showing i hadn't put on any weight but now after passing the first trimester i'm putting on about half a kilo a week. Right on schedule.<br>  Take care and Good Luck!!!|`|cr5TQgmUaa	I'm 4' 10" and I swear I was showing at 8 weeks whether it was bloating or not -- I was huge by the time my first child was born. Enjoy every second of it.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	Yes its normal.<br>  My coworker is 8 weeks and she's is showing. Her belly is hard so its not that she's bloated.<br>  <br>  Congrats!
Xrwvu5Uraa	well...yes you could be pregnant.<br>  we don't know if you are.<br>  anytime you have unprotected sex you can be pregnant, even protected sex actually.<br>  tylenol will not harm the baby, that is one of the only medicines you can take while being pregnant.<br>  you shoud stop taking the penicillin if you think that you may be pregnant.<br>  wait until your missed period or a couple days before you are due for it, and go to your doctors.<br>  good luck|`|wnxOXBuKaa	Do you *want* to be pregnant? I'm always confused by these questions because if you've had unprotected sex even once, then YES there is a chance you could be pregnant. <br>  <br>  So that's the answer. YES you could be pregnant if you had unprotected sex. You could even be pregnant if he pulled out.<br>  <br>  <br>  You sound *really* young and I'm hoping this scare will get your head straight and you act more responsible (If you aren't TTC) . <br>  <br>  Somehow, though, I have a feeling that you may post this same question every month until you do get pregnant . <br>  <br>  *sigh*
0qP8gLpyaa	My son is turning 2 next month and has NEVER pooped in the tub, so I would have to say based on my experience that no, it isn't normal. Wait and do bath after she has pooped for the night and then put clean diapers on her after bath. It will lessen the chance of this happening.|`|68c6B8dRaa	That's why so many bath toys are based on sieves. They're for parents to use to scoop out the poo.|`|n53HeORBaa	yah lol, it happens all the time, you were luckier she poops in the tub, try washing your daughters bottom when suddenly something runny adn warm hits your hand, can you say gross?! <br>  bright side at least a child's' poop is not that icky since they still have milk and other healthy foods|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Yes it has happened with my son...it was worse though his sister was in the tub! It happened about a year ago he was almost 2 and she was almost 4! Im glad we had a old fish net!|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yea  its normal, little kids are gross|`|283JrACKaa	yes it`s gross I know, but she`s a kid deal with it. haha|`|o65klEwWaa	lol<br>  My first daughter did it only once and it was so funny. She stood up, bent over and just by chance a plastic jug that I use for pouring water over her head was submerged directly below her bottom. Before I knew what was happening, the poo landed neatly into the jug.<br>  My 2nd daughter has done this several times with worse consequences. And wee'd in the bath while her older sister was in it. I always ensure that she goes to the toilet first before the bath, but it took a while for me to learn this.|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	Once with my second.  Never with my first.  I actually got in the tub with my son and my husband was going to come in and get him out once I was done washing him.  With my soap and his, etc. it clouded the water.  I felt something in the water and thought it was a washcloth so I am "fishing" for it trying to grab it.  I finally thought wait, no washcloth is in the tub and then noticed what I grabbed was poop!!!!  I flipped out and drained the water.  Got him out and showered.  I was actually feeling over and over to catch it and it would slip away.  Now my daughter, she wasnt potty trained and was naked in the bathroom.  I was in the tub and she wanted in w/ me.  She squatted on the rug and pooped this long skinny turd.  I yelled for my husband to come.  He opens the door and walks in to yell at me for not picking her up and putting her in with me.  I didnt get to say look down or watch out because he was too busy complaining before even knowing the real situation.  He was less than a inch away from stepping in it with bare feet.  I said look down and then he was like ugh!  I was laughing so hard.|`|LAsYy7C8aa	oh my God yes...I'm a mother of 3 girls and its happened a few times in the past....my 2 1/2 year old just did that a few weeks ago.  She earned the name poopcaso for the masterpeice she painted on her bedroom wall in the middle of the night!!  My first daughter had explosive bowels and shot poop out during diaper changes....3 to 4 feet if I wasn't in the line of fire.  Parenting can be a little  poopy, but it has its rewards.  Now nothing out of a baby butt suprises me...|`|PNqwhlq9aa	Unfortunately yes but my son (19 months) gets so relaxed it just happens. I pull him and poop out and then bleach the tub and start again :( Now I wash him first thing then if it happens we are all done. It's a kid thing|`|o2l9rUA0aa	It's just a sign the your child is relaxed. that is a good thing. No matter how gross  it is. It happened with kids to at times.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	It happen all the time..& drs say to give baby warm baths if there not pooping right, it's natural!|`|QM7cAE4vaa	Yes it has happened, it's gross but wash her up and it'll be o.k.|`|CvESLNnkaa	its gross but natural, just laugh and move on.|`|150235381859c05acd2860d60d189ed1aa	LOL  I never feared it I just waited for it. I have twins and around 18 months old one of did poo in the Tub. I was calling my hubby so he can hold one of them while I drained the water and had the other one sitting on the potty doing here thing. it hasn't happend again but it was pretty funny.|`|2585e7e86671999b1b6f36975e39adf0aa	Yes happened to me my daughter was about 2.<br>  <br>  But some pediatricians will actually tell you to put a constipated child in a bath of warm water as it relaxes them enough to let the bowels move.<br>  <br>  But none the less yes it isn't pleasant. LOL|`|dLLDwZaraa	It happens here quite often, every couple weeks or so.....<br>  <br>  Its not too pleasant, but no need to be totally grossed out...she's only a baby....plenty more really gross stuff to come, might as well get used to it....sh*t happens!|`|t28NApGsaa	My little brother always did that until he was like 3. dont worry about it there is nothing you can do.|`|P7q9cNaiaa	When I was about three (maybe four) my little brother pooped in the tub while I was in it. SO gross!!
l46COY9eaa	I am sorry I can't really answer, but I am 38, and I am about 7 weeks along and although I have my first ultrasound next week there is a HUGE possibilty of my having twins (ivf) and because of my age and if it is multiples I am already resigned to the fact I'll probly have a c-section. But right now I don't care, it took me 10 years to finally be able to get pregnant, so as long as I get a healthy baby (or babies) I won't feel robbed of the whole "birth" experience. I really wish you well and please try not to stress and worry! It's not good for you or your little one! :)|`|C55pji5Qaa	Well I am only 24 but I am carrying twins.I am 33 weeks. I have had some complications BUT I had IVF.I have been on bed rest since 20 weeks BUT surgeries in the past have made my cervix incompetent.I have had tons of BH and am on medicine for that.At one point we thought Baby B had IUGR.Things have kept piling up. They were just hoping I would get to 30 weeks but I am already at 33 weeks and no end in site.Sometimes it is hard but that doesn't mean you won't have a good outcome.Also,in the book"When you are expecting twins,triplets or quads",they say your risks are lower with a twin pregnancy if this is not your first pregnancy and if you are older. You are not old by any means.Good luck,you will do just fine!
kVBDpAMTaa	Yes, i think so anyway. I started out at 103lbs before pregnancy and had a really flat stomach and I have always been really thin. I am now 25 weeks 5 days and weigh 126 and I don't have one stretch mark. [not yet anyway :P]  I use cocoa butter everyday, and sometimes use tummy butter.|`|QYYWBrG7aa	it hasn't been working for me and i use it three times a day everyday!|`|ibWLdXlJaa	It didn't help keep them away or get rid of them that's for sure. I used it to try to keep my stomach somewhat smooth and to keep it from itching. It did great with that end.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	No it wont work for stretch marks, if you're going to get them, you're gonna get them no matter what.  I'm 39 weeks and 2 days and I've been using cocoa butter religiously and about 2 weeks ago I got a couple stretch marks anyway.  I use cocoa butter AND bio oil now. I kept asking around about this too, because its discouraging to hear the truth that its not going to do anything but keep your skin hydrated.  Still use it though because your skin will be itchy and irritated if you don't.|`|IlSALGKMaa	No, it DOESN'T work. It will keep your skin moisturized, but not prevent stretch marks. I asked my doctor, plus my pregnancy book says something about them coming from beneath the skin, where no lotion can reach. If your mom has them, or if you have them somewhere on your body already, you're most likely going to get them. The best thing to do is keep your body hydrated. Drink lots of water! Good luck.<br>  <br>  (Also, I was using it up until I asked my doctor and it wasn't working at all for me.)|`|0bX3uZ3Baa	it will keep your skin supple and well hydrated...but it won't prevent stretch marks. sorry. they're hereditary and there's nothing that you can do to prevent them.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	Yes.  Especially a lotion with both cocoa butter and vitamin E.|`|qHAgbuHkaa	Its worth a try, but if you're going to get stretch marks, you're going to get them anyway. Cocoa butter is very unlikely to stop you from getting stretch marks. It may prevent them from getting as bad or as big, but it won't completely eliminate them. Stretch marks are more of a hereditary thing. For people who say it worked for them because they didn't get any stretch marks..it wasn't the cocoa butter that made them not get any. It was simply the fact that their skin isn't the type to get stretch marks.|`|WTASRbzAaa	well you hav2 use it very often2 make the stretch marks go away (my mom told me;])<br>  & when i use it, it makes my skin soooooo smooth & nice<br>  it also smells really pretty(=<br>  hope this helps(=|`|C8E3fe3xaa	I've been using it twice a day everyday since i was 8 weeks pregnant, i'm 24 weeks now and already have one stretch mark on my side :( it probably won't completely stop you from getting stretch marks but it definitely can't hurt! Good luck :)|`|DksDTsuQaa	yes cocoa butter does work while your pregnant and after i have two children and have no stretch marks because i used cocoa butter ..so the sooner you start to use cocoa butter the better results you get..|`|pGycOnJraa	It does soften the skin...but it depends. I've never know anybody that got rid of it completely after they got the stretch march. But cocoa butter is amazing!|`|68ce7bd873a8d57e0241369627f2ef71aa	i heard the same thing. I got palmers coco butter cream for stretch marks and I use it often and its not helping much..only in certain areas.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Ahhhh if you are going to get stretch marks sadly nothing will prevent them.|`|161Cb2hlaa	cocoa butter works miracles
HpWCjBv6aa	Why are you talking to him via text if you don't like him?  Block his phone number, and ignore his messages.<br>  <br>  Like I just posted on someone else's question, he's trying to get under your skin and get a rise out of you.  Don't give him that satisfaction.  I'm not saying you should walk up to him and wave and hug him or something, I'm saying that you should ignore him and just don't worry about what he's saying.  He's being immature and he's getting a good rise out of you.  Don't give in to him.|`|eu6UQElYaa	You can't get over it because you're a teenager and like most teenagers you need to create more drama in your life than necessary.   Forget about it and move on and once he realizes that he's not important enough to you to get a response then he'll likely back off and find something else to do.<br>  <br>  By the way, why do you guys give your cell numbers, myspace addresses, emails etc. out to people like this?  I mean you set yourself up for harrassment.  Makes no sense.|`|oOwoyV1Zaa	first of all dont listen to him he might like you even sometimes ppl make  fun of ppl cuz they envy or like them either waay good luck!!|`|yV8fog7Paa	he;s a jerk, youi know he is. realize there are others better, annd...you should be focused on grades, NOT boyfriends.|`|9tyx5BkPaa	dude. what the heck. have some pride for yourself! get up and leave! you need to listen to some jojo.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	ok.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	If that is the way you want the rest of your life to be, don't get over him.<br>  <br>  I have been married for 14 years and my man has never called me names like that - I wouldn't be with him if he did!<br>  <br>  He treats you like that coz he can - stop that behaviour of his now, or dump him.<br>  <br>  You only say "I can't get over him" because it sounds good, like romantic or something, but get a life and move on - there are nice guys out there - find one for yourself and have a happy life without a mouthy guy like that one!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|7nev9Jxiaa	damnn <br>  u need to slap him... <br>  umm kick him where it would really hurts [yeah that will teach him lol]<br>  but dont pay attention to a guy like that...<br>   dont let him get to u<br>  thats probably what he wants...<br>   to get u madd or sad and stuff cuz he has no<br>  other way of taking his emotions off.....<br>  but seriously dont give him attention his looking for<br>  guys like that arent worth it.....<br>  {make a voodoo doll lol jk jk }<br>  if u know that ur not any of those things he called u <br>  why pay attention to it sweetie?<br>  just let it go..... LET IT GOOOO <br>  its for the best :]|`|jkL4K7otaa	ok hun as far as i am concerned this boy is not worth it he is just another one of those *** wholes you know that is what like all guys are like im sure further along in life you will find someone worth your time trust me on that one but dont easily trust a guy youll get hurt easily like that|`|kWKZoQogaa	Yeah, I've been in your position. Except it was more classified as mental/emotional abuse, a bit worse than this, but it's similar.<br>  <br>  Distance yourself from him. Don't get in contact with him. The sooner you do this, the sooner you get over him.|`|SZZkfVzbaa	"Look, I would absolutely LOVE to see life from your point of view, but I just can't seem to stick my head that far up my a$$"<br>  <br>  That one works every time. <br>  <br>  ?M.|`|pVpQuWXzaa	Slap him lol i would and just over on.|`|FWVuePiNaa	i'm got a *****!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|b2j5AE1oaa	did you like him or what?|`|11PhrWqYaa	Yeah, I know what your talking about. My first love was a jerk. A total jerk. I liked him for about 4 years. In fact, to this day I still love him. But you have to move on, He might just be playing and really like you but until thing play the field a bit - it will get depressing when the only thing you can is think about him.|`|9aIotOULaa	if you just ignore it, laugh it off, or act like it doesn't bother you he will probably stop, he just wants the reaction and if you take it away he has no reason to continue.<br>  there is the chance too that he likes you but doesn't know how to start a normal conversation<br>  <br>  keep your head high and don't buy into his insults!|`|aoGh9umlaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!! that is HYSTERICAlL!!! he is a little douche bag and you cant get over him?!?!? what the **** is wrong wiht you!?!?!HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAH...|`|DKK8NRu7aa	Draw violent pictures depicting him undergoing various methods of torture.  That always helps me.<br>  <br>  ^_^|`|ftyfYQsfaa	shove poop in his mouth the next time he says something<br>  <br>  my grandma did that to me when i was little and i never spoke to her mean again|`|h5cFkP35aa	uh...you need some fkn help and a self-esteem booster. And its obviously not him.|`|GRebsvfiaa	give him one ***** slap then he wont annoy u again|`|FFDy7HU8aa	im hoping ur not dating him...Just tell him never to talk to you again
y7Mwptsraa	Most fish have teeth. Clown fish have small flattened teeth on the jawline that are used for capturing prey. Their food then goes past the tongue where there is another set of teeth that are used for crushing and cutting the prey. This set is mounted on the same bones that support the gills. <br>  <br>  This is just one of many arrangements for teeth found in fish. There is rarely one one row of teeth. Some other types of fish have gripping spines on the tongue, similar to what a cat has.|`|UAJjnsBuaa	what sparky said... heh heh :)
vKEYa8aeaa	it has nothing to do with that =] my mom didnt get ONE stretch mark but ripped with me [only child], a friend of mine got HORRIBLE stretch marks and didnt rip one bit or get an episiotomy. vaginal tissue stretches differently and alot more than skin, they arent the same kind of tissue =] good luck!|`|AA11763588	Stretch marks on your body have nothing to do with how you will or will not tear when you give birth.|`|mqHL4UcRaa	No. That has nothing to do with your skins elasticity. If you push your baby out too quickly, then your more likely to rip. If you relax and gradually push your baby out, then your body will expand as it needs to. It's very natural.<br>  <br>  Stretch marks means your skin has reached its elasticity.|`|lzUF22l0aa	no that does not mean you will tear. If your really worried you can google some massages to help make it stretchier down there. Also you can never tell it has to do with the baby also how big the head and the shoulders are.|`|AA10015577	I never really thought of that but I did tear, so it's possible.  Perineal massage and exercise help out with that too though.|`|UY3j47ozaa	good question...i had c sections so i dont know but i have no stretch marks..|`|G0QugnQ8aa	no...a woman getting/having stretch marks doesn't really predict whether or not she will tear...you may be able to reduce the chance though if you massage your perineum regularly, some say that that can help make the skin in that area more pliable and elastic...|`|nHXXh9Q0aa	That has nothing to do with tearing during delivery!  Who ever told you that is yanking your chain.<br>  <br>  I had 0 stretch marks and I ended up tearing.  I delivered a 9lb 10oz baby.|`|KIZVWREHaa	nope not at all . It depends on how small you are down there . I have no stretch marks on me but tore twice and had 2 epesotomies .
kpnSKV6Eaa	no they are great but lauren could have a nick name of lori too or laurie however you would spell it|`|DHwPgw9iaa	Well, it's kind of weird to have two L names and one A name, don't you think? What about Emilia, Alexis, and Lauren (Lia, Lexi, and Lauren)? That way if, when they grow up, they want to distinguish themselves, they can choose different nicknames of:<br>  <br>  Emmy/Mia<br>  Allie/Alex<br>  Lauren|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I think they are very cute together, i really love the name Alexis (it's my middle name lol) and Lexi is a cute nickname.  Leah is really cute too, and Lauren is pretty cute too, i like Laurie for a nickname for it.<br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|lBW6n3I1aa	Absoulutley! The names are georgous! And the L isn't really bad! (unlike Lacey, lexi, and lilly or something like that)|`|mbfXOPRXaa	I think its okay, other than the fact you apparently already have a daughter named Sienna.  She will feel left out.<br>  <br>  Ohh okay!!  I still think they are cute names though (:|`|rtx7GUCdaa	oh that's so cute i love the L's its so cute|`|oFLxpEzbaa	Its cute. Leah and Alexis are also sisters on Jon and Kate Plus 8. they are two of the 3 girls of the 6 sextuplets. I love the names.|`|wVW7nxSzaa	Cute sibling set! I love it! I'm in a set like this:<br>  <br>  McKala Autum ( me)<br>  Shaye Lynn ( little sister)<br>  Connor Ryan ( little brother)|`|jfLAZGXFaa	That is the cutest set of names ever<br>  and what ashley said wasnt a bad idea either.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	I think it's great...and the first letter L is neat...
C8E3fe3xaa	Have you not had an ultrasound done yet? If not, you should be having one done really soon and you will be able to find out the sex.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	You should be having the ultra sound to find out the sex in about two more weeks but here is the thing. Those superstitions about where the baby is and if you eat or not are so wrong although fun to guess and play along with it. I have two boys and with one I was always hungary carried low and the other I carried high and had no appetite at all. I never got sick with either though.<br>  -Tyffannie mom of 2 opposite boys|`|giRRCXU4aa	Don't rely on stupid internet survery and things to determine the sex of your baby. Also, the way you are carrying has nothing to do with it. You should be having an ultrasound to determine that.|`|7OZQ7PqTaa	How you carry a baby really has nothing to do with the gender of the baby. It has to do with your genetics and your body's makeup and the position of the baby. All the stuff you hear about carrying high, low or whatever-even heartburn, morning sickness or the lack thereof-they're all just urban legends and don't mean anything scientific.|`|IlSALGKMaa	The tests online are just predictions and aren't accurate.... The only accurate way is to have an ultrasound and you're far along enough to be able to tell... She said no extra parts, so that most likely means a girl.<br>  <br>  PS: The way you're carrying has nothing to do with it, that's just an old wives tale.
HpWCjBv6aa	A chemical imbalance, or even hormonal imbalance, can throw off someones "groove".  It could be the reason for behavioral inconsistencies, as well as other problems.<br>  <br>  Medication, therapy, and talking to a psychologist are all ways to help with a chemical imbalance.  At one time, I was diagnosed with mild depression and moderate anxiety.  I was put on Prozac, but I feel like just talking to my therapist and letting out my feelings helped me a lot more than some silly drug so I stopped taking it, and I was right.  It's not a bad thing to let out your feelings.<br>  <br>  Talk some more to your school nurse and see if she can get you the number to a psychologist that specializes in teens.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	A chemical imbalace usually means bi polar there are many different kind of it and no your are not some freak or anything it is normal. I would keep talking with your councler and see if you should get therapy to help you be able to control your feelings<br>  tyfftaff|`|VJpdmd0waa	It only a bad thing if you don't get help.<br>  Like im bipolar an Ive gotten that because I have a chemical imbalance.<br>  But the first thing you need to do is get the right test done to see if they really is the case.<br>  That way you can get medication, therapy, an so on. <br>  Good Luck|`|9aIotOULaa	a chemical imbalance could cause unpredictable behavior, but that doesn't mean it can't be controlled with medication, therapy, etc.<br>  <br>  however it shouldn't even concern ppl at your school, because it is your private medical information|`|DT6EXkVzaa	You need to talk to a doctor
MOsStEbqaa	It could be all 3 of those reason. I had almost all of those symptoms before i realized i was pregnant. All you can do is take a test to know for sure.|`|dAQHWvY0aa	I agree, it could be pregnancy, but I think you should try a home pregnancy test. If it helps any, I am breast feeding too - Haven't had a period for almost 6 months and I had many of those symptoms about a month ago - I am not pregnant, and I still haven't gotten my period. I think hormones are powerful things, and can cause  quite the uproar when they want to! <br>  I hope it all turns out okay, whichever way you want it to go! Try not to panic, just go to the doctor and get a blood test done if you don't trust the home preg test.|`|xOEdgWjAaa	Ok so my daughters only 3 months So I know i'm not that knowledgeable but my doctor told me your really fertile right after you have a baby and also while breast feeding.
ILICVpwHaa	I'm wondering if her son is a show off and tends to get into trouble (on his own not with your son's help) because he is busy trying to show-off and do things he's not supposed to do.  I wouldn't worry about your son and I'd probably just get him involved with other kids and forget about this friend because it doesn't sound like the parents are going to let up so what's the point of even trying with them?|`|eu6UQElYaa	Maybe the reason they haven't hung out in a year is because your son has a bad effect on her son.  It could be that her son just gravitates towards trouble but that it's WORSE when he's with your son.|`|g7uMKvEzaa	I took that as THEIR son is giving them trouble, not your son..he might be that way when he gets with his friends , no matter who his friends are. Some kids just act up among friends and it probably is HIM not your son...That is how I took it!<br>  They might be looking for a reason , Not to have their son around anyone. They are trying to control him a bit too much and it will probably back fire. I wish them GOOD LUCK! Tell your son, not to take it personally...His friends parents are just weird and don't trust their own son.|`|ff700543f3408186155eccc4290362b5aa	Well, first of all, I would want to know exactly what trouble they found when they were together. I would ask the parent specifics. She may be praising your kid, but said when they got together they were trouble. Well, what exactly? I would ask point blank, maybe its something you are not aware of. If they praised your kid so much, they would want him hanging out with their son. I think the problem may be with their kid. Who knows?, maybe when he got into some trouble, he told his parents it was your kids fault? Ask them to be specific, and then drop it, your son will find new friends. Its not worth brow beating them about it.<br>  Good luck|`|juXQJJrXaa	IM NOT SURE HOW OLD YOUR SON IS.. BUT IF SHE SAYS THAT HER SON "DOESNT NEED TO BE IN ANYMORE TROUBLE" AND HE IS INFACT GROUNDED ALL THE TIME.. DONT U THINK MAYBE YOU WOULDNT WANT YOUR SON HANGING AROUND HIM?  JUST AS YOUR SON CAN RUB OFF GOOD ON SOME, OTHER KIDS WILL HAVE AN INFLUENCE ON HIM AND MIGHT MAKE HIM DO THINGS HE WOULDNT NORMALLY DO BECAUSE OF PEER PRESSURE.. I WOULD THINK TWICE ABOUT LETTING THIS OTHER KID AROUND YOUR SON..|`|4RxE1Ad6aa	i would be to, i am with you,  i mean that makes like no sense what-so- ever so i would encourage your son to maybe make more friends and try to ignore what the little boys parents said- huh people people people well good luck and i hope everything works out for you|`|706fa9fa645a352ed4dc9e7315894893aa	I think thats wrong! Maybe if your son hung around the other little boy maybe he'd rub off on the other boy so he wouldnt be so bad. I dont know...maybe its for the better!
e98eb6bfbd976f30fe5455f0fb6ae9d8aa	I didn't properly show or 'pop' until I was 6 months pregnant!  It all depends on how your body is and how you carry the baby.  Everybody is different, one of my friends was visibly pregnant at 8 weeks.|`|zj6RYX5uaa	ANYWHERE AROUND 16-25 WEEKS|`|kVBDpAMTaa	I just started showing enough to where other people can tell at 24 weeks.|`|puCOYwMmaa	I didn't start showing until about 20ish weeks and then it was only a little bit.  I'm 25 weeks now and some friends have commented that my belly "popped" out of nowhere this week!  <br>  <br>  I'm not sure strangers can really tell yet, I think I'm still in that "fat or pregnant?" phase, lol :)<br>  <br>  Everyone shows at different times.  There are many factors like your build, genetics, where you're carrying the baby (high or low).|`|9bhZVJ61aa	I honestly didn't start to show shoow until about ehh 20 weeks or so I'm not talking hidden bulge behind your zipper im talking baby belly buldge. haha.<br>  Congrats<br>  God bless
j9axB0YMaa	We used Pre-seed when we conceived. I'm not really sure how long it took after we bought it I'm thinking around 6 months. Good luck!
OQFd3pl5aa	I've used it and it is a fabulous lubricant. I used it for 2 or 3 cycles and did not get pregnant. But I've spoken to plenty of women on here that have used it and coincidentally got their bfp the first month they had used it. I do believe it works, and I will not give up on it. I am planning on using it again in the near future. Hopefully I will have the same luck as the other ladies. I say give it a try, it will not hurt anything. Be sure to look on  their website preseed.com to see if it is sold in a store in your area. It's better than waiting for it to come in the mail. Also, look on early-pregnancy-tests.com because sometimes they give you deals such as a few free opks or hpts with the purchase, if you don't mind it being mailed to you. Good luck and lots of baby dust for you :)<br>  <br>  Edit: I've had a long day and read your question wrong and didn't realize you had already purchased it lol. Still hope you find the info helpful :)|`|a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	I heard many successful cases with it but I'm not sure how effective it is yet cos this is my 2nd mth using it..
O1tQ9nMVaa	In my opinion, Herbal Essences is the best. Any product by them is good, and plus, almost all their conditioners smell good. I've been using it for years and it works great for me. You, however, said it was bad, so you should go with one that you think works best with your hair.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	J I Z Z|`|3jFD9PSFaa	Herbal Essences, they use it on America's NExt Top Model, it must be decent right?
16HqzRcfaa	thats deffinatly unfair. i would be soooooooo mad!|`|KeJQIh6Caa	yes i really do think that it is unfair because i have a younger sister who got her ears pierced before me and got a mobile phone before i did all because my parents said that i was too "irresponsible" and i am not!!!<br>  <br>  anyway yea i think you should explain to her that it is NOT fair and that you should get all of the rights that your brother has got. also you should pay for one of them and then mabie your mum might offer to pay for the next one.|`|8pAQmhLLaa	YES, I find that to be very unfair.
Jswomud7aa	Around August 7th you are due for a major reality check....|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	No, it doesn't ruin everything you've ever worked for.  It just means you have to work a little harder to stay focused on your goals.  You can still finish high school and go to college, or whatever goal it is you have.  Remember, your goals aren't just for you now, they're for your baby too, so let that help you stay on track.  I think it's great that you want to own up to your responsibilites and not just run away like so many teen parents do.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Don't pay attention to the rude people.<br>  Even if it wasn't planned, things happen, and you should be proud!<br>  You should be proud of yourself for wanting to be there for your child!<br>  You're not a bad kid, you sound like you've got yourself pretty well together, and you live a healthy lifestyle.<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean you will ruin everything you've ever worked for...you can still do many things you've wanted to do with your life (whether it be post-secondary schooling, working, etc.)<br>  <br>  It can be done, and can be done very effectively.<br>  I think this child will be lucky to have you as a father!<br>  <br>  Congratulations!<br>  (If you are ever worried, or need advice, or are unsure of yourself, don't hesitate to talk to people who support you, even if that means relying on your doctor or a teacher for advice.)<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|P4LBygv2aa	I thought you were 16 ?<br>  u sure u only missed 7 days?<br>  <br>  <br>  Open Question Show me another ? <br>  Im a 16 year old boy going to be a dad what should i do?<br>  im 16 im having a baby with my loving girlfriend who ive been with for 11 months.. i love her a lot & where keeping the baby but shes 15 weeks prego & neither of our parents know... im not sure how to tell them!!! any ideas????(<br>  3 days ago - 23 hours left to answer.|`|DHyUnhS1aa	If you're self-sufficient it doesn't matter if you have no help from others or not.  That being said gratz on the kid.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	You sound like a great dad already and I think what you are doing is honorable. <br>  -tyfftaff|`|zmpk29BLaa	Not necessarily.<br>  <br>  You're going to be a dad either way so you might as well embrace it and not let it ruin your life.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would not be "proud" to be a 17 year old parent.. it shows a lack of responsibility for you and your baby's mama. At 17 you should've been more careful.<br>  <br>  But at this point what is done is done. So just do the best you can.|`|87WOSjwgaa	NO! It just means that you will have to work harder for what you want. Being a parent is very hard work but if you have the drive and determination you can do it. I have friends that had kids young and they are fine! The kids are well behaved and healthy! You just have to stick to your guns and believe in yourself!!|`|2isbOuRhaa	absolutely not. i was 17 when i got pregnant w/my daughter. and she turned out to be the best thing that's ever happened to me! it's not going to be easy, you will get stressed out at some points, but everyone does. my daughter pushed me harder to achieve my goals because I knew what kind of life I wanted her to have. Im 21 and still working towards Nursing. It's taking a little longer than expected, but I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world...|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Okey. I had two children one at 15 and the other at a later 15. You know what? Life is going to suck. People are going to smirk and look at you when you walk around with him. People are going to refer to you as a baby having a baby. But f*ck those people they have no right to tell us what to do.|`|gtTIILgyaa	CONGRATS!!!!!! You are going to need a support system though, even if it is just to vent too. Join this website....<br>  <br>  www.whattoexpect.com<br>  <br>  There are message baords there where you can talk to mothers that are due the same time your baby is. There is ALSO a daddy's board with just dads on it that can help.|`|0QYIbn1saa	Nope, it means you are more than likely going to be a great, responsible dad.  The hardest part will be proving (though the years) that you can be a responsible person and give the best care ever to you child.  <br>  <br>  congrats........................babies are grrrrrrrrrrrreat :)|`|9bhZVJ61aa	Nope Im eighteen and proud great mother don't regret be proud because you need to prove all those air headed rude ppl who say their more mature than us wrong. :]<br>  Congrats <br>  Good luck<br>  God bless.
nKXTjqQWaa	Miss Barry's mom..<br>  <br>  I have you figured out!! Ahh Haaa!! You and the other Barry's mom (now Miss Mizerny) are the same damn person!!! You went as far as answering your own questions saying "stop harassing me" to throw everyone off but I got ya this time!! Ha Ha Ha<br>  <br>  Stop stirring up ****.|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	I feel sorry for your baby, it's a real shame he has to grow up with a mom as mental as you are. What do you gain seriously from the questions you ask? Or your a kid who's mom does not monitor what you do online.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Not sure what you are referring to.  The formula in China?  Maybe you should clarify...<br>  <br>  Edit: Isolated case of a crazy woman.  She could have just as easily sprayed your organic vegetables that you make your own food with.  Or do you grow your own food as well?|`|sw2R5A9iaa	waste of money -make your own.  serve smaller portions of the family's food.|`|XD42367paa	Well, my oldest daughter is almost 21 and I fed her baby food from a jar. She's an honor student in her junior year of college. My son is 19 and is an excellent metal fabricator and welder. I have three teenaged daughters at home who are still in high school and junior high. One is an excellent artist and is writing her third novel, one is an athlete and plays first string in most sports her school offers and the youngest is going to a regional science fair after taking 3rd place in her schools competition. <br>  <br>  I fed them all baby food from a jar that wasn't organic. They seem to have turned out just fine. I expect my six month old will too.|`|irHF6CBPaa	Am I the only one reporting this troll?|`|lKsIKKm2aa	I know I said before 'let's just not answer her questions' but I just have to! <br>  <br>  What if (with all the time you have on your hands) you are making your baby homemade baby food with pesticides??! Hope your buying 100% organic.. Go play with or breastfeed your baby instead of trying to piss people off! And srsly, you've never gave your baby a jar of baby food?|`|uLdeIhHqaa	As FREAKIN' PYSCHO YOU ARE HOW COULD YOU EVEN BREASTFEED YOUR CHILD????|`|whROrAhFaa	OMG...careful if u breathe too much u might end up breathing in some polluted air...even in your house a car might drive by and let out some fumes that could leak in thru a weather strip and slowly poison your family with carbon monoxide or do u live in a automobile free world?  Germs could be festering in your home, since I'm to assume you never leave it as it could be harmful to your child, and I know you don't clean it because cleaning agents have chemicals in them and that could be DANGEROUS!  So basically u are no better than anyone else, huh, go figure that ;)|`|zPYyGw8oaa	What are you speaking of? I have not heard or read anything about this and even so, one brand does not affect all brands...|`|NysFTExhaa	How do you know the organic carrots and spinach you use to make your homemade baby food doesn't contain salmonella?  You could be poisoning your kids!|`|lGcpXteaaa	Thats like saying after women died from child birth...how could you even consider having children??<br>  <br>  Get a life...seriously...Go seek help....
ZZMkENyeaa	It sounds like it sweetie, I'm sorry. You just need to be sure on who you have sex with, some guys are just out to have sex.

8x0oe23aaa	aww lucky u.so he/she likes finger so try giving him/she some mini crackers.or give him/her some cheerios or any small type of cereals.|`|JDxpjT34aa	My 10 month old loves finger food. Peas are an easy one. Toast is also good, just cut it up into little squares. Gerber makes little finger foods called "Puffs", Cheerios are very easy for on the go, I bring a little baggy of Cheerios to church and when my son gets cranky the Cheerios keep him happy and quiet.|`|lrBU9C9yaa	My daughter like shredded chicken nuggets, or any kind of chicken really,gold fish, cut up strawberries, any kind of cookies, french fries, those cheese and breadstick luchables and the the cheese/meat and cracker luchables, i buy a bag of frozen veggies for $0.99 i put them in a bowl with some butter for a little flavor and heat them up in the microwave she likes the peas and carrots mostly, or veg-all in a can, we also buy fruit cocktail no sugar added sometimes you still have to cut up the pieces and pick out the grapes because they have the peel on them, If you need anymore ideas email me. Good luck|`|wRyX3A7Oaa	My boys both like the Gerber finger foods. Cereal puffs, pinwheels, and crackers.... bananas, grapes, strawberries. Be careful not to go too crazy at first and remember everything you feed him in the case he shows signs of an allergy to one...|`|y8d38Sbgaa	Hi!<br>  I use the website:<br>  <a href="http://www.babyfood101.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyfood101.com</a><br>  to help me figure out what to feed my baby.

993127072b7a2a0e8c555efdb241a674aa	Lori A (previous poster) is my bmom. i searched for her and found her 9 years ago. we had alot of trust issues at first. which i think is normal. but as time went on, we became closer and closer. as a matter of fact, if you ask anyone that knows us, we literally finish what the other is saying. <br>  <br>  she was very excited to see me. to hear my voice. to put her hands on me for the first time. the emotion was overwhelming. she was never annoyed that i found her. <br>  <br>  reunion for us was healing. very healing. i wish i could say it was always just like lori and i, but its not. i can say i personally know several that the reunion did not go well. you just never know. and you HAVE to be prepared for that. you can not start a reunion with the idea that its going to be all roses and beautiful. keep your eyes wide open to the possibilities. but hope for the best. <br>  <br>  IF you decide to search, i wish you all the luck in the world. if you dont, then i wish you peace of mind.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	I was adopted when i was very young. About a year ago i went looking for my birth parents and i found both of them. They didnt seem to excited to see me but i just wanted to see what they looked like and how they lived. They werent the most friendly people in the world. i met them at their house, that i had to fly halfway accrossed the US to get to. i was there for about 30 min and decided that i didnt want to talk to them anymore. so i got on an early flight home and i havent talk to them since. My birthmother didnt mention i had a twin sister though! Im still searching for her! its so hard to imagine ive gone almost my hole life without knowing i had an idential twin out there somewhere! I dont know if ill ever find her though? back when we were born alot of times the birth certificates were changed so we might not have the same birthday and also my birthparents said they didnt know what her new parents named her so i dont even know here name! some day i hope to find her though..|`|7JEojMgQaa	I have been in reunion with my daughter for 9 years. We are really close now, but it took time. We never expected anything from one another, just took what was available to have from one another. I am her mother but I am not her mom. That title belongs to another woman and I respect that. I even met her parents this year. Now that was awkward, but we all respected one another and we all lived through it. <br>  <br>  Reunions are full of emotions, it takes a long time to get past all the stuff that has been hidden, burried, pushed a side. Each is unique in its own way. Too much too soon can be overwhelming. Do it in small doses and give it time to settle in before you go back for more. <br>  <br>  I wish you all the best|`|JP04HX6maa	Searched. (via translated letter)<br>  <br>  Found & contacted. (was received with open arms via a letter, they were overjoyed)<br>  <br>  I'm going back for a face-to-face stay this spring.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Note: Please don't assume "open arms" is always the case. It also depends on what your adoption circumstance is, and what your biomother was told about relinquishing you and contact rights.<br>  <br>  Things can change over a long period of time - it's always better to try than to NOT try, but to be prepared for the worst. Because you truly don't know what will happen. Can you handle not being in control emotionally, or facing rejection? I'm not saying you WILL be rejected - but that it's safest to keep that possibility in mind. Can you handle thinking about that?<br>  <br>  It's called the "rollercoaster ride" for a reason. If you do decide... good luck.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Just like every adoption is different, so is every reunion. It is full of emotions, and it truly is a roller coaster ride full of them. <br>   <br>  My N Mom was very happy when I found her, but still had a lot of guilt stemming from my relinquishment. The whole experience was very traumatic to her, so I have to treat her with kid-gloves. <br>   <br>  My natural siblings are great. It was amazing to meet them, and see just how alike we are, even though we have been separated for 40 years. <br>   <br>  I recommend every adoptee search for their first family. It gives you a sense of belonging, and, in my case, made me feel like a whole person. To finally be around people who look like you, talk like you, and in my case, even think like you, is an amazing experience.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	I searched for my parents and found them more than 20 years ago.  It was a bit overwhelming at first.  At the time I found them, I didn't know anyone who had been through the experience.  Reunions weren't even featured on talk shows yet.  The internet did not exist.  I moved in with my mother two days after our first phone conversation.  It was too much too soon.  We both had too many expectations.  When I found my father about a year later, I was wiser and moved much more slowly.  Things went smoother.<br>  <br>  Take it slowly.  Don't jump in too quickly.  Get to know one another, but keep some boundaries especially at first.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope you find what you're looking for.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Yes there are a huge number of people searching, both adoptees and first parents.<br>  <br>  <br>  I found my Mom and family despite the antiquaited sealed records system and they were relieved and happy about it.  It's bought all of us much peace of mind.|`|zdWDkadraa	Not a personal expereince, but my cousins were adopted when they were 4 and 6. They searched for their birth mother when they were in their early 20's and still meet her occasionally. They said it was awkward at first but they enjoy the relationship they have now, which is more like a friend-friend relationship than a mother-daughter relationship.|`|zVZgYEjMaa	Every search (and possible reunion) is different.  <br>  <br>  I searched and found my mom nearly two years ago.  It was (and still is) a very emotional experience.  We are both overjoyed to have one another back in our lives.  We have a very close and meaningful relationship.  It has been a bit of a roller-coaster, but very positive for both of us.  <br>  <br>  I wish you well as you begin to think about these things.|`|w2NA1KuXaa	I reunited with my first mom when I was 19.  She was overjoyed when I contacted her, had been waiting for me (she was told that searching for me would disrupt my life and was unfair to me.  Yay CAS ~snort~)<br>  <br>  There were a lot of emotions running around, and I think that contributed to the ending of the reunion as a whole.  None of us knew how to handle things, and me being back in the picture brought up a lot of feelings for more than just my first mom.  If I could do it all over again, I would take it much slower.  Much much slower.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck in your journey.|`|sbHJCxWCaa	I found both my n-mom and my n-dad last June. Both of them were really excited to see me again! But navigating the reunion is difficult, I've had so many emotions about the whole thing! It was really cool, though, cause my n-dad was able to come to my wedding! <br>  <br>  I definitely reccomend that people search. It gives answers to so many of the questions that I had growing up. :)
HpWCjBv6aa	Well, it has nothing to do with him being gay, that's for sure.  Maybe that's just how he is.  I know a lot of people who are the exact same way, and hey, maybe it just works for them.  And maybe he still has a little bit of growing up to do.  There's no way to be certain.<br>  <br>  Talk to him about it and tell him it makes you uncomfortable that he's telling someone he loves them already.  However, just prepare yourself for attacks such as "If you don't like it then don't listen/pay attention/watch/etc," because that can happen.<br>  <br>  Chances are he'll realize later on down the road that you can't fall in love with someone in three hours.  While he might LOVE this boy, he is certainly not IN LOVE with him.  And I just hope he realizes that and realizes the severe difference between those two phrases.|`|YJGm8xkDaa	Umm, what if you ask how the relationship is going, what he likes about the guy, anything that he dislikes. Try not to be like "oh its only been so and so amount of days" be slow with it, and let the talk flow.
c212033303d6dee73d51f858ca54346aaa	This is just a wild "pie-in-the-sky" idea but what if you had a "One-Armed Birthday Party"?  When everybody gets there, wrap their arm in toilet paper or crepe paper, so that it's useless too.  You could probably figure out some games to play that are hard but not too hard to do one-handed.  Unwrapping presents could be a joint effort between your son and the child who is giving him the present.|`|2VwNWQiwaa	A race car theme would be cool, if he's into that sorta stuff. You could get a mini-slot car machine type thing, if that makes any sense. Set up the house in lots of decorations...and games that only require one arm.<br>  <br>  This site is great, I used it to help plan my 3 year olds party, 11 year olds party, and 13 year olds party. <br>  <a href="http://www.birthdaypartyideas.com/html/racing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.birthdaypartyideas.com/html/r...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.birthdaypartyideas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.birthdaypartyideas.com/</a>

apUkTo3maa	WRONG SECTION
SEzIkGNiaa	Do you know how to bake? You could bake something simple like muffins or cookies and have her mix or decorate the cookies/muffins/cupcakes. To make things easier you could pick up some mix at the grocery store.<br>  <br>  Arts and Crats: You can buy some neat things at the dollar store.<br>  <br>  Play Doh<br>  <br>  Coloring: Print out some coloring sheets (superheros, barbie, disney ect..)<br>  <br>  Watch Movies: Bring/rent a mmovie that they havent seen or that they love and eat popcorn!<br>  <br>  Play outside/Go for a walk/Go to the Park|`|dShnJ20raa	Puppets, homemade coloring sheets, playdoh, ask mom if you can make a simple sugar cookie, read, pretty well anything you can imagine. I babysat for a couple little girls last week and we made purses out of foam and felt. Next week we are making puppets out of soap bottles. We are also making special door hangings with each of their names.|`|5No3OWhyaa	you  can see some funny movies. play games like musical chairs, board games, computer games, PSP, Nintendo DS, X box 360 if they have one. listen to music and dance. have a singing competition. have lotssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss of fun,
dR4QN0gHaa	I would be furious. You shouldn't force anyone to ingest your own bodily fluids. I personally wouldn't drink breast milk and my husband doesn't either .....but if you are into that...whatever floats your boat. But you should never give it to anyone without their permission. What does she want to do with it after your baby is weaned? If she wants the household to use it I would say she needs help.|`|7rCeCVl2aa	Wow. That was rude of her. I can't imagine what my husband would do if I dropped that bomb on him...<br>  <br>  Suggestion: Prepare your own food from now on. You'll know what is in it.<br>  <br>  <br>  **Edit** I can't believe that there is so many thumbs down. Do people actually think that this is okay???|`|68c6B8dRaa	Srsly...?<br>  <br>  Yeah, she's kind of lost it. There's nothing wrong with having human milk on your porridge if you like it and it is arguably less gross to drink something from your wife than something from some random cow, but tinkering with somebody else's food without their permission is just not on.<br>  <br>  I don't know what kind of 'help' is called for, though. Is she maybe a bit isolated...?|`|WgIZUcYfaa	Maybe take her to a lactation consultant to talk to an EXPERT about the USES of breast milk.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry but that's gross. Mothers milk is for baby only...and it IS strange when I see two to three year olds still breast feeding. I mean really...you need to stop sometime. I'd have a serious discussion with your wife about the way she is acting. Don't attack her...understand where she is comming from but voice your own opinion.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	Ask her how she would feel if you put some semen in HER oatmeal?  <br>  <br>  The point is, it's a bodily fluid.  She really crossed the line by giving it to you unawares.  It's a breech of trust.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  You people who are giving thumbs down are scary...you actually think it's OKAY what his wife did?  Freaky...|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yea she has lost it, she needs to talk to a therapist or something, and make your own food from now on, tell her you think she is sick and if i were you i would tell her she needs to knock off her crap because you have had enough of it|`|rAkWoweOaa	That is way out there. Maybe you can get counseling? I don't really know what to tell you. Yuck!|`|gdlc9Jg4aa	Ok it's kinda funny, sorry but it is. My husband has tried my breast milk just for fun..shhhh, Lol. But he would never want it in oatmeal, in fact he would never want it again! And I would never put it in his oatmeal either. There is something wrong here, its not "normal" that she did that. You have every right to feel how you do! You need to talk to her! Good Luck!|`|EcdelIHtaa	wow are u serious she has lost it then<br>  the milk she produces is for the baby not for you guys ..<br>  and yes of course her supply is going to stop wen ur baby is old enough..<br>  so probably just wait till she stops pumping her "liquid gold" its going to happen eventually... and even if u try to get her help she might not want it because she thinks shes doing a good and right thing|`|GJEFaaTWaa	That's really rude. I would be mad if she did that to me. It won't hurt you of course, but still. I would tell her not to make decisions concerning you without talking to you about it. How old does she want to feed your baby until? Her milk shouldn't dry up unless the baby self weans.|`|AA12193113	Wow!?!?! I don't even let my husband in that area because I'm afraid he will get alittle in his mouth.  I don't think what she did was right.  It's great that she is breastfeeding, but come on!  I would be angry too. <br>  Just try to express your feeling to her calmly, hopefully she will get the point.|`|KRo3Ik3Baa	Tell her you are going to solicit all your friends and family's opinion on what she did because it seems weird to you and you need some advice.  Hopefully that will curb some of her enthusiasm.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	I'd say that is a little overboard.  You didn't say how old your baby is.  If your baby is still really young (under 3 months) your wife's hormones may still be a little unstable.  I remember pumping a lot and putting bags of frozen milk in the freezer for the first 3 months.  I was actually glad I did, because we used them when I went back to work.<br>  You need to talk to your wife.  She will still be a little hormonal, so be careful what you say.  Do NOT say anything negative about breastfeeding.  Tell her that you support the breastfeeding, but only for the baby.  Tell her you are fine with her pumping, and that she can put the milk in the freezer for the baby, but not for adult consumption.  That way she doesn't have to worry if her supply gets low later, because she can pull the milk out of the freezer.  It lasts 3 months in a freezer.  Try to redirect her milk frenzy in a positive way, instead of just getting mad.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Could be worse, she could have put breast milk from an ANIMAL in your oatmeal. Yuck. Oh wait. That would be cow's milk, wouldn't it?<br>  Some men do like drinking breast milk from the source....<br>  Easy solution. Tell her not to put her breast milk in your food again and make your own food.<br>  Note: if breastmilk is good enough for your kid, why's it not good enough for you?<br>  And in these tough economic times, you should be thanking your wife for thinking outside the square and finding creative ways to save money on groceries. Using her breast milk instead of buying cow's milk makes financial sense.....<br>  Plus, being her husband and all, haven't you had her "bodily fluids" in your mouth before? Ie her saliva when kissing her.....?|`|dpMssGdnaa	Omg I would never do that to my husband if she doesnt want to stop her milk supply she should put the baby often and if she wants to have milk forever she can donate it to hospitals. But never force somebody else to drink it!  If your baby doesnt want it later then why would she want to keep having it! She most stop at some point.  give her some distraction send her out with friends get her out of house and she'll stop doing this weird stuff|`|tqA9kxeqaa	As a mother of 3 breastfed children, I would NEVER do this to my husband, even if it was to make a point.<br>  I dont know what she is thinking.  I dont think she's mental, but something is wrong that she is doing that.<br>  <br>  I mean, seriously.  That is NOT right|`|B27oNdbNaa	She needs help.<br>  That milk is for the baby!|`|I9BbQ5Qmaa	i put my milk in my boyfriends coffee for a laugh, he saw the funny, lighten up|`|TjwKYY5gaa	shes just got the mama bug....the joy of breastfeeding and all that jazz. all mamas get it, and it leaves them all eventualy. but it is a gift to be able to provide milk for your baby yourself, and it help the mama connect emotionally with her baby...as for putting it in your oatmeal? hmmmm...just ask her to be more considerate of your feelings...and you aren't disgusted with your wife, you are disgusted with her actions. you love her, and you should try to love everything about her....even her liquid gold. try to see it from her side. <br>  but that is seriously nasty....make your own food buddy!<br>  i hope this helps!
55aba19c6c9d9f4e98e2303268e9a73faa	First of all~ Sorry the condom failed. That sucks. But, good on ya for deciding to face your actions. And I guess congratulations! Babies are happy things, even if you are "too young".<br>  <br>  There is no easy way to tell your mom. I don't know if I'd do the letter thing--at least not with my parents, but then again thats my parents, not yours. Hell, even though I'm 23 and married, I still don't think my parents would be very happy if I told them I was pregnant. But anyway.<br>  <br>  Sit your mom down, and just tell her. Don't be surprised if she's angry and dissappointed, but just let her get it out of her system. Make sure <br>  to tell her what you've told us on here.<br>  <br>  But before you do--do some research on assistant programs for young unwed mothers. I know that most county's have assistant programs where they pretty much help pay for the pre-natal care and birth of the baby. Look up daycare options--does your school have a daycare for teen parents? (Mine did, but it was pretty unusual so...yeah.)<br>  <br>  Having some prepared material about how you plan to have the baby<br>  cared for while you are in school, as well as how to ease the financial burden that the medical costs will have, may help to ease the blow. It will show her that you're not just saying that you're willing to take responsibility, it will show her you mean it.<br>  <br>  All that said, good luck hun. I hope everything works out for you, the baby, and your boyfriend. ^_^|`|fthMBqy2aa	My parents were 17 and my mom has worked with a lot of pregnant teens in her job. There is no "easy" way to tell your mother and there will probably be some anger and some crying/yelling. The best thing to do is just tell her straight out, preferably with her sitting down. Hopefully, you can all figure out a plan for the baby and school. I suggest calling your county public health department to see if there are any services or programs for which you are eligible. Good luck.|`|1ikl5q97aa	The letter thing sounds like a good idea . Or maybe if you still have the pregnancy test , leave that with the letter to just so she doesn't think you are lying .

It is extremely hard work though, you will need support from your mum and family. Allow her the time to vent her feelings as it will be a shock to her and hopefully when she gets her head around it she will support you and your boyfriend!!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|wnkoTEqVaa	get her a gilf t shirt|`|QfYGhtVwaa	You need to tell her urgently, especially as you expect to complete school and go to college - it sounds like you are assumming that she will care for your baby as you carry on with your education. What if she says no?.<br>  <br>  'Mum, sit down I have to tell you something...' at which point she will guess and the air will turn blue, let her freak out for a bit, lecture you and cry (she can't be blamed for this!). Then deliver the I want to keep it bombshell and hope for the reaction you need.<br>  <br>  Grim, but I am sure I would have chosen to keep the baby if this happened to me at 15 also.|`|5tqh0akYaa	Well thank you for being responsible!

I had a baby at 14. I know exactly where you stand. Its hard. Its going to continue to get harder. Have faith and be strong and dont let anybody talk to down. I live with my dad so i had to tell him. My boyfriend was 17 at the time. I told my dad i needed to talk to him. He got a weary look in his eyes. And there is NO easy way to say it. I promise you. I said Dad im pregnant. He said to stop fooling around. I started to cry and told him it was an honest mistake. I never meant for it to happen. Im ashamed and im embarrased. He yelled at me for a while, all i did was cry. He finally came up and just held me and told me whatever it takes were going to do it. He tried to talk me into abortion. I refused. Im against it 100% He is ashamed of me. Still. My dad is the kind of parent that thinks his daughter is perfect.  Hes stubborn and wants kids that others can look up to. It was hard. Good luck.|`|pF3z9l5uaa	Find her when she is in a good mood. Say, "Mom, there is something really important that I need to tell you and it cannot wait." Sit down with her and take a deep breath then say, "I took a pregnancy test and it showed positive. I know I made a mistake and I know that I'm eventually going to have to pay for it. So-and-so and I have talked this over and we have agreed that we want to keep the baby. I know you're angry, but I really need your help right now and I'm going to need your help a lot." <br>  It'll be awkward, but this is the easiest way to do it.

nHXXh9Q0aa	Is their reasoning for a c-section just because the ultrasound is showing that she's measuring big?<br>  <br>  I delivered a healthy 9lb 10oz baby nautrally just fine.  I wouldn't opt for a c-section if I were you!  That's major abdomindal surgery!   Ask if you are favorable for an induction instead.<br>  <br>  From what I've heard, c-sections can be scheduled ASAP.  So it just depends on the hospital's OR availability.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	My doctor said my baby would be well over 9lbs and he was 8lbs when born..and I had him vaginally. Your doctor shouldn't make you have csection because ultrasounds to determine weight aren't 100% accurate.
0bb8d8b440881763ab137e16962e21d3aa	During a c-section you go into a room where they put in an IV in and prep u for the c-section. Then u are wheeled into surgery where they give you your spinal block- it hurts a bit, but numbs you fast. After that, time flies! After they make sur u are numb, the baby is born in the first few minutes. They bring ur baby to you for a few minutes to give kisses, and see him/her. After that, baby is wheeled away while they finish up with you. They do take out the placenta and even suck up some of the extra blood/fluid. I didn't even bleed for a day after my c-section. After you are done being sewn up (whole process of surgery is about 30 min) you are wheeled away to recovery. I didn't feel any pain that first day b/c you still have some meds from the spinal block. The next day, you are Very sore. But it does get better, more slowly than a vaginal birth though. As for the weight. I think it is about the same, it might be a little harder to lose it though since you are recovering from major surgery. Nursing is the best weight loss program you can have!|`|XRLbqtUbaa	It's surgery.<br>  <br>  They prep u...shave a little where they will make the incision...u get a spinal...they lay u down, give u some oxygen, strap your arms down, and start opening u up...30 minutes later after a little pressure and tugging, the baby is out, I got to see him and kiss him...they take everything out...close u up and send u to recovery.  I stayed there for about 45 min to an hour until I started to get the feeling back in my legs.  After I got into my room, they brought the baby to me|`|494a7a701dcb960d4740e929d5b8b41daa	I had a c-section 14 months ago.  They took the placenta out when they took out my son.  <br>  Yo will not be able to eat 12 hrs prior to the surgery.  It takes 20 mins to get the baby out and a half and hr to switch your body up.<br>  I healed really quickly, but my sister and my cousin took a long time.<br>  I had no problem getting my weight off but you do have to wait longer until you can exercise.|`|yOy5OpqFaa	When I had my csection they shaved my stomach and down there. I got a spinal in the OR and then got a catheter put in and they asked me if I could feel anything they were poking my leg and stomach with some thing but I didn't feel it. Then they put those little oxygen things on me. They delivered my son and they take the placenta out and then stitch you up. I don't think it's harder to loose weight I went back to my normal size but after I had my first (I had a vaginal delivery) I was a bit smaller afterwards and with my son I was small but not like I was before. Good luck I am also having a scheduled c section|`|kmIcAySEaa	Hello, I had two sections, one with each child. It is not bad, but of course you figure out what to do diferntly the secong go around though. When are you due ? What is the reason for the possible section ? One thing for sure is ask for the catheter to be put in after your epidural. They do remove the placenta & most of the blood, clots etc. The 1st one was awful I had no idea what to expect, when I had my daughter 6 yrs later I was ready. With her I was ready to come home on the second day, not hardly any pain, not taking any pain meds. You will be somewhat sore for a few weeks, but you will be over it in no time. I also asked my Dr. if my husband could cut the cord, barring nothing is wrong with baby. (he did) There is nothing to worry about, thank goodness medicine has come so far.|`|WD6g1OuMaa	They will take out the baby and placenta during the c-section.  You don't have to deliver that afterwards.  I'm not too sure about the weight thing because I gained 80 lbs with baby #1 and my only complaint about the c-section is that I still have a small kangaroo pouch above my scar.  Not sure if that has to do with gaining so much weight.  On the bright side...I lost 100 lbs during the first year after my baby was born.  Good luck and don't worry, everything will go fine!
Q6YboW9Daa	I felt flutters at 16 weeks, and kicks at about 18 weeks.  They got much more frequent at 20 weeks and are now extremely noticeable at 22 weeks.

fYEp45mAaa	If you didn't use protection you very well could be.  You are more susceptible to becoming pregnant just after you have a baby.  I would go to a doctor.  Or it could just be your regular period starting up again.|`|XRbHcGuLaa	First of all most doctors will tell any woman to wait 6 weeks to have sex again after the delivery of a baby.  Because you did not wait, you probably bled some more from healing, etc.  You should talk to your doctor or at least take a pregnancy test and get on some birth control!!

VjmVuPZuaa	This is tough to generalize as – everyone is different; their emotional, psychological and physical needs all heal and grow at differing rates – especially after such an incredible emotional rollercoaster such as birthing ( This is for men and women) Although you are asking about whether the vagina will change and it 'seems' to be just a physical thing - there is so much more wrapped up with this part of the body that you can't separate the other senses. <br>  <br>  However - to answer it straight - yes it does change -even if you have a c section - though birthing naturally will obviously ensure your vagina undergoes some dramatic shape changes  – but it can be for the better.  The physical facts are that your vagina will change in shape and firmness - this can be remedied and supported - through the pelvic floor ex - and look up Ben Wa balls - inserted for short periods to strengthen those muscles.( ensure you source surgical standard stainless steel ones)<br>  <br>  You didn't mention if you were already having sex - or if it were painful - suffice to say the physical and the emotional issues around resuming sex after birth are hard to separate – I can’t stress the importance of  some good pelvic floor exercises and/ or the Ben Wa balls<br>  <br>  The emotional facts are a bit hazier - your role has changed from lover to mother and many women find it hard to accept that they can be both. You need to reconnect with yourself as a sensual being before exploring another’s body and fully enjoying sex like you used to<br>  <br>  Partners in the relationship dictate the boundaries and expectations of your sex life –  and yes – the exhaustion – both physically, mentally and emotionally may cause some tension on your usual good nature/ playfulness and libido. <br>  <br>  It all stems on your birth experience and the damage ( physically and mentally) that you have endured and the meanings you place upon those experiences in relation to sex.<br>  <br>  It wasn't clear from your question if you are still pregnant  or not – bit if so great! You have time now to talk about expectations, fears and be equipped with a solid understanding of where each person is coming from.  Sort all of this out before the incredible journey as a new parent takes hold. My advice is to keep an open and honest communication link with your partner and take things slowly – with little pressure – and connect again with yourself as a sensual being, before attempting to touch another.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest anyone interested to go to <a href="http://reclaimsexafterbirth.com" rel="nofollow">http://reclaimsexafterbirth.com</a>  as there are free articles and lots of free info specially in this area.<br>  <br>  Reclaiming your sexuality can be a wonderful adventure – so don’t treat it as a chore or something that you just gotta do – enjoy the journey!<br>  <br>  <br>  What alot of people don't realize is that they are craving affection and sensuality rather than the actual physical act of sex. There are many ways of showing your affection, maintaining the connection with your partner and having sexual contact with your partner, without having penetrative vaginal sex. Physical affection includes hugging and cuddling, holding hands, kissing - and ensuring that we tell our partners that we love them. Communicating your needs and encouraging your partner to communicate his are also important. Explore alternatives to vaginal sex while you allow your body to rest, heal and recover from birth (it takes up to and sometimes longer than 12 months for the a woman's body to fully recover from birth).|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	It took about 4 weeks for me.

puCOYwMmaa	Yes you can.  Wear gloves when you clean the litterbox and scoop the poop out of the box daily wash your hands after you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  The risk is form a parasite called toxoplasmosis which can harm the fetus.  However, it's VERY RARE, especially if your cat is an indoor cat.  They get it from eating infected bird carcasses.  Your doctor can do a blood test to see if you've been exposed to it, if you have you'll have some resistance built up against it.  You can also get your get tested at the vet.<br>  <br>  Toxoplasmosis comes out in the cat's poop but isn't contagious in the first 24 hours after it comes out.  Which is why I suggested scooping the poop daily.  If the cat's litterbox is in your room you're probably scooping pretty often anyway otherwise it'll smell!!)|`|hw3OMoeZaa	I would move her in a nother room and really try not to get her on you for a while, they say it's not safe but I wouldnt chance it.

The chances of you getting the infection toxoplasmosis from it are rather slim. The only thing is, if you do get it, it is very dangerous since it can infect the placenta and the baby. It's just one of those things that aren't likely to happen, but you don't want to take the chance and become another number for them to add to the ratios.|`|b3eqhjRraa	You can have it in your room.

Depending on if ur overweight or under weight, u may feel the baby moving before or after 20 weeks. Good Luck!! Congrats on the pregnancy!!|`|QYYWBrG7aa	i didn`t feel my lil man kick until i was 20w5d now at 28 weeks he is always moving >:}
rdpZrBc9aa	Quit stressing about boyfriends.  You have PLENTY of time.  Concentrate on your studies and your future career.  Find activities or groups that you enjoy and you will meet guys who also enjoy the same things.  That will give you something in common.<br>  <br>  Jealousy is NOT a sign of love.  It's a sign of wanting to control.  Forget this guy or you could end up in the headlines one day.  <br>  <br>  This "man" is seven years older than you.  What's wrong with him that he is interested in someone your age?  Not that you're not a wonderful person and all that, but you really don't have much in common.  He was a senior in high school when you were a fifth grader.  You don't really have a lot of adult experiences yet.  That fits in with the jealousy/control pattern, because he's looking for someone to dominate.  It concerns me that he has another girlfriend but doesn't want YOU to have another boyfriend.  Big warning flag here.<br>  <br>  When you are twenty-eight, a thirty-five-year-old man might be a reasonable option, because you'll have a lot more in common then.  (I keep harping on this because it's important.)  You don't need to be joined at the hip, but you do need to enjoy things together.<br>  <br>  Remember it's possible to date without being committed, as long as both of you have the same understanding.  <br>  <br>  You really need to talk to your parents about this guy and maybe show them this posting.  He is a potential danger to you and them and maybe your future boyfriend, whoever that might be.<br>  <br>  Keep your virginity until you're married.  You don't have to worry about pregnancy or STDs that way, and you won't have to worry about being seen as a ****.|`|kVBDpAMTaa	If he really cares about you he will try to get you back. <br>  You shouldn't try to mess up his new relationship just because you want him back, if he really loves you and you already told you that you want him back, he will make that decision on his own.<br>  Don't stay stuck on one guy, there are many, many men out there that could be just as perfect.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Just stay away. If he's only with that chick cause she's hot and gives it up. Then he's pretty jerk-like if you ask me. Date someone else and move on. You'll see how lame HE is when you give someone else a chance.|`|CT8pwhM5aa	Girl, he is just not that into you. Find someone better!
5N3odm3Qaa	Yes, ABSOLUTELY.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with abortion and your girlfriend will not suffer any ill-effects to her health or reproductive ability. That said, you two need to use condoms and birth control 100% of the time. It only takes one slip-up to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Contact Planned Parenthood by finding your local office here: plannedparenthood.com. Since she is only 13, she will need a parent's consent. This can get tricky but there is no way around it. It will also cost about $450 so you will probably need a parent to foot this bill. But trust me, it's MUCH cheaper to ask a parent and deal with that than have a baby and raise it. The cost of a delivery without so much as oxygen or an epidural can be well over $3000. So get that abortion ASAP.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	this is her choice and yours. if you both feel you cannot take care of a child, then you can either choose abortion or adoption. either way, your parents need to be informed and you both must go to a clinic and talk to a counselor who can help. <br>  <br>  why did you have sex at this age? sex is for adults, not children.|`|tc0gU2o0aa	Dear Christopher. <br>  <br>  You ask this question in the pain of secrecy. <br>  <br>  But, let me give you my opinion. People say your life will never be the same after you have a baby. This is very true, because you will not be able to keep it secret. But neither will it be the same after you have an abortion. This is also very true. The secrecy will be terrible to bear. You will be united with your girlfriend only in this terrible secrecy. <br>  <br>  Now, can I ask you to put this problem behind you for a second. For an instant pretend this never happened. What is your honest opinion of the job description of an abortionist? <br>  <br>  His job is to end a human life as quickly, as secretly and painlessly as possible, for a profit. I think this is the description of an assasin dear Christopher, don′t you? It is a silent and tearing guilt you will feel after this.  <br>  <br>  Defend your girlfriend now. Hold her tight. Never think you′re alone in this. Help is there. The worst part is being overburdened in your secrecy. You must speak to somebody. A professional. You must get help. Help will flood in like a bursting river. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pregnancycenters.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pregnancycenters.org/</a><br>  or, you can call any local hotline.<br>  <br>  God bless, dear friend.|`|PEGWnd5kaa	Everyone says it and it is true - having a child will change your lives forever. <br>  <br>  Here are some basic resources for you:<br>  <br>  If you need free counseling while you are making your decision (they respect your decision whatever it is): www.yourbackline.org<br>  <br>  There is funding available - either through donations to clinics or low (or no) interest loans for a clinical abortion.  For funding information in the USA: www.nnaf.org/help.html<br>  <br>  If you are underage in the United States and are looking at self-induced abortion because of fear of parental notification – there are organizations set up to assist you. Contact your local National Organization of Women chapter www.now.org or your local Unitarian Church minister www.uua.org and ask about Operation Overground - a service to help transport and provide accomodation for women who must travel across states to obtain clinical abortion services. When you travel to another state without parental notification laws - you do not need to obtain permission or notification.<br>  <br>  And finally, for counseling after abortion: www.4exhale.org|`|DuqAsQyqaa	No, <br>  Do you know how they do an abortion do you think she takes a pill and bam its gone?<br>  WRONG they put her to sleep they rip the baby limb by limb they takes its hands and feet and rip therm apart and it has a heart and toes and everything! and they kill it.<br>  Grow UP!<br>  Give the baby to someone who doesn't have a child and wants one ADOPTION!|`|xzt6JE34aa	dude wtf? this is worst than that 13 year old father.<br>  No seriously, you kids need to start to open your freakin eyes.<br>  <br>  I'll see you on the news if you guys decide to keep the baby.|`|heMWDrLnaa	DON'T DO IT !! you will regret it.<br>  <br>  except... she's 13 so I don't know.
NWv9hOFYaa	I am in the same boat. I even worry about global warming for my children!|`|T1hZG4O3aa	You have to ask yourself how the companies you and your husband work for are doing. If you have job security. I know for a fact that my husband will not be losing his job, so we continued to TTC and finally succeeded. You need to evaluate what you company is handling. If it is struggling to stay afloat or if they are ok. My husband works for one of the few casinos in Las Vegas that is doing well right now and lucky for him the casino would have to shut down if they let people in his department go. They can work him to the bone because he is salary and damn near get away with it. We still worry at times but you have to take a step back and think about if your job will be there while you are having this child or will you be unemployed within a year. I know its tough to think about but you have to think about your company and not everyone else and their companies. Some companies affect one another and some just dont.  I am not worrying about having a baby in a chaotic time because the entire world will never be at peace and there will always be something to worry about, that is just the way or the world. You have to learn to make the world around you better for you and yours.|`|fHJcGAyTaa	Our grandparants and parents were faced with the same delemmas and they managed.  I read the other day that theres never a right time to have a child, the stars are never going to align just perfectly, ever.

People always have.|`|a19e78a9bb9de477a5b7313049dd2c65aa	there is never a right time to have a child.. given climate change, financial crisis and economic downturns.

GL|`|MBI4wp4faa	just listen to your heart and pray to GOD that you dont lose your job .<br>  but it is around 40,000 dollars a year on average to have a baby soo i hope you get lot of diapers and support but they get cheaper lol until they turn like 11 lol im 14 i would know haha good luck!|`|dN5BJeVpaa	I know just how you feel. <br>  When I conceived I didn't think the economy would go further and further into distress. <br>  I'm so thankful that my family is well off - but I can't help but worry what could happen in the next 5, 10,  20 years.<br>  I'm so worried about the standard of life my kids will have to become accustom to. I mean, what a horror that would be if we couldn't even give our kids the things we were brought up having.<br>  I don't want them thinking that college or owning a house is something that only the wealthy can achieve.|`|9BeGtZAiaa	If people stop having kids because of these worries, then the human race would have died out. Just think that you can  bring a bigger and better generation into the world. Have the baby, raise it right and maybe the next generation won't be as stupid as this 'me' generation.

It works.|`|m2aznd8xaa	those words shouldn't even be said around the kids. where is he learning this from .he don't even know what they mean to even get disiplined for it. he is only saying is because that is how other people in your home are expressing themselves. teach everyone else to choose there words wisely. and teach the little one other ways to express himself. like he can tell his sis she is being a meanie etc.and if  he is getting it from  the older kids start a cuss jar . everytime you hear the word said they get allowances taken away or they gotta give you a certain amount from there allowance. if they aint getting money then give them chores like scrubbing the toilet etc. fill the jar with chores or make them pay for there potty mouths. this should control the amount of swearing.   good luck. its not the little ones fault  that he is learning this.  and if the kids are using money tell the little one if you dont say those words by the end of the week well use the cuss jar money to take you somewhere or buy you something. use lots of positive reinforcement  good luck to you|`|AFi5kTiEaa	Kids repeat what they hear so, who ever is saying these words in front of him needs to stop.

Just say  thats not nice to say, please dont use those words, calmly.  dont make a huge deal out of it or he will keep saying them.

I'm not joking. everyime he calles his siblings something bad wash his mouth out with soap. after he really gets that you will wash his mouth out, threaten him and if he doesnt stop, actually wash his mouth out. eventually he will get it. the thing is, the only way a THREE YEAR OLD  would know those words is if you use them, our your other children/his friends use them. get everyone to stop useing them. because you guys used them, he thought it was okay.|`|6cfd63cafa933ed1ff4e8a89356d077eaa	My child would bite her big sister when she was 2.

She was so embarrassed she never used it again (in front of her parents). A 3 year old wouldn't understand. What we do when our son calls us stupid is tell him "That's a put down. You hurt my feelings when you do that." Then we make him apologise. It's worked for us. You might want to also use consequences - loss of TV time, certain toys, etc.|`|dLLDwZaraa	Someone's teaching him those words......which is WAY wrong.<br>  <br>  Time out.
DRb4Qlypaa	Well the only way to kill (terminate) a pregnancy is an abortion. If there is not a pregnancy yet (if you JUST had sex under 4 or 5 days ago) then she needs to take a Plan B pill, which she can go to the doctor and he will prescribe or if she is 18 she can buy it at the pharmacy. <br>  I seriously recommend that if she is not pregnant then you need to stop having sex until you know enough about sex not to ask a silly question like this.<br>  penis+vagina=good chance of baby|`|eu6UQElYaa	She could throw herself down a flight of stairs.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	IF she is already pregnant, the only way to "terminate" the pregnancy without KILLING the baby, is to wait it out for 9 months and give it up for adoption.

The earliest women can know if they are pregnant is three weeks,and that is by getting a blood test done from her doctor.  <br>  <br>  BTW,no matter how early you "terminate" a pregnancy,if It's done voluntary,it's still considered abortion,no matter how you candy-coat it.|`|2LsPtnebaa	One week into pregnancy? Unlikely that she could already know that.<br>  <br>  If she is, anything that you could do that does not involve a medical procedure would be dangerous and irresponsible. Tell her to wait a few weeks and take a pregnancy test. If she is indeed pregnant, make an appointment with a doctor to discuss your options.<br>  <br>  Please don't do something stupid.|`|JlxSw7Hzaa	first of all you shouldnt be having unprotected or pretected sex if you cant deal with the responsibilities of your actions. if she is pregnant killing her child isnt going to make things better . it will emotionally scar her for life. first she needs to find out if she is pregnant and then deal with the situation in a mature manner|`|LhvKTYftaa	" i am trying to avoid an abortion so can you please help her and i"<br>  <br>  Right............<br>  <br>  "some ways to terminate the pregnancy" = ABORTION<br>  <br>  idiot.........|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Well first find out if she is pregnant or not. If she is, she should go to the doctor and get checked out. If you want to have an abortion that is something you will need to talk to your gf about. Don't pressure her into it, if she wants to keep the baby. also. don't even think about trying to terminate the baby on your own. Its stupid, irresponsible, and selfish. You could seriously hurt your gf if you try anything on her to kill the baby. don't do it.|`|h5cFkP35aa	She should stand in front of a semi truck.|`|NNdjVI17aa	CLEARLY IF YALL MADE THE BED LAY IN IT|`|V8wUAVdyaa	why don't you just kill her?  its murder either way..
7aVPODR8aa	If you have irregular periods then it's hard to tell just from that. In two weeks if you still feel pregnant go to the doctor and request a blood test. If that is negative then you are not, sorry.|`|PcJG3lrDaa	IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE YOU NEED HELP AND U COULD BE PREGNANT? WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?
Xrwvu5Uraa	it's not low. the babys heartbeat should be anywhere from 120-170. lower heartbeats are "said" to be boys, but you won't know for sure for a couple weeks. good luck.|`|eu6UQElYaa	It's not low, it's fine.  You're looking for anything between 120bpm and 160bpm, although my babies have on occasion gotten up to 180bpm without it being a concern at all.  So your baby is basically right smack in the middle of where it should be.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	That isn't too low..anywhere between 110-170 is normal.|`|DNygQdmVaa	If your doctor didn seem concerned I wouldn worry about it|`|jNqf8HtDaa	no that is normal so dont worry if it wasnt they would have told you something about it|`|01vMpHkWaa	my baby was 156 at 10 weeks and now he is 136 at 38 weeks<br>  <br>  babies range differently...its normal|`|zuZKj3xXaa	im 39 weeks, and her heart rate is 143... the doctor said thats perfect...<br>  so........... yeah, theres nothing most definitely  wrong :(<br>  <br>  The doctor should have brought that to attention...<br>  <br>  they might have gotten the rumbling of the Placenta going.. it always goes a little slower :) Some doctors are Dumb as Dirt. :)|`|qgJLZPDJaa	whatd the doc say? i know plenty of people who were in their 140's around that time :) <br>  i was 170.<br>  as long as the doc says youre okay, youre okay.<br>  <br>  maybe the wive tale applies to you and its a boy :)|`|PYafv6gSaa	it sounds low but i think as long as its over 100 its fine but it will gradually slow down|`|h5cFkP35aa	Nah, it's normal. And if the stories are true that means you're having a boy.|`|PJLpvZQRaa	nope normal! no need to stress, bu old wives tales would say you are having a boy!|`|w9jx0JYLaa	nope, and it sounds like it may be a boy!
OQFd3pl5aa	I am not sure of an exact time length, or if there even is one. Chlamydia can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease which then can cause scarring of the fallopian tubes, making it difficult or impossible to become pregnant. I would guess if you caught it fairly soon and had it treated within a few wks of having it, then it should be ok. I would definitely get your Dr's opinion on this and see how long she says it can linger with out causing infertility. Good luck to you :)|`|Jmy6kA1Xaa	23 minutes.  <br>  <br>  You better hurry up!
Ojgqd4xNaa	My little girl was always on my right side.  I think they either get stuck in a certain position or get comfortable there.  Try getting on all fours, and arching your back!  If you can, I as still pretty mobile through out my pregnancy.  It might help move her!  You can also lift the arm on the side that she is pushing your ribs on, and reaching over bending your side kinda.  That also helped me.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Yes.  The closer you get to your delivery the less room they have to move around, so they tend to stick in one position.|`|AuVtUjVAaa	I had the exact same thing happen to me. My son always stayed on my right side, always kicking me in my ribs. So it is normal for this to happen. As you get closer to your due date, they tend to run out of room, It should ease up a bit once your baby drops into your pelvis. Congrats and Good Luck|`|TlFnIei0aa	Yes, my baby didn't turn to her propper position til my contractions started, before that she was on my left side.
457db30f68586ffe5e0ebc94a4dba769aa	My daughter turned 5 in September, and we've been making the rounds of 5 year old birthday parties lately.<br>  <br>  I agree with the Hannah Montana suggestions.  lol.  The only problem is that you don't know if its something the girl already has.<br>  <br>  For my daughter's birthday, she received a lot of neat craft items, and she LOVED them.  A lot of the craft items were purchased at our local Learning Express store.  If you have a Learning Express or a similar store in your area, I'd recommend taking a look.  <br>  <br>  Here's their website, so you can see the kind of stuff they carry:  <br>  <a href="http://www.learningexpress.com/info/educationaltoys.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.learningexpress.com/info/educ...</a>|`|AA10325228	hannah montanta stuff<br>   baby dolls<br>   barbies<br>   bratz<br>   littlest pet shop<br>   polly pockets<br>   stuffed animals|`|m2aznd8xaa	they are into crafts of all kinds. beading ,painting jewelry boxes. go to toys r us they have a nice section on lots of girly crafts.|`|XD42367paa	I love toys that are educational and unusual. I've given butterfly kits where a kid can hatch her own butterflies and release them. I've given hummingbird feeders and regular bird feeders with posters of area birds to hang in their rooms. I've given unusual kites and if the child is close to me (like a nephew or my own child) an offer to go out and fly it with them. <br>  <br>  I like to give seeds they can plant and watch grow, or dress up clothes or toys that spark their imagination. What about a child's tent or a bug catcher? Target has in the past had some really neat kids boots and shovels and garden tools that all go together for girls and boys. They'd probably be putting them out about now. <br>  <br>  What about the faces you can buy to put on trees? <br>  Oooohhh I wish I had a five year old to buy for! <br>  <br>  If you want something a bit more traditional, tea sets have always been a hit with my kids' friends.|`|RogGmYUCaa	My sister is that age and she likes <br>  <br>  Dora the Explorer<br>  anything Hannah Montana<br>  Barbies<br>  Spongebob Squarepants<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you!|`|4RxE1Ad6aa	anything hannah montana i believe|`|fDGJDkOxaa	A friend of mine has a five year old and she loves anything princess related.|`|H2l7tFFHaa	Hannah montana and Dora!
Bw1h5xAcaa	Your tubes would have ruptured long before now - they would rupture at the 7-8 week point at the very latest. And it would have been severe, unrelenting pain.<br>  <br>  It's possible you have an infection from some retained pieces of the miscarriage - did you have a D&C after the miscarriage? You might need one. Please call your doctor.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Go to the doctor and tell them all this! GOOD LUCK!|`|04833260a508ecf8d2a4938012444526aa	Maybe you didn't pass everything.Go back to the doctor.When I had a miscarriage I went back several times for them to check my hcg levels.They want to know they are back to normal.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Go see the doctor.  NOW.|`|17cd02c243ad95cd0a7ac5eee0305905aa	It was almost a month ago. Your tubes would have ruptured a while ago. You may still have tissue of the baby inside you which can cause pain. Go to the doctor.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	if your tubes ruptured you would be in soo much pain you wouldn't move and you would want to go start to the hospital you would also be bleeding uncontrollably and that sounds like what i went through when i miscarried they said i was hurting so bad because my right ovary is really far away from my uterus causing my tube to be very narrow and i just have a hard time passing the egg through it.|`|2WWEn2mZaa	I had a miscarriage and even under a doctor's care I had a SEVERE infection. I could not stand at all the pain was indescribable. It hurt from my uterus up into my lungs. See your doctor immediately!
fec699811ba6e1b0d043374af7afd151aa	That may be a sign of pregnancy....try a hpt in about another week or so...I f you can wait that long then go to the doctor for a blood test.
wEEOvu5Waa	Wait a while and take another one. Mine was negative but a week later it was positive.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	well you should wait until its closer for your period to be due and go to your doctor.<br>  <br>  you can take a test up to three days before your missed period.<br>  <br>  but wait until you miss one or have one that is irregular, or do it before.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|sMvWJDqsaa	I think you need to wait and see if you are late on your period before you jump to any conclusions...
m84Ml3Opaa	First of all, I don't understand why she would make such a fuss about "your son's" birthday. You gave him a cake to let him know  that you and your hubby didn't forget his birthday that's all kids want, the presents! If you want to have a later birthday party that's totally up to you and your spouse, she doesn't have to come.|`|IfR2oaFnaa	No, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  That mother does'nt know what she's talking about.  My birthday is the day before your son's birthday, so sure, im a little spoiled, but thats ok, as long as im not rotten, then i see no problem with it.<br>  <br>  In my oppinion, the kids who are "spoiled" are loved more.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the spelling mistakes!|`|RKTNDLDKaa	Tell this woman to **** off.    Well, that's probably poor advice.    I would tell her that you think that she is incredibly rude and out of line.      Explain to her (not that she deserves it) that you were trying to not burden everyone's holiday schedule by adding a birthday party.        Let her know that her child is welcome to attend the party but she should leave her piss poor attitude at home.      Who in their right mind would want to prohibit a child from having a birthday party.  <br>  <br>  I think that you should celebrate your son's birthday whenever your family decides it can be celebrated.  Your son deserves to get birthday presents as well.       It really is sad that your son is willing to forego any presents because it really isn't his birthday.    <br>  <br>  My daughter's best friend has a birthday on 12/26.    The party is generally held at some point during the Christmas break from school, which works out extremely well for the group of friends, but sometimes it's the middle of January.    As far as I know, no one is offended or bothered.    And, they shouldn't.     <br>  <br>  My best suggestion is to not take any advice from this miserable woman and you certainly shouldn't feel badly for providing for your son and wanting him to have a party like everyone else.    Shame on her!|`|fGMmSOxAaa	I had my son on Christmas Eve, too!  The first year we had a family party (grandparents, aunts, uncles etc) but after that everyone just found it too hard to attend.  So it was just the immediate family after that and we did his extended family party in January.  His school seems to be birthday party crazy because the birthday parties started right away in Junior Kindergarten.  He attended other children's so we, of course, felt we had to reciprocate.  But I knew noone was going to thank me for throwing an extra social occasion into the Christmas calendar.  I wasn't fazed by it because I know in some other countries and traditions ones birthdate is not celebrated.  In traditional Russian society, one's name day is celebrated.  Most of those children are named after a saint and their special celebration takes place on their saint's feast day.  <br>  <br>  I never had a second thought about celebrating my son's birthday at a different time.  Like you, I was thinking about the convenience of my guests.  On his party invitation that first year I wrote:<br>  <br>  Although N** was born on Christmas Eve, we feel many of his friends would find it hard to attend a birthday party on that date.  For this reason we are celebrating his half birthday. (we had the party around  June 24th) We hope you can attend.  Please RSVP.  Then we put all the usual information.  <br>  <br>  Not one soul ever complained. They agreed completely with the change in dates and said how difficult it must be to be born on Christmas Eve.   I find your friend's reaction completely bizarre.  Is she generally a nut or do you know her well enough to say?   Everyone I have spoken to who has a birthday at that time has worked around it at some time or other.  I always joke that you can compete with anybody's birthday but Jesus'.  My son always gets a cake and one gift on his actual day but in many ways has to play a bit second fiddle on his own birthday, compared to my two daughters on theirs.  Hardly cause to consider him spoiled!!   He never seems to mind though.  He did, however, during Jk and SK think that his birthday was in June.  For little ones the party is the big thing.  Even if it's very plain with 6 little friends or so.  Now that he's in grade 2 he finally understands  why his birthday and his party are far apart.  He does say he's lucky because he gets 2 birthdays.  Actually, his sisters get a family party and a friend's party, too, but I guess his being further apart he likes it that way.  <br>  <br>  I cannot understand the woman's reaction.  Either she is NUTS or she has some other motive.  Is your party conflicting with hers?   I have 3 children and did the same as you. I have heard from many others who did, too.   The woman is nuts.|`|irLnPW4aaa	Don't worry about this woman...she is out of her mind.  At least in my area, a LOT of kids with winter birthdays wait to have their parties in the spring/summer.  Most everyone realizes that the holidays are too busy for people and the kids with birthdays around Christmastime sometimes get lost in the shuffle.  Having their party at a later time makes them in the spotlight, and that is just fine.<br>  <br>  If this woman is offended, maybe she'll keep her kid home.  Whatever.  Don't feel you need to explain anything, 95% of people will understand and not have a problem with it.|`|juXQJJrXaa	MY GOD SONS BIRTHDAY IS DECEMBER 23, AND THIS IS WHAT WE DO FOR HIM (HE IS 9 NOW)  IN OCTOBER, WE START SENDING OUT  LETTERS LETTING PEOPLE KNOW WHEN HIS BIRTHDAY IS, AND THAT WE WANT HOM TO HAVE A GREAT PARTY WITH HIS FRIENDS, BUT THAT WE DONT WANT TO INTRUDE ON THEIR OWN FAMILY HOLIDAY PLANS.. I ASK FOR SUGGESTIONS FROM THESE PARENTS.  I ALSO GIVE THEM A DATE.. FOR INSTANCE.. I HAVE FOR THE LAST 3 YEARS DONE HIS PARTY ON DECEMBER 31ST... NOT ONLY IS THIS A GREAT NIGHT FOR A SLEEPOVER.. THE PARENTS CAN ENJOY A ROMANTIC NEW YEAR, OR GO TO A PARTY, ECT.. THEY DONT HAVE TO PAY A BABYSITTER, AND DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DRIVING THEIR KIDS HOME FROM A SITTER AFTER A FEW DRINKS.. I HAVE FOUND THAT THIS WORKS OUT GREAT!!  HE IS A LITTLE YOUNG NOW.. BUT THIS PAST YEAR, WHEN DEVIN TURNED 9 YEARS OLD.. I TOOK HIM AND 7 OF HIS BUDDIES TO AN ALL NIGHT SKATING EVENT!  THE LOCAL RINK WAS OPEN FROM 7 PM TP 7 AM, THE COST WAS 12 DOLLARS PER CHILD, WHICH IN CLUDED SKATE RENTAL AND 2 LARGE PIZZAS AND 4 TWO LITERS OF SODA.  I STARTED SAVING 12 DOLLARS A WEEK IN SEPTEMBER, AND WS EVEN ABLE TO GET HIM A REALLY NICE GIFT AND A CAKE FOR THAT NIGHT.. HIS MUM AND DAD HAD A SMALL CAKE AND THEIR PRESENTS ON HIS ACTUAL BIRTHDAY, SO THIS WAS A COOL WAY TO HANG OUT WITH HIS FRIENDS.. THEY LOVED IT!  JUST GET LOTS OF SLEEP THE DAY BEFORE.. AND REMEMBER, HAVE THE PARENTS DROP OFF THE KIDS AROUND 8-9 PM FOR AN OVERNIGHT PARTY.. HOPE HE HAS A BLAST :) BT DONT PUT IT OFF TILL MARCH.. IF U CANT HAVE HIS FRIENDS OVER, MAKE THE EVENT SPECTATULAR WITH JUST FAMILY.. YOU ONLY HAVE ONE BIRTHDAY.. AND IT WOULD BE A SHAME FOR HIM TO HAVE TO WAIT.. AFTER ALL, HES WAITED ALL YEAR :)|`|SfwLF8j2aa	Ok,so here it goes...I don't think it is a huge deal,but I find it a little strange! My birthday is December 28th & My 9 year old son's is December 22nd.(My husband & my anniversary is also Dec. 20th) So,we always have a crazy December,but I would never make my son's party 3 months later.If someone else did that I would not have a problem with it,I just would not do it.I think having his "birthday" so much later ruins the "special" part of a birthday.I could see having it on the weekend before or after,but 3 months later is just very,very strange to me.|`|AA11853243	The only thing I can think it could hurt is your son. Kids are pretty sensitive about their birthdays and it might upset him to not be acknowledged on his actual birthday. You can celebrate his birthday whenever you want, but I would think a small party the morning of christmas eve would be appropriate as well. Or the day after Christmas might be better, giving mom's a break from the kids after a busy holiday. In any case, ask your son when he wants have his birthday and go from there. Oh and ignore the rude ones. They aren't worth being upset over.
4iXL4C6paa	My sister claims she did twice|`|HOdblqIkaa	I got pregnant on it and with a condom. i am now 27 weeks with my 1st|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	yes my cousin did|`|PJLpvZQRaa	i know 3 people and its what 98%?? so you'd have to be in that 1-2% of people i guess. One of them got pregnant on her 2nd cycle of the shot and right in the moddle of it. You should take a test, or have your doctors give you a test before you get the next shot!|`|mPyN2XX3aa	Friend got pregnant on it twice.  take a test.  it could just be the hormones from the shot doing it.|`|sPT8ikgXaa	I've been on the shot for 12 years (yes, you read that correctly, 12) and I have never gotten pregnant (knock on wood).  The discomfort you are feeling, sick to your stomach, is the same thing I get right before my next shot, it sometimes happens 5 days before the next shot is due or sometimes just 1 day...its due to the hormonal changes in your body.  The depo provera keeps your hormones at a constant level, and right when its time for your next one, the level starts to go down..which is why we may feel sick or get stomach aches or headaches.  Some women don't feel anything.  It all depends on the person.  I have not had a period in 12 years.  As soon as I took the shot, my period went away the very next month and I have not seen it since.  And when I got the shot, the nurse giving me the injection said that the shot begins to take effect immediately (if you got the shot while you were having your period) and if you arent on your period when you get the shot, you should wait 24 hours before having sex.<br>  <br>  As far as getting pregnant, I don't personally know anyone who has gotten pregnant while on the Depo.  But you have to keep in mind that everyone's body is different and will work differently with everyone.  Its best to see you doctor or gyno if you are concerned.|`|URpJodMLaa	It's possible to get pregnant while on the shot or after a few days.<br>  Though I think there is a very slim chance. <br>  The shot could not work with your body or you didn't wait long enough. Though they say to wait 24/hrs it's safer to wait longer.<br>  <br>  I know that my friend was on the shot.<br>  ..and she thought she was pregnant.<br>  But she ended up not being.<br>  The doctor had said that the shot wasn't reacting with her body as well as they thought. <br>  So now she's on the pill.<br>  <br>  I'd get a test or ask your doctor.|`|OdYABaIbaa	i was on depo the way depo works is that it stops ur preiod and u cant get pergo untill a year after ur last depo shot read it on the depo provera web site under side affect or getting prego after depo|`|6NCQbyUHaa	My friend is 7 months pregnant and she was on the depo shot. The doctors told she was the FIRST case there to have this happen to.|`|Egg3sJULaa	i dont think that was enough time for the shot to kick in. to make sure you might want to check out there website|`|loqsl5xXaa	i get the depo myself and when i 1st got it i waited 48 hrs to have sex without anything. Then after that it didn't matter. I have heard although very hard to get pregnant on it if yo u follow the instructions for the 1st round and make sure you keep it up. like make sure u get it done a wk b4 or after no longer. I always tried to do it sooner, lol.. This is my 3rd time being on it. Each time i never had a period. the 1st  3 shots or so i always spotted than nothing. I just gained weight :(.. But, the cramping and stuff could be just be the shot. It is safer than the pill. <br>  <br>  ask for a test b4 you get the shot and go from there.
AA11089667	im having the same problem. i was on loestrin for like 2 months, really those pills are sooooo bad . they got me sick , i was throwing up, nauseated all the time , really bad mood swings. so my doctor put me on yaz. i been on yaz for like 5 months now. what ur doctor wants is for your menstrual cycle to get regulated. so when he does put u on fertily medication are able to get pregnant much easier. bucause in reality ur just ovulating like twice a year ur chances of getting pregnant on ur own are very low. and if the bc dont work then u need to have a ultrasound done. just to check u dont have any cysts. i been through all that. good luck to u|`|2zC1lpfVaa	You should tell your doctor that you want to have a baby.  Then he or she will give you other kind of drugs for getting pregnant (and not just regulating your cycles).  Probably Provera to trigger your period, and then Clomid to make you ovulate.
0H1D956Faa	Yes. a friend of mine didnt have a period for about a year and found out she was pregnant. that happened to her twice she is due in may with her second
Xrwvu5Uraa	well just because he did not ejaculate inside of you doesn't mean that you are not pregnant.<br>  <br>  you should really wait a little longer and then schedule a doctors appointment<br>  <br>  that is your best bet.|`|jNqf8HtDaa	missing a pill wont get you pregnant so you should have nothing to worry about so dont stress about if cause if you are there is nothing you can do anyways|`|ig0klGBXaa	stress can cause to be feeling this way.  Dont stress over it until you miss a period and you start gaining weight.|`|qJxXS6luaa	Okay, the chances of you being pregnant are fairly slim, however it's not totally out of the question. The pill is not a fool proof form of birth control. As far as a discharge of brown or red blood, this is at times normal at the beginning of a period or sometimes even mid cycle. Remember that the pill is a man made substance that mimics human estrogen hormones. This can play games with your bodies chemistry for up to a year of continuous use of the product. Missing a days dose is not the worst thing in the world but there is a reason for there being one pill for every day in your cycle, set your phone to beep or something to remind you. As far as your statement (if I am reading the question correctly) of hoping to be pregnant.  You should not be taking the pill if you think you are pregnant and you should schedule an appointment with your doctor for an exam and pregnancy test. Good luck, hope this helps.
oGVPTPCGaa	Is your son formula fed? my sons poo was green when he was on SMA gold it's just a side affect that most babies get on it and it can make him very gassy. if your worried contact your health visitor and maybe change formula.|`|KDNWFuZWaa	my son was born with liver problems, his poo was sometimes brown and other times yellowish and sometimes green.<br>  When the liver is producing waste it colours it when it is working properly, anything that is brown, dark yellow, green as well, are fine.

(Especially maybe green beans or peas?) <br>  <br>  That could be the cause of the green and the gas. <br>  If not, call the doctor and ask them.|`|9tARaFTOaa	green, frothy poo can also be a sign of colic. is he showing any other signs of colic, perhaps pulling his legs up or crying in between feeds, especially on an evening?<br>  <br>  if he's only pooing once a week, you should tke him to see the doctor though.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|iMaTMWMxaa	Are you breastfeeding? If you are then it could be quite a few things that you're eating.<br>  <br>  If you're not, is he on solids? <br>  <br>  Could be spinach, peas, green beans, anything green really, OR anything black could have the same effect, such as you eating liquorice if you're breastfeeding. Brussel sprouts, cabbage, etc|`|276aa285c0c3bcae2ed83a2a0b8cfa53aa	green poo is ok. nothing to worry about. but you said he is pooing once a week....did i understand that right. that is significantly different to the once a day he was pooing. get that checked. if the green poo is just once a week, again dont worry about it. when he starts more solids it will change again.
7aVPODR8aa	Wait till March to see. It's really too early. Most women don't have the signs and symptoms of pregnancy until about 8 weeks after sex.

rdpZrBc9aa	If that's SIX weeks, the answer is yes, unless you have a high-risk pregnancy.  A lot of women don't even know they're pregnant by then.  Later on, as the baby grows, your balance changes and you are more likely to fall.  If you're only six weeks now, this basketball season should be OK.  Ask your doctor.|`|7aVPODR8aa	at six weeks the baby is still an embryo. It shouldn't hurt anything. Most women don't even know they're pregnant at six weeks.|`|L8eNBQelaa	it depends if its a physical game. she can if its a fun game of hoops but not if there will be contact she wouldn't want to get elbowed or fall.|`|mlFaQ1LPaa	depends on how long u carried ur baby.<br>  if still in early stage, still can but not too much jumping.<br>  consult doctor before u do heavy exercising.take care!^^|`|SM4xIodaaa	Yes|`|F3ArhTiRaa	Definitely no because it's too risky.  One month to three months period of pregnancy is too sensitive.  It's the period wherein a pregnant should exert extra care towards her health condition.  If you love your baby then be more extra careful.|`|HrDL4Njzaa	being 6 wks myself and an ex-avid bball player, I'd say its ok. Just as long as there arent' any extreme blows to the abdomen. But always check with your doc first.
cAtWxJG1aa	after every dinner -- but it's usually fruit.  occasionally (a couple times a week) it's ice cream or pudding, and very rarely (special occasions) it's something like brownies or cake.    you would not believe the number of thumbs down i got the last time i answered this question.  yes, my kids do think fruit is an acceptable dessert.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	If they eat a full, healthy meal & want a snack afterwards, they can have one.  We almost always have something yummy in the house, either pre-made or home made, depending on the day.  It's not always something sweet, though - sometimes they want crackers, toast, chips, etc.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	We never do.  Sometimes we may bake cookies or have ice cream or something later in the evening, but we never plan a dessert with our dinner.   No particular reason, it just isn't something we've ever done.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	Only at family dinners - birthdays, Christmas, Easter, etc.    But I cook a meal most nights, and quite honestly there's rarely enough tummy-room for dessert. Although I do usually offer fruit or yogurt to our son after supper.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Honestly, never with a meal. Maybe two or three hours later, though.   Not because I haven't made or offered it - they just like a big dinner, and would rather eat enough of that than leave room for dessert.  But it would run the range of everything from fruit to homemade yummies.|`|AA10811784	We hardly ever have dessert, but we do offer it to our daughter IF she eats well at dinner. That usually ends up being a cup of sugar free pudding or jello.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Only on special occasions of if mrs smith's pies are on sales.  Thats really the extent of it.  I mean sometimes I'll make cookies for a snack but really a desert after dinner is rare in my house.|`|eeGN977eaa	Some times we will have a bowl of ice cream after dinner but not too often in the winter. In the summertime we tend to have more treats after dinner.|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Never...unless its like thanksgiving diner or Christmas diner..etc|`|iM82M15Iaa	Never. unless some times if we have company|`|s1zitZMOaa	Hardly ever. I do bake cookies, cake, muffins, or something like that fairly often (that's something my daughter and I do together a lot) but we almost never have them as dessert after dinner. Now, we frequently bake and then wait until after lunch to sample some of what we made.     Probably the reason we don't do dessert after dinner is because we usually bake sugar free or low sugar things and my husband has no interest in some kind of cookie that has its sweetness coming from fruit and coconut.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	My husband and I don't have dessert after a meal. I usually give Landon dessert though, like a couple of M&Ms or an oreo.|`|RwoN3E9Uaa	Well, Elyse is too young for dessert but my husband and I are HORRIBLE about eating sweets.  We have dessert about an hour or so after just about every single dinner.  The habit got 10x worse when I was pregnant - I craved sweets so badly and now I think we are in the habit to eat them.  Luckily we both have fast metabolisms so we are not 300 pounds!!|`|AA11481889	I learned to make "Orange Cups" from our local sushi restaurant and you would not believe how a little fancy wrist work with a paring knife can make a boring old orange into "An Orange Cup!!!  An Orange Cup!!"    For us it's usually fruit....but we try to keep it interesting.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Very rarely and if i do its healthy. Its only going to cause poor eating habits later in life.  I was raised that way and i've never had a problem with obesity.  Nothing wrong with being healthy and i never craved that crap lol cause i never got it as a kid.|`|czY7K8yKaa	never, unless you count birthdays.  We have a snack before bed most nights.|`|ScaAyzKHaa	If there's snack food in the house, we'll have dessert, but we rarely have something prepared already (except on special occasions). Maybe a couple times a week we'll make something.|`|5qzrXB2Maa	Hardly never....we have fruit and sometimes ice cream.|`|AA11537580	3-4 times a week  depends on what we have for dinner.  if it was spicy like chili we usually have ice-cream or something.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I'm not going to lie.  My kids eat plenty of things they shouldn't.  There's always ice cream on hand.  If I'm having a lazy day then that's what it is.  About 3 to 4 times a week I make something.  My kids think it's fun to help bake and it's an incentive to get them to eat things they normally wouldn't.  Fruit does pass as a dessert with my kids though.  If I put a little bit of peanut butter on the banana or a tad of chocolate syrup on an apple.  They eat plain fruit for most of their snacks though so I like giving them a small dessert after supper that's a bit more special.  Also we eat fairly early (I think)  so I'm not as worried about the sugar.  (usually eat around 4:30-5)|`|FvYqKZSMaa	After all 3 meals I give my kids snacks.they eat breakfast at home have a snack at daycare then eat lunch and come home have a snack,dinner then dessert.  I usually make fruit or something healthy for dessert.And one in a while they get Popsicles or ice cream.Thats very rare though.|`|dDVAUA9saa	90% of the time, dessert at our house is yogurt, fruit or applesauce.  The other 10% it's animal crackers or other cookies or ice cream.  My daughter is only 22 months - as she gets older, I will probably get less anal about what she eats!!|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	Nightly.    It isn't necessarily sweet, but we enjoy a dessert after our meal.|`|eF6HTt0gaa	We offer some type of healthy dessert option every night, wether its frozen yogurt, frozen grapes, yogurt dipped pretzels, or trail mix with M & M's.. But when I was a kid I only got dessert on Fridays and the weekend, never knew why.
cAtWxJG1aa	I'm a lawyer, but the people I know with MBAs (including my sister-in-law) certainly did very well off of theirs.  It's usually a great investment, and there are far more opportunities open for those with than those without.  If you know for sure what kind of position you ultimately want, though, look at some job opening ads for that type of position and see what they're looking for.    *eta (reading the other answers) -- i think an MBA is qualitatively different than a masters in most other fields.  in most fields i'd say stick with a bachelors or go for a phd.  But an MBA is a really useful thing to have.|`|8ZEqAwJ7aa	I have my bachelor's degree as well and have looked into getting my Master's. Honestly, in today's job market there are so many unemployed people with Master's degrees. Nobody wants to hire them because they have to pay them more. I would put the investment off until our economy is better. It's a lot of risk right now.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	LOLLL i love how it bleeped out C um. Anyway i think a bachelors is really sufficient enough altho theres no harm in furthering your education.  It depends on the career about your masters. for me it would make no difference, but for things like teaching it def. makes a difference.|`|agTCqkLDaa	It really depends on what you want to do:    If you want to go into psychology, then your getting a master's is pretty much non-negotiable if you want a job.    If you want to go into teaching, you can still get a good teaching job, but it can be anywhere from a couple grand to a ten thousand dollar difference in salary if you have a master's.    Any job online is not going to be affected one way or the other unless you're starting a business or going into sales.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	I know a woman with her Masters in Psychology ,,she scrubs toilets in a home for mentally challenged adults... I cant figure that one out.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	My old boss and my mommy friend now completed hers a couple of years ago.  she says it was the best thing she could do.  She has a MBA.  With it - you can command more money, obviously.  Coming from a sorta recruiter, more and more positions are asking for a masters.  It puts you one more step in front.  I'm seeing more and more master's resumes than I thought I would.  Of course they are usually for higher paying positions and for more influential positions (i think thats the word I'm looking for, you know the important ones)  She took her classes online to complete hers.  I say if you can do it, do it.  It can not hurt you.
HvoOeTVuaa	I think your names are awesome together!  I noticed that not a lot of people like Kashim, but it obviously comes from your nationality/background and I think it's great!|`|fXj2kVpPaa	Too hard to spell.|`|zIAeznSEaa	They're okay, but I think it'll get annoying, having twins with such similar names.  I have twin cousins called Nona and Neve, and when they're being naughty and their parents call them it's like a tongue twister   Twins also like to have their own identity which could be hard if they have really similar names    But if you disagree, then yeah, they're nice names  Good luck with the twins and I hope I helped|`|GFzDwIk6aa	I like Kalia, but not Kashim. However, if these names are of your ethnic origin, then I think they go nice together.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Kashim sounds masculine to me but I'm not sure because of it being an ethnic name.  If it's for a girl, could it be Kashima?  That for some reason sounds more feminine.  Kalia is a lovely name also, hopefully for a girl.  If Kashim is for a boy, it's fine.|`|99Dvcw29aa	Kalia is beautiful and adorable....not so found of Kashim. how about Kalia and Kaden??|`|4ilM2hCwaa	Nice enough, not a big fan of allitertive or rhyming twin names though.|`|IEQqdYO2aa	kalia is beautiful  but for the other i would do something like kass or kassi not kashim
gx4s68s8aa	Buy the larger size.  I too am a 32/34 DD  and I am 31 weeks as well.  This is my second baby.  After my milk came in the first time I was an F.  I know that is a scary size to be, but most likely that is the size you will become while breast feeding.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	In my experience, the people who work at Motherhood are usually young teenaged people who have never been pregnant, nor do they really know anything about fitting bras, etc. I would go to a specialty shop or just go out and try them on after the baby is born. That's the only way you'll know what really fits. And not all of them fit equally, so you want to be sure it's something comfortable, because you'll be wearing them a lot.     I made the mistake of buying them before I had my baby one time, and I never wore them because they were awful once my milk came in and I was nursing full-time. Don't waste your money. Just go in after the baby arrives and take a bunch off the rack and try them on.|`|aWPQXoIAaa	I went to Nordstrom and they were extremely helpful. Maybe u should try a store like that.
nVQGpvuoaa	ignore it. its how your family was raised to believe all colored people are bad. Its good you got out of your family's way in that. i know its hard to ignore your mom making fun of you..but I would actually go out there and explain that ok some black or mexican or some other race people are good and bad and tell them that so are 'white' people or whatever you guys are bad too you have to explain to them thats your out look on that subject and they are the "stupid" ones for being so closed minded and actually having the dignity to call one of their own family members stuff like that..i would also tell them to grow up and act more mature.|`|M6c0hUefaa	Wow, you're family sounds SO similar to some folks in mine. My family and I grew up in the Mississippi delta and my mother's side of the family are HUGE bigots. Luckily, my mother never promoted racism and my father was a complete opposite that would have jerked a knot in my rear had I used any form of racism around him....BUT...I still have to hear their views during family reunions and how "weird" I am, because I don't believe in their beliefs. It also doesn't help that I show up at times with purple hair, but I like to spite them and make them wonder sometimes....My sanity has come into question with them because I let my daughter self feed at 7 months and choosing to make her own food opposed to buying jarred food, which they thought was best. Oh, and if I buy anything organic I'm considered a "hippie" that spends too much money on food....Bleh, I just hang out with the ones that I like and leave the rest to question, kind of like it that way. It's also kind of cool because my daughter is half Hispanic, but not a one of them had a word to say about it during Thanksgiving... :)|`|dPULl5hjaa	You can't control what your family thinks about racism.<br>  <br>  Glad to hear you're different!<br>  <br>  Just bite your tongue and tolerant the family!  Try very hard to ignore them!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	ignore it and spend more time with  positive people who will encourage you.|`|2SQxX4oSaa	black people are ten times more racist. WTF do you think black people talk about when no whites are around?
3K7ffKn2aa	I would say it depends on the age. A newborn yes i would i plan on holding my new baby all day lol. But i know people that would hold them just enough to comfort them and put them down so they wouldn't expect to be held all day. (I'm just going to be to excited with her to put her down at first oh well ). But children learn to comprehend things fast at 5/6 months they understand simple commands. And if my child gets upset with me because i say no and starts screaming and caring on i will not pick her up or give into that. All that would do is re-enforce her crying and shouting to get attention or her way, which is not something i will tolerate. Now once she is calm i will hug her and kiss her but she has to learn the right way to do things.   So long story short if my baby cries I will pick her up, if my child is acting up no i won't re-enforce that behavior.|`|1a837cf5274e28b6f67b09c94f14b623aa	I always picked mine up when she cried, if I didn't I could not figure out what was wrong with her.  I think as parents the first thing we want to do is let our children know that we are there for them.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	It's bad not to. Go with your instincts they are there for a reason! I have always held my son when he cried, night or day and plan to continue. He is a very curious, independent little guy. Letting a baby cry just tells them they are alone. You may find the links below interesting.|`|44OH7Si6aa	I always picked my children up when they cried, at least the first time. Pick them up, check the diaper to make sure they are still dry, calm them down and find them something to do; if they cried after that I would switch their position or try a different toy but they wouldn't get carried. You certainly want them to know that you are there for them, just don't let the cute little thing con you into carrying it around on your hip 24/7. Eventually you will figure out how your baby acts when he/she is hungry, wet or bored and be able to act accordingly.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Babies cry for a reason.  So, when baby cries, the appropriate response is to try and determine what baby needs, and provide it.  That need may be food, or comfort, or just holding/be near mama.     You cannot love a baby too much.|`|68c6B8dRaa	Pick 'm up and make with the cuddles; it pays off. You can't make a baby feel too secure.    Useful: http://www.aces.edu/pubs/docs/H/HE-0718/...  http://www.talaris.org/research_aug2006....|`|x4uGfC4oaa	Yes it is, because after a while the baby won't let you put him or her down! They begin to associate their crying with attention and you don't want that. You'll learn why the baby is crying and what it needs. Sometimes babies just cry.|`|r52rfBkeaa	I always picked up my son when he cried - they're just babies!  They're used to be in this soft, warm womb where everything is perfectly fine.  Then they're thrown into this loud, bright, crazy world and they need some reassurance every now and then.  My mother told me I shouldn't pick up my son all the time, but she's loony so I ignored her and my son has turned out just fine so far (he's 15 months).  He knows he's loved very much and that he can come to me when something is wrong and I will make it better.  Holding a baby is loving a baby and you can't love too much.|`|PF2Dhykyaa	well.... yes she or he will get spoiled..i guess|`|qStmw7qgaa	It doesn't necessarily mean pick him/her up.  If your baby is crying, or fussing...it could just mean that you are no longer in there eye site or they can't hear where they are and they just want to know you are there.  Mydaughterr is like that.  She will be on the floor playing, staring at the ceiling fan, and then she will realize I'm not there or my husband isn't there, and start fussing.  Once I go and sit by her, and play with her she is fine.  So you just have to judge what they want, and what is best for your and your baby.|`|KwkEvmpPaa	Oh dear god of course you should pick up your baby i actually researched this and i found out that if you don't pick up your baby when he/she cries they grow up feeling lonely because when they cry they expect for someone to come care for their needs and mama you have to make sure your baby knows he/she can always count on you and baby is not going to cry to irritate you a baby cries because he/she needs something. I hope you make the right decision     Good Luck
G2auAv1Saa	Every night after our daughter is asleep we go to our rooms and pamper each other. We don't have a TV in there. We rub each others feet, he brushes my hair or paints my toes, we just pamper each other with one thing every night while we talk about our day. We do this just for about 30-45 minutes every night no matter the time and it helps us relax and reconnect as married adults and not just mom and dad.   *Married almost 18 years with one 4 year old daughter and a son on the way in a few weeks!|`|EtCRnDJMaa	Since my husband has been overseas for almost 4 years now I have no alone time and I am with my 3 girls 24/7.  When he's home for R&R we always stay together as a family because our girls want his attention too and we don't want to leave them out.  When school is out for the Summer  the girls and I drive to Colorado, usually takes us 4 days maybe 3 and we spend the whole Summer with my Dad at his ranch.  The girls love it there, they go horseback ridding, ride their gokart, swimming, fishing, taking care of the animals.  Last year they took care of a baby calf named George. They had to bottle feed him 3 times a day.     You might be wondering why this keeps me feeling fresh, the girls have over 100 acres to run & do whatever, and NO TV.  All entertainment is outdoors.  I do bring along my laptop!  This is the best vacation ever!  They're outside from 7am til 8 or 9pm.  We came home last year 2 days before school started.  We were sad to leave!      This year my husband's flying in to Denver.  So it will be even better!|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Clicky mindless computer games when I need a break during the day    Grownup time with dad after the kids are in bed|`|W8UZebRWaa	I get my hair done and my eyebrows threaded.

I would like to get a new purse and a new pair of shoes.|`|faPKwClPaa	For the two of us, we got a house cleaning service because we were tired of spending/wasting our weekends trying to keep the house clean.

My husband enjoys wood work, so he'll take on a small project.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	you know what is sad I'm struggling to answer that question.  okay i have one - i love, love this one brand of lip gloss from bath and body works.  whenever i am out I will always buy it, even if its not on sale.  thats a big deal to me.  yes i'm that cheap.  :-)|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	Once a month I get a hot stone massage.  My husband gets me gift certificates for my birthday and Christmas (6 months each).  It is my one afternoon all to myself and it is wonderful.    Sometimes in the evenings, I will take a walk all by myself or with my mom (she lives across the street) to the local coffee shop.  We get coffee or hot chocolate and continue to walk.  It is very peaceful and calming.  The perfect way to end a hectic day.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	One of my new years resolutions was to give myself a little more "mommy time". Usually I do some little things like a hot bubble bath, watching a TV program uninterrupted, reading a book, taking a nap, or ordering take-out for dinner.     When I'm in need of a little more, I'll take a little trip to the mall for a new outfit, a massage, get my nails done (usually I do them myself, but it's so much more realizing to get them done), plan a girls night with some friends, host a "for the heck of it" party, or go get my hair blown-dry for me instead of me having to do it.    And no, I don't ever feel bad for doing this. It makes me be a better mother to my children.|`|bYhqPOtwaa	About 2x a year I splurge on a professional haircut & color instead of the diy kits.

Hopefully we will also still vacation as a treat.  I like to take 2-3 trips a year.  I will still do that because the baby needs to go see my parents in Boston.

I love bookstores too.. but I do always bring the kid.      I guess it's harder for me to answer this than I thought.       I used to have a jeep like princess, and I used to take it off roading on the weekends, or drive to the beach with the top down, like she said!    I used to ride horses and was learning to train them.      And I used to like dancing.    Life has been too crazy lately for me to even remember these things...  let alone do them.. they are the bigger things I guess.    I have to come up with some new things that fit in with life now.  Maybe painting my toes, or reading at night, or talking with friends.  I liked Lipstick Jungle but they took it off the air. Love wine once and a while.

OQnRP6xVaa	...I am the adoptive mother of 2 siblings from foster care...<br>  <br>  and this is what I think:<br>  ___________<br>  <br>  Dear A,<br>  I will never forget that day at the DHS office when I watched you kiss her goodbye. I saw how much you loved her--and I see your love in her. I saw you swipe the tear from her eye as you held her just one more time. I saw you look into her eyes and tell her that you will never forget her...that you wanted her to remember Your eyes that she should never forget the eyes are a window and you hoped one day you would both see each other again. <br>  <br>  I saw you touch the cheek of your baby boy. The little boy you hardly had a chance to know. The baby they took from you before he was able to know you. <br>  <br>  I was scared. It was NOT supposed to happen that YOU and I would meet. I was told I would not even see you that day and you wouldn't see me. I was frozen -- YOU were REAL and I was worried you would hit me in the eye, that you would see me as stealing your babies...that you would HATE me for not helping enough to make it possible for you to keep them. <br>  <br>  ...I wanted to run. I wanted to flea from you and drive away as fast as I could--with your children safe in my car. I saw a woman and a mother that day who loved her children the best she knew how. I knew What Had Happened to YOU in your life... How you didn't have half a chance. How you ran away from the foster home when you were only 14 and no one went looking. I knew you didn't have a chance in Hell of doing much better then what I saw. <br>  <br>  I didn't want to face you. I didn't want to see the woman who didn't have a chance. I felt like I was hurting you more that day in the parking lot at the DHS office. When you were done with the last goodbye my knees shook as you came to me--holding our daughter. I was ready to duck, grab and run as the caseworkers stood ready to jump in. <br>  <br>  When you handed me your daughter, our hands touched. I was scared to look at your face--but, was brave and I expected you to say awful things. I was stunned however, because as we touched that day and I took your five year old daughter into my arms. You touched my cheek and said only one thing... I will never forget because when you said it my heart stopped, you threw me for a loop because rather then something awful, you actually said, "Thank You."<br>  <br>  I left--and the children fell asleep in the car-I cried the whole three hour drive home...Your words to me pressed on my heart. HOW COULD YOU THANK ME? I thought. <br>  <br>  It's been 6 years now. I want you to know that your words made it possible for me to do the best I know how for YOUR babies. Your words made it possible for me to not feel like a thief but to feel obligated to make sure your thanks was not in vain. <br>  <br>  I think of you often. I think of you when I look into HER eyes. I think of you when I watch the children grow. I should be so angry that I can't think anything Nice at all! HOW the HECK could you be so foolish as to hurt them with drinking and drugs...Where were you when some man in your life hurt your Daughter! I should feel nothing but mad at you for what your Choices caused in their lives....but, for some reason I can't feel that way very long. <br>  <br>  I remember your story and I am pissed that No One did this For YOU! I can't believe that any child is not loved enough to be cherished. I can't believe No One cared enough to go look for you and drag your sassy butt home--ground you half to death and make sure you knew you had value to bother to punish for running away! I am so angry that you were in the system and no one bothered to care. <br>  <br>  I pray for you every night. I pray that YOU can change your life that you can find value in yourself and that one day when I see you again I can Thank you for letting me do my best when you couldn't. I pray that between all of us we can change the future and that Our Grandchildren will never know what it means to be a Foster Child. That it will just be a story told by the elders who together managed to survive and give M&M a chance you never had.<br>  <br>  Thank you for the opportunity to love them and care for them with the blessing you gave me that day, Thank You for understanding I did not take them away--I only gave them a chance to grow up loved with a family who would never let what happened to you--happen to them.<br>  <br>  Until everyone sees each other again--<br>  A|`|iVcaB9h7aa	I think about her every day.  I wonder why I haven't heard from her for a while.  I wonder if she's happy.  I wonder if the new man in her life is treating her well.  I wonder if she's thinking about J (her daughter).  I wonder when she's going to write back.  I wonder when we're going to see her again. <br>  <br>  We have an open adoption with a very shy woman who goes into silent mode every so often.  When she does it's usually because something isn't going right in her life.  I pray she finds the peace and love she deserves.|`|AA11987492	Best Answer: Happy Mom|`|VFifg9FEaa	I think of my daughters bio moms multiple times a week.  Usually when I am looking into their beautiful faces and reflecting on how lucky I am that they are my daughters.<br>  <br>  I have the utmost respect for her for leaving her daughter where she could be found and not left to die alone.  I always thank her for this act of love. I feel the sadness that I know she must feel daily knowing that her little girl is not with her.  I feel upset with her that her society doesn't value all children, especially girls with deformities.  I am sad that I can never show her how much her daughter is loved and has blossomed into a perfect little angel.  I have faith that somehow she knows that her little girl is happy and loved.  I hear stories that some bio families keep tabs on the children that they give to the orphanages and I like to believe that my duaghters' mothers did this and know they were adopted.|`|tgtsbxpBaa	I am not an adopted mother, but the older sister of two (now adult) adopted brothers.  I think about their biological mother nearly ever time I see them.  <br>  <br>  Unlike many of the "warm fuzzy" feelings here, that is not what I think at all.  I may not hate her with the same venom I felt when I was younger, but I still think of her with a bitter scorn in my heart.  I think of how absolutely cruel she was to do what she did to those boys (they were both born with FAS) and to the five other children she bore who were adopted out to families other than mine.  I think of her as the epitome of so much is wrong with our society.  <br>  <br>  While occasionally I can find pity in my heart for her, there is never warmth and certainly never LOVE.  Oh, sure, she gave me my brothers - but she didn't give them the lives they SHOULD have had.  She bore children that were mutilated from birth - damaged so that their lives would always ALWAYS be mere shadows of what they should have been, with more pain and frustration than anyone should have to endure.  What, exactly, am I supposed to love about that?  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, I do know that not all "birth mothers" are like her.  I know other families that have amiable and even friendly relationships with the biological parents of their children.  Others, who have less open relationships, still have a sense of gratitude towards the barer of their beautiful children.  That is right, in cases where the mother did all she could to protect the child and simply could not raise him/her.|`|AKJwWqdZaa	Adoptive mom here,<br>  <br>  Yes, I do think about my children's first mothers... and I think about them a lot, particularly my daughter's mother. <br>  <br>  As for my feelings about them: I have nothing but warm feelings for my daughter's mama. My daughter was born in China and I can only imagine the dire circumstances and pain involved in leaving her daughter. I think about her a lot and it saddens me to know that she is missing out on knowing her beautiful, charming and exceptional daughter. I have no doubt she would be so proud of our little girl. I think about her the most on my daughter's birthday; the anniversary of the day my daughter was found; and whenever my daughter reaches a new milestone.<br>  <br>  As for my son's first mother, well, my feelings towards her are more complicated. We adopted our son from foster care and his mother was abusive towards him. My feelings range from anger and disgust to just plain sadness. I can't imagine anyone not falling in love with our son. He is wonderful and it's truly sad that she never bothered to see that.<br>  <br>  But mostly when it comes to both of my children's first mothers, I do think about how I'd love them both to know that their children are loved like mad and how wonderful my two little firecrackers are.|`|29f92985b9fb483985c8c89cbc7a99b3aa	I adopted a sibling group from foster care.<br>  I think about my kids' mom all the time. Her picture is on our fridge.<br>  My heart breaks for her. She was so young, so misled, so troubled. She had no family herself, as she grew up in foster care and was never adopted.<br>  Everyday, I hope and pray that she is okay, that she is getting her life together, and that she will be prepared for when my kids find her. And they will. <br>  She comes up in conversation in the very least once a day with my son. He is six now and was adopted at the age of three. We make her christmas decorations every year so that we can honour her on our tree.<br>  I think about her when I see my daughter do something exceptionally cute. Although I only met her twice, I can totally see her reflection in both the kids. Sometimes, on special occassions, such as a school concert, I think of her, and what she is missing out on.<br>  I think of her when my son regresses into old behaviours, grieving for her. I think of her and realize that he cannot heal completely until he is with her again.<br>  I think of her when I see joy in my son's eyes because sometimes it is like looking into her eyes minus the pain I saw their that day during their final visit.<br>  I think of her whenever I have the camera in my hands. Half of the pics I take, I make sure no one else but the kids are in the pics so that I can send them to CAS and hope she will pick them up. <br>  I thought of her the first time each of my kids brought home art work from school. After I had it up on the wall for a while I put it away to mail off to CAS for her to have. <br>  Ya, I think of her.|`|Of7KEsnXaa	I'm an adoptive mom. <br>  <br>  My daughter's mom and I talk all the time. Just yesterday she called to tell me she was expecting again. She is my friend on myspace, so she can get all the pix I post of our daughter. <br>  <br>  I feel that she was young and made some mistakes in her life, but she had never had much parenting herself and when her time came to be a mother, she was alone and unprepared. She trusted me enough to let me adpopt her daughter which had to be very hard. <br>  <br>  I think she is a brave young woman for many reason, and I am hoping that htis time, she is able to parent her child.|`|Alyvp37Maa	I am an adoptive mother.<br>  <br>  Yes, I think of our children's First Mother's.<br>  <br>  One child's mother is deceased but i do still think of her often.<br>  <br>  The other child's mother, I think of almost daily.  I think of how much she is missing out on.  I think of what a great kid she has.  I have always hoped for them to have a relationship.  I still hope some day she will come around and get to know her daughter.  She is so much a part of her daughter and she is just as important to her daughter as i am.  As always i wish her happiness and love.<br>  <br>  The two children we are raising are extraordinary children.  I imagine their mothers were/are nothing short of incredible women.  So much of who our children are, is thanks to them.  They deserve to know that and they deserve to experience the joy of knowing their children too.<br>  <br>  Lastly, the situations in which i think of their mothers.....<br>  <br>  When the children smile, strike a cute pose, blow a huge double bubble, report cards, shoot a basket, finally zipper that coat, learn to skip, make the advanced math class, any accomplishment the children go through really i think of their mothers.......|`|PKUPgmnwaa	I think about my son's mother all the time - every day, several times a day.  All kinds of situations make me think of her:  when someone tells me how beautiful our son is, how cute the cleft is in his chin.   When he does something new, when there is some new milestone - I usually try to remember everything so that I can tell her about it.  We don't speak, by her choice, but I send letters and pictures.  I usually will start the letter as soon as I finish the last one, and keep adding to it, so I'm always thinking about the next thing to tell her.  I think about her when I put him to bed and whisper "I love you, and Daddy loves you and {her name} loves you."<br>  <br>  What do I think about her? I think she's an incredibly smart and talented young woman. She is raising her daughter on her own, going to school and working full time.  She's creative and artistic.  I don't know the reasons she chose adoption, those details belong to her.  <br>  <br>  For me - and I don't know if other first mothers find this insulting or not - but for me, I will always be tied to her, she will always be a part of me - because we both love our son.  She won't ever be far from my heart - because I feel like I'm taking care of our son, for both of us.  I want her in his life, and hope that one day she will change her mind, and allow contact - but I let her make those decisions.|`|993127072b7a2a0e8c555efdb241a674aa	i know im overstepping my boundaries-i am not a birth or adoptive mom. but i do know what my amom felt about my bmom. exactly what the agency wanted her to....disgust.<br>  <br>  my parents were told that my bmom was a 12 year old drug addict. she was a run away and in a nutshell was an awful person. <br>  when i found my bmom and told my family they did not respond well at first. they thought that since i was older and the 'hard years' were over, she was coming to be 'mom' to me. <br>  <br>  none of that was true. my bmom had a very very good reason to relinquish me. and it had nothing to do with drugs or any other self inflicted issue. and she was not a runaway. she lived in the same house before i was born and after. and she was not 12. she was young...but not 12. <br>  it took them years to realize i was not replacing them with her, but that she was an addition to my life. i had enough love and respect to go around. <br>  they even met last month...it was fantastic. the worries and any belief in those lies is not gone forever.<br>  <br>  like i said though....it took YEARS|`|NZF45pJmaa	We actually speak monthley.

2HETgiwgaa	You count from the first day your flow is enough to need a pad or tampon (day 1) then finish counting on the day before your next period starts - if you've been counting the first day of the next period, that's why there'd be a difference.  You could try a charting site like fertilityfriend.com to help you keep track.    Additional: That would be a 25 day cycle - you can't tell exactly when you ovulate from that because you also need to know your luteal phase length (the time from ovulation to your period) :-)|`|4DoXomHZaa	26 days from jan. 14 is the 9th of Feb.     Day 1 of the cycle is the day you start. Look at it this way. You start at 10 am Monday. At 10 am Tues, you are 24 hours, or one day into your cycle. Cycle day is not the same as cycle length. So 26 days from the day you start is when you should start again.    You will probably ovulate on day 12, or Jan 26th, which of course we are past.|`|BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation

Unless you swore at them or something, I don't think you were out of line at all.|`|Q0DLGuGwaa	no you didn't if they gave you an app time then they should stick to it, if you were an hour late they would have told you to go away and re book so what gives them the right, yes there are emergency's but it is totally ridiculous good luck on ttc|`|nfLyS1toaa	i think every thing will be ok with the staff. maybe you are pregnant since you went off the handle like that! lol. i truely hope this appointment goes well and you get the results you are wanting. god bless|`|iWrXIWcPaa	i think i would have done the same thing. it doesnt sound, to me, like you over reacted. i mean as long as you werent screaming and yelling and raising your voice. i would be very upset if i were waiting in a dr office for an hour. the thing that would tick me off the most is that no information was provided as to why you were waiting so long, you're right, a nurse should have came in to check on you and let you know what the hold up was! hopefully your family dr will be more helpful! good luck with ttc.|`|0XCSQsf3aa	An hour-long wait is unacceptable. You did the right thing. They need to learn they will lose business if they can't keep a decent schedule.|`|5X3Wsxfwaa	I'm sure I would have been at the nurses station before an hour was up.  In fact I have questioned them when my wait was long.  You have every right to be upset and I would inform the doctor that a nurse told you "That will be $10"!  IF you decide to continuing seeing this dr. I would tell them the next time it happened you WILL switch Dr's.|`|9P26sacKaa	Nope.  No over-reaction.  In fact, I would switch practices if I were you.  That's just ridiculous.  I wouldn't even wait 20 minutes without asking what was going on.  It's incredibly rude to expect you to just sit around with nothing better to do and no explanation.   If all you were in for was a pregnancy test, also, anyone could have given you that.  It's really horrible that they left you for so long.    I would switch practices.  I'm all for midwives for low-risk women, so that's what I'd go for first.  They spend more time with you and are typically a lot friendlier.  They also have better normalcy rates for pregnancies and births because they treat birth and pregnancy as normal instead of like an emergency waiting to happen.  They are well trained in seeing signs of the abnormal and referring to doctors early, when needed.      I'd definitely switch practices.  That's ridiculous.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	I don't think you over reacted but you should understand that emergencies are normal for an OB/GYN. One of my first visits with my doctor resulted in an hour long wait because he had an emergency c-section. My last visit (yesterday) he had a patient come in with a personal emergency that put all the patients back that afternoon. Both times I was informed that I would have to wait and I didn't mind. If I was in your situation, I would NOT have paid the co-pay! It was good of the doctor to call you and personally apologize. I've worked in a doctor's office and it can become very hectic sometimes, so patients is greatly appreciated!|`|aWPQXoIAaa	That's terrible. U have A LOT more patience then I would have!!!|`|01vMpHkWaa	you didnt overreact  i would do the same  thats annoying, sitting there an hour past your appointment  and then the nurse tells your to pay when you werent even seen by the OB?    i would leave without saying anything and make them panic lol|`|QYYWBrG7aa	overreact at all.they should have told u something! I would have done worser then that.lol.i would`nt worry about it tho.Good Luck!!|`|a68665ef6c4434c025138a75281114eeaa	from what you descibe you handled it well. your expectations of your drs. office are appropriate.   although the doctor apologized, it seems like the office staff are the ones that owe you an apology.|`|KozoNqpsaa	I agree with you 100%. There is NO excuse for them to leave you sitting there all that time with no explanation. I wouldn't have waited  more than 30 mins without poking my head out and asking someone what the hold up was? If I read this correctly, they charged you $10? For what?! Taking up an exam room for a scheduled appt that never occured? The nerve!    Good luck at your family doctor hon!|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	You didn't overreact at all, they are unprofessional and need to keep track of patients better. I used to work in a vet clinic, and the chart hanging on the closed door of an exam room tells the staff who is waiting and who is being seen. The nurses or admins should have checked for charts, then they could have at least popped their head in and let you know the doc was running behind.    I wish you luck at your appointment today! Update your question if you have big news!|`|cfdooGylaa	No you didn't overreact. You shouldn't have been waiting for an hour. If you scheduled an appt for 12 o clock, you should have been seen at 12 o clock. Wish you all the best!|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	you did not overreact...that was really inconsiderate of them  and to make you pay more ... sorry no way jose!  i wouldnt have waited for one hour - you sure are patient|`|buoqtZeFaa	I don't think you overreacted at all.  i swear the same thing happens to me EVERY SINGLE MONTH it's to the point i want to switch doctors but I am already 27 weeks so I am trying to stick it out.  I hear all kinds of things going on outside the door but never anyone coming in to say she will be right with you.  I should have lea redd my lesson from the first time I went to the dr. this happened and I told them I was leaving and magically the dr was ready to see me.  My regular OB referred to this lady because he no longer delivers babies and that really sucks because his office was great I NEVER waited more than 10 minutes in all the years I have been seeing him.      Sorry that you had all that stress     Wishing you much luck and baby dust!!!|`|DNygQdmVaa	no you didn overreact.    And good luck!|`|9vgZNLP8aa	THis happened to me a few weeks ago! You handled it better than I did. I went to the desk and bit everyones head off! I was 30+ weeks pregnant and was so mad. lol    I waited a total of two hours for NOTHING! I also had my two other small kids with me who were getting cranky just being there.      I don't think you overreacted. The least they could have done was came in and told you it was going to be a while.    I must say that I put up such a stink that every dr appointment since I haven't had to wait very long to be looked at. :)|`|yznZqcznaa	What you paid the 10 dollars!  For what you didn't see anyone. You were there and they did not keep your appointment time, not the other way around.  If I were you I call and get the 10 dollars back.  That is a matter of principal.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I would have been very upset as well.  I personally had all of my pregnancy care AND delivery handled by my family practice doctor.  He never had a busy waiting room, always had plenty of time for me and the nurses were as excited about my pregnancy as my own sister and mother.  It was a great experience and now my doctor takes care of my son, whom he delivered.  I'm certainly going to use my family practice doctor again for all future pregnancies (as long as they remain low risk).  Skip the OB/GYN and go with your family doctor.  I doubt your wait will get any shorter with an office staff like the one you described.
E7ViD8EWaa	While writing a really stressful exam:<br>  (Our classroom was right next to the bathroom.)<br>  <br>  "You get the bessssssst of both worlds na na na na na...Then you rock out the show...you get the bessssssssst of both worlds, Mix it all together, and you know that it's the na na na na na..."<br>  <br>  <br>  I guess someone forgot a bit of the lyrics.|`|o0Q7LmMsaa	a couple of weeks ago<br>  the teacher across the hall was teaching her class<br>  and my class was taking our chapter test<br>   by the way the teacher that teaches across the hall from us is pregnant, anyway<br>  all of a sudden everyone in my classroom dropped our pencils and looked up<br>  because we heard a lady make a loud scream coming from across the hall<br>  and we were like wtf!<br>  then this girl in my class made a comment saying (trying to be funny)  <br>  "dang someone needs to go check on the teacher across the hall  i think she in labor"<br>  and we all started laughing! ( it was the way that the girl said it, that made it so funny)<br>  but the teacher was okay<br>  i guess she just screamed?<br>  it was really funny even my teacher couldn't hide her laughter!<br>  <br>  <br>  =)|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	I remember back in like 9th grade i believe we were in the room taking a test i thing m-casts and out of no where yelled "OH MY GOD ITS IN MY PANTS!!!!!!!!!!!!" and this girl goes running by grabbing her bum. We couldn't stop laughing at least I couldn't because I ended up being sent to the principals office.<br>  Tyffannie|`|Jucak0HLaa	Haha,this is about walking through the hallway,but one day I was walking to my locker,and I randomly heard some freshman say, "I have to sit on my hands so I don't masturbate."|`|GfCjZJbXaa	Lol it was actually today!While doing work someone just ripped  a BIG one right in the middle.We all started to crack up|`|p25p9jTYaa	we were taking a history test and an autistic kid in out class saw a guy cheating on his test (using the book) and he just whales "YOU'RE NOT UHPOSSED TO USE YOUR BOOK, BRANDON!" And the teacher threw the newspaper he was reading on the floor, and looked at him for a second, sighed and then stood up, whispered something to him and then left the room, taking him to the evil, evil principle's office. I have always hated that guy, he got saturday detention and everything... MWA HA HA!|`|94a649dd7ad7b4bbd37d4e30411762e1aa	In English, we can always hear what the (loud) Bio class across the hall is saying. We're taking a vocab test, and it's quiet. Suddenly, we hear, perfectly clear, what somebody across the hall is saying. "What's that stupid word she used to say in the 7th grade? celly? or something?" just stuff to that sort about this one particular person. SHe didn't realize the girl was in our english class. We all started laughing when she's like "OH she's across the hall!"|`|7MKmxkjlaa	Um. we were taking an La or science test ... dont remember it was last year. and all of a sudden there are 2 little kids (im in grd 9 ... elementary jr high school) and its a little boy saying in a funny high squeaky voice (probably imitating a girl) ... OH MY GOD why was she in that dark classroom alone with HIM?!?! <br>  and they were probaly like ... grade 4 or 5|`|LTWlBSFNaa	we were takeing a test and heard i'd tap dat really loud in the hall and we were in like the 5th grade so iy was a big deal then|`|FiUprYsvaa	We were taking a test when something slammed up against the wall in the classroom right next to use. It sounded like someone was thrown right up against a wall. We all stared, it was sooo weird.|`|xWfrA3vqaa	We were taking a test and it was dead quiet and then this loud Portuguese music comes on next door.

The classroom that I was in is very close to the busiest intersection in our school. It was very silent until we hear a bunch of shuffling noises. Then we hear a loud punch. Then some guy yells "Get offa me you ******!" After that, one of our dean of students came running down the hall screaming "BOYS, BOYS, KNOCK THAT OFF RIGHT NOW! BOYS!" then you could hear a few other teachers come running out of their rooms yelling the same thing. After that, it sounded like there were enough teachers to get the 2 boys to stop fighting. Apparently one of those boys got a broken nose.|`|E5aMuyVhaa	Haha this isn't as funny as most of the answers here, but it is surely strange so here you go...<br>  <br>  Last year while my school was taking MCAS, a kid kept on talking to himself, and not in the quiet re-reading to yourself mode, he was whispershouting "525,000,600 MEERKATS!" over and over and over while reading a math problem. It was funny, but then it got annoying, and the kid in back of him kicked his chair. Apparently the chair was old because when he kicked it, the chair and the desk fell apart on top of the meerkat kid and he started crying... in 8th grade. <br>  <br>  Thanks!|`|zmP80v8saa	I was in Science, and this one girl in gr. 12 who always skips class and walks around the halls, yelled "P E N I S!!!" and then started singing Womanizer :p It was Truly, utterly strange :p and after everyone burst out laughing she walked into the classroom (like she always does) and tried to get people to dance with her (while she was still belting it out at the top of her lungs :p) and when my classmates danced with her, she got kicked out of the class and suspended for class disturbance :p lol it was hilarious....needless to say..we didn't end up finnishing that test :p|`|X4VDkEctaa	We r taking an ACT test for s.s. and I have this friend and everytime I would c his lil sis she would hit me or kik me in the balz and so there r a bunch of Lil kids commin in our school to practice thier Xmas play and I look out the window and she's glaring at me LOL and she didn't even know I was there but she found me LOL|`|mr5BoOwZaa	I go to a really old school, and during a World History test, one of the pipes that carries steam throughout for heating purposes ruptured.

This really wierd girl in my 7th grade class a few yrs ago, we were taking like, one of those state exams, and all of a sudden her stomach growled. actually, i have never heard someones stomach growl that loud. it was dead silent and all of a sudden we just hear a sound like a cat tragically dying. everyone turned and looked at her with curious eyes and she started crying. the teacher had to calm her down and get her some water before she hypervenalated. <br>  <br>  another time: We were in like 8th grade or something and taking our mid-term exams. all of a sudden in the hallway, we hear a scream like someone was being slautered....some moaning (like sexual, really loud) and then this kid went "WHOMP THERE IT IS".....we all laughed histerically....then out of nowhere this kid was licking our window....like to the classroom door....i think he got kicked out of school....it was weird lmao.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	LMFAO! thats funny<br>  <br>  I herd someone sreaming like a monkey.

If you do bleed around the time of your period, and it is not as heavy as usual, it could be pregnancy spotting.  This happens for some women when the implantation of the embryo occurs.|`|Coc593Ikaa	No, your period would stop if you became pregnant. Continuing to take the pill would not do/change anything.
mc6YtaRbaa	Implantation bleeding on happens in about 30% of women.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Only a very small percentage of women ever have any bleeding at all with implantation.    It's just that a lot of TTCers have periods and want to not give up hope and pray that's it's implant bleeding.|`|xytsrVZoaa	I m trying TTC.I had my periods on 5th jan and on 23 rd jan i noticed two drops of red blood followed by abdominal pain and brownish discharge for few more hours.I did some research and found out i had implanatation bleeding.Yesterday again when i was in toilet i saw red blood with mucus.I am 2 days away from my periods and still not sure if i m pregnent or my periods is going to arrive.If you observe pain in lower abdomen followed by brownish dischare(when u wipe off using tissue paper) ,thats implantation bleeding..Lots of baby dust:)
yznZqcznaa	Atlanta in July is not baby friendly anywhere.  It gets so hot here! In July it can easily be 102 here.  On average no cooler then  98 degrees.  So what ever you do keep the baby indoors.  The aquarium is supposed to be very nice, I have not been.  I am dreading July as I will be 8 months pregnant at that time!|`|01vMpHkWaa	just bring cheerios...that will occupy him lol  5 months old are easy to occupy  grow out your hair and let him play with it  haha no just kidding that would hurt    do you mean what are places for you to go to with him so you arent bored? lol    well i live in SOUTH florida and its pretty dam hot in july so im guessing it isnt much better in atlanta. so i suggest an indoor place. OR just go to the craft store and buy baby safe arts and crafts and play in the hotel. i was going to say the ZOO but, the heat...but like the other lady said, the aquarium is a good idea
WwCBomTMaa	I suggest stocking up on things for later. He's 3 months old now so start buying clothes for 6 month, 9 months, 12 months.....etc. That way if you fall on hard times the baby still has plenty. I still stock up on things for my daughter (one size larger in everything, just in case) and she's six.|`|8fl1vEUCaa	You should set up a Wic appt because you probrably qualify. Then the formula will be free, if all your bills are paid then save that money for lil emergencies. Buy the baby clothes online, at the second hand store, or thrift stores and you'' save a grip of money on the same name brand clothes plus the baby is going to grow out of his clothes too fast to spend on expensive clothes anyway.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Besides food, clothing, and diapers there aren't things he really NEEDS.    How about putting some in savings? You don't need to spend it all at once or even ever. Sure you could get some toys but I wouldn't go overboard. How about an exersaucer or bouncer for future use? With my son's toys I always look and see if they can be used for long periods of time(transitional toys). That way I feel I'm getting something for what I'm paying.|`|r52rfBkeaa	I would save it and use it little by little as you see fit instead of spending it all in one swoop.  Check your local Goodwill or Craigslist for used toys.  Yard and Garage sales are good places to look too.  Babies grow out of toys so fast there's really no point in buying new - just be sure to wash them well.    A crib is the only thing I can think of that's expensive that he'll need, but if you have that then you're covered.  If you don't, you can find used ones too.  Check with friends and families to see if they have anything they can pass down.  Moms are really good about that since they have to make room for new things anyways and don't want anything to go to waste.  Then you can do the same when someone asks you for help.    --- I saw your note:  I'd skip the bouncer.  They only use them for a month or two and that's IF they like them.  My son hated his.  See if you can find a used swing instead - most babies like those and they can use them longer.|`|PZ9jIk5zaa	my son david hurley loves to be breast fed at least 12 times a day|`|PF2Dhykyaa	milk a crib a rattle....smth to bite on such stuff no more..or u could save it 4 the baby when he/she grows up...

44OH7Si6aa	Yes, I know for sure that a company called daydreamers makes some. You may have a hard time finding them in stores since it isn't summertime, try looking and ordering online. You can always browse through amazon.com i know they ship to canada|`|pXSKSS3daa	Gerber onesies that come in packs are usually thinner material, especially the white ones.|`|eHow24rNaa	Yes they do have the little muscle shirt onsies...i had some when my daughter was a baby. She was always cold so i had put that under her clothes during the winter. I go all mine from walmart and target. They might not have any right now b/c its not summer yet. Good luck!|`|qYNCV6L1aa	Walmart sells them in packs. They're by Gerber mostly. They're very thin material and come short or long-sleeve. I love these onesies. My son can wear them under anything or the onesie alone when in the house. With socks of course :)|`|IngripgMaa	Target Brand makes these thin material onsies.  Good Luck|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	look for gerber onies tank tops that's what I have for my almost 3 month old I got them from walmart
3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	That is disturbing.<br>  <br>  I would like to know why an 8 year old had unsupervised access to a gun.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	I think it's absolutely ridiculous to say he's actually old enough to be responsible.

Again, scary.|`|6RGnG1ukaa	I didn't read the whole article but that i terrible.|`|aAOgJvjSaa	It is horrible that someone so young would already be so messed up that they would want to take their own fathers life. We don't know all the details so who knows what the father and the room mate were doing to the kid. It would be hard for me to believe an 8 year old would do something so horrible unless horrible things had already happened to him.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I don't know the full story here, nor do any of us.

fb6e01bd10dce5212a34b8e493ff20a8aa	Fu(k the d@mn cruises then!  Glad I'm not traveling with you!    Book a trip to Europe with a hotel and car.  If you want rail travel passes, don't buy them here--you'll just get scammed!      Have a nice trip and next time be more specific.  You're more finicky than my cat!|`|ygimTNzoaa	Fishing was always fun, going horseback riding you can always do the starter thing and have someone hold the lead-rope till the kid gets the hang of it. My dad would take us to the beach but we lived in central northern california so a beach with docks to crab off of. Look up crabbing theres nothing more fun for kids to do then crab really, plus you got some delicious free crabs! We'd crab at Dillon Beach or Bodega Bay, California. Fairs or depending where you live now I'm in Cincinnati, Ohio I hear when spring comes around though I'm not religious a lot of the churches have festivals and stuff very family oriented. Rent a boat and go out on a lake and go swimming and picnic for a day. The Grand Canyon is always interesting no matter how old you are or hiking in a forest would be good if you rented a cabin probably in the sierras or the smokey mountains. Hopefully you find some of this interesting.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	If you aren't against the idea of a beach look into ones that have board walks and other attractions to do.  that way the beach is only a part of it.  i have completely fallen in love with va beach.  it is a great place.  family friendly by day and more adult oriented at night (if you want to bring a sitter along for night out excursions).  they have an aquarium, we went on a dolphin boat ride that my 3 year old still talks about 7 months later.  i really like that beach and really want to go back myself    EDIT - oh yea DC is awesome.  Its so close to a lot of places - Baltimore for the aquarium and science center (both places are kid friendly), Philadelphia, and the beach, plus close to tax free shopping.|`|zMDnzS9Haa	Butlins lol|`|C2sZREuAaa	Just go visit your inlaws or relatives.  I am sure they know of places in the area where you call can go.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	we have beautiful places in ireland as the south of ireland and the west have beautiful scenery and beaches or you could try disneyland paris  in france|`|iX5p5pHwaa	what hey look at my comment pick me as best answer and i wont kill you :)|`|0H63P4jAaa	sea world|`|aCUHzMrmaa	I took my kid to Disneyland when she was 3.  Lol they understand enough to know its a great place. Honestly thats the first place i thought of lol.  The zoo is always fun too, horseback riding when they are old enough, kid themed museums, plays.  I grew up in San Diego so there was always fun stuff for kids to do, its a great vacation spot cause we got the zoo, wild animal park, and sea world which is awesome.    Edit: If you dont want peoples suggestions then freaking use google...|`|CsLyyRQeaa	The zoo and fun museums.  Aquariums, themeparks that have rides for 36inches and up.  There are fun thing to do you just have to get creative.  Water-parks, Branson, Missouri, Monary Bay, CA, Venice Beach, CA, Sea World, there are all sorts of things.|`|1DT7OUuHaa	I agree about Disney.  I went the first time when I was 10 and that was the perfect age.  Little kids are more of a burden to take as whose going to watch them for most of the rides and a lot of the stuff actually is too overwhelming and scares them!  I thought maybe about Paradise Island in the Bahamas (especially since you like the Caribbean) or how about a cruise that caters to families (I know Disney has one).  http://www.nassauparadiseisland.com/  http://www.kid-friendly-family-vacations...  Personally, I think I would leave the infant at home with a grandparent or aunt or uncle but I understand if you don't want to do that.  I'd really consider Paradise Island, it's incredible!  Really fun for kids and adults alike and very exclusive as well with reasonable packages.|`|XCrtAUTpaa	what about the Sandals resorts aren't there things for kids to do and adults|`|G3hTM9qeaa	Do some research on Greatwolf Lodges. They are all over the US and are kid friendly resorts to stay at. They even have things like tree houses and forts inside the suites for the kids to stay in. This can turn your whole trip into an "adventure" and allow you to do your adult things during the day. Just a thought....|`|Knierqi9aa	Check w/a local travel agent.  they can recommend more active types of vacation places that even offer babysitting. I have two kids (4 and 8) and we prefer to just hang out, cook in or bring meals in, watching the kids swim in a privet pool,happy hour on the deck, or hike in the woods.  We have family outside of DC, so went  DC last summer..it was a nightmare.  We saw some of the Smithsonian, Capital, White House.  My kids complained about being too hot, too thirsty, we couldnt find bathrooms when we needed them, and it was just too much walking for my 4 y.o. If it was just my 8  y.o., the sky's the limit, but w/a younger one in tow, things can be a little unpredictable.  But I have friends that took a Club Med for Families vacation and they had tons of stuff to do.  Pricey, but said it was well worth the $$.  I think they have some out of the US as well.  We are almost out of the "youngster phase" and do plan to do my traveling.  My husband has been to Puerto Rico for work and wants to take us all there for a family vacation.  Mexico could be fun, but stay away from Cancun...hit one of the small islands.  We've been to Belize, which is also super affordable.  You can do a split trip between inland rainforest/ruins, and the coast.  But again, traveling w/a toddler has its' own set of issues, no matter wehre you go.|`|I3ADzPGYaa	i say the zoo with a stroler or atlanta's aquarium its cool|`|KV9VqkAoaa	I'd say water parks.!!! You can neva qo wronq with that!  Ohh and umm i live in new york, i would say NEW ROC CITY!!!  Thats like a arcade/everythinqq!! seriously!!  Uhhh... and cant qo wronq with Shoppinqq!!!|`|oTPcaQ0Maa	yea a cruise would be fun the kids would all like the idea of a big boat. Any large aquarium...anything with good visuals...|`|CNlfn5Wraa	Sunset Beach Resort and Spa in Montego Bay, Jamaica. A very reasonably priced resort. There is a water park right inside the resort.|`|eB8PBqyoaa	We take our kids everywhere that we go.  They LOVE the zoo in Indiana, they also love waterparks, indoor or outdoors sporting events are fun for them, they like to camp, go fishing, sledding, taking them to fun places to eat.  You can do anything with your children, even road trips if you make it fun for them, play car games, or bring a dvd player.  As long as you keep your children involved in what you are doing it is usually a blast, yes it is and can be testing at times but all well worth it!  My children are 3 and 6.  Good luck!|`|SO6tHlKcaa	What we do is, we pick a nice spot and then we do google searches on kids stuff. It's actually fun to go on trips with kids bec they are so happy with so little and u guys feel like u did something even though it was this 7$ attraction that was stupid, but kids make it sooo exciting. hey look theres a fish, whereas an aquarium is blah bore snore but with kids its fun...  I took my sons (3 and 5) to the farm yesterday (seriously 20 minutes away and under 6$) my younger one was like, you're the best mommy in the whole world- you take us to such fun places and then u take us to buy slurpees!!! HE WAS THRILLED!!! they love the play areas in the mall even! any park is awesome as would be sitting at park making a portable bbq...fun for kids (snoreworthy for grownups alone) so while there are the drawbacks of kids and vacation (think atlantic city, not really) theres fun in the little things around any town (sometimes at night u can get a sitter and during the day you take kids on daytrips) good luck...dont feel like ur kids are a burden they are such fun!|`|kQKFfZAmaa	europe is a great idea because you can travel from country to country using the same currency.    the link below has some tips for traveling to europe with kids|`|irLnPW4aaa	Storyland in New Hampshire is a great amusement park for taking the little kids....everything is geared for 3-6 year olds, there are only like 2 rides that have a height requirement over 40", and there are a lot of other great things to do in that area of the beautiful state of New Hampshire.|`|YPwGJ6BVaa	i have an infant a two year old and a 7 year old. how much fun you have totally depends on your kids. my son was 4 when we took him to disney and he loved it. he still talks about it. i think taking a 10 year old is actually harder b/c they tend to be more whiney and want what they want. we go to amusement parks all the time. We are roller coaster fans and so is my 7 year old. i guess he's a bit on the tall side b/c he can ride most of the good rides. there's not usually more than 1 or two rides he can't go on. We have been to many different Six Flags theme parks, numerous waterparks as well as Legoland, Dutch Wonderland, Sesame Place, Sea World and Busch Gardens. We also often just choose a cheap destination and then find really cool places around town to visit. When we traveled to Atlanta, there was the Aquarium (which is better than NY btw and i am a ny native) the coke museum, the water fountain in the park and a bunch of other little things to do. We are always on the go on our vacations and have yet to run out of new and interesting places that we want to visit.

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Yes and no.  The purpose of Medicaid is to ensure that mother's that otherwise might not get adequate medical care, because it increases the likelihood of a healthy infant.  The general purpose of prenatal care is a healthy baby-which means a healthy mom.  During pregnancy, both mother and child are taken care of.  The mother can also use Medicaid for things that are not specifically pregnancy related-such as a broken bone.  So, the care is also for the mother.    After the baby is born, s/he has Medicaid generally for the first year.  The mother remains on Medicaid for about six-eight weeks-so that those post partum checkups are covered.  I think that most states allow mother's to remain on Family Planning Medicaid, so that they can get birth control.    So, again-the answer is yes and no.  The mother and baby are both cared for, with the goal of a healthy baby.  But without a healthy mom, it is harder to have a healthy baby-so her health is important as well.|`|6SIjchQUaa	That is not true, if you qualify for medicaid it will pay for your healthcare and prenatal care during the pregnancy, depending on your qualification it might continue to pay for you but will care for the baby up to a year.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	the mother can get medicaid during pregnancy! so who ever told you that was stupid. i used medicaid with my first pregnancy.. so get on it if you need it!!  and then after baby gets here, your baby will go on it too.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	Alabama Medicaid will take care of both up till 6wks after birth for mom and also Birth control.

d1027f6834f2f2660c8aa9290737073eaa	ADHD!! I wouldn't even worry about that! The activity to me would mean that you're having a super healthy baby girl that is just trying to get nice and strong for when she comes out into the big bright world!<br>  <br>  Both of my daughters beat me up terribly on the inside for months when I was pregnant and it was really cool to watch the baby bump move around! And yes, it does seem that they're up most of the day and night sometimes, but I'll guess that it should start to slow down somewhat in about a month or so.<br>  <br>  And yes, you ARE super thin which is another reason (I believe) why you're feeling the movements so much and seeing this so much. The baby doesn't have much space to kick around in and is just trying to stretch out a bit!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|PSpK0vEoaa	my babygirl moves alot too around that same time for me too but than around 5.5mnths i barely felt her and worried lol but now this lil girl is non stop moment especially at night i think the same too but dr dont seem concern but its always good to ask the dr|`|puCOYwMmaa	I don't think your baby has ADHD some babies just move a lot.<br>  <br>  My baby moves a lot too, like all the time and it hurts! <br>  apparently I can't even feel everything because when I saw her on the ultrasound or when my midwife listens to the heartbeat shes moving even more than what I can feel|`|PYafv6gSaa	your baby wont have adhd its normal my first moved uncontrollably all through the night and so did the second my first is now really active during the day and aslep all night i was smaller than you in height and shape i am raelly short and reallys thin and it can get uncomfortable
lkhCeAdJaa	I personally would just treat the fever (Tylenol) and let the cold symptoms run their course. not that I am against cold medicine....I'm not at all.  It's just that once you treat the fever, she will feel MUCH better even with a runny nose and cough.      but I also know that  teaspoon of dymetap is usually okay for a 2 year old (been prescribed by my pediatrician before)....not sure about an 18 month old.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	call the pharmacist..tell him the weight of your child ..he will tell you the amount to dispense|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i would never give my baby a medicine for 4 years and over....my mother gave me medicines specifically for babies and that was it.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	Ask the pediatrician about Benedryl.  That has been always "prescribed" for those symptoms with my kids.|`|Knierqi9aa	The formulas are different...the childrens' ones are not safe for that age.  she still needs infant formulas, but somebody told me those ahve been taken off the market (my kids are older, and they were avail when they were babies). I wouldn't use those unless your doc said it was fine.  Some of those ingrediants can cause kidney damage, even in small amounts (well, that's what the claims are). If its a low-grade fever, T should do the trick.  But for colds, I keep a COOL mist humidifier in my youngests room all winter long.  Doesn't really "cure" the cold, but makes breathing a little easier while laying down all night.  Also, try to get her to "blow out" as much as she can before bedtime; this always helps my son.|`|GZdvHbT5aa	My pedi told me I could give my son one milliliter of Robitussin CF. But I really don't recommend doing anything without speaking to your child's doctor first. There is a reason why they have taken all these medicines off the shelf and raised the suggested ages on cough medicines.|`|C6wO9ixpaa	Do not give your baby any cold/cough remedies! Treat the symptoms as best you can. If there is a high fever get her to the dr. or if she becomes lethargic or you just need reconfirmed. Instead, in the meantime, use baby vicks rub, tylenol as prescribed for discomfort, and possibly a humidifier, although I think those things breed bacteria. Instead, I go once an hour with my baby to the bathroom, turn the shower head on the hottest setting and let the room fog up. It shows instant improvement. Also for sore throat, a lemon water warmed helps a lot.|`|1bf2f9586d3ad537a73d55b79612e926aa	My 3 yr old has the same thing, and I have given her nothing but ibuprofen for her fever. And an antibiotic that her doctor prescribed. ( this is the first time she has ever taken an antibiotic). It's been 6 days and she is still coughing like a 65 yr old emphysema patient.  But I would suggest letting it run it course, maybe some saline drop for her nose or some tea with lemon and honey.|`|5dca67bd0dd4aa9a8ea84176747ecb36aa	No.  Don't be lazy and give her medicine. Tylenol is best.  Use a vaporizer in her room.  How do you know your mother gave you adult medicine as an infant?  How would you explain yourself to the ER doctors when you couldn't wake up your child because you gave her the wrong dose?  It only takes once to regret forever.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Don't do it!! There could be problems.
fQLeIAh1aa	epsom salt bath, vicks vapo rub on your back and REGULAR STRENTH tylenal.|`|4TiWZLKXaa	Maybe you should talk to your doctor, you may have a bladder or kidney infection.|`|JvbvGtrBaa	yoga<br>  extra strength tylenol|`|ccnH77SOaa	I don't have lower back pain but I have upper back pain and it really doesn't seem like anything is working to help it.  I'm seven months pregnant now.  My mother told me to but sea salt and take a bath in it, I haven't tried it yet.|`|wRyX3A7Oaa	I hate to be the bearer of bad news but your doing just about everything... Your probably carrying the baby in your back. The one thing that worked for me was a pool. Not only does the water lift the pressure off your lower back but your entire spine... Good luck|`|PYafv6gSaa	it could be a pinched nerve try not having a hot shower i heard that causes it i put an ice back were the bones are at the back but i put it down heaps low so that i didnt get kidney chill
P1xlrvAaaa	Ok so I know that you are already peeing like crazy but if it seems the urge is stronger or your feeling more pressure make an appointment with your doctor you can have a UTI.Good luck and congrats on baby!!!!|`|AA10771601	that is normal, it's just the baby and it won't come out.|`|ig0klGBXaa	I had the same feeling that you are describing and the dr told me everything was fine it was just getting close to time for the baby to come.|`|wRyX3A7Oaa	I'm on my third pregnancy and I get the same feeling when I am so close. I wouldn't worry...
xRZ1PRZwaa	Here are some ideas -<br>  <br>  - a children's Bible story book<br>  - a CD of Christian lullabies<br>  - picture frame<br>  - certificate holder for baptism certificate (lovely and affordable!)<br>  - a crucifix in a keepsake holder<br>  - a Christian keepsake figurine or music box<br>  <br>  You can get these sorts of items at specialty gift shops, some pharmacies and at Christian stores.<br>  <br>  Well, just a few ideas...we went through baptism gift shopping not too long ago, so it's all fresh.<br>  <br>  I hope these ideas help!|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	Get them a baptism photo frame. They make special ones that say a variety of things about baptism. For example: <a href="http://www.catholicchild.com/BAPTISMAL-BLESSINGS-PICTURE-FRAME/productinfo/33954/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholicchild.com/BAPTISMAL-B...</a>|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I would have to say that one of my favorite gifts given to my daughter for her baptism was a beautiful charm bracelet for when she's older.
LkjyXSWUaa	Yes it will get easier.  As the baby grows it will eat at longer intervals and things settle in and you get settled into your new role and your new life. Don't feel like you are not pulling your weight around the house.  Those of us who've had a baby know you just don't sit around with your baby.  One thing you should remember that there is only so much time in a day, so you have to choose between baby or cleaning.  Of course we all choose the baby!  Your house work will  be there tomorrow and the day after and the day after that.  IT IS NOT THAT IMPORTANT! No one ever looks back at their life and says "boy, I wish I kept a cleaner house".<br>  Tell your hubby this exact thing and if he doesn't agree or understand let him take care of the cleaning if that's what he wishes.  <br>  Congrats on your baby and enjoy being a mom.|`|4iXL4C6paa	Been there, done that..when my sons was born my other children were 1,2, and 5 so house cleaning was not at the top of my list and my husband was working out of state so he would be gone for a couple of weeks at a time...of course the baby is priority #1 as far as the house goes I would do what has to be done, I would do my dishes, vacuum and just basically straighten up, give yourself 30 min. to a hour to just get the basics done and the rest can wait.|`|8396838b128e2966c0c31ebdd32d0f49aa	I've been there myself.  Twice actually.  It does get better, trust me.  However, to make things a bit easier for you, try to get some things done here and there while the baby is napping.  Also, it's ok to let the baby cry if you absolutely need to get some housework done.   Crying doesn't hurt the baby.  Of course you wouldn't let them cry if they're hungry or need to be changed, but if you have a baby like mine, they like to be held 24/7.  Try to explain to your husband that this is just a temporary adjustment period and things will slowly get back to normal.|`|AA11757270	It does get easier.  I congratulate your husband for helping with the housework.  Make sure you are eating well, and still taking your prenatal vitamins to keep your health and energy up.  <br>  <br>  If you can start to express enough milk to stock up for the day, then once baby takes a nap you can get some things done, and once daddy gets home, then he could feed baby, while relaxing on the couch, and you could do the cleaning/take a shower that you need/want to do.  I think that was my husband's favorite thing, just to sit in his favorite chair with the baby, and they would both pass out after work!<br>  <br>  As the baby stops feeding so often, you'll find more energy and time to get things done, as well as when the baby sleeps through the night then you'll start doing more when the baby goes down for the night.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the newborn! Congrats!|`|ES7QVGbZaa	your husband is working 16 hour days...youre working 24 hour days....<br>  you are tired too! have you told him how tired you are? i read your explaination...but i still want to beat down your "poor" husband. taking care of another human being (let alone a newborn) is much harder than any work your hubby has to do. plus, he gets paid...you dont. he has days off doesnt he? you dont. so on his days off he should help out more. maybe on one of his days off, leave him with the baby while you go out with your friends or whatever, and he will see how hard it is to take care of a baby all by himself.|`|N3jwE76maa	Your husband needs to understand that a newborn is more work then he thinks. You most likely wake up every 2 or 3 hours to feed the bub, which can make you feed exhausted. <br>  I had that with my little guy. My mother in law was coming over for the first couple of weeks to help tidy up.<br>  As baby gets that bit older, they will start to sleep longer and give you some extra time to tidy up your place or have a shower or eat. If you can clean up while baby is sleeping, go for it, but if your tired get some rest. <br>  As i said, hubby needs to understand too that a baby is pretty much a full time job.<br>  Good luck to you|`|cb60492f8b19c07b6383e285162bbf99aa	boy can i empathize.  I have 3 week old preemie twins at home. Dh works 12 hour days between 4 and 6 days a week. I'm Ebf'ing too. It will get easier eventually. Give it about another 2 months or so.  Talk with DH, enlist some help and relax a bit.  This isn't forever!!!!  Do you have friends or family close by?  Would it be possible to "hire" help for things like dishes and bathroom?  <br>  <br>  I get the vacuuming done once a week if that!!!  Give yourself a little time!|`|pXSKSS3daa	It's hard at first with a newborn. We've all been there! It will get better, I promise. You'll soon fall into a "routine" with your little one where you'll know them much better.<br>  <br>  Talk to your husband and explain to him what you do all day. He may just not understand(many men don't). If it's really getting to you wear your little one in a sling and clean up a bit here and there.<br>  <br>  Housework takes a backseat to your baby and that's all there is to it. You'll learn how to juggle everything like a pro in a couple of months. My house is clean but those first couple of months it was hard!|`|faPKwClPaa	Yes -- hire a cleaning service.<br>  <br>  Some people may say that's too expensive, and to them I say, "Well, how much is your sanity/marriage worth to you?" ;-)<br>  <br>  We did that and it has been SO nice.  We come home to a clean house and no one feels like they have to keep it so tidy.  We spend more time with each other and our baby and the stress (from that issue anyhow) has completely dissipated.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	turn off the computer and spend more time with your spouse.  some things are not as important once you have children.  let him clean because it might be soothing for him.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	babys have this effect as your child gets older you both will adjust he will just have to understand and help out|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	Mine is almost 3 months now in a wk and I know it is really hard still but hes starting to sleep through the night a little but during the day, hes up and i cant do anything but take care of him. Your husband must understand this. He can help out. Your job as the other people on here said, its 24 hours. Motherhood is hard, you still have your hormones out of whacked too and this is a new transition for you..major culture shock..Trust me, I know the feeling, if you feel this way... I know I do. But it will get better. Time goes by fast and in no time you will have a little bit more time to do stuff here and there when the baby is sleeping. But for now, just cut yourself some slack and enjoy the baby, enjoy being new parents...dont worry about the housework... dont worry about petty stuff.  You and your baby and your rel w/ your husband is number one. Baby is number one right now mostly.|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	Your husband needs to come to terms with the fact that, the life you both once lived is OVER..your lives now revolve around your child and what baby says ..goes.<br>  <br>  Not to mention you just had your lil one a month ago! You arent doing anything wrong..so dont think its you..your hubby DOES have something stuck up his a&& if cleaning is the first thing on his mind when he gets home. His mind should be on you and the baby!<br>  <br>  Now with that being said, as long as the dishes and laundry are being done..that IS an accomplishment and all you can do right now..you are STILL recouperating from pregnancy & giving birth! Just be straight up with him..let him know what your day is really like..b/c unless you tell him hell think your sitting around eating bon bons and watching oprah all day. and just let him know, when you guys get into more of schedule youll be more ontop of the cleaning.
qXq0nmBzaa	lillian jane alexander is the best one|`|Yz1pzloSaa	Lillian Sylvia is kinda hard to say. I like Lillian Jane Alexander. I don't like the name Cynthia....and I think Arya is a bit too weird. It's pronounced Area, right? If it was pronounced R-ee-uh, it would still be a bit weird...|`|Elxuvon8aa	Cynthia diane looks good and sounds good but so does lillian Jane  So I guess it depends on wheather you like Cindy ot Lilly|`|V20PTwMmaa	yes yes no no|`|kIblsxJQaa	I am sorry but I dont like any of them.  They sound like old ladies' names.    I do like Lilly tho and Diana isnt bad either.|`|GFzDwIk6aa	I don't really like them. Arya Diana Alexander is okay.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	I like    Maria or Michelle|`|QoaaqNbQaa	my fav:  arya diana alexander    hows this name?    Ariana Diana Alexander    It reminds me of a beautiful girl, that only a good boy can dream of. :D|`|42WmRqNoaa	i like the last one.|`|qN6Bq0Emaa	I vote for lillian jane alexander|`|o298GAKcaa	i think lillian jane alexandrer is lovely .|`|CRvdmFwCaa	I love the name Lillian.    I'm not crazy about the middle names.    Lillian Marie    Lillian Lane    Arya Alexander sounds cute.|`|7VfWz7zyaa	They sound a bit long.   why not just Diana alexander?   :)|`|AA10702882	I enjoy Arya the best, but I might consider changing Diana to Diane, like the Greek goddess of chastity, and it sounds nice together.|`|phwivaqNaa	It depends on what you are looking for:    Lillian Jane/ Sylvia are pretty, but not out there;  more old school    Cynthia Diana personally always sounded like an older women to me    Arya Dianan is pretty and more original;  Less chance there will be more than one in her school|`|oDjtE9ZUaa	Theyre kinda old fashioned...  try alexandria, or lexi or something a little more jazzed up, then use one of the other names as a middle name?  good luck|`|aMHIA7XMaa	The first one is the best - it has a good flow to it. The rest I don't really care for.|`|TenzGU1Saa	Yea, they're great. but I'd lose the Alexander. :o|`|o9DNnXD9aa	The first one is nice  not so keen on the second or third but the last one is good too|`|E0PQQaNjaa	I like Lillian Jane. Lillian Sylvia as a lot of L sounds.|`|f425d664905eb6c89349738e21ca4708aa	arya diana alexander  its different, and lovely!!|`|fXj2kVpPaa	Love the last name.    Lillian sounds like an old lady.  Arya is too unusual.      I like Diana Lilly Alexander|`|8a3nZpZUaa	no offence but none of them sound to great but my favourite is  lillian(i would go for lily) jane alexander|`|exRohsTEaa	i dont like any of them :/  Lillian just seems old fashioned...  and cynthia reminds me of the barbie from rugrats.  i dont have any kids.  but when i do have kids im going to pick really unique names.  so far ive picked out.  Rhylee Jade. - for a girl  Kirsten Rae - for a girl  Charlie Blake - for a girl.    Austin Stone- for a boy  Kayden Brock - for a boy  Braylen Kyle for a boy.|`|UYAhesuvaa	I vote for Lillial Jane Alexander
L8eNBQelaa	eyes burning and headache sounds more like sinuses. don't drink a beer just in case and schedule a blood test with your doctor to see if your pregnant.|`|GR07LyyTaa	even tho it has been a week it might be too soon for test to detect the hormone.. wait a couple days, maybe till Monday to take another test.  I had the problem with bad headache and my eyes burning up until i was about 3mths preg. so it's a good chance you are.. try waiting a couple days tho, and just hold off on drinking a beer!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Wait a few days and test again.  Drink lots of water.  You may be dehydrated.  Treat yourself as if you are pregnant until you know for sure.|`|PYafv6gSaa	i have had one miscarriage 2 years ago and i really wanted another baby so bad every time my period was slightly late i prayed to god and within 3 months i was pregnant again and you could be pregnant all the scientific stuff about you cant get pregnant at certain times is silly because you still can chances are just less likely to.<br>  pregnancy starts form the last day of your last period.<br>  pregnancy tests work by the hormone level hcg so if your hormone level is over a certain amount then it will show you are pregnant but if your hcg level is not as high as it will show a negative read and remember pregnancy tests never show a false positive but do show a false negative occasionally. i would advice not to drink the beer but try some ginger beer kinda the same just safer its also suppose to halp with morning sickness. i hope this helps and i dont know if im a minor but i answered anyway im 19 and having my 2nd in july and when i found out i was pregnant i searched and looked into everything about pregnancy|`|OVMb4V7Maa	Just like the first person said, headaches and burning eyes sound like sinuses. You may or may not be pregnant (obviously lol), but I wouldn't drink any beer, smoke, etc. until you find out for sure if you're pregnant or not. I'm not technically a "minor", but even if I was like 16, I could answer, because I got pregnant with my son at 16.|`|FwQ8Y8kGaa	The answer's pretty obvious; go to a doctor.|`|njhtRBZYaa	Your body changing but it might be to early to determine the possibility of pregnancy just wait a few more days and test again but you might be

I thought I was going to start my period. I had spotting and period like cramps multiple days before i was supposed to start.

That is the only way to know for sure.|`|p0prrzf2aa	maybe he gave you an STD. your a growing girl your gonna be eating and gaining weight!|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	no you are not pregnant. I think you would know. You probably just think you are so subconsciously you are eating more and gaining weight. Go to a doctor.|`|AA10988719	well not having your period since August - that is not good.  people don't always have morning sickness, weight gain may or may not be a sign.  talk to your mother and go see your family doctor.  if you are pregnant you will need her help and support.|`|J2gr1ogHaa	Are you red?

You dang sure don't need a baby. And you dang sure don't need to be having sex, unprotected or otherwise.|`|AA10308264	You say you had sex in Aug.. so if you were pregnant.. you would already have been in your last trimester by now.. ane be showing a gr8 deal... so if you are not showing pregnancy... you are not pregnant.. btw are you having your monthly periods..??|`|CoQgr7ROaa	I would take another test and tell an adult that you trust and wouldn't tell your parents.

Just move your legs, I know you don't want to but it helps.|`|PYafv6gSaa	the cracking is normal its your hips shifting|`|wRyX3A7Oaa	I had mine (pregnancy related sciatica) so bad with my second pregnancy I was practically on bed rest my last month....
4iXL4C6paa	When I was pregnant with my first child I lost my father in a car accident and exactly fourteen days later I lost my uncle in a motorcycle accident I thought I was going to lose my baby or go in to early labor because of stress...I tried to handle it the best way I could but of course you are going to have to grieve that is part of the healing process, I tried to stay around family and friend that I know would help me deal with it but to be honest I cried myself to sleep more than one night and my baby was fine...this is a very hard thing to go through, and I am so sorry for you lose, and I can honestly say I know what it feels like but you still need to go through the grieving process, cry when you need to, and from personal experience your baby will be o.k, if you feel like it gets real bad talk to your doctor about it.|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	they say on lots of sites that stress related early labor/miscarriage is caused by death is a family, thats the worst stress you can having during a pregnancy, so id advise you to calm your nerves some for the baby, just in case, thats the last thing you need is the baby to be in stress. Im so sorry for your loss, my husband lost his mom a month before our wedding and his grandma the next year on his moms birthday , we are pregnant now and he still is sad b/c they arn't here for the baby, it'll always be with you but keep the baby in mind right now, im sure your granmother would be very proud of you =)|`|giRRCXU4aa	My grandmother passed away when I was 17 weeks. It is very hard to deal with but you have to find a way. I just thought about happy things. It was so hard for me because my grandma was so excited about a new great grandchild. I have a supportive family and I surround myself with them everyday. Just know that your great grandmother wouldn't want you stressing and she'd want you to be happy. You aren't hurting the baby, but it's no good for you. Life happens and we just have to move on. Sorry for your loss and good luck with everything!|`|E2UXN7J1aa	When my sister was pregnant with her 4th child our dad had a massive heart attack and ended up having major open heart surgery. He came close to dying multiple times and actually did die twice during his first surgery, but they were able to bring him back. He was in the hospital basically her whole 6th and 7th month of pregnancy. On top of that she had the flu and still with all that stress her and the baby pulled through and were ok in the end. She carried her almost to full term.<br>  <br>  Just do your best to not be stressed and don't stress about being stressed! That is only going to make it worse. There was a death and you are not going to be able to be stress free so instead of holding it all in don't be afraid to let it out. Cry, scream, do whatever you have to do, but don't bottle it up. I'm so sorry to hear about this and my prayers are with you. Good luck and stay strong. <3|`|F3ArhTiRaa	My auntie died when i'm also 21 weeks pregnant.  Yes it's hard to be insensitive especially when you're so closed to the dead one.  But you have to, be calm, don't get so stressed up.  Try to think of this, you love your baby and you won't allow things to hurt your baby.
1A1ozEaKaa	Rosalia is such a beautiful name. Rosalina seems italian immigrant circa 1960 and rosalie i personally find to be a bit old-fashioned. Again, Rosalia is beautiful :)|`|Elxuvon8aa	I would go with the ie so a middle name with an a ending would work well|`|1ezYfkX7aa	Rosalia is the only one i like =)|`|776cf4cc9dc31fae3b35bd08e9ead34eaa	I actually like all these names.

aB2zSt6Vaa	I was gassy in early pregnancy too, and usually still have it at least a few days a week. I'm 14 wks along. I don't wanna get your hopes too high, but yes, it can be a sign. You also might just have a small digestive bug that doesn't cause any other symptoms..sometimes we pick them up in certain foods. When can you take a pregnancy test to be sure?    *****Blowing baby dust all over ya!******|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	yes it is, but also of pms|`|4DoXomHZaa	If you've been having it for 1.5 weeks and you haven't even missed a period yet, then no. It would be too early. If you have missed a period, you can test now and the mystery will be over.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Yes, gas can be a symptom but you don't have to be pregnant to has gas.|`|9vgZNLP8aa	It can be.     Maybe you are pregnant. I'm throwing buckets full of baby dust your way!|`|AA12321034	Yes but it could just be gas too.  Home pregnancy tests are very affordable I would buy one and get a definite answer.  GOOD LUCK|`|KozoNqpsaa	It could be. You'll have to wait until your period is due and test if it doesn't start on time! I found this web page and it's pretty good at explaining early pg symptoms:  http://mtbttc.tripod.com/symptoms.htm    Hope this helps, good luck! ***Baby Dust!!***
p2Njf5gBaa	Its both of your child, so you should tell him because a father has a right to know what is going into his child's body.     I agree with you though, name brand doesn't always mean better.  I use generic formula now and its just as good and just as healthy.  Its all regulated by the FDA anyway, so its all safe.      Have two can together and show him that their is no differences and its just as good.  Perhaps even tell him you gave her some and she did just fine with it.  Explain to him that you want to save.  Say this way you could start a saving account for her, and in the long run she will be better off.|`|5tvM9T7vaa	1.) You shouldn't have to hide this from your husband.  You should discuss it like rational adults.    2.) It's just formula.  If you feel that strongly about it and he won't give, I don't really see the harm in switching.  You should expect him to get pretty pissed when he sees the empties in the recycling, though.|`|pXSKSS3daa	"He refuses to buy anything for her that isn't name brand and if I do, he will go out and buy the name brand things and toss out the generic when I am not looking."    Your husband is ridiculous. What is his exact problem with generic brand items? They ARE just as good as name brand, you're just paying for the name brand when you buy more expensive things.    I'd tell him. Show him the two cans and how they compare. ALL formula has to meet safety and health standards so there isn't an issue there. It's silly to think you'd have to sneak around and buy an "off brand" formula when it works just as well and is less expensive. Put it this way, the money you're saving can go towards something else for your daughter like a college savings fund.|`|BW7Nrqjzaa	I would just keep switching them. It's probably even made in the same factory. Similac just pays a lot for advertising and has to charge more for theirs.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	First I know absolutely nothing about formula.  I would assume if they are the exact same, why not.  personally I think thats hilarious.  I wouldn't tell.  why have a fight about something so trivial.  It reminds me of that episode of Roseanne when she took darlenes class on a field trip to the store and she found out mom had been buying her store brand cereal. lol  I would do it.|`|qStmw7qgaa	If he is going to get mad about it, even though it has no difference to similac...then I wouldn't tell him.  Just dump it in the similac containers.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	Clever!! I personally would switch it. I would rather cut some corners and have more cash to be sure that I can continue to provide the lifestyle that is comfortable even in this economy!!|`|kT7GVOosaa	don't keep a secret. the other person always finds out. plus it can be bad for the baby to change formula.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	This what fun to read . LOL.  umm well I personally cant lie.   so what if your hubby goes shopping and buys similac?  I would tell him...|`|2bZCgyGKaa	If your husband is that extreme in wanting only name band stuff, I wouldn't tell him about the formula. If your daughter likes it and it saves your money I see no need to pay the extra money for the same product.|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	the only thing worth hiding from your husband is a surprise party for him or something. if he wants nice things for your daughter let him get them, just instead of 5 brand name thing get 3.|`|BMfn0D9gaa	just tell him with the extra money your saving you can buy her more clothes or save the money and put her in like a private school or like the best day care ever!!|`|OxFV92hJaa	Well would you want him keeping secrets from you?    That's the only thing to think about. If you're ok with that kind of relationship then go ahead. But don't be mad when you discover things he's hidden from you as well.|`|d6GvS2Dpaa	My baby's doctor said that the target brand is just as good, if not better than the "name" brands of formula. I immediately switched and my son is doing great on it.   Call the doctor and get him to tell your husband that it's just as good if you don't want to.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Well he is the father and has a right to know and have a say in what his baby is eating, regardless of whether it doesn't seem like a big deal to you.    So no, I would not keep it a secret from him, I don't see that as fair at all.  I would not keep any secrets from my husband with regard to our baby, and you being the mother gives you no more right to make the decision and keep it from him.      If he is not okay with the generic formula (which personally I would not be, I am just weird about that), then there are plenty of other ways to cut corners or buy generics when it comes to other things.    Think how you would feel if he made decisions with regard to your child and kept them secret from you?  I would not appreciate that and it's sad to me that so many people respond saying that it is okay to do something like that (keep secrets regarding your children).      However, it's not my life so it's up to you.|`|A91e6T71aa	If he is being that anal, then for sure keep it from him and keep saving money.. maybe you should take the 11 dollar... or 33 dollars depending on how many cans you aren't having to buy anymore? and stash it in a separate account?? 33 dollars every week will add up very quickly! just dont get caught!|`|eh8jEYGCaa	There is absolutely nothing wrong with generic brand formula, as long as baby is taking to it well and not showing any signs of sickness from the switch (which she obviously is not). What he doesn't know won't hurt him, and if it's going to get upset about something silly like that, he definately doesn't need to know. He'll thank you later when you have money in your savings account and you have a rainy day.|`|a8b01a0fb0a8883667fbc651eef87747aa	1.  there was a "special" on the news a couple months ago about formula and how it affects babies brain developement and how some have bacteria in them.  why jeopordize the health by using a generic formula?  Please look into that.   2. you shouldn't hide the truth from a spouse.  especially when it involves a child.  Are you considering his feelings or only yours and will it be worth it when/if he ever finds out.   good luck|`|8fl1vEUCaa	I believe you should tell him and see if you can get him to see your point. This may be hard but its his child too. If you believe he would have a problem with it then by all means he should be included in the final decision. I would make the strongest case possible and be prepared for any response he may come up with. Maybe even give the formula a trial period to show him it is as good and the more expensive kind but definitely include him in the decision.|`|AA11626328	What he's doing Is not good.  She's a baby now, but one day she'll be older  and expect ONLY name brand.    I wouldn't mention It, or  you could say she seems to like it better.|`|4t5eGShiaa	LOL. I think you should tell him. My Nathaniel drinks Parent's Choice Gentle (which is the Walmart Generic brand of Enfamil Gentlease)    If your daughter is doing well with the generic brand, just talk to your husband and tell him that it's the exact same make up of the Similac... so why not save $11? Maybe you should tell him, that the money you save from buying the generic brand you could take a nice weekend get-a-way with just you and him. Maybe that would help his decision?!    BTW: I'm all for generic brands!! Save money where you can!! :)|`|WlU3NFu6aa	I dont see why you shouldnt tell him. Its not harming the baby, the baby drinks it fine AND you are saving $. Just tell him. Go "honey, I switched baby's formula to store brand to see how she would take to it. She seems to like it and it is just the same as Similac. here look at teh labels." and let him compare. My daughter didnt like the taste of store brand but if she had, its a no brainer
yqAwWO4uaa	We  have 1 year old twins and during the course of the last year one grew quicker than the other.  The smaller of the two actually went up and down.  Lately he has been going up.  What our Pediatrician told us was as long as his weight goes up each appointment it's okay.  That being said, I don't think your daughter is too small, and as long as she is getting her nourishment and growing you should be fine.|`|r52rfBkeaa	I think your baby is fine.  My son is 15 months and just reaches the 19 lb mark, lol.  He's in the 3% of weight but has been since he was 9 months old.  As long as she's satisfied and you're ok with how much she's eating, she's good to go.|`|264738e6736a5605fe53df0659003e3eaa	She's tiny, but so is my daughter.  She was 12lbs 9oz at 4 months then 15lbs 3oz at 6 months.  she's in like the 20% for length and weight.  Her doctor isn't concerned at all, she said she's perfectly healthy.  I'd just speak with the doctor and make sure all is well and if the doctor says she's fine, then there ya go :)|`|yWi0gWiBaa	she seems fine to me.|`|7J3SMZXcaa	Some babies are just small. My little one was 8lb 2oz when she was born, but has been skinny small baby since. We went in when she was around 12 weeks, and she only weighed 11lbs-I doubt she will even be reaching 12lbs by her 4 month check up. Every baby is different...I get worried sometimes too, but she seems happy. Some days she eats 4 oz at every feeding-and sometimes she just wants 2 oz at a feeding...but she is happy. My mom said when I was a baby my weight was so little, I was off the charts.|`|wTeJulT5aa	She seems fine to me.  As long as she's getting enough formula or breastmilk then you shouldn't be worried.  She's doubled her birthweight, so that's good.  My baby hasn't quite doubled her birthweight yet at 4 1/2 months.  She's 14 pounds now. The doctor didn't seem concerned at all today when we went for her vaccine.

0iUxfCMcaa	im 25wks and the doctor proscribed mucinex for me as well. im doing fine and so is the baby. it helps clear up your mucus build up in your chest and everything so it will help clear up your cough. you need to take more then one dose of it to work. i dont know why the other person thought it works after just one dose. but it is safe to take|`|NPmRmnG6aa	You can always ask the pharmacist if it is safe to take during pregnancy. I had to take steroids for swelling in my foot, I could not walk. The doctor checked to make sure it was safe, but my husband was still concerned so he asked the pharmacist and she looked it up and said it was safe.|`|yCR6qg0baa	You said you called your doctor, but did you actually go in to see him? I wouldn't take ANY medicines until he drew blood or took an x-ray. It sounds like he thinks you have bronchitis. If it is an infection, you MUST treat it with antibiotics or it will get worse. I'm sure the ones he gave you are fine for pregnant women. Have you been tested for asthma?     Sometimes in pregnancy, you don't have the option "not" to take medicine. Sometimes you have to choose the lesser of two evils.    By the way, Mucinex is a decongestant & expectorant-- that means it will *make* you cough until you get all of the phlegm out of your lungs. I get bronchitis once a year & that's always what I use. Works for me. The first person cannot evaluate Mucinex after taking one dose. It takes time to work.|`|5JB1fHz9aa	I bought the store brand of that stuff and only took it once because it didn't help with anything.  No harm to the baby what so ever, but I only took one dose of it.  I called and asked what to take for stuffyness and that is one of the things I was told I could take.|`|phwivaqNaa	Your right, the doctor wouldnt do anything unsafe.  However, I received a list of approved OTC meds from my OBGYN and mucinex was not listed.  I guess you need to take something if it is bad and not going away.  I take something as a last resort.    Mucinex just loosens phelm to make your coughs more productive.  I would ask about something to get it to go away!
kT7GVOosaa	calm down! everything will be ok. if she is pregnant Congrats! of not that's ok too. ask her to take a home test and offer to pay for it. if she takes 2 or more that say negative then you should be good but you can have her go to a clinic to be 100% sure. Just be sure to offer to go everywhere with her because it can be very stressful to have to do it alone.|`|aJTBF7opaa	take a test the doller store carries them and yes they are reliable, i know from experience i have also reserched and they are more affective then some store brands.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	yes you should   take a test|`|o8xNTVWTaa	test to make sure|`|GdSzrtmAaa	WOW!

eHow24rNaa	I baptized my daugher at 2mths old. It doesnt really matter what age they are...my cousins had her daughters baptized at 6yrs old. I did mine early b/c thats when i could get her in to do it. Just do it whenever you are ready to have her baptized...theres no set date|`|VzOokYEqaa	i did it at 1 month. i would of done it soner but i was really sick. you probably should do it asap just in case god forbid something happens to your little angel you want them to be in heaven.|`|AA10503158	My opinion, that's dumb. Religion is up to the individual. Later on in life, when he or she is ready; that's when they should be baptized. 6 months, a baby doesn't understand anything. If something would ever happen to your baby, heaven for bid; God would take he/she in. There's no sense in baptizing baby's.|`|82987c5133eb520901fdacb24b4dafb5aa	I would wait until he or she is grown and ask if he wants to be baptized..why baptize when they might not want to be?|`|qStmw7qgaa	Hey I'm Kassandra too!!.  My daughter was 3 weeks.  The sooner the better in my eyes.|`|3MelQFxOaa	First off, I love the name Cassandra. (could it be why, that is my name, lol)    Second, I just got my daughter baptize last week, and she was 7 months old, the other baby was about 9 months old.    Now my brother, was 6 weeks premature, and he was bapitized in the hospital. I figure at any age, as long as its done, is ok. Although, 6-7 months old is perfect, because there is a better change they wont cry when the water is poured on them. Congrats!|`|de4bdMupaa	To me, baptism is a public profession of faith and should be done after the child has accepted Christ as his/her Savior. I don't understand the ritualistic baptism of very young children. Baptism doesn't mean anything to them or change them in any way. Until children reach the age of accountability, they are protected by God. After that point, it is their choice to accept or reject Christ. Baptism is symbolic in following Jesus' leadership but does not affect salvation.|`|tAYuDzuqaa	98% of the people i know who had babies had their babies baptized before age 1.  usually 3-8 months. so i guess 6 months is ok.|`|FplTPoAyaa	You can baptize your child at any age.  There is no written law.  I asked my pastor the same thing, and he told me "at any age you feel you want to have her baptized".  We had our baby baptized at 2 months.  It is all how you feel about it.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	It depends. There's baptism or christening, and then there's dedication, which is what we did. That way we made an open statement of our faith and that we would raise our child to know the teachings of Christ, but when it came time to be baptized officially, that was their decision.     Either way, you can do it whenever you want. My kids were dedicated at 6 and 9 months, because that was when we could arrange it. I think I was much younger, like maybe less than three months old, when my parents did it.|`|fk7ZA9b8aa	you really believe if you don't baptize the kid they'd go to hell?|`|9Gd231Qqaa	My son was 1 month old when he was baptized, and that was really young.|`|5tvM9T7vaa	Well, I just read that in Jesus' time, babies were to be introduced to the Church at 40 days old.  Of course, before Jesus' adulthood, Christianity did not exist, so I assume this is a Jewish tradition, but I think it's a nice idea to introduce your baby to the Church at the same age Jesus was.  Most children are baptized any time within the first year, though.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	This may vary according to the denomination, and/or tradition in your area or family.  Our son was baptized at just over three weeks old. It's pretty young to do it - usually it would be six weeks or two months old at our church. However, he was born the end of October, and if it wasn't going to be done before the pre-Christmas season (which is a certain number of weeks), we would have had to have waited another two months at least.  It was actually nice to have it done with him being so young.|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	When they are old enough to know what they are doing :)    That's just my personal beliefs, though. Most do it when the baby is very, very young. I mean, a few days old. You can do it whenever you want to though.    *Note: Jesus was brought to the temple at 40 days old. But he was baptized in his 30s at the beginning of his ministry by John the Baptist.|`|JH9IMMDtaa	no, what does it do?!? he doesn't know anything!!!! wait until he reaches the age of recognition! Brittany is exactly right!!!!
IkuZj0Lbaa	They have paint now that it is safe for mothers to be around. Water-based paints are normally safe too. Acryillic paints are ones you want to avoid. Wearing the mask was very smart, but if your concerned, talk to your doctor.|`|foOKenTiaa	its earlier in the pregnancy when you have to worry about paint fumes. she'll be fine. I painted with half my children and they are all normal.|`|iMULlxdgaa	You'll be ok, I helped a friend paint her nursery this weekend and we are both pregnant.  Its ok as long as you do it in moderation and keep the windows open for aircirculation.  Also take breaks every now and then and you'll be fine. As long as your not like intentionally inhaling the paint I doubt it would od much especially if its only like one day or a weekend.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I was around pain fumes at about the same same and Jacob is just fine.

Its good that you wore a mask and that you stopped when you noticed it was bothering you.  I just painted the name letters for my daughter and I am fine.

B7nqTcttaa	Ok so I am a girl but when i first met my fiance we were chatting about names we liked, he said his fave girls name was Mahlia, I thought nothing of it until I met the face behind the name.... an absolutely gorgeous brunette, Miranda Kerr look- a- like! He met her through a friend, luckily for me she was already married but I definitely don't think he would have even remembered the name if she had of looked like Rosie O'Donnell lol!|`|2rOQyvaKaa	I don't. Our family ask the four geeks that are into sci-fi, fantasy, anime, and comic books to come up with names for our kids. They are also friends of our family.|`|BRT2teSqaa	I have always loved the name Natalia.  I dont know 1 person with that name, so I cant put a beautiful face to it.

NpSVEC2naa	wait untill youv'e sobered up, the amount of alcohol in breastmilk is only 2% of your blood alcohol level. it also leaves your system just like it does in blood so there's no need to 'pump and dump', you mite want to pump a bit tho just for your own comfort. <br>  <br>  just remember you haven't drunk for 9+ months so it doesn't take much to get smashed! (i know from experience) and you have a baby too look after the next day and they really dont care how ruff you feel!!!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|FLEXqVoiaa	They say if it's not in your blood, it's not in your breast milk. If you're OK to drive, you can nurse.<br>  <br>  EDIT: What that means is that, once the alcohol has left your blood, it has left your milk. It does not stay in your milk, just as it doesn't stay in your blood, therefore there is no point in "pump and dump." I am well aware alcohol gets into the blood stream-It gets into your milk as well.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Ask your doctor.|`|Emw1PBqXaa	Depends on how much you drink. If you drink one or two drinks then safely 3 to 4 hours. But if you drink anymore or get tanked then I would pump and dump once you get home and then in the morning too.<br>  If I drank I could smell it in my breast milk after pumping. It had this strong sticky smell. Maybe that is just me but If I had anything over two drinks I pumped and dumped once or twice after wards.<br>  I did see they have this new thing on the market that are test strips. You can drip some of your breast milk on the strip to see if you still have alcohol in your system. I never used them so I don't know how accurate they are.|`|wRyX3A7Oaa	Feed the baby before you go out making sure to fill her up. Pump and dispose of your milk twice before feeding her again..... The rule is usually two hours after a drink but if you really drink, be safe and toss it twice....|`|UH9Efl36aa	By the time you have the baby you wont even have energy to go out and drink! trust me|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	If you are sober enough to drive, you're sober enough to nurse, 1 or 2 drinks is fine. If you plan on going out to get plastered wait until you sober up. You will have to pump and dump to keep up your supply in that case. All I can say is wait until your supply is established before going out, about 6 weeks, before going out. That is if you have the energy then.|`|u9sGH0AXaa	Personally I limit it to one beer a month, if that.  I always wait 2-3 hours after that beer,  I am going to wait until she's weined (a year or so)  and reward myself with a vacation with pina colodas.  If you can, please just wait, you don't have to drink to have fun.  <br>  <br>  But, if you must...limit what you have.  If you're sober enough to drive, you can bf.
2WKN9kZiaa	?always remember how much he needs you!! even in those moments when you wish you could be asleep rather than up until 4-5am!! remember that you are his/her everything<br>  ?sleep when he sleeps<br>  ?be considerate of yourself, when you have visit let them stay for 30mins MAX and then tell them to scoot!! it can be very stressful with lots of people around<br>  ?do not worry about house work or cleaning or dishes it WILL get done!!<br>  ?maybe NOW make DOUBLE the food you make and freeze half for yourself and anybody else you have to feed that way your good food will  be ready to thaw and eat rather than eating out every night, plus its more nutritious for you <br>  <br>  Congrats on Baby #1<br>  Enjoy this experience, because having the first baby and being a first time mom and dealing with everything only happens ONCE!!! (duh I know) but dont rush "oh I cant wait till he sleeps all night, I cant wait till he sits" enjoy EVERY SINGLE DAY!!! =D|`|XRLbqtUbaa	Not sleeping when he slept leaving me more tired.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I have to agree with the first poster... getting up at night is the hardest... while the first few nights are pretty easy it only goes down hill from there... by the time my son was about 3 months old I think I could get up, walk to the kitchen, make a bottle and feed my son without even waking up (okay maybe I woke up, but I really got used to it!) <br>  Also it's just pretty nerve racking altogether! It's a pretty big thing to get used to, but mothers usually catch on pretty quickly. <br>  Sleep when you baby sleeps, and remember it's okay to let your house be messy... I tried to hard when I brought my baby home, and rarely got to enjoy just having him there, so mainly just enjoy it, and get as much sleep as you can, sleep deprivation can do a number on you! <br>  Good luck!|`|b1WMcGQ0aa	You'll be really tired and possibly a little emotional. Man, thinking back on my first baby, the time we spent together right after we came home from the hospital was just so special! I really enjoyed it! I was young and tired and basically single (not really) but I was doing it all on my own. My first baby boy just holds this really special place in my heart. You'll melt every time you look at your baby! Congrats!|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	Okay, well it was HELL for me..no one told me babies eat every 2 hours night and day..so when I was getting woken up all night long..I was wanting to rip my hair out and run away.<br>  But she didnt just wake up..once she got up at say 1 am..she was up until like 5 in the morning..crying.<br>  So just be prepared to not geting ANY sleep..and be prepared to hear lots of crying.<br>  <br>  Most babies get their days and nights mixed up..and it normally stays like that for atleast a couple of weeks..for my daughter it took her nearly 10 weeks to figure out night time was for sleeping.<br>  <br>  <br>  ...<br>  lol..thanks for the thumbs down losers.|`|x7vTKP24aa	my dd cried non stop for the first 2 weeks. if you tried to lay her down she wouldfreak out. she wanted to be walked all the time. we had to take turns walking her around. drs said she just was getting used to being alive, whatever it was it went away. she is 5 months now, she still wants to be held, but not nearly as bad as in the first couple weeks.<br>  <br>  oh and she wanted to nurse all the time. either nursed her or walked her for 2 weeks straight.|`|LwJ7EiZ4aa	For me it was night time feedings. My daughter ate every two hours around the clock and I would get really lonely at night obviously because everyone else is sleeping.<br>  <br>  When you bring home your baby just remember to trust your instincts, eat healthy, drink water, and sleep whenever you can. You will be sore and trust me, it is a huge lifestyle adjustment that I thought was a little overwhelming at first.<br>  <br>  Best of luck but I know you'll be fine! :)|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	you wont get a whole lot of sleep the first couple of months.  And make sure you burp your baby....and try to be gentle, dont rock too hard after he/she eats cus of spit ups/throw up... Basically the baby will be doing a lot of eating, sleeping and pooping. It can get stressful when he/she cries but try to put things in perspective..relax, take a breath and make sure you dont hesitate to ask for help w/ the people around you. Talk to your spouse about how you feel...take care of your emotional needs too. This is the time to nurture your love for each other and learn more about your new baby/ get to know your baby day to day.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Expect an insane lack of sleep.  You'll never believe how much that baby is up in the night, and might only be able to sleep when you are holding him or her.  Just try to take it easy, listen to everyone's advice when they tell you to sleep when the baby is sleeping.  And just know that it will get better!|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Well no problems with baby #1!  Lucky me:)  But baby #2 was 6 weeks early and had a really hard staying awake while nursing.  My milk had almost completely dried up with in a week and a half,  I was devastated!  So I started pumping every 2-3 hours during the day to try to get my milk back up.  It worked:)  She is 16 months and I'm in the process of weaning.|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	it is my first baby..and i only live with my husband who knew even less than i did... i didnt even want to sleep because i was afraid the baby couldnt breathe or something since i never had been in charge of a newborn before...i didnt even have time to eat, i ended up loosing 40 pounds in a month, unbelievable but true|`|diEZW57caa	The hardest things for me was being in pain all the time and being alone.<br>  I had a c-section and my fiancee had to go back to work right away.<br>  Make sure you have support people around to help you out when you come home, you will need it for the first few days.|`|J2gr1ogHaa	oh wow, actually my 1st week home, we stayed with my mom (me daddy and baby) and like after day 2, daddy and I slept though an entire day! My mom got up with the baby. Pretty bad, but seriously didn't hear her! But after that, if she wiggles her toes i hear her!|`|4iXL4C6paa	my main problems were getting up at night, not really a problem just hard to adjust to because there is nothing like getting good sleep lol|`|yewpjlDqaa	My main problems were trying to nurse, figuring out a pumping routine, and coping with feelings of jealousy i had toward my husband. He did a lot of the post-birth care for our baby because I had a c-section and couldn't do much lifting, walking, etc. I felt insanely jealous/threatened that he was changing the diapers and picking her up from the bassinet in the middle of the night. That subsided during week two. Being a mom brings out  your protective side!|`|N3jwE76maa	My first night at home I was still trying to breastfeed and he wasn't latching properly so my hubby had to go out and buy some formula so he could eat.<br>  From there the main problems I had were sleep deprivation. my mother in law came over every day for the first 2 weeks and helped to tidy up my place so I could get some rest. I also went nuts over the crying. If I couldn't settle him, I would get upset too since I still didn't know alot about taking care of a baby.<br>  All babies are different and so are new parents. if your normally an early riser or someone who is used to not getting much sleep then its easier. if you someone who loves to sleep in (that was me), then it will be a bit harder. <br>  But as each day goes, your motherly instinct will kick in and you will start to get used to alot of different things that got to you at first.<br>  Good luck to you|`|lEGq1nzoaa	During my pregnancy I was never sick and the second I went into the hospital to give birth I came down with a cold. Since I was so sick I had a really hard time producing any breast milk. That made our first week really hard. I was so stressed and my baby dropped a pound in her first few days. I ended up having to just formula feed. The sleep issue was not hard for me. I was so excited and nervous that I didnt even notice the bags under my eyes. Looking back I was tired but it was so cool when she would wake up. I just wanted to fuss over her! You can never know what to expect since all babies are different. Just take that first week to get to know your baby and soon you will know what it needs whenever it makes a noise. And make sure to ask if your doctor or hospital has an advice line, they are so helpful for new mothers.|`|8396838b128e2966c0c31ebdd32d0f49aa	you are not going to get a good night's sleep for about the first six weeks or so, so rest up now!   First week is a lot of feeding, changing diapers and listening to crying.  This will be all day every day, no breaks!  Unless you have help and are planning to formula feed.  In that case you might be able to nap more that I did!

ffAmoqFTaa	You should eat lots of fruits and veggies, and you also need lots of protein!  Stay away from fish, if you do like fish talk to your doctor and they will tell you what ones are okay to eat.  There are lots of different prenatal vitamins you can take, if you have a hard time with them Flinstones vitamins are okay.  Good luck and congrats!|`|la1KlgJ3aa	You should be taking a prenantal vitamin with folic acid. not flinstone. Also why do you want an iron pill? Are you anemic? You should ask your dr if you need to be on an iron pill. There are certain foods you should avoid while pregnant: http://pregnancy.about.com/cs/nutritioni...  Congrats and Good Luck!!|`|ueDqd80daa	Talk to your doctor about the iron pills! I got a prescription from mine and it's a multi-vitamin.. Really cheap... I think I only paid about $9 for a whole bottle!     And as for foods, stay away from caffeine! it's really hard, I know! I've heard one serving a day is ok but I wouldn't over-do it! Also, lots of fruits and veggies! Stay away from uncooked fish and spicy foods!|`|WPI0Z47saa	You need a prenantal vitamin which contain iron. If you don't have a prescription plan then walmart sells a brand that is only 5 dollars for 144 pills.|`|tRUoj8cPaa	For vitamins and iron pills better consult your gynecology doc.    if you are not allergic to any of the following then its ok    good for baby--- yogurt, milk,  fresh and dry fruits, vegetables, not too much sugar and salt, chicken breast, margarine, fresh fish, cheese    Bad for baby--- coffee, tea, prickles, alcohol|`|wObmwK1uaa	You can eat practically anything you like as long as it isn't raw fish or eggs, i have also been wondering this and got a book from the library about it. it really helped me and it might help you as well good luck x|`|BPzi7pDgaa	Well... um... congrats on your baby coming soon i hop u have a blast with them! My sister was pg too and she was eating healthy foods and sometimes things that she used to eat before she was pg, anyway she had a nice and healthy lil' boy. And i am proud to say he's livin healthy than ever, i love my nephew with all my heart!!!! Congrats on you bunddle of joy!!!!!!|`|Def3uk2aaa	Prenatal vitamins are better, that's what they're meant for. Children's vitamins won't do any good.|`|01vMpHkWaa	you should take prescribed prenatal vitamins  they are full of folic acid, which is what you need  you shouldnt eat spicy food  and dont eat alot of junk food  look for things with fiber, your going to need it.....!  lots of fruits and veges. stay off the red meat often and not so much seafood.     pretty much stuff people shouldnt eat anyways....|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Um...try pre-natal vitamins.  Might be a little better than flinestones vitamins.  Makes me really question your age.|`|NjL6UlRwaa	any kinda vitamins would help.folate is very important for the baby.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	As for food check out the food guide pyramid. Stay with healthy choices. Fruits and veggies are better than chips and candy - you get the idea here!! As for the vitamin you really need to call you doctor. If you are unable to swallow the prenatal because you are gagging on it they will have options for you.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Flintstones are ok, but it is better for you take a prenatal vitamin. They are specially designed for pregnant women. Giving them what they need. Especially Folic Acid. They already have iron in them as well. Just eat sensible. Veggies and fruits. Get your calcium with cheese, milk, yogurt..etc. Your Dr will give you all this info. on a paper for you to refer to when you are home. Foods to stay away from are, excessive tuna, raw eggs, and uncooked meats. Even lunch meat, bologna, and hot dogs all have to be heated before eating.    If you are worried about the cost of prenatals, you can get a bottle at walmart in the vitamin section for about 5 bucks. It will last you your whole pregnancy.|`|4aLyt7qVaa	You'd probably be better off talking to a doctor than to us...|`|eHow24rNaa	When I was pregnant the only thing I stayed away from was sushi. And about the iron pills...my doctor ended up prescribing me some but when i took them, i would get sooo nauseated so i stopped taking them. She told me that taking the Flinstone Vitamins with iron was okay. I was anemic when i was pregnant and she said a chlidrens vitamin with iron in it was okay to take.
zSABr7praa	The doctor will get a good idea of how far a long you are by going by the date of you last period.  Also, if he does an ultra sound, he will get a good idea (sometimes very early on they can't find the embryo, it's too small!  Don't worry, it's common!)  Your doctor will give you lots of information, just write down any questions you have and bring them with you.  I was scared my questions would sound stupid for some reason, so I didn't ask any until I got more comfortable.  My 14 week appointment took forever because of all the questions I had.    "The girlfriends guide to pregnancy" and "what to expect when your expecting" are GREAT books!  Best of luck and congrats!  (Ps, the dr will tell you to lay off caffeine, it's easier the earlier you start.)|`|cfdooGylaa	He will do a pap smear, take your urine, check your pressure, take your blood to test for STDs, take your weight, and go over your medical history. You will be prescribed prenatal vitamins if you are not taking them already. Ask your doctor any concerns and questions that you have regarding the pregnancy. You should also ask your doctor what are his C-section rates. Its a really important thing to know. Gather a list of other questions you will ask because once you get to the appointment all the questions you have might be completely erased from your head due to anxiety. Good luck and congrats!|`|oRr9SOIqaa	Time to break out the (nonalcoholic) drinks!|`|ORluWHGAaa	Are you gonna keep the baby?|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	yes, they will most likely do a vaginal ultrasound  please make sure you be completely honest with the doctor.    they will most likely do a pap smear.  start prenatal vitamins!|`|SnanuNKiaa	go to www.thenest.com, thats where i went first when i first got pregnant. they have an due date calculator, gender predictor, also check www.whattoexpect.com this site is based off the books, and babyzone.com has a very accurate day by day calculator.     Start taking prenatal, ask the dr if you might need prescription strength prenatal, and also ask him to recommend a few prep classes to go too.    your first appt will be pretty long, they'll want your whole medical history.  check the sites out, there are many answers to be found|`|66957620bd1615f49fc1cf11b832c145aa	Be happy,another step forward in life,free your mind from worries,and  hope for the best.|`|mxixfE3Raa	He will ask you for your last period date, and he will determine a rough idea of how far along you are. He will then work out when you will be 8 weeks roughly , and this is when you will have an appointment with a midwife.  He will tell you everything you need to know, also you should buy a pregnancy book, this will give you advice on any queries you may have throughout your pregnancy.  Start taking folic acid supplements/pregnancy vitamins and make sure you're not smoking and cut down on alcohol.    Good Luck|`|4fCjH7iWaa	They will want to know the date of your last period. Make of list of things you want to know. Ask about a any birthing classes your dr. recommends. If your dr. wants you on vitamins you will get a prescription so your insurance will pay for part of it. Ask about over the counter meds/supplements before you take any. If you are healthy and things progress according to normal you will go for a check up once a month. If there are any health issues or concerns you will go more often.|`|qLkknQx1aa	babycenter.com is a great tool to use. i used it with both pregnancies, it has q & a's and groups to join so you can chat w/ other expectant mommies. - congratulations.  it's nerve racking and exciting at the same time!!!|`|H2ciLJoPaa	If you don't know when the first day of your last menstrual period was they will most likely book you in for an ultrasound to judge how far along you are. Also they'll do a blood test which will show how much of the pregnancy hormone you have in your blood and this is usually a good indication of how far along you are. Definetly get yourself a good pregnancy book and start reading NOW!
eya1WDS4aa	Yeap. I would have spanked her when she bit me.|`|5ed83c89437f484069b18bb91d4b595daa	I have a four year old.  He doesn't get spanked often (lots of threats) but if he bites well, he has one coming.  Especially mom or dad. Lying- usually a time out, though it hasn't seemed to stop it. <br>  <br>  Every child is different, as is every parent. Do what you feel is right.  And pray for guidance. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|G9TocOkAaa	i agree with the one answerer...i would have spanked her the instant she bit me.|`|umGi6gTcaa	I think that since you asked this deep down you don't feel you/he did the right thing.<br>  <br>  Why did she want you in the first place? Do you give her enough quality time?<br>  <br>  She is old enough to obey, though next time instead of telling her to be quiet find out what she wants. Is she yelling because she's hurt or just lonely? Maybe next time you can set a timer, tell her when it rings it's play time but until then you need quiet to work.<br>  <br>  Also why was she locked up in the kitchen? Isn't that like the most dangerous room in the house?!? Maybe if you can deal with a small amount of distraction you can have her work in the office with you. Let her draw besides you or give her some "Important" papers for her to put in alphabetical or numerical order. She'll be very happy to help you and it will save some sanity on your part.<br>  <br>  I'm on the fence about spanking. My daughter is only 2, so far I've threaten her with it numerous times but only implemented it once when she kept trying to climb on the dresser. Even when my husband is in the right I'm not to thrilled with his threats of spanking, I couldn't stand for my fiancee to spank MY kid.<br>  <br>  Even at 2 time outs and verbal reprimands work for Jade. I'm betting your daughter was bored/lonely, which is when kids tend to act up. Keep her busy and maybe she won't resort to biting. Which was just a power move on her side since she feels so powerless.|`|9BeGtZAiaa	First off, please stop talking to the kid like a cave man, otherwise she'll talk like a cave man.<br>  And the moment my kid would start screaming for no reason I would put a stop to it ASAP.<br>  And so help them God if they ever bite me, well to me your girl got of lightly.<br>  With kids you need to be consistent and the consequences of their actions have to take place immanently and they have to 'shake them up,' so they realize that certain behavior will not be allowed.<br>  But it sounds like you are having conflicting parenting issues.<br>  You have an issue with how he handled something, talk to him about it.<br>  It doesn't matter what we say here because we don't have to live with you.|`|ocNUYENRaa	I am not for spanking, but I've done it once so I'd be a hypocrite if I put you down for it. It sounds like your daughter is wanting attention. You may think that spanking has corrected the behaviour (for those who say, look it works) but what you've probably done is temporarily stopped it in it's tracks. You still haven't gotten to the root of the problem. <br>  <br>  Your daughter was obviously missing you. Maybe next time you can say "Katie, Mommy has to work on an important project. I expect you to not interrupt me. When I'm done we can __________." It might help to set the timer. If she doesn't obey loss of priveledge (not your company when your done) may have to be put in to effect.<br>  <br>  I JUST finished reading The No Cry Discipline Solution by Elizabeth Pantley. A great read, I strongly recommend it.<br>  <br>  Good luck. It's a tough job. Don't let anyone judge you.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yeah,if all else fails,a swat on the butt may be the thing that works.|`|m2aznd8xaa	its okay as long as it never gets out of hand  , gets to rough ,or leave any marks.sometimes when you start to spank it gets too common in the home  just keep it to a minimal and only if its a last resort.
G9ywiLqvaa	i have 2 boys and i would think each would represent a different 'all boy' category.  <br>  allow me to explain.<br>  <br>  my 5-year old is the traditional, macho all-boy --hyper, loves soccer, runs-jumps-cartwheels like the wind, loves cars, rockets, planes, explosions.  he also loves playing the guitar and is all rock star about it.  he hates girls.  period.<br>  <br>  my 7-year old is the romantic, old gentleman all-boy --he paints and sculpts and gives them to me as gifts.  he pulls chairs for the girls in class.  he walks them to their cars.  he has a different 'girlfriend' every school year.  oh yeeeah...he loves girls, girls, and girls!!!<br>  <br>  yeah, so they're both all-boys.  lol!|`|T3BXC8qXaa	I have two boys and two girls.

Xngq54vBaa	Before you freak out, stop and give the teacher time to respond and explain the assignment.  Try talking to your child (are we talking about a little guy or a teenager here?) and find out what they are using the account for.  In World History, I can think of penpals in sister countries around the world, e-mailing drafts of writing assignments, technology throughout history units, etc.  Did you read your child's Technology Use policy and proceedures document for their school?  All public and most private schools have them, but parents often sign the student handbook without actually reading it.  At my school, it is the policy that students may only use technology when supervised by a teacher and we have filters on all the computers, so the only problem with an e-mail account would be when he is checking it at home when you're supervising him.      I'm not saying that you're wrong to be upset to have heard about it this way and the teacher should have sent a note explaining the assignment or the use of e-mail for classroom communication, but communicate with the teacher first before getting too upset and going around the person.  How would you feel if a friend of your child's relayed something that happened at your house to a parent out of context and instead of talking to you and giving you the benefit of the doubt, that parent went around and told everyone what a horrible parent you were?  Work with your child's teacher... most teachers are doing their job because they love students and want to help them learn.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	How old is your son. If he's in middle school their probably going to do pen pals or something similar with a class in a foreign country. The accounts are probably going through the schools system which will already have security in place. Your son will most likely only have access while he is being supervised in the classroom setting. The world today is online and the sooner kids start to navigate in it the better they will be prepared for the future.|`|Yz1pzloSaa	How old is your kid? If he's, say, an 9th grader, you're probably the one being unreasonable. But if he's a 5th grader, then that teacher is crazy and doesn't know what's good for the kids. In that case, you should call the teacher and talk to him/her.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	contact the principal, a letter should of went home for permission|`|tPOvhDOVaa	That is all that you possibly can do. But I agree with you. It wasn't right for a teacher to give a student an email account with out the parents permission. And my question would be what is an email account for world history?|`|AA12071655	I would point out to the teacher that while the internet can be a useful learning tool it is also many other things. As a parent it is your task and responsibility to guard your child from those other things. Just as a parent's permission is needed to take the child physically out of the class room (as with a class trip to the museum) so to should a parent's permission be obtained for taking the child virtually out of the classroom.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	When you pick him up from school today go in and speak with the teacher. Stay calm but let her know that it's a rule of yours that your son not have email accounts that you don't approve of first. Then ask her what the assignment or project is about and what names she had the kids create accounts under. If she has a good explaination, like the class is communicating with students in another country or some other valid reason; just suggest that she send permission slips home next time she wants the kids to be on the internet for emailing reasons. If you don't think the teacher takes you seriously then go to the principal. I'm sure that it just wasn't something thought about by the teacher and she just thought she had really great interactive project for the class.|`|drI1vsJdaa	I think you've done all you can do. How can an email be for world history? They didn't even HAVE computers until the 90's.|`|JsaEk8UAaa	Because you have emailed the teacher I would give her 24 hours to respond. At the end of the 24 hour time frame I would be in contact with the principle. I would be having a major problem with this myself. I would also be looking for some information about kids safety on the internet. Have things ready to back up why you have strong feelings about the email account and know what you would like done to resolve the issue. Good for you for holding the teacher responsible!!!|`|rqHKbubraa	It's probably because will be doing research on the internet for the project and then they can email the teacher and partners on the project the info they found. It may just be a intranet email, so that it's only used in the school. The teacher has her reasons and will take all safety precautions.  Try not to freak out until you have the whole story.|`|jN3pRKkEaa	She should have sent all the parents a note home that had the email address and password on it.  That is totally inappropriate.|`|GUswFG2Raa	IM sorry but i feel that your over exaggerating . Its for class DUH. When I was in 7th Grade My Teacher made us do the same thing in math. We made emails on gmail. then we Had a class group and it had homework resources and such. Then you could post on the forum ask for help and then the teacher or another student can respond|`|JdqDauEDaa	Just wait for the response. If she doesn't contact you, call her on the phone. If she doesn't respond, call the school office and have your call forwarded to her.     I don't think this is a matter for administration yet.     Many schools require that teachers send out permission slips for these kinds of events, but some do not. Did your son get a syllabus for the class? A syllabus is required in many schools. Or at least an outline saying what is expected and what will be covered. If his gmail account is through the school, it will be closely monitored as many school computers have tracking devices.   I'd start with contacting the teacher-by phone and I wouldn't be too concerned. Teachers usually monitor their students pretty closely. They are given training on internet danger.|`|hmTVcteoaa	I think you may be approaching this from the wrong angle.    How old is your son?  If he is in high school and doesn't already have an e-mail address, then it is probably because it is required to function in most elements of modern academic society.      If the teacher wants an assignment turned in by e-mail, and many history teachers do, then it will be impossible to do that without an e-mail address.  Turning in assignments via e-mail means not only a lot less wasted paper, but it is also considerably easier for the teacher to quickly respond with what the student can do to improve and for the student to fix it.  Most history classes involve lots of paper-writing, so this is VERY relevant.     The teacher might also be having the students work on a group project.  Many classes use online programs, such as Blackboard, to allow students to upload their work so that their classmates can download it and help out.      This is standard practice in many colleges.  It is so that the students working on a big PowerPoint presentation can research what to put in the slides seperatley, and then put it all together via the Internet.  They can come in and meet together to practice the presentation itself, but they don't have to waste time on meetings that don't really contribute anything.    Since your son (presumably) isn't in college his school likely cannot afford something like Blackboard, so a free e-mail account, like gmail, is an attractive alternative.      Besides, e-mail accounts really aren't something to be afraid of.  E-mail is really just a much more effective and inexpensive version of phone communication.  If your son doesn't learn how to use e-mail now it could really hurt his chances in the  business world later on.  Its just like how the kids whose parents don't let them use computers or who grow up in Third World countries never learn how to type.  The result: they are not marketable and have a VERY hard time getting a proper education later and/or a high-paying job later.    In any case it really isn't particularly difficult to set-up a gmail account. If your son really wanted to use one for nefarious purposes he could just make one himself in five minutes and never tell you about it.  Since he told you what happened I really don't see a problem.  Its just e-mail, its not like he can meet anyone on gmail.  He'd be more likely to get into trouble with a phonebook!
MHOxPs8Oaa	Hmm... Because he isn't real family you won't watch him for money too, but you will with your real family. Seems kind of selfish to me. Maybe you shouldn't have got with your husband if you can't accept that being your family too.|`|nVQGpvuoaa	Tell her you just don't have the time and the only reason you offered the babysit your neice is so your sister doesn't have to pay because she doesn't have enough money. I guess its kinda a lie or a "true" face with barley any details because she doesn't need to know those.|`|gJrHBtp1aa	If its your SIL's kid, then he is your nephew and part of your real family. You are married to his uncle so you are his aunt.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to watch the boy then just tell her, Or make up an excuse like you really don't have the energy to be running after a 5 year old.|`|P4LBygv2aa	well honestly , you are being selfish.<br>  she is not trying to take advantage of you , she offered money , no matter what the amount, and a 5 year old is not that difficult to watch.<br>  as for REAL family , that's not right in so many ways.<br>  I'm not trying to be mean but that's just what your doing, being mean.<br>  tell your hubby the truth , the little boy will be so much better being where he is wanted and not where he is invisible.<br>  how do you think he feels?the little boy?<br>  tell him he is not part of the family and laugh at him , feel good about yourself ? <br>  someday your niece could be apart of a blended family , how would you like them to treat her ? not real?|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I see a few options.<br>  <br>  1) Wussy out.  Watch her kid and deal with him being a brat :(<br>  <br>  2) Tell her if you watch him, you need to be able to discipline him.  Meaning if he does something bad, and you put him in timeout, spank him.  Whatever the case may be, she needs to back you up, and she needs to reinforce your rules when she's at home with him.  If she doesn't agree, then say, sorry no deal.  If she really needs the help, then it would be the right thing for you to help her.  But that doesn't mean you should be burdened by it.  <br>  <br>  3) Tell her your already watching your niece and it would be hard for you to watch 2 kids.  If you don't already have children of your own, this could be the truth that you just don't know yet.  lol  Watching two kids is much different than watching one.   <br>  <br>  4) Tell your husband to say no for you lol   <br>  <br>  You would be surprised how different kids will act with other adults.  They may be a complete nightmare while mommy is around because mommy lets them be a nightmare.  But as long as you enforce your own rules, he may be a really good kid around you.  You could always say yes, and do a "trial run" for 2 weeks.  ( I say 2 weeks because it takes time for kids to learn they can't push you around) And if its not working out, just tell her.  Sorry, I thought I could handle both kids but I can't.  Give her a week to find someone else to watch him.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Say this, "I am already taking care of my sister's daughter and right now that's all I can handle. I wish I could help you out but I'm sorry, I just can't." It shouldn't be a big deal and you have nothing to feel bad about. It's okay to say no just because you don't want to - nothing selfish about that, it's the way you feel. Then have a talk with your husband and ask him to check with you in the future before he volunteers you for things.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	I would have to tell her that if the children come over, they obey your rules and you discipline as necessary!!!  Put it up there up front.  If she agrees, discipline the child as need be.<br>  <br>  Or, you can just say that the little girl is quite a handful and you just don't think you can take care of both of them.  That's it.  You've said no.|`|jLYTKr33aa	I'll try look past the fact that you don't like an innocent 5 - year - old.  At that age, children behave the way they are taught to do so.  If the boy misbehaves, it's because his parents haven't taught him to behave appropriately.  So really, try not to dislike him.<br>  That said, simply tell your SIL that you cannot handle two children right now.  "Sorry, but I really don't think I could manage them both" should suffice.  Repeat as necessary, and don't let your family bully you into watching your nephew against your will.  Good luck.

When I stopped it would still leak once in a while for like a year after tho and that was a bit annoying!|`|nuTvB84Gaa	Its normal for some people.<br>  But NEVER try and pump it because that can cause early labor!<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Mine started at around 18 weeks actually, so yes it's normal.|`|SM4xIodaaa	Yes, it is normal =)
esGTdnC0aa	well take legal action against your mother because you are over 16 you have more legal rights as you can legally live on your own, not as many rights as when you are 18 but enough protect you.

Z8Ui1ugLaa	It's hard to answer this question, you should speak w/ your pediatrician, especially since your baby is a preemie, I'm sure that every move he makes can be nerve racking.  I do believe that seizures effect the whole body, so along w/ the baby's head jerking so would his arms and legs, maybe he's just getting startled easily while he's trying to fall asleep.  Good Luck|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Renee, you need to calm down and look at yourself, not your baby.    You've asked four questions on here so far.

IT IS COMPLETELY NORMAL!<br>  Why care about losing your virginity to peer pressure?<br>  Stay pure until marriage.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Yes it is normal.<br>  It's normal at 21. <br>  Society puts a label on us and if we are still a virgin at a 'certain' age, something is wrong with us. I beg to differ.<br>  Losing your virginity should come when YOU are ready. Mentally. Physcially. Psychologically. Sexually. Emotionally.<br>  The maturity level at 16 doesn't quite make you ready. You are stil a child. Enjoy being one. Don't worry about sex right now because boys your age will only care about getting into your pants.|`|EHQCkDaqaa	Yes... I think that being a virgin at 16 is smart! when you start to have sex, it really changes everything about your relationships & friendships.. and you can never get it back. I know that it sounds corny or whatever, but i really wish i had waited longer and waited for that special person instead of giving it away to someone who didn't appreciate it.|`|NYJgiVxraa	yes. u dont want a baby right now.|`|xhnvAqDwaa	Yes, it's good im 16 and i have been with my boyfriend for over a year i'm still a virgin, all my friends have had sex before they were 16<br>  and they may not regret it yet but they will, just take your time you don't want to rush into anything to quick!!|`|mUIMF3hnaa	It's totally normal don't rush it it's not worth it.<br>  you should be proud of that.<br>  hold onto your virginity until you're really ready to give it to someone you love.<br>  you don't have to wait until marriage just try and give your virginity to someone special.|`|Nt1Tz3zuaa	of course its normalll there are people that are virgins into college, just wait for your time and dont rush it. i have a friend thats a sophmore and her boyfriends a senior and its only been a week that they've been going out and shes already thinking about having sex with him because of the pressure, him being 2 years older than her. honestly i think she stupid because you should do it when you think the time is right not someone elsee. i hope this helps!!|`|q20gVmLyaa	Wow, you must be kidding me. It's smart and responsible and most definitely normal. It isn't normal to have sex and be under age though.|`|E4yN11Efaa	Yes- be proud!<br>  It's a VERY good thing... And smart, too. It's common sense, dignity, and self-respect... Unfortunately, it's not common now... =\|`|SqrYOiK7aa	I waited till I was married.  It was the best thing I ever did.  So to answer your question, yes its very normal.|`|nQDjnhliaa	Yes, thank god someone can keep it in their pants!!!! Congrats on having some dignity and common sense!!!!! You shouldn't have sex until you're ready for the consequences like kids.|`|UfOP3xtcaa	Yes, stay a virgin until you are married to the man of your dreams.|`|sDAnuaBYaa	Yes, it is normal.|`|DT6EXkVzaa	Yeah its normal.  Im still a virgin|`|IEZoHcysaa	Yes and its awesome|`|CHpNkeAgaa	Yes!!!|`|Av9jeRAkaa	yes, it is, you should be proud!|`|5tqh0akYaa	for today not really. but honestly you should be proud that your not pregnant at this age! its best to wait|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Its normal to be virgin at any age...Ppl have strong beliefs and some are waiting to get married and some are also waitng for the first time they fall in love...Its quite normal to be 16 and a virgin..Dont rush sex..be a child because sex were made for adults who are financially set for the consequences...<br>  My life can be your example...I lost my virginity at 17...Got pregnant at 18 and i am now 19 with a baby boy... <br>  Like I said..Dont rush sex..hold out as long as you can..wait until you are married so that can be a special moment btw you and your spouse..But if you dnt want to wait that long...just make sure you are in love and willing to start a life with this person..Because once you give up your virginity, you cant get it back!!!!|`|JgDRKLuLaa	It should be.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yeah,I was.|`|5ZKqU2sIaa	YES!|`|HJbZHS2uaa	uhm.. yea.. that's a pretty pathetic question|`|S2LjGZC1aa	yep, its normal... it's a little something called: having your dignity.|`|DhZ5smpWaa	Sure is, and a good thing too. Don't let pressure get to you, it's perfectly alright.|`|4iXL4C6paa	It is normal, and very very smart|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Yes, and it's smart.|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	Yes and it's a good thing.|`|uF28jKqZaa	yes its the best choice and way to go|`|mlFaQ1LPaa	untill u;re age 20++ still a virgin, its normal too..
HEdGGmkhaa	It depends on what kind of cycle you have, if you have a typical 28 day cycle, most women with this cycle will ovulate around the 14th day from the first day of their last period. If you have a 29 day cycle it will be later, 30 day cycle, later still....get it?<br>  <br>  I would not look into it very much, keep an eye on it, hey at least you are ovulating!|`|UfhE3k1baa	I didn't do the math for you, but I will tell you this. It is "normal" to ovulate about 14 days after you start your period. However, I took all the tests, from CD 9-17, and they were all negative. I also had a blood test done on day 21 ( it is a clomid thing lol) and it was low, basically I did not ovulate. I am 6 weeks pregnant. I obviously ovulated very, very late in my cycle. Each woman is different, so please chart your own for several months, if you do not get pregnant quickly that is, to learn what your body does. Good luck!|`|fbWfvjkWaa	That is only if you have a 28 day cycle. I ovulated on my 21 or 22 day because i had a menstruation cycle of 33 or 34 days. So yes that can happen.|`|fec699811ba6e1b0d043374af7afd151aa	Nope your most fertile days were feb 5 - feb 9....<br>  try using <a href="http://www.mymonthlycycle.com........." rel="nofollow">http://www.mymonthlycycle.com.........</a>|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Your ovaries can't read a calendar.
JvbvGtrBaa	me too, when i wasn't eating much ealier in my frist trimester i swore i could too! it tickled for sure<br>  i am eating alot more now so i am digesting so much i wouldn't be able to feel it but back when i had morning sickness and couldn't eat a thing i swear i felt that too! like around my 6-8 week <br>  i'm at 14 now but i havnt felt the tickles since then. all i feel is digestion but when the baby gets bigger then appetite i'm sure i'll feel it.|`|QSodlfMraa	yeah some times, lol i love it.|`|n3IoftMFaa	Yes, I found it creepy when I could actually feel their little fingers or toes wiggle.|`|R21aV2mLaa	lol yes!! its the greatest feeling ever its so precious!! i will be sitting at my desk at work and he moves like crazy and it makes me laugh!! lol i love it!!|`|OVMb4V7Maa	Yes, and I thought it was so cute. That only happened with my daughter though, not my son.|`|pVaZty4Maa	yeah, i miss feeling how it felt when my lil man was inside me.....|`|wRyX3A7Oaa	I Always thought it felt like what I imagine a fish would feel like swimming around your belly splashing and making waves....|`|ig0klGBXaa	yes and i thought it felt awesome dont you???

D35xKICoaa	some thing went wrong with the doc test try the blood test the next test you do.|`|YLgdMXiQaa	I would go to a different doctor or maybe try a couple home pregnatcy  test|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	EPT are highly sensitive tests. Just because the other test was done at the doc's office doesn't mean it was necessarily better than your EPT. I'd bet you're pregnant because you have to have pregnancy hormone to get a postive at all, and the only way to get that hormone is to be pregnant. As long as you didn't recently miscarry or give birth, you have the preg hormone due to a baby in there. Buy another test and check again. False positives on those are very rare.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Have a blood  test done. The urine tests the docs use are the same as what you buy in a store.    It's also possible you are having a chemical pregnancy...the egg does not properly implant, gives you early +'s, then negs, couple days late....then it starts.|`|qFmOuXMXaa	Same thing happened to me....I would go get one more hpt and if it's positive.Then you are.     good luck|`|mgiJVjaKaa	False positives are extremely rare.    Did you check the pregnancy test in the appropriate amount of time? If you waited like 10 minutes, then the reading isn't accurate anymore.  If you followed all the instructions for the EPT correctly, then ask for a blood test at the doctor's.    Good luck!
FS8n1FUQaa	It looks and sounds like a pretty name, but she will forever be correcting people that pronounce it iss-lah.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I think it is kind of like the name Ian once you know you do not mispronounce it.  frankly I do not care for it just because it looks odd|`|igvUbqkyaa	It is okay - it just seems like a weird name to me. I LOVE Elizabeth (although I prefer the spelling Elisabeth)!!!|`|E8kzNG3iaa	It's gorgeous!<br>  <br>  I'm considering Ivy Elizabeth, which is quite similar :)<br>  <br>  Once you tell people - the S is silent, like in island - I'm sure they will understand the pronunciation.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Yes! I love the name Isla Elisabeth.|`|tHEBPDenaa	i think it's really cute. i also like the name ayla (pronounced how it looks).|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	Eila Marie is one of my very favorite names in the world!!!!!!!!!|`|WCNpfXNnaa	I love elizabeth but isla makes it sound more like "eye-lah-lizabeth" and I also find it hard to say.<br>  I would consider something more like:<br>  Carmen Elizabeth<br>  Margaret Elizabeth<br>  or Cassie Elizabeth<br>  I would suggest you chose a name that DOESN'T end in a vowel or a vowel sound because it does make the name some what of a tongue twister.|`|ln0wLqZhaa	I personally don't like it , but it's ur child :) <br>  <br>  And the reason people have a hard time pronouncing it is because  B4 i read how to say it i thought it was ( Is-La) <br>   some people don't no when letters are silent and when they are not .|`|UWx1beYtaa	I work with a lady named Aisla pronounced the same way.

U only get symptoms after implantattion.<br>  <br>  Lotsa baby dust to u!!!!|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Anything is possible, stranger things have happened.
L8eNBQelaa	it could happen with precum but the odds are very low. you probably are late for your period because of anxiety that you are pregnant. go and take a test if its negative you should start soon. everytime i think im pregnant and im late as soon as i take the test within the hour i start my period.|`|77NzfiVkaa	It is possible. ANY time you have sex it is possible no matter how much protection you use. Especially if you aren't on the pill, it is possible.|`|yjhpBM11aa	PRE *** ! You can get pregnant with his pre ***. You could be pregnant or you could be just stressing your body out and making yourself late.|`|SM4xIodaaa	Look up pre-ejaculation... yes, you could be pregnant BUT stressing over it could also cause your period to be late. Take a test and good luck.|`|5p0AW33jaa	with the broken condom you could possibly be... i suggest you take the test.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	If you are late for your period than take a pregnancy test!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Yes, you could.  Test tomorrow with your first morning urine.|`|fec25f298a046824d209e22ca386b7f1aa	It is possible, all men have a little bit of pre-*** (small amount of semen) that comes out during sex and well before a man ejaculates. If the condom broke, it could have gotten into you.  Take a pregnancy test, if it is positive, call your doctor and have them do a pregnancy blood test to make sure it’s a "real" positive reading and not a false one because of stress or other factors that can give you a false reading.|`|EUTRJqCsaa	yes. something DID come out of him. it's called pre-ejaculation. which does in fact, contain sperm. guys can't feel it, it's just something that happens. so I'd be taking a test if I were you.|`|ig0klGBXaa	Stress could be causing you to be late.  Quit stressing and go get a prego test it would be enough time to tell on a home test now.|`|cJeSIgJdaa	Anything is possible. I'd be taking a test!|`|J2f5ZzSnaa	Yes, you could. Take a test, jeez!!!

My mother is having a baby shower for me on march 1st and were doing it just the girls and no men or kids. But if she invited you then i would go =)|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	It is 'traditionally' just for women/girls yes. But if she invited you,then go,just be prepared for lots of girly,baby things.|`|AA10953561	Traditionally baby showers were for the women, since it was such a "delicate" issue. Now days though, it's not just for women. After all if men can help in creating the child, then being in the delivery room, why shouldn't they be a part of the celebration? I'm planning on having lots of men at my baby shower. My boyfriend, my brothers, my father, many of my female friend's significant others will be there as well. I see no harm in it.<br>  <br>  Go have fun. After all she's your best friend!|`|2WWEn2mZaa	Considering baby showers are given because of the baby then nothing wrong with guys being there. After all Daddy is a guy and should be included in the celebration.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	never -it takes a male to create the baby.|`|6zeZwQL6aa	There are no rules for parties like this.  It's up to the expecting parents to do whatever they want to do.<br>  <br>  My BIL and SIL had a co-ed baby shower.<br>  <br>  Besides, since other guys will be there, then go.  As long as you're not the only guy there.|`|Emw1PBqXaa	Nope not anymore. You can totally have guys at a baby shower.|`|wRyX3A7Oaa	In the words of my husband, you don't buy all that food for the women... It's a read between the line invite for guys... Men need support too!|`|dfa6d0f0b22bf152d8e2859840f823b1aa	I had a coed baby shower at a mexican restraunt. Everyone had a great time, and my husband got to open gifts with me...after all it was his baby too!!|`|KS25J1dBaa	i've gone too 3 baby showers and i'm a guy but all 3 where for my kids but my guy friends go too|`|7fPuUT3Daa	no its not as much i had a few guys at mine =) its fine
bAp35x7uaa	Oh yes, tons of the stuff!  I feel wet down there all the time and am going through panty liners like there's no tomorrow.|`|01vMpHkWaa	yeah its usually white and more of it    it sucks  and its gross|`|QYYWBrG7aa	I have alot more discharge now that i`m pregnant.its annoying so thank god for pantie liners.    Edit:Mine was never like 'Jelly' it just as done turned kinda watery.sometimes i think i`m leaking pee.lol|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	yes, discharge worsens after pregnancy    ummm i dont know about jelly like discharge...  mine - sorry if too much info - was clear odorless  and for some reason (*i have asked my doctor) turned yellowish|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	discharge and cervical mucus definitely seem to increase in pregnancy, don't worry. Alot of women who track their fertility by checking their mucus get confused when it lasts several days or weeks, and often it's because you're pregnant.|`|SnanuNKiaa	more likely you could be ovulating. i know when you ovulate you release an discharge that is the consistancy of egg whites. I haven't experienced Jelly consistancy stuff yet, and truthfully i hope i don't yuck! but if you are pregnant, just think, this discharge this is just going to get worse. it doesn't let up.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	yes u do still get it and in fact it can be more than usual due to the hormones.|`|WPI0Z47saa	You get all kind discharge while you are pregnant.|`|Zb7AGTwAaa	Yes you discharge up until your 9 months pregnant.|`|iWrXIWcPaa	yes! ive had the same thing throughout both my pregnancies. towards the end of pregnancy, the discharge got thicker but stayed the same milky, clear color. near the end of pregnancy its actually your mucus plug (the technical term starts with an "L" but i dont know how to spell it). supposedly your mucus plug can either come out in one chunk or gradually in little pieces (slimy strings) during the last month or two.|`|mc6YtaRbaa	Yes, you get more discharge when you are pregnant. Right before your first missed period you will look almost like you are ovulating again. That will continue throughout your pregnancy.|`|YtSGbYqEaa	yes im pregnant and get that real bad it sucks big time|`|rURYaq45aa	yes im pregnant and i have so much discharge i thought it wasn't normal until i asked my doctor she said it was very normal. she said not to worry and just try using panty liners
rhPCJfeuaa	I am so sorry for your loss!!  I can't even imagine.  I give you kudos for getting up every morning to be present for your other 3 children.  But, the time has come when even you can see that giving in to their every whim and desire is just setting them up for heartbreak down the road.  The world just doesn't work that way.  It can be cold and uncaring, so the death of their sister will only matter to those that love them.  Not their teachers or employers, and certainly not for long.  You need to give them the tools to deal with disappointment while they are young.  There is so much that can be taught.  How to persevere if it's important to them, how to be patient and save up for something, how to discern what they truly need from just a passing whim.  These are all important traits they will need to get through life in one piece.  You know deep in your heart that it's best to set limits or you wouldn't even be having these nagging doubts.  Listen to your instinct.  Your children only have one mother to tell them the truth.  They will have many "friends" throughout their lives to kiss their rear ends and just make them happy.  Usually because they need something from them.  You are the only one who will love them unconditionally and will tell them how it is simply for their own good.  That's why God made you mommy and not one of their classmates.  What you all need is some family counseling to deal with the death of your eldest daughter.  Once you know that your other children are emotionally well, you won't feel the need to overcompensate by giving in all the time.|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	I think you are all using gifts as a substitution for what you really all need.  You need to know they are ok, and are getting past this and are buying them gifts because it buys short term happiness.  They need love, compassion and a way to deal with their loss and fear and are wanting gifts because it makes them feel better in the short term.  None of this is dealing with the real issues, either you should consider therapy or just keep talking about it with them.  I'm sorry for your loss|`|nVQGpvuoaa	I think you should stop spoiling your children. I'm sorry for your lose and at first I guess it was ok to spoil them a little but if you keep spoiling them they won't take no for an answer in the real world when they are older and that might be bad.|`|JDxpjT34aa	I am so sorry about your eldest daughter. I don't know how I could ever deal with losing a child. I know that your children (and you) will always be traumatized by what happened but you still need to prepare your children for the rest of their lives. Spoiling them may be easier for you to do right now but you need to think about how it will affect them in the future. How will they be able to cope when they are adults and they can't get everything they want? They'll need to learn to be able to cope with getting their feeling hurt because it will happen in the real world. Sheltering them from it now will only make it harder for them in the future.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	In the long run, ya, you are probably teaching them that people will give them whatever they want as long as they feel guilty.  So they will grow up quilting people into giving them what they want.  <br>  <br>  To be honest, I'd probably be in the same situation if that happened.  After losing a daughter I give you credit for just going on!  <br>  <br>  If you think they are taking advantage, say no.  They love you because your their mom, not because you buy them things. Good luck!  I'm sorry for your loss...|`|aAOgJvjSaa	To answer your question. Yes you are doing more harm than good. No one really can blame you given the circumstances. You do need to set boundaries though and start saying no.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	YOU have been through so much, not them.  Children are very resilient and many don't remember alot from their childhoods.<br>  You are doing them a BIG disservice giving in to every whim. <br>  <br>  I think you need to go back to somw parenting classes and forget (in this regard) about their sister.  It has no part in the equation of their behavior.<br>    <br>  Though, if they still are traumatized by the accident, then family counseling is necessaru.   regardless, I think you need counseling in relating to your other children.|`|ee30c12fc32e951b85fac3bf9bc65f25aa	My condolences to you and your family.  Spoiling your children is not going to help them get over the death of your daughter.  No one is going to spoil your children when they get out in the world, so you may be setting them up for disappointment and failure.  I would see about taking them and yourself to counseling.  Telling your children no isn't about hurting their feelings or not. Eventually they will be told no by someone and they need to be prepared.|`|RD05jXYwaa	the most important thing you can give children is security and that is found in discipline and boundaries if you have to ask you must be doing it wrong. tmm|`|4qyMF86iaa	i think you just answer you own question. maybe you should get  consulting
NYJgiVxraa	i think you have a harmful acid that has been released into ur stomach. get that checked. i heard it can travel up ur espohagus, and thats not normal. ur stomach usually the juices in it protects u from it. one of them probably released.|`|Py3XJc8saa	it really might be from the energy drinks, you might want to cut back on them and see if that helps.. it might also be from stress, or nerves.|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	You're not supposed to drink energy drinks if you're not doing any intense physical activity.<br>  <br>  Stop drinking those for a while and see how you feel in a week or something.  If it persists, go to the doctor.|`|SxgOy9uPaa	Think you might be "OD" on the caffeine,which is what most of these energy drinks are..MEGA amounts of caffeine,which gives you a real jolt..Try just plain water for a couple of days,with glucose sweets that you can suck on..Bet you feel better real quick..
Y0Mo0OLyaa	hi|`|8396838b128e2966c0c31ebdd32d0f49aa	Periods can be late for a number of reasons such as stress, late ovulation, etc.  A negative test at this point is not very hopeful, but a woman's cycle is not always exactly the same every month and if she still does not get her period in a few more days, take another test and it may show positive results!|`|5p0AW33jaa	of course there is! she might have taken the test too early for the kit to detect her pregnancy hormones. try taking the test again in a week or two if her period doesn't show still and be sure to use the first morning urine. good luck!|`|hwZMijykaa	It definately sounds like she's pregnant! *fingers crossed* I would wait another day or two just to make sure her cycle isn't just a week or so late and then take another HPT. If it still reads negative and she really thinks that she is pregnant, I suggest going to the Dr. and request to get her blood drawn. Maybe she doesn't have enough HCG in her bloodstream to read on a urine test. Blood pregnancy tests are more reliable than the urine.<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust to the both of you!<br>  <br>  BTW ... make sure she is using her first morning urine when taking a HPT. AND try not to drink a lot of water the night before b/c water dilutes the urine, which can make it harder to read HCG levels!
S4DNQkFraa	That's how I felt...If you're not too sure or are concerned, talk to your doc about this. Good luck!!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yeah,to some degree. I would more lean towards the cramping if anything. The others really depends on the woman and how her body handles the rise in pregnancy hormones.|`|f858ecf4de718b7fb5e2a81c2598e330aa	all those thing are normal the entire pregnancy|`|PYafv6gSaa	yes its all the same symptoms|`|fbWfvjkWaa	yes. i do
sxx6u7sXaa	I would suggest waiting two weeks. Sometimes tests can be accurate 5 days before you expect your period, but if you test early, there is a greater chance of a false negative.|`|zSABr7praa	I took a pregnancy test two weeks after my husband and I started trying (because my boobs were SO sore).  I hadn't even missed a period.  Low and behold.. pregnant!  I wouldn't suggest taking it so soon, because it can give you a false negative.  I would wait a couple weeks, your test will be MUCH more accurate.|`|AA11865529	It takes at least a week for the egg to implant. That's when the hormones start showing up, but it takes time to get strong enough for a positive test. You should probably wait three weeks after you have sex.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks after possibly conceiving will an at home test be accurate.<br>  You can get a value back and start testing at 2 1/2 weeks and repeat ifthe test is negative.<br>  Good luck!!|`|OVMb4V7Maa	It's most accurate if it's after two weeks or later.|`|2VNuWkzvaa	you can take a blood test as early as 8 days!!|`|ig0klGBXaa	about 4 weeks|`|njhtRBZYaa	wait ten days
SJx9IWWtaa	She was 4, but her birthday was only a month 1/2 after the school year started.  So she turned 5 quickly.   <br>  <br>  Her school tests all kindergartners anyway before they are allowed to enroll to make sure they are ready to be in the classroom.|`|AA10943329	they turned 5 six weeks after starting. In Australia kinder is for children who turn 4 before April 30th. I chose to wait another year before sending them so they were not the youngest. Kinder is not school here. It is pre school. <br>  The first year of school is called Prep (most states) and kids can go the year they turn 5 before April 30th , So mine were almost 6 (they are March babies). Our school year starts in Feb|`|AA10738539	5..............|`|ff700543f3408186155eccc4290362b5aa	Usually the age is 5. I started when I was 4. My birthday was in October, so I turned 5 pretty quickly after I started, and the school allowed it . The only thing was, all the kids in my grade had akready been 5 for awhile, and  as we got older, they started things before I could, like driving when they hit 16, Going to 16 and over club to dance etc. It felt bad that I wasn't there age. <br>  If you wait too long, your child will be older than everone else, and I would think that would be weird too. When you are young, you don't need anything to set you aside from everyone else. Schools encourage you to stick to 5. Now, if your child may be  slow in some way, speaking, bathroom readiness, etc. You may want to hold them back but don't wait too long. Schools hold testing for kindergarten to make sure the child is ready.<br>  Good luck!|`|2xkbOv23aa	5|`|4iXL4C6paa	5|`|fGMmSOxAaa	Here (Ontario) formal schooling starts with junior kindergarten the year you are 4.  My December baby was 3 years 8 months when he started and it was a hard first year.  His school board did full day, every day, kindergarten and he was so tired I had to take him home some half days just to make it bearable.|`|juXQJJrXaa	I STARTED WHEN I WAS 5, BUT MY DAUGHTER STARTED WHEN SHE WAS 4, AND THE OTHER DAUGHTER, AND MY SISTER ALSO STARTED WHEN THEY WERE 6.. I EVEN HAD A COUSIN START WHEN THEY WERE ALMOST 7!  HAVE YOUR CHILD START SCHOOL WHEN THEY ARE READY.. DONT RUSH IT.. KIDS HAVE TO GROW UP SO FAST THESE DAYS..   ALSO.. IF U WANT TO HELP YOUR CHILD ALONG, BUT DONT THINK THEY ARE READY TO START AT AGE 5, TRY HOME SCHOOLING FOR  A YEAR.,. YOU DONT NEED A DEGREE TO DO THIS.. I DID IT FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE WAS TOP OF HER CLASS!  SHE JUST WASNT MATURE ENOUGH TO START SCHOOL.|`|irLnPW4aaa	my daughter was 4 years 10 months (here in CT the cutoff is that you must turn 5 by Jan 1 of the year you are in K, so you can start at 4 years 9 months)<br>  <br>  my son was 5 years 6 months.|`|m84Ml3Opaa	If your child has a late birthday, like a birthday past the cutoff date, he/she may be a year older than 5 when starting kindergarten.|`|ZZMkENyeaa	5, but I've known many parents who wait till the child is 6, I've seen a few parents send their child at 4, it all depends on your child, and whether or not they're ready..|`|IoQF4g1Gaa	Alexis & Angie started when they were 5. Max & Emmie are too young to start school yet lol!|`|1SoBeTzVaa	i was five (im currently 13) but my sister was four (she has a september bday)|`|PumDOQC9aa	My son just stared  kindergarten and he is five.|`|cJeSIgJdaa	5 1/2
ETx0TldCaa	i had nausea alot i just wrote up one morning and once i smelled food i would run to th bathroom and then i missed my period|`|yjhpBM11aa	Missed Period. Different smells made me nauseated. Cramping like I was about to start my period. Fatigue. Tender breasts.|`|R21aV2mLaa	honestly its totally different for all people, i was not feeling anything until i was 5 weeks pregnant and thats when my morning sickness came to me and thats when i knew i had to go to the doctors cause i was sick and thats when they told me i was pregnant and i was 5 weeks! good luck!|`|GyRIM1Uyaa	For me personally, I had no symptoms. The first and second week of pregnancy is the mitosis stage and with home pregnancy test it shows up as negative so most of the time most women dont even know they are pregnant at this point.
lGuM37sGaa	What is most worrying is that you are seeking medical advice from Yahoo answers instead of asking your doctor.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	if ur dr said ur fine then dont worry. he could just have ur due date wrong|`|SM4xIodaaa	Do not listen to the guy that answered in number2. That is rude! <br>  <br>  Do not be worried! If your dr is not worried about anything than you are fine. They know what they are doing. I was measuring 4 weeks ahead at one point and then caught up and had a 7lb 15 oz baby. <br>  <br>  Hope you have a great delivery! =)|`|ig0klGBXaa	don't worry and if it was a reason for a concern the Dr. would be sure to look into it.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Don't be worried. Mine is measuring 2 cm ahead. There is no worry or concern at all.<br>  <br>  Happy pregnancy!
L8eNBQelaa	my cousin had this done and she ended up having an emergency c-cection. i personally wouldn't do it. the best thing for the baby would be to have a c-cection. think of all the trauma it would go through to be turned and then be born vaginally.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I have seen one done and personally I would rather have the c-section.  I would rather have a scheduled c-section than to have an emergency one.|`|XD42367paa	My sister had an ECV and was prepared for it to be painful and bad and uncomfortable. She went in, her OB did it and she said, "is that it?" She said it wasn't painful at all and not at all what she was prepared for. She was also greatly releived. <br>  <br>  And the booger stayed put until he was born. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|S8x3eHQhaa	My son was also breech (butt down) they wanted me to do the version thingy but they also explained that it could result in compliction such as the cord wraping around the babys neck or we could go through the procedure only for the baby to turn again and have a section anyway. My son was born via c section and was perfectly healthy. What's more I'm 34 weeks with my second boy and he's breech too turns out my uterus is shaped sideways . So if you have a sideways uterus you will be going through that for no reason. Good Luck either way cesarian is not as bad as you think.|`|zSpFXIrfaa	thanks for the 2 points :)|`|SnU8rQBkaa	no|`|YHUk1jTMaa	try to get the version done sooner. it's easier to turn a smaller baby. But really its not a big deal they just push the baby around and he flips around on his own. If your really worried they can give you  pain meds to relax you wile they turn the baby.|`|URpJodMLaa	Go with the C-Section.<br>  It's less stressful for you and the baby.|`|ig0klGBXaa	sounds scary
AA11865529	There are DNA tests for it. These sites have some information on testing.|`|U1RcZjqJaa	I've never even heard of it so I'm guessing a no!|`|ig0klGBXaa	my dr. did a test on me to check for any type of birth defects when i got 20 weeks prego. I don't remember the name of this test but maybe that will help you a little bit.
0FXVTZf7aa	The problem with "abstinence only" is the propaganda that goes against the use of condoms.  They tell people condoms don't work, etc.  While I agree with religious conservatives who want to teach the youth to wait for a while on sexual activity I strongly disagree with their message that a condom is a provision for sin.  I send my Christian friends to the website below because it debunks the whole thing against premarital sex in the Bible.  That way they have no excuse not to support comprehensive sex education.|`|wnkoTEqVaa	i was taught both but the problem is you say <br>  <br>  "Abstinence is not having sex" you kind of covered everything.<br>  <br>  <br>  America does not have 3 billion people living in it. its more like 250-300 million. <br>  <br>  there are only 6 billion in the world|`|kRaVa0Wraa	thats not how it is all over the united states...just to let you know.<br>  it's decided by state.<br>  my state teaches how to use contraception.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Sex is EVERYWHERE!!!!!  12 year olds are wondering if they're pretty, sexy, enough for the boys!!!<br>  Just saying no doesn't work when you think EVERYONE is having sex!!<br>  Kids are emailing pics of their genitals, their boobs.  It can't be stopped only education can help.<br>  STDs, pregnancy, etc needs to be addressed with condoms and birth control pills.|`|AtTxzYXbaa	My school mainly teaches abstinence. That is actually all they really teach. I think its very wrong. Saying 500 times every day "you will save yourself for marriage. you will save yourself for marriage. you will save yourself for marriage" is going in one ear and out the other.|`|XD42367paa	I'd hardly call an average of 41.9 births in a thousand a "serious" problem. (These figures are for 2006)<br>  <br>  And according to this article, abstinence isn't the only perceived reason for the slight increase in teen pregnancies. In the last two years, we've been subjected to Jamie Lynn Spears, Juno and Bristol Palin. A bigger factor may be that unmarried childbearing reached a record high, increasing almost 8% in one year and jumping 20% since 2002. The biggest increase in unmarried childbearing was among those ages 25-29 — not among teens. <br>  <br>  Seems an example of sorts is being set...<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009-01-07-teenbirths_N.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2009...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007-12-05-teen-births_N.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2007...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT- There are no countries with 3 billion people. China and India each have around a billion, but no country has 3 billion.<br>  And I realize you were discussing teen pregnancy. The reason I brought up the higher rate of out of wedlock births by women older than teens is becuase it may be influencing the increase in teen pregnancy....you pointed toward abstinence only education being the problem...I'm pointing out other factors, of which an increase in out of wedlock births in older women may be one.|`|eevOrwypaa	at my high school, we are required to take a health class as sophomores students. In that class, we had a unit on STD's. My teacher showed us pictures of alot of STD's and it scared most of us. My teacher also said "Abstinence is the only way to prevent pregnancy and std's. But I am not going to sit here and preach to you about not having sex. If you want to have sex, you will find a way. My goal is to have you educated about sex, and the consequences of sex."<br>  so my teacher didn't really teach abstinence. But she could have spent more time discussing sex. She didn't teach us about abortion, or how to use a condom, just to use a condom if we decide to have sex.|`|NHIQl6VTaa	Teens will be teens. If you tell them not to do something, they are just going to go run and do it. They need to teach all methods of contraception, so that teens know how to protect themselves. That will decrease the pregnancy and birth rate...It's important that teens know how to protect theirselves anyways.. so that way if they don't feel comfortable talking about it with a parent, when they do have sex, they'll know ways to avoid pregnancy, along with how effective/ineffective each method is.|`|mUIMF3hnaa	In my high school in MA I was taught about all kinds of contraception devices.  And I think that it's really unfortunate that other schools across the country are not taught the way we are, but even though the south has the highest birthrate it is not the highest pregnancy rate.<br>  because up north it's so liberal more abortions are performed while in the south more pregnancies go to term.|`|cicyiuiXaa	condoms, day after pills, "the pill" which prevent pregnancy from happening, shots, surgeries<br>  <br>  where did this abstinence program start?  can I sign up?|`|aPIuc7V6aa	i do not think abstinence should be taught since people are going to have to have sex anyway, they should be told about contraception so they can be safe
J2gr1ogHaa	my bf and daughter use to take showers together, they did until she started noticing,..things. She's 2.<br>  <br>  <br>  i believe it is still acceptable because its a bonding thing, and it makes things faster! I would still encourage them to shower together because it is fun for her. My little sis takes baths with her too. I think the best age to stop is when the child is ready to take baths on her own. Its not like they take a bath together every night! Just occaisionally.|`|260846950242e261586201427ac13235aa	My son is 13 months old and he notices a difference. He stares at me down there and goes to touch me because he typically takes a bath with daddy. And if I take a bath with him, he is always going for my nipples to pull at them (I think because I weaned him 2 months ago.) I think whenever your husband feels it is time to stop because of how your daughter is reacting- he should stop. Good to ask these questions :)|`|AA11703652	It's perfectly okay...until you feel like it's not,  I don't mean to be obtuse, but that really is the answer.  Your daughter will not find it at all strange, but when you, or the dad does, it will be time to stop.  Every family is different.  As far as a BABY goes, male or female, it's just a bath!!  My kids (both male and female) see me dressing and their dad, too, and we make no big deal of it...boys and girls are different; so what!?!   Anatomy is VERY different from sexuality...|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	i think if you do that you should wear a bathing suit... i know some people think its ok but the truth is i remember my dad doing that with me when i was a child and i was only like 2 years old. i remember what i saw down there and it sticks in my head<br>  <br>  why would someone thumbs that down? its just a memory i had. f off you jew bag. it is a horrible memory to me and i shouldnt have to suppress it because of you.. i was stating my opinion, geeze|`|b1WMcGQ0aa	Yeah, it's just a bath....So why in the hell is it necessary for the man to bathe with his daughter or mother with son? Just f'ing wash your kids. there's no need to strip down and bathe with them to bond. Sorry, that's just f'ing weird.|`|2674548b6a4c9cdbb098044c58c7af7aaa	My daughter showers with her father still and she's almost 3.  She knows that Daddy has different parts, but she hasn't asked any questions so it's not an issue.  It's a personal decision and other people's input is not necessary.|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	No I really think this is inappropriate.I am a Mother of a Daughter and my Husband has Never took a bath or shower with her.

Some people think it's dirty because it's a grown man bathing with a little girl - but there is a difference between bathing with your daughter, and bathing with a random strange kid. <br>  <br>  When people say that it's creepy and inappropriate, they are entitled to their own opinion. But would they think it's creepy and inappropriate if a mother bathed with her son? <br>  <br>  Children learn the difference between girls and boys at a young age. I would much rather my child was learning it at home wtih her parents than at daycare or school by sneaking in the bathroom playing "I'll show you mine if you show me yours".|`|m84Ml3Opaa	I don't think that its o.k for dads to take baths with  their daughters. Most males have bad feet and that's not healthy.If you do allow this I think that it should stop around the time children begin to notice that daddy has something different than I have and start grabbing towards these different things. You know kids are curious.|`|CZEj3mYBaa	It is Ok, I think, until the baby starts to remember stuff.  You should definitely stop by the time the baby realizes that male and female bodies differ.|`|EJl2RvDfaa	My husband  will barely change diapers much less take baths with her. <br>  <br>  I think its a little weird even if hes the dad. So I think any age is a good time to stop|`|13a4553edcd55e39e57a5e00dc71c8edaa	I don't think so.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Why  wouldn't it be? I take one--as a woman--with my son. Unless dad is a pedophile or gives some reason for concern, I don't see any problem with it. Stop when he or she feels like she is too old to take a bath with daddy.|`|AA10325228	It depends on how old she is... but I would definitely stop once she is aware that boy and girls have different private parts|`|sEqc7oaxaa	Yes it is ok for him to do that, but in my opinion he should stop when she is about two or three years old. <br>  If your daughter has an older brother or sister sometimes siblings bath together until they are five or so.|`|OHfZFR31aa	If it was a mother bathing with her toddler son, people wouldn't have as much of an issue. It's really sad when people only think the worst of a father being with his daughter|`|sw2R5A9iaa	of course -why does this have to be dirty??  the children usually stop around age 5.  this is great bonding for the entire family.|`|n3IoftMFaa	I believe they say to stop at 2 years for opposite genders and up to 4 or 5 for same gender.
amF2572Aaa	I know this may sound bad but if he watches you pour the juice in his sippy, this could work. Fill an empty juicy juice container with water and when he wants something to drink pour the water (from the juicy juice container) in his cup. We do this to my niece and it gets her to drink it everytime. Pretty much a fake out.|`|ccnH77SOaa	At that age I gave my son two bottles one filled with juice and the other filled with water.  But when I noticed that he wouldn't drink the water bottle- when I watered down his juice I basically made it mostly water and only put enough juice inside of it to color the water.  As long as the water wasn't clear he drank it but it was so watered down it was practucually water.  <br>  <br>  Now that he is two I give him juice for only meal times and snack times and through out the day I only give him water.  It was hard getting him to drink water but when he understood that he would only have juice for meals he understood that this was the only drink he was going to have until his next meal.|`|PCK5bJt3aa	I had this problem with my daughter too, and even now she just turned 2 and still wont drink water..But..she loves juice..so every time we give her juice we water it down, as in 50 juice to 50 water ratio..just enough to not completely lose the sweet taste..it was the only solution to get her to drink more water and not notice it.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	keep the cup filled all day.  dilute juices with water.|`|umGi6gTcaa	she/he's a baby so just offer water instead of juice or once the daily milk/calcium requirement is met. My daughter took an interest in drinking from my straw (I try to only drink water, though I love soda!). Plus if you can skip the sippy cup and go straight to a straw it's better for them.
JvbvGtrBaa	planned parenthood. or go to the doctors to get your blood drawn|`|IFDfpbFJaa	If you got two positives on the clear blue then you're probably pregnant. Congrats! call your doctor now and get a blood pregnancy test to confirm.|`|W1p6LetFaa	Did it say in the instruction if two lines for the clearblue meant pregnant?  If so, you got two positive tests.  Positive tests are usually never wrong, it's the negative ones that can be wrong.  I bet you are pregnant.|`|QCUPeW8aaa	Two lines normally mean you are pregnant and clearblue is a test that works on less hcg than other pregnancy tests.<br>  If you want toeliminate all confusion go out and buy a clearblue digital test it simply says "pregnant" or "not pregnant" so you don't have to try and read lines...<br>  Good luck|`|ig0klGBXaa	on the box of the prego test it shows what is what, look at that then if your still not sure go to the health department and get a test done.|`|6NCQbyUHaa	I would say you are! But go to the doctor to confirm. GOodluck|`|cJeSIgJdaa	EPT tests are not that reliable in my opinion.  I had better results with the dollar tree tests, and the equate ones from walmart. It sounds to me that you are pregnant...Congrats!|`|fbWfvjkWaa	Well, 2 lines means positive so i would suggest if you are late for your period to call and make an appointment with your Ob-Gyn to get a blood test to make sure. Good Luck
SJx9IWWtaa	You might have overreacted on the phone.  Maybe because your were hurt because she sounds like she wants to see her friends more than you? <br>  <br>  I would figure out the real reason why you were so hard on her, and then think of the limits.  Try talking to her again, and let her know that you really want her to spend time with you and family, not JUST her friends.   <br>  <br>  At 17, most kids are allowed to go out with their friends.  But they also have things like curfews.  Or if she comes home drunk, your find cigarettes on her etc.  She needs to know you won't just over look it.  <br>  <br>  So maybe say she can go out with her friends, but lay out some rules.  And then lay out the consequences if those rules are broken.  <br>  <br>  You don't want to keep her on too tight of a leash, but don't give her enough slack to choke herself with either.  Talk to her dad.  What rules does he have for her now?  Maybe just sorta use his rules?  <br>  <br>  *Also, there is a good chance she doesn't respect you. And you know why.  It will seem hypocritical of you to say she can't drink and party, because of your past.  And she will most likely throw that in your face (what can I say, she's a teenager they take what dirt they can get and use it!)  So be prepared.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nVQGpvuoaa	I'm not 17 yet, but I actually expect my parents to let me be pretty Independence at that age. Just because I see its the pattern in how 'they raise kids' But I think you should have days where she has to stay in and days with her friends, just let her hang out with who she wants really. ok I understand, drugs and stuff is bad...but if she really wanted to keep doing drugs she would do them at her dad's house too.|`|UMRdHuuVaa	No offence intended, but aren't you being a little hypocritical?<br>  Up until so many months ago you were drinking, partying etc - and thats what your daughter saw, so now you are telling her she cant do any of that - and cant see her mates.<br>  How do you think she would react?|`|692c8795f68a0ba95a0d09139d70c98caa	When i was 17 i had to be home by 11pm, i was not allowed to go to parties, and i was not allowed to be unsupervised with a guy.  All my friends had so much more freedom then i did, and i thought my mom was the strictest meanest mom ever..  BUT i am 27, have never tried drugs or cigarettes and didnt have my first drink of alcohol until i was 19.  My friends that had parents who let them go out to parties and what not, have all done drugs, a handful of them got pregnant and a few are alcoholics or addicted to drugs.|`|AA12190953	Wow I was in your exact position a couple years ago with my daughter. I had abused drugs and ended up in jail 3x due to bad ua's, so of course i ended up in treatment. As a result my daughter was bounced around from my mom's, my sister and my cousin. When she came back home she expected me to be the same as I had been while i was using. And due to parenting classes that i had taken during treatment I learned how to handle situations instead of ignoring them or overreacting. She tested me a lot!!! My goodness did i get frustrated!! I think i did pretty well in not letting her pull me into old behaviors. she was 16 at the time she came back home (had been gone about 7-8 months) she got a job and was doing ok in school. I gave her a lot of freedom, her curfew was 10 on weekdays and 12 on weekends. I think its a very fine line but you have to let them live their lives she will only get bitter if you try to force her to be with you and i guarantee that if you do force her to be with family it wont be quality family time because she will just have a bad attitude. if its a birthday or holiday however that is different. but i would give her a curfew and do things that you know the whole family enjoy doing together and invite her. And i think its better if she is able to grow closer to you instead of being forced to be with you which could make her even more distant. Hope this helps, if you need more help on this let me know. My daughter is now almost 20 and is married to a nice boy that didn't believe in sex before marriage!!1 That was a surprise, but she is well adjusted and happy.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	you know you caused this problem by not raising her with a clear head. she has her own path now. and it might be a bit frightening. i would still put limits on her. she's 16 and she would like to hang out with her friends, sure. but she's gotten into a bad pattern of activities that are harmful. going back to doing innocent things (that can still be fun) will be more of a challenge for you now. you can offer to have her friends come to your house or drop them off at a mall for a few hours or a movie - but i would keep very close tabs on her. show your love by giving her limits. you can apologize for not being there for her but explain that you are looking out for her now and that is all you can do. if she insists on breaking rules at your house, i wouldn't hesistate to send her back to dad - and work on your own stuff. good luck.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	I don't care if she was 13,15, or 17.<br>  I would still put restrictions on her. You are her mother remember?<br>  As far as letting her hang out with friends. Why not? She is at an age where socialization is very important <br>  Yet since you know that some of her friends are doing things YOU don't approve of, then I would put restrictions on that. <br>  You are the boss. Regardless of your past mistakes, you allowing her to do what she wants is not a postive way to make up for the past.  There are other ways to do that such as spending time with her more and being more in her life. <br>  Tell your daughter that although you want her to hang out with her friends and have fun, you have rules and she is under your roof. She is to respect them.
eevOrwypaa	no, it happens to the best of us :) especially if its in a boring class<br>  just don't let this halibut take over. <br>  if you're having problems with this, try concentrating on different things, such as the class and what your teacher is saying. Just have a strong will power to fight your urges and you'll get over this stage soon. Just have a little self-discipline :)|`|xWfrA3vqaa	There's nothing wrong with that.<br>  I do it all the time when I get bored in class. <br>  It makes time go by faster.  Doesn't make you a freak at all.<br>  It's just hormones.|`|7MKmxkjlaa	HAHA!! i do that ,,, all the guys in one class ... and whos the hottest XD But its different guys every class LOL its happens when im bored.|`|rRfV3Pmuaa	ur not a freak, maybe sexually active?  <br>  <br>  and nex tyme bite ur tongue or ur cheek or pinch urelf and remind urself to concentrate. <br>  <br>  try sitting in the VERY front of the class so no1 is infront to distract u|`|urs9AxiGaa	Its called puberty<br>  Its normal, just don't act out on each one of these impulses. : )|`|XwyR8uHCaa	?|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	i don't think so|`|0cM2pYk2aa	Lol, that's similair to what my friends and I do. We rate guys :]<br>  It's pretty normal, and they do it to us too :]<br>  I have inside information from a guy that rates girls and has a the whole 7th grade 'list'!|`|cicyiuiXaa	No, it's just your hormones making you horny.  that's where the word comes from, so it's not a big deal.  when I was young...yeah, same deal, except it was the girls turning me on cuz I'm a dude.  girls get it too|`|Ueo8QBPsaa	No worries, your not a freak! Its totally normal for that to happen. Me and my friends do it all the time.|`|vzcXt2Dsaa	Estrogen, dear :P<br>  <br>  It's just the way girls are wired.|`|LR6y3uBAaa	lol|`|o1wrdVwoaa	Honestly, I don't know why you would <br>  even bother to ask this question. <br>  It's call a crush.
OLpWRv2uaa	yes it's normal.. You know, I have a friend who lactates all the time. She comes to Anatomy class with milk/colostrum everywhere.|`|zSABr7praa	GOOD FOR YOU!  It's very normal.  I'm a little bit envious of women who start lactating soon, i'm really excited to breast feed.  Best of luck!|`|6kWsM5LEaa	ur normal!|`|W1p6LetFaa	Lactating or leaking?  It's very normal to leak colostrum, a yellowish pre-milk substance that your body produces before birth.  You milk does not come in until AFTER the baby is born.  If you are leaking, buy some breast pads to put in your bra.  It's perfectly normal!|`|RD05jXYwaa	you are good to go girl .go easy on the stimulation you want a full breast when the new one arrives but you don't want to drown her with a squirt of full on milk at the onset. tmm|`|W4mXcYu9aa	only thing that isn't normal is lactating before pregnancy. or something.|`|89b9b79c918cf6555bea31d3d7be7d94aa	very normal, i started to lactate at 12 weeks, i would notice small wet spots on my shirt when i was home and not wearing a bra, by the end of my pregnancy i would have to wear nursing pads because i would leak so much and would sometimes hand express the colostrum to relieve the pressure. my husband wouldn't want me to lay next to him at night if i wasn't wearing a bra because i would leak through my shirt and get his shirt wet also lol, isn't pregnancy wonderful!!!!|`|PZODV3QQaa	This is normal. ever woman has there milk come out at different rates, just be glad you have milk! tat happened to my sister, not fun when she had the baby|`|OVMb4V7Maa	Totally normal, Hun.|`|ig0klGBXaa	completely normal|`|G8OFN3uyaa	It's normal.|`|JjUBlGWmaa	it can happen really any time in the 2nd or 3rd trimester
G8OFN3uyaa	I think he has congestive heart failure.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	follow up with his specialists and wash hands better.|`|B24W8w43aa	It sounds like dehydration.|`|zF1MRdUFaa	maybe an allergy to the medicine all i can think of. I feel for you though it's scary when they are that little and can't tell you what is wrong.<br>  <br>  someone wrote congestive heart failure that too would make a great deal of sense I would ask your doctor about that and demand an answer or take him to a different hospital.|`|vWEkopBQaa	You need to take him to another doctor and fast. If he is vomiting and has diarrhea more then likely he is dehydrated, In tell you can get to a doctor be sure to push fluids.|`|AA10251806	I feel for u i do, take him somewhere else, another Dr another hospital.  maybe hes sensitive to antibiotics. still need another opinion...hope results are good. good luck<br>  definitely get some pedialite stat...|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	They put the oxygen on him but it didnt't help? What do you mean? It didn't help w/ his breathing?  Anyways, the antibiotics will lead to diarrhea and if they gave him a pretty strong one, theres a chance that he can vomit from it too. I would mostly watch for his breathing and choking, him turning blue. Call your pediatrician, dont hesitate to contact him/her day and night. This is your baby's health. If they found nothing wrong, just keep an eye out for anything you might see that is out of the ordinary. We have a tendency to freak out when it comes to these things as parents but if they saw nothing wrong at the hospital, all you can do right now is keep an eye out and if you see any abnormal signs, just call the pediatrician or 911 immediately.|`|0Meh0UXwaa	Take him back to the emergency and demand more tests sometimes you have to be more persistent to get answers it took 3 ER visits for them finally to find out my daughter had phnemoia. Good Luck|`|BwL4lv8uaa	it could just be a virus...that is weird for them not to admit him if his condition is as serious and you say it is....i would go to another pediatrician.|`|9eea524767f83cbb7a8107fff558ab83aa	what comes to my mind would be heart issues, did they look at the heart?  My daughter has heart defects, and sometimes heart issues can go undetected and then it can show signs later in life.  Congested heart failure can mimic congestion, colds.  He also could have the Rota virus, a really bad intestinal bug, be careful about dehydration.  Some signs that he could be is if the inside cheeks of his mouth are dry, no tears, sunken looking eyes, lethargic.  DON"T BE AFRAID TO ASK QUESTIONS AND BE A ADVOCATE FOR YOUR CHILD....TO MANY PARENTS TAKE THE WORD OF THE DOCTORS BUT THEY CAN BE WRONG!  FIGHT IF YOU THINK SOMETHING IS MORE WRONG.  Your his mother and we have a tuition for all of that.  Better safe than sorry....<br>  <br>  Why did they give you a inhaler for coughing they should have given a nebulizer.  If I was you, I would walk right back to that doctors office or er and demand that they run more test.  They keep putting him on stronger antibiotics but for what and with no improvement?  Ask questions!!!!   I hope that helps a little.|`|d36OrpbDaa	take him to the best hospital in your city and DEMAND that he stay there until they figure out what is wrong.  if he's in a near-constant state of emergency they should not be sending him home!<br>  <br>  sometimes hospitals and doctors are so overworked and understaffed that they just want to move the people out as quickly as possible.  for your baby's sake and for your own sanity take him to a good hospital.  call a NEW doctor, not your son's regular doctor.  see if a second opinion helps to figure out the problem.|`|r6SLA47yaa	Well the doctors don't seem to be too alarmed, so I would tell you not to worry too much. I know it's your baby and you will worry, however, this could be his body  reacting to/rejecting the medication given to him, since it all started with an ear infection. Keep voicing your concerns to the doctor (s) if you're not comfortable with the situation, sometimes we have to do that before getting any real help. good luck and I hope your baby feels better soon.

So it's possible this is the start of your period.

SJx9IWWtaa	I don't think I can beat Valentinas answer.  Thumbs up!  <br>  <br>  She is giving you attitude which should be brought up with the parents.  You need to talk to them, and ASK them what they think you should do.  If you and her parents are on the same page then she won't see them as her "way out" anymore.  You get what I'm saying.<br>  <br>  Other than that, try figuring out why she is so frustrated.  Maybe make up a game for her homework time.  Bring candy or something and set timers.   My six year old gets freakishly good when I set a timer.  It gives her a goal to BEAT, and then she feels good about how fast she finished cleaning her room, or how smart she is because she finished a page of her homework.  <br>  <br>  That reminds me try splitting up her homework.  Have her work on it for 10 minutes, then let her read for 10 minutes.  etc.  Not making her focus on it for so long should help her being frustrated.  Good luck!|`|tUeH8HDdaa	No babysitter should be left to look after a child in these conditions.<br>  <br>  I honestly think the parents are taking liberties with you.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't have to struggle with someone who is nearly seven like this.|`|rPHGTyK2aa	try to prevent the frustration by helping her along with the h/w without giving her all the answers|`|DKqsFGymaa	You say you send her to her room and she enjoys it...you can't send her to her room.  Her "time-out' has to be somewhere where she doesn't enjoy.  Maybe sitting on a chair at the kitchen table doing absolutely nothing.<br>  <br>  I'm a daycare provider, and although I don't have very many six year olds in my care, I do deal a lot with children who's parents are not consistent with punishment.  To me, it sounds like you're a better disciplinarian than the parents.  It also sounds like you have a pretty good relationship with this girl.  What I do with my kids when they're acting up is say to them, "You're not allowed to act with me like you act with your parents.  It is not acceptable."  <br>  <br>  It would be a little harder for you because you're younger than the parents, but I don't think a six year old would totally get all that.  She might just understand that your boundaries are a lot clearer than her parents and she'll relate to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep up the good work.  I'd definately hire you to take care of my kids!|`|57j6hSjNaa	Well, I would say "time-out" is not an effective method for punishing her. I think "time-out" is kind of ridicolous, because 90% of the time it doesn't work. Kids these days are smart enough to use reverse psychology, like when the seven year old tells you, "I thought I was staying here til Daddy got home?"<br>  <br>  I mentor and tutor children during my free time, and I will tell you, first off, if you notice the bad behavior only happens when she gets frustrated during homework time. Thats not the best time to punish her. Actually, she shouldn't be punished at all. I know she's probably get very difficult, but she should be encouraged to focus and try to comprehend her hmwrk.<br>  <br>  I know your probably not a trained educator, but take time out and explain the homework in her terms. Let her know your there to help her. Ask the parents to invest in games. Try to use fun games that will help her understand hmwrk better. Kids love having fun, no matter what it is. So during hmwrk time, make it just that, fun. For instance, if shes getting frustrated with times tables use multiplication board games, like bingo and blocks, also try rhyming cd's were she can sing along while learning her table by heart. <br>  <br>  Also, use a mini white board and let her write answers on the mini board with a marker, before writing it on her actual hmwrk paper. Kids love writing on the board. Make her feel important, especially that she can do that at home.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, kids respond to how the adult reacts. When she feels your frustrated, she becomes frustrated. So get in the habit of verbally validating her. Everytime she gets a problem right, say, "Good job," "I knew you could do it, "Your soo smart," "Almost, try again." <br>  <br>  Sit her at the table and look her directly in the eyes with a soft, stern voice and let her know, hmwrk is not an option and that you two will get through homework everyday with a positive attitude. Give her a time frame. Tell her, "Ok, everyday we will do hmwrk and we will spend ONLY an hour and a half. If we finish with a great attitude, I will give you these cool stickers of your favorite character.. Or I will get a jar and everytime we finish hmwrk successfully, I will put a marble in the jar. When you get "x" amount of marbles at the end of the week, you will get a really nice treat..." <br>  <br>  Make sure you put the jar where she can see it everyday to constantly remind her she will only get a marble if she displays a positive attitude during hmwrk time. Everytime she deserves a marble, let her drop it in. <br>  <br>  Alot of children get frustrated during homework, so its your job that you take control of the situation and make things fun. After all, she is only seven. Time out is not a good idea for her, because she's simply out grown that phase. Learn the childs personality and find out her most valuable possesions. When she acts up, take her favorite toy or make her clean her room. (Every kid hates that.)<br>  <br>  Also, have an open dialouge with the parents. Let them know whats going on at all times.. Report to them and let the seven year old know you will report her behavior and progress to her parents (especially the parent she mostly adores, which may be daddy.) <br>  <br>  Tell the parents to back you up.  Ask them to talk with her so she will learn to respect you doing hmwrk time. It's all about commincation. She's old enough to talk to and certainly too old for "time-out". Thats usually for 4-6 year olds.<br>  <br>  Remember, every child is different and with kids it's all about trial and error. If you haven't tried my method, take action immediatley. Make her understand whose boss. Let her know you can be fun, but work comes before play and when she plays, she will have soo much fun. Her attitude will change alot.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good luck !|`|SqrYOiK7aa	I always try to reason with kids.  Just get down to their level.  Since shes very smart, try to reason with her "Look, I know you don't want to do your homework but everyones gotta do stuff they don't like sometimes. If you get upset its just going to end up taking longer, so lets hurry up and get it done and then we can have fun."  ya know stuff like that.  It has never not worked for me yet.  But if she does become a brat still, give her time out without any books, or anything.  Tell her that when she becomes nasty she hurts your feelings. Which, she just might understand.  And does it usually happen only with homework??  maybe their is something she does not understand. Or shes having trouble seeing and it upsets her.  Or her eye sight might be bad.|`|lHjXeN8oaa	maybe the key is taking a privilege that she really enjoys... if the book is her passion, then maybe give the book a time-out.  as ridiculous as this sounds, if i take away my child's favorite toy they are devastated...even if they are not playing with it at the moment.  i guess it takes the control away from them.  here is a good example.  my 6 year old son is obsessed with animals - he has TONS of plastic ones that he likes to play with.  In instances of non-compliance (such as disrespectful language or refusal to complete a task we ask) i put the animals in "jail" so to speak.  I simply put them into the basket and put them in the storage closet.  Since i have made good on the threat, he is a believer that i will follow through that generally with a gentle reminder of the consequence he will straighten up and follow directions and do what is expected of him.  :)  i hope this helps.  I would definitely have a chat with the parents and let them know that you are having behavior problems with the child - it would be very helpful if they knew your plan of action and were willing to follow through after you go home.  :)  best of luck to you...|`|SsfnitjXaa	Instead of punishing her frustration with her homework you should be calming her, have her take a break and help her with her homework (I know a lot to ask from a teenager)  This girl has learning problems.  <br>  <br>  Time outs are stupid...children need to be guided.  <br>  <br>  If you are smart you can explain her homework in different ways so that she may understand it better.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	inform the parents & work out a discipline measure that will benefit all.  zero tolerance is the best method, but homework duty is best left to the parents.

pzLDXL6gaa	Two in a row or two separately?<br>  <br>  Anyway, you can get pregnant if you miss two, if your period was lighter than normal then definitely time for a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  It's probably a low chance if you use condoms as you say, assuming you used them every time and didn't have a breakage or anything.<br>  <br>  Periods can just be lighter/later than normal sometimes on the pill. It happens.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	i would say (if your not pregnant) it's time to switch to a birth control patch or shot that lasts a year or more. obviously you can't keep with the pill routine so let's use something less operator friendly or full proof. i think it's called depo prevera. ask you health provider about it.|`|uAZlvHgiaa	Go buy one of those home pregnancy tests at wal-mart for $3.99. I have irregular periods & it is worth the peace of mind.|`|ig0klGBXaa	it is prolly because you are stressed out,  quit worrying.
jLI0IgWkaa	It actually might work to your advantage to train both kids at the same time. this way it creates a competition between them, and they'll be equally eager to learn to use the potty. (especially if he's not up to par with his age in his motor skills, he just may not be cognitively developed to "get it" about being potty trained just yet.)<br>  <br>  good luck .|`|EWETAH0daa	im having the same issue with my non autistic son. i think it comes to be more about trianing yourself more then him. you need to look for the clues and hints until he gets vocal or does it himself good luck|`|sw2R5A9iaa	ask his therapist for advice.  you should continue the same treatment he receives in his program.|`|6ErVPePEaa	I wonder the same thing. my 2 yr old son is autistic too. His ot says not to even start to worry about potty training until he is at least 5. I think with our little ones it is going to be harder. Where on the spectrum is your little boy? Mine is moderate to severe. He doesn't talk or chew food, still on a bottle...His therapists say wait until we get him to do everything else....  <br>  <br>  It is hard to say with our special little kiddos. When they can't speak it is hard to know when they are ready. They have to have that control over their private areas. If that makes sense. My son is already in a size 6 diaper, so I am not sure how much longer he will fit into diapers lol....If you figure it out please let me know
oE0ApHqPaa	It's unlikely, but possible.  The only way to be sure is a pregnancy test.  Try the dollar store ones, they are cheap and work just as well as the others.<br>  <br>  And just to correct another answer: pre-*** does have sperm in it.|`|def5d056753c507adaad1d31c72512beaa	if you had intercourse than yes she could be pregnant.  precum can still get you pregnant, it lives in wet areas  its highly unlikly however but i would tell her to calm down. I thought once i was pregnant and it caused my period to be over a month late, i took tons of tests b/c of it and oncei relaxed i got it almost 2 months later and i never once missed a period in my life<br>  <br>  im sure shes fine, if you are that worried take a test, they are good for 5 days prior to missed period, plus when it says negative it may relax her|`|a5f8fb915b0c89693e97dc814aba467faa	Wy don't you want to take a test?

I don't think so... I mean, it would help if i knew her age but if she has signs of her period then I doubt it. You can get pregnant that way, though. It hasn't been long enough for her to have pregnancy feelings.... I would give it a week and take the test if she has still yet to start... Women do not always have a perfect cycle. She could be off a week or two. Don't freak. Stay calm. She can go get checked out or take the test but I wouldn't freak out. Good luck. :)|`|ELQ4R7QFaa	well im having almost the same problems except i have a lil cramping and a lil light discharge  =] <br>  but i am trying to have a baby with my fiance <br>  and i want to know if im pregnant too but like you said maybe its just the stress|`|uAZlvHgiaa	I doubt it but buy a pregnancy test so you can stop worrying.|`|wRyX3A7Oaa	TAKE A TEST!!!

ev0SHwMyaa	My first period I had was a very light one. But within 6 weeks of taking it I was pregnant. I really think it was the fertilaid that helped me get pregnant, I had been trying for over 3 years before starting it. I highly recommend it! Baby dust to you*****I hope it happens for you soon.|`|9b8278b3a9a556138153fbad211d8c67aa	yes
wx32VQSWaa	actually it might be a good idea to drop by the hospital. I personally experienced this myself 4 times (3 times with my last pregnancy and once with this pregnancy) Around 30 something weeks, after having sexual intercourse with hubby, I start contracting every 3-5 minutes...I start timing it and it's still going after an hour. I probably get about 14-20 contractions within an hour even though some contractions become irregular like 7-10 minutes apart. I went to the hospital and for sure I made the right choice, because worse case scenerio the nurse said I would have went into labor at home if I didn't come in. When I got there, they monitored the baby and time your contractions, give you steroids shots to help baby's lungs developed, and also magnesium sufed/IV to stop your contractions. You have one week to full-term, they might just let you stay overnight and see if the contractions stops on its own and if not probably have you go ahead and deliver the baby at 36 weeks. Whichever it is, it's best to go to the hospital before your contractions become too painful for you to move around. Goodluck|`|aiJ4rL9vaa	How far along are you? <br>  <br>  I am 39 weeks and had some of the same symptoms today so just to be on the safe side I went to Labor and Delivery to be checked out. My contractions were more like a tightening with some cramping and it turns out I am in early labor. They told me to come back when my contractions were 5-6 mins apart and strong for one hour. If I were you I would go just to make sure. :) Congrats and hope all is well<br>  <br>  **Since you are only 36 weeks I would go in for sure b/c if it is the beginning of labor they will probably want to stop it.|`|89b9b79c918cf6555bea31d3d7be7d94aa	how far along are you? labor contractions don't have to be every 6-5-4-3 minutes apart, i was in active labor when i started to notice, i mean really notice the pain when i started timing the contractions i was all over the place sometimes 5 minutes apart then they would calm down for 8 minuets then 4 minutes later i would have another ext.... when i got to the hospital i was 6-7cm dilated and the nurse doubted i was in real labor because the non-stress machine wasn't picking up the contractions. long story short i had my daughter a couple hours later. if you are far enough into your pregnancy it is possible that the sex triggered your contractions. i started to have light not too noticeable/painful contractions on a wednesday morning i went to the hospital on thursday 7 in the morning and had my daughter at 12:50 in the afternoon. don't over look these light contractions because it is possible that active labor will show up in a blink of an eye <br>  good luck<br>  edit: i was 38 weeks when this all took place, you could still go a bit longer but check with your doctor to see if you need to get checked|`|J3JClsuQaa	I would call the OB-GYN could be the real thing, could be false...How far along are you?  Good luck and Congrats.|`|MqFeJiukaa	It sounds like its false labor but that is based on my experience.  With my labors when my contractions are 5-6 min apart that is active labor and quite painful but that is just me.  Orgasm can cause you to contract.  <br>  Call your Dr to be safe because although it may be false your labor is not going to be the same as mine.
0LvWiESWaa	My daughter does the same thing (she's 17 months). Just keep trying different things and try things you have given before. Babies will eat when they are hungry.|`|jaT35u4oaa	Keep trying. As a general rule of thumb, it is said that food must be introduced at least 12 times to a child. Maybe half of those times the child will eat it, the other half they will not. But don't start eliminating things that she won't eat, children need a healthy, well balanced diet. In time she will learn that mommy isn't only going to give her cookies ( or whatever she likes) and that this is her meal, take it or leave it. <br>  <br>  You can also try spicing things up, making new recipes, changing thngs up to make it more appealing and fun.|`|ZZMkENyeaa	I'll tell you what my dr. told me:<br>  <br>  "Leave her alone, she'll eat when she's hungry, just make sure healthy food is available." <br>  <br>  He told me that in these stages kids have an uncanny sense of what they need and don't need nutrition wise, he assured me that she won't let herself starve, and making children eat can be traumatic. It can cause obesity later in life.|`|dbnGwNsXaa	Dont give up! Toddlers are like that, today u feed them mac n cheese n they loove it bt tomorrow they wont even look at it. Thing is you have to have patience, introduce her to new food if she likes n eats it thats very good try again the next day, if she doesnt want to eat dont force the food on her she'll eventually let u know when she's ready to eat. If shes not eating the same food try agsin in a couple of days. Hope this helps ((:|`|3z48Hw0Baa	i have the same problem with my niece we just experimented with different foods its probably just a thing they go through i mean she doesn't do it any more.|`|6U4sl15uaa	my doc said to go by a four day rule just try it again in 4 days if you try several times and she doesn't eat it then the probably doesn't like it|`|50fDeNWXaa	My son turns 13 months in 3 days and he is going throught the same thing right now. I guess they aren't going throught a growth spurt of something. I don't force him to eat. I just keep trying every so often and eventually he will eat some. As long as she isn't acting different or really cranky I think she should be fine. If not call the doctor and ask, but I think its something they do around 13 months old.
n6XYYyoLaa	it will tell you on the can, but since we use it, here goes..<br>  one scoop to every 2 ounces of water; so to make 8 oz, 4 scoops<br>  you can make 24 hrs in advance, after that you have to toss it<br>  it can be out of the fridge for 2 hrs if it hasn't been drank from; one sip on the bottle and you have to throw it out in one hour<br>  if baby doesnt finish a bottle u can't put it back in the fridge for more than an hour after the baby started the bottle bc their saliva introduces bacteria to the formula and can multiply enough to possibly make baby sick...if u have more ?s feel free to email me.....its really easy, and it's easy when you are out and about to take with u....i choose to use powder, i don't want any other kind...:)|`|lzivF4Idaa	for every two ounces of water you use you put one full scoop in, then you shake well.<br>  <br>  2oz bottle = 1 scoop<br>  4oz bottle = 2 scoops <br>  6oz bottle = 3 scoops<br>  etc.<br>  <br>  put the water in first, then the formula. that will be easiest. then you put the cap on and shake. once you make a bottle its only good for an hour.<br>  <br>  EDIT- ive never used the packets so i have no clue, i would think it would be one packet equals one scoop?? i wouldnt take my word for it though. im gonna repost in the newborn && baby section so hopefully you'll get more answers!!!|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Read on the box that the packs came in.

BU3A3rR4aa	umm no|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Um no you can't...If that were possible a single woman could impregnate herself...Hmm. No need for men? I think you are on to something ;)|`|2GXgT981aa	I asked once (in a biology class) why you couldn't take the genetic material from an egg, and insert it into another egg (sort of a weird version of IVF) to create an embryo.  The answer was that there are sex-linked characteristics to gametes that are both necessary for an embryo to form correctly.  I'm not sure exactly what he meant, but basically you need one of each or conception will not proceed.<br>  <br>  Besides which, you can't make a sperm into an ovum because sperm are simply DNA and a case.  Eggs contain all of the extra stuff (like cytoplasm, mitochondria, etc).  An egg made from a sperm would never work because a person inherits all of his or her mitochondria (which have their own DNA) from his or her mother, and a person without mitochondria could not survive.|`|OQnGzDGGaa	umm.. i dont think so... well maybe yes, but its gping to be very hard no? i dont know about biology or that stuff, but its weird take care andgood look|`|muTZeGOgaa	You could swap the DNA, certainly.

50fDeNWXaa	I would go get checked out. If you are in labor your to early to have the baby right now. They can give you medicine to stop the labor so the baby can stay in you for a few more weeks to help grow. You don't want to have the baby now if you don't have to but if you wait to long then it will be too late and they won't be able to stop the labor. I had my labor stopped like 6 times because my son wanted to come so early. My advice is get to the hospital ASAP and have them stop the contractions NOW!|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Amanda is correct, go get yourself checked out. It's a little on the early side to have this baby.<br>  Even if it's nothing, better safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  I also wanted to add, that labor is not that painful for everyone. When I was in labor with my third, I questioned it because it wasn't hurting, or that regular until right at the end. I didn't get to the hospital until I was 6 cm. <br>  You don't ALWAYS know for sure.<br>  My first I didn't go until I was 8 cm, because it hurt, but wasn't that bad. I thought it would be worse.|`|wAPZ1vrTaa	sounds like it to me.ill be 36wks tomorrow an this happened to me at 34 weeks an 3 days ago,..i went into labor an they stopped it with terbutaline each time..go to the er asap.good luck an congrats on your baby.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	Sounds like it can wait, probably Braxton Hicks.

oE0ApHqPaa	Hey, your body, your choice.  You're not a sl*t, and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.<br>  <br>  The pregnancy could be from either date, you will just have to wait until you have clear ultrasound to tell, and even then the difference of two weeks or so may not be enough.  You may end up needing a paternity test.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|p0prrzf2aa	just wait til you actually know how far along you are, it will be easier. but when you find out, knock off 2 weeks from it,  for example : if you got pregnant in Jan you'd be like 4 weeks. so knock off 2...2 weeks since conception. Jan 2nd you'd be 1 week...so you can't knock off 2 weeks from that, so your very very early. its confusing. once you get an ultrasound it'll be way easier<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  sorry for confusing you : /<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i say your preg. from jan|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Most women get positives 14 days after sex.

It could be either.|`|fQLeIAh1aa	Well mylast pregnancy test was 3 weeks into the pregnancy.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	You should never use a bumper at all, but if you do then you should remove it when the baby can roll over.    http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/cps-spc/legislati...  However, when used correctly, bumper pads should not protect infants from bumping against the sides of a crib or from having limbs become entrapped between the slats of the crib. This is because bumper pads are supposed to be removed from the crib by the time that the infant is able to roll over and sit up unaided (a development milestone normally reached between 4 and 8 months of age), which represents the same time frame in which it is expected that the infant would be able to move over and approach the side of the crib.    (It must also be noted that, for the most part, infants do not sustain major injuries from banging their heads against the sides of their cribs because they are incapable of generating enough force to seriously injure themselves through head banging. The frontal bone, which is the part of the head most frequently struck during crib head banging, is the thickest bone in the body and therefore, is capable of absorbing the shock associated with this type of behaviour.    It should also be noted that it remains possible for an infant to entrap his or her limbs over or under the bumper pads and that infant limb entrapment [between the slats of a crib], in the vast majority of cases, results in no injury or minor injury, such as bruising.)    In summary, aesthetic value, the risk of limb entrapment, and the risk of a child hitting their head against the side of their crib are overshadowed by the hazards of entanglement, entrapment, strangulation, and suffocation (potentially leading to death) that children are exposed to through the use of bumper pads.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	you should have removed the crib bumper a long time ago!!|`|iMMQSF7baa	Actually you never need a crib bumper.  In fact crib bumpers are not recommended as they can be a chocking hazard.  I therefore never used my bummper.      Here is one article on the subject.    http://www.cbc.ca/health/story/2007/09/1...|`|BypjotRpaa	i took it out once my son was standing in the crib..|`|BMfn0D9gaa	we have a breathable one for my 7 month old and it is still in her crib.  its not as sturdy as a cloth one so i am not worried about her pulling herself up on it, its flimsy but it does a good job at keeping her from getting her arms and legs stuck, and i don't have to worry about her suffocating!  I bought it at babies'r'us|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I was taught to never use a bumper to begin with for fear of suffocation. I'd say though that if she can move around on her own go ahead and take it out. There's really not much purpose for them.
HF97Rs9qaa	With young children it's hard to tell what is or is not the truth sometimes.     If your son did not touch the little girl then is was wrong of her to accuse him. It should not be left at that and you should get to the bottom of it because if it was not your son then there could be something else going on with that little girl and she may need help. There may be someone else touching her or sexually abusing her or she could be watching programs or being exposed to things that are not okay.    I would get you and your son and that little girl and her mother together, let them know that all 4 of you are going to have a talk. Let them know that no one is in trouble and you just want to talk to them and that honesty is the most important thing. It will be harder for them to lie with each other there. Make them look you in the face and tell you what happened one at a time. I would also talk to the both of them about boundaries and iinappropriatebbehavior It is much easier to see who is or is not lying when both parties are there.    It is not good to leave it at that, that will leave those kids with a lot of unanswered questions and feelings which may lead to more inappropriate behaviour.    At that age they are curious and if you do not answer their questions then they will go out on their own to find the answers, and you don't want that.    If your son is an honest boy and he is saying he did not touch her then I would not leave him being accused. Then that little girl will see that she was able to lie and accuse an inocent person and get away with it. Then when the next problems occurs your son will be accused again and again (making your son an easy scape goat) or she will accuse other children to take away blame from herself and that is unhealthy for her and a bad habbit to form.    With an issue like this it is best to get to the bottom of it.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	leave it at that. so long as he knows it's wrong then that's fine. making more of an issue could make him more curious! and it sounds like he didn't do anything anyway.|`|f273c7cdaf25cd05579783d5d164f701aa	Well, first off, I think he is too old to be seeing you naked and to notice your private parts.    Second, he most certainly could be curious and could have touched the other girl's private parts.  He could be too scared to admit it.  But if he has seen yours then he may want to see others' as well.    I would stop undressing in front of him/seeing you naked and keep reinforcing that private parts aren't to be touched by other people.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	It's normal. It has nothing to do with sex, it has to do with curiosity. The worst thing that you can do is make an issue of it. I have an excellent memory and can still recall those days - playing Doctor it was called and it definitely wasn't sexual.|`|6bec1b1d615ba504dd8ddd905700f371aa	Whoa, what's going on with your inner dialogue? These are children you're talking about!  They're normal and curious about one another  different parts etc. it's all very normal.  I doubt seriously that this is sexual in any way.  You're attributing very adult themes to a very normal growing process.  It's often difficult to ascertain the facts with a child so young, especially when it comes to motivation. They are really not capable of talking in any meaningful way about motivation in such a situation.    At any rate, you might want to have a sit down and talk about appropriate and non appropriate touching, but aside from that, I wouldn't take accusations at this age too seriously unless you see a trend developing.|`|9P26sacKaa	I guess I don't see the issue here.  You talked to him about the inappropriateness of touching other people's private parts.  That's it.  His friend's parents should be watching them, you know?  When would they have had this opportunity?  Is your friend leaving them alone for long periods of time?      It is totally normal for kids to explore their own bodies and their friends' bodies as well.  You just have to tell them that they're not supposed to do that.  I used to do stuff like that with my friends (who happened to be girls).  My husband talks about "playing doctor" with his cousins.  It's totally normal.  You talk to them about it, without accusing them of any hideous sin, and move on.  Doing this doesn't mean they have seen anything inappropriate or are being sexually abused or anything.  They're normal human beings - curious.  They probably were fully consenting about the whole situation.      If your friend is upset about it, you can tell her that you talked to him about it, he said he didn't do it, but you're not going to get into a fight over whose kid is lying, so you told him that it is inappropriate to touch other people's private parts, and tell her that you don't think it's appropriate to leave little kids without supervision for long periods of time, let them go to the bathroom together, sleep over, etc.      That's it.  They're kids.  It's normal.|`|ztug2gLjaa	My son is 3 1/2 and always asks me what that meaning my ta ta's so of course he's curious.  I wouldn't make a huge deal out of it...he's curious and he's 4!!!!!!!!!|`|rE15gSFraa	Let me start by saying that you are a GREAT mom, to be so concerned about this.  It is perfectly natural for boys at that age to touch others same and opposite sex.  Use this incident as a learning experience....sit your son down and in a nonthreatening way, ask him about what an appropriate and not appropriate ways to touch our friends.  Flat out ask him if he has any questions and keep a dialogue open. Tell him he can come and tell you anything anytime, which I'm sure you already do.  This is an incident that occurs everywhere.  The problem lies in how parents react and deal with it when it happens. I have a sister, who flew off the handle when her 8 year old son was accused of "squeezing the crotch" of a little girl. My sister and bro-in-law went psycho and called the girl and her Mother a liar. Even though it was never considered sexual molestation by the girl or her family, simply a matter of aggression with my nephew.They even got pissed off at me-since it happened during a party at my house!  So KUDOS to you for owning up to the fact that kids sometimes do things inappropriate and that it is totally normal. It is in how you, the parent deals with it. You are a great Mom, wish my sister was as mature as you!  Good ideas about always leaving the bedroom door open while they're playing, and observing their behaviors.  Good LUCK.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	He's only 4 I'd just drop it. You talked to him about it and even if he had touched her he didn't mean harm. He can't really look at like an adult so it's not really a big deal unless you make it one.|`|qB4KvbDiaa	children go through diff rent stages in life|`|6sAbs2iiaa	he is just a 4 year old kid  I think everyone should come down and stop making a big scene.|`|m2aznd8xaa	it will be okay its perfectly normal for him to be curious and you did what you should by telling him that you never touch another persons private.just keep reminding him that that is why it is called a private because that is private stuff no one else should ever be touching. just let him know that you are always there if he want to know something about private parts and that its okay to ask anything and to always trust you and tell you the truth.just let him be aware of the consequences if he does do something like that or anyone for that matter. let him know you believe him and trust him to always tell the truth. and just remind him that its inappropriate to ever touch a private of someone elses. you did well by talking to him about it. he is your son so teach him as much as you could about it. if you dont think he did it than he probably didnt.you know your son best.and you dressing and undressing in front of him has nothing to do with it.let him ask questions and answer them truthfully.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	ya know I think this is making a mountain out of a mole hill  Unless the girl was saying "no dont touch me " and he continued to try. Then this is nothing more than normal...curiosity. Not a sexual assault. "I have one of these to pee ..your's isn't like mine ..hm mm interesting"..I wouldn't shame my child about it ..just reestablish the fact ..you dont touch people's privates it is a social faux pa
96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	Either or at this point. Only way to tell them apart would be to get your period (PMS) or miss your period AND have a positive pregnancy test. Keep in mind, though, that implantation can take up to 14 days, so it may be too early for pregnancy symptoms. Good luck.|`|HuunuqQUaa	well Im guessing you and I are in the same boat. Lol.. last month I had all these symptoms of pregnancy. sore breasts, peeing like crazy, tired all the time. Dizzyness, nausea..I was almost certain i was pregnant. And it turned out I wasnt. which was very dissapointing. But I would go and get checked anyways, or wait until your missed period and take a test.    Goodluck!|`|z5kEznU3aa	symptoms of really being pregnant or just expecting period are always the same. Real change you're going to see after your period is late and you have a positive test, otherwise you'll never know, if it's PMS or ealy pregnancy symptoms, because the hormones worked the same before period is really missed.|`|9EkFrApiaa	That is how I feel right before my period but I have never been pregnant...so it sounds like PMS to me.|`|4DoXomHZaa	Probably neither unless you have very short cycles. If you did conceive, the egg would have only implanted a day ago or so, or maybe not yet (5-12 days past conception)....too early for pregnancy symptoms.     The peeing happens because the baby is getting large and pushing on your uterus...this happens MUCH later.
hyp3bvhHaa	Without seeing it it is very hard to give an opinion.  In the case of any rash appearing it is always best to get it looked at by a dr, as you say he is generally well i would not panic, but get him looked over tomorrow when the drs are open.
K5uoaetaaa	Does sound like chicken pox - they have a two week incubation period so he may have been in contact with somebody without you knowing.  Keep him cool tonight and have the doctor come out tomorrow.|`|OjXvYEZDaa	I don't think its chicken pox as if they were, they would have appear on back,belly with few spots at start, next day they spread on arms, legs, face, If your son already had chicken pox so it probably are not chicken pox.  i think he could be have allergic reaction, Best make appointment to the doctor to get your son checked|`|2ZqKDMMRaa	Get your child to a doctor if u cant ring N.H.S DIRECT...|`|kT7GVOosaa	sometimes teething can cause these symptoms.|`|V8uvefQDaa	If you are that concern call NHS Direct!    X|`|cie3oBcXaa	I would take him to the doctors asap to get it checked. It could just be a viral rash with his bad tum. But it's always advisable to get rashes checked. Hope he is better soon.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i would get it checked if he is not acting his normal|`|7i6qj4OXaa	You are right to be worried and should call a doctor.  Have you tried pressing a glass against the spots.  If they disappear all is well, if not call an ambulance because it could be meningitis.|`|SI02JOQ4aa	Chicken pox can be transmitted in many ways, and is usually passed on before the carrier realises that he/she is infected.    I would get the advice of a health professional very quickly, because meningitis has similar symptoms and NEEDS URGENT ATTENTION.|`|tRUoj8cPaa	You better consult a pediatric doc soon as possible.

No, you can't get pregnant from dry humping.     Word of advice here, KEEP YOUR PANTS ON! What starts out as "dry humping" is going to go to the next level sooner or later and then your next question on here is going to be, "My girlfriend is pregnant. What do I do?????"|`|ThFCLbYpaa	you are completely boned  i got my girlfriend pregnant the exact same way about 7 months ago  so what are u gonna name him/her?|`|zC2900V8aa	She is not pregnant if thats all that you have done was "dry hump".  I would recommend that you guys really educate yourselves before trying anything else though.  I don't mean it in a bad way or in a rude way but sex is not all fun.  There are lots of diseases and infections involved besides pregnancy.  For men those infections are far more complicated to treat than it would be for a girl.  If you can't keep your pants on I would suggest condoms next time.  That way she will not get pregnant.  I am currently pregnant myself by my fiance and this is not my first pregnancy.  I got pregnant our first time together!  We decided to try again and it didn't take long to do the second time either!  Whether or not you chose to have sex is up to you.  For me however, I ask that you wrap it up at ALL times because as I said before, if its not pregnancy it can be disease and infections...Ever had a catheter inserted before??? Or any other medical instruments?  Not fun I promise you.  That is for a Urinary Tract Infection only!  Which you can get from unprotected sex.|`|xs6fpAkIaa	ummm she's deff not pregnant|`|48suPjHcaa	yeah it's possible. lets say there's this kid named david and he does it with a girl named shane there's a 68% OF PREGNANCY.|`|J39Nvon4aa	Not your kid, mate.
96f1438ccfd49dc1a27e3e2cb9700945aa	My best advice is to start tracking your basal body temperature along with some ovulation prediction kits. There are so many variables for you--gave birth recently, are still breastfeeding, just stopped taking the pill...it's practically impossible for anyone to tell you when and if you will ovulate. The best thing is to observe the changes in your body, especially your cervical mucus. That along with charting and OPK's should help you dramatically increase your chances of becoming pregnant. However, remember that there's only a 25-30% each month of becoming pregnant even if you have intercourse on the day of ovulation, so don't despair if it doesn't happen right away.    Also remember that having recently given birth and stopping the birth control pills will throw off your cycles for a while, which means you won't have a clear idea of what your cycles are like now that you have stopped taking birth control pills until you have had at least 3 regular cycles. I'm assuming you've only had two, so it may take one more to get the hang of it--plus you need to make sure you're ovulating, since you can have a period without ovulation.    Finally, if you're trying to conceive you will need to have intercourse frequently on your fertile days (which is why you need to pinpoint your ovulation day and fertile days) and not just twice a month if you and your partner are actively trying to conceive. Good luck.|`|aB2zSt6Vaa	You should probably have sex more often and use ovulation kits, especially because you may not be ovulating at all. Look up "lactation induced anovulation". It's basically where breast feeding acts as a form of birth control and prevents ovulation. You may be getting a period, but that doesn't mean you ovulate. Since your cycles are so off and since you're breast feeding, I definitely think you may need a little more help in determining ovulation days and such.|`|WPI0Z47saa	The computer might say you are ovulating but you really should use an ovulation kit if you want to know. There is such a small window so what if you aren't "the usual" as the put it. Me and my huband just did every other day for a month to guarantee that there was always live sperm ready for when the egg was there. Even with perfect conditions you still only have a 20% chance each month of conceiving.|`|G0Y8qcLzaa	Joanna ;    Your specific enquiry is more properly and correctly  reserved for a medical practitioner response. You no doubt have a family physician? In the mean while quiet down and relax. Take care of the child you're blessed with before  contemplating your readiness for a second baby. All will come to fruition with time and with patience. Peace.
Ez4d9g3vaa	Show him a picture or have him look in the mirror.  Point to everyone and have him name them, then point to him in the picture or mirror and ask "who is that?" he should at least say "me".    He may not understand that his NAME is___.  He may think of it as a word that means mommy and daddy want my attention.  Teach him to associate the word with a picture of his face.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Yea maybe he just doesnt have a sense of self yet.  Try and ask him a series of questions like...where do you live (if he knows that), what is our pets/friends name whatever, what is your fav. color, just tons of questions about himself and then try and ask his name.  If that doesnt work try and teach him about introducing yourself and shaking your hand etc....and then saying your name.  If he says your name instead correct him and say...no IM simone and you are....?  He'll come around eventually.|`|d933e4b97b43aa7bfb10ac2da32dceb4aa	I wonder if he is kind of playing with you? My youngest child would not say her oldest brothers name until she was 4!!! We would ask her "who is that?" and she would answer "my big brudder" We would prompt her with his name. We would ask her to call him. Nothing. She would say her middle brothers name, her own name, my name, her father's name, etc. But she absolutely refused to say her oldest brothers name for no apparent reason. Always balled him Big Brudder.  Trust me, he knows his name and he will start using it soon.|`|mx3gFmIKaa	All the 'wh' questions really throw kids, my oldest didn't get it till 5 years old (that was late btw, but for three I think its fine)
BOXrOvhcaa	Try to use this ovulation calendar tool.   http://www.softorbits.com/awc/   to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|b4b9263f561119d96f1e2a9ffeab2863aa	Yes, yes, yes!|`|4DoXomHZaa	It doesn't matter how long your cycle is or how long your luteal phase is. All that matters is when you ovulate and if sperm is there to meet the egg.,    Sperm can live up to 5 days inside, so yes, it is possible.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	well i did.. the doctors are still not agreeing with my dates. but only i know when i had sex.. that stupid wheel thing makes me mad. every time i go to the doctor i tell them i conseived when i did and they say well you didnt ovulat until ...  whatever i didnt have sex that whole week.  so yea i think so
s4LWmcTjaa	I agree with stay@homemomma.  Verbal praise is wonderful positive reinforcement and it avoids the problems of kids expecting rewards for behavior that should be demonstrated to begin with.    I used verbal praise for my toddler to positively reinforce good behaviors.  The only time I use a sticker/reward chart is for him wearing his glasses.  He just got his first pair of glasses last week and the sticker chart works wonderfully to reinforce that.    I say fore-go all the charts and tokens and give verbal positive praise a try.  You'd be surprised at how far a "great job!" or "I love the way you are sharing" goes.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I vote for verbal recognition as well.  : )|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	How does verbal recognition work in your house?  thats all I use at this point for behavior that I want to see continued.  my kids are 3 and 17 mos.  I praise and praise and hug and kiss when they do something that is outstanding - sharing with out being asked/told, automatically do things that I expect.  On the regular stuff - Its a "great job sweetie!" and a hug and/or kiss.|`|G2auAv1Saa	My daughter went through a little phase like this when I decided to do a star chart and I had the same concerns as you. I threw out the star chart and explained to her what the best rewards are. The best rewards are: knowing you did something nice for somebody without getting anything reward, making somebody smile and making yourself smile. I shifted the focus from the reward to the good deed.|`|QsQj8jO7aa	duh, you are bribing a kid to behave according to your standards. Who came up with this ridiculous idea. Leave the kids alone when they are behaving, learning, exploring and punish them for bad behavior. That may be hard though because lots of times kids get punished for exploring their worlds because parents, teachers don't like it.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Start rewarding them with genuine pride when they behave in a way that makes you proud.  Be sure to ask them how they feel about themselves when they are making good, kind, safe choices.  Teach them to feel pride in themselves - best reward ever!|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Set out a specific behavior for a start and make them aware of that. Every one who shares well gets one and a lot of praise when they do something else good but not specifically the action you outlined. And when they ask you can say you did really well at cleaning up but the stars are for sharing and when you share you'll get one. it might help if its not just as broad as good behavior.
jTM6Upm5aa	Okay, I just baptized my son Catholic..So here it goes. One of the God parents MUST be Catholic in order for your child to be baptized Catholic. It helps that you are Catholic,in order for your child to follow the Catholic faith as there are rituals and sacraments that they have to go through. Baptism is not the only sacrament, First Communion, Penance, Confirmation...There are even sacraments.Are you educated and willing to go through the process with your child?|`|48b2b41f5c4a3bc51bd8f89661550c98aa	A child becomes a member when they are baptized.  My nephew was baptized Catholic and my brother is not Catholic.  He was baptized Lutheran and doesn't practice.  My sister was the godmother and she was also baptized Lutheran and does not practice.  It usually depends on how strict the church is.  I don't think it should matter though.|`|GnXfEdegaa	I think so, but not absolutely sure.  I'd ask your church (if that is where you want to have your child baptised) or the church you want.     As for the God parent question, I think so.  I would think it depends on the church, pastor, etc.|`|esGTdnC0aa	its pointless baptizing your child because there is no god.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	well of course they have to be catholic .. The entire point of a god parent..is to raise the child in the catholic faith if the parents die. The baby is a member of the church the moment its baptized
leGfABH4aa	my daughter has had this twice now. and she was even vaccinated for it. the first time was when she was 4 months old and it lasted about 3 weeks and she still has it, but its almost gone and its been about 2 weeks. just make sure he stays hydrated, maybe ask your pediatrician if you can use pedialyte, that's what i've been using with my daughter. I got the unflavored and mixed it with her formula in place of the water. Good Luck and hope your son gets better soon|`|W8UZebRWaa	My son had it at 9 months. The dr didn't do a stool test or anything but said that's what he had.  Within about 48 hours the vomiting stopped and the diarrhea lasted for maybe a week but wasn't horrible. Just a little extra nursing to keep him hydrated.  I caught it from him and ended up in the ER b/c I was so dehydrated. Make sure you keep pumping the fluids to the poor little one.  I would say call the Dr just to be sure.|`|A91e6T71aa	yes, my daughter had it like a month ago when she was 7 months old..     she had severe throwing up (12 times in one hour, a lot each time) and could not eat anything without keeping it down.. after that she had diarrhea (according to her doctor that is common), abut it only lasted about 3 days.|`|lQeZMfsNaa	My older sister had that when she was a baby. It lasted for a week or two, I think. I wasn't born, obviously, but we still talk about it every now and then. She was in the hospital for a few nights, and my parents were really terrified, but she's fine. Your baby will be fine even if he has the Rotavirus.
WPI0Z47saa	I took mine 3 days before my period and it was very very faint. I kept retesting because I was so excited I just kept wanting to make sure. It was faint for the first 3 weeks then got darker.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	Your pregnant I had 4 of those beautiful faint lines before my dark line and confirming blood test! :)|`|fMnzjULCaa	The closer you are to your period, the darker the line will get. So being 4 days away probably makes it pretty faint. You could try a digital or wait a few days. Sounds like a positive to me though, congrats!|`|QYYWBrG7aa	no matter how faint the second line is it`s still positive.congrats ur pregnant >:}|`|JKM7CEpnaa	Your just a month pregnant. Not enough HCG levels in your urine yet. Your most likely pregnant. Go to the doctors start prenatal care and good luck. Congratulations.|`|499b2674aceaca4224f1e97ffb73d7f7aa	Congratulations!!!|`|CkecSp4Uaa	A faint line is still a line and still a positive reading.  If you are unsure, wait a few days and retest first thing in the morning.  I had a similar thing happen.  I took my first pregnancy test around lunch time the week of my missed period.  The result came back positive, but it was so faint that I really doubted whether it was or not.  So I retested two days later with a first in the morning urine sample (your first urine of the day is more concentrated and will have more of the pregnancy hormone in it than later in the day so a test will be easier to read).  It was almost an instant positive.|`|mGubEYTRaa	If you got a faint positive before the elapsed time then congrats!  You are most likely pregnant, try again tomorrow or the next day and the lines should get stronger.|`|0k5hixiWaa	a line is a line!    YAY! CONGRATULATIONS!!!|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	try a first morning pee, the line should be darker.|`|cjqOUq5xaa	Post the test and we can help you decide for sure! But more than likely if you got a faint line-it is still positive!!|`|Lpsx8qUfaa	If you have two lines then your pregnant :) Even if one is faint wait until a day before your period and take another test if you are still un sure.|`|8Vg4JrbSaa	well there is a very high chance you could be pregnant.  If you are still not convinced than you should wait until you actually miss your period and do another test just to be certain.  Most of the time you don't really get a false positive, but it can happen.|`|2274dcf5eba0ee2ef3aabbe2c8b0a89daa	ha thats what i thought to.. i thought i was nuts and went running to ask hubby if he saw it to..    well now im 17 weeks    so good luck|`|tZfkPQF6aa	Faint is still positive. I had the same thing and bought a digital test just ot be sure.|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	Any sign of a second line means your prego(its just faint because you don't have alot of prgnancy hormones but you have some so thats why there is a light line). Congrats:)|`|ffAmoqFTaa	That's what happened to me and I'm pregnant!  Usually the second line comes up because it can read a small amount of the pregnancy hormone.  Give it a couple days and take another one - or just take a digital test, it tells you pregnant and not pregnant .. that way you don't have to worry if you read the test right.  Good luck!|`|xy5UNiELaa	Take the test again first thing in the morning.  If it's still unclear, try again in a couple of days.  Make sure you read the test in the time specified.  If you wait, you could see an evaporation line, which may lead you to think you're pregnant.  If you read the test correctly and it looks positive, chances are you're pregnant.  Hope you get the answer you want!|`|IngripgMaa	Faint....is still a "GO"!  Congrats.|`|N6XTcGejaa	that means you are pregnant. congrats.|`|Eqln1jmNaa	is the line white or ghost like looking? if so i could be an evaporation line... it does happen because it happened to me...    but if i has SOME form of color, even if its the lightest color you have ever seen... its deff a positive and ur pregnant
bcZSIphUaa	Ya, dass shoulvd bein fine!      Sorry...talk to your doctor where you are now and vent your concerns - they should help make sure that you have all your history in order and he may have advice for you. Research about German fertility clinics etc on line. Germany is a very develped country and you should have the same access to treatment as you do now.    Remember that the most important thing is to relax...and who knows a change of scenery may just do the trick.      Have fun BD in Germany : )          B A B Y D U S T
yhpR2gNiaa	As long as it works for your daughter than it's right. Your daughter determines if the amount you are feeding her is right or wrong.|`|pXSKSS3daa	If that's what she wants, yes.    Feed your baby on demand and there won't be a right or wrong.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	Sounds close to my little girl.  She's probably 14.5lbs, and not yet 4 months, and will drink anywhere between 5 and 6 ounces, and sometimes she sucks the whole 6 ounces down in 20min, at her first bottle when she wakes up.|`|mGubEYTRaa	I would just feed her when she is hungry, I mean, it sounds right but it's been awhile.  Also, my friends daughter is 15 lbs at 8 weeks.  Your daughter should triple her birth weight by the time she turns 1.      I think I did 8oz every 4 or 5 hours at that age.... I don't know if I helped or not.|`|3MelQFxOaa	If this is what your baby wants, go for it, and that is what my baby was going at the age, she is 7 months old, and just starting 7oz every 3-4 hours. They say, you can overfeed a baby, but you really can not. My doctor even said, you dont need to worry about food or weight of a baby, because they change so much during the first couple of years. Just give what your daughter asks for, and you are doing great!|`|qq1q0NEpaa	hehehe, sounds like my son!  At 4months he weighed in at 16lbs and was eating 8oz of formula every 2-3hours!  When I asked the doc his answer was "he's a growing boy!  Feed him!"  He also said it was okay to start him on solids at that point, which we did and he LOVES it.  He has 1 jar at night (veggies) and 1 jar during the day (fruits).  He now weighs about 18lbs and is very healthy.  He still has about 6 6-8oz bottles during the day as well :)|`|be3e5b583c027426a0f22b62804479f0aa	My daughter is 3 months old and eats 4-1/2 to 5 oz every 4 hours then goes about 6 hours at nighttime. She weighs 11 pounds, 12 ounces.|`|333c5241bfa6c1a5e5841be0e72681faaa	My daughter is almost 7 months and 19.5 pounds.  She eats 6 oz. every 3 hours, until 7 p.m. when she goes to sleep for for the night.  She didn't start 6 oz. until 5 months, but her weight gain was fine and she wasn't fussy after 4-5 oz.  If you're feeding your baby too much or too little you'll know.  Just be confident that Mommy knows best, despite all the advice you get.|`|50e0975b0e8c470ea8e974086f449b63aa	I would feed her if she is hungry...    I learned with my son that feeding by the clock doesn't work baby's eat when they are ready    My daughter will be 3 months on Thursday and she is drinking 6 ozs already and will look for more.    But she was only 5.5 ozs at birth at her last visit she was 9.12oz     If her pediatrician is not concerned about her weight you shouldn't either
KLG9FCWGaa	I think you should go to a doc you could be seriously ill, preggo, or anything. You shouldn't risk things like this. I wouldn't wear that patch if I were you cause if you are preggo it could kill your baby. PLEASE go to a doctor it would be the best thing for you and it is the only way to truly know whats wrong with you. If you are possibly preg think about your baby's life! I can't stress it enough, go to the doc it'll straighten everything up.    And remember if you are preg, this is what God wants for you.  God bless and good luck.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	Sounds to me like you may just have a really bad virus and your sick. If you got your period and your on protection, your most likely not pregnant. Just take some medicine and relax for a few days. good luck.
8yTP3jO8aa	I've never understood the idea of replacing formula with milk, and the practice bugs me.  I'm not trying to sound harsh or judgemental, but milk doesn't replace formula.  Solids replace formula and milk is added in as a drink.  <br>  <br>  So, because I believe that, we gave milk as a drink during meals (along with water so he wasn't forced to drink the milk), with snacks, and  that's about it.  I kept it totally separate from his formula feedings because I didn't want him to think that milk was supposed to be drank like formula, and I didn't want to get into that habit.  He transitioned very well from formula to solids, and did okay with letting milk be a drink in addition to water.|`|471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	I juat started giving it in a sippy at meals.|`|JP2h62qiaa	I had to mix it because hunter wouldn't take whole milk on it's own at first. Finally by a year he would. SO it is good we started trying to wean him around the same time as your doing now.   I did the following with every bottle.<br>  <br>   Week 1- I first mixed 5 ounces of formula with 1 ounce whole milk.<br>   Week 2- mixed 4 ounces formula to two ounce whole milk<br>   Week 3- mixed 3 ounces formula to 3 ounces whole milk<br>   Week 4 - mixed 2 ounces formula to  4 ounces whole milk<br>   Week 5- mixed 1 ounce formula to 5 ounces whole milk<br>    Week 6- WHOLE MILK!!! <br>  <br>  He had no problems other than some normal constipation, it wasn't even considered constipation, he was just off his schedule and a little harder to pass. Prunes and juice worked wonders though. As well as yogurt. Good luck.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	Ok so I obviously haven't done this yet considering Chloe is only 5 and half months old. BUT, my sister has three kids all who made the transition to whole milk really well.<br>  <br>  She always started to introduce the whole milk in a morning bottle. That way, if it upset the tummy, it wasn't during the night where it would take away from sleep time. Also, during the day allowed for any allergies to be seen right away. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|Lz2N7D0yaa	We did the same with my son when he was 9 months old. He would never drink an entire 8 oz bottle, so we would give him 4 oz of formula and 2 oz of whole milk for a month, then we did 2oz of formula and 4 oz of whole milk for another month. then we made the switcch to al whole milk and he did just fine. Now he says "mik" when he wants his milk. it's cute.|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	My son had a very sensitive tummy so we started him gradually. We mixed it with formula little by little and by his first birthday (We started at 11 months) he was completely off of formula. He was also off of the bottle by his birthday too.|`|Yx5GlOJDaa	When my son got old enough for whole milk what i did was i would mix half water and half milk because his doctor told me to cause he had problems with the formula he was on at birth and was on soy formula. But i would mix 1 oz water and the rest milk if you would like or what you could do is talk to your son's pediatrician before introducing him to whole milk and see what he or she says you should do. Just to be sure!!!!|`|Szxce0uUaa	i slowly introduced it to my son i would mix it in with formula starting with 1/4 milk 3/4 fomula then every week add a little more milk till he was just on milk.|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	thats exactly how all mine started, slowly replacing one a day :)
rhPCJfeuaa	We have dinner all together and discuss our day, though our little ones are still young.  It is very rewarding for them to know that we are a family who is interested in each other's lives.  We also eat breakfast together, and I sit down to lunch with them every day.  Even though they don't participate too much about their day, you'd be amazed at what they pick up just from listening to mommy and daddy talking.  They get to see, first hand, what a healthy relationship between a man and a woman sounds like, looks like, and feels like.  Hopefully, they will take that knowledge into the world when they pick someone to love.|`|A8ofpjUiaa	Husband, kids and I all have dinner together at the table every night. My children are both under 4, so we spend this time chatting and as a means of teaching them table manners. Maybe once or twice a month we may have a 'picnic' in the lounge room which is when we'll have hotdogs and chips or something the older one chooses (since the other one is still too young to decide).|`|JivuAmfiaa	I have dinner with my kids every single night and my husband tries to make it home from work in time if at all possible. I too find it rewarding, we can just sit at the table and talk, although some of the time it's just arguments between the kids, it's still the best part of my day.|`|64OsCr8laa	my parents always made us all be at the table eating everytime something was done for everyone whether she cooks or ordered pizza <br>  <br>  before every meal we said our blessing and ate as a family i cant see it any different and i do love that idea i really think it open the lines of comunication we would always feel so important with dad telling us about him day then asking about our day <br>  <br>  i believe it is a positive impact|`|rTaaIXSuaa	You don't see this anymore. I see a lot of families in front of a television eating their dinner. <br>  I was raised in a very strict family oriented atmosphere and it has passed down to me.<br>  We always have dinner at the table. No tv to distract us. <br>  It is a great way to open up and communicate.|`|K1kZlWY8aa	Yeah, we eat dinner together at least 4 times a week. Sometimes it's hard because my fiance works until 9pm on Tues and Thurs, so we can't eat together then -- it's too late.<br>  I always eat dinner with my 2 year old daughter though, and eat another small meal with my fiance.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	We have dinner every night at the table together and talk about our day.|`|92529423230d8afd2de97a390c4c8c8faa	Our family eats dinner together at the dining room table on the nights we don't have a game, practice, or Cub Scouts.|`|3c8GsRvUaa	i do every night and its a rule in my house just cause i never had to when i was young.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	During the week it's just my hubby and I and our 7 month old, so we eat in the living room and rarely in the dining room. On the weekends when my 7 year old stepson is here, we always eat together at the table. When my baby is a little older we'll start eating with him in the dining room too.|`|SJx9IWWtaa	If its a big home cooked meal we eat at the table.  If we ordered pizza, we usually pop in a movie and make up some popcorn.    :D  Its still eating together, but with an activity. haha  <br>  <br>  When I was growing up, it was just me and my mom.  We almost never ate dinner together.  I usually ate before she even got home from work, or ate at a friends house.  We are still close, I tell her everything.  So I don't think eating together will make or break your childs growth.  <br>  <br>  But I decided I wanted our family to eat together because I remember how much nicer it felt when I would eat a friends house and her whole family was eating together.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	We do, every evening. As you say it IS very valuable to the family as a whole.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Me and my kids do but my husband usually is playing video games or in the other room doing whatever|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	every night that they aren't sick and asleep at dinner time. I will not wake up a sick sleeping child!
xMy0QEvFaa	Yes, I love playing with my baby bump. There's only a few I can actually make out though.<br>  <br>  My son loves his daddy, he goes crazy when he hears his voice Lol|`|V8GrFx0jaa	I could always feel my baby's butt and feet, as she would stretch out her legs and I'd feel a butt on one side and one or two feet on the other side. Glad SHE was comfortable! :)|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	My Daughter would dig her heel into me she would always kick the crap out of me.I miss those days.Enjoy every minute of you pregnancy.My kids are almost grown.well 1 is already and the other 2 are working there way up.I miss the baby yrs.|`|GhrJVbFEaa	I have thought that I could feel the shape of the baby's body later in the pregnancy. At about 23 weeks (my 3rd), I am feeling movement but not specific body shape. I think it is much later when the baby is bigger and the uterus is really stretched. Not sure, but maybe easier to feel if you have less extra body weight? Anyway, enjoy your pregnancy and good luck with everything. Feeling all those little parts are probably one more way to connect and bond with your new little person.|`|aohKqXraaa	Yep.. it's amazing!|`|Bxvs28oBaa	yes i can feel little feet pushing thrue my tummy|`|atrObg5saa	not really my tummy feels a little hard
AA10672842	There is a new show on TLC called Tiaras and Toddlers and it is all about children,their parents and pageants. From  what I'vee seen it appears it is mostly about the parents.It is not uncommon to see you children , some barely babies, being carried around, lead around and further forced to parade and pose on a stage.I find it  very hard to believe a baby asked  anyone to be in a pageant.Even when you hear the children having temper tantrums and clearly not enjoying themselves, the parent will say " If my daughter says she doesn't want to be in pageants anymore then I will stop entering her in them " I'd like to ask the mother whose daughter  ( about 8-10years old)  won a car, who is driving the car and what was in it for the daughter.Some of the costumes , the cost of  travel and the entry fees are not for the faint of heart.These pageants are all about big business not the welfare or emotional well being of a child.Whose dream is it anyway?|`|SsfnitjXaa	Thank goodness not that many mommy's are into them. People have a right to raise their children as they seem fit (within the law).  Some parents do not allow the internet, some insist on church every day.  <br>  <br>  If you don't like them, don't participate.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Disgusting as far as "toddlers and tiaras" are.<br>  <br>  If it's just a all natural no make up, spray tan and fake teeth pageant, I think they are cool.|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	I think they are done for totally the wrong reasons.  I couldn't imagine putting my two or three year old in an actual beauty pageant (cute as they may be!)  There is even this horrendous new show.  The mothers of these young children, practically toddlers, act so shallow.  What kind of morals are they raising their children with?|`|QsVMeaPXaa	I dislike them. If the girls were just allowed to be their age and act like it, but making them wear makeup, adult hair styles, spray on tans and posing like strippers...very sick.  What a thing to do to an impressionable child.|`|u4FUeppNaa	i think if your child is old enough to say that they want to be in a pageant that's one thing, but those "pageant moms" are what i find disturbing.|`|prqrQcd1aa	You are not alone. I have 3 daughters and I will never allow them to do something like this where they are viewed as "objects".|`|SJx9IWWtaa	I think they went to far.  I was in a baby pageant, but it was just me.  No make-up, fake teeth, or anything crazy.  Just me and a normal baby dress lol   <br>  <br>  I think pageants would be ok if it was just the girls themselves.  Ya sure do there hair up, or a cute (not slutty dress).  But how can you really "judge" them if 99% of how they looks is fake crap that their parents forced them to wear?  <br>  <br>  But no make-up, hair extensions, wigs!!  I was watching a show about pageants and when a mom literally pulled out FAKE teeth so that her daughters teeth would look perfectly strait at age 5, I had to change the channel.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Yeah, I think they're disturbing too.<br>  Dressing them up, and making them look like dolls. <br>  It's sickening.<br>  <br>  I mean, yeah it's nice for other people to tell you your daughter is the prettiest and the cutest - but the process and extremes they put those little girls through is just awful and disgusting.|`|r5CttpsFaa	they're extremely creepy. find me a regular patron of child pageants who doesn't have a child competing or isn't a pedophile, and i will personally mail you a dollar|`|BRT2teSqaa	It's sick.  A pedophile's dream.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Nope it's not just you. It is exploiting children in the most sugar coated way possible|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Sickening|`|hZf8aJkYaa	Wrong|`|1qxhPyXzaa	DISGUSTING!!!!!!!!!!!!
WxQFe0GYaa	The best kind of walker is none at all!  They do not help a baby learn to walk, and they can actually hinder the development.  They are not recommended by anyone, and some groups are looking to have them banned.  I'll find a link for you.<br>  <br>  My son is 8 months old, has never been in a walker, and is pulling up and cruising.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/babies-kids/baby-toddler/play-and-activity/walkers/baby-walkers-1105/overview/" rel="nofollow">http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/babie...</a>|`|UMRdHuuVaa	We have a steelcraft brand walker for my son, we bought it at big w here in australia.<br>  it had brakes on it and one big wheel which u can remove to let them swivel around etc.<br>  Walkers strengthen their legs and helps them get ready for standing, pulling themselves up on things and walking.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i bought one at babies r us for my dd that we are really happy with; they had several to choose from...|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	My son likes the walker he has. It's made by Baby Trend and it was not very expensive. He doesn't really "walk" in it. He mostly lunges places or I push him around the house and his little socks just slide around the floor. Other times he just sits up in it and plays with his toys.
nIE5Qtiqaa	Your never gonna belive  this, but I am nineteen and pregnant and also on my parents insurance!!! Anyway, I think your talking about MEDICADE because Medicare is for old people lol. But, like I said I'm on my parents insurance and have Medicade as my secondary, so yeah it can be done. Go to your local DHHR Office and sign up. Good luck! Let me know if you need anything!|`|sm89EL4caa	In my situation, I was on my fathers insurance too. I went to the local health department where they signed me up for W.I.C. and Medicaid. I got approved within minutes and they printed out a temporary Medicaid card for me to use to go to the doctor. Later that week my dad called and had me dropped from his insurance. So as far as my situation went I got the Medicaid without actually being removed from his insurance first. I hope this helps, and good luck with your pregnancy!|`|EJl2RvDfaa	Its medicaid and if your insurance covers maternity they might dual insure you if you qualify with their income requirements. It just depends on what your states rules are and what kind of insurance your parents have<br>  <br>  Congrats on the pregnancy.|`|J3JClsuQaa	I think ya mean medicaid, and yes you could go apply and see what they say...you might have to drop theirs...|`|gug3p3aZaa	Im 19 and pregnant and on medicaid and my mom insurance. It depends on what kind of insurance your mom have (we have Atena). The only thing Atena only pays a portion and after i have my son there releasing me from her insurance. Good Luck!|`|yR5PW7QFaa	By google to collect some related information or you may try using answer engines like yahoo answer or yedda.com to get some related ideas.nonetheless,If you prefer some direct resource,here <a href="http://www.insuranceidea.info/free-insurance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.insuranceidea.info/free-insur...</a>  is a good one from my own experience.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	You can get medicare but your parents would have to drop you from their insurance first.|`|5WP9rLTlaa	Hi from Australia!<br>  we call it medicare over here- medicaid is America. Different system entirely.<br>  Medicare is the government medical safety net that insures no Australian is left without access to vital medical assistance when it is needed. All Australians have it, it is covered by our taxes, you can apply for a medicare card at your local medicare office, If I remember correctly it is free to get one and boy does it help to have one if you have to go to a hospital other than your local one.<br>  Private health insurance means that you can get upgrades like being able to get a private room or use a private hospital (where the food is better!) It also means you might be able to get the midwife/doctor of your choice.
Z4PxfObXaa	Why would you quit birth control?<br>  It's better to be on it, for tons of reasons.<br>  Even if you aren't having sex, it has benefits like improving your skin and shortening your periods or keeping them regular.<br>  But anyway... yea, you might be pregnant.<br>  Go get a pregnancy test if you really wanna know.<br>  Sitting around and doing nothing about it won't get you anywhere.<br>  So don't worry until you know for sure.<br>  Good luck.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	It's called an over the counter pregnancy test.|`|4VIjILk1aa	The pull out method does not work. My husband and I did the pull out method and I ended up pregnant. When you stop using your birth control is when your body has a greater chance on getting pregnant. Just wait 2 weeks and if you still don't get your period then take a test or go to your doctor.|`|3Boqr4Jjaa	Whats there to worry about? You didn't care about continuing your birth control so why should you care about being pregnant?<br>  <br>  RN|`|zzHWO4Haaa	I think before you start to worry you should get a pregnancy test.|`|Pfge6j7Aaa	There is always precum you could be pregnant
FiUprYsvaa	How old would you let your daughter be when:<br>  <br>  Start wearing make up- Summer before middle school, so she would have time to practice and get things right. I would show her how to make all the looks and what looked good. I would let her use cover up,blush, eyeliner, mascara and shadow that went with her skin tone but I would make sure it looked good and not over done or too much.<br>  <br>  Go to the mall/movies with a friend-Middle school just like I was. <br>  <br>  Have a boyfriend (not just a little see each other at school thing)- 8th grade. <br>  <br>  First cell phone- There would get one starting at the beginning of kindergarten and it would change every 2 years, with contract renewal.<br>  So,<br>  K-2nd Firefly<br>  2nd-6th Basic phone, no texting, shared minutes, limited numbers it can call.<br>  6th-8th-free-cheap phone, unlimited texting(but not allowed to spend all time, i'll watch over how many, shared minutes, can call any number.<br>  8th-10th-cool phone, unlimited texting(at this age i wont care how many), shared minuted, can call any number.<br>  10th-12th- whatever phone they want but if its expensive they have to help pay for some of it, unlimited texting(Its only 10 dollars btw), can call any numbers.<br>  Internet privileges- When I have kids they will always know how to use a computer, like in that windows commerical with that little girl, "I am a PC and I a 4 1/2 years old".<br>  I will always have content blockers.<br>  They can have a myspace or facebook in middle school. AIM and messengers as well, maybe earlier to talk to family and friends. Like 10ish.<br>  They can have a laptop in their rooms starting high school. <br>  The thing is my kids will be trustworthy and smart. <br>  <br>  Not have a set bed time- Middle school. <br>  <br>  Piercings (anything besides 1 ear piercing)-Whenever as long as they know how to take care of them. <br>  <br>  Dye hair- middle school<br>  <br>  Shave legs- I started in 5th grade because that is when everyone else started and I felt self conscious about wearing shorts. When they serisously want to and it makes them self conscious. <br>  <br>  Go to first sleep over- any age. Sleep overs are great. As long as I know the parents. <br>  <br>  Stay home alone- I started coming home off the bus and staying alone for short periods of time around 9. So maybe then. <br>  <br>  Go for a walk or bike ride in the neighborhood- 8 or 9 with friends. 10 or 11 alone.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I will raise my kids right and they will be very smart but I will allow them a lot of freedoms so they won't feel like they have to go behind my back doing things and so they won't feel like the odd man out amonst their peers. My kids won't feel the need to rebel or do bad things. I know I sound overly confident for someone who doesn't have kids but I really think my method will work. If my method does work as soon as my kids turn 18, ill write a book and from the money I make from the book, Ill pay for my kids college.|`|GfCjZJbXaa	How old would you let your daughter be when:<br>  Start wearing make up- I started at 10 but only light colors and no eyeliner and mascara<br>  <br>  Go to the mall/movies with a friend-12<br>  <br>  Have a boyfriend (not just a little see each other at school thing)- If you mean alone then 13.With a parents or a group 12<br>  <br>  First cell phone-Got mine at 10.She will to but only for emergencies.At 12 she can use it for fun<br>  <br>  Internet privileges-11 for kids sites like Neopets and clubpenguin.I wouldnt let her ever have a myspace or facebook.Ya ya call me strict but those things are full of drama<br>  <br>  Not have a set bed time-At 12.She would at least have to sleep at 11:30.All my kids would until college.But in the Summer whatever time is fine<br>  <br>  Piercings (anything besides 1 ear piercing)-At 13 she could get a second ear piercing.No other piercings until she is 18.<br>  <br>  Dye hair-At 13.I would never hold my child back from dressing the way they want as long as it is in the schools dress code<br>  <br>  Shave legs- When she needed to.All girls have different amounts of hair on their legs.If she wanted to wear shorts and had hairy legs and asked me to shave I would let her.<br>  <br>  Go to first sleep over-8<br>  <br>  Stay home alone- 12 but she must know that if she was in trouble she had my number and knew where to go if somebody was in the house<br>  <br>  Go for a walk or bike ride in the neighborhood-11.To many freaks out there|`|kRaVa0Wraa	i agree with  you on everything, actually.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	I'm far from a parent, but if I had a daughter this is what I would do:<br>  Light make-up? 13. Lip gloss and mascara aren't that big of a deal.<br>  Movies/Mall with a friend - 13 for a movie. 15 for the mall. <br>  Have a boyfriend - 16.<br>  First cell phone - 12.<br>  Internet privileges - 6 for kid-friendly websites. 9 for email so she can talk to only her friends. 12/13 for signing up for websites like Y!A.<br>  Not have a set bedtime - 18. When you're 18, then you go to  bed whenever you want.<br>  Shave legs: 13.<br>  First sleepover: 6. As long as she was comfortable staying the night there then I'm sure it would be fine.<br>  Stay home alone: 14 or 15. <br>  Go for a walk or bike ride: 16 and with a friend. Sorry, but I would be too worried if my child was walking outside without any supervision. You just never know what can happen.<br>  Piercings - For a second ear piercing, 15. Anything else, 18.<br>  Hair dye: 12/13 for something that will wash out eventually. Permanent hair dye? 16.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	How old would you let your daughter be when:<br>  Start wearing make up: She can wear lip gloss when she starts junior high. Eyeliner and face makeup is for high school. <br>  <br>  Go to the mall/movies with a friend: With a group of friends, 11 - 13. With one or two friends, 13. <br>  <br>  Have a boyfriend (not just a little see each other at school thing): At school, I don't really mind. But when she wants to hang out at the mall with him and go to the movies, 14 or 15.<br>  <br>  First cell phone: When she starts junior high. <br>  <br>  Internet privileges: When she's old enough to use it. I personally get annoyed with the internet, but these days that's the new technology - everything is done on there. <br>  <br>  Not have a set bed time: Maybe 7th or 8th grade. I mean, she'll always have a bedtime or at least a bed recommendation even when she's in High School i'll expect her to be in bed by midnight. I just won't send her to bed and turn off her TV like I did when she was 9.  <br>  <br>  Piercings (anything besides 1 ear piercing): High school for facial piercings and her navel. But i'd stop it after 2 or 3. Like, the nose or lip or septum are okay. I don't like those eyebrow or tongue piercings. When she's in junior high i'd allow a cartilage or second ear piercing. <br>  <br>  Dye hair: Junior high for highlights, but if she wants to go blonde or black, high school. <br>  <br>  Shave legs: When she starts junior high. <br>  <br>  Go to first sleep over: When she tells me she's been invited to one. But if it's a neighborhood girl or me and the mom are friends, I don't see the problem with it when she's 6 or 7. <br>  <br>  Stay home alone: For a few hours, 11 or 12. For the night, maybe 15 or 16. <br>  <br>  Go for a walk or bike ride in the neighborhood: Alone, 12.

When she reaches 13 I guess whenever she really wants as long as it is not too dark/slutty or anything. <br>  <br>  Go to the mall/movies with a friend- 12<br>  <br>  Have a boyfriend (not just a little see each other at school thing)- 13 -- she could start going on dates etc. but I would make sure I at least had seen the guys' parents around. <br>  <br>  First cell phone- 13 (aka year 7) so that she can contact me from high school.<br>  <br>  Internet privileges- Whenever, as long as I am supervising her. About 11-12 when I would let her have more freedom, but I would see the sites she is on. At 13 I'd let her sign up for what she wanted, but make sure I looked at her internet usage every now and then.<br>  <br>  Not have a set bed time- About 13 when I'd just send her to bed and let her stay up in her bedroom until about 10, then I'd shut off the lights. 16 when she has no bedtime at all.<br>  <br>  Piercings (anything besides 1 ear piercing)- 12 I'd let her get her ear(s) pierced again. 15 and I'd let her get anything else like tongue, belly button, lip etc.<br>  <br>  Dye hair- 13, but nothing too out there. 15 when she could do what she wanted, lol.<br>  <br>  Shave legs- When she needs to.<br>  <br>  Go to first sleep over- When she starts asking and I think she seems ready.<br>  <br>  Stay home alone- 13 - legal age.<br>  <br>  Go for a walk or bike ride in the neighborhood- Well, where we live it'd be about 12, but 10ish with friends.|`|zzHWO4Haaa	How old would you let your daughter be when:<br>  Start wearing make up- In middle school. 6th grade. Only light colors made for young girls. Once she got into high school I'd let her do what she wanted to do. I want her to be able to express herself and find out things that she likes on her own... Without me telling her she can't.<br>  <br>  Go to the mall/movies with a friend- With parental supervision... any age because I would sit with her. When she's 11-14 I would go to the theater but not sit with her. I would sit far enough away to let her feel independent, but not so far that I couldn't protect her if necessary. When she turned 15, I would allow her to go by herself.<br>  <br>  Have a boyfriend (not just a little see each other at school thing)- It would really depend on how mature she is. Children mature at different ages. I would not want my daughter to be having a relationship involving sexual acts before she was 16 years old... If I knew there was no sex going on, I'd let her start dating around 13-14.<br>  <br>  First cell phone- Whenever she starts to become more social and goes out places without me there with her. So I guess about 12+.<br>  <br>  Internet privileges- I would let her play children game sites when she turned 7. When she turns 13 she could have an instant messaging program to chat with friends. I'd supervise her though just to be sure that no online predators are luring her in with anything.<br>  <br>  Not have a set bed time- When she's 13 years old, I wouldn't have a set bedtime anymore because if she wants to stay up late, she has to deal with the consequences of waking up for school. It would teach her responsibility and I'm sure over time she would stop staying up extremely late. I would encourage her to be in bed by 10:00-10:30, though. And hopefully she'd listen to her mommy. ;)<br>  <br>  Piercings (anything besides 1 ear piercing)- If she wanted a second ear piercing I'd let her get that at 10 years old. If she wanted a third or more, she could at 13. If she wanted some other sort of body piercing, depending on what it is, I would not let her get one any younger than 15-16.<br>  <br>  Dye hair- It depends... If it's highlights then she could get those whenever she wanted to. If it's a total new color, I'd wait until 14-15.<br>  <br>  Shave legs- Whenever it started to get noticable and/or when she asks me about it.<br>  <br>  Go to first sleep over- 6 years old. I would have to KNOW the parents though. I would have no problem going to get her in the middle of the night no matter what age she is.<br>  <br>  Stay home alone- I wouldn't let her stay home alone until she was about 13 years old. Not because I don't think that she'd be responsible, but I would want her to be safe. If I had no other choice, I'd try to do it around 11-12 and make sure she had microwavable food so she wouldn't use the stove.<br>  <br>  Go for a walk or bike ride in the neighborhood- Depending on the time of day... If it's daylight outside, then 10 years old with a friend, 13 by herself. If it's dark outside she would not be able to walk alone until she was 16-17.

cen8SIssaa	my first pregnancy i was offered 3 classes for free: <br>  <br>  preperation for childbirth / breastfeeding / and baby basics<br>  <br>  but then my insurance got switched and suddenly i had to pay for them and the most expensive was the prep for childbirth and that was about 2-3 hundred for 6 weeks and the other 2 were like $75 for the breastfeeding class which was 2 weeks and $50 for the baby basics which was one week.<br>  <br>  I loved all the classes!! i found to be very helpful and very informative. and most of all that was such a great experience that i still think about till this day. Just remembering the feeling of how excited i was and all that great stuff.<br>  <br>  I really would want to do the classes all of over again with this one but obviously that would be a waste of money that we def dont have...LOL<br>  <br>  Great luck and take care!|`|UXoTCL98aa	If your check your local hospitals in your area you might find cheaper but still respected childbirthing classes. I have always wanted to attend some childbirthing classes before I give birth, but when recently was looking into some prices, became discouraged. The local hospitals (st.marys and deaconnes) offer some that will run you about 60 dollars. These are taught by trained professionals and have smaller class sizes as well so you can get extra help.  The one that i will be taken in the summer you have the option to do a 8 hour "intense" saturday class or a 4 session class that lasts for 2 hours each session. We are going to do the one day intense class bc it is more convienent for us and our schedules to just do it in one day.|`|bQTATDTyaa	I really liked Bradley classes, it was 300 for 12 weeks. It's very informative and includes dad very well so it helps prepare them too.<br>  <br>  It's expensive but well worth it for the first time. I knew better what to expect and was part of my preparation for an unassisted home birth, which went awesome.<br>  <br>  Google Bradley Birth Classes for the website which lists instructors.<br>  <br>  Oh, and check the bases, in Hawaii we can get almost everything discounted or on base for cheap or free, including classes and couseling.
WxQFe0GYaa	What else is she eating?  What solids is she on?  They could be contributing to the problem.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	you need to talk with your doc asap about this and get something that works for her....|`|AA11540024	it's probably because you switched her over to formula. What else is she eating? Bananas will constipate her. As long as she has a bowel movement i wouldn't worry. It's a bit of a job for them to get "it" out.
im1pB72Saa	My oldest at about 1 1/2 always wanted me to pee with him while potty training because my hubby would. I would always pretend to go or go after him just to help along the learning and he soon realized I didnt have a penis. he exclaimed "your pee your pee's gone" I think I laughed for an hour. He always likes to point out that mommy lost her "yaya" and my boobs are too big cause he and daddy and brother don't have any. WHen he understands more he will ask where yours is....I am waiting for my youngest to ask...he just points at it now :/|`|575e1deabe166d4e96a463af1361e72faa	I'm one of those people who doesn't think it's appropriate for sons (no matter how little) to see the "parts" of others - but especially of their mothers.  (The same for daughters, for that matter.)<br>  <br>  The way I see it, even if they're too little for it to really matter much - why introduce a new and unnecessary complication?   On the other hand, if they're old enough to really be noticing differences, they're probably too old to be seeing those differences in adults.<br>  <br>  There's something to be said for a few healthy boundaries between parents and children.  Even when there are, children manage to learn about differences fairly early.
JnLoHaoAaa	I read a lot of stories to my child, some of them being from the Disney storybook, Eric Carle books, Baby Einstein books, Beatrix Potter, etc.|`|FwJLD1uDaa	oh gosh i dont sing the creepy stuff like rock a bye baby and ring around the rosie, or even jack and jill. do you know what those mean?? so morbid. anyway, twinkle twinkle little star, some books i used to love, and slow sweet songs that i make up as i go about them :)|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I read different books to my daughter, disney books, Barbie, she loves the Skippy Jon Jones books.

If you never use protection you have a 50-50 chance if she's lying about the condom. Obviously you could be the father.

I give her cereal for breakfast (10 am) and then I nurse her. I give her veggies and nurse her at lunch (2 pm). For dinner (6 pm) I give her cereal, veggies and nurse her. Finally around 10 pm I nurse her right before bed. She sleeps from about 10:00 pm -10:00 am straight each night. I started with 1 TBS of cereal each day until I got up to 4 TBS. I also increase the amount of veggies each day until she gets to the amount of one full small jar. She will soon start fruits, which probably will be mixed in with breakfast and lunch.

AA11540024	It gets easier with the second one because you learned it all with the first one. If you feel guilty about not giving the first one enough attention, include her when you do something with the baby (feeding, bath). You'll be surprised how much help your daughter can be with helping mommy with the new baby.<br>  Good luck!|`|SsfnitjXaa	My children are 5 years apart and I can't believe how much more work it is.

FS8n1FUQaa	You know, I saw your question a few minutes ago, and almost answered that I didn't like it, but now that I've thought about it, I kinda like it.  It's unusual, but not difficult for others to spell or pronounce.  To be safe, I'd follow Oslo with a classic name like Michael or Malcolm.|`|Elxuvon8aa	It looks like a misspelling of something  I thought Oh so Slow So no I really dislike it|`|2rOQyvaKaa	No. I like Marcus Shane McFarlane|`|rbRQCTQfaa	Ooh, yeah i really like it.

For a middle name I like<br>  Oslo Henry McFarlane|`|AA12229787	Oslo accords?|`|igvUbqkyaa	It is kinda cool sounding I guess.|`|EMKuBql8aa	Nope, sounds like somethingI name a dog|`|tHEBPDenaa	I'm not a huge fan of the name... but I don't dislike it. However, I've never met anyone with it before so maybe it's one of those names that grows on you the more you hear it!<br>  <br>  I would use something long for a middle name. I think Alexander would sound good with it.|`|DCJAMtkHaa	As in Oslo the capital of Norway?<br>  <br>  I'm not big on geography names so I'm really not a huge fan of the name - sorry.|`|B7nqTcttaa	Heeeeellllll no! Worst name ever! What about Oliver Grey Mcfarlane|`|BRT2teSqaa	Woah.. NO!|`|Uj1QQejQaa	It's okay for a middle name .<br>  <br>  I love the fact that it's original .|`|XfCEooqSaa	no way sry|`|j2qrOjo1aa	nope|`|UWx1beYtaa	As the other guy said, its something you'd name your dog.<br>  <br>  To tell you the truth, that name would suit someone who was fat, lazy, on the dole, and sitting on the couch their whole life.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to be brutal but thats just how I feel.
de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	What test did you use?  Some can detect pregnancy much earlier than other brands.  (For instance, I once took one that could detect levels at 20 HCG and it was positive 8 days past ovulation, but there are others that wouldn't have given a positive result until I was a day late.)  <br>  <br>  If you were pregnant from the 19th, they possibly may be able to see the fetus, but not necessarily.  <br>  <br>  Do you have any idea when you ovulated?  If you think back, can you remember when your body produced a stretchy cervical mucous?  How long are your cycles?|`|9FztHceJaa	go to yourdays.com and type in ur last period it will give you your conception days but im sure you watch maury and how hurt these guys are after finding out later i don't mean to sound low but be a woman and be honest now is the time to grow up good luck|`|tAFPbAUaaa	Yes, they should have been able to pick something up on the ultrasound if you had conceived on Jan. 19th. When you went to the doctor, did they draw your blood to test the level of hcg in your system? If not, you could ask your doctor to order this test. It is pretty accurate when it comes to pinpointing dates as long as it's in the early stage.<br>  There would have been enough hcg in your urine to test positive 13 days after conception. Some women get positives ten or eleven days after conception.<br>  Good luck and I hope it works out the way you want it to. Either way, you're going to have a healthy happy bouncing bundle of joy!
LDiBjNf5aa	Are you taking prenatal vitamins? It's most likely due to that|`|kaqPSgTVaa	No that's not a symptom of pregnancy. Strong smelling urine is usually a sign of dehydration or infection. Call your doctor's office in the morning and let them know.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I've had the same thing. I'm pretty sure it's a combination of the lovely pregnancy hormones and prenatal vitamins. I was checked for a UTI since  I thought something had to be wrong, it was fine though. But, it's pretty common for everything to smell different, including your sweat. The hormones do crazy things to you!|`|zSABr7praa	Hmm.. I haven't noticed an odor, but I do know the color is different.  I try to drink close to a gallon of water each day, and my urine is STILL very dark.  I was concerned and brought it up with my doctor, and he told me it was just my prenatals :)<br>  Has this been consistent your entire pregnancy, it could be your prenatals as well.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	The first time I noticed that my urine smelled, I also had urgency and slight burning during urination and my doctor did a urine culture and indeed I had a UTI.  I was placed on Macrobid for 7 days. Smelly urine is usually a sign of bacterial infection in the urine.  If you are drinking lots of water and still notice the smell call your doctor maybe he/she can do a urine culture.|`|hmQDjHs6aa	Sometimes, my pee smells strong but I eat alot of broccoli, aspearasgus, brussel sprouts, ect, ect<br>  BUT one thing u may or may not be taking into account is ur strong sense of smell right now?? <br>  I'm not sure though. and I'm sure ur doctor has tested u OVER and OVER for uti, but mabe have them do it again juss incase.<br>  Good luck >^.^<|`|E2UXN7J1aa	I asked my doctor about this and he told me that it could be a mix of my prenatal vitamins causing an odor and me picking up on it more, because my sense of smell was heightened. I had been checked for a UTI though so he knew it wasn't that. It is possible that a UTI could cause this as well though. :)|`|GhrJVbFEaa	I have certain noticed a change in urine during pregnancy. I have even been to the doctor and asked questions about it. I also did test for kidney or bladder infections. I really notice this when I might be a bit dehydrated. I think it is even more important to drink lots and lots of water during pregnancy. For me, this is just an extra reminder. Perhaps when we are dehydrated there is an extra high concentration of pregnancy hormes in the urine. I just looked it up and there are lots of people asking this same question on the internet. Seems to be a common (and normal) pregnancy thing.  You could try a website like babycenter.com for more info.  Check in with your doctor if you are really concerned. Good luck with everything. Enjoy the rest of your pregnancy.|`|cen8SIssaa	That has happened to me a couple times and every time it was a UTI...which is common for women but a pregnant woman its even more common! <br>  <br>  On your next visit tell your doctor about it and they will check your urine and most likely give you an antibiotic which is completely safe.<br>  <br>  Great luck to you and CONGRATS!|`|aohKqXraaa	I can't remember how many weeks I was when I remember having a very strong odor to my urine, but I do recall having the same thing, as well as very dark urine.  I believe it's totally normal though as my doctor was not alarmed by this.|`|tRrzHOCRaa	yes....it is due to the hormone changes your body is experiencing....or you may have a bladder infection!! i experienced each answer one with each of my two boys...so check with your doc cause if its a bladder infection you need to treat it!! good-luck|`|3Boqr4Jjaa	You are not crazy! There are changes in body chemistry during pregnancy. Make sure that you are drinking plenty of water to flush your system. If this is of continued concern ask your Doctor.<br>  <br>  RN|`|HXh7u0lEaa	I haven't but I think someone asked this question last week. I would look it up and also go to the Dr to make sure it's not a UTI.|`|lM6ePQLiaa	Because of your hormones and the vitamins you take.<br>  Its quite normal.
GhrJVbFEaa	Yes, you could be pregnant. Ovulation sites are usually refering to the average person and average ovulation pattern, which is 14 days back from the start of your next period. This is easiest to calculate if you have a really regular period. My first two pregnancies were predictable based on these theories, but with my third I am pretty sure I got pregnant only a day or two after my period ended. Not the "typical" 14 days in or 14 days back that is supposedly standard for a woman with a 28 day cycle. It can vary. Yes, sperm can live something like 72 hours.  Wait until your next period is due and if you don't get it, take a test. You can also try testing a few days before, but do it first thing in the morning when hormones levels would be the most concentrated.  Try not to sweat it. Hopefully if you are having unprotected sex you are with your long term partner and raising a little one isn't out of the question.  Best of luck to you.|`|kaqPSgTVaa	Yup. Sperm can live in your body for up to 72 hours. Those ovulation sites only can guess or give you an idea of when you ovulate. You can ovulate anywhere from the yesterday to the 24th really. <br>  <br>  Wait a few weeks and if you don't get your period take a test.|`|irHF6CBPaa	It does not matter when the web site says you are  ovulating It also depends in how long your menstrual cycle is With out protection there is always a possibility of pregnancy just wait to see if you miss you period if you do take  a test Also if you are not looking to get pregnant  use some type of BC I don't recommend the pill you could always forget to take it and wind up pregnant just look at some BC web sites and see which one fits best for you BC is free in many clinic you just have to do your research and if you are trying to get pregnant Good Luck and Happy baby making|`|AtVRWrwCaa	Sperm can live up to 3 days inside you. there is a very tiny chance that you may get pregnant, but its very unlikely.|`|3hBQz33Yaa	with out protection it doesn't matter if your ovulating or not..there is ALWAYS a chance of getting pregnant|`|3Boqr4Jjaa	One never knows! USE PROTECTION !!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  RN|`|Pfge6j7Aaa	If you didn't use protection then you have a chance of being pregnant.|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Well DUH
OHfZFR31aa	Pretty good! Hopefully you were trying to get pregnant because you did all the right things|`|yV373JUiaa	25% chance of conceptin for every cycle where you have unprotected sex, are not on birth contol, and time sex to ovulation. <br>  <br>  You can buy a test 2 weeks after your ovulation date.|`|1thzSbS8aa	Your chances are one in four, same as any other woman who was trying to get pregnant.|`|SxgOy9uPaa	Pretty good..|`|nBHSCu0Xaa	Seems to me like you just answered your own question, doesn't it?|`|PPoCaJEEaa	Take a wild guess genius =/|`|NYJgiVxraa	twice eh? well better chance then not. take a test asap, within two weeks from now.
igvUbqkyaa	I honestly don't like any of them. But I guess the bests are Arabella and Arianna.|`|Elxuvon8aa	Arianna and Athena are the only ones I like|`|EccBqsntaa	Amaya and Arianna|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Top 3; <br>  Arianna.<br>  Briella.<br>  Athena.<br>  <br>  Bottom 3;<br>  Allura.<br>  Amala.<br>  Brandilyn.|`|xq7S9H5Raa	i like arianna|`|LJ0uNLlAaa	Cambree, its so cute.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Athena and Arabella are my favorites from your list.<br>  <br>  I also love A names!<br>  <br>  Alora is similar to Alura - and I really love Alora.|`|XRzSxgUnaa	I like Abriella, Arabella, Ambree, Amaya and Cambree.<br>  <br>  <br>  I also like the name Andra, Brielle and Cymbree which are close to your names<br>  <br>  <3|`|4VE5hQIhaa	Antonella,ariana,auriella,|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I've always liked Annika for some reason, but spelled Anika. Another name I like is Aubrienne, even though it's not listed it reminds me of your list a bit.|`|0c30f5fdc0cc17a33e0ba8fe4201b997aa	I only liked Annika off of your list.<br>  <br>  My aunt's name is Aurelia. It's pretty similar to a lot of the names you have on your list.|`|OVMb4V7Maa	Athena (love all things Greek lol), Abriella, Arabella, Allura, and Ambree.|`|j2qrOjo1aa	Brandilyn|`|tnu4mYKAaa	Amaya|`|UWx1beYtaa	Amala, Allura, Alura, Arianna, Ambree,|`|XG6fToHeaa	Annika, Abriana, Arianna, Ambree.|`|EKa5SeKOaa	Arianna for sure!!|`|bRMny9pXaa	I really like Abriella, and Ariella.
6Knhikr1aa	I carry the baby in a sling and push the middle child while the older one walks. I also have a double stroller ( side by side combi) and I can use it for many combos. Baby and 3 yr old ride 6 yr old walks. 3 and 6 ride baby in sling baby rides and 3 and 6 yr old take turns in other seat etc. <br>  In the beginning I really prefer to have baby in a sling or wrap and use the stroller if needed for the older one.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	would a twin double stroller hold forty lbs.? that might work....|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	Buy a umbrella double stroller OR if you can afford it buy a double jogging stroller. I have a double stroller and My 2 year old is big for his age height and weight he looks like a 4 year old and is taller than most of them and a 13 month old who has taken my jeans and is kind of short for his age (although pudgy *s*) And it worked out. I got mine from babies "r" us<br>  Tyffannie|`|lKXtfYFxaa	Most of the Sit N Stand strollers have a bar you can attach to it to put a car seat in.  They'll accommodate most of the different types of car carriages as well.  Also, different strollers have larger weight capacity like 50 lb.  <br>  <br>  I have a 10 month old baby and a fidgety 2 year old that will not sit in a traditional stroller but he's more incline to sit in the stand-n-sit stroller.  I think it's because he feels more "freedom" than being locked into an umbrella stroller.|`|B9KwqnuDaa	Put the infant in a wrap or sling (I prefer a wrap) and let the 4 year old walk/stroller.|`|AA11540024	get one of those double strollers
