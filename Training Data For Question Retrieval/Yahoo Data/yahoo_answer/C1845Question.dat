20090223113441AAJXErX	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Can I have 2 Wireless Routers in 1 House?	Hi. So basicly, I have just moved my Xbox 360 upstairs, and the only way I can actually get Xbox Live upstairs, without having to buy that really expensive adapter, is to plug the cable into my 360, and then into my PC, when it is on (which is costing a lot of electric bill). In my PC, I have a usb wireless card thing, so I bridge the connections, and I get an xbox live connection.      However, I don't want to keep turning on my PC every time. I have a 2nd wireless router that I got free from somewhere. Is it possible to plug in my 2nd wireless router so I can just plug my 360 into the new router, but if you get what I'm saying, still have 1 connection to the house.      If possible, please either write me a step by step guide, or link me to one. Thanks!

20090223121018AAubGye	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Is it the battery or the charger?	My Laptop battery will not charge over 44%, it has been plugged in for hours and it's still at 44. Also, when I put the mouse cruiser over the battery icon on the computer is displays "44% (Plugged In, Not Charging)." I have removed the battery and just plugged in the charger and it turned on, so I'm guessing the charger is fine. Should I just replace the battery?

20090223103833AAeqnFf	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	PC fan started making loud noise, now I cant boot up comp?	Could be overheating, or a virus?  My wife had the comp on overnight watching movies.  while the comp was on idle the next morning this loud weird sound was coming from the computer.  We immediately shut it down and figured it got too hot b/c it was on all night.  Later that night we decide afew hours would be enough for it to cool down so when we turned it on the noise immediately appeared, and the pc shut itself down.  we tried again then this screen came up telling us the comp is trying to fix itself b/c there was a problem.  this is why we thought it could also be a virus.  after it was fixing itself it started in safe mode.  then it shut down again.  now when we boot it back up we get the black screen with the options to start in safe mode, safe mode with networking, or normally.  when we do normally, it barely makes it pass the login screen before it shutdowns.  In safe mode networking we a get afew minutes then it shutsdown.        I notice that there is dust build up in the pc.  when I open the cd drive i can see it, and in the back.  We have had this comp since april '08, and regrettably we haven't cleaned the inside with compressed air.  Will that kind of build up cause the problem I am experiencing?  I will get some air today to spray it out hoping that is all I need.      Also my wife opened it up and saw the fan was dangling inside the pc.  We aren't sure if it is supposed to be that way or if it is supposed to be glued to the inside wall.  She thinks she saw an area where it might have been glued on, but we are not for certain.  So does the fan have to be glued on or are they supposed to hang/dangle freely?  Also tthe wires that connect the fan were looped, is that normal?  It looks like if pulled it would make a knot, I couldn't figure out how that could happen accidently.

20090223121900AAbIy8o	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	I have some RAM questions?	I added a Gb to an old pc and it was easy enough so I had another pc I got free and it has a better OS so I figured it was worth improving so I opened it and it seemed to have 3 memory sticks but one was a bit shorter height wise.  I took that and another one out just to see if they had any info on them.  I put them back and the computer would not even boot up.     I bought another 1Gb stick but without knowing, it holds a little bit different style.  It has a small groove a quarter of the way down.  I will try and buy the correct one for it but my concern now is.   I was going to put the one I bought in my computer which would be an improvement.  However I'm not sure if I messed something up on the second one by removing the RAM even though I put it back so I'm worried that the original one in my computer might cause problems if I replace it   The strange thing about it I remembered reading was that it was a strange number and I saw that part of it was possibly being used for something else.  It's old so for example say it was 256MB.  It was showing 244MB.  I guess I'm not sure if the computer is dependent on that for some reason.  It now has a whopping 1.24GB since I added some but it only has two slots and since I have this other one.  Is it safe to just go and replace the 256mb one.   I hope that wasn't too confusing.   thanks   my overall question is:  is there anyway a pc would be dependent on a specific memory stick and if it was even momentarily removed would cause problems?   My solution for now is buy more for the free computer and see if it boots up and then I'll know it's probably okay to go and throw more in my computer.

20090223112147AA0w440	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Issue with Wacom Bamboo fun?	I have been a tablet user for almost 6 years now, and had the very same issue with my Wacom Graphire2.  Sometimes when I unplug the tablet from the computer (which I do every so often for ease of mobility) and plug it back in, it becomes confused as to whether I'm using the mouse or pen.  For example, normally with the pen, your screen is in proportion with the work area on the tablet. (Ex, top left corner of the work area is the top left corner of the screen, etc) and with the mouse you have pretty much free reign.  However, when I plug the tablet back in (and keep in mind that this is only occasionally), the mouse uses that proportional setting and the pen has free reign.  It's a real pain, since the only way to correct it is to either restart or log out, and I was wondering if there was a less troublesome solution to my problem.  Has this happened to anyone else?  (I'm almost positive that it has, since I've used two different tablets with two different computers and it's happened on both)

20090223121721AA0wc5k	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Question about web design?	Hi,  I've got a website that I use to advertise piano lessons on and this website has a pricing page.  Currently all prices are set out in a grid which is really complicated looking for customers to look at due to how many variations there are in pricing.  I was wondering if there's any way to change it to that the customer enters the variables and is given a price.        For example:      One student in a household having lessons every week costs less than one student in a household having lessons every two weeks.  The more frequent (and more students in a household) the cheaper lessons are.  Rather than the customer having to navigate through a grid, can they choose how many students there are in household, choose how frequently they want lessons and be given two prices - one for a lesson at my house and one for a lesson at theirs.  I'd like it if the customer could choose from a drop down list.  Is this possible?

20090223122500AAywcIz	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Why do negative values (on X-axis) disappear when I interchange X and Y axes in Excel 07 scatter plot?	I have a data set with two columns containing numerous data points. Column A has revenues (all positive). Column B has growth %ages (both negative and positive). When I plot a scatter diagram in Excel 07, column A becomes the default X-axis while column B becomes the Y-axis. I want to flip both and for that, I went to the 'Data source' and manually changed the ranges for each axes. As I do that, all the negative values from my column B (which should be on x-axis) somehow vanish. Also, the 'type' of value on x-axis automatically becomes a custom value ($ in this case, when it should be %). I checked all the options, and it does not make any sense. Its not on log scale and I tried changing the min and max values on the x-axis scale, but no help! Please assist. I need to design a code based on this working well. Thanks a lot for your help and if you need any more detail, please post.

The only thing that came across my screen were the words, "No input signal". I've tried everything to fix my Compaq SR2034NX desktop but no luck. I've gotten to the point of taking my hardrive out and moving it into a new computer however this would be costly for my family and so I'm hoping that someone can help me with my problem and give me tips on how to fix this and how to prevent it from happening again.

That didn't seem like much so I intended to invite them all. When I got to about 150 a warning window popped-up and I checked the link, but it wasn't very informative.      Since I only had about 20 to go I wanted to finish them off because if I stopped and started over later I'd probably do a lot of duplicate inviting and I didn't want to spam anyone.

20090223123323AAvbXzS	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Vista 32 bit Crashing!?	The long description of my issue.       First my computer specs:   OS: Vista home premium 32 bit   Processor: AMD 4800+ X2 2.5 GHz   Memory: 3GB. PC 5300    Mother board is a Acer OEM Nvidia Nforce 450 WMB 6100 Chipset    Power supply: 650 Watt True Power SLI 3 12V rails 15.0A   Graphics Card: BFG Tech Nvidia 9800 GTX+ OC DDR3 512   Hard Drive: 1 Serial ATA 500GB Segate    My issue:   Ok I have had this set up [WORKING] for about 4 months now. I have quite a few games on my system as I use it primarily for Gaming.  This issue started a week and a half ago from today. What happens is I’ll be playing one of my games and the screen will go black!. The 22” LCD monitor will read “LOST SIGNAL”.  At that very moment graphics card fan will start to rev up. Over and over all the while the screen is black. There is no way to get the screen back but Power cycle the computer. So I restart the computer, the screen remains black and the graphics card just sits there and reves like a car. What happens in the OS drops the drivers for the graphics card and reloads the onboard graphics drivers. Making it only possible to get video via the onboard graphics VGA adapter. Once I restart the computer again and connect the VGA adapter I can get video but I loose my Ethernet adapter. IT completely goes dead and will not even show up in the hardware device manager. So I have video but no internet. Then what I do is download the most updated drivers from Nvidia on my laptop and place them on a pin drive, so I can install them on to my main computer. When I do this I can then restart the computer and plug my monitor back in to the 9800 card. I also get my Ethernet card back. How ever it isn’t more then 1 min before the computer crashes again[ even with it just idling] and the same thing happens.       What I have done to try and fix this:   I have done everything from using older/newest drivers for the card – reloading a hole new, clean OS on a brand new HD. When I reloaded the os on a new HD. I loaded all the drivers needed to run just the OS and the system, and one game. I was able to play the game for a full 2 hours. Then the crash happened again.  Understand this is with a brand new OS and new HD. I have rand out of ideas. I’ve tried Microsoft udpates, I’ve tried memory testing to see if its my memory sticks. I’ve tried increasing my DDR and decreasing it.  I’ve tried loading the drivers from the original driver CD. I’ve tried installing a different graphics card. Nothing seems to stop the crashing.    I have ruled out the following:   1. Its not the hard drive, because I have a brand new one that works.   2. Its not the graphics card because it works fine on a different system. Plus I installed a different graphics card on the faulty system and the crash still happened.    3. its not the games because, the crash can happen with me not even using the computer just letting it sit at desktop.    4. I know its not the DDR because I swapped it out, testing each stick in different slots and they all seem to work just fine.    5. I know its not the motherboard because. Its boots fine with no errors. As long as it has the graphics card drivers loaded Everything works,, until something unknown causes it to crash.  Also the system works fine with out a PCI E based graphics card on it [ except the Ethernet adapter]. That is the wild card, the onboard Ethernet adapter does not work at all in anyway  with out a PCI E  graphics card in the system and the drivers working.    Please help me

20090223131723AAaAtKi	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Can't overclock my computer!! Help!?	I am trying to overclock my CPU but it always fails and resets the defaults. I have a Pentium D Dual Core 805 Processor which is a budget CPU that can attain 4.1GHZ and run fine. From the factory its a 2.66 on each core, so I want to up that, doesn't have to be maxed out, but I want something like 3.2ghz on each core. Here's a link to Tom's Hardware where they overclocked this exact processor and had it running at 4.1GHZ with no problems.        http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/dual...       Here are my specs on my computer:   -Windows Vista Ultimate    Fully updated    Currently running 32 bit   -500GB Seagate SATAII 3.0gb/s hard drive   -ATI Radeon X1900GT Graphics Card   -ASUS P5K-VM Motherboard   -2x2GB (4GB Total) DDR2-6400 at factory clock   -500W Power Supply   -Thermaltake 4.7" CPU Cooling fan with copper heatsink and copper heat pipes      I have tried overclocking but cannot find the right combination for the FSB, memory clocks, and memory speed.      I tried changing voltage on the CPU, changing memory clocks, and also changing memory speeds. For the memory speeds my only options are 664 or 800, and the lowest amount for the FSB is 200-800mhz. Any ideas on what I can do to overclock some and get a little more out of my CPU? Thanks.

Sometimes, when I'm using my computer (Compaq Presario SR2020NX, OS is Windows XP), a random noise assaults my ears. There are two I have noticed, one being the sound of an explosion, and the other bits of the song which goes like: "Crawling in my skin, these wounds, they will not heal." I don't know whether this is caused by a virus, or something else. What is this, and what can I do to fix it?

My dad has important stuff on his computer and we are all connected to a network, so I don't something bad to happen to everyone just because i wasn't careful downloading.      5) anything else you may want to tell me.      You don't have to answer everything obviously, but please tell me what you know if you can.      Thank you very much, in advance.

20090223130843AAsHQ78	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Problem with conflict of AM2+ motherboard, AM2 CPU, and 800 mhz DDR2 RAM?	A few months ago, I had a Gigabyte motherboard (AM2) that ran fine with DDR2 800 mhz RAM up until it had a socket error and started hissing.      My store seems to not have had the same one in stock, and gave me a similar motherboard, a 750a SLI nforce made by XFX ( http://www.xfxforce.com/en-gb/products/m...  It is an AM2+ motherboard. My CPU is an AMD Athlon X2 (AM2) 6400+ processor, and my RAM is 4 GB of Transcend DDR2 800 mhz ( http://www.webhallen.com/prod.php?id=827...       I hit my first snag putting it together yesterday. My PSU had 4 pin ATX 12v connection, and the motherboard needed 8. I fixed this by buying an adapter today. After putting it together, the computer turns on but gets nothing on the monitor. The monitor is not broken. I attempted with both the onboard graphics and a secondary card via PCI express.      The user manual of the motherboard is bad. It's about 3 pages, it's just an installation guide. However on the front of the box and on the website, it says that that i'm supposed to use DDR2 1066 mhz RAM. However, I thought all AM2+ motherboard were capable of using 800 mhz, although the clock speed would drop. The RAM not working is consistent with the display not working. Will replacing it allow the computer to start up?      Any other suggestions? Won't the speed of the 1066 RAM drop anyway to 800 mhz with an AM2 CPU?      thanks.

20090223135420AAzjA3z	Computers & Internet;Security	Sort of done to death security suite question, but a bit different...?	Hi,       I'm an IT professional who has a strong preference for using a variety of security applications; picking the strongest for each area (anti-virus, firewall, anti-malware, etc) BUT I have a particular customer who has asked me to set up their brand new Vista Business laptop with a single, subscription security suite that they can pretty much "set and forget" (as opposed to several different programs requiring individual configuration/tweaking.)       What, in your opinion, is the best "All-In-One" solution that requires the least user input (once it has been set-up) and yet doesn't sacrifice the level of security offered as a result of its simplicity?       The customer's main concern, it seems, is to have a firewall that doesn't prompt for decisions too often (and I'd certainly prefer not to install a Norton or McAfee product.)      Thanks in advance,   AlexD

20090223141943AALVGQ4	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Vostro 1510 vs. Latitude E5500 Laptop?	Ok, I went on the Dell website, and I can essentially build a Vostro 1510 for the same price as a Latitude e5500 except the Vostro has 100 more gigs of hard drive space, a webcam, and a fingerprint reader. On the other hand, the Vostro only has a Intel? Integrated Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 while the Latitude has a Mobile Intel? Graphics Media Accelerator 4500MHD.   However, I don't plan on doing too much heavy gaming on the laptop anyways.      One thing I REALLY need is durability. The Vostro 1500 was my last laptop. INCREDIBLY sturdy, like a rock, but I managed to break it by being a terrible owner, and the hard drive is dead now 0_o      So I've read that the Vostro 1510 has a worse build than the 1500...how good is the Latitude E5500's build? If its the sturdiest machine on the planet, I might still opt for it (I think it looks nicer too), but if not I can get much more in the Vostro for the same price.      What do you think?   Consider the needs of the average college student btw (that's me).

Maybe one that updates like AVG. I guess what i'm saying is, where can i find the free version of Avast that has antivirus, and does it also have spyware/adware blockers or just the Antivirus. I use to have it, but i need to do something to my computer so now i've lost it. If it doesn't have spyware/adware blocker then don't bother telling me where to find it, just name some others that do. By the way, i use Vista.

It was a cruddy computer when we got it but now it pops up messages saying that "your computer is at risk of crashing." Plus there is an Anti-Virus pop-up that won't get off the screen that is compromising our internet usage, we have tried downloading an opposing Anti-Virus to rid of he pop-up, but the pop-up won't allow us to download it. The Anti-Virus pop-up is preventing us from doing normal things on our computer, i.e. send emails, open certain pages, and attach documents to things.      Is there anything we can do to prevent the computer from crashing? And how do we remove the Anti-Virus pop-up?

20090223141914AAZ2T8r	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Recognizing hard drive in DOS?	It's been too long ago for me to remember this DOS stuff!!!      OK, here is the deal. I have an older computer (six or seven years old) that I run DOS on and ordinarily just the floppy drives are fine for what I use it for.      It also has both Windows ME and Windows XP installed, but I bypass those by booting from a floppy straight to DOS 6.2.      But, when I do that, the computer doesn't recognize that there is a hard drive installed and gives me an "Invalid Drive Specification" if I try to go to the C: drive.      How do I get it to recognize that the hard disk is there in DOS? Do I have to set that up in either the autoexec.bat file or config.sys file? (neither of which is on the floppy I boot from, I might add).

20090223133334AAnkgR4	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Question about a sour Dual-booting scenario?	Here is my situation:      1. I had a working XP Primary Partition and Windows 7 Secondary Partition.   2. I wanted to increase the size of secondary partition, so I used GParted Live CD.   3. That caused my computer to lose the Windows 7 boot configuration, so I had to use Windows 7 CD to repair installation. After this, only Windows 7 Partition worked (that was fine, in the short-term).   4. However, as a longer term solution, I wanted to reinstall XP clean, so I formatted primary partition and then booted from XP CD (not within Windows 7).   5. After reinstalling XP, I now can only boot into XP, with no choice of operating system given.      Any suggestions?

Hi, I've been looking for a new computer for a game I got about a year ago (and after I found out it didn't work on our laptop, lol) called Medieval 2: Total War. The only computer we have is from 1999 with dial-up, but we have a laptop (Dell Inspiron 6000) which I use for Rome: TW. I soon got tired of the extremely laggish battles on med-settings and tried Medieval 2... still don't know what I was thinking, lol.    Since then I've been trying to find a good computer and after hours of searching, I found out it's near to impossible going from 1999 to modern day processors, video cards and what-not. So, I was wondering if any of you guys know a computer which will play Medieval 2, med to high settings (without lag) from 0-1000 bucks (maybe a little over). I don't have a credit card, or knowledge of how to put together a desktop so I'm kinda stuck, lol.   Thank you in advance for the responses.

20090223135552AA0RjOt	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	How do you open a port to the internet for a computer on a LAN?	My problem is this: I have a home server with the Windows Server 2003 R2 OS with 2 network cards. My internet connection goes in one of the network cards and the internet is shared to a LAN through the other card. (more: I'm using PPPoE protocol for the internet connection and the cable from the network card that is used for the LAN goes into a switch, and from there it goes to 2 separate notebooks).   I have torrent installed on a notebook and using the TCP port 20000 and I want to be able to open the port towards the internet so I can be "connectable". I tried using some windows firewall trick I've seen but that was with no luck. I also tried the Network Security panel but the result was the same:    "Error: I could not see your service on 79.xxx.xxx.xxx on port (20000)   Reason: Connection refused" (tested on  http://www.canyouseeme.org/).    So, is there really any way I could open a port for one client on the LAN considering all of the information above? Thank you all in advance

20090223143102AAVCZ4x	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	How do i restore my Dell C600 Latitude Professional hard drive to factory settings?	I have an old Dell C600 that i would like to get operating. My dad got it from a friend whom he worked with at his old company. When the company ordered new laptops, she let my dad have it. Now about six years later, i would like a laptop for my school work. The computer itself boots up fine, and gets to the CTRL+ALT+DELETE screen. I press it, and it brings me into a Windows Professional log-in  panel. My dad does not know the password for the computer, and we contacted the older owner, and she didn't know either. The company also wouldn't know what the Admin password could be, so i am stuck there. The hard drive is 60gb, which is more than enough for me, and i would like to know if there is anything i could do to restore the hard drive to factory settings without logging in at all. I do not think any control panel works, because it will require you to log in, i believe. I'm contemplating buying a new hard drive completely, but i would hate to waste my money when i could have restored it. So does anyone know if a can?

20090223123856AAZnyeQ	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	How To Increase Computer/Internet Speed?	Hey,      Over the past few weeks, I've noticed that it has taken pages longer and longer to open on the internet. I live in a dorm, and we all have the same exact internet connection and speed, so the internet itself is not a problem, but I notice that the internet is faster on my friends' laptops than it is on mine.      I have a Macbook, would you recommend any free programs I could use to figure out/solve why my internet is so slow compared to everyone else's? 5 people in my dorm have the exact same laptop as me and their pages load twice as fast on the same connection.      Thanks in advance
