20090304124705AA9NzkN	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	MATH QUESTION? NEED ANSWER?	There is this one math problem I need to solve, but I'm not sure how to do it:      MATH QUESTION: For all positive integers n, the expression n! denotes the product of the first n positive integers. When 5! is expressed as an integer, what is the ones digit?         I'm not fully positive, but I'm guessing this is how I should solve it:                                      MY GUESS: 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1= 120, since they're asking for the ones digit, so the final answer should be 0?         I'm just guessing, but I think the answer is 0, am I doing this right? If it's correct, just tell me. If not, please tell me the correct way and answer. Thanks a lot! I'll be sure to give the correct answerer ten points!
20090304124233AA4ghaX	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Mathematical Question, Please Help!!!?	An apprentice carpenter has designed a wood coffee table. He expects to sell 25 tables for $95 each at an upcoming artisan market. By conducting a survey, he determines that for each $2 reduction in the price of the table, he will likely gain three sales.      a) An expression that describes the price of each table, based on the number of reductions is 95 - 2x, where x represents the number of $2 reductions in price. Write a similar expression to describe the number of tables the carpenter can expect to see, based on the number of reductions.      b) Write an equation to describe the carpenter's income as a product of the price of each table and the expected number of tables sold.      Please Show Steps!!!   Thank You!!!

If time travel ever becomes possible in the future of humankind, surely time travelers would return to our timezone?

Thanks in advance.

I have this butter-flavored spray that I like to spritz on popcorn, and I always seem to accidentally leave it out on the counter.  I've done this maybe three times, and each time the spray sat out for maybe five hours.  The label says "refrigeration recommended," but does not say that you MUST "refrigerate after opening" like other products do.      Why is refrigeration only "recommended?"  Should I throw it away since it's been left out?  What are consequences of not refrigerating a product that the manufacturer recommends, but does not require, be refrigerated?

20090303221959AAtpJzi	Science & Mathematics;Zoology	Found really small bugs all over room, what are they?	I come home to find approximately 50 of these little oval shaped bugs in my bedroom today. They were so small that it's hard to describe them. I have no idea what they are so maybe you can help me.      First off, most of them appeared to be dead. I only found 2 or 3 actually crawling around. However, the "dead" ones did not have any visible legs so maybe they were hatching or something? The live ones had maybe 4-6 legs (honestly not sure) and moved rather slowly. The live ones also appeared to possibly have clear wings developing, but none were flying at all.      They looked a little black in color, but the live on I examined seemed a little brown/white. The bottom part of the bugs almost seemed rollie pollie (sp?) like, but again they were so small it's hard to tell. They were all found around the edges of the wall except for a small portion of them.      I do not think they are bed bugs because I examined my bed frame, mattress, etc. closely and didn't see any. Also, I don't have any bites.      Another thing I should note, I just came back from the mountains and this could possibly the reason. My suitcase was in my room, unpacked. Upon examination of that I saw none whatsoever.       I'm wondering if anyone has any idea what kind of bugs these are and how I can go about getting rid of them.

20090304140233AAs5dOL	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Pre-calculus homework help, anyone?	I could really use some help with some random pre-calculus problems. Do what you can, every little bit helps a lot. Show/explain work if possible; some problems I'm looking for a confirmation on the answer I got and some I'm utterly lost. Use words for symbols that can't be found on the keyboard (i.e. root, pi, degree, ect.) Thanks in advance!      1.) Convert 165 degrees into radians =11pi/12?      2.) If a 30" tire is rotating at 1056 rmp, what is the corresponding speed of the vehicle in mph?      3.) A 160 degree arc has a length of 18 in., what is the radius of the sector in terms of pi?   (Try your best to explain this to me if possible, I know it's tricky to do without sketching it, but even just listing the steps you took would be so helpful.)      4.) Given an angle in standard position with a terminal ray passing through the points (-2, -6) find the SIN and COS of the angle.   (Do you plot this point, sketch the ray and turn it into a triangle and solve that way?)      5.) Convert 75 degrees into radians =5pi/12?      6.) Write an equation in terms of SIN that determines the height of a person on a ferris wheel (described below) where x=0 is the highest point of the ride. What is the person's height at x=20?   Diameter= 54 ft   Lowest height=4 ft   Rotating at 1.5 rpm's      7.) TAN of -60 degrees = negative root of 3?      8.) Find COS(COT inverse(q))   (COT is co-tangent, which is the reciprical of TAN. The "q" is either a 9 or a "q"...my teacher's writing is messy.)      9.) Solve for x, where 0 < or equal to x < 2pi:   A. COT x=0   B. -3 SEC squared x+4=0   C. 3 TAN squared x=1   D. 5 SEC x-3= -2      10.) A surveyorer sights the top of a tree at 45 degrees, then walks 60 ft closer to the tree and sights the top of the tree at 50 degrees. What is the height of the tree and the surveyor's initial distance to the tree?      11.) Convert 3:48 PM into decimal form =15.80?      12.) Convert 9:12 AM into decimal form =9.20?      13.) Given CSC x=-4/3 for pi/2< or equal to x < or equal to 3pi/2, find COS x and COT x.   (CSC IS co-secant, the reciprical of SIN. I know with this problem, you would be looking at a graph, and pi/2=90 degrees and 3pi/2=270 degrees so it's dealing with quadrants 2 and 3.)         Sorry it's written so poorly. Any help at all is greatly appreciated!

20090304134426AAn05b2	Science & Mathematics;Alternative;Parapsychology	Why are people skeptical and abusive towards ESP abilities?	Hi I really don't get this. Actually what's happening now has happened hundreds of years ago when they use to burn 'magic' performing witches alive infront of a whole group of people in the name of 'being evil'.      Other species out there can do amazing things compared to us humans, dolphins can transmit sound waves to warn off or communicate to their other kind. Bats can detect high level frequencies. So what if People just end up having ESP abilities what if this is the next step towards our evolution?      Then I get all these people in the majority of the public criticising aggressively against psychics etc. Yeah there are alot of frauds out there, so are murderers, thieves, rapists and terrorists. But you don't go around saying all rapists are men and all terrorists come from the Middle East. One failure in one of these 'james randi' psychic debunk is enough to not just humiliate the person but also meaning to prove ESP does not exist.      Are you people the majority of you just plain 'jealousy' with the fact that you don't have ESP or you're either 'strongly religious'?      This is all not new to me anyhow. I've seen in history, someone claims to be 'special' and they get shot. Think of Jesus in the Bible for example, he healed the sick and brought the dead back to life or something and everyone the majority hated him. Where is all this 'HATE' coming from?       Even if a so called 'psychic' took up James Randi's challenge and won the million. 70% of the public would still either refuse to believe it exists (including james himself) or that you would make into some kind of religious fanatic explanation.      How would you out there accept ESP ability given the circumstances that a psychic does win the Million?? That is the Question.

One of the most famous geometers in history was also a highly regarded scientist  and inventor.  He discovered an important principle that states that an object placed in a fluid experiences not only its weight pulling it downward but also an additional upward farce equal to the weight of the fluid the object displaces.  He also defined the principle of the lever and invented the compound pulley and the hydraulic screw.  His GREATEST geometric achievements were in the field of solid geometry, where some of his discoveries anticipated the fundamental idea in integral calculus.  He proved that the volume of a sphere is two-thirds the volume of the cylinder circumscribing the sphere.      Give me the first and last name.

20090304135929AAXGB7c	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Does anyone know the Luminosity of Alpha Centuri A by using the Inverse Square Law?	Alpha Centauri A lies at a distance of 4.4 light-years and has an apparent brightness in our night sky of 2.7 x 10^-8 watts/m^2. Recall that 1 light-year = 9.5 x 10^12 km= 9.5 x 10^15 m.      PART A: Use the inverse square law for light to calculate the luminosity of Alpha Centauri A.      PART B: Suppose you have a light bulb that emits 75 watts of visible light. (Note: This is not the case for a standard 75-watt light bulb, in which most of the 75 watts goes to heat and only about 7-11 watts is emitted as visible light.) How far away would you have to put the light bulb for it to have the same apparent brightness as Alpha Centauri A in our sky? (Hint: Use 75 watts as L in the inverse square law for light, and use the apparent brightness given above for Alpha Centauri A. Then solve for the distance.)

20090304145644AADbIge	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Sugar is nonpolar or polar?	Ok heres my explanation:      A polar substance is something that can dissolve in water right??   If so, sugar dissolves in water (im pretty sure), so that means it's polar right?? or is it not? isn't sugar a lot like salt in some ways??   and salt is a polar substance. and ice is a polar substance, im really sure on that. and so salt can make it melt faster, and its a polar substance. Does that mean that if you have a polar subtance such as ice and another polar substance such as salt, it would make the ice melt faster?? So if sugar is a polar substance, then it would make it melt faster just like salt right?? and if its a nonpolar substance then if wouldn't do anything to the ice?? the ice would melt like it would if nothing was on it?? Or would the sugar help it last longer?? but i doubt that... hmph... this is complicated.      sorry if this sounds confusing...

We started a new way to find where 2 lines intersect. We have two problems with an x and y in them and are supposed to cancel out an x or y by multiplying them with negative one or by finding the common number thingy.    I need help on these problems      6. -5x+3y=-16 and -10x+y=-22   7. 3x+7y=16 and 4x-3y=9      If anyone can find where these numbers intersect I will appreciate it and give you best answer. I keep getting a bunch of fractions and I don't think that is correct.
