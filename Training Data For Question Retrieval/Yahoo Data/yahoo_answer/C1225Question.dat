20090203071933AAEf8tW	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	What are the chances for a D.O. (doctor of osteopathic medicine) to find work overseas?	I am a pre-med student wanting to go to a DO school because I like their philosophy better. I am originally from Europe, and planning on going back (or to some other continent for a while?!) after a few years of experience working in the US once I become a doctor... but I'm getting a bit discouraged by what I'm hearing about other countries not accepting American DO accreditations as readily as they accept MD accreditations. Is that really true? Would I have to "prove" myself by taking extra licensing exams or is an American DO just as good of a doctor to the foreigners as an MD?

20090203073430AARMzR3	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Applied Stats help please...about age?	I need help with one of my questions for my stats homework, the question is only worth 1 point, but those points can add up. Anyways, the question is about a lady who has collected data for a study. Within the data she collected, she collected each participant's height, age, and IQ test scores. The question is: Is the "age" variable a type of nominal or ratio statistic? Is "age" neither nominal nor ratio? Defend your position.       I have looked all through my notes and in my text book and I think I am only confusing myself more. I keep reading that age is a quantitative variable...so I didn't know if that should be my answer. But then ratio statistic could also be the answer from what I understand. So if you could just help me out, I would appreciate it. Also, I am not asking you to defend your answer like the question asks...I am just confused between my two answers.       Please don't reply with any of that "Do your own homework" stuff...I'm a senior in college and starting grad school next semester so I think I am doing pretty well by myself thank you...it just so happens that math is my weakness.      And to those who actually help...Thanks in advance!!!!

I know that the sun will become large enough, as a red giant, to engulf Mercury and Venus.  I think that most estimates are that the Earth will also be engulfed in red-giant plasma.  However, what about Mars?  Will it survive, or is it also on the "doomed" list?  If Mars is safe, then we obviously need a colony there, eventually!      Btw, the time for a Lunar Colony is now, due to the always-possible chance of asteroid or comet strike, such as the one that killed the dinosaurs.  With enough lunar colonists, the earth could be repopulated, after the dust cleared!

20090220160516AAW1e62	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	How to do Filling the Aquarium POW?	I need help with this math problem for my algebra class.      POW 5: Filling the aquarium      In a nearby animal park there is a large aquarium that holds many types of rare and exotic fish. The maintenance department has the responsibility of periodically removing the fish, draining the water, and giving the the tank a thorough cleaning. Once it has been cleaned, it is filled again and the fish are returned for the public to view and enjoy. This week it is Wilbur's turn in the job assignment rotation to do the work. He opens the drain to remove the water, noting that his watch says 9:55 AM. As the last drop runs out, he looks at his watch again: it says 10:11 AM. Now Wilbur sets to work cleaning and scrubbing the inside of the tank, not even noticing that he is working right through his lunch break. As he finishes his work, he realizes that he is quite hungry. In his haste to eat, he turns on the two pipes used to fill the tank, but forgets to put the plug in the drain spout. He leaves at 12:40 PM.      Here you need to know two facts. One pipe can fill the whole tank by itself in 20 minutes, while the other requires 30 minutes to do the same task.      When Wilbur finishes his lunch, he returns to see how full the tank is now. It is nearly full, so he decides to wait until the water reaches its proper height in the tank. At the moment it does, he turns off the two pipes and notes the time on his watch. What is that time?      --Please help me figure out the answer to this math problem and/or explain to me how it is done. Thanks!

What I am unclear about is working out a percentage of something, without being given the percentage.      I.e.      If there is a group of 1127 people and 112 are students, what percentage of the total people are students?      What's the quickest, easiest and most memorable formular?

20090220172830AA4hAM1	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	(no joke) What would happen if there was a corpse in space?	I know its a funny question, or sick depending on who you are. This just popped in my mind during conversation however.       Basically if you had JUST died, and you were literally put into space a few seconds after death, what would happen to the corpse.      By this I mean really decay. There is no oxygen in space, but I know your stomach would still have acid in it.       I am guessing this will be fairly simple to answer, I just don't know that answer.

20090220173917AAMM3Ru	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Question on quantum mechanics.?	Does quantization of energy states of a particle (for instance, its kinetic energy) imply that there are also discrete sets of speeds for that particle? That is, when a particle... or even a whole body of particles... accelerates, its change in velocity is not continuous, but rather changing from quantized sets of speeds?  Quantum mechanics blows my mind.

20090220164218AATOLTN	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	How gullible are we people?	Do you believe this as true?   Dihydrogen Monoxide (DHMO) is a colorless and odorless chemical compound, also referred to by some as Dihydrogen Oxide, Hydrogen Hydroxide, Hydronium Hydroxide, or simply Hydric acid. Its basis is the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, a species shown to mutate DNA, denature proteins, disrupt cell membranes, and chemically alter critical neurotransmitters. The atomic components of DHMO are found in a number of caustic, explosive and poisonous compounds such as Sulfuric Acid, Nitroglycerine and Ethyl Alcohol.       Dihydrogen monoxide:      is called "hydroxyl acid", the substance is the major component of acid rain.    contributes to the "greenhouse effect".    may cause severe burns.    contributes to the erosion of our natural landscape.    accelerates corrosion and rusting of many metals.    may cause electrical failures and decreased effectiveness of automobile brakes.    has been found in excised tumors of terminal cancer patients.    Despite the danger, dihydrogen monoxide is often used:    as an industrial solvent and coolant.    in nuclear power plants.    in the production of styrofoam.    as a fire retardant.    in many forms of cruel animal research.    in the distribution of pesticides. Even after washing, produce remains contaminated by this chemical.    as an additive in certain "junk-foods" and other food products.          please, if you know the truth about DHMO, do not say so

They said I should be happy I am pregnant and everything seems good, the babys heart was also beating away like a good one, it really was an amazing experience.

20090220124609AAxO4lg	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Calculus questions - Optimization?	1. A section of roller coaster is in the shape of y=(x^5) - (4x^3) - 9x +25, where x is between -2 and 2.   a) Find all extrema (max and min) both absolute and relative   b) Find the location of the steepest part of the roller coaster      2. Between 0 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees Celsius, the volume V (in cubic centimetres) of 1kg of water at a temperature T is given approximately by the formula:   V(T) = 999.87 - 0.06426T + (0.0085043T^2) - (0.0000679T^3)   Use calculus to find the temperature (approx. value) at which the water has its maximum density.   (maximum density would be minimum volume)      3. Suppose that T(t) is a sick person's temperature at time t. Which would be better news at time t, T"(0) = 2 or T"(0) = -2 or would you need to know the value of T'(0) and T(0) to determine which is better? Explain.      4. Suppose that body temperature 1 hour after receiving x mg of a drug is given by T(x) - 102-((1/6)x^2)(1-(x/9)) for xE[0,6]. The absolute value of the derivative is defined as the sensitvity of the body to the drug dosage. Find the dosage which maximizes sensitivity.

The five members of the Felina family (Mama, Papa, Cesar, Melody, and Daniel) and their five cats (each family member owned a cat) were strolling through a forest when they encountered a river to cross.  They rented a boat that could hold three living things – people or cats.  Unfortunately, the cats were very temperamental:  Each was comfortable only with its owner and could not be near another person, not even momentarily, unless its owner was present.  Cats could be with other cats, however.  The crossing would have been impossible except that Melody’s cat had attended a first-rate obedience school and knew how to operate the boat.  No other cats were that well-educated.  How was the crossing arranged and how many trips did it take?  Explain.      This is a problem for math. umm..I think I have the solution but I'm not sure if it is correct. Please help. All answers are aperciated. Thanks.
