Few months ago i saw a techonology which is based on nanotechnology for replacement of baldness using nanotechnogy.   This one, i saw it in Discovery Channel's BEYOND TOMORROW program.       Can anyone tell me which is the company that offers such dupe hairs that can stick with the human skin and that looks like real hair without any difference.      The dupe hair just looks like a TOPA and when it comes in contact with the skin, it gets stuck without any adhesive. And to remove the stuff, we've to pour some other substance over it and automatically it gets peeled off.      The peeled off stuff is reusable...       Also please answer me with other dupe hair stuffs witgout adhesives which avoid sweating.

I've been using this new kind of acne face wash and it said to use it less if your face begins to peel and flake off dead skin. Since my face started doing that I completely stopped using it in hopes my face would get better, and stop flaking. I want to speed up the process with a good moisturizer, so the whole reason I'm here is to ask all you people, What's the best kind of moisturizer for my dry and flaking face? I'd appreciate ANY help or suggestions. Thank you all!

20090227142407AAlt4nu	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Does anyone know how to treat ingrown hairs on bikini lines?	Hey, I have a problem which has been troubling me for six years. I have ingrown hairs, red bumps and scars on my bikini line. I am so embarassed by them. I went to the doctors years ago to treat them, but he laughed at me, so I'm afraid of going back in case that happens again.    I have tried eveything: exfoliating, puttingcream on the area, bio-oil to reduce the scars, but nothing works. I bought an ingrown hair solution from boots but that hasn't worked. Does anyone have any tips? It's really getting me down. I haven't been intimate with a guy for over a year because of it, and my family are planning a holiday this summer, so I want to look my best in a bikini.

I'm finally going to finish my back tattoo(attempt at least)    Getting the tattoo doesn't bother me. But last time the itching was so intense I couldn't sleep or even think about anything else for about 3 days. I tried lotions, ointment, cold water, benadryl...to no avail.    Does anybody have experience using h2ocean lotion or tattoo goo? These claim to help with the itch. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! . It seems the the filling in itches so intensely because it is over such a large area. I know I may have to just tough it out but hoping for something.  Thanks a ton!

20070715033342AAT9XCl	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Treatment and concealer for under eye dark circles and bags that REALLY WORK?	Conflicting information abounds:  "Use tea bags with caffeine"; "make sure tea bags DON'T have caffeine"; "use products with Vitamin K"; "Vitamin K won't have much effect, Vitamin E does the trick", and on and on it goes.      I'm 46 years old, and remember pictures from elementary school days where I had dark circles, so I guess that's mostly hereditary.  (Although my sleep habits are atrocious, so I know this doesn't help either)  The bags are a new addition over recent years.        I first became aware of those while standing in a Steinmart.  I caught a glimpse of myself in one of their mirrors and couldn't believe what I was seeing.  I've tried a number of products every since then, as well as various types of concealer....I'm not seeing any real improvement though.      I prefer skin care products and cosmetics that are all-natural, with no animal testing, but I realize it may take something more heavy-duty to get the results I'm after.  Thanks!

20070814075036AALVSDR	Beauty & Style;Hair	I bleached my hair and it's different colors?	I bleached my hair (do not tell me how risky it is please!!) and I left it in for a little bit longer than what it said. The front of my head is dark goldish color with dark brown (my natural color) behind it in layers, while on one side its gold with brown behind it. On the other side, its really light blonde (what I was aiming for) and that's the only place that color besides in the back, which only has a bit of blonde.      Is it ok to put more bleach over the gold so it will turn blonde? What should I do to make it an even color?      The light shade of blonde is the shade I am aiming for. You can also see my natural color and the gold it turned:    http://uploadz.co.uk/931picture1014.jpg       I'd really like to have the light blonde hair, my hair is not damaged and I do not mind if it does (as long as it doesnt fall out!)

I've been looking for a good short haircut for a long long looong time, and I finally came upon the one ;)  How would I describe this haircut to a stylist?  I'm definitely printing out a picture, but I want to be sure they know what I'm looking for.  Part II of this question is whether or not it'll be alright with thin hair?  I have very thin, sparse hair, that's also rather oily (probably because it's too thin to stand on its own...)  Will that be a concern? :\    http://www.teenvogue.com/images/style/ma...

20081028083408AA6BCM2	Beauty & Style;Hair	How can I get that sort of 'boho' 'hippy' style with my hair? (dets..)?	as in like the messy way. not just, add a headband or something.      Kinda like Diana from the x-factor.      You know the way you have it kind of poofed up a little bit. So it looks like you just woke up.         I have thick brown just past shoulder length hair with layers & side fringe.

I always figured that you would use these kinds of bags to shop with, but I go to a school with an open campus and I really want a cute bag that will hold all of my books for me instead of me holding them in my arms. I know this is kind of a stupid question, but is it okay to use a bag like this for a book bag?
20081006145319AAqYxde	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Can you tell me what you think about these pics of mine (sent from modelling agency)?	Finally my modelling agency sent me the pics of a photoshoot I did last week.   There are ten pics. Can you tell me what you think about each of them? Clothing, set, make up, face expression...   If you think I look awful in some pics, tell it to me. If you think I look slutty, tell it to me. No problem about critics. But please, let me know what you think about each photo.   Thank you.      1:  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3115/2919...    2:  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3212/2919...    3:  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3036/2919...    4:  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3027/2919...    5:  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3200/2919...    6:  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3169/2919...    7:  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3075/2919...    8:  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3220/2919...    9:  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3112/2919...    10:  http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3242/2919... 
20081115155642AAzqrF0	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	How can I get at least ONE lip piercing without my mom knowing?	I REALLY want snakebites. But obviously one stud would be easier to hide. My mom is absolutely against the idea of me getting it done. Although I have my belly pierced, I can't even get her to consider it. :( I REALLY want it done and idk how i could without her knowing. Anyone been in my situation before? Please helpppp.
