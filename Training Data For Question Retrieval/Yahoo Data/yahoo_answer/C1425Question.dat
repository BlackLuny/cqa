20090128210847AARC4WC	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What should we do? There was feces in the aisle at Walgreens and my sister stepped on it? GROSS!?	Ok, it was no where near the bathroom and there were chunks of poop! My sister stepped on it by mistake and quickly went to tell an employee. He was like "ok" and waited 15 minutes to clean it! Not only this, but it wasn't properly cleaned so much so that my sister took pictures. Her boots are ruined and we are just so disgusted. What should we do?
20090128211550AADvZVx	Social Science;Economics	Solving the economic crisis - would this work?	How about the govt giving a 25% rebate on any taxable goods sold in the USA. It could be up to $250 (per month) per citizen for the next two years. And if the product was actually made in America, ex car, etc. the entire rebate $6,000 could be used in one shot. Jobs for people who work here in the good ol' USA. For every dollar the govt layed out, it'd  multiply out 4x in the economy. And as it only applied to goods which were taxed by the states, the state economies would benefit as well. The nice thing about this plan too, if it flopped and nobody took advantage of it, it wouldn't place our govt in any debt. And if it did work out, the multiplier appears to be enormous. Everybody could just attach receipts to their income tax forms. Just a thought. Any economists out there who think such a thing might work?    On another note, I don't know if more tax breaks would actually stimulate the economy. Ex, if you gave the pizza shop owner a tax cut, that doesn't mean that suddenly he'll sell more pizzas. His bottom line might be better (granted) but it won't get more people through his door. And isn't that in a microcosm what our economy needs, more people buying goods and services?

20090128213440AA4TBsL	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Since when did 10 become just "pretty". ?	A 10 should be a totally spectacular out of this world knockout. Most celebrities wouldnt even be a 10. The type of girl who guys faint when they see her.    Girls see it as an insult if they are seen as a 7 or 8.    Technically the average girl should be a 5. And anything more than a 5 is above average. I don't see how every girl can expect to be "above average". By definition most girls should be a 5.  Otherwise "above average" would become "average".    If you look at a bell curve, less than 15% of the population would be a 7 or above. I do not understand this attitude that every girl thinks she is a 7 or above. Get it?

I need some advice on clothing styles to impress diff types of girls. There are quite a few girls that love to rave with me/go club-party. but theres 2 problems. 1) the girls at my highschool.. they dont like or dislike.. it seems like a lot of them dont notice me.. even though i am above average in looks, and have been told that im quite talented, i dont know how to get there attention more. 2) (more importantly to me) I sometimes have troubles finding what to do with girls when we hangout either just us two, or with a small group. I think it would be A LOT  easier for me, if i was better on picking up on how these girls like to see men dress, and act moreso. i know there are a lot of questions here, but i would appreciate it if someone took time to help me out. some extra info. girl #1 is a year younger, but shes very developed and is quite socially mature for her age. has older friends, a few piercings, loves to rave,.. etc. i would like to know how to get them more interested.
20090128213557AA7lXec	Social Science;Psychology	Did my former friends ruin it for me?	I am trying to figure out what happened to me that makes me not talk to married or taken men at all. Aquaintance business wise yes but friends no.      I am friends with women who are married but I rarely talk to their husbands. They(the women who are married) even know about this. And fine with it!      Anyway the only thing that I could come up with is back in highschool I set up my two best friends together. Well the guy friend started taking me out on all his dates and jokingly flirt with me in front of her. Then he told me that he cheated on her with someone else. And I was the one that had to tell her. Her and all of her friends thought I was the one that broke them up. That I was in love with him which I wasn't. I never did anything inappropriate with him.      They were 17 and 16 at the time and I was 18-19(graduating) and I didn't reach puberty until age 23 because of a disease.      This incident in highschool, could that be the cause of not talking to taken or married men? Even if my single guy friends get married or get a girlfriend I stop talking to them all together.    My reasoning is to avoid misunderstanding.         by the way I'm no longer friends with my highschool best friends.

20090128215526AAkjNXP	Social Science;Psychology	Replacing the Tapes????? What?	Years and years ago, I had a few sessions with a post traumatic stress therapist, and the direction that he gave me was INCREDIBLY HELPFUL.  In the years since then I have come across several different situations in my life where his advice would be highly beneficial if I applied it again.  But, here's the problem:      I didn't make a point to remember the process as we were doing it.  I remember the process he talked me through being called: "Replacing the Tapes" and it had to do with our habits being created by "tapes" that are set to "rerun" in our minds when we are in similiar situations, and if you want to change your actions you have to replace the tapes.  I'm pretty sure there was around 4 steps to this process and it was very manageable?  Is anyone familiar with this counseling technique?  Do you know of any websites/resources about it?  Because I could really benefit from it again now.  Thanks.

20090128215959AA1tebn	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do some women make it a point to present themselves as attractive in public but then...?	...get angry when they attract attention? (Or at least attention from unattractive men or men they are not interested in.)      Women (in general) spend more time getting ready to go out than men. They have to spend time putting on makeup, doing their hair, picking out what to wear etc., all for the sake of looking attractive.      What doesn't make sense is that when they do attract attention, particularly in the form of ogles, stares, whistles etc this is considered rude, perverted, or even barbaric.      If women don't want this kind of attention why don't they just leave the house in baggy clothes without makeup?
20090128221035AAKEhaI	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Strange dreams about dying?	I had a dream last week that I was swimming and I decided to swim under a dock to get to the other side. But when I got under the dock. I just started sinking and couldn't move to swim back up. I just turned around and looked up at he sky and the top of the water and kept sinking. I died. But I didn't panic or fight my body and emotions were paralyzed. It woke me up, I was scared and weird feeling of course. I probably could have just ignored it but it happened again. Last night I dreamed I was somewhere around people I new like at a church get together or something like that. There was some people there that i did not get along with. I don't know who they are in real life but I knew them in my dream. Well the dream goes on and I am walking down a hall with some people I knew and I was holding someones baby, and one of the people I didn't like put a plastic bag over my head and started smothering me. I kept looking at the people in front of me to help me but the just turned around and looked at me and I couldn't fight because I was holding the baby. I was really afraid I was going to drop the baby. I knew who was killing me in the dream, but not in real life. I died. Again I woke up scared and shaken. I just wonder If anyone knows anything about dreams about dying? I am a 35 yearold mother of 5. Married. No Major stress. Thanks for any suggestions!
20090128222543AAT9nyd	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What if feminism was only about this? Would you agree with it?	1 : the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes   Definition of feminism from the Merriam-Webster Dictionary       That's the only thing that I thought it was about, but apparently, from listening to all of you on here, its not.    That was the original idea though. That's what Susan B. Anthony thought, what Elizabeth Blackwell thought, etc. They thought that men and women should be treated equally, that's it. The only reason I think of myself as a feminist is because I agree with that.

I dreamed that I was in the mountains by my house and it was dark. I was being chased by people that wanted to kill me (I'm not sure why). After about 30 minutes of running and just walking around I saw this guy about my age there in the mountains also. For some reason I knew he didn't want to hurt me. So I told him about the people looking for me and slowly one by one he killed them off with ease.It wasn't very graphic I think he used a gun but most of the time I didn't watch. When we were sure no one was left he took me back to his house were he lived with his father. By this time I started noticing how beautiful he was. He had short blonde hair and a muscular body. One of the things I remember most about him are his dark almost black eyes. I knew he was a dangerous person capable of more than most but that never bothered me for some reason. I knew he would never hurt me because he loved me. Time went on and fast forwarded to about 10 years later. We had a couple children by then and after that it gets hazy and I can't remember anything else.    Every time I think about him I get this crazy feeling like hes real or something. Like it wasn't even a dream. It's driving me crazy because I feel like I'm in love with someone that's not real. It's weird.

20090128223229AAZ3teq	Social Science;Economics	Is capitalism completely corrupt and immoral?	Quick — try to think of the difference between the way Stalin ran the USSR and the way the average American CEO runs a multi-national mega-corporation. Those at the very top prosper, everyone else suffers, and the system is completely corrupt and immoral. (And don’t fool yourself that the stockholders are any more effective at controlling Comrade Chairman than were the Politburo; as in the old Soviet Union, the deck is stacked against the ‘little guy’ investor.)       On the other hand, Corporate America, and the world economy, are collapsing of its own weight. Read The Financial Times — the vipers in finance and investment no longer trust each other — no honor among these thieves — and the current corporate structure can’t make money for the stockholders nor even themselves anymore. Like any large beast doomed to extinction, they have greedily gorged themselves to the point where there are no more suckers left to fleece and they can’t fleece each other since they all play the same tricks. The bailout is their last desperate gasp before the final curtain. The diversified multi-national mega-corporation of today is finished, although its slow-motion fall will take a few years and there will be some further suffering on our part. The practitioners of Disaster Capitalism have finally seen the catastrophe dumped on their own heads and they don’t have a clue as to how to dig themselves out, since most of their inbred management, buzzing with the erroneous free market lingo of the transient MBA, are only slightly smarter and more adept than Bush the Younger. When your heroes are utter monsters like Al ‘Chainsaw’ Dunlap, or sleazy film characters like Gordon Gecko, your demise is predictable and well deserved. Fortunately for us, it seems President Obama is smarter than to go down with this sinking ship.

Today he wanted to know why I quit my live in/out nanny job since it helped with money and with getting away from the home during the weekdays. I told him that my 4 year old had told me and the mom of the 12 year old boy that lived there that the 12 year old had been touching him and messing with him in private places. When the 12 year old was questioned about this, it was quite obvious that he had been doing some things with my son that was not good.   The doctor told me he was required as a medical professional to report it to department of children services. He said the boy has probably done it before and will do it again and needs help. I have been quite upset about allowing them to play together But I resigned the job.  My friend and life coach said I should not have said anything to my counselor. I feel stupid not thinking that of course he will report it. I feel like I have a big mouth...but at the same time, I don't want this kid to do this to another. Should I have not said anything?

20090128225039AAOZYvR	Social Science;Psychology	Why am I always thinking about something? My mind is always racing with thoughts.?	For as long as I can remember I have always had a very active mind. So active it can actually be problematic at times.      When I try to read a paragraph for a school assignment or a few pages of a book I always start thinking about something else. Sometimes it feels as though I read it but I don't follow what it is saying. Because of this I have a really hard time following directions and learning from reading.      When I listen to my professors lecture I try to listen but I always get off track. I hate this because I love to learn and understand... I just can't focus, and the things I think about are usually not important at all.      Also, when I am having a conversation with someone I am almost always thinking about something else, but act as though I am listening... in reality I have no idea what they said. I think I just don't care what they are saying?      I try to pay attention but always end up thinking about something else, it is almost like I am talking to myself but in my head... if that makes sense.      I have noticed a personality change as well. I am not as social as I used to be. I used to drink a lot but I really don't drink at all anymore. I don't really try to socialize anymore either, I stay at home a lot.      I really do enjoy people though. Throughout my life I have had A LOT of friends. I feel like I have distanced myself from them. I feel as though I am not exciting as I once was. I don't like going to parties or bars or being around a lot of people. I used to love this!      I am just not interested in most peoples conversations. I have found most talk to be unnecessary and full of lies and exaggerations and it just bugs me now.      Has my personality just changed?      See I even changed subjects in my damn question!      Ahhhhhh

I'm asking this becuase some people are arguing that "feminism" has gone too far.

20090129024940AAqJlOr	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why are American women such bigots?	I have just been reading a question about American women.   The women themselves when compared to European women said that they where cleaner, not as hairy and more with it.   I beg to differ. Have you seen Italian and French women?   These women are the most feminine in the world they are stunning   Also a little hair on a women can be sexy.   I have yet to meet a European man who thinks American women are sexier. I have to redress this total fallacy that men some how fancy the pants of American women. Maybe some do but that is a fetish lol.   Any it is very bad when they say other women smell when all they smell of is overpowering perfume.

Also all his male friend assist him in covering it up.      The girl friend of the male in question is portrayed as a innocent victim who trusts him unconditionally. Her best friend goes out of her way to prove him a cheater. When she finds out she pours a jug of water over his head. The two girls proceed to high five each other and pronounce their undying desire to always trust each other and that girls rule.      regardless of how cheesy it was,  this is one example their are countless others where this mentality is been indoctrinated into teenagers and people of all ages, the dichotomy of girl = good and boy = bad.

20090129004101AAfu7n0	Social Science;Economics	Please help me with this / question about economics vs business?	first of all i'm interested in social science (political science, economics, sociology, etc.) My original major was International Relations (Political Science) but i don't think its challenging enough so i switched it to International Business because I'm fluent in Russian and I'm interested in Europe regions. Now i'm thinking I should major in Economics or International Economics minor in Russian because its far more challenging and marketable and apparently respectable major vs all of the above that I had mentioned.    The only thing that scares me about this major is math! I am horible at math (as of now), however I like learning and I don't have a problem with working hard and getting over this fear of mine. But I would still like to hear your thoughts on this. Tell me if I'm doing the right thing by switching from Inter. Business to Economic !??!      thank you ahead of time :)
20090129020802AA3zqa3	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What is the meaning of a reoccurring dream?	So as far back as I can remember (I have the memory of a goldfish, so we're only taking about five years or so) I have had a reoccurring dream, every couple months or so.      A body is suspended in a dark room through unseen means. There is a pale yellow light from below, so that we can see this man's torso, jaw, and to some extent his arms. This is the only illumination in the area. Everything else is a black void.      Now, suddenly, long drill bits start plunging into the man all over. No blood comes out. We can see them going through his teeth and gums, some penetrate his forehead, others his eyes. His muscles are pierced, bones are drilled, etc. etc.      There is no pain, there is no blood. The man reacts as if he expected it and enjoys it to some degree - it is not bliss, but similar to how you would regard a good book. Not exciting, it just feels good.      It is not determined if the person in the dream is me or not. I can see the dream in third person, but I have had other dreams in third person where I was the main character. The dream never reveals his face in any detail, only close ups of the drills piercing him.      It's not a nightmare; it's not frightening. I rather enjoy the dream, because the man is perfectly fine with what is happening to him. It's actually kind of a pleasant dream, very calm.

My cousin has really low self esteem, he talked to me the other day and told me that his low self esteem makes him very self conscious. He's really afraid of being rejected and not liked by others including strangers. He also told me that when conversing with others he can only stare at them for a short period of time before getting really intimidated. He tells me that when he speaks with people he feels his voice is too soft, that people can't understand him nor hear him, he also has problem formulating words on the spot; he over thinks everything,  that he ends up not saying anything! What good advice could you give me, for the next time I see him.      -Thanks in advance and God Bless

20090128235406AA8mFgd	Social Science;Economics	People don't like hearing economic truths-what to do?	People don't like hearing economic truths.   What does someone who is interested in discussing economics do when they don't find like-minded people who enjoy the same topic?... and are willing to hear unpopular truths that contradict some of their assumptions, ideas, or ideologies.  Some people say they don't care about other countries' economies (even though I use them to cite relevent sources of comparison), and only care about our US economy.  Others say that I couldn't know so much and insist the experts don't even know the answers (to which I respond that many economists do know many solutions for long-term economic growth that would be politically unpopular).      To me, development economics has been a passion of mine since childhood and in economics international comparisons have many benefits in isolatic economic variables and finding corrolations and patterns.  Also, I would prefer to say the truth and discuss relevant facts than to tiptoe and around facts while other people make incorrect statements.      My main question is, what should I change if I've decided I need to find a way to both get along with co-workers not interested in economics and also find people that do enjoy the topic?      Thanks.

20090128204016AAP1nQP	Social Science;Sociology	Why is he such a black sheep in deaf community?	I have had a couple deaf friends in high school and know a few in college that I’m at now.    I know that deaf people usually are very proud of their culture and very close knitted community.    But there’s this deaf guy in my photography class. He’s very disturbing to many. His works is amazing and have so much crazy stories behind them. But they’re rather dark and creepy. Many have nude female, gas mask, blood, bondage theme, etc… They are very tasteful but still really creepy and disturbing to others.   Many of his pictures were taken in illegal places such as mausoleum, abandoned building that are known to be incredible difficult to sneak in, and other things. He has spent a night in jail once for such thing. The teacher seems to think he’s so awesome and laugh at his story all of the time.    His profile for the class stated he like to box and kick boxing and his interest is girls who like taste of blood.   What is even weirder is, many deaf people don’t know of him, only very few know of him and most says he’s very aloof and a really jerk. But one girl says he’s really cool but doesn’t tolerate nonsense at all.   People in the photography class say he’s a very nice guy but you really need to have some guts to work with him and if you did, it’s so much fun.   What is this guy’s issue? Why is he like this? He doesn’t seem to fit in deaf community or have anything in common with any of them.

20090128233019AABlRjb	Social Science;Psychology	What should I do, when I'm in love with my childhood friend?	So, I knew him when I was younger. My earliest memory of my childhood, was with him and his family. My happiest moments in life was with him/them. Then all of a sudden, there gone. He left, went to some foreign country for 3 years. They came back when I was 12, he was freshman in high school. We barely talked tho, I got closer to him when we started playing football with my brothers. He was nice to me, and gave me complements, how i played. First it was just a crush, by some little girl. Then we moved, his family came sometimes. But after a while, they just didn't come anymore.       Emotions: What I felt, I feel like I don't know him. I love him, if it stands for anything. I think about him every single day, I want to know him. I should know him already, I feel like I know him spiritually. Little things he does, I notice. When a kind gesture happens, and no one notices... I notice. I know that doesn't make a person.       Question: How do I make him fall in love? I'm pretty good at manipulating people. I've made strong men fall to there knees for me. He just doesn't crack. The one person I want the most, won't give me the day of light. How do I catch his attention?

20090129015201AALFpZI	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does my dream mean?	so i just had a dream. In the dream, i was with a bunch of Africans and we were all in a car smoking and drinking. A women passed us and we all got out of the car and knocked her onto the floor. We then took her to the nearby roof of a building. Over their, i remember she was struggling to get away so we all stomped on her till we broke her jaw. ...This is the weird part : all 4 of us then proceeded to rape her violently. When were done, one of the guys pulled out a brand new glock. I remember one of the guys telling me that "she is a witness for what she's gone through, and if you kill her, you are guaranteed a spot in the crew".      Oh boy, it gets even wierder now. I put the gun to her head then pulled off the shirt cover, it was my mother. I remember feeling all sad and depressed because i had just beaten up my mother. I had gone to the ledge of the building...their i jumped off the roof...right before i hit the ground i woke up.      This dream got my scared, what does it mean?Thanks

20090129030438AAqn0CD	Social Science;Psychology	Would you feel guilty for that?	I'm married, 40, and have a kid of 10 years old. I got married 12 years ago with a woman I thought I was in love with, but at that time I didn't know exactly what love meant. After 6 years I left my family to work abroad for a year. And when I turned back, me and my wife were not getting along like we did before. I didn't want to divorce at that moment b/c of my son, but I went to work in the capital, where I've earned a lot of money ever since and I could bring my family to live with me.    The point is that she doesn't want it, and I assume she has somebody else in her life.   Sometimes I wished I divorced, but I don't know whose responsible for what has happened between us, and I don't want my son to suffer because of it.

20090129023938AAwfbUv	Social Science;Sociology	What words would you use to discribe Johns character?	John cheats on his wife almost every day. His wife knows so she acuses him sometimes but he will never admit to anything. Her heart is broken and John is well aware of the pain he is causing her but his cheating increases in frequency and partners. He used to not care if she found actual evidence of his cheating because he knew he could always explain it away but now he's leaving bras n pantys etc. on purpose in places he knows she'll see them. When she confronts John, he answers "I don't know." or simply does'nt answer at all. She was crying one day in the bedroom and she caught a glimpse of his reflection in the mirror. It shocked her and then she became afraid. He had wide eyes and a grin on his face as he watched her experience the incredible emotional agony he had caused her. John was obviously enjoying himself.             i
20090129030111AA3pFh7	Social Science;Psychology	Why women always walk behind their love as if they were their "Lord and master" ? I Think I found an answer!?	The answer came to me while I was looking to some photograph and I caught one of Tony Parker, and his wife Eva Longoria? A tiny little woman walking behind her husband.   The obvious answer that suddenly came to me was, women always walk behind their lover because in average they are not so tall. In a car, or in marriage ceremony they are beside, of course. While, when there was no car, they had to walk, and of course, men have the longer legs forcing women to follow.   Yes, we can also think that they let him go forward in order to seek refuge behind him. But since man is known not to have eyes behind the head, and arms are known to work essentially in front, that hypothesis doesn't totally explain everything.    Yet, from a natural fact, society has come to reach some arbitrary laws, or conclusions that say that women are "..." than men. Assumption obviously false!      .. What do you think?

20090129023633AAesZxO	Social Science;Economics	EMH cannot be correct?	I have 2 objections against the hypothesis. One relies upon a serious empirical observation and the other one - upon simple logic assumption.       1. I have tested a stock data with neural network to see its accuracy. It performed as expected with decent results - though not exactly the same as the real values, of course. Then, I was thinking that if I try to test the network on data which must be random and if the network guesses the "random" data - then the EMH should be right, because data which appears to be random can be guessed. But...then the network was not able to guess the random data, which obviously leads to the conclusion that EMH is wrong and the market  is not random, but chaotic perhaps or even deterministic(call it stochastic - it fits as well...relatively).       2. Here is the basic logical assumption: It is thought that trading is a zero sum game. Understand: a game with one winner - the other party always LOSE. But this is not quite the case. Imagine example where there is a magical fortunes formula which tells you that MSFT is going from 20 to 25 today and within the next year - from 20 to 100, though a serious volatility will be observed thorhout the longer period. So, what happens is that the short term traders would buy aggressivly and sell later to the long term traders who are richer and ready to meet the volatility.I know what are yu thinking:"Yeah but the longterm traders will also want to buy cheap for the short period of time". Though this sounding OK in this idealized version is not the case in practice. As we know, there are basically 2 schools of thought: fundamental vs technical(apart from the quantative...) and they both act on different time frames. So, Warren Buffet won't spend hours each day calculating moving average, while Joe the indian :) would in an attempt to profit from hourly changes. Hence, meeting those 2 types in a single deal would result in either win-lose,win-win,lose-lose situation.But saying that always one loses and others win - it's naive.  Hence it is not possible to say just: "all information is in the price, you cannot win:.       The greatest flaw of the hypothesis I guess is within the fact that it refers only the present prices and nothing else. So yes, the markets are effecient - but who says you can't make money?

Last night my girl friend had this dream that she keeps getting every 2-3days. She has this dream that i am flying an aircraft and I die because it crashes.  I am a pilot so i thought at start that it maybe just anxiety since i do fly regularly. But the dreams come every now and then...She gets very upset, every time it happens.. she wakes up crying and completely scared. So i was hoping if someone could interpret this dream for me.. as i really don't know what to do..   Its gone to such a state that she doesn't want to sleep at night because of that dream.

20090129025707AANK1vP	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why would she do this? What do other mothers think?	I have a 9 year old daughter, and a 8 year old son.  The other day I heard a commotion downstairs, and when I came down and saw my daughter standing over my son, holding his legs up, while pushing her foot into his groin. My son was in obvious pain.  I immediately told her to stop, which she did. My son was in pain, but was otherwise okay. Later I talked to my daughter and asked her why she did that. She said that he had made her angry, and that her friend (the same age) did it to her younger brother (he's 7) all the time. She also said she's seen her kick him many times. I asked her if her friend's mother knew what was going on, and she said that very often her friend did it in front of her mother, and that her mother had taught her to do this to boys when she is angry.  I told her to never do that again, and that what her friend was doing was wrong.    What I don't understand is why her friend's mother would allow, and even encourage her to do that?

20090129033337AAbEQ7q	Social Science;Economics	Are the low interest rates discouraging the lenders from lending?	In theory, high interest rates encourage lenders to lend but discourage borrowers from borrowing.  While low interest rates encourage the borrowers to borrow but discourage the lenders from lending.        It's possible for many lenders to persuade themselves with various mathematical models that the risks of lending have suddenly decreased.   And lend a lot more than before even when the interest rates are low.        Could it be that The Fed is expecting something like this to happen in the US economy?  It seems to me that only in this kind of a situation very low interest rates make sense.

She recently turned 18 and still lives at home. I am 16 and she treats me like dirt most of the time. There's days where she wakes up and everything is fine and treats me like a sister should. My sister is at work and when she isn't she'll go out with her BF.       She barely does anything around the house and her room is always a mess. She leaves her junk around and I end up picking it up. I told Mum how unfair and annoying it is and she spoke to my sister and told her to pick up her mess. It took her 2 days to get around to it! Today she walked into my room after going to the beach and left some black stuff on the carpet by mistake from her dirty feet. Now I have 4 stains in my carpet and no one will help me. I don't know where the products are to clean it and Mum just keeps saying "Dad will do it tomorrow they'll come out." They're pitch black and spread in white carpet! Arg!      This has given me a massive headache. Mum's gotten really lazy and she just won't help me with these stupid problems. Too lazy to get it through my sisters head. I am so angry. Please help me handle my frustration better.
20090129040017AAJUuQI	Social Science;Anthropology	Why do we wear clothes?	Okay just thinking outside the box here... the idea maybe a little warped??      Why do we wear clothes?   After years of natural selection, we have evolved to what we are now. Evolution allows for us to reach "perfection", or at least an ideal form that is most suitable for our given environment.    We are always evolving, constantly adapting into this ideal form.    After years of being "perfected", why do we wear clothes? We hid our perfections under clothing, make-up, hair dyes.... The closer we get to this ideal form, the more we cover ourselves up -hiding who we really are. We are at the top of the food chain, and yet we are the only animals (that I know of) that feel modesty and cover up or hid their body.       **Of course, I don't mind wearing clothes!! I honestly don't think we should all go around completely naked. I just think it's a little funny that we hid what we have become even after years of being perfected through evolution. Are we the only animals that understand modesty or vanity?      Thoughts/Ideas???
