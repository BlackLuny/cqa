I'm getting the error message 80040154. Or atleast I'm assuming I am getting that because when I installed it on my Vista computer thats what I got. Now, I tried to install it on my XP and the same problem came. The problem is that it won't sign in. I have tried absolutely everything. I've searched many webpages. I put those numbers into the Command prompt. It even said it succeeded. I went and re-installed that MXMLS or whatever the hell it's called package and it still doesn't work. MSN just won't sign in. It says that there an error and when I click on more details, I see something about crypt.dll and welcome.exe or something like that. I've tried absolutely everything. I have no idea what to do anymore. It worked easily for the Vista computer but XP is having some big problems. It's 64 bit btw. So anyways, any sort of help will be very much appreciated. Thank you!

In the last few months, my laptop (or the browser, don't know which) doesn't keep me logged in to sites like it used to. I think it might have been after downloading a newer Firefox (only browser I will use).

I am currently typing this from my desktop, and it keeps me logged into sites. What should I do on my laptop to make it do the same? I don't know if this computer (the desktop) has an older version of Firefox or not.

20070725183524AAegmMw	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Vista laptop question?	I'm thinking of getting a new laptop for school next year, and my school has a discount program for ordering laptops which has some pretty good deals... the only problem is that the only OS they sell on the laptops is vista. this would be fine, but all the software i have now is for XP. not wanting to spend the ridicules amount of money on new software bundles (remember... college student = little cash). i wanted to try and install all my old software. i did a little research and got back mixed results. some sites said vista is backwards compatible, some said it wasn't, and some said it was a program to program basis. My question is if i buy a vista notebook... will i have any compatibly problems ( stuff like MS office, Norton antivirus corporate edition, other misc software.) i have everything i need to do a fresh install of XP on any computer but i think it would be a shame to spend the extra money on Vista, only to have to wipe it out due to incompatibility.

I'm thinking under ￡100 price wise.  The one that broke was an ATI Radeon 9800XT so preferably something at least as good as that as.

20090203011341AAAQo1h	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	In desperate need of help with c++ problem!?	Write a program where the user enters numbers (doubles) on standard input. All of these numbers should be greater than zero, except for the last one, which should be -1. The -1 is a sentinel value and is how the user signals that he or she is done entering numbers.    Your program should read in all of these numbers, and print out one of three things after the user enters -1:       If the numbers are in ascending order (each number is greater than the previous one), then print "Ascending."    If the numbers are in descending order (each number is less than the previous one), then print "Descending."    If the numbers are neither ascending or descending, then print "No Order."    Ignore the final -1 in all three cases. Do print the period.       Your program must print its output after reading the -1, even though it may be able to determine that the input is in "No Order" after only a few numbers have been read.       You may assume that you always get legal input. You always get at least two numbers greater than zero, and the last number is always -1.       Hint: Think about how you are going to figure this out before you start writing any code. You will need only three variables to do this -- one to hold the last number read, one to hold the current number, and one to hold what you know about them so far. Let's call them last, current and state. The first two will be doubles, and the last is an integer. You can assign various meanings to state:       If state is zero (the initial state), then we don't know what the input is yet.    If state is one, then the input is ascending.    If state is two, then the input is descending.    If state is three, then the input is in no order.    Now, suppose we get the following input when we run ascend.    UNIX> ascend   3 4 5 3 -1      You will read the first number, and put it into last. Then you will enter a while loop to read numbers until you read -1. You will read each number into current, figure out what state should be, then copy current into last. For example, here are the variables after each number above is read:       last current state    3 ? 0 = Don't Know Yet    3 4 1 = Ascending    4 5 1 = Ascending    5 3 3 = No Order    3 -1 3 = No Order       When we read the -1, since state is three, we print out "No Order".       We are being a little sketchy on the details so that you can work it out for yourself. Be careful! Take a look at this example input:       UNIX> ascend   1 2 3 2 3 4 -1      The correct answer for this input would be No Order, but it is easy to mistakenly allow your code to think it is in ascending order (since the last three digits before -1 are ascending). You will need to take care to ensure that your code can handle this situation.             That is my current lab, and to be honest I don't know where to begin. Honestly a step by step deal would be really helpful if possible. I definately don't expect the answer, but I would like it if someone could give me the necessary knowledge to do this with. I'm just getting started in C++, so please give me an answer in lamans terms. Any help is much apprieciated.
20090203022510AAQ6zgN	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Please help with C++ Problem.?	This is my current lab, and to be honest I don't know where to begin. Honestly a step by step deal would be really helpful if possible. I definately don't expect the answer, but I would like it if someone could give me the necessary knowledge to do this with. I'm just getting started in C++, so please give me an answer in lamans terms. Any help is much apprieciated.    Suppose you want to keep your bank transactions on your computer, and you'd rather keep the information as a simple text file that you can manipulate using C++ programs, rather than being slave to Excel or Quicken. You decide to use the following format for your bank transaction file:   The first line will be the starting balance, and the last line will be -1.     All other lines will contain transactions.     There are three types of transactions: Deposits, checks and ATM withdrawals.     Deposit lines are of the form:   Year Month Day Amount    The year, month and day are all integers, and the amount is a positive double.     Check lines are of the form:   Year Month Day Amount Number    The year, month and day are all integers. The amount is a negative double and number is the check number, which is a positive integer.     ATM withdrawal lines are of the form:   Year Month Day Amount 0    The year, month and day are all integers, and the amount is a negative double.     Your program is going to read input in the proper format, and emit a very simple processing of the output. In particular, it is going to print 12 lines of output:       The starting balance.   The ending balance.   A blank line.   The date of the first transaction.   The date of the last transaction.   A blank line.   The number of deposits and total amount of deposits.   The number of checks and total amount of checks.   The number of ATM withdrawals and their total amount.   A blank line.   Your minimum balance during this period.   Your maximum balance during this period.

I have both PHP and SQL server access.      If you need to know anything else, let me know!      Thanks      Paul :o)

I already have an external for back ups.    My question is, would it be better to use the Raid 0 set up for my video files (If I did this I would have enough room to put video, music, and pictures on one drive) or for my OS. Or should I partition the Raid set up and use 100 GD for my OS and 300 GD for my video?    Or if anyone has a better sugestion, please let me know. The main thing is, I want at least 250 GD for Video.

I think this a good idea (unless someone else thought of it first, in which case it sucks, and I would have done it better.)      My idea is a search engine that does not bring up any pages where anything is sold or advertised for sale.  Guess what, money addicts?  Occasionally, some us want INFORMATION about something, not just another opportunity to buy it.  I'm sick of having to sift through a hundred links to pages to buy a book about Socrates, when all I'm looking for is a 1,000 word biography.  Yes, I know, no one would make money on such a web browser.  So what?  Wasn't there once a time when companies sponsered things, expecting no profit from it whatsoever, just because it was the RIGHT THING TO DO?        Anyway, how often do you think you would use such a browser if it were available?
