20090222172834AAiD9bF	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Chinese or Russian Themed  Mixed Drinks?	Hi everyone. I will soon be hosting a communist themed college party (I'm a capitalist, its all for fun) and I wanted three different drinks; a Cuban one, a Russian one, and a Chinese one. I have this amazing mojito like drink I can make for the cuban theme but I have no idea what a good Russian or Chinese themed drink would be. A white russian maybe?      Anyways, I'd prefer drinks where you can't tell how alcoholic they are. We will have signs posting how alcoholic each drink is but as a joke we want one of the "alcoholic" drinks to not have alcohol so we can see who is faking being drunk.  As such, I'd also prefer if one of the two drinks, the Russian or Chinese one, was non alcoholic.        If anyone has tips, they are greatly appreciated. Money isn't a huge issue, but we are on a college student's budget so keep that in mind. We are over 21 and have access to any type of drink or mixer we could ever need.

20090222201134AAOsaGh	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Where exactly do these little black fly/nat thingies come from?	Whenever I make a salad, or cut up fruit, or vegitables, these stupid black nat/fly things appear.  They linger a bit and they are so gross.  We were eating salad with dinner and it kept flying around.  I ate a bowl of cream of wheat later, and as I was eating i saw one of those fly things in my cream of wheat-minus one wing.  It really grossed me out.  I think it flew in my bowl...at least I hope.  Because to think it was packaged in my cream of wheat grosses me out.   But where do these little black nat/fly things come from exactly?  Why don't i see them flying around inside my bagged salad, or on the vegitalbes and fruit and only see them when I'm serving or making the food?

Besides cigars we're also going to be selling exotic and microbrew beers (bottles, not tap), nice wine, and hopefully some rums, scotches, and cognacs.

I have relationships with cigar distributors, but don't know how to get ahold of those wine/beer distributors. Anyone know how this is done? I'd like to get these drinks at vendor prices so I can price them fairly.
