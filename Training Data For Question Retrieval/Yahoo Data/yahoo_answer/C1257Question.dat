If you are pushing your brother (50kg) over the snow on a toboggan (where the coefficient is 0.10) with a force of 212 N, 30 degrees below the horizontal, how fast is he moving in 5 seconds if he started from rest?      Vertical components:      Fg=mg   =50(9.81)   =490.5N      Sin30=fay/212   Fay=106N      Fnety= Fg + Fay + Fn   0= 490.5 + 106 + Fn   Fn= 596.5 N       Horizontal components       Cos30= fax/212   Fax=183.59N      Ff = μ Fn   = 0.10(596.5)   Ff= 59.65N      Fnet horizontal= 183.59-59.65   = 123.94N      A= fnet/m   = 123.94/50   =2.4788 m/s^2      V2 = V1 + aΔt   = 2.4788(5)   =12 m/s^2      Any help would be appreciated.

20090203151338AAhfZ1S	Science & Mathematics;Zoology	How does one save bees?	In school today a bee landed on my backpack(it looked like a wasp too me) and everyone freaks out..including me a little bit. I love animals including insects even though Im a tad intiminated. The thing is people are very ignorant thinking all bees sting which they dont. Im not sure on the facts but only female honey bees sting I believe. My question is how to save them,put them outside quickly so it doesnt interupt the class. A teacher killed the bee today thinking hes a hero for preventing a sting after me and my friend said to not kill it. It was on my property and was just crawling(appeared weak,its winter here). Killing is quicker and easier when in an assembly. Please help..I know how important bees are and if people continue doing things like this we wont have our most important pollonators. =[

20090203155113AAwtGHk	Science & Mathematics;Physics	How big of a jump would you say it is from Aristotle's gravitation to Relativity and Quantum Theory?	I heard that Aristotle's theory, or explanation, for the reason things fall to the earth and Celestial bodies moving in certain ways was he believed that there is a rule saying things move towards their natural positions.  Then Newton said that there's an actual force making things fall towards the earth and bodies of Celestial mass to be drawn towards each other.  For hundreds of years, everyone thought that no one in their right mind would doubt that.  Then Einstein said gravitation is not an actual force, but rather curvatures in spacetime, or General Relativity.  Then later we had Quantum Theory.      Some say that whenever there is a well-supported big theory in Science which is then shown false, it's only just modified very slightly and that there is no need to panic about Science being very close to the actual objective truth.      So I was wondering, would you agree/disagree that 1. Aristotle's Theory of Gravitation was just "slightly different" than Einstein's General Relativity or Quantum Theory? 2. Agree/disagree that Newton's Force Theory was just "slightly different" than curvatures in spacetime or Quantum Theory?

20090225065457AAZ0T9t	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Does this theory on how life was made on earth sound believable?	The weather is what made life on earth. In other words the active planet that we have created life here on earth.      Look at it this way, if protein A is in one side of the earth and protein B is in the other side of the earth the activities on the earth with its tornadoes, lightning storms, whirlpools and wind would eventually get them together to form a cell. Thus, life begins.
20090203155442AAU4Vmc	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physical Limitation of Straws?	Explain how it is that you are able to drink liquids through a straw.   Do not use "suck" in your explanation.   Be careful about what causes what.   (Hint: how must the volume in the air pocket change?)   It is impossible to drink through a vertical straw that is taller than a certain height. It turns out that this is not a human limitation, but rather a physical one. That is, even if a very powerful "suction machine" were used, there is a limitation on the height to which the fluid can go. Explain why this is the case.

20090225065008AAkqYCd	Science & Mathematics;Zoology	Do all animals excrete nitrogen compounds in their urine?	If so, what is it about the chemistry of animal life that makes this necessary?  Or what is it about the evolutionary pressure on animals that works against the animal retaining its nitrogen compounds?      I have read that by growing _duckweed_ in sewage and feeding the duckweed to tilapia (fish), then feeding the tilapia to humans, it is possible to recycle the biotically useful nitrogen. Is the chemical "elevation" of the urea (evidently unusable by animals) to amino acids (usable by animals) related to photosynthesis? What does the duckweed have that we mammals (along with the reptiles, fish, birds, . . . ?) don't, that enables it to push forward such a conversion?

20090203161442AAYlR8p	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Micro-evolution vs Macro-vision...again?	Natural selection is a logical process that anyone can observe (and it was actually a creationist named Edward Blyth who first wrote about it in 183537, before Darwin). We can look at the great variation in an animal kind and see the results of natural selection. For instance, wolves, coyotes, and dingoes have developed over time as a result of natural selection operating on the information in the genes of the dog kind.    But there are limits. For instance, you cant breed a dog to the size of an elephant, much less turn it into an elephant. As Dr. Ray Bohlin said, For essentially every trait, although it usually harbors some variability, there has always been a limit. Whether the organisms or selected traits are roses, dogs, pigeons, horses, cattle, protein content in corn, or the sugar content in beets, selection certainly has an effect. But all selected qualities eventually fizzle out. Chickens don't produce cylindrical eggs. We can't produce a plum the size of a pea or a grapefruit. There are limits to how far we can go.    And the thing is, what are they? Dogs. What were they? Dogs. What will they be? Dogs. The same could be said for Darwins finches, peppered moths, and so forth. There is a big difference between subspeciation (variation within a kind) and transspeciation (change from one kind to another). And yes, there are a lot of semantics that go on with what is considered a new species or what is a kind. Ill leave that to the experts to wrangle about. The thing is, they have great variability and adaptability, but they are still dogs and bacteria, etc.     As Dr. Carl Wieland said, Bacteria actually provide evidence against evolution. Bacterial populations multiply at incredibly high rates. In only a matter of a few years, bacteria can go through a massive number of generations, equivalent to millions of years in human terms. Therefore, since we see mutation and natural selection in bacterial populations happening all the time, we should see tremendous amounts of real evolution happening. However, the bacteria we have with us today are essentially the same as those described by Robert Koch a century ago. In fact, there are bacteria found fossilized in rock layers, claimed by evolutionists to be millions of years old, which as far as one can tell are the same as bacteria living today.    And as Dr. David Berlinski said about this (when being interviewed for Icons of Evolution), When we look at dogs, no matter how far back we go, its dog. When we look at bacteria, no matter what we do, they stay bugs. They dont change in their fundamental nature. There seems to be some sort of an inherent species limitation and we have no good explanation for this in terms of Darwinian theory. We should have far more flexibility, far more plasticity under laboratory conditions than we actually do if Darwinian theory or anything like that were correct.     There certainly seems to be a permanence of kinds. As zoologist Dr. Walter Veith has said of the fruit fly thats been bred and mutated and bombarded with more evolutionary processes than anything else, and weve produced all these different varieties and characteristics and deformities: But, its always fruit flies. How many tunes can I play on a piano? Unlimited tunes, but its always piano music. How many tunes can I play on the violin? Unlimited number of tunes, but its always violin music.

20090225065347AApZvic	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Doppler effect question?	I have the following question: A train traveling at 25m/s blows its whistle (f=1500Hz). What frequency is heard by (1) an observer that the train approaches, (2) a passenger traveling on the train in front of the whistle?      For 1) I did:       f' = vsound/ (vsound - vsource) x fsource   = 1500Hz (340m/s / (340m/s - 25m/s ))   =1619.0 Hz       2) For the second one I wrote that since the passenger is on the train, then the frequency heard would equal that of the frequency emitted, so the passenger would heard 1500Hz.       Are these answers correct?

A snowball is thrown from the edge of a platform with a velocity of 15   m/s with an inclination angle of 25 degrees. After 3 seconds, how far will it have fallen below the horizontal ledge?      **********   Ok so in this problem, I am trying to find how far it falls below its horizontal ledge, as simple as that sounds, its been aggravating my mind for nearly an hour.       This is my way of looking at it. I first thought of the time it took for the snowball to reach its maximum height from the left parabolic arc      vf = v0y - gt   0 = v0y - gt    t = v0sin(x)/g = .64686 seconds.       Then I calculated its maximum height, which is y_max = (1/2)gt^2 = 2.0502 meters. Now to the hard part, how to calculate the height below the ledge at t = 3 seconds?       I tried subtracting the time when the snowball hit the maximum height from 3 seconds when its below the ledge but I got a different answer (27ish) which was definitely wierd

Ok, this question is deriving my crazy       http://www.webassign.net/userimages/kasa...       and here are the answers i tried        http://www.webassign.net/v4cgi/student/a...       At first i thought a simple aldol additon, the keton becomes the NU and attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes protonated with D, didnt work      second is the same, but i thought maybe it went through condensation since there was conjugating double bond.       third was stupid i just thought the D attaches to enolate ion.       fourth was kinda long, i made the attachment just like number one, but instead of going to the second step of the reacion, i made it so the oxygen anion in the carbonyl, puts the electrongs to reform the double bond and the ethoxide leaves as a leaving group, giving back our starting base, after that the ethoxide again takes another alpha proton, then enolate forms then dutirum protonates the enolate.      Obviously wrong. I strongly believe i came close to the answer on my fourth try.      Please help, explanation is needed :D

20090304194407AAvNGgM	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Tidal influence - This is my HW question. Can someone help me? Thanks!?	Not going to lie. This is my homework question but I have been working on it for some time now and don't understand what its really asking.  Anyone think they know?  Thanks to all who answer!      Tidal influence is proportional to the mass of the disturbing body and is inversely proportional to the cube of its distance.  Some astrologers claim that your destiny is determined by the “influence” of the planets that are rising above the horizon at the moment of your birth. Compare the tidal influence of Jupiter (mass = 1.9×10^27 kg; distance = 7.8×10^11 m) with that of the doctor in attendance (mass = 80 kg; distance = 1 m).

20090304194544AAtNk0h	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Tricky division question?	ok, so Lynna invented an algorithm to solve this word problem. "Hattie had 544 candies to share with her friends. she gave each of her 17 friends the same amount of candy. How many candies did each friend get?"      Lynna began with the dividend and subtracted 170 from it. it is important to note that lynna conceived of this operation of subtracting as 17 units of 10, not 10 units of 17. She knew the number of groups and was taking away 10 units from the total of 544 for each group. ok . . so here is what she did in number form.       544   -170 10 candies for each friend   ---------   374   -170 10 candies for each friend   -------   204   -170 10 candies for each friend   -------   34   -34 2 candies for each friend   -------- ---------------------------------------   0 32 candies for each friend..         OK so my question is i dont really understand WHAT she is doing exactly, how she is using this algorithm. AND how would she do the division problem 161 divided by 7?       any help would be appreciated! i just get confused somewhere a long the using groups of 10 to represent 17 thing, and in translating her method to 161 divided by 7 im not really sure what to do..       THANKS!

20090304194803AATLtIk	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Looking for general advice in the field of Electrical Engineering. I'm a 3rd year university student.?	I'm a student in the EE major and I was looking for input in what kind of activities I should look into outside of the classroom to help get me prepared for the field.  More specifically some of these questions might aid you in helping me out?      Is there a book out there you think might be a must read for anybody going into the field?        What fields of EE do you feel like are going to be important in the next 50 years? What do you consider to be an exciting field.      What does your typical day look like as a EE?       Do you consider getting a PE license a necessity in this field, or is less relevant than other fields because of the constant changing in technology?      What's a good website to stick into my daily visits in order to gain a little knowledge about the field everyday?       I've developed a passion for photography (moreso in technical aspects) in the past two years, could you think of any path that might lead me through this type of application with an EE major?      That's about all I have for now. If you can just answer one question, that's fine.  I'm the first person in my family to attempt this major and have no close contacts in this profession.  ANY input is greatly welcomed and appreciated.

The constraint is:      (3a+2a+2c+d+2e+f+3g)/(a+b+c+d+e+f+g) >= 2      Like I said I just need help getting rid of the division so that I can put the constraint into Excel solver.   Thank you!!!!!
20090304204832AA78eKn	Science & Mathematics;Physics	What is a photon, if light can be emitted from atoms?	Knowing that lasers work by exciting atoms until they emit light, what is a photon if it can come out of an atom? Since a laser doesn't ionize the atoms, it can't be an electron. And I can't think of what else it might be.

H + H --> H2 + 5eV      When hydrogen atoms collide in free space, they bounce apart. Prove that it is impossible to satisfy the laws of conservation of momentum and conservation of energy in a two body collision which releases energy. Aim to show that the initial momenta would have to satisfy an impossible condition.          Any hints to help me come to the answer would be great. Thanks!

20090304210713AAWXQcz	Science & Mathematics;Physics	If someone developed a matter-energy teleportation device, would you use it?	Like the one in Star Trek. The idea is that your body is disassembled, atom by atom, converted to energy, and relayed to another location, where it is converted back to matter and reassembled.      Aside from the fact that its not currently in the scope of technology, if it were one day developed, would you use it? The big issue is that, when you are disassembled, you effectively die. However, at the receiver, a copy of you is made. So, if you died, such a device would create new life   If you believe in an afterlife/immortal soul, the implications of all this are much more complicated.      I, personally, would never if one were developed
