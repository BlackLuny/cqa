20090227115813AAJyB3W	News & Events;Current Events	Drinking alcohol can cause cancer...do enough people know?	There is no doubt that alcohol can cause seven types of cancer.    The more you cut down on alcohol, the more you reduce your risk of cancer.    There is limited risk if you only drink a little - such as one small drink a day for women or two for men.    You don’t need to be drunk to increase your risk.    Drinking and smoking together are even worse for you.    The consequences of drinking too much alcohol go well beyond the evening’s embarrassing antics or the morning’s hangover. Scientific studies have confirmed that alcohol can also cause cancer.       Obviously, not everyone who drinks will develop cancer. But on the whole, scientists have found that cancer is more common in people who drink alcohol than people who don’t.       ...So you gonna give it up altogether?

Stoning of prostitutes, stonings of rape victims, stonings of be who 'dishonour the family', hangings of homosexual, mutilation of thieves..... and I can go on and on....

It might be because 'its religious law', but once again, that proves that a religion with dated ways and rules has no place for a civilised world to exist.
20090227114628AA6DyPr	News & Events;Current Events	Why are the US/Isrealis using White Phosphorous on the people of Gaza?	White phosphorus bombs used by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip were produced and supplied by American arms manufacturers, according to an Amnesty International report that called for a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel.      The report documented dozens of weapons used by Israel and Hamas during the three-week offensive, concluding that both groups had carried out attacks on civilians constituting war crimes punishable by international law. The UN Security Council should impose an embargo until a mechanism was established to ensure that military equipment was not used to carry out such violations, said Amnesty.       White Phosphorous spreads over a large area and when it gets on your skin it will burn to the bone.  This is chemical warfare and illegal but the USA has used it in the illegal invasion of Panama, in the 12 day siege of the Holy City of Fallujah.  Many children have been seriously wounded for life from American chemical warfare.  When will it stop?       http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/wo...
