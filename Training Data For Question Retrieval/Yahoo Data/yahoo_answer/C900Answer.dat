Of course public health is mostly working in government and hence will have more bureaucracy than other places.  Social workers working in small non-profit agencies generally experience less frustration.  DA|`|wRpY2FRXaa	There are frustrations in all kinds of work or career at one point or another because of varied stakeholders and interests, changing plans, policies, objectives and strategies that have to be harmonized in order to successfully implement a program or project.  Social work and related fields that are geared to improving the quality of human life are one of the most noble and most fulfilling careers.  If you have a heart for helping people especially the needy ones - dont let "frustrations", perceived or real deter you.  What counts is the time and effort you put into a worthy cause.

YL8R3Jubaa	Hi, sorry to be the messenger of bad news on this but, yes your brokerage firm has the right to sell you out because you didn't provide the funds to settle the trade on the stock you purchased.  And yes if your account is in a debit position ($500.00) then you need to pay them back otherwise it will potentially effect your credit score and if you ever try to get a loan you will have to explain why you didn't pay the brokerage firm what they were owed.  In the future, you are better off having the cash up-front in an IRA before making a trade.  It sounds like you did an EFT (electronic funds transfer) from your bank to your brokerage firm but, you used a bank account that didn't have any money in it, so the money never showed up.  Most firms allow you to trade on the expected funds to be received before they physically arrive in your account.  This isn't a good practice for  you to use in the future.  Wait until the funds settle, i.e., you can see the debit in your bank account for the amount transfered to your brokerage account.
1H7aNVT3aa	Don't close the zero balance cards now.  You can pay down the ones you have now, that makes sense because the interest rates are high now and we aren't earning much in savings.  Also, your cards show your credit history, so closing a card that you have held a long time has an adverse impact on your score.  The ratio of credit available vs credit outstanding would drop.<br>  <br>  The only cards that you may want to think about closing are department store cards.  Keep the Visa, MC and Amex ones|`|suWnr83laa	Leave the ones with zero balance open. Pay down the ones you can.

That is what increases your credit score.|`|YL8R3Jubaa	Hi, it isn't necessary to close $0 balance credit card accounts.  In fact the more credit you have available the higher your credit score.

One site that I personally use and love is free to join, unlike most 'money making sites' out there. <br>  <br>  Basically what you do is fill out free surveys and offers, and they pay you to do this. They pay around $.25-5.00+ depending on whichever one you do. You can do as many as you like and there are hundreds to choose and do from. There are other ways to earn money on the site, such as referring friends, or participating in their rewards program and earning points to get prizes. <br>  <br>  I personally make around $150-200ish extra a month, that's on the low side and I don't do it everyday...there are stay at home moms though and other people with a lot of time on their hands that does make over $1000 a month. If you'd like to see proof of payment and read more about the site that I use you can visit my website.

Second, if you do decide to quit, be sure an give notice ahead of time or else it doesn't alway reflect on you positively when applying for another job and they ask for references.  Third, they could be looking out for your best interest considering the bad economy and ever increasing unemployment rate; it's bad out there!

3Ze4nR9Caa	Generally speaking, rental properties are listed either once they are vacant, or when a tenant gives 30 days notice.  So, if you're not ready to move in for 3 or 4 months, you probably shouldn't even be looking right now - you are only wasting your time, and the time of whoever is showing you properties.  Landlords just aren't willing to hold a property that long, no matter how much they like the prospective tenants.  <br>  <br>  When you get a little closer to your actual move out date, you should try looking on craigslist - it's probably your best bet.  I work for a property management company, and we advertise on multiple websites, and by far, the majority of our calls come from ads we've placed on Craigslist.<br>  <br>  Another option, depending on how much you are looking to pay for a rental, is to enlist the help of a Realtor.  There are a lot of "starving" agents out there who still need to make money, despite the decline in the market.  In the past, most agents wouldn't even bother with leases, but now, you'd be surprised at how many of them are out there helping people just like you find places to live.  And the best part is, since the landlord pays the broker fees, it won't cost you anything extra to use one.|`|hAUBw6ffaa	if u are in usa try craiglist.com

The last thing is, don't get discouraged because it is tough economic times and its really hard to hire people.|`|fi3HRxABaa	well most jobs really dont like hiring someone who walks in with a huge preggers belly on an interview cus they know youll need time off right away or in the near future. they technially cant "not" hired you cus its discrimination but they get around it by saying someone was more qualified.<br>  <br>  as long as you fill out the applications that you are qualified for...and dress business like for interviews youll be fine.<br>  <br>  A BIG THING TO REMEMER RIGHT NOW IS EVERYONE IS LOOKING FOR JOBS RIGHT NOT, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS AS BAD AS IT WAS 30 YRS AGO, SO YOU ARE COMPETEING FOR WORK WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN LAID OFF AND ARE LOOKING FOR ANY JOB...ITS HARD OUT THERE RIGHT NOW FOR EVERONE.|`|yTD84yFlaa	The reason you can't get a job is because you are pregnant.  That tells me (The manager) a few things:<br>  <br>  First and most important; health problems.  You can't lift heavy things.  You can't be under lots of stress.  You -need- people to help you.<br>  <br>  Second, How are you planning on handle the next few months?  Are you gonna work; then leave for maternity leave?  Why would I want to train someone, and hire them, just for them to leave after 3 months for maternity leave?  (obviously that question is rhetorical; and depends on how far a long you are).<br>  <br>  Third,  Whether people will admit it or not, pregnant @ 16 is not a responsible action.  That alone leaves a bad impression before we even have an interview.<br>  <br>  All in all; times are hard.  You're gonna have a tough time getting a job even if you weren't pregnant.  Don't do just applications, you need to make a Resume to turn in along with an application.  (PLEASE attach them w/ a paperclip or staple; I -HATE- having to attach them myself).  It doesn't matter if you've never had a job; there are plenty of things you can put on a Resume.  <br>  <br>  Also, when you go, go in the morning.  Ask to talk to a MANAGER and ask about the job, ask when/if they are hiring.  Leave a -GOOD- impression.  You need to try to suck up.  <br>  <br>  Think of it this way.<br>  <br>  Would you hire someone who just walks in, dressed nice, and drops off an application?<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  Would you hire someone who comes in, requests to talk to you, carries a strong conversation, and gives you a Resume + Application?<br>  <br>  The second tells me a few things:<br>  <br>  A)  You're prepared.<br>  B)  You can start conversations quickly; most minimum wage jobs require customer interaction and the fact you can just start talking to people is a plus.<br>  C)  You -WANT- to work; you need to make sure the Manager understands that.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you :)|`|LXgJVhfpaa	well honey sorry to tell you the economy is so bad rigt now your outta luck unless you get lucky, since you are 16 im assuming your still with your parents so i suggest you continue going to school and focus on the medical field, things will not be getting better so the best jobs to get into would be medical but if i were you and you absolutly needed a job try fast food returants, i doubt there are jobs there but its probally the best expecially if you do not have expereience,
f9a39482114c5f9844fc5040ac337bd4aa	I would always pick Accounting because that's where my interest lies.

vqdurAA5aa	The $9.95 in your example is a base rate, the charge just for making a trade.<br>  <br>  This is probably used to pay for the cost to the brokerage of managing an options account. Of course, it is also enough to give them some profit as well.<br>  <br>  The extra dollar per contract is to offset the additional risk associated with larger positions, as well as make some additional profit.<br>  <br>  Brokerages have to make a profit to stay in business. <br>  <br>  $9.95 plus $1 per contract is higher than a lot of discount brokerages.
sttPssS8aa	There are lots of opportunities right now everywhere. But the problem is: the right timing for the job to hit you. You can become an online tutor or something. Online businesses right now are hitting the net because people are desperate of jobs. <br>  <br>  The sweet thing about this one is that the start up fees are not present. In short, they are free to start and you can earn as many as you want literally, depends entirely of your efforts, tie and dedication in doing it.
58cfb3933858f1cc29cad9e0a4f9ad95aa	I don't really know for a fact, but I'm just trying to use some logic to answer this one.  One of your ingredients is sugar...isn't the sugar also made by another company? (Just like the taco seasoning is made by another company.)<br>  <br>  If you make crafts and sell them, are you worried because the paint you're using is made by another company?<br>  <br>  Like I said, I don't know the actual answer to this, but thinking about it logically, I think it's legally okay for you to use the taco mix just as much as it's legally okay for you to use the sugar. (The taco mix will already be mixed in the salad dressing right, you're not just re-selling the unopened packet, correct?)|`|umEgRb7Vaa	No, it isn't legal, at least not without that company's permission. You can give away the recipe but you can't make profit from it.|`|DsjNEnNNaa	Perhaps you should find out what the company uses in their mix and try to replicate it as best as possible so that all you ingredients is yours.

If the majority of the business of the organisation is conducted outside of Norway that could give you tax advantages.

Qf5Ua6zdaa	Correttamente, Daniela, ti ha detto bene; alla scadenza dei gg, devi tornare dal tuo medico e farti fare un certificato di prolungamento x il periodo ti tempo che ritiene + opportuno; al contempo (il giorno dopo) devi fare l'avviso di malattia (prolungamento) alla ditta/azienda x la quale lavori; farti debita copia del nuovo certificato (ke ti servirà per l'assicurazione) per l'inoltro all'Agenzia ke segue la pratica; Fatti le fotocopie di tutte le spese occorse x l'incidente, compreso eventuali visite specialistiche, ausili ortopedici (collare e quant'altro); possibilmente, cerca di scannerizzare tutti i documenti ke riguardano questo evento (certif. ospedale, certificati successivi, spese sanitarie, x successive riabilitazioni, visite specialistiche e/o legali, spese x Agenzia, ausili ortopedici); dopo averle scannerizzate, salvale in 1 apposita cartella ke kiamerai, ad es. "Incidente auto (o altro) del .....data incidente"; in questa cartella ci metterai tutta la documentazione scannerizzata in precedenza, in modo da avere 1 arkivio informatico dell'evento e di tutta la documentazione.<br>  Alla fine della pratica, ti converrà fare una visita legale specialistica ke certifiki se esistono "postumi".

0973da6afdfb24dc58c77bc8809d0fd0aa	Muchos sitios de Internet pagan un porcentaje a usuarios solo por leer publicidades. <br>  Lo que necesitas es: <br>  ? Cuenta en PayPal: <a href="http://www.paypal.es/es" rel="nofollow">http://www.paypal.es/es</a> para que nos depositen el dinero, es gratis y no se necesita tarjeta de crédito ni cuenta bancaria. <br>  ? Tiempo, alrededor de 3 minutos por día para hacer click en las publicidades. <br>  ? Conseguir referidos para así realmente empezar a ganar dinero. <br>  Encima lo haces mientras revisas el correo o chateas!<br>  <br>  ?Cómo? <br>  <br>  1- Antes que nada, si no estás registrado en Paypal, debes hacerlo. Es muy fácil, nada más sigue las indicaciones y completa con sus datos. Es gratis y no se necesita tener tarjeta de crédito ni cuenta bancaria.<br>  <br>  2- Debes registrarse en: <a href="http://bux.to/?r=monsenz" rel="nofollow">http://bux.to/?r=monsenz</a> que es la página con la que vamos a trabajar. Ve a JOIN NOW, llena todos los datos, poniendo tu mail real obviamente. Donde dice "paypal e-mail" deben poner la dirección de correo con la que se registraron en paypal.<br>  <br>  Nota: monsenz es mi cuenta, debe quedar asi ya que yo soy el que refiere. Cuando ustedes crean su cuenta y refieren el link (como estoy haciendo yo ahora) seran ustedes los que deben referir para recibir plata por cada vez que los usuarios a los que ustedes refieren hacen click.<br>  <br>  3- Una vez registrado es facil, luego de apretar login y poner su nick y clave, van a Surf Ads y va a aparecer una lista de direcciones. Abre una y espera los 30 segundos de un contador que aparece arriba de la página, cuando el contador llegue a cero tiene que aparecerles la palabra Done y un tilde verde al lado, de lo contrario hicieron algo mal o tienen problemas con su navegador. Siga así con todas una a una y no todas a la vez, porque sino no las toma.<br>  <br>  Por cada página visitada nos va a sumar 1 centavo de dólar. Si nos ponemos a pensar, clickeando solo nosotros, nunca llegaríamos a una suma de dinero que nos conforme.<br>  <br>  <br>  ?Qué hacer? ???Referir a otros usuarios!!!<br>  <br>  Cada usuario referido que clickee un anuncio, además de sumar un centavo él, nos suma un centavo a nosotros. Entonces con un solo referido que clickee la misma cantidad que nosotros, ya tendríamos el doble de ingresos. Y ni hablar de si consigue 200 ó 300 referidos, pueden llegar a ganar más de 100 dólares por mes. Saquen la cuenta.<br>  <br>  ?Cómo referir a otros usuarios?<br>  <br>  Muy fácil, con el link que nos dan en la sección My Stats. Los usuarios que se registren desde ese link quedan como referidos nuestros y por lo tanto nos suman plata.<br>  <br>  Cuando llegamos a un monto superior a los 10 dólares, ya estamos listos para transferir la plata a paypal. Debemos ir a My Stats y luego a cashout. En unas horas ya tendremos la plata en paypal.<br>  <br>  Se puede gastar la plata en sitios como MercadoLibre, o en aquellos sitios donde acepten PayPal.<br>  <br>  Ejemplo:<br>  ? 35 referidos clickean 10 publicidades por día = $3.50 dolares<br>  ? Tus ganancias diarias = $3.50 dolares<br>  ? Tus ganancias semanales = $24.50 dolares<br>  ? Tus ganancias mensuales = $105.00 dolares<br>  Es cuestión de conseguir referidos y esta bueno para comprarse cosas por Internet. Cuando uno se da cuenta ya tiene algo de plata, ?y a quien no le hace falta? <br>  Acá hay algunos sitios más como a este: <br>  <a href="http://thebux.com/?r=monsenz" rel="nofollow">http://thebux.com/?r=monsenz</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clickbux.org/pages/index.php?refid=monsenz" rel="nofollow">http://www.clickbux.org/pages/index.php?...</a> <br>  Acá te pagan por hacer un blog <br>  <a href="http://www.yuwie.com/yuwie.asp?r=79048" rel="nofollow">http://www.yuwie.com/yuwie.asp?r=79048</a><br>  Y acá por contestar encuestas: <br>  <a href="http://www.AWSurveys.com/HomeMain.cfm?RefID=monsenz" rel="nofollow">http://www.AWSurveys.com/HomeMain.cfm?Re...</a><br>  <br>  Saludos.

bmm2ktm6aa	Es dinero virtual, es lo que se viene en el futuro. Hay una propuesta de eliminar el dinero fisico, osea eliminar los billetes. Pero es con fines de dominacion mundial, hay que tener cuidado. de esta manera todo negocio ilegal y libertad seran suprimidos. Nadie podra comprar ni vender si no tienes la tarjeta o el numero se parece a esta: "nadie podra comprar o vender sin tener el numero de la bestia", asi que mucho cuidado vamos por ese camino, pero no se preocupen nosotros no veremos esa realidad, seran las generaciones que siguen, quizas nuestros hijos veran el comienzo de ese fin que viene...<br>  Sirve para comprar sin tener billetes en la mano. Muchas personas estan muy equivocadas y compran a diestra y siniestra no se miden en su gasto, al final de todo ese gusto de comprar viene el disgusto porque tienen que pagar todo las cosas que han comprado, en realidad te trae mas disgustos que gusto. Pero en ningun aviso de comercial de tarjetas de credito te dice que tienes que pagar, solo te dicen que compres sin preocuparte, te mienten si te dicen la verdad nadie va a querer tener una tarjeta de credito.<br>  la tarjeta de credito ayuda, es buena tenerla, pero hay que medirse en los gastos, hay que tener presentes que a fin de mes tienes que abonar a la cuenta de la tarjeta todas las cosas compradas osea pagar, no es gratis. No existe nada gratis en este mundo. Si no pagas te pondan intereses y tu deuda crecera y crecera hasta hacerse inpagable y pudes ir a la carcel, en EEUU si se va a la carcel por deudas. Aqui en Peru no se va a la carcel por deudas, aqui es una ventaja.<br>  Es mentira que la tarjeta de Credito apresure y sea veloz en las compras como dicen los comerciales. La verdad es retarda las colas en las cajas de pago, esperas mas tiempo, porque debes mostrar un documento y firmar el bendito papelito que te dan. Comprar con dinero "cash" es mas el sistema mas rapido y mejor, no te da deudas al final del mes y no te enbargan o te envian a la carcel, porque puedes medirte, si se acaba el dinero simplemente no pudes comparar mas. Es recomendable para compradores impulsivos, ellos no deben tener una tarjeta de credito.<br>  Si es util en el internet, pero solo si entras a comprar en sites serios y de prestigio, porque hay malos sites que por una compra que has hecho, luego te apaceren otras compras que tu no has hecho y cuando reclamas no quieren devolverte el dinero, y si te devuelven te dan solo el 60% el resto no te dan todo porque ellos dicen que se ha generado gastos en la operacion y no puede ser devuelto, y eso es un robo para el cliente. A tener cuidado en comprar en internet. Te sugiero que saques una tarjeta virtual de pago, hay muchos sites que ofrecen eso para comprar en internet. con ellas puedes comprar cosas a cualquier site y no te pueden robar en compras ficticias porque no hay mas fondos, esas tarjetas virtuales se cargan por un monto y si se gasta se quedan en cero, asi no te podran robar nada, y mas tarde cuando necesites comprar otra cosa vuelves a cargar la tarjeta virtual. En cambio en una tarjeta de credito no tiene un tope o limites de gasto, es alli en que cualquier site te puede robar mas y mas.<br>  Asi que compren todas las cosas que quieran, pero compren solo lo que ustedes pueden comprar, no compren con tarjeta de credito miles de cosas, que mas tarde te pesara...<br>  Feliz A?o Nuevo!|`|506309291c193a606a058595c79e9bcaaa	es el intercambio de dinero virtual, funcionan bien si tienes fondos o deposito,,,,,|`|EWtWtSQdaa	Es una tarjeta plastica, que consigues y se te otorga, de acuerdo a tus ingresos y trabajo que efectues, ya que se te indicara el tope de gasto a efectuar.

Bw1h5xAcaa	Yes, they are trained differently and hold different levels of responsibility. <br>  <br>  LPNs function at a little higher level than a nursing assistant. They are able to do basic patient care tasks (called activities of daily living - feeding, bathing, etc.), they can perform simple assessments like vital signs, they can pass certain medications (with exceptions, like they cannot administer IV push medication or TPN and lipids), they can help contribute to a patient's plan of care by providing some education and discharge planning, they perform some basic skills like wound care and dressing changes, etc. <br>  <br>  RNs are educated at a higher standard and knows more about complex pathophysiology, anatomy & physiology, they are able to perform complex assessment of the patient and they create nursing diagnoses which directs the patient's plan of care. They also provide education and discharge planning, pass medications, perform complex skills like tracheotomy cares or chest tube drains. They are able to interpret lab results and understand what it means in relation to the patient's condition. They help coordinate the care team which includes MD, physical therapy, pharmacy, lab, diagnostics, social workers or care coordinators, dietary services, etc. RNs are able to delegate simple tasks to the assistive personnel like nursing assistants and LPNs, but always retain the full legal responsibility over their patients and could be help liable if they delegated a job to someone improperly. <br>  <br>  There is a lot more differences, but that's the basics.  There are some job settings where they use less RNs and more LPNs (like nursing homes) and the LPNs might have more autonomy and feel like they perform all the same duties as the RN - and in some cases this is true. But RNs are more extensively trained and their knowledge base is much broader.
ef652b889fbb589b6a5a57ae7d6d8afcaa	Wow... kind of vague there....<br>  <br>  Guessing your question:<br>  <br>  1.  A write down can be a negotiating approach to keeping a customer's business by re-writing the same terms and conditions of a deal but at a lower price.  This is usually done at contract end but could also be during the term of a contract if the price for termination is lower than what the customer could get otherwise.<br>  <br>  2.  A write down on a consumer side could be a similar thing in that the consumer could work with the creditor to have them reduce the balance owed or the payment for the same service.  Can't say I see this much.<br>  <br>  3.  A "wrtie down" from an accounting perspective could be a journal entry that would reduce the value of an asset.  This is typically done when there is a believe that either an asset, like the value of a piece of real estate is overstated and the company must reduce the value on their balance sheet, or in the case of accounts payable, there is a concern that a customer that owes the company may not pay.  In the case of accounts payable, this is often done by adding to something called "allowance for doubtful accounts" which is taken as a reduction against the accounts payable account effectively reducing the value of the AP account.<br>  <br>  Have no idea if that's what you're looking for but there ya go... at least I gave it a shot!  :)<br>  <br>  Cheers

I've been in the situation all my life (up until maybe the past year or two) where I've had to count every penny. At this point in my life I can afford $2 for the extra convenience, but I can't make that call for you. If you will be saving 3 hours though, that's worth at least two bucks.|`|AA11507075	Well being that your on a limited income you should just wait til morning.  two dollars is money spent on something that really does not need to be done right now.|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	Yes it's foolish, especially for that small of an amount.  If you were getting $200 out it would be worth it. <br>  If you do not have the money to buys something, then you don't need it, that's what my mom always told me.  She lived through the depression and they did without a lot.  <br>  The only one that needs to know your financial business is you.  You do what you want to with your money.

Part of the state licensure requirements are that you put in seat time in the classroom as part of your nursing program. You also have skills labs and practicums and clinical experiences at nursing homes, clinics, and hospitals. Same goes for the RN programs. If you earn an Assoc. Degree in Nursing for your RN, you can later complete a bridge to BSN program entirely online (I did), but never the initial licensure programs. <br>  <br>  Many people in nursing programs are "non-traditional students", many of us with children and families and jobs outside of school, and nursing school is a huge sacrifice and commitment. I had to put my kids in daycare (never had to do that before then) and I quit my job and lived off student loans to pay my bills. Student loans are good debt, and an investment in your future. Many schools offer some kind of child care grant for students as well - look into it. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|gxL9qeTyaa	No you can't do LPN from home.

90ccd494cd9eed1b57af7e73902496f9aa	Well, perhaps the people who sell those packages are the ones who got rich with their help. But not by using what they sell, but by selling what they sell. See, if what they sell really works, why share the secret? Just use it and become multi-zillionaire. Whenever they show that guy who makes 40K a month but used to be broke, there is always a fine print that says "Results Are not Typical, your results may vary". <br>  There are probably more people winning lottery every day, than becoming rich by using that crap. My opinion is that if want to become rich quickly, think of something very very original, if you can't than just work hard, be determined and you will be rich. You will be surprised how many quiet millionairs are there in each middle class neighborhood and no one even knows about it. By the way, those are not even the people with the collest cars.

Not from the course they purchased in most cases but from just investing in themselves.  Any secret given is often overlooked when there isn't any personal attachment to it.  I don't say that to even hint at buying any-ones course ever.  I say that because you wont try hard to learn and succeed if its handed to you.  Also many will take great advice and try to re-invent the wheel if its not an earned lesson.  As courses go, not a single one will work in a market dynamic it wasn't designed for.  Infomercials are designed to sell hope to desperate people but sometimes that one in a million person becomes pro-active and finds the right situation and makes some easy money.  Most of the talent that seemingly lucky person used was already in him / her.  The course only sparked the proper fire in them to make success their goal.  Lastly, no infomercial will admit this but most people shouldnt buy any course because they will never succeed no matter how insightful the course is.  That is why they are just the desperate sort those ads are designed to lure in before they max out their mastercard.|`|695d2ffb7e277c2d0d9c42e1f483ac28aa	No, but I'm making some money on Prosper.com.

9wrMpXRyaa	Most of the time the owners are the stock holders which many of the majority owners of those stocks are on the board of directors and CEO.  That is not always true.<br>  <br>  That information can be found through the statement that is sent to every stock holder and I also believe available at many stock offices and possibly online.<br>  <br>  The other way to get that information is to buy a few shares of stock, they then most send you the company report or some other kind of financial statement with information about major shareholders.

FNvv74UQaa	The bills would be proportionate to the house, and how hot/cold you kept it. Since you are heating/cooling more space, yes the bills would be considerably larger. Most large houses have vaulted ceilings, which are much more costly to heat/cool since the area is so large. Your electric bill would be larger, since instead of having say 16 light bulbs in the house (assuming a 3 bedroom ranch) you'd have at least double that, (assuming a 6 bedroom multi-story house). It's like if you bought a Cadillac Sedan DeVille, you'd burn more gas than a Honda Civic. The more space you have, the costlier it is to maintain climate control and lighting.  |`|AA11132354	There is MORE house to heat, more square footage involved, so it costs more.

szANztNqaa	These are open and close ended funds operated by an investment company which raises money from the public and invests in a group of assets, in accordance with a stated set of objectives. It’s a substitute for those who are unable to invest directly in equities or debt because of resource, time or knowledge constraints. Benefits include diversification and professional money management. Shares are issued and redeemed on demand, based on the fund's net asset value, which is determined at the end of each trading session. The average rate of return as a combination of all mutual funds put together is not fixed but is generally more than what earn in fixed deposits. However, each mutual fund will have its own average rate of return based on several schemes that they have floated. In the recent past, MFs have given a return of 18 – 30 %.|`|DZB0WCmmaa	funds used together with somebody else/some other country?|`|AA10426129	A mutual fund is a professionally managed type of collective investment scheme that pools money from many investors and invests it in stocks, bonds, short-term money market instruments, and/or other securities.[1] The mutual fund will have a fund manager that trades the pooled money on a regular basis. Currently, the worldwide value of all mutual funds totals more than $26 trillion.[2]<br>  <br>  Since 1940, there have been three basic types of investment companies in the United States: open-end funds, also known in the US as mutual funds; unit investment trusts (UITs); and closed-end funds. Similar funds also operate in Canada. However, in the rest of the world, mutual fund is used as a generic term for various types of collective investment vehicles, such as unit trusts, open-ended investment companies (OEICs), unitized insurance funds, and undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities (UCITS).|`|OZyb6acOaa	An investment vehicle which is comprised of a pool of funds collected from many investors for the purpose of investing in securities such as stocks, bonds, money market securities and similar assets. Mutual funds are operated by money mangers, who invest the fund's capital and attempt to produce capital gains and income for the fund's investors. A mutual fund's portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.<br>  <br>  One of the main advantages of a mutual fund is that it gives small investors access to a well-diversified portfolio of equities, bonds and other securities, which would be quite difficult (if not impossible) to create with a small amount of capital. Each shareholder participates proportionally in the gain or loss of the fund. Mutual fund units, or shares, are issued and can typically be purchased or redeemed as needed at the current net asset value per share (NAVPS).|`|2dnowT8Iaa	An open-ended fund operated by an investment company which raises money from shareholders and invests in a group of assets, in accordance with a stated set of objectives. mutual funds raise money by selling shares of the fund to the public, much like any other type of company can sell stock in itself to the public. Mutual funds then take the money they receive from the sale of their shares (along with any money made from previous investments) and use it to purchase various investment vehicles, such as stocks, bonds and money market instruments. In return for the money they give to the fund when purchasing shares, shareholders receive an equity position in the fund and, in effect, in each of its underlying securities. For most mutual funds, shareholders are free to sell their shares at any time, although the price of a share in a mutual fund will fluctuate daily, depending upon the performance of the securities held by the fund. Benefits of mutual funds include diversification and professional money management. Mutual funds offer choice, liquidity, and convenience, but charge fees and often require a minimum investment. A closed-end fund is often incorrectly referred to as a mutual fund, but is actually an investment trust. There are many types of mutual funds, including aggressive growth fund, asset allocation fund, balanced fund, blend fund, bond fund, capital appreciation fund, clone fund, closed fund, crossover fund, equity fund, fund of funds, global fund, growth fund, growth and income fund, hedge fund, income fund, index fund, international fund, money market fund, municipal bond fund, prime rate fund, regional fund, sector fund, specialty fund, stock fund, and tax-free bond fund.|`|AA10534372	ya! thats when you and your friends have mutual fun!

qBCGH52haa	Yes, you can do that and no it won't hurt your score (in fact, if you play it right, it might help your score).<br>  <br>  However, you have to be careful and check your interest rates - most cards charge a 3% fee to transfer balances, so you have to make sure you are actually saving money.<br>  <br>  Second, after a few of these transfers, you probably won't get any more offers.  Credit card companies are wising up to the card hopping and are now denying or even not soliciting card hoppers.|`|HeFlBmGSaa	Judy doesn't know what she is talking about. Nothing about balance transfers goes on your credit report and it is not looked at as derogatory in any way. One of the factors the credit bureaus look at is the total credit used divided by the credit available. Transferring credit to another card does nothing to affect that ratio.<br>  <br>  You are not cheating the system because it is likely that each time you do a balance transfer they are charging you a fee for doing so. It's rare to get a 0%, no fee, balance transfer unless you have superb credit.|`|0yqQg9CXaa	The words balance transwer will show up on your credit report.<br>  I am pretty sure this goes into the fico calculation as derogatorry.<br>  <br>  The only way to get top 800+ scores is to pay off a credit card in full each month, and never pay a penny interest - there is just no other way.<br>  /|`|ebuxHnScaa	You can do that for awhile. But eventually you won't be able to find another offer that's quite so good. You'll have the headache of moving balances every six months.<br>  <br>  Just watch out for odd fees. And when the ball does drop, make sure you aren't stuck in a high-interest card.<br>  <br>  And, of course, remember that if you use any of your credit, all your payments will go to the new charges. At the end of the introductory period, you'll wind up with, say, $5,000 in high-interest cash advance/transfer and $3,000 in low-interest purchases. You won't be able to pay off any of the high-interest debt until you pay off all the low-interest debt.<br>  <br>  So if your discipline is not perfect, you will pay a hefty price.

xwPI2e9raa	Ok this is going to be a little long<br>  <br>  I work in the merchant services field and I will try to point you in the right direction. First and foremost you have to understand how credit cards work. There are 3 main players. One being the company that you purchase from, since this is a gambling website I can tell you right away this is a waste of time. All these companies are based out of the country and are not subject US law. Second is the merchant processing company. This are the people that actually handle the transactions. Once again since the site is a gambling site I am positive they are with a high risk provider based out side the US.No real recourse there. The last is the issuing bank, this is the bank that actually issued the card. There is a pretty good chance they are US based and you best bet. Now to give you a little understanding on how all this works in the simplest way possible.<br>  <br>  When you son went online and went to the site he entered the CC info. That info is then sent from the website to the processing company. The processing company then sends the info to the issuing bank(your CC company). The issuing bank then check the MCC code and verifies the funds are available. If the funds are available they send the funds back to the processing company, which in turn send the funds back to the website owner. That being said, what is a MCC code.<br>  <br>   When a merchant processing company sets up a client (in this case the gambling site) they have to disclose what type of business they are. This is done by a MCC code. There is an MCC code for every type of business. This code tells the issuing bank what type of company is trying to get funds. <br>  <br>  Now to things could have happened. 1 the processing company lied and gave them a different MCC code which is possible but not likely. The other is the bank new about it and let it go through anyway. <br>  <br>  Now after all that here is your answer. Based on the The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 a cc company is not violating US law. The law states it is illegal to receive funds not send funds. So based on this law the only person that is liable is the website. However the law was changed again in 2007. Now i am not a lawyer but in<br>  <br>   Section 5364 mandates that the Federal Reserve Board and the Secretary of the Treasury issue "appropriate" regulations designed to identify and block the transfer of funds to the online gambling operators from U.S. financial institutions.  The regulators are given nine months to put these regulations in place.  Once the regulations are issued U.S. financial institutions will be required to comply with them.<br>  <br>  Now hear is where it get really tricky. Within the last month or so there is a lot of talk about having this billed removed . The president and so other people are stating this bill is hurting our relationship with Europe and want to ax it.<br>  <br>  So after all this I would recommend this. First read up on the law and understand it for yourself also contact your CC company and ask them to send you a copy of the terms and agreement of the card(DO NOT MENTION ANYTHING TO THEM ABOUT THIS YET). Find out what website he was on and do a quick search of who they are. May give you a little insight on where they are. Then see if you can find out any if on your cc statement, as far as where you funds went, if there is a phone number of the company, or anything else. You might get lucky and find out the bank the money was sent to is in the US but I doubt it. Next I would call your CC company and put a claim. Be careful how you word this claim. I would not state this is fraud. I would simply claim that you do not recall making these transactions. The good thing is that since most of these companies are outside the country it is harder for the bank to verify the funds. I will not boar you with the details and how this works but it is you best bet. If after that they still want you to pay I would call up the bank and state you found out this was done on a gambling website and you want to know why they allowed the transaction and maybe get in touch with a supervisor and state some case law. If all else fails contact a lawyer and just simple ask I believe I have case against my bank. They more than likely will tell you yes or no.<br>  <br>  One last item I do agree with the previous answer that you son has to own up. However I don't believe you should be liable for his mistakes. Try to get this fixed and the remove the charges but regardless of the outcome I still would make him pay for the bill.  Hope this helps|`|DCixOqsnaa	This is a tough one. The credit card company probably would have no idea that what is being charged to them is illegal. I am also not so sure how illegal these charges are if your son authorized them to be placed on the card, no matter what they are for. Its certainly worth a phone call to the bank card issuer, but I would not count on them just waiving these charges.  I understand you may be frustrated, but it sounds like your son is the one who may need to man up here and get on a repayment plan with his father instead of trying to stick it to a credit card company which in turn sticks it to the next bailout.

dh8QUfywaa	If you are being evicted, just go and don't fight it.  You have already said you weren't paying rent.  Unless you have a written agreement stating you are exchanging work on the property and improvements for rent, there's nothing to fight.<br>  <br>  A resident cannot just decide, to paint walls, change out appliances, clean things ect. in exchange for rent and then not pay.<br>  <br>  The relationship has already gone bad if you are being evicted.  Leave and make it easy before you completely trash your credit and reputation, which would destroy any chance of you getting into another place.  The bigger question you need to answer and where you need to be focusing 100% of your energy is why can't you pay rent?  Do you have too much debt? Where is your money going?  What are your living habits?  Do you have a budget? <br>  <br>  Rarely does any tenant in your situation do enough work around the property to equal 1 months rent.  Think about it.  Usually the cost of 1 months rent is 1/2 of your paycheck if you are working full time (I'm speaking to the lower middle class here so if this isn't you, move along)  It's unlikely you are working both a full time job and then coming home to your apartment and working another 20 to 30 hours a week in exchange for rent and that's exactly what you'd have to be doing.  If you're making improvements that are unauthorized, that was your decision.  If you are doing work that he asked you to do, then you better have receipts to prove you've spent the money and a log of hours spent working on those projects.

It's still in the works.<br>  <br>  If you're in the United States...<br>  a) Do research. Make sure that the business that you're wanting to start up fits the demigraphic that you want to sell to. Aka...don't open a cheap jewelry store in a rich-person neighborhood.<br>  <br>  b) Get yourself a D.B.A. (Doing Business As...) license from your local county - should be about $15. (Don't quote me on that because it varies from county to county).<br>  <br>  c) Go to your I.R.S. office and apply for a Business Tax ID Number. When you file taxes for your business, they use this number to identify it.<br>  <br>  d) Put together a Business Plan. This is a statement of what your business represents, what it's suppose to do and how you plan to manage the finances. There are examples on the government small business web sites. This plan usually covers the first two years of your business history. (Aka...how well is it going to do when it starts up).<br>  <br>  e) Take the Business Plan to which ever bank you think you would be happy doing business with. (Aka...seems recently there's a Economic Crisis going on and the banks don't seem so trust-worthy). <br>  <br>  When you present your idea for your business to the bank, they are going to want to see what you're projected future income will be and how soon they should be expecting a return on their loan. If the business fails, they are going to want to know what kind of assets there are going to be to sell off so they can recover as much of their loss as possible. So, the more you're able to do on your own without depending upon asking them for money, the better your chances are of getting that load. <br>  <br>  <br>  For example...<br>  I have my own home-based business. I'm creating my own online video game company. But, because it'll take time to actually start making money from it, I keep a regular job so as I have an out side income.

Your Landlord is being unreasonable...your neighbour is the one at fault, not you.  I would file a report with the police if i were you - this neighbour has threatened you ! Why should you move?? neighbour is the one causing the problem - check your lease, then write to the landlord and say that your enjoyment of the property is being interfered with therefore you are entitled to withhold your rent until they deal with the problem - is there any other tenant who could back you up? keep making a  fuss with the landlord, they'll eventually have to do something and you are not in the wrong so don't even think about leaving - why should you? good Luck.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	you need to make a choice...either report the neighbor to the police and make a paper trail so that you can fight back or leave and eat the deposit and the rest of the lease term (or maybe you can cut a deal with the landlord...understand that he's not obligated to deal at all).  i think that you're right to stay away from subletting.  the fact that you're still on the lease would make me very nervous and if something happens, the landlord comes after you, and it's your responsibility to come after your subletter.  that can be a huge nightmare.

It is just like a recurring deposit with the post office or bank where you put in a small amount every month. The difference here is that the amount is invested in a mutual fund.<br>  <br>  SIP is provided by Mutual Funds to ensure that the investment goal is reached, and thus to compensate for a potential deficit if the systematic investment plan is interrupted due to premature death. It is a service option that allows investors to buy mutual fund shares on a regular schedule, usually through bank account deductions. Th nomenclature of this mode of investment can be different with some mutual fund houses; for example Reliance Mutual Fund calls it Recurring Investment Plan<br>  <br>  Please be clear that a systematic investment plan is not a tool that helps improve your investment returns. <br>  <br>  For more information please visit : <a href="http://www.sharemarketbasics.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sharemarketbasics.com</a>|`|ZNI3LmBRaa	You're smart and sound like you are thinking ahead!  Looking at potential failures or companies that are doing badly - then investing is a gamble but a gamble that can make money.  This is how the big time traders make millions.<br>  <br>  You only invest enough that you are prepared to lose.  Share dealing on a small scale is a long term commitment, but one that can pay off.<br>  <br>  A good way to start in learning trading is make it up. buy a decent paper and have a look for companies that are about to announce their results.  Predict if they are about to do well or announce a loss.  Then put a made up amount of money on them (make believe only).  When they announce their results have a look at the rise or fall of the share price and see how much you have made.  You may find that companies that have made money actually see their share price fall.<br>  <br>  When you do it for real you can buy shares at most high street banks.

To me a refinance makes no sense in your case as you are now getting into the heart of your principal reduction stage of your original loan.  Have a few bids performed by competent well referred contractors for labor, permits, and materials to cover your entire wish list of upgrading for your home.  You can scale back the the project to just the main items should costs become above your desired range.  Once you know what you will need I would say obtain an equity line of credit.  Do not get a second mortgage / home equity loan.  Your local bank or credit union should have a excellent one available but they might attempt to get you to do a 2nd.  Refuse that and go with the line of credit.  No title work, appraisal, or escrow work and you can use it again later on for phase 2 of your project without re-applying.

52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	A 2 / 28 Mortgage is a hybrid type loan that has a fixed then adjustable feature built in.  It essentially is a 30 year loan that will be fixed for 2 years then become an adjustable rate loan for the remaining 28.  Some of these aren't as bad as most, but the caps, and indexes used are what have the most danger.  Often one will use one of these to buy time to fix their credit over the 2 year fixed term. When they have a better credit profile and just as the 28 adjustable term is about to kick in they will refinance.  Others will use these, or 3 / 27 loans, for a low initial rate and sell before the adjustable term kicks in.  It is typical for these loans to have a hard prepay during the fixed portion of their term.  When used as a tool these loans do serve a good purpose in many situations.  Sadly most of these loans are just pushed by greedy loan reps to create another see ya in several years client.|`|AA10074148	A 2/28 mortgage is normally what is considered an Alt "A" product and is for individuals that need a little time to get on their feet and correct credit problems. There is another product called a 3/27.<br>  <br>  This is a 30 year mortgage in both cases they number in front indicates the number of years the mortgage is fixed. You can keep this loan it will simply adjust. After all it is a 30 year loan.<br>  <br>  Yes they are good for what they are designed for and that is buy time until you are in a better position to get a better loan.<br>  <br>  Normally a month or so before the fixed rate is over you should refinance into a better mortgage and get a better rate.<br>  <br>  If you have paid your bills on time especially your mortgage you will not have a difficult problem refinancing to a new and better rate.<br>  <br>  I hope this is the case.  You should contact the mortgage broker that got you the loan or another to do your refinance. It will cost you to refinance, but the monthly savings might be a benefit and make the refinance worth it.<br>  <br>  Normally all cost to include fees and points are a tax deductable item on your federal income tax. Please check with your tax prreparer for all tax information.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|AA10491538	They are more common for difficult borrowers.. fixed rate for 2 years and then it becomes adjustable.  Can be a dangerous loan if you barely qualify.|`|747dce855cb3ea1245ba8372dfedaf78aa	A 2/28 is basically a 2 year ARM (adjustable rate mortgage).  The rate is fixed for 2 years and then it adjusts every year thereafter. The loan payments are amortized over 30 years. Sub-prime lenders offer these loans to borrowers with credit issues. It's often referred to as a "credit repair loan" or a "Band-Aid loan."

p3dK33Ncaa	Krissy, I checked out their web page, and I don't think they're asking for a cover letter in the space you mentioned.  <br>  <br>  On the application page, there is a box under "qualifications" that asks for "Letter of Interest (2000 character limit)."<br>  <br>  This is what you're talking about, right?<br>  <br>  If you notice, just under that box there is a section titled, "Resume" and a notation saying, "Please upload your resume as a Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat PDF document."<br>  <br>  If it were me, I would include my cover letter with my resume.  (And these will probably be your most important documents - the ones you really want to "polish" and make sure you're using correct grammar, etc.)<br>  <br>  I THINK that in the box labelled "Qualifications/Letter of interest" they're just asking in general what you're interested in doing, and what makes you think you're capable of doing it for them.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I would probably type in something like, "I am very interested in working in your store in Pleasantville, USA as a floor sales person.  I have floor sales experience at J.C. Penny and Norstroms, and can provide references to demonstrate that I am an enthusiastic employee.  Please see my attached resume for full details."<br>  <br>  Since 2,000 characters isn't really a lot of words, I am guessing they're using this little introduction to "sort" you, so to speak. Just make sure you are clear and articulate, and spell everything correctly.<br>  <br>  If you want to get information directly from American Apparel in regard to the application, you might try a few of the phone numbers on their contact page, and see if someone can help you get more information:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.americanapparel.net/contact/" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanapparel.net/contact/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck landing the job!

bcb1e0ec4df74fd39fba6186965b44c0aa	My suggestion would be to contact the local, small bank in your area first....not sure how you are going to pay 75% of appraised value, if you can, great!  You cannot go to closing with no docs.  If you buy the new home, you probably have to have the old one paid off, otherwise you can't get a loan.  The only way you can do a heloc is if there is enough equity in the home to support that, if you are only paying 75% & if the appraisal is 25% higher than that, & if your income supports it, it shouldn't be a problem.  Just watch your interest rates & closing costs!  Good luck!|`|52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	Your likely hurdle to overcome will be that of the underwriters using purchase price or appraisal value, whichever is lower to establish the loan to value.  The no doc refers to your personal qualifying info, not the transaction value.|`|7225e916c6e8237e8e2fba346394640eaa	I know a loan officer who can help you.  Email me for more info or fill out the form at:|`|747dce855cb3ea1245ba8372dfedaf78aa	For the purchase of the new home, technically you would not be getting 80% financing. Mortgage lenders lend money based on the LESSOR of the appraised value or contract purchase price. Therefore, you would be getting 100% financing for the loan, even if you truly have an instant 20% equity position in the home. The reason this is important is because the rates on 100% financing are slightly higher than on loans where you make a true down payment.   <br>  <br>  Another important point, if your plan is to buy your new home while still owning your current home, if there is a mortgage payment on your current home you will need to be able to carry two mortgage payments for loan qualification purposes.
AA10298502	Maybe they just don't have your incredible sense of right and wrong.|`|b22faa3abff5e7a246b2702086fea238aa	The first thing you have to undersatand is that people are motivated for different reasons and there are 3 types of people. There are people that  make things happen ,then there are people that don't there are people that don't do anything and just watch things happen.<br>  <br>  I would recomend focusing on who you think are the most posative self motivated people. You need to understand what makes them tick. There is a difference between motivation (requires effort) and inspiration (natural attraction). Why are they INSPIRED to do this system? Its not just money. Ask what they want to use the money for. Keep asking why unil you reach the real reason why they are motivated. <br>  <br>  You really have to care about the other people first. Even if you think you are putting on a show, people will see right through you if you are superficial on the surface. <br>  <br>  Once you realize what motivates your top 5 people then invest your time to reach their goals. In doing so, you will gwt what you want. Its like what your parents told you when you grew up. If you want love, give love first. If you want respect, give respect first. If you want money, give others money first though helping them.<br>  <br>  If you spread yourself out maxing out youself trying to do all the leg work it will stress you out. Instead, leverage your efforts through focusing on helping your top people. Its great you can produce so much and stay self motivated, however think how much better it could be if you spend your time helping your top 5 people get just 20 people a day. Thats 100 a day instead of depending on your own personal results. <br>  <br>  In short...you are dealing with relationships and you get out what you put in. Be real with yourself and others. Don't give up and understand that it takes time for the numbers to shake out for your benefit...just don't give up!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps & Best Wishes!<br>  <br>  PS- here are some INSPIRATIONAL people to check out.<br>  <br>  www.richdad.com  ~~~~> (Robert Kiyosaki)<br>  www.drwaynedyer.com ~~~~> (Dr. Wayne Dyer)<br>  www.briantracy.com ~~~~~> (Brian Tracy)
AA10567299	If you want money then ask for it. As for the divorce settlement ask your attorney before you sign ANYTHING.|`|5bc502dd1d4ad09ec078fddc0258caf3aa	You dont have to sign anything if you dont want to.|`|52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	Don't sign it until you are granted the funds due you from your share of the marital assets awarded you in your final divorce decree.  While your divorce may stipulate you are entitled to 1/2 of the equity growth in the home from marriage till dissolution granting a quit claim can remove your leverage of receiving them.  If he is sale pending on the property escrow will require your signature.  Before signing there make sure your attorney has filed a lien for you on title.  Until such time don't sign away your collateral, an appraisal can be done if the property is not sale pending.  Your granted portion of the equity can then be made a lien on title so even should he refinance you must be paid by escrow.  A lien on title can only protect you to a certain extent however so still you will not want to quit claim until you are paid in full with cash in hand.  Your attorney will know this and should advise you the same.  This happens often and sadly it adds yet one more bad memory to a hurtful ending.  Often the party keeping the house refinances it to buy out the other party's interest.  Should you quit claim your security in the property before getting your share, and then he loses it to foreclosure or sells it, you can lose also, especially if you don't have that lien recorded on title.|`|7e61f9de9324be846b5aa61b9b1952c8aa	No he would not need you to sign anything if you had signed it over in the papers.....sounds like he is trying to pull a fast one on you.......don't you just love it when people think we are to naive to know what they are trying to do......|`|AA10176456	Hold out for money.|`|cad56fe7012d3f93d1b2133fe73da52daa	Who gets the house and under what terms must have been spelled out in your divorce.  Unless it says you get something, too bad for you.  <br>  <br>  Just sign it and get on with your life.<br>  <br>  Realistically, if the divorce says he gets the house, and you don't get any money for it, he could just record the divorce decree and cut you out entirely.  Most divorce decrees have enough language in them to cover these things without deeds.  Deeds just make sure that every detail of your divorce doesn't have to show up in the county public records, which might be embarassing to some people.
52526b559c45eb57204a29b41ddd8553aa	Why do an interest only at a 1/8th higher rate  the difference in rate is virtually the same as the principal portion in the fixed.  Go fixed and get some equity buydown.  You will as time goes on be buying down the principal and not playing into the banks hands.  For a lower yet payment some lenders for no extra rate hit can go 40 year on the amortization.  Heres the numbers<br>  30 Fixed @ 6%  $749.40<br>  40 Fixed due in 30 @ 6%  $ 687.80<br>  <br>  30 Fixed @ 6.125% $759.50    Interest only $ 638.02<br>  <br>  Lets say you make payments for 5 years and then sell, with an interest only loan you will still owe $125,000  and will have made $38,281.20 in payments that had no buydown performance.  Essentially you are paying $7,656 and some change per year for the priveledge of both a higher interest rate and a fatter banker.<br>  If your market appreciates at say 7% per year your house will be worth about $175,319 in 60 months.  Less typical resale costs of usually 9% ( title, escrow, and real estate brokerage @6% ) =$159,540  Less mortgage payoff = 34,540   As you can see there is a reason why interest only loans are being pushed by banks.  True they can lower the payment a slight but they are a total windfall for the lender.|`|AA12116594	what are your long term plans?

You might have to raise money to sell your house.<br>  <br>  On the second deal.  the interest rate is lower for the life of the mortgage.<br>  <br>  With the interest only loan, you do not pay down the principal during the interest only period -  usually ten years. Your payments are lower during this time, the only plus.<br>  <br>  At that point your loan is recalulated with a 20 year amotization schedule which would cause your payments to jump.<br>  <br>  This only makes sense if you can invest the difference in payments during the interest only period and receive an after tax return in excess of 6.125%.

4243b5062f48702cd1446c044623b740aa	It depends on where the condo is in California, when the condo was built, how well it is insulated, what utility company you have and what utilities you are talking about. Utility rates vary widely. As do the definitions of what constitutes "utilities". <br>  <br>  Assuming you are only talking about heating your condo and powering your appliances, and not about the cable, telephone, water or garbage, it will also depend on whether your condo has electric heat or gas heat. Gas is usually cheaper.<br>  <br>  For those living in the Sierra's the winter utility rates can be high due to the need to heat a home where winter temperatures are often 20 to 30 degrees, but summer rates in such areas may be low. For those living in the Central Valley or Southern California the winter rates may be less, but the air conditioning in the summer makes up for it. <br>  <br>  If you are thinking about southern california you might want to check rates at Con-Edison, (however I think San Diego has a different company). If you are thinking about Northern California you might check rates at Pacific Gas and Electric.
