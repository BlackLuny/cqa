20090204233027AA95RD6	Education & Reference;Teaching	Is this a reasonable way to teach a class?	Okay, so my science class is a big class room, but we are sqished to one side. We have nine tables with 7 or 8 kids on each, making it at least a class of 60 kids. Sure, there are two teachers, but they don't both teach, only one does.      In our tables we rotate every half hour on what we are doing.      Now, that sounds reasonable, BUT THET TEACHERS DON'T TEACH! They set us book work on rubbish stuff then expect us to learn.      60 kids, one teacher, kids spead all over the class room.      I think it's terrible, I mean we cant copy notes from the board or anythign cos the class is too big to teach normally.      I would like to move from the toip science with 60 kids, to the top science of 30 kids. Would it be reasonable to ask the head of department to make that timetable change so I can learn better?

Capacity 100t/hr, temp 520c, water tube bi-drum.    As  per vendor data boiler will trip on drum level low low.   At normal operating condition, it will take three minutes from normal drum level to extra low low level as per vendor data sheet for tripping the boiler.   As per my understanding, It seems ok because that holding time to trip boiler on drum level low low depends on many factor like circulation ratio, evaporation rate, heat flux generation etc. but some of my friends are in under such impression that it is too late for trip the boiler and there is international standard time is maximum 90 second for any boiler to trip on drum level low low.    Is it true?  Please give your valuable feedback for mentioned query.     Thanks   Anvar shaikh

This is taken from Act III, scene 3, lines 29-51 of Romeo and Juliet      'Ti's torture and not mercy. Heaven is here,   Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog   And little mouse, every unworthy thing,   Live here in heaven and may look on her;   But Romeo may not. More validity.   More honer able state, more courtship lives   in carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize    on the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand    And steal immortal blessings from her lips,   Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,   Still blush, as thinking their own kisses a sin;   But Romeo may not, he is banished.   Flies may do this but i from this must fly;   They are freemen, but i am banished.   And sayest though yet that exile is not death?   Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife,   No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,    But "banished" to kill me- "banished"?   O friar, the damned use that word in hell;   Howling attends it! How hast thou the heart,   Being a divine, ghostly confessor,   A sin-absolver, and my friend professed,   To mangle me with that word "banished"?

I would like to go somewhere with a really good reputation and offers good degrees for those interested in wildlife and countryside.       I'm looking for a course which is highly practical based and very hands on. Ideally the institution should be within countryside with lots of wildlife. I currently live in Suffolk and do not want to move to far away from home but if the institution is very good then I would happily. As I said I have just finished a national diploma in animal care and received DDD grades, but I don't know whether I should go straight into a degree or start with some sort of foundation course such as another national diploma.       I know that I have asked for a lot of specific requirements here but I am at a bit of a loose end at the moment. I have already gone to Essex university to do a degree in marine biology and found that it was too academic and theory based and left after 8 weeks.

20090205074802AAoGH76	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Help needed with paragraphs?	Could anyone give me help on where to start new paragraphs in this piece of text         The phone rings. It’s an internal call. That means only one thing. My boss wants to see me. Begrudgingly, I pick up the receiver. A deep booming voice appears on the other end. “Nick, can you come in to my office now.” My reply was short. “Yes Mr Fitzgerald, right away.” Now I understood why I hated this little swine. He had no people skills whatsoever. His mannerisms annoyed not just me, but everyone in the building. He was the ultimate anti–Christ. Anyone who considers George Steinbrenner to be their hero can’t be too good on issues of fairness. Sadly for me, he was the only person, who could authorise my salary every month, so I guess, as much as it pains me to do so, I have to bow down to him.  Like a sloth, I approach his office, tap-tap-tap on the door and wait for the beckoning call. For what feels like an eternity passes by, and still I wait. Come in Nick. As I’m invited to sit down, Fitzgerald sits opposite me. Sweat lines his brow. Usually, that either means that his bosses have been busting his chops about company performance, or he’s been entertaining his bit on the side in the office. On this occasion, it’s the first reason. “I won’t lie to you, productivity from the people in this building is at an all-time low,” he states, but in such a manner as to try and make me think that it’s all my fault. “As team leader I want you to carry out appraisals on everyone in this workforce, and then report back to me with your findings, so that we can root out the under-performers. If necessary, I will make job cuts to damn sure that I don’t have to endure another meeting with those up above like I’ve had today.” He never spoke of them in name, even thought one of them was his own grandfather. I didn’t like where the discussion was heading. He wanted me to rat on my friends, if they weren’t doing a good enough job. I didn’t show my displeasure, so as not to show signs of weakness. Although in my mind, I was stabbing my mental voodoo doll of my boss like there was no tomorrow. Fitzgerald and Harper was the third largest advertising firm in the Tri-State area. However, in the aftermath on 9/11 and the recent global recession, the contracts that flew in from all over the world had begun to dry up, and the task that Fitzgerald was asking me to do was the likely starting point from which the firm would be downsizing in order to maintain profitability. Realistically, there was only three people who could be certain of keeping their job. One was Fitzgerald, who could probably only be fired if he killed good ol’ Gramps. One was Tony, the human resource manager, who was at best, an ***-kisser, and at worst, a showbiz *** kisser. His life story read like a who’s who of the New York social scene. His many appearances on Page Six of the New York Post did little to enhance his appeal among his co-workers, but much to boost his ego, and also his paycheck, as those above saw fit to reward his Lothario-esque streak with a twisted bonus scheme, whereby he was awarded an extra $1000 in his months salary for every time the firms’ name was mentioned in one of his gossip column appearances. The third bullet-proof employee was me. I envy anyone who decides to leave the firm in order to better themselves with other another company. I guess I’ve got too used to the trappings of my hefty paycheck. I know I have a crappy job but the pay affords me some of the finer things in life, like monthly dinners at the Rainbow Room and multiple nights at Broadway shows.
