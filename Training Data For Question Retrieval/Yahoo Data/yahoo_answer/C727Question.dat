20090202104523AA2gcdW	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Salad dressing with Chili and Soya sauce ?	During the summer holidays I picked up in a NT shop or something similar a salad dressing called "Curiously Hot Sauce" ( or dressing)   It was red- brown and thick-ish and contained the red chili sauce you can buy from chinese groceries, soya sauce, garlic and a few other ingredients. I kept the jar after it was finished and tried to recreate it from the ingredients label on the back.       Unfortunately I did not write it down and one day the jar was gone.   It looked like a small company, probably local and I could not find it on the internet.   However ..does someone have a recipe for a salad dressing with these ingredients? Maybe there was tomato concentrate in as well.. I am sure vinegar and sugar      Any suggestion would be appreciated.   Thank you

20070524210354AARczcm	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Anybody ever heard of this cookie?	Don't know what the name of it is, but it only takes 3 things to make it. It is some type of peanut butter cookie.      I egg   1 cup of Splenda   1 cup of peanut butter      Mix all together and put teaspoon fulls on cookie sheet, flatten just a little and bake. It don't make very many at all. Maybe a dozen or so.      Don't know how long to bake it at or how hot. I have made several batches of these for my parents and they love them. If you have ever heard of them, please tell me how long and how hot to bake them at. I know it don't seem possible that it only takes these 3 things to make these cookies, but that is it. I was first told to bake that at 400 for 45 min. but I know for a fact that is wrong. I have been trying different temps and different times, but haven't got it worked out yet. Please help me out here with this if you could. Thank you.
