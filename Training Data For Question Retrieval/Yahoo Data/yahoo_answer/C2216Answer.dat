3rgJpqjZaa	Codebreaker is good, so is Action Replay.<br>  <br>  There are 3 ways to connect your PlayStation 2:<br>  <br>  1. Direct Connection<br>  The fast and simple way to connect your PS2.<br>  <br>  Please note, you cannot connect your PC to the Internet when using a direct connection.<br>  <br>  2. Router Connection<br>  Play your PS2 online and connect your PC to the Internet at the same time.<br>  <br>  3. Internet Connection Sharing (ICS)<br>  Connect your PS2 to the Internet through your PC. ICS is ideal for USB and PCI modems and cheaper than buying a broadband router.<br>  <br>  Attention: Not all PS2s are ready to connect to the Internet. If you don't have the new slimline PS2, you will need to buy a PS2 Network Adapter. See your PS2’s documentation for more information.<br>  <br>  Although PS2s have inbuilt USB ports, USB broadband modem and routers cannot be directly connected. See connection methods below for options. <br>  <br>  Direct Connection<br>  Connection check list:<br>  <br>      * PlayStation 2<br>      * Memory Card (8Mb)<br>      * PS2 Network Adapter<br>      * PS2 Network Access Disc<br>      * Network Ethernet cable<br>      * Broadband modem with an Ethernet connection<br>  <br>  Steps:<br>  <br>     1. Turn the PS2 and broadband modem off.<br>     2. Connect the network cable to the modem’s Ethernet port and the Ethernet port on your PS2 network adapter.<br>     3. Turn the broadband modem on. Now turn on the PS2.<br>     4. Load the Network Access Disc in the PS2.<br>     5. Follow the on-screen setup instructions. Refer to the Network Access Disc manual for further support.<br>  <br>  Router Connection<br>  Connection checklist:<br>  <br>      * PlayStation 2<br>      * Memory Card (8Mb)<br>      * PS2 Network Adapter<br>      * PS2 Network Access Disc<br>      * 2 ‘straight-through’ Ethernet cables<br>      * Broadband router with 2 or more Ethernet ports<br>      * PC with a Network Interface Card (NIC)<br>  <br>  Steps:<br>  <br>     1. Turn the PS2 and broadband router off.<br>     2. Connect the first Ethernet cable to an Ethernet port on the broadband router and the Ethernet port on the PS2 Network Adapter.<br>     3. Connect the second Ethernet cable to another Ethernet port on the broadband router and the Ethernet port on your PC’s Network Interface Card (NIC).<br>     4. Turn on your router, then your PC.<br>     5. Check your PC can access the Internet - your broadband router may require a specific configuration to do this. Refer to the router’s instructions for specific support.<br>     6. Turn on your PS2 and insert the Network Access Disc.<br>     7. Follow the on-screen setup instructions. Refer to the Network Access Disc manual for further support.<br>  <br>  Internet Connection Sharing<br>  Connection checklist:<br>  <br>      * PlayStation 2<br>      * Memory Card (8Mb)<br>      * PS2 Network Adapter<br>      * PS2 Network Access Disc<br>      * A ‘straight-through’ Ethernet cable<br>      * A ‘cross-over’ Ethernet cable<br>      * Broadband modem/router<br>      * 2 spare Ethernet ports on your PC (you may need to install additional Network Interface Card/s (NIC) - if you have a USB modem you will only need 1 Ethernet port<br>      * A PC running Windows 98S, Me, 2000 Professional or XP<br>  <br>  Steps:<br>  <br>     1. Turn off all hardware (PS2, broadband modem and PC).<br>     2. If you are using an external USB modem/router make sure this is connected to your computer.<br>     3. Connect the ‘crossover’ Ethernet cable to a spare Ethernet port on your PC and the Ethernet port on the PS2 Network Adapter.<br>     4. Connect the ‘straight-through’ cable to your broadband modem/router and a spare PC Ethernet port.<br>     5. Turn on your broadband modem. Now turn on your PC.<br>     6. Setup Internet Connection Sharing in Windows to share your Internet connection with your PS2. See Windows help section for more support. You may need your Windows installation CD.<br>     7. Once Internet Connection Sharing is set up, check your PC can connect to the Internet.<br>     8. Turn on your PS2 and insert the Network Access Disc.<br>     9. Follow the on-screen setup instructions. Refer to your Network Access Disc manual if you have any problems.<br>  <br>  Please note, your PC must be turned on and connected to the Internet for the PS2 to be online. Connection speeds may also be affected by your PC.|`|ccM9uNcWaa	Like the other two posters, I would recommend playing the game without cheats.<br>  To connect to the internet, simple plug a RJ45 (Ethernet) cable into the Ethernet port on the back of the PlayStation.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|eisKFHM7aa	play the game like a smart person instead of cheating to finish the game. geez. what is the point of buying the game when you are just going to cheat your way through it?<br>   HUH?

ickyq53aaa	Most people get an R4 card, my research told me that the DS One Supercard is better, that is what I got (from dealextreme.com).  It can take an 8 gig sdhc card, which is plenty of space for movies, games, and mp3's.  I have all of those on mine.  The movies files must be .dpg, and if you download the Moonshell media player, it is better than trying to run movies with the OS.  I also have SNES, NES, and Genesis emulators on there with a bunch of games.  These cards will not work in a DSi.  If you want help getting any of the hardware or software, email me.|`|K53KZ664aa	first to get a mp3 player on your ds you need r4 (i have the mp3 on my ds)buying the dsi i will not recomend its 100 euro more havent improved graphics and you have to buy the sd card so there u go
7WNX0H7Jaa	You gotta squirt it with the water bottle before it can finish pooping. when it looks like it's gnna start pooping, grab the squirt bottle and squirt it to punish it. Eventually, it'll make its way to the toilet. If I were you, I would just follow it around with the squirt bottle all the tie until you need to feed it or make it happy again. Careful though, in the higher levels it stops using the toilet and starts pooping everywhere again. I don't know if it's cause you gotta train it again or not, but yeah. It's a pretty addicting game.

4Nbiuj6Gaa	Everything that drops from monsters, sell it. Sell the grey items to vendors, and some white items are useful and will sell at the Auction House. But some white items are useless, so you can vendor those. The greens and blues you get - sell them at the Auction House, or through the trade channel. <br>  <br>  Questing is a good way to make money. Even when you don't receive any money reward, you can always sell the item you got if it's something you can't use or you already have better of. <br>  And once you buy or receive some better gear then your current stuff, sell that soulbound gear. <br>  <br>  Professions can also make you money. Gathering (mining, herbalism and skinning) professions are great, because you don't have to spend money on new recipes, and items to create things. <br>  You can learn two professions, and the best to choose out of those gathering ones would be either skinning/mining or skinning/herbalism. Herbalism and mining give you tracking devices, and you can't have them both on, so it'd be best to have one tracking profession and skinning. As you play, you'll skin all the animal monsters as you go. Sell the items you pick up at the Auction House. <br>  <br>  Goodluck, hope i've helped!|`|nuUylWz9aa	Mining and skinning are 2 professions that can make much money.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.YehforGames.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.YehforGames.com</a><br>  Yeh! for Games, Inc. is an American company that helps you get levels and PvP gear on World of Warcraft.<br>  1.

7959WbC2aa	The problem with opening with a club is you will never know if the spades were a better fit for both hands. Suppose your partner has 5 spades to the ace, 3 hearts,4 diamonds and a club. They don't have enough strength to jump bid to 2 spades, so they bid 1 spade, now the bidding proceeds just as it did in your game, and you play at 6 clubs. However, if you open with 1 spade, your partner can now show your their strength by jumping your spade bid. Suddenly, spades becomes the better answer because you know you and your partner can remove the trump from the board which will make all 7 of your clubs and the diamond ace good. In the case of the hands you actually had, you ended up in the right place, but by bidding the spade major, you would have left the door open for a better slam if it was available.|`|RvEnbEJcaa	The problem with opening with a club is you will never know if the spades were a better fit for both hands.

82c09456498d17b7fdcbd55444c0d086aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  In Magic, whenever there is both a +1/+ and a -1/-1 counter on a creature, the counters effectively "counteract" each other and are removed, leaving your persist creature as good as new, ready to persist back again.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|8hbm4uiPaa	Yes, they cancel out, and all counters are removed.  Therefore, when your creature with persist is sent to the graveyard, it will come back again.<br>  <br>  This is a combo that some players are using to make creatures with the persist ability come back multiple times.  Most popular usage is with Kitchen Finks and Ajani Goldmane.|`|e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	Good Answer Davios,<br>  <br>  To elaborate further on that answer, anytime there is both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on any creature, persist or not, they cancel each other out.  That is a new rule that wizards put in when persist became an ability.  Now the problem with that is if the creatures are attacked to die to another creature with wither, since damage done by wither is in the form of -1/-1 counters.  Everlasting Torment is one way to deal with persist.  Creatures with persist will not come back as they will have died to having -1/-1 counters on them.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps, but Davios has it perfectly too.|`|9KeaTUh6aa	Co-opting the other responses, the rule is number 420.5n in the MTG rulebook, affectionately giving the name to 420 decks.<br>  <br>  420.5n  If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it, N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are removed from it, where N is the smaller of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on it.
AA10726404	For a 100% chance of winning you would need to cover every possible combination.  For Mega Millions that's about $175,000,000 worth of tickets.<br>  <br>  But even if you had one hundred and seventy five million dollars to spend, it would be logistically almost impossible.  You would about 10,000 staff working 40 hours a week for about seven weeks just to fill out all the tickets.<br>  <br>  Then you would probably need even more staff to drive to multiple locations and purchase all the tickets from the moment the lottery machines open until the draw.  It would be pretty hard to ensure that you were successful, because there is only a limited amount of time to buy that many tickets.<br>  <br>  Even if you were successful at winning the lottery this way, it is doubtful that the jackpot would ever be high enough to yield a positive result.<br>  <br>  The largest jackpot in the history of Mega Millions was $390m.  But the cash value of that is $223m.  The government is probably going to want a third of that in tax at the very least.  So now you are down to $155m.  Less than what you started with to the tune of $20m.<br>  <br>  Of course back in 2007 when that big jackpot happened, two people won it.  There is nothing you can do to prevent one or more other winners, which further dilutes your prize.<br>  <br>  Bottom line if anyone had the $175m plus costs that would be required to pull off a stunt like this, they wouldn't.  It's just that simple.

O4pC0aN8aa	When tescos first changed their cases to this new type, they forgot to remove all the security stuff and when we left the store the buzzers went off - However there was someone else walking out at the same time who happened to have some tagged clothing. the security took them back inside to untag their clothing, we went home assuming nothing.  <br>  <br>  When we got home, we couldn't open the case due to the new technology (The Red Tag System) and had to take it back to tescos to be opened, the tescos staff were not even aware of the new technology at the time (not good!).  They sorted the problem with no questions asked. <br>  <br>  Just take it back and they will open it for you. Hope that helps.|`|CQGDgp7Caa	one  that would be stealing from tesco  if the game is still in the  case and you did not pay for it  i'm not telling you how  get in to one :)  put i well tell you  that you need the tool the store use to open them when you pay for it !
QWHpXlNCaa	first you are supposed to send them a video. Then you get an audition. Have you done that?<br>  Oh! You have.<br>  Well, just so you know, Butlins does not actually conduct the audition.<br>  An audition at Butlins is like any other audition(s) for the category you are being auditioned for. seach the net for what to expect at auditions in your category.<br>  the same place you can send videos could give you the best answers on what to expect. email them here<br>  butlins@the-sun.co.uk
bMMZKrvDaa	In the site at the character info page it says that they're main attributes are strength and spirit so i guess u have to concentrate on strength, spirit...and also dexterity (since it increases evasion and aim...archers would need that).<br>  <br>  Sorry, but I'm actually a cleric in Fiesta so im not THAT sure about the stats for an archer but i have a feeling it's like i said but just ask the other archers and ask them just incase (thats wat I recommend u to do...and i'm sure they'll help u).<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry for not being that much of a help....(well, atleast i tried ^_^) and btw have a nice time in Fiesta Online

6N3yjlXhaa	A computerized sewing machine has the ability for you to select and save stitches - that's all.<br>  <br>  Try out the different brands and models and then pick out the one you like best.|`|PXWVGQyAaa	Many of us learned to sew long before the advent of computerized machines. You should get yourself a good sewing book with step by step instructions with pictures to refer to. Look at the public library to find one you like, then go and buy it. Bells and whistles on a machine make sewing more complicated.  Get one that has a one step buttonholer , blind hem stitch and overcasting and sews through all fabric.|`|PFo12b3vaa	I've sewn a long time and have taught beginning to advanced sewing classes. In my experience, the computerized machine makes for more professional results because when you choose a stitch, it automatically sets the most commonly used stitch length and width for you. Most will automatically lift the pressure foot when you stop sewing so that you won't be unthreading the needle all the time. When you go to look at machines, take your own fabrics to use for test sewing. And buy a machine to grew into..not grow out of!

KKX9T6LYaa	40<br>  but to get lobsters in a good and fast pace it would be about 55ish|`|xPy6ZePkaa	I would start fishing them right away and be very continues with them. The more you fish the faster you will be. This may seem a little strange, but when I was level 72 and fished lobbies it was slow at first then I started catching them really quick. Also try using a French or German world to fish since there is no so many people. And less people will give you a better chance of catching them. You may add me for any further questions! Gm Punk1|`|1T35X8dEaa	At level 40 you will fish lobsters slowly, i recommend that you start fishing lobsters at level 45, the higher your level the better it is for you to catch lobsters quickly<br>  <br>  However, if you are catching lobsters to sell, I would say start immediately, it may take a while but as you fish the lobsters your level will raise.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you start fishing lobsters at level 40 it is slow at the start but the profit you will get from fishing them will be great|`|2Qr8vcAfaa	I would never recommend doing anything with just the required levels; this goes for fishing lobsters at 40, to cutting yews at 60 - they'll always be too slow. <br>  <br>  Like others have said, it depends what you're fishing for. Do you purely want money? Or do you just want XP? Maybe it's both. <br>  <br>  If you want XP for a higher level, as well as a bit of money, then I would advise you to fly-fish and bank your fish. I managed to make around 200K doing this. Okay, it's not much - I was only going for XP though.<br>  <br>  If you want both XP and money, I'd carry on with the fly-fishing method. From what I've been told, on a F2P world, lobsters become faster around 70. By this I mean they're fast enough to make money and XP from, not just money.<br>  <br>  Even if you want just money, I'd still avoid lobsters. Not only are they too slow at your level, but the long bank trip to and from Draynor will make you want to die. I'd wait until around level 55, maybe even 60, before you start fishing lobsters for money. <br>  <br>  FYI: fishing lobsters on a members world using the fishing guild (68 fishing to enter) or even at Catherby is a lot faster.|`|CQGDgp7Caa	don't worry if they are slow catching  they are one of the best to get xps for fishing  but fly fishing all so can  get your  xps up  if your a member you can all ways use a fish potion  to help you fish .|`|eZj1qCd7aa	when you get bored|`|lL9sxKD9aa	try catching lobsters at level 50. Then catch swordfish at level 60.Best place to train on f2p is at barbarian village fishing spot but bring a fly fishing rod and plenty of feathers.Bank your fish or drop it when your inventory is full.<br>  <br>  Fly fishing: Trout=50xp<br>                   Salmon=70xp<br>  <br>  Also if you want to get your cooking up at the same time, there is a fire in barb village which never runs out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope i helped :p|`|1hWVZbu4aa	Personally, I think that you should start asap. They are kind of slow, but they are good money, or if you want to use them, then they heal a lot.|`|kvlnADyIaa	Not at 40. I started them at around 60. It's faster. Get member and go to the fishing guild. I forget what level you need to enter. I believe it's 60 something.|`|eb52e9e3421c5f9d4f83b64461d39f8baa	as soon as you can|`|aCCVrpLwaa	80|`|907355b5017f96014b50457fb1bc3407aa	i suggest lvl 45

XIJHHAAwaa	The original Blythe dolls were only made for a  few years in the 1970s. They had the cord at the back of the head that you could pull to change the eyes to three different colour. When they first came out the were not very popular and didn't really catch on. This means that these days they are hard to find and fetch huge amounts of money. I had an original (but unboxed) doll, which had some damage, but still fetched over ￡300 when I sold it through Ebay. The modern reproductions seem to be the best and more affordable option, and if you buy through Ebay and pay with Paypal, you should be able to get your money back should there be any problem. Make sure that you read the seller's feedback before bidding though, you should be able to get an accurate indication of their reliability.|`|n7rfbfGmaa	I don't collect Blythe dolls, but i collect other types of dolls like barbie, and have got many off them off Ebay.

8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	I've been through much the same experience. I use shells plus broken china in my sculptures and did use hot glue (you can get construction grade) but fell in love with Power Grab all purpose construction adhesive by LOCTITE. I find irt in the tool section in Target and in the paint/glue section in Home Depot and Lowes. Comes in a tube. You can even get it in one of those big tubes like epoxy sealer or chalk. I buy it in the smaller-like toothpaste size. Just to give you an idea-I used hard as nails on one tile mosaic-came off-I've had to repair it about 5 times! Its in a public library too-but the Loctite sculpture went to Souix Falls SD in the tornado season and has been outside in that weather for 2 years now with no problem! What a good test! Low odor too. I was very happy to find it. Get a small tube-there is a kind thats clear that looks like model glue-it works good but is a bit runny. The other has a bigger-fatter lid and is thicker-and better. It comes out white but dries clear. Good luck!<br>  A note on gorilla glue-its great and its beyond hard and holding but it actually stays that gold color and expands a bit as it dries-its wonderful to glue wood or I used it to glue metal posts for sculptures into a wood base --buy a tiny bottle and play with it-|`|pT30trt6aa	PVA glue( poly vinyl acetate) its a thick white one<br>  you get it in most Craft /stationary shops<br>  when it hardens it will get transparent<br>  so u don;t have to worry about satins or anything...<br>  <br>  oh and if u want your shells to have a glossy finish After you're done with them mix equal aprts of PVA glue and water and then brush on top of the shells|`|YUcl70rbaa	Gorilla Glue is awesome and they now have a clear one.

I use this for all of my craft projects that require a strong bond (believe me, hot glue doesn't cut it on anything heavier than ribbons).<br>  <br>  AMAZING GOOP-for about a 4 oz tube, you will only pay about $3.50.

The various GOOP adhesives are from the same company and smell less while having various flow and UV protection features - Marine stands up more than Craft and has added UV protection. <a href="http://www.eclecticproducts.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eclecticproducts.com/</a> [ <a href="http://www.amazinggoop.com/amazinggoop/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazinggoop.com/amazinggoop/i...</a> uses frames - click on Products and or Overview at left. ] They all dry clear and stay that way getting a hazy white if exposed to a lot of sun without UV protection.  E6000 is self leveling - flows to flat.   All of them are described as contact cements - if you apply them, pull the pieces apart for 20-30 seconds and put the piece back, the adhesive will grab and be hard to shift immediately, but they can be used like other glues - apply and hold.  <br>    100% Silicone Adhesive from GE or DAP stays softer than eclectics products and can be cut free with a wire or razor.<br>    Gorilla Glue is amazing but would be a bad choice - the original is brown and stays brown and stains hands although there is a clear version I saw in the store - because it foams on setting which requires moisture and is supposed to be clamped and the foam trimmed off.  It forms a plastic when set and I use it to glue wood to make waterlogged glass working tools - <a href="http://users.ticnet.com/mikefirth/glues.htm" rel="nofollow">http://users.ticnet.com/mikefirth/glues....</a>

DtkLsetkaa	If you are enjoying yourself then I wouldn't worry about it.  If anything, most games come with a free trial for live, you can try it with that (or since you just got your xbox you should have gotten a free trial with that too) but I don't happen to think its a necessity if you just like to play games and have fun :)|`|PKULDaC7aa	XBox live is pretty great. Not only for playing games against others but because there are so many things you can download. Games, tv shows, movies, demos. Then there are some games that are much better online, like Left 4 Dead. And of course if you have Netflix you can now stream movies and tv shows through your XBox at no extra charge. Its sweet.|`|LP41U9djaa	There's really no big difference with paying on Xbox live, rather than playing on a normal computer asides from the fact that you're using a controller on the Xbox and not a keyboard. You're not missing much. If anything, you're saving yourself a bit of money from paying the online fees.<br>  <br>  Anything which can be done on a Xbox, can most probably be done on a regular computer.|`|meySiWKzaa	Yes.  With Live you get the single player experience, you can talk to your friends while playing single player, and the multiplayer in some games is just amazing, extends the life of the game like, 10 times over.

qbmkMWqeaa	1st, thank your lucky stars that your husband isn't out whoring around.<br>  <br>  2nd, ask yourself, does him playing video games really bother you? If so why? Does it take time from his work? Or from you? Does he neglect you when playing?<br>  <br>  Instead of trying to cut him out of a hobby, why not join in? Maybe show some interest in something he does. Make a deal, if you show interest in gaming he has to take you out to dinner or a movie.<br>  <br>  RE Additional Info.  If that's the case, then you need to get into counseling. Addiction to games can be as harmfull as any other addiction...in this case it's ruining your marriage.   If it's as bad as you say, and he's not violent...then I'd remove the computer completely and suggest couples counseling.  If he refuses to go to counseling, you need to impress upon him the need for change. Explain to him that by his not doing anything, you already don't need him in the house and that he should find somewhere else to mooch.<br>  <br>  If he leaves, then you're better off without him. <br>  <br>  Remeber, by you  letting this go on is enabling him. If you don't change, why should he?|`|jtNIEIKiaa	you know what i'm sick and tired of people like you saying video games are no good! listen lady video games improve hand eye movements doctors even said so so my advice to you is if you don't like his hobby then get one of your own and stop trying to control what he does geez does he tell you to stop watching your shows on tv! no he doesn't  so like i said get your own hobby and leave him be.|`|iEXlaVf2aa	why not ask him to teach you how to play the game too, so you both can spend time together while he is still doing something he obviously enjoys. and playing computer/video games is really not a bad thing, he could be doing something far worse like looking at porn or going to dating sites|`|DTlFaJkaaa	Maybe you shouldn't sit on the couch watching soap operas and eating potato chips and cookies all night then he'd want to spend time with you...<br>  <br>  Other than that, download tons of gay midget porn behind his back while he's gaming, his pings will go through the roof.

NFyQWFoGaa	The Online Etymology dictionary says: <br>  "a game played with a large inflated leather ball," perhaps borrowed in part from Fr. ballon, altered (after balle) from It. pallone "large ball," from palla "ball," from Langobardic palla (from P.Gmc. *ball-, from PIE *bhel- "to blow, swell") + -one suffix indicating great size. It also meant the ball itself (1592), which was batted back and forth by means of large wooden paddles strapped to the forearms. In 17c., it also meant "a type of fireworks housed in a pasteboard ball" (1634) and "round ball used as an architectural ornament" (1656). Acquired modern meaning after Montgolfier brothers' flights, 1783. As a child's toy, it is attested from 1848; as "outline containing words in a comic engraving" it dates from 1844. The verb meaning "to swell, puff up" is attested from 1841. Trial balloon is congnate of Fr. ballon d'essai.

And also go to the bead aisle of a craft store, I suggest Michael's, and pick out the color beads you want. Try a starter kit with a nice variety. Then you can look online for instructions, samples etc. Just search 'wire bead sculptures' etc.<br>  <br>  I know too that some craft stores, again Michael's, teach classes for things like that. It is a very common crafting project, so it would be no problem at all.

For example an average lock difficulty requires 50 points to have been put in the skill.  <br>  1 - To Pick a lock you first click on the lock and you have a picture of a lock in front of you with the bobby pin.  You need to move the bobby pin with your mouse (starting at say 12'o'clock position) and then move the lock with the A,W,S,D keys.  If you have the bobby pin in the wrong position it will judder a little (or break) and you will need to try it in another position. <br>  2 - Bobby pins can be found in Vault 101 at the beginning or by exploring peoples houses, or can be bought from the traders around the wastes.<br>  3 - When you click the icon to open the game instead of pressing play press OPTIONS, there is a choice there to choose:  Low, Medium, High, Ultra  graphix options. <br>  4 - Not sure on this one, all i can tell you is at the moment i have a strength skill of 7 and that allows me to carry 220 (lbs?)

M7G3MZb5aa	Anywhere from 1 to as many as 8<br>  <br>  most casinos are packing 8 decks, usually in higher limit games you may find 6 deckers.<br>  <br>  4 deck games can be found, and so can double deck games but usually double deck games are high limit games.<br>  <br>  5 deck games exhist in rare instances, but can are plentiful in Macao<br>  <br>  I have never heard of or seen a 3 deck or 7 deck game<br>  <br>  Single deck can be found RARELY and only in high limit games.  You will frequently find "single deck blackjack" where blackjack pays 6:5 instead of 3:2 but this is hardly blackjack and the house edge is triple that of any 8 deck game.<br>  <br>  The number of decks is relatively insignificant unless you count cards, it does effect your odds a bit, but the casinos put fewer decks with higher minimums and other rules so that in general, you lose about the same amount per hour regardless fo what table you play at.|`|y822j5h5aa	Most casinos offer single deck blackjack, but with some vrey infavorable rules for the player, such as 6-5 for blackjack instead of 3-2. <br>  <br>  In a game using a shoe, typically there are 6 or 8 decks.|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	Varies by location and table.<br>  <br>  Some places you can find one deck blackjack, but the most common is probably 8 decks.|`|0wTOMifKaa	I was thinking 6+ on average.|`|U96gy1kaaa	yup 6-9 decks, and people said they did not like 69 lol

TxqjBQleaa	It's perfectly normal - there are lots of side effects when you quit smoking but they will pass eventually - and you'll feel much better overall.<br>  <br>  If you need support and advice and want to ask more questions about stopping smoking the No Smoking Day forum is fab: <a href="http://www.nosmokingday.org.uk/forum/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nosmokingday.org.uk/forum/</a><br>  <br>  Lots of people like you (and me!) who have loads of questions and want to get help without being patronised by people who've never smoked.<br>  <br>  I quit a month ago and find I'm sleeping an extra hour every night - but everyone on the fourm assures me this is normal and it will pass. I've stopped the coffee because it just kept reminding me that I wanted a cig - and have switched to herbal tea. Hated herbal tea before because it tasted of nothing - now I've quit smoking and my sense of taste is coming back I've realised they actually do have a taste - and are really nice!|`|rvjgwJwuaa	I did - its your body going through the detox symptoms I guess?<br>  <br>  It will take a week or so to pass - don't give in to temptation - goodluck!|`|fR2Geezcaa	Yes, it is your body going through withdrawal's. Don't bother doubling up on the coffee. The best is to get up and try to shake it off. It only last the first week or so. <br>  <br>  It will be worth it, don't give up!!!|`|f89f116400d4ff9b53b246c33e1753cdaa	Yes! It passes in about a week. Keep it up!

It is all straight sewing and you can make it with or without a decorative cuff. The easiest thing to do is to take one of your own pillowcases (that you know already fit your pillow) and copy it: Flip the pillowcase inside-out. Take the measurements, allowing for hems and seams that you can see on the finished pillowcase, and cut your case from that. Sewing is pretty easy: start at the top of one short side, sewing down it, across the long end and backstitch. Fold over once, about 1/4-inch, then again for the depth of your hem, and either hand stitch or machine baste (sew) in place. You may finish your open seams with a wide zigzag or pinked edges. Flip your pillowcase right side out and press. It is really easy to make 2 identical pillowcases. Choose an inexpensive printed cotton to start with, so if you make a mistake, you haven't lost much money...then embellish your future pillowcases as you like.<br>  Sewing is a wonderful hobby--with practice you will become very good at it!<br>  Good Luck!<br>  --Erik|`|0WASp0bHaa	I started my daughter off with PJ bottoms. No zippers or buttons on them. Aprons are good beginner project and you can customized them for a holiday. A robe is more involved without having any zipper or button to put in.<br>  A basic skirt is good to start you off with putting in a short zipper and doing a waist band. <br>  Look for Sewing for Dummies Simplicity patterns or any pattern that say Easy. Each pattern company has a line of beginner patterns. <br>  <br>  Look at JoAnn's ads for when they have their patterns on sale. It is a good way to pick up several for the cost of one. They have 5 for $5 sometimes.|`|AA10022225	My favorite place to get ideas and patterns is called www.youcanmakethis.com  They have all sorts of categories for children, adults and accessories!  They are e-books that come with complete step by step instructions and PICTURES!  To show you the way!  I'm totally addicted to this site and she's always adding more stuff!  If you  visit this site, I'm sure you'll find many things to add to your list! and before too long your list will be like mine-never ending - lol!<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|0W8Kcrcoaa	If you're interested in quilting, look for "rag quilt" intructions.

Being open-minded is a great help. And sometimes, or rather often times, our most relaxed time is when our brain functions best. Try taking a little break from your thoughts and enjoy a bit. Just have open eyes and an open mind. A museum is a great place for ideas, or simply ask children. They have innocent minds that may think of simple ideas but when elaborated, becomes great!

3McVU9Gjaa	Actually, you are required to kill 10 (ten) of each Leader A, and Leader B.<br>  <br>  The quest is possible to do, but it's one of the rather challenging ones. It's nearly impossible to do without pots that boost accuracy. So I suggest getting those (and you'll eventually kill the Leaders eventually), or get a high-leveled friend to do it. <br>  <br>  The second option is probably better, since you'll definitely need them to complete the follow up to this quest - killing Mushmom. Just as a reference, it took my level 55 I/L mage like a full minute to take down Mushmom, so it would be wise to ask for help.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.

pYj8KZUNaa	If you are a real hardcore RTS gamer than you should get Endwar for the voice command but Halo wars has a better gameplay value, campaign etc than endwar. it should be noted that the voice command has a problem with regional accents and it is very fiddly. perhaps it is more purist than hardcore.<br>  <br>  I'm a die hard fan of Halo wars, especially because of the Rock, paper scissors style gameplay {infantry are weak against vehicles which are weak against aircraft which are weak against infantry} provides for stimulating and challenging gameplay with tough, smart and cunning A.I<br>  <br>  But you have to play the Command and Conquer games on the 360. they are amazing. great control system which doesn't obstruct gameplay.|`|St56Pb7Paa	/* i dont know much about endwar, but for halo wars.<br>  /* long, but easy single player campaign<br>  2. halo wars has skirmish mode which you can play as the covenant<br>  3. i would think that endwar would have a longer cmapaign cause halo wars is easy.<br>  4. halo wars in my opinion.  halo is more fun.|`|1Rhfpb3Haa	Don't overlook the 'real' Real Time Strategie game that is Commander & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars and Kanes Wrath or even Red Alert 3.

QzD3rJtMaa	Well for one, Zombies, Tele-DAD, and Glads are pretty much done now.<br>  <br>  Second, there is one thing that many people keep forgetting is that the Banned list you are looking at is from the OCG, not the TCG.  The majority of the cards will be the same, but what about the TCG Exclusives.  They are not going to be on the OCG list if they are exclusive to the TCG.  So Lightsworn is not out of the woods yet, so to speak.  I've been hearing rumors that Charge of the Light Brigade might get Limited.  It won't totally cripple Lightsworn, but makes it a little more difficult to get what they want.<br>  <br>  The main decks I could see topping now are Monarchs, Twilight, and Spellcasters.  A lot of people seem to forget that this is a huge set for Spellcasters.  You have a brand new Tuner that is better than Night's End Sorcerer and you have a brand new level 9 Synchro that is freaking ridiculous.  They will even get better once the Spellcasters Judgment Structure Deck comes out with the new Field Spell and a few other new Spells that will get Spell Counters coming out of your you-know-where.  lol.<br>  <br>  Fish decks also get a slight boost now with their first ever Tuner.  It also helps that it's only the second ever 4 star Tuner.  However, you can only use him for a Synchro Summon if it is with another Fish monster.  Did I mention that he is also the strongest Tuner to ever be released at 1700 Atk.?<br>  <br>  I think the state of the game is in a great period right now, excluding all this crap between KDE and UDE.  I mean with Crimson Crisis comes the release of the Assault Mode monsters.  It'll be interesting to see how they fit into the mix.  Plus the introduction of the Black Feather/Black Wing monsters.  However, they won't really see their full potential until Raging Battle comes out in the Summer.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of things changing in Yugioh right now.  It'll be really interesting to see how things pan out in the end.|`|2ljlwK8naa	In fact, Gladiators are not really harmed a lot. Only Bestari is limited but test tiger, proving ground and many other tech cards are still there. I think that Monarchs have already been dead for some while after the realease of DAD and Judgment dragon. Although TeleDAD is dead. DAD return may still be useful and the other dark counterparts may see more play in the metagame. As a conclusion, I think that Gladiators and Lightsworns will be top at the time. Gadgets, little city and plants will still have to wait for some time, especially since Gyzarus and Judgment is just unlimited and semi-limited|`|aEcJPZKhaa	Dimension Fortress Weapon this card is going to kill lightsworn's it comes out in crimson crisis so i do not know what will be the new meta game maybe something from CRMS but i think RGBT will probally be were the new meta cards will come from. i think i will just use griger's deck know or maybe still try to use my zombies just find some subsitutes in my deck.|`|PGvjEvjMaa	monarch, lightsworn and maybe glad beast will be the top decks. zombies are ruined. teledad will see some success but obviously not as much. gadget, stun and little city will still show a good record sometimes. plants will continue to dissapoint. and finally, when the black feathers come out they too will be a force to be reckoned with|`|PzReqI4jaa	damn i havent heard of yu-gi-oh in a long time, i think its extinct.|`|QK50ERDJaa	dood. as long as they dont limite trap monsters. LIMIT EVERYTHING! lol. I hope they limit the number of stupid synchros in a side deck and the number of copies of synchro monsters. they're so patheticly weak that they arnt even worth putting in a deck. But yea. If they limite anything in my deck (mainly trap cards for my uria deck) ima go bomberman on their a$$. :P

o1G3Ktumaa	NOOO get a 360 because it has better games and it'll be a long time until sony drops the price on ps3  there is also more people playing 360 than ps3 and more online xbox 360 players.    there is not that much blu ray movies   the ps3 is nothing without the psp because the only way you can get pics, music, and videos on the ps3 the easy way is by psp    and yes the HDMI will upscale dvds|`|PlSSKLd7aa	You may think PS3's cost too much, but it's actually worth the money.  You could just buy the $300 anyways.    Gears and Fable are good games, but the XBOX can't compete with what the PS3 is coming out with this year.  Killzone, GOWIII, inFamous, MLB 09 The Show and more.    The Ps3 also has an internet browser and free online. You really can't beat it.  Also just think about it. If you get an XBOX you are going to have to pay for the extras like Live cards and to connect it online. It'll end up being the same cost as a PS3.    Choose the 360 if you want, but don't cry when you're watching video game playthroughs of GOW3 and Killzone on Youtube, and the only think your playing is another Halo game.|`|0ZV2y6eoaa	right know the ps3 is going to cost less if u are thinking of get live foe xbox      and u have to buy a separate HD DVD drive with the 360 u can only watch Standard DVDs on the xbox|`|0eX9tx8faa	well is depends what u want because the elite and pro xbox cost about the same so its your decison|`|RrQNJsVsaa	Well xBox360 is a game system that will take all of the news games that come in new releases until 2013 when the make a xBox420 which will be forever until it is gone. xBox360 also has better graphics for their games. It is the best seller. And like you said it is cheap, 200 games for it. It also takes you to xBox 360 LIVE without you having to plug it in to the computer. The games are only 18 dollars something. It is the cheapest, and best gaming thing for me. So I'd say xBox 360 is the better half PS3 is kind of like a regular xBox.|`|sYGw09Eiaa	I think PS3 a better choice thats just my opinion more features, better graphics, and a whole lot of updates which offer even more features. The only reason if I had to pick the 360 would be cause of Halo other then that I would go PS3 any day. Also I dont think it will upscale regular dvds but with Bluray dvds then yah|`|AA10178392	If you can wait, Sony will drop prices even furthur later this year.    Either way Do Not buy 360. PS3 is a much better value. It's much stronger, has much more potential and comes with Blu-Ray drive that costs you anywhere between 200-500$ if you buy a stand alone one.  Trust me, the Blu-Ray alone is worth it. Not to mention cool games coming out soon.    PS3 is much better choice.    HDMI cable alone doesn't do anything to quality. It's the source. PS3 does upscale, and some new 360 also do.    BUT, both are not very good at doing so. you probabaly won't see a big change. Stick with PS3 and watch REAL Blu-Ray 1080p
L7cvpYppaa	Ok. He has to play as his Lire.    You can tell when you can or not...    -when you register a quest and it goes into the public tab, you can use any of your characters to complete the quest.    -when two or more characters have the EXACT same quests (including quest name) ...    let's say LvL 33 quest: Stop the Calling of Ceremony 1    All you have to do is collect staffs from mages in Ellia Continent.    So if you're ronan, lire, and arme have that quest... you can use any       of the chars to get ALL of the staffs    -but the "exact quest" thing is NOT included for the quests that say "Clear Gaikoz's Castle in 15mins"   these you have to do it with that ONE character      -----  Can you giave me an example of the letters... that are next in your name._.

KWqZe31Haa	You are probably getting picked because of the difficulty. If you have it set to All-Pro or All-Madden, then the interception frequency will increase. On rookie, interceptions are rare. For safe throwing strategies, what you can do is pick plays where the targeted receiver is the Half Back. They are short, and usually he will be somewhat, if not wide open with plenty of running room ahead of him. The best of those plays would be ones where he runs down the middle and cuts outward. Then what you can do is delay your throw until he has gotten open, ran passed his defender sideways, and there is no one in his running path (leaving him open to go outward then forward). Also, if you set up a good play action, you can do serious damage. Do some running plays, and then on the first play of one of your following drives, pick a play where you play action and throw deep to your O receiver. My favorite is PA Flood, and when used appropriately I gain 20-30 yards. It just takes practice, avoid passing down the middle for now, unless its short, cause that's where the majority of INTs come from when inexperienced at passing. Play alot, you'll get the hang of it. -Fig|`|5NFaYcn5aa	try curls and out routes to get down the field      make your madden better click below    http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vie...

Once you have downloaded it go to my computer..programme files..EA games or electronc arts..the sims 2..the sims seasons..untill you see a file called TSBin..paste the file(crack) into the TSBin folder and it will ask you if you want to replace the old .exe file with the new one, say yes and viola..u should be able to play without a CD|`|F6jBrNmuaa	It woun't work.|`|KlDoKDEjaa	no you need the disk to play unless you add another expansion pack of your own then you will need that disk and i love bonvoage it is great i love going on vacation    have fun!!    hope i could help|`|zN0aeqclaa	im not sure about vacation..but try it without the disc.. if all else fails then go to the top menu, click file and then print|`|JSeRWbHzaa	buy a new game/expansion pack then lend that sims of your  friend again when it says put it in when you are installing your new game then use the new disk and give ya m8s back.      other wise no:)

AND we were BOTH damn good at our respective classes/characters by most people's standards.    there is LOADS to do in that game so no, there isnt any possibility of you getting bored with it.  there are quests, instances, holiday stuff (they decorate and have special stuff for each of the major holidays), theres all sorts of people to interact with, professions to learn, the list goes on and on and on.|`|DTlFaJkaaa	The bottom line (with any MMO) is that in order to have a successful character, you're gonna have to give up having anything resembling a life.

No chicks (who's gonna dig a zit faced overweight kid playing with a bunch of elves?), no family, no other hobbies, just dancing with your elf buddies killing piggies and orcs...  I'd rather paint my toenails hot pink and get punched in the sack.    I'd tell your friends they need to step back to reality and do something useful with their time.

However, the idea of it getting so addicting that it makes you forget you have a life and friends is your own fault.  You need to be mature enough to know when to take a break from playing.

Ignore what your friends are telling you about the game. It is a huge waste of time and money!! I wish I never got into playing world of warcraft. If your friends are getting into WoW, just wait a while and you will probably hear less and less from them. It is an extremely fun game, but in order to be good you have to put in endless amounts of hours. If you don't believe me then go a head and buy it.

9ae55890a5fcfea5236690724138dc1faa	It depends what you like. GTA 4 was a great game with loads of brilliant little details and a nice new combat system but I found it too serious and bleak San Andreas way better in terms of sheer fun. The map was massive and varied way better for police chases and you could do more crazy stuff like fly jet packs and fighter jets. There was more of everything and if you dont care about graphics I would say that San Andreas was a better game if only because of quantity as noone can argue that GTA 4 had alot of quality. They are both great games.  I'm not a big fan of Saints Row, it's too 'gangsta' which I dont like, I dont think it's as good quality wise and it is just a rip off of GTA.|`|OJ79IraJaa	San Andreas.

PY2q9pBPaa	You were probably watching some old cartoons from the 1950s, 40s or even earlier. Since a lot of homes in the early 20th century didn't have central heating (usually just a fireplace in the living room), people would keep warm when they went to bed by putting on a sleeping cap. Most body heat is lost through the top of one's head, so by by "capping" your head, you kept some heat. This is where the term "come over for a night cap" comes from.|`|qDBjH4s8aa	they're modeled after the old-fashioned sleeping caps.
zN0aeqclaa	check online im sure there is one
7xdEb0XAaa	Wal-Mart.
VmGrypxVaa	$399.99 new =] same price everywhere sorry =[
gb1BGP8xaa	Fabri-tec is a good fabric glue, but you may not have enough dowel surface for any glue to work.
Kddjmy4Aaa	It's either the Disk Is too Scratched up   or your Xbox360 Hardware.  You might have to have It Repaired.|`|gm5Sn8b2aa	dont play online
dEDio8aPaa	It depends on what kind of plastic both are made of. without knowing that, the best way to glue them no matter what materials is with some two-part epoxy. Any hardware store or home center will have that. Just follow directions on tube.
WSFJToYMaa	It's an alternate time line. Society in their world stopped in the 1950's, but their technology continued to develop along the lines that sci-fi was expect the technology to look like, with things like nuclear powered cars, robots,  and laser weapons. Some people might wonder why the computers look old fashioned and bulky, but you're got to remember that that is still future technology compared to what was around in 1950.|`|T9vf2uU7aa	It's an alternate universe, buck-o.  They intended for the series to have that look from the start.  Actually even before that, with Fargo's "Wasteland".      EDIT:  I had to come back and edit this again because, well, hasn't anyone else played the original two Fallout's?  I mean, there really is no rhyme or reason why they chose the 50's art deco style, aside from all the developers being big fans of '50s pulp magazines, science fiction and superhero comic books.  The dev's of Fallout 1 started with that palette, Black Isle carried it over to 2, and Bethesda did the same with 3.|`|fc4baf02ff9f98a7a775f05738a7b5c2aa	Oh yeah i was wondering about that too.    Like why do the cars look like they're from the 50s right??    As for the music, I'm pretty sure that's all they could find left over. All the other good music was destroyed or something but they still have like four records of old music.     But yeah i thought it would be cool to see a futuristic motorcycle or something lol|`|Esl2Ogi7aa	ive been wondering that too.i guess to give the game an interseting touch to it..... not that it needs it. its an awesome game|`|gGdu90r7aa	The reason they have all the older things in the game is to make it look more interesting and make you think. If You noticed the ad in the beginning when it is loading when you go someplace there is a little girl on a mechanical horse and that is based on the future.

jprAxFILaa	Look down over the right side and you will see either a arrow or a couple of icon. Look for the IMVU icon and right click it and close it. Then it will let you unstall IMVU, just unstall it.

Lm4VZUtcaa	I had the exact same problem. You cant put it in the jar, there is a rock on the south of the island where you can make a water storage thing (made of coconuts I think) and dip that in the stream / sea.    Pleased to be of service!

VmGrypxVaa	Just buy one, there only 15 dollars in the U.S.
IpwsYe2kaa	There's one that alot of countries play where you get one of the big old fashioned wooden tops that has the metal spike coming out of the bottom and you wing them up and draw a circle on the ground and you toss the tops in to spin the other tops out of the circle. My bf is from Peru and they play it there too I belive but also in Chile          This is the best link i could find on it.  http://www.joeskitchen.com/chile/culture...|`|VmGrypxVaa	Soccer, its very popular there as well as most of the world.
