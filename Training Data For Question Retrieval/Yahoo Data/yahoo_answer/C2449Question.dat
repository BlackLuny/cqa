20090223160413AAxueaH	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Which books would be good for me?	I'm looking for some books to read. I'm not really sure what genre I like yet but I think I lean a little toward sci-fi. Books that I LOVE are One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Jurrassic Park, Slaughterhouse Five, Dracula, and The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants Books. I really love learning about religion and world travel if that helps at all...thanks!
20090223160802AAEf7qX	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Whats your color life like?	Your Open QuestionShow me another ?    Would you like to know the answer to the afeect color has on your life?   Before you start you will need 1. pencil , 2. paper   Do you consider your self moody?   Do you place your self as an outcast?   Do you consider yourself with dignity?   Do you like perfection?   Do you consider your self innocent?   Do you have strong morals?   Are you quick to judge someone?   Are you passionate about life and aspirations?   Do you lose your temper over small things?   Do you have a sense of humor?   Do you think of your self as brave or cowardly person when put in the position of danger?   Are you easily unsettled?   Do you like being outside more than being inside?   Do you consider your self social in the community?   Are you patient and modest?   Are you compassionate and caring?   Would you rather be in a quiet setting or a social setting?   Are you shy?   Do you like to feel glamorous?   Is being unique important to you?   Do you have a need for the "finer" things in life, or are you thrifty?   Please tell me your top two favorite colors and the interest and hobbies you participate in.      Thank you!      This is research I and my fellow class mates are conductin gin order to find out if the color one is most likely atracted to has something to do with a stereotypical way of life.       After all research is conducted results will be calculated and I will then truthfully be able to tell you if green lovers like myself are into nature, if purple lovers are lavish and if the rest proves the things Sociologist before me and other elite Phsycoloigist have already configured.

20090223161142AAbqEF7	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	How do you like my story?	It's told from a guy's perspective. I don't know where to go with it.       The dream is always the same.       She is standing on a cliff overlooking the ocean. The sky is overcast, the water dark and angry. The wind buffets her thin form, but she is indifferent to it. She stands tall, confident, barefoot. Her dress, a pale yellow silk, billows out behind her. I have never seen her before, and yet she is familiar. I stand behind her, silent, observing. Just when I am convinced she hasn’t seen me, she speaks.   “It’s beautiful, isn’t it?” I open my mouth to reply, but suddenly she is growing further and further away and blackness is closing in on me. That is how it ends, every time.       But not this time. This time, it’s different.    Her name is Louise.       This time, she is standing on the sand by the sea. The atmosphere is the same, melancholy but tense; as though a storm is brewing. The wind whips her hair (sandy blonde, flecked with brown) out behind her. She scrapes a strand of it behind her ear. This time, I approach her.    “Louise,” I hear myself say. (Louise! Finally, I have found out her name! Louise!)   But she cuts me off, shaking her head almost imperceptibly. I pause, but after a few seconds, I carry on.   “Look, I’m sorry.” She turns towards me, and I see her face for the first time.     She is beautiful. Her nose is straight and graceful, her eyes a deep azure. Freckles are speckled across her face. Now the wind is blowing her hair into her eyes, but she pays it no attention.     “I didn’t mean it when I said I wished you would just be like everyone else.” My words tumble out in a rush, even though I don’t know what they mean.    “It’s a little late for that now, isn’t it?” She asks, a sad little smile playing at the corners of her lips. Suddenly, the storm comes in, pelting us with raindrops. She-Louise-wades into the shallow water, turning back about 50 feet away from me. She waves and shouts something that I cannot hear over the now torrential downpour and howling wind. I wave back, but she has turned away. And now she is gone.      I wake up. I know, somehow, that that was the last of the dreams. I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve lost something--or someone.
20090223163335AA2nSso	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Do you like my funny poem?	What Is Your Right Mr. Curser? ---or--- I Think That Foul Should Fly the Coop      I find I’m often left in want of a simple explanation   As to why expressions change in times of exasperation.   Why must people utter such malicious maledictions?   If all were left to me, I would stiffen the restrictions.      Likewise disconcerting, I have found that as of late,   These words have metamorphosed to mean good, bad, love, or hate.   It’s hard enough as is, in society’s confusion,   Without these expletive’s dispersion and diffusion.      So a statement I will make, to the man or woman curser:   Leave the fouls behind you, it’s all the better; none the worser.   And if you find your word-stock to be waxing rather brief,   Through the glossary or dictionary or thesaurus you should leaf.      Still I hear divulged by some, they miss their rancid ways,   Coining them so dearly as their beloved ‘good old days’.   If words of harshness and of brashness are still exigently needed,   Your lack of vulgar language; no way has this impeded.      If you wish to call a person foolish, use simply: injudicious.   For mean there’s: nasty, callous, knavish, vile, and pernicious.   Still there are so many more that here I’ve left unlisted,   For I place full confidence you can find them unassisted.      In all occasion you can have a plethora of options.   Just think of all those unused words waiting for adoptions.   Pepper in some color to your daily oral chores,   And open those forgotten and neglected vocab. doors      Yet there are some scoffers who like their words four-lettered,   They’d please to keep me voiceless and my vocals zipped and fettered.   Cause who am I to speak when words like ‘worser’, I have used?   Well you see your words are coarse, and mine have but amused.

20090223165231AAdOIyE	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Modern Connection ideas for the raven?	I need a modern connection (movie clip, commercial) for the following lines in the Raven by Edger Allan Poe:      But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only,   That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.   Nothing further then he uttered - not a feather then he fluttered -   Till I scarcely more than muttered `Other friends have flown before -   On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.'   Then the bird said, `Nevermore.'      Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,   `Doubtless,' said I, `what it utters is its only stock and store,   Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster   Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore -   Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore   Of "Never-nevermore."'      But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,   Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;   Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking   Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore -   What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore   Meant in croaking `Nevermore.'      Thanks!

FóRMULA UNO      Rafael, con poco más de veinte a?os, es atractivo, tiene la mirada clara, tan transparente como el alma.   En su vida conviven dos pasiones, la música y los autos de carrera.   Conoce casi todos los autódromos, hace poco consiguió integrar como primer piloto una escudería famosa.   Se levanta temprano, hoy serán las pruebas de clasificación en la pista de Montecarlo.   Antes de ingresar observa el paisaje, sobre el mar descansan los yates de los poderosos, si gana varias careras seguramente podrá regalarle uno a la mujer de sus sue?os, juntos recorrerán todos los océanos, sonríe, para eso falta.   En el box se calza el traje antiflama , parece un gigante blanco, se abraza a sus compa?eros, la máquina parece un bólido, la velocidad la convierte en un punto rojo rodando por el pavimento.   Terminada la prueba le informan que consiguió la pole position.   En el hotel lo espera Adriana, su novia de toda la vida, festejan el órden de largada , se aman una y otra vez, es tanta la pasión, se entregan como si fuera la última.   Hoy es el gran día para Rafael, un desayuno ligero, como siempre Adriana no irá a verlo, le teme a las carreras.   Recorre el trayecto que lo separa del autódromo caminando, el sol ti?e de rojo el cielo.   Llega al box, calza su traje, contrariado pregunta a su asistente por qué le cambiaron el color del pasamonta?a, esta vez debajo del casco llevará uno de color *****.   La bajada de la bandera a cuadros indica el inicio de la carrera, solo tiene dos autos delante suyo, será fácil adelantarse.   En la décima vuelta el auto que lo antecede ejecuta una maniobra equivocada, sin control, su auto comienza a dar trompos en la pista, para terminar sobre el césped.   El ulular de las sirenas interrumpe la carrera, con dificultad lo sacan del cubículo del auto, le colocan un cuello ortopédico, en breve estará recibiendo tratamiento, al lado de la camilla Adriana, le toma la mano, intenta darle vida.   La última imagen del corredor es el cielo rojo, no ve a su mujer, sí, la figura de su artista de rock favorito.   Ahora todo es difuso, uno de los médicos le quita el pasamonta?a, para cerrarle los ojos.

En cuanto a los países Amerindios se cayeron al no tener la guia de la cultura Espa?ola, y se estancaron en una mezcla de cultura Indigena Espa?ola que confundió la mente y fue desacoplándose hasta perder una cultura definida.      En cambio tanto Ingleses como Norte Americanos al ser de temperamento frió ninguno de los 2 sufrieron el impacto de la separación, sino todo lo contrario esta apatía los hizo progresar. aprovechando explotar tanto la tierras d U.S como las colonia de Inglaterra.      Quizá esto también le paso a Portugal.   K opinan?

20090222150614AAZhqIQ	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	How would you improve this little poem of mine?	“Aporia”   by Peter Benoit      If I could with a word well-chosen tell   You of the mysteries I've come to know   In sweet-sad murmurs of the vesper bell,   My throttled tongue would then so overflow   With tales of timeless, soft, supernal glow   That visions, gray and mundane, all have seen   (That mark and mock our outer life below)   Would be repealed, as if a stubborn screen   Had been dissolved; and all that lies between    The parclose paling of the piece-bright world   And what is masked — the pure and ever green —   Would then pour forth, as through a thin wall thurled.   The truth I've glimpsed, and yet no words are found,   And so by failing silence I am bound.      This silence that's become my sole estate   Has come of late to blur what's real and dreamed;   I have been set adrift to navigate   On seas that are, and are not, what they seemed.   For I have seen the center still that's teemed    Beneath the veil that not one soul denies,   And by its sight am both damned and redeemed   In ways I could not hope to analyze,   But which have in a strange way made me wise,   Though by their awful loneliness I'm swept —   Their wisdom seems all language to despise;   So often in my longing have I wept.    These are the poles that I am drawn between,   And yet how could you know quite what I mean?      While walking once along a country lane   I spied a bucket, weatherworn and bare,   Which time and circumstance half-filled with rain.   And on its waters I became aware   Of a lone beetle's silent voyage there,   And in it, mirrored, life's experience;   And now I see such visions everywhere —   I've not dared glimpse the oaken bucket since.   I'm tortured and yet blessed by Providence;   It's come to shake my wakefulness with sights   That pierce me utterly and make no sense.   And what were once my pleasures and delights,   And were for my whole life the goal and sum,   Now exile me to lands where words can't come.      A golden sunset makes my words quite fail,   A crippled child and country road, the same;   In all I sense the same soul-making vale   And know its grandeur full, yet not its name.   And not once did I beckon it, it came   And poisoned me 'til I could speak no more.   Daylight's dull web and I are one and same —   The empty mask that hangs beside the door.   Have I been made the sole inheritor   Of things I know, but never can explain?    Mere circumstance has scourged me to the core;   With folded hands I slowly go insane.   I've seen God's greatness, but it has been planned   That I not speak of what I understand.
20090222150843AA5HEh6	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What changes would you make to improve this little bit of verse?	“Robert Scarlett’s Song”   By Peter Benoit (9/16/08)      Robert Scarlett was an Elizabethan gravedigger.  He lived to be nearly 100 years old and remained active in his grim work until late in life.      I've known the toil of three score years   And built the arks of damned and dears,   And here I build unto this day;      O' how much longer can I stay?   I've known the lot of them from birth,   Have seen their tears, have heard their mirth,   Have heard a maiden wail with child   And each was born to be exiled —   Both king and knave; to common end   Do all the sons of Adam tend   Where mire and mitre come to blend  —      We're wanderin’, we're wanderin'.       Four horsemen ride both day and night   And every living soul indict.   From John o' Groats unto Lands End   They take what man cannot defend,    And own all here and yet to come --   They fill the whole and are the sum.   And by their work I'm sore annoyed   Though all hours of the day employed.   I pant and grunt in mortal pain,   I feel my vital forces wane   But still I hear them o'er the plain   Come thunderin', come thunderin'.      I, shoulder-deep in dirt and death,   Strain gutter-gasped wit' failin' breath;   Alas, the farrier works by moon'   To make as one my curse and boon.   So on I delve, toss up a bone   And ken one day 'twill be my own —   What Mother fathers, Father tends,   Who counts at last the gold he spends.   And so I toil 'sif in a spell   Though I have heard the evening bell,   Each shovel one foot nearer hell —   I'm ponderin', I'm ponderin'.      And so tonight, when earth is cold,   I know the chill, and I am old.   I know that soon my labor's done,   My tine is past, my glass is run.   The thought that makes me heave in fright   -- That makes the chill run deep tonight --   Is that this final resting place   I make could mark my dire disgrace.   Aye, sixteen hooves forever pound   And o'er my roof their chord resound;   How could I know a sleep profound?   I'm wonderin', I'm wonderin'.

I once saw a y! answer question asking for a favorite book, and someone answered that it was this weird fantasy (i think) book by a 13 year old. It even had a website. I found it peculiar that someone would publish at 13 years of age and be unnoticed, then I figured she must have been self-published. It's not nancy yi fan. So i followed the link and went to the website. I'm pretty sure it was fantasy, 'cuz there was a map of fake lands and all. And it's most likely self-published becasue it said "buy now" or something like that ON the website, and did not mention things like "look for it in your store" or "Link to Amazon (And we all know Amazon doesn't sell self-published books)".

20090222145327AAiNn0Q	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Can I have some tips...I'm going to be tutoring young violin students?	I'm 16 and next week I'm starting tutoring kids in 4th and 5th grade. 4th grade is when kids can join the orchestra in my town's school system. So they need lots of help with intonation and stuff since they're beginners. So I'm trying to get prepared because I've never taught or dealt with kids at all lol so I'm stocking up on stuff. I already bought a really cool "finger finder pull out card" that gives all the hand shapes for each key signature I'm pretty excited to use that lol.   But I only have advanced music books. Does anyone know of a book you would recommend me to start off the kids with? There are too many out there I don't know what is best. I'm looking for one that has catchy little songs in it and helpful with rhythm and things. I don't mean the Suzuki books because even the 1st one I think would be too advanced for them so I'll move into those later.   I'm also looking for a scale book to use teaching - one that is easy to find a scale in whatever key the song is before we play the song   Also, what should I be looking for when I'm tutoring them? Posture..intonation..what else   I don't really know how to go about the tutoring..I guess I'll find my routine after a few lessons.   Sorry that's so much.. I'm kind of nervous I don't remember what my tutor used for me way back then lol

20090222125453AAUTLmW	Arts & Humanities;Visual Arts;Other - Visual Arts	Why is there no (or extremely minimal) male nude art?	I was using stumble upon and one of the categories i have checked off is for "nude art" (I'm 20 yrs old, and have always been interested in the arts and photography, I don't look at it for the porno type pics or aspect).  But when I've gone through it, it's always only females being shown in complete nude.  Now I was wondering, why are there never any guys? is it a sexiest type thing? or just based on the audience and what they try to project the art to?  And I've also noticed this with films as well; they're rated R and have full female nudity all the time and sex scenes and such, but nothing of the guy except for the chest.  And even the same goes for pornos as well.  This is just a curiosity thing, not because I'm sick in the head or anything.

20090222144507AAKnWOR	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	How do I fil my empty soul?	I have come accross quite a few good answers to questions on this site/forum, so I figured that I would ask my own.      I would imagine that I am not the only person to ask this question (during some point in their life), but how do I fil my empty soul?      And by soul, guess I mean my purpose in life.          My life has hit it's pinnacle!      I have no purpose or meaning in my life.   When I am alone sometimes, I just think "what am I doing?", "why do I feel so empty?", "why don't I feel satisfied?"   I hate my job to the point where I would walkout of my job (if I had somewhere else to go).   I can be totally alone in a room full of people (does not matter if I know all of them).      I go to work, I buy stuff, I eat stuff, I play games, and I watch TV (well recorded tv/dvds).   I know that the only reason I do these things now is to keep myself busy, so that I can't look in the mirror and find the real problem...      Some days I just want to walk away from my life, sell all my belongings, leave my job, and just go somewhere, anywhere...      If I have no meaning or purpose in my life, how can I fill my life with the happiness I want?   Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to top myself. I just want direction and a purpose, then I can take it from there...         I don't want money, women, fame (although a little of each would not be a bad thing, lol)....      I want purpose. Something that I can grow old and die with.      Any suggestions?      Thnaks,   Rogue      PS - If you don't have anything constructive to say, then don't respond here. I am looking for anwsers, not simpathy.

O my love! my wife!    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:    Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.

Ah, dear Juliet,    Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe    That unsubstantial death is amorous,    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?    For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;    And never from this palace of dim night    Depart again: here, here will I remain    With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here    Will I set up my everlasting rest,    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!    Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on    The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!    Here's to my love!

Im taking art history this year and every day we study look at art and like a few days ago, our teacher showed us the painting of Lady Godiva. and like she said that the story behind the inspiration for the painting is not clear, like we know who painted the painting and all, but now who the real Godiva was. She said that most people believe that like she was this english woman that sort of did something for the people or whatever by accepting this sort of, idk, i guess u could call it a dare by her husband to go riding naked through town, lol, but apparently theres a lesser known story of a teenage girl of royal ancestry in france in like the middle ages that was really mean to everyone and animals and also very cruel, so according to this legend, her mother gave her the choice of other being disowned, and thus becoming a peasant just like most of the people she had been so cruel to, or if not then learning the "essence of shame." apparently this girl believed that since she was royal, she was completely superior and could be cruel since it was "honorable" to be cruel to dirty and thus "shameful" peasants, so her mom taught her that you could be royal and "shameful" by having to ride her horse, to whom she had been cruel to, naked, through town, while the horse was dressed elegantly, like she usu. was, and that she would be shameful in comparison to a kind, although shabbily dressed peasant. Which do you think is the real story?     http://media.photobucket.com/image/lady%...

20090222153510AAPOFkR	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	My love says I have broken his heart, what shall I do?	He is going away, setting sail. To fix it, says he.   ..There is no need, just stay! begged I, on bended knee.   There is no point, you love another. Off I go, farewell.   Don't try to stop me, I shall not fall for your wicked spell!   ..I cried and cried to no avail. Preparing, he is now.   ..And I resigned and saddened, kiss him lightly on his brow.      I know he shall return, but till then, oh! What shall I do?   ..Forget him, you have me! To use! Forget that big ole pooh!     Who said that? I look around, but noone's to be seen!   ..You love me more, I know it. OUCH! Your needle just pierced my spleen!      Can you help me finish my poem?

Without souls, without feelings,   We stand still in your room.      Within these impervious walls,   Your favorite darkness lingers;   Your favorite mirror;   Your favorite lie;   Your favorite slave.      Still, I stand in tranquility,   Only moving in your desire.   Your fervent stare burns my will,   Left detached from these walls.      And within your impassive room,   Your favorite jewelry hangs;   Your favorite picture;   Your favorite pain;   Your favorite slave...      Here I am living on your breath,   Hanging on your words,   Feeling with your skin,   Seeing through your eyes...   I am always here.   3 weeks ago

Ok, well, my friends and I are dancers, and we were asked to do an opening dance for a huge dance studio performance... like, this place is HUGE in the dance world... We're SO excited, because we like, all LIVE for dance. We're planning on doing a latin/contemporary routine... It sounds weird, I know... but one of our dance instructors taught us about blending different dance genres into one dance... But we're not sure of what song... We were thinking about maybe doing "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic" by The Police, because the verses are good for contemporary and the chorus is good for latin, but no matter how much we choreograph it, there's not enough content in it... Anybody have any good ideas for our dance or a good song along the same lines of the one we picked?! Please?!      Thanks!

But I was thinking... Our actions may have lead to indirect tragic consequences whilst we are not even aware of it. For example, some people have sat in Doctor's waiting rooms when they have the flu and may have passed it onto an elderly person, who subsequently died. It's a sad thought I guess.

Any opinions are appreciated, thanks :)      The sky stretches and turns to night,   And the world is turning, it turns to light.      Overtime things decay,   Plant and bodies.   But love stays the same.          And overtime our emotions change,   The sun and the moon,   Nothing stays the same.      But this love is unfleeting,   Unchanging and untouched.   And time is its water,   But sometimes life gets too much.         But remembering that feeling,   That emotion, that thing.   That’s all that you have,   And that thing, it is everything.

20090222154639AADR7UD	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I need some critique on the Beginning of my story!?	The tang of salt overwhelmed the air while an indolent breeze whistled over the ship’s deck. Zoe watched the ocean tide rock the   one hundred and fifty thousand ton ship as if it were a baby’s cradle. The Scenery was beyond beautiful, nevertheless she could not find it within herself to enjoy this so-called vacation.     Zoe tried to block out all of her painful thoughts and memories as she Leaned cross-armed against the ship’s railing, the only thing keeping her from falling into the ocean. But no matter how hard she tried, those thoughts began to seep into her mind like smoke making its way through the crevices of a door. Zoe began thinking of her hometown and how, although she despised it, she’d rather be there than on this cruise with her mother and Trevor, her mother’s nauseating boyfriend. Her life had actually been fairly good before he crawled out of the depths of hell and into her mothers heart.    Zoe had always been the type of person who could withstand a lot and even if she were breaking apart on inside she wouldn’t let anyone witness it. But, as she looked around at the surrounding beauty of the world, she couldn’t help but realize that the shimmering oceans and the beautiful mountains were all just a masquerade covering up the pain and wretchedness the world was actually capable of. At the thought of how hopeless life was and how there was no way of escaping it without seeming cowardly, her eyes began too fill with tears.     Zoe looked around in embarrassment as she brushed away the tears. It was the first time she noticed the sky was growing dark. Zoe began to run back to room 220 were her mom and Trevor would be waiting impatiently for her so they could eat dinner. Running through the halls of the hotel portion of the ship Zoe disregarded the curses and warnings being thrown at her. She was Twenty minutes late and Trevor would have her head for it.    190...200...210...SMACK! Zoe’s head hit the ground with a heavy thud, and for a second everything went black. She opened her eyes to an outraged face staring dawn at her and an unfriendly hand offering to help her up. Trevor yanked Zoe to her feet and began to rub the spot where she’d ran into him with exaggeration. Zoes eyes began to fill up with tears again, not because of the blow to her head, but because his face was the last she wanted to see right now.     Any Stranger would probably think Trevor looked as if he‘d just came from a Hollywood fashion shoot. He wore a tight button-down shirt with rolled sleeves, to show off his lean muscles. Along with that, his square jaw, high cheek bones and ruffled hair all made him look much younger than he really was. She remembered the drooling mouths of her friends when she’d introduced them to Trevor and how they’d constantly talk about him. But to Zoe, Trevor was just a sleaze wrapped in a pretty package.     “What the hell is wrong with you, Zoe?” Trevor yelled, his voice filled with disgust. Zoe dropped her head, staring at the ground. No one, except Trevor, could ever make Zoe feel so incompetent, so unsure of herself.    “I’m sorry.” She whispered.    “Damn right you are. You’re such an inconsiderate-”    “Trevor!” Zoe’s mom cried cutting him off, “It was an accident, calm down.” She put a hand on his shoulder then looked at Zoe, “Oh my god, are you alright?” Her mom’s voice was drenched with sympathy. Zoe reached up and felt the tears that were streaming from her own eyes. No, I’m not all right, and I’ll never be alright she considered saying. But, instead, she just nodded.    “Now Trevor, if you don’t mind, I’d appreciate it if you’d apologize to my daughter for being a jerk,” Her mom continued.  Trevor sighed and in a fake voice said, “Zoe, I‘m truly sorry for being an ***.” He then pulled her into him for a hug. A kind gesture, any bystander would think; but it wasn’t a kind gesture at all. He hugged her a little too tight for a little to long. She felt his breath on her skin, sending shivers down her spine. She wanted to stab him.      any advice/criticism?    please and thanks.   --Kara
20090222114958AA53jjN	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Any movies/plays/pictures with fairies (please read before answer)?	We're putting on the play A Midsummer Night's dream which, of course, involves fairies and we're trying to design costumes. Our director was specific in saying that she'd like the fairies to LOOK LIKE PLANTS/FLOWERS so they can hide in the scenery and suddenly come out (like the munchkins from Wizard of Oz).       The fairies are played by younger boys and girls but she wants it to look fantasy like, not silly. The girls would look like flowers, the boys like plants. We're in desperate need for visual references to get some ideas.      So does anyone know of any movies/plays/images that have this sort of costume? Even if it's an animated movie.      Costumes that involve plants and flowers are helpful too (a hat made of a big leaf, a skirt that looks like a flower in bloom, ext.)      I know this is pretty specific but the more ideas we have, the more wonderful the costumes will be.

I've come up with concerned, rushed, and flustered. My teacher said that rushed seemed a little too physical, but I thought it could work because she seems always to be bustling about trying to make things perfect, and seems to freak out a little bit. Well thanks! If I have time, or remember, I'll choose best answer :)

El investigador americano Jim Tuck. afirma que el Gral. Victoriano Huerta, indio huichol puro, ingresó al Colegio militar y fue becado para estudiar en Europa. Fue: Físico maemático, astrónomo, ingeniero topógrafo, supervisor de ferrocarriles, experto en estrategia militar (con aportaciones personales). Que Francisco Villa cuando anduvo con Huerta combatiendo a Pascual Orozco en Chihuahua aprendió muchas de las estrategias del Gral. Huerta.     El Gral. Francisco Villa siempre reconoció públicamente que era muy inteligente "El Borrachito" como llamaba a Huerta.   Cuando fue exiliado en Europa, tuvo contacto con el Kaiser alemán y éste le pidió que se regresara a México para abrir un segundo frente contra Estados Unidos durante la 1a. Guerra Mundial con la promesa de que si ganaban, le serían regresados a México los territorios que le fueron arrebatados por los americanos. Huerta contactó con Pascual Orozco al pasar por E.U.A. Pero fueron detenidos.   Huerta murió en forma sospechosa allá.

Suggestions are definitely welcomed.  Thanks, EC      What is Loyalty?      It is said that loyalty is a state of being.   I believe it’s a quality that is the construct   of love for a person, country, cause, or meaning.   This virtue, or any other, can’t be forcibly plucked.      It is acquired as the result of an achieved state,    carved out of experiences that life provides.   In a way, it is a product of the collective au fait.   an axis around which our behavior revolves.      The skeleton that aids us in standing upright,   traversing through this ancient terrestrial existence.   The moment by moment direction we take, per rites,   based on a conscious choice, we make persistence.

20090222124111AAsL2E7	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	How could I improve my Dorsimbra? (suggestions)?	“Change” (Dorsimbra)   by Peter Benoit         An age has ended, all the world is new   And what was sacred once has sadly passed   Into oblivion; I live and rue   That all I loved could not but longer last.      All life is change.   I grasp   At strands of thought;   How strangely      Solid it all seemed, but yesterday’s asleep   Today, and rests in Time’s vast vault.   All that is best and worst has blown away;   An age has ended, all the world is new.
20090222142048AAkU9ZV	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	What do I write poetry about!?	I have to make a poem book for school.      I love to write poetry, and I'm pretty good at it too, but most of my poems would either humiliate me, or make my teacher send me to a counselor.  I ussually write about despair, or god, or love or things like that.  I only have two poems that are usable, the only thing I can think to write about is nature, any ideas?

20090222130557AA7f6pS	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Comment/rate my poem?	'tis based on Poe's writing style and done for a school assignment:      The cold winter wind blew my hair   As I stood outside out home in despair   For I knew he would be coming   I know he would be coming   And a cheery tune he’d be humming      The ring which not long ago had been placed on my hand   Revealed an unwanted future planned   And so each day I wondered what would come of   Each day I wondered what would come of   The life I loved so dearly, and the man I truly loved      And as I heard his purple cape rustle in the wind, and his footsteps close   I became even more engrossed   In the dark, cold, rushing sea plunging bellow me   The dark thoughts and feelings which arose   Gave me glee as I dreamt of my very body swimming in that very sea      Until, for a moment, a cold, firm hand came resting on my shoulder   While the darkness around me grew bolder, my insides feeling suddenly colder   While somewhere deep inside my bosom, everything seemed okay   Yet remembering who the man really was   I bitterly turned away      I hated that hand which everyday touched my shoulder ever so gently   Causing memories to surge momentarily   Oh that hand! How it angered me so!   Oh that hand! May I never have to see it again   And the dim sun set, erasing the little light from sight that had once been      Each day that hand would drive me crazy   It made me mind unclear and hazy   Although me? No, I could not, am not, crazy. No not at all.   ‘tis that hand that causes this. ‘tis hat hand so small.      Each night I would follow my prince into our lair   And as his hand would rest, at it I would unnervingly stare   Would I – do I dare?   Do I dare?   I watched as his chest rose and feel with each breath, knowing that through his consciousness I must beware         Yet I always held a dagger close to my side   Ever so present, as close as the sand was to the ocean’s tide   My fingers brushed at its coldness, the firmness of its hilt   At my finger tops was that cold, cold, begging hilt   My fingertips drew it slightly – as inside me, began to rise a strange feeling of evinced felicity yet nevertheless guilt      Oh! That hand...that eerie hand I hated so!   The equivocalness inside me began to grow   As I walked closer to where me dear prince soundly slept   I crept closer and closer to where my dear prince lay   And with a soft sigh I brought the dagger close to what I thought to be that hand – that hand – to my dismay.      And without thought or hesitation at all – “Off with that hand! I do dare tonight. For rid ourselves of it, I will do this night.”   And as my dear prince screamed as loud as he may   A squawk of a bird screeched loud through the grey   The purple curtains fluttered as the wind blew and the shutters slammed causing my plan of action delay      So I looked at the cold face of my dying prince   His face filled with shock, worry, and fear which made me wince   He didn’t look scared for himself, but more concerned about – me?   And wondered how long it had been since…   I’d seen my real prince      And I looked up just in time to see a white dove and a black raven fly by   Flying, soaring through the sky, until landing and perching in a tree nearby   Which made me wonder if I’d ever see my true love again through physical means This seemed impossible, for the angels or devils of the unknown worlds as if by thrill   had taken him- my dear, dear prince against my will       And with sudden surprise I gasped, And looking down onto my own wrist, my arm I clasped   I looked into the face of the prince, who starred at me with terror filled eyes   He jumped from his bed to my side in surprise   %E

20090222135449AA7I08a	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	My passion for theatre or school?	I'm a freshman in high school and I have a passion for theatre. I absolutely love it, and my favorite show is RENT. This summer, a theatre in my area is doing RENT and I'm so excited. The problem is, I love math, too and I'm really good at it. I'm in Algebra 2 as a freshman and my school lets you take a summer school class in Trigonometry, then go into AP Calculus as a sophomore, skipping Pre-Calculus. Unfortunately, these two things are at the exact same time during the summer, so I can't do both. I really want to do RENT more, but it feels bad that I'm skipping out on an AP credit just for a show. But this could be my only chance to do RENT, and I'm stuck. So should I do Trigonometry or RENT this summer?

If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well       It were done quickly: if the assassination       Could trammel up the consequence, and catch       With his surcease success; that but this blow       Might be the be-all and the end-all here,       But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,       We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases       We still have judgment here; that we but teach       Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return       To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice       Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice       To our own lips. He's here in double trust;       First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,       Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,       Who should against his murderer shut the door,       Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan       Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been       So clear in his great office, that his virtues       Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against       The deep damnation of his taking-off;       And pity, like a naked new-born babe,       Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed       Upon the sightless couriers of the air,       Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,       That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur       To prick the sides of my intent, but only       Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself       And falls on the other.       I need an idea for my thesis statement for my paper about this.

20090222132709AAcwbJC	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Is there a difference between an old flute and a new flute?	Okay, so, I'm a pretty accomplished musician and I've recently decided I'm going to take up the flute.  I already play several brass instruments but no woodwinds so I'm pretty clueless.  I want to get a good flute, not one I'm going to need to replace in a year or two.   I'm looking at either a Yamaha 221 or a Yamaha 225.   I've read that the only difference between the two is the age, which makes me prefer the 225 because they are much cheaper. However, does the age of the 225 affect it's sound/playability?   I know I make very little sense. Help, flute players! :)   Thanks!

20090222121515AAHhO3n	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Do you want to audition?	I have a lot to say, so brace yourselves. My best friend and I are trying to "Live the Dream" as we say. We are HUGE Twilight fans! Now, in about 2 years, we are moving to Oregon. Yes, I am 100% serious. Our parents planned the move before we even knew about Twilight, how cool is that? Anyway, here's our plan. (We've got tons of money, and it's OUR money, NOT our parents money so we can pull this off) See we are both already pale, and really pretty, but like Nikki Reed before she became Rosalie, I am a brunette, and Like Ashley Greene before she became Alice, My friend has long hair. So, next year (cuz we don't want to do it now) we're going to the hair salon. I'm getting my hair died blonde and my friend is getting her hair cut. We use nutrigina and proactiv 3 times a day, so our faces are totally free of pimples and our lips, (due to overuse of vasline) are really soft and smoothe! And, we both use contacts, so we were thinking we could just get gold ones. Did I mention I was tall...like 5 foot 4 and my friend is only about 4 foot 8, I'm still growing, but my friend seems frozen at the hight she is now, she hasnt grown in like, 2 years! Anyway, I'm not here to white about us, I'm here to ask a question so here it is!      In 3 or 4 years we will need people of these ages!      we need 2 people through the ages of 20-23    1 boy, and 1 girl   then, we need an 18, 19, and 17 year old boys      here is why: we are trying to reinact Twilight in our lives      Did I mention we had a lot of money? Did I mention that the Cullens share the money they have? Did I mention you would get to use any of our money you wanted? Any way you wanted?       Ok, the 20 year old has to be a guy,        http://twilightsaga.wikia.com/wiki/Carli...       The 23 year old has to be a girl       http://twilightsaga.wikia.com/wiki/Esme_...

YOU MUST LOOK AND ACT LIKE THE PERSON YOU WANT TO BE, AND YOU MUST BE SINGLE UNLESS YOUR BOYFRIEND/ GIRLFRIEND LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE PEOPLE WE NEED, IN THAT CASE ONLY CARLISLE'S HAVE THE OPTION OF NOT BEING SINGLE!!!!!!      If you want to be either Emmett or Jasper, you have to put up with me  and my friend, like I said we are changing our apparences to look like Rosalie and Alice, so if you think they are pretty and you think you could put up with how their attitudes are, you should be ok with us! lol, I'm becomming Rose and my friend is becomming Alice.

20090222122654AA3VCXE	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Is this a 12 line couplet?	Ayala is the greatest school on earth   All of its students are filled with great mirth      As soon as you walk through the tall iron gate   Be prepared to meet your fate!      Many of us are really friendly   We welcome new students gladly; don't be bleary.      For the most part, courses are fairly simple   So if you get good grades your life should be blissful.      But passing periods are way too brief   With only 6 minutes to traverse the campus, it causes much grief.      Ayala's sports teams are truly dedicated   The athletes on the team are enthusiastic, ardent, and avid.      But halt! Beware the security guards!   They are constantly patrolling the halls and courtyards.      Don't mess with them, they are unforgiving   And if you do, then a detention will you be serving.      Many schools are really a great bore.   But Ayala you're sure to adore!      So if you come visit a teacher, counselor, or friend   You'll be glad its Ayala they attend!      The hustle and bustle of the students nearby   Show the busyness of the school; that you can't deny.      The school's campus, so neat and tidy   Makes Ayala a very great place to be.

20090222132820AA3nTj7	Arts & Humanities;Other - Arts & Humanities	What are some good werewolf names?	I'm writing a novel centered around a group of young werewolves living in the city. The younger of the pack give each other nicknames which they call each other by while together (for example, one of them is called Flinch, another Dog), but also have their birth names by which everyone else calls them by (like John, Victor, etc). But there are several werewolf characters that I'm having trouble coming up with nicknames for. They should be relatively modern and not too complicated; most of the nicknames are short and easy to say. They can be anything, though--I don't really care. I'm just losing sleep over this. XD If you can help me with nicknames for any of the following werewolves, your assistance would be much appreciated!      1. His real name is Damion Cross and he's 17 years old. He has black hair and black eyes. He's sort of the sneaky, quiet type that ends up being a real backstabber in the end. He sulks everywhere and he doesn't seem to care about much. Originally, his nickname was going to be Axel, but when I realized that that was the name of a character in "Blood and Chocolate" by Annette Curtis Klause, which has a similar plot line, I scrapped it.      2. His real name is Jeffrey Lowell. He's an awkward 12-year-old, apparently destined to remain the Omega in the pack for the rest of his life. He has embarrassingly red hair and is rather shy with the pack, for he's the youngest. He's uncomfortable with being a werewolf. A cousin of the novel's heroine.      3. I need both an actual name and a nickname for this next one. He's the 18-year-old older brother of the heroine. He's rational and intelligent, but can be a little irresponsible. He enjoys partying and fooling around. He knows his sister can take care of herself, so he usually tries to let her figure things out for herself instead of butting in all the time.      Honestly, don't give me stupid names. I don't want a werewolf named Bob or Fluffy. Give it some thought. Thanks. :D

20090222141405AAWz0N5	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	A dance duet for me and my sister?	My sister and I are doing a duet together. I am 14 and she is 11. We will have to choreograph it because we don't have enough money to pay our studio to do it. We are both Advanced Intermediate. So the highest in the intermediate category.  We have been competing for 3 years and dancing for 6.      We have a lot of songs that we might like to do. We chose some of the 80's songs to stand out and give the judges something that they weren't expecting.    So here's are list-   *Anything you can do, i can do better.   *Big Girls Don't Cry   *Clocks   *It's My Life (bon jovi)   *Girls Just Wanna Have Fun    *Dance With Somebody (whitney houston)   *Living On a Prayer (bon jovi)   *Let It Rock   *Apologize   *Hero      We need a bigger list so that my parents can help us choose. They want a big list to choose from about like 4-5 more songs we might want to add. and tell us if you think that we should leave out any songs.... thank you!!!!

20090222143735AAczU85	Arts & Humanities;Theater & Acting	Which song should I use for my audition?	Later this evening, I'm auditioning for Jesus Christ Superstar at one of the theatre places around my home. I've auditioned for plays and musicals before, but they've always been school-oriented. They're requiring us to sing 16 bars of a song and do a cold reading and then learn a dance later on.      I'm prepared with everything except my song choice. I've got some picked out and they all suit my voice but I don't know which one I should use. I picked out:      -There's A Fine Fine Line (Avenue Q)   -I'm Not That Girl (Wicked)   -The Spark of Creation (Children of Eden)      And this last one is... Well... A song for a male voice. But I'm crazy about the song and it's range is wide enough for me. (I'm classically trained and I'm in show choir and very much into Broadway show tunes).      My last choice is      -Lost In The Wilderness (Children of Eden)      I wish I had videos of me on Youtube so you could see which one is best or a different song. I'm sticking with those four choices because I know them all very well and I don't have time to learn any other songs or get the sheet music right now. lulz.      Anywho... If you think they are bad choices, go ahead and tell me. I'm not afraid of criticism or anything like that. I'm not full of myself and I know that I am not the best singer in the whole wide world. I am the type of person that will not brag or boast in front of others. Sorry to ramble on like that. The auditions are at 7:30 and I know I should probably be there a tiny bit before hand. Thank you!!! =]

I love Harry Potter, and found Twilight fun to read although Stephenie Myer can't write to save her life, but has everyone forgot about all the other amazing books that exist? What books do you like that are not Harry potter or Twilight?    And before any really obsessive fans accuse me of hating on Harry Potter, I said earlier that I love it, and I found twilight fun to read.       thanks!
20090222142357AA5oUAO	Arts & Humanities;Dancing	America's Best Dance Crew Season 3 Hip Hop DECATHLON or PENTATHLON?	OK so if you watched the most recent episode of abdc (america's best dance crew) then u know that the next episode's challenge will be a hip hop decathlon (as announced by Mario Lopez) so i went on the abdc website and it said that 5 abdc "alumni" (dancers who've been on the show in past seasons) will be there next week to teach the 3 remaining crews how to do certain hip hop moves but thats only 5 altogether so shouldnt it be called a pentathlon? or do u think there's a seperate challenge too?          BTW here's the alumni teaching their respective hip hop moves:   HOUSING - Taeko (Fysh n Chicks)   TUTTING - Mike (Kaba Modern)   THREADING - Ronnie B. (Super Cr3w)   WAVING -KB aka Kevin (JabbaWockeeZ)   KRUMPING - Frost (Supreme Soul)
20090222143732AAwAI3U	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	How far can you throw yourself?	Standing at the oceans edge   I throw my thoughts to the horizon   slowly reeling them back to shore.   Running in the fields   tossed ideas roll in the grasses   landing in tufts of downy feathers.   Sitting atop a mountain at night,   memories of the future   sent sailing higher than the stars.   Hunched at my desk though,   they never seem to reach   the ends of my fingertips.

Should we rearrange our priorities and try to determine what is really important in life?

20090222143243AAslO9o	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Does a chapter-by-chapter summary of Sybil exist?	I'm kinda confused on exactly what is going on in each chapter and I'd like to find some sort of summary of what happens in each chapter of the book Sybil. However, Spark notes doesn't have anything about Sybil and all information I've found about the book is in short 1-3 paragraph summaries. If I don't find this I'm gonna have to reread the whole book just to get all the facts straight >_<      So I'm wondering if anyone knows anything in existence that has thoroughly discussed the book, because I can't find anything for Sybil, but I can for many other books.

20090222143657AAiS6YS	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Should I quit bass lessons and teach myself the rest?	Hello everyone,        I have been playing electic bass guitar for 7 months and have made considerable progress. My teacher says that I have perfect pitch (my brother plays piano and also has it.) I'm 18 and work as a cashier. I have been paying for my lessons.       I estimated my lesson cost for 2009 and it will cost me $848 this year. I make $2000 a year. After deduction, I have $1200 left. I want to save up for a car. At this rate, it will take forever to earn a car.     I love music and want to play the clarinet as well as stick to bass. If I quit lessons right now, I will save $720 this year. I know music theory and can play songs on the boombox 1,2,3.      My question is, would it be wise to quit lessons and teach myself the rest of the way? I am very motivated and am confident in myself. I have enough books to help me and think it will be more rewarding. I want the challenge. So, my plan is to quit bass lessons, teach myself bass an hour a day. Then when I am ready for clarinet, I will take lessons for 6-8 months and teach myself the rest. Sound like a good plan? Please let me know. I have been thinking about this for a while. Thank you very much,
