20090203103824AAMqkC0	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Financial Services	Unemployment benefits question?	A good friend of ours has been receiving unemployment and is actively seeking a job.  He may have found one but found out they pay once a month and hold the first month.  Will his benefits stop when he starts the job or when he receives his first paycheck in two months? (If he actually gets the job)  The maximum benefit amount he receives is less than one weeks salary of his lifetime career so he has lost everything and can't afford not to have the income for two months.  He's concerned about calling the unemployment office because he doesn't want to risk losing the benefits.  Please tell me what to tell him.

The wireless corporation pays out commissions 2 months late, so the commissions I made in Dec I won't recieve until the check I get on Feb 10. In my state, the legal minimum wage standard is 7.75 per hr. Since I wont recieve any commission I've made till Feb 10, and have worked essentially for less than minimum wage hourly for 2 months, shouldn't i be entitled to make 7.75 for those two months?

20090203122337AAi8LiE	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Can you help me with some advice on this roommate situation?	3 friends and i rented a house last october, but one of them did not sign the lease. she had to move back home after thanksgiving, so this other girl we all used to work with moved in. she did not sign the lease either. she was ok at first but now she is being really rude to me, throwing parties without asking us first and not even saying hi. I can simply not live like this and i am thinking of asking her to move out, since she did not sign the lease. One of my roommates will probably say she wants this girl to stay, but the other one (whom i've already talked to) said it doesn't matter to him who lives here or not. Can i just tell her to move out, or the 3 of us who signed the lease have to agree on this first?      Thanks a lot!

20090222200706AASq81i	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Another way of re-building husbands bad credit?	Okay we have 3 girls under the age of 4. Only one person working outside of the house. We get disability for the twins we have because they were born premature. Which adds up to 1300 a month. Husband makes 1200 a month. Combined it is 2500 a month. He has bad credit. He wants to take our tax return & pay off his remaining hospital bills then get a 5000 car so he can pay off the car in a year. We already have a van we have to pay 300 for a month. Plus 90 for insurance. So that will make our bills even more considering he will be paying 200-300 a month for his car plus insurance. He says he doesn't want to buy a car straight up because it wouldn't have a warranty on it. But most warrantys only last a year anyway. Even if they do they don't cover everything. I liked his first idea of getting a 2500-3000 car paid off so he can drive it to work instead of our gas guzzling van (even though he wants to get a gaz guzzler anyway). Is there any other way he can rebuild his credit? He is paying off his hospital bills. He has bills in his name. If you add in that the 3 girls we have are still in diapers plus baby food because the twins are developmentally delayed & can't eat solids well yet. Food for ourselves & the electricity bill (400) which has gone up this year because of the economy(was 100-200). Not to mention our rent (400) & cell phone (150). I just don't think it's a good idea for him to go about rebuilding his credit by this route & potentially destorying mine any further than he has. How can he rebuild his credit?   He also has a bad driving record so to add him to my insurance would cause mine to skyrocket. We tried to add him in the past. I understand you get a discount for adding double cars but he isn't on my insurance. He would have to get his own car insurance

20090222214408AA8IniO	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Apartment noise question?	I'm going to move into an apartment soon. I had some question about noise in the apartments. Can you usually hear your neighbors in an apartment? I lived in a 3 bedroom apartment that cost about 1200 dollars a month, and i never heard my neighbors, and I could play my acoustic guitar and watch movies at night without a problem. The apartment was fairly new.       Now that Im moving out on my own I probably would live in a studio or a one bedroom apartment for about 400-600 dollars a month. If I live in a cheaper apartment, will i hear my neighbors? Will I still be able to do things I was able to in my old apartment?      Also is the first floor better if I don't want my neighbors hearing me?

20090222213919AAjVgNo	Business & Finance;Corporations	Trademark question regarding definition of "Actually using mark in commerce now"?	The trademark registration form asks if I am "actually using the mark in commerce now".   Since I am applying for a servicemark, my understanding is that the service is "in commerce now" when it is advertised.   BUT one question, is a service considered "advertised" when it is just offered on a public site or do you have to do active advertising such as giving out flyers or TV ads etc.   Also, is listing the site on a search engine like yahoo considered "advertising"?      Here are some more details in case you need them. The company name is something like companyname, llc and the domain is companyname.com, and I want to trademark "companyname".    The service is an online software listing database, the I will be charging a monthly subscription to software companies to link to their sites.   The servicemark will be displayed at the top of each page (in the form of a logo).   I have an order form for software vendors to sign up for my subscription service on the site. (that is what I am directly "selling").   On the site there will be links my vendors sites (who are paying a monhtly subscription to be listed), which consumers will buy directly from them by clicking the links. I do not yet have any vendors who have actually subscribed/purchased the service as of yet.

My friend recently told me that she was gonna be a camp counselor over the summer and I thought to myself, "Wow that would be REALLY fun!" So I decided that I would LOVE to do that. So what I'm asking is if anyone knows a camp that would hire a 15 year old male to be a counselor. I have worked with kids at a day care before, and I have been told I am an inspiration and that I am great with kids (sorry, I don't want to seem big headed!). If you had a link to a camp in the SACRAMENTO, CA area that is hiring counselors that would be  AMAZING! Thank you!
20090222204550AASf6YU	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	My mum says I won't be able to get a good job if I go back to college and graduate at 26?Any thoughts?	THANKS FOR SPENDING A FEW MINUTES TO READ MY QUESTION. I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP AND APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE **********      I am 23, male. I have been studied science in an Australian university for 1 year. My parents want me to be a biological scientist but I am not interested in science at all. I didn't do well and finaIly I droped out from the course :( . My university counsellor suggest me to go back to Hong Kong (my hometown) and discover my own interest before I go back to study in Australia. Back in Hong Kong, I am living with my parents and I share the rent with them. The rent is about US$ 900 per month. Dad, mum and I pay US$300 each. My 20-year-old younger sister lives with us as well.However, she doen't pay anything.      Recently all my family members suspect I am gay. They ask , " I'm sure that you drop out from your science course because you are homosexual. Ewww! Everyday they say unplesant things to me ( e.g. I hate you so much, I'll never forgive you, You should turn back to heterosexual, I wanna beat you up because you are gay, All gay men are worse than sh*t, including you ) I face their bad words everyday in addition to having an academic failure, I went back to my room and closed the door and cried. Then sister say I am not allowed to close my room's door. " You need to have your room door opened all the time, including when you are crying. What's the point of closing the d*mn door? Have you ever considered my feelings?You know what? I have been tolerated your gayness for a while!" My parents are always on her side. They say" Listen to *your sister, you f*ggot" My parents also say " Why can't you get along with us well? If you can't get along with us well, it means you can't get along with your schoolmates and colleagues as well. You are a big loser !" My sister, who is studying to be a counsellor, says " Why are you so defensive about yourself? Why don't you loosen up yourself and date women?   " I replied "I have tried to date a girl for 3 months. But finally I've found that it doesn't work. I don't want to cheat the girl and say "I am straight" anymore. I don't want to hurt the girl. We broke up. " I added " I am proud of being gay". My sister replied , " You're so defensive about your homosexuality therefore no counsellor on Earth can help you. "       I also said , " I dropped out from science course because I have no interest in it at all. Mum, My dream is to be an successful accountant, not a scientist ."      Question 1) Which one do you think is better? Get my accounting degree in Australia or worjk in Hong Kong ? You are 23 year old laready. My mum said " If you study full-time in Australia for 3 more years , it mean you will lose 3 years of work experience. When you graduate with an accounting degree at the age of 26, no one will hire you again because you are too old at that time. And you don't have much full-time job experience . You will not able to find a good job because employers tend to employ younger people. However, I really wanna go to Australia , do my favourite course and stay away my parents. Will I be less competitive in the job market after 3 years ( because my graduate age is 26 , which is older than an average graduate ) ?

The club still ended up charging my debt card for the table reservation on top of what I already gave the promoter.   I tried to get the money back from the club promoter, but he's being a shady a*hole so theres no chance Im going to get the money back from him.   I then tried to get the money back from the club, but they supposedly "dont know anything about it" and "cant help me".      So now I dont know what to do and Im really pissed off and I want my money back! How can I go about doing this?      Should I take the promoter and the club owner to small claims court?      Would that even work since I gave the promoter cash and theres no proof I even gave him anything?      Can I somehow get the promoter arrested for robbing me?!      Help what do I do?!?!

I have lived in an apartment for a year and I was wondering what normal wear and tear is to Tile, showers, and fireplaces. My tile in front of my fireplace has cracks all in it and one piece is able to come up... I have never dropped anything on it or stomped on it... it just did it itself. I weigh 230lbs and if it can't handle that weight walking on it, I would think that it was not properly enforced. My fireplace was brand new when I moved in, and I have used it about 10 times or so and it is completely black now. I have tired to clean it and it is stained... and I know that fireplaces do that so they can't hold me responsible... right??? My shower also has the stains in between the tile on the caulk or whatever it is and I was also told that that was normal wear and tear... it was new when I got here... the tub was not and they PAINTED over the tub and every time I clean it paint flakes off and sometimes when taking a shower it flakes off and goes down the drain... so the water does not flow down the drain right... am I responsible for any of the shower things? Am I responsible for anything? Thank you all for your time!!!!!! :)

My mother isn't thrilled with the idea of me leaving and of course with the money that will be required but I am fully willing to take it on myself. Do you suggest figuring out for sure what I want to do by going to a community college in my area, and spending less money, before I go away and realize it's not what I want? ....or taking the chance? I'm not sure. I would absolutely love to go away, and to experience life and learning in a new city. I need to get out of here!!

I would like to resign from my current job, which is a temporary job. My contract says I should give one day's notice, which is a bit ridiculous considering the company it is and the responsabilities I have been given. In normal circumstances, i would give more notice, but have been offered a job to start two days later, hence I have no choice. How do I come about "resigning". I feel a bit silly "handing my resignation" if I'm simply on a temporary contract. Thenagain, I'm not sure a simple face-to-face "Hi I won't be here tomorrow" would suffice. Are there any ways of quitting an important-position office based work? A speedy response would be highly appreciated

Here is my issue, I bought a car and I just made my 7th payment. I had to have a co-signer help me get the credit for it, I had one bad month right around the 4th payment pay date. I was laid off, but I made a double payment on the 5th month to cover the late payment and also the current. Now I have the cash to just pay off the car completly, but I dont want to hurt my co-signer. The bank told me they made one marking on the credit for the 4th month being late, How bad will that affect the credit score? my second question is, do I pay off the car, or leave the cash in an account and have the payments come out for another 6 months or so and just pay the interest on it? Please someone who knows for sure what is best to do for the credit score!

Ok so I know this is bad to do...but I'm always behind on money and i know how to "work my overdrafts"..so that I will only get one 35 dollar fee and can overdraft up to 800 dollars. I always pay it back within the next 2 weeks and have been doing it for over a year. Anyway I usually go food shopping and then overdraft my rent after that. But instead I want to pay my rent and go food shopping a week later..Im wondering if you can overdraft from an ATM I will have about 100 dollars in there but want to take out 300...If they would let me do this for a purchase (which im positive they would) would it be the same with an ATM?      ohh and the reason i want to use an atm to get the money instead of just paying with my card is because i want to go to a few different stores and If I would just charge it all on my card i would end up with like 3 overdraft fees

I was previously going to whine about how I lost $420 to bank of america via overdrafting, but I'm sure 80% of you would go on and on about how it is my own dumb fault for going over, as obviously I'm totally in control of my own actions.      I didn't know about overdraft fees until now, so even if they did put "you will be castrated if you overdraft", i would be castrated. Sound fair? Nope.      Anyhow, this question more pertains to how I am able to get that money back, is there any way to receive my $420 back? I was charged -$35 with a lot of small transactions like a $1.06 McChicken, like, seriously? I had 12 overdraft charges totalling $420.      Any idea what to do to get it back? I called them over the phone and the teller and manager could only give me $84 back out of "Courtesy" but the manager told me if I had fraud on my account, I could get refunded more.
