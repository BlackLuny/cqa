Not many people realise it but the Scottish Highlanders and Native Americans have a lot of shared history - quite a few books have been written on the subject. If you want a great city to live in I would definitely recommend Edinburgh - as there is always lots going on, and it's rainy quite a lot of the time. You would love it there! :-)|`|AA11900069	Do you like REALLY bad weather, and a general dourness vibe?|`|7lC5co1Yaa	People in Scotland, like anywhere else vary in their view of other people.

Zadysvg5aa	One day at Niagara is enough. Just do the" Maid of the Mist" trip under the falls and head home. It's very touristy and a rip off.  Public transport in Toronto is good and gets you around quickly. Don't hire a car unless you are used to automatics and are comfortable driving on the continental side of the road.|`|S6Kb2VU9aa	2 hours is more the enough for Niagara Falls unless you are into the tourist trap thingies...Niagara on the lake has good wineries to visit if you're into that kinda thing.     Once in Toronto, I would use public transportation. I loved there, and I would often leave my car at the subway station and take public transportation. It takes youeverywhere, relatively inexpensive, and you don't have to find a spot to park (which is hard and expensive downtown!) or remember where you parked! You get to just go where you want, and when you want to go back to your hotel or where you are staying, just find a subway station and look at the map.     Have fun! |`|vgkHZSTPaa	I found niagra falls disappointing so my advice would be go see the falls and get out of there, transport system in toronto is pretty good so depends on whether you want to hire a car.|`|db315646dfa7741b6ef9fcf010fb0312aa	I was there for one day and went broke.

Niagara is geared for tourists and the prices reflect it.  Toronto.  Unless you are used to driving a left hand drive car in an unfamiliar environment,stick to public transport.  Toronto has an underground plus buses and trolley buses. Taxis were a lot cheaper than the U.K. but how far the oil crisis has hit the fares ??|`|Wzc6dXBTaa	My opinion? Its better from the Canadian side. Rent a car. But if you're interested to see what millionheads thinks - go to www.millionheads.com and ask your question there to tap the collective wisdom of crowds.

In South Jersey, you're only an hour or so from NYC and Philly and Delaware. And the Jersey Shore is a great vacation destination, if I may say so myself. South Jersey has more small towns.    North Jersey is okay. It's much more crowded, as you might assume. And industry is more common up there, so you get a lot of factories and it can smell bad (case in point: near the Newark airport...).    Either way, be prepared for high car insurance rates and taxes. It costs money to live in Jersey, and we don't mess around.

556e2b3b8dbb30ecb9e019a58a4e86e6aa	From what I have heard you can actually send your picture in, if you are a girl, to the mansion and request to get a ticket to parties there. I am sure they are very selective, plus you are only allowed one ticket per request and can not request for any boyfriends, etc. You can also purchase tickets for certain parties, but I believe those are several thousand dollars.     If none of that works out, you can either buy the map of the stars homes, look up the Playboy mansion address online(it is readily available), or go on one of the tours of the stars home, as has been suggested. You really don't see much from the tours though as the house is set back off of the street. |`|3K1QW7Oeaa	No.|`|HvALvdc7aa	I highly doubt it|`|AA11746917	You can see it if you go on a tour like, VIP Tours.

LPOcq5UCaa	What your friend probably experienced is called "culture shock". The United States is not exceptionally better or worse than most other industrialized western nations. We have many strengths and many weaknesses. But what upset your friend is simply a different in culture. I suggest you read some books on United States culture, most libraries, bookstore, or amazon.com will have plenty to choose from.     It is also always hard to be from somewhere else. It takes time to acclimate to a new culture. If you choose to move here, I think you will be fine, but you should do your research first.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	Don't let one persons opinion get to you..   many times people here treat other people on how they treat them  yes live is hard ..but it is hard all over..  it also depends where you live... in a very populated area or a more rural area..  it also depends what kind of activities you get involved in..  many people do smile here..   it also depends how social he was..  if your social you will get along great!      |`|AA11746917	The USA is a big country.

AA11298562	I lived in China for a while (6 months), and I don't believe that China really has lower crime rates, I think the numbers are skewed so the Chinese government can show off.  Most people in China were OK, and some are now close friends, but there seemed to be an attitude of "if it doesn't directly effect me, I don't see it".  In America, if you smile and say 'hi' to someone you don't know, they'll usually smile and say 'hi' back.  It's considered polite, and it makes people feel safe.  In China, I found that unless you were at a park or something, a lot of people would just look at you blankly if you tried to strike up a conversation.  Now, maybe its different for me because I'm white, and my Chinese isn't very good.  But I honestly felt that if I got into trouble while walking down a street in China, that nobody would do anything, because they didn't want to bring trouble on themselves.|`|Plgai105aa	Crime in america is localized to major metropolitan areas.  The rich have managed to separate the poor into small ghettos, and keep transportation costs to get to their neighborhoods high.  In america, the poor are rapidly becoming slaves to the rich, so crime develops in the inner city.  However, I live in a big city, and have never been mugged or robbed.  Someone once attempted to rape me, but I was too... sharp for him.

Unser Dozent hat uns das einmal so erkl?rt:  Egal ob die Eltern deutsche Staatsangeh?rige sind oder nicht, wenn das Kind in Deutschland geboren wird ist es automatisch deutscher Staatsangeh?riger. (Das wird teilweise auch von den Ausl?ndern ausgenutzt) Es hat also auch nichts mit der l?nge des Aufenthalts in Deutschland zu tun.  Genauso w?re es, wenn ein Kind mit Russischen Eltern in einem franz?sischen Flugzeug, das gerade ber Spanien fliegt, geboren wird. So unglaublich wie es klingt, das Kind w?re nun Franz?sischer Staatsangeh?riger, weil es an einem "franz?sischen Ort" - das Flugzeug geboren wurde.    Hm, ziehmlich eigenartig aber so ist es...    gru?     Yuri|`|30109e293e01db5feac6a579d9859b15aa	Nein, nicht unbedingt. In Deutschland geboren, aber als Kind von Eltern anderer Staatsbrgerschaft bedeutet, dass man Staatsbrger des Landes der Eltern ist.   Auch dann, wenn man das Land nie besucht hat und m?glicherweise nicht mal die Sprache beherrscht. Skurril!    Hallo an Yuri, Dein Dozent irrt sich da. Das, was er sagt gilt fr Frankreich oder die USA, aber nicht in Deutschland. Nur wenn wenigstens ein Elternteil seit mindestens 8 jahren oder schon immer Deutscher ist, wird das Kind automatisch deutsch.

En mi caso, el placer me lo dan muchas cosas, entre las que se encuentran conocer (es decir aprovecho para disfrutar y conocer en un mismo momento).    Lo importante en un viaje turstico es no estar obligado a nada, no sujetarse a obligaciones, etiqueta, horarios ni destinos. Hacer lo que me plazca, en el momento que quiera y sin presiones externas.    Esto permite que sienta un placer similar haciendo un crucero, mirando un glaciar, leyendo un libro a la sombra de un cocotero o mirando el cielo estrellado de una noche de verano.

0fc71d93282bf1baaa4cd5f250fd7a07aa	The modern Turkish state was created after World War I. Its predecessor was the 600-year-old Ottoman Empire.Turkey became a republic on Oct. 29, 1923, after the nationalist movement led by Mustafa Kemal was victorious in the war of the independence against the Allies who had defeated the Ottoman Empire in World War I.The constitution of 1924 implemented the slogan "sovereignty belongs to the people" by creating a government in which power was almost completely centralized in a unicameral legislature known as the grand national assembly. Resentment of past misuse of executive power by the sultans and by the Young Turks led to severe limitations on the veto powers given to the president of the republic and to the omission of judicial review of legislative actions. Deputies to the assembly were elected for four-year terms. The assembly elected a president as head of state for a four-year period, and he in turn appointed a prime minister and a cabinet. The constitution provided for an independent judiciary and guaranteed individual rights and freedoms. During the 1920's new legal codes were promulgated, based on European models.|`|vbTG3a4Zaa	after WWI the Ottoman Empire changed its name to Turkey

Hoje em dia o nmero de assaltos diminuiu, mas como n?o recebe muita manuten??o e ainda passa por lugares perigosos como encostas de montanhas e muitas vezes quebra e chega a at perder vag?es, continuam    chamando-o de "El trem de la muerte".    Abra?o!|`|RggSdnvcaa	POR SIMON BOLIVAR|`|90639da891ee8125bef61caf6f9d7227aa	O Trem da Morte    Por que morte?  A verdadeira histria do Trem da Morte  ainda desconhecida at para ns. Muitos acham que o este nome existe por causa do risco em embarcar no tal Trem, porque vai morrer durante a viagem, mas n?o  bem assim. A histria que mais ouvimos  que o trem fazia transporte de doentes durante uma grande epidemia de febre amarela, que ocorreu na Bolvia h muitos anos. A epidemia passou (e o risco de ficar doente tambm), mas o nome permaneceu at hoje.    Para nossa surpresa, o trem  super bem cuidado (para os padr?es bolivianos) e bem mais confortvel do que poderamos imaginar. N?o passamos por nenhum perigo ou risco, nem com nossa bagagem. Das duas uma: ou tivemos muita sorte, ou essa histria de trem perigoso n?o passa de balela. Ou as duas coisas.    Embarque e acomoda??o    Se voc conseguiu comprar uma passagem no horrio que queria e n?o ficou maluco com a "organiza??o" da Esta??o Ferroviria Boliviana, parabns! Voc  um felizardo. Ns compramos passagem para as 15hs, o que  um timo horrio para viajar por alguns motivos.    Primeiro: o sol j n?o est t?o forte e o tempo estar mais fresco (o calor  infernal dentro do trem!).  Segundo: a previs?o de chegada em Sta. Cruz  ao meio dia do dia seguinte, o que  um horrio ideal para almo?ar, conhecer lugares e se preparar para continuar a viagem. Se tiver chance de escolher horrio, prefira a parte da tarde. A pontualidade tambm n?o  a especialidade dos trens bolivianos, mas  melhor mesmo chegar com antecedncia na esta??o.    O movimento de pessoas e cargas  grande, por isso n?o desgrude da bagagem e fique de olho em qualquer tipo suspeito encarando voc. Se se sentir acuado ou perseguido, tente ficar junto a algum grupo maior de turistas ( quase certo que v?o haver brasileiros ali). Com certeza voc ir se surpreender com o trem e ver que n?o  nada daquilo que voc imaginava.     Voc ficar aliviado em saber que h poltronas para sentar e que n?o h nenhum porco ou vaca sentados ao seu lado. Mas isso tambm n?o quer dizer que a viagem ser confortvel. Prepare-se para dor nas costas e para ter uma noite de ins?nia "daquelas". As poltronas s?o velhas e um pouco mal cuidadas, alm de muuuito empoeiradas. Mas isso  o de menos, se voc tiver tido o azar de pegar uma passagem com nmero igual a de outra pessoa. A desorganiza??o  tanta que s?o vendidos vrias passagens com o mesmo nmero, nosso querido companheiro Alberto foi o premiado e teve de discutir um pouco com os "outros" donos de seu lugar, um casal de bolivianos mal encarados. Afinal, valeu  pena: ele garantiu um lugar na janela. Para ajudar mais no desconforto, h os inevitveis solavancos. O pior  que n?o d nem para culpar a estrada toda irregular. Quem j andou de trem sabe que  assim mesmo, quando n?o se viaja em uma ferrovia bem conservada, o que definitivamente n?o  este o caso.    Um olho aberto e outro fechado    Ao comprar a passagem, voc tem a op??o de escolher com ou sem refei??o. Apesar das aparncias, ns recomendamos o rango servido no Trem. Lembre-se que a viagem ser longa (de 18 a 20 horas) e n?o haver nenhuma parada em um posto de gasolina. Garantimos que o gosto n?o  dos piores. O menu  varivel, mas sempre simples: um peda?o de frango, um pouco de arroz, um legume ou verdura. Se voc comprar uma passagem em um vag?o da Classe Pullman, talvez voc tenha a sorte (ou azar) de ter televis?o e videocassete. As vezes s?o cpias de filmes americanos com legendas em espanhol. Tor?a para n?o ter assistido ao filme ainda (ns assistimos ao Medidas Desesperadas duas vezes durante a viagem, porque eles n?o tinham outra fita e ficaram repetindo o filme a noite toda). Se n?o, tudo o que voc ter a fazer  (tentar) dormir. Se estiver sozinho, guarde bem a sua mala no bagageiro e, por precau??o, amarre uma ponta da sua mochila  uma corda e a prenda firmemente s barras do bagageiro. O melhor conselho : fique na sua. Se voc for bem discreto, ningum perceber sua presen?a e as chances de voc ser roubado ser?o bem menores. Relaxe e deixe a viagem rolar. Voc ser acordado bem cedo pela "ferromo?a" oferecendo um cop?o de caf bem forte.  partir da,  s curtir o resto da viagem. A paisagem  bem mais interessante e ainda fica melhor porque ser possvel enxerg-la (afinal, ser dia).    Quando desembarcar, confira toda a bagagem, deixe o passaporte bem  m?o (voc ir precisar). A esta??o de Sta. Cruz de La Sierra  pequena em compara??o ao comprimento do trem. N?o estranhe de ter de desembarcar no meio do "mato". N?o tenha pressa, para n?o esquecer documentos, mochila de ataque e demais perifricos que voc esteja levando. O Alberto, sempre ele, estava demasiadamente afoito para se livrar do p de seu assento que n?o guardou direito o seu dinheiro: por pouco ele n?o perdeu tudo no mato, ao descer do trem|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	N?o sei, porque ningum saiu vivo dele para contar.|`|NnyySMgZaa	a viagem  t?o longa, mas t?o longa que quando as pessoas chegam j morreram de velhice

Te recomendara que llegues una semana antes del carnaval. En esa epoca podes entrar a los ensayos de las escolas do samba que luego desfilaran en el carnaval y podes ver todo desde adentro.( sale de 2 a 10  raeles depende de las escolas )  Ademas se organzian blocos gratis  en la calle ( la tgente se reune en las esquinas a bailar y esperar el carnaval). En cuanto excursiones turisticas, el Corcovado ( te recomiend que no lo hagas en el tren para los turistas, ya que demora 3 hs), la manera mas practica es tomandote un taxi que te sale inclusive un poco menos, ( alrededor de 30 reales por persona)  y el taxista te va aparando en el camino para que puedas ir sacando fotos.  El Pao de azucar, el barrio Santa Teresa y las playas sn otras de los lugares que no podes dejar de concoer en Rio.  Suerte!  Si te interesa el carnaval  estas son algunas pag que pueden servirte.|`|XrPYmfq4aa	Rio de Janeiro es un poco peligroso pero si andas con cuidado no tiene porque pasarte nada malo.

Not much, if you ask me. Copenhagen is not really a place for sightseeing, more a place to go for "real" stuff. I don't find the sights of Copenhagen especially interesting - if anything, it should be the city as a whole; it's a very special city if you get to know it - therefore, a couple of years, in my view. The essentials, a couple of days, maybe.|`|DBONYpVkaa	My mother is German and my father is English, so I visit Europe about 4 times each year (I live in Australia now), and I often visit Copenhagen.

However, you might want to visit other Scandinavian cities. Maybe Oslo (easy to access by train via G?teborg or by a 16-hour cruise), and then from Oslo, it is only about a 6-hour train ride to Stockholm.|`|07ab852c995d3435bb3b1d221b24decfaa	A month or two.

Imqb5ueqaa	Our currency is "pegged" versus the US dollar only because the US is our single largest trading partner, and in fact the world's largest economy.     Having said that, you must realize what a "peg" is. A peg is only a reference, and we reference versus the US$ precisely because we trade internationally using US$.     We can theoretically "peg" versus the Singapore dollar, and this will not change the value of the peso versus the US$. Because traders will eventually check for the value of the Singapore $ versus the US$, and eventually see the relationship with the Philippine peso. To do this, however, will just add an extra step to arrive at the same thing.    A nation's currency will not be stronger or weaker only on the basis of this "peg", which has absolutely no effect on its value. The value is determined by market forces, by the need for certain currencies as used in global trading.    It is not good to artificially peg a currency at a fixed rate. Malaysia tried to do this before, but the local currency will eventually lose value in the international market, and will be considered play money at some point.    No one, not even the USA nor UK nor China nor Swittzerland can ever logically dictate to any market a fixed value for its currency.|`|440671856f7074f0a01e25747328de15aa	Honestly, that is the most stupid idea I've ever heard.|`|7BAjFHqraa	Its rated in US Dollar because the International Market is in US Dollar.

Exchange rate of any one currency with reference to any other currency reflects only the buying power, among the currencies and it has nothing   to do with the domestic economic prosperity of both the nations.    Example:  Assuming the same quality, say country A can buy 1 Ton of carrots from country B for 1,000 domestic currency. But B can buy  1 Ton of carrots from country A for only 500 of their domestic currency. Then the currency of country B has a double buying power than that of Country A. The exchange rate of  Bs money = 2 of As money.It has no relation to the internal economic prosperity of either country A or B.    Hope that helps.

It continued to warn in the second, third, and fourth week, that the war was far from finished. Israel stupidly halted the campaign, and the only possible reason for this was Obama's inaugration. Israel did not want to embarass Obama with too much pressure from the Islamist propaganda machine about the Palestinian deaths caused by the nature of the fighting and Hamas's deep entrenchment in the densely populated residential and commercial infrastructure.    Israel lost only 13 people - including soldiers killed by friendly fire! It could have withstood a much longer war. This could have ended in the toppling of Hamas.

One has to understand that it is urban warfare, and the Hamas and the other militants fight amongst the civilians. Olmert did minimal objectives to control the rocket fire.     If there is another campaign to topple Hamas I don't want to hear any liberal whining over the propaganda pics thru the media!  It is a necessary thing to do so the people in Israel and Gaza can have a chance to live in peace. Please check out the link provided below to see what kind of life Sderot residents have to live with 15 seconds to run and take cover and Palestinians live under Hamas and the other militants in Gaza have to live.  It really is no life at all.  It was by militant hands that opportunity for a normal life was stolen.  Palestinians elected Hamas knowing they were terrorists with a violent attitude of attack on Israel.  That's what happens when one supports terrorists and why we need someone like Netanyahu to free people from that kind of life.    15 Seconds in Sderot  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygb6VrW8W...

6WsTRKENaa	The occupation of ?stanbul and ?zmir by the Allies in the aftermath of World War I prompted the establishment of the Turkish national movement. Under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal Pasha, a military commander who had distinguished himself during the Battle of Gallipoli, the Turkish War of Independence was waged with the aim of revoking the terms of the Treaty of Svres.[4] By September 18, 1922, the occupying armies were repelled and the country saw the birth of the new Turkish state. On November 1, the newly founded parliament formally abolished the Sultanate, thus ending 623 years of Ottoman rule. The Treaty of Lausanne of July 24, 1923, led to the international recognition of the sovereignty of the newly formed "Republic of Turkey" as the successor state of the Ottoman Empire, and the republic was officially proclaimed on October 29, 1923, in the new capital of Ankara.    Mustafa Kemal became the republic's first president and subsequently introduced many radical reforms with the aim of founding a new secular republic from the remnants of its Ottoman past. According to the Law on Family Names, the Turkish parliament presented Mustafa Kemal with the honorific name "Atatrk" (Father of the Turks) in 1934.    Turkey entered World War II on the side of the Allies on February 23, 1945 as a ceremonial gesture and became a charter member of the United Nations in 1945. Difficulties faced by Greece after the war in quelling a communist rebellion, along with demands by the Soviet Union for military bases in the Turkish Straits, prompted the United States to declare the Truman Doctrine in 1947. The doctrine enunciated American intentions to guarantee the security of Turkey and Greece, and resulted in large-scale US military and economic support.    After participating with the United Nations forces in the Korean conflict, Turkey joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1952, becoming a bulwark against Soviet expansion into the Mediterranean. Following a decade of inter-communal violence on the island of Cyprus and the Greek military coup of July 1974, overthrowing President Makarios and installing Nikos Sampson as dictator, Turkey intervened militarily in 1974. Nine years later the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) was established. The TRNC is recognised only by Turkey.    Following the end of the single-party period in 1945, the multi-party period witnessed tensions over the following decades, and the period between the 1960s and the 1980s was particularly marked by periods of political instability that resulted in a number of military coups d'tats in 1960, 1971, 1980 and a post-modern coup d'tat in 1997. The liberalization of the Turkish economy that started in the 1980s changed the landscape of the country, with successive periods of high growth and crises punctuating the following decades.    Hope it helps!|`|wVJ1jAyJaa	Also see these:  http://www.turkishodyssey.com/turkey/his...  http://eeep.pspa.uoa.gr/pol-History%20af...  http://www.washington.emb.mfa.gov.tr/Abo...|`|h1IYS0dbaa	Read this    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...

Also get your best offer from the travel consolidator of your choice then compare the price for the exact same flight(s) on that airlines own website.

ciDR2kpTaa	Firstly, you need to figure out where in US do you want to live. There are plenty of states and cities/counties within these states to choose from. Once you figure that out. You should try to get a break down of your living expenses in that particular area. Then you need to get a job in America. Whatever money that you have over there. I am not sure if its Euros or Sterling. You should save it up then when you get over here you can convert it.     Do you know anyone that lives in America? If you do, you can try to stay with them for a lil bit while searching for a place or try rooming with someone. Depending on where you live you may need a car, I know from a veteran new yorker that if you live here in the city all you need is a Metro card and it will probably cost you more to have a car in NYC compared to a Metro card. I know you have to get a Visa, Passport, sponsorship perhaps. Eventually you have to get citizenship. I work with people who came from other countries so I will definitely ask them for you. One recently just came to the country. He lives in New Jersey with a friend.     Thats all I know, take care. Best Wishes!!|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	After you get enough money. You would need a Green card/Visa. Stating that you can work in America. Also you need to register as an American citizen. After you get this, you will need to find and buy a house. Also the fun part. Pick a state and city you want to live in. Go to grisliest.org for the USA and pick the state you want to live in, find the city and look at homes. Do research about the city. Like the crime, how much it cost to live down there, the weather (Say if you live in Florida you will get lots of hurricanes, California gets earthquakes *but I can't say this because I live in Missouri and last year we got an Earthquake, it was SO crazy, awesome experience* The mid-west gets lots of tornadoes.) Also make sure you have enough money to eat, pay for your home, get clothes. a car until you can find a job. The economy is failing so it is hard to get a job here, I can't even get one but a car and home should be easy. So that is what you have to do.  1: Passport, visa/green card  2: Find Home  3: Move and Get job  4: Start your life as an American    I guess it is ok living here...|`|hdNcvEq3aa	then come on over here :)    i am a girl on a mission please sign this petition :)  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|aVSHsX2Faa	get a job with an american company then, get a visa so you can go over and work over there for around 5 - 10 years before buying property.    since american companies are either laying off american employees and/or going bust, I wish you all the best!
7507585dba9eca5ef96cb88aa64b9436aa	You can if you want.  But if you want to marry a Korean guy, you have very low standards.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Sometimes, it depends on how open-minded the family is, or isn't. I've heard of a woman who was dis-owned by her family because she married a Japanese. It's not a stupid question. A Korean can marry anyone they want. I'm afraid you just can't move to Korea without a reason.They have immigration laws you must follow.|`|GXoQbjbLaa	Yes,koreans can definitely marry someone not their race...  it happened before and it will still happen...continuously...|`|TxftLriKaa	of course!  but, it all depends on their family & them  i'm half korea, and my dad is mix black/white/native american  many korean women marry american guys  but most korean men prefer to be with koreans  it is rare to see korean men with other race's    so, it's all a matter of their opinion. and your mother is wrong about them not returning. my parents have been married for 22 years almost ,and no one has any problem with them, my brother & i, or other mix familys. it's very accepted|`|pm2EeEgiaa	The answer is it depends.    Some Korean families allow their sons or daughters to marry outside their race and some don't. They think that it is a disgrace to the family if they have intermarried with other races.    Korean men typically marry Korean women, as well as Southeast Asian women (for poorer farming communities), while Korean women tend to be either married to a Korean or to a non-Asian foreigner.    Of course, in some other families, they just accept it as normal.|`|1XSbqfk5aa	korean guy are the ugliest guys in the world. please give me some of that weed your smoking. and who would marry a korean|`|zupacfZTaa	It's not true. I think your mom means that perhaps the individual family members opposed the wedding so SHE is not welcome with her family but that sounds very sad.  I know things have changed here a lot though!   I am an American woman married to a Korean man. We have two kids and they get so much attention for looking different in a good way.  I actually worried that it is not good to grow up always hearing everyone saying how beautiful you are so we have to let them know that it is more important to be beautiful on the inside.   Actually our kids are quite popular among their peers and their parents... sure they are good kids, but it is obvious we got some extra attention for their looks too!     The mixed kids in your family would certainly be welcome among Korean people here in the general public! Koreans particularly are kind to foreigners trying to learn the language. They may not consider them to be Korean since they do wouldn't know the language and customs, but they would treat them as kindly as any foreigner, especially when they show a genuine interest in learning about Korea! Next, since it is their mom who is the Korean, that should even be easier on this culture.   Koreans would not think they are bad for not knowing their mom's culture as they might if it were their dad who was Korean.   Koreans expect people to follow the MAN's family mostly, where in western families both the man's and woman's families tend to get more balanced attention.  (I admit I don't know much on Puerto Rico's culture though.)  Koreans tend to allow and even expect a Korean woman to follow the man's family culture whether he is Korean or foreign, but a Korean man marrying a foreign woman is a little harder on the relationship since Koreans expect the woman to follow the man's family culture and foreign women don't grow up with this idea.    As I mentioned I'm American with a Korean husband. Both our families are pretty traditional and stereotypical for the respective cultures too. (and we do have good relationships with both his and my families.) One thing BOTH our parents taught us is that divorce is just not an option once you are married.  That underlying belief in both of us carried us through to make it through hard times when we didn't understand each other.  That and a sense of humor on both our parts! Marriage is hard work whether you marry from another culture or marry the guy next door.  I wouldn't go out and deliberately try to marry someone of another culture though.  If you just want to come to Korea to find a husband, well, I'd be with your mom trying to talk you out of it!   There are plenty of guys of Korean decent who grew up in America who look Korean, but have more western ideas!|`|yxstrJ6Uaa	theres definately nothing wrong with koreans marrying non-koreans.  im korean, and my aunt married a canadian guy, no problem.|`|Gewo3Axyaa	yes|`|tf3Uebbuaa	heckk yeah!!|`|2gPrqvqHaa	No they cannot, it is in the rule books.|`|XJrsfzCLaa	of course! xD    well in every race  there are people who prefer staying within their own race, and there are also others who dont care at all as long as they find the person they can really connect with ^^    so really  if you manage to find the perfect korean guy to marry  he shouldnt care what race you are if he really loves you ^^  if not, then he's not really that great is it? ^^    plus  we are in a much more modern world ^^  who cares about race anymore?    but ya  I am chinese, and I love koreans too! xD|`|E5bDKyNyaa	First of all, the poster who said you can't move to Korea doesn't know what he's talking about, you're from Puerto Rico which means you're a US citizen, and Korea is going crazy to get US citizens to teach here right now -- there was just an article in the newspaper about how salaries in won are going up because they can't find anyone, and the requirement for the E-2 visa has been lowered from a degree to just two years of college.    There is not law in Korea that directly prevents Koreans and foreigners from marrying, but there are many laws that make it very difficult for them to do so, like I have a Thai friend whose stepfather is Korean, and she has to live in Korea on a student visa and is not allowed to work even though she's lived here for seven years and speaks Korean just fine. That is one example of how the laws here will make it difficult on the spouse and the child, but it is not outright illegal. It's much easier for spouses than it is for children or stepchildren.    So there is no law that would prevent your aunt from going back to Korea, unless she broke a law there, or is worried about her visa for Puerto Rico, or something like that. Sometimes Koreans get stuck on American soil because they are waiting for their green cards, and if they leave and go back to Korea, their progress can be ruined.    The main problems with marriage to a foreigner are from the society and the parents. Most Korean children obey their parents to the point of not being willing to marry against the wishes of the parents. So if the parents are racist scumbags, you're probably out of luck -- you'll probably break up.    Overall, I'd say try not to focus on nationality of your potential partner too much -- you could be disappointed. I used to think Korean women were so great, they seemed so friendly and beautiful, but then I had a few Korean girlfriends, and now I'm not really interested in dating Korean women ever again.

K1LldEykaa	i've seen some pretty old, Steven Hawking at age 65 looking guys walking around with some of the hottest pieces of *** I've ever seen in my life.    I consider my self lucky, I met my girlfriend when she was in the US, I was 18, in high school, no job, poorish, and kinda fat. She was 3.5 years older, half way through college, and Chinese lol.    She could've had anyone she wanted over here but she picked me, I simply did the small things that counted. You don't need money to make a woman happy just use your mind.    Now we are in china, living together for the next year. I still have no job and am not in college, but I put that off to be with her. She see's the potential in me, but were both young to be settling down and thinking about families.    If he has game, he can bag a hot girl. After that it's up to him, while spending the least amount of money, to wow her. Little gifts, cool places, good conversation. No fancy dinners needed, no diamonds, and no gold (but it sure as hell helps).|`|1LlhqADoaa	Do you have money pay for a check  when you have a date with her?|`|gWleYSuIaa	difficult -because you are obviously stuck on yourself (we know it's you) and that's the least attractive thing to Chinese women|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	No money, no honey.|`|AA11700517	First of all, the place doesn't matter.

He's going to need some type of income. You paint a sad picture. So in your mind he's going to go to China and just on looks alone get a girl? I got some OLD news for you, women are women no matter what country. You have to remember that many women in China are looking for a way to get out of China. Not all but many. The Chinese are very money driven. And Success driven. I spent time in China. The women are beautifully. Stunning in some cases. 2 of my 20 something (WHITE) friends have Chinese girlfriends. They are "OK" looking. But they have money. They work, and are ambitious. One of them just married his Chinese girlfriend. If you go to China and work and make some money you will be bale to meet and date Chinese women. They do like Americans. But if you think he's going to go to China and just drop in and strike a pose and the women will be all over him... I don't think so.|`|5d37d4f98abd6f19efdef6def4ace044aa	Is he Chinese? Does he have a degree, good job? If he is foreign, he will probably have no problem finding a girl. If he is Chinese, Chinese women seem to want a successful man, so he might have a harder time.

I live down South.  Now most people will now assume (Wrongly) that I am financially better off than one from the North.  Because the highest paid jobs tend to be In London.  But I am in Plymouth, Where the majority of people, like those up North live on Minimum wage.  Because people with money buy holiday homes and Retire down this way they forget we pay probably Minimum 140K for a mid terrace house with small back yard and no front garden.  Where they may pay 100K,  And pay the mortgage out of the same basic wage.  People do not realise that Devon & Cornwall have the highest Water Rates in the Country including London.  So I sometimes get annoyed when people say that we are better off down this way.  We are not, If anything we have the same money but higher bills.  It's like football, how many arguments about 22 Grown men chasing a bag of wind around a field.  There we go another one because I choose not to be interested in football.  But I don't expect everyone else to be interested in my hobbies?  Military Models and Swimming.

We all know the South is richer having London and the surrounding counties that benefit from large house prices and good life styles coming from city workers.  Im not saying everywhere down South is high end but it is more so than the North.   On the other hand the north is associated with terrace houses, mining,  lower house prices and low income.  Plus the cultural divide between tastes in food etc  Especially prevalent is accents .  And the weather is better in the south.    Having said that I do thing the north is on the up with cities like Manchester, Leeds and Newcastle. And with the credit crunch hopefully more family's will choose british holidays pumping money and more understanding into  the Uk and the areas.    But in the end i think there will always be a divide.|`|12a37bf38f7fb21bfefcd10a348ca1beaa	It goes back a long way.WHEN i was young, just prier to ww 2, i was told that Southerners got the best of every thing, while us lot up here got the leavings.When the war started,it all seemed to end, we all pulled together.After it was all over ,it seemed to return as the lads coming home after fighting, they found,housing,fuel,and many other things were not available up north, but major building programs were in full swing down south.They were told the area round the capital came first.I was too young to judge if it was true,but if it was it was not what the lads thought was fair.i lived in the london area a while and the people were great i enjoyed being there.It could be a case of the other mans grass is always greener.

The people I HAVE met from the south have always been really stuck up and boastful but I don't go off thinking "urgghh all southeners are like that".  I live in Yorkshire, my mum's side live in Nottingham and my dad's side live down south so we're spread out all down the country and we don't argue...well actually we barely see each other but still!|`|AZErtytoaa	As a Scot I see  the question as , not unexpectedly, being  sloppily phrased . Of course there is a North / South divide in England - has been for generations . They ( the Northerners ) make the brass and the Southrons spend / squander it . That it is the basis of divide . Bring the Scots into the equation and plonkers like wee Jerry ( I have a big car peep peep )Clarkson start throwing their half peny worth into the ring !

The main difference is the accents, food and slower/faster pace of life.    You cannot get gravy down south in a chippy, which i found mad, having a pie without gravy!!!!! but does not make me dislike southerners.    Up north is a slower pace of life and i love it, it was too fast for me down south but we all have different views.    The way i see it is, we as brits should all stick together and get along but the North/South divide will always be around.
sa8dElLZaa	it's an idiom.    something that you say which means that communication in an organization is bad so that one part does not know what is happening in another part.     Ex.:  I was sent the same letter from two different departments. I get the feeling the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.    In the Bible -  Jesus was criticizing those who gave to get the admiration or praise of men.    The point was "when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you."|`|EOZsYlZkaa	It is an English expression or idiom. It simply means that the person is confused, and usually is expressed when one is in a stressful position. For example, if a person has to submit two papers to two different professors at the same time, then the person is caught between researching one paper and the other. The"right hand" is researching for paper 1, while the left is researching for paper 2. Because your efforts are divided, nothing gets done.|`|LmKCdK43aa	It might mean that someone close to know, doesn't know what bad things you're doing. Because your right and left are so close.       But it basically means just sneaking around ;)|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	no, but think about how bad it would be if it where possible?    it is just an expression, perhaps it would make more sense if it said " one member of that two man team does not know what the other member is doing".    if you had to work with someone to get something done, you will need to know what the other was doing, so you would not be both working on the same thing.  you both have to plant a tree, you go dig the hole, then buy the tree. he buys the tree, then digs the hole. you end up with two planted trees. instead of you digging the hole, while he buys the tree.|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	It's a figure of speech which means that a person can be wicked without him realizing that he is unless and until someone points it out to him.     Or, it could refer to some thing other than a person, like an association or a group where the leader does not know what his members are doing behind his back.  The leader representing the body and the members, the different parts of the body.  Each part/member functions separately and differently from each component.    Yes, that is possible.|`|tcmaLqWFaa	That means there is a lack of communication and organization within an organization or group.  It's not a literal meaning.

Vlp50eEGaa	You are correct in what you say with one exception.  You say most visitors can entry Thailand visa exempt.  This is not true, the below website you will see the list of countries included in the visa exempt rule.  Thailand has a set of rules pertaining to each country, sometimes here people answer these visa question and think the rules for them to entry Thailand is the same for everyone.  You will see from the website that Brazil, the Republic of Korea and Peru are visa exempt for 90 days.  http://www.mfa.go.th/web/2482.php?id=249...       Here is a list of countries that require a visa on arrival:  http://www.mfa.go.th/web/2482.php?id=249...    You can also check out more information on visa at this website http://www.mfa.go.th/web/12.php    edit:  If it doesn't mention it then why read into it.

( Thailand is full of them )|`|3P1EEZGdaa	There was a question last December in which the questioner very kindly gave a heads up by posting the link below. What you say seems consistent with that.   http://www.csmngt.com/thai_visa.htm  This was the question: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  Myself, I prefer 60 day visas - there never was a 90 day per 180 days limit on them.    [Added: [previous edit deleted]  [Added 2 days later:   The more I look at this the more I come to share your confusion. As far as I can make out (I'm no expert) regular visa runs (i.e. people relying on the visa waiver rules) seem to be covered by National Police Order Number 778/2008 (2551) dated November 25th, 2008.   The idea that the 90 days in 6 month rule does not apply seems to be based on a comparison between National Police Order Number 608/2006 (2549) dated September 8th, 2006 and National Police Order Number 778/2008 (2551) dated November 25th, 2008.  The idea seems to be that whereas, apparantly (I can't read Thai well enough to know) 608/2006 refers to the 90 day limit  778/2008 doesn't and therefore the 90 day in 6m limit no longer applies.  That's an interesting way of interpreting it but the more important question is whether that's the way that Thai Immigration interpret it. And that I don't know.  I'm picking this up from the thaivisa forum where they have a thread on the topic.  http://www.thaivisa.com/forum/Unlimited-...  which looks like the place to keep an eye on for people's experience of the new rules.    If it was me I'd do 60 tourist visas from Penang for a few months until its clear how 778/2008 is being applied.]

In some places like Amsterdam its tolerated. Most of the people down there had already been smoking before the U.S prohibited it so it was already a part of their culture. It's pretty hard for police to enforce a law when the majority use it. Besides, they've probably got bigger problems to deal with than a couple of college kids smoking mj. For example, you're a police officer, who do you go after; the guy with the gun or the college kid smoking weed? The government also knows that it boosts their economy so they turn a blind eye. They just say it's illegal to appease the U.S
oAQib10naa	Kuwait is a relatively expatriate-friendly country.  There are many people who have gone there for employment, as only about 3-5% of Kuwaiti citizens actually work.  They hire out the work they need done.  There are also several military bases there that have companies contracted by the military to supply employees to take care of the jobs they don't have enough people to do.  Working in Kuwait is fairly lucrative if you can get a good job and not spend all your earnings at the souks on counterfeit handbags and watches.    I can't imagine that anyone goes to Kuwait as a tourist because there isn't that much there to see except along the waterline and the shopping malls.  There is no drinking of alcohol or even dancing in public allowed there.|`|m3ThrbDMaa	It's the hot chicks they have...(just kidding...)    There's oil there, Dude...

If you exclude the road trips things we did along the way and just did shelter, food, and gas, it would have been really cheap. We camped at KOA's, so it was at most $20 a night. Gas wasn't at $4.50 yet, it was between $2.50 and $3 and we stopped about every other day to fill up. For food, since we don't eat fast food, we usually ate at Subway because a foot long sandwich would give you lunch and dinner. So probably cheaper to drive.|`|RrEESD6Paa	Fly... but do your homework.

Check out the link below.|`|2Nu0kovzaa	YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL!|`|EamhENYJaa	Cost to fly:  roundtrip airfare, maybe $500 each person * 2 = $1000  if you flew there, you would need to rent a car while you are there.  If you drove there, you don't.  So to the airfare you need to add the cost of a rental car, which would depend on how long you are there. Lets guess $500.    Cost to drive 2500 miles:  depends upon cars gas mileage, but my car does about 300 miles on $40 of gas. 8 tanks of gas@$40 = $320  Assuming you drive 500 miles a day, that is 4 nights in a motel. The last night you are in new york, so that isn't counted.  It is exhausting to drive more than 600 miles a day. 300 is easy. 400 is okay. 500 is doable, but 600 is a pain multiple days in a row.  Average budget motel is like $60 a night. Plus you need to eat meals, so maybe another $40 a day, for a total of $100 a day for meals and lodging * 4 nights = $400    So it would cost at least around $700 to drive there one way.  But you would probably want to drive the car back so you would double that, so the round trip car trip would be around $1400.    Since you already have your car, you wouldn't need to rent one there.    So the costs might come out even, both around $1400.    But if it takes you 5 days to drive there and 5 days to get back, versus 4 hours to fly there and 4 hours to fly back, the time is quite different and it depends on whether you have vacation or what.     You need to put in your own numbers.|`|fukzl8oaaa	It would be somewhat less expensive to drive but will take many more days and you will have to eat and sleep.

It will take you longer but this is a once in a lifetime experience.  You must have a reliable car !!!!  You have to decide if the drive will will be worth the time and expense for the little you will save....  You have a lot of research to do before you decide.  if it is going to be a round trip and back to Calif I would FLY

CUMdhfKzaa	What part of Japan?    Japan stretches from the tropical Okinawan islands in the south to the mountainous, Canada-like Hokkaido in the north.    If you're traveling, I'm guessing you'll be staying on the main island of Honshu in places like Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, etc.    In that case, the weather will be mild at that time of year.  It's cherry-blossom season, so if you've got a loose schedule, watch the news and go to where the trees are blooming.  It's one of the most important events in Japan, and it's incredible.  Pink blossoms all over the place.

Domestic travel activity is increasing due to spring school holidays and the cherry blossom season.    The Golden Week, one of Japan's busiest travel seasons, takes place in the end of April and beginning of May. It is best avoided. Read more about the Golden Week.    The remainder of May is quite a good time for visiting Japan, as vegetation is lush and the weather is mild, but not yet hot and humid as in the summer months. Airfares are relatively low and many tourist spots are pleasantly uncrowded right after the Golden Week.    In Okinawa, the rainy season (tsuyu) typically starts in the beginning of May and lasts until the end of June.       Have a fun time on Vacation!  P.S.

CyP7VMHHaa	If all twelve are traveling together on the same flight, then you'll need to call a travel agent or the airline. Airlines normally consider ten or more people to be a group and have to be booked through their group desk. You won't be able to do it online unless you make multiple smaller bookings; if you do that, you risk that there won't be enough discount seats available on the flight and some people may have to pay more than others.    If some people are taking different flights, then you may be able to book them on your own.    Airlines sometimes offer discounts for groups, but it's not guaranteed that it will be cheaper than a published fare. If the fares on your route are already very low, then additional discounts may not be available.|`|RrEESD6Paa	I would recommend checking out BookMe.

e7576a139b6789e59e2195c707b6c228aa	There is no denying that yakuza tend to discourage disorganized crime on their own turf. However they do a lot of harm to society by selling meth and such. There are fewer yakuza nowadays because of the anti-gang laws brought in during the 90s, and the anti-yakuza citizens movements encouraged by police. Basically it comes down to everyone in a given neighbourhood stops paying protection money at once, and obviously the yakuza can't kill everyone in retaliation. There are also citizens groups that will sit outside a gang office and record everyone who comes and goes-this tends to drive them out as well. There are also new programs for guys who want to go straight. In the past it was tough to quit a gang, but now the cops help yakuza who want to quit to get new lives.|`|CUMdhfKzaa	Personally I could do without the yakuza, thanks.  I'm really not into bribery and blackmail.|`|INiQZKsjaa	IDK interesting question|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Mostly bad. They are organized criminal groups. Somewhat like the American mafia.It depends on who you are.|`|3xwFPL4naa	They are definitely not like police or anything good at all.    They mostly deal in illegal drugs, gambling, human trafficking (sex slaves and prostitution), smuggling, protection rackets (i.e. "pay us or we burn your store down"), extortion, etc..    They are not quite as violent as the mafia, but otherwise are basically the same thing.|`|USaK4A7Oaa	The romantic image of yakuza protecting the community, taking care of bad guys that the police can't catch, and living by a samurai code of honour, is based on movies.  Mostly they couldn't care less about these things. Most of their "work" (outside of legitimate business, which they also do) is really petty, boring things like DVD pirating, faking accidents, causing trouble outside a business until the owner pays them to go away, etc.    So basically, they're no different from your average range of businessmen & young punks, except that they beleive they don't have to obey the law.  I'd say that counts as bad.  But I still enjoy yakuza movies :)
Nxp9Ld3laa	I have family from Columbus, Ohio and I'm from southern Alabama. They have a beach house down here they regularly drive to. You can make the drive in a day. Gulf Shores, Alabama; Dauphin Island, Alabama; Orange Beach, Alabama; Destin/Ft. Walton Beach, Florida are all fairly cheap during the winter and have pretty beaches. Not too many tourists, not crazy like Panama City, nice local places to tour while you're there (i.e.- Mobile, Alabama, etc). You can also look into renting a bay house/cottage on Mobile Bay. Look up Fairhope, Alabama. Small, quaint resort town. Very visitor friendly. The Grand Hotel Resort is a beautiful, sprawling resort on Mobile Bay that has been around since the civil war. A little pricey, but totally worth it. Also, if you come to Fairhope in the next few weeks, you can check out Mardi Gras in Mobile, Alabama (a 30 minute drive from the Grand Hotel). Mardi Gras started in Mobile and is a little safer, more family-friendly than New Orleans. No way to relieve stress like catching some beads and checking out colorful floats.|`|7959WbC2aa	You could drive to Nashville in about 8 hours.

Visits in luxor, the valley of the kings, Deir el-Bahri, and medinet habu on the west bank, Karnak temple and the museum on the east bank. If you have any time left try valley of the queens and the valley of the nobles.  Aswan try philea temple. the island of kalabsha, its so quiet when there are no cruise ships there you will probably be the only guests. and do not miss the nubian museum. sadly the old cataract hotel is presently closed for refurbishment.|`|AlbJmy7aaa	Luxor has many temples but I only recommend the one at the end of town.. not the one with the light show in the center of the city.. its small and not very interesting. You can see much of it from outside anyhow.    Of course the valley of the Kings is what you would go to Luxor for. I had heard luxor had more hassle than anywhere for people selling goods and services, but I found it very friendly and cheap. the hotel was amazing for only 100 pounds.    Aswan has an ok bazaar with some more African stuff to buy.  I recommend going on a falucca trip from there though. 2 nights is perfect.

4V8nwOAvaa	New York Magazine has a nice set of free walking tours: http://nymag.com/guides/cheap/walkingtou...    If you want to do it independently then consider walking Madison Avenue to visit St. Patrick's Cathedral (Rockefeller Center is there too. I'd recommend going to the Top of the Rock for great views of the city). Then head up to MoMa for some art. Next walk north for Central Park.|`|AA10792562	Eight hours is a lot of time - don't limit yourself to just what's walkable.    I think Ground Zero is a must - just to see how big the area is.    Pick your favorite nationality for food - something you don't normally have - NYC has it all.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	OK, if you like to walk and want to get a good taste of the variety of the city, try this:    Starting at Times Square, (after taking all THAT in!) head north on Broadway, until you get to 59th Street, and cross over to Central Park.  Enter the park and head east.  You will pass a lovely pond, which you might recognize from many movies.   Exit the park at 5th Avenue, and head south on 5th Avenue. You will pass the Grand Army fountain, Plaza Hotel and Tiffany's.  FAO Schwarz is gone, alas!  Walk straight down 5th Avenue to 34th Street.  If you have money and time, take a ride to the top of the Empire State Building.  If you like shopping, head west to Herald Square to Macy's flagship store, once billed as the "biggest store in the world."  Then, walk back and continue on down 5th Avenue to Greenwich Village. 5th Avenue ends at Washington Square Park. Walk through the park, past the fountain, then head west, to MacDougal Street.   Walk south on MacDougal Street, and stop at the Cafe Reggio, one of the Village's oldest cafes. Have a cappucino and a pastry.  Continue south on MacDougal to Bleecker Street.   Head east, to Mulberry Street, and down through Little Italy and Chinatown. Eat dim sum in China town.  If you want to take the time, take the  1 train (ask someone) and get off at Bowling Green. Take a ride on the Staten Island Ferry, and come back again. (It takes about 20 minutes to cross the harbor, but watch the schedules: the ferry runs at different time intervals throughout the day and nght.)   If you want to (it still hurts me to look at it!) visit Ground Zero.  Go back to Broadway either on foot or by taking the train back to Canal Street and go back west on Canal Street to Broadway, and north again on Broadway, up through SoHo.  Enjoy the galleries and/or restaurants.  When you get back to Houston Street, (pronounced "HOUSE-ton") head west, and walk north on Sixth Avenue until you get to 10th Street.  you will see the Jefferson Market Library, which looks like a red brick castle. It is on the corner of Greenwich Avenue. Walk west on Greenwich Avenue, to 7th Avenue, then head north on 7th Ave. you will pass Barney's flagship store. By the time you reach 18th Street, you might need a break, so stop into McManus Bar on 18th and have a nice drink at one of NYC's oldest Irish bars. (Also seen in lots of movies.)  Walk west through Chelsea to 10th Avenue, and head north. Stop at the Empire Diner (open 24 hours a day) between 21-22nd Streets for fabulous non-diner food, and, if you are lucky, live piano music. It's a cool place for people watchers, too!  OK, you've had enough.  Grab a cab back to Times Square, or walk north on 10th Avenue to 23rd Street, east on 23rd to 7th Avenue, and take the subway north to Times Square.    This is an ambitious itinerary, so I'd suggest editing it by eliminating stops not of interest to you, and supplementing the walking with taxicabs, buses and the subway.    TIPS: Keep your wallet safe.  Do NOT buy a fake Rolex watch from the street.  Do NOT play card games on the street.  Walk with your head up, but avoid too much eye contact with strangers, unless talking to them.  Don't talk to..oh never mind.    Buses require exact change. Trains don't.  Tip cabbies 15% of the meter. No more, no less.    Wear comfortable shoes and very little jewelry, and above all...  Have a great time!|`|0QEeXzOEaa	go to m&m's world, the giant toys r us, and maybe the theatre|`|bc5128906f300cd5637719ffe4ba5ab1aa	Just about anything in NYC can be done in an 8-hour period.  And a lot is within walking distance from TImes Square.  Both the Empire State Building and 30 Rock are in the area, and you can go to the top of both.  I actually like Top of the Rock at 30 Rock better, because you get a great view of the Empire State Building and Central Park.  Both cost about $18-20 to go up, but it is worth it!  You can spend a ton of time just walking around Times Square itself.  It's one of my favorite places to just hang out - lots of shopping in and around - Macy's, Virgin Records Megastore, huge Toys R Us, M&Ms and Hereshey's stores, Apple store, huge World of Disney store - all close by.  Madison Square Garden is right there You can also get a 1-day subway pass that will get you all over - and to then ends of Manhattan Island where you can see other stuff - Ground Zero, Statue of Liberty, and other stuff that would take you forever to walk to, but takes no time to get there on the subway.    There is a tourism office in Times Square where you can get all kinds of info - 810 Seventh Ave. (bet. 52nd and 53rd Sts.)    NYC is actually a great city to go to with no actual plan other than to just go with the flow - you will find plenty to do!|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, may I recommend the following.

EOZsYlZkaa	At your age, and with kids, I always went to the shore. I cooked, shopped, cleaned, watched them from the beach, went to amusement parks, malls, Go-Kart arenas, mediated fights, the whole shebang. I'm now waiting for my grandchildren to be 8 and 10. I will personally take them on a cruise and let their parents go where they will. Had I known about cruises when I was in your position, I would have opted IMMEDIATELY for a cruise. On board activities are optimized for kids of all ages. There are the swimming pools. Food is available virtually around the clock. When the ship docks, you can be whisked off to a pristine beach for swimming and snorkeling. You can visit the rain forests (I'm talking about the Caribbean). You can inculcate culture to your kids, and when you reboard the ship, there is nothing to do but relax. In the evenings, you and your spouse can enjoy the entertainment while the kids are taken care of. THEY CAN'T GO anywhere ( and there are babysitting services available). Cruises, especially now, are much less than $500 pp for a week.

G2h8g2g1aa	You should take the bus to Reggie's, it's only $2.25 and the buses along State (which is only a block or so from your hostel) run 24/7.      Rosa's is a little more tricky, as you would have to take the Blue Line to Western and take the Armitage Bus west to Rosa's...which at night could be a little tricky or maybe not so much a good idea being unfamiliar with Chicago and all.  At worst you can take a cab from the Western stop, you'll see one.  A cab round trip will probably run around $20 each direction.
QEEweJUaaa	1st Class did not cost 4,000. - Where on the web-site is the conversion to 50,000?   For the Summer Season [Titanic sailed during the Intermediate Fare Season] each of the two Parlour Suites on B-deck were advertised at US $4,350, which would cost $90799.49 in 2006. See here: http://www.westegg.com/inflation/ For the Season at which Titanic sailed US $3,300.   The Minimum 1st Class fare was $130 US. That could be reduced to $115 if one took ones meals in the Restaurant and not in the main Dining Saloon.   Advertised Fare Rate examples: An outside single-berth room $300, a special stateroom on C-deck $450 for one passenger or $250 each for 2 passengers. Plus $50 for a wardrobe room and $175 or $225 for a private bathroom.     Just above the "supposed" cost of a 1st class fare is a bizarre statement: "The Titanic had 28 staterooms and suites for her 1st class passengers who mingled on the Promenade deck." - I am not going to even try and work out what that means. - There were depending on how certain rooms were counted [1st Class or 2nd Class] around 400 bedrooms in 1st Class.   Just below the "supposed" cost of a 1st Class fare: "Although due to the position of the 3rd class cabins the 3rd class passengers were trapped below deck during the tragedy." - 3rd Class had deck access. Then: "12:17 am: Third-Class passengers are informed to prepare for the sinking." - Really! - Very careless web-site wording.     The exchange rate in 1912 was linked to the gold standard. It was always close to $4-86US to the pound. That's why it's often given as $5 to the pound.     Personally, I think trying to express 1912 prices in terms of 2007 money is a pointless exercise. Too many factors have changed. Have a look at this site and see how complex the matter is.      Don`t forget, that in 1912 the UK was using what we would call today the "old" money. Back then, they would be using the schillings, threepence, pence, pounds, etc. It wasn't until the early 70's, I think, that the current pounds and pence system went into effect. Therefore the 5/1 exchange rate would be accurate for the time period.|`|94b8KImYaa	First class passengers paid a hefty fee for such service.

If you haven't thought about it before, now would be a good time to start.  What will be the net financial impact on them?  Is there child support that your dad pays that will be affected?   Is there other support that will change if you move out?  (SSI, for instance)  Will your mom's taxes be affected?  What about health and dental costs?  Insurance now and after you start driving?  If your grades become good enough, what are the employment prospects in the Lakewood area for high-schoolers?  How will your moving out impact your brother?  Have you been looking out for him or are you an example of what not to do?  A better school might help you to choose 'they're' instead of 'their' when you need to, but only if that's what you make your priority.  You can be uneducated anywhere.  Whatever you decide, you can still get to know your dad better.  Some things are too hard to put across face to face.  Write things down.  Use your skills.

The word is "With", not "Wit"  Second to all the people who DON'T live in California we DON'T call our state "Cali". That is a drug city in South America, and most Californians find that reference to our state insulting. We call it "Cal".    Unfortunately until you become 18 you will live with the parent the court has given primary custodianship, which seems to be you mother. You may not believe it, but you are much better off living in Arizona. The schools are better Job opportunities after you graduate are better.  California is suffering from the effects of the recession. Every thing is expensive, and things are only getting worse. That is why for the past 4 years there have been more people moving OUT of California than moving in.    You're only a 6 hour drive from your dad so you can visit often.

As for exact places I have heard Jamaica is an excellent destination for honeymoons as they have entire hotels dedicated to just married couples. The caribbean in general is a great place for relaxing and enjoying a honeymoon. If your budget is bigger then try Europe (I am assuming you don`t live there, otherwise the roles would be reverted), it's just great and also a great place for some excellent vacations.|`|hYJLs2NDaa	I would recommend Tahiti & Bora Bora in French Polynesia

GqTSa85daa	It does make one think, if just one had fought back, would the end be different.|`|6373b9cd46b6bcd2e6f18e3d6a5d41d0aa	First problem is that the pilot was responding to a flight attendant in danger.      The second thing you have to consider is that this type of terrorist hijacking has never been seen before.  ALMOST ALL previous hijackings were politically motivated and resulted in the passengers being returned to the authorities.  Also - never before have terrorists KILLED the pilot and assumed control of the aircraft.  The basic theory was that the hijackers needed the pilots.  This was a new one.      The third issue.  Once you've had your throat cut - you wont put up much of a resistance.  The other pilot was likely strapped into his seat - likely couldn't see everything that was going on - and once he became aware of it - he couldn't just release the controls to fight the attacker - which would of course result in the plane crashing.    This type of attack was never seen before.  I'm sure that the pilot, the copilot, as well as the heroes on that flight did everything that they could to prevent this from happening.  They are all heroes.  Let's respect them for that.  I think they did more than many of us would have done in the same position, with as little information as they had.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	By all means, rave on and show your total lack of comprehension.|`|BMkVOR0caa	You are a fu*king idiot!|`|wTG04eAyaa	If you have ever been in a fight deck .You will know how small it is ,you can barely stand up no matter about fighting back .|`|qmBE8DQKaa	I don't know where you got the information about a warning transmission cause I sure haven't heard about it. However, I tend to agree with you. No one in their right mind would let someone armed with only a box cutter take over the cockpit of a plane with passengers. Yet, since we really don't know what kind of weapons the terrorists were carrying, it's difficult to say how we would have reacted in the same situation. Something to think about...|`|RTxFNURzaa	the terroist held a knife to a flight attendants neck and threatened to killer her if she didn't knock on the cabin door get your facts straight|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	If only you were on that plane then and had all this information you'd have saved us all.    It's quite easy to look back 7+ years after the fact and say what you would have done; it's quite another to be "in the arena" at the time and have to deal with the circumstances right then.    I would also point out that airline security in America back then was slightly different.

AA11861533	Thank you for your care about China.    "Recently, over 2000 Chinese citizens signed the document below, released on December 10th, calling for human rights and democracy with an eventual end to one party rule. "    Charter 08 is that document, which was started by Liu Xiaobo.(still in prison)    Hope you could visit the website called "Fools Mountain: Blogging for China".   Check the link and you'll see the content and a hot discussion there.  http://blog.foolsmountain.com/2008/12/26...    Enjoy it!    PS I'm Chinese, and I've signed my name, too.|`|kZ8jIStBaa	Actually I heard about this Charter for the first time, and I'm happy that Chinese Intellectuals care about the country and people.

The signatories were prominent citizens inside and outside the government, including lawyers; a Tibetan blogger, Woeser; and Bao Tong, a former senior Communist Party official.

I was going through the link that he provided and some of the comments by the persons really touched my heart. http://globalvoicesonline.org/2008/12/15...    ...    ...    Today, finally I have signed, with my real name and real occupation. This is probably late, but means a lot for me. I felt hesitated before, although a am a freelancer, but i have my own conflict as my work requires me to register with the government every year. If they decide to investigate, it is a piece of cake for them to harmonize me.  I have tortured myself for days, getting myself troubled. If I really agree with the issue, whether i do it or not, the reasons are all valid. It is a matter of decision. For the sake of justice and leave the consequence behind is a choice, getting myself away from the trouble water is another choice, there is no better choice. The only different is about how risk. Everyone has to be responsible for his or her own heart. And my final decision is: if I don't do it this time, I will be regret in the future.    Ran yunfei, a famous blogger and one of the 303 intellectuals co-signing the Charter, talks about counteracting the politics of fear in under the authoritarian state:    ...    Some ask me, aren't you fear? Like everybody else, I do. However, my way of handling fear maybe different from others. Some say, your phone must be taped. I say, let it be (it doesn't mean that i appreciate the tapping. I oppose that, but my opposition won't make any different). When the issue touches upon public interest, what i say in the private won't be different from what i say in the public. Some say, someone may be tailing me. I say, I am not in that rank yet, even if that's the case, I don't mind having tea with the person, but he has to pay for his share. If you live according to their threat, you will please the state machine. They are most happy to see you live in fear, in anxiety without fun Respect your principle and trajectory, that's the biggest hit to the fear creator.    Tie Liu a 76 year old writer explains why he signed the Charter:    8... 08...    I am a 76 year old person, with my glasses on, I read the Charter 08 over and over for three times, then I decide to sign. I am number 57 in the list. In the Charter, it states: the Anti-Rightist Campaign (1957), the Great Leap Forward (19581960), the Cultural Revolution (19661969), the June Fourth (Tiananmen Square) Massacre (1989), and the current repression of all unauthorized religions and the suppression of the weiquan rights movement. During all this, the Chinese people have paid a gargantuan price. Tens of millions have lost their lives, and several generations have seen their freedom, their happiness, and their human dignity cruelly trampled.  All these are historical truth, I am a witness of the history, the witness of all the catastrophes.|`|Lx6TXgHKaa	You have plenty of answers, and if your intention was simply to seek answer, your purpose is solved.

NNTfENpjaa	Bro you are gonna love Colombia, it is wicked.  I grew up the first 19 years of my life in London, and here is so much better.  My city is Medellin, I know live with my other half of my family.  Really the only thing you need to know is a bit of the language as the majority of people here do not speak English or are just to shy to use it.    Both cities are very different, Cali is a lot smaller than Bogota but is way hotter, the girls in Cali all have amazing bodies, if you are a single guy.  Ihave many friends from Cali and it is a really good city.    Bogota has more action going on, it is a typical capital city it is massive, over crowded, lots of things to do.  In Bogota you will find a lot more tourists than Cali.    There are lots of hostiles and little hotels in Colombia, but the problem is the only way to find out about them is normally through word of mouth so having never stayed in one I will not be much help in that department.  Your best bet is to actually find a telephone number for Information about visitng Colombia and try and find out through a company.  There are loads of companies that are trying to promote the tourism here at the moment so finding a number should not take more time than searching a few pages of google.

If you are a poser, don't care to have friendships with substance, and you live your life worrying about how other people perceive you, you will fit right in living in LA. LA is one of the biggest cesspits of the country, really. Their is a reason that you will meet very few natives of the area, the smart ones leave. LA is very transient, high turnover of wannabees and a huge population of parasitic people who have to mask their low self worth by projecting a cocky/arrogant demeanor, such a joke. People here really don't value education, and integrity, which will become evident if you ever converse with them.Don't get me wrong, I have met a few good people there, but they were usually European, or from New England, and couldn't stand it.

uKWcgLLoaa	It is true about the WESTERN THIRD of the state (on the Pacific Ocean side of the Cascade Mountains, where the cities of Seattle, Tacoma, Olympia, Bellingham, and Vancouver, WA are located) that it is lush and green all year long (thus the term "Evergreen" for the kinds of trees that grow there.)    The EASTERN TWO THIRDS of the state, though (where Spokane is located), is quite different. Much dryer (including some semi-arid deserts) so the physical environment changes there much more over the course of a year than that in the western part.    Most of the state has nothing quite as dramatic in color change as you get in the northeast though. And as far as snow goes, the western third gets very little, the Cascade Mountains get a lot, and the eastern two thirds gets somewhere inbetween--as a general rule. There have been winters in western Washington with no snow at all, and others when it has been dumped on pretty good on three or four occasions over the course of the winter. But it usually doesn't stick around for long. The temperatures are too moderate. In eastern Washington, on the other hand, there have been some winters when the snow stuck around until spring.    Washington is one of the most diverse states in the country, so you can't really generalize about the geography, the topography, or the weather! But some of the greenest, lushest scenery you will ever experience can be found in western Washington--especially in north America"s only true rain forest--the spectacular Hoh Rain Forest--located on the Olympic Peninsula in the northwest corner of the state.|`|txNBG27Naa	The coast is considered tropical rain forest so yes it is lush and green.  We did have more snow than usual this January but it is now green again and rainy, rainy, rainy until end of April.

The pines and maple trees are just starting to bud and my daffodils are just peeking through the ground.

Otherwise, tough luck I'm afraid.    On the 2nd point, it makes no difference to seat allocation how many tickets you have and are not using. If three of you check in together and ask to sit together they will try their best to accomodate you. If you want a spare seat ASK, they may not help, but they may also.

But if you go off season, September to June, you will find everything you are asking for.
2FsNdcXEaa	Well since forensic sciences involve crime and civil aspects, I would definitely say NYC is a good place to go. Just so long as you know where you are going, I think New York City is really one of the safer cities.

I really love NYC, I have been to every state and my top 5 favorite big cities, in order, are:  1. Seattle  2. San Francisco  3. New York City  4. Portland  5.

fM7CwTwzaa	Mexico City can be a wonderful place to visit. I could spend a lifetime there and never get tired of all the magnificent arts venues, fun activities, delicious world-class restaurants, and blistering hot nightlife scenes. It's one of the biggest cities in the world, and with that comes an amazing diversity and something for everyone.    The suggestion of Teotihuacan is excellent: it's one of the most spectacular archaeological ruins in Mexico and there's nothing like climbing the Pyramid of the Sun early in the morning and then just sitting and watching the early morning mist burn away from the rest of the site. Spectacular place!    If you're into archaeology, there's also the Templo Mayor, the National Museum of Anthropology, and a slew of historical sites around the city and environs.     If you like kid-oriented fun, the Chapultepec Zoo is arguably the very best zoo in all of North America (worth going just to see the panda exhibit, though the new serpentarium is amazing). There's roller coasters in Chapultepec park, or you can head over to Six Flags Mexico and get your theme park fix. They've got a fun science and technology museum in Chapultepec too, and their Papalote Museum is one of the best childrens museums you'll ever see.    And that's barely the tip of the iceberg...|`|AA10042296	Teotihuacan is 25 mi northeast of Mexico City.  Xochimilco is 17 mi south of the city center.

Also, check out the Archaeological Museum.|`|kH0AsPfgaa	Mexico City is not as nice and safe as it used to be.  An escorted tour would be the best choice.  That being said, there are amazing things to do.    The National Palace is covered with murals by Diego Rivera. They are absolutely stunning and make political statements, but he was such an exquisite painter. Everyone goes there.  I don't know if it's "fun", but it's a must-do.      The Basilica of Our Lady of Guadelope is amazing as well. The Virgin Mary appeared there and people make pilgrimages there. The crowds and experience is overwhelming.    Take a trip to the ruins at Teotihuacan. The pyramids are impressive.  I'm not sure I'd call them the best in Mexico (I've been to many), but they are beautiful and worth the trip.     There are also ruins right in the city - I can't remember what they are called.    It's always fun to do touristy things like a fiesta or eat at an outdoor cafe with a mariachi band.  Or go to a Carlos and Charlies bar.   Enjoy!|`|QCN0VohQaa	Hello, I am married to a Mexican and go every year. In the city I would highly recommend the market at Coyoacan every Saturday. There are always fascinating crafts on sale and lovely food to eat and the occasional performance on the streets. In Chapultepec there are a few good places to visit like the zoo and the Museum of Archeology (museo de Arqueologia) and in front of the museum there is always a performance of the Voladores de Papantla (which is incredible - men flying down poles - it sounds weird but it's truely awesome).  Chapultepec Castle is good if you want some history, and La Condesa is a bohemian area full of cafes and funky shops and restaurants.     If there is anything specific you are after let me know and I'll ask my husband to give you low down on the best parts. We're going in 4 weeks and I can't wait!!    hope that helps a  little.
FCCkrhozaa	18 and 21.    For example the below hotels allow 18 year old's to check-in.

dpKntiZoaa	It depends on which ticket you buy to be honest    If you buy a standard single/return ticket (from the booth or from the machine, machine being 50 cents cheaper) without a date, then you have to validate it (stamp it) before getting on the train, so that it clearly states the date. The advantage of this ticket is that you can buy it in advance (although no price difference).    If you buy a ticket for travelling the same day, then you do not have to stamp it in the machine because it will already state the date on it.    The train conductor can and will check both kind of tickets, and especially on journeys from/to the airport, you can virtually guarantee getting checked. If your ticket does not have the date on it, then yes you will get fined, asked to buy a ticket from the conductor on the spot (a lot more expensive) or escorted off the train.    If you want to read about it, then you can do in English, on the official site here http://www.ns.nl/cs/Satellite/travellers... and specifically here http://www.ns.nl/cs/Satellite/travellers...|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Yes you do have to validate them if they are not already dated.

The ticket checker will come by and check your ticket to ensure it is more than a reservation.... if you have a Eurorail Pass he will want to see both the pass with the correct day checked off on the back page   as well as a reservation ticket.    Hopes this helps.... may want to re-word your question or be more specific.

If you want trips they are relatively cheap but I went up to the Trodos Mountains on a Safari which was absolutely awesome although a little expensive it did include a barbecue. We saw all the baby turtles on the beaches as well and went to a snake pit.  The food is relatively cheap and really good love Cyprus.  It is amazing.  the scenery is spectacular and the people are cool.  You should have a really nice time if you can move from Ayia Napa|`|9a7b9b80f412db25e4cb8d6d8786a735aa	Hi, Firstly Congratulations! Which hotel are you going into? i love Cyprus i have been going there for the past 20 years,(my neice's friend get's married in May and we went to look at the hotel she is gettting married in last year) Larnaca is lovely the shopping is fantastic all the big named shops are there, Plus the little boy will be able to watch the planes going into the airport.  Trips to the Troodos mountains are very popular, last year we found that Cyprus has gone expensive since joining the euro, but if you shop around you can find some good deals in restaurants we took euro travellers cheques from Co Op Travel for 100 euro cheque we got 97 euros back they only charge for the postage.  Go on a boat ride they are really good, and on most lunch is included. We also hire a car as driving in Cyprus is really good, so take your driving licence just in case you decide to hire a car.  If you want any more information you can email me.   Have a lovely wedding day.

ixOE0onnaa	InstructionsDifficulty: Moderately Challenging   Step1Decide if you want to become an English citizen or if you want to keep your current nationality. This decision is going to influence the type of visas and paperwork you will need to complete before you can move to England.   Step2Apply for a work visa or complete the paper work and other requirements to become an English citizen. You will need to complete these steps before you arrive in England. There are several different visa programs available. You can find details about these programs, about the steps needed to become a citizen and you can find all of the required forms online at the "Immigration and Nationality Directorate" website.   Step3Locate job opportunities before you arrive in England. After your visa has been approved you can start your job search. There are a lot of English online job services that you can use to find a job lead. You can also contact English employment services directly by phone. You will need a CV (British equivalent of a resume) and your visa information.   Step4Make plans to visit England for interviews and to find a place to live. You can use travel websites like "Travelocity" to book your airplane tickets, hotel and rental cars, or you can work with a travel agent.   Step5Work with a British estate agent to help you find a flat or a house.   Step6Set up a British bank account. Do this before you arrive to make your country transfer easier.   Step7Pack for your move. Space is a premium when moving to another country. You will want to pack only the things that you have to have. Ship these via an international courier. Realize that you may have to pay importing charges on your personal items.   Step8Complete required steps after you arrive in England. These steps include registering with the local police, completing paperwork for your flat, completing paperwork for your new job and setting up your new household.

I would research the US companies that have UK offices, for instance MANY companies are multi national these days, Ogorman is one, several of the life insurance companies, really depends on your skills, you also need to be VERY aware that things / life is very expensive in the UK [London is in fact dearer than new york] also you need to ensure that you have medical insurance, they are tightening up a LOT on people coming over for a visit and getting medical for free.    What are you skills and qualifications. Also not sure how you would get a working visa from the USA for the UK without an actual job??
KaP78IoBaa	Its on Friday for sure as the guy above states. Most if not all ot transatlantic europe-bound flights that depart on the afternoon or evening arrive at destination on the other day. I am also pretty sure that your arrival to Stockholm is also on Friday, as it must be a flight around 6 or 7 hours. The reason flights take more time east-bound than west-bound is because of the rotation of the earth, which rotates east-bound, thus favoring west-bound flights.|`|qdsVS1dDaa	SAS flight 946 arrives Stockholm at 7:50 AM on Friday, so you will be arriving in Russia on Friday as well.
