Okay, so I think i'm going to do my topic about the growth of a metro city and analyze how that compares to the population percentage below the poverty line. My question is how do I go about doing that?   Also, any other suggestions for a research topic dealing with cities/urban studies are welcomed. =)   Thanks!

20090304114331AAHTvK1	Environment;Global Warming	Are Spencer/Christy reliable sources?	They are two of the few contrarian types (Spencer more of a contrarian than Christy) with any scientific credentials.  Yet their track record has been absolutely horrid.  They manage a dataset of lower tropospheric satellite temperatures, which has seen a series of significant corrections to the global data, all in the upward direction and many discovered by others.  Several years ago, their data showed little to no warming.  Here is a record of their corrections.  I've only listead ones with relative significance (>= 0.1 C).  Most recent corrections are listed first:       http://vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data/msu/t2l...       “The net effect on this   change was to increase post-Oct 2005 temperatures slightly, and thus the global trend is increased by about 0.01 C/decade.”      “The new global trend from Dec 1978 to July 2005 is +0.123 C/decade,   or +0.035 C/decade warmer than v5.1. ”      “Preliminary results suggest trends could be very slightly warmer, but less than 0.02 C/decade different.”      “The net effect on the trend was   about 0.02 C/decade (more positive)”      “The net change in the overall trend was toward a more   positive value by +0.012 C/decade.”      Currently, their trend is about +0.13 C/decade.  Can that value be trusted, considering that it's still anomalously low compared to the rest and their poor track record?  Why do contrarians still promote this dataset?

I believe it and I'm not scared. I know we need to make changes but that doesn't scare me. Give me an example of how global warming is causing fear. Please, cuz as far as I can see the only ones saying it is causing fear are those who don't even believe in it - how do they know this?

I am specifically wondering about the metal spiral, not the entire notebook, and if the spiral can be recycled commercially like paper and cans.

20090304104159AARQM3W	Environment;Global Warming	Could Senetor Inhofe be the Next Jim Hansen?	Hansen is credited with being the first to predict the coming "Global Warming" when he claimed in the 1980's that temperatures in the future would be in a range from -2deg to +14deg from where they were then.      The current temperature is +0.6deg. or well within the range Hansen predicted, and was hailed by the believers as an accurate prognosticator of the climate.      Of course Hansen's predictions of cooling in the 1970's were forgotten about, or linked to other scientists.      Now Sen Inhofe is sounding the word over global cooling.  He is referencing researchers who see that "Global Warming" is going to be taking a 20 year break for warming.       http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?F...       If Sen Inhofe's predictions are shown to be true in a few years, will he be given the same amount of credit for being able to see the future like that bestowed on Hansen?
20090227073549AAr6fgN	Environment;Global Warming	How come using 1998 or 2001 is cherry-picking but using 1900 or 1880 isn't?	It's warmed a little more than 1 degree F since the end of the Little Ice Age - a multi-century period featuring relatively cool temperatures.          And it's presently cooler than it was during an unusually hot El Nino year a little more than a decade ago.      Neither example is more of a cherry pick than the other.
