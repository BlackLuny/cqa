AA10729675	What do you mean by soul searching?  We always think that we know what we are doing.  But our subconscious mind has another agenda.  Sometimes or rather most of the time, we are doing something for a reason which we find logical, only to find out that it was not the thing to do.  Yet, by the same toke, we find something else that we were not looking for and which is exactly what we needed at that very moment, or that we will need later.|`|AA10217752	I'm looking for my real purpose on earth and what this life is really about.|`|yKGPbcx9aa	meaning|`|mJsixV6Oaa	Guinness Stout|`|W0Wk89Iaaa	the answer is in the question young grasshopper|`|XAvIAFcIaa	it really depends on the purpose of what you are looking for... others want meaning while some, answers which eventually lead to another question...what. usually, when a person finds what he or she is looking for, another query pops out. we have a mind that is full of dynamism. so, your question leads to another one... in what context?|`|AA11758665	an answer.|`|vKKVqnWvaa	to find the real me...why i am living? what is my purpose on earth? why did god create me the way i am?
zMcHYQeBaa	I think it is better dying that way than from cancer or some other painful way.  <br>  <br>  I'm ok with it. It is humane as long as they are really guilty.<br>  <br>  I don't feel strongly one way or the other.|`|AA11442722	The whole purpose of the death penalty is to make sure that the executed never does it again. As such it should only be applied to people we never want to see possibly released ever again. It is also used in emergancies where drawn out trials, incarceration and such are realistically not possible. <br>  <br>  I feel we are using the death penalty incorrectly for the most part. The guy who off's his wife for insurance is a despicable person but hardly the monster somebody like Dahmer or Bundy. <br>  <br>  The insane and retarded are incapable of being reformed. Yet these are people we exempt from the death penalty. Why? Whether or not they understand what they did, they did it. These people will never understand what they did by deffinition. So if ever released they will do it again. The next time it might be your spouse, child, sibling or friend that dies. <br>  <br>  The guy who kills a cop, why is that a death penalty offense? That makes no sense. They killed an armed opponent and all too often either contributed to their own death and or caused it. <br>  <br>  A person who intentionally kills a child, especially those who sexually abuse children, that is a person we never ever want on the streets again. <br>  <br>  Life in prison doesn't mean life in prison. Manson and his family for example are actually eligible for parole right now. Not that many years ago several death row inmates escaped from Texas. Death row in most states is the most secure part of the system. Escape is always possible. What if Bundy escaped? How many women would have died?  <br>  <br>  So in my opinion the death penalty should be reserved for especially heionous crimes, serial killers, people who kill children, those who cannot possibly be reformed and who pose a serious danger to the public. <br>  <br>  Special circumstances where deadly force is necessary. Desertion by a soldier during time of war, in times of martial law caused by a disaster but only in the imediate disaster area and only while normal operations cannot be maintained.|`|AA11488628	why should we pay for someone to live better than most of us can afford for the rest of their life. it is better retirement that is for sure. i think if you get life you should just get the death penalty. i don't want to pay for 50 years of someone else's life. sounds cruel and all but when people purposely do stuff to go to jail because it is better than what they can get on their own. we have big issues.|`|aBDr4XIIaa	I'm not sure about the morality of it, but I think it breaks the 8th amendment, which prohibits cruel or unusual punishment.|`|FLC21bQOaa	I am against the death penalty. I don't believe life is sacred or anything great at all. Though it seems many people seem to think of justice in terms of retribution I don't think any reasonable ethical system can be used to justify retributive justice. Reasonable approaches to justice would be deterrence, rehabilitation or isolation. <br>  <br>   Death penalty can only attempt claim superiority as a means of deterrence. The threat of the death penalty is supposedly considerably greater than life imprisonment and thus it is a stronger disincentive for committing capital crimes. This seems logically intuitive, perhaps everyone has a gut feeling that the death penalty is a deterrent. But consider that arguing that the death penalty is a good deterrent implies:<br>  <br>   1. Some people make a cost-benefit analysis of murder vs punishment and decides murdering someone is worth the chance of being imprisoned for life<br>  <br>   2. These same people are likely to change their decision if death penalty replaces life imprisonment.<br>  <br>   From statement 1 it is evident that these individuals are irrational, how can we expect them to carry out 2 if they're not rational?<br>  <br>   But if there is still doubt, consider also relevant empirical evidence. As you can see from the first source below, there is evidence for the existence of a deterrent effect and there is evidence against it. All in all, it is quite inconclusive. The burden of proof should be on the proposer of the death penalty to show conclusively that it does have a deterrent effect. <br>  <br>   The death penalty as a means of isolation is hardly a claim. It is competing with the cheaper life imprisonment option and the reality that some convicts may have been innocent. The one argument that the death penalty is marginally more reliable (dead people don't get pardoned or break out of jail) is crushed by the fact that applying this principle is tantamount to punishing people for crimes they've not committed. <br>  <br>   As rehabilitation, well the death penalty is just plain useless, but so is life imprisonment. But in the final analysis, life imprisonment has some merit which always supersedes that of the death penalty.|`|W0Wk89Iaaa	As someone who questions the morals of god i cant pretend to tolerate the morals of thos who play god.

The most dangerous should never be allowed out on the streets again.  Looking at the death penalty system in action I found many disturbing and surprising things.  Sources below:<br>  <br>  Most disturbing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.<br>  <br>  A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative. <br>  <br>  Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and, for the worst criminals, spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty. <br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.<br>  <br>  The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?<br>  <br>  Unless you ignore all these things, it is hard to support the death penalty.<br>  <br>  Sources:<br>  <br>  Death Penalty Information Center, www.deathpenaltyinfo.org,  for stats on executions, reports on costs, deterrence studies, links to FBI crime stats and links to testimony (at state legislatures) of victims' family members.<br>  <br>  FBI   <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/table_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/tab...</a>  <br>  <br>  The Innocence Project, www.innocenceproject.org<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcosttestimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcostte...</a> page 3 and 4 on why the death penalty is so expensive<br>  <br>  And, for statements of victims’ families:<br>  <a href="http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statements.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statement...</a><br>  www.mvfhr.org and www.mvfr.org|`|JpfBoRggaa	it makes us murderers. <br>  <br>  we could LOBOTOMIZE the offender, couldn't we?|`|2scdUqkMaa	Totally in favor of it.

y8bFwXZEaa	Ethics and morality deal with possibilities, not with impossibilities or improbabilities.<br>  <br>  Would I let a Martian vote? See what I mean. Show me a Martian, let me evaluate the specifics, such as whether a Martian--or a robot--can become a citizen, and then I might have an answer.<br>  <br>  Zombies don't exist, so thrashing out the ethics of using them as labor is an exercise in futility. No answer is correct, no answer is incorrect, because Zombies don't exist--not as the brain eaters you describe.<br>  <br>  Zombies do exist in Haiti, but they are humans who have had the oxygen to their brains cut off for too long and therefore they have brain damage--caused by witch doctors' potions. I would let THOSE zombies vote if they had sufficient mental capacity.<br>  <br>  Exercises in ethics that have nothing to do with reality as it is at the moment are exercises in futility, and defeat the purpose of ethics.

Even if a robot where to function like a human, i wouldn't give them any rights whatsoever. i'm all for dominance of my own species. Animals should have fewer rights then humans, and robots should have even less. they are expendable crewmen, even if they can function like a human. <br>  <br>  2) first of all, of course you would need to create a separate working space for the zombies separate from the people. But i would only deem it unethical if i had to feed them humans.  aside from that, they would basically be like assembly line robots that we use today.

2JOes8EJaa	You should call and ask to make sure, but I don't think that they are "negiotable", per se; you can't haggle over the price. <br>  <br>  BUT... if you have a specific model in mind and can find it online for a better price than Guitar Center, they will match that price. It has to be from another retailer, not something like eBay, etc, but if you do a little bit of research then you can definitely save yourself some money!<br>  <br>  In my experience, the employees are happy to be able to give you a better deal, they just have to check things out and make sure they're legit. If you can, bring in a print of the web page where you found the better deal, or at least write down the URL (the specific website address). <br>  <br>  Good luck!
07b414f45102f96335d9c9eb23079faaaa	I haven't read it, but I did go to Amazon.com to check it out and came up with two books with very similar titles and different authors. The first was:<br>  <br>  Field of Fire (An Alex Duarte Mystery) (Paperback)<br>  by James O. Born (Author) 2008<br>  <br>  There are 8 reviews - half liked it, half didn't. First link.<br>  <br>  The second is:<br>  Fields of Fire (Mass Market Paperback)<br>  by James Webb (Author) 2001<br>  <br>  It has just over 90 reviews and was rated either 4 (9 gave the book this) or 5 stars, which is very high. This is a novel with Vietnam as the backdrop. Second link.<br>  <br>  By reading the reviews it might give you a better idea about purchasing. Also, using Amazon may save you some bucks if you can find a nice copy for a low price.

EcgO4dlnaa	First thing to do is be in as many plays as you can.<br>  I know how you feel. <br>  Whenever I try to tell my family and friends something serious they just laugh in my face. <br>  It makes me feel horrible and stupid and like an idiot, but the key to getting them to actually listen to you is perserverance. <br>  You can't give up on your dreams because the people you look to most don't take you seriously. <br>  To be honest I almost gave up. Attempt after attempt they just kept laughing in my face. But I didn't give up and I finally sat my parents down and said, " Mom, Dad, I really enjoy acting and I want to start taking it seriously. This means a lot to me and its my dream to become an actress. You have laughed in my face time after time and I just let it go. But I have put A LOT of thought into this and I KNOW that I want to do this. I am ready to take on the challenges of acting. I understand that it isn't an easy business to get into but I am willing to take classes and find an agent and I am ready for rejection. I know that I will have to keep trying and I will never give up on my dream. I want to do something that I am passionate about and sports is just not my thing. I know that it may be your thing but its not MINE. I want to do something that I like. I enjoy acting and I think I am good at it.<br>  I want you to get me acting classes. This is my future. Acting is just who I am."<br>  <br>  Of course some of the stuff sounds disrespectful but I said this with full respect to my parents  and they agreed to get me acting classes and help me get started in the acting business. <br>  You can't let them or your friends or anyone get  the best of you. If you know that this is your future then go for it. Don't let anything/anyone stand in the way of your dreams. <br>  <br>  As for your friends if they laugh in your face, just walk away and don't take it to heart. When you become famous and rich you will be the one laughing in their faces. But if they are real, true friends they will support you all the way. <br>  <br>  Also if sports aren't your thing don't go for it. You can't be forced into doing something you don't want to do. <br>  <br>  <br>  Remember ALWAYS follow your dreams and ALWAYS persevere.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck and I hope to see you on tv one day.<br>  I am sure you can make it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lots and Lots and Lots and Lots and Lots of Love<br>  <br>  xox Devon xox|`|EyAAFfaMaa	Just say,"Look, I'm really into this. I have a passion and I'd like to pursue this as a career. I'd appreciate it if I had your support." If they laugh, just remain serious and tell them this is what your really want. Hopefully, if they are really your friends, they will be okay with that. Your family needs to have your back, 100%, and they'll support you in whatever you do. The money & costs of being an actor, however.....they may not be too keen on that one. <br>  <br>  From then on, there's a whole lot of things to do, but that's another question.|`|T57AqnEOaa	So. Theatre is a lot like a sport. Do you think your family and friends will hate you if you join theatre? Why does everyone think of theatre as "dirty" these days?|`|jaOEtAHKaa	Pretend something that u r not... and let ur folks know how good an actor u r.... lol|`|12EuomC9aa	I recently experienced the same thing. But what happened to me was that  my chorus teacher called home and asked me to do this singing contest thing - but thats completely besides the point. Well first you should try to join the play in your school then they'll get some type of idea, then look online for auditions for jobs (i usually go to playbill.com and click job listings on the left hand side of the page, but thats if you wanna b on broadway. Well once you find one, ask your parents if you can audition.<br>  <br>  I was really afraid too cause my family's also really sporty, but that wont matter because they love you and whatever you do, they will still love you. And if they dissaprove, its ok! My dad says theater performers starve cause they cant get jobs LOLLL and i ca n think of so many examples of the opposite of that. Just find your way point, and go to it, just because there are obstacles dont mean you have to quit! Just think of telling your family as an obstacle!|`|3OlUzzumaa	I have the exact same problem. I have loved acting since I was a little girl and began modeling when I was 3 years old. Then my grandfather died and my mom was so upset she pulled me from modeling and because my parents look at acting/modeling and all they can think about is relating that to my grandfathers death it is now looked down apon.  <br>  <br>  Everyone said just tell them you want to be an actor but it's not that easy. Many think you will not be able to do it and that sucks. I'm homeschooled so getting into drama is not that easy when you don't even go to high school. I've told my mother I'd love to start taking drama at my local high school and she said ok then just brushed it off and she never talked about it again. I guess what I'm trying to say is its hard when you don't feel like the people around you think you would be able to do something you love so much.<br>  Best of luck to you,|`|aBDr4XIIaa	Get involved in drama.

4enIARchaa	yin and yang?|`|or5cvCv3aa	The symbol is Yin & Yang, can be used for many things, to represent friendship, male & female, God & Devil, Good & Evil.  etc.  It is the light and the dark co-existing, as one, in the universe.|`|1d507336cec07bb5de66eaa1d833d29caa	It looks like a yin yang.|`|GOMSOo9Daa	most definitely the ying yang sign|`|u0STM63Baa	Yin & Yang..<br>  <br>  and also used in poke man up to my knowledge..|`|dcovK6oqaa	black and white|`|EGcMzg0Paa	ying and yang|`|AH8gMq5Saa	the sign is the yin and yang<br>  <br>  it shows the balance between women and men and the balance within the natural world<br>  Yin-yang is a dynamic equilibrium. Because they arise together they are always equal: if one disappears, the other must disappear as well, leaving emptiness. This is rarely immediately apparent, though, because yang elements are clear and obvious while yin elements are hidden and subtle<br>  <br>  they also show opposing elements<br>  Yin yang describe opposing qualities in phenomena. For instance, winter is yin to summer's yang over the course of a year, and femininity is yin to masculinity's yang in human relationships. It is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite<br>  <br>  they transform each other<br>  Like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky - an intrinsically yang movement. Then when it reaches its full height, it will begin to weaken, and eventually will fall back to the earth in decay - an intrinsically yin movement. Yin always contains the potential for yang, and yang for yin<br>  <br>  they are rooted together<br>  Since yin and yang are created together in a single movement, they are bound together as parts of a mutual whole. A race with only men or only women would disappear in a single generation, but men and women together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive.The interaction of the two gives birth to things the woman (yin)<br>  <br>  the girl is yin and represents coldness and nighttime<br>  the boy is yang and represents warmth and daytime|`|tMr5uPMsaa	Yin & Yang.

qXAvXHdYaa	First, I think that you've learned a valuable lesson the hard way.  It was probably a better idea to have paid a professional to shoot the wedding.<br>  <br>  Length of time for deliverables depends on what the client orders and how long the process takes for the products to be made and shipped.  I agree with the others that generally prints should not take more than a few days, if no extensive post processing is required.  I can get 24 hour turnaround on an out of camera JPG image, no problem.  However, if the bride/groom has had "bad day" and their complexion is not its best or their hair didn't cooperate or they had an clothing mishap and want me to fix it, then I might need a few extra days for working through that.<br>  <br>  If you ordered other items from me, like say a gallery wrap or an album, then getting that prepped and sent to the printers, constructed and shipped to me, could be a week or two.  Not to mention that if the client wants to have final approval of the images in the album, then there are meetings to be had and possible reworking.<br>  <br>  This could be a few weeks.<br>  <br>  Overall, I think that 2-3 weeks would be the absolute most that you should have to wait to have all the finished products in your hands.  If it takes longer than that, you should have good reason why - something needed to be sent back, reprints, lengthy approval processes between photo studio and client.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to hear that you are having a hard way with this.  Good luck!|`|pZGLhV2Waa	A week maybe two before you see them on either a disk or online. The same applies to photo books and prints. You should have them within a week maybe two of ordering them. My printers have 24 hour turn around on most prints so my clients should have them about 2 to 3 days after ordering them. Books take a few days longer.<br>  <br>  Four months is way to long. I would be getting ready to sue the guy. With digital it really doesn't take that long.|`|i5OVORXgaa	Wow... 4 months is a really long time! That's not normal at all! Did you discuss the time frame with him before you paid? Is it in the contract?<br>  <br>  The photographer that I assisted for generally took 2-3 days.|`|0qYY7cdzaa	What did the contract say?<br>  A week is good, two at the most. His time is up contract or not.|`|uXHnwqxjaa	What did you agree to?  Got a contact? Invoice?  4 months is way too long.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	I get most of my images on line within 48 hours of the event|`|162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	A week is more the norm, probably more than that if the photographer is working another full time job.  I have them ready in a week almost always, never more than two weeks.   (I do work another FTJ)  Four months is long enough.  Not trying to scare you,  but taking that long makes me wonder if something has gone terribly wrong.  I think it is time for a serious chat with the photographer.  Perhaps he is just really slow at post processing work and snowed under with other obligations.  Good luck!

YUkwTD2gaa	an abstract journey... i would probably do something like a "personality" or "maturing" journey of you or someone else, to show how much someone (or yourself) has changed over the years. i think it could be really interesting, because you can do anything and there aren't any limits. <br>  <br>  or show how your thoughts can develop, like from one thing to another, and then builds up into something completely different. but you can choose on what your thoughts are :)|`|DvjX2DFKaa	Try the Australian outback. The journey from Alice to Darwin, the pictures of the Australian deserts are wonderful.<br>  Or if it's not a physical journey, then the Abstract journey of a refugee from a war torn country to a peaceful life.|`|Pdex43zgaa	Abstract Journey<br>  <br>  Sounds like someone on an acid trip (LOL).<br>  <br>  Or, it could be that you are going somewhere where there is a lot of lights, colors. Lets say, into the city. <br>  <br>  You could ask a friend to drive you into the city and back, and on the way take pictures of interesting things you see. It could be anything. <br>  <br>  When you return, create a series of abstract drawings/paintings whatever out of the photos.<br>  <br>  This will be your project. Now, get the auto fueled up and get going.|`|OouhYyyuaa	How about a series of pics of things that would transport you on a journey but not being used in their correct place, like a ships and boats in a traffic jam sailing down the road, or a planes moored up at docks or sailing, or a tailback of cars in the sky?<br>  <br>  How about a series of pics the journey through the human body, could do lots of biology type painings or drawings?<br>  <br>  Ooo how about a long long landscape pic that starts with stoneage drwings, woking through history, telling a story and each era blends into the next ie cave man blurring into egyption paintings blurring into roman paintings and so on up to modern day styles?<br>  <br>  How about imagining what an animal might see in a day, like a cat, could do some cats-eye-view of life, everything looks big, climbing a tree, playing with a toy, scrathing the sofa lol, with the cats paws in view for the only give away?|`|i25lAsLtaa	I love it when a book or a piece of art takes you on a mental journey. It's so much more colorful and fantastic in my mind than any literal journey could be. A piece of my imagination is set on fire and I can make it spread. We've gotten so used to movies and entertainment doing all the work for us that I think it would be nice to show a way to take that journey on our own again.|`|yNYUuT23aa	draw objects connected to your theme randomly as preparation. set these drawings out infront of you and start your abstract journey.
FLC21bQOaa	No. We'd always find a reason to kill other people.|`|8891f12e3b80bcc7c7aec7f94acdb8ccaa	To be honest, no. It's my opinion that religion is merely a lever used to manipulate public sentiment in support of a war that is really fought for economic reasons. If there were no religion, then we would just fight wars over values like, Truth, Justice, Democracy, etc. You can see it going on today. Why is the US in Iraq? The official story is to defend democracy, but if you follow the money, asking the question "who benefits?" a very different story emerges.|`|v08bg6inaa	most wars and bloodshed have been for selfish conquests. alexander the great, hannibal, justinian, napoleon... just to name a few.<br>  <br>  however, i think the holy roman wars was a bad idea.. ha ha. hence the vicious plague after-wards. not to mention muhammad telling his followers to give non-followers of islam a choice, "convert or die."<br>  <br>  so you may be right, but most of these acts.. i believe, just carry the religious label. and are not what most religions (mostly christians) are set out to do.|`|xi9YtImfaa	No, people would have just found something else to fight about. We must also never forget how religion has inspired peace. Martin Luther King Jr. taught civil disobedience and he was a reverend. Ghandi helped lead India to freedom without starting a war and was a very religous Hindu.|`|gOwakeM1aa	I think because there there are so many different religions in the world has been the cause of the bloodshed...like muslims against christians, and Islam against the Jews.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Maybe a little less, but not much.<br>  We humans have too finely developed a sense of 'us & them' <br>  to go without conflict for long.|`|7gpAdJGaaa	NONE THAT MATTERED|`|W0Wk89Iaaa	No, as much as everyone loves to blame religion for war, the truth is most of the time the government makes the war about religion to turn the masses in favor of the war. If religion didn't exsist we would have a diffrent controlling factor like patriotism. Patriotism actually worked really well for alot of european wars where everyone was christian. the 100 years war, henry V/agincourt (forget name), world war 1, world war 2 etc. really anything the masses believe in strongly enough can be turned against them. example: george bush made the war against terror about peace and freedom two things that have nothing to do with war.<br>  <br>  exactly what ralph-57 said|`|0gCfxj2Qaa	There'd be less bloodshed, but its in most animals instincts to fight for power and dominance/ territory. People will always kill each other. But without religion, there would be a significantly less need for war.|`|Om7OhWRUaa	I think that some form of religion is inevitable given human nature, but to answer your question: no, not really. We'll always find something to fight over. Religions are just these same things in codified form.|`|AA11488628	nope. religion was just how they rationalized doing what they did.

HUDjXVOyaa	Art helps people to adopt to new sistuations. Art is not only about self expression. People can share a common identity through art, like in an African Tribe. <br>  <br>  Communication. Art is like a universal way to communicate. For example if you travel to another country and can't speak a single word in the language spoken there, you can draw a picture and people will recognize what your trying to say. <br>  <br>  Art can be used for healing. Mental Health. Art Therapy is a powerful medicine use with trauma victims, like people who have been abused or in a horrific car crash. It allows them to bring out feelings and words hard to explain verbally. "A picture says a million words." Instead of carrying those bad things inside of them, they bring it all out in a peaceful way that won't physically hurt others. <br>  <br>  Arts can increase creativity within a community, encouraging growth and help it form it's own unique identity or culture. <br>  Art can also bring Tourism into a region or town, helping other non-art related local businesses to grow too. It is like a domino effect.  <br>  <br>  Many artists I know believe in something greater than them selves. That is why I think Art is not just about self expression, it's about helping others too. My friend just donated a painting based on the idea of healing to a hospital fundraiser. <br>  <br>  That is why I think Art has great purpose.|`|dcovK6oqaa	To expressed yourself  about life.  How you feel sometimes. art is very important because it educates us to be more observant with objects, or little important details that you often don't notice.|`|59WMBugaaa	The purpose of art is to allow individuals to express their own emotions without having to explain it to anyone else. One canvas can become an extraordinary piece of artwork through your eyes simply because it represents your thoughts. All the famous artists in history became famous by including certain meanings and individuality in their artwork|`|pVrNJmgpaa	hm, good question. For some people, It may be an "outlet" for them to express themselves, or for the sheer enjoyment. Art has the capability to evoke certain emotions from both the artist and the viewer. Have you ever looked at an exquisite painting?|`|HeOVyxDtaa	to express your self and your ideas, your own style and uniqueness. art can be an outlet, or just fun. but you create, which is amazing in itself and your art is like a bit of yourself left behind when you leave.|`|0q5U1y6Baa	Self expression<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?listing_id=21577086" rel="nofollow">http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?lis...</a>|`|skuUesADaa	i understand where you are coming from, sometimes Art seems to have no meaning to a society, but really it does....it just kind of undercover.<br>  <br>  Paintings, Sculptures are very imaginitive, and sometimes...artist can do, just art, and nothing else. its thier passion<br>  <br>  so while me and you say "what's the purpose of art" an artist would say, "whats life with out art?"<br>  <br>  anyway, another form of art is music, moives, and plays. look at how much that does for the US.<br>  <br>  Because are books, music, and moives are so successful, English is now considered the "global language"  if you go somewhere else in the world, they most likely know a little bit of english Examples: Europe, Some Asian nations, Most Latin American nations...<br>  <br>  Why? because of our art.|`|lBgtvZU8aa	do you have a hobby or something you love to do??<br>  isn't that a form of art??|`|VOzrb9Hoaa	imagination.

gOwakeM1aa	Yes, I think parents should teach their kids the basic principles of life starting when they are very young. But if the parents themselves are not loving each other and showing their kids by their own examples how to live, then they should not expect their kids to want to be controlled by them. Parents should also let  their kids learn by their mistakes when they are older teenagers and not control .|`|2scdUqkMaa	Grow up then we'll talk again|`|Po6dgusAaa	1) It is normal to feel that way because at your age everyone kid thinks that way.I thought exactly the same way you did, telling my mom I was going to have a maid and everything, but when I turned 19 I realized that its not about having someone else do the job for you, you start to realize your personal responsibilites as an adult and you want to keep your house clean.Do you really want someone going through your things and use your god know what when your not home?.. I think it will take time for you to full grasp the concept of being an adult when you start to think like one.<br>  <br>  ..its like my mother said " Anything that comes out of your p***y doesn't have the right to tell you what to do" Sorry for my french but its someting that starts to make sense when you think about it for a while.|`|VrR9ojRRaa	I understand what your saying.

What you need to do, is speak to your parents about the way the show you how to do things (i.e chores etc).

wGEYqauWaa	It is very difficult to bargain on new guitars since they're already deeply discounted.  On the other hand, it never hurts to ask if there's any wiggle room on the price.  But a $500 guitar probably lists for $800 so the store doesn't have a lot of room before it's down to its own cost for that guitar.<br>  <br>  Used guitars are a different story.  There, the store either bought the guitar for about half of what it's asking for it or it's on consignment.  If it's on consignment you should feel free to make a counter offer that's lower, at which point the store will contact the owner to see if he'll accept your offer.  If the store owns the guitar - most likely taken as a trade-in - then you should again feel free to offer substantially less.|`|i71H4RFiaa	Ebay is an auction site you can place bids on them and get them cheap.  www.ebay.com

2bVxBCgzaa	Self-centeredness- it's a form of consumerism, but this time based on information. To their way of thinking, it's "ME!- I got what I need, and I'm out!" I don't personally care, as I'm just here to flex my intellect (copyright, Hugh Jorgan...) and the best answer or points don't matter to me. But I agree that the attitude is annoying. Irreverence is a consequence of entitlement.<br>  <br>  BTW, I know who you are talking about- just a dumb teenager.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	So much to read, put it in a Nutshell ;)<br>  <br>  I Read the first line. <br>  <br>  People do ask questions, and people pour their hearts out, and they let the less than reliable voters choose the best answer. And, i guarentee, they never read the answers. I always choose a best answer, even if i get only two lousy answers. I see it as a way of saying ' thank you ', even it's not the answer i want to here. I would say that most questions asked in every section go to voting. Look back on your page to your answers from a few days ago, and a lot of them will be in voting, and they will not end fairly. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, that is there ' rude ' decision.|`|0qYY7cdzaa	I think they ask a question look at it for 5 minutes then forget it. It doesn't bother me as much as the ones that pick a wrong answer.<br>  And, I don't care if they don't pick mine as long as it is correct.<br>  <br>  The system here is a crap shoot either way, a person picking a correct answer who didn't have a clue to start with or the same people voting. Of course most voters are doing it for their favorites right or wrong. One guy admitted only voting for answers with ProFotog in the Source info!|`|2TLXfQKDaa	Yes, people do this just to be rude.  They ask a question, get all the great answers and think to themselves, "You know what?  I'm going to stick it to all these nice people and not pick a best answer."<br>  <br>  You look at the people that often ask these questions and they're not really Yahoo ask people.  Many ask their questions on google or yahoo, then are led to the forums.  While here they say, "you know what I've got a few other questions, let me ask those." They're not here for the points, they don't care about an online etiquette, they want the answer, they get the answer then they head off to put bunnies on the pictures or snap an infinite amount of pics in their bathroom mirror.  How often as a child were you told, "say thank you <enter name here>"   Without their parents following them around some just don't know any better, others just don't care.  There may also be the rare case where a person doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings by choosing across a field of great answers so they leave it to the voters.  I'm voting for, not knowing some people really like to have their egos stroked, and they just forget about it as they run off to do whatever answer they get.<br>  <br>  In the end chock it up to intentional "rudeness", ignorance or lack of care.  Push comes to shove, it's not going to affect whom I choose to answer or save my best answers for.  I'm not here to rank up or be in some cool crowd, I'm just here to share my knowledge to save other people time, thanks or no thanks.|`|062dcebc0cae227b915e6808bf0dcd18aa	I doubt the kids asking that kind of questions will ever want detailed answers anyway. I guess they wont even read your answer fully if it's not a 2 or 3 word answer explaining a short-cut with which they can achieve the results they desire, like just switching on some magic button. <br>  Many teens have no clue of the concept of "Hard work", they would only want to accept quick fixes and shortcuts to replace hard work. So if you, even in all good intentions, take your time to explain to the best of your ability and knowledge how they might achieve a desired effect with their camera, how to capture star-trails, why I always look horrible when I take self-portaits, what should I do to get lesser depth of field with my 5D MkII (Real question from a few weeks ago, ask Pooky), your efforts are all down the drain, sadly.|`|cc3b50c15188a21b6354387ed6888f48aa	It is frustrating - I completely agree with you there. There have been plenty of times when I've put a lot of thought into an answer, and then the question goes to voting and some short/inadequate/stupid answer gets picked as best.<br>  <br>  But I will say that they may just forget about picking a Best Answer. That's happened to me a few times: I'll get a few answers right away, see one that I want to pick as a BA, but there hasn't been enough time passed for me to pick a BA yet, so I go do something else and just sort of forget about my question. I try to check my email every day, but sometimes I miss the deadline for my question and it automatically goes to voting. If that happens, though, I do vote for the answer I thought should be BA. I think I'm just a forgetful person - I don't try to be, honest. =)<br>  <br>  ... But, of course, I try not to let it go to voting anyways.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	It's pure rudeness, but I have found that it is not limited to age. I have had people email me for extended info, thank me in an edit on their question, then not bother to pick any Best Answer. Frustrating....and I hope you don't get deleted!<br>  <br>  Edited to add, BTW..Nathan below me here is a teen aged gentleman and has nice manners.|`|AA12323486	Maybe they just don't consider that there are real people answering their questions.  Hopefully, they have better manners in real life.  But you never know.  Anyway, I've actually had someone thank me profusely in details, promise to pick me as best answer, then they just...don't.  Then since it's left open, other people put in answers, and then it goes to a vote, and it's anybody's guess who will win.  <br>  <br>  I've quit caring.
59ciGeYBaa	I think the best way is doing everything from scratch. It is nice to look at the works of other people because somehow it can give you ideas. But if your goal is to become more creative and original, is starting your own design based from own judgment. The more you see other people's work, the greater the possibility of unconsciously copying their ideas.|`|5Ju4iHBxaa	I repeat: look at other people's work.  Take classes or read up on art history, film history, etc.  Go to museums.  Watch films.  Look at magazines like ArtForum for what's new.  All artists have been influenced by somebody before them.|`|8J1UFeioaa	Think about the unthinkable, and create from there.|`|9b3537c30933da7786dc8b95599adf7daa	avoid education and pollution[other people]|`|70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	There is no magic trick to becoming creative. Creativity is simply taking what is already there and juxtaposing it with something else to create something entirely different. <br>  <br>  Try this: get a pad of paper, fire up the internet, and start googling things that you like. Animals, Astronomy, history, ancient British Literature, anything. Anytime you see something that interests you, jot it down on your pad of paper. Keep at it until you have an entire page full of random words. Now start putting words together randomly. What happens when you cross an elephant and the planet Jupiter? Medieval knights with Hard boiled eggs? A bed with a banana? The Mona Lisa with Chimpanzees? Barack Obama with Chester the Cheetah? Clowns with politicians (oh...wait... politicians ARE clowns! my bad).<br>  <br>  A more cynical person would say that creativity is the art of hiding your sources, but the truth is that human knowledge is a tapestry, which builds off of itself. Take what is already there, come up with ways it could be different, no matter how outrageous or silly it could be. George Lucas came up with the shape of the Millennium Falcon while he was eating a Hamburger. Gene Roddenbury came up with Star Trek by combining Buck Rogers with the Oregon Trail. Mark Twain came up with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by drawing on his experience on riverboats. Frank Herbert got inspiration for his sci fi epic "Dune" while he was studying sand dunes in Saudi Arabia. Isaac Asimov came up with the sci fi classic "Foundation" by combining outer space with Edward Gibbon's "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire". The Lord of the Rings, the great fantasy epic, all came about when J.R.R Tolkien found a student's paper with a doodle of a cute little man with the caption "there once was a Hobbit who lived in a hole."<br>  <br>  Creativity is the art of brainstorming about the interesting things in your environment.|`|r9lfDeRmaa	Write down and work from your dreams, there is nothing more original than your subconscious. Try it. Keep a little notebook next to your bed and as soon as you wake up write down as much as you can remember about the dreams you had, if at first you can't remember just keep trying. Start writing down anything when you first wake up if you can't remember your dreams eventually they will flow from you, and I suggest this whether you are a painter, a sketch artists, a sculpture a musician or a writer.

ceBTTCPwaa	The Odyssey (Greek: ?δ?σσεια or Odússeia) is one of two major ancient Greek epic poems attributed to Homer. It is, in part, a sequel to the Iliad, the other work traditionally ascribed to Homer. The poem is fundamental to the modern Western canon. Indeed it is the second—the Iliad being the first—extant work of Western literature. It was probably written near the end of the eighth century BC, somewhere in Ionia, the then Greek-controlled coastal region of what is now Turkey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Odyssey" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Odyssey</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/od/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/od/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/odyssey/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/odyssey/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/odyssey/index...." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/odyssey/index....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a>|`|xoLGphSBaa	You know they are married, right?<br>  <br>  Odysseus (oh-diss-see-us) is also known as Ulysses, and the Odyssey follows the Trojan War, which is covered by The Iliad.  (I prefer the Iliad.)  Odysseus has many, many adventures on his way home from the war (and doesn't really seem to be in a hurry to get home to wife Penelope - but she doesn't just sit on her hands while waiting).<br>  <br>  Penelope really only shows up at the end, and you can go for surface meaning or note that for most of the story they aren't together, and analyze that.  I would review the story's end.<br>  <br>  As I said, I was never fond of this story - and I always confused it with the story of Jason and the Argonauts' search for The Golden Fleece.|`|oYG01E2daa	ok well im in 10th grade and i had to read it last year in 9th so its been a while but,.... i think i still remember. Penelope if i remember correctly is his wife that he has to leave for a long time when he goes off to war and he loves he very much but when he finally returns at the end of the book he wants to test her to see if she is still loyal to him or not. so at the end he pretends to be someone else and asks her questions to see if she still loves him the same.|`|TYzNTT7caa	He calls her his quiet wife, admits to Calypso that the goddess could offer things Penelope could not, but that he remains true to her. It's a diplomatic speech in which he asserts his love to a goddess who wants him to stay without quite putting her into direct competition with Penelope. He loves her.

6DNjLS0laa	Contrary to popular belief, you don't necessarily need an agent to launch your career as an actor. There are a slew of resources available online to help you find and prepare for auditions. Some sites even detail exactly what casting teams want you to do during your audition. My friends and I are members of InstantCast.com and it's been really great with helping aspiring actors. I read InstantCast blog and visit their "Learn About" center to prepare me for auditions. They even have hundreds of exclusive casting calls nationwide in their "Parts" center. <br>  <br>  After going on a number of auditions I found on InstantCast, I can tell you the best thing to do during an audition is be confident! Prepare a monologue or two that showcases your acting range and go for it! <br>   <br>  Break a leg!|`|XOlnc8iBaa	Look online and in the local paper for local theatre. For an audition you usually perform a scene from the script you'll be working, or a short monologue.|`|9suyKwakaa	When going to an audition I recommend you wear fairly plain clothes, it makes it easier for the casting people to envision you as whatever they want.<br>  Bring along a couple of copies of your headshot and resume or biog (with contact details).<br>  Always have at least one monologue prepared, even if they have only asked you to do a cold read of the script. Sometimes they will ask you on the spot if you have anything you wish to perform, and it's always better to have something than nothing.<br>  Most importantly, bring an open mind and be willing to take directions and criticism. The audition isn't just to see how well you can act, it's also to see what kind of a person you are to work with - are you professional, open to change, friendly?<br>  To find out where/when auditions are being held - there are so many places. Look up the websites of theatres in your area, they often list their audition details on their own websites. Also, there are forums and messageboards, there are facebook groups, websites dedicated to theatre. It's hard to give you specific examples because I don't know where you are. If there are film schools near your home go in and ask them if they need amateur actors for their student films.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|12EuomC9aa	Well for acting auditions all you have to really do is be prepared to be in a character, put yourself in their shoes and experience their problems and happynes - unlike in singing auditions where its only  little more comicated, but thata besides the point. And to find jobs go to playbill.com and look on the left side and scroll down to "Job Listings"|`|EyAAFfaMaa	Who is "they"? If you don't know the basics of auditioning, there is probably no chance of you auditioning for the "they" you most likely mean. I'm talking about the big boys, who do feature films and hit shows. If you're not talking about them, then disregard that part. <br>  <br>  Here's the basics:<br>  <br>  -If you are just getting started, the first step is not an agent, because you probably can't get one. TRAINING!! Training at a good,reputable school, or with a good agent, looks awesome on your resume. It also helps you better yourself, therefore, you will be better when you do go to auditions. Just be careful, there are a lot of scams out there! (John Robert Powers,John Casablancas, ect. ALL SCAMS!) <br>  <br>  -Get a head shot. Quality is important, but when you do get an agent, they will most likely ask you to go to a photographer they recommend and get new ones, so don't spend too much. How much is too much? I'd say it depends on the photographer. I've had some great, cheap ones but I've had some AMAZING guys for upwards of $700. I know it's just a picture of your head, but they're expensive and important! I know of a few in LA and a bunch in NY. Make sure they're printed on good paper! Casting Directors can just throw it away if it's too thin or something, there is alot of competition, and they can be picky! <br>  <br>  -Build the resume with student films, indies,and local theater. Check Backstage (backstage.com) and actor's access (actorsaccess.com) for open calls. <br>  <br>  -An open call is when you can basically just go in an audition, without an agent or submission. <br>  <br>  -Also, submit yourself to casting directors (they're in charge of casting the project). I've used actinginfo.blogspot.com, but honestly, it's not always correct and it just has big-budget things, which don't usually accept unsolicited materials anyway. You should really get addresses and such from places like Ross Reports, or books (which come out monthly or weekly most often). <br>  <br>  -Try submitting yourself to agents. I'm not telling you not to do that, I'm just saying, chances are slim unless you have experience. Build the resume! <br>  <br>  -Go to seminars. Casting Director seminars are actually better, but Agent seminars are also very helpful! <br>  <br>  -Showcase! There are a few programs in NY, which is where I am, that offer showcases at the end of the program. By programs, I mean classes. Showcases are really great, especially if there are casting directors! Most often, casting directors and agents are invited. I'm going to camp this summer, and the program ends with a showcase for a big group of agents and casting directors.<br>  <br>  THE AUDITION:<br>  <br>  Auditions will vary, but will usually consist of a "cold read". Sometimes there will be a short interview at the end, but usually not. Most Casting Directors give you feedback, it's better if they keep you longer! It means they want to spend time on you, they can see the potential (they aren't blind). For an agent, the audition is usually performing a prepared monologue, doing a "cold read" and an interview. The interview is usually about 15 minutes, and this is where the agent gets to know you! <br>  <br>  <br>  On a side note, seriously consider reading The Power of the Actor by Ivana Chubbuck. Ivana is an amazing acting coach (unfortunately, only in LA, and 18+ ages) who has taught Jake Gyllenhaal,Halle Berry, Brad Pitt and more. She's really amazing and the book is insightful, and helpful. It's a really great tool, but I suggest reading it 2+ times, it may be a little hard to understand/remember the first time. The book teaches her technique, and it's really good. It's my go-to book, and my "acting bible". <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped! Best of Luck!|`|gJGxM9l2aa	In order to get acting jobs you need an agent.if you're starting out you also need headshots,and a resume stapled on the back of your headshot.<br>  <br>  even with little experience such as school plays,high school drama's etc. are still acceptable on your resume.<br>  <br>  if you want to know about open cast calls here's something that may help:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://actinginfo.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://actinginfo.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!! :)

enFCCMhbaa	As someone said earlier, look up "conflict" in literature. The literary element of conflict in fiction is often man (character) vs. nature, man (character) vs. self, or man (character) vs. man (character). Here is one site that explains it pretty well (it also adds man vs. society to the list of types of conflict): <a href="http://www.orangeusd.k12.ca.us/yorba/literary_elements.htm#?CONFLICT" rel="nofollow">http://www.orangeusd.k12.ca.us/yorba/lit...</a><br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|XxtVwslraa	You are on the right track.

70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	I ALWAYS used to struggle with this problem. It was my Achilles heel for the longest time. <br>  <br>  The trick, however, is not what you are doing -while- you are drawing the eyes, but what you are doing -before- you draw the eyes. <br>  <br>  Artists always start with rough guides and add the details later. If you watch someone who can do a face without guidelines, it means that they are either extremely gifted or they have been drawing for so long that they can instinctively place things in their proper place without needing to put it down on paper first. <br>  <br>  The most important fact to remember while rendering eyes is their placement in the skull. If you were to look at a person's face straight on, you'd notice that their eyes are directly in the middle of their face, from their chin to the top of their scalp. No matter what the position of the head, you can draw a line through their eyes and it would be the "equator" of the skull. <br>  <br>  But then, if you study a skull, you'll notice something funny: it's not spherical. It's actually pretty boxy, albeit with rounded edges, with the temples and the cheeks being where the skull starts curving back into the rest of the cranium. <br>  <br>  Try this: when drawing the face, frame it in a rectangle, so that the top line is at the tip of the scalp (don't factor in the hair! It can throw the drawing off!) and the bottom line is at the chin. After you have the rectangle lightly penciled in, draw two lines connecting the corners, so that there is an "X" inside the rectangle. Now draw a line from the halfway point of one of the long sides through the middle of the "X" to the other halfway point. That line will be the eye line. the eye line should cut both eyes into a top and bottom halves. <br>  <br>  However, if you are drawing different ages, this rule of thumb changes, because this rule applies to adults. Ever seen an infant's skull? <a href="https://services.epnet.com/GetImage.aspx/getImage.aspx?ImageIID=6729" rel="nofollow">https://services.epnet.com/GetImage.aspx...</a> It looks like one of those Roswell aliens. The younger you go, the lower the eye line goes, and the larger they get in proportion to the skull. Teenagers are going to have larger eyes (in proportion to their faces), which are going to be larger in proportion to the skull. <br>  <br>  Another helpful hint: When you get the eye line, draw another line halfway between the eye line and the bottom of the rectangle. That is where the nose ends. Draw yet another line halfway between the nose line and the bottom of the rectangle, and there's your mouth line. <br>  <br>  If you are still having trouble, here's a great way to train yourself to draw great faces. Get a photograph of a face that you like. Take a piece of tracing paper or clear plastic, and divide it into a grid. Then place the clear paper with the grid on top of the photograph. Now get a marker and draw what you see, grid square by grid square. This will teach you to compartmentalize the features of the human face, and teach you how to draw a face that is in proper proportion.<br>  <br>  Even if you are a fan of anime or some style that intentionally skews anatomy, knowing the proper placement of the facial features is a great foundation. As the old saying goes, you have to know the rules before you can break them.<br>  <br>  Feel free to PM me if you are still stuck or you want more tips

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	I more than "remember" film...I use it right NOW and love it.  I use vintage cameras with completely manual exposure control...35mm and medium format (120 size film).  I have an 8 megapixel digital camera, but I just use that for quick snapshots when I'm out with my friends.  For my REAL photography, I'll use one of my film cameras.  I love using 120 film for landscape photos especially.<br>  <br>  Also, Kodak just came out with a NEW 35mm film...Ektar 100.  It gives amazing pictures, with no grain and awesome color saturation.  It's already been so popular that they're going to start making it in 120 format! <br>  <br>  The thing is that most people who use digital cameras (especially digital point and shoot cameras, and that's what we're really talking about here) really don't care about quality.  They just want the easiest, fastest way to get their pictures.  I've been telling my friends that film can take MUCH better pictures than digital.  Then we went up to the mountains and we were taking pictures.  He had a 10 megapixel digital camera.  I had an Argus C3 with 35mm film (a 50 year old manual rangefinder camera)...after I got my pictures developed, my friend was asking "why are the pictures so clear??"  All his looked like the typical blurry, pixelated pictures that you get from a digital camera.  You could tell that they were from a digital camera.  But the pictures from my Argus C3 (with 35mm film) were razor sharp.<br>  <br>  I also develop my own black and white film.  There's no comparison if you develop the film yourself, and develop the pictures with an enlarger and a darkroom.  The amount of detail you get from a REAL optical print will blow away any digital camera out there.<br>  <br>  And oh yeah...I'm 31, so I'm not some old guy that's just longing for the past.  Computers have been around my entire life, and the Internet has been around for most of my life.  I've been around computers since I was a little kid.  But pictures only started to really suck in the last 6 years or so, when people started to use crappy little digital point and shoot cameras, and when they started "photoshopping" their pictures.  I've been taking pictures since I was a little kid, and I seriously took better pictures with a 110 film camera when I was 8 years old.|`|KNN4a8uYaa	I'm also a film head here.  I've been on a rather large Type 669 tear lately with emulsion lifting projects using Fuji FP-100C Fujiroid film lately.  The kind of stuff that I can do with Fujiroid is pretty blasted amazing.  I even just picked up a Polaroid Land Camera 100.  That thing's a beauty.  Full metal body, tripod mount, 3 element glass lens.  I just need to get myself a battery for the beastie.<br>  <br>  I have several old cameras - a Canon A1, Canon AE-1, Pentax K-1000, many Land Camera models...  Really, I have a digital, but I'm mostly using it for taking pictures of the emulsion lift projects for my own personal records as well as taking pictures of my cat.<br>  <br>  And I'm around the same age as Gateway - 32.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	I miss my sleek black Kodak 110mm camera.  I felt so cool flipping the camera in to its L shaped picture taking mode.  I've been trying to find them all over the pawn and antique shops around here, I really hate searching ebay, I think I may have to break down and just do eet.|`|0qYY7cdzaa	The direct correlation would be film specifications, along with developing and printing. I think anyone interested enough in film would consider other formats too. It was generally a topic related to films.|`|CyUxMcWSaa	Remember the days of film???  LOL, I still shoot a lot of film, as a matter of fact all of my b&w is still film.  <br>  <br>  Digital is great for color gamut, but, film still has digital on tonal range, you got to love being able to get 7-9 stops.  I wonder if even 24 mega pixels could pull out the resolution and tonal range of medium and large format iso25 film.|`|AoNBI840aa	Yeah, I remember the days of film. Then the early digital cameras came out and everyone was so amazed, even though they took crap pictures they were convenient.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	Actually, you'd be laughed at if you tried to shoot a wedding on 35mm film back in the day. It wasn't until towards the end of film that the quality of 35mm film improved enough that it might be considered. I shot portraits on 70mm long roll film...twice as big as 35mm, so that the negatives could be easily hand retouched.<br>  <br>  Thank God for digital!|`|k8AcVixTaa	What is not surprising to me was the number of digital amateurs who have since taken up film photography.<br>  <br>  I have the 10.2 megapixel Nikon D60 and while I really like it I still use my 4x5 view camera for my serious work.  Nothing beats film like film.<br>  <br>  I saw a Kodak Hawkeye at a thrift store last week and almost bought it just to have fun shooting with it.  This was the 120 Hawkeye.
XOlnc8iBaa	I am an actress in Melbourne, and no credible agents charge up front fees anymore. They may charge aboout $160 to put you online to be seen by agents, but that money goes to the site they dont keep a cent. Agents just dont take anyone, you have to have experience so Azure are more than likely taking you for a ride. Go to the MEAA website and look up agents there.|`|nQ3kFPMVaa	My best advice is to visit the first link, head to the FAQ section, and read about finding agents in Australia, how to find work, etc. It also has a lot of stuff about dodgy Aussie agents to avoid. There's heaps of free info there for new actors, and is practically the best place you can find info for emerging actors. There's also a huge list of companies that you can search by suburb.<br>  <br>  AGENTS DO NOT COST MONEY - IF THEY ASK FOR FEES UPFRONT, THEY ARE DODGY. Don't think "ah, it'll be ok." There are so many people out there who waste thousands of dollars and time (some reports can be found at the above link); not to mention that working with dodgy agents who charge fees also *influences* the director/producer/casting agent's decision to hire you. If you're not with a reputable agent, what makes you think they are able to liaise with directors who refuse to work with dodgy people? There are better agents in Melbourne.<br>  <br>  Visit www.alliance.org.au, the actor's union for Australia and join.<br>  <br>  Lastly, some places may charge for a website profile (on AT2 or similar), or for photos. Do NOT feel forced into using a photographer that the agent recommends. Nothing is dodgier than them trying to force you to go to their photographer.
NR3YnkVPaa	Another thing that can get you started is learning the "Power Chords" and then adding on some pentatonic scales. Just learning 2 positions of the P scale will allow you to improvise lead guitar solos without making any mistakes. When you can do that, then it is much easier to pick up someone elses riffs cause you have a feel for it.|`|ivejg4whaa	Check out some videos on youtube. There are a lot of instructionals. And if you happen to have cable tv, there are also guitar tutorials "on demand".
BZJGNFymaa	My AP Lit class is pretty cool for me, but a lot of my classmates hate it.  The entire course is essentially preparation for the AP test, which is definitely disheartening at times, because the way to do well on the AP test is to learn to think the way the AP board does, which often can be INFURIATING, because there is no arguing with them due to their position.<br>  <br>  We start off the day with 10-15 released AP test questions, either analyzing a poem or a short story/essay.<br>  <br>  We write one timed, in-class essay every Monday, and complete one at-home essay every month.<br>  <br>  We read at least one assigned book per month, usually two (one at home for the essay, and one in class).  We spend class periods discussing the books and going very, very in-depth.  It can be intimidating, but it's also very eye-opening and can bring you to think on a new level.<br>  <br>  Books we've read so far:<br>  The Bible (to understand allusions), Beowulf, Grendel, The Kite Runner (and/or) The Power of One, The Importance of Being Ernest, Pride and Prejudice, King Lear, Hamlet, and Gulliver's Travels.  We still have more on our list... the goal of reading this variety of books is to give you an arsenal of literature to rely on during the essay portion of the AP test - they often ask for you to specifically answer the prompt with a Satirical piece, or a Victorian novel.<br>  <br>  My essay-writing skills have improved a great deal, and I feel more motivated to -try- in an AP class, because the better I do, the more accomplished I will feel due to the perceived difficulty of the course.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, and I'm in AP Spanish Language.  It's a great course, but very dry - lots of book work, listening to recordings, responding orally to recordings, and writing.  Again, it's prep for the AP test.  But if you enjoy the language or have a great teacher, it's all worth it.|`|nbSvz7tqaa	In AP English Language and Composition, we mostly examined things like essays. We would study the tone of pieces, the connotation of words, and various other aspects of diction along with syntax. The idea was generally to figure out what writing techniques the writer used to make his/her writing more effective.<br>  <br>  AP English Literature and Composition is pretty much the same thing, but you examine fiction and poetry instead of essays. You analyze the diction and syntax of the pieces to figure out how the author/poet conveyed his/her message. <br>  <br>  We were not given a giant list of books to read. We are required to read less than ten books, and some of them are read at a fast pace in class. I will say, however, that AP Lit. has been a little bit more challenging than AP Language, but I also found it a lot more interesting.|`|dXW9cPWMaa	I feel like I should counter Phoenix Tears. Nothing against him or her personally - just need to stick up for AP Lit.<br>  <br>  From what I've heard and seen, you really only need one because they get you out of the same classes in college.<br>  <br>  I took AP Lit because until my senior year, AP Lang wasn't offered and then when they did, it was only for juniors. I absolutely loved it. We didn't have to read almost 100 books, or anything close. My teacher made us read about six or seven novels throughout the course of the year, and she taught us in a very college-level style. Our tests were old AP essay questions that we had to write, and it was great, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  I ended up reading about ten books outside of class just because I wanted to be super-prepared for the exam. I can't say it hurt because I made a 5, although I don't think I ended up writing about any of the books I read outside of the required reading.<br>  <br>  For a literature lover, it was a fantastic experience. We spent the whole time talking ideas and actually thinking, instead of rote memorization and boring stuff. Honestly, I loved it.<br>  <br>  Tough call, though. Both are great classes. You could take either one, I'm sure, and get a great deal out of it. Good luck with your decision!|`|XxtVwslraa	AP Language is much easier than AP Literature. In AP Language you are analyzing nonfiction text, mostly essays. You analyze them for tone, overall message and the like. In the end you just have to know how to analyze the text and how to connect universal truths to them.  You don't have to know any particular text before you take the exam.<br>  <br>  AP Literature is another story entirely because one, you have along list of books that are suggested you read. Not only must you read them but analyze them, for tone, theme, symbolism, and every other literary technique known to man. You have to know the books you read very well because the test base several questions on them. The tricky thing is you don't know which book is going to be on the test. You just have to read as many, over a wide range, as you can. <br>  <br>  I would suggest taking the classes. If anything they'll prepare you for college language and literature classes. Also if you pass the test then that's one less class you have to take. You'll learn writing and analytical skills that are expected in college.
7jNYqtWOaa	Suburb is short for sub-urban. That is a community that is just outside an urban area.  An urban area is a town or city.  (Anything built-up is considered "urban")  With the advance of the automobile and greater infrastructure (transportation networks) people moved out of the inner cities to live just outside all that urban stuff.  Think of "urban sprawl" with small towns growing into one another so much that the towns become suburbs of the inner city.<br>  <br>  Terms such as "Suburban Chicago" mean the outlining areas around Chicago.<br>  <br>  As for the rest of your question, as for Levittown, that is a topic you should know since you took the class and surely have your books or notes in front of you.|`|AA10753168	Do your own homework, kid.

az2ZBy3iaa	Because people tend to be unrealistic in their expectations and wishes. Everybody likes peace, but nobody likes sacrificing self-interest for it. Therefore, when conflicts of interest arise between nations or organizations, we have violence and hate. These so-called "great thinkers" paint us an unrealistic world of rainbows and unicorns, but they don't bother explaining to us how we can ever rid of ourselves of the conflicts of interest that lead to the loss of peace in the first place. Unfortunately, this kind of pacifist BS is hugely popular among the human population, if only because humans need hope to go on. Therefore, we raise them to the status of greatness without ever questioning the validity of their reason.<br>  <br>  Some simple examples:<br>  <br>  - Democracy will give us peace!<br>     No. Is nobody in North America aware that the Hamas leaders are democratically elected?

People like Hitler, Hussein, and Bonaparte were all incredible thinkers.  But this  was over shadowed by the way they used their intelligence.  As for the thinkers you are pertaining to, like Ghandi, Plato, or Confucius, they saw there was more to land then maps.  They saw that there is more to wealth than money, and more to power than strength.  They went beyond themselves to find the solutions that benefited others.  They understood that logical thinking, deep understanding and unbreakable compassion were the things that differ us from animals.  Animals can find answers in violence.  We can do better.|`|1XRHUCvtaa	That's not true. That's your opinion.<br>  I think it's a great idea to be a pacifist, and I support pacifists, but does a non-pacifist agree with me?

Maybe she liked the story? That's why I liked Twilight. The writing most definitely wasn't anything special. The reason Twilight has blown up so big is because the whole "love triangle" conflict is popular. Since the author combined fantasy with complicated romance between Bella (the vulnerable human), Edward (the "perfect" vampire/boyfriend), and Jacob (the funny, short-tempered werewolf) it doesn't really matter how well-written it is. If readers like the story, it's going to be popular, regardless of the author's talent.<br>  Also, I want to make a point that ALL kids aren't into those books. Many have read Twilight -- that's true -- but many also see its flaws.  I'm a teenager, and lately my friends and I have been into classics, and I completely understand the difference now.

EnyhoOmTaa	Finding out the truth can lead to drastic actions (like Oedipus's mother killing herself)...which makes a person question whether it is better to live a blissful lie than to know everything about oneself. <br>  <br>  Also, what you perceive as the truth can change things drastically.

The first truth Oedipus seeks is a simple answer to the question how to end the plague.  When he is informed that the plague will end when the murderer of Laius is found and punished, he begins a search for the identity of that person, but at about the same time we learn that there's another truth that he's been seeking for a while:  who his real parents are.   When Teiresias tells him that he himself is the murderer and then Jocasta (ironically, seeking to reassure him) says something that makes him think he may be, his search for truth shifts to a  search for the truth about Teiresias' accusation.  By the time the man who can tell the truth about that matter arrives, however, his focus has shifted to the search for truth that originally took him to Delphi and then caused him to flee to Thebes.  By now, Jocasta has realized where this quest is leading, and, unable to deal with "the awful truth," she goes into the palace and hangs herself.  Oedipus, too, finds the truth that is finally revealed too terrible to face, but he is sufficiently stronger than Jocasta to deal with it if he doesn't literally have to SEE it, and he blinds himself.<br>  <br>  Now, you've probably noticed that the two characters who have known that terrible truth all along, Teiresias and the old servant, are VERY reluctant to reveal it.  When Oedipus asks Teiresias to name the murderer of Laius, Teiresias replies that it's better not to tell, that if he had known that that was what Oedipus wanted, he wouldn't have come.  Only when Oedipus, angry over being denied what he wants, taunts him with his blindness does he lose his temper and say, in effect, "All right, then, it's YOU!"  Similarly, when Oedipus questions the old servant, whom he has sent for as the only surviving witness to the murder, about the baby he gave to a man from Corinth years earlier, the servant stalls and tries in vain to avoid answering.  Only when Oedipus threatens him with torture does he admit that the baby was said to be Jocasta's.  In both cases, Oedipus has forced out of them a truth that they've kept hidden for years.  The servant, being lowly and powerless, may be afraid of the consequences of telling, but both men seem to have felt that, overall, it would be best for the kingdom if that truth remains hidden.  Evidently the gods didn't agree, since they must have caused the plague, but Teiresias and the servant seem to have been trying to protect the city and the royal family.  They evidently saw that there are some truths that shouldn't come out.

He was already renowned for two masterpieces: the deeply moving sculpture of Mary cradling Jesus's body - his Pietà - housed in St. Peter's Basilica, and the impressive statue of David in his hometown of Florence. But Julius knew that Michelangelo was no slouch with a paint brush. So when the artist tried to decline the commission, the pope made it an order. <br>  <br>  Once he was committed to the project, Michelangelo didn't cut corners.

tqg3qZzSaa	It is commonly agreed that after 1807 his empire became to much of a burden. After the Treaty of Tilsit he created the Duchy of Warsaw as an ally and became entangled in eastern Europe, this would become a major cause of the invasion of Russia. In 1808 he invaded Spain and the war there became a terrible burden on France and his allies. From 1809-1812 he further expanded his own French Empire by annexing Holland, Illyrian provinces, and parts of northwestern Germany. <br>  <br>  Despite all of this expansion the one that cost him the most was his invasion of Russia, although he never intended to take over all of Russia , he did begin the process of reforming the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which had he won in Russia would of just been another burden on his empire. Had Napoleon stopped after Tilsit and never invaded Spain then I believe his empire would of been much better off.

You should focus on creating your own style, so when people see your work, they say "hey, that looks like [you]'s drawing!" instead of "wow, that looks like Ozamu/Miyazaki/Toriyama's drawing which you copied". <br>  <br>  You can do it the cheap and fast pedestrian way and just get one of those "how to draw anime" books, but you're cheating yourself, because you'll only ever be as good as the guy who wrote the "how to draw" book, but more likely, you'll never get close to him. Why? Because that anime artist probably has a lifetime of core artistic abilities under his belt so drawing intentionally skewed figures is simply an easy bridge for him to cross. Core skills which are either glossed over or ignored entirely because A: it would take a HUGE book in order to cover all of the basics and anime and B: who the hell really wants to make more competition for themselves?! They only give you as much information as it takes for you to buy the book, but not enough to actually get good at drawing. If it were as easy as just reading a book, there wouldn't be a need for art schools.<br>  <br>  Your absolute best bet if you want to get better would be to study actual human figure. Your local library probably has tons of books for drawing classical human figures. Ideally, you should see if you can find an artist's group in your area that does nude figure model meetings, but if that isn't an option, draw real people, both from real life (get one of your friends or family members to pose for you) or from photographs.<br>  <br>  Learn the proper shapes, bends, and twists of the human body. Figure out how long the arm is in relation to the torso. Figure out how long the leg is in relation to the rest of the body. Study the difference between someone who is skinny, buff, or fat. <br>  <br>  Once you get these core skills down, going back to anime will be a snap. Heck, it will probably seem like a reprieve, because anime is intentionally stylized to be simplistic and thus, easy for the lead artist to churn out anime/manga drawings by the bucket loads. For example, the big eyes makes it easy to convey emotion. Hair is intentionally wacky in order to accentuate the character's personality. <br>  <br>  Remember, young padawan, the winner is not the person who leads in the first lap, its the guy who leads in the last lap. Take your time learning the fundamentals of drawing the human, and you will be far better than anyone who teaches themself out of some crummy "how to draw manga" book.|`|KnjfbWdjaa	Anime is usually easiest to draw, I suggest going to a library and checking out one of those guide books.|`|jehC8R08aa	Maybe you have to link fantasy and anime together, and slowly take out the magical elements of the drawing and replace them with anime elements. something like that. or maybe you should just stick to fantasy, if you want to take the easy way out.|`|pTERJdzQaa	Try going to: <a href="http://www.mangatutorials.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mangatutorials.com</a><br>  They have an extensive guide on how to draw Anime people, backgrouds, scenery, weapons etc. and they also offer tips on how to start your own Anime/Manga storyline.|`|8J1UFeioaa	Practice and read Anime Books, and how to books.

40c85b996c134163f45223b2c362cd80aa	1.  Viking Ships were built from oak using what is called "clinker construction" (overlapping planks).<br>  <br>  2.  The prefered weapons of the Viking Age were spear and shield (they used round shields), followed by swords (more of a prestige weapon) and knives.  They also used bows and arrows.<br>  <br>  3.  Remember that not all the Norse of the Viking Age were vikings.  "Viking" means "raider" so only a small percentage of the male population would have actually be vikings - and even them, not all the time.  The raiding was done by boat so your tenure as a viking would have involved a lot of sailing before a short period of raiding, followed by more sailing to get home and then a period of celebrating.<br>  <br>  4.  I don't know about everywhere, but according to the "Saga of the Jomsviking" a young man had to be at least 18 and proven himself by a feat of valour, such as winning a "holmgang" (a kind of ritual dual) - although there was one example of a boy of 12 who won a dual against a proven warrior and was thus granted a place on Jomsviking ship.<br>  <br>  5.  Ireland, Scotland, England, and France primarily.<br>  <br>  6.  There are at least 5 theories why the Norse of the 8th century began going Viking.

The Vikings didn't choose to raid for fun, they raided to survive.  <br>  <br>  "Did you have to be a certain age to be a Viking; (The joining age for the Roman army was any age between 17& 22)?"<br>  <br>  I have not heard of an age limit for a viking.  But they probably brought kids on raids on the basis of how ready they were, rather than have a specific age limit.  They were practical like that.<br>  <br>  "Where did the Vikings raid?"<br>  <br>  British Isles, Ireland, France, Russia.  They reached North America, and sailed into the Mediteranean but I'm not sure whether they raided that far away or not.<br>  <br>  "What were the Vikings looking for (gold, food etc.)?"<br>  <br>  Anything they could eat or trade, including slaves.<br>  <br>  "How did the Vikings navigate during their expeditions and raids?"<br>  <br>  They often sailed in sight of land, and looked for land marks.  They knew about the prevailing winds, and in what direction they would take them.  <br>  <br>  They looked for different types of sea bird and sea weed, and sea creatures, such as seals and whales to identify where they were.<br>  <br>  When they sailed beyond the horizon, they released captured birds to see what direction they headed in search of land, as the higher your vantage point, the further away the horizon is.<br>  <br>  If the bird returned to the ship, then they knew that land was still far away.<br>  <br>  So they basically navigated from knowledge gained from experience, and an old maritime tradition.|`|AA10753168	It all happened in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

AA10725882	What "agricultural restrictions/changes?"  I need clarification of the first answer above stating this as the cause of the dispute that led to the secession of Southern states in 1860-61.<br>  <br>  Regarding the 2nd answer above, the Nullification Crisis of 1828 was about the tariff issue.  No Civil War scholar would say the the South seceded in 1860-61 over tariff issues <br>  <br>  This question ALWAYS incites a heated, angry argument.<br>  All I can say is that a graduate level history course at a Southern University taught by a Georgia native last year convinced me that the Civil War was indeed the result of the politicians' dispute over slavery.  We read book after book of speeches by Southern politicians who insisted that they had the right to keep Africans in slavery, and they would fight to keep them there.<br>  <br>  Many - actually most - Southern soldiers did not own slaves, and they would tell you that they were fighting to protect their land from Northern aggression / Northern invasion.  They might also say they were fighting for states' rights.  I agree - they were fighting for the states' rights to keep blacks in slavery.  Almost no one in the South wanted 4 million African Americans to be free to live as equals among the 5 million whites in the South.  Even those who owned no slaves did not want to have blacks free to roam about at will.  Many were afraid of black violence against whites if they were not held in slavery.  Blacks outnumbered whites is many areas of the deep South.  Whites feared that the former slaves might be resentful if suddenly released.  Everyone remembered the bloody Nat Turner revolt of 1831 in Virginia.<br>  <br>  People will angrily answer this question saying that slavery had nothing to do with the Civil War.  That became the predominant Southern view after the war.  Many books attest to this.<br>  <br>  Michael Holt "The Fate of Their Country" 2004<br>  Charles Dew "Apostles of Disunion" 2001<br>  Nina Silber " The Romance of Reunion" 1993<br>  Thomas Connelly "The Marble Man" 1977<br>  <br>  If you have read all of these books and still think that slavery had nothing to do with the start of the Civil War, nothing anyone can say will change your mind.  Many people are close minded on this subject.  It's amazing how sore this subject still is after 150 years.<br>  <br>  Too understand the genesis of the Civil War, you have to start with a look at the U.S. Constitution of 1787 and the provision that slaves counting as 3/5ths of a person.  Of course the slaves were never allowed this 3/5ths vote themselves, so the white men of the South had 60% more votes per man that whites in the North.  This was designed at the outset to protect the institution of slavery.  Northerners did not want slavery as far back as 1787.<br>  <br>  Then you have to look at the Missouri Compromise of 1820 which was about the slavery issue.  Then the Compromise of 1850 which was about the further extension of slavery.  Then the fighting in Kansas during the mid 1850's which was about slavery.  If you truly study all aspects of this question, it is clear that there was no other major factor other than slavery.<br>  <br>  The North did not start the war.  Lincoln said that he had no intention of freeing the slaves in the South, but the South seceded because they still believed he might free the slaves.  Why else would the South secede?  I agree that it was not treason to secede.  The North might have just let the South go and keep their slavery, but Lincoln was determine to keep the union together.  Lincoln said he would be happy to free no slaves IF he could keep the union together.<br>  <br>  Southern politicians were usually wealthy landowners - who owned slaves.  The value of this livestock was some $3 billion dollars.  Of course these wealthy men in charge of Southern politics did not want to lose their property - nor did they trust freed blacks to behave well in many areas of the South where they outnumbered whites.<br>  <br>  The only other issue the North and South squabbled about was tariffs.  The South did not secede over tariff issues.  The South clearly seceded over their rights to keep slavery - their "states' rights" to slavery if you like.<br>  <br>  Why else would the South feel threatened by the election of Republican president Lincoln?  It was Lincoln's election that prompted the secession of states.  Lincoln proposed no agricultural restrictions/changes unfavorable to the South.  Lincoln proposed no new tariffs unfavorable to the South.  Lincoln's Republican Party was committed to halt the spread of slavery to new states in the west.   This is what the Southern politicians could not accept.  If the spread of slavery were stopped, the South would eventually be outvoted in Congress and slavery might be abolished.|`|VYWaL2graa	Slavery was NOT the main reason the civil war was fought. Another thing they won't tell you is that indians (native Americans) were treated virtually identically to blacks. Yes, even in the north. It was only after the north needed more cannon fodder to fill its ranks that the indians were given the opportunity to fight "for their country". Slavery was only something that the north used as a propaganda tool, and the public school system still uses to this day (at least in California). <br>  <br>  The main reason for the war was that the north had so much more representation in the government due to their higher populations that things were unfair to the south, hence the whole debacle over blacks being counted as 3/5 a person. That wasn't something the south did to keep the black man down. It was done to increase the population numbers in the south to try and give them a more level playing field as far as representation went. <br>  <br>  Now, because of the north's surplus of power, the country was going in a direction that the south didn't necessarily agree with. Especially in terms of agricultural restrictions/changes. Eventually, the south exercised their rights and seceded.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS - Seceeding was not treason. Someone is going to say it was, so I'll preemptively respond.|`|DmYfr5veaa	States' rights was the original reason for the war, with the Nullification Crisis being a good example of a precipitating event. Slavery though, was a byproduct of such a system and as such certainly contributed to the onset of war, but it was not the direct cause.<br>  <br>  The war did not really come to be about slavery until Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation after the Battle of Antietam.

AbRfd29Haa	Well, until time travel is practical, we may not know for sure. The easy "out" is to claim that time travel isn't possible.. either time is a one-way arrow, or that, while it's possible for particles, there's just something about the physics of it that would guarantee you can't survive the trip under any circumstances. <br>  <br>  But this is a common theme in science fiction literature, and there are usually a number of possibilities. Some modern thinking based on General Relativity suggests it might even be possible.. at least for particles if not people, so this is some area of serious thought. Though perhaps more in the Philosophy than Physics departments of your local "U". <br>  <br>  Sometimes this is called "The Grandfather Paradox".. you travel back in time and accidently kill your grandfather, which of course, prevents your being born, prevents the trip, etc.. a paradox. <br>  <br>  It tends to make the story at least more plausible. After all, if you're going back in time to kill yourself, wouldn't you recall that event, and how you managed to not die? So it's unlikely you'd be successful at this, simply because of the feedback loop within your own brain. <br>  <br>  Some science fiction solutions would prevent you killing yourself by introducing a special element -- if you meet your past self, something dire happens: you go comatose, you die, the Universe ends, etc. Basically, there's an unavoidable roadblock, which also prevents inverted causality -- you can't go back after something's happened and warn yourself not to let it happen. <br>  <br>  So extending beyond that: Grandfather Paradox. One argument is simple: the Universe doesn't tolerate Paradox. In this scenario, you would simply be unable to travel back in time and kill your grandfather... something would prevent you. You could try it 1000 times, and it just wouldn't work -- the fabric of the Universe, God, Fate, whatever would prevent the possibility. <br>  <br>  There's a loophole suggested, that falls out of Quantum Physics... when you travel back in time, you can't possibly travel back to the exact quantum state of the past, because in the past, first time through, you weren't there. So what actually happens in time travel is that you go to a "copy" of the original state.. in effect, a parallel world identical to ours in any way, with the exception that your time machine now exits on July 17th 1978 at 5:01AM EST, whereas before it did not. In this scenario, you can do all the killing you like without paradox, because you come from a different version of this quantum state... you kill the version of yourself from this different reality. Yeah, weird into crazy, but hey, it solves the paradox, and apparently, the math all works out :-)<br>  <br>  A slightly different version of this idea simply changes the nature of time travel.  In this scenario, time is a one-way arrow, but there are infinite parallel dimensions. If that's the basis of physics, you can only travel in time by moving to one of the universes next door, which is exactly like yours, only now it's 1978 rather than 2009. As with the quantum physics solution, you can kill away, and prevent your other-universe self from being born, but not you, specifically. In this senario, you could also jump to any other possible universe... perhaps one in which Al Gore won the 2000 election, or in which the British defeated the rebel uprising in early USA (not any imaginable outcome, but any possible one).|`|hmsMpECkaa	An eternal conundrum.  That is what's going on!<br>  Somebody invented a planetary time machine and sent us back in time to the times of the great wars and we killed ourselves and this is the only mind there is and that memory is repeating and repeating on  and on and over and over.  We grow up and build big cities and almost reach the point of Atlantis, but we can't find it because we can't get there!|`|N0UUmjDlaa	Why don't you go back and do it?<br>  Then you wouldn't even be around to ask this question!<br>  I live in the now world, no other. One day I will exit it.|`|zyw4i3kRaa	Impossible, because that past would automatically branch off into another timeline, the quantum theory of alternate universes existing side by side I think<br>  the 'Back to the Future' idea of time travel as I understand it is based on the idea of the past as being static & linear while in fact it is always in motion & quite circular, the serpent devouring its tail, Alpha & Omega.<br>  You could go back in the past but there'd be no guarantee that the future you returned to would be the one you left as timelines are always branching off in different directions.<br>  <br>  No wonder time travel makes for such great stories, but I don't think it will be a souped up  Delorian or Starship Enterprise that will do it for us, more likely its a state of mind, all that junk DNA & 90% unoccupied brain real estate they still haven't figure out, within without you.|`|QnJvJ67uaa	<---claws at ears.<br>  <br>  "MY BRAAAAAAAIIIIINNNNNN!!! MY BRAAAAIIIIINNNNN!!!"<br>  <br>  Its too cruel to ask questions like this.....Maybe in killing your younger self that branch of reality would dissolve and a new branch would grow without you in it???<br>  <br>  EDIT:- my own thoughts on braches are that time and being are not one fixed straight thing, everytime you make a choice a branch evolves and there is a place where you made the opposit choice. So the whole thing would look like a very knarly old tree.<br>  <br>  Just guessing really ;)|`|J5zj8dWRaa	It's impossible.  You wouldn't be alive to go back in time and kill yourself, since you'd be dead in the future.|`|fKco44yxaa	Universe would break. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what theory it is, but i think that creates a paradox, and if i paradox ever came into existence poof, there goes everything.<br>  <br>  I mean its like if a square-circle was ever created (you can't have a square circle, 1 needs 4 sides, the other has 1 side) If anyone ever created one...again bang goes the universe<br>  <br>  HOWEVER :) now for some fun, what happens if you can<br>  <br>  Situation 1 - you keep on living<br>  Well technically if you went back in time and killed yourself there is a chance you would not go anywhere. I mean the past is redundant...the very fact YOU are there means that you have to have got there somehow, and in getting there somehow you are there. Ending that route after getting there is like crossing a bridge and then blowing it up...if doesn't effect you. Could be interesting to see what happens if you were 21 and went back and killed yourself as you were born...how would that effect those around you?<br>  <br>  Situation 2 - You die and nothing else does<br>  Have you seen the butterfly effect? The main character goes back in time and ends his life to save his friends' lives. He just is wiped from the earth, and everything happens as if he is not around...<br>  <br>  <br>  Obviously these all depend on time - it might not be linear as we think (in fact i don't think it can be if you are able to somehow go back, even if in a time machine)

My father was born on a farm in 1926 and remembers people coming to get food from the fields that was too small for them to pick.

In argument to the first answer, all too often I find myself arguing through rational thought against my own rational thought.  I don't think you can think you've gone mad.  It all has to do with the observer, and what the observer perceives to be the norm.  I have found myself lying awake for hours, in a fear of how easy it would be to slip into a mental illness.  Through a bout of depression I experienced times when I felt I was the only rational person in the world.  I saw things as I "wanted" to and found my views to be perfectly logical.  If we lived in a world where schizophrenia was the norm, I'm sure we would be considered mad.  I'm not saying people aren't mentally ill, but we only know this based on our assumption of normalcy.  Through my depression there were times where I would actually carry on conversations with myself, and go through mood swings bi-hourly.  If someone is to call me mad, then I will most certainly think them to be mad, compared to myself.|`|d78f1e8447d4e1f2733fdd9dd077e03eaa	today you have hair...<br>  and tommorrow you don't.....<br>  <br>  I'd use plumbers tape to make sure you don't do this to your family members - just tape those fingers up.|`|YZnJDWAEaa	When you stop asking the question.

raOeLVe2aa	WWI: Eurpope is run by 5 "Great Powers", France, Great Britain, Germany, Austria and Russia.<br>  Germany is growing rapidly, already overtook France in terms of economy and military power and quickly catching up with Great Britain.<br>  Heir to the Austrian Throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand is assassinated in Sarajevo and the Austrians demand Serbia handover pretty much anyone they name. Serbia recognise Austria is a weakening "power" and rejects the ultimatum. Austria ask Germany for help if they were to go to war with Serbia and Germany reply with the "Blank Cheque", basically saying Germany will support Austria regardless of the cost.  Germany do this because they see it as a way of expanding (the Kaiser's foreign policies of MittelEuropa and WeltPolitik).<br>  France then declare war on Germany (basically because they're pissed Germany are now ahead of them on the International Stage and as revenge for Germany embarrassing France back in the late 19th century when German Chancellor Bismarck united Germany and done so in Versailles, France)<br>  Great Britain join the war because of an apparent treaty that says they will protect the Belgians from an invasion but it was really because they wanted to stop Germany getting too powerful.<br>  Russia join the war because they want access to warm ports in the balkans so they can be major international traders.<br>  <br>  War finishes, Germany lose, Great Britain and France hummiliate Germany at Versailles.  Germany is forced to take responsibility for War, pay back reparations that will cripple their economy and hand over a load of land.<br>  <br>  In Russia the Bolsheviks led by Trotsky and Lenin, get sick of the Tzar(Russian King) hogging all the wealth and dividing it up unequally so they overthrow them and set up a communist regime which will work for a few years until Lenin dies, Trotsky is forced into exile and Stalin takes over.<br>  <br>  In Germany, people are losing faith in democracy, the economy is up **** creek and nothing seems to be getting any better for the Germans.  They turn to either the left (communists) or the right (National Socialists).  The National Socialists led by Adolf Hitler are promising to rebuild the German economy, reclaim the land taken from them at Versailles and put an end to the anarchy that is spreading across Germany. Also, something which appeals to the Germany middle to upper classes, squash communism.  Through some dodgey tactics Hitler gains power.  Fair enough he starts rebuilding the German economy and restoring a little national pride in Germans but things start to become a little too "national". Hitler starts plotting to take over the world, tries to invade every tom, dick and harry in Europe. Great Britain sit back and codone this till we think "****, he'll be over here next" so we jump in and put up a good fight. Hitler then starts messing about with American trade and the Japanese foolishly bomb Pearl Harbour so now the Americans are in.  Hitler once had a deal with Stalin but got stupid. Hitler sends an army weakened from almost half a decade of fighting to take on the Russians (who could easily put 10x as many soldiers on the field than the Germans could), he also sent them to fight in the winter. Hitler realises he shouldnt have tried to take on the big boys so hastily and pops a cap in his *** (head). War's over.<br>  <br>  Lengthy but summarised as best I could.|`|oquP79lEaa	ww1<br>  <br>  causes:<br>  1.)nationalism--people became obsessed with how awesome their nation is/was<br>  2.)alliances--countries allied with everyone and europe was split all up and down. <br>  <br>  so, a radical nationalist from some minor country in eastern europe assassinated archduke ferdinand and his wife. this sparked a war. all of europe was already allied with one or the other and they all got dragged into the war. <br>  <br>  the fighting:<br>  1.)trench warfare--you build a trench and wait for orders to go over the top (charge the enemy who are sitting in their own trenches) needless to say, these charges did very little, neither side gained or lost much ground. they just sat there and tore up europe (esp france). between the trenches was 'no mans land' filled with the dead, barbed wire, and mines. very messy, both in the trenches and out<br>  2.)weapons--machine guns and gas. both lethal. machine guns when you go over the top and gas in trenches. there was some bombing. and a little airplane dog fighting, but it wasn't a major part of the war.<br>  <br>  <br>  ww2<br>  <br>  <br>  ww1 ended. germany (leader of the other side) lost and was forced to bankrupt itself and disband it's military. the people were humiliated, hungry, and pissed off. <br>  <br>  so when a charismatic guy named adolf hitler ran for office, people voted. he promised to fix all of their problems. and slowly gained more and more power. he pumped germany full of nazi propaganda--anti-semitism and rebuilt the military. <br>  <br>  eventually, he annexed austria. then he started targeting jews. the anti-semitism progressed as hitler moved to invade poland. as england had an alliance with poland, they attacked germany. and the war began. <br>  <br>  hitler took over like all of europe. they planned to invade england but it never happened. battle of london--only all airplane battle in history. lots of fighting in france....<br>  <br>  and then, pearl harbour was attacked by japan. they were allied with germany. we saved the day in europe, leading the invasion of normandy. in the pacific, american (marines mostly) island hopped. they'd land and then fight the japanese for every inch of land. the fighting in the pacific was especially fierce. <br>  <br>  the war was fought combo of amphibious landings (sea to land), air (bombings of various german cities as well as tokyo), and land battles (both theaters).major battles: iwo jima, battle of the bulge, invasion of normandy/d-day, battle of london. those are the major battles that come to mind, though i know there are more. battle of dunkirk. letters from iwo jima's a great lesson on how that battle was fought--and it's a great movie!<br>  <br>  there was also a theatre in north africa. it was fought over the oil fields in the middle east. won by the british. bitter fighting though. <br>  <br>  anyway, the russians--who'd been fighting the germans on an eastern front--made it to berlin. bombed it. hitler commits suicide, his people surrendur, war in europe is over. germany divided, eastern and western germany, eastern and western berlin--berlin wall, cold war stuff. <br>  <br>  war in pacific continues.....thought about invasion of japan. dropped in favour of first atomic bomb. that's dropped, they didn't surrendure, dropped second bomb. they surrendured. <br>  <br>  <br>  now...back track. russian revolution....<br>  <br>  causes: bad government/percieved weaknesses. people hated Rasputin. people didn't like serfdom/starving. during ww1, the country was going bankrupt. they revolted against the czar. he resigned. <br>  <br>  sorry. that's all i know on the russian rev. <br>  hope i could help on the 2 world wars. i tried to make it clear and concise, but they were important wars and a lot of stuff happened!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	WWI: Millions of guys obeyed when their idiot generals said "charge".

0nu1NQl2aa	I think what your teacher means when she says "bumping the notes" is that lots of people tend to sit on their vibrato and put a little too much in. Too much vibrato sounds awful and especially when you are playing a chord in an orchestra you really don't want very much vibrato. "bumping notes" is when your vibrato doesn't sound like one note it sounds like you are playing the same note over and over again not just playing one note with vibrato. If you are playing incorrect vibrato it will sound a bit like a throbbing note when vibrato shouldn't define the sound, just aid it. The sound you are aiming for is a smooth, gentle vibrato. <br>  <br>  As for your second question, using your stomach muscles is good for getting a controlled, loud sound out of your flute but vibrato on the flute is conrtolled by your throat. Getting a vibrato on a woodwind instrument is about airflow, you break it up so that it is not one smooth flow but a flow that goes harder and then softer. You can practise it with whistling. You can make a sound that is not quite a whistle, it's just lots of air with your mouth in a whistlingposition so the air makes a bit of sound. When you are making this sound you can either make a flat sound (ie no vibrato) or a vibrato sound, you can really hear how the vibrato is formed, it sounds like lots of little notes very fast after each other. Translate this onto the flute and you will get a vibrato sound. But this sound is like the aforementioned "bumping" so tone it down a bit and you have vibrato. Hope this answered your question.|`|mb1CZfuEaa	i think she means keep moving forward while playing not playing one note at a time its like talking in one word sentences kinda. like. this. not moving forward<br>  it too hard for me to explain vibrato without showing you but it is to do with air

kacLYFrHaa	E, none of the above. Although the Vikings are the first Europeans to reach North America, they did so around 1000 AD. Not 100 AD. This would put the Scandinavians as the first to explore the coast of North America (as the Vikings were Norsemen from Scandinavia), but much later than this question asks.|`|ky3B42f6aa	None of them are right.<br>  <br>  Bjarni Herjólfsson did not stumble upon the coast of North America [he was blown off course on his way to Greeland] until some time prior to the year A.D. 1000.   So, I guess you missed a "zero" -- or what?<br>  <br>  He managed to sail back to Greenland and told Leif Ericsson about a "land to the west".  Leif Ericsson put together a crew and sailed westward to a land he called "Vinland".|`|bKheQfeYaa	Scandinavia.<br>  <br>  Portugal did explored seas before late 14th Century.

ji7WZvC1aa	Disagree.  The Lion King, while a brilliant stage show, is just one show.  Shakespeare's volume of work is so much more than just one show; also, his plays are about the human race and the situations we get ourselves into, which is why they translate so well into almost any setting you care to put them into.  The Lion King wouldn't make a whole lot of sense set anywhere outside Africa unless you were to drastically alter the show - yes, the fundamental story is a universal one, but it's much more hidden by the trappings of the show than the universal stories of Shakespeare which shine through.|`|eCjx7kLAaa	Disagree.  Lion King is a fictional character and/or movie and/or play.  Shakespeare was a playwright.  Perhaps a better analogy would be the Walt Disney Co. to Shakespeare, after all they are the makers of immensely successful entertainment for the masses.  It is a great play though.|`|3H7i5LQYaa	Disagree! The Lion King is a beautiful show, but it is not well written. Shakespeare was a genius in his writing (no exact line ever appears twice in one play). Lion King represents a revival of the Broadway musical, but that's because it is all about money, not good art<br>  Also, Lion King is based on Hamlet, so...yeah|`|b412254e11519aaa92cbe9efe511c454aa	disagree...

WJuGfZtSaa	Umm...it's kind of a younger person series but I actually like it, you know? Wasn't very well-written, but the story line pulled you along. A nice, easy, likable read.<br>  <br>  I really hope Clary and Jace aren't brother and sister. And Clare made enough inuedos to make me think they aren't. I think the author made it easy, maybe too easy, for Simon and Clary to be friends, you know, with Simon moving on unless she ever really decides she loves him. Anyways, I think Clary and Jace will be together.<br>  <br>  Ever seen the Underworld movies? Simon's like that. Makes sense I guess, I didn't think it was a big deal.<br>  <br>  I am looking foward to the next book. March something right? Hopefully it will be good...since I thought the first book was better than the second, I hope that trend doesn't continue.

9csiuqDaaa	I don't know what is required for drill team, but usually at auditions you will learn a dance and then you audition in a small group or by yourself.  <br>  <br>  When my friend was in the 8th grade she auditioned to be on the dance team as a freshman and she didn't make it. She knew what they were looking for, so she practiced all freshman year and when she auditioned to be on the team as a sophomore she made it.<br>  <br>  But 6 years of dance sounds good. Try to look at drill team videos on Youtube to get an idea of what they look for.  If you don't make it you could always try next year. Good Luck!!!|`|8TotPubwaa	usually you will go in do a short warm up, a few things across the floor, and learn a dance or two, maybe even a kick line, then you will perform the dances for the judges usually in small groups of 2 or 3. they will be looking at your ability the whole time.

American involvement in world war 2 from Dec 1941 was an important reason for the Allied side (America, Britain, the Soviet Union, etc) winning that war (not the Axis powers led by Japan and Germany).<br>  <br>  3. America imposed liberal democracy on Japan in 1945, part of what led to Japan becoming a peaceful contributor to world harmony instead of a military dictatorship, and also a very successful economy.)<br>  <br>  4. America paid for the Marshall Plan, aid for rebuilding Europe, including Germany, after the war.<br>  <br>  5. America had a big and positive hand in the founding of the United Nations (1945) and the Declaration of Human Rights. Both have had some influence for peace, world economic development, and harmony ever since.<br>  <br>  6. America became the world's #1 economy. In that role, her acceptance of imports on a fairly free-trade basis was crucial for the successful economic development of many countries that were economically poor and backward in 1945 and were no longer, or much less, so in 1990... such as Spain, Greece, Turkey, Korea, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia and many others.<br>  <br>  7. America built nuclear weapons and threatened the USSR with retaliation if they used theirs. This was fundamental to the Cold War, the major stand-off between the USA and the USSR which dominated world military politics from 1948 to 1989. <br>  <br>  8. America often intervened militarily, directly or indiretly, to protect or advance what it saw as its interests throughout the world, in any and every country that it saw fit. This included fighting the Korean and Vietnam wars in the belief that it was desirable to stop the advance of Communism in Asia by these means; supporting (with money, subsidised weapons and advice) the zionist entity (that blot on the world landscape known to its friends as the 'State of Israel') in its wars and conflicts with its Arab neighbours; supporting conservative regimes in the Arab world such as Sandy, oops Saudi, Arabia, and also the former dictator Reza Shah in Persia; overthrowing leftist regimes in Latin America and the Caribbean (Nicaragua under the Sandinistas, Chile under Allende, Grenada) or trying unsuccessfully to do so in the case of the Bay of Pigs Incident (Cuba); and sending "food aid" to Africa, ostensibly to help the poor there but in fact as a means of helping American farmers dispose of surplus grown food while keeping Africans dependent.|`|Iqco1PcQaa	created wars all over the world

SwreJuEkaa	Ignore the idiot with the rainbow wig who posted first. <br>  <br>  The key to perfecting your writing is to practice! If you think that the way you write certain romance/conflict scenes isn't very good, then practice writing them until you've found an element that you're satisfied with. Have people read your writing and share their opinions. Get an account on a writing site and post your work there to see how others might critique it, others who don't know you and can only judge your writing.|`|3WCXGRaGaa	Well, who are you written the story to? i mean the readers. if  its our age (teens ages 13+) then you can start it light hearted cute and funny. like anything you've done in your pass years, like for me in Grade 8 first day of school, i got a crush on a guy because i feel FLAT on my face one the frist day during the frist hour and he was the only one that got up and helped me while the rest of the boys in my class laughed at me, and then he was nice to me, and then on V-day i made him a picture i drew of him because he seemed to like my art work. so ya... thats something you can do. take something that you could fine funny but really cute. and write about it. <br>  <br>  As for more (teens ages 15 and up) start it light hearter as well, and as for if you want to do sex, really, if you've had it, write down what it felt like for you, and then tell us the readers what it feels like. it can be dirty or not, its up to you. but really thats the only think i can tell you.<br>  <br>  Im written a story 2, but mines more light hearter the only sex in it, is when im going to make my Main person go to a party were everyone is drunk and high out of there mines adn she sees stuff that otheres are doing that she didnt want to see, and then she leaves, and runs into the guy shes crushing on out side of his house working on some music or soemthing. (unsure. i dont want to make her seem werid) lol... so ya. <br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK THROW!!|`|UikWkS1waa	Okay, ignore the 1st person in the rainbow wig. The 2nd person had an even worse answer. I'm sorry, but it drives me crazy when people act like idiots on here. Anyway, I'm in a writing competition with a group of people from my school (hence my name) and I had the same problem for a while. We have other people read our writing and write comments telling us our strong points and what we need to work on. <br>  <br>  Try reading stories by other people that aren't very long, just to get ideas. Sometimes, reading different types of stories can help. Try writing a mystery, horror, comedy (so much fun!!!), or any other kind of story that you want to try to write. I was stuck on romantic stories for a long time. Right now I'm working on one, but my last few have been comedies. <br>  <br>  With conflicting scenes, just think outside the box. Don't write your first thought. Think it through and a brilliant idea may come to you. If you need any more help, just ask! Hope I could help :)|`|XxtVwslraa	Find something outside of romance that interest you. Once you find something that does it won't be so hard to move away from romance. Look up writing prompts that force you to stay away from it. After a while of practice you'll find that it's much easier to do.<br>  <br>  Don't give up writing romance just because you think you sound cheesy especially if you feel that its your strong point. It maybe that you are just too young to understand what goes on in real life romances. I suggest abandoning what movies or commercial fiction tell you romance is. Instead do your research. Ask real people around you about their love life and try to capture the reality of their romance on paper. Romance is a difficult subject because their are so many conflicting emotions involved and you need a certain level of maturity to handle it without being too cheesy. If anything, put romance away until you've gained some life experience in it and then revisit the subject.

I know it can be a bother throughout life, as I always commiserated with my two kids as they  dealt with having my last name, but, BELIEVE ME, you'll be proud of it, and its heritage, as you grow with it.  Stand proud with it, even if you're not right now.  You'll be very glad you did as time goes on.  God Bless you.

I'm pasting a link to a helpful article below as well. <br>  <br>  The meaning of Lolita and Humbert Humbert's names are the most poignant puns to me. <br>  <br>  Dolores means "pain" in Latin, and her nickname Dolly is symbolic of objectification. <br>  <br>  Humbert's name is a pun in two languages.

It seems from Egyptian art that men and women usually danced seperately.  They would have been accompanied by music and singing.<br>  <br>  People played board games, like the senet, taw, and the 'snake game' menhen.  Boards were normally carved out in stone, or squares might just be scratched into the ground.<br>  <br>  Popular sports included wrestling, boxing and fencing with sticks.  People also enjoyed running, jumping, and swimming.  Ball games were played.<br>  <br>  There were inns or beer houses where people wen tto drink and socialise, and play games, and dancing, music, and probably storytelling would have gone on there.<br>  <br>  There were many festivals during the year when the people would drink, dance and make merry.  Herodotus (a Greek traveller in Egypt) wrote that the festival of the goddess Bast at Bubastis was one of the biggest. "The number of those who attend is seven hundred thousand" he wrote. New year was celebrated, and the harvest festival lasted several days, nor wsa any work done during the five 'extra' days after the end of the 360-day year.  The public took part with gusto in royal festivities for the kings' accession or coronation,  in the foundation rituals - rope-stretching ceremonies - of the most important building projects, in the solem erection of the djed or pillar symbolising the continuance of the reign.  And finally in the king's funeral.  There were cemetery holdidays, took, when sacrifices were made in the presence of the bereaved.  And the major family events - births, marriages, deaths - were all occasions for private ceremonies.|`|YWN5wWdCaa	i remember that i read somewhere that peasant children would use vines as skipping ropes or sumthing.|`|7sqpiGgoaa	thats why they built the pyramids, because they were bored... of a night time, they were pissheads|`|zBSPaC70aa	Probably have some beers with their friends.

It's really very simple:<br>  <br>  "You must remember that religion is an early form of philosophy, that the first attempts to explain the universe, to give a coherent frame of reference to man’s life and a code of moral values, were made by religion, before men graduated or developed enough to have philosophy. And, as philosophies, some religions have very valuable moral points. They may have a good influence or proper principles to inculcate, but in a very contradictory context and, on a very—how should I say it?—dangerous or malevolent base: on the ground of faith."<br>  <br>  “Playboy’s Interview with Ayn Rand,” March 1964.|`|RvmYqQtRaa	When it comes down to it every idea is a belief making every thought of every day a religion.

It's quite confusing too...<br>  <br>  Language and Logic huh? Well that's something to paraphrase...Logic is a retainer of illusional thoughts created to serve as facts. The human mind perceives a certain event, situation, or object and judges it's purpose and formula to life. Language is the capability to communicate.  With communication comes the possibility to pass on this logic, or a flimsy dream as I see it. With the passing of logic comes the revolution of man. But like all creations, an end is needed. This passing of logic through language will halt humans and lead us to our demise. As previously stated logic is just a folded corner of our brain processing and retaining facts that we deem correct. This makes logic different from language through perception. Logic isn't a means of communication but rather a sense of direction.<br>  <br>  While a myth is just an illusion cast away into another illusion a metaphor is a disturbed sentence. Myths follow no morality and are governed by an infinite amount of contingency, kind of like existence. With that comes the similarity of a Metaphor, as a metaphor guides itself through the realm of outer limits, though doesn't reach quite the height a Myth does.<br>  <br>  Intuition is a governed guide of your own, following a height of your stretch and Inference is a perception of logical determiners. Though Intuition can only be logical by your standards so the similarity is their both following a role of logic. The difference is obvious, Intuition follows an illusion to all while Inference follows a fact to all. <br>  <br>  Perception is only the analyzation of the world, but the world is so vast in creativity. The reality we live in is only an illusion driving itself into complete chaos to lead our minds. Imagination is just a vast creation of your memories and leftover perceptions of the world. Similarities being endless possibilities and differences being the types of illusional property with the spacial difference of logic. <br>  <br>  The question is just an understanding of the worlds passage ways. The world being an endless fairy tale constructed by the existences influencing a life.<br>  <br>  This took me about 7 minutes to write, so if you could give me some feedback ;D

Although it has been suggested that her writing is an escape into the ideal, it may be this quality which partially accounts for the universal acceptance of the diary. Frank herself questioned her idealism in an often-quoted passage: "It's really a wonder that I haven't dropped all my ideals, because they seem so absurd and impossible to carry out. Yet I keep them, because in spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart." Her story and ideals have inspired many creative and constructive responses which reflect the timeless message of her diary: the importance, as stated by Rabbi Philip S. Bernstein, of keeping "pity and kindness and love alive in the world."|`|shVgCizBaa	WRITER HERO: <br>  ANNE FRANK   <a href="http://www.myhero.com/myhero/hero.asp?hero=anne_frank" rel="nofollow">http://www.myhero.com/myhero/hero.asp?he...</a>               Anne Frank- diarist of the Holocaust                   <a href="http://www.essortment.com/all/annefrankdiary_rzpr.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.essortment.com/all/annefrankd...</a>   Anne Frank, the Holocaust Victim:<br>  The Controversy about Her Diary in School Education,<br>  and the Controversy about Her Image.<a href="http://www.history.ucsb.edu/projects/holocaust/Research/AnneFrank/AnneF20pFinalHM.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.history.ucsb.edu/projects/hol...</a>         Anne Frank  <a href="http://webenglishteacher.com/frank.html" rel="nofollow">http://webenglishteacher.com/frank.html</a>

I've done the show once and am shortly to take it on again and I'm looking forward to it a lot as it's a great show to be involved with.
JpfBoRggaa	it's an excellent observation. Human beings are asleep. But they compare ordinary consciousness to what we call "sleep" and think that they're awake. <br>  <br>  In fact, very few people are awake. A handful. It's not an intellectual activity. If it was, I could tell you how to wake up, if I was awake. <br>  <br>  Some people have penetrated a third state of consciousness. And all of them began by questioning their existence in the same way you are. These people are as high above ordinary humanity as an adult mind is above a child. <br>  <br>  There is also a fourth state of consciousness that is only legitimately reached AFTER one is "permanently" in the third state. This fourth state is achieved by fewer still. These persons shape humanity, although it may not seem like it. We do not know them. "The lower cannot see the higher."<br>  <br>  But for us, all we can try to do is to WAKE UP. The two principle efforts to such a goal are: Self-remembering; and Not Expressing Negative Emotions.|`|7gpAdJGaaa	YOU ARE NOT ALONE WHEN I SEE A REAL PERSON THEY HAVE NO AGENDA...

There are others who feel the same way. In fact, I can say that sometimes I am also like you. Sometimes I feel that I know things that others don't. Sometimes I feel that the people around me are all phonies. In fact, sometimes I feel like Holden Caulfield in The Catcher in the Rye. (Have you read it? You can really relate to the story.)<br>  <br>  But then again, it's not a permanent feeling. Sometimes I justify people's actions, why they act in a certain way. It doesn't make them aware of their weaknesses, but it makes me feel better.

Thats stupid!<br>  <br>  These are quite normal feelings and thoughts that I have too! You feel like your in the "Truman Show". You don't know who or what is "real". I completely understand. I decided years ago that if that theory is true, then I should be able to do anything I wanted to. So now I live my life impulsively, fast and fun! I do everything I want, when I want!<br>  <br>  I put that same advice to you!|`|JPlVt9xYaa	There is a perfectly normal reason and I might add, it is good. First, do you really want to be like everyone else? I hope not. You, me and everyone reading this is an individual and even though we are socially active, we still are one with ourselves and the universe. In a few years I will be 100 years old and I have been an individual all my life and very proud of it. Each person has a unique set of genes that has never been duplicated nor will ever be. We are all different. That shouldn't keep you from finding people of a closeness that you can be comfortable with. But, I confess, my own mother didn't understand me and always accused me of being different from her other children, I say, thank goodness. She didn't mean it in a negative way and I didn't take that way. She just meant that I was my own person. Take heart you are not alone and if I had my guess, I would say you will be a great leader someday and not a follower. You make sure you put your best assets in front of you, make the most of your life and tell me in ten years what you are doing and I won't be surprised to find out you really have succeeded in life.
NYU37jfGaa	Control of the sea routes was the basis of Cretan power and influence.  Several pictures and lead and clay models have survived showing that Cretan ships were masted and of low freeboard.  Cretan seamen brought tin from Spain to supply the island's skilled metalworkers, and gold pearsl and ivory from northern Africa to be fashioned into jewellery.  Cretan craftwork was much prized abroad, being superior to that of most neighboring peoples.  Craft products were exported especially to mainland Greece and Egypt, espeically olive oil.  Cretain sailors established colonies on other islands, especially one at rhodes dating from about 1600 BC.<br>  <br>  Minos became King of Crete when, in answer to his prayer, the god Posiedon sent him  a sacrifical bull from the sea.  But the bull was so handsome that Minos did not sacrifice it.  His wife, Pasiphae fell in love with the bull and the craftsman Daedalus built a hollow image of a cow so that she could hide inside it and the bull made love to her.  She gave birth to a son with the head of a bull.  Minos then commissioned Daedalus to build a maze and hide the bull-headed Minotaour at the centre of it.<br>  <br>  Minos tried to conquer the city of Athens but failed, but as a result of his prayers it was infected with a terrible pestilence.  King Aegus of Athens ahd to agree to send seven boys and seven girls every year to Crete to be fed to the Minotaur, to stop the plague.<br>  <br>  One year Theseus, son of King Aegus, came to Crete, and killed the Minotaur with the help of King Minos's daughter Ariadne, who showed him the way through the maze.  Theseus fled from Crete with Ariadne, but left her behind on the island of Dia, some say because the god Dionysus fell in love with her.<br>  <br>  The Greeks had been beseiging Troy for ten years when Odysseus had the idea of building a huge wooden horse and leaving it outside Troy, then most of the Greek army hid while some of the men were inside the horse.  The Trojans found the horse and took it inside the city, and at night the men who were hiding inside got out and opened the gates and let the other Greeks in, and so the city was conquered by the Greeks.

AA12182122	~The Depression is one of the leading factors behind Adolph Hitler's rise to power.  It also played a role in the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.  The US was not as hard hit as were many other countries.<br>  <br>  The causes are many but the primary ones were the idiotic policies of the Federal Reserve (first flooding the economy with money, then cutting the supply at the very time an influx was most needed) and of the Stock Exchange (margin accounts only needed a 10% deposit), and the resultant crash of October 29, 1929 (Black Tuesday).  When the US economy collapsed, the world economy followed.  The UK decision to return to the Gold Standard played a major role as well.  So too did the Draconian measures of the Treaty of Versailles.<br>  <br>  What could have been simply a recession, a typical periodic economic adjustment, was then fueled by a curtailment of credit that killed consumer buying which shut down industry as well as the world wide drought that started in 1930 (The Dust Bowl should ring a bell).  Panic and runs on banks did the rest.  The US recovered sooner than many nations, largely because of The New Deal and the Alphabet Agencies.  Other countries recovered sooner because of sane economic policies and historically strong economies.  Nations that implemented recovery measures early recovered earlier and suffered less.  Japan, for instance, was not hit as hard as most of the world.  Countries that more self-sufficient and not dependent on international commerce, like the USSR and France, suffered less.  Nations dependent on agriculture and US trade (or exports generally, like Canada, South Africa, Australia and Latin America) were much harder hit and could not begin to recover until the US and UK began their recoveries.  <br>  <br>  A local event?  No, more of the world was directly involved in the effects of the Depression than were involved in WWII, a circumstance spawned in no small part by the Depression.  One cannot discuss the war without understanding the consequences and effects of the Depression, but one major effect of the latter is clearly the former and those affected by WWII were feeling the collateral effects of the Depression.|`|UHTcpdkVaa	Yes, it was worldwide in scale.|`|AA11484029	The Great Depression was global.

R5UIMBvcaa	I think the first two lines of the last stanza sum it up.  The forest was there long before the speaker came there or was even born, and it will continue to be there long after the speaker has departed.  The speaker, a human being, is tiny compared to just one of the trees, and any change he may make in the forest as a whole, like picking a flower, will make no noticeable difference.  <br>  <br>  The last line of the next-to-last stanza also sums it up, in a different, whimsical way.  The tree, dropping a leaf, obviously has no idea anyone is there.  <br>  <br>  Feeling insignificant?  Read John Donne's "No Man Is an Island."|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	I read it as saying that the person is so insignificant that their voice isn't heard anymore then a a sigh and this person has no real distinguishable characteristics so they blend into the background. This person is just taken advantage of and used by the people they encounter to the point that they are forgotten by said people when those people leave. But the used up person is not even aware that this is happening and remains in the shadows until the next person comes along to use them

7v1wqeWDaa	I personally think you should get the movie when it comes out. I went to see it the very first time it came out...which was kinda bad cause I had school the next day and it was the midnight showing...so I was ready to collapse the next day lol...but The movie isn't near as good as the book, but it is exceptional. You will love it a lot more if you don't think of the book while watching because it did leave a lot out..., but it is a very good movie.<br>  Hope I Helped!!!|`|0WKkXIyKaa	I saw the movie before reading the book, i thought it was a bit boring in some places, all it is watching rob pattinson and kristin stewart look into each others eyes pointlessly and emotionlessly, with bad special effects and cringey movement.<br>  <br>  Lets hope the next film is better (Y)|`|GW4fOE8Naa	I thought the books were at least entertaining (although badly written), but the movie was just absurd.  I went to see it on opening night with a bunch of my friends who love the book, and even they thought the movie was just blah.  For the most part, the actors are inexperienced, many of the good parts of the book are missing or skimmed over, and many little things like wardrobe and lighting just made for a really long teen cliche.  However, the action scenes were pretty good (the vampire baseball scene is my personal favourite), and if you really loved the book, you'll probably at least enjoy the movie.|`|hcy51vWuaa	the book was really really good, the movie was alright, yes it did leave out a lot of the little things and rushed it, thats just my opinion, i have read(own) the book and have seen the movie in theatres, plus i think why the people who dont like it dont because in the book its from bellas point of view and you know everything she is feeling and thinking but in the movie your not and everyone has their own edward and is perfect in their minds and an actor can't cover that.|`|3WCXGRaGaa	Really i didnt liek the movie. it seem to fast of me, she gets there and hten its like oh hey look its jaocb, and hten she meets edward adn she gets friends wayy to fast. but at lets there less whinning done but still... i like reading, movies skip alot in books because if you did it by a 300+ page book that going to be a long fricking movie. it probably would be around 4 hours or so. I like twilight in some ways, but i dont like it. ^^ i mean i dont go by it or anything. but if you as me books are better in movies, becuase books get you to understand the feelings of the person, movies your just watching for enteriment. <3|`|OZ7QkUlSaa	i think its beta to read the book first because you imagine the characters by yourself but then if you see the film after you do get a little critical at the bits they change or mis out as my friends did. i read the books after but i still enjoyed them|`|580783054b877a2e4cc28762986ab6c0aa	I thought it was a badly made movie, I had read the book before seeing the movie but went with a friend who had not.  she got pretty confused as the movie doesn't explain things very well, they never explained why Edwards eyes change color but Bella mentions to him that they do and there is a close up of his eyes , but no explanation to why ( also you can clearly see that the actor is wearing contacts - thought they could have CGIed that but ).<br>  <br>  the movie didn't really look at any of the secondary characters and Jasper and Emmett were reduced to extras , i dont thing that had two lines between them <br>  <br>  Even though it was a very low budget movie, there was so much hype about Twilight I thought they should have cleaned it up a bit in post production like - removing Edward and James reflexions.<br>  <br>  My advice is to rent it before  you buy it . see what you thing ,|`|6eLajwDUaa	i wrote a short review about it months ago:<br>  <br>  "The one thing that surpasses the speed at which the entire film is forgotten is the blinding hustle at which the viewer resents having paid for his ticket. Twilight, the movie evaporated all the substance in the plot of Twilight, the book. A remarkable epic fail."|`|v3PNX6Y6aa	Movie sucks.<br>  As do all movies which are made from books. It's to be expected. But don't get your hopes up. Personally, I think it was better than the Harry Potter films of the books...but that's off the subject lol.<br>  <br>  If you do watch the movie, make sure it doesn't ruin your imagination of the characters!|`|SULqkMfzaa	The book was way better than the movie. The movie left out too many details for example the blood testing they do in lab class, how bella cooks for her dad and reads a lot, Alice's past, how edwards spends nights watching her sleep, or even how clumsy bella is.|`|Y6gQYbrwaa	hmm<br>  <br>  they are both very good<br>  <br>  twilight movie has nothing to do with the book though, in my opinion<br>  <br>  if you went to see the movie, you gotta believe that this isnt the theme of the book.|`|fHwGbsRMaa	the books are always better but the movie was still great. You should buy it when it comes out.|`|Ey3Bu8e7aa	Book is waaaayyy better. Stephanies got talent!|`|b146bf3f7e2e162a7266cd68a0222d22aa	They are both for superfical thickos!
TAIlyvgyaa	Concentrate on the writing first.<br>  <br>  Lots of people get tied up with the logistics and plans for the business and find it saps their energy for actually writing the book.<br>  <br>  Get the book done, then worry about the rest.|`|XxtVwslraa	Getting a book published is a long process that may very well take years. <br>  <br>  1. The first thing to do is to completely finish your book. When I say completely I mean having edited it within an inch of its life, having someone else edit it, and then edit it again. Make sure the book is the best that it can be. If you don't feel up to the task of editing then there are companies that will. Mind you, these companies are expensive. It cost about $1000 dollars to have the average 50,000 word book edited. Also, as a writer it is in your best interest to learn how to edit your own work.<br>  <br>   2. Do the research on how to write a query letter.  This is the hardest part because you have to take a 50,000 word or more book and sell it in one page. Do no skimp on this part because it is what gets you through the door. The very first thing literary agents see is your query letter. No matter how brilliant your book is, if you bomb the query letter then you will be rejected.  Also, research how to write a synopsis since literary agents may also request that and an outline.<br>  <br>  3. Decide what genre you're book is. Research the different genres and match your book to the best one. Be as accurate as possible because agencies tend to only represent certain genres and you don't want to submit your adult thriller novel to an agent that represents children's literature. This is another sure fire way to be rejected.<br>  <br>  4. Research different literary agents. My suggestion is to use Writer's Market. Narrow down your list to agencies that are, I. accepting new submissions and  II. represent your specific genre. Once you have done this read each agencies submission guidelines carefully. Don't assume that all guidelines are the same. They are not. The guidelines vary from agency to agency. Many agencies have several agents and ask that you only submit to one. Query the agent that represents your genre.<br>  <br>  5. Submit your novel according to the guidelines and prepare to wait. It may take months to hear  a response from an agency. Once you are signed with agency they will do the work of finding you a publisher (here comes another part of publishing, developing your writing platform*). The time from agency signing to actually publishing can take about a year, give or take.<br>  <br>  Do's: Finish and edit your novel, research each agency thoroughly, follow the submissions guideline thoroughly, perfect your query letter and synopsis, be patient<br>  <br>  Don'ts: Keep calling the agency to see if they received your query, send your manuscript unless they request it or unless the submission guidelines SAY its okay, pay money upfront to any agent or publisher<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Are you a young writer interested in learning about the publishing industry?

W4UxFNNoaa	I personally wouldn't buy one, as there are much better clarinets out there if I were you I would only buy one if you don't want a great quality one, there are some not very good reviews on it, and they are not at all well known for clarinets. I would buy a Yamaha or a Buffet clarinet. Which one to get all depends on whether you are a beginner or not. If you are, I would suggest buying a student plastic body clarinet, such as the buffet B12 or Yamaha YCL 250 as they are the best starter clarinets. If you are not a beginner, then a wooden clarinet would be better for you. Also selmer is quite good as other people have said, and also there jupiter instruments too. I personally have the Buffet B12 and think that it is a great instrument for the price, as I have been playing for 2 years and am on grade 4. I also have my jupiter saxophone, but im not sure what their clarinets are like, but i would imagine their quite good just like my sax. I hope this helps you as I really wouldn't recommend buying a Mudau!!|`|AtYlQLScaa	the best is Selmer, then it is yamaha.  Blessing is kind of good, but not as good as selmer or yamaha|`|eK7dzFqxaa	I think so. My clarinet is a Yamaha and it has great sound, or maybe im just a great musician haha.

y8bFwXZEaa	Tayler, don't tell me you cannot think of one topic. Open the dictionary and put your finger on the first noun you see.<br>  <br>  Open an encyclopedia and pick a simple subject. Watch TV, let your mind float into the moment, and see what your antennae pick up.<br>  <br>  You have a mind. But you remind me of the guy who asks to bum a cigarete, then a lighter, and someone says, "Do you want me to smoke it for you, too?"<br>  <br>  Subjects are a dime a dozen. The hard part is making the subject you chose worth the effort. And that effort has nothing to do with the subject. After all, a play was written about the vagina. How hard can your topic be?|`|3OlUzzumaa	I wrote a play about Rosa Parks and got an A for it.|`|SezOZE0haa	Yaioshon is absolutely right.  Ideas are everywhere.

KpOQktc8aa	its about the baudelaire children who's parents die in a house fire while the kids are at the beach. basically the kids are entrusted with a lot of money and there is a guy who is always trying to kill them to get the money from them. they are passed on from house to house. the first book is the best, after the 3rd i found them to get a bit tedious.|`|5Lg3A7iraa	The one that is part of the Series of Unfortunate  Events? It's a good book. not one of my favorite books. <br>  <br>  short description: "Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire find out their parents are killed in a fire. They are taken to a greedy man who wants their enormous fortune. How will they escape the clutches of this terrifying man?"|`|C4DXata0aa	I use to love those book. lol. Well it is about these 3 children. Violet, Sonny, and Klause and there completely rich. Violet loved to experiment and whenever she did she would tie her hair bak in a ribbon. Sonny, well she just liked to bite things. And Klause loved to read. He had read every book in the Bauldalaire (sp?) mansion. But one day their mansion was burnt down and their parents were killed in the fire. Then they had to go live with their awful relative. Count Olaf. He spent time and time again trying to kill the kids, unsucessfully I might add, so he would get their fortune, but they were taken away from him when he tried to get violet (the oldest) to marry him in a play using a real judge and real vows. but klause stopped the marriage and then it carries on in the other books on how awful their life was having to go and live with different relatives and Olaf following them and killing the ones they actually like.|`|OMk0Otsdaa	I am going to assume that you mean the Lemony Snicket book that beings An Unfortunate Series of Events.<br>  <br>  It's about the Beaudelaire children and how they become orphans.  You're introduced to Sunny, Klause, and Violet who each have a specialty which helps them get out of the unfortunate events that fall upon them.  Count Olaf, the bad guy, is introduced fairly early on and it becomes obvious that he is crafty and will stop at nothing to get what he wants.  The first book is a lot of just learning about the characters like most first books.  <br>  It's a nice series because it gets away from all that "feel-good" stuff that a lot of books for younger readers tend to include.  These are somewhat dark and dreary but with a sense of humor and plenty of useful new vocabulary.|`|sF7xg5lwaa	These childrens whos parents died in a fire.

Buwahaha :)<br>  <br>  I think you should only read it if you can handle it though. A book should give you some goosebumps, maybe even make your heart race, but in a good way. A book shouldn't frighten you in anyway, since books are something to enjoy. Try reading it a bit and if it really does freak you out just set it down. No reason to purposely freak yourself out.<br>  <br>  But who knows, you might really enjoy it. So I say try a bit of it. Don't force yourself to read it, but you may end up liking it.

ksUksniqaa	I like your poem very much. The following are suggestions only; there is nothing wrong with your version.<br>  <br>  I suggest you do not fall back on the Old English Format for your poem of capitalizing every line.  Let the sentence (verse & stanza) structure flow. There is no need to capitalize every quality you are trying to say in finding yourself.  Other than that, I think it is excellent.<br>  <br>  Example:  I think I deleted 3 or 4 "always" -- redundant.     t<br>  <br>  Shy in front of people I don’t know.<br>  Hardworking at a task I’m given.<br>  ~<br>  Rightful in what I believe <--- this is on the weak side since you don't state what you believe is truthful and just. Politics, religion, life style? Show me, don't tell me.<br>  ~<br>  Extremely talkative with my friends.<br>  Youthful and young, <br>  I try to lighten up <br>  the mood around me<br>  <br>  Sentimental, sensitive and stupendous;<br>  energetic and enterprising in achieving my goals. <br>  Humorous, humble and hoping for the best, I am<br>  generous as I try to help.<br>  ~~<br>  this last stanza is all about showing, not telling<br>  ~~~<br>  I dance, the music is in every step I take.<br>  I love my family and friends.|`|nE5eqyWeaa	For an exercise or an assignment it will do, describe yourself. As poetry not the best.|`|5ewRYE4Jaa	Acrostics are always a pain.<br>  Remember, poetic lines do not have to be full sentences. Since you have six lines in each stanza a fun exercise might be to build it one word at a time and then recede in the second part. For instance, line one could have one word, line two would have two, etc, etc. At the start of the second stanza line one would have six words, line two would have five, and so on down to one word. Anyways, it is decent enough for an acrostic, very nice "s" alliteration, just remember to always have fun with your words.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|oECtQgtlaa	well..i would give it a 7 out of 10 :D<br>  <a href="http://searchwarp.com/swa126241.htm" rel="nofollow">http://searchwarp.com/swa126241.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.shvoong.com/books/poetry/109647-tips-good-poet/" rel="nofollow">http://www.shvoong.com/books/poetry/1096...</a><br>   those are some sites that might help u improve ur writing :D<br>  gd luck|`|vubdf6icaa	I like a lot, it's nice.<br>  (:

46fouwFfaa	Yes. I've thought about this a lot when I was younger. If it is true, then this life is just a cruel joke. I also used to think that almost everyone else was sort of "asleep" and I was the only one "awake". They just seemed so unaware of many things and unable to understand some things. This was back when I had a lot of difficulty communicating with people.

I have at times have a hard time believing other people are just like me, with emotions and thoughts, even though all I see is what is physical.  But I judge this with my eyes, and eyes were not made for thought.  What I did to help me with the illusion concept was I wrote down everything that would have to be true for this to be possible, and a lot of what I wrote contradicted itself.  I think you should try this yourself.  And there are plenty others like you.  Brushing up on new physics can demonstrate the connections of mind and body, as well as the mysticisms of the east.|`|v08bg6inaa	i've thought that... that's the whole matrix theory for ya. but i'm reading this dude, your not the only conscious being in the world. im awake, and im listening. take the red pill and see how far the rabbit hole goes|`|qv5UymOQaa	an irishman once said = like the layers of an onion, the more you peel it, the more you want to cry==what a show they are putting on for a chosen few==|`|XxDQGEalaa	I don't worry......I hope.|`|F5v5Qme0aa	This life IS all just a temporary illusion generated by our creator to teach us about life in this material realm... and I don't "worry" about it because, it is what it is.|`|AA11589328	We have 4 states of mind<br>  <br>  1.

SqzoZe4Laa	In my opinion PROMARK WILL ALWAYS BE THE BEST. You're going to find ALOT of differing opinions on this matter, I'm telling you. But I've been around for a LONG LONG TIME, and I know my sticks. Let's say you play a 7a, grab about 5 pairs of 7a and go to a corner of the music store where no one is take a practice pad wth you. Do not roll sticks on display glass, it is NOT EVEN. roll them on the floor only unless it is an old wooden floor, THEN you're stuck with display glass. Only roll sticks on a surface that is COMPLETELY FLAT, LIKE A TILED FLOOR (YOU KNOW THE TILES I'm talking about, like in a junior high or high school), basically, a COMPLETELY FLAT FLOOR. Take ALL the sticks out. Look at them all. Look at the difference in color, look at the difference in texture. Feel the WEIGHT, THE WEIGHT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING (both sticks need to weigh exactly the same), but the reason you are rolling them is to pick out the STRAIGHTEST STICKS, this is also one of the most important things. Then roll them on the ground. You'll be able to tell IMMEDIATLEY WHICH ONES ARE BAD AND SHOULD BE "TOSSED". Package them immediately back up in the original stick sleeves once you get 4, 5, or 6 straight ones, keep playing until you get JUST TWO THAT WEIGH THE SAME. That's your pair. Put them in a sleeve and put it aside, maybe tear the cardboard on the sleeve just a little bit (or mark it with a pen that you have in your pocket so you don't mix that pair with another "bad" pair) so you don't get them mixed up while you're packaging up the rest of the "LOSERS", GOT IT? Now go buy your winning pair. Next, maybe you want to buy a pair of 5a's at the same store. Use the same procedure, but only do this ONCE A MONTH PER STORE, or you're going to wind up buying warped sticks eventually. You can always go to another store to rifle through their sticks, you see? Now you see how it works, my man. Good luck out there, it is a very competitive world and you won't know if you are professional material for about 8 to 10 years. You'll feel it in your heart before you can put the sticks to the drums the right way though. Once you feel it in your heart, it's only a matter of time until the sticks just GO WHERE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO. -john in rock island, illinois<br>  <br>  goto youtube and watch some of the carter beauford videos (under the table and drumming series). That'll give you a feel for what it's like to REALLY HAVE A FEEL FOR THE DRUMS. Drummers like Beauford don't even have to think about what they are doing because it happens automatically. You should've started earlier, you're starting a little late, but that's ok, No worries, I haven't played for 5 years, and I played every DAY FOR 15 YEARS BEFORE THAT, so that puts me at a deficit of 5 year, but I'll get it back, I know I will, because it's in my HEART. That's where it ALL COMES FROM. We used to have this kid in high school and he drummed like a ROBOT, no feel, no groove, and DIDN'T HAVE IT, MAN. He just didn't have it. You've got to be able to MOVE WITH the music, but don't expect it t happen overnight, just take it slow, REAL SLOW, LEARN THE BASICS, AND DREAM. Oh another thing, print out this email that I sent you and take it your your Instructor. Ask him if I'm right. Ask him if my advice should be followed. See what he says. Then you'll know for sure we're all on the right track. keep it up little man.... -      johndeporter@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  ps - if you send me a mailing address I'll send you RUSH IN RIO.

oECtQgtlaa	it means that life gives back to you for all of the goodness that you give it. If you give something back to life, it will reward you, but something bad, it will be your fall. Once you fall down, get back up and shake yourself right and start walking again. God will never be on your level. it isn't something that is bad. It has no meaning to you since you will never match up. Mountains are secluded so they are commonly thought of as "lonely". Perhaps the mountain saw you and it just couldn't help crying. <br>  <br>  It is probably a poem the author wrote when wondering about life :]|`|vbB8OWRiaa	i think its about how people that you think were rude to you(the mountain), did not mean it and that you should not go away from them because they are lonely because of it. it also shows how the great can not be as great as we think they are. also i think that poem has a type of french pattern, might be a vilanelle.|`|JOChNigNaa	What would you think if you were caught in a landslide?

Ruth has, over time, gained the trust of the neighborhood children by allowing them to come freely into her home, play as rough as they wish, and even drink an occasional beer with her.<br>  <br>  Fast forward to Meg and Susan, Ruth's nieces, who come to live with their aunt after the death of their parents. All seems well at first: the girls make friends with the other children and David begins to develop feelings for the sweet and innocent Meg.<br>  <br>  However, Ruth's mental state has been deteriorating over time, and the burden of having two more children to care for seems to accelerate her descent into madness.<br>  <br>  Ruth begins verbally, then physically, abusing the two girls, often while the other neighborhood children are watching. Then she allows the other children to abuse them, making them feel that because they have the permission of an adult, their actions are okay and will not be punished.<br>  <br>  Finally both Meg (who is severely injured and near death) and Susan find themselves locked up in the bomb shelter in Ruth's basement, and David realizes that he must do something before time runs out and he loses the first girl he ever loved. However, despite his efforts, his plan to rescue the girls is foiled by Ruth and the neighborhood children under her control. And after one final act of torture, Meg dies, and the lives of all those involved are forever changed.

Fy4s0dAkaa	Hi!  It's called Tableaux Vivant (Living Pictures).<br>  Quotes:<br>  Tableau vivant (plural: tableaux vivants) <br>  is French for "living picture." The term <br>  describes a striking group of suitably <br>  costumed actors or artist's models, <br>  carefully posed and often theatrically lit. <br>  Throughout the duration of the display, <br>  the people shown do not speak or move. <br>  The approach thus marries the art forms <br>  of the stage with those of painting<br>  <br>  Look at:<br>  The Pageant of the Masters is an annual festival <br>  held by the Festival of Arts in Laguna Beach, Ca. <br>  The event is known for its tableaux vivant or "living <br>  pictures" in which classical and contemporary works <br>  of art are recreated by real people who are made to <br>  look nearly identical to the originals through the clever <br>  application of costumes, makeup, headdresses, <br>  lighting, props, and backdrops.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableaux_vivant" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableaux_vi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&ei=BLOnSaepHoG4twfXi9HYDw&sa=X&oi=spell&resnum=0&ct=result&cd=1&q=PAGEANT+OF+THE+MASTERS+youtube&spell=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UT...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pageant_of_the_Masters" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pageant_of_...</a>|`|ZB9zkbxxaa	Pantomime|`|T9fuWReRaa	Performance art
kfOpbbCyaa	Oliver Twist is a wonderful book. Then again, I love Charles Dickens, so I pretty much adore everything he wrote.<br>  <br>  Weren't you glad when Monks was finally exposed?<br>  <br>  The oddest thing is I always find myself feeling terribly sorry for Bill Sikes' dog. (Okay, maybe I'm strange, but there you go.)<br>  <br>  The most horrible part, to me, was when Bill killed Nancy. I felt like crying over that one. Did you know that Charles Dickens used to tour around giving readings, and he often included this scene in the performance? From things I've read, his friends would caution him against doing this because it was emotionally draining for him.<br>  <br>  One of the most memorable characters, to me, was the Artful Dodger. I couldn't help liking him, despite the fact he was one of Fagin's gang of thieves.<br>  <br>  All told, it was a great book, and I was glad that Oliver's goodness and loving nature was rewarded in the end.<br>  <br>  ***B, it's good to know I'm not alone in that. :)<br>  <br>  ***Monks, especially, reminded me of Orlick, arabesque.<br>  <br>  By the way, you may enjoy The Old Curiosity Shop, too. Little Nell is another sweetheart; loving and good. Be prepared for a tear-fest, though, especially at the end. Dombey and Son is another Dickens title you may appreciate.

2bVxBCgzaa	I do a lot of street photography when I travel, often in places that I don't want to stick out like North Africa, Cuba, or Eastern Europe. And I don't really 'hide' my camera as much as simply use distraction or nonchalance- I just pretend to be slowly walking somewhere, and I shoot from the waist in portrait, using burst- obviously you'd want a decent depth of field, and have to rely on autofocus or set your lens to infinity. It just looks to a casual observer like I'm simply going past with a camera in my hand- 99% of people equate taking a picture with holding a camera up to your eye. I'll often be looking up at a building or something as I pass- nobody ever suspects that I'm photographing them. I almost use a reverse form of panning, except that I'm rotating the camera in place momentarily as I move through space, if that makes sense. I'll shoot moderately wide and crop out what I don't need. I learned through trial and error how to approximate angles and composition by 'feel' doing this. Sloppy? You bet! Does it work- absolutely! Of course, I shoot digital, so you might not want to burn film doing this. I sometimes have my day-pack slung over the one arm I shoot with, and let it dangle to just above my lens- I look like just another dumb tourist, so nobody notices me. If I need to shoot in landscape, I've also pretended to be fixing something or otherwise attending to my gear, triggering the shutter with the flat of my thumb, and always at chest level or lower so as not to arouse interest while looking down at my camera. Again, nobody ever thinks you're shooting if it's not up near your face. I've also done this- pretended to be adjusting  my shoe or something, or reading my guidebook, while my camera is pointed discretely at what I want; or I've seen a shot, planned the composition, and used my 10-second self timer with the camera hanging from my neck, hands nowhere near it! Sneaky, sneaky... I should have been a spy...<br>  <br>  BTW, your site is excellent. My favorite shots are the skyscraper abstract with the tiny airplane, the elderly lady passing the tri-chopper, and the macro of the small stone with the white lines. The portrait of the guy mending his nets is also a great capture. Nice work.|`|WEzv0n0Baa	Telephoto lens 300 or more.That way you don't have to be close to the subject which makes you invisible to them or close to it. If you are shooting in daylight I like to use ISO 64/ ISO 100.and use a remote shutter cable so you won't get movement of the camera from the mirror slamming, well at leaest it like it is slamming.|`|8698ad788d29eb3bfd4384d7ea145f3faa	I, too use SLR Camera bodies (Film and Digital) and have 3 particular lenses that I use on a regular basis (a standard length, a wide angle to small telephoto, and a standard to medium telephoto which end up taking care of the vast majority of what I shoot).<br>  <br>  Now with that said .. I would like to point out that you need to be sensitive to OTHERS .. and that means respecting the rights/beliefs of others in regards to their "images" ..<br>  <br>  I don't suggest 'hiding' the camera at all .. wear it around your neck, with the lens cap on.  IF in doubt .. ASK the subject(s) if you can snap their image .. if they want it then yes, take the photo that you intended to at that time.  (This is a rule of thumb that I learned while attending my Photography Courses at my local college -- the Professors insisted that we learn the 'ethics' of taking of images and how others could possibly be offended by them). <br>  <br>  I wouldn't suggest 'slinging' it over one's shoulder at all -- that is the way things 'slip/fall' and break (and goodness knows -- SLRs are expensive).  <br>  <br>  Don't worry about 'missing' things .. just concentrate on enjoying what you see .. and yes, don't be afraid to ASK!  I have a tendency to ask friends/family along when I need people in my photography .. and they know that I will take those photos for my 'stock'.  As a result, I have ethically obtained what I wanted, and I did not offend anyone in the process.|`|b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	I have to agree with "namedeleted"...a TLR might be an option.  Not only would you get much sharper pictures (considering it's medium format film), but depending on the circumstances, it might actually be much less conspicuous.  That sounds kind of strange...a big, twin lens camera might be LESS conspicuous.  But the thing is that most people have never seen a TLR before.  If you're very casual about it and don't draw attention to yourself, the average person probably wouldn't even recognize that it's a camera!  The public is so used to seeing people look through a viewfinder (or the LCD display on a digital camera), that when you look through the view screen on TOP of the camera, they probably wouldn't even think that it's a camera.<br>  <br>  The closest I came to "street photography" was when I was taking pictures at a lake in the mountains.  I was taking pictures with my Yashica A, which is a TLR, as you probably know.  I'm mainly interested in landscape photos, so at first I was just taking pictures of the lake.  Well I decided to get some pictures of people around the lake...just loading their boats into the water, walking on the trail around the lake, etc.  I thought it might be interesting to take some natural, candid pictures of the people.  At first, I was kind of nervous because I had never taken candid pictures of people before (well, not strangers anyway).  But then I realized that it really wasn't any different than taking pictures of the lake.  As long as I didn't bother them, they probably wouldn't even notice me.  And they didn't.  They didn't notice me at all.  The people were completely obvlivious and just went about their business.  <br>  <br>  I think part of the reason was because I was using a TLR and so when I was looking in the view screen on top, they didn't even realize that it was a camera.  I acted very casual and just talked with my friends while I took the pictures.<br>  <br>  I'm hardly an expert, because I don't do street photography.  But I would think that as long as you don't do anything to draw too much attention to yourself, and as long as you don't bother them, most people probably would never even notice you.  Most people have so much on their mind (especially right now) that they are totally oblivious.<br>  <br>  By the way, legally you do NOT have to ask permission to take someone's picture if they're on public property (public street, public park, etc).  The laws might be different in some countries.  But in the US, you don't need to have permission as long as they're on public property and you don't use the pictures for commercial purposes.  You'll have to judge whether you can take the picture without the person noticing or without bothering them.  Most people won't care or won't even notice.  In some cases, it might be better to just introduce yourself and ask the person's permission.  But yeah, I can see how that would ruin the "candid" moment of the picture.  People act weird when they know a camera is around, even if they try not to.  They act goofy, or they just get nervous and they can't help it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope someone with more experience can help you.  Try posting your question on Photo.net.|`|oPDTdoWDaa	I hide my camera by not hiding it. I'm very visible when I take pictures. That, or I say I'm working on a project for a class if anyone asks.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Just let the camera hang around your neck at chest level. Use a 35mm lens at f11, set the focus to 7' and everything from 4' 5" to 18' 4" will be in focus. Use a cable release to trip the shutter. You'll have to practice composing without looking through the viewfinder. Alfred Eisenstaedt is famous for his candid photography done this way on the New York subway system.<br>  <br>  You can also buy a "spy lens" which is a long lens hood with a mirror at a 45 degree angle "looking" out of a hole in the side of the lens hood. So when you have your camera pointed one way you're really taking a picture 90 degrees to the side.<br>  <br>  If you only have a 50mm lens you can check its best depth of field  settings at <a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html</a>|`|0qYY7cdzaa	Be relaxed and casual. I usually have my slr hanging from my shoulder along with a messenger bag. The bag helps camouflage the camera and it's right by my hand. In most cases I don't use the slr and use a rangefinder instead. It is much less conspicuous and when noticed most people think it's just a point & shoot. Another good camera to use is a TLR, you shoot from the waist and hardly get noticed at all. I don't recommend a long telephoto unless there is a real reason. It removes you from the subject - the street, and that's what it's about.
Bk4eIAWWaa	Actually I would say it's more the opposite. Most people's faces can not tolerate the harsh reality of a technically sharp lens for their portrait, whereas cityscapes can.|`|LVpyaf48aa	you got it reversed.<br>  pro nature and landscape photogs use medium and large format cameras with sharp fast lenses.<br>  an apc dslr is fine for most portrait work.|`|CyUxMcWSaa	Ok, hold on here, I do shoot a little nature and landscape and a lot of portraiting as well as glamoure.  I use as sharp and fast of lens I can afford for both.  For nature and landscape, together, you'll need wide angle fast lenses and a nice zoom.  For wildlife you're going to need very long and very fast lenses, an APC sensor helps with that due to 'crop factor'.  If you want to do nature/landscape AND wildlife, plan on a double mortage just to afford the glass.<br>  <br>  For portraiting and glamoure shooting, I'm old school and believe primes are the only way to go.  It's been argued that many of the newest fast zooms are just as sharp but I'll stick to what I've used and proven to myself over the years.  For this style, usually 75mm - 150mm(or so) is perfect on a DSLR or 35mm SLR.  On medium format (120 or 220, regardless of the back) 100mm -150mm lens is the best.  The slowest lens I use for portraiting is f/2.8 and the fastest being f/1.4.  The faster the lens the more depth of field you have to choose from.  Regardless though, even the fastest lenses won't reach peak sharpness till f/4-f/8.  <br>  <br>  With wildlife you'll really want a fast zoom and high frame rate.  You won't want to miss 'the shot' and those together will help.  With portraiting, frame rate isn't very helpful since you want to keep things composed and take your time.  Landscape, wide angle lenses work best for obvious reasons, and there you won't need a high frame rate either.<br>  <br>  As far as sharpness goes.  Get the sharpest image you can with the lens.  Then, in post processing you can sharpen more (such as would be for cityscapes) or soften a little, if needed, for portraits.

I had been assaulted in a bar. A drunk busted a beer bottle over my head and, for the most part, separated my ear from my head. It actually severed two minor arteries and I bled an extremely large amount of blood. This, however, was NOT the most pain. My adrenaline was running so much during the altercation that I didn't really feel it too much. I was in pain and light-headed, but it was not horrible. The ambulance took me to the hospital where a nurse in the emergency room pushed two of her fingers into my open wound to close the arteries. THAT didn't hurt either. The joy of adrenaline. Then, a doctor came and said to the nurse, "Please move your fingers, so I can take a look." She took them out, I LOST my adrenaline, and THEN, OH MY, THEN, she put them back in my wound, back into my skull to close the two severed arteries.TALK about pain. IT was so intense, I threw up from it. It took them 5 hours of surgery and 78 stitches to put my ear back on my head. <br>  <br>  Emotionally, well....that story, has been buried deep within, and I am not going to share it so easily, But I can assure you that it was more pain than the physical pain described above....|`|35274e2053698369bf4a9870b0cdac59aa	Physical- I had a cyst in my throat that had to be surgically removed when I was 10, and then a tube that drained the rest of the cyst.

They will be the James Merediths, with the noble sense of purpose that enables them to face jeering and hostile mobs, and with the agonizing loneliness that characterizes the life of the pioneer. They will be old, oppressed, battered ***** women, symbolized in a seventy two year old woman in Montgomery, Alabama, who rose up with a sense of dignity and with her people decided not to ride segregated buses, and who responded with ungrammatical profundity to one who inquired about her weariness: "My feets is tired, but my soul is at rest."

PTdy6TWRaa	What you may be looking for is called "ascii art". If you google search for ascii art you find many sites with thousands of examples of artwork created using only ascii text symbols.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately not all ascii art works on all web pages anymore as CSS formatting on the web pages can alter the position, size and shape of text characters. So, if you find some cool ascii art and want to paste it into a message on a site like this one you'll find that the design will become a bit scrambled or distorted. You'd need to manually tweak your design to compensate for the CSS formatting on the web page that you're using it on. Or, if you're using it on a page that permits html coding you could use the appropriate html font tags to override the CSS on that page so that your piece will display properly.

HUDjXVOyaa	Dieting and what you eat is very much like a form of physical medicine. Lemons boost the emune system,..food is medicine. <br>  <br>  Painting and art is very much like a form of psychological or mental health. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you can combined these two ideas some how.|`|DP3rQkrtaa	dietitian make a lot of money and it is hard to be a famous painter since there is so many of them out there.|`|DEHN1qmraa	We can tell you this and that, but ultimately the decision is YOURS and yours alone.  When you make a big decision such as this, don't make this just about MONEY.  Search within your soul what is it you really LOVE doing?  If being an artist is what your heart desires but you think about dietitian making more money, but in the long run, are you going to be happy?  You might make a lot of money if you don't enjoy what you do, you will not last in that field, then what's the point?  You will end up broke if you realize it isn't what you really want so you quit. <br>  <br>  So don't ask us to make this decision for you.  Know in your heart what you want to do or to be in the future.  Painter/Artist can make good money too, but any profession, it takes a lot of hard work and dedication to be successful, in any field.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the luck, and it seems to me that you are smart enough to decide YOUR future.  Again, listening to others is great, but ULTIMATELY it is YOUR decision, so there will be no regrets or pointing fingers ;-).<br>  <br>  Goodluck.|`|3ERx4opSaa	well ask yourself this, are you a follower or a leader?<br>  <br>  If a follower, you will want to arrange the affairs of others, cater to them such as a dietitian would.<br>  <br>  If a leader, one can not contain themselves for other people, they must spew their creativity into art.|`|rh5vbol9aa	Aj can be yours ideal!|`|ZB9zkbxxaa	Follow your heart<br>  <br>  Do what YOU want to<br>  <br>  Be the master of your destiny|`|oGdUIrwBaa	First you have to ask yourself where you see yourself in the next 5 to 10 years. The thing is, this world is much different that it was 20-30 years ago. The professions we choose now may not be the ones we are able to keep for a very long time. That is, people are moving around these days in their careers and will in the future as well. There is no one job that you will have to be in for the rest of your life. This means that even though it is economically wise to be a dietitian, you may instead move around in the sciece field as you see fit. This also applies to the art field. <br>  <br>  <br>  Moreover, you don't necessarily have to sacrifice one thing for another. You can be a dietitian and still keep painting as a hobby. Or, you may be a painter and still have a part time dietitian job somewhere. <br>  <br>  <br>  Anyways, the decision is yours, I just want to eliterate the fact that you are not making a final decision yet because the world is ever-changing. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|qKMph7KEaa	No one can make that decision but you; it's your future, and we certainly don't know what's right for others.<br>  <br>  However, I'd say being a dietitian is a much more realistic and financially secure goal than being an artist.

Also, all the while we are at the beginning, or in the middle we are busy in mind and not thinking about the outcome so much. The obstacles seem bigger at the end because then we have to think about what we are going to do afterwards and our guidance is poorer by then.

It's like climbing a hill while looking down at your feet. The climb seems harder and harder as you climb higher and higher, but once you reach the flat ground at the top and look back down the hill, it's easy to conclude that "wow, good thing I didn't give up at the most difficult section!".<br>  <br>  It's like a mathematical function that always has a positive first derivative that only exists in a finite domain, say a<x<b, where  a and b are constants. The absolute maximum of the function will always exist at b, where the function is cut off and therefore cannot go any higher. If we model the perceived difficulty of a task as a function of time, since the difficulty always increases, wherever the function ends, ie. reaches its largest value possible within the given domain, the task will always seem the most difficult.|`|RvmYqQtRaa	Oddly I've only noticed it in the physical world.

376abf017f5ceda0dc7a5f6414b42db2aa	I know what you mean. August is way too far away. On Amazon it says that Blood Promise will be 480 pages long. I guess the actual page count could always change in between now and August 25th. Isn't that lame? They changed the date on us again. Are they seriously gonna make us wait another five days? :lol<br>  <br>  Anyway, what I think will happen in book 4 is that Rose will travel to Siberia to look for Dimitri. I remember reading a post Mead left in her yahoo group about Rose spending some time in Siberia, so that will be exciting to read. I really hope that she runs into Dimitri's grandmother. She's psychic right? So maybe she'll have a guide to help her find him.<br>  <br>  Dimitri has to come back some how you know. It just wouldn't be right to cut him out now and have Rose fall for somebody else. Every book so far has brought something new where it concerns Rose and Dimitri's relationship with each other. It just wouldn't make any sense if he DIDN'T come back.<br>  <br>  I really think that Rose will have to save him. It was something about that part where she was on the plane freaking out about the ghosts in Shadow Kiss. When she saw that blackness growing around Andre. I always thought it was like a portal to the world of death. Because Andre and Lissa's parents were sort of "beckoning" to her to come back with them. That's what I got out of it anyway. Maybe she'll have to rescue Dimitri's soul from that place. It's probably stuck in some sort of limbo or something.<br>  <br>  What I really want to see is Lissa growing up and taking charge of her own life. She is way too dependent on Rose to take care of things, and I want her to be able to do things on her own and stick up for herself instead of waiting off on the sidelines while Rose does the dirty work. I want Lissa to be there for Rose for once, because up until now she's been pretty selfish. I like Lissa, I really do. I just want to see her grow. We've seen Rose grow so much since the start of the series. She's changed so much, and I love that she's doing something for herself for once in her life. :)|`|5VXANKHLaa	I honestly think Dimitri will come back into Blood Promise. Rose being Shadow-Kissed really set things into motion in Shadow Kiss. I keep asking myself- WHAT ABOUT ADRIAN!? I think Adrian's role is so perfect for Rose in so many ways that there are to many to name! Also what about Andre and the rest of Lissa's family? There has to be a reason why they are still on earth. Maybe Lissa's power could heal Dimitri for Rose and in return Rose could talk to Andre in the dead world. Everyone has to look at the whole picture and truly understand why the charcters are in the series at all.<br>  <br>  I agree with you that there is no way to actually leave Dimitri completely out of the book because he is so important to the story line. Dimitri as a Strogi could be hard to fight let alone kill if he was as good as he was when he still had his soul. I think some way Dimitri could still feel what he had with Rose without his soul. What if Rose just cannot kill Dimitri? What if she gets scared and freezes up? Looking over all the books in the series every time she comes close to killing a Strogi she ALWAYS has the help from her friends or Dimitri. She can do much damage but I don't believe she can really kill Dimitri. No one will actually know till we read the book and find out for our selves. Everyone predicts and predicts and then WHOA! were shocked for a fourth time by Richelle Mead.<br>  <br>  No one every thought about if Rose does'nt let Dimitri live? She promised Adrian to give him a chance. I really don't get why every one is against him but if she ends up with him it will be a suprise. Richelle Mead isn't going to write something sappy sweet thats exactly like you want it. She needs to change it up and keep teens interested in the series and what she writes. I do like Dimitri but still what if?<br>  <br>  Everyone is going to be surprised but I won't be suprised if a few tears are shed and if laughs escape our mouths. Roses dead world is going to twist and shape Blood Promise right in front of our eyes.

The claims are just that... the documents used to support it are forged.<br>  <br>  I don't deny that Armenians and Turks suffered a lot, died a lot and murdered a lot during that civil war, but before Armenians start pushing their elderly to the front to cry genocide, they should account for the torture and death of my great-grandfather in the hands of his two Armenian neighbors in Anatolia.

Somebody was present when Hitler said this sentence? Who?...<br>  After all, fake teardrops are so efficient for fooling people, right?<br>  As if the Armenians had killed nobody...(sigh)<br>  <br>  And, if the Arrmenians want to compare mass killings, I suggest everyone to take a look at the dark pages of the western countries history...<br>  How ironic is the fact that they are trying to get the support of the Europeans and the Americans...<br>  North America, a land that is 31 times bigger than Turkey, and that has now almost no Native Indians...This is not a genocide perpetrated by the English, the French and the Spaniards?...

HORACAnlaa	No he's not referring to me but it is a very true about many atheists. The normal human desire seems to be convert others to your belief what ever that belief is. Atheists can be crusaders as much as any religious person is or can be. Atheism in and of itself is not that interesting -- I always want to know someone's thought process on how they arrived at their view point then just having them express their view point. <br>  <br>  By the way, Einstein, myself, said he only believed in Spinoza's God, which means he only believes in a God that is the same as the laws of the universe. In other words, he was an Atheist.|`|AA11564934	No, I was not really indoctrinated as a youth.|`|6e5c9606952e60fc17250bf668baaa41aa	I wish more people answering this question would have stated if they were atheists themselves; I suspect that many of those who agreed may not be.  I think this based on two things.  First, the above quote really doesn't fit any atheist I know of, including myself.  Second, it has been my very, very frequent experience that many believers hold some very distorted views of what atheists are and how we think.<br>  <br>  As I mentioned, I don't think that Einstein quote applies to me.  I too have been more or less a lifetime atheist.  I was not specifically raised atheist; I did attend church and Sunday school at a fairly young age.  But religion never caught on for me, and even as a child I can recall thinking how bizarre and nonsensical some of the beliefs and bible stories were.  While I have met atheists who have gone through that "painful act of liberation," I am not one of them, because I was never a captive to begin with.<br>  <br>  Also, it's been my experience that much of the pain of liberation comes not from wrestling with inner demons and existential questions, but in simply dealing with intolerant friends & family who think you've converted to communism and/or satanism.  (As I said, a lot of religious people REALLY don't understand atheists or atheism.)|`|yaq7oaH6aa	The "professional atheist" is not happy with his choice, <br>  and is looking for confirmation.<br>  The "true atheist" doesn't care a fig if you agree or not.<br>  He may feel sorry for a 'believer', but will not try to relieve <br>  him of his illusions unless he feels that they're causing suffering <br>  or other harm.|`|24253948712de5dd1f43afb45a3a6dcbaa	An Atheist and an scientist are two different things, they are not the exact same thing|`|u4Zu2v0Paa	Yes, he was talking about me and only me.

M0bE2IBQaa	The novel Q&A and the movie are very similar. Usually most movies that were originally books leave out main or important facts.  But both start off the same: a jail cell in Mumbai where a young man is being held and the cops are trying to get an answer out of him as to how an Indian from the Slums became a millionaire on a television show.<br>  <br>  And the book actually does mention Latika many times. After all, the main reason Jamal goes on the show is because he knew that she was a big fan of the show and he knew that she'd be watching. He was trying to find her.
70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	The best "Darth" names are the ones whose name ties in with their personality.<br>  <br>  Take the classic Darth Vader. Vader is a cool name, because it sounds like "invader", which is what he does. Vader also means "father" in dutch. <br>  <br>  Darth Bane? Created the rule of two, forged the Sith into a far stronger entity than it was. He is, literally, the Bane of the Jedi's existence.<br>  <br>  Darth Sidious? "Insidious"? the way he insidiously usurped the Republic and turned it into an empire?<br>  <br>  Darth Maul? The guy has a freakin' double bladed lightsaber! He "mauls" anyone that gets close enough for him to stick his lightsaber in!<br>  <br>  Darth Nihlus? (baddie of KOTOR2), the guy is a hole in the force that eats force sensitives! Comes from the word "Nihilism", which is the philosophy that the universe is meaningless and only exists to be destroyed.<br>  <br>  Darth Traya? (Other baddie in KOTOR2), was named by the fact that they were betrayed by virtually everyone that was important to them. Be-traya-l.<br>  <br>  So for your Darth, you should come up with a Darth name which reflects their personality. Then crack out a thesaurus and look for cool sounding names. Is this Sith horribly Ugly? Darth Hidious. Are they cruel? Darth Maniaco. Are they cunning? Darth Viperian. <br>  <br>  It should reflect their character, and as you have not given us character traits, all we are doing is throwing random thoughts in the air. You should decide what kind of character you want them to be, then work with adjectives of said character. You'll feel much better knowing that your name was your own.|`|QpYG9bqTaa	Darth Cronius<br>  Darth Tormenta..?<br>  Darth Malack<br>  Darth Dracul<br>  Darth Cerberos<br>  <br>  Haha, I dunno :)|`|njIyzzloaa	gift card<br>  <br>  <a href="http://giftcardnew.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://giftcardnew.blogspot.com/</a>
1XRHUCvtaa	No. Happiness, like all other feelings and, well everything, is rooted in physics. There is no mystical feeling that we create from nothing through a process of choice which pops out of thin air.<br>  <br>  Happiness is biochemical. When certain things happen, the brain is programmed to respond with certain nerve impulses and hormone releases that we perceive as 'happiness'. There is never any choice involved.|`|nM7xmhgiaa	No. It is the natural state of the self. It is unhappiness that is the choice of the ego.|`|5eoO6qosaa	Yes it is. And not choosing is also a choice.|`|46fouwFfaa	I think so. You choose how you perceive and thus feel about things.|`|V1IipJkGaa	Is breathing a choice, is hating a choice, how about honesty?<br>  Different things will bring happiness to all different people,  There is reason to believe that are no two people exactly alike, not even twins, not even clones.  Each finding happiness, or not, in their own way.<br>  <br>  The answer is, yes, finding happiness occasionally can be affected by some choice of yours, but is highly unreliable and gone again, before you know it.|`|WK2FqyC6aa	it depends because if you really want to be happy sometimes you need to sacrifice things that even the consequences may lead you to a "not-so-good" path. if you choose to be happy then all you have to do is to make it happen. because not all happiness is being gained when you sacrifices there are still a way where you are really destined to be happy.|`|m6ZFQV1qaa	Not really, because you can't force true happiness.|`|UNyG5Iw2aa	Yes, definitely. And the happier you choose to be the more neat things will happen in your life.|`|VdcKrxthaa	absolutely buddy.|`|F5v5Qme0aa	Yes, of course.  It's all in our perspective.|`|rCWZkrsDaa	in my experience it is ( : )
P7Ae8j2Xaa	Yes, because you always know when you're truly happy, but love is tricky...many times it can be confused with admiration and obsession. Love is a part of happiness, but there can be many kinds of love, like love for your family, your job, a place, etc...romantic love is more deceptive because most of the time it's based on physical aspects.|`|FOaypoRtaa	No !   True love can be found find, then most of us cant expect the experience. We start fights in our relationship or outsiders  (family friends) break us up. True love can be found listen to your heart and how you feel around your beloved. Listen to nothing else. I know as I lost mine through neglect and know very unhappy.|`|OqlXBUsaaa	since happiness comes more frequently, yes.<br>  whereas love comes "mysteriously".<br>  <br>  happiness is within ourselves, but love comes with an "object" most often.<br>  <br>  both comes naturally (and without reservations), in any ways|`|bbr2v6Jkaa	No I think they are the same, true love is feeling true happiness as well. the two are tied as one.

True, I don't even know what that is.|`|XxDQGEalaa	Yes, because the only variable needed is yourself.|`|lWEWhyTtaa	I think that true love is the vehicle through which we attain true happiness.<br>  <br>  Many people that read this will automatically insinuate that true love is always for a person.  While that may be true for some it is not true for others. <br>  <br>  True love can be of an object, idea or activity.  <br>  <br>  If someone is truly happy, it is because they truly love something.<br>  <br>  Do you think this would be a good topic for a college admissions essay?|`|F5v5Qme0aa	Yes, without a doubt. Because true happiness requires only ourselves. <br>  <br>  True love requires another person's participation, that's always the tricky part.  Unless your idea of "true" love, is to love one self, which is cool too.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Yes both are unique. Words will be failing to describe the true picture.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	I doubt you will know one without the other.
InAICv25aa	I don't think you're really looking to start reading 1000 page novels without any good love scenes, so you might be a little disappointed with Jane Eyre. I mean, it's a fantastic book, but it really has very little in common with Twilight, and it isn't exactly what I'd call an "intimate book."<br>  <br>  My recommendations: <br>  --Summers at Castle Auburn by Sharon Shinn<br>  --Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead <br>  --Black Magician by Trudi Canavan<br>  --Tales of the Otori by Lian Hearn<br>  --Black Jewels by Anne Bishop<br>  <br>  Summers at Castle Auburn is very sweet and romantic (barely any kissing involved) but a kind of fairy-tale story with dashing princes and elf-like creatures called the Alora. Must read.<br>  <br>  Vampire Academy is pretty much high school life with vampires and half-vampires, which are called dhampirs. The heroine is a dhampir who has a sizzling relationship going on with her mentor. It gets darker, though.<br>  <br>  Talk about relationship with mentors, the Black Magician trilogy is all about that. Sonea isn't a noble, but she has so much raw magical talent that the pretentious magical community has to train her. There isn't really any romance until the third book, but it's definitely worth it. I'd say if you could only read one out of all these five. Pick this one.<br>  <br>  Tales of the Otori is set in a sort of world similar to that of ancient Japan. The romance is only a part of the whole story, which is filled with Ninjas, battles for power, scheming lords, etc.<br>  <br>  Be a little careful of Black Jewels. It's a little dark and there are a little bit of disturbing themes. Plus, the romance is there, but oh well... It's worth a read. :)|`|UVnr7wrmaa	Jane Eyre by Charlottle Bronte is a must-read. At the begining, it tells of her horrible childhood living with her aunts and cousins, and then moving on to a poor school. But later on, she finally finds love. It's a great story, extremely well-written.<br>  <br>  Also, some other great romantic books are:<br>  <br>  Pride and Prejudice.<br>  <br>  Wuthering Heights.<br>  <br>  Romeo and Juliet.<br>  <br>  Jessica by Bryce Courtenay. (One of my personal favourites :) )<br>  <br>  And if you've read Twilight, and enjoyed what you read, you'd love her other book, The Host.|`|fjAdjVhkaa	So many<br>  <br>  Read The Vampire Academy, The House of Night series, The Blue Bloods series.  Oh Mortal Instruments: The City of Glass, The City of Bones, etc...<br>  Wake<br>  Oh, read the Drak Hunter series by Sherrilyn Kenyon. Theres 30, they are all romantic, and have vampires and greek gods/goddesses.<br>  <br>  Any Eva Ibbotson book: The Countess Below stairs, A Company of swans (my fave of hers), etc...<br>  <br>  I could keep going, but you have alot of reading to do.  :)|`|0vlm2OZcaa	1.

AA12380236	1: RELAX. The college admissions people aren't mean and mysterious and secretly hating you. They're going to be your professors, and while you are auditioning for them, at the same time you can evaluate how they are. If they're not nice, I wouldn't think you'd want to go there. My audition experience at one college helped me realize that I didn't want to go there, as the professors were rude, impatient, and uncaring. <br>  <br>  2: RELAX. You will have a better audition if you don't stress and get tense. (Which is easier said than done, I know.) <br>  <br>  3: Schedule. I don't know exactly how your audition day will run, as I auditioned for music programs, not theater, but it should be pretty similar. Is it an all-day event? Then you'll arrive in the mid-morning, usually, and sign-in. They should have told you where and when to sign-in on some audition confirmation or on the school website. If not, call them before and ask. <br>  <br>  After you sign-in, you may go on a tour of the school, or sit in a little meeting/presentation by the dean or a professor on the day and the school. At some point you may be able to sit in on a class. You might eat lunch in the dining hall. Enjoy it and get a feel for the school. Talk to any students you see, and ask them about the professors, the dorms, the shows they put on, how much music or dance will be required of you. (Make your friends before you need them!) <br>  <br>  They will tell you where and when your audition will be. I'm assuming it will be in the theater. When you sign-in, ask what to do with your music. They will either take it, or tell you to keep it with you.<br>  <br>  So, the audition. You will walk onto the stage, smiling and confident. (Have your tape with you!) Tell them good morning/afternoon, ask how they are, introduce yourself. Tell them you have a taped accompaniment. (They will tell you want to do with it.) They will settle down, ask you a few mundane questions, and then ask you what you will be auditioning with in the way of monologues. Tell them. "Okay," they'll say, "let's hear the [insert play] first." Do it beautifully. They may write some things down. Then they'll ask you to do the second. After that, they'll probably ask you how much musical experience you have, and then you'll sing. A few more questions, a few more moments of the circus, and you're free. Thank them and wait until you're out in the hallway to die, if you so choose. <br>  <br>  You'll be fine! Just relax! Remember, all of us have lived through it, so there's no reason why you will "die." Honestly. And think of how good you'll feel once you're through! <br>  <br>  Break a leg!|`|K0Cn5ntlaa	Every audition is different. Just follow directions in a polite and outstanding way, do your best on your music, and if it's meant to be THAT audition then it will be THAT audition ;}|`|DJyk5hWJaa	follow the guidelines of the audition when you get there, because each audition and the requirements are different. they usually tell you when to start-about it-if they are not ready for you to start and you start belting out notes, that would be quite awkward. try to look the part you are auditioning for as well
ksUksniqaa	Victorian/Romantic styles always have a place.  Since texting has become so popular, you will find symbols or partial words within a poem that are simple place holders for the real word.<br>  <br>  I don't like ppl or lol in a poem; to me the words are the magic within poetry, not texting spacers.<br>  <br>  Are you strong enough to write what you want and accept the rejection?

I remember reading it for an English class in college and being struck by the imagery of the poem and just the notion of it.  I knew Dickenson often wrote about dark things, but there's something about the poem that speaks of something other than the obvious.  It's oddly hopeful in it's own somber way.  Perhaps a bit naive to be fair, but the care she put into crafting the poem is just tremendous.  The pacing is nothing short of phenomenal in how things pass by in their own time.  It's a dense poem, but still has a lot going on at the surface level.
fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	The slaves which ended in America were "lucky" when compared with those who ended in Arab and Turkish hands (some 95% of those captured). First they were marched across the Sahara then selected- the youth ended up either as sex slaves or as slave soldiers. Those too old to be brainwashed ended in stone quarries and mines- and lived very short and brutal lives. Those who ended as slave soldiers (Janissaries, Mameluks, Saqualiba, etc.) were used as "cannon fodder" in tribal battles- since they were slaves they had no real value to the arab tribes.<br>  <br>  Slavery was always evil. However there are great differences between how varius cultures treated their slaves- eg. China imported only castrated men from Africa- but then treated them relatively well. <br>  <br>  A good example of how slaves were treated is the number of their descendants living in the various "importer" countries. Arabia and Turkey- zero. Barbary states (north Africa)- zero...<br>  <br>  The impact on Africa was greatest- whole areas were completely depopulated (a process which still continues- eg in Darfur).

bMbFw8dwaa	I am right in the middle of my first writing and my ending has become my middle. I got stuck on a certain part and I put it down for awhile. I asked myself how would my characters describe and tell my story. I actually wrote sales pitches in each character's voice from their individual point of view. My least important characters had the best sales pitches because they were looking in on the story from start to finish. This exercise was hilarious because it pushed me creatively. I have an ending but it will probably change because of the flow and connecting of the story. I don't like sappy or predictable endings. I want my reader to see themselves in my characters. I want my characters to do what my reader wants to do but is afraid to do. I am seeing a side of myself that's scary but I love putting these thoughts to words.|`|rOKRvcgpaa	I sometimes have an idea about the ending, but I don't let it drive the piece because it usually ends up changing as I get to know my characters and become more involved in the story.<br>  <br>  You should try to read as much as possible if you want to be a writer :)|`|P7Ae8j2Xaa	It can happen any way. Sometimes I write one with a compelling ending and work up to the end. Sometimes I think of an interesting character and create a story around it. Sometimes it also takes me some time to get the end. It doesn't matter where your train of thought starts from, as long as it's all well organized and wrapped up when you're finished with it.<br>  <br>  It's definitely fine not to know the ending; if more ideas pop in your head incorporate them into your original script, the more ideas you get, and the more times you edit it, the better it will come out in the end.
Viec3YH9aa	The Short Parliament - was named so because is only lasted 3 weeks (13 April 1640 – 5 May 1640).  It was the first parliament called by King Charles I, as he needed money to fight one of wars, against the Scotts.  He declared it closed other only 3 weeks, as they were not giving him the money he needed, and instead were talking about matters since the last sitting in 1629.<br>  <br>  A Rump parliament is the Parliament made up of the only a small number of the original parliament.  Usually is the people that are left in the parliament, after all the others have left, been expelled, or jailed.  So basically is a very pliable one, and doesn't have the greatest legitimacy.

It was named as such due to the fact that it could only been dissolved with the agreement of the members, something they did not do until 1660.  It sat from 1640 to 1649, when the Rump Parliament replaced it, due to the Cromwell's removal of a large number of the parliamentarians.  Then it was revived in 1658 with the same members from pre-1649, and went until 1660.|`|ZB9zkbxxaa	Long Parliament<br>  Session of the English Parliament summoned in November 1640 by Charles I, so named to distinguish it from the Short Parliament of April–May 1640.<br>  <br>  Charles called the session to raise the money needed for his war against the Scots. Resistant to Charles's demands, the Parliament caused the king's advisers to resign and passed an act forbidding its own dissolution without its members' consent. Tension between the king and Parliament increased until the English Civil War broke out in 1642. After the king's defeat (1646), the army, led by Thomas Pride, exercised political power and in 1648 expelled all but 60 members of the Long Parliament. The remaining group, called the Rump, brought Charles to trial and execution (1649); it was forcibly ejected in 1653. In 1659, after the end of Oliver Cromwell's protectorate, the Parliament was reestablished; those who were excluded in 1648 were restored to membership. The Parliament dissolved itself in 1660.<br>  <br>  I haven't heard about the remaining two

rVhrVyRGaa	Samuel Hopkins Adams (January 26, 1871 to– November 15, 1958) was an American writer, best known for his investigative journalism.<br>     Adams was born in Dunkirk, New York. In 1891, he graduated from<br>   Hamilton College.<br>    From 1891 to 1900, he was a reporter for the New York Sun and then<br>   joined McClure's Magazine, where he gained a reputation as a<br>   muckraker for his articles on the conditions of public health in the<br>   United States. In a series of eleven articles he wrote for Collier's Weekly in 1905, "The Great American Fraud", Adams exposed many of the false claims made about patent medicines, pointing out that in some cases these medicines were damaging the health of the people using them. The series had a huge impact and led to the passage of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act.<br>  <br>  (More available here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Hopkins_Adams)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Hopk...</a>|`|gb1BGP8xaa	Is this for homework?

Yep it's that hard. <br>  <br>  I'm sure most have day jobs and just write on the side, even successful ones. In order to do writing full time you have to be big like J.K.Rowling, Stephanie Meyer, Stephen King. Or write many many books. The average writer makes only about $20,000 a year.

The truth about the publishing world is that you really need "an in" to get published and to make a decent buck off it.  The big authors out there get paid a set fee for their material along with a percentage of royalties.  You'd probably just get a small commission for your material.  Certainly not enough to live off unless you hit upon the next "Harry Potter" or something.    <br>  What you have posted is quite accurate.  The publishing industry is a very closed industry and the majority of great novels never see the light of day as a result.  <br>  Best of luck to you.

Or, what my group does is we put on REALLY small, low budget shows that take little time to prepare, we sell cheap tickets, and we make people laugh. Then, once you have about 800 dollars go rent a theater! You can also rent it for rehearsal spaces. They show my group is doing now is A Midsummers Night Dream (shakespeare). Renting the theater for 4 shows and rehearsals cost us about 800 dollars. I hope you get to put it on!

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	Sure you can.  The quality may not be quite as good as pictures printed from a photo lab, and you will use a lot of ink, but there is no reason why you can't print pictures from your computer at home.<br>  <br>  In fact, sometimes I wonder why people take the memory card from their digital camera to a photo lab to get the pictures printed.  Doesn't that kind of defeat the whole purpose of having a digital camera?  I thought the reason why people wanted to use a digital camera in the first place was because it was faster and more convenient.  So why do they bother taking the memory card (or cd) to a photo lab??  They say they don't want to use film anymore....but then they still take their digital pictures to a photo lab to get printed.  Then what's the point??<br>  <br>  I mostly prefer using film, because I think the quality with my film cameras is much better than a cheap digital camera.  But I do have an 8 megapixel digital camera that I just use to take snapshots with my friends and family.  When I use the digital camera, I just print the pictures on my printer at home.  If you want, some printers also have a tray for 5X7 photo paper, so you can also use that.  If you have a good quality printer, the pictures will look just as good as from a typical 1-hour photo lab.<br>  <br>  Well, the pictures from a digital camera will.  Film is an entirely different thing.  Pictures from a good film camera, with properly exposed film, developed at a professional photo lab, will blow away any "pics" from a digital camera.|`|uXHnwqxjaa	Yea you do.  But nowadays... online printing is so cheap.. its easy and cheaper.. so just send your photos to a nearby Walgreens or photo place and pick them up.

The colours are more accurate and the resolution and detail on the prints is good. <br>  A regular inkjet may print images that are good enough to use, but nothing phenomenal. Laser printers just won't work.<br>  <br>  If you intend to use the images or to frame/display them I would recommend a dedicated photo printer (It doesn't have to be one of the really exquisite expensive ones).|`|428bfb540e75abb891d4cffcb6929ec2aa	You need a photo printer, you might already have it though, check the specs of your printer, Google it if you have to. Most printers nowadays will do an ok job. If you have an Epson or Canon printer, odds are the answer is yes. HP probably. And there are others, just look up what yours is.<br>  <br>  Generally a photo printer will let you select the exact kind of paper you will be using for best results. You need to go through some setup menus and check Lustre or Gloss or Matte depending on the type of paper you're using. Some printers will let you chose the exact brand and type of paper you're using. It makes a big big difference in the quality of the print to be able to do that.|`|PKMmke64aa	What kind of photographs? <br>  <br>  Digital images are easily printed at home using a Inkjet style printer. Inkjet printers use inkjet photo paper. Those printers are available at almost any office/electronic retailer.<br>  <br>  Film photos? Those you need a darkroom to make and they aren't "printed" using a printer. They are developed on special chemical based papers.

In the vicinity of Rome, people had Latin rights which essentially meant they were equal to the inhabitants of Rome itself, except that they did not have the right to vote. Outside of areas with Latin rights were jurisdictions assigned Italian rights, which forced them to provide soldiers to the Roman army in exchange for a reasonable degree of self government. Outside of Italian rights areas were provinces, who were ruled directly by Rome and had to pay taxes. (Roman citizens, in contrast, did not have have to pay taxes. I suppose they were part of society as a whole, but they were not by any means equal, if that is what you are looking for.<br>  <br>  Today, when we go to war, we don't often do as the Romans. We don't stay for an indefinite about of time as the Romans did. For example, we once held as possessions Cuba and the Philippines, but we relinquished our claims to both. The same holds true for the American held portion of Germany after WWII, as we eventually left. In that way, we aren't especially like the Romans becuase we don't stay for very long, let alone welcome the conquered into our society.
bMbFw8dwaa	I went to a book signing of one my favorite authors and the best advice he gave was get the story out of your head and onto paper. You have a lifetime to tweak it. If you get caught up in how a character is coming off, you delay completing the story. I personally like a character in development. I am almost finish with my first novel and things I couldn't get in the first book, I plan to put in a second book. A friend of mine who has been published said <br>  <br>  "It's good your character has flaws in the first book because you can explain why he is like he is in the second book. If people like the character in the first book, they will want to know more about him in the second. Don't play your audience cheap because they are more intelligent than you know. Publishers like a sequel or series. It means more money to be made."  <br>  <br>  So finish the story and push yourself creatively to make him grow from where he is. I have a character who buys every kind of shower gel in book one.  In book two I answer why the shower gel quirk. Weird, yes and I think it makes the story just that more interesting.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I will see you in the bookstore.|`|rOKRvcgpaa	you do need to at least sneak in tidbits, or drop hints.  you should never try to completely shock the reader at the end of a story, unless it's building up to it the entire time.  it makes it a disappointing work to read.|`|f3ksTSNMaa	You do it by trying to answer the questions about the character that the reader will be thinking about...the trick is how you want to reveal it, like with less important qualities you can state directly, but if you want to keep suspense, only reveal the interesting things about a person through their actions and thoughts. I also noticed you said "at first". It seems like you're on the right track if you want the protagonist to be mysterious, because you don want to reveal everything, just keep the audience wondering. Hope i helped!|`|7j9MfenOaa	When I do stories like that, I make a bio.  Just have a separate sheet of paper (or Word document) and jot down everything you can think of...hair and eye color, height, weight, interests, hobbies, likes and dislikes, how far he got in school, type of car/bike he drives/rides, foods he likes and hates, any allergies he might have...anything you can think of, no matter how seemingly mundane it seems at first.  Make him come to life for you as a real person.  Visualize him.  It takes a bit of time, but I've found that it makes it a lot easier to make the person real if he is real to you.  It also helps you develop his characteristics...reactions to stimuli or events.  Not only that, but it also helps you have something to call upon if you get stuck on part of the story.|`|4e977e0718d9e088255511707db887fcaa	Make this character as human as possible. Make it so that we can believe that he could actually live. He needs to have thoughts and feelings and goals.
aBDr4XIIaa	Don't try anything TOO new if you don't have time to rehearse it. That is crucial, because if it doesn't work this could make your music teacher angry. <br>  <br>  But to be cute, you could try wringing/squeezing your teddy bear when your scared or holding him really tight. Treat him like a person. And remember, Michael is a little kid, so his emotions jump around with not much in between.|`|HfPd8cPPaa	well instead of making the teddy bear wave, kiss it and say, <br>  "teddy thinks you were a great audience.)

LEp7IFdvaa	You've had enough praise, now for some honesty and constructive critique:<br>  For someone of your age, it's pretty good.  If you wanted to improve it, you'd look closer at your word choices and make sure you're not making any malapropisms (using the wrong word).  For example, "agape arms" is inverted word order, but even "arms agape" is a bit of a stretch (no pun intended).  You think of a mouth as being agape, but arms as being oustretched.  Also, "of which are expectant of tears" following the agape arms...nope, doesn't work.  You might try, "eyes with ready tears" or "a heart full of expectant tears" (not as good, but still works).  Finally, "expectant of all you have to give" is not the same as "thankful for all you have...", it actually sounds like a negative...like the friend is constantly expecting to get something from you...and I know that was not your thinking or intent, so you need to work on that line.  It isn't a bad first draft, but I'd recommend you work on it.|`|Y8fDB2V7aa	absolutely beautiful <br>  <br>  glad you shared it with us.|`|5IaaJOIuaa	Thanks for sharing.

Aryans were from East Asia.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	Nazi Germany was designed as a racial state - the only people who would be allowed citizenship were those who were racially pure Germans. This was determined by who your grandparents were - if they were German so were you.So, the new Germany was expanded to include Austria and Sudeten Czechoslovakia, as these included majority racial German population. The German 'Master Race' or Ubermensch would need room to expand - Lebensraum, or 'living space' in the east, so it was necessary to wage wars of conquest to Germany's east.<br>   The purpose of all this? Hitler and the Nazis believed in Social Darwinism, or 'survival of the fittest' - they were convinced that if the German Volk (people) were 'contaminated' by interbreeding, or even contact with, inferior races (untermensch) they would weaken and eventually die out. As German was a racial, not a political definition under the Nazis, all racially pure Germans were eligible for citizenship in Nazi Germany, wherever they came from or lived. All non-pure Germans, the untermensch, were by definition excluded from German citizenship, regardless of the nationality of their ancestors, place of birth, or residence. The role of such people in the Third Reich was confined to slave labour (such as the Slavs) or extermination (Jews, Gypsies and so on) to keep the German Volk pure.

For example in the Central Europe, early renaissance is considered still medieval even when first printed books, art; architecture appeared at the end of the 15th century. This renaissance culture, art, and architecture flourished in society where economy, social order and religious structure was still medieval.  Hungarian kingdom and Italy were influenced by renaissance much earlier than German states, France, and England.  The cut off time is either the end of the 100 year war (1453) which corresponds to the same year to a fall of Constantinople.  Others use the discovery of Americas in 1492.  Some scholars in Germany consider the year 1517 with introduction of the Protestant movement as the end of medieval era.  In Czech Lands, Hungary, and Austria is usually considered year 1526, when Hapsburgs obtained the throne of three kingdoms in central Europe and started to build centralized state.  Politically the medieval state ended by 15th century; culturally renaissance symbolized the new era.  However, England and Northern Europe was still deeply gothic when Italian cities were in their peak of the renaissance culture. Anyway, until 1450, there was time we called Medieval Era; by 1525 it was no more.  So somewhere in this time frame one order had dies, and new one was born.|`|70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	Generally speaking, the middle ages officially end with the Catholic counter-reformation, which effectively divided Europe into warring Catholic/Protestant nations, around 1600 CE.<br>  <br>  The idea of the Renaissance being a golden age after the dark Middle Ages is somewhat antiquated. Surely European Art experienced a Renaissance, but life for the average peasant went virtually unchanged through this period, and certainly would not have seen themselves as living in a golden age. The term "Early Modern Era" is preferred now, as the Early Modern Era marks the movement of European nations away from feudalistic kingdoms into large nation-states with powerful central governments and professional, standing armies. The arrival of gunpowder, the rediscovery of military theory, and logistics (backed by states large enough to support large military logistics) heralded the end of the classical knight and man-at-arms style of warfare, as well as contributed to the dissolution of economic feudalism and the separation of classes into the capital gaining Bourgeoisie middle class and the working proletariat class. This was not necessarily a better change, however, as research seems to indicate that social Malaise like poverty, warfare, religious and political persecution intensified in this era when compared to the Middle Ages, which was comparatively a sleepy era.<br>  <br>  The use of the Renaissance as an end-point for the middle ages is made further problematic by the fact that the Renaissance occurred in separate times for separate places. The Italian Renaissance started in the 13th century with the artists Cimabue and Giotto. England didn't experience the Renaissance until the 15th century.<br>  <br>  The Early Modern era, despite being an economically richer era, was actually much more brutal. Large central governments, religious strife, and the race colonial power stimulated huge total wars which caused untold misery upon the population. Truly widespread change, aside from the arts and sciences (which were at most the pastimes of the idle aristocracy), occurred with the rise of the nation-state|`|1hvrQYWiaa	The date generally accepted by professional historians for the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of Modern History is 1492, when Columbus discovered the New World of the Americas|`|ApG0DpzXaa	That's a trick question on many levels.<br>  <br>  The middle ages ended with the renaissance, and there is no set year for the renaissance, as there is for wars and plagues.<br>  <br>  To complicate the matter further, the renaissance started in Italy in the fifteenth century and traveled slowly north.  Accordingly the ballpark dates for the Italian renaissance are earlier than those for the English renaissance and the German renaissance etc... . <br>  <br>  A generalization is probably your best bet, explain the above if you can and go with it ended petween the 15th and 16th centuries.|`|lcneir8Raa	middle ages lasted from  476 - 1450

draNVjbkaa	If you did that on oboe, it would be an F. If you did that on saxophone, it would be a sharp sounding F. <br>  <br>  That fingering you describe produces no specific note. It doesn't even work as an alternate altissimo fingering to my knowledge.|`|VYWaL2graa	It's been a long time since I've played, but I believe that can be used as an alternate F# fingering.<br>  <br>  Nevermind that, I was thinking of the F# key.|`|yoGWCH3gaa	Okay, first off that person who said we are all idiots is completely rude and obviously has difficulties following the most simple of explanations. It's not confusing at all...<br>  <br>  The fingering you just described is not an actual note on the saxophone. It is not an alternate fingering or an altissimo fingering. That fingering is used on the Oboe, but not the saxophone. The fingerings, with the left hand 3 fingers down and right hand three fingers down would be D, remove the lowest (3rd) finger on the right hand and you get a E, then take off the next finger (your middle finger of the right hand) and you get an F. If you want an F# (Just the normal way, not the chromatic fingering with the side F#) then you have the left hand fingers all down with the middle finger of your right hand down. <br>  <br>  In short, what you have described is not the fingering for any note. <br>  <br>  Hope this has helped! :)|`|944a14c77cfd5df8decc7beffcf31f38aa	Pretty sure that's not a note at all, well not a normal one anyway... I have never played that once and I don't know why you would want to, anyway it's not an F# and I don't think its an alternate fingering either for any note. I've been playing alto sax for 5 years so I'm pretty sure about this.... a natural f would be all the three top keys plus the first on the bottom and an F# is all the three top plus the middle on the bottom...... and a low E would be three top plus the first two and a D is all the main tops and all the main bottoms.|`|4JppzNYeaa	Its an F that is a bit flat.|`|0xR5UNRpaa	HAHA <br>  Your question made me laugh so hard.<br>  Immature i know but mehh (:|`|SqzoZe4Laa	ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE CONFUSING THE HECK OUT OF ME!<br>  My mother is a PROFESSIONAL.

LOdkuFZ7aa	Maybe try to drop the jaw more as you get higher and keep your tongue low. Focus on placement so that the air is directed in the right direction. And try to imagine the sound coming out of your eyes. Sometimes you can get more head voice out of that. Go figure.<br>  <br>  For tension, massage your facial muscles before and during your vocalizing. Try sticking your tongue out or keeping it between right behind your bottom teeth and sing a random vowel like "Ah." I get so much more sound when I do it, and you have to try to learn to not let the tongue get involved in your singing. Also, make sure your posture's right. If your head is pointed downwards too much, your tongue is going to be extremely downwards.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.

Harry discovers that his parents were murdered by a dark wizard, who couldn't manage to kill Harry. The killing spell rebounded off of Harry somehow and killed Voldemort instead. Harry is famous among the witches and wizards for getting rid of Voldemort, even though he was only 1 year old when he did. Harry is sent to a school for witches and wizards. He makes friends with Ron, a street-smart boy from a long line of wizards, and Hermione, a book-smart girl from a non-magical family. When word gets out that someone tried to break into a magical vault in the wizard bank, Harry and his friends discover that The Sorcerer's Stone is hidden inside the school. The Sorcerer's Stone is powerful enough to bring Voldemort back to life, so they have to stop Voldemort's undercover helper before Voldemort gets the stone.<br>  <br>  The characters' first reaction to realizing that the vault had been broken into was to assume that Hagrid, the gamekeeper, had something to do with it.

n03LF2Jaaa	The Face on the Milk Carton <br>  by Caroline B. Cooney <br>  <br>  No one ever really paid close attention to the faces of the missing children on the milk cartons. But as Janie Johnson glanced at the face of the ordinary little girl with her hair in tight pigtails, wearing a dress with a narrow white collar--a three-year-old who had been kidnapped twelve years before from a shopping mall in New Jersey--she felt overcome with shock. She recognized that little girl--it was she. How could it possibly be true? Janie can't believe that her loving parents kidnapped her, but as she begins to piece things together, nothing makes sense. Something is terribly wrong. Are Mr. and Mrs. Johnson really Janie's parents? And if not, who is Janie Johnson, and what really happened? <br>  <br>  <br>  The next 3 book continue the story. <br>  02 - Whatever Happened to Janie <br>  03 - The Voice on the Radio <br>  04 - What Janie Found|`|SN9gY4Toaa	The best thing you can do is search it on BAM or Barnes & Noble.

In the future, there is also a paste called acrylic retarder which is an agent, usually added to water, used to slow the drying time of acrylic paints, giving more time for blending or layering highlights.<br>  <br>  Retarders are used to counter the fast drying properties of acrylic paints making possible the usage of wet on wet or other techniques which would otherwise require oil paints.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|3ERx4opSaa	well check the paint label and see if it sais permenant.

Many states have similar organizations - check with your state government offices for film and television production liaison; they usually know what's going on in their own state. They will also be aware of any associations affiliated with production, or having members interested in their own involvement in production projects.<br>  <br>  Any other types of film or video production groups could be sources, as well.  It might take a little investigation on your part, but it could repay your effort many times over.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your project.

iJzIIEdfaa	Kindling|`|AA12095483	The Vikings didn't always convert to Christianity - in their homeland, they adopted Christian thought but continued to rever their ancient gods - they just added Christianity to the mix. <br>  When the Vikings settled in other countries, if those countries were Christian the Vikings usually converted to Christianity. But you're only talking about that small percentage of Vikings who settled in other countries. <br>  Could they read the Bible? In those times, most people were illiterate. Churchmen could read, and a very few others. <br>  Did the Vikings continue to attack and kill after converting? <br>  The ones who were still living in their homeland did, because they hadn't converted. <br>  The ones who had settled in other countries and converted no longer went on raids, so they weren't into the attack and kill mode.|`|EBGdlo35aa	Christianization of the Vikings - and of all other cultures prior to the development of the printing press - was not accomplished by the distribution of the bible.  It was accomplished solely through the efforts of evangelists - through the oral preaching of the gospel of Jesus Christ.  So...<br>  <br>  <br>  1) could they read it?<br>  <br>  Most certainly could not.  Probably few, if any, of the Norse who converted to Christianity ever even saw a bible.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) did the continue to go on with the attacks and killings after converting?<br>  <br>  Certainly - but not necessarily "viking".  For example, the Normans under William the Conqueror were Christianized vikings.  They certainly did some attacking and killing, and the whole viking "blood feud" thing remained an intact part of viking culture for centuries.  However, they did not preferentially prey upon abbeys and convents after Christianization as they had done previously.  Indeed, attacks on such targets, *I believe*, fell off sharply among those vikings led by a Christian.<br>  <br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews." rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.</a> com|`|y8bFwXZEaa	Eventually most Vikings became converted to Christianity as well.

"My God is better than your God".|`|mI4lrKdHaa	When they finally got off the  ^#%$ ship they built a cottage with a couch in it and they used the bible under the corner with no leg..........cheers|`|oquP79lEaa	few people at all in that time period could read. some were converted by missionaries who spoke and told stories. a lot of times, the leader would convert and his followers would...well, follow. many converted when they settled in a christian area (such as normandy) and were assimilated by the local christian populace. <br>  <br>  the attacks kind of just petered off. they were led by different leaders, so even if one group of vikings had converted to christianity, others hadn't necessarily. often they kept attacking even after converting. there wasn't always a change in behavior when they converted.

uGmEjSLDaa	In terms of 'biggest literary trainwreck' overall, James Fenimore Cooper. The man _never_ wrote a good book. I mean, I don't like Ayn Rand, but 'Anthem' isn't entirely unreadable (if only because it's a ripoff of Zamyatin's 'We'). I don't like Balzac, but I am judging that based only on one book--others that aren't 'Le Père Goriot' could be better.<br>  <br>  I have read several of Fenimore Cooper's books, and I live in the woods, in Fenimore Cooper country. He doesn't describe it at all well. It has changed over 150 years--become a lot less populated, as there are more people in graveyards here than there are people; towns that had two marching bands (!!!) at one point now only have 300 people; the town with a small agriculture-technology college and about 4000 people at one time 150 years ago could have had a opera house.<br>  <br>  _Nevertheless_, Fenimore Cooper describes it all wrong; his books are florid and overwritten; his characters are dull; and, oh God, does he not know how to handle suspense at all. He has all the elements for great action novels, but things invariably go wrong in the execution, based solely on his lack of observation and literary talent. They shouldn't be terrible to read (I love action novels!) but they are.<br>  <br>  "The guy that wrote Huck Finn" above, Mark Twain, hates him too: <a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/railton/projects/rissetto/offense.html" rel="nofollow">http://etext.virginia.edu/railton/projec...</a><br>  <br>  'Le Père Goriot,' however, remains my least favorite single book ever, for much the same reasons as I hate Cooper. A plot about a crook trying to use a law student to defraud a rich old guy should be interesting--but Balzac manages to make it boring and as slow as molasses.|`|Z4W0V5SDaa	My favorite author right now would be Annette Curtis Klause. Everyone seemed to enjoy the book Blood and Chocolate and since I'm a lover of werewolves I decided to check it out after seeing the commercial for the movie--a dumb reason to check out a book, sue me. <br>  <br>  Anyways, I read it and it was all one big hormone, constantly throbbing and hungry for attention. The writing was horrendous and the characters even more distasteful. There was no plot until the ending and even then I had no idea what the hell I was reading. All the main character cared about was sex and while I get wolves are animals and mating and all sorts of that, sex is not part of their diet all of the time. <br>  <br>  It was completely annoying because she was stuck-up, condescending and absolutely irksome. I still til this day don't know what everyone likes about the book or how they could even get through it. I took a few hours to read it and just twenty pages from the ending I put it down. Everyone seems to complain about Stephenie Meyer, but honestly I would rather read her books a million times then finish reading Blood and Chocolate.|`|EHHczlKPaa	Lemony Snicket is a close runner-up, but for me, Christopher Paolini is the absolute worst author--if you can even call him an author--I have ever had this displeasure to read about. Not only were his ideas STOLEN from Star Wars and LOTR, they were written terribly. Now, I've heard some people that say we shouldn't be hard on him because he wrote Eragon at 16, but he chose to publish it. And I've seen fifth-graders who write better than Paolini! In fact, if his parents didn't help him out, Eragon would never have seen the light of day. He's a joke, and he didn't write a book--he gave us a substitute for firewood.<br>  <br>  Sorry for ranting, but I really dislike Eragon. My least favorite book is also Eragon. However, other books whose authors are on my 'dead to me' list are: The Series of Unfortunate Events, The Clique series, and ttfn.

Like In CloverField when Gap Model #1 ran back into a monster attacked city to save Gap Model #5 resulting in death sadness and horror.  <br>  <br>  He went back in..FOR LOVE!  and it was incredibly stupid that he did, especially considering the out come. <br>  <br>  I love Clover Field.

8IZVPSPJaa	omg i love theater games...they are so fun<br>  There's one called smile if you love me baby.  1person stands in the middle of the circle and goes to ransom ppl and says smile if you love me baby in a funny way.  then the person has to say i love you baby but i just can't smile w/o smiling.  <br>  Freeze is another good one.  u get in a circle and 2 ppl go in the middle.  they start improving something random then someone yells freeze and the 2 ppl in the middle have to freeze in their exact pose.  the person who said freeze goes up and taps one on the shoulder and takes their place.  then those 2 ppl start a completely new scene.  it's great for improv.<br>  Psychiatrist is fun for small groups.  1 person is the psychiatrist and goes out of the room.  the rest of the group decides on a problem they're all going to have.  most of the time you make it something like we all act like the person seated to your left, your all a disney princess or stuff like that. once u decide on a problem the psychiatrist comes back and he can ask each person 3 questions. stuff like what's your favorite food, what did you do today... and the person answers like the person they're impersonating.  its really fun and can last pretty long the first time.<br>  i have a ton more but i hope this helps =]|`|XxR36ICHaa	too many awesome ones...<br>  I always go to www.humanpingpongball.com<br>  there are tons of great games there!|`|7BzoYsWlaa	The most fun game I have ever played in theater class was Pokemon.<br>  Two people get up and choose a class mate as their pokemon and give them funny names like "Trevor-tron" then assign them hilarious powers like "chicken catapalt". The outcome can be hystercial. <br>  <br>  Other games: Mingling. You have your students walk around randomly then make them pretend to do things like "walking on ice".<br>  <br>  Evolution. Rock paper scissors game but with a twist. You start out as an egg and evolve into higher ranks by winning at rock paper scissors. The ranks are Egg, Chicken, Dinosaur, Human, Superhero, God-like being. <br>  <br>  1234. Have your students line up in 2 rows and have them take turns 2 at a time. One says 1234, the other says 5678. The catch is they have to say it in whatever character you choose.|`|u5nYlVMxaa	Try space jump, I love that game!<br>  <br>  Person one steps into the middle of the circle and begins doing something ie mimes swimming, dancing etc.<br>  <br>  After a certain amount of time, person two jumps in and shouts "Space Jump!" and then takes control of the situation.<br>  <br>  For example, if someone is miming dancing the second person may jump in and grab them screaming "Oh no! You're on fire! Stop drop and roll!"<br>  <br>  Person three then joins the circle and controls this situation.<br>  <br>  This can continue for as long as you like, or until the circle is too full.<br>  <br>  Then each person steps out in the order they stepped in. And as each person leaves the situation returns to how it was before they joined.<br>  <br>  Eventually person one will be the only one left.<br>  <br>   I hope this is easy enough to understand as it's a great game.<br>  <br>  Also try word association games as they sound dull but usually end up being a good laugh.<br>  <br>  <br>  For warming up voice and body try rubber chicken.<br>  <br>  You wave you left hand sixteen times, then your right hand then your left foot then right foot.<br>  <br>  Then wave 8 times for each.<br>  <br>  Then four times, then two, then one, counting aloud as you go.<br>  <br>  When you get to the last shake of your right foot, everyone screams "Rubber chicken!"<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope these were understandable and helpful.<br>  <br>  :)|`|yEiwkDmVaa	One that can be fun is to have one actor say, "I need you to..." and the other to respond with "I can't do that." They should keep repeating the same lines over and over again while using different moods, different levels of intensity, different actions, etc. It allows for working on aspects of acting other than the words being spoken. Hope that helps!|`|1yo2sJ62aa	Have you ever heard of " Hello, My name is Joe"? It's really good for Drama. I used to do it in my Drama Club. It's impossible to explain on the internet though, sorry.<br>  Also there is "This is a box" which helps concentration. I'm not very good at explaining, but I'll try. <br>  Stand in a circle. Someone starts, holds an imaginary box and hands it to the person next to them, saying "This is a Box." The person will ask, "A What?" and the 1st person replies, "A box." The 2nd person says, "Oh! A Box!" and hands it to the next person, saying, "This is a box." They will reply with, "A what?" and the 2nd person will turn to the first and ask, "a what?" as well. The 1st person will reply, "A box." They pass the message to the third person, each person saying, "A box."  The third person then takes the box, saying, "Oh, a box!", before turning to the fourth person and saying, "This is a box." The 4th person replies " A what?" the 3rd person turns to the 2nd person and asks "a what?" then the 2nd person turns to the 1st person asking "a what?". The first person replies "This is a box." They then go back with the 2nd person saying " Oh a box!" then the 3rd, then the 4th, who turns to the 5th and says, "This is a box." "A what?" and so on, back to the 1st person who tells them it is a box. <br>  It continued like this for the rest of the game. Halfway through, once they've got used to it, you add in " a tik.", and start going round the other way with people saying, "This is a tik." "a what?" " A tik." <br>  Hopefully this explanation makes sense. I can't think of any more games at the moment, sorry.|`|KlGHx3z7aa	I know of a good game called "i love you"<br>  get your group into a circle. choose one to go in the middle. <br>  the aim of the game is to keep a straight face. it requires concerntration.<br>  The person in the middle walks up to someone of their choice, and tries to make them laugh by syaing "i love you" in the funniest or most awkward way possible. the person in which they said it to, must try to keep a straight face and say "i love you too but i just can't smile". if they smile or laugh, they are out, and if they don't then they swap places with the person in the middle. <br>  It's really great fun!

1hvrQYWiaa	A sepoy was an Indian soldier in the army of the East India Company, which held a charter from the British government to run Britain's Indian empire. The officers of this army were white British, and again worked for the East India company rather than the British army.The Sepoy rebellion is better known as the Indian Mutiny, and ran from 1856 -1857.<br>   The Mutiny was an attempt to throw the British out of India and restore the Mughal emperors to power. It began when the sepoys became convinced that a newly introduced rifle cartridge, which required biting the paper end off to load, was greased with cow or pig fat.(It was in fact greased with sheep fat because of concerns about religious sensitivity amongst the sepoys). The cow was sacred to Hindus, the pig unclean to Muslims, and clever propaganda by Indian agitators convinced the sepoys that the cartridge was a secret ploy by the British to forcibly convert them to Christianity, thus damning their souls forever under their own religious beliefs.<br>   After much savagery on both sides, the Mutiny was defeated and the British government withdrew the East India Company's charter and ruled India direct, taking over control of the military in India through the regular British army.

El ser humano va madurando a lo largo de su vida, aunque a veces parezca que no va a “crecer” nunca.<br>  Las personas maduras desarrollan ese conocimiento de lo que pueden y no pueden controlar. Saben que necesitan disciplina para lograr sus objetivos. Valoran sus obligaciones tanto como sus derechos. Se estiman a sí mismos, y a los demás,<br>  Legalmente entre los dieciocho y los veintiún a?os se es mayor de edad y adulto. Sin embargo, hay otros criterios que también determinan la adultez. Así, en la cultura occidental es necesario que el sujeto haya alcanzado una serie de roles sociales como indendependizarse económicamente.<br>  Desde perspectivas psicológicas, el individuo se convierte en adulto cuando ha asumido y desarrollado determinados rasgos intelectuales, afectivos y sociales.<br>  Una persona es madura cuando:<br>  Se conoce a sí mismo, sus cualidades y limitaciones. Es realista y exigente en función de sus posibilidades.<br>  Es capaz de renunciar a intereses individuales por otras personas, ya sean familiares amigos, etc.<br>  En cuanto a sus relaciones interpersonales, respeta otros puntos de vista diferentes al suyo, es tolerante.<br>  Emocionalmente es un sujeto estable, que tolera la frustración y sabe esperar. Tiene un nivel óptimo de autocontrol, no se reprime, pero se controla, consiguiendo la mayoría de las veces un equilibrio entre su corazón y la razón.<br>  Vive el presente sin olvidar el pasado, aprendiendo del mismo y mirando hacia el futuro.

OLcXtWQyaa	since the culture had disappeared long before Europeans arrived, very little is known about many aspects of it. they definately had major villages and probably a centralized government. they had no written language, and nobody knows for sure what language they spoke.
f4Nn0W1xaa	As to your first question, I would say that it seems to be a fairly accurate if somewhat poetic assessment of Dickinson, judging purely by the primary focuses of her work. I cannot say what else there was in her life, I know her only through her poetry. Still, it seems plain that these things were all of huge significance to her.<br>  <br>  As to your second, it seems to me that the writer was referring more to the sorts of things you first offered. All of the intangibles of which each of us is aware but not always very closely in touch with. I do think that those are probably the sorts of topics the author meant by implying that she made others uncomfortable with her insights. After all she still does that to many today with her poems, think how much more unsettling it would have been, face to face, in her rather buttoned down era.<br>  <br>  So, yes, essentially I think you're right, but I think that the author was saying that it was her spoken perceptions of the intangibles that made others nervous. I don't think they were saying that her third world was that of others inability to experience those intangibles as she herself could.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure I said that as clearly as I wanted to! Interesting question though, I hope I made some sort of sense.

c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	The problem is that you have many complex, compound, run-on sentences. Most places where you use a comma should be a period.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  "I watched him open his mouth and noticed his teeth were perfect, straight and the whitest white I had ever seen, he was slim but not too slim, he looked around fifteen or sixteen, he was perfect."<br>  <br>  Should be:<br>  "I watched him open his mouth. I noticed his teeth were perfect, straight and the whitest white I had ever seen. He was slim, but not too slim. He looked around fifteen or sixteen and he was perfect ".<br>  <br>  Remember a sentence should have one subject and a verb or two unless you want to connect close ideas with "and". If you have more than one subject, you have more than one sentence.<br>  <br>  In dialogue, your quote needs a comma, as in - "Cool," I mumbled.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|WPQ77R1jaa	" 'Well see you later.'

dU4heIhaaa	Okayyy. Here I go(:<br>  <br>  Uglies Series; Scott Westerfeld<br>  So these books are pretty much amazing. At first its not very interesting but just hang in there and I promise it will be worth it. Its set in the future and the storyline is extremely compelling.<br>  <br>  Elsewhere; Gabrielle Zevin<br>  Mmm. One of my favorites. Interesting all the way through. Its about this girl who gets hit by a car and dies very young, and then goes to this place called Elsewhere, and everybody grows backwards, sort of like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button haha, but different. It sounds weird, but trust me, this is a must read(:<br>  <br>  Blue Bloods Series: Melissa De La Cruz<br>  Okay you'll probably get mad that this is about vampires, but its so different from Twilight. Theres romance, and the plot gets me every time. The book moves amazingly fast and its a great book, all of them. <br>  <br>  A Great and Terrible Beauty Series; Libba Bray<br>  Okay, definitely one of my favorite series. Its about this girl, and she has these supernatural powers. Sounds weird, I know, but its really good. I can't describe it. Haha. The entire series is filled with suspense, especially the third book, The Sweet Far Thing. Read them!<br>  <br>  Dreamland; Sarah Dessen<br>  Well most of Sarah's books are like teen girl drama books, but this one, I think is her best. Its about this girl, who's boyfriend abuses her, but she's too afraid to do anything about it. I couldn't put it down.<br>  <br>  Saving Zoe; Allyson Noel<br>  Very good book. Its about this girl who's sister was murdered, and she starts reading her sister's diary and she finds out what really happened. <br>  <br>  <br>  Sooooo all of these books are really good. Try them out(:|`|K7GTrvAOaa	I definitely recommend Artemis Fowl. There are 6 books so far. definitely not romantic like twilight however. It's a little lacking in romance until the 5th book, but definitely a fiction series full of adventure and thrilling scenes. Great for imaginative minds like ourselves! hope you'll like this one. :D<br>  <br>  -edit-<br>  oh my gosh, can't believe I forgot to recommend Flipped. That is a very heart-warming book. Nothing with magic, but it is very very good. ultimately my favorite.|`|dd70547a77d0df4afa5c10654e7c2626aa	The Uglies series by Scott Westerfield REALLY REALLY good books :) it has romance, action, suspense, and its set in the future that is totally pretty-making!

224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	One minor quibble.<br>  <br>  If he was involved, I'd call him a patriot, not a traitor.|`|AA10725882	I looked at several other sources but came back to Wikipedia as the best way to answer this.  The gestapo dragnet after the Hitler assassination attempt of 1944 was very extensive.<br>  From Wiki: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Romme...</a><br>  "Dr. Carl Goerdeler, the civilian head of the Resistance, included Rommel on a list of figures to be brought into a post-Hitler government as a possible future President of Germany.<br>  After the failed bomb attack of July 20, many conspirators were arrested, and the dragnet expanded to anyone even suspected of participating. Rommel was identified, in Goerdeler's list and other documents as a potential supporter and an acceptable military leader to be placed in a position of responsibility should their coup succeed.<br>  Still, no evidence directly linked Rommel to the plot. However, Nazi party officials in France reported while hospitalized, Rommel extensively and scornfully criticized Nazi incompetence and crimes. Bormann was certain of Rommel's involvement, Goebbels was not. Unfortunately for Rommel, the 'Court of Military Honour' that was to decide whether or not to hand him over to Roland Freisler's People's Court included two men with whom Rommel had crossed swords before, Guderian and von Rundstedt. The Court decided that Rommel should be handed over to the People's Court.<br>  The true extent of Rommel's knowledge of or involvement with the plot is still unclear. After the war, however, his wife maintained that Rommel had been against the plot. It has been stated that Rommel wanted to avoid giving future generations of Germans the perception that the war was lost because of backstabbing, the infamous Dolchsto?legende, as was commonly believed by some Germans of World War I. Not telling his superiors of the plot, however, would have amounted to complicity in the eyes of the Nazi hierarchy, which in turn would have been enough to bring about his execution."|`|TSAl7ZX1aa	Whether he was involved in the plot to assassinate Hitler (20th July plot) or not, he was implicated by conspirators, was politically inconvenient and, as a popular public figure, a minor threat to the Nazi party. He was charged with having knowledge of the plot and failing to pass on the information, even the foregone conclusion of the People's Court would have been an embarrassment to the Nazi hierarchy so the offer of “take the poison and your family suffers no reprisals” was acceptable to both sides.|`|DRNFdhdCaa	hello<br>  <br>  Owing to his close association with the Paris-conspirators(led by General Karl-Heinrich von Stuelpnagel), it was only a matter of time before Rommel was implicated.<br>  <br>   Two different stories describe how this happened. <br>  <br>  According to the first, Luftwaffe Colonel Caesar von Hofacker (Stauffenberg's cousin) divulged Rommel's name under torture. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_von_Hofacker" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_von_...</a><br>  <br>  According to a second story, General von Stuelpnagel, who had tried to commit suicide and had been revived and brought to a German field hospital, was heard crying out Rommel's name repeatedly in delirium<br>  <br>  Almost all account list von Hofacker as the man who implicated rommel, so thats most likely the best option !

First of all, you could try challenging yourself and reading books that are more difficult for you to enhance your vocabluary.  You can also get calenders and books full of stange words, with a new word for each day that you can try to use at least once in a sentance that day.  Finally, there are some awesome websites that will help you enhance and improve your vocabulary.  For example, www.freerice.com is a great one.  You advance levels as you correctly define voacb words, and because the adds on the page refresh with each word (and the money from the adds goes to feeding starving children) the more you play the more rice you have donated to hungry children.  Seriously, check it out, and good luck expanding your vocabulary.  Really, I find this question very admirable.  Few people today can recognize how limited their vocabulary is, and few still strive to take action when they realize that that is the case.  I applaud your quest for knowledge.<br>  ~Clarkie

I really really liked it and read it again.|`|wTkvkWscaa	The Lovely Bones - Alice Sebold<br>  White Oleander - Janet Fitch.<br>  <br>  They are both YAish...but both have pretty mature themes.|`|GexgmXMJaa	i love all the books u luved too just dont read harry potter very boring.|`|GLiqeAV6aa	Here's two I would highly reccomend. I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess--Very mature book about a young boy leading a vicious gang and what happens when it all turns on him. It also takes some time to figure out if you are not familiar with the movie or with Nadsat slang. I would suggest finding a copy with the original last chapter in it, as it was edited out of some of the earlier copies. There is a good amount of violence in this book, so do not read it if that would make you uncomfortable. While I am also partial to "girly" books (and this is not one of them), I found this amazing.<br>  <br>  Looking for Alaska by John Green--What might appear as a typical teen book is much more than you might think if you only read a few chapters. As the story progeresses, it manages to be hilarious and heartbreaking, as well as thought-provoking. I couldn't stop thinking about this books for weeks after I read it. The way John wrote it is captivating.|`|1su6bPSLaa	Here is a great book for you<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/English-Grammar-Dummies-Geraldine-Woods/dp/0764553224/ref=pd_bbs_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235595553&sr=8-3" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/English-Grammar-Du...</a>|`|ThKKB4dGaa	The Disappeared.<br>  Its about the most famous 35 disappearences in history that are still left unsolved(:<br>  Really Enjoyable(:|`|5fxEG2obaa	Johnny Tremain, Marley and Me, and A Tree Grows in Brooklyn are all great books.

Also Harry Potter :)|`|ZzdurUuLaa	I think you would like the book TTYL by Lauren Myracle. It's about these three girls that have an IM conversation. It's all in IM  talk, and there is alot of mature content. It is hilarious and very amusing. If you want to read something else, there is also a book I like called The 39 Clues. The Maze Of Bones. It's about a girl and her brother who have a grandmother who has passed away. They go to their grandmother's funeral, and there, they have to face a life changing decision, a fire, and a scary man in a black suit. What will happen? Read the book to find out =D <br>  <br>  Hope you choose one of these!
B1LkXUKvaa	one suggestion : if you want to be a full blown writer, dump the fanfiction, because for REAL writers, fanfiction is never the answer. and from what i read, u have potential. just wait for an inspiration (DO NOT WRITE WITHOUT AN INSPIRATION BECAUSE YOU WILL GET NO WHERE!) and take it from there. u will find it so much easier and satisfying because it is YOUR characters, YOUR world, YOUR ideas. <br>  i know this is a bit harsh, but i hope it helps.|`|p5tZ8PIxaa	I didn't read through all of it because I have to go in a minute.

It doesn't matter if it's a figure drawing, still life or landscape. Do a google search on it and you'll see what I mean. <br>  <br>  Keep up the good work. You can turn out to be a pretty good artist.

pI5jKfmaaa	Highlights<br>  The decline of the Roman Empire was a gradual transformation that cannot be dated precisely. Some stepping stones in the path toward the loss of the western part of the Empire, the weakening of its eastern part, and the progressive estrangement between the two halves, are nevertheless worth remarking:<br>  <br>  3rd century <br>  <br>  The Crisis of the Third Century (234 - 284), a period of political anarchy. <br>  The reign of emperor Diocletian (284 - 305), who attempted substantial political and economic reforms, many of which would remain in force in the following centuries. <br>  <br>  4th century <br>  The reign of Constantine I (306 - 337), who built the new eastern capital of Constantinople, and converted to Christianity, legalizing and even favoring to some extent this religion. All Roman emperors after Constantine, with the exception of Julian, would be Christians. <br>  The first war with the Visigoths (376 - 382), culminating in the Battle of Adrianople (August 9, 378), in which a large Roman army was defeated by the Visigoths, and emperor Valens was killed. The Visigoths, fleeing a migration of the Huns, had been allowed to settle within the borders of the Empire by Valens, but were mistreated by the local Roman administrators, and rebelled. <br>  The reign of Theodosius I (379 - 395), last emperor to reunite under his authority the western and eastern halves of the Empire. Theodosius continued and intensified the policies against paganism of his predecessors, eventually outlawing it, and making Nicaean Christianity the state religion. <br>  <br>  5th century <br>  The Crossing of the Rhine: on December 31, 406 (or 405, according to some historians), a mixed band of Vandals, Suebi and Alans crossed the frozen river Rhine at Moguntiacum (modern Mainz), and began to ravage Gaul. Some moved on to the regions of Hispania and Africa. The Empire would never regain control over most of these lands. <br>  The second war with the Visigoths, led by king Alaric, in which they raided Greece, and then invaded Italy, culminating in the sack of Rome (410). The Visigoths eventually left Italy, and founded the Visigothic Kingdom in southern Gaul and Hispania. <br>  The rise of the Hunnic Empire under Attila and Bleda (434-453), who raided the Balkans, Gaul, and Italy, threatening both Constantinople and Rome. <br>  <br>  The second sack of Rome, by the Vandals (455). <br>  Failed counterstrikes against the Vandals (461 - 468). The western emperor Majorian planned a naval campaign against the Vandals to reconquer northern Africa in 461, but word of the preparations got out to the Vandals, who took the Roman fleet by surprise and destroyed it. A second naval expedition against the Vandals, sent by emperors Leo I and Anthemius, was defeated in 468. <br>  Deposition of the last western emperors, Julius Nepos and Romulus Augustus (475 - 480). Julius Nepos, who had been nominated by the eastern emperor Zeno, was deposed by the rebelled magister militum Orestes, who installed his own son Romulus in the imperial throne. Both Zeno and his rival Basiliscus, in the East, continued to regard Julius Nepos, who fled to Dalmatia, as the legitimate western emperor, and Romulus as an usurper. Shortly after, Odoacer, magister militum appointed by Julius, invaded Italy, defeated Orestes and deposed the child emperor Romulus Augustus on September 4, 476. He then proclaimed himself ruler of Italy and asked the eastern emperor Zeno to become formal emperor of the entire empire, and in so doing legalize Odoacer's own position as imperial viceroy of Italy. Zeno did so, setting aside the claims of Nepos, who was murdered by his own soldiers in 480. <br>  <br>  Foundation of the Ostrogothic Kingdom in Italy (493). Concerned with the success and popularity of Odoacer, Zeno started a campaign against him, at first with words, then by inciting the Ostrogoths to take back Italy from him. They did as much, but then founded an independent kingdom of their own, under the rule of king Theodoric. Italy and the entire West were lost to the Empire.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  For further discussion on the topic also visit the following link :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Declin...</a>|`|oYYcFMDcaa	Lead lined the aquaducts and poisoned the water supply.

Th3bifTWaa	Everything started on my birthday. 5:30 in the morning on March 13th 2008, my life turned upside down. It started as the greatest birthday ever, I mean how many 15 year olds get a car for their birthday. I ended up getting a bunch of stuff that I wanted and it was a great day but the day at school was weird.<br>  <br>  I stopped reading because that paragraph was a bit much. I loved the beginning. [the whole PLEASE DO NOT STOP READING THIS... my name is Eddie.. blah blah] I liked it, really. You wrote well for that part, but the paragraph I copied and pasted above made me stop .<br>  Mainly because.. normally, you don't get a car at 15 cause you don't HAVE a license at 15. <br>  Second.. "my life turned upside down... it was the greatest day ever" clicheeee. ! <br>  This paragraph is a great way to portray your character's personality, and all you're doing is writing stuff that has been used a countless number of times before.<br>  <br>  BE ORIGINIAL, please. <br>  <br>  I'll read the rest if I find time.<br>  And good luck .<br>  <3<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Principle should be princiPAL .<br>  <br>  there IS a difference. :)|`|fb8eDg4Naa	No offense, but you're junk.

The first paragraph turns me off; I don't want to read something where the narrator is abusing me. The sentence structure is poor, as well, and there seems like there isn't any description.<br>  A fifteen year old cannot get a car. Even a sixteen year old can't legally drive their car until a week or so AFTER their birthday, so no teenager is getting a car on their birthday. <br>  "stuff" is a terrible word to use in a novel, even if it is in first person<br>  "kinda" isn't a word, either.<br>  It's all sort of forced together and the paragraphs don't align correctly in terns of their base of  sentences.<br>  <br>  <br>  I feel like I could guess your age, which isn't exactly a good thing.

FFtjlMdeaa	If you haven't had anything published prior, to support your written work, then send them a resume of your general work background.  If your work background is minimal, then perhaps create a resume about what your hobbies and interests are (incl writing) and some other interesting things about yourself.  Remember, you are selling your work, so an emphasis on your subject area of expertise would assist you.  It is not easy to have work published.  J.K. Rowling - the author of the Harry Potter books - was refused by publishers numerous times before she was published.

yvyewZrWaa	I just finished "How Green Was My Valley" by Richard Llewellyn and that was very depressing. On the most basic level, it's about a guy looking back at his childhood among poor Welsh coal miners - how life was good and how it changed. The 1940s movie version captures the sadness, but it loses the book's eloquence. I didn't absolutely *love* all the plot points, but I was nevertheless moved - from the dedication page to the final line.<br>  <br>  "The Mayor of Casterbridge" by Thomas Hardy is another one of those books that really drags your spirits down. I find the ending particularly powerful.

The fight starts off after I believe Samson in the house of Montague bites his thumb at Abram and some other members of the house of Capulet. That is the equivalent of flipping someone off nowadays. The real reason they fight is unknown, as in the feud between the familes is so ancient, no one really knows why they are still carrying it forth today.
3OzlPPfiaa	I know exactly what you mean- for the best flexibility an american strat would be great for both, I presume you have an acoustic, so i would go for an electric which sounds great acoustic or on a pregain of somesort. In relation with you question this annoying cliched word is going to be mentioned:- its all a matter of OPINION lol. I hate that phrase too, thats all i hear to my questions....<br>  But it all depends on your audience, as playing pink, green day is going to be hated but a vast majority of older people. As im 16 I would generally say the loud-type songs, but i love playing country also (Raising Sands is a brilliant Country album). So really it depends on the people, place and mood. You can NEVER please everyone, that is impossible in the music industry or in general even.

And "acoustic" isn't synonymous with "country", BTW.  There are plenty of electric guitars in country music, and lots of different styles of music that sound amazing on acoustic guitar -- not just country, but folk, folk-rock, acoustic "unplugged" versions of rock songs, bluegrass, jazz, blues.....the list goes on. <br>  <br>  Go with the acoustic when you play at family gatherings and such, unless you know you're going to be jamming with a full rock band.|`|wGEYqauWaa	>>Would you rather listen to songs like that (Rock, Pop, Hip-Hop) or would you rather listen to more country songs?<<<br>  <br>  I'm sure you're aware that there are other genres of music.  I happen to prefer folk music but I listen to bluegrass as well and I enjoy slack-key guitar music, so I prefer acoustic music.

Just sit down, daydream about the possibilities, research the setting, detail your characters, maybe look in some picture books to inspire you, listen to thriller music, etc. Write an outline or maybe just write a section of the story that you already know to jump start your mind. It may take a bit to come up with a plot, but it will be your plot. In the end, you will come out as a better writer.

The family home is a beautiful old house harbouring its own resident unsettled spirit, which has set up residence in Susannah's bedroom.

Stephanie Meyer explained in an interview that us vampires are not attracted to "dead blood", only the "alive blood" that runs through your veins. I am rather shocked, mortal, that you question my brothers ability to handle such a situation!<br>  <br>  <br>  The Interview...<br>  Q: Now here’s a question that came to mind while discussing the book with another friend. She’s a vampire romance novel -aholic and she wondered why Bella didn’t just prick her finger and let Edward drink from her every now and then. Personally, I thought that was a bit sadistic - like she would tease him with it. (I’m picturing Bella with a cut finger, waving it back and forth in front of Edward teasingly saying, "Come and get it!") Especially since we know how difficult it was for him to stop drinking from her the one time he had to. But still, what would happen, do you suppose, if Bella had a cut on her finger? Natural instinct is to put the cut to your mouth - at least it is for me. Edward tasted her tears in one scene. Would he be tempted to taste from a wound? <br>  <br>  A: Edward can’t be around Bella when she’s bleeding without being in intense temptation–to the point of pain. A few drops would only make it worse. Like a few drops of water when you’ve been wandering in the desert for days… You’d totally suck down the whole gallon of Evian.<br>  Several girls wanted to know if Edward would have a more difficult time being around Bella when she’s having her period. Answer: Yes, a little bit, but he would never say anything about it–much too much of a gentleman. And Bella would be way to embarrassed to ask. (It’s not the same as a cut, though. It’s sort of "dead" blood, if you get my meaning).|`|lVaC4Ga4aa	"This has been addressed by Stephenie Meyer. She states that this is "dead blood" and isn't as potent to Edward, though it is a bit uncomfortable for him.

Although the book is theologically incorrect, it does have a great deal of European art history in it.  <br>  <br>  Google Early Modern Europe for more info.|`|sROAVXwXaa	It's not history at all, it was a completely fictional story.  The Knights Templar were not the fore bearers of the Freemasons, DaVinci did not encode anything into his paintings, there has never been any vast cover up by the church about Jesus and his supposed "bloodline".  I'm not saying people can't find the story entertaining but don't think that it's historically accurate, it's like Star Wars or Harry Potter, just look at it as pure entertainment with no historic content.|`|FOfX9E0Laa	yes it was very interesting! I loved the book and learned a lot from it.<br>  I guess it tells the reader a lot about church history, especially about Jesus and his family and "bloodline". A lot about ancient secret circles as well, which bases on a real background. <br>  In my view, the fascinating thing is that Dan Brown mixes real facts with fiction and fictional characters.

I0TOw1KSaa	You need to see how much time you have first.  Figure them a half an hour to play and at least 10 minutes to change between bands.  So, that's a new band every 40 minutes, or three bands in two hours.  Shorten it to 20 minutes a band, 10 between, and that's four bands in two hours.  <br>  <br>  So, how long can you get?  That will tell you how many bands you should get.  I don't think you can do more than 6 or 7 at a time.  6 bands in 3 hours.  How many bands can there be at your school?<br>  <br>  Categories:  none.  There is one kind of band, and either you're good or you're not.  <br>  <br>  You could have the audience choose the winner, but usually there are judges at this kind of thing.  How could you have the audience choose?  By loudness?  What if there's a tie?  There could be drama and controversy.  But there will probably be drama and controversy with judges, too.  It's high school, after all.  Have fun with it.<br>  <br>  Prizes:  Every band appreciates pizza, even professional, touring rock groups.  Gift certificates to the local guitar store.  Maybe they can compete for the chance to play a bigger show?

In most cases, in Western countries, only the married party is said to have committed adultery, and if both parties are married (but not to each other) then they both commit separate acts of adultery. In other countries, both parties to the adultery are considered guilty, while in others again only the woman is able to commit adultery and to be considered guilty.|`|J9JDfsNgaa	I personally think that adultery only occurs if you and your husband/wife live together , sleep together , etc.<br>  If however you are separated then how is it adultery?

It states that "two shall become one flesh", thus the physical joining reflects the lives of two that are joined through marriage.  In order for the marriage to remain valid (not adulterated), no other is to come between the couple.|`|N0UUmjDlaa	Adultery is one of those "crimes" dreamed up by religion.<br>  "Thou shall not covet thy neighbour's wife", is how this Commandment went?<br>  Why did the Church introduce marriage and fidelity? <br>  Prior to being "taken on" by the church, marriages were a legal documentation process to sort out inheritance. These documents decided which offspring of man should inherit the wealth/ land, whatever was on offer.<br>  Any particular male may have fathered many other children, but only the (probably eldest male) child born of 1 particular union was able to inherit.<br>  Your lady friend could divorce her husband, if her upbringing/ religion will allow of it.

I personally do not view going out on dates and spending time with a married person as adultery if there is no sexual contact.  I have many male friends who are married or separated and I'm able to have purely nonsexual relationships with them, but the wives may think very differently.  Some religious persons view looking upon another person with lust as adultery.  Some believe you can have an affair of the heart and it's dealt with as if it's adultery...example, having a chat buddy who you never meet but have cyber sex or intimate chat with.<br>  People who have an open marriage or are swingers have no moral issues with adultry as long as certain rules are in place and are not broken, so it's not a question of being legal or moral.  <br>  The question should be, why aren't people in relationships like marriage communicating well enough that one partner would feel the need to go outside of the marriage to get his or her needs met?...and these needs are very rarely sexual.|`|hHGNE0IRaa	Adultery I think is when you don't take your partner's feelings in consideration.

162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	I have been doing photography (both paid and unpaid!) on the side for about 30 years.  My "real" job for over 20 years was in the health care industry, in the OR, ER, and LTC.  Then I started working in a photo lab and have been doing that for 13.  Through the years I have always kept fairly busy shooting weddings, families and events as a sideline.  I also have sold quite a few prints, but I do not have a studio or do stock.  I do not maintain a website either, all my work comes to me via  WOM.   How much I work varies.  Some years I shoot 3 or 4 weddings and several other things, maternity, seniors, pets local events, etc.    But in 2007 I shot 20 weddings.  That was busy for me, really TOO busy, weddings take up your weekends!  Last year I didn't have that many, this year so far only 2 are booked.      How busy you can be really depends on your day job.  I am fortunate to have lab staff who are willing to cover for me on wedding Saturdays.  Also weddings are usually booked far in advance so there is plenty of time to redo the work schedule.  If you don't shoot weddings, portraits are much easier to schedule.    This is a hard time to be going into photography as a mainline job.   There are lots of new "professional" photographers. many of them also doing it on the side as a weekend warrior.  The onslaught of new pros can mostly be linked to the affordability of dSLR's, and the prevailing attitude that what ain't right can be "fixed" in Photoshop.  After all, the camera does all the thinking, and if one has a good camera they will automatically get professional photos.    Of course, that is not true for everyone just starting out!  Some are actually talented and skilled and produce nice work, amateur or pro.  A few have the business sense, people skills,  and have done their homework and will do well.  Others won't make it, either because of poor skills and product. lack of people handling skill, or poor business savvy.  Some. like myself, prefer to work where there are benefits like insurance, 401k, and a steady paycheck.  I still consider myself to be an amateur, as I do not make most of my income from photography.  There is a category called "semi-pro", whatever that means.   Perhaps the weekend warriors might fit better there.  Your work should stand on its own merit, and not whether you do it full time or not.  Good work is good work, even if you only shoot evenings and weekends.    So you can certainly do paid photography alongside your day job.  I would suggest claiming the income, you don't want to be in trouble with the IRS.  Whether you can do it and claim business expenses probably varies from state to state.  I'd ask an accountant or tax lawyer what you need to do to stay legal.    I think in these times it is a great thing to have a steady job with dependable pay and especially insurance.  Particularly if there is something that you will enjoy doing.  I made that decision over 30 years ago, choosing nursing over art.   You can still enjoy your photography on the side, and perhaps make some serious money as well.  If you suddenly discover that the photography is paying the bills, you could always rethink which is your "real" job!  Best wishes!|`|jIccV2sOaa	I think you should also love language and common sense.   How can anyone be a professional anything "on the side".  If someone is a professional "XXX" then "xxx" is their main occupation. Chicken plucking, banjo playing or even hog rustlin' is done "on the side".|`|VBCPdcetaa	I have been a pro photographer for 10 years it was my main occupation for three but due to unsteady income, health insurance needs etc. I took work in my other field. I schedule portrait session usually during the week at night or on weekends. Weekends i usually leave for artistic shoots work that I want to produce, sometimes I sell them for stock images. If a print is really good I will try to sell the prints online.

FGxBGBtHaa	Well, we learned this stretch in ballet, but it's a little hard to explain...so bear with me.  Do your splits for five minutes first.   Kay, so you lay down on your back and hug one of your legs to your chest...bent. hold it for about 15-30 seconds, then put your arm under your knee, and pull it closer. hold this for about 15-30 seconds. Then, straighten your leg, while holding it as close to your chest as possible! Hold it there for 15-30 seconds. This is the part that matters most so i'll try to explain clearly...Kay, While keeping your leg straight, hold right underneath your knee, (so on your calf) then pulling your leg towards you as hard as you can with your arms, your gonna push away from your arms and try to get your leg down. the resistance in the exercise, helps to stretch out your splits and make your muscles more flexible. Within a week and a half After I began this stretch, i had my splits all the way down, comfortably. Do it with the other leg too...(Ofcourse...) Directly after you finish that side, do your splits for five minutes. Then switch to the other side. So your order should be:  Splits, resistance, splits, switch sides  Splits resistance splits, DoNe!   I hope you get your splits down soon! Good luck!  -Terr|`|FfknHjEPaa	well there is no really easy way...but I'll tell you what i do, I'm a synchronized swimmer...

Then put your legs together and point your toes and reach for them, then flex your toes and do the same . .    Try your splits after about 20 min of stretching .. then continue to do this every few days/daily .. it will take a few weeks+, but give it time!    good luck!|`|sXeyRD9taa	There is no easier way than stretching.|`|SL16D0YEaa	when doing a split you have to be careful not to pull anything.     in regards to stretching you should start by sitting on the and just stretching your legs.     sit with your legs apart and stretch both sides by going down on each leg then going down the center of your legs.    kicking can also keep you stretched out.     kick to the right to the side and to the front  then kick to the left to the side then to the front.    if you just want to do a split then go down on 1 knee as if your proposing to someone and push your front leg out and let your back leg follow. don't try to push your self further that you can naturally go. or you can start standing up and go down but i find it easier to start on 1 knee it also keeps my back leg strait      if you want to stretch your split even further you can get some one you trust to slightly push down on your shoulders when your in your split.|`|VhGAmioXaa	all you have to do is at least every other day do some form of cardio that will get you warmed up before you proceed to stretch because you can stretch a lot better when your muscles are warm.    and when you stretch go as far as you can hold it for 30  seconds then do it again , you will notice the second time around you went a little further but it wont be much. but it certainly adds up     and try not to  over stretch which  can lead to your thighs being sore and you wont be able to stretch for the next few days     hope this helps :D|`|zuVENJd3aa	the only way is to strech everyday  if you are sore the next day, that is normal.. you still have to stretch if you are sore.  it only should take one to three months to be able to do the splits depending on how flexible you are already..   stretch when your watching tv! :]

dBgpancRaa	It depends on what you're looking for, really.  There are surely all sorts of photo studios in your area that do wedding photos/graduation photos, et cetera.  Those usually do modeling photography as well.  They can be on the expensive side, though.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would network on Facebook or Myspace and see if there are any independent photographers willing to photograph you for free, as long as they are allowed to keep photos for their own portfolio.  You'll probably also have a bit more freedom in a shoot with someone like that and you will be able to try more of your own ideas.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You don't need a whole portfolio if you have never done professional modeling. Agencies probably won't even look at it. You really just need 1-2 good clear headshots and 1-2 full body shots. Agencies are looking for potential, not perfection, so these don't even have to be professional as long as they are clear and in good lighting against a white background.|`|Nk6NS5Lxaa	You really don't need a portfolio to submit to agencies.

bda465ikaa	The use of photographic film was pioneered by George Eastman, who started manufacturing paper film in 1885 before switching to celluloid in 1889. His first camera, which he called the "Kodak," was first offered for sale in 1888. It was a very simple box camera with a fixed-focus lens and single shutter speed, which along with its relatively low price appealed to the average consumer. The Kodak came pre-loaded with enough film for 100 exposures and needed to be sent back to the factory for processing and reloading when the roll was finished. By the end of the 19th century Eastman had expanded his lineup to several models including both box and folding cameras.<br>  ---------------<br>  The first mass-marketed camera was introduced in February of 1900, and called "The Brownie", the price was $1. By April 1904 for $5 you could buy a camera that wasn't as boxy and as cumbersome to carry around. As late as 1939 they were selling cameras for as low as $1.25 <br>  =================<br>  However, families probably went to studios as early as the 1840's. <br>  Louis Jacques Daguerre and Joseph Nicéphore Niépce  invented the first practical photographic method, which was named the daguerreotype, in 1836. Daguerre coated a copper plate with silver, then treated it with iodine vapour to make it sensitive to light. The image was developed by mercury vapor and fixed with a strong solution of ordinary salt. William Fox Talbot perfected a different process, the calotype, in 1840. Both used cameras that were little different from Zahn's model, with a sensitized plate or sheet of paper placed in front of the viewing screen to record the image. Focusing was generally via sliding boxes.|`|AA12343309	My father was born in 1907 and we have a family photo of him when he was about 6 months old.<br>  <br>  I have a family photo of one of my grandfather's sister's family .

dBgpancRaa	I *think* you're referring to the fisheye lense effect.  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=fisheye%20lense&cts=1235602045345&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...</a><br>  <br>  You can get that look in Photoshop by selecting the liquify filter.  Select the "blow up" tool and select a brush size a little bit larger than your picture.  Use this to warp the picture just a little to give it the "fisheye" effect.|`|ehDQai3Maa	You could also try using the Spherize filter which which is one of the distort filters.<br>  <br>  I'd start by making the canvas size bigger and then after you distort it crop the edges. The picture your talking about was probably taken with a wide angle lens and that's why it looks the way it does so it's something you can't exactly duplicate in Photoshop afterwards but you might be able to do something similar.

f1aac05e2cf2f28dae8cc17db6309e92aa	Many things can help:    1. make notes-       try writing or typing up a list of the moves you do in a way that you can understand. Usually putting the part with the lyrics helps.    2. Set it up to an 8- count-       jump 2, 3, 4, turn, 6, 7, pause... or whatever. lol.    3.

My teacher always tells me to write it down, and I know a good few dancers who do that. Use some kind of key word for each step to remind yourself, so you can look at your notes if you forget.   I find it usually works best to practice over and over. Just keep going through it until you've got the moves down. Get comfortable with the steps, and muscle memory will take it from there.
