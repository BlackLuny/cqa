bLahP9Ivaa	Well Iceland is in a finanial crises, but has not declaired bankruptsy. The problems are rooted in the absolute oposite of socialism, that is capitalism.<br>  Icelands 3 commercial banks grew 11 times bigger than the Central bank (the equivilent of the federal reserve) but when Lehman brothers went belly up and one of the banks had a lot of stocks in that it crashed too and dragged the other two with it, as they had borrowed from each other (a common practice in the world of banking).<br>  So absolutely nothing to do with socialism.|`|AA11702773	The central bank and overspending (socialism possibly) were greatly related to it, much as is occuring here.<br>  <br>  Google 'Iceland unrest'.|`|NxPPdCSjaa	Here is the link!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2008/10/iceland_goes_ba.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/e...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Iceland has no Economic base of it own!

eLUUA4ljaa	yeah but the only thing u should be scared of is if you make a loud noise opening the door, and you walk in, he might panick, run around the desk yelling and throwing pencils at you "viet kongs! -viet kongs!" but he made a mistake cuz vietnamese was also on his side too then hed pick up a banana and started to talk into the fruit saying "i need reinforcements, cover me im getting the h.., outa here<br>  <br>  but for real 80? good choice, he wont attack you if he hates you, he just might have a heart attack<br>  <br>  but uncle steve dint hate asians did he? and he served in korean war|`|9rhmeb7raa	Don't listen to your teacher about Vietnam vets being violent. He has been spending too much time listening to the drivel peddled by his professors in university and the rumors heard from people who don't know the first thing they are talking about. <br>  Go and interview that 80-year old man and thank him for serving his nation. Then do some research on the three Indochinese Refugee Resettlement Camps we operated in 1975 at Camp Pendleton, Fort Chafee and an Air Base in Florida. Most of the military personnel who assisted those Vietnamese into starting new lives in America were Vietnam veterans!|`|N4u9DRvFaa	I can tell you of all that I have met, and that is a lot, you have nothing to worry about. <br>  <br>  I do know that the Vietnamese here old enough to have lived through the war do not hate us. At least the 17 I know. Helen (Day) has my Basic training photo in the kitchen at her office. they are all Vietnamese. her brother in law is a part owner and was a Major, ARVN, 1955-1975 in Trah Vihn area.<br>  <br>  It sound to me as if your teacher has an agenda to push....one of Bravo Sierra.<br>  <br>  I don't know how to spell it but I hear "comb whaa" from Helen when i say stupid stuff. That would be appropriate for your teachers comment about getting violent. An 80 YO Viet Nam Vet must have been career Army from the Korean War or a bit earlier. He would have been a Senior NCO or Officer.<br>  <br>  SSG US Army 73-82|`|NQYKzv7faa	He wont say anything bad about you personally.  Youre an American, anyway.<br>  <br>  That is not a country I would go back to for a vacation.  I avoid south asians in business dealings.  Those feelings would not affect my treatment of anyone I meet.|`|9VQfNXj4aa	Some vets do, but if your interview subject has an ounce of reason he won't hate you because of a war that happened long before you were born and had nothing to do with you.|`|anSjrbAEaa	I am A Vietnam veteran. I didn't love the people I fought for and I didn't hate the people I fought against. Your teacher is A fool.|`|5pioWG30aa	I would say in general the answer is no.|`|MOYZCFKyaa	Oh he will|`|or9l2tkVaa	Being a VietNam vet, I would guess that if any of us were to be inclined to get violent with anyone in this situation, it would be your teacher who would be in trouble.  The reality is that despite the military's efforts to denigrate and dehumanize the Vietnamese people before sending us off to war, most of the guys I knew came to have a great deal of respect for the people of VietNam.  I have a neighbor who is Vietnamese, my daughters go to school and play tennis with Vietnamese kids, and I've become friends with their parents, and I would guess that most veterans have had similar positive experiences.  And remember, like fine wine and good cheese, most of us mellow with age, and most VietNam vets have about forty years of mellowing behind us.  Be respectful of this guy, and I'll bet you get that same respect returned.  And if he's over 80 years old, I can't imagine he can do a lot of damage if he does get violent.|`|dVQdswtTaa	The idea that a Vietnam war vet will turn violent is a load of Hollywood garbage. <br>  <br>  'Nam vets are no more likely to be violent than any other vet and have really gotten a bad reputation with Rambo movies and some of the crazies pretending to be vets. <br>  <br>  Prepare your questions ahead of time, and ask intelligent questions about his experiences and opinions of the war. Don't ask, "How many people have you killed?" That one just irritates all of us vets.<br>  <br>  Remember that the whole "support the troops" idea didn't exist in the sixties. People treated the Soldiers who went and fought as if the war was their idea, and accused them of being "baby killers" and other wild things. <br>  <br>  The fact that you are of Viet descent may even bring back some memories for him. Not all vets bear a grudge against the people where they fought, and remember that the Vietnamese people were on both sides of the conflict. <br>  <br>  If he does have difficulty with your ethnic background, remember that he may have gone through a difficult time during the war and may find it hard to let go of some feelings. War is hard on those involved, there are still WW2 vets who have trouble with Japanese or German people. <br>  <br>  BTW, if he is over 80, chances are he is a vet of multiple wars, since most 'Nam vets are around 60 years old. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you are able to learn history from somebody who lived it.|`|7PGxqRfZaa	I think your teacher is an asshole who does not deserve to have been in the same room as a real vet that served his country when they asked him to, let alone gotten to talk to him. Most vietnam vets are just like anyone else. He might say some things that might make you upset, but I don't think he will hate you because your of vietnam Origen. Talk to him and I will bet you will like him. The first thing you should remember is not to ask him if he has killed anyone, most vets, to include myself don't like that question and it brings back bad memories of times we try our hole lives to forget. He might not even talk to you at all. Talk to your local Veterans hospital and see if anyone is willing to talk about there experiences from the Vietnam era. Good luck. And tread very carefully done this path with him. this is not a game your playing with this man, your going back in time with him to a very hard time in his life. Its in no way a joke or should be taken as one for any reason.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	Don't fall for stereotypes.  It is true that some veterans might have a resentment of the locals in a country they fought in (even a few OIF vets have a problem with some Arabs today) but most can get past that.  You wasn't even alive when the Vietnam War took place and while some might have a problem with Vietnamese people others are more forgiving.  Some even came home from Vietnam married to someone they met in the war.|`|VXQFT341aa	I had a great uncle who fought in the South Pacific in WW2. He hated everything Asian. He went though to much **** that it really effected him. It didn't matter if you were Japanese. Chinese. Korean, or Vietnamese. I'm not trying to be mean but if he don't know that you are Vietnamese someone should make sure its okay with him. People have different experiences in combat so you don't know what he went thru.|`|jWcVcXZQaa	I would not worry about it|`|3iL7V04waa	You really shouldn't be worried.  He's probably not going to hate you just because of your race.  You weren't even alive during the war (I'm assuming) so it doesn't matter. <br>  If he's agreed to meet with you, he obviously doesn't have any objection to your race.<br>  <br>  ADD:  You can go tell your teacher to shove it up her you-know-what for saying that about the Vietnam veterans.  They deserve more respect than that.<br>  When you go to interview him, thank him greatly for his service and devotion to his country and go kick your teacher's ***.

nx7QtF0paa	You don't have Sundays off, you have square away time for about 4 hours in the AM while Church services are held if you chose not to attend. Depending on your platoon and how much you've screwed up that week and you will, will depend on how you spend that time. I suggest you catch up on hygiene, letter writing and squaring away your footlocker which will be dumped the minute you are done. Then you have your regular training schedule for the rest of the day.<br>  <br>  You aren't deprived of food, but chow time is not a social event where you relax and conversate.  Eat now, taste later. You don't sleep in and lounge around, you have a full training schedule for 13 1/2 weeks. Don't expect a full 8 hours sleep.<br>  <br>  Because of the intense physical activity you are tired a lot, but your body will adjust.  <br>  <br>  As far as what to expect... I could never give boot camp the justice it deserves with mere words.... it's better then you find out for yourself once you hit those yellow footprints :)|`|JDxpjT34aa	Sunday is not techincally considered a training day but that does not mean that you have the day "off". You'll have about 4 hours of "free time" in the squad bay to write letters, shower, etc. or you can go to church. You do not have the whole day off. First phase you'll go throug a lot of classes and learn to drill. Second phase is the rifle range. Third phase is all the good stuff like final drill, PFT, crucible, etc. You don't need to take anything to boot camp other than what you are wearing. You will not be deprived of food, you will go to chow three times a day. As far as sleep is concerned, you can expect to be tired.|`|ysQHKT6haa	On Sunday, you will have about an hour of free time.  You will be allowed to go to church or write letters.  Most of us went to church just to get away for an hour.  Other than that, training continues as normal.  Take as little as possible with you.  You will be issued everything you will need.  They do not deprive you of food and sleep.  You may be hungry and you may be tired, but you will not be deprived. My only advice is to keep your head up and your mouth shut and do everything to the best of your ability.  If they single you out as a slacker, half of your time will be spent on the quarterdeck or in the pit.  Good luck and try to remember that many others have been through it and survived and you will too.|`|lD0VcAlpaa	First off, capitalize Marine and it's schedule. Sorry, but you'll learn once you get there that is unacceptable. You have Sunday optional church services, a little personal time to clean up/write letters/etc, it's not really a day "off." Every PLT is different, and it depends if your West or East coast. Take the clothes on your back and a cheap pair of shoes, and your wallet. You'll get them back at the end of the 3 months--most likely they won't fit anymore. They do not deprive you of food, if you're overweight you'll be put on a diet, if you're underweight they'll give you double rations, otherwise you'll eat normal. As for sleep deprivation, you'll survive it if you're Marine material. If you want to know what's in store--you'll hate it more and more each day until graduation. However, once you graduate you'll look back and realize how beneficial it was and it will probably be the best time you've had in your life.|`|MOYZCFKyaa	They deprive you of sleep, that's for sure<br>  Not food, they need you to stay alive and have energy.<br>  The Crucible though, you get deprived of both.<br>  They don't want to destroy, they want to make you a Marine.<br>  So they aren't trying to make you die.<br>  They know your limitations better than you.<br>  Sundays, you get to go to mass.

UAW6fd4baa	Complain to the state bar and include a record of what you paid him. Most but not all lawyers are out for a easy buck and will leave you in a worse situation than what were in before you retained them.|`|c07v7O80aa	You should be able to get a statement detailing the charges, but there's no assurance an attorney will get you the outcome you want, no matter how much you pay.|`|AA12205273	That was 10 years ago.

Good luck|`|4a1d38237c01a4eab17250152165accfaa	it has been a long time, but you can always try complaining to the state bar :)|`|AA11043457	Didn't the lawyer give  you bills showing hours logged on the case and the expenses and also court costs?  If he didn't, then you need to see a prosecutor about placing charges against him.<br>  <br>  However, you also need to realize that every phone call you made to his office was probably at least 15 minutes and every paper he prepared for court took time to prepare, every meeting he had with you was logged at how many minutes or hours it was and you are charged for all of those at his hourly rate which could be $200-250 or more per hour.  Time in court is usually more, like $500 per hour.  There are also court costs.  The attorney should not be just saying, "You are out of money."  But he has an obligation to put that money in an escrow account until the money is earned by him and he should have given  you regular statements showing the amounts he earned by different actions.  It is not just 5 times in court for 10 minutes but there is a lot of preparation time that goes toward that 10 minutes.  Every time you meet with him you take his time. Every time he takes a phone call or makes one on  your behalf or writes a letter or prepares a document there is a cost to that.<br>  <br>  I don't know if he earned that money or not.  I am not sure what you mean by doing an open adoption - if you mean that  you let your children be adopted, I'm just not sure why.  I also don't know why your children were taken and why  you needed parenting classes.  <br>  <br>  If this was caused by child abuse, then the attorney might have worked to defend you on those charges and if so, those fees would be racked up as well.<br>  <br>  You can also go to the State Bar Association and file a claim against the attorney if you are sure there was some wrong action.  And if you never received documents from him/her showing the dates and minutes and  hours for the various events and amounts for court dates, etc. then there may be inappropriate action.  Attorneys are expensive.  They charge about $250 per hour for their services and some more and if the secretary or a legal aide works on the case, then that time is charged at a lesser figure.  I think you will find that you have that information and that you just had no idea of all the things the attorney had to do for those 5 court dates.  It isn't just the time they spend in court.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.
N4u9DRvFaa	It can have BIG effect on ever getting in by withdrawing now. They see it as a decision making defincency. <br>  <br>  Before you go and drop out why not get the problem fixed with the recruiter and enlist. Going to see his commander may be the trick to get that done. Make sure you have your ducks in a row. This can stop you from getting in later.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	What did he lie to you about?  Are you sure you just didn't misunderstand him?  A lot of prospects and applicants suffer from "selective hearing" and mistake what they heard as a lie whenever it doesn't go according to plan.  For example, he could say you can get a $40,000 bonus IF YOU QUALIFY AND ENLIST IN A DESIGNATED SKILL.  However, you tune out the part about qualification and say you was lied to when you don't qualify for a job offering the bonus.<br>  <br>  Getting out of the DEP for one service won't stop you from joining another service.  But they might be less likely to want to work with you if they see you as a quitter.  Also, different services have different enlistment standards and you might qualify for the Army but not the Air Force, for example.<br>  <br>  If you want out of the DEP tell him you want out.  But don't be surprised if you have a harder time getting in a different service or if the other services offer you a smaller bonus.

I doubt you will go to "jail" for it, but you did break the law.  Given your age, if any charges were pressed, it would be in juvenile court and therefore would be sealed and would not appear on your adult record.

Walk them until you can go faster. Your key to loosing weight is cardio. If you have cable tv they often have exercise programs on there. Use the couch to hold your feet to try to do sit ups. Also if you can get ahold of a ball (like soccer or basketball) put it behind your back and do sit ups that way. It works more muscles. Crunches may help you get in better shape to do the sit ups. Start by doing "girly" push ups (knees down) and work your way up to regular ones. Walk outside, work to jogging, then to running. You are going to have to push yourself as much as possible. Do push ups and sit ups at EVERY commercial if you are watching tv, or go up and down the stairs during commercials. <br>  <br>  If you cannot afford anything to help you why are you asking about weight loss products. They can get very expensive.<br>  <br>  You have about 30lbs to loose. No soda or sweets as you know. If you have a sweet tooth eat jello.

They might then begin to think for themselves and question their teachers and the media.  This could lead to people voting for political candidates based on the candidates ideas, positions, and past voting record instead of just picking the candidate from the correct political party.  <br>  <br>  In addition people might see that opposing political opinions many times have valid points.  They might realize that labeling ideas or people as "racist" is just a way to silence and censor those ideas and opinions that our teachers, leaders and media have judged to be wrong.

579276f1a955ed5c170f87a86360c3b2aa	First you would need a lawyer willing to take on such a case. Hard to prove because just you and your brothers word wouldnt be good enough since you could just be mad at her for any reason and file a suit against her. You might have doctor documentation from when you were a child stating that you were malnourished. Maybe some of your past teachers, neighbors, family member, etc. who knew about your living conditions back then. <br>  A lawyer could tell you best whether you might have a case, but Im going to guess that your chances are slim to none. There may even be a statute of limitations for such a thing.

There's not an excuse in the world that's gonna save you!  Most vehicle and traffic violations are what is termed "strict liability" laws.  That means there is no elelment of intent associated with the prosecution of such violations.  This basically means the judge isn't going to care for most excuses.  However....it sounds like you didn't give the cop any flack.  Plead not guilty and when your big day comes, throw yourself on the mercy of the cop.  He should be there for the court appearance (if he's not, ask for a dismissal of the charges).  Sometimes they'll let you plead guilty to a lesser, no-point offense.  In any case, bring your wallet!<br>  <br>  This doesn't really have anything to do with your question, but I always thought that the following scenario might work.  A cop is an agent of whatever government he works for (local, county, state, etc.).   Police will often set their radar at whayever speed they happen to be targeting.  As a governmnet agent, it's my contention that the cop is ultimately setting the speed limit.  For instance, if the cop sets his radar at 65MPH in a 55MPH, he's willing to accept any speed up to 64MPH without reacting.  On any given day, the cop may have his radar set for 65MPH, then 63 MPH, then 67 MPH, effectively setting the speed limit on any given day.  The law generally doesn't like vagueness.  My argument would be that the cop sets an arbitrary speed limit on any given day and the average driver has no way of knowing what that speed limit is.  As far as the speed limit being "posted", the cop, as an agent of the gov't., has the ability to override that posted limit.  Don't believe that?  Ever come across a traffic situation wherein the cop is overriding a traffic signal?  Same thing.  I haven't gotten a ticket since 1981 so I haven't had a chance to check this theory out.

Lowers competitiveness among businesses<br>  Reduces quantity demanded of workers. This may manifest itself through a reduction in the number of hours worked by individuals, or through a reduction in the number of jobs.<br>  Reduces profit margins of business owners employing minimum wage workers, thus encouraging a move to businesses that do not employ low-skill workers.<br>  Businesses try to compensate for the decrease in profit by simply raising the prices of the goods being sold thus causing inflation and increasing the costs of goods and services produced.

For example, during the apartheid era in South Africa, white trade unions lobbied for the introduction of minimum wage laws so as to exclude black workers from the labor market.

Although Belarus is close to Russia, and there is a sizeable pro-Russian faction in the Ukraine, few of the other countries would ever be likely to support reunion, much less under a revived Communist Party. The Baltic states in particular have taken a very pro-western stance and see themselves more as kin to Poland, Finland and Sweden than Russia.<br>  <br>  I think the idea of a revived USSR is a figment of the slightly paranoid US imagination than any realistic prospect based on international politics.|`|ao0gR3CYaa	FORGET THE SOVIET UNION.OUR COUNTRY NEEDS TO REUNITE AGAIN.WE ARE PRETTY MUCH SPLIT RIGHT DOWN THE MIDDLE WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUES AT HAND.|`|TnIsuYqYaa	Only if Russia invades them.|`|BYVr1tOGaa	you sound asd though you hope for it....ask your president....he would know|`|8PCriC7Vaa	Forget it.

I think it should be lower.  When I walk in drunk, having wasted all my money at the bar at the club, I need that discount.  It should be dropped to 27 years old.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, for retirement...Older people are doing much better these days.  They are far stronger than older people used to be, far more mentally active, etc.  They are also far wiser than many of their younger counterparts.  They are a resource that we need to tap.  Instead we force them out of the work force, when there is still plenty left in many of them.<br>  <br>  I don't know for certain, because there aren't that many older people I've talked to about this, but I would think they would still like to feel useful in the capacity of working.  We could certainly use their knowledge and work ethic.  So I think we should either raise the age of retirement higher, or at least not force older people to leave when they hit 65 regardless of their want to work.|`|i0WQzVDZaa	Ah little bit more in site to you question would be nice.

Israel is the only place within a huge rectangle between maybe Croatia, South Africa, Australia and Japan that has any human rights whatsoever for the GLBT population.

The term republic can also refer to the state or country that uses the Republican system. The word originates from the Latin term res publica.<br>  <br>  I think you need to know the definition of democracy. <br>  <br>  Here's a brief history about democracy:<br>  <br>  Democracy is a form of government in which power is held directly or indirectly by citizens under a free electoral system. in the middle of the 5th-4th century BC to denote the political systems then existing in some Greek city-states, notably Athens following a popular uprising in 508 BC.<br>  some have argued that voters may not be well educated enough to exercise their democratic right. A population with low intellect may not be capable of making correct decisions.<br>  Some voters are highly uninformed about many political issues, especially relating to economics, and have a strong bias about the few issues on which they are fairly knowledgeable. For example, members of labor unions are most passionate and informed about labor policies. They will organize themselves and lobby the government to adopt policies beneficial to labor unions but not necessarily to the rest of the population. As a result, politicians are unaware of voters' actual desires. In conclusion, some voters may not be well educated enough to exercise their democratic right. A population with low intellect may not be capable of making correct decisions.|`|vea6mqPZaa	Our Country is a Democratic Republic with a Democratic controlled House, Senate, and Executive Branch.

Constitutionally, he can't: funding is the purview of Congress. Realistically, bonuses are part of the service budget-the service chiefs decide what, if any, bonuses are to be offered.  Currently, there's no problem with retention, or getting new recruits.  If any bonuses are cut/stopped, that would be the reason.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	Reenlistment bonuses are set by each service, not the President.  Each service makes bonuses based on their budgets and requirements for reenlistment.  Although Obama won't directly stop bonuses, a defense budget cut could indirectly affect them.  Also, with the economy in its current position more and more troops see that there isn't much to look forward to on the outside, making troops more likely to reenlist and making less reasons for the military to offer bonuses right now.<br>  <br>  But as of right now the bonuses are still there.

vFqUi1CBaa	I am a member of USWA Local 1190. That's United Steelworkers. To start off with there are a lot of other things the union does besides those that you've mentioned. A huge benefit to being in a union shop is worker safety. UNions have people who make sure that safety is a major concern when it comes to writing new contracts. Unions have the power of OSHA and MSHA backing them up so many safety items are almost automatic. But some things need to be haggled over during negotiations. <br>   Other items that unions have helped in is seniority, vacations, pensions etc.  A real important one nowadays is where the union demands a position on the Board so that they can offer ground up advice from the people who actually do the work.<br>   You asked whether your union membership would mean anything at a non-union shop. Sorry, but no. There are companies out there who are not held to any binding agreements and your former union affiliation would mean nothing at the new shop. Sorry.<br>   Can your previous union membership keep you from getting a job? No. That would be against the law. No one is allowed to hold your membership against you. <br>   What are my general thoughts on unions? I think that they are much needed. They provide job security and job quality. The insure that all safety factors are in place and they also act on your behalf when you are mistreated.<br>   There are many, many, many facets to belonging to a union and I just think that the unions have helped this country immensley.|`|lJGnuMbbaa	prior union membership should not have an effect on a new job i had a job at a none union warehouse and some of the other drivers wanted to start a union. when the warehouse found out they canceled our contract as in was stipulated no unions. have worked in two unions and they did nothing for me. as for unions if you could read the by-laws you would never join. that is why you can not see the by-laws and if you ask to it is grounds for dismissal|`|77065613f37e389ce84c3ccdb115f32baa	I'm against Unions; they just take your money.

It should also be no hindrance. My opinions on Unions are that they raised the way of life of this nation. They gave us the 5 day week vacations overtime. Not to mention health Insurance. If you trust corporations then Unions have served their purpose and are not needed. Good luck with that

And you'd see that if you paid attention.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Listen to Nancy Pelosi.  When this thing first started, she kept saying "I didn't want to cut this out, or that out, but we did because we are trying for bipartisanship."  She continually pointed out that she didn't want parts of it cut out.  Why?<br>  <br>  Well, that is because she believes that the American people gave Democrats a mandate to do what they want.  In reality, we gave them a mandate to be bipartisan, but Nancy Pelosi does not realize that.  She believes that the American people wanted all that spending, so she is trying to separate her image from the cuts going down so that we don't blame her for them.  <br>  <br>  <br>  So it's obvious Nancy Pelosi was not on board with the cuts, but you probably already know that.  Yet the cuts went down.  Democrats in the House usually back Pelosi as a sign of solidarity, yet they went against her this time.  Why?<br>  <br>  It's not because the Republicans made them do it.  EVERY SINGLE REPUBLICAN voted against this bill, plus 11 Democrats, and it still passed quite easily.  It could have lost even more votes and still pass.  Republicans don't have power because they don't have the numbers to influence anything.  They have no say unless Democrats LET them have a say.  So if Democrats moved against Pelosi, it was not because of the Republicans.<br>  <br>  Which means that Republicans had a Democrat ally backing them.  Now who among Democrats is strong enough to move against Pelosi, convince other Democrats to move against Pelosi, and win?  There is only one Democrat who fits that bill, and it is Barack Obama.<br>  <br>  Barack Obama was the Republican ally who was backing them on the cuts to the bill.  He was the only one strong enough to do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  So why did the House Republicans attack him?  If he was on their side, why did they so openly move against him?  <br>  <br>  For the answer to that, I go to last year's bailout bill (the Bush one).  Remember how the bill began as a $700 billion bailout plan.  House Republicans voted against it nearly en masse, and were hailed as Conservative heroes.<br>  <br>  So the authors of the bill go back, ADD on $150 billion to the bill to make it $850 billion now, and guess who voted for it nearly en masse?  That's right, House Republicans.  They weren't fighting for fiscal Conservatism, they were fighting to get their own spending added on.  They aren't Conservatives.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  They are mad at Obama now, not because of the spending, but because he wouldn't let them join in on the spending fun.  He backed them every time they wanted to cut things out of the bill.  EVERY time.  But when they wanted to ADD amendments to the bill, Obama blocked them.  That is why they are mad; Obama would not let them add spending as Bush did in the bailout of last year.<br>  <br>  Obama was bipartisan.  Nancy Pelosi was not, but she was relegated to an irrelevant position on this.  House Republicans were the ones who were not being bipartisan, and in fact were not even sticking to their own principles.<br>  <br>  <br>  Then the Senate Republicans saw how the House Republicans had fooled most of you guys on the Republican side, and so they decided to get in on the foolin' as well.  They acknowledged that Obama worked with them, but still said they would not work with Obama.  They did that because they saw they could not lose.  House Republicans had seriously misrepresented the situation and fooled nearly the whole lot of you, and the Senate Republicans rode that gravy train all the way to crazy town.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Obama was the ONLY Conservative in this whole mess.  And who demonized him, as they usually do with actual Conservatives?  Republicans.|`|wz9szz3Gaa	He refused all suggestions and that was cut taxes and he decided on spending and he can't be stopped.

What a lot of people saw on the front side is coming to light!|`|EAqQXm7Oaa	There were compromises in that bill that dwarf any kind of bipartisanship that was offered to Democrats in the last 8 years. <br>  <br>  For instance, Republicans insisted the $15k tax credit for new homeowners be reduced, even though it goes against their platform. The Democrats brought it down to $8k to satisfy them.|`|fUh7LHzvaa	We put 48% tax cuts in the bill and even downsized it from the original amount. What more do you guys want?

Unless they started working at age 45.|`|Oi3CQnvHaa	It's more like working 40 or 50 years to get maybe 10-20 years of Social Security if you're lucky.<br>  You must be a really optimistic person if you think most people live to 95 LOL.<br>  <br>  My mom started working at 16 and never stopped.<br>    She will begin getting Social Security checks in a few months, no one deserves it more than her.  Though I have to say it's a measley monthly pittens for the labor she put in her entire life...and she will continue to work part time while getting SS even in her "retirement".  <br>  <br>  The american way, I suppose.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, I don't think the spending "sprees" will change much.  People who always ate out will continue to eat out, maybe just a bit less if at all.   The grocery store food is also very expensive and Americans are notoriously lazy and will remain so, financial calamity or not.<br>  People will still buy crap they don't need at Wal Mart,<br>  People will still buy cloths, just not as many and maybe cheaper stuff, because of the financial calamity there is an abundance of reduced priced goods.   So as long as people still have a dispensible income, they will stil be a consumer.<br>  <br>  The things that will end are "investment" purchases from the little people, home buying and car buying.<br>  <br>  People at the top won't feel much a change except that many of the places they like are going out of business.
yQ0OzEbZaa	Welcome to the Chicago Way. This is what America voted for in 2008 — crap with a lot of perfume applied to it by the media to hide the stink. The only way to make it big in Chicago politics is to pay to play, and this is an environment in which Obama not only existed but thrived.

Think a little harder.  You think that rooting for a team is the equivalent of attending college and graduating? You think doing a research paper is the equivalent of whining? LOL<br>  <br>  Obviously you have no idea what college entails or what a RESEARCH paper is. In her paper she reported on attitudes of people she interviewed and from surveys she conducted. Not HER opinion.<br>  <br>  And she didn't write the paper for her Graduate degree, it was for her Bachelor's degree.<br>  <br>  PS I would believe  you are 12 before I would believe you have a graduate degree based on what you wrote.<br>  <br>  PPS If you had an Master's in "Engineering" you would have said in Electrical, Civil or Mechanical Engineering  and you wouldn't be living in the Ghetto wearing your baseball hat backwards.|`|AA11997524	Look we've moved past the atrocities against blacks.  But that doesn't undo the harm that was done.  And that is no reason to ignore what happened and how it effects the psyche.  Saying, it's the past, get over it, just isn't realistic, and seems a very "white" thing to say.  One generalization about a group of ppl meets another.  That's not the kind of thing ppl just get over.  But your ignorance, and I don't mean that in a derogatory way either, is well unavoidable, being as you've never been the truly oppressed.  And knowing family members that were, it changes your perception of good ppl, and almost instills this need to overcompensate to feel equal.  That's just the status quo, you don't have to understand it, but accept that ppl do feel that way.  <br>  <br>  My friends are like a rainbow, being a military wife, but once a girl told me I was great, and she followed that by saying I'm just like a white girl.  I've never felt racism first hand, but I had to wonder what her generalizations about hispanic ppl were, and if she considered me like her, what did she consider other ppl she met.  I don't know, I'm not one to play the race card, I was always raised with whites, blacks, asians, I'm lucky.  But I notice this among ppl who were raised in a homogeneous town, where everyone looks the same.  If they are white, the generalizations come about minorities, and if they are minority, then the generalizations come about whites, and other minorities, and when they mingle in life, one always feel the need to overcompensate for the sins of dead ppl.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Interesting....after searching the ACTUAL thesis, I can find NO mention of the words 'ineradicably racist'.

You are to show respect to the persons on trial and show respect to the judge and the officers in the courtroom. Everyone that participates in the jury process dresses accordingly.  I have been on several juries and the people that show up in shorts are sent back to their car to change.  If they do not come back, it as if they have not appreared at all.  Don't get in trouble.  Have a little respect.  How would you feel if you were on trial and one of the people on the jury was some young kid who showed up every day in shorts while all the others were dressed accordingly.  Would you feel safe knowing the person on the jury who dressed like this holds your future in his hands when he hands down his decision of "guilty" or "not guilty"?  Have a little class.  It is not a picnic you are attending.|`|fgIbNRHfaa	It is a matter of showing your respect to the Court and the Judge.  I am an attorney, and sometimes I wear capri pants with a nice blouse to the office.  But if I know I will be in Court, I wear a suit.  It's a matter of respect and general good manners.  While jurors do not have to wear suits, they are supposed to dress in a respectful manner which indicates that they understand the nature of the responsibility with which they have been entrusted.|`|O1PpybX0aa	actually a lot of judges will kick people out of their courtroom who are not dressed appropriately -- no shorts, no tank tops, etc.<br>  <br>  it means that one should come dressed appropriately for court.<br>  They say that because you would be surprised how many morons show up not appropriately dressed for court.

Although I do not have any polls supporting this, I'm pretty sure the majority of Americans would not support cutting our defense budget unless our economy goes totally to hell.  If the military budget is cut I seriously doubt we will "BRAC" all our overseas locations and put at risk our full-spectrum dominance that the US has worked so hard to achieve.

gvukdlOjaa	Being a gun bunny is fun.  I saw an incredible display at Ft Bragg several years ago where a Blackhawk had a slung-loaded howitzer that flew into the firing area, dropped off the gun and the crew, and they sent a round downrange in an incredibly short amount of time.<br>  <br>  As a Cav Scout, we dealt with Arty guys very often.  They loved us in the Balkans because we'd actually give them a job to do.  <br>  <br>  Arty is important in any conflict for a variety of reasons, so there is definitely job security.<br>  <br>  However, as civilian job security goes, like the AF guy said, there isn't much of a demand for gun bunnies in the real world.  Your experience being in a combat arms MOS is helpful, but you need more than just that.|`|sLEdPDkHaa	I cant tell you what branch is better but both in the Army and Marines its the same jobs  some of it is hard work setting up a site carrying the shells or even calling out the artillery strikes from a forward position or manning the radar or using maps<br>  <br>  your right artillery is not used much in today's battles because if you clear out a whole grid square you just committed a war crime with the huge civilian deaths ! ( I say its war be dammed who's in the way!!) <br>  <br>  a 13bravo in the Army only needs a very low ASVAB(the guys running around with shells) score i think as low as 45 or 50<br>  <br>  but the other pos. in Field artillery need higher scores|`|9wrMpXRyaa	You should think about what you will do after the military.<br>  <br>  Will Field Artillery have a future in the civilian sector?  Unlikely.  <br>  <br>  I went into the USAF with a heavy emphasis in electronics.  The first job I got upon my discharge was at IBM.  If I had not insisted on electronics and got stuck in a missile silo, which the recruiter was pushing on me, I'd probably start working at McDonalds.<br>  <br>  Blowing up things is fun however, so if you like that, consider demolition. <br>  <br>  USAF/ANG<br>  Honorable 1983<br>  <br>  .
icRwgQ7waa	The question itself does not make sense to me. Ex Parte is a proceeding that takes place without (ex) the parties (parte). In Florida, if I serve questions on the other side and they never file any answers and the answers are overdue, I can file an ex parte motion to compel the responses. I file the motion to compel ex parte (which means it will be granted by the court w/o a hearing with the parties being present) and send in a proposed order for the judge to sign and mail back to everyone.<br>  <br>  If there is a court case, go on line or call the clerk's office or the judge's office to find out what kind of case it is, how they got your name and what proceeding is scheduled to take place that day. Hopefully they told you the name of the case you are appearing in. If not call back whoever called you and get this info. Normally notices of hearings come by mail, not via phone so I think there is a lot missing factually to this situation. Hope that helps.|`|9XJLlPaEaa	So just you and the judge, you might not be accused of anything, but you should contact the office of the clerk of the court.|`|KKh8rikGaa	Don't know the answer but don't his sound a lot like socialism /Communism, maybe we could call Obama and ask him
bd14bcb63a014dafbf329297cbde4881aa	They want to keep their independence and freedom.|`|qq5nceCXaa	It's not an excuse it's historical imperative.<br>  <br>  Norway has only been an independent country since 1905 and in that time has been invaded and occupied.  There is a strong streak of maintaining independence as the country had to wait so long to get it.  That combined with a concern around exploitation of natural resources and a feeling that there was little else to be gained kept Norway out.  <br>  <br>  The Norwegian social contract is also not that fond of the neo liberal market driven approach, believing that society as a whole needs to be involved in the means of production and the benefits of exploitation of the countries resource.  This is best seen in the management of the oil resources.  Of course the calculation of EU dues through export values also hits Norway hard.<br>  <br>  As the EU is Norway's closest trading partner and through it's association with the EEA means that Norway adopts most EU regulations into national law.  It is also part of the Schengen area and allows free movement of people from the EU into Norway on a very similar basis to free movement within the EU itself.  Norway actually pays quite a bit into the running of the EU/EEA structures through this mechanism, and the issue is likely to become a hot topic again if, or should I say when, Iceland joins the EU due to the economic chrisis.<br>  <br>  The Norwegian No to EU movement has some articles on their website that discuss these issues in more depth|`|1mZTOQHEaa	Norway first time lost their independence in the 1200's and didn't get it back before they finally wrote the constitution in 1814. They then were more or less forced into a personal union (they shared king) with Sweden until the Storting declared it null and void in 1905, due to the fact that the king was unable to form a government.<br>  <br>  The Norwegian people then decided to call upon the Danish prince Christian Frederik Carl Georg Valdemar Axel to take the throne, and he took the name Haakon VII. After that time, the only people who have wanted Norway in the hands of foreign powers have for the most part been traitors (Quisling, etc.), and the attempts of joining any unions at all have been considered to be of no interest to the population at all.<br>  <br>  In short: Norway wants to rule its own territory and people, and do not accept that officials in Brussels or other parts of the world take authority over internal affairs and who should be allowed to fish in their part of the seas.|`|aRbA9ZRlaa	Why should they???They have no reason to join.Maybe they dont like that last decisions come from Brussels(they lose some of their political power) or they dont wont to get trough EU intergrations process which includes adoption and change of law to match EU criteria.Somthing that Bosnia,Croatia and Serbia have to.I hope it helped! :D

After verifying my vaccines were in specification I then attended city, state and federally sponsored schools where I was taught by state certified teachers a state certified curriculum. My breakfast was state certified and subsidized dairy, in state certified containers maintained in refrigerators manufactured in OSHA, EPA, and Commerce department controlled processes.  Then I moved requiring me to fly on a federally maintained airplane, in a federally controlled airspace to a city, state and federally maintained airport... Well I made it to five years old and my hands are tired.  <br>  <br>  The idea is - each step of my life, a slew of government employees were buying off on my continued existence in return for fat paychecks paid for by my ever-loving parents who lived in a one room shack with no insurance, no washing machine, no medical care except what a friend who was an intern could provide, cold water, and a car so old no one made parts for it for 20 years.

You accept government intrusion into your life because you have been indoctrinated into that mind set. People are not responsible because the government allows that. Why do we need a sticker on a chainsaw that says don't use this to clean your teeth. Not because people are doing it, because the government allowed some dumb *** to sue a company for their own negligence.

Who are you kidding?  I'm very conservative but you are really limiting things here.  I don't adhere to limiting the things that are major issues.  I don't want lower taxes.  I'd rather see the IRS abolished so having no taxation would limit the governments spending.  I'd also like to see the Federal Reserve shut off from printing its fiat money, so the government actually may have something to back up the capital that is miss represented.  I don't think we could seize the Federal Government in size without getting rid of ridiculous programs.  I could see that security would be less, because security takes away liberties that were originally granted to us. Unalienable rights, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. As long as no one else's lives are in jeopardy then why not have those rights?  We live under Capitalism, or some form of it.  You can start a business here and be successful.  You can make money and spend it as easily as it's made, but under the USA of my dreams the economic crisis wouldn't be under concern.  Because the money would be there, and would be supported by business and infrastructure.  The country would have leaders that made sense.  In orders of running Congress we'd have background checks done on all of them because they are faulty at times.  The country would be ran swiftly, with less resistance from both parties.  The respect would be seen and heard through one man to another.  The country would be heavily militant, with stronger forces to protect ourselves from foreign threats.  But, we'd also cut down our ties with nations and be less diplomatic in hopes of staying out of most foreign affairs.  A country of less corrupt government, swift business, and small foreign policy would be in a class of its own that would make other nations want to model ours.|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	The U.S.A. of my dreams is already described in the Constitution of the United States of America.<br>  <br>  If Thomas Jefferson was alive today, he wouldn't  recognize what America has become.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	Equal opportunity to pursue ones dreams.<br>  <br>  Try starting a business.<br>  <br>  Try doing anything.<br>  <br>  Government has gone wild!|`|d3b6fdf2d631c2f5712339448db9e43caa	my dream, that someone would buy my ic502 cell phone. right now.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	The Federal Government would be back inside the limits prescribed by the Constitution.

Anyone filing a lawsuit that was completely without merit would have to pay all court costs.<br>  <br>  Public Schools would be back under the control of the States.  Unnecessary environmental regulations would be repealed and any new regulations could not be arbitrarily imposed by any Federal Agency but would require Legislative action.  <br>  <br>  The right to carry a concealed firearm would be recognized in all 50 States.  Roe vs. Wade would be overturned and the decision to permit abortion and control of abortion would be the job of each State again. <br>  <br>  Primaries would be limited to Party Members in good standing only.  Voting methods would be standardized to prevent fraud.  Social Security would permit the right for people to opt for a private plan.  <br>  <br>  People who wish to receive welfare, unless they are disabled, would be required to become wards of the State.  They would loose their voting rights and child custody.  Their children would reside in State run boarding schools, where they will receive counseling, schooling, proper nutrition, discipline and medical care.  The Parent would be required to show up every morning at 8 am and spend the day attending classes to gain or improve language and reading skills, lean good personal hygiene, parenting classes, receive psychological counseling or rehab, be subjected to drug testing and helped to find a job.<br>  <br>  When the person proves that he is capable of supporting himself he may petition that his autonomy to be restored.

Why force them to conform if the majority of the people who live there do not want it?

VB3ZK5f9aa	As custodian, your father had a duty to tell you of the account when you turned 18.  (And certainly could have told you sooner.)  If he was concerned you would not spend the money wisely at 18, that was a personal concern only - you had a legal right to know (as far as I know).  He is not allowed to put personal opinion above the legal requirement.  (I'm sure thousands of parents don't think their 18 yr old is responsible enough, but.....).<br>  <br>  He knew that money was there when he spent 15G on your 1st yr of college.  That was his free choice.<br>  <br>  I suspect (between the lines) that he didn't approve of your marriage.  That if you were single and in college he would be paying tuition still.  Those are individual choices by two individuals- you and your Dad.<br>  No comment by me.<br>  <br>  But he is apparently trying to make his disapproval and control of your adult life be retroactive to his decision to pay for school *before* you got married.  That is wrong.  You are an adult, and the fund is legally yours (again, as far as I know).  Since he paid your tuition willingly (were there any stated conditions?)  it is wrong of him to claim he needs immediate repayment.  The legal concept "ex post facto" may apply.<br>  <br>  He can withhold any of *his* money from now on, but cannot/should not control *your money*.  <br>  <br>  I'd suggest writing him a letter, covering some of these points.  A carefully put letter can avoid some of the arguments and misunderstandings in a situation like this.  Also, you get to lay out your entire argument without being interrupted and sidetracked.<br>  <br>  So yes, I think your UGMA account/education money is being held hostage.  I'm not sure he can "reimburse" himself from the account, if it is now legally yours.  I have no legal experience, just life experience and what I've picked up.  Find out what bank holds the account and talk to the bank people directly about what the terms of the account are, if the custodian has any control once you're past 18.  Maybe you can just get teh money directly.<br>  <br>  Of course, this concerns more than money.  Hope I haven't gone overboard.  Good luck.

The figures are on the Treasury site.<br>  <br>  The claim is generally made that Clinton had a surplus of $69 billion in FY1998, $123 billion in FY1999 and $230 billion in FY2000 . In that same link, Clinton claimed that the national debt had been reduced by $360 billion in the last three years, presumably FY1998, FY1999, and FY2000--though, interestingly, $360 billion is not the sum of the alleged surpluses of the three years in question ($69B + $123B + $230B = $422B, not $360B).<br>  <br>  While not defending the increase of the federal debt under President Bush, it's curious to see Clinton's record promoted as having generated a surplus. It never happened. There was never a surplus and the facts support that position. In fact, far from a $360 billion reduction in the national debt in FY1998-FY2000, there was an increase of $281 billion.<br>  <br>  Verifying this is as simple as accessing the U.S. Treasury website where the national debt is updated daily and a history of the debt since January 1993 can be obtained.|`|AA10837077	Every single time Social Security has been raided it was by a Democrat President and Congress and they have never replaced one penny.<br>  <br>  This is what Clinton and Gore did. Both told older folks in their campaigns that Republicans would take their Soc. Security from them and who in fact does it. Obama wants to place a higher tax on it.<br>  <br>  Yesterday the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its preliminary re estimate of the White House budget. This follows the Joint Committee on Taxation's (JCT) re estimate of the Clinton White House's tax provisions last week. Together, CBO and JCT are Congress' official estimators -- nonpartisan entities that Clinton himself promised to use when he first took office back in 1993.<br>  <br>  President Clinton has promised to protect Social Security, to reduce the debt to the maximum extent possible, to control spending, and reduce taxes. But, Congress' official estimators show that on all four counts, the President's budget fails. Instead, Clinton's budget raids the Social Security trust fund for $158 billion in five years, it artificially erases the surplus, it lowers the public debt less than doing nothing would, it increases spending, and it raises taxes by $89.7 billion over the 1999-2009 period. <br>  <br>  Clinton Raids Social Security: According to CBO, Clinton spends $40 billion of the Social Security surplus in his budget's first year (2000) and $158 billion over the first five years (2000-2004).<br>  <br>  This is the same Social Security surplus that he has promised to save in its entirety.<br>  <br>  This is the biggest reason S.S. is in trouble. Clinton did not have a surplus. He left us in debt we are still paying for.<br>  <br>  Social Security pays 1/2 to 1 percent interest. Pass book savings pay more. This is how the Democrats artifically make it look like they have a surplus. If your relative dies before the end of the month, even one hour before the first of the next month you will have to return the whole of their months Social Security check. That is what the Democrats did for the American people.|`|fUh7LHzvaa	All Presidents have been taking from social security, difference is that Clinton presided over a internet boom which put more tax dollars into the coffers.|`|LqBIKJbcaa	You're right, it was a shell game.

At the time the Republicans were scrambling to find answers, and they could find none.  That's one of the reasons Clinton was so popular.  He cared about the people, he did things to help the people and he spoke well while doing these things.<br>  <br>  Your man Bush...embarrassed the nation by stealing an election.  He then WASTED the surplus in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Where do you think he got the money from?  <br>  <br>  Republicans can try to take credit for all of the Democrats' achievements...but it's funny.  But here's a few facts they CAN'T hide:<br>  <br>  1. While Republicans are in office, there's always a war going on... from Reagan to Bush to Bush.<br>  <br>  2. When Republicans leave office there is always a deficit, high unemployment and other financial struggles.<br>  <br>  3. When Republicans leave office we are always hated by a lot of countries as they generally bumble and stumble throughout the world, involving themselves in other people's resources.  Such as oil and gas.  <br>  <br>  4. When Republicans leave office, most of the unions are laying on their backs with their feet up in the air.  And the union representatives are hiding out in their cars.<br>  <br>  <br>  Republicans claim that they're better at foreign policy.  What they don't say is they're horrible at domestic policy.  And, well, as happy as I am that Iraq is free (whoopie!), I think Americans vote so that a person can become president of the United States...NOT Iraq.  Really, I'd like to know who keeps voting them back in.  I'd like to find the people, tie him / her to a chair and force them to watch CNN and MSNBC.  After that, the person will be a born again Democrat.  <br>  <br>  Too much Fox News will turn you into Sarah Palin...I betcha.<br>  <br>  Edit:  To Killer Queen:  The Republicans had the chance to dispute Clinton's claim about ending the deficit when he was president.  1. They didn't.  2. They tried to take credit for it (see Ann Coulter).  <br>  <br>  So don't try to pretend that the debt wasn't balanced.  Not one person was saying it wasn't there at the time.  Were you alive then?  If so, you have a VERY short memory.  That's like trying to argue that Micheal Jordan WASN'T the best player who ever lived.  You can try, but you just look silly as everyone around you shakes their heads sadly and turn away as you stumble over your tongue.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	It was a budget surplus not a real surplus.

You still with me here ?<br>  <br>  But George Dick & Donald ! Had our military invade Iraq which had no WMD nor did Iraq have any thing to do with 9/11 nor did Iraq support any of the Terrorist from 9/11 ! Nor did Iraq have any kind of Terrorist camps as did that of Afghanistan . <br>  <br>  So now tell every one how George did not blow not only our surplus but<br>  any thing and every thing that he had any thing to do with went to "Hell" in a hand Basket . So now you know just how wrong the Republican Party was for the last eight . That cost over 4,000 American<br>  military service Men & women , and for what ?<br>  <br>  And can you tell America just how much money the War in Iraq has cost America & The American People ?

yUTOolj4aa	First you need to "write" a letter not "right" a letter. Secondly I suggest you go to a library (that's a place where they have books on paper) and find a good book on that portion of the war. Read the descriptions of the battle and then put yourself in a soldiers frame of mind and write a letter home to your family.|`|GX1G2yhOaa	I had to do this assignment too, a long time ago...<br>  anyways, i don't know what the battle of vimy ridge is but i have a few suggestions. you should write about "a day in the life", so after you have written the intro (if you are "writing home" to your family, say how much you miss them or something), write about what happens when you first wake up. Soldiers in WW1 would sleep in trenches (this was the age of trench warfare) and after waking up (at dawn) would stand ready for the first sign of attack. if there was no attack, they would go eat breakfast (canned food, perhaps a rat) and do their daily chores (refilling sandbags, digging more trenches). You could describe the food and living conditions. You could also talk about the diseases. many soldiers would get trench foot from walking in muddy trenches or get shell-shocked from all thebombs flying aroun. After this you could write about a battle scene. Bombs would be flying everywhere and soldiers that tried to advance on no-man's land would get shot down. Often soldiers would get stuck in barbed wire and get shot to death. You should end your letter by saying how thankful you are to be alive.<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped. :))

cab63c7629d665e7d2f0151df748fdd5aa	It IS interesting isn't it?  <br>  <br>  I think people don't understand the issues well enough so when the media says "Caribou barbie is an idiot" and they provide a sound bite, everyone jumps on board.<br>  <br>  For example, Charlie Gibson asks her about the "Bush Doctrine."  Palin asks, essentially, "Which one?"  Gibson refuses to answer and so Palin states the truth - the Bush doctrine is a reflection of his view of the world.  There are 7 Bush doctrines, so regardless of how she answered they could have said she was an idiot.  She did the right thing to ask for specifics.<br>  <br>  Gibson then asks about the proximity of Alaska to Russia and she explains "We're right next door."  She answered the question.<br>  <br>  When she's asked about Foreign Policy and mentions Russia again, she's right on.  The National Guard in Alaska has to be ready for any problems that may come from Russia and so she actually DOES have more experience in Foreign Policy than Barack - at least from the stand point of needing to be prepared.  Just as the Governors of places like Texas and California need to have more awareness about problems in Mexico, Palin has more awareness about concerns from Russia.<br>  <br>  If you review news articles, she actually was NEVER for the bridge to nowhere but as a representative of the people she did work for it.  When it was obvious that it could not happen, she was instructed to keep the money and use it for roads in Alaska - which she did.<br>  <br>  When Katie asked what specific bills, etc. McCain had voted on that made him a maverick, Palin said she'd look it up.  Like asking for the court case, numbers, and dates of any case, people don't memorize that.  Palin did the right thing by saying she'd get back to Katie on this.<br>  <br>  When asked about specific publications she reads, this was a set up to make her look like an idiot.  Whatever answer she gave would have been wrong - too conservative, too liberal, too simple, too complex, too highbrow, too "back woods."  So she gave a general answer.  Good job.<br>  <br>  As for the lobbyist, she was right on there as well but if you haven't done your research you may not know this.  The Universities in her area had asked for research money to study seals and crabs.  She requested money for this on their behalf as a representative of her state.  She did not use lobbyists for this as some would have.  That would have cost thousands.  However, when she was mayor, they did hire a lobbyist as that is the way it is done if you want any money for your town.  The difference is: studying crabs vs. building infrastructure so a city survives.  She's smart and acted in integrity.<br>  <br>  The problem with earmarks and lobbyists, etc. is that if you don't take them (work with them), someone else will.  It's a tough spot to be in, but you need to speak up for your people.  That's why they appointed her.  <br>  <br>  She is experienced but not a Washington insider.  I think that's a good thing and hope she runs in 2012.<br>  <br>  The media was pro-Obama and really just went after Palin with a vengeance.|`|GIxvzkA9aa	I know, its atrocious.

The whole reason John McCain picked her over other choices was because she was a women, and the votes Hilary received might be able to be picked up by Sarah.  But, it still didn't make much of a difference.  She's not dumb.  She's just from a more conservative state that has less spending and less socialist tendencies.  I'm kind of glad that McCain didn't win because Washington, D.C. would of picked her apart from every angle they could.  Sincere people don't make good politicians only liars and crooks do. I'm neither Democrat or Republican.  I'm libertarian, and could care less about Republicans and democrats.  People can say as they want about the little lady but I'd take her and McCain over the disgusting socialist president we have now.  He makes Clinton look like an angel with his bailouts and social handouts.  I hate big governments and bureaucracies.  I doubt we'd have as much socialism being spread if McCain and Palin were in office.  But, then again conservatives and liberals do the same things alot of the times.|`|636202a5daab42fdc568f4ed6abb39e3aa	okay, i will try to explain this to you. the main purpose of the vice president is to have someone who will step in if the president dies. Palin was the running mate of John McCain, who is in his 70s and not in good health. So it's a distinct possibility that he might pass away in the next few years, which would make her president. You keep saying people are "hating" Palin but it's more that people felt she wasn't qualified to be the President of the United States. She showed in interviews that she didn't have the most basic knowledge of many of the issues that the president has to deal with. a lot of people felt George W. Bush was not so smart so voters are particularly aware of what can happen when someone like that is the president. the job of president is very important and it's in all our interests that the person in that job is smart. it's not that she's a bad person but that she isn't the right person for that job. I hope this helps you understand this.
u9g2Cl6Eaa	FACT - the USA spends more on healthcare PER PERSON than any other nation on the planet.  <br>  <br>  FACT - the US has higher death rates for kids aged under five than western European countries with universal health coverage.<br>  <br>  That means that a dead American four year old would have had a better chance of life if they were born in Canada, France, Cuba, Germany, Japan etc, all of which have universal health coverage.<br>  <br>  I guess all those dead American kids who would have lived if born in Western Europe or Canada were obese eh?|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Health care is expensive because of  a lack of competition and because we have to pay for all of those uninsured people, who can't afford to pay for health care, to sit in the emergency rooms waiting on an ER doctor to help them with medicine for the flu.|`|LZY9yDIfaa	Its not JUST obesity but that's a major factor.

Sports, and drinking, drugs and driving.   All risky behaviors that their chubbier compatriots don't tend to engage in.<br>  Up until the age of forty, more people die of accidents than anything else.  <br>  Health care is expensive because now, for the first time in history we can do things that actually can keep us alive.  Even diabetes can be controlled, hearts operated on, kidneys transplanted, cataracts removed and sight restored.  Just fifty years ago most of that was the stuff of dreams.

JLg8XNUCaa	After 28 years as a public assistance caseworker, I concluded that most poor people are poor because they have made very unwise choices in their lives, and then, instead of accepting the blame, they spend time and energy blaming others.  They focus so much of their lives on the most ridiculous things instead of making goals and sticking with them.  Many of the single moms who were already poor as dirt took up with guys who were just out of prison, or were even less ambitious as them, or who were just plain no good.  So it is a perpetual cycle of one bad choice after another.  <br>  <br>  The rich became rich because they have goals, stick with them, are not deterred by set-backs but instead overcome them.  The rich have almost always become rich from good old-fashioned hard work, sacrifices, education, and determination.|`|My65doewaa	No.<br>  <br>  People are poor because of their own decisions and actions.

With all this, the economy will definitely improve over the course of 4 years. Alternate energy programs will also create jobs. Also, those making under $250k will receive a larger tax cut (more than $13 a week) and larger financial aid so they can pay their morgages, buy more things from businesses, and the economy will eventually recover.

AA12109395	For your violation and a recommendation from your PO, the judge now has the option to impose whatever your original maximum sentence was which may include jail time if it applies. This is separate and apart for punishment on the new charge.|`|c07v7O80aa	Depends on what the probation office wants to do, what the prosecutor wants to do, and what the court will do.  Likely, they will file a motion to revoke or a motion to modify. I suspect it will be the revocation one. You will be arrested. If it was misdemeanor probation, you will probably have a bond set. If it's felony probation, there is often no bond allowed. It will be set for hearing. You have the right to counsel. The difference between this and a trial on an original charge is that the standard of proof is much lower. You can be revoked or modified, even if not convicted of the new offense. You may be revoked to serve the sentence out, modified to continue on probation with new conditions or perhaps doing some jail time as a condition of probation, or merely continued on probation as before. Of course, if they fail to file the motion before you run out, you're off probation. I suspect they won't let that happen.
RrmO1xkuaa	It's too late to do anything about it, just hope they don't take your message too seriously (although being already on probation doesn't look too good). You shouldn't have used such a strong language, the girl has every right to say no.

Although the FTC does not have the authority to bring criminal cases, the FTC can help victims of identity theft by providing information to assist them in resolving the financial and other problems that can result from this crime. The FTC puts your information into a secure consumer fraud database and may, in appropriate instances, share it with other law enforcement agencies and private entities, including any companies about which you may complain. You can reach the FTC directly by:<br>  <br>  Calling toll-free at 1-877-IDTHEFT (1-877-438-4338). <br>  The FTC can also be reached at its website at <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/." rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/id...</a> <br>  The Social Security Administration cannot fix your credit record if someone has misused your Social Security number (SSN) to obtain credit. To resolve your credit problems, you need to contact the institution that authorized the credit and/or issued the credit card, as well as the major credit reporting agencies. Obtain a copy of your credit report and ask that an alert be placed on your credit record requiring that you be contacted before credit is extended using your name and SSN. The three major credit reporting agencies are:<br>  <br>  Equifax — 1-800-525-6285 <br>  Trans Union — 1-800-680-7289 <br>  Experian — 1-888-397-3742 <br>  Work with each credit bureau, creditor, employer and government agency involved to remove inaccurate information from your records. You should continue checking your credit report annually for inaccuracies. Keep copies of your correspondence, records of your telephone calls and other documents verifying your efforts to correct the problem.<br>  <br>  The Federal government and numerous states have passed laws prohibiting identity theft. Anyone who intentionally uses the Social Security number of another person to establish a new identity or defraud the government is breaking the law.<br>  <br>  To get more information about the Social Security numbers and identity theft, download the following publications and/or visit the following websites.|`|U8j8q0Bzaa	check out this site<a href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/10064.html#using" rel="nofollow">http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/10064...</a>|`|EGE2b5OXaa	Here is the website for Social Security<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ssa.gov/</a>
GtgH5Yhbaa	Semi-Automatic rifles (one shot per trigger pull) are perfectly legal. I am the proud owner of a Century Arms AK myself. <br>  The rifle must be shipped to a dealer who possesses a Federal Firearms License. You must be 18 years old and not have any felony convictions. You'll fill out a form and a background check will be conducted, most likely over the phone. <br>  <br>  Now is not a good time to be in the market for an inexpensive AK, simply because with the election results many people are panic buying and prices are skyrocketing. <br>  <br>  Check out AtlanticFirearms.com, they have some quality rifles for sale right now, prices are high but not unreasonably so, considering the current climate. Also visit AK47.net, it's the AK side of AR15.com and the largest AR15/AK resource on the web. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NnUAXyCGaa	1.First check the laws of your State at <a href="http://www.nraila.org/GunLaws/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nraila.org/GunLaws/</a><br>  <br>  VA looks like you are OK.

If you want to call the judge's office to see if a ruling was issued you can, but you should get a copy of the order in the mail (or your lawyer should and I am assuming you have one if you are in a custody battle.<br>  I am not sure I understand the second part of your question and something about keeping tabs on the parties.

I hope you realize there are many stations in Arizona that can be offered such as Tucson, Sonoita, Wilcox, Douglas, Casa Grande, Nogales, Ajo, Naco, Yuma, and Wellton. Do your research on all possible duty stations because there is no way to predict which one you will be offered.  Personally out of those two choices I would pick Casa Grande.

How is that possible?|`|JuCdw9dcaa	mainly because he is rich. It doesn't matter how he got rich, just that he is. Money does amazing things and also awful things. Look at the big actors that get caught doing drugs, the sports players that get caught juiced up or on drugs, the judges that get impeached but then run for office as a senator or congressman. If you got caught stealing at work or you was caught doing drugs you would get fired just like I would. By the way there are some  actual senators and congressmen in office now for real that were impeached in the other offices they held. If I stole a billion dollars I could grease the governments hands and they would give me a pass also. Voting people out of office is not the answer. Holding them accountable is.

cc45a7835eae87c6f861540fd8f4521daa	Left them as in went on vacation, or left them, as in abandoned them?  If it's the first, not much you can do (aside from file in court).  If it's the second, he has no legal right to them, and you can obtain custody fairly easily.  You should get a copy of the custody agreement (if one exists) and notify local law enforcement before you go get them.  Let them know you and your wife have separated, that she has abandoned them, and that as the only parent available you want to take them home with you.  In absence of any custody agreement, you usually have every right to do this if she isn't in the picture.  If she's just gone on vacation or something, though, you could potentially be charged with parental kidnapping.<br>  Your best bet might be to contact CPS, let them know you suspect she has abandoned them and of your intention to protect them by moving them back in with you.  Once you have their approval (or law enforcement's, whichever you get) you should be fine going to get them.  You might have to file for an emergency custody hearing in court to get it all legalized; that's something you'd have to ask about when you contact CPS.  If the boyfriend doesn't want to take care of them, that might be the easiest thing, as he might relinquish physical custody to you without involving law enforcement.

ou4yJ3G8aa	Are you asking were they fall in terms of military strength? You could disregard all the branches of military and look at the size of each countries nuclear arsenal and the quality of Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. If this was the method, the rankings would be as follows.<br>  <br>  1.) United States<br>  2.) Russia<br>  3.) Tie between UK and France<br>  4.) China<br>  5.) India tied with Israel <br>  6.) Pakistan<br>  7.) North Korea<br>  <br>  Realistically speaking however, one could argue that the UK, France, China, India, and Israel are all very similar in nuclear power. <br>  <br>  In terms of pure Military force, I can only venture a guess. <br>  1.) United States (not so much man power, more so in technology)<br>  2.) China (Most man power)<br>  3.) Russia (A good mix of man and machine)<br>  4.) UK (Not sure about this)<br>  5.) India<br>  6.) Israel (Although the most effective in the world) <br>  <br>  So you could say that India is the 5th most powerful military power, which logically makes sense. Would you agree?<br>  <br>  <br>  Additional....<br>  I didn't think about India's Navy as the first poster mentioned....So I'm going to say 4th...because I know the UK dosent have the most amazing Navy.<br>  <br>  Problem with the below link is that it only accounts for active troops, and clearly states thats what the rankings are based off of.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Never unfortunately. Democrats are not up to the job. Ultimately they are the defenders of the same interests as the Bush administration, interests that have nothing to do with truth, justice or the wishes of the American people. What's needed is not change, the hollow mantra of the Obama campaign, but social revolution.<br>  <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2009/2/11/16339/9491/383/696280" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2009/2...</a><br>  The five days of floor debate and backroom negotiations on the stimulus bill highlighted a basic difference between the two parties. Both are political instruments of the financial aristocracy, but the Republicans are the open advocates of big business. The Democrats pretend to defend the interests of the working people, while in practice serving the same corporate elite. This double-dealing role of the Democrats is expressed in their habitual spinelessness and insincerity.<br>  In an opposition role, the Republicans conduct themselves intransigently, while the Democrats bow and scrape, beg for "bipartisanship," and end up looking like the weaker party even when possessed, as now, of a sizable majority.<br>  With a Democrat in the White House, the Republican minority in Congress today attacks and blocks administration legislation, using every available parliamentary device, like the filibuster. When they were a majority in Congress, the Republicans even impeached a twice-elected president, Democrat Bill Clinton, on trumped-up charges.<br>  The Democrats, by contrast, never availed themselves of the full powers of the legislature when, against their own expectations, they won a congressional majority in 2006. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ruled out impeachment hearings over Bush's illegal wars, spying on Americans, and countless violations of the Constitution. The Democrats would neither vote down nor filibuster the stream of "emergency" bills to continue the funding of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br>  The Republicans, despite their overwhelming repudiation at the polls only four months ago, have no compunctions about threatening a filibuster in the Senate against an emergency stimulus bill, under conditions of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, one which is driving up the jobless toll by better than half a million a month.<br>  <br>  Millions of workers who voted for Obama are now coming face to face with the fact that his administration will defend the interests of the financial elite every bit as ruthlessly, if with a slightly different presentation, as the Bush administration.<br>  The solution to the economic crisis is not a technical question but a social, political and revolutionary settling of accounts, and a historical necessity. At a certain point in the late 18th century, it became necessary for the oppressed classes of France to rise up and destroy the power and privileges of the nobility. In the America of the 1860s, the only resolution to the “irrepressible conflict” was the destruction of the “slave power” in the South.<br>  At this point it is necessary to destroy the political and economic power of the financial aristocracy. A resolution to the economic crisis can only begin with an independent mass movement of the working class that aims to break the political stranglehold of the financial elite over society; the development, to be blunt, of a revolutionary movement.<br>  <br>  The Obama victory last November was of the people and realizing the truth about Obama and the Democratic party doesn't change the fact America rejected the failed policies of the regressive right.|`|VtXvmOIXaa	My best guess is 9/14/2009 after the mass 911 truth rallies are held.<br>  <br>  Here is a truth they ignore Bush was warned a month before the attacks and did nothing!<br>  <br>  Which is a clear case of dereliction of duty!|`|idgr5SC5aa	I hope they do.

Since they now have a suspect that they are planning to arrest and they have evidence against him (easier when they found the body) then anyone who doubted Gary Condit, would not know he was not involved.  In that way he was vindicated I guess.  I didn't see anything in the paper from either of them, but I think Condit was off the hook some time ago.|`|TrgbEjXoaa	He was never a suspect to begin with.  There has been no comment from either the Levys or the Condits.  Has Gary Condit been vindicated?  I don't know that he needed to be.|`|jbUsd8m9aa	He was vindicated a long time ago.

They actually interviewed a nurse at one of the Chicago hospitals who told the story of a baby who survived and was placed on a table in the trash room to die. She took the baby and held and rocked it for 45 minutes until it did die because they could not give it medical treatment. Alan Keyes was part of the race when Obama first ran for the senate here in IL. After the two leading democrats were taken off the ballot because of a technicality, which was pointed out by a legal filing from then lawyer Obama,  in their petition to run, and once Jack Ryan was ousted by the tribune. Then came Alan Keyes who did not have a chance because of all the support for Obama. Typical Chicago style politics.

Like Michelle Bachman, Sarah Palin and George W. Bush he is an ignorant side show freak, who isn't at all honest as he pretends nor does he have any substativeness too him.  His opposition to sanctions on South Africa to protest apartheid shows how eagerly he will sell his people out, lot of former campaign workers say he runs for office to mainly line his own pockets and leave his campaign lenders dry, he wrote through his campaign $20,000.00 worth of returned checks and then blamed his campaign workers, this dufus seems allergic to looking at his books let alone balance his checkbook, and then claims it's not his responsibility, like campaigns have some sort of corporate veil behind them.  I hope the GOP and I'm not a Republican would stop doing themselves this type of disservice just to have a black candidate who unlike Colin Powell (a true gentleman and a good champion of affirmative action and civil rights) turns on his people when its convenient.  I would just hope Alan Keyes would leave the U.S. to start his own country somewhere in some desserted island and call it SoreLooserVille with emphasis on the word LOOSER!

5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	First world countries tend to have below or at replacement level birth rates.  Don't believe me? Look up the average birth rate for Italy, France, Japan and even the United States.  Replacement rate is 2.1 births per woman.  The European countries and Japan are actually facing a health care crisis (worse than ours) because of the extreme disparity between the baby boom generation and the younger generation.  If over population is in fact a problem, it's a problem that's originating outside of our jurisdiction.  <br>  <br>  The countries with the most population growth are those that are newly emerging onto the world economic scene.  History shows that when these countries reach the point of educating their women and providing easily accessible birth control their birth rates will go down to something equivalent to replacement or even lower.  When women are educated to something equivalent to a college level, it cuts the time that they are able to bear children down by at least a third. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't suggest resorting to some crazy measures that most would consider a violation of human rights (please see China's forced abortions for reference). Instead, we should invest in education for women and birth control. Stabilization will happen naturally. You just have to be willing to ride out the wave.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	There are also academic studies suggesting the population will hit a peak and then decline before levelling out. But we are nowhere near at that level yet.<br>  <br>  The fact is that there IS enough to go around, it is just up to us to distribute things fairly. This is not Mother Nature's fault if human greed and inequity affects some people adversely.<br>  <br>  btw the ones who think Africa is the home of over-population. The most densely populated country in Africa is Rwanda. But 27 countries outside Africa are more heavily populated than Rwanda is. Sudan is 194th in the World in terms of population density. The UK is 49th, the Netherlands 24th. The US (177th) is more densely populated than several African countries.|`|WhcPr1yraa	This is a good point. Even if everyone becomes "green" and reduces their consumption of resources by 1/2 it won't matter if the population quadruples, particularly in terms of water.<br>  <br>  Once population passes the point of being sustainable, then nature will correct it by causing people to die off either from thirst, starvation, or disease.|`|IFVrLCNOaa	I think religion plays a big role in keeping political focus off the topic.<br>  In other words, not many people will step out to say birth control is needed due to space constraints and resource limits.<br>  For kicks, search the web for Buck v.

Part of the problem is people are too compassionate and too giving. If you let nature take its course in Africa and other third world countries, instead of providing food and cures for disease, the population problem would solve itself. Instead, people give too much money to these causes and in the end, more people will suffer because the population base is larger.|`|iuoB7pf0aa	<a href="http://www.xanga.com/RuDun/231730770/item/" rel="nofollow">http://www.xanga.com/RuDun/231730770/ite...</a><br>  <br>  No, that is not the way it works.

Which is a far better reaction than John Kerry claims to have had. <br>  <br>  This excerpt from his interview with Larry King.  <br>  <br>  KING: Where were you? (when the first plane hit the WTC)<br>  <br>  "KERRY: I was in the Capitol. We'd just had a meeting -- we'd just come into a leadership meeting in Tom Daschle's office, looking out at the Capitol. And as I came in, Barbara Boxer and Harry Reid were standing there, and we watched the second plane come in to the building. And we shortly thereafter sat down at the table and then we just realized nobody could think, and then boom, right behind us, we saw the cloud of explosion at the Pentagon. And then word came from the White House, they were evacuating, and we were to evacuate, and so we immediately began the evacuation.<br>  <br>  It is easy to sit back and criticize.

You're in the middle of a story and you can't just leave. Yes, he did want to portray an image of calm, and as the TEACHER said, she felt that he held himself as the best leader she had ever seen throughout that whole time.|`|ou4yJ3G8aa	I really want to know what people think he was capable of really doing within 30 mins anyway? The president is not the be all end all of spur of the moment military decisions. They don't have to call his cell phone, or text his I-phone to put a couple f-15's on the sky.

What did you want him to do? Like the rest of us he was truly shocked. Unlike the rest of us he had very important decisions to be made for this country, if he needed 7 minutes to pull himself together then he deserved that.|`|NzKNNFwIaa	He didn't go around freaking out talking about a crisis.  He maintained his calm and composure, waited to get some solid information and went from there.  What was he supposed to do?  Panic the children?  That would have demonstrated good leadership (NOT).|`|NQYKzv7faa	I dont think he knew what to do.  I dont actually know now what he should have done.

This question is really dumb.|`|YwLNMo7jaa	Should he have jumped up n down and started screaming???<br>  <br>  You are the clueless one!|`|de711i5Vaa	Since he was in a classroom full of young kids, he kept his cool so he wouldn't traumatize or frighten them.

Clueless, mindless kool aid drinkers.|`|LZLQKUMPaa	so you don't want to do before you got all the information .sounds like you could be the next democratic president you've got all the answers instantly .|`|3iL7V04waa	It's a little shocking to hear that your country has been attacked by terrorists as a civilian, let alone as the President.  It would have been unprofessional to flip out.  He was probably truly contemplating what to do next.  You can't expect a person always to know what to do in that kind of situation.  His initial reaction was, in my opinion, patriotic.  By portraying an image of calm, he was showing respect for those who had just been brutally murdered.<br>  What else was he supposed to do?|`|xtrdlyJHaa	I wouldn't venture to guess. I have never been President of the United States under terrorist attack...the worst in history...do you presume to know what was going through his mind? <br>  <br>  All I do know is that his response was FLAWLESS and received a 90% approval rating from both parties...dems and reps afterwords...so whatever he did in those moments must have been a hell of a lot better than what O-blah-blah-blah does while he runs his mouth...maybe he could use a few moments of silence so he could stop and think and stop #$%ing up our future now.<br>  <br>  What did you want him to do? Spend a few trillion dollars in those moments like O-blah-blah?<br>  <br>  You guys are so superficial and pathetic...it is all about the appearance of being in control isn't it?|`|WCkOUF9aaa	I'm glad you asked that. I have always wondered what people like you thought he should have done. Crap his pants and run out of the room screaming?<br>  <br>  His actions did not cause any adverse effects. Only in your little Barbie dream world was his reaction not up to snuff.|`|NnUAXyCGaa	Yes, he was portraying an image of calm. Did you want him to jump up and scare he kids?  Did you expect him to jump into a fighter jet?|`|DB7UMkGCaa	"On 9/11, when George Bush did nothing for 7 minutes after being told about the 2nd plane,?"<br>  <br>  When the President moves around from place to place, ALOT of planning weeks ahead of time goes into all that movement. So when an attack like this happens, everything changes, and it kind of throws a monkey wrench into the previous plans. Bush had to wait for his people to do THEIR jobs in an emergency like this. He had to wait for secure phone lines to be set up, he had to wait for the Secret Service set up an alternate plan as to getting Bush out of there and somewhere else that wasnt on that days schedule, etc. The fact that it took them only 7 minutes to get everything done is a tribute to their efficency, no matter how you try to spin this as a negative against Bush.<br>  <br>  "Seriously, I agree with the one answer. Why not politely excuse himself instead of just sitting there?"<br>  <br>  Ok, then what? Those of you criticize Bush for those 7 minutes NEVER tell us what could have, should have, been done in those 7 minutes.|`|SS1VReF0aa	I think sometimes humans are humans and given the situation, he wanted to make the right decision. I sat staring at the TV in silence with my classmates watching what was unfolding...unable to even think what to say, let alone what to do. I think a majority of the people in the country would take longer than 7 minutes to decide what the proper course of action would be given the situation he faced.|`|BIQrsl4paa	Considering who his audience was at the time he was informed, I'd have to say he was projecting an image of calm. Only the loosest wrapped liberals think he was clueless and would have denounced him, no matter WHAT action he took. Ask yourself this. Would I have been happy had my kid been in that classroom if the President panicked and caused my kid and others to come to harm?<br>  If you can answer yes to that, you are an even bigger incompetent than you make President Bush out to be.|`|ovSkTNCoaa	O.K., what would you and lamplighter have done? Answer honestly. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE DONE. What did most of the democratic senators do when the second plane hit? According to an interview with John Kerry, who served in Vietnam, they were at a meeting when they received the news and sat immobile for 45 minutes.<br>  What was Pres. Bush supposed to do? He was in a class full of second graders. Seven minutes after the second plane hit, they were just figuring out that it was a terrorist attack. Was the secret service supposed to come rushing in and carry him off in front of those kids and scare them to death? Get a life.<br>  <br>  EDIT to John D:<br>  You really should listen to the audio on your link. Bush never said that he "watched it live" as is stated in your link. He said he saw the plane hit. So did I, as well as every American that had access to a television set. Footage of the first plane hitting the tower was shown numerous time prior to the second plane hitting. You Bush bashers don't even realize when your own link proves itself incorrect.|`|AL7FIEQmaa	It's to be happen, and no Bush, none could stop it. How Bush with his hands can stop airplanes in 7 min.?

And who cares?|`|4eLzY2hfaa	where could he go in in 7 minutes,  too much alex jones koolade will do that to your mind!
lWZi2p70aa	Kool-Aid is just a drink mixed from a powder that has a sweet taste with a trace of fruit flavor.  <br>  <br>  "Drinking the Kool-Aid" became a vogue expression when Jim Jones and his religious followers committed suicide en masse in Guyana, because they used poisoned Kool-Aid for their final libation.<br>  <br>  Just incidentally, those who want to shock with their coiffures first whiten their hair with peroxide then dye it with Kool-Aid as a temporary coloring, often only at the tips.|`|Z3FkGCuAaa	I think when political people mention Kool-aid, they're referring to the phrase "You're all in the Kool-aid but don't even know the flavor!" meaning involved in something they don't understand (Margrave may be onto something also, that's before my time so idk).<br>  <br>  Kool-aid is a powdered, sometimes sweetened, flavored drink mix that has added Vitamin C, comes in at least a dozen flavors I think and apparently is owned by Kraft. You can buy packets at most grocery stores (or online if you live somewhere very rural) probably right near the check-out lane (I guess they see it as an impulse purchase, maybe they're right, I haven't heard that the economy is hurting the Kool-aid company, considering how cheap it is to buy that makes sense) that are about an ounce and will flavor an entire half gallon to a gallon of water (you'll probably need to add sugar to it) for less than $0.50 or pre-sweetened containers of a pound or so for a couple of bucks (or a generic version at a $0.99 cent store). You've probably had Kool-aid or tasted something like it at some point, a lot of beverage companies make their own version, including Country Time Lemonade, the Crystal Lite On The Go packets, various semi-natural Iced Tea mixtures...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://brands.kraftfoods.com/koolaid/KoolSpace/" rel="nofollow">http://brands.kraftfoods.com/koolaid/Koo...</a><br>  Go see the kool-aid guy! lol|`|kAceP1pzaa	It is a term used when a "cult" of people voluntarily commit suicide by drinking kool-aid laced with a poison. <br>  <br>  You want some?

Then abortion would no longer be an issue. I don't think abortion should be completely illegal, but it should be a last resort in certain situations. There is NO excuse whatsoever, for the majority of people who have abortions just because they want to have sex with everyone they meet, and then don't want to accept the consequences of their actions.<br>  And for those of you libs who will undoubtedly turn this into a racial issue. I'm not talking about any particular race or ethnicity. I'm talking about ALL of the people in the world who KNOW they cannot afford to properly raise a child, but couldn't care less about anything except their immediate gratification from screwing everyone they meet. And those same people expect MY tax dollars to support them because of THEIR reckless irresponsibility.<br>  In cases like that abortion is not the answer, anymore than welfare is. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY is the answer. If people repeatedly have children who they cannot afford to properly care for, those children should be taken away from them, plain and simple.|`|6pdwd3PZaa	it would be more difficult for infertile couples.

Assuming 'unplanned' included married couples,  unmarried couples dedicated to a life together, and all subcategories, I would think there would be a MASSIVE decline in birthrates.  Since I have not researched the ratio between planned and unplanned pregnancies I cannot venture an accurate percentage.  However sources such as planned parenthood or vital statistics would probably have those percentages.  If I were to just take a guess, you would probably be looking at a 20 to 30% decrease in live birthrate.|`|Ku5EIzamaa	There would be no unplanned children.|`|oWih3AFOaa	Obama wouldn't be here to run America into the ground.

It is of, by and for the people that the government exists.  The Rohm Emanuals of the world had better lean that or the People will have to get Washington's collective mind right.<br>  <br>  This is not some banana republic.  The people will only take so much before they begin to push back.  If elections are seen as fixed, if representatives think they owe more to their respective political party than the voters that hired them, if the White House thinks it can dictate because they won an election, the public will push back.  If that happens, the American Military will side with the Constitution, not politicians.  Unlike Red China at Tienanmen Square, our military will not fire on American Civilians.  They swear allegiance to the American flag and the Republic for which it stands.  They are sworn to uphold the Constitution not any particular politician.  <br>  <br>  If it really comes down to it, Obama's birth certificate, passport information and schools records may play a big part.

yeu09pfOaa	we tried that once .... didn't go over very well .....|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Because making alcohol illegal caused many more problems than it solved.  For some strange reason, most people don't believe this same phenomenon applies to weed.|`|zftm6qkKaa	Or tobacco|`|yhTPcF81aa	Ever hear of Al Capone?  Last time Alcohol was made illegal, gangsters became ridiculously powerful.  Why dont you brush up on some history.  The gangsters selling illegal alcohol will be 100x more powerful and violent than a few potheads selling illegal weed.   We would create a million more problems than we would solve.|`|KcAehrrKaa	The government can make large profits off of it, whereas weed it's harder for them to  profit from.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Because prohibition was repealed.|`|BI1BciOFaa	Because alcohol has a metabolite of a few hours which is excreted as water.  Marijuana (THC is not water soluble) which stays in your system for up to 30 days...  therefore, if you smoke just today, you will still be technically high from the drug until it leaves your body.  THINK HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD BE CALLING in sick to work come MONDAY MORNING.... that's why it's illegal, plus it affects everyone differently.|`|ba53f32553b904b4453b17e5230bc19faa	taxes is the right answer.<br>  marijuana is smoked thats why its not popular in elections, thats my opinion <br>  if it had properties that acted like an erectical dysfunction cream<br>  they'd sell it at the gas station.|`|GMHERSExaa	Because alchohol can be taxed.

GrCj35muaa	How old are you? My dad didn't want me to visit mine in NC. I went anyway and it was great. If you are 18 I'd say screw your dad and go anyway. The thing is my dad took away my graduation present (my trunk) but I didn't give a damn. Now I'm moving down there when he gets home from deployment. You only live once, run your own life.|`|73MpAnCfaa	That's a tough one. I can see why your parents might say no, considering you'd be alone with him, right? I'm not saying your boyfriend is someone you need to be protected from or something stupid like that, but if I were you I'd just be good (good grades, help out around the house, no attitude), and maybe they'll change their minds. <br>  <br>  Odds are, you'll have to wait until you have more freedom. Don't worry, I totally know how you feel. My boyfriend (comes from a marine family) has totally psycho parents who don't let him out past 6 pm. <br>  <br>  It sucks, but it helps if the two of you just count your losses and think about another plan. Could he possibly visit YOU for a few hours?|`|IzH41QBnaa	listen to your parents thay are only trying to protect you... do they know this boy ...how well do they know him....sounds like they dont know him well enough to let there daughter go to where he is stationed ask your parents to go with you or ask your parents if it is ok to invite him to your home sounds like you have very good parents that are just trying to protect you|`|nx7QtF0paa	First of all, how old are you that you need to ask your parents?  As a former WM (woman marine) I'm going to say your folks made the right decision.  Where would you stay in a hotel?  Not in the barracks.  What would you do all day while he's at work?  How old is this Marine?|`|XzStbSPnaa	I always thought that No means No. What part about that don't you seem to get? ITS SIMPLE ,  They said NO !|`|R3TzcZu8aa	How are we supposed to convince him on here for you?  <br>  <br>  Listen, if you can not convince him, so be it.  I personally would not allow my future daughter one day to go to Louisiana to a military installation while she was still in High School.  I live in Camp Lejuene and while there are thousands of responsible, respectful Marines, your father is right in not letting you run off to a base to see him.  It is not safe for a young lady.  Too much can go wrong with too many guys around.
fgIbNRHfaa	Haven't a clue.  But if you were caught shoplifting, and are being asked to pay $75 in lieu of criminal charges, I would thank my lucky stars and pay the $75 quickly and without complaint.  And next time, if you can't afford the items, leave them on the shelf.
6Fsliwlhaa	Joining the Army will allow you to apply for expidited citizenship and waives application fees.  But you still have to meet all of the other requirements for your application.  Also, you have to be a Permanent Resident that currently lives in the US to join. <br>  <br>  The military is doing a trial where they are allowing up to 1000 immigrants who are legally in the US right now to join this year if they have critical skills the military needs (medical, critical languages like Arabic) but other than that you can't come in without a green card.|`|a4306cf4648141da0d25ebc2a0dbf89caa	No.  Military service does not automatically make you a citizen.  In fact, if you are NOT a US citizen, you can only serve in the US military for a certain amount of time; I think it's 6 years, but I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  But no, joining the US military does not grant you citizenship.|`|haR4lEhlaa	If you're in France, yes. It's called the French Foreign legion. If you're in the United States, no. For more info see this article that appeared in last weekend's NY Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/us/15immig.html?partner=rss&pagewanted=all" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/us/15i...</a>|`|AA11401709	Yes. If you are a green card holder, now you can apply for citizenship on the first day of active duty and receive the citizenship within 6 months (that's what a friend who's interested in the service told me).|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	You have to have a green card to join the military. But being in the military does accelerate the citizenship process.|`|7PGxqRfZaa	No. Military service will not make you a citizen on the spot, but it will help with it on the road to becoming on. When I was in Iraq there were a couple of nationalization  services for the troops that did become citizens while serving. Good luck on becoming a citizen and with the Army.
dIxATqQoaa	I am from California ($42 billion budget deficit California).  Republican Governor Arnold is even panhandling other Republican governors for their share of the stimulus they might refuse, because California needs every $ any way we can get it.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  Are the Republicans trying to sabotage the efforts of the President?  Well maybe but the two states that refused the loudest are South Carolina and Louisiana and those two states have governors that may be front runners for the Republican nomination for the 2012 Presidential Election.  <br>  <br>  I believe it is political points more than anything else.|`|uIAHkm0Naa	i live in georgia and sonny perdue (gov) said he isnt going to accept all of it and i dont blame him..|`|f9crUDTwaa	My governor , a republican , isn't so stupid as to turn down the money .|`|AA11163314	Sadly, my govrenor has stated that he will accept the money - even if doing so will screw things up even worse in the long run.<br>  <br>  I agree that governors should 'cherry pick' the spending bill for things that will not cause budget problems about 4-5 years down the road.|`|dJnRFpWWaa	I have no idea. But I think that my state government should raise the same amount it receives from the stimulus bill and spend it on state projects and initiatives. It could raise the money by eliminating exemptions and or exemptions and other deductions. <br>  <br>  If spending money is the cure, then the states shouldn't shirk their responsibility. They should step up to the plate and increase taxes selectively, or adopt an emergency surtax, and spend the money on projects and initiatives that will help turn our national economy around.<br>  <br>  That's what I think!|`|BVaCJkxzaa	Our Governor will likely turn down portions of if that have strings attached that require us to increase spending our own states monies. Our State has billions of dollars in reserves and like everyone else could find a use for the money we would rather have a savings to draw from when things get tough. Things are still very good here and we don't need to be beholding to Obama for his handouts.|`|pujaTNEgaa	I don't know, they didn't announce it.<br>  <br>  Most likely they'll pick it up in my state, especially the area where i live.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Mine definitely will.

You also get no choice in what you are going to eat, when you are going to sleep, or even what you are going to do with your day.  You will probably be assigned chores with no choice.

No. The great thing about freedom of speech is that I don't have to listen to him if I don't want to.

yhTPcF81aa	I believe any politician should be elected based on policies.  Clinton had terrible virtues (he cheated on his wife) and yet he had great policies.  George Washington was a terrible man also  (constantly cheated on his wife) and yet he was a great president.  Nearly everyone who has met him says that George Bush is a very good guy.  Im sure he is.  But he has terrible policies. <br>  <br>  And yes, i do believe Obama would be elected under a policy-only system.  The conservative policies that McCain proposed were nearly exactly the same as Bush's (the ones he himslef opposed months earlier).  I feel Obama's policies were better.  <br>  <br>  Oh there are many flaws in this system.  For one, most policies take months or even years to push forward and take effect.  Obama got lucky that he was able to pass his economic policies so fast.

JDltTREfaa	It's not exactly suing for divorce.  The other person filed for divorce but the case is apparently still open so s/he hasn't voluntarily dismissed the matter, is that right?  The best bet would be to hire an attorney in the jurisdiction where the divorce has been filed and instruct the attorney to proceed on the case.|`|AA11043457	If the person dropped the suit and it is no longer on the docket, then it may be over and  you just file suit.<br>  <br>  If the suit is still open you can counter sue for divorce so you would be awarded the divorce if you win.  If person left, that could be desertion unless you were abusive and in that case it might not be desertion.<br>  <br>  So how is he person having financial benefit of the marriage.  If there was no suit, then you are not paying his/her expenses are you?  Unless it was legal separation and not divorce.<br>  <br>  See your attorney. You can sue for divorce whether or not the person dropped the original suit.  If the suit is still active you can counter sue for divorce.<br>  <br>  You will need an attorney whether you sue or counter sue so check it out.  I trust you didn't miss any court dates.  <br>  <br>  If this is a long-term marriage, there might still be alimony or a separation of property and if there are children, there will be child support.<br>  <br>  This is not a legal opinion.|`|fgIbNRHfaa	This is a matter of state law, but generally the answer is YES.

Z9jtdw17aa	I am the mother of an adopted child.  I'm thankful every day that his mother chose birth.<br>  <br>  However, I would not for one second impose my will on her or anyone else.<br>  <br>  One of the other posters said, "Do some research." That poster said that people are lined up to adopt.  I've DONE a bit of research on this, and she is only partly correct.  People are lined up to adopt mostly white, healthy infants.  They are not lining up to adopt children with drug dependency at birth, with fetal alcohol syndrome, with physical or mental limitations.  They are not generally lined up to adopt children of mixed ethnicity.  Black children are adopted less frequently than white children in the US, although that trend has leveled off, and cross-cultural adoptions are more common now.  <br>  <br>  My child didn't become available for adoption until he was 15 months old.  The agency almost wrote him off as "unadoptable" because he was no longer an infant.  However, much to our delight, they thought we might be willing to take him, and we were delighted to do so.  Many other children like him languish for years because they missed that cuddly little blank slate stage.  Families are NOT lining up to adopt preteens, and they generally run screaming from teens who are in need of adoption.<br>  <br>  Many of the children whose mothers give birth are not made available at birth, but suffer from years of neglect and even abuse before they are removed from the home.  Then the state has the stated goal of reuniting them with their birth families as long as the mothers express an interest in getting the children back.  Circumstances have to be horrible for these children to be released for adoption, and then they face the prospect of being rejected or ignored by adoptive parents until they finally turn 18 and are emancipated from the system.  <br>  <br>  Some of these "pro-lifers" are only pro-fetus.  The lives of these children who are not "perfect" in their very limited definition of the word are harsh and often unsupported by all the busy bodies who insisted that their mother couldn't make the choices best for her family.  <br>  <br>  The comment about increased taxes is exactly on point.  People who think they have some right to interfere in the family of another are NOT standing in line to help some woman who accidentally conceived learn the parenting skills, job skills and social skills she will need to raise healthy children.  How can one be "pro life" and not want to spend the money to care for children who are actually born?  Because it is "someone else's problem."  It's nothing more than hypocrisy.|`|WmZqykz1aa	Abortion is NEVER an easy choice.<br>  <br>  If a woman has the child, she may be dooming herself and any future children to live in poverty because she was unable to finish her education.<br>  <br>  If she has the child, it may remind her daily of a man she hated, or who hated her, and her parenting of that child might very likely suffer, raising a child who knows he wasn't wanted and isn't loved, and who eventually might become a burden or worse a hazard to the society that insisted he be born against his mother's wishes.<br>  <br>  If she chooses to give birth and put the child up for adoption, she may die in child birth.  She will have scars and consequences to her body as a result of the pregnancy, and her life will not simply "go back to normal."<br>  <br>  If she chooses adoption, she will be haunted by stories of children who are mistreated by their adoptive parents.  She may also learn that boys who are given up for adoption frequently grow up resenting their birth mothers in particular and women in general, and she may be condemning the child to a lifetime of wondering why he or she wasn't "good enough" so that the mother gave him or her away.<br>  <br>  If she has the abortion, she will be faced with possible physical complications, with guilt, and with the condemnation of a sizable chunk of society who would not be around to offer her any comfort or assistance if she chooses to keep the baby.<br>  <br>  A child's life may or may not begin at conception, but society's obligation to that child does not end when the child passes through the birth canal.  The same people who rant against abortion also condemn mothers who are struggling to feed, house and raise their children, tisk-tisking that they were so irresponsible as to give birth to more children than they could possibly handle.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, only the person who has to bear the consequences of the choice is in the position to make the choice.  None of the options are good in an unwanted pregnancy, but the final choice should be ONLY the choice of the woman, not some busy body preacher or self-righteous politician.  The people who have not chosen to adopt are hypocrites when they attempt to force anyone else to bare a child she can not care for.<br>  <br>  No, I don't like that a potential child has been lost.  But I like less that actual children are suffering as a result of too few options being available to their mothers.|`|g9l8ed4qaa	"Everyone wants to regulate someone else's uterus....but don't think for a minute that all of these people who are pro-life would be willing to adopt and to foster and to increase their taxes two-fold to care for the millions of unwanted pregnancies and children that would be born if they had their way. They are pro-fetus, NOT pro-life. At age 5 minutes...it is YOUR responsibility, not theirs."<br>  <br>  Do some Research. There are people waiting in line to adopt new infants. The reason the foster care system is so full is because...well to put it in the words of the social worker who is helping get out home ready for foster adopt..."these kids have been so abused that it they tend to be the ones who grow up tp be Charles Manson."|`|KLg658F3aa	No.<br>  Abortion is acceptable if the child is not wanted, it is a mass of tissue. If the child is wanted then abortion is not acceptable because it's a baby. If the mother uses drugs while pregnant she can be fined and possibly jailed for harming the unborn child. However if she decides to abort the child than the drug charges will be dropped. The unborn child's DNA differs from that of the mother so it is a separate human being. The father should have a say in the matter (rights). the unborn child should have a say (rights).<br>  Your pro-choice according to my interpretation of your stance on the issue. What if you abort a female child and she never gets to debate any issue like your able to what then? What if your mother had aborted you? If you were raped, then decided to kill the unborn child as tho it has no rights at all. That child never asked to be conceived, he/she is a victim of some unpleasant circumstances. Abortion is interrupting the will of God.<br>  If a person believes in evolution, then I can understand the motives that are used to justify abortion. On the other hand if a person believes we have been created by God, then we will have to answer for our sins some day and do you want blood on your hands?<br>  <br>  If you feel the child has no rights then all of what you say is correct. I just believe after conception, that person has rights and someone needs to stand up for that person.|`|ofd2upYSaa	a woman doesn't have a choice once she's pregnant (or she shouldn't at least)  She made her choice to sleep with a guy so that is the consequence. It's not just "the woman's body" after she's pregnant.  she has a living baby in her that she is supposed to take care of.  Rape isn't an excuse to have an abortion either.  No matter what lame excuses you come up with, abortion is murder and should be against the law.<br>  <br>  And yes, I do realize that all woman don't plan on being raped. I never said that, did i? I didn't think so.<br>  <br>  Also, I would find myself saying that rape isn't an excuse to have an abortion because I, along with many other women, know that it is MURDER. Why can't you grasp that?  If I really felt like I couldn't handle raising a rapist's child, i would give it up for adoption and make someone happy who can't have their own baby.  I don't plan on going to hell for murdering my helpless child, thank you.<br>  <br>  Murder is wrong. I hope you will understand that one day.|`|ZhBo2NsRaa	Abortion should be allowed for people who are raped or something horrible as that. For the other women who keep having sex and find themselves pregnant, they should know better than that. If one doesn't want a baby and want to have sex constantly, she should just get sterilized instead of wasting time getting an abortion.|`|AVc1PCu5aa	It's not the woman's body.

They are pro-fetus, NOT pro-life. At age 5 minutes...it is YOUR responsibility, not theirs.|`|58TDAT1zaa	Yes a woman's body is involved, but hers is not the only body involved.  From the moment of conception, unless action is taken to kill the child, there is a life growing inside of her.  That means that now there are TWO bodies to deal with.  That also means the "It's my body, and I'll do what I want with it." argument goes out the window.  For someone that actually used birth control the right way, and did not cut corners while still getting pregnant there is always a better word, adoption.  The waiting list for people to have a child in some cases is as long as two years.  Why not turn what could have been an emotional trying time into a joyous event for someone that is already prepared for it.  <br>       <br>       You must also realize that nobody in here would have the ability to debate this moral issue if their mom had made the foolish choice of killing their own kid.  Only the Spartans were that cold blooded with their offspring.|`|SS1VReF0aa	Rape and "other circumstances" account for a small fraction of abortions. Less than 5%...depending on the study/research you reference.<br>  <br>  Choice ends at conception...the choice was to have sex, the conception of a child is a result of that choice and you lose your right to choose at that moment.|`|U1pMvDvgaa	Most abortions are simply a method for irresponsible people to avoid responsibility for bad decisions, a baby must die so the mother is not inconvenienced, this is truly evil.|`|8pt0fYPOaa	Kate - women who against abortion, do not see a growing, living, human being that is growing in their womb, as a part of themselves or a blob of tissue - they see it as a completely unique human being - the only thing this child is attached to the woman, is the umbillical cord, and that is something that you and I also have, it was cut, and became our belly button...<br>  <br>  I can empathize with you, on the grounds of rape - however, I would like to share with you some facts; pregnancy from rape is very rare - in a study done by the Air Force years ago, it said that a pregnancy occurs 1 in 30,000 rapes - why? because during an attack, most women experience a surge of adrenalin that blocks the possibility of pregnancy; a woman has to be in her fertile cycle, and - there is treatment if a woman is seen right away that aids in the process of not getting pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Then, there is the reality - a woman is severely traumatized - her own body, violated - this enough to harm her psyche in the first place.  Women who chose abortion in these cases far much worse than those who chose life.  Because in an abortion, the woman now chooses an act of violence upon another human being- and herself, is then victimized.<br>  <br>  Is it easy to carry a child to term when you have been raped? absolutely not. But consider, the child within her womb, is not his, but hers - and for most females, the idea of aborting a child, is unthinkable.  There are several women who come forward to tell of their stories of how they survived, not only rape, but bringing the child to term.  I would recommend you taking the time to hear one of these valiant women, who chose life.  They are amazing.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, let us educate women that if they should suffer an sexual assault, to go immediately for treatment - We have to remember, that she and the child have done nothing wrong, and so neither of them should have to endure the execution of an innocent life.  They need our support, love and understanding- and the rapist, needs to be brought to justice.

FR5ttYfFaa	OK, yeah this argument gets asked quite a lot, "If gay marriage should be legal, then why can't we make polygamy legal? In fact, if gay marriage is legal, then people will soon be able to marry animals! (for example)"<br>  <br>  The thing is, polygamy causes problems. This is why it was done away with (legally) to begin with. The rights and benefits of marriage are designed for 2 people. Since men and women are treated equally under the law, 2 men or 2 women are seen as the same as one man and one woman in the governments eyes.<br>  <br>  ALSO, just for the record, no people won't be able to marry animals. I mean, animals cannot even consent to marriages. They cannot even sign a marriage certificate.<br>  <br>  BUT, let's entertain the thought for a minute that all those kinds of crazy marriage would happen. Would gay marriage NEED to be legal before those other ones? Why, if people want to marry animals, and make polygamy legal, and they fight badly enough to where it actually becomes legal, then I think it would happen whether or not gay marriage was legal first. It has nothing to do with it.<br>  <br>  It's called the psychology of fear. It's used to control people. It puts [unnecessary] fear into people's minds, so they can be on a certain side, "OH! Well I don't want people to start marrying ANIMALS! I have to be against gay marriage!"<br>  <br>  EDIT: Marrying robots huh? OK, still, if someone really wants to marry a robot, why does that have to do with gay marriage? If someone REALLY wants to marry a robot, then they would fight for that right whether or not gay marriage was legalized first. Has nothing to do with it.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	There are many rational people who can't understand why gays don't have equal rights to marriage. It hurts no one. It gives them much joy.

I've included a link to the story on Yahoo news. (And for those of you who may or may not want to criticize my source, this, as most other stories on yahoo news, come from Reuters News) Obama WILL raise taxes on those who make over $250,000.00 per year from 35% to over 39%. That is only 11% away from the government taking HALF of your money. <br>  Look at the article. In the section that refers to "BUSH TAX CUTS", it states,"He said Obama would let tax cuts implemented by his predecessor George W. Bush for Americans earning more than $250,000 expire on schedule at the end of 2010, when the tax rate would rise from 35 percent to more than 39 percent."<br>  If you think there are no jobs in this country now, wait until the Obama administration takes nearly half of someone's earnings just because they are successful. Business WILL suffer much worse under Obama's administration than they ever did before. And this time it WILL be the government's fault, not the greedy corporate leaders.<br>  Also: Where do you think the nearly 800 BILLION dollars is going to come from to pay for this stimulus package? I hate to tell you, but as they say, "Money does not grow on trees." The TAXPAYERS will have to pay for this. Of course you libs tend to ignore such basic facts.<br>  This attitude of "spend spend spend, even of we don't have the money" is what has gotten this country into this mess in the first place.|`|JT4OkvFeaa	Going to raise them I think on the super rich.  <br>  <br>  Who cares?

Or you just assume everyone hasn't? Why not google evidence against loose change? Or is that just something you don't do? Don't need to research all sides?<br>  <br>  How about googling "how to levitate"?<br>  <br>  Google WTC7, for & against demolition theory. <br>  <br>  Even after Oklahoma bombing in 90s there were alternative theories how the building was brought down. Why aren't you up in arms about Oklahoma bombing?<br>  <br>  "Heard explosives" is the key. I once saw news report where a person compared car crashing into their house to sound of "bomb" going off. "Heard explosives" doesn't mean a thing other then loud noise.<br>  <br>  <br>  Heres something to think about; <br>  <br>  So let say there was demolition at WTC. Bomb goes off. Then what? In control demolition explosions sweep the building at once and immediately the building collapse. You don't ******* see bombs go off in interval here and there by several minutes and then building stand for several minute defying gravity and comes down. You don't definitely see charges go off during collapse as it is claimed. All charges go off at once and then collapse. Not boom here, boom there, boom over there, wait, wait, wait several more minutes, more fire and building collapse. That makes less sense. <br>  <br>  Conclusion? If it was indeed the bomb which probably wasn't, it is not the main cause of collapse. And who actually saw bomb blast? Who? Everybody "heard" it. Wheres the common sense?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So demolition theory sounds like this; <br>  <br>  Theres some thermite melting steele; who knows where? <br>  Bombs go off in intervals at several odd places at base<br>  Bombs designed for demolition go off, but the building stands strong for several minutes. <br>  Building comes down due to thermite melting steele, few bombs unevenly distributed through out the building, and plane crash & fire.|`|1IyzZTpjaa	Some people prefer to keep their blinders on.

y0MnsQRNaa	Nuclear power, I believe is the best, safest, most reliable, current technology to provide energy. The plants operating now are safe and the new designs are even safer.<br>  Building 100's of new nuclear power plants would improve the economy, reduce or eliminate dependence on foreign oil, create jobs, reduce pollution, and provide for future technological advancement. <br>  I have been working with nuclear power for about 30 years, I would be glad to have a Nuclear power plant or high level waste disposal facility in my backyard. My family and I live in a home within 10 miles of a nuclear power plant. (where I work) I have a great understanding of the risks involved and am completely comfortable with a plant "in my backyard". I have confidence that my grandchildren’s grandchildren will be smart enough to treat the nuclear "waste" as a valuable resource or at least smart enough to handle it safely . If the cavemen thought their children would be too stupid to use fire safely, where would we be now? <br>  Using Chernobyl as a reason not to build is like saying because of the Hindenburg I will never fly in a commercial airliner.<br>  Nuclear power has the smallest environmental impact of any current energy production method per unit of energy produced. One fuel pellet about the size of a pencil eraser produces the same energy as about 1 ton of coal, and if reprocessed 2/3 of what's left can be reclaimed. Nuclear power is our best option for reliable, environmentally friendly base-load electrical power.<br>  Completly reasonable and totally worth it! Check out the links!|`|DAsQ4UZ8aa	Reasonable and worth it. If I am correct the French enjoy 40% of their power from uranium.  If the government contractors in the US were not so damned corrupt, we could build safe effecient nuclear power plants, but Morton Thiokol proves that the only thing that matters to big business is how cheap you can make something.  They toasted 7 american heroes and were never held accountable.|`|HQoGiaPFaa	It's our only real option as a base load power source other than fossil fuels.<br>  <br>  A base load power source need to be both constant and controllable. Most alternative forms of energy are controllable, but far from constant. They are suitable for relieving peak loads, but not as a base source of power.<br>  <br>  Solar power - what happens when it's cloudy? Do we just have rolling brown outs?<br>  <br>  Wind power - What happens when the wind dies at night?<br>  <br>  Hydropower- pretty much tapped out<br>  <br>  Geothermal - highly dependent on location<br>  <br>  Nuke is really the only option other than fossil fuels at this time.|`|NQYKzv7faa	It costs one tenth as much as wind generated power.  It is safer too.<br>  <br>  Wind power injures a lot of workers and massive ice shears have hurt 28 people.

It is our most promising alternative energy source.|`|nTzTIrataa	Totally worth it.  The French get over 75% of their electricity from nuclear, and have an outstanding program.<br>  <br>  Their reactors are very much standardized, reducing construction, training, and maintenance costs.  Ours have been largely "one of a kind", a very inefficient and costly way to go.<br>  <br>  We have to stop sending $400 billion a year out of the country to buy foreign oil, and we have to reduce emissions.  Nuclear will help to do that.|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	The major problem with nuclear energy is that we have no disposal sites.  Where do we deposit the spent fuel rods?<br>  <br>  Yucca Mountain, Nevada, is the current site of choice, and it was supposed to be opened in the late 1990s.  But it’s nowhere near to being opened.  There are seismic issues and transportation issues.  The people of Nevada don’t want their state to “host” a nuclear waste disposal site and nobody wants the highly radioactive wastes transported through or even near their towns, cities and states.<br>  <br>  Our reactor sites are running out of space to store their spent nuclear fuel rods. If, at some point, they cannot be removed, we will need to shut them down|`|WCkOUF9aaa	I think Libs are scared of it even though its being used safely around the world,<br>  <br>  I also think its irresponsible for the current administration to dismiss it like it has. Plus they dont think we should drill for oil here. They want to shut down the coal mines. WTF are we going to use for fuel?|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	It's reasonable as a stop-gap until we can figure out something better. France does a remarkable job of maintaining their power plants, and we could do the same.|`|q3Vo1s2caa	Totally reasonable and totally worth it. Google France and Japan - they get the great majority of all their electric from nuclear. And to the comments about the waste "problem" - this is a totally fear created issue. Keep the spent fuel rods in holding pool (water) for 100 days and then encase in concrete and bury it back in the ground. It was radioactive when we dug it up and its no more radioactive after 200 days to put it back.|`|rWdYBmPmaa	It is worth it. It not only hires about 40,000 people to build it but then they need people to run and maintain it.<br>  <br>  The dems want rechargeable cars. Where is that power coming from, we already have brown outs in the summer from the Ac's so how does obama want us to charge our cars. He can use natural gas, just put a hose up his a*ss and do what he does.<br>  <br>  After all the dems want us off foreign oil, and right now that looks like the only way, unless we put like 1,000 D size batteries in our cars to run them.|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	Totally worth it. The safety argument is misleading.

AA11564497	Not even close.<br>  <br>  A plan that does not promote investment and growth through tax incentives is bound to fail (Also, tax credits are welfare payments, not a tax incentive, so let's call it what it is.).  <br>  <br>  The whole Dem concept of "trickle up" economics is absolutely ludicrous and reveals how unbelievably clueless they really are regarding "real world" economics.  Why not just tell everyone that it rains from the ground to the sky.  I guess they figure if they say it enough, some uninformed idiots might actually believe that to be the case.  Pretty sad testimony about the level of knowledge possessed by the American electorate, you think.  After all, over 50% of the people actually voted for rubbish like this.  That gives me no confidence as to the future course of this country..<br>  <br>  The current bill is an injustice to America and politicians who voted for it in its present form should all be voted out of office (unfortunately, not soon enough).  In the old days, a stoning may have been in order for these misguided fools.<br>  <br>  They are digging us into a deeper hole.|`|1Fg7Tybvaa	No I do not think that Obama's plan will work. During the Great Depression FDR knew that it was important to get Americans back to work, he ordered all illegal immigrants be picked up and deported. Eisenhower did the same thing in 1952 at the end of the Korean war as the economy was again starting to fall (google "operation wet--back, without the dashes)<br>  <br>  I looked at where all of this money was going, unfortunately  the web page at <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/" rel="nofollow">http://www.recovery.gov/</a>  has a lot of things that are lumped into areas to make it appear to be a good plan. As one example it is impossible for us to see that hidden in that stimulus package is $400 million for new cars for the government.<br>  <br>  During the Presidential campaigns McCain told us that Obama has a $850 billion spending plan, this is exactly what the stimulus package looks like to me because it does not contain enough benefits for the American people.<br>  <br>  We are going to be left with a huge national debt and I fear that our country will be left bankrupt.|`|LCA7gdoiaa	What Plan?   Oh. the plan to print valueless currency, create expensive short term WORK not jobs, then expect the states to fund any ongoing employment or project.

2KNzw0Rbaa	No, but the national debt would be much smaller, giving the country a little more leeway to deal with the situation properly rather than the fiasco that the government has presented us with.<br>  The current economic conditions would have happened war or no war.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	Do you think we just randomly start wars?|`|i0vcEyJtaa	I don't think it would be that bad as it would be now. We would be in a minor recession, and our national debt would be very small than it is now. Also, inflation would be stable, and the Dollar would still be some what stronger than it is right now. So yes, wars do have an effect on the economy, multiple economists argued that if we weren't fighting two wars, we would be a little stronger, economically speaking.

i0vcEyJtaa	I strongly agree! I am in fact a republican, but I'm also getting really tired with the mess both parties create. Democrats promise change, but they later betray us. And my fellow republicans later promote other change, yet they don't accomplish much. So introducing more parties would in fact balance the power, and invite other ideals to swamp the political arena. The Libertarians have a great voting record for defending civil liberties, constitutionalists vote against wars and high taxes, while independents offer real change, their voting record say it all. I am a republican, it won't be until I switch Libertarian, a lot of disgruntles conservatives have jumped ship to the LP, and I agree with them on social, economic policy.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	We need a new party but not a blend of the other 2, that would just be more of the same BS!<br>  <br>  We need new ideas not the same old ones compromised into nothingness|`|mZi7R0Enaa	No but I do think we would be better off with 2 Presidents, one for internal affairs and one for international affairs!|`|f4Yec6iNaa	I think the Libertarian party blends the ideals of the two parties the best.

Most feel that voting for the 'other' major party is revolt, but have not realized that with just the two in office nothing will really ever change. <br>  How many times have you heard "I don't like either candidate but I don't want to waste my vote on (insert third party candidate here)"? All it would take is for just one in three to vote that way and things will change. And not just in the presidential elections, but the congressional, senatorial and state elections also. <br>  If just 10% of both houses of congress were third party or independent thing would be dramatically different in the dynamics of our government.<br>  Just look what happened when Perot received just about 20% of the vote in the early nineties. Scared the waste excrement out of them. We may never see a 'third party' candidate get invited to a debate again. Remember, the two major parties set the rules for presidential debates.

Good luck and never trust the government.|`|5pioWG30aa	March 2003, the 173rd Airborne Brigade did a combat jump into Northern Iraq to capture and hold an airfield.  This was done because Turkey wouldn't allow US ground forces to enter Iraq from their country. It was on CNN, they showed the troops doing the jump at night.|`|N4u9DRvFaa	This is from military.com:<br>  <br>  26 March 2003 is your answer and the 173rd did the deed.<br>  <br>  Airborne Operations - Recent<br>  Airborne Operations in the 21st Century<br>  The 75th Ranger Regiment’s parachute assault on 19 October 2001 onto Objective Rhino at Dry Lake Airstrip in southern Afghanistan began US ground combat operations in the war on terrorism. It was the first mass tactical combat parachute drop since the 75th and the 82nd Airborne Division jumped into Panama during Operation Just Cause in December 1989. PSYOP Soldiers parachuted with approximately 200 Rangers into Afghanistan to operate portable loudspeaker equipment designed for broadcasting surrender messages to opposition forces.<br>  <br>  During the opening days of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 82nd's paratroopers had planned to conduct an airborne assault, and the units had begun to rig their equipment and vehicles for a heavy drop. However, on 26 March 2003, V Corps ordered the division to As Samawah. The 82nd also was told that it would be reinforced with TF 1-41 IN, a mechanized infantry unit originally from the 1st AD but currently located at Tallil Air Base, and a lift helicopter company, A/9-101 of the 159 Aviation Brigade, from the 101st Airborne Division.164 This would give the brigade greater combat capability and mobility for the projected fight in and around As Samawah. The paratroopers derigged their equipment in record time and departed Camp CHAMPION on 27 March 2003.<br>  <br>  On March 26, 2003, the 173rd Airborne Brigade conducted a jump into Northern Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the largest airborne assault since D-Day. Soldiers landed in the Bashur Drop zone effectively opening a northern front in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Kurdish controlled area was expected to be friendly, little resistance was anticipated, and none was encountered. The 173rd’s jump into Northern Iraqi was the first wave of conventional American forces into the area. However, the weather was bad when the planes took off for the jump and the weather continued to be bad hours out from the jump as the C-17s approached the jump site. But the team knew that calling the mission off wasn’t an option. More than 1,000 soldiers of the 173rd Airborne Brigade loaded up onto C-17 jets lining the Aviano Air Base runway. The weather called for a pitch-black night, with no moon or stars and there was going to be fresh mud on the drop zone from the heavy storms in the prior weeks. Because they were in hostile air and because the drop zone was nestled in a valley, the C-17’s had to go into an intense, steep dive from 30,000 feet to 600 feet. The unit remained in Iraq until February 2004. <br>  <br>  The actions of the brigade caused the Iraqi defenses to commit forces to the area making it safer for swift progress to Baghdad by other US forces. In early 2004 the March 26, 2003 jump was classified as a combat jump, and the paratroopers who participated in it can stick their chests out with pride showing off the gold star, or “mustard stain,” that crowns their parachutist wings.|`|pFlmFv2Waa	THe last time the U.S. army parashuted was probably in 2003 in their quest to take  Mosul in northern Iraq during Operation IRaqi Freedom|`|mr8isJoZaa	The jump in 2003 didn't even really count, the field was already taken when they jumped, how can you actually accept that as a combat jump.|`|MOYZCFKyaa	82nd Airborne in Panama in the 1989.|`|ApZ0qS88aa	I believe elements of the 101st Airborne Division completed at least one combat jump during the invasion of Iraq in 2003.<br>  <br>  Scratch that it was the 173rd ABCT on March 26th 2003 as part of Operation Northern Delay at Bashur Air Field, Iraq.<br>  <br>  One month earlier 70 paratroopers from B Company, 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne jumped into Western Afghanistan along with A Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment.

CfjxKLHDaa	From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>  <br>  The separation of church and state is a legal and political principle derived from the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which reads, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . ." The phrase "separation of church and state" is generally traced to an 1802 letter by Thomas Jefferson to the Danbury Baptists, where Jefferson spoke of the combined effect of the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. It has since been quoted in several opinions handed down by the United States Supreme Court.|`|8pt0fYPOaa	A] Separation of church and state is NOT in the constitution.

That phrase comes from a letter written years after the Constitution was ratified by Thomas Jefferson.)<br>  <br>  I would imagine that the people opposed to homosexual marriage are quoting the Bible because the Bible says that homosexuality is a sin, and that marriage is a holy and sacred union between a man and a woman.<br>  <br>  And they're winning because lots of people feel the same way.|`|e380b6c435d028a856da0ab58ab394f2aa	Your anus was not designed to be a 2 way chute.<br>  Even libs know that.

f931be7e45f5d51817c8a31a462b08d4aa	No, you would not be discharged.  I strongly recommend that you let that be known at MEPS.  Or at least tell your recruit division commander (RDC) as soon as you get to great lakes and report.  Reason being, your wife is not entitled to medical/dental benefits until you have her input in the DEERS system, which can't be done until provide documentation (your marriage certificate) to show that you are married.

Eight makers submitted a sample lot of 30 pistols by the deadline of January of 1984, and by August of the same year the testing was completed. (NSIAD-88-46) Of the eight makers who submitted test samples, 4 were technically unacceptable and 2 removed themselves from competition. The two surviving companies were SACO (importing Sig-Sauer pistols at the time) and Beretta. (NSIAD-88-46) After a controversial bidding process (some allege Beretta was tipped off about SACO’s bid so they could lower the per unit cost on their candidate by $1.00 and win the contract) the Army signed a contract with Beretta for 315,930 pistols. This number was later increased to 321,260 pistols. The new pistols would bear the military name of M9.

iuoB7pf0aa	Well, I sure didn't vote for Obama. And yes, you're right.. obama is a muslim and he's not a natural born american citizen. <br>  <br>  www.obamacrimes.com<br>  <br>  I'll tell you the REAL reason I actually got from someone when I asked them why they voted for obama, and you know what the answer was? <br>  "I voted for him because he's black." <br>  That's MORE racist that someone not voting for him because of his color. <br>  <br>  Many of these people don't even CARE what obama's policies are, they wouldn't agree with what he's doing but they voted for him because of his color and that's the ONLY reason they voted for him. He's pro abortion, he's proved that and he's using YOUR money and MY money to pay for all of those abortions. What a crock, that really pisses me off. I'm totally anti abortion and it's not his place to spend my money bloody murder. There's not enough time for me to sit her and tell you everything wrong with obama... he's a liar and an idiot and Idon't care WHO gets offended.<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  <br>  Willow will get a smack of reality in time. Her messiah is a socialist who is taking the same exact steps that hitler took, and obama does plan to put us all in concentration camps. Willow, grow up and learn the facts. Obama is a nothing, a piece of sh*t on the bottom of your shoes.|`|f598d30e60d0a8ecbb5bd782a442def6aa	I didn't vote for Obama or McCain. But how many politicians do you think are really pro-life? How many have actually tried to pass pro-life legislation? There aren't many. Abortion (for both sides) is merely a platform to get votes, if that's the only reason you voted McCain then you've severely deluded yourself.|`|0cee90c25888a78a0b401efe2b753fd3aa	And also he is Muslim his dad was Muslim his mom was Muslim therefor HE is Muslim. <br>  <br>  <br>  remarks like that make it seem like there should be a test that must be passed before a person can vote.

Who I voted for, or whether I support choice or WHAT? What does race or religion have to do with anything in your question? And while I am at it... What is your position on sex education in schools and schools providing free contraceptives to teenagers? I dislike the idea of abortion, intensely. However, I am NOT about to legislate against it. I see a pregnant woman as no different than any other minority, and legislating to discriminate is WRONG. I was married. I got divorced. Unknown to me, my soon to be ex-wife elected to have an abortion. This happened a couple of months BEFORE we decided on divorce by the way. I only found out she had the procedure because the person who was supposed to give her a ride home bailed out and she was forced to call ME, otherwise I would never have even known. I am against abortion, because I had no say-so, no input in her decision. Later, months after the divorce, I found out she had been involved in an affair. What tipped me off was where she went after the divorce, and then looking over old phone bills and finally simply calling one odd number revealed the other man that was involved and the time frame. Ironically, for many months before he was transferred to another state, we had been very good friends. Still, even with ALL of that, I am FOR a woman to have the choice. I will vote against any legislation which limits rights of any kind for any group or individual. The freedom to choose outweighs my personal issues and objections to abortion. By the way, I will not tell you I voted for as that is moot, but I will say this: If you are not happy with the President, don't blame me, I didn't vote for the guy. My reason for NOT voting for Obama is his relative lack of experience. In my circle of friends, I know of NO ONE who voted for Obama... At least no one who admits to doing so... You are the victim of the urban myth about Obama and his religion. He is NOT Muslim. Otherwise, he would NOT have gotten into such hot water with that reverend of his church who said "God Damn the United States" and all the other vocal bigotry expressed in his diatribe, which was almost completely taken out of context by the way with a few seconds of soundbites here and there. My parents were both Catholic, but that does not automatically make me believe in a religion or that I am a Catholic. I believe in NO religion. All religions claim to have the "one true god" yet I have seen no proof of any kind to show me which religion that makes that claim really DOES have the "one true god" of all of them making the exact same claim! But I digress, this is no forum for my soapbox...|`|yprHJNHAaa	Real answer....McCain would have been 4 more years of Bush.  I don't think our country would survive. McCain said the economy was strong and a week later the banks failed.  Would I vote for someone so out of touch with this country as McCain?  I decided a LONG time before that happened that I would vote for Obama.  Obama was the only candidate that understood the economy.  McCain ADMITTED he did not.  Obama KNEW this country was in the toilet...thanks to the republicans.  McCain is senile...even now he speaks out against everything Obama is trying to do...who cares...he lost, he needs to realize he lost. <br>  <br>  If Obama was green and purple...I would still have voted for him.  His stand on the economy, health care, energy independence...all were good.  Obama is no more a muslim than Bush!  <br>  <br>  If you make $250,000 a year or more...you benefited from the Bush tax cuts.  What were lived through was the biggest transfer of wealth in the history of this country.  The rich got richer...and Bush said they would create jobs...well that was one more lie he told!  Look at us now!  <br>  <br>  Your rant on abortion is unrealistic.  If you would have seen Bristol Palin's interview, you would know.  No one is forcing anyone to have an abortion.  The key here is that women have the right to chose.<br>  <br>  And you need to check out the voting record of the republicans.  Apparently, they think women do not deserve the same pay as men.  Republicans voted against the equal pay for equal work bill...the Lily Ledbetter bill.  In 2007, the republicans stopped it for being passed.  The Democrats passed that bill in 2009.  <br>  <br>  You need to look at the National Debt....the republicans beat their chests that they are the party of fiscal responsibility....that is another lie!  The republicans run up the debt...and the Dems pay it down.  Everything I have read says taxes are high when the US is a war...well we had TWO wars...and look at the debt the republicans ran up.  <br>  <br>  Now Obama is trying to do something for the people and the republicans are whining...where was the whine when Bush was selling our country to China?  China owns  2 trillion dollars of our debt that Bush created.  <br>  <br>  Vote for McCain...yeah, if I hate this country...but I don't!|`|ysES3F75aa	(1. Obama is close to 50/50 if not exact.<br>  2. I would google to find their religion. I thought his father went from Muslim to Atheist, and his mother was always irreligious. Also, people can't be born into religions. Why would it matter if he was Muslim?)<br>  <br>  I was undecided during the election, but looking back I would go with Ralph Nader. Ending the war in Afghanistan was the big decider.|`|cxV8qGl4aa	i voted for mccain/palin because obamas economic plan fuels inefficiency, and i actually wanted to not go into a depression and lose my job, but oh well, i wish libs would wake up and stop being so stupid|`|a881b642b5cabdf60bb0949b22b810ddaa	I didn't vote for anyone.

I preferred Obama's policy positions over any of his opponents.  I wanted more diplomacy in our foreign policy, not threats.  I wanted more funding for alternative fuels and green technology research, not a perpetuation of our fossil fuel dependence.  I wanted reform for our social services to make them more effective, not less.  Finally, I wanted an economic policy that directly benefited all Americans, not one that only benefited the wealthy with the assumption they would share it with everyone else.<br>  <br>  I actually feel bad for McCain.  He is my favorite Republican.  It is a shame the Republican Party wouldn't give him a chance until they didn't have one to give.

Even if it is self defense you can be charged with a crime, (Assault etc.),  if your state does not have laws protecting you.

The mere fact that a stranger is in your home gives you reasonable cause to believe that there is a threat. This leaves the reasonable force issue.  Almost every defense method you mention would be acceptable. In fact, if you can safely knock them out then you should do so rather than use lethal force. Such force would only be considered unreasonable in extreme instances, such as the intruder being a 6-year-old child who is clearly unarmed. <br>  You also need to determine if your state is one that requires a duty to retreat. Typically, self-defense involves a duty to retreat. This means that if you can safely escape rather than confront the person you are required to do so. It's not self-defense if you could have easily ran out the door and got away safely. Some states, however, do not require any duty to retreat if the person is in your car or your home.

He doesn't need leave for that.<br>  <br>  If you need to go to court, it will take more than three weeks to get a court date, so he will not need to worry about getting leave since he could be discharged by then.|`|RrIZM0wcaa	1 you should call his command and tell them he is planning on going AWOL #2 you should also let them know that he is cheating or something to that effect and #3 you should start filing for divorce.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	If he goes AWOL he will go to prison, so I imagine if he shows up to court for custody hearings there will be military police waiting for him.|`|dJnRFpWWaa	You can and should file for divorce as soon as you have the opportunity to discuss your situation with a domestic relations attorney.

Just a thought!|`|84059953db605b032d680002df0b2a4faa	The majority of winners were not Americans.<br>  <br>  Edited to add:  Derek's pal - My father, a Democrat, was in the Air Force for 26 years.

I'm not sure the award ceremonies are the place for that.|`|a2fc33ef68683e992ed3b3d9ab5e762aaa	I'm not disappointed because I didn't expect it.  The only thing I expect them to do is bash conservatives and praise liberals.  The vast majority of them have no concept that they owe the troops for being able to get up on their platforms and spout their nonsense.  Most of them don't even think about the troops one way or another.  It's a business filled with self-absorbed people.  I'm not trying to be too critical, but it is a very narcissistic business.|`|jd14u32qaa	I realize this will sound more negative than I intend it too, but we don't need people thanking the troops just because they are in front of a microphone.

OoftsMLhaa	First post is right.<br>  <br>  But you cant accidentally commit arson...  Thats why the definition says <br>  <br>  Ar-son: The crime of maliciously, voluntarily, and willfully setting fire to the building, buildings, or other property of another or of burning one's own property for an improper purpose, as to collect insurance.<br>  <br>  The most they would get is Negligence or Vandalism if it was an accident, but it a fire was set and a building was burned its not an accident.|`|aY9v3SJKaa	If they are caught they will be charged with a crime in the juvenile system and their parents could be ordered to pay for any property damages.|`|e2WyPzi8aa	first two posts are correct.  If they got the max, they would be arrested and put in juvinile hall until they reach the age of 18, and will be forced to pay for the damages.

She does not provide any substantive proof for her position.  Her arggument fails on its merits.   <br>  <br>  She quotes "Critics" who 'say' that King plagerized his doctoral thesis but she doesn't present anything to prove that he plagarized his I Have a Dream Speech as she claimed originally. <br>  <br>  When MLK's papers were donated to Stanford University, scholars discovered that King included sections of papers written by other students in his Doctoral Thesis without attribution.   The work he 'lifted' had not been published and there is no evidence that  his failure to attributed the work was intentional.  It is very possible that because the work hadn't been published, it didn't fit the Turabian format.  Its also possible that the work was used with permission by the author.|`|VMuZYfMwaa	a "patriotic speech" has more bullshit in it.|`|mT6b7INZaa	MLK's "I Have A Dream" speech is perhaps the most prosaic and patriotic speeches ever given by an American Citizen.   It is surpassed only by President Lincolns Gettysburg Address.|`|aGzLO9Oraa	His speech was about a movement to right a wrong within the United States that had gone against everything written in its most fundamental laws.  He strayed from his written speech and spoke from the heart and he basically predicted his own death.<br>  <br>  A patriotic speech is to rally the citizens to support their country.

I had a degree, a perfect score on the Civil Service test, and I graduated with honors from a municipal police academy. Over 80 resumes went out and I got 2 responses. One was from a state police agency saying that they had 50,000 applicants and only 900 positions. I am not a cop today, so if you can get in, more power to you.
P1YeBCnaaa	I used one a couple months ago,  Immigration bail bonds are hard to find because only certain ones can bail out immigration detainees.   I used    Gonzalez & Gonzalez (213) 628-8888 or nation wide (800) 628-8888 and they were really helpful.  They walk you through the whole process,  my bail was 5,000 and they charged me $150 for the process, and they will charge me 100 dollars for every year that passes by as a fee, usually immigration cases will only take about 2 years at the most. any more questions about your problem let me know :)<br>  <br>  god bless.

And what should we do to him if he can no longer care for his wife? If he can no longer work because of his disability? If he can work and his wife does live, what happens when every insurer denies her insurance based on a preexisting condition? <br>  <br>  So, this woman who had 12 kids....should America be the country that allows infants to sit on the side of the roads? Should we simply turn our back on impoverished children because of mom's mistake?

JDltTREfaa	People cry in court all of the time.  Everyone understands that this can be a very stressful and emotional experience.  Most judges keep a box of tissues up on the bench for just that reason.  If you start to cry, chances are good the judge will simply hand you the box so you can grab a couple.  If you get too emotional to answer questions, they'll usually give you a short break to compose yourself.|`|AA10558731	Crying is okay to a point.

First things first:  score high enough on the ASVAB to qualify for an admin job first, then look at what branches appeal to you.  Perhaps you could be a Yeoman in the Coast Guard or a Yeoman or Personnel Specialist in the Navy.  You already know what you are capable of, and what you like and dislike.  But regardless of what you choose, do not think that "business admin" will disqualify you from a one-way ticket to the SANDBOX.

So the fact you say you just did it one time or you are so great otherwise isn't going to make a difference.  However, because the items are of such little value, you will not go to jail or anything.  Probably a fine and community service.  Sux your parents have to pay because you screwed up.  Anyway, you will have a record now, if you do anything else it will go double hard on you.  Why would you steal something so cheap anyway?|`|EWCQ4XDKaa	lol @ black avatar|`|I0g24Jmkaa	if you got arrested, how are you on Y/A?|`|AA11043457	If you were arrested, then have to assume Claire's will wish to prosecute.  Actually it is the prosecutor's office who prosecutes in criminal action.  <br>  <br>  You screwed us sister.  You took two cheap jewelry items and for that  you will probably end up with a mark on your record and it won't be an "A".  They probably won't put your name in the paper because you are underage, though  I am not familiar with Arizona law.  People may still find out even  if it is not in the paper.  <br>  <br>  The fact that you do not have an arrest record  will be in your favor  (I don't know if I believe you have never committed a crime or just never got caught before).  Your straight A's will help you.  I am not sure whether they contact the schools or not.  Or whether that might keep you from playing sports.<br>  <br>  You could go to juvenile detention.  However, I think it miht be possible to get probation.  Then if you do anything again during probation, you will get all the time back theat they put on you plus any new time.  So you keep your nose clean.\<br>  <br>  You and your parents will need to go to court I would imagine, though there might be a private haring with a magistrate and it will be in juvenile court, I would imagine.<br>  <br>  You will just have to wait and see what they do.  My guess is probation which means guilty and a time set but they do it by probation as first time offender.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and you need to realize that it isn't worth it.

This can be any amount the store wishes to impose. Typical fines range from $200 - $400. If you pay the fine to the store, the matter is dropped, it doesn't go on your record, and you are simply banned from going to that store again.You can usually make payments on the fine. If you choose not to pay the fine, the store will refer the case for prosecution through the courts.<br>  The second option is prosecution through the courts. You will receive a notice from the court advising you of a court date. In court, you will plead guilty, be placed on probation, given a fine, and community service.<br>  Were you booked by the police? If the police weren't involved and it was just store security then they will be handling it according to the first option. If you were booked by the police or cited, it will be handled according to option 2.|`|nDNDHm6paa	Well, what did they tell you when they caught you?

And that was the end of it. (Well, she's not allowed to go back, but thats about it)<br>  <br>  Since you're so young and it wasn't really that much, I doubt they'll prosecute. (And no, they don't contact your schools, especially if they don't prosecute)<br>  <br>  I'm sure you'll be fine!|`|2u5gc2XIaa	hey, the same thing happened to me, but im 14<br>  i shoplifted from 5 different stores:/<br>  but it depends on if you go to this thing call teencourt or not,<br>  claires does prosecute,<br>  you'll find out when your court date is in about 3 weeks.<br>  hopefully they say that you have to go to teencourt, because if you do go to teencourt you dont dont have to do community service, all you have to do is take these classes that they assign you, like theres this class that all shoplifters have to take called "did you pay for that?"<br>  they wont contact your school dont worry about that.<br>  but if you dont get assigned teencourt youll go to regular court and i dont really know what happens there.|`|DwkO4Y9uaa	you're a minor. your fine. when you turn 18 your record is cleared. but if you do that **** again after 18.... well..... you're screwed. but for now you're fine.|`|UfPVZbRxaa	they might just ban you from the store or they might give you a ticket of around one hundred dollars but they dont cantact the school and it doesn't go on your record|`|L1QDGBK4aa	Idk, but why would you even do that...

TrgbEjXoaa	Depending on where you live, requirements will be different.  Many communities require a four year degree, not just an Associates degree.  Police Academy is a minimum of one year, then you will likely have to intern with an experienced officer for at least a year.  <br>  No prosecutor needs an inexperienced cop to screw up a case.
hmA8nfA2aa	Approximately two. However, you should earn a four year degree if you can. Also, you do not need a criminal justice degree. Choose a major that interests you and that would be useful for police work. Criminal justice, psychology, forensic science, a foreign language, accounting, and computer science are some good examples. Learn as much as you can, and earn the highest GPA that you can. Be a good person, maintain a good reputation, and don't do anything that you would not want a background investigator to find out about. There are many things that you can do to increase your chances of becoming a police officer. Check out <a href="http://www.peaceofficerjobs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.peaceofficerjobs.com</a> for excellent information and advice about becoming a police officer. Good luck!|`|QCEHA6d6aa	I think in some states they require a bachelors degree just to get your foot in the door of a police department. Most states require you to go though the police academy which takes about a year to complete.|`|mh17M1B1aa	Why would you want to become an officer, we have too many already.
fLH4ILzbaa	Their degrees are totally worthless.|`|6Gfz125Paa	No, it is completely unfair.  It is set up to favor the rural areas at the expense of the urban areas.  I think it should be a direct popular vote with whoever winning the most votes winning the election.|`|k5WdChc7aa	The Electoral College is there to ensure all regions of the nation have a say in the election. Otherwise, you'd have just a handful of CITIES (like New York and San Fransisco) electing the President and the rest of the nation basically shut out.|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	It works very well. And, it's there to provide political balance between large states and small states.<br>  <br>  Also, without the electoral college, in 2000 we'd have had recounts EVERYWHERE, not just in Florida.|`|NnUAXyCGaa	yes and no it should not be changed|`|VMuZYfMwaa	No, it doesn't work.

m0T0ywc1aa	I agree with you.  I don't hear the war being blamed for the economy by the media.  Good question.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	The war is a drain on resources, money and people. It brings nothing.|`|d4e41d3df62e651aeb95bc6da71e5eacaa	Yeah, cause I'm sure lending billions and billions of dollars to low income folks to buy houses that were completely above their ability to pay for had nothing to do with it. I can't believe how poorly informed the public is! The only thing we seem to care about is how to blame George Bush for the civil war, the French revolution, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, talking Eve into biting the apple, and your hemorrhoids.|`|FdZtCnwhaa	Before, if people want to realize it or now, war was used as a stimlus for the economy. But seeing as we have a standing military force that is larger then any other country (military countries not being counted), it feeds off of us.
48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	IF you have no other record, and IF the facts of this are not aggravated (e.g., you were not trespassing), what is most likely (and best for you), though hardly guaranteed, is that some kind of diversion program will be imposed either by the Probation Department or the court which will, if you behave yourself, result in a dismissal of the charge.  You better hope so, because if you get convicted of this, even if you get no other punishment, you will have to wait an extra year to get your driver's license.|`|nGkCWpRVaa	looks like the big house for you|`|TnjNnVNraa	well there 3 things that can happen you have to pay this certain amount of money is like a ticket or they my send you to away for you could learn your lesson or one more thing they my have you doing some community work which sucks trust me, well don't say you stupid we are teen we all do stuff lesson to learn that all :)|`|AA12205273	They'll probably make you do extra home work for the rest of the year.|`|VUfhHvjpaa	They will send you to GITMO LOL!<br>  Kidding, hope you learned a valuable lesson though.
AA11494150	The burden of proof required for a traffic stop is reasonable suspicion. If you appear young enough, and have too many passengers, you could be stopped.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Yes. You're allowed one passenger per seat. And it seems you were pulled over for this so obviously it can be done. Why do you people do something illegal, get busted for it, then come in here and ask if the cop can bust you for it when you saw first hand he can? Amazing.|`|ugWaptu2aa	In the Commonwealth of Virginia a peace officer who has reasonable suspicion can stop any person until probable cause can be established. But you are correct, currently a peace officer in Virginia can not pull you over if you are not wearing a seat belt. But that does not mean that you did not violate some other law. If an officer feels that you are taking too may passengers in a non-commercial vehicle they may stop you. <br>  <br>  Don't rely too much on the seat belt law, a bill has just passed the Senate committee to make it a first class traffic offense and it may pick up a lot of support in the Legislature.|`|EGKeYd0Waa	a law enforcement officer can pull you over for crossing the speed limit by 3 miles. overcrowding a vehicle and it also depends who the vehicle is registered under because if its you then it says on the officer's laptop that you can only have so many people in your car. Or if a crime has been committed in the vicinity within like s month i believe.
fgIbNRHfaa	The company that you purchased the background profile from should have a procedure for disputing incorrect information.  Contact that company and request an investigation.  You need to find out where they got that information and trace it back to the original source to get it corrected. You might also contact local law enforcement and ask that they conduct a background check to see if this information shows up in their system. If it does, they will be able to tell you where the conviction supposedly occurred so you can contact that jurisdiction and get it corrected.  Good luck!|`|3ba5677998abb4a2edc86de3c8dedeb2aa	check back w/intelius and find out what the mistake is all about.  then try another info site.  some of them are free for 24 hrs.  if you know your 'clean', you have nothing to worry  about.  intelius does make mistakes from my expirience.

vYgJMybeaa	I think the one the first answer is talking is the Bloc Quebecois. <br>  <br>  There are insignificant parties (as in they aren't main parties) like the Communist Party of Canada and another communist party called the Marxist-Leninist Party of Canada. The latter isn't truly communist as it supports the oppressive Juche ideology of North Korea.|`|qAL0CZIiaa	My knowledge is there are 4 main parties.<br>  <br>  Canadian perspective of what is extreme differs from other countries. Their least extreme parties are the Conservative and Liberal party. They have an NDP party which is a little nutty but not considered extremist - but they are a very far left party. They have another party that is only in Quebec and primariliy goal is to separate from Canada - that's kind of extreme. I'm not sure what that party name is though.|`|CNwo1exRaa	There is a Marxist Leninist Party of Canada and a Communist Party of Canada.  They formed because there are people that hold communist views.  They typically register votes a few hundred votes out of millions of votes cast in a general election.

In Canada,  the age of consent is 16. The only limit to this rule is either both parties are under 16 or the younger one is 14 and the older one is younger than 16.<br>  <br>  I would ask a free lawyer service over the phone.|`|uzqZOWlZaa	You're in luck my friend, the age of consent is 17, but if you're within three years of eachother its legal in Texas.

And, while a BB gun may not be the most dangerous, they are not considered "fake guns" (unless they are AirSoft). That could come with some jail time.

He's a student of history, and certainly a student of history can observe this trend at work.|`|8rvXwx7Qaa	Attributed to Jefferson in 1774, the statement warns the People beware what you ask for, beware what you allow. We are dangerously close to acceptance of the consequences. Jefferson envisioned either an intelligent electorate or a People conscious of the price of Freedom.He spoke of this day and time, take heed.|`|2d66454da71ea52f9302b902d6991747aa	Tom Jefferson has been proven correct.<br>  <br>  By Obama . . . who is currently taking everything our children and grandchildren will never have!<br>  <br>  So I guess he believes it and got on the happy end of the stick, leaving us with the other end . . .|`|YsQQ30YJaa	I agree with Jefferson. He should be the president. Can we vote for a dead guy the next time? He certainly would do a better job than a live Obama.All we would have to do is the stuff he wrote down to once again have a great nation.|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	I think Obama not only agrees with this, he is counting on this. Like Chavez, he wants to stay in power until he croaks.|`|J2PxEzBkaa	Well, that was the same dude that owned slaves but siad we should get rid of them, and then he said just get rid of the slave trade, but then he said we need slaves because they are scientifically inferior to us, and well...idk.  Jefferson rarely knew what he really thought.<br>  <br>  Obama must agree to the quote you mention to an extent though.  And well, to be honest, right now our government isnt very big in money or power or anything right now.  I doubt were in danger.|`|zt4GmLDBaa	I would say he agrees and it is his number one plan.<br>  <br>  The quicker he can reduce us all to one level of earning.. the happier Herr Obama will be.|`|C2HHfun2aa	I think he agrees and that is the plan. He wants to control everyone's life.|`|TE8zN8g9aa	I agree with Jefferson.  Obama probably agrees with him too...|`|DOB4tbquaa	I like it but I also think this one is quite good, "Socialism works great until you run out of other people's money."|`|3e46aef76b1fb84d0ce11d48fc610f4faa	Not only does Obama agree, he will try to make the "take away" part work.|`|es3245pSaa	I think George W. Bush took away our basic liberty with that horrible Patriot Act.....|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	He agrees. It's his plan.|`|M48kbO2Yaa	I believe that Obama thinks that he's smarter than the Founding Fathers. Despite taking an oath to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States", I am quite certain that this "Constitutional Scholar" has no intention of preserving, protecting or defending the Constitution.<br>  <br>  As a American liberal, his entire political philosophy is predicated on the assumption that the Constitution is somehow deeply flawed. All you have to do is research some of his own statements in regards to the Constitution to clearly hear him say, in essence, "I know better than the Founding Fathers".<br>  <br>  He believes that he can set up a system of government that can effectively "fairly" confiscate wealth and "fairly" redistribute it among the non-wealthy. Thomas Jefferson also said, "To compel a man to subsidize with his taxes the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical." I honestly don't think that Obama has any concern for either statement.<br>  <br>  To be fair to Obama, I don't think most any of the elitist politicians infesting Washington, D.C. care about Thomas Jefferson or any of the Founding Fathers. Obama and the Washington establishment is too used to treating the American populace as a piggy bank that they can shake out for cash any time they please for whatever they please.<br>  <br>  The real question is are we going to continue to allow them?<br>  <br>  Peace and prosperity.<br>  Children of Liberty Party.|`|XxUByikJaa	I think that Obama is just using our own tax money to invest In the USA and our people for a change .Rather then giving our taxes to wealthy  people who pocket it in out of country Swiss bank accounts .<br>  And it was Bush that enacted the Patriot act and Homeland security . I do not think that Jefferson would approve of that .|`|h9SHkkWlaa	Obama agrees --  Obama wants Big Government to grant him Big Power to match his Big Ego|`|5Mfu8lEVaa	I have no idea what Obama thinks of the statement.  I do realize the world has changed a LOT since Jefferson's day.
pTrvkvKmaa	If you use the same premise as some of the ignorant people do...yes.<br>  <br>  There are socialist aspects in all societies that does not make it totally socialist...there are shades of gray not stark black and white like some neo cons would like others to believe.<br>  <br>  Sad how the ones who try to defend against the question don't get it....Most people know it's not actually socialism...but the ignorant still call it that anyway...what is being said is that if it is called socialism here(wrongly so) then why is it not called socialism there when the same rules apply, regardless of who signed what bush ran with it....out of control with it.<br>  <br>  Bush had republican majority whatever Clinton signed could have been done away with. No matter anyway...Clinton did not sign a declaration of war, that was all bush...no excuses....froot loops.....|`|TE8zN8g9aa	True true.  True conservatives do not support the war in Iraq.  By the way, even most republicans realize that certain aspects of our society are socialistic.  Anyone who thinks differently is blind.  However, that doesn't mean our country uses socialism as our fundamental economic system, which is what most republicans are against (not socialistic programs)|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Do you even know what socialism is?<br>  <br>  Who is the hell is PRO-Iraq or any other war?<br>  <br>  I'm trumped?

Socialism is not entirely about economics, anyway, it's about transferring power directly to the population in all ways, something which without fail never works. Politicians tend to be adverse to socialism because it doesn't work and tends to create serious problems. Taking the money of Americans and putting it into the American Military (which happens to be in Iraq) is in no way socialism, even in the loosest sense of the world. Really, your question strikes me as a rather unintelligent oversimplification. Not that I support the American presence in Iraq now at all; although our removal of Saddam was a noble casue, the whole WMD story was a load of hooey. Right now, our focus should be on Afghanistan, so it is good that Obama is shifting it to such. But no, Iraq is in no way socialism. To ask such is concerningly misinformed.|`|xK7I1wj7aa	Nope.<br>  <br>  Next?|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Yes it is....you forgot to mention that AMERICANS are paying for ALL Iraqis to have universal healthcare. Our tax dollars at work...for them at least.|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	yes.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	No, it's not, you don't understand socialism, thanks for playing, try again.<br>  <br>  "The U.S. had to borrow more money and print more for this stimulus. You call it socialism. "<br>  <br>  That's not why the stimulus is socialist, it's because the government is directly intervening in the economy.  The government's actions are going to create winners and losers in our economy, it deters capitalism and private investment, because the big gorilla that is the government can just sit on and crush industries, accidentally or intentionally.|`|6JXrlnYsaa	What you describe is not socialism.<br>  <br>  Socialism is an economic system whereby the government controls the means of production and distribution of necessary goods and services.<br>  <br>  The only reason we're in Iraq is because cheney wants more money.<br>  And he got it.|`|598fac7b695aab3b03ad03f66442a74eaa	There is just no reasoning with people who refuse to shut their mouths and open their ears.  It is going to be so worth the loss of points to tell you I will never again bother to try.  Bye now.|`|1Fg7Tybvaa	Derek,<br>  You are one confused little man. I suppose that you are unaware that there was a law (Public Law 105-338) where Congress stated that it should be the policy of the United States to remove Saddam Hussein from power and implement a Democratic society, who do you think signed this into law ? it was President William Jefferson Clinton and he signed it in 1998, you may have an easier time if you Google HR 4655.<br>  <br>  Now you are trying to make foreign aid into socialism when in fact the US is trying to help Iraq get back on it's feet. I will admit that if you take money from the government you can call that socialism or you can call it aid so I ask you is helping an unfortunate person by giving them financial aid socialism or humanitarian aid ?<br>  <br>  In a true socialist society the government takes care of all of your needs, your housing, your health care and about 50% of your wages.<br>  <br>  You should read up on some of what your party has done before trying to make it look like it is all the Republicans, may be read just the last sentence of this link and then ask if Bush was the only one that thought Iraq had WMD's<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fas.org/news/iraq/1998/11/01/981101-in.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fas.org/news/iraq/1998/11/01/...</a>

AA11464317	The North American Free Trade Act was enacted by our leaders in congress who were influenced by big business seeking to lower their manufacturing costs. It figured that if the factories making the goods employed people for less wages, the goods would be cheaper to make and easier to sell. Makes sense sort of. Except that after two decades of moving jobs south to Mexico and over to China there were not enough persons left here with good paying jobs that enabled them to buy the cars made in Asia and Mexico and sales began to slide. Then the bad effects began to snowball into the mess we have today. That's my opinion.|`|DiDCG9UBaa	I'm not sure what NAFT is, but NAFTA is definitely responsible for job loss in America.|`|AWSmknxLaa	NAFTA may have shifted a ssmall number of low end jobs to Mexico.<br>  <br>  But it has VERY LITTLE to do with our current problems.<br>  <br>  If those jobs did not go to Mexico, they would have gone to China.<br>  <br>  NAFTA is good for the the USA and Mexico.<br>  <br>  Greed and lack of oversight caused our current economic situation.

nYjVW8Fbaa	rush is entertainment radio, nothing more|`|SjVvx32paa	Honestly, I believe he is.  He's utterly brilliant and despite being an imperfect human being, exerts an enormous amount of cultural and political influence.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, we've become so much more like a third-world country that things may be permanently irreparable.  Too many whites have been brainwashed into thinking that it is evil to defend one's self and one's family--but it is okay to do so if you are a non-white.|`|hXwqKidraa	His microphone has a mind control device attached to it. Control pulses are transmitted through the radio spectrum directly to anyone listening. I hear he got some of the engineering specs from the mind control device pioneered at Fox News NYC HQ.

It's all true.|`|1ZN4e4LDaa	Not my leader, he's out of touch with me, considering he makes $28,000,000 a year.

They talk against republicans. so what's your point of the question.|`|9PAavWnyaa	Only liberals think he is the leader of the Republican party.

The down side is increase in government jobs in over site but seems to me this over site is long overdue.|`|xJmDP5NGaa	PORK for all the good Obama supporters.....|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Of course we do...as we bothered to read the bill. You do realize that this Betsy McCaughey woman has already been debunked, right?? Limbaugh and Drudge reported her claims as factual....but they weren't. <br>  McCaughey, unsurprisingly, is back again, with an editorial in Bloomberg. In it, she warns that provisions of the stimulus bill "are dangerous to your health." In particular, she tells of "one new bureaucracy, the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology, [which] will monitor treatments to make sure your doctor is doing what the federal government deems appropriate and cost effective."<br>   The National Coordinator of Health Information Technology is not a new bureaucracy created in the stimulus. Bush signed it into office in 2004. it has a web site, a director, and, presumably, a phone line, which could have been used by McCaughey or Bloomberg to check the next fact: That it will "monitor treatments to make sure your doctor is doing what the federal government deems appropriate and cost effective."<br>  You'll be shocked to learn that, no, it doesn't do this, either. McCaughey is darkly conflating two things: One is medical health records. That's what the NCHIT oversees. It's a coordinating authority that helps "guide the nationwide implementation of interoperable health information technology in both the public and private health care sectors, to the extent permitted by law; and provides comments and advice at the request of OMB regarding specific Federal health information technology programs." In other words, it's helping the private sector move your medical records from manila envelopes to computers, and trying to help the private sector settle on a single standard so the records can be shared among different providers. That way, if you have an emergency and are taken by ambulance to the hospital, your primary care doctors can e-mail them your information immediately so you don't die from a drug allergy they didn't know about. This is all about a decade away from happening, incidentally.|`|ujIinLzGaa	I do know that it contains a section which allows the federal government to monitor your health care.  They can tell your doctor to stop treatment, take you off a drug, put you on a drug, or pull you off life support.  All in the name of knowing what is best for you, of course.  Blech!!|`|4ojHnyZkaa	Yes & No the liberal way of writing is to construct a document that leaves the door open to twisted interpretation to fit the goals at the time.

Personally I don't really care as long as it is government investment which it certainly has to be.  If you are really worried about it, the whole bill is up on the internet ready for you to read it.|`|Uk4OwRtMaa	This bill was in such a rush they had to bypass the 48 hr. "review" period, and the transparency promised by the Obama administration. As a matter of fact, it so urgent to get it signed, that no body had a chance to read it before the vote. And of course with the emergency nature of bill, Pres. Obama's three day vacation and additional two day delay before signing it makes perfect sense.<br>  If there is a designated place we can add potentially dangerous hidden stuff, let us know. I'd be willing to post whatever I run across.|`|AA11593583	That is the whole purpose of the bill. I think the latin terms is obfuscatus maximus. I read the original bill as it left the house.<br>  <br>  The member who voted for the bill don't know what is in it. But they voted for it anyway. <br>  <br>  They people who voted against it didn't have a chance to read it all and didn't like what they read and so they voted against it. But they are being obstructionists. <br>  <br>  There's a readers digest version at recovery.com. But you won't like what you find there either.<br>  <br>  Here's the problem as I see it. You have Congress (mostly lawyers) trying to draft a economics bill. I've been taught (school of hard knocks) if you want to get good information you have to go to the right source. If I want to sue someone I'll go to a lawyer. If I have a toothache I'll go to a dentist. If I need to get my books in shape I'll go to a CPA. If i want to know anything about economics. I'm going to go to an economist.<br>  <br>  If I'm right, why are we buying into the idea that politicians who are mostly lawyers even have a clue what the economy needs?|`|50deae2a31d97a07e20a3b7365fb20a4aa	I am trying to figure it out.

They can use anything you say against you.  To buy the stuff to write you must have someone put money on an account (there is a charge for this service.  With this money they can also buy toothpaste, comb, soap.  These items are not given to incarcerated persons.  Sometimes the incarcerated may have a job in the prison/jail.  They earn $1.00 a day.  A mac and cheese single serving cost $4.00.<br>  <br>  For someone writing an incarcerated person.  You can paste anything on the page.  You can not use staples.  You can not send anything like stamps, you can send printed material (like a calender).  Your letter may or may not be read.<br>  <br>  Time to receive letter varies from 4 -14 days depending if they want to punish you or just for fun they hold onto it.<br>  <br>  Some letters may not go through.  Like when I sent information about a group that helps people after appeals have been denied. (Had to resend it through a lawyer)<br>  <br>  Rules may change without you or the incarcerated being notified.

BJERgbM5aa	Joining the military is very honorable.  But doing so just to keep mom out of debt is not a good reason.  Here's what i would do:  Get into a college that has an ROTC program. (Reserve Officers Training Program).  All the branches have them.  Join the program.  Here's what it consists of:  2-3 hours of training each week;  2-3 weeks training during summer break;  after the first year, many of the branches have an option for members:  sign a contract with them wherein you promise to enter their branch of the service after you graduate.  In return for this you must maintain a B-C average.  They help pay for college tuition (50%).  When you graduate from college, off you go to Officer Training School.  Your enlistment is 4 years.  OCS is 6-8 months; then another specialty training school for 6- months.  After that, you have about 3 years left of actual military duty.  All the while, you finished college, mom was relieved of some of the financial burden, you got your degree, you insured employment for four years, you get additional training in a field that usually suits you, AND, you got into the military as an Officer.  Nothing is better than that.  Nothing.  Good Luck.|`|tWSYjZMWaa	yes, it is the only recession proof job|`|JXnyZ8rIaa	It can be a rewarding career if you choose the right specialty and are the right kind of person.  That said, the Army is not right for everyone.  You have to be ready to take orders and deal with responsibilities that mean others lives depend on you.  If you are ready for it, it can be awesome.|`|d23F89ECaa	All I'm going to say to that is there are military cemeteries across America filled with kids who joined for free college.<br>  <br>  I'm guessing you're American.  If I'm wrong, I'm sorry, but keep in mind, if I'm right, you're military is currently loosing two wars.  Right now is not a good time to enlist for the benefits.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Yes - it doesn't sound like the full time military is for you, though, perhaps you should look into the Guard or Reserves.  That can cover most, if not all, of your tuition and there will be some extra incentives in the GI Bill each month.  If you are unwilling to deploy, don't join.  Good luck.|`|UHBbSeesaa	hey first of all it should be  two on 4off  depending.<br>  <br>  Talk to the recruiter about the GI bill  and make mom some money.<br>  <br>  You'll get out a man and make her happy!|`|wf9RHP3Eaa	The Army paid for my education, but then again I serve because I enjoy working in defense of this country. Don't join just because you want free college- join if you have some sense of patriotism, want to learn a job skill, gain experience, become a professional at what you do, and become a part of something bigger and better.<br>  <br>  Something bad could happen to you if you go to war. But have you ever stopped to realize that more teenagers die in car accidents in this country every year than the total number of men and women we have lost in combat since September 11, 2001?|`|TnDFT313aa	That's quite a burden to put on parent if they have to go into debt to pay for it.  I think the army is worth it if you want more out of life.  Don't just do it for the money.  Do it for the challenge and the adventure and the pride.  When parents see how good you're doing and what you're accomplishing, they tend to come around to the idea.  That's my only opinion of course.|`|vP8RQ9lWaa	Would you like to hurt your mother when she hears on the news that you just got killed by a roadside bomb? A dear friend of mine just got killed in Afghanistan and the pain it caused is unimaginable. It's shared by those of many innocent victims families overseas. <br>  <br>  If you really think about it. If no one ever joined the army anywhere, war would be ended forever. <br>  <br>  Mankind must put and end to war, before war puts an end to mankind. JFK|`|ZtzoZDE3aa	No. What the army doesn't tell you, is that at almost any time they can draft you back into the army, I'm pretty sure your mom would rather go into debt than have her son hurt/killed. But to help her out try joining a worse collage, getting a job to pay your way, and/or  get a student loan.|`|jVRvMpAYaa	no its not; they may say they'll pay for it which they might but so many people get screwed over from them. You may get injured or they may just say you don't qualify. but hey you could maybe still get it.|`|fe57457146ff1608077b527bfec6f2dcaa	I had a degree before I enlisted and it was the best thing I've done with my life.
VOZWgWgLaa	Every country has used "socialist" programs to a certain extent, including the USA.<br>  <br>  The problem is that Socialism is a broad spectrum movement.

There are moderates are "Socialists" who are quite willing to work within a democratic system so long as they have a voice in policy. But there are also extremists who have taken a "my way or the highway" mentality to the affair and would not tolerate being only a voice within a system. Far too often these extremists destroy the system in the efforts to become the only voice.<br>  <br>  Conservatives look at the extremists within the spectrum of "Socialism" and think that any implementation of policies from within that spectrum will lead to the extremists gaining power and destroying the system, which has not really failed America. They then swing to the opposite extreme to protect the system.|`|SlhuFfuZaa	If they are doing so well in Europe why is Senate bill 2433 being brought up to bail out the rest of the world.<br>  Get real!|`|67ca5f16c70d9d86cc6e5be00db25445aa	Neocons got rich and saved a lot of money and bought into a system of selling American's wealth to globalists for dividends and profit.  They started collecting IRA's and gold first.<br>  <br>  They can't fathom giving incentives to lower middle income workers and complained like crazy when Clinton had a stimulus bill to counter what Bush senior had done to the economy.<br>  <br>  They'd rather scream "the sky is falling" when they don't really know anything except they don't have the secret reigns to profits anymore.|`|4SF4KGu4aa	interesting choice of words. If it is something you prefer then it is reforming. If you haven't live in a total socialist society, I don't know what you can base your opinion on.<br>  <br>  Kind of like using the word "change"<br>  <br>  You can reform a live person to a dead person but is that reform good for the person?|`|HI0oQriqaa	a socialist government takes the peoples money then gives it back providing they follow guidelines set forth by the government. do you see that happening anywhere near you? come on!|`|a388e4e3066dcb4e1de9e18979b89ef0aa	pure Capitalism is a Ponzi scheme....and who wants limitations on a scam they're running|`|AA11875616	You are essentially correct.  Corporate capitalism, without laws prohibiting monopoly power, would all eventually end up one mega-large corporation controlling the entire industry.  With monopoly conditions, you get less of a product or service than you would under market conditions, and you pay a higher price than you would under market conditions.<br>  <br>  I am in favor of corporations not owning other corporations, and as many as possible of smaller corporations in any one industry.  I am also in favor of socializing any economic functions that cannot be provided by markets, for whatever reason.  Whatever cannot be provided by markets, the government must provide that good or service.<br>  <br>  For example, some states prohibit alcohol from being sold in other than state-controlled stores.  Others, like mine, practically give it away.  There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach.  It just depends on what kind of society you want to live in.|`|f4Yec6iNaa	"These economic systems allow price to be determined by supply and demand factors."<br>  <br>  You have nailed it, the current economic system in the US is not a free market economy. It is more if a centrally planned economy through the manipulation of interest rates by the Federal Reserve. After 9/11 the Federal Reserve price set the cost of money to be 1%, this caused too much lending to take place and led to one of the greatest bubbles in history.<br>  <br>  So what we really need is LESS government in the free market. Government intervention only lead to market distortions which require more government to fix.|`|3U1po4Ihaa	Bell was broken up  because it had a monopoly, so apparently we don't have a unregulated capitalist country like you think we do.<br>  <br>   America has been social democracy for quite some time; SS, Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP are great examples.  <br>  Can you guess which social programs you probably pay into and which ones deal with health care?   <br>  <br>  Any social program or social government has the element of socialism.<br>  <br>  Do you know what the following words have in common?<br>  Social program, social government, socialism, and socialist.|`|TnDFT313aa	Because several of the things the new administration has been talking about leans towards socialism and away from capitalism.  For example, the government owning national banks is socialist.  It's an industry the government has no business in.

0d5edff6ca86151fdb18b82dadc968a0aa	Claaaaro... que eu lembro dessa musiquinha!!!<br>  1993, o Brasil em plebiscito p?de escolher entre a forma de governo - Monarquia ou República- e o sistema de governo- Parlamentarismo ou Presidencialismo- e essa era a música da campanha monarquista que pedia a restaura??o do trono no Brasil. Essa can??o é realmente muito linda. Na época eu n?o votava ainda, mas já me interessava por política e ficava encantado com a possibilidade de transforma??o que poderíamos ter com a experiência parlamentarista que inclusive, caso se efetivasse,  previa uma nova consulta popular para o povo decidir se queria ou n?o o retorno do sistema anterior. Na época acredito que n?o teria "votado no Rei", n?o tinha conhecimento suficiente para entender que um país pode ser republicano mesmo que sob uma monarquia. Hoje, com toda a certeza do mundo seria a favor do Parlamentarismo, com  rei ou com presidente.<br>  Esse plebiscito f?ra acertado na Constituinte de 1988 e o povo optou pela continuidade da República Presidencialista.<br>  <br>  Abra?o,<br>  <br>  <br>  Clayton.|`|623b17193f5e40335ebac1da4e7a00f5aa	Eu votei no presidencialismo. Diversamente do parlamentarismo tradicional, a proposta submetida ao plebiscito n?o previa a possibilidade de dissolu??o do Congresso, e este, investido de poderes constituintes pelo presidente josé Sarney, encheu-se de privilégios e prerrogativas. Estou convencido de que a remota possibilidade de o Brasil sair do bloco do 2a mundo (ou já estaríamos no 3°?) passa por nova constitui??o, que n?o seja elaborada por congressistas.|`|7605916f46152577e9df680a888cf253aa	N?o entendi a pergunta.<br>  Que rei é esse eim?|`|AA12005596	Putz... nem sei do que você está falando.|`|e20b2ae28a31319deabce6aedc2aff22aa	Re re re re re re re... <br>  <br>  De que se ta falando ???|`|60e3c388eaaa9dbd50e8a93dfd5dabaeaa	N?o sou nada simpático a monarquia , uma casta inútil .|`|785c2e3a16892c402d0f13a9973c2023aa	Milton Candil!

Entretanto você cita que houve antes "assédio sexual", este sim, um tipo penal conhecido e que pode ser utilizado. Minha dica pra você é seguir por este caminho do assédio sexual. Se você conseguir juntar provas deste incidente, você conseguirá uma condena??o (art. 216-A, CP), porém ressalto uma informa??o importante: para que se caracterize o assédio sexual, esta pessoa que te assediou deve ter uma rela??o de hierarquia com você no seu trabalho (deve ser um chefe, gerente ou cargo parecido), pois se n?o existir esta rela??o de hierarquia, descaracteriza-se o tipo penal e n?o há mais crime (  o fato se torna atípico).<br>  O outro caminho - o assédio moral, também pode ser intentado, porém você terá que se munir de provas  para postular indeniza??o, que neste caso será apreciada em esfera cível.<br>  <br>  Prefiro a a??o penal (assédio sexual) pois tem san??o mais dura e mais adequada para que você quer no momento. Além de, se o agressor for condenado, gerarará antecedentes criminais e reincidência (se ele voltar a praticar outro delito).<br>  <br>  Obs. - Quando  você se refere aos seus "defeitos físicos" talvez caiba a tipifica??o no crime de "injúria qualificada", precisaria saber exatamente o que ele fala de você.<br>  <br>  Este, seria também um bom caminho para puni??o do agressor.<br>  <br>  Em todo caso, procure um criminalista ou a Defensoria Pública do seu Estado ou ainda os diversos Núcleos de Atendimento gratuito das Faculdades de Direito e informe-se melhor, estas informa??es mais pormnenorizadas n?o devem ser compartihadas na internet e sim apenas com seu advogado.<br>  <br>  Sucesso.|`|pGCOpi8Baa	Você precisa primeiro se armar com provas, talvez gravar uma conversa, hoje tem muita tecnologia pra isto um mp3 portátil, um celular, enfim tem muitos jeito de vc conseguir isto ate mesmo gravar uma conversa por telefone depois que vc conseguir provas e só tomar as medidas necessárias talvez falar com um superior  no trabalho ou ate procurar um advogado pra ver o que pode pegar, mais primeiro vc precisa ter prova... ai vc pega o safado|`|sKamod0raa	Vc falou "perseguindo" acho que o melhor a fazer é se resguardar com uma ocorrência policial. <br>  Qto ao "imitar e apontar defeitos físicos" creio que o melhor é ignorar!<br>  Boa sorte!|`|AA12005596	Procure a polícia e elabore um boletim de ocorrência.|`|03e7fca9897118016e6d6a4fc21c5dabaa	contrate um detetive.Siga esse cara até tu descobrir algo contra ele.

Com Sarney, chegamos ao fundo do po?o, o trabalhador recbia pela manh? e à tarde seu dinheiro já n?o valia nada.  Itamar e  FHC tiveram peito para mudar a estrutura, e Lula mais ainda ao manter o plano. Estamos colhendo os primeiros frutos, com o país voltando a ser acredidato, com o dinheiro externo voltando a ser colocado aqui, que vai gerar empregos e maiores salários.<br>  Mas o povo só vê o que está à sua frente, n?o olha o passado, muito menos o futuro de seus filhos e netos.<br>   Sou crítico feroz de Lula, mas no plano econ?mico é o caminho a seguir, o que desgostou os aloprados do Partido.<br>  Por eles, estaríamos, de novo, no tempo do Sarney, coveiro do Brasil, com o povo feliz, gastando, mas sem futuro em nada, e com sua moeda sendo desgastada. <br>  Uma olhada nos países que saíram da pobreza e chegaram ao primeiro mundo e veremos que o caminho foi esse. Mas brasileiros querem tudo acontecendo de uma semana para a outra. N?o entendem de projetos de médio e longo prazo. Uma breve estudada na forma de investimento chinês, poderia ensinar mais a nosso povo. Aqui o egoísmo é total. Querem que a distribui??o de riqueza aconte?a da noite para o dia, sem empregos, sem empresas de porte. Por isso precisamos dos investimentos externos, daí a necessidade de termos crédito.

Fernando Henrique Cardoso foi o melhor presidente que o Brasil já teve!<br>  <br>  Além de ele haver feito um plano que estabilizou a nossa economia, que controlou a infla??o e melhorou muito o padr?o de vida do nosso povo, ele foi também o presidente que mais investiu em tecnologia - foi ele quem trouxe, entre várias outras inova??es tecnológicas, a internet para o Brasil em 1995! E foi ele também quem diminuiu gradativamente (apenas a longo prazo, a partir de 2002) o pre?o dos computadores, inclusive dos computadores que já vêm prontos para a internet! é gra?as a isso que hoje há tantos lares no Brasil com computadores conectadosà internet - outro excelente resultado que Lula(dr?o) insinua ser dele próprio!<br>  <br>  O nosso presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso criou o Bolsa-Família, e Lula(dr?o) quer levar o crédito!<br>  Enquanto Lula(dr?o) vangloria-se por ter criado o Bolsa-Família, deveria se envergonhar por ter inventado o "Bolsa-Juros": "Para o Bolsa-Família, R$ 10 bilh?es. Mas, para o Bolsa-Juros, R$ 156 bilh?es."<br>  Em setembro de 2006, Geraldo Alckmin disse: "Vamos manter os programas sociais porque eles nasceram conosco, no governo do presidente Fernando Henrique Cardoso - como o Bolsa-Escola, o Bolsa-Alimenta??o, o Vale-Gás.

Apesar de muita coisa errada que FHC fez, melhor do que o atual ele sem dúvida foi, e melhor dos que o precederam também. Pena que o povo n?o tem memória. Esqueceram do tempo do Sarney, em que a infla??o chegou a 80% ao mês! Já esqueceram que quando a gente entrava nos super mercados, os funcionários estavam de posse daquelas maquininhas de colocar pre?os em mercadorias aumentando em plena luz do dia e na frente dos fregueses. E n?o foi fácil para ele conseguir implantar o Plano Real, pois tinha o eterno PT dando o contra em tudo o que fazia. E agora o que vemos? Tudo o que FHC fez de bom, o atual governo assume como obra dele, e tudo o que FHC errou virou heran?a maldita! Esse povo está t?o alienado que n?o percebe que se existe uma heran?a maldita nesse segundo mandato do atual presidente, é uma heran?a que ele mesmo deixou, porque o primeiro mandato também foi dele! Agora, numa coisa tenho certeza de que FHC foi muito melhor! Na cultura, na postura de presidente de uma grande na??o, na representa??o do nosso país no exterior! Hoje viramos piada por lá! Até o Bush já percebeu que estamos sendo governados por um buf?o, e está se aproveitando disso, tentando uma maior aproxima??o, sabe-se lá com que inten??o. E olha que o Bush é também um tremendo ignorante, basta ver o que ele está fazendo aos americanos, massacrando-os num país extrangeiro, sem nenhuma raz?o racional.|`|eec1d350daeb586415b97d44d8897683aa	Na minha opini?o, ele foi um grande safado, pois comprou deputados para votar a reelei??o dele, portanto, meu caro o Sr. FHC é um grande salafrário.|`|0nzdkUb1aa	ia fazer a mesma piada do Kidnapper.<br>  N?o sei qual a altura de FHC pra comparar...|`|3b941dcfaadf1bdd710a52165e8ccd83aa	talvez JK. mas FHC para mim foi um dos piores que o brasil ja teve|`|7a9b9542420d81a9d41ea5330aa5c93faa	Olha o maior foi  Jucelino, acho que tinha uns 1,90 de altura.|`|JxvK2tgNaa	melhor q o de agora, mas nada perto do melhor, que n?o sei quem foi, mas atigamente pessoas deixavam seus países para vir morar e trabalhar no Brasil!

I think he will be the front runner for the GOP, I'm not sure about his chances will be in the general election though. I listened to a Republican Strategist (David Weeks who does TV ads for the GOP) at the college I attended and he said that Romney and Huckabee would lose no matter what in the 2008 election if they were nominated...... If you want to know who will win in 2012 in the general election look at the model done by Alan Abramowitz of Emory University. This guy is a genius he developed a political model that can tell you the winner about 6 months ahead of the vote. He combines GDP Growth and Presidential apporoval ratings in his model. Every time there is a general election he nails it on the money.

AA12090988	In response to Pieceo..whatever, are you comparing gay men and women to monkeys?  You probably don't think Americans of African descent should be allowed to vote either huh?  Our present government is a fascist regime that feels the need to micromanage its subjects.<br>  Civil unions are not an exceptable substitute.  Why?  Because they do not come with the tax breaks and financial advantages that marriage does.<br>  People say that the "sanctity of marriage" should not be tainted by gay love.  I challenge that.  I think that the "sanctity of marriage " is tainted by people who are abusive, and in loveless marriages because society says you should not get a divorce, or society says you should be married by a certain age.  Isn't love the basis for marriage?  To have and to hold for better or for worse?  What part of those vows can a homosexual not fulfill?  <br>  BIG BREATH. okay, I need to stop ranting now.  sorry  Oh and by the way, the reason people first came to live in this great country was to get away from oppression, because there ARE countries that are much worse.  Let us never forget this is the Land of the FREE and Home of the Brave.<br>  I'm really done now.|`|5a7f59ce57fceae1ae4a8e7447e5bb18aa	Liss Miss "know nothing"  The Government is not stopping you from loving someone....  they are just trying to protect the sanctity of marrige..  <br>  <br>  What rights do married couples have that homosexual couples do not have?  <br>  <br>  If you talk about health benefits:  then that is an issue you have to take up with your health care provider...  or better yet why don't you start your own health care insurance and provide coverage for homosexual partners?...  Its a private company question not a government question.  <br>  <br>  What other rights does the government give to married couples???  Can't think of any?  The only thing is, is the marriage tax relief..  and guess what, you dont beleive in tax relief you beleive in taxing more..  so that doesnt concern you..   <br>  <br>  So stop talking about the government taking away rights..  you DUMB IDIOT!!!!<br>  <br>  By the way to the idiot that posted the first answer..  about the government talking about repealing the civial rights amendmendt.. please give me facts...  I would love to see it|`|AA10071149	It is a shame, indeed, that the government feels it necessary to discriminate, even trying to embed it into our Constitution.|`|AA11712589	Republicans usually stand for less government....now their webcam is in your bedroom.<br>  <br>  These f*ckers won't even raise the minimum wage but they voted to give themselves a raise.

The whole acceptance of gay people was coming along well until people started pushing the Marriage Initiative to early.  <br>  <br>  The government tried to enact a bill that would give gay couples the same rights that straight couples have.  The only stipulation was that you could not call it marriage.  I think the term to be used was to be union.  This was shot down by the gay marriage supporters as not good enough.<br>  <br>  That proves that it is not equality that you would like.  What you are after is to force the rest of the country to accept you as being the same.  News Flash:  You are not the same.  Instead of trying to force us to accept the differences maybe you should first accept them your self.<br>  <br>  I have a better question.  Why does it seem that the opinions of different minority groups get to influence the policies and governance of a natoion that is supposed to be based on a Majority Rules premise.|`|d5a6997932b3e03bb3b1aee2f4a8cc02aa	Shut up ALEX!!! Someone has got some anger issues.  Let the girl speak her mind, you don't need to call people names.  The government everyday  is slowly taking our rights. If they don't look or act white, which I'm sure you are then we have to stop them!!!  Why put a ban on any marriage? And this whole deal you can't call it a "marriage" but a "union"?  Lame.

He also taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004.

pUVb1w8Haa	Is it legal to pick something up on the side of the road?<br>  Probably, depends on what it is, obviously if it's something like a fallen road sign then it may be larceny to take it home. I would need more info.<br>  <br>  Is is legal to start a business? NO <br>  <br>  Put a sign in your yard? Maybe, check to see if you have CC&R's that prohibit signs, or if there is a restrictive covenant that prohibits signs. You may also be in violation of a local residential zoning ordinance, but you would have to check on those in your city. <br>  <br>  Papers that people sign to protect myself and them? YES. It's called a contract. As long you have all of the elements of a contract (offer, acceptance, consideration)<br>  <br>  Is it legal to kill someone if they break into your house in SC? In SC you must believe the intruder is there illegally, and intends or is about to cause serious bodily harm to you. So if a kid breaks in and is stealing a DVD player you can't shoot him in the back of the head while he's running out.

For example, NBER dates the early 80's recession from July-81 to November-82, when the Senate was in Rebublican hands.  And NBER dates the 2001 recession from March-01 to November-01; the Senate was so evenly divided that it is an argument who was in control.  Not likely that the Senate being Democratic from Jan. 3, 2001 to Jan. 20, 2001 caused a recession that began 2 months later.  The Senate did not return to Democratic hands until June 6, 2001, well after the recession was underway.  Would anyone reasonably argue that this party change in the Senate ended the 2001 recession?  No.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nber.org/cycles/</a><br>  <br>  But never mind this.  The only reason to bring this up is to imply that Democratic Congressional actions eventually lead to recession.  As you know, each recession is different, so that kind of blanket idea is unlikely to be true.  For example, the 81-82 recession was the result of a tightening of monetary policy by Paul Volcker to bring down inflation.  Reagan and his economic team were willing to accept recession as a consequence, and rightfully so.  The excesses of the late 90's caused the bubble-bursting 2001 recession that was aggravated by 9/11.  We are in another bubble-bursting recession now.<br>  <br>  Another factor to consider is that Democrats have been in control of both houses of Congress most of the time since 1931.  Kind of makes sense that nearly all recessions happened while Democrats controlled Congress.  By that same reasoning, all bull markets of the last 60 years, except the one that started in March, 2003, began while Democrats controlled Congress.  That doesn't mean much either.<br>  <br>  Investors won't wait out the Obama presidency.  They remember the last recession, where stocks peaked in early 2000 and didn't begin a sustainable bull market until March, 2003, three years later.  No one is in a rush, since the market peaked in Oct, 2007, just 18 months ago.  Chances are we have a ways to go before investors will climb on board.  When there are profits to be made again, no one will care which party controls Congress or the White House, and no one will care what the cap gains tax is either.  Investors are many things, but stupid isn't one of them.|`|aabe6beac2525179d02308256da8576daa	As noted in your sites, having a balance of power   is the only thing that unites the United States.  Any time one party has too much input, there have been serious mistakes made. Actually economic climate is the results of 20 years and probably cannot be accurately correlated by a party, congress or a presidency.  Jimmy Carter allowing the US to use the social security fund has been the biggest mistake of a presidency and it is only now that we realize that our aging population is at risk due to his policy.|`|f598d30e60d0a8ecbb5bd782a442def6aa	If you knew anything about the economy you would know that it is not heavily impacted by congress or the president's policies for at least a few years until after they are enacted. To get reliable data you would need to look at who was running things 3-5 years before the "recessions" happened to know who was responsible.<br>  <br>  Markets do not change overnight. I don't care who was in charge in the years before the recessions. Democrats may have still been. But seeing as your question is obviously blindly partisan in nature in the first place, I suppose there's no getting the truth through.|`|IYZJZLUIaa	Why do you think?<br>  <br>  There's a reason the GOP is the party known for fiscal responsibility. And when the economy is in trouble, putting money directly into the hands of the American people through tax cuts has ALWAYS ALWAYS worked. But try telling a Democrat that, and they'll find someway to call you unpatriotic and racist. <br>  <br>  Democrats love to spend the nation's money. (Yet when President Bush spent money on our nation's security, it was "shame, shame, shame...") That's why we always have a tough time. You'll also hear them talk about Clinton and his little surplus. (His lack of dealing with the terrorists that Bush had to deal with had absolutely nothing to do with that, of course, and neither does the fact that he taxed the heck out of the rich people, who already pay 80% of the nation's taxes)<br>  <br>  EDIT: I love this from AVAIL_SK... <br>  "just because the Democrats are in control of the Senate doesn't mean that they are in control of policy or in control of congress..."     - Let's think that over, shall we? The Senate is part of Congress, and they write and vote on policy. Hmmm...|`|eulMjLtPaa	And yet, Republican presidents for each of them as well.|`|NqNbIp2caa	That you lot are reverting to this post hoc defensive (not to mention elementary school) level of debate rather than addressing the real issues - is probably the reason the American public have determined they want your lot having nothing to do with anything remotely linked to running the country.<br>  <br>  <br>  For instance lies such as "economy had been in a steady growth since 1994"<br>  The previous downturn by your own admission occurred in 1990-1991 - so you have deliberately omitted 3 years of steady growth presided over by a Democratic Congress. Indeed the plans implemented by the Clinton administration in its first two years (some of which Gingrich cynically "promised" at the 1994 election - after they had already been implemented) certainly set the path for the longest expansion in history.<br>  The NBER states the recession of 2001 began in March 2001. But it was not until June 2001 that Jeffords switched alliance. So another lie falls apart.<br>  And the most ludicrous of all - that the early 80s recession promptly ended in 1981 when Republicans took over the senate. The NBER states the recession continued until late 1982 at least - with unemployment peaking at 10.8% in November and December of 1982.<br>  <br>  <br>  An assumption that you do not know what you are talking about is quite fair given the level of your argument.<br>  You have presented nothing other than a chronological correlation (that even then you have to distort) to support your argument, not a single argument based upon any actual policy or implementation issue you can associate with economic downturn.<br>  You have ignored other key inputs (for instance the role of the executive) and instead decided to massage (and when that didn't work - manufacture) "facts" to meet a pre-determined but logically flawed conclusion.

First of all, only officers can be pilots, so you have three options.  Enlist and go through OTS, go to the Academy, or go through ROTC (I'm ROTC by the way, and would highly recommend it).  You need to have good physical fitness scores, 90s or 100 is good.  If you're doing ROTC, gpa is important.  Flight ratings and hours help, but are not required.  You need to take and score high on your AFOQT (basic fill-in-the-bubble type test) and your TBAS (kind of like a video game really with a joystick and whatnot).  Once you get the pilot slot, there are 2 years of training and a 10 year commitment (since it costs a lot to train pilots they want to get their money's worth out of them).  Hope this helps.|`|e8RYVfW6aa	6 years minimum. 4 years of college, since you have to be an officer. 2 years of flight school, and then training in the type of aircraft  you are assigned.|`|efaeb5b2fa80f6005c5fbf4063c1b49eaa	A minimum of 40 flight hours.

W2pvqhbkaa	So the billion dollar lobby to avoid insurance payments was not the responsibility of rich people heavily invested in or dependent on bribes like these to get elected.<br>  <br>  You believe that the rich did not lobby for our government to look the other way while the hard earned investments of the middle were stolen by world.com, Enron, and many other rich Wall street.<br>  <br>  You believe the rich did not lobby to change the banking laws to allow credit companies to void all contracts by writing can be changed at anytime with out notice.<br>  <br>  They didn't allow banks to rather than work with consumers when they lose a job or health care refused to cover health care but put in to foreclosure on 1 missed payment.<br>  <br>  The rich didn't lobby to have the right to jack an interest rate from 9-27 percent as well as adding on late and over limit fees. <br>  <br>  The rich made bribery of elected officials legal and called in lobbying.<br>  The rich have devastated not only America corrupted our government representatives they have financially devastated a good many other countries.  <br>  <br>  So lets have them pay their fair share and not let them to steal, kill, and get away with anything they choose.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Oh they don't hate the rich.<br>  <br>  They hate rich republicans.<br>  <br>  Rich liberals are just fine.|`|9w9UHyCNaa	Just because someone is wealthy doesn't make them successful. The majority of rich people actually inherit it from their family throughout generations. How is this hard working?<br>  <br>  And also, they inheritted a lot of Bushs tax cuts, and I never saw one contribute a little bit of their wealth to help poor Americans who lost their jobs, can't pay their morgages, or can't afford healthcare. You are right about the government and America needing the rich though. That doesn't give them the rich to inherit all their wealth to themselves though, the rich NEED the poor and middle class so they can keep their businesses running, so it's the same both ways, not just one. <br>  <br>  I don't hate the rich, I just wish they would do a bit more for America.|`|903f8cb36b3e6a7b3d1a5dc322e02788aa	People  hate the rich because they have bought into the lie that there is a finite amount of wealth in the world.  If the "rich" have less, the rest of us will have more.  This is Obama's idea of "redistribution".  <br>  <br>  The fact is, the rich are rich because they have learned how to create wealth.  There is not a finite amount of wealth.  The rich will always get richer because they know that there will always be enough to go around, if everyone is willing to work for it.  Those who work, get paid.  Those who do not work, do not get paid (unless the government pays them).|`|AA11993638	But to get a real feeling for who pays what, the bottom 50% paid in a whole 3% of the federal income tax, but took the most benefit from the system. Or you can look at in these terms, the top 1% of tax payers paid in as much as the bottom 95% of all tax payers. Plus there is evidence that Bush's tax breaks actually increased the revenue up until 2006.|`|JO8FKDRhaa	i dont hate the rich. except if they got their money without working for it or if they earned it unethically. that sticks in my craw ya know? what i hate is irresponsible people who buy beyond their means and got us into this economic mess. also the banks who lent them loans to do it. selfish idiots all of them|`|xtrdlyJHaa	I don't hate the rich. <br>  <br>  Where would we be without the rich?|`|gYNDNXAkaa	Why do all the slaves hate their masters?

WHY?'<br>  <br>  Let's eat the rich.  Who else is down?|`|ujxh8Pb2aa	Your original statement is wrong. Many of the rich DO harm us. They steal, lie and cheat their way to being rich.

They hate the wealth who use their wealth to deprive us all of the power of our votes through bribery and financial coercion.<br>  <br>  That little stat you quoted, the top 1%, if you think they actually worked hard, when they are actually corporations, who do nothing but invest other people's money, you are delusional.<br>  They also hold about 65% of th wealth in our country while paying only about 40% of the taxes.<br>  Like how you skipped the upper 5% right to the upper 25% which includes corporations and 75% of wages earners.<br>  the upper 25% hold about 95% of the wealth and pay 87% of the taxes, while the remaining 75% hold about 5% of the wealth and pays 13% of the taxes.<br>  Does it really take a PhD in math to see the problem with it.<br>  Here allow me to put in into a dumbed down version for you:<br>  upper 25% has 95% of the wealth and pays 87% of taxes<br>  the lower 75% holds 5% of the wealth and pays 13% of the taxes.<br>  On a percentage bases people who earn 95% of the wealth shoud pay 95% of the taxes, while people who earn 5% of th wealth should pay 5% of the taxes.<br>  <br>  there is one fact of life, and that is the rich will always complain that they are being victimized by taxes no matter how little they have to pay.<br>  <br>  Warren Buffet claims he pays about 17% in taxes on his income. How do you suppose that is when people of lower income pay about 20%, if he is being so victimized by taxes as right-wingers claim?<br>  I'll tell you... the rich use tax havens to prevetn paying taxes on billions.<br>  The get tax credits for nearly everything they invest money in, especiall if their investment directly results in jobs.<br>  Not only that, but hey benefit from taxes paying to send people to school to keep the labor supply well-skilled and available so they don't have to pay programmers several million a year salaries, or engineers like CEOs that make $1200 an hour.|`|UvzKiis0aa	The rich did harm us.  They robbed our 401Ks and pensions, hired illegals to drive down our blue collar wages, and steal our social services, imported H1Bs to drive down white collar salaries and outsourced whatever else while reaping the benefit of our economy and paying little taxes relative to their incomes.<br>  <br>  The rich lobbied to change tax laws, tariff laws, trade laws, etc. to benefit themselves.  They have been getting richer, paying less in taxes while the rest of the country gets poorer and pays more. <br>  <br>  There is a little chestnut about how there is no great wealth without great crime.  Your little fairy tale about rich working hard is just that.  For example, Bill Gates Jr. got rich because his father is a wealthy attorney who gave his son $250K and free legal advice in order to build an illegal monopoly on software and operating systems.  Bill Gates didn't work hard, he stole the original operating system and many of his software copyrights from others' shareware.  Bill Gates acted no differently than John Rockefeller with Standard Oil.  He drove others out and stole their ideas or sued them if they were similar to something he copyrighted.  His system is crap but he colluded with IBM and other PC makers so that it was the only system used and because of the uniformity of operating systems, computer viruses written on Microsoft programs can cause disruptions in the entire country and most of the world.|`|JBK0I9aGaa	the left has insidiously inserted wealth envy and class warfare into its rhetoric over the last 50 years.  actually it's now very blatant.  it's a vote buying technique that works on the weak-willed and self-pitying.

YupMCYHlaa	The Republicans have always (or at least the last few decades) had a policy of never cooperating with Democrats.  They don't believe in compromise and consensus and sharing power, they always want to dictate terms from a position of strength.  My way or the highway.<br>  <br>  I would have thought that losing power would make them reconsider this approach.  All they seem to be able to do now is obstruct.  Obama even asked them if they had any other ideas but they had nothing to contribute.  Tax breaks for billionaires is the only idea they have, and that's what got us into this jam in the first place.<br>  <br>  But the GOP is working on a new image.  They will reinvent and redefine themselves for 2012, and I'm hoping they come up with a more reasonable attitude.  Otherwise they're basically just excluding themselves from participation.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	I think its funny to see people like you gloat like this.

Do you like the fact that the federal government can now tell your doctor to stop treatment, put you on drugs, take you off drugs, or pull you off of life support, based on their ideas of effective treatment?  Do you like the fact that Obama has put this country in more debt with one signature than George W. Bush did in the entire 8 years he was in office?  I am not saying that the Republicans are without blame for anything.  But don't you think it is time we stopped bashing each other's politics, and started working together to solve the problems that, left unsolved, will destroy this country?  Do you know, for example, that New Hampshire already has a resolution to secede from the US in their legislature (google HCR 6 if you want to read it), and 8 other states are drafting similar resolutions?  Obama hadn't even been in office 3 weeks when New Hampshire introduced this resolution.  I don't think that 9 states were seriously considering secession during the first 3 weeks of any other president's term!  Are you aware that this could lead to either martial law, or civil war?  I would say that this indicates that Obama is doing some things that are very, very wrong, and the media are not reporting most of them.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Really? How glad will you be when they start to pass legislation that destroys your life, invades your privacy and takes all your rights away? There will be no one there to oppose, and well....your loyal support is what they count on. It's naive to think that a one party system would be to your benefit. And, no matter how many times you turn around and look backwards for blame, Barry didn't do too good of a job on that "change" thing. You may not like anything that Bush did or Republicans did...but Barry took the cake with his spendulus. No opposition whatsoever leaves a nice opening for dictatorship.

I'm aware of the prison code that says if someone steals from you, etc. then you must go to them and "don't come back unless you have blood on the tip of your shank or blood on the tip of your ****", but it's a stupid code and 99.9% of the time the inmates settle the dispute with a simple battery. (Especially since raping an inmate will result in a new charge and a long sentence.)<br>  If you and your friend have desires to rape people, get help or come out of closet before you hurt someone.|`|ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	What do I think?

Nor can I afford to do the last couple improvements to my home, as many were done under the Bush tax credit about 2 years ago. In order to gain the mere $13 a week, I would need to be able to find employment, but too many of those jobs have gone overseas and more are following daily. Because I have a degree, his college pell increase will not assist me either, so once again I will have to take on more debt to get the education I need to compete in the job market. So who exactly will it assist? Those who still earn at least a middle income, and those who earn nothing.

However, if you didn't actually see them shoot at your brother, then you are assuming it was them.  <br>  <br>  You could try going to the Police Commissioner to talk to them about the situation.  I don't know  your age.  Do you have your parents' support and will they go with you?   How do you know they showed the police a different gun?  Did you see it?  If you did, did  you tell them that it wasn't the gun they were using?<br>  <br>  Your brother should not go over there for any reason.  He does not want to be the aggressor so they might have reason to defend themselves.  It could be  your brother rather than the chickens.  If you can tape the gun shots or get photos of them shooting, that might help.  However, do not put yourselves in danger.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  It does look like the police would give you more help here.<br>  <br>  This is not a legal opinion.|`|RfxyVIh4aa	It sounds as though the police did not find you and your brother to be credible.  That the neighbors stood up and supported the shooter's story might be an explanation, but this is still a bit puzzling.  Do you guys have a history with the neighbor?  (Why did the neighbor lie?) Were either of you drinking?  Do you guys have a criminal record?  Was there any reason for the officers to have ignored your complaint?<br>  <br>  If you believe that you and your brother should have been considered credible witnesses, then you might want to consider contacting the prosecutor's office directly.  There isn't a requirement that the police make an arrest for charges to be filed.  If the prosecutor believes there is enough evidence, s/he can move forward.<br>  <br>  You could also go down to the police station and ask to speak to a superior.  Explain the situation and ask that they take your report.  This doesn't necessarily mean anything will happen as a result of this report, but you WILL be establishing a paper trail.  This could be especially useful if you take the other poster's advice about installing a video camera.

AA10401458	INDIA'S lonesome cries in the US-created wilderness about Pakistan’s promotion of terrorism elicited a long-awaited echo in the candour of the visiting Russian President Vladimir Putin. He not only called a spade a spade — which many other countries have been “diplomatically” avoiding to do — but also warned the world against the danger posed by the role played by India’s neighbour in nuclear proliferation. Perhaps this forthrightness will goad the USA to shed its “see no evil in a collaborator” policy. Even if it is not America, at least some other nations can be expected to discard their inhibition finally. What has helped Russia in better appreciating India’s plight is the fact that it has had to face a similar onslaught itself. For that matter, the USA is also no longer a stranger to the horrors of terrorism. Yet, it has bought special kid-gloves for the sake of General Musharraf ever since he turned his country’s Afghanistan policy on its head and from a bad boy became the US pointsman in the region almost overnight. Now that India has found vocal support from Russia, which asked Pakistan to implement in full its obligation and promises to prevent the infiltration of terrorists across the LoC into Jammu and Kashmir and at other points across the border, as well as to eliminate the terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Islamabad-Occupied territory as a prerequisite for the renewal of peaceful dialogue between the two countries, it will, hopefully, not be seen as a perpetual grumbler out to settle scores with Islamabad. Mr Putin has elaborated on the threat that stares the world in the eye in a forceful manner and reiterated that the danger of weapons of mass destruction stockpiled by Pakistan falling into the hands of renegades is very much real. In contrast, he has wholeheartedly supported India’s peaceful nuclear programme, so much so that there are indications that it might even supply additional civilian reactors to the platform already existing at Kudankulam.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20021206/edit.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/2002120...</a>|`|176753e1e7d907b54819633acc76e4afaa	they play to both sides.  which ever one benefits them the most at the moment is who they take sides with.|`|AA11881520	If we're talking geography, India is below Russia, and no where near the USA.|`|b85bf95a74390383949ce496a0393b96aa	india distrusts china and esp. pakistan.  bush has tried to warm up to them to join his coalition against china by offering the indians all kinds of perks like outsourcing more stuff like call centre jobs to english speaking india.  the beneficiaries will comply by providing men and logistical support to the fight to take down china before it becomes a superpower.

It's seems the family attitudes (and possibly the reason these bastards think the way they do) of these cowards was shown during the court proceeding when the mothers of the rapists screamed and cursed the victims calling them sl*ts and wh*#es, and in another case the father of one of the rapists was caught paying for a hit on one of the victims including having her raped again, shot in the stomach, eye then forehead, he was quoted as saying "i want her to feel as much pain as she can",. If this is the mentality that some Muslims are raised on; that any women who is not a Muslim is automatically a wh*#e and deserves to be raped, then the imams need to do some serious re-educating of those ignorant, misguided families/individuals in the ways of Islam, not  sadism.

e9517b229c6b941d12071b820b5d137baa	Great question! Clear and concise, which is more than what I can say for a lot of the propaganda that's on this site.<br>  <br>  1: This is probably the hardest of the 3. On one hand, this motion is really a step towards sovereignty. By recognizing that Quebec's a nation, even if in a united Canada, plants a seed of doubt into everyone's minds. However, This motion really is a compromise (which we need more of, I'm just saying) and I'm hoping that it'll get those separatists to just stop at least for a couple more decades. <br>  <br>  2: Other groups are different in some ways, but that depends on how you define "rest of us." If you mean "British Caucasians", then yes they're different. But if you mean "Canadians" then no they're not. Unlike the US, Canada is what a lot like to call a "cultural mosaic", in which many individual cultural groups help make Canada what it is. I don't support Quebec sovereignty in the first place, simply because its part of Canada whether it likes it or not<br>  <br>  3: I think Canada's still going to be stable. We're not exactly the most interesting country, but we are usually quite mellow. We'll get over it soon enough.|`|6737bc1385aaa269c889b6f7c3e1c1e7aa	1 - No. It's right in the middle of Canada, the Canadians will lose major economy advantages, and if war is declared, Quebec will have the enemy on both sides.<br>  <br>  2 - It depends entirely upon the geographical characteristics of these areas. California, for example, is different, in its own ways, from Nevada. Both are still in the same country and both get on well enough without becoming independent.<br>  <br>  3 - Very unstable. The area will become a muddle of messy trade, once again the whole "sandwiched" deal comes up, and of course, Quebec is not really all that populated...

Ambos, independente de suas bandeiras políticas, s?o componentes singulares na vida política nacional e que de uma certa forma qualificariam significamente o congresso nacional.

Daí a importancia de se ter uma mídia plural, objetiva, técnica e democrática. é o que a legitima como fiscal dos demais poderes. <br>  <br>  A partir do momento em que abre m?o de seu papel mediador, instrumentaliza as denúncias com o objetivo de derrubar presidentes, o jogo é outro. Na América Latina, após a redemocratiza??o a imprensa conseguiu derrubar diversos presidentes, dentre os quais Andrés Perez, na Venezuela, e Fernando Collor no Brasil. Tornou-se poder maior, e com apetite para investir sobre os demais poderes, inclusive derrubando mais presidentes. As tentativas contra FHC e, mais agudamente, contra Lula, s?o exemplos recentes. <br>  <br>  Foi o que ocorreu com a imprensa venezuelana algum tempo atrás, quando chegou a apear Chavez do poder, embora por pouco tempo. <br>  <br>  Agora vem o troco. <br>  <br>  Para avaliar adequadamente o ato de Chavez, torna-se necessário dispor de duas informa??es fundamentais. A primeira, como vinha sendo a atua??o dessa emissora nos últimos anos. Persistiu a inten??o golpista ou n?o? A segunda, como tem sido a atua??o da mídia venezuelana como um todo. <br>  <br>  A segunda quest?o é relevante para se avaliar se a decis?o de Chavez desequilibra o jogo, em favor do Executivo, ou n?o. <br>  <br>  Vou me basear na matéria que me foi enviada pelo leitor Pablo Simpson, do “Le Mode Diplomatique” de 30 de abril passado, artigo assinado por Bernard Cassen. Diz ele (a partir da tradu??o de Pablo): <br>  <br>  Sobre a RCTV: <br>  <br>  Será que essa concess?o de dura??o limitada da RCTV era, de fato, de dura??o ilimitada? E isso fechando os olhos às inúmeras infra??es cometidas que lhe valeram notadamente o fechamento por 24 horas a até 3 dias n?o pelo governo Chavez, mas em 1976, 1980, 1981, 1989 e 1991, pelos predecessores sociais-democratas ou democratas-crist?os. Desde a sua primeira elei??o à presidência da República em 1998, Chavez n?o fechou nenhuma esta??o de rádio ou de televis?o, nem perseguiu jornalistas. Entretanto, isso é o que teria acontecido n?o importa em que outro país democrático, diante do apoio apresentado abertamente pela maioria dos canais de informa??o – dentre eles a RCTV – ao golpe de Estado abortado no dia 11 de abril de 2002, quando n?o de sua organiza??o. (...) é, sem dúvida, o único país do mundo onde, no passado, os pedidos públicos de assassinato do presidente n?o resultaram em processos judiciais. <br>  <br>  Sobre a concentra??o da mídia venezuelana: <br>  <br>  Em 2006, havia na Venezuela 20 canais hertz VHF privados e um público. Contavam-se, aliás, 28 canais hertz UHF privados, 6 públicos e 44 comunitários. Atualmente, com a incorpora??o da RCTV, o servi?o público terá dois canais hertz VHF, dois canais UHF e dois canais a cabo. Estamos muito longe do monopólio... <br>  <br>  Sobre a partidariza??o das emissoras: <br>  <br>  Estudos de conteúdo realizados no mês de janeiro de 2007 mostram que, em seus programas (da RCTV), convidaram-se 21 personalidades hostis ao governo e nenhuma favorável. No mesmo mês, um dos quatro canais privados, Globovisión, convidou 59 opositores de Chavez e 7 partidários.

Mas como poderia ser diferente numa paisagem de canais de informa??o em que a maior parte dos jornais, rádios e canais de televis?o se comportam como partidos políticos de oposi??o? é preciso esperar que a TVES, o canal que retomará o sinal de RCTV, mantenha suas promessas de pluralismo, mesmo nessas circunstancias adversas. <br>  <br>  Sobre a imprensa escrita: <br>  <br>  Em 10 jornais de difus?o nacional, 9 s?o de oposi??o declarada ao governo.
