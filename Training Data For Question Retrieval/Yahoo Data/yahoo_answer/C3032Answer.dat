lLN8VD20aa	They are supposed to receive a one-time payment between $ 250 - 300. The date hasn't been set yet but I feel that they would want that to happen quickly so I'll estimate it by June 2009.|`|NGrq8VePaa	I hope soon

AA10519043	You can call that number and see who answers. If you do not have a long distance plan on your phone, it should only cost a few cents if you place the call late at night.<br>  <br>  Or, you can try calling it collect to see who answers it.

Your dad is actually buying you something that you smoke with?<br>  I can see the headlines now:<br>  <br>  Irresponsible Father Acused of Murder|`|unlpwEDMaa	I'm sure they will sell it to him...wow your dad is okay with you smoking out...? craaazy man....|`|Y1zH3Ecfaa	If you cant buy it you cant be in the store ... at least thats the way it works in SoCal I think it would be best if he just brought it without you standing right there...|`|c48424a6323cebabcc703fb6afd42268aa	Im pretty sure even you can buy a bong.<br>  I live in Ontario. & you can buy a bong anywhere, like at a convenience store even. There is no age limit. Not like smoking & drinking.<br>  But yes, they have to sell it to him. They cant refuse.|`|xPeIvywdaa	sure, as long as he buys it, and doesnt give it to you in the store and etc.<br>  <br>  you get the idea|`|zeeNZ42laa	So you and your dad both smoke pot?  Or does your dad support you smoking?|`|uFbl7e4oaa	Go in first and pick one out then tell him what it looks like and he'll go in and buy it for you, simple as that.  Usually clerks won't sell it if an underage person is with the buyer. It's better to be safe then sorry.|`|FfGIZe7jaa	It's leagel hit that bong and burn that weed like michal phelps.

08ecf8a68a9ab1aa3a103cd77bbf74e1aa	The best advice I can give to you when going to braid shops is to say to show a picture of what you think you want and ask the price or tell the person that you have ex: 60 dollars and what types of styles can I get for that amount. These are hard economic times and hair stylist are<br>  more apt to working w/you or bargaining on a price.<br>  <br>  When my mother visited she got her hair braided at this hop-she got kinky indvidual braids. I had my own hair cornrowed.They do a good job and prices are reasonable.  Show them a picture of the style you want. They also have braid books w/ styles.<br>  <br>  Mouna's Hair Braiding<br>  834 Upshur St NW<br>  Washington, DC 20011<br>  (202) 722-2202
AA11452852	If you work on a contract basis, that means you are not an employee.  They are not offering health insurance, a 401K, or other benefits, because they want to treat you as a non-employee.  It would be like when you hire a plumber to come to your house.  You don't pay his health insurance, because he is not your employee, just a contractor.    Keep in mind as well that a contractor has no rights beyond what the contract says.  The contract will be for a certain length of time, which could be a month, or six months, or a year (probably not more than that).  After the contract period, they could say, "thanks, we don't need you any more," and that would be it.  You do not have any other rights.    So, yes, you should certainly take all that into consideration in negotiating your pay.  Find out what it would cost you to get health insurance on your own (you might be shocked how expensive it is).  You can set up your own 401K, so that's not a big problem, but you won't get paid vacations or sick days, so budget for that as well.  Then be ready to say how much money you need to make up for the things they are not paying for.  If you would accept $13 an hour at a regular job with benefits, you might need $15 or $16 to make up the difference in a contract job.    I don't want to be too negative here.  One advantage of working as a contractor is that you should be able to get much more flexibility about your hours.  Just like that plumber who tells you when he can come, you should be able to say what days and what hours you will be able to work (so long as you get the job done, of course).      I understand that you don't want to be rude, and there is no reason to be rude.  If they offer you the job, but the money isn't right, let them know how much you need.  They  can say "we can't pay that much," or they can say OK.  If you have other options, you just need to be prepared to choose one of the options if they can't pay you enough to be  worth while.    Good luck!!
HfsZisOdaa	I think your best bet is the phone book and calling several jewelry stores. <br>  <br>  ~
