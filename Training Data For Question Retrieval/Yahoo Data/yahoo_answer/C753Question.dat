I can't choose just one, but these are the top choices of mine:      Guiness   Killian's    Shiner Bock (texas beer--delicious!)   Smithwick's (a must try!!)--brewed by Guiness   Dos Equis   Corona      Sadly, I drink Bud Light more than any of these. Not that it tastes that great, it is just lighter with fewer calories...... :( Guiness Extra Stout is the best, though...Hands down....

The result:negative 49 dollars and growing!!. This was not my fault, however. I reviewed my debit card charges and realized that Jack-in-the-Box charged me three times for the same order! So when I made my next purchase with my debit card I went negative. If Jack-in-the-Box hadn't charged me 3 times for that one order, I would have had enough money for the purchase that made my account go negative. Shouldn't Jack-in-the-Box have to pay me back the 49 dollars? What should I do? How do I do it?.. thanks.

20090219215931AAwfM3k	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Is anything wrong with my alcohol tolerance?	Ok, I'm not talking low tolerance...I'm taking BEYOND low tolerance. I had about two shots of orange flavored stoli mixed with orange juice, and coffee liquer with milk. By the way, I weigh 100 pounds and am 15 years old and I'm female. After that, I got extremely drunk out of NOWHERE and starting rolling around on the floor. Quickly after that, I passed out and began throwing up everywhere uncontrollably and hours later I came to. This seems very abnormal. I don't think I'm allergic to alcohol or anything because I've had a few sips of both hard liquer and beer other than that time. Also, I've never gotten drunk after that experience because I'm afraid that the same thing will happen again. I'd really like to be able to get buzzed or slightly drunk but I'm concerned that I'll be in danger. Can anyone help me please?

I've been drinking tea (TAZO Zen green tea during the day and Celsteal Sleepy Time chamomile at night).  It is to my understanding that I'm only supposed to use 8 oz of water per serving.  Is this correct?  Also, how many times can you steep one tea bag?  If more than once, what do you do with the tea bag in the mean time?  Any help or additional comments you think I should know would be greatly appreciated.
