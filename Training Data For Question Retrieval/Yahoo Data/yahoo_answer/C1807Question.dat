The main difference between these two is which processor range they have. Having very little experience in this field, I am unsure as to which processor range is better. The two processors that are within my budget are the AMD Athlon X2 5800+ and the Intel Core 2 Duo E8500. Any advice on which of these is better?

20090202111241AAsKLzh	Computers & Internet;Security	How can I access data on my old hard drive when I keep getting access denied messages? ?	Ok so I've taken the hard drive out of my old (broken) laptop and put it into a Hard Drive Enclosure I just brought so I can access my old data (Music, Pictures etc.) But whenever I try to access files in the "My Documents" section, I get messages telling me I don't have permission to access the folders. I've already read up a bit on the problem and have tried going into the "Properties" of the folder and changing the owner of the folder, but that only lets me look at the files in that folder. I cant play any music files, look at any pictures or copy them over to my new laptops hard drive.     Is there a way I can bypass these security measures altogether? Or am I just going about trying to give myself access the wrong way?     Thanks in advance.

20070824112244AAvlRZL	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Domanda per voi esperti: RAM incompatibile x la scheda madre?	Ciao a tutti,      giorni fa ho inviato una domanda chiedendo lumi su cosa fare per il problema al PC. Si blocca, all'improvviso non facendomi terminare neanche l'installazione del sistema operativo.       Considerate che il PC me l'ha configurato così proprio un negozio di computer al quale l'avevo portato per farlo vedere.        E' con processore AMD, con due banchi di RAM che da quanto capisco sono DDR400. Sono diversi come capacità (uno è 256 MB e l'altro è 512) ma il fatto è che sul manuale della scheda madre c'è scritto che dovrebbe esserci, come RAM o:      DDR333 o DDR266.      Potrebbe essere questa la causa del "freeze" e dell'instabilità del sistema?      Ultima cosa: dalla menu della BIOS vedo che chiede di impostare la RAM ma ... pur modificando e smanettando il problema persiste. Che fare?       Grazie dei suggerimenti.      Ciao,      Uno è

Ciao,    ho vari problemi al PC (processore AMD 1800 mhz con ca. 500 mbRam, scheda integrata, etc.) . Tende a bloccarsi, improvvisamente.       Anche dopo aver formattato, lentamente per fugare ogni dubbio, l'installazione si blocca quasi alla fine. Si "ghiaccia" tutto, il PC si blocca, s'impianta letteralmente.    Non so cosa pensare. Potrebbe essere l'hard-disk danneggiato? considerate che in un momento in cui funzionava (prima di dover formattare per via dei vari problemi) ho fatto check disk e aveva trovato dei "cluster danneggiati".     Che consigliate di fare? provare a prendere un altro hard disk? ma se non va perch dunque non si blocca all'inizio durante la formattazione?     Non  strano che funzioni ad intermittenza... e che solo ad un certo punto si blocca?     Grazie e ciao    L'hard disk  un Maxtor da 80 GB. Credo sia buono... escludendo quello quale allora il problema?     Grazie dei suggerimenti.

Confido in voi cari answeriani.      1)       come cambiare la lingua di sistema (me la dà in inglese)?        2)       c'è un sistema per mettere una scorciatoia sul desktop per la connessione/disconessione ad internet (ADSL), senza scrivere ogni volta le stringhe ... pppoe ... (quali?)       3)      c'è un modo per aggiornare l'intero sistema operativo? ho una versione (la 6.1) che credo sia vecchia rispetto all'ultima? come aggiornare i vari programmi dentro Kubuntu? sempre attraverso "adept"?      4)       tra i programmi che, attraverso Adept, potrei scaricare con Kubuntu, sono solo quelli KDE o posso scaricare anche quelli "GNOME"? ho visto che ci sono tantissimi programmi e applicazione per GNOME e molti di meno per KDE...       Come fare dunque? grazie.

Dopo aver fatto l'aggiornamento (con update manager), vedo però che la versione non è cambiata...      C'è un modo, senza dover re-installare tutto, per aggiornarlo all'ultima versione (la 7)?

Dopo averla selezionata mi dà errore...       Forse devo fare altri passaggi? forse perché scritto per KDE? che fare dunque?      Scusate le tante domande.       Grazie e ciao a tutti

20090202121617AAJwPAX	Computers & Internet;Security	Anti-virus protection software?	So I have McAfee on my computer sense I first got it which was last May. A couple of weeks ago I got a nasty virus on my computer; it was a trojan horse and I don't know how it got there; I don't open junk mail, I stay on clean sites, I don't click on pop ups, etc. I had Dell remove it for $130.00 and McAfee didn't protect me what so ever. I complained but they basically blamed it on being a "human error" on my part which it wasn't. Does McAfee owe me money and do they have really crappy customer service or is it just me? I'm in college so $130.00 doesn't come by easily. Thanks.

I tried all the "safe" modes, "last known good config" and "normally" modes-  Nothing has worked.

20090205112749AARKXPQ	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Question about flash drive?	Okay, I'm not the most computer saavy person you'll ever meet, so please don't criticize me if this is a stupid question.      I love to play the Sims 2, I installed it on my computer (along with various expansion packs) and it caused my PC to be so much slower than before. I recently purchased a new laptop from Dell, and I haven't put the Sims 2 on it yet, I have been waiting for the release of the Sims 3.       I also use my laptop for school, so I really need it to not get bogged down from installing the Sims 3, because that's definitely gonna use a lot of space. So I was wondering if it was possible to use a flash drive to install the Sims 3 on instead of istalling on my C drive? And just stick it in the USB port when I am playing??

20090205113837AA5GUwu	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	C++ Program  need help?	In this program, you are to calculate how much you make each week. You suppose to   work three days per week, while the numbers of hours for these three days vary. Your   program asks the user to enter, for each of these three days,   1. Number of hours, and hourly wage   2. Output the number of hours, and the sum earned that day   Then your program calculates and outputs the following:   1. The total you have earned for the week   2. The number of hours you have worked   3. If the total you have earned is greater than $150, print out “Go to see a movie Saturday   evening and have a good dinner in a favorite eatery”   4. If the total you have earned is less or equal to $150 but greater than $100, print out   “Go to see a movie Saturday afternoon; Have a hamburger for dinner at MacDonald”   5. If the total you have earned is less than or equal to $100, print out “Watch football   game UM vs. MSU at home; and have a home-made sandwich”   6. If the number of hours you have worked is greater than 20 hours, print out   “No TV/movie over weekend; and go to library to study”. Note this condition (number of   hours > 20) may conflict with #3, #4, or #5. If conflict, your program only print out the   message in #6.
