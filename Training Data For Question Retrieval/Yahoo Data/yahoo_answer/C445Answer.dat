VWLtJoX2aa	They burn very clean, no byproducts.  Propane is not an irritant, does not cause sensitization, and has no known teratogenic or mutagenic effects.  If you don't have a propane tank outside that is your biggest concern.  Building codes and commonsense advise you to keep propane cylinders outside in case a cylinder leak occurs, which you may not notice since propane is heavier than air and collects at floor level.|`|N4IvZmPiaa	If that was the last source of heat on earth , I might consider keeping it. If you haven't bought one yet, do your self a big favour and don't!<br>  <br>   Unvented heaters were never designed to be a primary heat source. They burn the air that you are breatheing, and they are dumping products of combustion into that air. They are ILLEGAL in all of Canada and many states in the US. They are very capable of putting out carbon monoxide if you don't have windows open for ventilation. You should always have monoxide detectors in a home with any fuel burning appliance, but with one of these? I would wear three of them around my neck! Get the feeling I don't like unvented appliances? I don't! They terrify me!..and I've been in the propane business a long time! They should be banned altogether...<br>  <br>   Get a direct-vent heater. They take in air from outside, burn it with the fuel and put the products of combustion back outside. There is no direct communication with the air in the home and the combustion in the appliance. It uses a heat exchanger to put the heat from the burner into your home. They are safe, reliable, safe, efficient, safe, clean, and oh yeah...safe!!!<br>  <br>   No home I ever live in with my family will ever have an unvented appliance in it!|`|fNuMoHt7aa	If it wasn't safe they wouldn't sell it.

Personally I've had one for over ten years and had no problems. I use LPG in mine and the only problem I get is the amount of condensation that collects on the windows. Not sure about propane but LPG has 5% water in it and that's where the condensation comes from.<br>  After summer and I need to fire it up for the first time I give mine a good clean and check all fittings by bushing soapy water on them to make sure there's no leaks. If the pilot flame has a yellow tip to it there's dust around the jet and needs bushing.|`|944iJNAdaa	I don't consider them safe at all.  Not only the products of combustion, which there has to be some, but the lack of oxygen in the air - how can you say is "enough"?  I think we're meant to breathe the full amount of air that's in the air naturally, and products of combustion should be vented outside.  If the stuff is so pure, send it outside, and we'll all be happy.|`|bVLwH4jlaa	I would not venture into risking your health or safety. To be safe, contact a local heating specialist.

2uZXCyeBaa	A short has caused your dimmer to be damaged beyond repair.  Dimmer switches are easy to replace and if you pick one up at a hardware store it'll come with instructions.  The first thing that I'd suggest, though... is that you turn off the circuit breaker that controls the lights and remove the existing dimmer.  Hopefully you have a single pole dimmer that has two wires coming out of it and maybe a green or copper wire connected to the metal frame.  If you do, just connect the two wires together using a wire nut.  Make sure that you don't connect the green or copper wire to anything right now or you'll get an unpleasant little explosion.  Now turn the circuit breaker on and see if the lights work.  If the circuit breaker trips off, stop and call an electrician because there's a serious ground fault that caused the dimmer to burn out.  If it doesn't trip off, go to the store and pick up 5 new bulbs.  Replace all of them because one of those bulbs probably caused the old dimmer to go bad and you don't want to break the new dimmer.  Also pick up a new dimmer.  I recommend Lutron brand instead of the $6 generic dimmers because they're more attractive and more reliable.  You'll probably pay about $15-20 extra.  Turn the circuit breaker off, replace all of the light bulbs, and install the new dimmer according to the instructions in the package.  Turn the circuit breaker back on and make sure that everything is working.  <br>  <br>  Compact fluorescents and LED bulbs are not a bad idea, but make sure that you don't try and put a dimmer back in if you use them.  Use a regular switch instead.  Some expensive compact fluorescent bulbs will say that they can be dimmed, but they generally only have a range from about 70% to 100% and then they'll turn off.  Dimming fluorescents is a job best left to a professional and the equipment is quite expensive.|`|tMtBe1lKaa	If you want more lights at the lowest cost, replace the one that burned out. <br>  It might be a simple thing, and you only need to replace the switch itself, or it could be a bigger problem.Replacing the switch itself is fairly simple. turn off your breaker to the light, unscrew the switch plate, and take to a building or electrical supply store. They can help find a replacement. If you're not sure about hooking it back up, at least you've saved some money since the electrician won't have to charge you for the plate and time taking it off. <br>  It could be a bigger problem, and if you have no knowelege of building or electricity, then it's better to just call in an electrician.|`|frUYhmuYaa	make sure the fuse or breaker supplying the circuit of the dimmer is pulled/turned off. then remove the faceplate. buy a cheap voltage sensor from a hardware store to make sure wires are still de-energized. remove faceplate. remove screws holding the dimmer in place. pull out dimmer. again, check to see if there is not voltage present in the wires connecting dimmer to outlet box. twist off wire nuts that are holding the dimmer to house wiring. install new dimmer using new wire nuts(twist as tight as you can by hand). position dimmer on outlet box, screw into wall. replace faceplate.|`|YqBOf1Yraa	most dimmers are designed to operate only one light.<br>  You might try smaller wattage bulbs. flourescent lights should not be on a dimmer.|`|934e6defc1f9740152317085e1c16665aa	put in a new switch.cost you $5 from the hardware store.|`|kjAWsDwLaa	Replacing the switch is a simple screwdriver job; just be sure you turn off the breaker or pull the fuse before working.  Maybe you're using too large bulbs in the fixtures, and the excess current has damaged the switch.  Can you use CFL (compact fluorescent) bulbs in the ceiling?  They now come in sizes up to 150 watts, but use only about 25 per cent of the power, and generate much less heat.  An alternative might be LED bulbs, which do the same thing.|`|UQWusO1waa	it is easy to replace the switch. also you put low watt bubs in not so hot. or you put compact floresent bulbs in, they make very little het at all. but i dont think you can dim them.  just buy a switch and put it in your self.<br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=how%20to%20install%20dimmer%20switch">http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=how%20t...</a>|`|Au2aI9a2aa	Replace the dimmer switch. And stop turning it on until you do.|`|L8zmQS8Jaa	First of all what went wrong?  Many dimmers are rated at 600 watts.1  It is a very special dimmer that has a higher rating and is also substantially more expensive.2 <br>  <br>  To give you an idea if your 5 fixtures had 75 watt bulbs in them this would be 5 x 75 or 375 watts.  5 100 watt bulbs would be 500 watts and now the dimmer is going to start heating up very nicely.  During brown outs voltage is lowered and the amp load will increase to compensate.  Is there some reason your voltage is being lowered? A voltage check will give this answer.  <br>  <br>  If the grounding was not done well with in installation and some line leakage exists you may be exceeding 600 watts very easily.  You would only be sure with an amprobe testing at the switch.  (amps x volts = watts) <br>  <br>  Now the fix.  You will need a new dimmer.  Then most of the new compact fluorescent bulbs are not dimmable.  This is why you also will never see a dimmer on a shop light.  However some are.  If you can find compact fluorescent bulbs that are dimmable and will fit your fixtures then use them as their wattage will be far less.  <br>  <br>  Another alternative is, if you know the level of light that is good for the room then put in a regular switch and use bulbs with a lower wattage.  You can even use some bulbs with a lower wattage and some of a higher wattage if they are not too far from each other in wattage.  <br>  <br>  You already seem to have some kind of an electrical problem.  In a normal situation, if you were handy with a screwdriver and were confident or knowledgable it might be OK to change the switch / troubleshoot the problem yourself.  However, it also might be a good idea to have the wiring checked out for voltage and amperage.  This may lead to uncovering a wiring problem that will have to be fixed.  It may be costly but you have already replaced so many dimmers that it reminds me of someone who simply puts a bigger fuse in when it burns out.  (That helps to fry insulation of wires not rated for the increased load and causes fires.)|`|aEeCCHVlaa	You didn't say what the wattage of the bulbs are, but the first thing I would do is to put lower wattage bulbs.  If you leave the bulbs on high all the time, there is no need for a dimmer switch.  Just replace it with an ON - OFF switch.  If you wish to replace the dimmer switch, locate the circuit breaker that controls those lights and turn it off.  Remove the knob on the dimmer switch by pulling/prying it off.  Remove the screws from the wall plate. Remove the screws holding the dimmer switch in the box.  Note how the three leads are wired.  Disconnect the wiring and remove the switch.  To install a new switch, reverse the procedure just describe.|`|c07v7O80aa	Changing a dimmer switch isn't much different from changing a non-dimming switch. But don't skimp on the switch. Buy the best quality in the store (and go to a hardware store (like Lowes), not the supermarket). It doesn't have to be the fanciest, but you're putting a fair load on it. I would replace it soon. There's already something going on in there. And since five bulbs of the wattage you've been using is obviously too much for the room, so drop back on the wattage and save wear and tear on the switch. If you don't really dim, except to avoid the heat, you can even do without the dimmer if you scale the bulb rating down. For instance, if you are running 60 watt bulbs, go down to 40 watt or even 25 watt, which is often fine in a five-bold fixture and a small room.<br>  <br>  You can change the switch yourself. Turn on the ceiling light, and make sure you have the controlling breaker off by testing. When the lights go out, you found the right one. A screwdriver is all you need. Make tight connections.
L8zmQS8Jaa	I am just reviewing the heat gain/loss calculations myself.  The problem is that you don't say what you have and adding an addition "green" usually has nothing to do with heat loss or gain.  <br>  <br>  Old calculations just added up windows and so much for wall and attic insulation and that's it.  Newer ones will take into consideration the items in the house that produce heat as a bi product and in larger commercial buildings the heat produced by people in the building.  <br>  <br>  The problem is that standard heating plants are put into non standard buildings.  Design is one of the cheapest phases in construction.  I would not build an addition today without taking into consideration and optimizing solar gain.  Often this means far more south facing windows than on any other side of the building.  A well designed building or addition will have minimal heating requirements.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, with some familiarity I can say, the typical Central Jersey (Mercer County?) development homes were not known for their efficiently planned or executed structures.  The winding streets of the typical development had more to do with frontage requirements than south facing windows.  You speak much of square foot area but little of current heating satisfaction, planned R values, any retro upgrade to the existing structure and current heating problems.  These are all important for determining heat loss calculations.  The only thing you can do with square foot areas is use "rules of thumb" and guesswork.  You need R values for the final product and surfaces exposed to the outside at a minimum.  The type and direction of glazing is also significant.    <br>  <br>  Even double glazed Windows on non southern exposures are a heating disaster with an R value of less than 4.  Insulating shutters can up this value to very close to standard walls.  But if you are very concerned you will be looking at some sort of SIP construction or 2x6" walls with an R value closer to 19 and attic insulation closer to 30.  <br>  <br>  A single unit vers two units for two zones often comes down to a question of ductwork.  It is easier to balance a system with two units as the unit for the upstairs can be above and pushing air down to the space below ductwork runs are short (i.e. cheaper.)  A single unit in the basement will have to have ductwork going up two floors.  Longer runs mean more heat loss and greater static pressure.  Additionally, zoning a forced hot air system requires a separate module and automatic zoning dampers.  The unit must react if either zone demands heat.  This is a level of complexity that not every hvac tech is immediately familiar with.  Service will be more problematic with a duel zone forced hot air system than with two separate units.<br>  <br>  Was your former home similar in design to the existing one?

Wool will always shrink and some textiles once they lost the fixative that takes care of the tissue when it is made in something to ware. And if you are still growing out of your clothes sooner than you think. So be careful and ask the question when you buy a new item so if it moves you will know before the first wash.

Keep ppl from coming your house with shoes on past the door as often as possible (this drags in dirt, road sand, etc).<br>  <br>  2.  Keep small rugs at each and every door that leads outside and make sure all house members know to wipe their shoes and remove their shoes.<br>  <br>  3. Sweeping 2x a day (i try to do this, at least once at night when everyones settled in for the night and sometime during the day when the flow of ppl in the house is very low).<br>  <br>  4.  Sweep under everything, couches, chairs, tables, end table, coffee tables, etc.  these may not off hand seem like they would be likely to have a lot of dirt but you can be suprised what a broom will find underneath these things.<br>  <br>  5.  Keep a hand broom (or a foxtail as we call it) and dustpan with you when you do cleaning.  this can be great for getting small spots of dirt cleaned up fast.<br>  <br>  Also i would consider some area rugs.  I've found the best things are a good broom (i have one thats angled for corners and has a comfortable grip on the broomstick), a mini broom and dustpan, a mop (really this not a big deal.  i use a Libman sponge mop that also has scrubbing bristles on one side and the sponge on the other, it works nicely); and a hand vacuum (good for picking up crumbs and other spills on the spot).|`|Ljqvfibfaa	I recommend a routine waxing of your wood and tile floors once every one to two weeks. From there decide the most effective up-keep method(s). Such as moping, sweeping and then buffering. In any case narrowing down or listing what tends to be on the floor most. (i.e., Dirt, mud, dust, animal dander, food and items which are susceptible to spilling.)This will give you a clearer vision of an effective cleaning method.|`|YqF3o0hWaa	Get everybody to leave their shoes at the door when they come in, if they don't want to tell them they all have to help with the cleaning.

Call them until they do. Now, if you still insist on doing your own pest control, knowledge is power. Learn all you can about the pests involved. The number one weapon for use on spiders is a vacuum. Physically remove all live spiders, webbing, and egg cases. A repellent applied to those areas will give you relief. Centipedes are generally a moisture issue. Decrease the moisture where you see the centipedes, maybe even use a dehumidifier and the problem may resolve itself without any chemical intervention. Pest control does not always come in a can. It comes from knowing the pests biology and using that knowledge to put stress on that pests population. Without food, water, and harborage a pest can not survive.

1taqxI72aa	-----Baking soda is a very effective cleaning agent. Cover pieces of furniture with baking soda by patting and rubbing it into the fabric. Leave it there overnight, then vacuum the furniture in the morning. You'll notice that the smell is greatly reduced or not there anymore. Throw them away: There are cases where goo has thoroughly penetrated the fabric of all the pieces of furniture, so that no amount of steam cleaning or baking soda can remove the bad odor. In this case, the only sensible thing to do is to get rid of the furniture. You may, of course, reupholster your furniture but that is not an easy task. If you want to get rid of the smell immediately, throw away the furniture or sell it to another smoker<br>  <br>  -----Cigarette smoke can condense into a goo-like substance that gets stuck in fabrics around your house. This goo-like substance is made of oil and tar ash deposits and is stubborn. It's hard to scrape off this goo when it's stuck on glasses and walls. Getting rid of this goo even becomes more impossible when it's stuck in all the fibers of pieces of furniture in your house. In this case, the easiest and most practical way to get rid of these deposits is to hire professional house cleaners. They should have a steam cleaner that can be mounted to a van to clean these tough deposits. Tell them exactly which pieces of furniture you want cleaned, so they can use the right techniques and tools. <br>   you're doubtful about the effectiveness of commercial deodorizers, try making your own cleaning formula to use on your carpets. First, fill a large container with baking soda. Next, add a few drops of essential oils and mix the solution well. Experts recommend using lavender in making your formula, but it's up to you to decide which fragrance you like best. Sprinkle your homemade formula over all your carpets, then leave it there for about four hours. Vacuum your carpets once the formula has dried and repeat then process as often as necessary.<br>  <br>  -----Wipe your walls with vinegar: Like baking soda, vinegar is an amazing cleaning agent. To clean the walls of your house, first, mix one cup of vinegar for every two cups of water. Add a tablespoon of baking soda to the mixture, making it fizz because of the chemical reaction. Soak a brush or a sponge into the mixture and wipe your ceilings and walls with it. The great thing about this homemade cleaning agent is that it cleans your walls without damaging the paint. For best results, use a commercial washer containing vinegar to wash your windows. You can usually purchase this product from organic grocery stores. <br>  <br>  <br>  ------Cigarette smell is not only the problem in your house if you've been smoking in it for a very long time. Brown and yellow goo would be stuck on your walls, windows and pieces of furniture, making your house very unattractive. One way to restore the former fragrance and beauty of your house is to just repaint it. Paint should thoroughly cover the goo from cigarette smoke for the bad odor to go away. Stop smoking: It's a no-brainer but it is the most effective way to ensure that your house will never smell like cigarette smoke ever again. Stop smoking inside your house to prevent cigarette smoke from condensing on your walls and furniture. Of course, it's best to stop smoking inside and outside your house to also improve your health. Don't hesitate to call professionals if you think all your efforts are not having any effect on the bad odor of your house. You may need to have your house cleaned several times before the cigarette smell completely goes away.|`|C1spuRsZaa	I would clean the upholstery of ALL the chairs/couches etc.<br>  <br>  Then spray air freshener, febreeze or anything else all over the apartment.<br>  <br>  Plus, sprinkle that carpet stuff on the carpet before you vacuum it always smells nice :)|`|oWb0hYG3aa	Here is your answer,this is the most effective unit i have seen that deals with cigarette smoke and other odors and leave a freshness you will love.Check the product at the site below and see if you can use it to help get rid of the smoke.try <a href="http://www.tryfreshair.com/henson" rel="nofollow">http://www.tryfreshair.com/henson</a>

Red is particular can really make a room hard to imagine in another style.|`|vvB0Etysaa	Check out the paint store.<br>  <br>  Lots of beautiful pastels colors are in style.|`|AA11043457	For a rental you usually do neutral colors like white or ivory.  If people paint it another color and you can permit that, then they should be responsible for putting it back to white or ivory before they move and it should be in the lease.  I've had some wild colors like the Hulk green and horrible dark blue.  You have to do 2 oats of sealer (more expensive than regular paint) and then the paint color to cover it.  So keep your colors neutral.  If the light brown is more of a tan then you could leave it but if you have to paint it, I'd use white or ivory. Makes the room look larger and also light and airy.  The yellow and blue bedrooms should go.  If the yellow is light could leave it but offer to provide paint for the tenant if they want to paint it white or ivory.  A red or blue bedroom would be a big turn off for me. You want to rent it and they have furniture and have colors they like. So you need your house to look like it is ready to move in and everything is ready to go.  People don't like to paint but just to move in.  You will appreciate white or ivory after a while when you see what colors people could put in there.  Keep colors light and carpets in neutral tone so their furniture will fit the colors.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Be sure to do credit checks and to check with previous landlords as to the type of tenant they are.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|WTy8I1Nvaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Here are few tips: <br>  # Selected paint colors may look different in different lights, both at daytime and at night.

4569b23a3611fb03850cd42c9f2cb6baaa	When planting strawberries it's usually a good idea to use raised beds in Full Sun because they will spread use a mixture of topsoil, sand, vermiculite (to help hold moisture),compost [compost, can be added to the soil to increase available organic matter.] and spaghnaum moss( to lighten soil and hold moisture)<br>  Use a 10-10-10 fertilizer and no fertilizer after they fruit.<br>  Strawberries will grow in almost any soil type, but prefer a sandy loam. The important soil factors to consider are adequate water drainage and abundant organic matter. Soil should be well-cultivated and free of perennial weeds. At planting time, soil should be loosened and pulverized to a depth of eight inches and kept loosened to allow runners to take root. To avoid problems with verticillium wilt, do not plant strawberries where potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants strawberries or raspberries have grown within three years.<br>  <a href="http://www.farminfo.org/garden/strawberries.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.farminfo.org/garden/strawberr...</a>|`|7royFhIgaa	Straw berries are not fussy.

54dc81bbc372d3bb6d12660dc6fc3623aa	Been thee and done that. My Mom had a central unit that was about as old as she was. It began to fail in a major way and all the replacement units of the same size were out of the question. We replaced the unit with one larger 220 unit for the main living areas and a smaller 110 volt unit for the back rooms(Spent about 250$). Choped about 80 bucks a month off the bills though we did have to put up with some noise during peak operation. My advise is to get a new unit, with warranties and try to size the unit for the space you have. Even some of the smaller units can put out a good bit of cooling under the right conditions. The newer ones are a lot more efficient than the older type units and are a lot more friendly as far as installation goes.Depending on the amount of space you have two smaller ones might do better than a single larger unit and will probably be cheaper to operate.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	They will cool a room but that's the only advantage.

So, first ask her.  If you don't trust her answer, you probably ought to be using your own protection (condom) anyway, but you should also be able to notice the string hanging out of the cervix.  If you don't, it could be a sign the IUD shifted out of the proper position to be effective.<br>  <br>  But again, if you aren't willing to just ask her or you don't believe her answer, use a condom or look elsewhere because an IUD isn't protection from an STD and if there is that little trust between you, then you aren't headed to anything healthy anytime soon, so why complicate things further?

UYaWH7a0aa	I lived in a house with oil heating - if you are smart about your temperature and consumption it's not that terrible. During the entire NJ winter last year we filled up our oil tank only 1 and a half times. The trick is knowing when you need to refill your tank and getting oil before you desperately need it. We filled ours up once before the winter at a low cost adn then our next refill only took about 1/2 and we did that mid winter. The company we used also gave us coupons for money off every so many gallons we purchased. Ask the homeowners that live there now how they like and the pros/cons of it. Ask about how much they pay to fill it each winter and their median temperature in the house. (Just fyi the house i lived in was very old and had a few drafts which we solved using draft dodgers from Target)..|`|eZDoQPg8aa	All heat is expensive now days!  They got ya coming or going!  We have oil heat and have cut the amount of oil we use each year by doing a few things.<br>  <br>  1.  Caulk all doors and windows.  If you don't know how, can't do it, get a professional.  Caulking isn't rocket science but there is a right way to do it.  Just doing all the windows and doors in this house reduced the oil bill by nearly 1/3 the next year.<br>  <br>  2.  Add insulation.  Attic, basement are two good places to start.  If adding more insulation to your walls is impractical, try using this insulating paint additive I found.  You mix this additive in with your primer or paint and it can increase the insulation value of the surface up to 32%.  I used it in an upstairs bathroom that was always cold and now we have to keep one of the heat runs closed because it gets too warm.  It's not expensive, about $12 to add the stuff to a gallon of paint.  We have an old double plank house which means we can't put more insulation in the walls without major remodeling so I'm using this stuff.  It also helps with sound, makes the paint more durable, scrubbable, sun and insect proof. <br>  <br>  3.  Use your curtains and drapes.  On cold days and nights, keep the drapes closed.  Use insulating drapes or shades.  On sunny days, open the drapes or curtains and take advantage of the passive solar gain.  In the summer, use the same curtains and drapes to keep out the heat.<br>  <br>  4.  Depending  on the age of the current boiler, plan for replacement.  The new units are so much more efficient so you will get more bang for your buck!<br>  <br>  5.  Insulate the heat ducts or pipes, no sense heating the basement when you want the heat upstairs.  This is a good do it yourself project.

nrdSl8cBaa	I agree with William about using new 1/4" plywood underlayment if you can't remove the tiles with putty knives and a heat gun or if the old tiles have asbestos content, so long as you have a wooden sub-floor to nail the plywood to. Some people used to use hardboard/ Masonite right on top of the tile, but that will cause you immediate grief if it became wet, unlike plywood.<br>  <br>  But if your existing tile is over concrete slab, I would recommend heat and floor scrapers to remove the old tiles because of the great difficulty<br>  securing the plywood unless you use subfloor panel adhesive and nails from a powder-actuated nail gun to tack it prior to placing the new tiles.<br>  The scraper method also avoids the finish detail issues you typically run into from the raised floor level like needing to remove baseboards, trim the bottoms of doors, cut around toilets, cabinets, and pedestal lavaratories, etc., which may rise to make applying new underlayment more involved a process than it may originally appear.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to a guide:  <br>   <a href="http://www.armstrong.com/content2/resam/files/17897.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.armstrong.com/content2/resam/...</a><br>  <br>  You will note they do not recommend a wood subfloor over concrete either.|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	Yes, you can, but unless you add the new sub flooring, the results may not be satisfactory.

tY1VvD2paa	From your question it is not clear if it is the MS paint application or in general any application.<br>  <br>  If it is MS paint application, the reason is simple. It is not an antialiased line and you see jagged line because in your computer the smallest unit of drawing (in layman terms) a pixel is rectangular in shape. Hence when you draw a horizontal or a vertical line you have perfect alignment of rectangles one besides/below another and you see a straight line. But if your if your line is inclined these rectangles are not aligned properly. Learn a bit about anti-aliasing and you will find out more.<br>  <br>  Best solution here is to increase the resolution of your monitor (thereby decrasing the pixel size and hence decreasing the effect of jagged lines) or to go for a s/w that does auto anti-aliasing

xQYSRDj9aa	Here are some crafty ideas that are cheap and mostly do it yourself:<br>  <br>  Collage-<br>  Find tons of pictures of your family and friends. Cut them out into various shapes. Paste or glue them to a poster board or pin all of them to a bulletin board. If you choose to to the poster board and if it is within your budget, you can frame them to keep forever. Make various collages and hang them around your room. Make sure the poster board or bulletin board is completely covered with pictures. The collages doesn't just have to be of family and friends, you can also look in magazines or print some pictures off of your computer.<br>  <br>  Personal Artwork-<br>  Paint or draw multiple pieces of artwork! Paintings can be as simple as random swirls that match the color pallet of your room. This is a way to incorporate your own personal creativity, even if you aren't the best artist! If possible-you can frame them.<br>  <br>  Black & White Pictures-<br>  Find some cool pictures on the internet that you would like to hang in your room, such as flowers, leaves, trees, animals, etc. Use a computer program to make them black and white. Print them out, hang them, and frame them!<br>  <br>  Mirrors-<br>  Search around the house for any old, unwanted, or unused mirrors. If you can't find any, ask your parents and see if they can help. Old mirrors can add a vintage flair to your room. They also make your room look larger, and more open.<br>  <br>  Search your home-<br>  Like the mirrors, search your entire home for any wall decorations that your parents wouldn't mind you taking. For example, a piece of artwork or some candle holders that go on the wall.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, be creative! The best decorations are ones you do yourself.

Another good one is Lil Mynx, it requires only one small hole in your ceiling to screw the support into, and you can take it off and leave just a plant hook, which is included to disguise the support. If you're not going to be hanging on the pole though, adult stores do sell cheap stripper poles, but you can't swing or climb on it at all. Beware of the electra pole, it's a cheap knock off version of the Lil Mynx and it won't hold your weight up consistently.

Also, wash EVERYTHING - all bed sheets and clothes and don't forget your duvet. Good Luck|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	As others have said, vacuuming is important, but you have to do it regularly to keep the mites at bay. I think the 'memory foam' mattresses are bug free...if you can afford one.|`|mFInMKSaaa	Easier to get a new bed.|`|V3b5UaXsaa	it is very hard! strip the sheets and vacuum the whole matress, both sides, spray the matress as well with a green friendly bug killer and let it dry before putting the sheets back on. This most likely won't do the trick, but it's the best shot you have in leiu of getting a new bed|`|UYaWH7a0aa	You should really buy a new matress - if not after vaccuming it and cleaning it thoroughly you should put it in a SEALED bag with no airflow this way if any are left they will suffocate and die - you should prob. keep it sealed up for at least a week ....|`|QEOx27CUaa	vacuum the mattress,make sure you get into the edging,they like to hide there,there is products you can buy also to sanitise the mattress.|`|64e6c1ff2dccc2dcfe69afb1fd71e335aa	It is nearly impossible.  Throw away what ever has them before they get in everything you own.  You will need to fumigate the room that the infected furniture was in as well to try to kill any that fell off the furniture before getting it out of the house.|`|dp4hrRkgaa	if you do not consider buying a new mattress (which is the best option by the way) try to do a thorough vacuum and put it outside under direct sunlight for a day.
02GSc87gaa	Wow, some long answers for such a simple question. <br>  <br>  I've hung more doors than I've had hot dinners.<br>  <br>  20mm between the floorboards & the door.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Ask your carpet fitter! Both carpets and underlays differ in thickness so the man fitting it will know best.|`|1nbYdXE0aa	New pre-hung doors come with a 5/8" gap from bottom of door to bottom of side jambs. I usually set the door frames up on a door shim so it's 3/6" off the subfloor. This lets you slip sheet vinyl under it and does not get it up so high.<br>  Flooring contractors can easily cut side jamb legs off with a jamb saw if need be, and carpenters can cut doors off easily as some pad/carpet is a lot higher than others. <br>  Typically the interior doors/exterior doors/windows are all framed in at the same height.|`|d94f99ad1710d80ab4587d8db787acb3aa	Anne H, you'll need an inch of clearance to accomadate the pad, carpet, and allow airflow.  The airflow is important as I doubt there are return air vents in all of the rooms.  If you don't allow for this the room will pressurize when the door is closed and there'll be alot of noise generated by the air slipping through the door & jamb and the too small of a gap under the door.<br>  <br>  Now, that being said, I don't know who's doors your swinging so if they're prehung you'll need to measure the dimension that's existing from the bottom of the jamb to the bottom edge of the door and consider that when cutting the inch for the carpeting.  Your pad(underlay) is likely 1/2" and you simply need to measure the carpet height.  Your flooring salesman should also have this info readily available.<br>  <br>  Last tip. . . I email or fax the pad and carpet height question in to the flooring company/contractor and get their response documented.  That way they'll be responsible for the doors if they don't set above finish floor height properly.<br>  <br>  Mike Lonergan<br>  TradesProfessional, Inc.<br>  <a href="http://tradesprofessional.com" rel="nofollow">http://tradesprofessional.com</a>|`|Brr6b37raa	If I am in your shoes I should wait until the carpets are lay ed first before you start to take the clearance off the door.There is a possibility that you might just take too much off the doors.|`|m5OXGrREaa	Internal doors are OK with 15 to 18mm. Don't forget most carpets will bed down and "track" in doorways so allow for this and fit tight to start  with.|`|v8XK80Ycaa	we always allow a good 3/4 inch. coz we have thick underlay. if you dont leave enough room you can plain the door off anyway. trial and error.  i'd rather take too small amount off than a whopping great chunk and be left with a massive 'gale' coming through!!
8apA3Rffaa	No one can answer , and I don t know why they they try  until we know if you have vinyl tile  or ceramic tile and where  your gluing it to and to what. Any questions you can e mail me thru  my avatar  GL|`|p59ew3dMaa	They are all pretty good.  The question is where and what kind of tiles are you setting?  The bathroom isn't a good place to set ceramic tiles on the floor or walls with glue. It's known to put the tiles on the wall with a glue adhesive.  But I don't.  You usually put Thin Set Cement.  All you have to do is add water and mix it to a soft mud consistency.  Not to wet and not to dry.  If you are putting tiles on any floor use the same method.  As far a back splash around the kitchen sink or in an area where there isn't to much traffic or water you can use any Tile Adhesive.  If you are putting linoleum down use Contact Cement.  It's a liquid based product that you can roll on.  Wait until it dries clear then set your linoleum down.  I advise you to get a good mask for this because it smells really bad.|`|4U1wzfwbaa	I'm a tile-repairman specialist, I only use the best.  Home Depot has a brand name called Omni Grip.  It maybe pricey but its the best to use when installing tiles.  It doesn't run on you and where you install the tile, the tile will stay in its place without sliding down on you.  I would not use any of the other brand.
