20090223155534AATjRsX	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Job without college education. Possible?	I'm a recent community college dropout. I have nearly enough hours to qualify for an associate of arts degree, but I just haven't gotten around to finishing that yet. I have come under increasing pressure from my parents to go out and get a job, but I don't want to get tied down into another job like the last one I had (I worked as the front desk clerk at a national hotel chain which had a location in my home town for nearly 2 years). I earned 7.50 there, which I would consider reasonable but not optimum if I were to be out on my own (I live with my parents now). I feel that I have enough skills to be paid a more competitive wage at a more secure position, but can't seem to find anything more than "box lifter needed" and other "career paths" in the local job listings (I live in a town of about 20,000 people). Is it possible for someone like me to find a job they love without a college degree, or am I doomed to wander the path of meager earning, uninteresting occupations such as "box lifter guy" and "front desk guy". I'm completely depressed and don't see any hope for myself when it comes to getting a job. Help!!!

I knw lots of unemployed friends ect... so should i jus stay and be grateful for the job? and if i left i would feel guilty because it takes around 3 months for a new person to start. I really hate it though, and although most of the staff are lovely some are not. I have tried so hard at work but the more you give the more they expect. i knw its abit pathetic asking this question to complete strangers on the web but i want a unbaised opinion plss! thank you!

I am currently in the 8th grade and everyone in my school is raving about their dream job(or at least I am, for that matter). Anyway, I have really been taking this seriously and have been on many career sites for teens(with not much success).      However, I have really considered pursuing a career in criminal justice- I have always wanted to be a detective, but of course I knew it surely wouldn't be like it's portrayed in Law & Order.  I have also considered forensic pathology, but the thought of being a lab rat doesn't seem to be a very respectable position.      What do you think about this? Is criminal justice a worthwhile field to enter?
20070221080224AAOnvkx	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Why it sucks to be hospitalized when you're middle class...?	I just went through a miscarriage, one of the worst emotional things I have ever experienced.  Worse than that, all the bills for the hospital/doctor are now rolling in.      This just isn't right, now I owe like $2000 to the hospital/doctor for the D&C procedure, even WITH insurance (which obviously sucks).      It's not fair, if you're poor in america, you're on medicaid, and wouldn't have to pay a dime for this.  If you're rich, writing out a $2000 check isn't a big deal.  But here I'm doing my best just to get by, and it's not getting easier!  It'll take me years to pay off this debt!      What in the world can I do?

Ever since I was little I loved to draw and have gotten many complements on my "natural, or God given talent". That's what some have told me anyway.. but I don't know. As much as I love art it seems unsteady and I always have to give it my full attention. I also want to really help people who feel trapped or even suicidal (because there's nothing that I feel more strongly for). I love people and I hate to see them feel helpless and alone. But I feel if I somehow did both it wouldn't work out. Like each I need to dedicate all my time too... any suggestions?

I am a young student and started my 401k last year after being told by a relative that I will be able to use the money to purchase a home without taxes and paying the 10%. I am not really sure about the rule exactly of how 401k works. It really wouldn't affect me as much in the future since im still in my young 20's. I will have time to get that money back up for retirement in no time.      So exactly what should i expect as far as fees goes? Is there any benefit to being a first time home buyer? I also dont mean to just borrow, it will be way too difficult to pay mortgage and 401k at the same time.      Thanks

20061203144208AASDkJc	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	Any employment / discrimination lawyers that can help / advise?	for the last 18 months i have felt my career has been stifled because certain (more senior) people in our team cannot perform certain key tasks, and so unduly rely on me to do those.  This in turn has meant i've been constrained from doing other tasks and i feel i have not been able to progress my career in the way that i otherwise would.       I have spoken to my boss about it several times but nothing has changed.        On top of that work atmostphere has been unpleasant for me, some colleagues are ignoring me/not speaking to me/being unpleasant - just subtle things but consistent over a period of the last 12 months.      All this is making me very depressed.  I've kept a note of issues...  But now its got to a stage where i had to go to see my GP and seek councelling and ask for anti depressants.        Its all getting too much, and i'm seriously considering quitting.  Am i likely to have a case for constructive dismissal - on the grounds of bullying and/or discrimination?

20070225192659AAeYBAZ	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	Which career path should I take? Medicine, business, or law?	I'm graduating this year to college and I don't want to go undeclared.  So heres my delima...I want a job that makes a lot of money and offers job security.        I want to be a doctor but 8 more years of school is a bit too much for me, plus physics and chemistry are not my strong points (I'm ok in bio).        I'm leaning towards business (finance) but I heard that if you're not good at it, you won't even make 50k at the height of your career even if you graduate from a good college.  Plus I'm not good in math (not that you need to major in it).  Money is definetly an issue since I want a job that will eventually give me over 6 figures.      I'm also looking to major in history/poli science and maybe become a laywer, but I'm not that good at arguing nor am I that good of a speaker.        I'm not sure what to major in college, but I do know this, I want to make money (make over 100k eventually), so which career should I realistically look towards?

20070328110323AAtcSNc	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	Washington Mutual NIGHTMARE! Please advise?	My husband and I received an offer for a line of credit with this company. The rate is 1.99 % until Dec. 2007. So, we decided to use this money to pay off the remainder of my car loan and to use the rest for emergencies and a few things we need to take care of. Well, the amount posted to our account within 5-7 days. At that point we sent off the check to my lender for the car loan and a few other bills. Come to realize that they then went in and pulled that money BACK OUT of the account and now we are in the hole by quite a great deal! Washington Mututal said the reason was that we had made the check out for the whole credit amount which was $6,000.00. They call this a double hold? No where in the fine print did it say that we were not allowed to write the check out for the full amount.....ANYWHERE! Now, they say they send these offers along all the time and we have to wait until one comes in the mail and then write a check out for about $5975.00!! This makes no sense to me!

I received a good rating but was told that I was "capped" at my salary and there has been no cost of living raises in over a year.   Then I go home, see that the Dow has hit another all time high, gas is skyrocketing, again. And basically just seeing my paycheck shrinking.   Sure my 401k is doing well, but I still have years b/f retirement.   It's like the old saying, the rich get richer while the poor get poorer.    Although I am not poor, I have job hunted and all other employers seem to be pretty close to the same in my field.   Back in the 50's a man could work 40 hrs a week, have a wife and two kids. A car and a modest home. And be doing ok as middle class.   So are we just slowly getting "screwed" and what do we do to take back our economy?

20070506230031AAjM88w	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment	I quit my job because I couldn't stand my new boss.?	I worked for this supermarket chain in Massachusetts as a Seafood Manager for 16 yr. In 2005 and in the previous years, I had great performance reviews, but last year I did not have a good one (This was the first time I was rated under-performance). As a result, I was transfered to a new store. My new boss never gave the chance to prove that I could perform better than last year. The HR person even told me that it happened before: "Everyone who comes to his store in this situation will always be an underperformer in his eyes."    I just got tired of him telling me how much I stunk, all the time. I even asked for a transfer, but he denied, so I quit.      Actually, I asked to go part-time and work for a different store -same chain- until find something else. When my manager-to-be called my former one, he must have trashed me, because I haven't heard anything about the part-time job.      Question: When I get  a new job, will my former manager be able 2 give bad references? Can he do that?

Payment protection and warantee cost a further ￡1542. apr was 42.9% (ouch i know but i was desparate and stupid). The finance charge for this loan was ￡1169 and charge for credit was ￡1519.   I cancelled the payment protection days later and recently looked to pay the loan off but couldn't find the paperwork so phoned and reduested a copy. The copy has changed so the cost of the car is stated as ￡3287 after the part ex and although the insurances have dropped to ￡547 the finance charges have increased to ￡1677 and the total charge for credit has gone up to ￡2027. The apr has also dropped to 39.1%.   I have written to and phoned the company but they cannot give me an explaination or resolution and didnt argue when I said I was going to instruct a solicitor.   What are my rights in this situation and what should i be fighting for? I know i have a case but not sure on what grounds.   Help!

I am barely able to make ends meet.    My rent is only $251 ( because I have two roommates)    Car insurance $150 a month   Cell phone $60 a month ( plus work will pay me $25 every month)   My car uses alot of gas and I use it alot for work ( which I do get reimbursed .40 cents to the mile) which doesnt help me between paychecks when I have to buy gas and I dont get reimbursed til payday.    Anyway.. basically I am not broke because I spend lots of money on needless stupid things.. I just spend my money on gas and food..and rent when it is due. SO here is my problem.. I have debt..but I never have any money to send.

I feel that, although I have no formal experience as my colleagues, I could still do a good job and have been exposed to many a leadership and management course.      However, one of my big areas of opportunity is my temper, my lack of ability to keep a poker face in the face of crisis and the fact that the Director of the department perceives my way of work as being on the insecure side.      Also, another issue that I have is that I am not confrontational, I have trouble saying no or letting someone know that they are not performing well.      In short, in spite all of these shortcomings, I am responsible, proactive and comply with deadlines. How can I overcome my areas of opportunity, so that I can be an effective supervisor

I dont know how to deal with this, I feel sick to my stomach and embarrassed. I just took nyquil because I cant even stand to think about it anymore. Some girl at work was stealing so me and another girl turned her in, but our boss didnt want to take a chance on any of us since they had a history of girl stealing so we all got fired..and when I was on the phone call after I got the news all I could say was "thanks for the opportunity to work with you guys" then said bye, hung up and started bawling. I feel like such an idiot, I thought we did the right thing, and now I dont have a job. Has anyone else been in this situation? I feel like im at war with my thoughts right now, I cant stop thinking about it and I just feel so upset, what can I do to take my mind off of this?

I have an HP Pavilion a620n desktop PC that I am considering selling to my friend. The PC has been upgraded with an additional 512 MB of RAM,a floppy drive,an Nvidia GeForce FX 5200 video card,and a Soundblaster 5.1 surround sound card(not sure of the exact model). Everything thing else on the desktop is pretty much much what came from the factory.    I am also selling the PC with an Acer AL1951 19" LCD monitor,a Logitech 5.1 surround sound system,a Logitech wireless mouse and model Y-RK56 wireless keyboard,and a Sony dual DVD-RW external drive(model number DRX-820U). Keep in mind all the items previously mentioned,including the PC,are in excellent condition. I was thinking somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 for everything but what would be the most I could expect to get for everything?
