We had a load of snow last night and today. There's a few inches of it on the floor, but a lot of it on the roads is slushy and all the pavement snow has been flattened and looks black and icy. We've been forecast a little snow overnight tonight, but the temperature's gonna be low. Schools got sent home Monday, and we were off today cause of the snow. Do you think it'll stay here overnight, meaning we won't go in? I go to a fairly big school, with a long drive, and there's only one caretaker there as far as i'm aware, so i dont think he could clear it himself. If it freezes over, i'm sure we'll stay off. The sun has basically gone now, and it's getting colder. What do you think the chances of being in school are tomorrow?
