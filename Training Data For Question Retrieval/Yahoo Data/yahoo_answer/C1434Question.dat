20090130100335AAZSvcY	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	The Vivid Dreams of Pregnant Women?	"There is a greater amount of actual dreaming and dream recall when a woman is pregnant than at any other time during her life," says Patricia Garfield, PhD. "The dreams will relate to her condition of pregnancy, the trimester she is in, and what is going on in her body at the time."      I had just looked this up and i am almost positive i'm pregnant this whole month i have been having symptoms. I took two tests yesterday both neg. and i'm going to the doctor later today, but last night i had a dream i had a miscarriage. Does that mean it really happened if i'm having dream about it????? I am sooo scared!

20090130145001AAXwhKI	Social Science;Psychology	What's wrong with me? ?	I don't think I have schizophrenia, because I don't have hallucinations or hear voices telling me to do things inside my head. These are a few things I have noticed about myself:   When someone says something to me, my face doesn't respond with an expression, it's just blank.   I isolate myself from my friends because I get annoyed with human contact.   I love to take walks, and I have read that this can be a symptom for schizophrenia, something about taking walks that lead you nowhere.   I suddenly feel angry when there's absolutely no reason to.   I'm withdrawing into myself.   I feel suddenly depressed sometimes.      What's wrong with me?

20090130145743AAQ5HAB	Social Science;Psychology	My dads an alcoholic and i don't know how to help him!?	He's always been a drinker but i never really came to turns with it until recently (i've just turned 20). It's payday today and he sneaked out the house to go down the pub as usual, he picked my 8 year old brother from school today (mum was working) and took him to the pub afterwards! I had to drag it out of him because even as an 8 year old knows it was wrong and didn't want to tell anyone. I know, family all know, my boyfriend knows, everyone does. Me and my brother are closest to my dad, probably because my mum and sister have moaned at him about it, so i think it's time i said something. I don't want to moan at him, i know it's not all his fault (he gets soo stressed at work to provide what ever we want, high profile job). I don't know how i should go about talking to him/what i should say so i'm not blaming/scaring him if you know what i mean. I know that alone won't make him get help, but i feel it'll be a great start. I really think he would listen to me more he does really listen to me more than others i would say (especially since i've just started a psychology degree). HELP!!!

20090130152439AAxybY1	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do I have to be a feminist or an anti-feminist? Why can't I be an anti-bully?	I am against all kinds of bullies of all flavors and from all political/social/religious ideologies. When I criticize feminism I don't criticize the average feminist, I criticize the figurehead bullies who run the ideology. I criticize the bullies in both misogynist and misandrist cultures, I criticize and reject all forms of bullying. It is the same with religion, I criticize the bullies who run things, not the average follower who usually is not bullying anyone but does follow a bullying religion organized by bullies. Why is that bullies are often in positions of power? Why are bullies so influential and manipulative? If we all truly believe in human/civil rights for all people and if we really practice what we preach, why don't we all become anti-bullies?

20090130183416AAfsNky	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Are men subconsciously afraid of the female body?	I read an interesting section from Caroline Knapp's anorexia memoir "Appetites" and want to see what others think:      "...men are and always have been profoundly ambivalent about women's bodies, which can evoke powerful and deeply contradictory strains of feeling: A women's body sparks awe at her life-giving power and also terrible fear of that power; it calls up primal feelings of love and need (for a mother's care, comfort, nurturance) and also infantile feelings of helplessness, dependency, and rage; it generates a longing for surrender, a wish to return to the safe harbor of a mother's omnipotence, and also a deep terror of surrender, which so threatens male autonomy and control. "This multitiered ambivalence," Gilmore writes, "creates an uncomfortable and endless tension at every psychic level, which leads to efforts to diminish the source of the turmoil by attacking its source: women."      Agree? Disagree? There is also a section where she points out how religious texts and many cultures regard the female body as a source of evil and point it out as something disgusting/sinful, for whatever that's worth.

Can this dream be a message from God or even worse Satan?

20090130185714AAcrTwd	Social Science;Psychology	Why am I picking fights with my husband?	I don't know why I'm doing it (he doesn't have to tell me at all), but I've been picking fights and pushing his buttons every night for the past couple weeks. And I just did it again 20 minutes ago.      I breastfeed and don't like my breasts touched, last night he started caressing them during foreplay and I had a fit. It ruined the mood (my coniption fit ruined it). Tonight, I messed around with him in the shower by turning the water to cold (I was in the shower, too) he played back by turning it to hot. But when I went to touch him he pushed me- I got really mad because we were in the shower and I almost fell. When I got angry, he says I start it and then turn it on him. BUT I NEVER try to HURT him.       He's also been doing airhead stuff lately (like: my son threw up a bit and he wiped his mouth with a Clorox Disinfecting Wipe! ) and I yell. Or I ask him to help with one of the kids and he ignores them (and me) for about 5 minutes- by then, the situation has turned to a tantrum or extreme crying (from my 2 year old or 2 1/2 month old). I get mad.       We don't want to watch the same things on TV, we go to bed around 9-10pm. Our kids are asleep by 8:30. Our weekends are very busy with our parents and running my son around to see his biological dad.       My husband is ULTIMATELY a PERFECT guy. But I feel I pick at him to create fights and tension and problems. I don't want to. Everyday I tell myself to be nice, not to yell and treat him good. He does everything for me. But, somehow I cant help myself and bug him. Why am I creating problems in a good marriage??? Why am I sabotaging this?

20090130185844AAHubqC	Social Science;Psychology	How do I deal with math anxiety and another episode of depression?	I suffer from depression and it was 6 years since I was severly depressed.  I got therapy and haven't been so depressed since.  Well, recently, I relasped and had another depression episode but it only lasted at least a month.  I've always had problems with math my whole life in school.  I took off from school for 5 years because of anxiety and depression.  Now I'm back and suddenly, I'm working much harder and doing much better in math.  Last semester, I relasped and had another bad episode of depression becuase of a lot of things and because I was so tired from studying so much.  I told myself I'd take it easy this semester and study but not too hard.  Well, I slacked off last week because I wasn't motivated and got behind.  Now I'm rushed to finish everything this week and also afraid of getting really depressed again which could make things worst.  I was lucky I passed last semester!  How do I deal with this?  How do I motivate so I don't get behind, and how do I not get too hard on myself without going another episode again?  I'm so stressed to get a good grade but the fact that I got really depressed makes the stress worse because I'm afraid of getting depressed again.  I know I'm too hard on myself and probably slacked off last week because I had more confidence that I'm doing better in math.  Now suddenly after being so rushed and afraid of another episode, I'm not so confidence anymore.

20090130190625AAif6XA	Social Science;Psychology	... Eating disorders?	I've always have had major body image issues. My eating habits are not normal. I'm fourteen years old. Last year I used to look at pro-anorexia websites and would eat very little. I even purged a couple times and exercised excessively. I got down to 105 lbs and then gained it back over the summer. I never eat at school, but when I get home I eat junk food. My mom used to make me a lunch but I'd throw it out at school. People would ask me why I never ate and I said I was too lazy to make a lunch. I feel like I'm better than everyone else who eats at school. I don't know why. I eat snacks and candies our teacher occasionally give us, but I never eat lunch. My best friend at school is very thin and tall. She always talks about being fat and wanting to go anorexic even though she always eats and doesn't know much about eating disorders. She has poor self-esstem, which rubs off on me sometimes. I'm actually overconfident with everything else, but my body. Now I eat whenever and snack all the time even though I feel bad about it. Except at school. I want to lose more weight. A girl at school said something last week about me "getting bigger." That bothered me. I've never talked about this with anyone and I don't even know what the point of this "question" was. I just want to know if you think there's something wrong with me?

I have dreams sometimes where I am blind and I love it, I don't want the dream to end.  A few times when I was home alone I blind folded myself and just did things around the house as if I were blind.  I know it sounds ridiculous to wish for something like this.  I should be thankful that I have vision but I can't help this longing I have.        I want to know if anyone else has these same feelings and why...

It was purely the number "7787" written in bright red letters with a tinge of blood red at the bottom left hand corner on a stark white background.    An additional note was the 8 was slightly lower than the 3 7's and from the bottom left hand corner the 8 began to run like dripping red paint...slowly.    eventually a panting spider appeared that moved from right to left across the top, carefully avoiding the numbers, the spider was black and yellow...looked like a real spider, but made panting noises, no web.    also, after the first couple months i had this dream there were chime sounds very non-harmoniously in the background.    help please.

20090130180514AA3nCx4	Social Science;Economics	Is the economy really THAT bad?	I want thoughts about this...I still see help wanted ads in the paper.  The business that I work for is doing well, sure, winter is always slow. But what are people looking for? To be rich? Just this last week my boyfriend and I were able to sell a vehicle online just fine. At asking price.  Is this recession just a hype? I mean people are still going to the movies, buying video games for crying out loud.  If we were in a recession would people really be spending money on these useless items? Consumerism is coming back to bite us in the bum.  Would it hurt people to instead reach out to their community and donate to a family in need rather than buy that manicure?  I've done it myself, just last week.  Could that $40 that I spent on a purse just have well been given to a family who just got laid off? I think the situation of needy families is only as bad as we let it get.  We need to start thinking of others.

20090130184304AA2Ii23	Social Science;Psychology	Addicted to marijuana? Chose that over family?	I was with someone for 10 years and we both smoked marijuana. I was 19 when we got together and didn't think our marijuana use was going to be a "lifestyle" and continue indefinitely. In fact the two of us had discussions in which we talked about how we wouldn't be smoking indefinitely.       I developed severe anxiety and depression, I believe, as a result of the daily marijuana use and quit shortly before conceiving our son. My partner continued to smoke pot and although he said he cut back I could tell he was smoking it more often then he was letting on. He began hiding it and lying about it.       I understand the point that some people make about how I knew he smoked marijuana when we got together and "shouldn't have expected him to change", but I was surprised how much my priorities changed after having our son and couldn't have foreseen the significance of that event in my life and how it affected how I wanted to conduct myself (the type of example I wanted to be).      Anyway, I noticed my ex growing increasingly restless in our relationship, we began arguing more, he said my wanting him to quit smoking marijuana was me just trying to "control" him and he was seemingly fighting for his "freedom". I was alarming how completely resistant he was to quitting marijuana. I think it was then I realized he was psychologically addicted, in my opinion.       He grew distant, we argued and ultimately he ended up leaving the relationship and I discovered he'd been spending time with a 20 year old female coworker (he's 34) and the two had grown close and he was hiding that. He denied anything happened until after he left, saying they only talked and smoked marijuana together.      Is it normal for someone in their mid-thirties to be so resistant to stopping smoking pot when they have a family? Or is a sign of addiction? I'm still having a hard time with the fact that I feel the pot was the breaking point in the relationship for him.       He says he likes living his life that way and had to break free of my wanting to "change him" because I was asking him to quit.
20090130190401AAvfbIE	Social Science;Psychology	How do i get rid of demeaning nicknames?	I am tall, quiet, shy, pale and skinny. My best friends in the whole wide world have been giving me terrible nicknames lately. I don’t know what to do and what to say. So first they just talk about me being so tall but that doesn’t bother me that much. I am a quiet person and I have been because I seem to never say the right thing so I’m so use to being so quiet. So the nickname they call me when they talk about me is "the quiet one" or "the silent one". When I meet people I get shy and I don’t say much which encourages my friends to use the nick names. They do get on me for being quiet and it’s so dam embarrassing because they basically just gang up on me but it’s hard to change something that I have been doing almost all my life. They don’t really understand because they are basically the opposite. So now they also get on me for being pale. I have fair skin and I have a high chance of skin cancer and I rather be pale then have cancer. So I choose to be pale and they don’t understand my decision and I would rather be health then be using 15 SPF sun block and be getting burned. Now the part about me being skinny. I’m just like my mother I’m skinny; I have freckles and use to have a gap. I’m so skinny that my bones show and it’s hard for me to gain weight because of my metabolism; I can’t really do much about it. They always point it out almost every day and people I don’t know do it too and it hurts. I don’t really need people to state the obvious and say “Oh, you’re so skinny you can see you bones”. How the heck do you think that makes me feel and how am I suppose to respond to that? Honestly I’m still not comfortable with my body and I do battle depression. My friends have given me this horrible nickname that is extremely offensive “Holocaust Survivor”. I hate it; she they had said that to someone else I still would be offended by it. They are starting to say it during school and I’m too quiet to say something. They also joke about me looking like I am anorexic or bulimic which is irritating. People have actually asked me and its very serious disease; so it should be joked about. So it’s hard for me to have the people close to me saying this stuff and I just don’t know what to do?

For instance, one of my ex workers confided in me about her love (in great detail) and everything else and I only knew for about a month. Another example, I contacted an old high school acquaintance on myspace. I didn't expect  him to respond so fast, but he did. Anyway, within an hour he was telling me his life story and then from then on he comes to me with his problems.Mind you haven't spoken in 12 years. I have a lot other examples, but those are the ones that stuck out in my mind the most.

20090130193144AAseHTQ	Social Science;Psychology	Do you ever feel so different from everybody?	At my job I'm probably one of the only few that doesn't drink, smoke, and/or do drugs.  I'm also probably one of the only few that is celibate.  I'm not ashamed of that but I just feel left out.  In my World History class at school I answered a question that my teacher asked me and several people disagreed with my answer.  I feel as though I think so differently from others.  Another example of this is when someone at work told me that people only change if they want to.  I disagree.  I think that some people can change just to please others such as friends and family, not themselves.  Anyways, does anybody else feel this way or is this all just something I feel?

Not to mention, I went to jail just recetly.  I'm looking at life like it's a big defication hole and I'm stuck in the worst of it. I've prayed day and night. I've also took the step to get baptized but the devil is still riding me to my grave.  I need a higher power to help me but I need the help of others to pray for me. I would cry but the tears are empty with no hope for coping. I can't deal with the pain anymore. I was recently put on suicide watch by the doctors and my counselor. It's like I'm moving in slow motion. Is it bad karma or am I paying for sins I may have commited. Somebody please pray for me. Just need alittle advice to help cope and that's why I came to this website because I hope someone with the right words could give me hope.  Is this my mortality? Will I suffer for the rest of my life? Can any one help me? Now I have lost the guidance of the ones close to me. No one wants to be close to a falling person. Why when things get tough for someone people turn their backs faster than I can recall. I'm lost in this war with the devil and I don't know anymore.

20090130200455AAAKnRO	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	My little brother died, what do the dreams mean?	Almost a year ago, April 3, 2008, my 16 year old brother died on his 4-wheeler.  It was a very tragic and unexpected accident and it devastated myself and my family very much.  Well since his death I have had 2 dreams about him.  I cant remember exactly what they are about but I do remember being really happy in my dream.  I can feel him, touch him, smell him, kiss him, etc.  I remember laughing and playing around like we used to when he was alive.        What does this mean?      My mom still hasn't had a dream about him but she did say one night she was sleeping and thought she could smell him, she didn't open her eyes because she didn't want it to go away.        I don't think my dad had dream about him, if he did he doesn't remember but he is taking this the hardest.  My dad cries almost every single day.  I cry too but I feel like I have become much stronger for my parents, and I believe my mom cries at night every so often also.      So anyways, back to the dream....does anyone know what this means??  Dreaming about him, laughing, having fun?  I heard this is how the deceased speak to you, through your dreams.  I LOVE having these dreams because when I wake up I am really happy and I have a great day, but I just want to understand this more...and after a year why only 2.  I also hear about people not having dreams for years and years.  I don't want this to happen, I love dreaming about him.
