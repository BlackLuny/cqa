20090307102210AAc9JzC	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Had my drink been spiked?	I was out drinking yesterday, and started out with one cider at the pub, then went to a friend's for cocktails which had vodka and Archer's in them, and then we decided to go to a bar in town where I had a Jack Daniel's and coke. I was fine up to the point where I had about a quarter of a glass of some red drink that wasn't mine, and I don't know if it was that, or the large amount I'd had to drink already that made me pass out and throw up. All the people I was with had had exactly the same, they think it was the weird drink I had. We don't know what it was, and I only drank it by mistake because I picked up the wrong glass. But I was in a proper state.

20081002153259AAhtspS	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Work at an organiation that tests on animals ?	I have been a vegetarian for about seven months and am becoming more of an animal rights activist.  I work at an academic institution (a university) which does test on animals including in the department for which I work.  I am on the administrative support side, and do not even see the animals, though prior to becoming vegetarian I would occasionally order  pigs and mice for testing (others ordered dogs and newts, but fortunately I did not).  I am also interviewing for another position on campus that does testing on animals as well.  My priorities of coarse are keeping my family fed, so I must work.  With the economy the way it is, quitting would be impossible.  Basically, is it unethical for me to work at an institution that tests on animals even though I do not work with the animals, nor do I purchase them anymore.  Can I administratively support the organization without being ethically responsible for the deaths of these animals?

I followed this recipe that I found online:      INGREDIENTS    1 cup shortening    1 1/2 cups white sugar    2 eggs    2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour    1 teaspoon baking soda    2 teaspoons cream of tartar    1/2 teaspoon salt    2 tablespoons white sugar    2 teaspoons ground cinnamon       DIRECTIONS   Preheat oven to 400 degrees F    In a medium bowl, cream together the shortening and 1 1/2 cups sugar. Stir in the eggs. Sift together the flour, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture until well blended. In a small bowl, stir together the 2 tablespoons of sugar, and the cinnamon. Roll dough into walnut sized balls, then roll the balls in the cinnamon-sugar. Place them onto an unprepared cookie sheet, two inches apart.    Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Edges should be slightly brown. Remove from sheets to cool on wire racks.       I followed it step-by-step and the cookies are burnt at the bottom and not expanding at all.  Basically, the way I roll it and put in the oven is the same way it comes out as.  What am I doing wrong??      Can it be that I did not sift the dry ingredients? Or can it be that I used vegetable shortening instead of butter shortening??

I'm turning thirteen, and my parents said that either I can get a cool party with a few kids, or just a really big birthday present and no party. So pretty much I'm asking for ideas on what type of party (or present, if you think the second option is better) I should ask for. I recently went to a Laser Tag party and that was a lot of fun, but I don't want to copy, and my parents don't want to spend that much money (plus, laser tag is mainly for bigger groups of kids). I have a laptop, I like music, and I love reading...there's this rule my parents have that if they spend a lot of money on something for me, it has to be something I'm going to be using regularly. So can you think of any presents that would go with someone that has my hobbies?      Thanks,   Girl.
