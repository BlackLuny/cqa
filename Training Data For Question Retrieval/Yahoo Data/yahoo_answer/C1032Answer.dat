HlD9dRF2aa	Slow and easy does it.  Try running at a conversational pace -- that's Zone 2 or low Zone 3 to build baseline endurance.  See how long you can do it without walking. <br>  <br>  Assuming that would be around 20 minutes, increase time by 10% per week and try to jog/run at least 3x a week so that you can build endurance instead of just maintaining.  In 2 or 3 months you should be approaching 10K territory.  Remember, keep it easy and steady to avoid injury -- no macho man sprints or impromptu racing to impress a "Trail Nymph" (Yeah, the really good looking girl that runs a 7 min mile and laughs as she passes you like you were standing still.)|`|fTLOk6hUaa	i recommend taking it slow at first and working your way up to at least a mile try for two, but slowly challenge yourself to improve. alo of ppl will give up as soon as their sides start to hurt or gett out of breath but if you want to improve faster you have to force yourself to keep goin through it. i say if your not throughin up you havent ran far enough

1nJFqRceaa	(((it looks like a lot of information but it isnt......i just explian everything that I do. )))))<br>  <br>  hey man, it really depends on where you are fishin.  if you are fishing in a river, find a place where the rier bends or where the water runs off into a little pond or sorts.  the ol kitty kitty isnt too big on current so the catfish will find places where the water  has almost no current.  besides that it is regular fishing from there on.  If you have a boat you might want to see if it is legal to run a trout line.  I love doing that at night.  These are a few things that i take with me when i go fishing, a 3 inch or 6 inch glowstick (you know the ones that you crack in the middle and give them a shake and they glow. I take along a good #3,4,5 trebble hook.(all depends on the size of cat you are going after).  I use a good sized spinning reel with a heavy braided line (i have an assortment of spinners one with 40 lb braid another with 50 lb braid and the other 2 have 60 lb braid) a catfish is actually smart and if you hook up to a big one they will try to drag you into all kinds ofstuff you need a good line that will snatch them out.  And i like a good medium action to heavy action rod anywhere from 7 to 9 foot is fine.  and get you a container of chicken livers.  now with the livers keep them on ice and bring along a good sharp knife.  keeping the livers good and cold keeps them from getting all mushey and they hold together better.  oh yea i also take along a 3 ounce weight.  all depending on if there is current or how much current depends on how much weight you add to keep the biat at the bottom.  ok here we go.  on the very bottom end of your fishing line tie on your weight.  now about a foot to a foot and a half  above the weight tie the line into a little loop. just big enough for you to run a tag line through it.  get you another piece of line about a foot and a hlaf to 2 foot long and tie it onto that loop. if you do that, what you just made was a single hook leader, cheaper than buying one huh.  ok at the end on the tag line tie on your trebble hook.  trust me you want a trebble hook.  the liver stays on ALOT better and you have 3 times more snagging ablility than you would with a regular hook.  now all depending on how deep it is lets say it is 4 foot deep tie on your glow stick about 5 foot above the weight.  not only will you have a lighted bobber but you will also have a light that draws bait fish.  ok now you have your rig set up now get a knife (please let it be a sharp one) and pull out a piece of liver out of the (ice cold cooler that you have with your livers) 9 times out of 10 you get a piece of liver the thing is too big.  take you knife and just quater the liver.  you do not need the whole thing.  quatering it give you enough to cover the hook and then it also takes the number of livers you have mulitply it by 4.  take a piece of liver and hook it to one of the hooks and then wrap the trebble hook with the liver and once you have it wrapped push down on the liver getting the hook god and imbedded into the liver.  now you have a great catfish rig. that holds the bottom and still allows the bait to float around on the top of the surface and keeps the bait out of the mud.  man i hope that helps you out a bit good luck good fishin be safe and remember to share the experience|`|xApAWlshaa	Tell you the truth.the man before me was right in day or night the #1 sense they use to find food is smell.they will smell for corn or the smelliest thing in the lake.The level of determination that the cat has for the bait depends on how bad or how smelly it is.so if you mix rotten eggs moldy cheese bad milk garlic oyster sauce sour cream chicken liver +blood saurcraud hotter hot sauce ranch dressing pickle juice chitlin juice vinegar juices onions and grease would cause every catfish in the ocean to come running.(not the ocean but you get the point.)|`|hqZ3ynGZaa	CATFISH, will eat a mant types of baits.<br>  contrary to popular beliefs, a bait DOESN'T have to be smelly, to get a catfish to eat it.<br>  I personally, have caught more catfish on frozen shrimp, fresh cut fish & earthworms, than on stink baits|`|eL268hETaa	Best thing to catch them with is canned corn kernels ;-)|`|aUAg83NDaa	go to your local apt complex or trailer park get yer self sum wings and beer set up just after dark about thirty feet from the dumpster crack a beer eat a wing then tie the bone to the end of your line no hook thats mean cast close to the cover and use the jerk stop twitch retrieve when you see one stop twitch then set the bone loosin the drag a little its a great time remember catch and release lol|`|6YJfHgksaa	depends where you are fishing? river...lake...pond? best suggestions i know is fish on the bottom and use chicken livers for bait, they are pretty stank and nasty but catfish love em

There will most likely only be a ban against MFG at this point and many believe it will not get passed.

To attempt to ban all guns in a country that includes the right to keep and bear arms in the bill or rights would be political suicide. However restrictions and taxes can, and probably will, be put in place. I expect ammunition will be taxed a great deal more and the government will try to limit the size of magazines. I also expect that the ownership of certain type of firearms will be prohibited without expensive permits or tax stamps. I don't really have important plans regarding gun laws. I will probably purchase a larger magazine or two before a restriction is put in place. If a bill related to gun control is presented and I find it important, I may write my state representatives a few letters. But I, like most people I know, do not have any plans.|`|5pejaYlAaa	In case of a firearms total ban by the current president I will be a criminal, they will not take my guns no matter what, they will not violate my rights. If a ban is attempted there WILL be a revolution, there is already alot of take about it now and it will grow and you will see a second civil war in the US. Obama knows this and will not attempt such a stupid move no matter how bad Nancy Palozi wants it. I have the right to protect my family, my property, my rights and I can not do it with a sling shot.|`|ZYOJQdjyaa	Excellent question! It is my understanding, however, that the 'right to keep and bear arms' relates to a time in which the Colonies did not have an army and it was therefor the duty of the American citizen to be prepared to defend the country from outside forces. Switzerland has as many or more guns per capita than the USA for the same reason and yet is not rife with gun-based violence to the degree the USA is represented as having accomplished. <br>  <br>  Since there is now a military, then there is no longer any reason except nostalgia to reinterpret the Constitution to state that one has the right to keep and bear arms for whatever purpose one deems 'necessary' - the Founding Fathers would probably have some choice words for the current situation. I tend to gravitate more toward the Right to Free Speech and Free Assembly... negated by the Patriot Act - where were all the guns-for-freedom then? <br>  <br>  As a friend of gun owners & users on both sides of the Canadian/American border, I think that unless close attention is paid to the wording of the Act innocent people will be made to feel like criminals while the real criminals continue to use stolen and/or unregistered firearms in the pursuit of crime - most recently collectors have been targeted by thieves with access to gun club lists.. Perhaps the American government has learned something from the Gun Registry fiasco the Canadians just went through and the US program may be more successful. However I do not believe that ordinary citizens necessarily NEED a gun, and their prevalence has increased the number of deaths attributable to fits of rage: it's all too easy when one is angry to use a firearm. If citizens do not demonstrate proper practices then the modern Nanny State will intervene - anarchy doesn't mean might makes right, it means that individuals weigh the consequences of their actions and behave civilly without needing to be told to.<br>  <br>  I am sorry that so many people are angry about it, but it was bound to happen sometime. I am curious and do plan to do more research, but really? A full ban? Or would it be a ban on specific types of weapons and/or the number of firearms one could own? A full ban would indeed be impossible to enforce, leaving only the issue of civilians with firearms designed for the theatre of war being used to hunt unarmed animals, and where's the fun in that?|`|fXTcFuUjaa	The reason for the Second amendment is to control the government from being able to take all of your rights, I will protect my right!!!!

I have the same problem but then i remember its colder at the mountain. and i dont think a mild day is bad. sometimes it would rain but it usually snows!! :)
LIKkt8djaa	I highly suggest not buying boots online without at least first having tried them on. Theirs a good chance the boot may not fit your feet properly and have bad pressure points. Something I suggest doing is trying on a bunch of different brands with your boarding socks on, make sure you walk around and even do some hops in them. You want to make sure they fit very snug, your toes should just be touching the end of the boot but shouldn't be crunched. <br>  <br>  Also another thing most new people don't know is that when picking a snowboarding boot size you typically downsize one full size from your normal shoe size. You do this because one as I listed above the boot needs to fit snug and also with time and use the boot will actually pack out, so if you buy a new boot that is already loose it will only become looser with time and use, negating control over the board.|`|CpYiJOB8aa	i have a size 9 foot but my boot (which is a burton boot) is a size 10.5|`|35face19fd15aa04efb8daf43a67e450aa	Go to a store and try out some boots in person if you aren't bedridden.  You definitely don't want the boot to be too small.  It will be impossible to use.  When you go to a store to try out the boot (or a similar one) make sure you have the socks you will be wearing.<br>  <br>  Again, you don't need to try the exact boot.  Try to find another Burton 10.5 at the store.  Some stores will let you buy them, try them, and return them.  So if you really want to take advantage of them, you could do that, and then buy your online pair.|`|GVuTWQ6Aaa	In Burton Progression boots, I wear a size 8.5, and burton's new Foot sizer we get for the LTR Center rental shops, says that's what I need and that's what does fit me.. but my personal boots are Cheap Snowjam boots and a size 10.5, and fit me good.... my normal shoe size is 10..   It's probably best you buy local and try them on|`|NsQmnLbDaa	well idk , i have a size 12 shoe but i use a size 11 boot|`|p3qMXuPGaa	First off don't ever double up on socks it creates more problems than its worth.  By doing that it won't wick the moisture away from your foot but instead trap it causing your feet to get cold.<br>  <br>  Second in 80% of snowboard boots there's no real thing as a half size.  They can claim it but unless its a true 1 to 1 lasting its the exact same shell and liner as the whole size the only difference is the stock insole sits a little lower so you get just a hair bit more space.<br>  <br>  Honestly don't buy online regardless of how good of a deal you think you're getting you're not getting a proper fit.  I dealt with people that are doing what you're doing all season.  Its fun telling someone they bought a boot too big and no amount of added foam is going to make it fight right.  Boots are your most important piece of equipment you will ever own. General rule of thumb is size down from your street shoe size not size up.  90% of most people that snowboard are in a boot that's too big for them.<br>  <br>  Now some people are saying go try on a boot from the same maker and it'll fit the same.  That's not the case every companies models run completely different.  The best thing to do is try the exact boot on or if you are buying online at least do it from some place that has a great return policy.
dfBwVxXFaa	center fire has a primer in the center of   the case that ignites the powder inside, and a rim fire does not, it can be hit by the fireing pin anywhere on the rear of the case to ignite the powder.|`|PnS3wHQiaa	The real difference is in the cartridges. In order to understand the answer to this, you must understand how a bullet is propelled out of a gun. A bullet is fired when the firing pin strikes the chemical primer on the end of the cartridge opposite the bullet, which ignites the main powder charge and the expanding hot gases from the explosion of gunpowder force the bullet down the barrel. A centerfire cartridge will have the primer located in a small button in the center of the bottom of the casing, whereas a rimfire cartridge will have the primer in a ring around the bottom rim of the casing. So, a centerfire rifle will use a firing pin that strikes the bottom center of the casing of a centerfire cartridge, and a rimfire rifle will have a thin hammer that strikes the bottom edge of the casing of a rimfire cartridge. Rimfire cartridges include the .22lr and .17hmr and are usually small and relegated to target practice or the hunting of small game, whereas all other hunting and military rifles and most pistols fire centerfire cartridges.|`|PmjeWyn2aa	Centerfire, the pin hits the bullet in the center of the bullet.<br>  Rimfire, the pin hits the edge (rim of the bullet).<br>  <br>  You will not see a high powered rimfire rifle.

The firing pin hits the rim of the cartridge to ignite the powder in the case.  Most all rim fires any more are .22 (.22 CB, .22 short, .22long, .22 Long Rifle, or .22 Magnum) or .17 (.17 HMR or .17 HM2).<br>  <br>  Centerfire has a primer in the center of the cartridge case.  Firing pin hits the center of the cartridge case.  You large caliber rifles and high velocity rifles are centerfires.|`|O3TuQZItaa	Lets step back in time just a little bit, and then we will come to the present day.<br>  <br>  You may have heard about cap and ball guns, such as the revolver that Colt invented. This used a device called a percussion cap. These are thin cups of copper, filled with an explosive mixture. They were placed over what was called a nipple, and when struck, the explosive was crushed between the cup and the nipple, starting the firing process.<br>  <br>  The first successful cartridges were a modification of the percussion cap. A guy by the name of Flobert had the idea of sticking a bullet in the end of the percussion cap and making a cartridge. To make it work he flattened out the end of the cap making a small rim. In his guns, the entire end of the cartridge was crushed by the hammer.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.oldammo.com/july04.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.oldammo.com/july04.htm</a><br>  <br>  This cartridge was then developed into the Rimfire that we know today. There have been some very high power rimfire cartridges, some even getting into military usage. The Swiss and Italians use a .41 cal rimfire cartridge that put out a fair amount of power.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.swissrifles.com/ammo/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.swissrifles.com/ammo/index.ht...</a><br>  <br>  In rimfire cartridges, the cartridge is fired by crushing a portion of the rim. While a pain in the rear, they can and have been reloaded. Some people will make a tool to remove the dent in the base of the case, others just spin in the new primer compound and leave it at that.<br>  <br>  Centerfire cartridges developed in the 1860s. There are two major types, the Boxer Primed and the Berdan Primed. To the shooter, there is no practical difference, the primer is installed in the center of the base of the case, and the firing pin strikes the primer cup. This by the was is a very straight desendent of the percussion cap. The difference between the two systems is where the "anvel" is located. In a Boxer primer, it is part of the primer, and there is a single flash hole in the base of the case. In the Berdan, the anvel is formed as part of the case and there are two or more flash holes. The funny thing is, Berdan was an American and his priming system is used in Europe. Boxer was European, and his priming system is used here in the states. The Boxer cases are much easer to reload, the flash hole is in the very center of the base of the case so to get the primer out, all you need do is stick a punch through the hole and drive the primer out. <br>  <br>  If you want more info, take a look at this site:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_ballistics" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_ba...</a>|`|dpSr0icwaa	basics of a cartridge:<br>  <br>  You have a case that holds everything, it is filled with gunpowder and a bullet is seated on top.

About the only cartridge that is still around is the 22 and it's family.  Hence, when people say rimfire, they often mean 'a small gun, with almost no recoil, good for shooting targets, tin cans, and rabbits'<br>  <br>  when people say centerfire they are normally refering to a deer rifle or a handgun with enough power to be used against humans.|`|vsRjnbTfaa	centerfire cartridge has a primer in the center of it.

This will fine tune your gun and make it much more smooth and reliable.|`|dpSr0icwaa	that sounds like a fairly good deal<br>  <br>  yes, any stock 1911 grip will work on your 1911...the chambering really isn't relevant.<br>  <br>  I like 38 super, it is a real great round.  It could be called a 9mm magnum, as it fires the same exact bullet just with a lot more gunpowder behind it!   But it isn't terribly common.  As long as you can find ammo it will be an effective means for self defense.<br>  <br>  I'd not put on ANY accessory until you understand what they are and if they fit what your needs are.  Sadly, I've seen guys who don't understand what they are adding and why who alter the trigger to fit a longer finger then talk about getting a new beavertail and backstrap specially suited to smaller hands....when I point out the trouble can be traced back to the trigger being farther forward than normal I am told the reason why it was bought is that it has 3 holes in it, and looks badd-a$$, and it was the cheapest of the ones that had 3 holes in it.<br>  <br>  WTF!|`|ZsujbEjJaa	they usually use a 38 super for competitions. A 45 would have been a better choice for home protection. All those accessories are to fine tune your gun, to make it shoot to your liking, and the work should be done by a good gunsmith. the frames are the same and the grips should fit. comps are to control the muzzle flip when u shoot, but that is no diy job. It is a good gun but it depends on what your primary use of the gun will be. and the gun is just a tool, its the person behind the gun that counts. There is also a limited choice of defence ammo for the 38 super compared with the 45acp.|`|vsRjnbTfaa	I can't answer all your questions for certain so don't quote me but first of all, I know several people with 1911 style .38 Supers and they are very impressed with them.  You have a good gun and it is very well suited for home defense.  You probably don't need any accessories, unless you wanted to put laser grips on it which i would actually recommend.  Either laser grips or night sights.  They help tremendously.  I'm not too sure about the grips however it ought to fit.  I would call and ask your local gunsmith before you throw any money down on anything though.

PXimiZCdaa	for holding a edge, the sandvik 13C26 steels are nice, found commonly in kershaws, AUS 8 doesnt hold and edge great, but it sharpens EASY, which the harder steels dont sometimes. AUS 8, depending on the treatment can be harder though. Cold steel and SOG do a nice job of this. Keep in mind that the super hard steels, while hold edges long, are more brittle and prone to chipping than softer steels. The 440A/B/C series will be fine, getting harder, but also more corrosion prone, in that order.<br>  <br>  Heres a great site on knife steels <a href="http://zknives.com/knives/articles/knifesteelfaq.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://zknives.com/knives/articles/knife...</a><br>  <br>  Cheers|`|H4dswqRlaa	The answer used to be 440C stainless.

4nveSsjsaa	My sector 9 is the green Joel Tudor board, it isn't bamboo, but its great! Bamboo boards are solid. my friend makua has one and he loves it plus they are pretty light. i think that the only good bamboo longboard is made by sector9, but i haven't ridden everything yet. I had a bamboo one but I got in a bad accident and it broke. The bamboo one was and is waaay cooler than my current board. tip: if youre in encinitas, don't be stupid when shredding down the big hill going towards san elijo camp ground.

COMYLSBwaa	Definitely handwraps (extra long if you can find them) to avoid any hand injury. I'd check out a book at the local bookstore or library about proper hand wrapping techiniques to insure you are protecting your hands/wrists as good as possible. As far as gloves you can probabaly use a wide assortment from standard boxing gloves to gloves made specifically for heavy bag usage or what I used to use for cardio purposes myself which would be weighted heavy bag gloves (up to 5lbs in each glove iirc).

q8dX0MsNaa	l doubt you can breed them unless you have a tidal flat in your backyard.<br>  there are professional bait gatherers that get them. it is labor intensive and they are at the mercy of tides and weather.<br>  just like professional nightcrawler gatherers in canada, they are probably unionized and prices are most likely fixed.<br>  the ones we get here in so cal come from commercial dealers.|`|c81fa0395c7807a69ecfa0cdd3674cb1aa	because they grow in maine and are hard to get.<br>  <br>  you can't catch them in md its to warm|`|BK1GjPT6aa	The reason is because Blood worms are not really commercially fished for as a bait. It's mostly bait fishermen and women who provide the blood worms for these bait shops all around ( usually local folks) . They go out, dig 'em up, keep 'em fresh and make the asking price ( a pre-arranged deal between the bait catcher and seller) which in turn is marked up considerably. Truth be told, if you knew how to catch a blood worm you would save tons of money and have a heck of a lot of fun in the process. It's hard work ( that's why it's pricey) but hey, you either do the time or pay up.~good luck catchin'.|`|ec2Lhkbwaa	beacasue a lot of love and care are taken to raise them
oMjVp4zGaa	One: a live well for keeping caught fish alive (see above answer)<br>  Two: a live well for keeping bait alive. You need an oval or a round bait tank for bait because they won't lie down and or suspend, they swim around in a mock school in the tank and they bash their noses into squared off walls (caused by 90 degree angle corners) did you ever have a red nosed anchovies where their eyes were bleeding? Bashing into the sides causes death to bait, why square and rectangle ones are made astounds me. We used a 50 gallon barrel made out of a blue half inch thick plastic (poly) we cut it down an rolled over the top using a torch to melt and move the edge to make a saddle for a top to sit into it and hold. We painted it black (on the outside) and then painted it white two coats over the black. then put a silver bubble custom blanket around it because in a light bucket or barrel bait always changes color (it brightens up) and we wanted the bait to be 100% natural in color when dropping them deep they needed to be dark in color. then by coating it white it reflected the heat of the sun and keep the water as cols as the ocean with warming up. You'll need and aerator and a water pump to bring in more water while releasing over flow with top holes les than a quarter inch dia. The best live well shop in the western US is in Huntington Beach it's called Pacific Edge.|`|2bqmotqlaa	make sure you have an aerator so they can live<br>  other than that just make sure there is clean water in the livewell<br>  bassmaster pro 6 yrs|`|tgROmqffaa	If you just use one cooler that should be all you need depending on how big it is and how big your fish are.  Then you'll want water from your lake where your pulling the fish in from or if your doing it at home and your using city water make sure you let the water sit for over 24 hours so the chlorine can dissipate.  If it doesn't the fish will die.  Then you need an aerorator which you can get from your local pet store.  You just put the unit in the bottom to keep air flowing through the water to keep the fish alive.  And there you have it.  A homemade livewell.
aNlT1NRqaa	Light isn't cheap.<br>  <br>  Like Ed said, if it came with a kickstand, it came from WalMart (or someplace just as bad), and the frame probably weighs as much as most full bikes.<br>  <br>  Go to a good bike shop & look & feel their $600-1000 bikes. Do they feel a lot lighter than yours? There you go. Save up your cash get a good bike (doesn't have to cost $3000 - but wouldn't hurt <g>). Try for good components (Shimano XT, SRAM). They will cut down the weight & last. Also, box store bikes are dangerous on trails. I once had a guy crash into me cause his brakes couldn't stop him. Luckily I was able to hit wheel to wheel. Nothing happened to me, but his rim taco'd. It looked like a good bike from a distance, but it was c**p.<br>  <br>  Some things you can't do cheap.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	dylan you stole my line. hahaha. if your bike has a kick stand not worth lookin at dropping wieght. just buy a new lighter bike. it would cost you more to drop a few lbs then it's worth.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	Seriously if you had room for a kickstand then you really do not have a mountain bike at all you have what is known as a "utility bike"  sorry but big box stores only sell these and any Mountain bike that costs more then $900 will likely not even have a place for a kickstand on the frame at all!!!! You want to make a bike lighter?.... dont eat breakfast before you ride! Other wise save your money for a lighter and more expensive bike and dont start pulling parts off the one you have and adding anything to it will most certainly start to get expensive like a good wheel set to start with but you DO NOT WANT TO SPEND  even half of what you initially paid for the bike anyway if you have what Im guessing you have....?|`|HiAVqwHDaa	Suzie is totally wrong. The best way to make a bike lighter is to get lighter wheels. Even a relatively heavy steel frame can be built up fairly light with good wheels. The wheels are where the power goes, so that is where you feel the most weight. unfortunately, wheels can be pricey, but check out the cheaper mavic wheels.|`|oMDD0dusaa	It's all about the frame and you have to spend money for a light frame.

HnqedumSaa	your friend is right gloves are all the same just dont get a golie one (the golie one has a bit muthafu**kin thumb) look for brine, stx, warroir brands|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Well, gloves aren't all exactly the same.  To some extent, the cheap gloves don't offer as much protection as some of the pricier ones.  You don't need anything to extravagant for gloves.  Just make sure they're comfortable.<br>  <br>  For shoulder pads, I recommend shoulder pads that don't have the upper arm guards.  They should cover your shoulders and your chest (specifically your sternum).  I wear shoulder pad liners that don't have plastic shoulder caps.  They're less restrictive.<br>  <br>  I also prefer the smaller elbow pads for the same reason.  More movement.  Again, though, it's what's comfortable for you.  You're not going to be getting checked a whole lot as a defender, but it does happen from time to time.

You might fit a 17, 18, or 19" equally on different brands. Bike shops are the best place to go.<br>  3- Decide how much you want to / can spend.<br>  4- Ride & adjust the bike.<br>  5- Enjoy!<br>  <br>  Once you have a bike, Google local biking clubs (the bike shop will probably know a few). They will help any way they can. If you get into it, they are guaranteed repeat business.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	what type of cycling do you want to start with? road, mtn, track? then go to local shop get fitted ask questions with service& sales staff. most shops will have info on teams an races. training with shop teams local club rides. also bicycling magazine.com.

t3DszYcRaa	First you want to get as much air as you can, then you want to put your upper body into it and just bring your jegs around and bend your knees *** you land. just keep practicing like that and then it will become very easy for you.|`|JwW7j8yYaa	I had the same problem, but finally I got it! You have to jump really high and then flip yourself VERY fast. When you are first about to land, you will probably land on your feet and then fall back down really fast. When I first landed a front flip, I couldn't stop doing it! Good luck!|`|s0jbdiaBaa	To Land a front somersault, first practice a tuck jump. Lots of height, at the top of the jump bring your knees to your chest hard and fast, and open out again to land.<br>  Understand that you must not travel across the trampoline bed. Therefore, you will be taking off in the very middle of the trampoline and landing in the middle too.<br>  Starting on your hands and knees, bounce a little then tuck VERY TIGHT and VERY FAST, lifting your bottom upwards and BACKWARDS, landing on your back or bottom. Have you moved across the trampoline? If you have, try again. Up and BACKWARDS. Lift your bum over your head. If you can easily land on your bottom in the middle of the trampoline, go back to your feet.<br>  Now practice small jumps, up TUCK and over to your back landing your back exactly where your feet were when you took off. If you are not traveling across the bed... you are ready to try landing one to feet.<br>  Jump with your hands staying in the air above your head. Jump just 3 or four times, then TUCK very tight and very fast bring your arms down for the tuck. The idea is getting your knees up to your chest, NOT throwing your upper body down.<br>  Remember to tuck first, sending your bottom up and backwards just like you did with the hand and knees practice.<br>  If you are landing on your bottom, you are not tucking hard enough, fast enough or long enough. Tuck tight, real fast and hold on to the tuck a little longer.<br>  If you are landing and falling forward, you are over rotating and you need to slow it down a little.<br>  If you just can't get it... go back to the hands and knees practice until you can learn to get round to your feet/bottom.<br>  Remember to somersault over right at the top of the jump, and not to throw your head down. Your bum goes BEFORE your head.

6BiiraLpaa	I suggest you have someone throw pop flys to you ever day about 100 times that way you get use to it, also remember always to catch with 2 hands that way the ball won't pop out. I also suggest you have a big glove because small gloves are very hard to catch softballs with, and if you do all of this you should be one the best players on your team =)|`|5LXAhJktaa	Repetition.  Have a friend or a parent hit some balls to you every day and you'll eventually get better.  Eventually you'll get better at judging the ball and it will become simple.<br>  <br>  Some basic pointers... make sure you're first step is always backwards, because it's a lot easier to come in than it is to go back.  If you're right handed, catch the ball on the right side of your body so it's easier to go into the throwing motion.|`|AA11720887	He was right about your first step being backwards. Also they are right about repetition. And most important is using both hands to trap the ball in your mitt. Don't worry that someone will comment on that, do it.

yAvh8wjFaa	The Bills would need a better QB than what they have, T.O. is already whining (when is he not).  I dont think Romo is the best QB in the league but he is better than who the Bills have.  But will they make the playoffs?  doubt it, they need more than just t.o. to make the playoffs.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	No - T.O will wreck team morale.|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	Only in the fantasy leagues. They will have plenty of time to study the talent on the other teams that will be drafted to make up their own fantasy teams.|`|cdQryr7paa	Maybe.<br>  Depends on if T.O. starts his whining and finger pointing like he did in Dallas and Philly.<br>  He only has a one year contract, so he should behave himself for that long.<br>  The Bills were 7-9 last season.<br>  So if they can go 10-6 they could get into the playoffs.|`|LqQvCvLAaa	they will be a dissapointment like last year again|`|dfTMaV58aa	They need a qb.|`|o7E9LxV8aa	I think so|`|KpxZFTBfaa	Hell no T.O. is nothing but a cry baby. You seen what he done when Tony Romo didn't throw the ball to him. He started whining. Besides one player cannot turn a team into a playoff team especially T.O. I mean T.O. is a good player but he needs to stop crying all the time. Now the COLTS are a playoff team.|`|gq7HZoGRaa	ABSOLUTELY NOT all T.O. does is hurt your QB's productivity whether you realize it or not, because he criticizes a QB if he makes 1 bad pass or if he doesnt get the ball enough. A veteran QB would be able to deal with him but not a young QB like Trent Edwards, he needs time to grow and develop into a good QB all T.O. is good for is ruining team chemistry and a QB's confidence, today im a very happy Jet fan because Terrel Owens is not on my team.|`|uqpMqrpSaa	it could be possible but TO is overrated.

YDpT2ClBaa	if its a martial arts related question, then i dont mind, but the who will be win, and were to watch is getting way out of hand especially when its the 20th time asked that day, dam people dont know how to use the search function, its getting like the school fights questions, or which style is better.<br>  i almost missed this question because of all the ufc ones<br>  <br>  edit: that how to become a ninja one is getting old, along with pushup boy and the girl that keeps asking about groin strikes.<br>  <br>  i would suggest a quick list of the most popular questions be posted on the side of the forum, but it would be as useless as the search function, kids just would not know who to use it|`|GpzvrlHdaa	I agree with many here.  UFC questions are divided in my mind between the reasonable martial art questions and the 'who would win', 'which is best' bunch.  Who would win will win, we find out the same time as the questioner,or not.  Which style is best questions almost offend me by the lack of understanding they demonstrate.  Many here, including you give reasonable and accurate answers to reasonable questions, and have the experience to do so.  I think that all these silly questions, and silly answers just prove the need for the real martial artists to continue to attempt to promote knowledge of our arts.  To the guys who are the real deal, I hope you continue to give the few good answers I read here.  The public needs you.   <br>  J|`|nRBC4E5saa	I'm sick of the "what song did so-and-so" come out to.

Mostly the "which martial art is the best", "how do I become a ninja", "ninja vs. XYZ", "is XYZ effective", and so on.|`|Yslq4OYhaa	MMA/UFC questions do not bother me.<br>  <br>  However, I have grown tired of I need help, I have to fight.

If these people want to talk about just watching the fights, they shouldn't talk about it in the martial arts section, since I believe this section is meant for people who really practice martial arts or have questions about martial arts. Not shows.|`|CdAE4nXcaa	mma is mixed martial arts in case you guys didn't know, yeah the same questions everyday are getting ridiculous. but mma and the ufc has brought so many people now to the martial arts world, martial arts used to be considered something nerdy kids to to learn how to fight, and it's so much more than that now. i've been in martial arts my whole life, and it's all changing so either deal with it, quit bitching about it.|`|1fac5a761af3a94ccdce3f25d3999768aa	Hi there <br>  <br>  I certainly second that!<br>  <br>  If its a ledgit question about one of the components that make up MMA lets say BJJ then i dont mind.<br>  <br>  But if it's fan based stupidity such as who would win between thug A and thug B, MMA is the best because TV told me so or did you see the fight between the englishman the irishman and the scottsman then no! <br>  <br>  But remember you can only work with your target audience?

uJPPxyewaa	I have the TP version, which allows for a more pro trajectory, which is lowerer and flat in the air. Also, if you want a new shaft, I would recommend the UST V2 shaft, it is an exceptional combination with that club head. Also, the Diamana 83g S will lower your ball flight considerably, along with any fujikura. The V2 I have found feels the best. What I would do is look on Ebay for maybe a used R7TP and see if you cant pick one up for cheap, then put a custom shaft in there and I can promise you that the ball flight will be much more penetrating than before.|`|syzMIfLLaa	with a 104 swing speed you should be getting a little more yardage than that, but not much.  If the ground was wet, that is likely why you didn't get any role.  When you watch a PGA tourney, those guys only fly it like 275 or so (most of them) so you need to get your spiin down with out sacraficing accuracy.  That may not be possible.  backspin holds the ball flight straigt.  a good tip might be make sure your hitting the ball on the up swing, tee the ball high as you can hit it on the top half of the face and you'll get less spin.  swinging down with your other clubs is always good, but not the driver, that causes backspin.|`|nD3gKvwOaa	I have an R7 425 with a stiff shaft and only 8.5 degrees of loft and i still hit the ball really high. Always have, its just part of my swing.|`|d6959f140445530c8d381f41dd69fcecaa	Maybe a driver with less head angle, less loft.<br>  <br>  You can play when it is cold.  I always get good roll on frozen turf.|`|CBVlu3Gvaa	In wet conditions you will not get much of a roll out no matter what your trajectory is.  Its just one of those things you have to learn to play with.

Try it on yourself now and you'll see how painful it is (your brain automatically prepares for it when you do it to yourself, so it'll be even more painful when you do it to him).<br>  <br>  Now he's off-guard it's time to go for the happy sacks, but don't just deliver a knee in the special spot, if you really want him begging for mercy you need to prolong the agony.<br>  <br>  Reach down between his legs with your free hand (if your arms aren't long enough pull his head downwards as well) then simply grab, squeeze, twist and pull.  This is probably the most pain you can inflict on a man without having to sit through one of those tedious murder trials.<br>  <br>  When he's down on the ground writhing in agony clutching his crown jewels, boot him in the face.  His hands should instinctively go there clutching his (probably) broken nose.  That's when you get him with one more swift toe punt in the love spuds.<br>  <br>  And THAT'S how you show a man who's boss!|`|W1GHZW3Caa	only testicles work woman. but it's cheap and if he catches your leg you lose.|`|1e6He4D9aa	kick him in the balls, or stab your fingers in his eyes, or kick him with a direct right in his nose, very hard.

A guy is very protective of that area and knows that you will probably go for that as that is the easiest target. It's tough to seriously answer your question because you have generalized by saying "Strong man". I know 10 year old boys who are strong, 20 year old skinny computer geeks too- but I'd combat them differently because they are different people. I assume you mean big brawny muscly gym rat type of guy. What I've learned from aikido and jiu-jitsu is that a man's joints, particularly small joints, are not any where near as flexible as a women's joints. I have made men drop or cry with wrist locks, finger twists, and armbars. It's funny to watch.

sKSeNAonaa	You should get regular length goalkeeping pants. I bought 3/4 length, and in games they would slide up and not protect part of my leg.

This way, there is no way that they will slide up.|`|YbOGOnroaa	Anything that makes you comfortable. If you play on a good football pitch where the grass is soft, I think you should wear shorts although most professional goalies opt for 3/4 or tracks during training to prevent injury.

54XYA1XZaa	I wish players would worry more about thier Squat and Cleans then their bench but, here are a few tips sure to up your bench.<br>  <br>  Start off your bench day with a good stretch.  Stretching is so under rated.  It not only prevent injury but gets the blood flowing to your muscles.<br>  <br>  Warm-up set.  Your benching 175lbs  so warm up with 25's on either side (95lbs).    Be sure to use proper form(Even during warm-up sets.  <br>  <br>  Followed by sets of 10,8,5,3 reps.  Increase the weight as decrease number of reps.  Some will tell you to do 5 sets of 5   or even 5 sets of 3, but if you pyrimid your reps you will build muscle, and size but not lose as much flexiblity.  <br>  <br>  Now here is a good tip for uping your bench.  Make sure you have a good spotter and preform a Negitive at the end of each set.  So you do your set of 10 and before you rack it do a negitive.  A negitive means let the bar down to your chest as slow as possible.  Fight it all the way down.  Your spotter will have to help you get the negitive back up if done correctly.<br>  <br>  You then do your set of 8 followed by a negitive and so on so each set is ended with a negitive. <br>  <br>  Be sure to stretch out between sets and after your bench press routine. <br>  <br>  Add in a whole set of negitives as well to really burn up your pecs.  3 sets of3-5 negitives.  Your benching 175, so use 185-190 with a good spot.<br>  <br>  Continue your routine with Incline, decline, DB flies, and so on.  I suggest ending your day with clap push ups.  A clap push up is a plyometric exercise.  While benching and most weight traing work slow twitch muscle fibers, the clap push ups will work fast twitch muscle fibers.  Good luck.  <br>  <br>  Eat right stay away from all the protien, and supplement stuff.<br>  <br>  The real trick to anything is staying consistant.|`|W1GHZW3Caa	whey protein|`|GSFH3Hvgaa	Ok yeah protien and protien shakes can work but also do sqauts while holding the bar. Then also do the lifts which you lift from pulling off ground. try doing atleast 30 benches a day, but not to many or you'll be really sore. and drink a protien shake a day.
xMnN99T8aa	Lighter is always faster. Rotating mass is the hardest to keep moving as opposed to static mass i.e. the frame. However, if you're talking about the Mavic wheels with the carbon spokes, stay away. They're only for pros or people with unlimited funds. The spokes and hub are proprietary. You need to carry spokes and the special tool. I ride Race Lites' on a Trek Madone 5.2. The new ones (2008) are very good. I had a problem with my '07 rear wheel and they replaced it under warranty. It was completely redesigned, different hub, spokes, and spoke pattern, but they kept the rim and the name. I like it.|`|CttL3LmBaa	If you are a racer a lot faster.

Y do u think all companys like benelli remington and winchesters turkey models have 23 or 24 inch barrels the point of a short barrel is because u will be crawling under trees and stuff and with a 28 inch barrel ull get hung up on everything|`|8ivnzNi5aa	The 28".  Odds are good that the 24" barrel is rifled, for use with slugs.|`|QrjuueMCaa	The 28". Use heavi-shot and a turkey choke. You will do fine.|`|vsRjnbTfaa	I agree with deerpoo22 and jt on this one.  Use the 24 inch barrel because should you be lucky enough to call in a bird, he's not always going to come from the direction you have your gun pointed.  If you need to move, then you need a short enough barrel to be able to move quietly thru the brush.|`|tgROmqffaa	Your definately going to want to use the 28" barrel.  The longer the barrel the closer the grouping.  Your gonna want a tighter grouping to kill the turkey easier.|`|PcOEPKfIaa	it depends on weather both have screw in chokes . i  would prefer the 24 with a super turkey choke in it. it just a little easier to maneuver in a blind.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	28" for sure the 24" is probably for slugs.
doFdrgfKaa	If TO keeps his mouth shut, then it will be an excellent move for the Bills.  His skills are amazing.

Hes toxic no matter where he goes. If it wasn't for his selfish attitude and his desire to post his own stats so that hes remembered after this is all over, then he'd be a real superstar.<br>  <br>  Reality is though, if Lee Evans continues to be excited and can handle being number 2, then the combination of Trents big arm and T.O. down the field all day might just work out.|`|cdQryr7paa	On the football field, T.O. is only as good as his quarterback.<br>  Trent Edwards is hardly a top shelf quarterback.<br>  He played 14 games last season and had 11 TDs and 10 INTs.<br>  I doubt he has the talent to satisfy T.O. and find him on every single play like T.O. demands.<br>  Do you remember how T.O. used to be up in McNabb's face on the bench during games in Philly?<br>  Your going to see it big time in Buffalo.<br>  It's not whether a team is good for T.O., it's if T.O. is good for a team, any team.<br>  Time will tell us.|`|PVc0gIeVaa	I think it is a good deal I mean it's just for one year, you know t.o doesn't mess up thebteam after the 2nd season and he would help Edwards and evan the reciever who is pretty good. I'm mean look at his stats, expirement on him. I don't put my money on if they make the playoffs but they should be a little better

d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Okay, it is highly unlikely that you will find any flat track racers on here. I'm a former division champ at flat track and I can't even tell you what bike is best for flat track these days. My suggestion is forget anything that is said here, go to the local track you plan to race and see what bikes are dominating your class. I'm guessing that 4 strokes are dominating flat track just like they do motocross. You need to see what classes are available to you also. Even though you are fairly short, flat track bikes are short also. Just because say a 250F MX bike is too tall for you that doesn't mean a 250F flat track bike is too tall for you. You have to figure that a motocross bike has over 12 inches of suspension travel where a flat tracker would have maybe 3 to 4 inches so that's a huge height difference.|`|qWOLmHmWaa	I think a four stroke is a good idea as well. I think with your body type you should get a CRF100. I am your same height and started riding a year ago and it's the perfect beginner bike... take my word for it. I have one. Once you get some skill a faster bike would be better... but being so short is going to limit what you can easily ride. You could always adjust the suspension on the bike... or pull a ricky and chop some of the seat off lol.  good luck have fun and be safe|`|OBnNGcfHaa	I'm 5'6 and 120lbs and I started out with a 150cc Honda CRF its a 4stroke trail riding bike. It was great to learn on and when I moved to the track I just adjusted the suspension. 4strokes are good because you dont have to stay on the throttle as much as a 2 stroke and also you dont have to worry about the fuel mixture.  If you have friends with bikes I would ask to ride some of there's so you can get a better feel of what you want. Its always better to get a bike that you will out grow then get to much bike to start out with.|`|t3DszYcRaa	Yes i would start with a four stroke if i was you, i have been riding for a few years and the 4 stroke is better when you first start riding. there is a big difference, with the 2 stroke it has way more power and if you crack the throttle it will just stand right up. the 2 stroke would be really hard to handle when  your just learning to ride. plus you normally have to rebuild your 2 strokes about once a year so you would be better off with a 4 stroke. good luck|`|0eA4gkHdaa	i am the same size and i got me a CRF150R and dude that thing is awesome!! all the power i need in one small machine. I am 5 foot and both my feet touch the ground. Don't get a 100 get the 150r racing bike and you wont regret it

mzTJarucaa	nope i don't think so. i'm learning the camel myself and thereare times i do the same. if you watched youtube videos, most skaters spin on the ball of their foot. there are chances that they actually spin leaning on the inside and outside edge, but i'm not sure of their pointing system there so...<br>  <br>  well anyway, no it isn't good, but do try to lean more on the ball of your skating foot and do your best to balance your weight. physics helps here, since the camel spin looks a lot like a lever. the more pointed your extended leg and torso is, the better.|`|S5fJrwGkaa	it takes practice to master the camel spin<br>  think spin on the rocker, and don't lean to deep on the outside edge<br>  good luck!|`|gx4VqmrKaa	as the other girl said it does take practise.<br>  but.... if you set your mind to it you should be able to consentrate and balance your wweight onto the BALL of your foot between the heel and your toes.<br>  good luck!!<br>  <br>  xx

fvMv1DT3aa	I think Matt Hardy is a good wrestler and he is becoming a great heel. I think he deserves some more respect from the fans and I'm glad that he cost Jeff the title.|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Matt is the better of the two brothers and Ive alwayss been a fan of his whether face or heel, I will always like him more than Jeff.|`|hL3eS2zKaa	I think that he is a very good wrestler and he is doing great as a heel. I dont think what he said about Jeff was entirely a confession, maybe. I could see the look in his eye that it seemed like torture for him to say such a thing. I think that it was horrible of him to cost Jeff the title. But Im sure that Jeff'll get another chance. But Matt is finally getting some attention. And thats a good thing.|`|eGCWuY4raa	I think that Matt is a good wrestler, but he is boring!  He has no charisma and he doesn't have the fan base that his brother Jeff has and he probably never will.  I think that the brother vs brother storyline is stupid and I hope that it ends soon.  I would much rather see The Hardy's vs Edge & Christian.  <br>  I know that there are going to be a lot of you who don't agree with me, but Matt is a terrible heel and if it is Matt vs Jeff at Wrestlemania, I hope that Jeff wins.|`|EZf00NJJaa	In my opinion , Jeff hardy is the better of the two brothers .<br>  Matt has no charisma , and it's unfortunate .<br>  Hopefully , It sets up Matt v Jeff at WM , where Jeff will go over .|`|8jK33jK1aa	I like Matt Hardy and the storyline right now is great because both Matt and Jeff have a lot of attention focused on them and air time.

AA11108627	You may be thinking of the NFC Championship Game that year, not the Super Bowl.<br>  <br>  That game is the last round of the playoffs.  The winner of that game ends up going TO the Super Bowl.  But it is not the Super Bowl inself.<br>  <br>  The way the leagues are currently set up, it is impossible for Dallas and Green Bay to play each other in the Super Bowl.  Why?  Because they are in the same division (the NFC, or National Football Conference).  Only one team from that divison plays in the Super Bowl.  They play the winner of the AFC (American Football Conference) for all the marbles in the Super Bowl!<br>  <br>  I can verify that Dallas went to the Super Bowl that year (against the Pittsburg Steelers).  So the winner of the game you described between Dallas & Green Bay was Dallas.<br>  <br>  I hope this clarified things for you.|`|Vz5vjAWRaa	1996 Super Bowl XXX<br>  Date Played: January 28, 1996<br>  <br>  Teams: Dallas Cowboys vs. Pittsburgh Steelers<br>  <br>  Winner: COWBOYS<br>  <br>  Final Score: 27-17<br>  <br>  Location: Tempe, Arizona<br>  <br>  Now the packers did play in the 1997 superbowl and beat the New England Patriots 35-21!! =)|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	They never met in the superbowl.

onPUtK5zaa	Based on Djokovic's form in the Ferrer match, Nadal should take this in straight sets. I too want to see a good match, but if Djokovic does play like he did against Ferrer, Nadal should bagel him at least once (no joke). He hit 60+ unforced errors and was just atrocious to watch at times (I stopped watching in the second set). <br>  <br>  I'm predicting 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 for Nadal in straight sets.|`|ea059efe053f1e8b4703c42abc3c7a5caa	There's no question that Rafa can play on clay, but it depends on his legs which he's been having problems with...or maybe not.  He pretty much demolished Tipsarevic and Rafa is 5-0 against Djoke on clay so do you even need to ask?  I mean Djoke lost to a very good player but a lesser player than Rafa in his opening game.  I think Rafa would want to teach him a very good lesson knowing how Djoke loves to mouth off how better he is than everyone else.  He seemed to have lost every single tournament in the early rounds since last year.  Let's see if he can back it up against Rafa.|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	well it would be a upset for rafa to lose.. he is on his favourite surface.. and he is brewing with so much confidence now that he conquered the hardcourts of the australian open 2 months back.. <br>  <br>  even with nadal somewhat underpar he still has the advantage of djovick.. more top spin, a little better defense and more complete game..<br>  <br>  djovick.. if he wants to apply himself and fight to the bitter end he will do just that.. as his defense is pretty good too. and he is a power baseliner... i say 6 - 4, 7 - 5, 6 - 1|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	nadal|`|9hC7bbf7aa	Yes, Rafa wins 6-2, 6-3, 7-5, and I'm being conservative...

Ferrer was ferocious and vengeful.
RS3fjNboaa	It's too late in his career for him to become a team player. He might play until he's 40 (he's 36 now), but from now on he'll be a journeyman receiver.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Music -- wrestling had/has nothing to do with my tastes in music.  Probably the biggest influence on me was an older cousin in the late 60's who introduced me to Black Sabbath.  Growing up in a home with County & Western-loving parents, Black Sabbath was quite an eye-opener.<br>  <br>  Clothes -- I've always been Levi's and T-shirt kind of guy.  Perhaps on a very sub-conscious level Dusty Rhodes had some influence on me, but it's not something I decided one day (to dress like Rhodes).  Probably my father had more of an influence on me in that regard.<br>  <br>  Attitude/Treating Others -- wrestling has influenced me in this.  I was always the quiet guy, plugging along, never complaining.  And it got me nowhere.  I learned from watching wrestling that the "squeaky wheel gets the grease".  If you want others to recognize your "greatness" you have to tell them about it.  Constantly.  But in order to avoid being a "flash in the pan" and "all style, no substance" you have to back up that "greatness".  You can't just tell people you're "great", you have to show them, too.  This is most reflected at my job.  I used to be the anonymous guy everybody dumped problems on and relied on to fix those problems (you all know those dumped-on guys)...with no rewards...and more importantly, little respect.  So I added a little The Rock arrogance, a little Stone Cold "attitude", and a little Triple H PR to my "work persona".  Not over-the-top like those three, but enough.  I'm still "old reliable" but everybody knows "just who the hell I am".  At a recent employee evaluation meeting, the boss called me "intimidating".  Not the effect I was going for, but I'll take that over the under-respected mousy problem-fixer I was.  This "wheel" "squeaks" now and gets "greased" from time-to-time, thanks to the influence of The Rock, Stone Cold, and Triple H.<br>  <br>  Being older, well-established, and a "proven commodity" (at work), I find the disrespectful attitudes of the "new kids" (who want everything just handed to them) offensive (Chris Jericho is voicing their opinions perfectly).  With them, I am fairly arrogant and demanding; I paid my dues to get to where I'm at; nobody is going to step over me through shortcuts, they will pay the same dues I did; nobody GETS my respect, they have to EARN it.  The incessant whining here about the older wrestlers (especially Ric Flair) offends me.  Clueless kids complaining about somebody they know nothing about it, and whining because their favorite "flavor of the month" isn't headlining every show.<br>  <br>  As for The Dragon (me): he's a lot like the man he was named for (Ricky Steamboat).  Good at what he does, but not overly flashy.  A career babyface who doesn't complain much.  He's respectful of others, but does have his limits, a line you can't cross.<br>  <br>  I see the updated top ten as a "changing of the guard" type of thing.  I have all the respect in the world for King Kjors, the man knows wrestling, and cuts through the crap better than anybody else in this section.  But he's a lot like like Ric Flair in the 80's.  Good at what he does, flashy, arrogant, abrasive, loud, and sometimes obnoxious.  The 80's heel Flair had a lot of fans; so does Kjors.  A lot of people hated Flair; a lot people hate Kjors.<br>  <br>  This section had Ric Flair at the top for a long time.  Now we have Ricky Steamboat who, thus far, has proven to be a popular "champion" (thanks for the support, everybody).  Can The Dragon sustain that?  Or will he have to "tweak his gimmick" to remain on top?|`|H3nbC71eaa	No disrespect to Undisputed Jericho, but RAW = Respect All Wrestlers has been said in this section for quite a while now.<br>  <br>  <br>  But to answer your question..I'll answer it in the same format you have it:<br>  <br>  Music: I'm mostly Hip Hop & R&B and have been since the 80's..but as I got older I've been more open to other types of music and have listened to more rock songs and like a lot of the wrestling themes as a result of watching wrestling. But Hip Hop & R&B are always my fave.<br>  <br>  Clothes: Wrestling does nothing to influence this on me, the clothes I wear go by what I like.<br>  <br>  Attitude/Treating others: No influence in this department either from wrestling. I give credit to my mother for the way she raised me and growing up in a tough area for making me know how to endure things in life.<br>  <br>  Personality: Again no influence what so ever from wrestling, if anything it's the other way around on this one. Stonecold is my favorite wrestler...and you can say that he's an exagerrated reflection of a younger me..with an urban instead of redneck touch. I liked Stonecold because I could relate to his character, his character didn't make my personality.|`|aXdGCbEDaa	Well,I suppose my clothing style and my personality apply here.<br>  <br>  <br>  Clothes - I'm a Hip-Hop type of guy.I mainly wear Southpole and Ecko Unlimited,which is sort of what Cena wears.Also,I have some Affliction clothing,although it's very expensive.Aside from that,I have a few WWE related T Shirts.My personal favorite is my "Age of Orton" one.<br>  <br>  Music - As,I've already mentioned,I'm into Rap and Hip-hop,but I enjoy listening to Rock as well.I've listened to Lost Prophets alot ever since I heard "Rooftops" from Jeff Hardy's "coming to Smackdown" promo.Also,I've listened to a bit of Rev Theory ever since hearing "Voices",which is one of my favorite songs.I've also downloaded Christian's new theme as well as the one he had before he left WWE.Aside from that,I mainly listen to Eminem,2pac,Common,Kanye West,Biggie Smalls,Nas,etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  Personality - My personality is much like John Cena's not exactly but sort of.I'm nice to almost everyone and I help others as much as I can when I have the chance.However,I do have quite a temper,and although I don't take things to the extreme,I tend to get carried away when someone ticks me off.But overrall,I feel that I'm a nice guy,as long as I'm not bothered.<br>  <br>  STARRED|`|hL3eS2zKaa	Kinf of.<br>  Like you, I have always been a fan of the rock genre of music.<br>  Like Metallica, Saliva, ACDC, etc. Especially "No More Words" and Let It Rock", and "Hunt You Down".<br>  <br>  Yes, it has slightly changed my taste in fashion. Ive always liked Aero, Abercrombie and such, but I also used to like dark, punky  styles. Now I kinda dress that way, like stuff from Hot Topic. I also dress kind of peppy and happy sometimes (emphasis on the sometimes".<br>  <br>  Attitude: Yea, I've learned form wrestling that you need to have respect for others, no matter what. I've also learned to stand strong and how to be brave. <br>  Personality: No, Ive always been a very serious and focused person. But now Im not as sensitive as I was before. I've learned not to take any disrespect from others and not to worry about my body image, (even though Im not fat). I have been a very happy and bubbly person this year.|`|SJJEF5Vyaa	Yeah, I have started liking Rock.<br>  Also i always wear Facepaint around my house, I do act the same as Jeff.|`|lGIL36faaa	yes looking at my fav wrestlers its made me think of myself as better and made me stand up 4 myself and not relying on others!|`|qqLcvDDKaa	Now that I think of it, it really did have a big impact on me. And I'm glad it did.|`|KIOR56r6aa	Now, I like to wear black clothing just like a certain wrestler|`|NZKramllaa	Music: I have always been more of a Hip-Hop/ Rap and R&B, Person, I always listen to Dj Khaled Mixes, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z,Kanye, Tupac, Biggie etc....but WWE has gotten me hooked to Rock too, I can't help to like some of Alter-Bridges Songs and Rev Theory's. and I am a Fan of "Lincoln Park" and "Blink 1802" as well, I even have a Couple Albums of Rock on my Ipod Now. So I can thank WWE for Introducing Me to Rock.<br>  <br>  Clothes: You will See me wearing Ecko, Sean John,and Jordan Clothes, LA Hats etc...Alot of Hip-Hop Clothing. My shoes I always wear Some Nike Air Force 1's, Jordan's, Reebok, Vans etc...but I have took a liking to Rock Clothing as well. I sometimes stop by "Hot Topic" and Pick Up, Some Wallet Chains, or a Skull T-Shirt. I even bought this Ecko Hoodie the Other day, It was Sick, It had alot of Skulls on it. I like wearing alot of Tight T-shirts like Edge, with Some levi Jeans and a Wallet Chain. So you will catch with Style similar like Cena and Edge, I guess Edge Introduced me to more Rock type of Clothing.<br>  <br>  Attitude/ Treating Others: Not much Influence but I have always been a very polite Person. Just as long as I don't get disrespected there won't be a issue, because I NEVER start fights, pick, argue with anyone. My Family says I'm too nice at Times, but Wrestling has taught me in this Category, Treat Everyone with Respect, No matter what Career path they Want,. Show Support.

McNabb is really good and doesn't bring negative TV attention like Vick does.<br>  <br>  There are 3 teams I think that are willing to pick him up:<br>  <br>  1.) Dallas Cowboys - I'm the most confident that the Cowboys will pick him up. The reasons are that Jerry Jones has dealt with many players that have a bad rep. (ex. Pacman Jones, Terrell Owens) although he seems to be taking out the trash by releasing those players. But the biggest reason why is because Tony Romo is a terrible QB he can't throw, chokes in big games (ex. The Eagles game this season) he is a terrible team leader (ex. took a vacation 1 week before the Eagles game mention earlier instead of practicing because that game was for Playoff eligibility.) and not to mention while Vick is a 1st overall draft pick Romo WASN"T EVEN A DRAFT PICK he was a free agent<br>  <br>  <br>  2. St. Lois Rams - Holt needs someone good to throw to him.<br>  <br>  3. Washington Redskins - Like someone said before like to use alot of money on plalyers (ex.

9CoaKELzaa	The only threat the Bills are going to be in the AFC East is a threat to themselves when the locker room begins to divide.<br>  <br>  Trent Edwards and Terrell Owens...Nothing screams legendary combo quite like that.|`|zCSBVAbyaa	They are a threat for sure. They were 5-1 to start this season and bad breaks/injuries hurt them down the stretch. T.O. will be more focused and motivated by playing for a lower caliber team than his predecessors and he will thrive. They will make the playoffs as a wild card worst case and could give the Pats a run for their money. My only doubts are that Belichick is dominant against the Bills and with Brady back, it will be a long shot for the division title. I am just happy with this acquisition and am looking for the first playoff appearance by the Bills since 1998. Go Bills!|`|q9D1mCJnaa	YES<br>  <br>  The dolphins are a 1 hit wonder, the wild cat is no surpise any more<br>  the jets need to find a QB<br>  <br>  and we all saw 1 hit and the pats r done|`|XPFhS1EDaa	I think so.

If he can control his narcissism for one year, they may have a good season.  But that's a big if.  They should be better, but a couple bad throws by Edwards can set off T.O. and ruin their season.  It's a crap shoot.  Good luck.|`|SJEXY7Ufaa	WOW what a GREAT move on the part of the Bills! they will be serious contenders this year....Patriots screwed up not signing T.O. for a year....nobody could have stopped them...but then they don't have a quarterback do they|`|8UTJ0kFNaa	No the signing was best for the Dolphins, Patriots and Jets.|`|exOOXAkBaa	That was so stupid.

I can understand why people in other countries are so into it, but for me, i see if for what it is.

UfQhMDeeaa	Favre was OK at the beginning of the year, but pretty bad in the end. I think it showed that he is not what he once was and, obviously, that the trade worked in the Packers' favor. I mean, the Jets didn't even make the playoffs with Favre. Even worse, the Jets released Pennington shortly after getting Favre, so now they have no decent starting QB for next season. In the end, it was a horrible move by the Jets.|`|A3raPhkDaa	it was worth trying especially since they only gave up a 4th|`|PVc0gIeVaa	3-10 and 9-7 what you think ..... That's right|`|l0iCqzlQaa	obvioulsy not|`|dnwJmNkdaa	well until the collapse things looked good fro the jets... tannenbaum looked like a hero... The theory was the Jets were one player from being a superbowl contender<br>  <br>  Had they gone to the big stage yeah it would've paid off... either way the big name sold tickets for their new stadium  so it was a win win for the franchise in a business sense|`|20zLmf3Laa	Well, if I'm not mistaken, the #4 Jets jersey was the most sold NFL jersey for the season so since the Jets get a portion of that money, since they sold out all their home games, and their merchandise was a hot seller, then yeah I'd say it was worth it for them. As a Packer fan I'd say it was a win, win for both clubs since we got the Jets 3rd round pick and the Jets had record high revenue for the team.|`|cdQryr7paa	It was worth it for Pennington obviously.<br>  I bet he is SO glad they cut him after they signed Favre.<br>  He definately go the last laugh on that one.<br>  As far as the Jets go, it depends on how you look at it.<br>  To me, 9-7 wasn't worth all the drama Favre brought with him.|`|oIxQLcj9aa	Farve is a great QB. They looked good at the start of the year.If they kept it up,Then yes.But they didnt so NO|`|dhvaBwFzaa	Mr.R said it perfectly.

d64BwGdoaa	i used to think that the harder you were breathing, the better you ran. but the other day my coach told me otherwise. keep your body moving at a fast pace, but breathe evenly when youre running. panting doesnt get enought oxygen to the rest of your body and it doesnt help your time any. when youre done you should also breathe in slowly, hold it, and then breathe out slowly. this helps you recover faster.|`|q57LZ6XWaa	Having a steady breathing rate is good. It just means that your not as tired as the other people. I would try to go faster if you can though, if you are not out of breath when you are done. Good luck!|`|HlD9dRF2aa	Do whatever is comfortable and keeps you relaxed when running at that pace.<br>  <br>  Really.    <br>  <br>  Some people do better on a 2:1, 2:2, 3:3 and in some cases of yoga influenced runners 4:4 breathing.  It also has a lot to do with your conditioning.  Someone with better endurance is less likely to need to breathe as rapidly as a novice.|`|cKXZOLJSaa	Well, you need to breathe comfortably.<br>  If your comfortable breathing slow, then do that.<br>  but panting? I don't know how some people do that!<br>  I hear them and if i was them I would probably pass out!<br>  haha.<br>  But just breathe at a sort of pace that goes along with your running pace, Just don't think about it too much

ZbNXVQu7aa	I see them winning a tight AL Central race and reaching the ALCS before losing to the Red Sox.<br>  <br>  I see Morneau hitting around .300 with rougly 100 runs, 35 HRs, and 120 RBIs.<br>  As for Mauer, I see an average near .330 with roughly 95 runs, 15 HRs, 85 RBIs, and 5-10 SBs.<br>  I see Liriano pitching his way to a 15-12 record with roughly 220 Ks, a 3.16 ERA, and a 1.13 WHIP.|`|HGAsVI77aa	This team is probably the hardest team to configure this year. With Liriano healthy and ready to play and with a very young team, i believe this team can end upto be like a tampa bay rays. Yes, i dont think they will win as many games but they will definately make the playoffs. The most accurate prediction by me and a lot of experts say about a record of 87-73. They will make it far as they will have to play the angels in wildcard round and actually upset them but then they will lose to either the yankees, or Seattle who is another bubble team. Morneau will have another 30 homerun year and will carry this team offesively. Mauer i believe will struggle a bit though he will still put up great numbers. Liriano is my favorite subject and is expected to get 16 wins and have a great year.|`|hMkb7H31aa	Morneau, Mauer and Liriano will co-share the MVP Award, the Twins will win 125 games and sweep whoever they play in the World Series, .  <br>  <br>   It's shaping up as an extraodinary season for the Twins.<br>  <br>  GO TWINS !!!|`|Tmr7f3Xgaa	Better than the Tigers. The Twins won't make the playoffs. The Cleveland team will win the division and the wild card team will come out of a different division.|`|OXHLqBuwaa	I think there going to have the same year as last year thats if joe nathan isn't hert but if hes fine then they will make the wild card|`|BZ7HRmfIaa	1st place in the division, 96-66 record.|`|i2NFartOaa	NO way|`|PCjT78cJaa	ok|`|M0eyMvqlaa	Division or 2nd Place.|`|nDOWKhwCaa	I think they will pretty much be the same every single year for the foreseeable future. They'll continue to be a small market team that manages it's farm system well, but can't seem to keep most of their superstar players. I'd guess they'll finish around .500 just like last year and probably be competing for a playoff birth up until the last week or so of play.

AA12139128	of course it will help you. boxing IS fighting but with technique and grace. The only difference is you dont do dirty stuff. In a real life fight you want to hold your arms out farther than when you box so you have more time and space to grab an arm or deflect your opponent's shots. you cant really take in and block bare knuckle shots with your arms and forearms like in boxing because those shots really hurt without gloves and anywhere you get hit with a bareknuckle shot is gonna hurt so you gotta be smart and thats what seperates an average or even strong person from a boxer.<br>  <br>  stronger punch- even against a guy somewhat heavier than you, your punch will hurt more than his because youre muscles are trained to PUNCH<br>  <br>  more stamina - after just a couple swings youre opponent will already be getting tired and weak, hell also be less able to dodge<br>  <br>  quicker reflexes - youll be able to doge punches and see them coming a bit earlier and also be able to counter much quicker<br>  <br>  better chin - a boxers chin is a reference to his ability to take a punch, of course some people just cant take a shot no matter how strong you are and knuckles hurt way more, but over time generally most people learn to take a punch better and you wont dont get as shocked and dazed like average people because you get hit in the face all the time.|`|VF4foFPSaa	ive been boxing for a while....ye it does help no.1 stamina....the other guy will be throwing sloppy punches and you will have stamina much more then he does plus....when you box for a while u automatically response to a punch and defend urself...whenever someone pretends slappin me i retaliate automatically|`|6eWFZ0vyaa	what the freak are you saying dude|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	yes it will help you in many ways get a boxing workout trainng book and start there then get a trainer you will see how it helps you|`|vLD8L1P0aa	yeah i agree with the other guy saying that you naturally punch someone after boxing for a while. And if someone came running up to a boxer throwing wild punches the boxer would hardly get hit because they move around on their feet a lot and the boxer would just move back while easily throwing jabs and combinations, and boxers are so fitter than others. And they get trained to get hit by punches so hard those wild punches wouldn't do much effect anyway.<br>  So yes, it would definintly help you.
3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* The Best choice is the 30-06 because you have a Greater Variety of bullet weights to choose from for Varmints to Big Game or African Game.* It has increased accuracy, trajectory, and down range impact.*The 30-06 has done it all for 103 years.* The Rifle has earned its Reputation and Name by making 15 one-shot Kills on American Game.* It has been successfully used in Africa to Harvest a Bull Cape Buffalo using a 220 grain Barnes bullet to penetrate 40 inches of muscle and bone to drop the Bull Cape Buffalo. It has been used on other African Big Game as well.* When using hand-loads you can get 3,006 Ft per sec muzzle Velocity using a 180 grain bullet in a 26 inch barrel. That's the same Performance you would get if you were using a 300 H&H Magnum.* The 308 cannot duplicate or compete with that kind of Performance.*. * The 30-06 is capable of a Magnums Performance, the 308 is not.* The 30-06 is King.*..|`|xOReEw6Waa	Comes down to personal preference on these. The 30-06 give you more capacity and better speeds with equal weight bullets and with the 30-06 you can use up to 220 grain bullets if you choose to. The 308 is a shorter cartridge with less capacity and it is lessened more if you use bullets above 180 grains because the Cartridge Overall Length will make the bullet tail use up powder capacity. <br>  Ballistically they are only separated by 150 FPS for most loadings. You hit any animal with a 165 grain bullet within 200 yards with either and you would never be able to tell the difference. <br>  I bought my first 30-06 when I was 14 and have never been without one since. If I grew up around 270s or 308s that would probably still hold true, 30-06 gives you a much better range of options and there is no down side. Recoil is a little more with the 06, but is very minor in that regard.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	I like the .308........<br>  <br>  Others like the 30-06....<br>  <br>  I don't see the advantage of the 30-06 but that's just me.......<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.snipercountry.com/Articles/FHG05_308or3006.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snipercountry.com/Articles/FH...</a><br>  <br>  Usually I recommend the .308 to everybody...

If for hunting anyway. I use a mosin for large game.|`|YPHfJvuQaa	This has been debated several times on yahooanswers as well as many other sites and you will get many biased answers. It is mostly a matter of preference the cartridges  are very similar both  use bullets that are 308/1000ths of an inch in diameter. However, the case lengths and designs are different the .308 Winchester has a 51mm case the 30-06 Springfield has a 63mm long case with a longer neck. The -06 does best the .308 in the majority of testing parameters. You will get more ft. lbs. of energy out of the -06 about 7% more on average and the -06 is known to handle heavier bullets better then the .308 making it a better round for Black Bears and Moose. There are also more ammo choices available for the -06 and it is preferred by reloaders. There is  a slight recoil advantage with the .308 as well as quicker follow up shots on bolt-action equipped rifles, do to the shorter action, but these advantages are often insignificant when compared to the many factors the -06 bests the .308. Make a choice and stick to it.|`|H4dswqRlaa	The biggest advantage of a 30-06 moose rifle (or grizzlys with the 200-220 grain bullets) is that one can load it to 308 specs for elk, or 30-30 specs for the deer woods. A reloading manual tells all. But it is lore, not fact, that a 30-06 full load is "perfect for deer". And of course, the 308 can be loaded to duplicate a 30-30 as well, to maximize venison harvest and shooter accuracy from the reduced recoil.

qOhSuTv8aa	I am assuming your horse is sound to jump.  A good number of ex race horses really aren't.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your horse is a bit green.  I would start by walking your horse over ground poles then cavaleties.  Keep speeding him up over a week or two and you will be jumping sooner or later.  It's a matter of experience.  I have seen one horse that would not even cross a ground pole.  He would run right up to it and stop like you were running him to the wall.  <br>  <br>  You need to start slowly with your horse in the barrel pattern also.  Start walking him through the pattern.  Reward him when he does it right and goes to the second barrel and work him hard when he goes back to the gate.  A lot of trainers will drive them in a circle hard if they go to the gate .  Teach them the gate is a lot of work and rest happens in the center of the arena (at least never at the gate).<br>  <br>  Some horses are naturally runners and others need a lot of encouragement to run farther than the first barrel (just like people).  I have one of both and they are great for different things.  You may find you want to trade for a horse with more go after a while, but if you keep working him, he will speed up over time and get some energy.  You also may need to get a lot more authoritative in your riding to get the horse to do what you want.  Horses love to push you and if they win, they lose respect for you.  If a horse is pushing me hard, I always make sure I win the last round even if it is just getting him to do something simple.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	you should try to teach him one or the other; teach barrels or jumping, not both at once, for jumping start by walking him over poles on the ground, then trot, then canter, work up to small jumps, make sure you put splint boot and bell boots on your horse if he doesnt clear well; for barrels, same thing, walk the pattern, then trot, then canter, start slow, give him time to learn
KyCJOR2paa	I'm sick of seeing the Wings trying to play cutesy all of the time.  They also need to learn how to start a game.  WAY to often they are just not into the game at the start and right away get behind the ball.  Teams will not have any problems getting up for a game against the Wings, they just don't seem to care.  They used to be the hardest working team in the league, that's why they won the Cup last year.  Now I've watched plenty of other teams this season, and I would say that lately the Wings are definitely the laziest team in the league.  The Islanders work harder than the Wings do.  They are playing like they think they are the best team in the league and don't have to go out and work for it.  How many stupid turnovers do they have to make to realize that in some games the offense isn't going to be there, and they just have to work hard for it.  Datsyuk and Zetterberg have been non-existent the last 4 games.  Rafalski is showing that he can't play defense to save his life.  I say bench him for a game or two.  He'd rather play cute, than use energy to defend.  WHY CAN'T YOU LEARN THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A PLAY, JUST THROW IT OUT OF THE ZONE.  Who cares if you give the puck away then, at least it's not in your zone anymore and you won't give a guy a clean scoring chance.<br>  <br>  Teams like Columbus and Minnesota clog the neutral zone, so when you try to get fancy, they are going to create turnovers and scoring chances.  The first three goals of the game, they just allowed players to get in completely alone.  That is what happens when all you care about is offense.  3 unassisted goals and 2 with only 1 assist.  Tells the story completely.  STUPID TURNOVERS.  I don't care what goalie you have in net, if you keep giving those glorious chances up, you're going to keep giving up 8 goals.  Also when you have early PP chances you have to at least attempt to make plays.  They played way to lazily on the PP.  Its what led to the Nash shortie.  <br>  <br>  Mason looked great tonight, WHY????  He doesn't have to face 20 shots where he is one on one with an opponent.  He had to face one.  It's just another game where they don't show up to play in front of Osgood.  The only goal that he should have stopped was the 2nd Umberger goal, but even then it was crappy defensive plays that led to the shot.<br>  <br>  It's time they started focusing only on playing defense for a while.  Look at what Nashville and Columbus just did.  They didn't come out and dominate the Wings offensively, they dominated defensively to create turnovers and force Detroit off their game.<br>  <br>  If you want Osgood to start playing better, it's time you started playing better in front of him so he can actually get some sort of confidence going.|`|lYnkvRASaa	Everyone says that Holland is happy with his goaltending situation.  Maybe that should be WAS happy with is goaltending.<br>  <br>  Everyone says Holland is one of the top GM's in the league, I am beginning to doubt that as far as goaltending is concerned.<br>  <br>  Seems to be one of two things,<br>  <br>  either he actually thinks it is not an issue<br>  or he is unwilling to admit his mistakes.<br>  <br>  Mike you say a goalie is only as good as his defense, true in  part but a defense is only as good as its goalie too.  He has to be there to cover up some of their mistakes.<br>  <br>  Tonight a rookie, Mason gives up 2 goals on 46 shots.  All world Osgood faces 1/2 as many shots and gives up 7.<br>  <br>  Seems to me all that high powered offense and their 46 shots can be neutralized by a hot goalie.  Going to be interesting if the Wings face a hot goalie in round 1.<br>  <br>  Dewman- Mason faced twice as many shots as Osgood, if Mason was in Det net and Osgood in for Columbus the wings could have won by 10 or12 goals|`|UADHt07Zaa	Apparently they're in bipolar mode.<br>  <br>  Either that or they've just decided to take Saturdays off for the remainder of the season.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Ken Holland said he's happy with the goaltending situation......he said it on both TSN and Rogers SportsNet.<br>  <br>  Holland would not lie!|`|AA11916920	I watched the game last night and I could not stop cheering.

Like the other people said, second time in 8 nights.... hmmm there's that number 8 again.....  8 - 0 , 8 - 2 .....<br>  it has been obvious for years that the Red Wings need an NHL goalie, but with the skills that they can throw out there on 4 different lines, and the salary cap situation, there hasn't been ENOUGH of a need to go get one....  Now there is....<br>  For years we paid $8 Million dollars a year for the Flop-O-lator (aka Hasek) to roll around in front of the crease.  Then again, we had the likes of the players in front of him to bail his *** out....<br>  Ozzie got us to a cup again with all the tallent being in front of him...<br>  Hell Mike Vernon even won back in the 90's and he couldn't stop a beach ball.....<br>  You know they say that the goalie is only as good as the defense in front of him....  So if the defense is going to give the puck away, the goalie can too....  at one point tonight the wings had 15 give aways....<br>  Of course after all this goalie bashing, the stars of this team DO need to step up and score a little....<br>  One last thing, if the Wings aren't going to  spend the money on a goalie, then they should spend it on a (Chris Pronger style) defenseman.  The Wings get pushed around in our end, their end I'll bet even in the bathroom......  We need some toughness.....  Downey AIN"T it.....

They are able to put out an exceptionally high rate of fire due to having a trip-beam system for their firing mechanism, however, they are also exceptionally light.  For speedball, this is excellent, for woods and accuracy, it isn't as the kick from the marker is more than enough to blow accuracy out of the water.<br>  <br>  On the other end of the spectrum, a marker I actually own, is one that has an extremely low rate of fire (8 round clip mech) is the Tiberius T9.  This marker utilizes a completely different set up internally.  It can take one hell of a beating, I finally broke my stock after using it for everything from a crutch to hooking onto things to climb up it, yes, it can support your weight.  The T9 takes 8 round clips with 12 gram CO2 cartridges which will give you 23 full shots and only 1 drop off.<br>  <br>  The biggest difference between the T9 and others is that instead of just controlling the amount of air leaving the marker, it controls the amount of air entering it, therefore providing much more control throughout.  The chronograph spike usually registers only 1 fps above the rest (ie readings would be 190, 190, 190, 190, 191, 190).  This, along with its slightly heavier body, provides a great deal of consistency.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind you can still attach an air hose and hopper to this marker, but the lower silhouette is very good to have.  The T9 build out to a full rifle or all the way down to just a pistol, or anywhere in between.  The company's assembly team consists of only 12 people, and they take care to do their best on every marker.  The pistol itself runs around $250-$300, the full set up will run about $500-$600... <br>  <br>  I love my Tiberius, she is my baby, her name is Susan.|`|T2pcuhTAaa	NO DO NOT GET A SPYDER IF YOU HAVE THAT MUCH<br>  Get a Dangerous Power Gun (Threshold) If can find one, here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ansgear.com/category_s/432.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ansgear.com/category_s/432.ht...</a><br>  <br>  OR go with the Dye's (dm8) :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ansgear.com/category_s/432.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ansgear.com/category_s/432.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Spyder i a low end marker, and things like Dyes, Egos, DPs, Smart Parts, Proto, Invert, or any of these really lol:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ansgear.com/category_s/432.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ansgear.com/category_s/432.ht...</a>|`|cPSCcIHPaa	just the gun or whole set-up?<br>  <br>  for gun i would go for.<br>  08 ego brand new $800<br>  or a bob long vice around $775?

Two of the biggest faces in the history of the WWE. How could you not want something like that. The mind-games that Taker would put Cena through would be priceless. Cena's facial expressions are priceless. I could see this match-up being historic. I think it will be huge. I think it will work. I really want to see it happen. Maybe, next year! I think Cena will work great with Taker. Even with Kane. I want to see that match-up as well. I really think that Cena vs Taker would be perfect. Cena is way better than people give him credit for. Both men will make this feud very memorable. I'm sure the matches will be awesome too. I think it would be great for Cena's career.
UzhfaJH2aa	Mixed feelings about the win regulation time. I believe an overtime win to be as well earned, but not the gimmick (shootout) wins. Problem is, how do you separate the two (o/t and s/o)?  By now you already know what I think of shootouts anyway. So, yeah I like the concept, if overtime wins can be separated, add them too.<br>  <br>  The "unfair due to suspension" thing is BS. Happens all the time in every sport. Suspensions happen when they happen due to a player's action. Columbus had no part in when the suspensions took place, the fact that it worked out to their advantage is coincidental. What if, by fate of the schedule, Detroit was scheduled to play and beat a much weaker team. Others would be complaining the Wings got off too easy. You can't have it both ways. <br>  As for players sitting out due to an impending trade, this is entirely different. Players are asked to sit by the team to avoid injury so they are able to trade them. As happened in Toronto, both traded players were moved for draft picks who obviously aren't playing yet. The Leafs who deserately need the draft picks could lose more by playing Antropov and Moore than sitting them. Correct me if I'm wrong, but a GM has to make the decisions that are in the long term interest of the team, it is the coaches responsibility to to make the best possible effort to win with the players at his disposal. The Leafs played a solid game before losing in OT to a stronger NJ team, so the coach and remaining players fulfilled their obligation. Could the Leafs have won the game with Antropov and Moore in the lineup? Possibly, but the long term benefit of the team could have been effected due to an untimely injury. Certainly some grey area here with win today at all costs vs. long term good od the team, and who is responsible for which in the eyes of the league. Again, who has an advantage is at the mercy of the schedule leading up to draft day. Yup, nitpicking here.|`|d99be0a297eb55283057cdf9435b9e4faa	The system which makes some games worth 3 and others worth 2 is aboslutely flawed.  Once you think about is logically it makes no sense.  Should go back to the original system of wins (2) loss (0) tie (1) no shootouts.<br>  All-Star game is a waste of time, haven't watched it in 25 years.|`|G33E41IBaa	I agree that the tiebreaker should be wins in regulation.  That shows that the team was able to get a definitive win without the extra 5 minutes, or shootout.  I feel that teams who win in the shootout don't show that they're the better overall team.  They just show that they're good in the shootout.  Almost always, it's the forwards who get to take the shot, and it's the goalie making the save.  What about the defensemen?  They're not taking part in the shootout.  So I think wins in regulation show the real team effort that deserves to be counted in the event of a tie.<br>  <br>  Of course, I think the All Star Game suspension is stupid to begin with, so they should just get rid of it completely.  If players don't want to play in the ASG, they shouldn't be forced to.  But claiming there's an upset of a "competitive balance" is really no arguement.  The players are only out for one game, and players get injured/suspended all the time.  If anything, it's a measure of how well the team can stay consistent without their star players.<br>  <br>  Also, I think teams should pick whoever they want to scratch or not.  If they want to scratch players that are about to be traded, it's the team's choice.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	In 1989, the Calgary Flames fielded a minor league team for the last game of the year (they sat Loob, MacInnis, Suter, Fleury, Gilmour, Nieuwendyk, and Otto).  It was common practice in the 80s for teams to do this.  (Calgary beat Edmonton 4-2)<br>  <br>  A wealthy season ticket holder in Calgary launched a lawsuit against the NHL the next day claiming that he paid to see certain players, he expected to see certain players.  The NHL asked an Alberta judge to throw it out.  He chose not to.  That summer (June 1989), the NHL instituted a rule (that stands to this day I believe) that ALL teams must at ALL times put out their STRONGEST lineup onto the ice for EACH and EVERY game.<br>  <br>  The last few years, an increasing number of teams have been sitting out players prior to the trade deadline (and the last game of the year) and it got me to thinking.....what do the fans think of this practice?<br>  <br>  <br>  Personally, I think that a team should put out the best players at all times.  Just ask Dan Boyle..................being out of the lineup is no guarantee that one will stay healthy.  <br>  <br>  LITY's Rant|`|AA10960806	A player has control over whether or not he goes to the all-star game, but does not have control over a trade (generally).  Therefore, I don't have a problem with a player sitting before a trade that he knows about.<br>  <br>  I like Holland's idea, but maybe only for shootout victories because they take away what used to be tie games.|`|9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	I missed the Hot Stove but you will always have me on your side over any of the 3 point crap. Yes, the idea of regulation wins makes very good sense, I have noticed a whole lot of games where teams sit back the last few minutes of a game if they are tied so as not to risk that 1 point. It is disgusting! As for the extra point earned in a shootout, again....hate it. Both teams should have to live with 1 point if the OT ends without a winner, wouldnt that inspire teams to go hard for the win in OT? That would make the extra point valuable in my mind if they feel a need to give away a third point.<br>  <br>   As for the all star and healthy scratch stuff, it is all stupid politics to begin with. If the all star game were actually played for the fans that is one thing but it is a catered event to the sponsors and if they feel the need to "hang" with the players why does it have to be during the season to begin with? Wouldnt most prefer maybe a skills show and a round of golf with their favorite hockey player? The all star game is basically a circus event and most fans dont watch it anyways (I dont). And the guys who sat at the deadline, that seems like the wise thing to do, wouldnt a lost trade potentially affect the competitive balance too if one gets injured?  Yea, a little nitpicky (cant believe I am in total agreement with Bob...but when you are right you are right).|`|pOXw1pKWaa	Seeing that last year a team going 15-12-65 would have made the playoffs, yes the system is screwed.. would a 3 point system really make a lot of difference?? Maybe, maybe not..  I say award 2 points for a win only and no more be it regulation, OT or a shootout..<br>  <br>  The last bit--- Nitpicky.. It was 1 game.. The team sitting these players knows they may jeapordise the win by sitting these guys..  other hand-- they may play and get hurt... A bit passe IMO..<br>  <br>  Personally I think the whole ASG  needs to be rethought so the players are atleast giving SOME effort instead of it being like a Harlem Globetrotters on ice shootfest... <br>  Give the winning conference home ice advantage for the S. C. Finals or something..|`|yHvh7tFlaa	I only caught the part about the ASG suspensions and the trade deadline scratches.<br>  <br>  As far as ASG suspension, I can't believe I am agreeing with Milbury, just get rid of the ASG,lol.  Seriously, it was just the luck of the schedule. Who's to say Detroit would have won the game even if those two players were in?<br>  As far as the trade deadline, GM's have a responsibility to the fans(well at least they're supposed to), to do what's best for the team. If that means protecting potential trade assets, then so be it.  The players that were scratched weren't superstars. Anaheim didn't sit Pronger on March 3rd. Other teams need to stop complaining.  Maybe if there were no "3 point games" there wouldn't be a need for some teams to complain,as they would be out of a playoff spot sooner.

JKIWCgbUaa	a good goal for squat for u by june should be 50 more pounds so about 325.  that is really good that you can squat 275 and you are only 5'5'' 155 i am very impressed.  try not to only concentrate on this one goal though. set goals for every core lifting exercise like bench and power clean. im also 16, i squat about 375 right now but im 6 foot and 185 pounds.  good luck with your goal i think u can make it.

I once read on his page he was dating mccool but then it disappeared. I don't trust the internet. No one ever has the CORRECT answer. You will only know if you actually ask him or her if they are dating eachother. Don't trust wrestling sites or wikipedia. Some pictures can be decieving. Just because they are walking together doesn't mean they are an item|`|8jK33jK1aa	Yes they are dating.<br>  He is either separated from Sara or they are going through a divorce or are divorced now.|`|SJJEF5Vyaa	No Sara and Undertaker got divorced.|`|6eWFZ0vyaa	are you a moron? every one knows that undertaker only goes out with michelle mccool on sundays, the rest of the days are devoted to santino. didn't you hear, they were going out?

WnQ3fhVhaa	1) Panthers, Pavel Bure <br>  2) Roberto Luongo <br>  3)Nope <br>  4)Good luck Bills , you will need it, signed a Dolphin fan <br>  5)NOt sure of in the history of the NHL since there have been many. So I will go with the history of the Panthers and Say Larionov. He headbutted with the coach pretty early after we signed him and then he never really played for us that long. It was sad, because I thought the world of him as a player and when I met him , he was nice as can be. Then some of the players I talk to had told me what happened .<br>  6)I would call that leaning toward the bad side. Gilmour is a great player , but there have been many in that time span <br>  7)Well if it is freezing, just another place to play hockey .|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	1. Philly is full of stars. We even had that lockerroom cancer Terrell Owens. He is the worst thing that can happen to a football team. He will work on destroying their QB and dividing the room. I can't believe another team would have him. Truth be told, he isn't even that talented, he alligator arms catches and goes out of bounds to avoid hits, he doesn't have great hands either. At this point, I don't even look at him as a superstar anymore, he is more bad than good. Have fun with that.<br>  <br>   2. That midget that played for your team (Briere).......if you want to call him a major star....Mike Richards/Jeff Carter are bigger stars IMO and have both signed on in the last year. The Flyers have never been unwilling to spend!<br>  <br>   3. Sean Avery.....if we needed an agitator and he was cheap..sure, maybe.......I liken Avery more to a Rodman than an Owens. Although they can both destroy a dressing room it would seem so perhaps it is a good comparison.<br>  <br>  4. See above. The price was right but look at it like this.......when the Cowboys release a player with some talent but attitude you KNOW it aint good.<br>  <br>  5. Hmmm.....Yashin maybe?<br>  <br>  6. Depends I guess<br>  <br>  7. Since the NETHERLANDS beat the Dominican Republic in baseball today, I would have to say yes. Although maybe not, I don't see a Stanley Cup parade in Toronto.|`|blLBh6YXaa	1&2. Im a Rangers fan so you know we're notorious for signing big name stars, Drury, Gomez, Naslund, Redden, recently.<br>  <br>  3. We have Avery and i love him, i wanted him back after last year and im glad we got him back.<br>  <br>  4. Good for the Bills they def have a very dangerous receiving core now but TO will probably cause problems.<br>  <br>  5. Im not sure but this question reminds me of Eric Lindros when he didnt want to go to Quebec and they traded him to Philly<br>  <br>  6. Bad<br>  <br>  7. Could be|`|9wblT5sYaa	1. TO, get your popcorn ready baby cause there's gunna be a show!!<br>  <br>  2. Sabres gave to NHL charity - Drury, briere, campbell, zubrus.  signed would be mooore.<br>  <br>  3. well we've got TO with the bills.  sabres need that spark for the 8th spot so why not?  he's got the talent to help the team, its just the ego you have to deal with<br>  <br>  4. love it.  real roll of the dice, but that's why you gamble on a guy like him.  I never thought we would make a bug splash like this in free agency. I just hope Trent can get back throwing the ball well with confidence, and if he does TO will produce which in tern will help out Lee and the other WRs. this WILL make us a huge contender. plus even if it doesn't work out, its just a one year deal.cant wait for Bills season to start. <br>  <br>  5.  diepetro.  not thats its really his fault.  but lets put a lifetime contract on a guy who's hurt all the time.  doesnt really help your team when you #1 investment isnt even in the building<br>  <br>  6.  yes, when you root for teams like I do (Bills, Sabres, Twins) who spend money on free agent players like a bargain shopper at Savealot's you've got to make a splash once in a while for the sake of the fans and franchise.<br>  <br>  7.  maybe.  but if TO helps the Bills then tailgating may seem a bit warmer!!!!|`|UzhfaJH2aa	... and you should be concerned.<br>  <br>  1) Leafs last big name signing was Eric Lindros. Past his prime, of course but still a big name. A recurring theme with Leafs of the old regime. Blue Jays signed Frank Thomas (see Lindros comment) 2 years ago.<br>  <br>  2) see 1<br>  <br>  3) He's a local boy, Avery's mom in the stands might tone him down a bit. Still, too big of a gamble.<br>  <br>  4) I can't see this working on any level, in any city, for any reason.<br>  <br>  5) Avery is the most noted that I can think of, but still a rank amateur compared to Owens.<br>  <br>  6) Would have been a big deal if they did it 5 years earlier. Gotta give them some credit for building good teams without big name signings.<br>  <br>  7) Aside from what Bob would have you believe, it will take a lot more than hell freezing over to bring that parade in Toronto. Ooh, did I say that out loud? A sure sign that hell has froze over would be Owens playing there a second year.|`|jBXutMblaa	1. Redskins got Albert Hayneswoth for a friggin $100 million.  I don't think he's worth THAT much seeing as I'm pretty sure he hasn't played a full season yet.<br>  <br>  2. Nothing this year, but last year we got Huet and Fedorov.<br>  <br>  3. Pass.<br>  <br>  4. I feel terrible for them.  I just wonder if anyone in that organization can keep him in check.<br>  <br>  5. I suppose Avery.<br>  <br>  6. Bad.<br>  <br>  7. Possibly.  It would have definitely be freezing over if Dan Snyder had signed TO like reports were saying.  I'm pretty sure Skins fans would've been pissed.  The last thing we need is our offense falling apart even more.<br>  Oh, and agreed with Bob on the Netherlands beating the Dominican Republic.  Seriously?  Maybe they need A-Roid.|`|b968135aa7c66a65962cda183d025043aa	Owens will not give headaches to the bills staff inmediately. Remember, Owens delivers one or two productive years before becoming a locker room cancer. I think he can have a productive year and help out to lift the offense. With a solid target like Owens, Edwards will boost his numbers and therefore his confidence for the upcoming years as the bills starting QB.<br>  <br>  It is wise from the Bills organization to have signed Owens to only one year. They can rid inmediately of the problem if TO goes against the team.
NC2BfEvLaa	I go right the souvenir trailer and make my wallet lighter. Then go get something to eat and then to the stands .|`|iO12Vjnvaa	If I have pit passes....I head there first and try to get as many autographs as possible. If not I check out the souvie trailers and the Martinsville concession stands....YUM!<br>  <br>  Just an opinion as always.|`|7RUMbREoaa	I always camp out so the first thing I do after I find my spot is grab a cold beer with my buddies and look around at the area that I am camping in(with a HUGE smile on my face).After that,we get the tent set up and such,then walk around the campsite and get to know people.Note that I get there a day or two before the big race.|`|u4liwDhAaa	#1 rule is find your seats.  #2 rule is find the restrooms closest to your seats.  #3 rule is find the nearest beverage location.  #4 rule is to find a shady spot closest to your seats.  Then, you are on your own from there on out!  :+)  It's every man or woman for his or her self!  LOL|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Get there early and just check out everything I can!!|`|cKl8ZSrSaa	Go check out the souvenirs and try to find where all the free stuff is being given away at lol|`|XNdDrXAzaa	look at all the fans in awe of all the groovy people|`|W2R8TRDmaa	I arrive early to beat the traffic.  I beat the crowds to the souvenir park.  I go check out my seat while the inside of the track is somewhat empty.  I leave my food and beverages at my seat.  I go get batteries if I need them.  Then maybe, I'll take a nap in my car and/or listen to the radio.  Then I try to get back inside the track before the crowd tries to roll in.  I can usually get through the entire morning without waiting in a single line.|`|EHtFxGxMaa	I generally go find my seats. I get there early (although it's been A LOT of years) to make sure no-one has "scarfed" my seats.<br>  <br>  Then, depending on how much time till green, I will wander around the stands, food, etc.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	i am usually there way early so it is to the haulers i go then the stands. i am usually the first one at the seats and talk to whoever is up there.|`|MWSv1yfhaa	If there are cars on the track, we go to the grandstands first.  If we get there early or when there are no cars on the track then we usually either get something to eat or drink or scope out the souvenir haulers.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	I don't know.  I've only been to one race and it was a Busch race many years ago.  I was young enough I had to stay fairly close to my dad at that time.|`|vIcOdePzaa	If the cars are on the track we go straight to the seats, but if not then we walk around check things out, see who will be doing autograph sessions and see what stuff is where.|`|52Ycgnozaa	usually put our cooler at our seat and wander around the trailers and buy stuff and go the bathroom and go to our seats|`|d1APITmkaa	I go to pocono every year and we stay in the infield in our RV. We get there the thursday before the race and we set up our RV. We camp out the entire weekend. We watch both practices and qualifying. During qualifying you can buy pit/paddock passes and go on behind the pit road wall. Most of the drivers sign autographs. I've gotten Jeff Gordon's autograph 3 times. I've gotten kasey Kahne's and a couple other drivers. I've noticed that for the fans that sit in the bleacher seats, they start arriving early, 6 hours or so before the race. I've been to Daytona and Lowes motor speedway and sat in the grand stands. For those races I got there early, found my seat, then walked around the souvenir haulers for a few hours. Nascar does a good job of putting on shows so you'll be entertained 2 hours or so before the drop of the green flag, and for the time before that, just walk around. It is a lot of fun.|`|GCOrku95aa	When I would go to the Spring Dover Busch races, we would first go to the souvenier trailers, shop a little while, then head back to where we parked, ate lunch, then went inside the track about an hour before the race started, watched the race, then came back to our cars, ate dinner, then waited for the parking lot to empty a bit before we headed home. Left at 7 in the morning, got home about 10 that night.|`|3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	We usually get there the day before, set up our campsite and go to all the souvenir stands, grab something to eat and head back to the campsite. B/S with the others on our site, have a campfire, just relax n laugh a lot. Go get a shower n get ready to go to bed so we can get up early the next day to go watch quals. It's Bristol & it's great!|`|smDClNDkaa	Hop out of the van, Look at the Track breath in the Michigan air, head over to the souvenir trailers, buy some stuff and see when Drivers are going to be signing stuff.  Then Saturday go wait in line for some Autographs.<br>  Sunday nothing until about 1 when we leave the van and do the 25 minute walk to the track.<br>  Man i hate the 2:20 green flag.|`|p8JfOlTzaa	It is a long trip for me usually, the bathroom is first, then the food, beer etc.  I've found that alot of the vendors have the souvineers slot cheaper after the race!|`|aBVOHkRTaa	Open a BEER,Set up the Motor Home,open a beer,open another BEER,tune in the scanners,OPEN A BEER !!!|`|ko3AhLJsaa	I got to teh trailers to see when people r doing autograph sessions then I go over to the raceday stage then we usually go find our seats|`|cYIppAUdaa	find seats, find bathrooms, find beer, program scanner, check out new Tony Stewart gear, take all the above to seats, enjoy!!!|`|bTZGob8qaa	Merchandise trailer, Sadler gear is tough to come by. To see it all in one place is like Heaven.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	For me it's the bath room first thing !! LOL|`|x1fp1vESaa	i normally go to my seats and then go to the pits and then the garages it is really fun !!!!!|`|hS4qvqCwaa	i take a piss because the car ride is so long|`|UVb2a1BZaa	I normally program my scanner... I need to do that before beer or I want be able to do it....|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	I get out of my car...LOL!!! Seriously we get there pretty early (breakfast at 5am to the track by 7:30 or 8) and just hang out in the parking lot for a while, set up our tent and chairs and just enjoy watching everyone roll in it's so much fun just see all the different people and crazy set ups they do.  We always end up hooking up with 4-5 car loads and party a bit with them just hanging out trash talking is fun.  Pack our beverages in coolers, make sure I have extra batteries for my camera and head on in to the track then we hit the restrooms then the tents & trailers for souvenirs and then drop off everything at our seats, have a beverage or two there while admiring the view.  Then off to the SPEED stage & Pits.  Back in our seats at least 1 hour before green flag for the track festivities.  After the race we head back to the cars and continue to tail-gate for hours usually with whoever we met in the parking lot before the race, fire up the grills and break out more beverages it's easier than fighting traffic and don't worry we are safe and always have a designated driver in the group.  We haven't camped in years there, I miss that.  But I still love race day.  We don't ever get home till 10 or 11 at night then I watch the whole day over again on my DVR....LOL!  I got it bad.

This can be confirmed using the NHL Guide and Record Book which recognizes 23 as the record (and acknowledges that the franchise itself has 24).  The NHL only recognizes Stanley Cups won while the NHL has been in existence.<br>  <br>  First of all................Montreal only had a 50 mile radius to work with.  Toronto had a 50 mile radius to work with from Toronto, as did Detroit.  The Rangers and Hawks had most of the Prairies at their disposal (remember, Gordie Howe was a Ranger before he was a Red Wing)<br>  <br>  When expansion came about.  Both Montreal and Toronto had 13 cups each, but Toronto had won more games, and had a higher winning percentage (how things have changed in the last 40 years).  People tend to forget that Montreal wasn't always the number one team in the NHL (the 9 Stanley Cups between 1956 and 1969 tend to throw people off). <br>  <br>  So, up until the draft, Montreal AND Toronto dominated things because they were the most populous cities.  Even today, you will just as many gems within the city of Montreal as you will in Alberta/Saskatchewan/Manitoba combined.  Same with Toronto.<br>  <br>  When you look at the cups Montreal win in the 70s, a lot of those players could have been had by any team.  Dryden? Drafted by Boston.  Lafleur and Shutt?  Either could have been drafted by anyone (Montreal traded for the right to draft Lafleur - nobody twisted Glover's arm).<br>  <br>  <br>  The primary myth that needs to be debunked is that Montreal had a territorial avantage prior to the draft.  ALL NHL teams had designated 50 mile limit from around their arena to protect players prior to their 18th birthday (sadly, I was not one of those and had to seek employment elsewhere).   Montreal and Toronto (and to a lesser extent Detroit) made this work for them.  Naturally Chicago, Rangers, and Boston were at a disadvantage because their 50 mile radius had no Canadian territories (hockey was not as big in America back then).<br>  <br>  So, if Montreal's territorial advantage was as huge as some people suggest?  Why did Toronto have more Stanley Cups after the 1964 season? (12 to 11)  The first 47 years of territorial advantage didn't do it for Montreal?  Was Toronto's territorial advantage better (since they had more wins)?<br>  <br>  Of Montreal's 1976 Cup team, only 4 of the top 16 scorers were exempt from the draft due to territorial rights (Cournoyer, Lapointe, Savard, Lemaire).  The other 12 players and the goaltender, could have been anybody's.<br>  <br>  LITY's rant
PqmmyV6baa	No, because hw wasn't playing when they got out the first round, but you know McGrady always has an excuse for everything, so he will say he was part of the team when they did.

IF the team makes it out of the first round, I think T-Mac will still say he hasn't been past the 1st round so that he still has the determination to get there.
nRBC4E5saa	I'd say it's the other way around.  Many sports have evolved out of martial arts.  A martial art based on sport would be hockey-fu.<br>  <br>  I don't train MA primarily for the sake of entering a sporting competition, but I train them in a format used in sports.  My experience is that hard-contact sparring and the like produces better results in a shorter period of time than many alternative training methods.<br>  <br>  No, I don't think martial arts would be as popular without a competitive side to them.  In a time where lawlessness is uncommon in the West, and anyone can own a weapon like a firearm, stun gun, or knife, empty-handed self-defense methods that take months or years of training to use effectively just aren't very practical.|`|sJrnFCrgaa	Well the sports that are out there are based on the Arts. Not the other way around. The traditional arts came first. When an art is turned into a sport, the art is cut down from its true purity by forcing the art to work within rules and limitations. traditional arts contain much more depth and understanding.|`|o7FWjwetaa	No, martial arts aren't based mainly on sports.  And of course I would continue martial arts if it weren't a sport.

qqbcVC0qaa	I am also 15 and have a handicapp of 9. I play for my club and hopefully will turn pro. I did some reasearch and for us to have a realistic chance we need to get to around scratch at 18. so keep working hard. if you really want it you could do it.|`|QxIhMHwAaa	14.5 is pretty high...It really depends on how much you practice. Professional golfers are scratch golfers/have a handicap of 0. It can be possible if you are completely dedicated to the sport, then again it may not as competition is pretty fierce. I have two friends from high school that had been trying to be pro golfers for about 5-7 years. They're both awesome (one is John Merrick who has been a pro for about 4 years now), the other hasn't been able to make it yet. <br>  <br>  Try to get in as many junior tournaments as you can and then try to qualify for amateur tournaments when you are able to. Keep progressing from there and practicing. Getting lessons/a pro to help you out now may be beneficial for the future as well. It always helps to have an outside perspective on your swing. If this is your dream, stick with it, and don't give up!|`|WBEfJs2Caa	It's possible but very hard. When I was 15 I was about a 7 handicap and I have to tell you, when you start getting down there it gets harder and harder to just get one stroke better.

Good luck, but you need to start to be a 4.5 if you want to succseed in this great game...<br>  <br>  Just remember you can make a lot of $ on other tours (European)<br>  <br>  And being a pro, just simply means your not an amateaur.

Whether Jeff did drugs or not, he is still a good wrestler.  In his own way, he is probably more entertaining too.  When it comes to Edge or Randy they get slaps on the wrist by WWE and fans because it is never marked as front page news.  I wouldn't even be sure if the whole Wellness policy the WWE has is even regulated half the time. Even when it is a wrestler bringing in fans and money, he is pretty sure he isn't getting a suspended.|`|05RmoBJ6aa	Most wrestlers do drugs as far as I know. It's just that sometimes some wrestlers are more known for their drug use (e.g. Jeff Hardy) than others. Oftentimes it's just because some wrestlers look like they actually do drugs (e.g. jacked-up ones like Batista, Brock Lesnar, Randy Orton, etc).<br>  <br>  It's completely untrue that smaller wrestlers don't do or have never taken drugs. A lot of them do.|`|R4au9H2maa	Jeff's drug problems are a lot more public then other wrestlers<br>  Also he has been caught more, getting fired for using drugs and having two strikes.

If you don't like a wrestler for drugs that leaves you very few to actually be a fan of, most wrestlers have had a issue with drugs at some point in there career whether we know about it now or we find out about it later the numbers that haven't will be small. It's sad but anything negative is used by people who are not fans as a reason but they are just excuses for those unable to express views about a wrestling in an intelligent meaningful way.|`|VBfhoqS3aa	The rest of them use drugs such as testosterone, where as Jeff Hardy smokes weed.|`|2rJwgk40aa	Thank you.I think people that dont like jeff use the drugs as a reason because they cant find a good reason to actually hate him.They seem to completly forget that other guys have used them too.Hell,eddie guerrero was a drug addict who cleaned his life up and no one attacked him for it.HBK used to be one too.There are guys in the hall of fame who either used or died from drug overdoses.Still no one mentions them.|`|NRs72Afxaa	Some people forget about others that use drugs.

BB6HGbnPaa	Use it is. Your track spikes dont have the cushioning that regular running trainers have. So it will hurt your feet a lot more than if you run with trainers on. ONLY run with tracks spikes when needed. To fix it, buy trainers or take your spikes off when you are not using it and put them back on when starting again (I know its annoying but its better than having your legs hurt after practice).|`|HlD9dRF2aa	You use different muscles for speed work.  Also track spikes don't have any support and that will also affect which muscles will be worked harder. More effort is put on the calves as you're nearly on your toes the whole time in spikes.<br>  <br>  Muscle imbalance? Usually that's due to using one leg more than the other (running on the right side of the road all the time) or breathing to only one side when swimming.<br>  <br>  Fix it with a good soak in a hot tub and leg drains.

Kallis and Smith are two of the toughest nuts playing the game.

F2OQVXRtaa	Mr Grey--really?  Collins??  Really?  <br>  <br>  This isn't perhaps the most brilliant move but it certainly seems an upgrade. The west-coast offense benefits with a high completion percentage QB. Sage has averaged 62% in his career with 64-69% in the last three seasons. He's done that with most defenses playing pass coverage (because, really, did Houston have a run game?). Compare that with T-Jacks 58% (at best) and you get part of the picture. Add to this the fact that Sage has been sacked only 16 times in 32 games over the past three years (compared with T-Jack's 41 times in 25 games) and you get another part of the picture. To be completely honest, I don't know if Sage is a better game-manager than Gus but he seems a better option than T-Jack in most areas. And Sage is 7 years younger than Gus. So, he's younger and more mobile than Gus (who was sacked 40 times in the last 19 games) with the same completion percentage (aka: good game management). Definitely better completion percentage than T-Jack. The Vikings will not get Cassell (bad blood with Belichick), McNabb (Eagles aren't that dumb), nor do they want Garcia (older than Gus, questions of durability, etc). If you know a better QB out there that the Vikings can get please let me know...but considering they just need someone to NOT screw up--Sage is a decent choice. <br>  <br>  Let's not forget, people, Trent Dilfer has a Superbowl ring (and we all know why)!|`|43daa72d6abd58775d0e46a24824eddeaa	i think sage will do good with the vikings, he has one of the best running games in the business. it's AP's team not sage's. they don't need him to save them. all he needs to do is hand the ball off to AP. when the times comes for him to throw the ball he's capable of being a good general on the field. i like sage, but he and kubs couldn't get along and he was under so much pressure in houston playing for the oft-injured QB they had. so he'll do just fine.|`|UgnMjtYDaa	That was a waste.

Other than by mouthing off constantly about being "disrespected" all the time and not getting enough passes thrown his way I don't think Winslow makes a huge impact in Tampa.|`|acaAycEXaa	That's too bad.

The Dodgers have one of the finest farm systems in the game. Along with the A's, Marlins, Giants and Diamondbacks they have the strongest crop of young players in MLB today. What they 'need' is a strong veteran presence to carry these young players while they mature. And that would be where Manny comes in. <br>  <br>  The Dodgers lost not a single key player, they signed the only one that really mattered (Furcal), and picked up pieces. Penny is washed up, and Lowe, while solid, is aging, so his loss isn't as bad. True, they are relying a bit overmuch on young pitchers, but that's hardly a reason to write them off. They destroyed the Cubs last year because of Manny and their young talent. No reason they won't do it this year either. They are very much World Series contenders, if they can get Manny (or another big bat, but he's the only one left)|`|IeLBIACaaa	manny has declined a few deals now from the dodgers.  he declined a 1 year 25 million dollar contract with an optional year added on for 20 million.<br>  He stricktly wants a long term deal.  he wants a 4-5 year contract even if its much less money like 4 years 60 million.

Kenpo is a good stand up art. if kenpo was my only art i would diverse myself into Japanese Jujitsu to learn ground work. im not sure but i think Chinese kempo uses a grappling system known as chin na, which is still stand up. so i think the ground is where you can improve best.|`|CdAE4nXcaa	chinese kenpo is a striking art right, i would at onto your style of fighting by adding brazilian jiu jitsu, or some form of ground fighting with submissions.  because your not a good fighter unless you are well rounded.|`|Xs1cXFjPaa	Why would you want to quit after 11 years? That's a long time of effort and dedication put into kenpo. Well, if you really want to move on, I'd have to say that your body or looks aren't relevant to what style you want to do. You should look into different martial arts that you have an interest in, and see which you like best.
ck1wvh91aa	Let's hope so. Yes we have been burned in the past, but you can't let that stop you from pursuing an elite player. Don't forget that the Skins have also signed some free agents who have performed well over a number of years.  Ideally, they would build through the draft, but since Vinny Cerrato (who needs to be fired) does not believe in drafting D linemen in the 1st round, you have to do what you can to fill the holes.<br>  <br>  Big Matt - Peppers is an end, a position that picks up more sacks and tackles. 8.5 sacks for a tackle is a big number. Plus, good interior linemen often take on double teams so that their teammates can make the play.|`|RrKeyYo0aa	he won't play the whole contract... guarantee you that. 41 million guaranteed? i predict that he will find a way out of this contract so he can take advantage of next years "no cap". 41 mil in his pocket plus whatever he can steal in next years free agency... flawless victory. these guys make me sick. i miss the 80's.|`|acaAycEXaa	Nope.

The coaches at Tennessee have been talking about Haynesworth being a big time player since his second season but he was lazy and when they put him on the bubble 3 years ago he started to dominate. He hasn't had a problem with motivation the last couple years which is great but the guy is turning 29 next year and the skins guaranteed this guy more money than anyone else in the history of the game and he'll collect most of it before he's 32 (which by the way is where most tackles start to decline) i'm worried about him becoming the same lethargic underachiever he was a couple years ago. And it's not like he's a mature vet after stomping out another player and always getting in fights with his team mates. Another thing im worried about is how much of his prescience came from teams having to focus on the phenomenal defense around him. There were a couple times when haynesworth was taking breathers and injured that their rookie DT was exploding through the line.... i think they paid this guy too much and i know he'll produce next year but how much can one guy do on our defense? The titans have had one of the best defenses in the league for about 3 years, and which is about when albert started to do well and i don't think his play alone made them great.|`|f7qVtYfaaa	he better play hard and not get lazy now that he got the deal done. if he plays one strong year and then relaxes that is gonna be an expensive year's pay !|`|43daa72d6abd58775d0e46a24824eddeaa	a player gets rewarded with a big contract based on what he's done in the past season, or if he's a free agent and good the previous year, a team hopes that he can duplicate that season....so it's a gamble and that team has to live with it. haynesworth is a beast and his presence on the field alone demands special attention. with taylor and haynesworth on the field the offense of other teams will have a fit|`|KZsdVGJzaa	eh the only problem i really have with the contract is the guaranteed. If he was guaranteed like 15-20 mil then yea i wouldn't have a problem since u didn't lose that much. but he's guaranteed almost half of his contract. u better pray that he doesn't get lazy and have freak injuries like he did in Tennessee|`|mTSOJKlyaa	peyton manning got a hefty contract and has been  good QB his whole career<br>  <br>  haynesworth has not been good his while career and just landed a mammoth contract in which he will most likely not live up to|`|hA5m65Waaa	You'll see when the Redskins finish 7-9 this year that Alberta wasnt worth it|`|cDKkKEgvaa	NO he is not.........he plays the position that gets payed the least on the defense.....defensive tackles shouldn't be making that much money it's ridiculous<br>  <br>  If you think about it the LBs are the ones making the most tackles and sacks not the defensive tackles <br>  <br>  Haynesworth has 271 tackles and 24 sacks in 7 YEARS!!!!-------this is worth $100 MILLION??????<br>  <br>  Julius Peppers has 340 tackles and 70.5 sacks in the same 7 years Haynesworth has been in the league.......what's up with that??

bwibB9Cnaa	Linebackers are the leaders of the defense. They should normally have the most tackles on the team. They are the most athletic guys on the D bcuz they must be both fast and strong. Also, they should be hard hitters. They have to be able to step up into a hole and be able to bring down a fullback. And at the same time they must be able to pursue a half back outside. Every now and then they have to cover though. But they think Stop Run! then Defend the Pass. To play this position you hav to be brutal and have no regard for others feelings. Just be an animal and get after the ball.|`|HnqedumSaa	linebackers are the center of the defense they almsot do it all, play run defense and drop into pass coverage, they dont run a lot ususally but if u get the ball run like hell, tips id give you is to keep your head on a swivel and watch for tricks, also there are things such as reads on the offensive linemen, your coach will tell you those since each team has different reads

l4WEwTWwaa	I would call them both overrated. Marciano and no offense since he is your fav fighter, but he did hit the division at a weak time in history when there was no one around. He also could have had that fight with Joe Louis way before Louis was a punch drunk old man, but no. He waited until Louis was done. But despite the fact that he was facing has beens in there late 30's he still had trouble with them. He was cut very badly in a fight against Ezzard Charles and nearly had the fight stopped before he rallied for a knockout. He also didn't even fight his first real opponent until 25-0. At that point in your career you shouldn't be fighting the guys he fought. These are there records, 16-1, 56-20, 23-6, 19-10. Are you kidding me, undefeated for 20 fights and you are fighting guys like that. Last but not least the greats held the title for years and years and re won it. Marciano held it for 3 years and then retired. His competition was lame and he retired barely having held the title. Yes, Marciano is highly overrated and would not have retired undefeated in any other era. Next, Chavez is somewhat overrated. I think he was a great champ and holds a few notable wins and held titles for years and all, but I wouldn't call him the greatest mexican boxer ever, to me that title will always belong to Salvador Sanchez. Here is a list of Marciano's opponents. <a href="http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?human_id=9032&cat=boxer" rel="nofollow">http://www.boxrec.com/list_bouts.php?hum...</a>|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	both underrated there record says it all there both great and careers try to catch there fights on classic sports|`|4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	I think it's universal that fans of any given fighter over-rate their favorite.  I do think that fans of both over-rate both more than most other fighters.  We saw what happened to Chavez against Whitaker, and that proved to me that I always knew about the Mexican:  a brilliant in-fighter, most specifically brilliant at generating power punches from short range, and super durable.  But almost helpless against a classic boxer.  And it bore out.  A legendary all-timer finds way of beating all the "shades of gray" styles of boxers/sluggers.<br>  <br>  Marciano never stepped into the ring against a young buck, nor a classic boxer.  Fans of his point to the undefeated run.  But that's all they have. <br>  <br>  Both fighters are over-rated by their fans, but I think impartial guys put both Marciano and Chavez into perspective.  So it's not the kind of terrible over-rating we saw of a pre-Barerra Hamed or a pre-Holmes Cooney.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	I consider them two of the greatest boxers to ever lace up the gloves.  Rocky Marciano is actually one of the most UNDER rated heavyweight champions in history.  Chavez needs no defense, his career speaks for itself as will.  Julio is still the greatest Mexican champion in the history of that country, which by the way produced a few fighters of note over the years.  Neither are overrated, and in truth neither are appreciated as much as they should be either.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	I think both of them are somewhat overrated, but not much, they were both great fighters and respected champions and did a lot of good for boxing. Chavez is viewed as some invincible punching machine and some people argue that because of the undefeated record Rocky should be considered the best of all time. I don't agree with either of these arguments and that is why I find both of these fighters overrated.|`|dh48AkbCaa	two all time greats who are definitely not over rated.|`|COMYLSBwaa	I think their both overrated at least a little bit although Chavez less so.  Marciano is overrated largely because he never proved himself vs the top guys at their peaks.  All of his big wins were against guys on the downside of their careers.  So while his resume looks nice when you look deeper you see he was really never tested like most other boxers have been becuase he retired right when he would have been tested (Floyd Patterson, Sonny Liston, maybe even Ali or Frazier, wow at the thought of Rocky vs Smokin Joe btw).  Chavez on the other hand fought ALOT of really good boxers, but because of his 3 digit number of wins & the length of his unbeaten streak from the beginning of his career (1 DQ loss earlier in his career was overturned to a KO win for those that are not aware-iirc his manager was on the board that helped overturn that loss also, lol) I think he is slightly overrated.  Again though Chavez did beat ALOT of really great fighters & was a staple of the top 10 boxers pound for pound for several years so I feel a little odd saying he's overrated even though I think its kinda sorta true.

Give it 2 years, I think the trade was a good thing for the Browns as they need the talent, so a couple of draft picks is something that they could really use.   They need another running back, and some help on defense. Shaun Rodgers can't do it all from DT.  They are a few years away from being a playoff contender.

His replacement spent 2008 in Seattle, hit .043 higher, drove in 24 more runs, and scored 11 more runs by comparison.  The Phillies improved in left field because they lost Burrell.<br>  <br>  If there is a weakness, it's the lefty specialist arm in the bullpen before June 1, but even if Scott Eyre isn't up to the task, that will be fixed after J.C.

Luckily Toronto looks like it is fucked and Redd is at the point of his career he wants out plus his offense is perfect for Mike D.<br>  <br>  I think the Knicks are 1 superstar (Bosh), 1 sharpshooter/All-star (Redd), and 1 shotblocker/defender (whomever) away from being title contenders. If all this happens Lee is a sure All-star.|`|bxnMQQMJaa	I'm guessing you guys lost to the Bobcats??|`|F0pd9LHlaa	Well thats not all the problems the team just doesn;t have a franchise player
YlBLz9lTaa	i think its a great move belichick knows how to utilize a players talent bett then anyone in the league and im sure it will be the same with taylor|`|Vkbgr94xaa	Not a big deal.  He'll be similar to Lamont Jordan and other veteran RB's the Pats have a had in the past. I'm sure they picked him up because he was cheap and will do the little things like picking up blitzes and adjusting to audibles which is ok....but if they really wanted to take a great offense to the next level they need a burner in the backfield like what Chris Johnson was last year. Not the easiest to find but thats what could really make them unstopable.  Taylor is just another solid locker room presence.|`|Ztsr2FK1aa	Did they cut Faulk?<br>  <br>  Taylor's age and durability will limit his touches and he'll have to play in cold weather more than half the year and you saw how that affects the older players (i.e. Favre).  They don't like it.|`|Hgm9qaf9aa	Its a good pick up for them.  I also think that they will draft a running back as well, because Maronhey can't stay healthy.  I think his days in a Patriots uniform are numbered.|`|Nha8TUq7aa	I agree, I thought he should've taken more snaps last year. I'm not a Jags fan but I hope Taylor can break that record he's close to.|`|qvuQSQvpaa	real smart. and i hate the patriots. but they always make very smart trades and draft picks|`|6AfM6SWaaa	im stoked-im a patriots fan-but who is fred taylor?|`|f7qVtYfaaa	it's a good move, he has good value at 9 - 10 carries a game and gives them a different look in the running game.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	I think its awesome...The Patriots have had a running game by committee in their current Super Bowl era...Heck, in 2001, the first Super Bowl winning season, their starting RB was Antwain Smith...<br>  <br>  Critics say Taylor is getting too old, but I say he's got a good 2-3 years left...I've ALWAYS liked Fred Taylor...<br>  <br>  As a Patriots fan, his unselfish attitude always reminded me of Troy Brown-just always willing to do whatever gives his team the best chance to win, regardless of how much actual gametime he gets...<br>  <br>  Also, Lawrence Maroney is good, but he's been a little inconsistent as the full-time starter, and been injury-prone the past couple years...So, Sammie Morris has been the best part of the Patriots' running game lately...<br>  <br>  If nothing else, the added RB competition should help CLEARLY establish who the Patriots starting RB should be...|`|UIi7B3UDaa	who the hell is that idiot telling how favre doesnt like to play in the cold weather, thats like saying clay aiken doesnt like boys. also i think taylor is a really solid back, good pickup, him morris and maroney are pretty good|`|7B9KEqCnaa	It adds depth and he can catch the ball out of the backfield.  He's a solid pickup and Im sure he wasnt too expensive.  Maroney's been somewhat of a bust so its a good insurance policy.|`|jLOCqhckaa	It was a great investment. I the Pats don't have that many options. But there defense is gonna tire out soon. They better draft some young blood.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	the pats need to focus on defense

They have a good running back but apparently they just want everyone to stack the box and stop him I guess.

I personally use Shoe Goo on my scope screw threads, which won't crack under stress, won't vibrate loose, and can be taken apart with ordinary tools. Regards, Larry.|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	It's a reasonable precaution to use Loc-Tite on the threads of a scope mount.  If you don't, you'll be more likely to over-tighten them 'just to be safe.'   I know only one person who actually has the proper torquing tool, although they are available from Brownells.  Choose the Loc-Tite for parts that are taken part and reassembled and always use a gunsmith's driver if you don't spring for the torque tool.  You can damage your fine scope, your mounts, your rifle's finish, snap a screw off and have to drill it out--why risk it?  Check the American Rifleman index for an article on this topic.<br>  <br>  BTW, this is one of the things you check when you go over the rifle for periodic maintenance.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Since 1996, Leupold has been using Torx screws.  They say Loc-Tite is not necessary for these type of screws and provide torque values for their products.  Personally, I don't have a clue what 65 inch pounds feels like using a Torx driver, but knowing the kind of abuse my stuff takes, the Loc-Tite makes sense as an easy precaution.  Belt and suspenders?  Ya, when it comes to my firearms.|`|TyBbn17uaa	Yes this can happen.  Though 300 is not that many this can happen.  On my .280 I shoot about 100 a year but sometimes they are loose and can affect performance.  I suggest Lock-tite for your friends, but yours should be safe.|`|datmqg7Aaa	I highly doubt it,the recoil from a 270 isn't that bad.They won't come loose in less you take them loose.|`|C4rVwbi7aa	iv never had that prob got a 30/06

bI3RrPqdaa	I was a former starting setter for my university.  I played for 4 years.  The biggest mistake I see young setters make is setting with their arms and wrists, a good setter sets with their legs and core.  Practice a lot, especially with your middles.  Don't be lazy, you are always the 2nd person to touch the ball.  Lastly, don't forget you are a blocker, work on that too.  Follow these steps and you should improve.  Watch the chick in the video, she has the makings of a good setter.|`|GFEhJYAAaa	get a weighted ball. nike has good weighted balls that we practice with and if you use them for a while and then pick up a normal volleyball, it feels like youre picking up air and setting will be ALOT easier!!|`|qZbx5H1saa	I use to be a starting setter for high school and middle school.  You have to train everyday.  That's what I did.  When I wasn't in school volleyball, I was training on my own and going to volleyball camps and clubs.  <br>  Train yourself by setting something that is heavy, but not too heavy.  You don't want to hurt yourself.  Also do some exercises with a basketball.  Try to set a basketball into the basketball hoop.  <br>  Remember always be confident.  Don't compare yourself to others.|`|jSc9sI6faa	Tips:<br>  -The setter on the court is normally the captain, so make sure you are talking to your team mates and encourage them if something goes wrong.<br>  - All Coaches lot it when you show leadership.<br>  -Try to know everyone's name and get to know how and where they like the ball to be set.<br>  -Talk to everyone and be a Leader.<br>  -Stay confident with yourself and you will do great!|`|vWXSQDWlaa	pretend like you have a ball in your hands and you are about to set it. put the ball at ur belly button then bring it up. and set like that|`|vgCw179baa	take private lessons and play club volleyball it relly helps and just practice alot|`|HGi8Irveaa	You can <br>  Practice with a heavier ball.<br>  Ask the Hitters where they want the set.<br>  and try to get it there...<br>  work on slides, quicks, and shoots

NkMXnQopaa	I started the same way when I was 17 and have been playing for over a year on ice now and I think I'm decent.<br>  <br>  First, get use to skating with goalie skates. Go to your local ice rink and hit up some open skate sessions. A goalie camp is a great idea to learn the basic concepts and not to form bad habits. They will teach things like crease movement, save selections, proper ways to stretch on and off the ice, etc. Being a goalie is both mentally and physically challenging. You can't let what players say or goals get to you. After awhile you learn to focus and ignore those types of things. You have to realize that behind the forwards is the defense and behind the defense is the goaltender and behind you is....well the net. You have no safety valve. Your also at the age where you probably will be lifting and running soon. A goalie is in the best shape out of the whole team. <br>  <br>  Make sure you ALWAYS stretch before you go on the ice and in pre- game warm ups. The last thing you want to do is tear a muscle. I learned the hard way and tore my groin and that hurts.<br>  <br>  I know it can be a lot of work but I believe it's worth it.<br>  <br>  Good luck kiddo and keep your head held high!<br>  <br>  Edit: If you have any other questions about this feel free to e-mail me.

BK1GjPT6aa	No, you do not need a license to fish from shore. You can be on shore or any structure fixed to the shore line and not need a license. Here's the catch, if you walk past 3 feet in the water,  had to swim to a shore line not affixed to land (or took a boat or other device to get there)  or are on an island you are no longer affixed to the shore line and you will need a fishing license. You're fishing off a bridge...a long azz one so don't worry about that. You also do not need a license if fishing off a party/head boat ( Reward fleet, Kelley fleet, and so on) or a charter that includes it. You can also fish off piers without worry but those are few and far in-between around here because most are busted up and haven't been repaired.  Haullover was the best around but that's long gone, now you have to fish the jetty which sucks because there's no parking. Anyways, you should check out <a href="http://www.myfwc.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.myfwc.com</a>  for the rules and regs concerning licenses. You can also pick up a few fishing spots around the Miami area you probably didn't know about. Dig deep, they're hidden.~good luck catchin'.
qC9pcfP5aa	Lack of oxygen will kill fish. If you leave them in a bowl with the same water eventually it will run out of oxygen and the fish will die. Why goldfish survive in bowls, I do not know, but most other fish will die. If you're transporting the minnows, I find that a insulated "cooler" will help keep them alive longer. You'll need some kind of aeration system to add oxygen to the tank if you plan to keep them. Aquarium stores have little aeroators/bubblers that add oxygen to the water. Filter systems do the same thing. <br>  If you're going to transfer the fish to a tank, then add a little bit of aquarium water to the pail with the fish and the pond water. After a few minutes add a little more. If the pail holds 1/2 gallon of water then add about 1/2 cup of aquarium  water to the pond water every five minutes for about 1/2 to one hour. That will allow the fish to slowly adjust to the water temperature and chemical content of your aquarium water.|`|7royFhIgaa	You can change the water but use lake or river water, and keep the water cold.|`|2bqmotqlaa	leave them in the trap in the water<br>  they should live as long as you dont have a lot in the trap<br>  bassmaster pro 6 yrs
A3raPhkDaa	2nd they have more size|`|HiuNSScLaa	team 1|`|4Mgiew1laa	team 2|`|w7gm67dPaa	this one's a a little more balanced out, but where's team 2's PF? Magic makes them better, Miller (Reggie, not Brad, rite?) spreads the floor, but again, no defense in team 2, other than shaq inside. Having LeBron with Magic looks trippy at first but i think it'd actually work ok..here, LBJ would thrive as a first-option scorer (other than banging it into Shaq). Defensively, though, Duncan would stop Bird (who i assume is the 4), and he'd overpower him on the block. Who'd be the 3 for Jordan's team, Kobe rite? lebron's quicker and his size WOULD give him an advantage, he's only 2 inches taller but he's more developed physically. Kobe might poke it away some, but he'd be playing out of position. Magic would go over O, miller'd have no chance against MJ, even if he just stroked it outside 80% of the game. i give it to team 1 again...Magic makes it more interesting though, he's the only thing that changes it, but you still need a solid PF to counter Duncan, think Karl Malone for more offense, or horace grant for solid D and rebounding, don't worry about scoring, you've got magic dishing to bird and lebron, and miller would get at least a few treys in (over Jordan i mean). But Duncan would be the game affecting winner here. good one...ill try one sometime...|`|OxtDZOyuaa	You'd still win. Kobe and Lebron are decently even. Oscar is better than Reggie Miller. Magic is probably better than Duncan. Wilt is bettter than Shaq in his prime and Jordan and Bird is no comparison. Jordan is clearly better. You still have the better team.|`|n9Y5vAyYaa	Well a lot of those are old guys so it would be Kobe and Duncan vs. Lebron and shaq. It Goes to the other persons team the king is to much.|`|6df1064f07a7ab1a1de0dbf65b266304aa	Team 2. Kobe and Jordan are both SG. Magic is the best point gaurd ever.

Cl6KbcAGaa	It is overpriced for what you get for starters. Yes it is a Specialized and with only 21 speeds (7speed) you dont get much for the $. This is one of their bikes that they produce in large #s to make a fast dollar to look good at the end of the year for the investors because they know it will sell. If you are paying more than $400 for this bike there are other brands to look at too if you are comparing apples and oranges. You can do well to look at GTs Avalanche 1.0 @ Performancebike.com and any other brand as well but if the Spec. does it for you then go for it just make sure you are getting a warranty and the dealer will back the bike after the sale too. Seven speed bikes are fast going the way of the dinosaur as most parts have to be ordered as the industry is catering more to the 9 speeds more often and even 8 speed is more or less relegated to the Low end of the industry. You would do well to look at GTs Avalanche and see the difference in Price and quality but I cannot knock Specialized, they make a great product too!|`|dYoYKIFNaa	it is a great bike for beginners. can be easily rode on the streets or the dirt.

IMu3wBu8aa	What's with all of the HBK hating? Everything that person said about HBK is NOT TRUE. I'm sorry, but HBK is better than that. He can still put on 5 Star matches. His last 5 Star match wasn't all those years ago either. Comparing him to Hogan. Is this person joking? Shawn is NOT like Hogan. Shawn doesn't slack off or get pissy either. He doesn't get lazy. He puts everything into EVERY match. I've never heard that HBK and Taker didn't like one another. I actually thought the total opposite. I'm sure they both respect one another and respect each others status in the WWE. Hbk puts younger people over. Also, When Taker won the Rumble, I didn't see a sore loser expression on his face. I saw a proud look on his face. Proud for Taker. If I wasn't one of Shawns biggest fans, I would still argue against this statement. That is not fair to say those things about Shawn. Shawn has been doing so much for the business since day 1. Taker is great and all, but come on...they BOTH still have a lot left in them. They both put on amazing matches on a daily basis. Taker will not be carrying the match...they will both put an equal amount of passion and energy into it. They will both steal the show. They are both Legends because of how talented they BOTH are. They are on the same level and are always talked about in the same sentence. They have nothing to be jealous about one another or anything. I seriously doubt that they "don't like each other". It's fine to be a huge fan of Taker...but at least give Shawn some credit. That man is just as good (in some people's eyes even better). To talk bad about the one and only HBK...it's just wrong.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Those are some extremely strong words about a man who has earned respect.  Shawn Michaels may not be young enough to pull off the whole "Heart Break Kid" name anymore, but he can still get amazing matches.  As far as the whole "5 Star Match" remark, those are actually very rare, and when someone has had as many as Michaels has had in his career, that's very lucky.  Of course Michaels and Jericho's match last year wasn't what it was at WrestleMania 19, because that was 6 years ago, and both men have aged, plus Jericho had been out of the ring for a while.  <br>  As far as Michaels hating to lose at WrestleMania, here's my response to that, who actually likes to lose?  Exactly!  Now, personally, I think Cena vs Michaels is one of the best matches WM has ever had, especially of the Sports-Entertainment Era.  Plus, what's with this person's idea that Michaels and Taker don't like each other?  These two men have been in the same company for an extremely long time, and I'd guess they've developed a good relationship, at least one of common ground and respect, if not friendship.|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	This is utter crapola. Why would you waste your time writing that, it is a joke and so is the person who wrote it. HBK will give his all at WM25, like he does every year. I did not get to see WM live in 2007 so if you have a link where I could watch this so called hissy fit, please send it to me.|`|05RmoBJ6aa	Don't think anyone can deny that Shawn Michaels is no longer the wrestler he was back in his prime but even so he's still better than most of the WWE roster. <br>  <br>  This guy is acting like Undertaker has not yet gone past his prime which is completely untrue. He's suffered injuries so bad I'm surprised he's still wrestling. These two individuals are simply trying to work within the boundaries that have been set for them. So WHAT if HBK hasn't changed his moveset or his gimmick in a billion years. Does he NEED to? <br>  <br>  IMO his moveset right now is perfectly fine and he's such a big name in the business he doesn't need to change his gimmick in order to attract a new fanbase. Shawn Michaels is a given, plain and simple. I'm not gonna comment on the Y2J matches anymore since I haven't seen them. <br>  <br>  Michaels was a prick early in his career but let's face it, the guy's past 40 and a born-again Christian, don't you think a little age and a shift in worldview would change someone just a LITTLE bit? I don't think he will b*tch and moan about winning or losing anymore; I can imagine that instead he'd be honored to be a part in what would probably be the biggest match ever in the history of Wrestlemania. I have faith in the pair of them.|`|EZf00NJJaa	Complete rubbish .<br>  <br>  Obvious it was written by someone with blind hatred for HBK .<br>  <br>  Everytime I think wresting fans cannot be more cynical or stupid , something like this comes along .<br>  <br>  HBK , in my humble opinion , has always been better than Taker .<br>  <br>  It’s no secret that Michaels and Taker don’t like each other."<br>  - Have you met either of them ? Have they personally told you that they hate each other or did you find out on a C grade website ?<br>  <br>  HBK has never changed his gimmick ?<br>  So what , Undertaker has also had the same Dead man thing for a long time .<br>  <br>  Anyway , HBK does not change stuff because  he does not need to , he's already perfect , how can you improve perfection ?<br>  <br>  There was a reason Ric Flair CHOSE HBK for his final match , and not Taker .<br>  <br>  I could rant on this all day about the sheer uselessness and failure of this worthless post , but I have better things to do .<br>  <br>  <br>  And  I think that BOTH HBK and Taker will carry each other to a great match , which taker will win .|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Sounds like a 'Taker Mark to Me...<br>  <br>  HBK has gotten Worse? Ok...<br>  He May Not Be the Showstopper of the Mid '90's Anymore , but He Sure as Hell can Still pull off a Great Match.<br>  <br>  Did He Ever Stop to think HBK was carrying Jericho?<br>  Not Saying He was , but it's a Possibility.<br>  <br>  And HBK Throwing a Fit? Well Duh , He's Always Been that Way.<br>  That is Nothing New.<br>  <br>  It Doesn't Matter if They Don't Like Each Other , They're both Professionals & Will Put on the Best Possible WM match They Can. With HBK Losing Obviously. I Doubt with Shawn's 6-9 WM Record , He Cares about Winning or Losing Anymore...|`|YcpIfEW7aa	I don't know about Taker and HBK not liking one another, but I do know that both of them can get the best out of their opponents no matter how seemingly unskilled or limited they are.  In short, I disagree with the statements about HBK.  It will be interesting how the two of them will get the best out of one another this time since it happened a decade before.  This match at Wrestlemania will be awesome.|`|QbY18bjkaa	idk strong words or remarks<br>  <br>  Taker vs hbk i really hope he don't pull a hogan match with this<br>  I understand why he would catch a fit with cena, Wm 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 were great from shawn i give these 5 stars and many people as well.|`|GQWGLSexaa	i'm speechless and that person did made a good point|`|QF8rrDIcaa	I'm going to be honest and straight up, this will be the biggest match of both of their careers, hands down. Keep in mind that they did have phenomenal, classic matches that we will never forget. Also keep in mind their classic match in the cell and their last match they had together at Royal Rumble 98'. We all know that these two have accomplished many things and are now established as legends and future inductees of the Hall of Fame.<br>  <br>  Now to be more detailed on why I think so is because for one, this is a WrestleMania match. Both just happen to be the biggest names in WrestleMania and also happen to be the man with the streak and the man who is known for some of the controversial events in the WWE. This is both of their defining moments as legends and their "finishing touch" (don't think I mean their retiring because that's not what I'm saying). With these two working together probably one last time, we're guaranteed to have a match that will come down in history and never to be forgotten, no matter who wins or loses.<br>  <br>  But at all it is scripted HBK may win, But both are great|`|Wf8PbTraaa	lol whoever typed that is an idiot.<br>  <br>  HBK isn't what he was back in 1996 or 1997 but hes still one of the best. and to say he hasn't had a good match since WM19 is just idiotic. did that person watch WMXX or 21 with kurt angle or 23 when he pulled that bum cena to a great match or how bout last year when he made a 59 year old ric flair look great again.<br>  <br>  thats only WM matches i named.<br>  <br>  and no hes not gonna be lazy cuz he doesn't wanna lose to taker.....HES THE ONE WHO PITCHED THE IDEA TO CREATIVE A FEW MONTHS BACK.<br>  <br>  and why would he have a fit about losing to cena. 1--> cena is hhh's boy. hhh and hbk are best friends and 2---> HBK doesn't wanna be champ. he barely wrestles a full schedule and if he did wanna be champ he would be. why? cuz hes HBK.<br>  <br>  as far as HBK and Taker not liking each other. they've never been friends but they've always respected each other and they've never been enemies.<br>  <br>  btw for the record i think HBK/Undertaker should be the main event/closing match.
6LQNK51uaa	I ll start with beginning<br>  <br>  ---Ric Flair vs Sting from WCW days that was amazing from these two<br>  ---Undertaker vs Kane..the inferno match<br>  ---HBK vs Bret Hart..Iron man match<br>  ---HBK vs Angle<br>  ---Taker vs Triple H<br>  ---and the best of all time Austin vs Bret Hart..Pure Classic<br>  <br>  So u see these matches r the one which was not one sided or we can say  carried by one wrestler..these wrestlers look good in their match(both of them)...I can remember the Austin vs Hart match..they were trying to surpass other one but unable to do that b/c they both were great in that match.<br>  <br>  HBK vs Angle and even Taker vs Triple H(I can remember the HolySh*t chant during that match)were as good as that match.<br>  <br>  WQ--->No doubt that we r going to see a great match from these great stars....they can make anyone look better than how come they cannot compliment each other in that match.|`|EZf00NJJaa	Kurt Angle V HBK - WM<br>  Pretty Amazing Match .<br>  <br>  Also , Austin - Hart - WM .<br>  <br>  WQ2 : Do u think Taker vs HBK at WM 25 will be a match that u can feel their passions n spirits? Why or why not ?<br>  <br>  Impossible to say until i actually see it , but it is very likely .<br>  <br>  Whenever  HBK is in a match , i do get personally invested in it and start rooting for him , "marking" if you will .<br>  <br>  I KNOW HBK won't end the streak .<br>  <br>  But for those 15 minutes , i will suspend my beliefs and actually enjoy the match , instead of being a cynical smark who has already trashed the match without even seeing it .<br>  <br>  This will be one of the last Big HBK matches , and this is the last time we will see HBK & Taker at it , i think . So , hopefully , it will be a match that will be remembered and make me proud to be a fan .|`|e3m3rdNYaa	WM12, Bret Hart vs. Shawn Michaels<br>  <br>  WM24, Michaels vs. Flair<br>  <br>  WQ2: I think so, Shawn Michaels is one of those guys that wears his passion of his sleeves, His Wrestlemania Matches especially. The Undertaker does not. Something has got to give. I think you will see alot of passion and spirit from Shawn, but not much from Taker.|`|iCER7SYDaa	Ric Flair and HBK<br>  That match was awesome<br>  Andre and Hulk<br>  Another<br>  Chris,HHH, and HBK<br>  Also<br>  And coming soon <br>  HBK and Undertaker|`|b7JS16dyaa	I think you could tell that Jericho and HBK enjoyed working their recent feud, and the match with Eddie and JBL where Eddie got busted wide open but kept fighting made you really connect with him. There's also tons from years ago, but I can't recall much because I liked too many.<br>  <br>  WQ2: Yep, because they're in their home state, and they both know that it could be the final time they compete together in a huge match-up. These two legends always shine at Wrestlemania, but together, they'll blow the roof off the building (if it has one). I can't wait.|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	HBK v Jericho WM19, Steamboat v Macho Man WM3, Stone Cold v Rock WM19. There are a few others, but these are my three top picks. Took awhile to work out.<br>  <br>  WQ2: Yes. We have been waiting for this match for awhile. I really think that it is up in the air as to who will win. They could go either way with this match, unless it is a retirement match, then I think HBK will lose and have to retire. Taker just signed a new 3 year contract, so he will NOT retire until then.|`|t0b37xZMaa	I go back to HBK vs. Ric Flair at WM24 to answer the first question. That match did make me feel the passion and spirit.<br>  <br>  Maybe HBK's passion this year, but not 'Taker's. HBK is going to hit SCM a couple of times and still not be able to put him down for the three count.|`|1JywgkyMaa	eddie guerrero vs jbL at judgement day,because even though eddie was bleeding extremely badly,he still had that latino heat goin on|`|HZvoDlXeaa	sabu vs ray mysysterio at 1 night stand <br>  and yh this hbk vs undertaker wil have lots of spirit and passion|`|qqLcvDDKaa	This match right here from IWA.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygwaBoOXatw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygwaBoOXa...</a>|`|CiHh3Qvfaa	I'd have to say<br>  Bret Hart vs Owen Hart<br>  i cant remember when and where it was but it was a long time ago|`|hvBeLr6Oaa	how about i let you know seeing as i'm going!!!!|`|PsWWkwrraa	Answer # 1- The Iron Man match between Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart. Also (I know it says one match) Shawn Michaels vs Ric Flair at Wrestlemania 24.<br>  <br>  Answer # 2- I think it would because Michaels is one of few superstars who shows his emotions at the end of the match whether he wins or loses. Plus there could be a chance of the streak ending. So I would believe Undertaker will have a lot of emotion as well. The fans are going to on their feet the entire match and I have a feeling that those two will end up shaking hands at the end.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	Bret vs Shawn Iron Man Match.<br>  <br>  WQ2: Yes. They are Legends and know everything there is to know about the business, wrestling, and how to put on a great match. They both have sooo much passion. When someone wants to see a match with passion and spirit...HBK and Taker are the first to come to mind for most people.|`|8t1Osybyaa	hbk vs taker<br>  <br>  WQ. i think so these 2 may have faced off many of times but this 1 should top it at wrestlemania it should be the main event {like actually last match to close wm}

UoT86gbiaa	That's a solid team.  I'm not a big Peralta or Beltre fan, but considering what you have around them, they should be fine.  <br>  Your one weakness is that you have no steals.  You could consider dropping LaRoche for someone who can run; Juan Pierre is available in your league, so you can get some swipes without killing your average.  Otherwise you're looking at making a trade, possibly for an OF (think in the Matt Kemp/Shane Victorino range) or a downgrade at 2B.|`|L4k0Rf9Daa	thats a pretty solid team, not a whole lot u could do to make it better, u might want to get someone better than johnny peralta at SS, but thats about it

pqSGMukvaa	Ii would get a Habitat over a Foundation...<br>  but over any of those i would get a Zero, or a Plan B<br>  <br>  Get Risers if u are getting lo trucks...they prevent wheel bite (the wheels rubbing against the board). They also will lessen the stress of the trucks against the board...so i would recommend them, but they arent totally necessary|`|d5ywPNYqaa	You don't need riser pads.  Don't worry about them.  They absorb the shock a tiny bit, so your board might last a tiny bit longer.  You can't go wrong with either a Foundation or Habitat deck.  They are both good boards.  I would go with Foundation though.  I love Corey Duffel and Sierra Fellers.|`|T57f4WpFaa	No dont use riser pads, unless you skate vert. In street skating you need small wheels and you board must be low on the ground. Riser pabs lift your board and they give you pressure cracks.<br>  <br>  and foundations arent bad. good skaters like Corey Duffel skates foundations and leo romero used to ride for them!<br>  but i would go for a baker!|`|wOw7HZlQaa	you cant go wrong with foundation or habitat<br>  risers arent really necessary unless your rockin like 58mm wheels<br>  small ones arent too bad but i wouldnt get them at all, you most likely dont need them unless your skating tranny|`|leTVY95Aaa	Dont get any of those. get an almost, baker or chocolate. i dont think you need to get risers. risers prevent wheelbite.|`|A07TqVdiaa	no main<br>  get a Real<br>  there boss=]

aa9gieAIaa	its just not very complicated all in all, the electric system is very simple and is non programmable as far as i know, but has burst and auto modes. it uses the standard spyder firing system with a two piece delrin bolt and a cheap drop system. i like the pilot but it has issues the biggest of which is the cocking pin popping out. if you can deal with that issue its ok all in all but not much performance out of the box. i had to mod mine a lot to get it the way i like it. you will need a force feed system of some kind too as the anti chop bolt kinda stinks. if you want good performance right out of the box with no force feed hopper its probably not for you.|`|3UBE0sAnaa	<a href="http://getinthis.pa-extra.com" rel="nofollow">http://getinthis.pa-extra.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.

Xi6KuhcFaa	Oh, I finally caught on. You ask the question once in the Martial Arts line and once in the Boxing line. Now I got it? My mistake.<br>  <br>  I'd say that the nose is good, but I know that men are generally most protecitve of two main areas: their face and their balls. Sheer instinct and reflex alone allows them to fend off most attacks to these two areas.<br>  <br>  So, you have to set up your strikes to be able to land a good one against the average opponent. You just shoot straight for the nose in a known confrontation and either your opponent will block or lean away most of the time. (A sucker punch is a different story, but we won't get into that here).<br>  <br>  For instance, you double-jab punch to the head to get the opponent to raise his guard, opeing him up to a good hard cross to the  solar plexus. From there, he's open for an uppercut or another cross to the nose or a hook to the side of his now bent-over head. <br>  <br>  You got me? You see what I'm saying?<br>  <br>  A nose strike is good for making the opponent's eye to water, which gives you all kinds of advantage for the next ten seconds or so.<br>  <br>  A solar plexus strike is good for taking his breath away for a short time, which again gives you some opportunity for a about 5 seconds. He's tense and all tight to protect his gut for that short time it takes him to relax again (prine time for hook or cross, baby!).<br>  <br>  The chin is the traditional KO point, but it is just so hard to hit. You have to aim at his mouth and watch his reaction: if he moves back, you may still hit his chin; if he leans forward or drops, you may still hit his nose. This is another area that you set up by hitting other areas first.<br>  <br>  The jaw (masseter) is another KO point.<br>  <br>  The eyes are targeted for reducing vision. If you turn you fist AFTER making impact, you're more likely to cut him around the eye, bringing blood. Either he'll go blind for a few seonds before the ref takes a look at it, or they'll call the fight for the damage. Chances are, you'll a few rounds to make that thing open up even more.<br>  <br>  The temple is another good one for KOs. With the big gloves on, you at least make the guy dizzy as you hit there, giving you a few seconds to wail on him before he regains his bearings.<br>  <br>  The ear is an often-overlooked target, but it works even in the boxinf ring. You hit a guy there and he's hurting more than he would with a punch to the jaw or temple. He's disoriented and deafened for a few seconds, time enough for you to go for some body-blows before comine back up for a straight cross.<br>  <br>  Another often-overlooked target is the belt-line. Get as close to that belt-line as you can with a downward-angled punch. This irritates his bladder and makes him not want to take water between rounds. Everything that is offered will be spit out, since he can't exactly go running to the bathroom. (Hee-hee!) Your opponent starts to dehydrate and tire quicker, which is helpful in those 10 round matches. <br>  <br>  Another good strike is aoutside hook to the area just UNDER his ribs. coming from the side at a slightly rearward angle. That let's you injure the kidneys without being immediately called for rabbit punches. That's another way to affect your opponent's speed and fluid intake.|`|FvtBS9cpaa	forget the crap from the previous answers. You are in a fight. You cannot talk your way out of it or run away. (no shame in that it's a valid option). ask him a question (eg. whats the problem mate?) when he begins to answer,(and therefore he's off guard)  hit him hard as you can with a straight right or left if you're left handed, (tight fist thumb tucked under, from the shoulder as hard as you can) in the throat/adams apple/voice box. From there on he's toast. If you're too short or lack the confidence to attempt that, a swift kick to the balls will double him over (don't look at his balls and warn him, and don't forget the question to distract him) and then a roundhouse punch to either the temple or just below the ear where the jaw joint is. (large nerve clusters there which will render him unconscious if done right).But remember - whatever you choose to do, do it fully committed with all the force you have.Assume it's a fight to the death and you are willing to go all the way to save your life.fight to win.You don't know what you opponent will do to you. (by the way a bloody nose or watering eyes means f--ck all in a fight. Adrenalin will stop any pain during a fight. Being hit only hurts later, never during.) You're best reaction is always to get out of the fight if possible.Always.|`|NnsizqH2aa	Arenas-L seems to have given a nice list and good reasons. Obviously, no one-punch answer is realistic, since every good strike follows a set-up. So, I will just counter some of the other answers provided here, most of which are simply ignorant.<br>  <br>  First off, if you are the young Boxer I read about recently, then you know that the human head is one of the most elusive targets to be found, and that specific smaller targets on it can be quite hard to hit. That said, you know that an uppercut to the nose is sheer idiocy.<br>  <br>  No doubt, the person making the suggestion thinks that the nasal cartilage can be shoved up into brain, one of the great myths of the martial arts. Any anatomy book can disprove this, showing that the human brain is encased in a bowl of bone that prevents the gelatinous brain and its liquid surroundings from following gravity out of all the external holes the sensory organs are found in. That bowl has only tight cracks that are only large enough for nerves and smaller vessels to enter, and the soft hyaline cartilage cannot penetrate it (even if it could, that two inch thing would not reach the brain, since the eyes themselves are about that size in diameter and do not reach past that bone bowl [as there are also muscles behind the eye that require space to contract and expand], much less to the brain). So, simply ignore that idiocy.<br>  <br>  Next, is the idea that striking someone in the forehead will make them dizzy. You know this to be untrue. A strike to the forehead can be irritating, but one quickly gets used to it in Boxing. In fact, some in-fighters intentionally duck their heads toward a punch to let that thick frontal bone take blows, weaken the opponent's wrist and set quickly follow diverted strike with one of your own just inside of his defensive line. So, although this might surprise someone in the streets, it will serve to do little more than help create an opening against a real fighter.<br>  <br>  Next, let's talk about this notion of striking the throat, another blow that requires precision timing and set-up against a moving opponent that will likely drop his chin. You have to use set-ups similar to those used for the uppercut to the chin. <br>  <br>  Even if you set-up the opponent by hitting his forehead backward or turning the head with a hook, the throat would still be very difficult to hit wearing gloves. Instead, you would be better to strike the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle that travels from the front of the neck toward the back of the ear. This can be hit with the same hooking motion that one uses to strike the masseter (rear of the jaw), and will actually look like the same attack, if done correctly. In this way, you would cause swelling that would reduce the opponent's ease of breathing and swallowing.<br>  <br>  Now, let's talk about the street-work, since you are a boxer, and we have been known to have trouble with the law for defending ourselves. Known sport fighters and martial artists are often held to a higher standard by an unrealistic public that thinks we can magically defeat opponents without seriously hurting them. You must avoid any assault or counter that appears to be intentionally aggressive or vicious, or the police will be at your door soon after.<br>  <br>  As a police officer, one of the first things I had to learn was not to clench my fist in fighting. This habit causes us to tighten our hands in stress, a bad tendency when holding a gun. In addition, the clenching of the fist before an altercation is legally considered a threat gesture, so officers must avoid this just as much as they should avoid constantly grabbing their weapons or flashing their batons.<br>  <br>  It would be wise to develop some open-hand responses for the streets. Your Boxing moves will flow nicely into just about any other martial art you might choose to learn later, but you must learn to open those hands if you are to quickly grab a man or disarm him or such.<br>  <br>  That's all I'm going to say for now. As I said, Arenas-L answered the issue nicely. I just wanted to make sure things were in proper perspective for what you might be seeking.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  .|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	uppercut to the nose|`|vLD8L1P0aa	your example was a good spot: a jab to the nose. and yes the nose is probably the best spot because there eyes go watery and then they cant see properly. A cross to the forehead or a left hook in the temple will make them dizzy.

DOVbF4Piaa	You want to practice for long distances.  You want to pedal at a high cadence 70-90 rpm's with a lite pressure on the pedals.  That will save your legs from getting tired and will allow you go  farther.  You want to ride as much as you can and take a day off to recover if you need to.

He is going to ruin Edwards' confidence for the future because you know he is going to demand the ball.  If I were them I would've gotten something elsewhere, either in the draft or free agency.  But as a Pats fan, very excited to see him in our division.  You have a lot of other weaknesses to work on and one player is not going to get you to the playoffs, especially not T.O. who didn't get Dallas to the playoffs ONCE.|`|xTPploEcaa	I agree with you, it's one year.

mqgS6Dfxaa	The Indians will be solid in the bullpen this year.  Hopefully Kerry Wood can stay healthy.  That will allow Rafael Bettencourt, and Jenson Lewis to take care of the 7th and 8th innings.  RHP Smith and LHP Rafeal Perez will most likely be the specialists.  Righthanders batted .192 against Smith in 2008 vs .320 by lefties.<br>  <br>  Shin-Soo Choo struggled the first half of 2008 but his second half was awesome, 11 HR, 48 RBI and a .343 batting average.  Unfortunately Francisco was the opposite in 2008 batting .294 in the first half and .236 in the second.|`|HGAsVI77aa	Time for some major rebuillding for the indians. Who is going to step it up for cleveland? That answer is Travis Hafner. Ya he has already shown he is great but who else can un bury the treasure for this team other than a powerful leader coming off the disabled list. Ben Fransisco is a great player as well and i believe he will have a fairly good year. For Shin-Soo Choo, he is going to the dumpster. Choo has put up okay numbers but not the kind you want to keep your ball club from entering the baltimore or seattle type playing. I believe Cleveland has more in them to keep on fighting but dont look for a playoff year. As for Joe Smith, he will not make the set up role because Betancourt is going to get another chance as he has put up great nubers early last season but struggeled later.|`|XPFhS1EDaa	They're gonna let Smith, Betancourt, and Jensen Lewis compete for the setup role.

JAts9B5laa	Yea I thought the same thing happened when they played earlier in the week in that game LeBron blatantly fouled Chalmers while he was calling a timeout and then Chalmers chucked up a shot but no foul or timeout was called in this game they were fouling a lot on the inside but no fouls were called where as on the other end of the court they would call a foul I think the refs are a bit biased towards the Cavs and it gives them momentum to win games not taking away from all there wins but when they played Miami Monday the refs gave the Cavs the momentum they needed to win the game.|`|wGO7thhwaa	i dont understand why people blamed the refs for everything.<br>  the cavaliers won the game, and i dont know what you think you can do to change that, but okay, we'll say the refs gave the cavs the game.<br>  <br>  wade got no calls whatsoever, but still went to the line 5 times.<br>  <br>  why do you have to make excuses for a 25 pt night.<br>  he had a great night. 25 pts, 12 assists.<br>  you cant possibly expect him to be putting up 40 a night every day do you?<br>  be realistic<br>  <br>  EDIT:the answerer below me proves my point that heat fans arent used to success.<br>  i dont know if thats english|`|PdIhUGh5aa	for real, cleveland gets a lot of calls they should not be getting|`|c3ce9f916abdade63289dc55a62d405caa	your mom got no calls|`|SJBp2HEwaa	oh yeah!  they helped the cavs the whole game, there was only about 2-3 missed calls on both sides|`|vzYJJCdqaa	ur soo mean|`|HiuNSScLaa	they fn blew it stupid a** refs gave cavs momentum and mo williams not gay a** lebron i am now officially tired of im ripping my poster of him off putting a kobe one up wade kobe my new fav players kobe 2nd wade 1st(and mvp) when wade got the T i was like "you go boy tell them b****** off f them" then spoelstra oh man you should have seen me you would have been like holy s*** i was like yah thats right tell em i was screaming somebody outside yelled stfu i was like u b**** i was pissed but happy that they argued it great job refs of and (sarcastically) "great game lebron that was a great triple double" yah fn right worst triple double ever especially by an "mvp" or "best player"

q9D1mCJnaa	thats a rather personel ?|`|SJEXY7Ufaa	probably not|`|L0NG5I9eaa	He has the ability to do it. The big question with him was whether the fans would accept him because he is not Brett Favre. He did manage to get on the fans good side last year thanks to Favre's tough year in New York. <br>  <br>  Last Year the Packers were hurt by their defense's lack of aggression and problem with giving up big plays. Once that is taken care of Rodgers can take the Pack to a Super Bowl. He has good receivers and a good running back, so he should be able to make it to the Super Bowl.|`|1fd334de2dd363f2c3802ce3b9b7466aaa	I agree with Kev-O. I'm a Wisconsin gal, so I've been loyal to the packers my whole life. So when Brett finally left, it seemed like no one could do better than him. However, Aaron Rodgers is pretty damn good for just starting out like that, he never really did have much play time when Brett was there. So, maybe not next season, or even the season after that, but I think Aaron Rodgers could very well make it to the superbowl one of these years. (if freaking thompson doesn't do any other dumbass moves)|`|BlgZmV6uaa	He had a good year as a starter!Now with the pressure off I think you will see a more relaxed player.The defense has to pick it up at least 2 notches.He put them in position to win a lot of games only to have the defense give the game away.Superbowl is a stretch but hey who can tell.Trent Dilfer & Brad Johnson got there and won.|`|msxGICJvaa	maybe IF they improve the packs D line and O line|`|72b1b35e81e7d39e237e18972e90ad30aa	im sure he can buy a ticket....|`|20zLmf3Laa	Yeah, he's a good enough quarterback to get the Packers to the promise land, but the question is the team around him good enough to get there? The Packers have changed there defensive philosophy to a 3-4 and frankly, they don't have the right players in their front 7 to have immediate success. The Packers also have to address their offensive tackle position as Tausher is coming off of a serious knee injury and Clifton may only have one maybe two, more years of football in him.|`|k1miPoECaa	I think so, I have the faith in him and I know he isn't getting any younger but I consider last season as a practice season. I know other fans have a different opinion though. I'm just glad the Pack didnt grab T.O. while they could.|`|jTKxLFuWaa	Possibly, people overlook him since he replaced Brett Favre.

LtIhkOWiaa	No dudes, just no.<br>  <br>  First off, don't bother with abec 7s for your first set of bearings unless they are dirt cheap.<br>  <br>  Abec ratings are a very rough guide. So it goes, the higher the abec rating, the more precise the construction.<br>  A low abec rating means it won't roll as smooth, but will withstand a lot of punishment.<br>  A high abec rating means that they will roll smooth, but will be weaker.<br>  <br>  Like I said though, this is a very rough guide.<br>  <br>  As for Bones Reds, a lot of people rate them, and that's cool, but you have to understand they are a very "love them or hate them" bearing. I personally can't stand them, I had two sets that froze up and popped very quickly.<br>  <br>  If you can, try and find a friend or local skateboarder with Bones Reds who can let you have a roll around on their board for a minute or two, then you can make your own mind up.<br>  <br>  It may be attractive to buy Bones Swiss too, as they are very highly rated, but are very expensive. You do not need this sort of quality when you are just starting, so save your money.<br>  <br>  If you can find them, go with NMB bearings. They are as cheap as they come and will last you a decent amount of time.<br>  If you can't, try to get bearings that are affordable but from a reputable skate company.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|o0yUd22Laa	I use reds bearings.

apMjpmogaa	Find a patient friend who is willing to help you learn. <br>  Start somewhere shallow and focus on floating. If you take a deep breath and then curl yourself into a ball and lay perfectly still in the water without releasing your breath, you won't sink. Trust me. I have about 2% body fat and if I have enough air in my lungs I don't sink when I do this. Next, notice that if you lay flat you will very, very slowly sink. You are half way to swimming already when you realize how much you float without even trying. Next, as you lay flat in the water, kick your legs in a steady rythm back and forth. There should be minimal bending at the knees-most of the movement is in the hips. This will push you through the water, and if you position your upper body the right way (either on your front or back), it will actually keep you from sinking. The difficulties with this are that <br>  1. If you are on your back, you can't see where you are going very well<br>  2. If you are on your front, you can't see without goggles and you have to hold your breath.<br>  3. Your legs will eventually get tired.<br>  So next you do the kicking and add in CONTROLLED arm/hand motions. The easiest is a churning "doggy paddle" motion under your chin. It will feel like you are clawing your way through the water, or kind of like an old paddle wheel boat. This will keep your face out of the water so you can breath and see where you are going. This stroke will be enough to get you some distance in an emergency, but it is very inefficient and will wear you out if you do it for any length of time.<br>  So next, do the same kick but change your arm motions. Instead of small, quick paddles under your chin or chest, reach one arm way out in front of you and then pull back toward your body, bending your elbow to 90 degrees as your hand passes under your body. Keep pushing water with that hand until your arm is once again extended straight out, and then bring it out of the water and rotate it out in front of you again. The other arm will be doing the same movement, but offset by half a rotation. I assume you have watched the olympics, so you know more or less how the front crawl (or "freestyle") works. At first you will have to hold your breath while you do this, but once you get the hang of it you will find that your body actually rolls a lot from side to side as you swim. This will allow you to get a breath very easily by simply turning your head as you reach a hand out in front of you.<br>  Again, it will help you a lot to find a good friend who knows how to swim and who will patiently help you through this, but you can probably figure it out okay on your own as well.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	to begin, the best exercise is to stay at the edge holding the side of the pool deck, extend your feet and start to kick until you get the hang of it.  start w/ the flutter kick used in both freestyle and backstroke.  then using the deck edge again, do the freestyle stroke w/ your face in the water and every other stroke, that is the same side each ime, turn your head for breath. until you'r comfortable.  then try them together in a shallow area of the pool til you get the hang of it.  all of this supposes you don't want to take a class for some reason...|`|wncdhUxDaa	I definitely think you should do a class.<br>  Trying to teach yourself can be extremely dangerous and the lessons cost isn't that much considering its a skill you'll need and use for the rest of your life.<br>  Good luck!|`|5GPDrBPLaa	You should take a class.  Usually you can find classes through the city at good prices.|`|7MgKT6hvaa	Take a class.  Chances are everything is in your mind and you can actually swim once you relax in the water.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	YMCA in the U.S. or call a public pool. Try to get some formal training because they will tell you how to keep yourself afloat in water. I'm a trained swimmer, but out of practise. I have a small fishing boat, and have to be careful when people come out with me. If they fall over and it has happened, not only do I get wet but it is a workout because they thrash all around with what is called the "drowning reaction". If someone doesn't know how to swim I don't take them in saltwater.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	If there is a YMCA or the like that has a swimming class that is called 'Terribly Terrified swimming class, they are trained to take care  of those phobic reactions.  <br>  I took that course back in '91 and did learn to swim in the shallow end, but when I approached the deep end I could still feel myself freezing in terror. The instructor came along with me, and encouraged me to take a deep breath and allow myself to sink deep into the water, keeping my legs at the ready to push myself back to the surface.  After doing that for about 10 minutes she encouraged me to swim right to the bottom, 3 meters deep, turn and come back up.<br>  <br>  Odd as it may seem, once I had done that, I found myself able to swim across the deep end without any terror. I could swim to the bottom in comfort. And, within a month I was swimming 2 km at a time.<br>  <br>  Just learning how to roll over and stop facing up was a major step, but every maneuver that one learns is important to build the confidence needed to enjoy swimming. So do take a course where the instructor is sympathetic to the  terror you feel.

Croyle could get realeased or be the 3rd stringer, wont matter because his opportunity to have any shot a a real role with the team got dashed once the trade was announced. As for their 1st round (3rd pick overall), if the Lions pass on Curry (no sure thing, their defense was horrendous and they hired a defense first coach) then they tab Curry without a doubt. If that doesnt pan out the pick could be Everette Brown or whichever LT is left between Smith and Monroe and move Albert or the pick to RT (McIntosh is not the answer over there).|`|ubGNtkHQaa	It will obviously be Cassel, they traded for him for a reason.<br>  They will trade him or cut him.<br>  Aaron Curry|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	1. Uh...Matt Cassel's contract is for like $14 Million...He's the starter...*L*...For a year, anyway...<br>  <br>  2. Croyle will be the backup...to Tyler Thigpen...i.e. #3 on the depth chart...<br>  <br>  3. They need to draft OL's FIRST AND FOREMOST, if they plan on keeping Cassel from getting injured...Jason Smith, OT out of Baylor has been mentioned...|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	Cassel will be the starter.  Haley did say there will be competetion for the spot, but they aren't going to pay Cassel $14 mil to sit on the bench.  The job is Cassel's to lose - not Thigpen's to win.  The only way Thigpen wins the job is if Cassel gets injured or Cassel plays so horribly that they can't let him start.<br>  <br>  They'll try to trade Croyle, and will proabably be happy to get a conditional 6th round pick for him.  If they can't trade him he'll be released after this season.<br>  <br>  Depends on who's available.  If Curry is still on the board then I think he's the choice.  If he's gone then Jason Smith or Eugene Monroe is the pick.  B.J. Raji is another possiblity but I think it's a really slim chance they select him.|`|xxtvhn5Naa	1. Matt Cassel: They traded for him so he could start.<br>  2. Thy will probably release him, he doesn't have much trading value anyway.<br>  3. I think they will draft either Aaron Curry, the LB out of Wake Forest, or Jason Smith the OT out of Baylor.|`|69bb96acaa	The next person who says Aaron Curry will be a chief I will smack them silly he is a Cleveland Brown don't you get it God get it through your heads we would make a trade if we thought he was in any danger Chiefs need someone to catch the ball dude|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	1. Matt Cassel<br>  2. Brodie Croyle will get traded to the Lions prolly <br>  3.  I think WR Michael Crabtree will be their first round pick and they will have   big time wr's in Dwane Bowe and Crabtree !!|`|ZEEOVPwQaa	Matt Cassel will probably get the starting job. since he has spent his whole life sitting on the bench he should work harder than ever. and since they have got a qb they need help on defense. the best solution would be Aaron Curry from Wake Forest. He is a great linebacker who should help with sacks since kansas had only 10 last year and he also won the Butkis Award.|`|q9D1mCJnaa	They are going to trade cassel because he won't sign a long term deal to Denver get their 1st round pick for NE 2nd Denver needs to stop cutlers whining<br>  they get cutler sign  Charlie Batch as a back up<br>  Trade thigpen for a 2nd and 5 th round pick and they get a WR and rebuild their D in the Draft<br>  <br>  Cutler starts|`|xYRl0KABaa	I was schocked when they got Cassel. I think Cassel is a better QB but I really like Thigpen. He has like the ultimate underdog story. I think the Chiefs need to upgrade their defense in this draft. They also need a fresh RB.|`|gBfPkdroaa	im thinking cassel.<br>  i mean 2-14 explaisn a lot.<br>  and so does 11-5 but than again, cassel worked with a "system" so yea.<br>  <br>  1st rounder im thinking KC will take aaron curry.|`|2Tm6xCHEaa	1. Matt Cassel becuz they arn't keeping a 14 mil guy on the bench.<br>  <br>  2. He'll compete for the 3rd Qb spot<br>  <br>  3. Pass Rusher. NFL record for least sacks.|`|i2NFartOaa	It will obviously be Cassel, they traded for him for a reason.<br>  They will trade him or cut him.<br>  Aaron Curry he beast they need prove there denfese and and they just prove there offense there playoff bound in next year they have another draft choice|`|jXgKtDe0aa	They will start Matt Cassel because he is beter then the rest of there QB's.|`|O1tiemu0aa	obviously Cassel they would not have traded for him with a 2nd round pick if he wasnt gonna play

You have to have a quick first step and a good crossover to get into the lane.

X9txA1GVaa	if you're regular, put weight on your front foot, and start putting your toe down on your left foot, and then about a second later, put your toes down on your right foot. it's basically the exact opposite of heel-side. like on heel side, you do the same thing but you lift your toes and put the weight on your heel. toe-side just lifts your heel and puts weight on your toes. to get back to riding straight or going heel-side again, try to throw your weight a little (don't jump) and just act like you're going heel-side and it'll bring you back that way. just try at first to do it very simple- left toes down. right toes down. you will turn.|`|AA11691546	I remember while I was learning, I wanted to "jump" from toe side to heel side and vice versa.  The best advice is to concentrate on conecting your turns or "carve".  Put more weight on your front foot and lead with your head. Wherever your lead shoulder is pointing, that's where you're gonna go.  <br>  Just remember, if you feel out of control, don't lean back.  You'll only go faster.<br>  Practice, practice, practice....

What jerk came up with the term assault rifle?<br>  A.

The military uses fully automatic rifles because they know semi automatic is not a very good assault rifle.<br>  A. Actually the military uses assault rifles which fire 3 round burst/full automatic because they want a high rate of fire with something that is controllable (though even there that's debatable since all fully automatic weapons suffer from muzzle climb). The burst/full auto capacity is there so soldiers can lay down a high volume of fire in the advent of an ambush or if they need suppressing fire, however if you want accurate shooting you almost have to switch to semi-automatic.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	actually, one of the most evil people ever did, adolf hitler, when the Sturmgewehr 44 was shown to him, he named it this, which means assault or attack weapon 44 and the name stuck to all weapons that fit into this category, weapons that are the size and range of a rifle, but have the ability to switch from semi auto to full auto fire, some semi auto weapons are still considered assault weapons like the HK G3 and the SKS, but this is wrong.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Actually any Rifle could be considered an Assault Rifle when used to Assault another person or persons.* That means that any Sporting Rifle used for Hunting Game, or any Rifle for that matter could qualify as an Assault Rifle.* In reality there is no such thing as a Separate or Distinct Rifle that qualifies as an Assault Rifle, they all could for that Reason.* It is False and Inaccurate to Describe only a Specific Rifle as an Assault Rifle.* That could mean that all Rifles could be considered Assault Rifles and Banned by the Government in America.* Is that Scary or What?*...|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	The term has been around since WW2 since the Germans created the first selective fire weapon the STG44.

The original Sturmgewehr fired the 8x33 cartridge.<br>  <br>  Of course for those that want to ban guns, they will start by demonizing a class, ban that class and go from there. The large mag bans by the Clinton bunch were an example of that form of stupidity.<br>  <br>  The Assault Rifle of the Democrats has little to do with the real thing, aside from being chambered for the same weak cartridges.

I don't really know if your coach will put you on the team or not but if you don't make it just keep working on it if this is really what you want than go for it.  It will be tough but it will get easier down the road.  I think that you can make the team if you really want it most coaches look for people who are good but also most importantly the people who actually want to learn and get better who actually love the sport so go for....<br>  <br>  good luck i hope you make it....|`|gf0MUkgEaa	garbage lol. 7pts u suck. i an 8th grader and i play high school ball and i average more than you. and on my middle skool team i average 20pts|`|lAPC6bGbaa	If the school is above 3A then its iffy, but if its 3A or under than I think you've made it, unless you do bad at the try-outs.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, I don't know how good you are, but based on the fact that you were on the middle school team and started half the games, you should make the freshman team, if you have one.

jSkHquK5aa	Soccer is one of the most popular sports in the world. All the positions are pivotal to the game, however none more so than the goalie. This position tends to the net and aims to prevent the other team from scoring. It's also one of the most difficult positions to play, because the goalie is the lone defender at the net. Read on to learn more.<br>  <br>  Step 1<br>  Find an empty field for practice. Stretch your hamstrings, shoulders and chest before and after you begin practicing. <br>  <br>  Step 2<br>  Have a friend kick the soccer ball at you while you try to defend the goal, or area you have designated as the goal. <br>  <br>  Step 3<br>  Defend against high balls by using both hands to make a "W" with the thumbs together. Use your palms to control the ball as you catch and bring it into your chest. <br>  <br>  Step 4<br>  Block medium high balls with a basket you form with your hands using the little fingers to form an inverted "W." Cradle the ball as you catch it and bring it into your stomach. <br>  <br>  Step 5<br>  Counter low balls with a maneuver which requires you to drop to your knee and keep your body behind the ball as you catch it. <br>  <br>  Step 6<br>  Dive to protect the goal. Keep your hands in the "W" shape. This will provide a backstop for the ball. Push the ball downward to anchor it to the ground. <br>  <br>  Step 7<br>  Join a community league. A pickup game starts, ask the group if you can play goalie. Play with friends as often as possible to practice your skills and be ready for a real match.|`|YbOGOnroaa	You know what. You should do some fitness drills by yourself and also, you can try practicing your technique by yourself.<br>  <br>  Another thing that I did to improve my game is by watching more footie on tv. Normally when I watch football on the television, I always overlook what the goalie does and just concentrate on the football my team plays. But now, I analyse everything the keeper does from how he catches the ball, his footing, decision making and how he blocks the ball.<br>  <br>  Here are a few websites I have found to be extremely useful!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|YT1vOwq6aa	Heres a training practice session thing:<br>  Go and get an American football, rugby ball, or any other oddly shaped ball that bounces very awkwardly. Now get a friend to throw the ball at the floor, it should start bouncing in weird ways, now try to grab the ball when its all over the place. This helps with reflexes and reaction times.

Cl6KbcAGaa	SR suntour forks are entry level forks and not all that bad for a "1st" fork overall but if you have the money and the need then you would be better served in getting the Dart III. So I say this: Do not spend more in replacing parts on this eight speed bike as It makes little sense to spend more in parts then the bike originally cost you, it isnt wise but if you just plan on replacing the fork then you will do fine. I would personally keep the money and the fork you have and use it till it bottoms out and needs to be replaced! Edit: after more thought and answering your other question (related) It would be no advantage in doing this as you are not really getting a big difference between the two except 20mm more travel and a lockout other wise the spring coil and oil shock is the same and compression dampening will not make one fell better over the other.|`|WAGpAh8oaa	is this jacob? lol anyway the the hardrock come w/ a SR Sun Tour but i wouldnt spend more on a dart 3|`|JSGLKnA4aa	dart3|`|AA11603594	Get the Marzocchi 55 TST2 at www.jensonusa.com ( 1-888-880-3403)|`|eIq3akGWaa	Dart III|`|s21NpQGJaa	get a dart 3 lol and good decision on changing the stock parts on ur bike have fun!!
Cl6KbcAGaa	I answered this one previously and as I stated the Dart III is still an entry level fork although priced under $200 at most places it is entry level and yes it has a lockout feature but I would not spend the $ to do this as the suntour fork you have is fine...use it until its done. Don't go spending more money on this bike in new parts than is necessary and don't out-price the bike at all! You probably paid about $500 for this bike and you propose putting a $150 fork at 4.8lbs on your bike and you will not change much in performance at all over what you have now. It will not make this bike any lighter...but if it is what you want then go right ahead...|`|WAGpAh8oaa	Sun Tour comes on hard rock|`|s21NpQGJaa	dart 3 is bomb proof cuz it uses air shocks so its impossible to break anything unless u bail ur bike
AA11016927	I own the Spinning version of the Mag-touch and it is phenomenal. They are one of the most sensitive, well-balanced rods I've ever owned. <br>  <br>  Cabelas is one of the few company's that excels at duplicating (copying) expensive name-brand rods. They don't always get it right but in this case (in my opinion) they hit a home run!<br>  <br>  The only minor issue with the Magtouch is how slippery the handle can be, (esp when wet). Other than that it is well worth the sale price. <br>  <br>  The problem?<br>  <br>  The Medium action will work great for a general purpose rod EXCEPT for Crankin', (because of it's fast action graphite design).  <br>  <br>  And the cool part? You have 60 days to make up your mind! <br>  <br>  The other issue? It's a GREAT rod for the SALE price, (I got mine for $59).

I was little I even remember Ralph Earnhardt on the dirt track in NC, well yes my late dad was his crew chief/mechanic/pit crew member, but I will always be a Nascar fan.. But I have been fans of other drivers as well, not all were Earnhardts. Nascar is about a lot more other drivers, theres the Petty's, Allisons, Pearson, Yarborough,Fireball Roberts, Lorenzen, Jr Johnson, Gant, more than I have room to list.

Nuj1eScCaa	It's pretty much pointless. All it does is say to the public that he was sent there. As far as any kind of rehabilitation or alcohol counseling, it's pointless. The only person who cam make Charles stop drinking and driving is Charles attending AA or something, not 3 days in jail.|`|BX0muv3raa	To show that he is a common man, that he doesn't think that his celebrity should automatically prevent him from a normal person's punishment. 9 out of 10 DUIs or DWIs are handled with probation, so most never see jail time in the first place, unless there are repeat offenders. Most celebrities that commit far more heinous crimes haven't suffered a fifth of the "punishment" that Barkley is doing. So yeah, it might be a publicity stunt, but give the man credit for being a man, and not an uppity celebrity who believes himself to be above the law, he deserves that.

wGQVlv5Faa	I have th ultimate jump secret!<br>  DO THEM AS MUCH AS YOU CAN.|`|hxQaqSvkaa	cheerwiz.com<br>  cheerleadingcoachescorner.com<br>  cheerleading.about.com<br>  geocitiecougarscheer.com<br>  ms.pineapplescheer.com<br>  cheersavvy.com (my site!!)|`|Cvi0ncG8aa	Do alot of running and a ton of ab work outs. If you have good ab muscles your jumps will e better and be very clean and tight with your movements Always always smile even when you mess up just keep smiling like your on crack. When you try out keep eye contact with the judges and maybe give the tough one a wink. keep stretching. Be loud.   Tighten your stomach when you yell it  helps.  Practice kicks and if you do tumbling practice a lot of that, build a lot of arm muscle for stunts it doesn't matter if your a flyer or base or base you need to be really strong and just have a good attitude and remember to have fun and i'm sure you do fine. Don't stress.|`|jRoBCJdaaa	try to find any thing that will give you more height and when you think your ready go down to the floor
BB6HGbnPaa	For a girl, that is probably good for a freshman if you just started track. If you ran before, 2:30 should be where you are at right now.|`|HlD9dRF2aa	Boys: 2:15.  Men: 2:30.  That's what qualified for J.V. track in high school.  In college, around 2 minutes for both.|`|lNHqduIQaa	ehh, the girls on my team run in the 2:25's-2:40's for the 4x800. and the guys run it even faster. and yes, ten seconds is a lot in that short of a race. but work hard & there's always room for improvement :)|`|5b774b8022ffdba0eef956713e227ae2aa	i run it in about 2:20-2:25 and im not the best runner but i would say thats decent
wGQVlv5Faa	Okay well I cheer for a national ranked allstar gym. We have a couple level three teams. Now, I know for allstars that a kick full is level 4. I am not sure for school. But from what I have seen, It seems that it would not be legal for a level three "school" team. I have seem many school teams and they seem to fit into the "level 4 allstar" catagory when they do kick fulls. I have seem other high schools that would fit into the "level 3 allstar" catagory and they do not do kick fulls.|`|hxQaqSvkaa	NO, it is totally illegal. In competitive it is illegal and school it is double illegel. a full is fine though.
94Ti4bHtaa	Gonzalez is much faster than Reggie and has equally as good hands. I think his route running is great because he is a perfectionist. His iq is literally off the charts and a smart young player can go far with Peyton throwing to him. I think he will automatically be #2 with Harrison gone. I think we would be WAY more dangerous if Harrison would have come back to play slot receiver.|`|20zLmf3Laa	I think he will be regardless if they draft another WR or not because he's got more time in the offense than any rookie they may draft.|`|fiaFQAWWaa	He might even be #1.|`|JNTQwvtTaa	Should he?<br>  <br>  He already is.
4rURc0roaa	The player highlighted in blue can be moved by pressing the left stick thing on the 360 controller. So move the player to a save spot then inbound the ball.|`|z5rlyGXNaa	calm down its just a game.|`|16a98a2e3b381ee93d6e965b24b0c322aa	there are 2 ways to stop it,  1) By you also choosing full court press,<br>  <br>  2) By turning off your brothers controller.|`|ZRCXvxUYaa	u should just do it too and run deep then runback with someone else too thats wat i do
4nd1uCvoaa	I just got done with the whole recruiting process and stuff.<br>  If your a junior you can start contacting coaches. If you don't have good results you ought to do really well on your erg scores then (if you want a scholarship.)<br>  If you don't wanna go that route you can totally just go on as a walk on. Lots of girls do it instead of getting recruited.<br>  And I don't have a very big team either but we try really hard and we perform fairly well.<br>  Good luck. I'm so excited to start coxing in college!!!|`|JsMd6PrCaa	I think they expect you to have at least done one year of high school crew, because there are a lot of terms etc that you will need to know, and they probably wont want to spend time teaching you when everyone else understands.  But if you took some rowing classes or something and if you're really really really naturally good you could probably get a spot..
ZauPx2Ffaa	A stick is a stick is a stick. Especially these days....<br>  <br>  The big factor is you. If you have the skill, it doesn't matter what stick you use to a certain point. Granted, there will be a bit of a difference from stick to stick depending on flex or stick length and possibly the curve style. <br>  <br>  But for the most part it is the hands that hold the stick that make the difference.....<br>  <br>  Practice, practice, practice!<br>  <br>  But if i had to answer i would say...Warrior Dolomyte Spyne. Draper curve (for me, at least). Its a bit whippier than an Easton but I guess that all comes with what flex you choose. You could also look at a P92 Naslund NikeBauer XXXX.|`|wi1bcwd3aa	i use the nikebauer one95 i have a sick wrist shot with alot of power <br>  also the s17 is really good it just breaks to easily|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	the rbk 9k o-stick is really good one for wristers, i love it.
JD5NQxeNaa	Deron Williams has taken his team to the Conference championships before. Not to mention, he won every head 2 head in the career of both PG's every season, so this should answer your question.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Jord is such a dumbass, I can forget when he said Deron. But he's a certified idiot when he said hands down.<br>  <br>  CP3. He has more wins, much much better stats, and no his team isn't better.|`|apY85Qmtaa	CP3 is much better than Deron Williams. Sure Deron owns him head-to-head but if you compare Hornets games to Jazz games you will see that Chris Paul has a much greater impact on his team.|`|1IGXttyaaa	Chris Paul nba leader of steals per game|`|N3AiQRJFaa	CP3 is better|`|xbQZ6xXvaa	cp3|`|k96dkcIraa	Chris Paul is a better pure point guard. He has led the league in assists the past two years, while scoring 20+ game after game.  Paul is also much more of threat from downtown. Williams has more ability at creating his own shots, but Paul is a more complete point guard.|`|w8ucfG3Qaa	CP3 is way better. He has got much better stats and is in a better team. If the Hornets didn't have CP3 they would have a tough time having to find a better point guard. CP3 has a very bright NBA future ahead of him.|`|QZmBZZTTaa	chris paul definitely, he faster, and averages more assists per game than deron williams. He can put up a lot of points also.. Plus, he can also drive in at the basket really well|`|c3ce9f916abdade63289dc55a62d405caa	chris paul, deron williams is having a good season, but chris paul is better by far|`|ZRCXvxUYaa	Deron Williams<br>  <br>  <br>  BY FAR|`|Z66OJsk4aa	it has to be chris paul he has a better team. and chris means more to his team and has better numbers|`|5X3AkbD1aa	cp3 but d-will definitley will make competition for paul|`|W7Dr5YaEaa	close but it's d-will.
3PWXaOgjaa	that's a good idea.|`|wGO7thhwaa	you guys have nothing to give back in return without ruining the "perfect team"<br>  the jazz would want at least gasol/bynum, and that puts a hole down low on the "perfect team"<br>  <br>  and plus, whats wrong with fisher.<br>  hes one of my fave veterans|`|ISQAWUf2aa	No way maybe in the future but not now for years they have tried to get the "perfect team" and finnally we did.They got the perfect team and will stay like that until someone retires like kobe then they will start making more trades.|`|W7Dr5YaEaa	well the Lakers need a PG in the future, Luke is better off starting he's a good passer and has chemistry with the starting 5 while Ariza is better off the bench as a energy defensive guy.|`|PdIhUGh5aa	honestly williams would be nice fit for LA but they would probably have to give up Bynum and some draft picks so I don't see it happening.|`|A3raPhkDaa	nah i have a better idea they should try to get paul leron duncan and howard then they be a perfect team|`|ZRCXvxUYaa	they could try but they wont get him|`|Q7YeqddMaa	it will be better if it was chris paul|`|7e6Vm4cDaa	yes! will win alot of rings!|`|IiWz11Kraa	Stop robbing Utah Jazz. LOL<br>  <br>  Lakers are the best team in the league right now, and when Bynum comes, they're gonna be unstoppable. I'd like to see Ariza in cavs though.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Next when I see another question of you, it'll be of gathering Dwight.|`|BX0muv3raa	Ummm, you are awarre of a little thing called the salary cap, right? This would be financially impossible for the Lakers to pull off with out losing a key player (only realisticallyGasol, since Odom is garbage and Bynum is losing himself a shitload of money being an injured bum) and Utah already has two unassuming losers of big men in Boozer and Okur. Plus Utah is gonna have a shitload of money once their pansy bigs  undeserved contracts come off the books this year so Williams is surely staying put, unless he really wants to play on the closest thing to a perfect team, the SPURS! <br>  <br>  Say what you want, but they are the winningest team in all of sports with the most titles and highest win percentage of all 135 major North American sports teams, and that is THE closest thing to perfect as can be.|`|HiuNSScLaa	yep walton 1st pick and odom or bynum maybe even throw in fisher|`|mFz4sdUjaa	That would never happen......|`|N3AiQRJFaa	Yea but who would they trade for...
lTeXIjpOaa	if you want to bet on windsor or northville, i like to bet $2 on peter wrenn the driver across the board everytime he drives, the guy is amazing in the sulky, also the standardbred dream knight at windsor is a good pick; also the admiral|`|GfFqTpXSaa	oh i know dont bet on them lol <br>  i have a ex racer n its to worth the money
rwKMJ0Rbaa	Shooting is the #1 takedown, specifically a head inside single leg. You neck snap can be used as a great set up though! the hardest thing about shooting is getting the confidence, just know that from practice, if you take a bad shot, you know how to get out of that situation.|`|8Im1iGFTaa	try neck snapping and if they don't go all the way down then shoot|`|8DMDTogvaa	It is usually better to shoot, but if you think that you do better by neck snapping, then go ahead and do it. Just curious, what weight are you, this might have an effect.|`|11YKVOQEaa	i push,snap head and then shoot. it depends on how big the guy is because for me snapping is better on short guys and shooting is better on tall people.
6StGTYf2aa	I think James Hardy will give up his number for Owens....With Owens in the mix, watch out the Bills are gonna be a serious contender.  James Hardy I think is about 6'6 and about 230lbs...If he could add on another 25-30lbs they could try and convert him into a tightend.  That way they wouldn't have to waste such a high draft pick on that overrated tightend out of Oklahoma State.  I think the Bills are gonna have a very poent offense this year, say what you want about TO, but he produces everywhere he has ever played.  With Lee Evans lined up as the other receiver, thats gonna be hell for a defense trying to determine who to double up on.  If the Bills can add a couple of more peices to their defense like a Cato June they will be a serious super bowl contender!|`|l0iCqzlQaa	he will wear the number 4, as in Buffalo's spot in the AFC EAST at then end of the year|`|xbQZ6xXvaa	i heard he was gunna wear 202038309449855<br>  <br>  <br>  what if he did <br>  <br>  but he'll probably be stubborn and tell the guy who has it to switch and then he will get it|`|69bb96acaa	This is a interesting question I caught myself asking the same question seeing how Owens has had 81 in the NFL longer and he is going to contribute to the team Hardy will have no problem giving that number up to make a playoff appearance for the 09 season|`|yWcPOTsAaa	32|`|XPFhS1EDaa	I think James Hardy will give up #81|`|5B6w8mxVaa	he'll get #81|`|YTjvOIfSaa	i think he is going to wear number 18 opposite of 81 because i dont think hardy is giving up his number, what about these bills this year, yes they may have the hardest schedule but i see them as a playoff contender, with an upcoming qb, a pro bowl rb, and one of the best wr duos in the league, we could seriously go somewhere.|`|iUIWQZiUaa	im pretty sure it's #1 because if you go on the bills website, you can order a terrell owens jersey and it has number 1 on it|`|JRBYrVd1aa	On a buffalo radio station [WGR 550}, they said he will probabbly wear #1|`|49agi58waa	He will not wear #1 - NFL restricts wide receivers to 10-19 and 80-89.|`|mUSs0lyaaa	he'll spend the 6.5 million dollars he got to buy the number.|`|0eeYKOVdaa	hardy will give it up he isnt gonna keep a 6 time pro bowlers jersey being a 1 year guy that hardly plays|`|63PdLNMQaa	well he said hes was gonna play 181% i think hes gonna do something cheesy and be #181|`|gZjDp4Hdaa	I am sure he will wear 81. 32 is retired by OJ Simpson. <br>  <br>  #4?? He aint Brett Favre lol|`|YIf04EFkaa	00|`|Ztl2P1Eyaa	either hardy will give up 81 or he'll jus take #1
l0iCqzlQaa	I would take Sherill, he racks up the saves|`|AA11720887	Sherill is a closer and Jurgens is not. Jurgens can give you a few SO's and maybe keep your ERA down but will add little to your saves.Sherill will give you over 20 saves this year and maybe more.  I wouldn't have a reliever who isn't a closer. Just isn't worth taking a spot on my roster. Sherill!|`|qy8czfnCaa	Depends on the league I guess.<br>  <br>  Reliever heavy stats = Sherill<br>  <br>  IP, SO's, etc = Jurrjens<br>  <br>  Milan - Jurrjens isn't a reliever if that's what you're saying. He won 13 games for the Braves last year as a 22-year old.
E67FMi4Waa	runningback..<br>  quarterback<br>  wide receiver<br>  they always get the most credit<br>  like in soccer the forwards get the<br>  most credit and the goalies are<br>  always treated like trash...get<br>  the best position possible|`|7RziqsDcaa	Have your older brother, dad, uncle, relative whip the ball as hard as they can at you and you have to catch 10 in a row, with one hand. Then you're ready.|`|4rQbLeTbaa	there are many things that can help with catching a football. personally i think the Cutters Great Catch gloves help a lot. they have a little ball in the middle so it forces you to use your finger tips to catch with. but really no matter what you do practice is the only thing that will make you better. tight end possibly could be a choice because they dont do quite as much catching as recievers and backs, but blocking is definately a key in that position.|`|xYRl0KABaa	I have great hands....and I honestly think that it is one of the only skills that can't be taught. I would just practice, work on your one-handed catches also, they are crucial being a factor on the field.
A5aYD4S3aa	garge, park ect practise striking the breast and groin. because it sounds like one of you are getting ready for a real fight with someone.but dont do anything stupid. if your talking about backyard wrestling. dont do something stupid like jumping off the roof on someone. leave that crap to the pros|`|29WFvvNPaa	what a stupid thing to do.  Go to the police stations parking lot.........then i bet you'll have a laugh.|`|YSRXarooaa	first answer are you retarded? She has a girl name and her picture is a girl. Besides what does that have to do with what she asked? (Sorry I don't know the answer either but my god!) EDIT: Oh I thought you were talking about martial arts. But then I read it and I realized you are just a dumb middle school child. I know in Middle school it is filled with drama but seriously don't be pulled in to it. You don't need to try to fight to be cool or something. Don't let any of the drama or pressure get to you because after middle school it won't matter!|`|4Ovf0Gr8aa	so whos practicing ?<br>  i'm guessing you guys are practicing on eachother because one of yours got a fight in the future lol<br>  <br>  i don't know what to tell you..... lol think about what you are asking lol<br>  go practice at your house while your parents are gone at the store or something.. or at work|`|AaXl5YYkaa	behind buildings like the movie theater? that's where all the fights in my city take place. if you live in an apartment then the roof.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	someones garage.|`|QdFdoB7uaa	um why would u wanna fight with ur friends?|`|T2NK9u9maa	on top of the sears tower in the middle of a thunderstorm. or, if you cant get to chicago, behind a church as the bells are ringing.|`|tgPo9CtMaa	The first rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club. <br>  <br>  The second rule of fight club is you do not talk about fight club.|`|t0VQGp0Jaa	bathroom buy dont have a crowed that will make it hot box just do it by your self lol|`|CKpxVeucaa	what the heck.

EU7CUy2aaa	whenever we play sports at my school i just don't wear any pants or boxers. And normally we play tackle football in the mud... now that i think about it, we don't wear any clothes at all. those are the best summer days|`|gVlTlpb2aa	ummmmm idk|`|mVcnsy0Daa	Some spandex don't require underwear at all (there's a built in gusset) for volleyball shorts.

stoMU1ytaa	If your in dance then it would be called a "Sea Jump". They are hard to get right. You bend your knees to get momentum, jump up and try to touch your toes to your head from behind you, with your legs spread apart. Arch your back and look at the wall or something behind you. Your doing this all in the air. To help get more momentum put your arms back behind you.|`|nrnZKaWvaa	www.ivotepolls.com/?p=12<br>  <br>  it might help you|`|SPqC4CQwaa	its a sea jump lol  and yeaa it is its not hard to do jsut hard to land sometimes|`|gfmTgLDKaa	No, not that I heard of. There is a ground C, but not a high C. Well not that I know off. It can be a move in your area, moves can vary from place to place. Although there is a set move made by the Federation of Cheerleaders.<br>  <br>  P.S.: Max S is not a cheer leading expert. :D<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|VSYhHiOeaa	there is no such jump. if she told you there is and then shows you something, she either made it up or its something thats exclusive to where you live locally.|`|1s2LSgqPaa	yes|`|ZR7sikznaa	yes it is that jump is hard i almost broke my ankle|`|IRV1MZVFaa	It is not a real jump.

SlvWiR8eaa	like 9 pasific time
0tpLq6meaa	No, unstring it on a daily basis. The reason? Because leaving it strung up for extended periods will weaken the limbs over a period of time.|`|ZKikquiOaa	While a modern bow won't have any problem being left strung, there is more potential for damage when a bow is strung.  Someone bump into your bow and the bow fell, it'll suffer greater damage when strung vs not strung.  So when storing a bow, it's best to unstring it, it'll take you all of about 5 seconds to do it anyway.|`|QrjuueMCaa	Not the best idea. I'd suggest keeping it strung through the hunting and practicing season, and unstrung for the rest. The problem with unstringing your bow every day which others have mentioned, is you usually don't get the same amount of twists to the string which will affect the accuracy and poundage of the bow. If you do unstring it, make sure to count the twists you put in it beforehand.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	No, Only when you are going to use it Only.* Keep it stored in a horizontal position supported on two (2*) pressure points, one on the lower limb & one point on the upper limb.* Like when you hang your gun up on a gun rack that's mounted on the wall.*|`|MoUtk7cUaa	no, you're supposed to 'un-string' it when it's not in use.
7a2e5916bcbc3ac76a1b008dde5f6010aa	No, it has happened before, many times<br>  <br>  In the very first NHL game, Harry Hyland scored 5 goals, all unassisted.<br>  <br>  In 1993, Mario Lemieux scored a hattrick where all 3 goals were a direct result of takeaways.|`|PtRmhxU9aa	A side note to that stat as well - 3 of Nash's 4 career hat tricks has been against Detroit. Columbus is leading the season series against Detroit 3-2.|`|AA11916920	Not a first, but man it was nice.  I was at Nationwide when Nash got his 1st Hat trick against Detroit this season.  I've been lucky enough to be there for both of Nash's hat tricks, now I have two hats in the display case :)<br>  Like someone else said, this was his 3rd against Detroit so far during his career, I think that may be a first, as far as players to score hat tricks against detroit. 2 of the 3 have been in Joe Louis.  I saw an unhappy fan give the finger after Nash got the hat trick.  I also watched them throw a Jacket fan out after throwing his hockey mask on the ice.  I laugh because I've been to games in Columbus when their fans have thrown the stupid squid on the ice.  I would have paid good money to return the favor in Detroit!!!|`|MnMkgAscaa	And hopefully a Last.|`|K9nWS2kIaa	i'm not sure but thats amazing, he's a true hall of famer, even though i'm not a jackets fan, i hope they make the playoffs and go far, Nash's my favorite play so thats why :)|`|78db3c7925be947882cbd3c480e0596daa	No...I hope he gets more and More and More and More...CARRY THE FLAG JACKETS!!!!|`|SfTWwm97aa	I agree with Dino. Man that guy always puts a pounding on Detroit. As well as the Blue Jackets as a whole.

Having a wrong sized cup could be dangerous in numerous ways.<br>  <br>  I couldn't find a cup big enough for myself, so I ended up having to use a big pot.

k96dkcIraa	The three point line wasn't in college basketball till the 1986-1987 season. Jodan was drafted in 1984, so there was not a three point line yet in college basketball.
JSGLKnA4aa	weight and degree's both. when ever you change clubs you need to adjust to them.|`|2fJLXXmqaa	Well this seemed suspicious so I checked it out and found that The Callaways are about 1 degree stronger than the Cleveland's are so you will hit the Callaways further. Its that simple. Really.|`|sbAXlECuaa	Although your callaways would be a degree or two stronger, that won't make the difference of 15 yards. I would say the difference in weight would explain this better.|`|sBrummATaa	well maybe if your a tempo swinger, your heavier irons pull your arms down which makes the clubs go faster, so with a lighter club you dont swing as hard, which can make you lose distance
ZsSVDKOtaa	take the spark arrestor off the exhaust pipe, drill holes in the airbox but cover them with mesh or a screen. Rejet the card to allow for larger holes. Buy a high-perf air filter. They're cheap and do a lot. Put a smaller sprocket on  and put smaller tires on. Racecars dont have 24's. reduce weight somehow.

If Uconn wins the Big East, they'll be in the east.  Otherwise, depends on who the 4th team is, as to who gets the West and who gets the other one.

nRBC4E5saa	The closest thing to that format I can think of is the Shidokan Open, also known as "The Triathalon of Martial Arts".  The first round is bareknuckle, full-contact karate, the second round is K-1 rules kickboxing, and the third round is "submission fighting", which is basically MMA with no ground-and-pound, but you wear the smaller gloves and can strike in the stand-up.
tzrLDbHWaa	You just move your head, lol.  <br>  <br>  But seriously, its hard to explain on here how you would do one, if you don't already know.  Here's what you do though.  Go to the court and shoot.  Don't worry about making the shot, just focus on what motions you're making when you take the shot, specifically your head movements.  Thats what you want to do for a head fake.  The movement you make with your head as you're coming into your shot.  Thats the idea of a head fake.  Show them the head movement to make them think you're about to shoot and get them off balance.|`|apY85Qmtaa	Pretty simple but you'll need to practice. <br>  <br>  From the triple threat position, jerk your head up, along with the ball. Get on your toes if you want, but don't travel.

ZbNXVQu7aa	That article made many good points, especially in making the case for why HBK should lose if his career isn't on the line, but there's one thing I strongly disagree with: the article claims that HBK is already better than Undertaker.<br>  <br>  HBK is, and always has been, a phenomenal performer, but so is Undertaker.  Just because the 16-0 streak is Undertaker's biggest claim to fame, that doesn't mean it's his only claim to fame, nor does it mean that HBK is better (or worse) than Undertaker.  I see them as different-but-equally-brilliant performers.  I just like Undertaker better.<br>  <br>  While HBK doesn't need the victory, and while I would love nothing more than to see Undertaker's streak survive this year, this is by no means a predictable ending, at least not in my eyes.  In fact, this is the most concerned I've been about the future of The Streak since WrestleMania 21.<br>  <br>  WQ2: Cena has more than his fair share of haters, and they find their way into WWE crowds much more often than I would like, so of course he'll receive boos if he's slated to be Undertaker's opponent at WrestleMania 26.  If I'm in the WrestleMania 26 crowd, I certainly won't be among those booing Cena, but my loudest cheer for Cena still won't be as loud as even my quietest cheer for Undertaker.|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	I agree with the article the Undertaker will probably remain undefeated in his career and i hope he stays that way because he's going to retire sooner or later and i want the future to say only one man has been undefeated at wrestlemania and thats the deadman the Undertaker. <br>  <br>  <br>  WQ2: I think a lot of fans everywhere love HBK more than anybody else besides the Undertaker besides kids who will most likely cheer Cena. I personally like Cena as a competitor and if he really did wrestle taker the wwe might even think about letting Cena win because well he's the future of this business. If Cena did wrestle Taker next year and taker is still here than yeah cena will get booed so badly more than HBK possibly. If he beats the Undertaker at WM than maybe all the long time wwe fans would dislike him.<br>  <br>  <br>  As good as HBK is and made many great matches and revolutionized the business and many younger superstars looked up to him like Y2J and stuff. Undertaker has done just as many great things and put over as much guys as the Undertaker did. Taker also made the first Hell in a Cell with HBK and carried this business.|`|Z5bH2LOZaa	Of course he will. Taker is probably the most loved wrestler in modern times. Just about every one respects him.|`|gXeDKVLJaa	if cena ended the streak the wwe world woud be pissed<br>  <br>  dont like cena but that would be smart for wwe to do, there would be a up roar<br>  <br>  rko 4 life|`|9dMc4ZMRaa	I Wish!!! Cena is the biggest jackass in the WWE, not only does he desrve to be booed, he deserves to work as a jobber.|`|3ZYDT42saa	Taker is a Legend, In my eyes Cena is still a newbee. If he faced taker at WM26 he would definately get booed. the only people that would cheer is little kids. <br>  <br>  Plus i heard Taker might be retiring this year, shortly after WM25|`|hjTTW68Haa	I think the article is absolutely right. And neither fight is not one I will die to see.  Now Triple H vs Randy Orton is what I do want to see. Also if <br>   wins then He would most likely a heel.

V3deprUCaa	If he was alive, nascar would still be 4 wide through the turns at Daytona. If he was alive, 43 cars would still be eligble to win the championship with 10 races to go.<br>  <br>  I think that Earnardt's time was running out in the Winston Cup (never say Sprint Cup and Dale Earnhardts name in the same sentence). He probably would have retired after the 02' or 03' season. But I think that he would have probably gone out with a bang and won a championship one of those 2 years, or hell, even swept 2 titles in 2 seasons.<br>  <br>  And as for Johnson, only time will tell. It's a long road from here to Homestead.|`|Up2sP3eGaa	Who knows? If you want a totally fabricated guess and some made up rationale... he might have won one more as he had finished second in 2000 and was still running strong. He hadn't finished outside the top 10 in points since 1992; but he also hadn't won a championship since 1994.<br>  <br>  As for JJ, I'm hoping Kyle keeps him from making it four in a row; but if for any reason Kyle doesn't end up hoisting the Cup at Homestead, then I wouldn't mind seeing Jimmie put another record in the books.|`|anFNmvBWaa	he wuld have about 2 more cup titles<br>  <br>  He can win for buut i dont thak so|`|mIdcJEJNaa	He was about to retire..

fS9EUKOxaa	Strake Jesuit and Dallas Jesuit were abandoned by their previous sports league in the TCIL when the other schools fled to TAPPS in 2000; and TAPPS instituted an enrollment cap to keep the Jesuit schools out, as the Jesuit schools had been dominant in the past.  They were without a league for three years.  In 2003 Dallas Jesuit filed a lawsuit and was admitted into the UIL along with Strake Jesuit.  They are the only private schools in the league.  Even when their student populations are doubled they should be 4A, but the UIL elected to place them in 5A.

One glaring exception, of course,  is Lawrence Phillips, but remember Ahman Green, Mike Rozier, Cory Schlesinger, and of course, Correll Buckhalter all had ok careers.  The best being Ahman Green, but since Houston cut him, i don't know where he'll be.  Buckhalter is with the Broncos now, and he should do ok with them.  Philly made a mistake letting Correll go, IMHO.

b7JS16dyaa	I'd have HBK's legacy over Undertaker's, but that's a tough question. I just think Shawn has had a greater impact on many wrestlers and events than the Phenom. <br>  <br>  Shawn has been inspiration for guys like Jericho and Edge, he helped boost Triple H's overall career with D-X, he was the first involved in many things, like the Ladder match, he's involved in many controversial events like the Montreal Screwjob, Curtain Call Incident, The Klique, and old D-Generation X antics, among other things. He's certainly had many entertaining highs and lows in his career.|`|gXHxf2G9aa	I would chose HBK to be destroyed or forgotten.  The reasons I chose HBK is I feel even though he has contributed ALOT to wrestling and there's no denying that I still think the deadman has shown more dedication, skill and has been involved in much more entertaining feuds than HBK.  His feuds with Kane, Mankind and Batista have had fans on the edge of their seats and its very rarly you see a 7ft man jump over the top rope and plough into his opponents with the crowd shouting the chant "holy S**t"!.  He introduced the casket and inferno match to the WWE and for that I think the WWE universe is very grateful for.|`|KIOR56r6aa	Wow, one of the hardest questions ever. But since I'm Taker fan, I'll have to say HBK.|`|PyJ3PMRnaa	Interesting (Starred). I would choose The Undertaker, because Shawn Michaels has been been in more 5-star matches in his storied career, has been in more rivalries, and more controversial than The Dead Man. They are both huge Superstars and will be inducted into The Hall of Fame one day as two of the greatest Superstars to ever step into a WWE ring, or wrestling ring, for that matter.|`|qlpjDvoNaa	I hate to say this but I guess Undertaker. Undertaker is certainly the most well respected guy in the business but on camera Shawn Michaels has such an impact. I just think when they both retire they'll be more matches of Shawn Michaels that people say were the greatest of all time rather then Undertaker.|`|qh9EOXKOaa	Undertaker, I like them both but my favorite wrestler of all time is  is Shawn Michaels I have to say the Undertaker....Tough Question|`|YyEOi1Tpaa	tough question really I can't choose either I'm a fan of both but Taker because Shawn is a leader and inspiration to many wrestlers and with DX was one of the main reason we still have WWE today|`|jSh0wWdEaa	who are they. I don't have a clue what you're talking about. Please explain.

Funny how many doctors and Doctor groups will fight firearms ownership for the dastardly damage caused by them. Maybe they just want to take the statistical heat off themselves.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Yes, that is Amazing.* Great research and report.*|`|an7eyj1caa	I've said all along doctors should be banned. After all, there is no Constitutional right to keep and bear doctors.|`|DHIudHy2aa	I think that is a misleading stat. It doesn't take into effect that pretty much all of those gun shot deaths would also be counted as a physician death as most people would go to the emergency room or something if they got shot. It also doesn't account for the fact that there are people who come into emerg that the doctors just can't save. This is NOT an argument against guns though, so don't think of me as some anti-gun crusader.|`|sZFLtCbdaa	I can easily believe that. The figure I am more familiar with is that of physicians. They operate or work on a different plain. That is why the high mortality rate. And yet it is the gun owners who are villains in this world of unfair justice.|`|ocmiI3HNaa	Larry, <br>  <br>  It helps if you actually READ the post. It clearly says ACCIDENTALLY. <br>  <br>  That means, a doctor screws up and kills someone, not that the person was beyond saving when they showed up. <br>  <br>  Anyways, great post!

Soe members of the New World Order were good wrestlers: Scott Norton, Scott Hall, Buff Bagwell,  Konan. Most of the others were bums. Most of the great wrestlers in WCW were the undercard wrestlers: Ultimo Dragon, Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, Eddie Guerrero, Harlem Heat, the Steiners. The NWO Members had big, fat guaranteed contracts, played backstage politics, refused to lose matches,  never pushed younger wrestlers and lead to the demise of WCW. John Cena loses matches and elevates opponents, something the NWO never did. Nor does John Cena play backstage politics and sabotage other wrestlers careers. Hulk Hogan, Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Kevin Nash are among those who have been accused of sabotaging other wrestlers careers, refusing to push younger wrestlers, make opponents look good, lose matches, lose championships. I haven't read of one instance of John Cena ever doing that.|`|22d01d94b439160aaa464f3b640e5146aa	Well first, switch to decaf.

paIUgtLRaa	The Steelers have one of the best chances in the league. They are returning 11 starters on defense, so far, they are keeping all of their coaches, and 9 or 10 starters on offense are coming back. They have one of the best opposing schedules after going 12-4 with the hardest last year.<br>  <br>  The only one in the AFC might be the Patriots, but with that aging defense, and some loss of weapons on offense, but with Brady coming back from a devastating injury, the Patriots could wobble. Not to mention they are going to have one of the more hardest schedules.<br>  <br>  San Diego is in the midst of being killed by Norv Turner, and the relationship with Tomlinson is coming to an end. Too much drama in the land of the Charger. Indianapolis, Manning is getting old, and the loss of Harrison could prove to be too much. With Miami, the thrill is gone. The Wildcat is over. The surprise is past, and defenses are catching on. Miami will catch no one of guard, this year.<br>  <br>  NFC has Minnesota, Arizona, and New York. Minnesota, if they get a decent quarterback. Unless Jackson has one heck of a year (unlikely), Minnesota will suffer, but still win division based upon a weak division. Arizona should do well, but can they overcome the losses of their Offensive and Defensive Coordinators, and can they hold off the potentially surging 49ers? The Giants could do well, but how much is the loss of Burress going to hurt? They will have to draft and draft well.<br>  <br>  I see this coming Super Bowl again going to the AFC, no matter who from the AFC goes. With this win, the AFC will tie up the all-time record between the conferences. Not since 1989, have they been tied up. With an AFC win, they will be tied, 22-22.|`|LLXfaOK9aa	Unless they trade for Bernard Pollard... NO CHANCE! The Pats will dominate yet again with Brady at the helm. The only reason they won this year is because Brady was injured.|`|GUjr6whNaa	No chance they wouldnt have even won the superbowl this time if they didnt pay off every ref in the country|`|A5p9g4tMaa	No It will be buffalo and Giants with buffalo winning know that they have two good receivers.|`|gEd1jlOEaa	maybe they win by luck|`|JNTQwvtTaa	God yes.

XNpnK4vpaa	There are H&K products and there are H&K products.<br>  There are Soviet products and there are Soviet products.<br>  <br>  The AK-47 enjoys a reputation for being able to shoot in a variety of harsh conditions.  It does not enjoy a reputation for being able to shoot precisely.  Still, when you want its strengths, it is a good choice.<br>  <br>  I like Heckler & Koch USP pistols.  I feel they're worth the price for the features.  I can't speak to the value of H&K rifles.<br>  <br>  I don't know what you find "so amazingly efficient" about the Soviet Union's guns.<br>  <br>  I don't intend to get involved in your opinions of capitalist versus socialist or marxist or facsist systems.  Personally, I do like the concept of owning my own property instead of property being owned by a collective state and at risk of being taken away from me at any time for no reason.|`|QNX9NET3aa	HK. is bettor,you already answered your own question. I have been shooting for 30+ years. Some Soviet era weapons can be ok. However the overall quality of the guns and ammo just aren't up to western standards. This goes for just about every Soviet manufactured product. Guns,cars,motorcycles etc.|`|dpSr0icwaa	HK are NOT undeniably high quality.<br>  <br>  HK made one gun that stood head and shoulders above it's bretherin of the time, the Mp5, by shrinking down an assault rifle.  Of course, now everyone and their uncle have done that and the MP5 is just another also-ran.<br>  <br>  In the field of long range precision semiautos H&K gives us the PSG-1, and it is mached by the Knight Industries SR-25 and the Armalite AR-10T for a QUARTER of the price.<br>  <br>  In the field of Battle Rifle, H&K gives us the G3 (the grandparent of the MP5) and it is inferior to the FN-FAL, the right arm of the free world<br>  <br>  In the field of Assault Rifle oh boy did H&K have problems.  They started out with shrinking the G3 down to handle 5.56 and calling it the G33...but this didn't work out that well.  Then they went back to the drawing board and addressed all the problems in the G33.  They came back and developed the G-41, and while this was a good gun, it was TWICE AS EXPENSIVE as other guns that were equally good, and 4 times as expensive as guns that were almost as good.  So no one wanted the G-41.  Back to the drawing board, and the G-36 is developed, which is an average gun demanding above-average price because counterstrike and rainbow six have made all the gamerkids think H&K is something special.<br>  <br>  Also, dislike capitalism as much as you like. Just realize you are a 3 fold hypocrite.  It is capitalism that allows us this free exchange of informaiton on the internet itself, and on yahoo specifically.  It is capitalizm that allowed you to get exposed to weapons at all,  and in developing their weapons, the soviets went to a capitalistic system of having a few extrodinary individuals each design and submit guns, which is the antethis of the soviet 'engineer by committee' style.|`|GmRscBkPaa	Why would you personally be concerned with the efficiency of production by the Soviets?  Indestructible may warrant some consideration when choosing a firearm, but it's far from the top...I'd rank accuracy, and ease of use, ahead.<br>  <br>  I'd rather have a good HK weapon.  And HK does not support capitalism, any more or less, than the millions and millions of AK's that Russia has exported around the world.  <br>  <br>  You, my friend, are clueless...
ZWyKCsqBaa	Oh **** I though u were talking 2 me cuz dats my last name. Well I see it like this. He was doing great. He started playing with tigres. Everyone thought he was going to do great. Little by little I saw as if he would try less and less. Then he finally scored a year later in the beginning of Apertura 2008. Little by little he was regaining form. He got called up to play with Mexico vs Chile. He did decent. Now he just doesn't try.<br>  Edit- @ USC Trojan hey I remember you said you were from Costa Mesa. Do you go to CMHS? cause I do.|`|Yb0182Vxaa	his lucky moment ran out|`|6uc8ROfWaa	he lost his level|`|8zgFyfibaa	Am I going to be the only 1 to say anything posotive about him???? Lol jk well........<br>  <br>  He was a great player his time just ran out I mean you can't say he was the worst he just doesn't have it in him he played great with both pumas and cruz azul. I think that him going to europe wasn't for him,because he dint mae it in benfica or the other team he played for and that just ruined his career.<br>  <br>  If he was to stay in mexico and never play for benfica he would benn a great player to this day. <br>  <br>  He should leave tigres and play for another club where they would give him playing time. <br>  <br>  He could even go to the crappy mls and be a great player over there since we know anyone can make it in that mediocre league.|`|SvNcWfdJaa	i think its cuz hes old now and cant compete with lots of the younger players on the team|`|DO7nz8aRaa	he went to tigres and that messed him up|`|GDL00jbIaa	he should go to mls....|`|bHbhOAQvaa	The highest point in his career was with Pumas,he was one of the best and most respected players.He was still good when he went to Cruz Azul.In that era I believe he was still with the national team.<br>   <br>  But it all went downhill when he went to some European team which I believe was Benefica of Portugal.After doing so much benchwarming he lost alot of is "spark" or "flare" which made him famous with Pumas.<br>  <br>  Nowadays he is just another player. Since the golden years with Pumas,lots of talented youngsters have risen and have the potential to be great players someday.The flame has been put out. <br>  I also think it's sad because the guy had so much potential.|`|pSOmwwlIaa	He was bench for Lapuente.

Before he got seriously injured, Coria was the best on clay, right behind Rafa. I think they could've had a incredible rivalry, had Coria not sustained any injuries. This was a truly terrific match, but it's not the best match Rafa's played. That match came this year at the Aussie Open in the semis. Simply stunning!!|`|9hC7bbf7aa	Great informative answer anna for a sentimental question from Serious man...If I may, I'd watched that best of 5 setter, a long match indeed, a longest tight match that I'd watched w/o leaving the room, to say the least.<br>  <br>   Rafa captivated me as his slave in Miami March, 2004...ousting # 1 Federer and Gonzalez in earlier rounds. Coria and Nadal share the same relentless fighting spirit ? I had a sense early on Rafa will be a top player, but never in my wildest imagination he'd be # 1 at a tender age 22 ?<br>  Rafa also defeated Coria in Monte Carlo, and Beijing in 2005. <br>  Well.. back to Coria, he has been training with Higueras and aiming to return to the US Open ? according his website. Hope he Does come back, he's only 27, yet to achieve much more in his career barred by multiple injuries and the unfortunate dispute... Two Cheers to Coria and Nadal !!

fz0Aw3hLaa	I think he will, hes got a young team, with a young QB who through for over 2,500 yards last year [despite being injuried]<br>  <br>  They also have a decent defense, and a good back in Marshawn Lynch.<br>  <br>  If they play their cards right, they could maybe be playoff contenders.<br>  <br>  They have the ability to win,<br>  remember last year? They starter the season 5-1...<br>  before going 2-8.<br>  <br>  Either way, he is a good wide reciever that has had over 1,000 yards recieving for the last 9 seasons, except for 2005 when he only played 7 games due to injury. And even then, he had over 700 recieving yards.<br>  Sure he is a loudmouth, and drops passes, but he produces on the field with yards and touchdowns.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Better their than with my Chargers!|`|Vp3Lxg4taa	Hopefully for TO, he has learned not be a distraction.  If he has, he will be an asset to the Bills.

ScCZh0vQaa	On my first track meet,we didn't start running right away. First, my coach talked to us, give us tips, and told us how we should be relaxed and not nervous when we're running. <br>  Anyway the more relaxed you are when running, the more endurance you have; and when you have more endurance, you can run faster and longer distances. <br>  <br>  Some tips my coach told us about running:<br>  <br>  - Keep your mouth open so you are able to breathe easily. You should feel your lips sort-of vibrating when running. Try to breathe in through your nose and out of your mouth. However, when you get tired, you have no choice than to breathe only through your mouth. Keep your mouth open! <br>  <br>  - Don't swing your arms everywhere, your arms should be close to you. Your thumb should be on the top of your index finger, NOT making a tight fist. A tight fist doesn't make you feel relaxed. <br>  <br>  - Run like you ride a bike. The front of you foot should be touching the floor first, then your heel. Good running shoes help. Try to bring your knees high.<br>  <br>  - Only your arms and feet should be moving; nothing above your hips should be moving. Your back shouldn't hurt when running, if it does that means you aren't running right and kneeling backwards. <br>  <br>  Good luck! :D|`|l7iZhjoSaa	First track meets are always nerve racking. Your combo of events is somewhat odd, with a total of around 3 miles it's just brutal. My best advice for you is to pace yourself, because I'd imagine that the relay is more important to your coach.Try to calm your nerves, and set a goal for yourself, like running a good time, the first meet shouldn't be about winning, it should be setting standards for yourself. Make sure you warm up, and cool down well enough.|`|lNHqduIQaa	well, my first track meet i was a nervous wreck. i ate lunch around 11- thinking i was going to run at 2. so that was the only thing i packed for the day, i got to my meet, and my event (the 3200m) was pushed back to the LAST EVENT. so i ended up running on a completely empty stomach because i didn't run til 7:30. it sucked.<br>  <br>  eat pasta the night before, drink a buttload of water the day before and of your meet, just chilllll. remember that the sun will still rise the next morning no matter what. eat a pb&j for lunch that day. pack a protein bar and eat half of it with your lunch, snack on it during the day, then eat 1/4 of it 20 mins before you run. stop drinking water about 45 mins before, and don't pee right before your race. you don't want to run on a completely empty stomach. stretch alot in the hour leading up to your race. listen to music, talk with your friends. and just relaxxxx. <br>  it will be fine :)<br>  <br>  and good luccck!|`|dQfTIHAmaa	Make sure you drink lots of water the day before and get a lot of rest. On the day eat good things like a banana, cereal and a sandwich. Before my races I get nervous too and I don't feel like eating but MAKE SURE YOU DO because it's really important you have fuel in you. Warm up about 30mins before your race, and make sure you drink 30mins before the race. But don't be nervous just think of it as an experience and practice and have fun with your freinds!|`|5VXSD7C4aa	Dont be nervous! Do dynamic stretching before your race. ( fast, slightly jerky movements and stretches) drink plenty of water the night before, and the day of your meet.  Try to be pumped, and ready to go. After the 1st one they wont seem like a big deal. AND DONT miss your event! so know what time it starts and warm up before, be ready,and GOOD LUCK!<br>  <br>  PS: PACE YOUESELF!!! dont burn ur 1st too laps out in the 3200m.  Follow the 1st person in the group. try not to let him past u, if u cant keep up, follow the next guy, etc. but always stay close to someone, unless u can beat them, then go for it! And try to speed up the last 400 of the mile & start sprinting the last 100m, when u come out of the turn.  And try to do the same for the 3200m, but try to slightly speed up on the 2nd to last lap. And speed up the last 400, and sprint the last 100. DONT let anyone pass you. again GOOD LUCK!|`|cKXZOLJSaa	Well for one, good luck!<br>  don't be so nervous, there really isn't anything to be nervous about!<br>  its a wonderful and exciting thing!<br>  Its not that big of a deal, just try to stay in the lead pack and endure it!

ZKikquiOaa	As said above, the best thing to do is find a range.  The trick to learning archery properly is to have someone knowledgeable watch you.  Some places in the US offer these beginner lessons for free along with the equipment.  So, if you're in the US, go to www.usarchery.org and find the range.  Don't buy a bow until you're sure what type of bow suit you, and you won't really know that until you've tried it.|`|nXTDkokuaa	Ask a dozen archery pros for tips on selecting the best bow and you will likely get a dozen different opinions. This can cause frustration in people new to the sport as they try to sift through all the advice to find an archery bow that they can be happy with. To help you with your decision process, we have put together the following tips:<br>  <br>  1. Pick a bow to match your size. Whether you get a traditional bow, compound bow, or some variation in between, pick a bow that fits your draw size and height. There is nothing worse that to get a bow that is ill-suited to your build. It will cause you endless frustration and may lead to you leaving the sport prematurely. The best way to combat this is to go to your local sporting goods store to get your measurements in these areas. This will help save you time and give you peace of mind when buying your bow online.<br>  <br>  2. Opt for a lighter weight initially. The best plan is to pick a bow that is about 10 to 15 pounds lighter than the maximum weight you can handle. This is a good weight to begin learning how to shoot a bow and arrow with and will allow you to shoot more efficiently. As you become a more experienced archer, you can always move up to a higher weight.<br>  <br>  3. Start with an inexpensive bow. There are a ton of nice high end archery bows that can run upwards of $1000. However, it is best for beginners to choose a good basic bow priced under $400. These bows will give you a chance to learn how to shoot and will allow you to appreciate the additional advantages of higher end bows when you make the upgrade to them.<br>  <br>  And if you looking an Archery Equipments i find this site <a href="http://www.archery-discount.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.archery-discount.com/</a>  that might help you when you are planning to get into the Archery|`|5baa06d71b4cee5e338e688d99a2fff7aa	check yahoo/mapquest/yellow pages for a nearby archery range, ask if they offer lessons. Most places will lend you a bow for lessons, and you can rent from them for practice before you figure out one that you want to get for yourself.

Plus half of the guys aready went to combines during there college years.|`|beO40ap7aa	well combines are more for players who can prove that they can enter into the NFL. Combines dont tell everything though, by the time a player is a free agent, their intangibles which the combines dont tell are defined|`|UAHjJpC0aa	I doubt that it would work<br>  <br>  most of the free agents would consider it an insult, to have to "audition" again.|`|ofNVMPd6aa	great idea|`|7078186576934268513c3e942623c173aa	Because these guys have a past for teams to evaluate the need isnt really there. Teams know what a guy has to offer and they have to consider whether or not that guy fits their program and they do communicate amongst eachother as far as the character issues. Plus with coaches on the move all the time it is easy to get an honest opinion of a guys lockerroom habits. Once they decide a guy is worth looking into teams just fly them in for a workout and interview, often teams prefer the privacy of not tipping their hand on free agents hoping to pressure them into signing a deal before they leave town. Plus GMs know if they did have some sort of combine it would bring in agents to play teams against eachother with the threat of....my guy is going to sign with team X if you dont increase your offer now. So the player benefits much more so than the team in that scenario.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I don't know if this is a good idea or not.  Some players seem to be able to get good jobs no matter what their reputation.  T.O. is rumored to have a job with Buffalo for about 6.5 million a year, he got a job in 48 hours.  That is just a rumor  though.

It was an ultra-violent gory spectacle, not a showcase of exceptional wrestling skills.  It was shocking in it's brutality and Foley was damn lucky to be able to walk after it was over with.<br>  <br>  It is the defining match of the "Attitude Era", an over-the-top bloody spectacle that pushed the limits of what Vince McMahon would allow his wrestlers to do in the ring (in fact, after that barbaric display, Vince did tone down what he would allow).<br>  <br>  It was not a wrestling match, it was a gory spotfest.  5-star ratings generally go to matches featuring outstanding wrestling and stellar storytelling, not two guys trying to butcher each other.<br>  <br>  BQ:  The "Attitude Era" was not about wrestling, it was about shocking the fans and pushing the censors.  It served it's purpose (the WWF won the Monday Night Wars against WCW) but it's not needed anymore.<br>  <br>  ECW, however, broke new ground on an almost weekly-basis, giving us new types of characters (based on more realistic ideas) and storylines incorporating real-life situations, match innovations such as the 3-Way Dance and all matches are no-DQ, and audience participation (bring your own weapons for the wrestlers to use on each other).  ECW was not just blood and barbed-wire.  They also featured some of the best pure wrestlers on the planet, and the high-flying luchadores from Mexico.<br>  <br>  Of the two, I would bring back the IDEA of ECW; the innovation it was known for.|`|EZf00NJJaa	Who said it was not a 5 star match ?<br>  <br>  The only rating that should matter is your own .<br>  <br>  It does not matter what other people rate it , what matters is how much YOU liked it .  <br>  <br>  BQ: Would you bring back the original ECW back or bring back the attitude era? explain why<br>  <br>  No .<br>  Their time has passed .<br>  I'm not sure it would work in this era anyway .|`|2QxuKwENaa	Like Hilary said, it's YOUR opinion.

qo0kKtvpaa	I asked a question about this after the Cardinals beat them in the playoffs. He did have one bad game, get over it. He is still a great quarterback and an asset to the Panthers.|`|cdQryr7paa	I don't know why either.<br>  He for the most part was a pretty consistent QB.<br>  He had at least 175 yards passing in 12 out of 16 games and had a QB rating of 84.7.<br>  3,288 passing yards is pretty good on a team that had the dominate running game the Panthers had.<br>  They won 12 games last season, so he must have been doing something right.<br>  NFL fans are a fickle bunch, they tend to only remember the last game a guy plays instead of what he contributed to the whole season.|`|qq1fSV2daa	personally i think he still has a couple more years left in him .. but he's definitely in the decline of his career .. they shouldn't trade him but draft a young QB that can learn from Delhomme for the next couple years|`|rjuqrHK7aa	I don't know either. They will be really upset when they have a QB problem like the Bears and Vikings.|`|GUjr6whNaa	Ungrateful Panther fans<br>  <br>  Delhomme brought u guys to the super bowl did u already forget?<br>  <br>  Panthers are one of my fav teams and they have an above avg qb even when he is in the decline of his career he would still start in most teams around the league but yeah Jkane knows what hes talking about a young draft qb under delhomme's wing would be a good good thing for both the franchise and the player|`|f6JWEBdDaa	Ok...I've been a Panther fan from the start, and never wavered in my support....even through the 1-15 season!! And I'll admit to being really pissed when Jake blew our chances in the playoffs this past season!<br>  <br>  But...the man is a very good quarterback all in all, and we've had much worse than him, (anyone remember Chris Weinke and David Carr.)<br>  And...when Jake and Steve Smith get hot...there's no better combo in the league!<br>  <br>  Still...I do believe that we need to draft a new QB that can learn under Jake's wing during this final year of his contract, and hopefully step right in when Jake's time is up! <br>  <br>  Oh....and we need to get rid of Ken Lucas too! He was just awful during the last half of the season!|`|gq7HZoGRaa	Well i think it really all boils down to him just not being able to get the job done in the playoffs, he took them to the superbowl once and lost to the Patriots, other than that he has been mediocre at best when it comes down to post-season football.|`|QjO3m7QKaa	I don't know it's just like Eagles fans. They want to get rid of their franchise QB. Sad. They don't get that if they don't have a franchise QB they end up like the Vikings.|`|fAMpwF3Aaa	Delhomme is a great QB, anyone who says he should be traded obviously knows nothing about football.|`|luYkDhOraa	cuz im guessing he isn't gonna win a superbowl, and hes very old trade him while they can still get something for him|`|acaAycEXaa	Because they are retards. Jake Rocks!|`|vJ20fTZWaa	cauz he sucks|`|cD5ASE0Zaa	I don't want to. The panthers are the best and they will win this year. I know this because I am the greatest person born. Mabey|`|tzrLDbHWaa	He's not a great QB, he's about average.  Overall his completion percentage is kinda low and he's not the type of QB who's going to win a game for you.  The good thing about him is that he rarely makes mistakes.  That 5 pick game against Arizona was just a really bad game.<br>  <br>  Overall, I don't know why people want him traded.  Like I said, he's not going to win you many games, but he's also the type who's not going to lose the game for you with bad decisions.  Reminds me a lot of Kerry Collins and he just got a contract extension in Tennessee.  While Delhomme wouldn't be my first choice as QB, if they did trade him they would have no good option as starter, and I cant see why someone would want to trade their starter with no other option available to step in.|`|3oUSroiZaa	I think it's because of that injury and the fact that he threw 5 picks in that lost.<br>  <br>  <br>  They need to remember that he took them to a superbowl.<br>  <br>  Edit:Spidey has to be the coolest nickname I've ever been given.
mFtSBujqaa	Yeah pretty much the only way they would get in is if they win the Pac-10 tournament.  I doubt they get picked at-large so they would need to get the automatic bid the winner of the Pac-10 tournament gets.|`|i2NFartOaa	No there out|`|wYdHeAE9aa	if they pay admission
O8lLBrXpaa	Okay.<br>  First of all, my shot used to be curved to. it can be a good tool if you learn to control it, as it is sometimes hard for someone who is a straight shooter to learn to 'bend' a ball.<br>  I found that i used to shoot and have my leg come across my body. that may be your problem. <br>  If so, just go outside and take shots against a wall, and focus on a straight follow-through, with the laces.<br>  <br>  For drills<br>  - dribbling across your yard and back using the inside/outside of one foot only. then switch feet. This will make you feel more comfortable about using both feet<br>  - rolling your foot over the ball. stand sideways over the ball and roll the ball of your foot over the ball. If you're doing this correctly (it's hard for me to explain online) you should be able to travel across your yard and back (Then switch)<br>  - PRACTICE JUGGLING. most people i know hate it, but it helps. You may not use it in a game, but juggling is key if you want to get comfortable with the ball. Juggling is bouncing the ball off of your thighs, head, and feet consecutively. If you practice this a lot, you'll soon find it easier to trap the ball and certain moves will come easier to you.<br>  - sprints across your yard while dribbling with both feet. Because just running is good, but if you can run like heck but have no control of the ball while doing so will get you nowhere. <br>  - utilize your brother. Ask him about wall passes (AKA give and goes) ask him to throw the ball to you to practice headers. also, ask him to throw the ball to you to practice chest, thigh, and foot traps. Ask him to throw you the ball to practice instep volleys.<br>  <br>  any time with the ball at your feet is good time, even if you're watching tv and rolling the ball between your feet. Anything to make you more comfortable and familiar with the way the ball reacts to certain touches. This will help you read the game.<br>  <br>  just stick with it, girl! (:|`|IjV8hlE0aa	Everything can be possible my dear. its good you realize it will be hard for you to be at the level of other girls who have played soccer much earlier. I could just start telling you do this do that... but the wont help you cuz you are beginner what you need to do is Join maybe the soccer club on your school, or a soccer Trainer to teach you the basics, or soccer academy, or someone that really KNOW NOT JUST PLAY IT BUT TO TEACH TOO (he or she could be a good player but Cant really 'teach') so pick up the best you can. I recommend you to be patience when learning because you can get really frustrated when things don't come as you would like. Practice often. <br>  Let me congratulate you for loving soccer is great!|`|zRaRSDy4aa	OK, coming from the captain of the varsity team for 3 years now on the number 16 team in the country. I feel that its great that you wanna work hard and that your passionate, coaches love that.  You should try perfecting your passing by aiming for a spot on a wall and just keep hitting it, you wanna move back farther and farther as you get better.  Shooting, find a net and just work on power at first, just kick the ball as hard as you can at the net, after you can kick it reasonably hard, try aiming the ball in certain spots. (corners prefably). Set up some cones in a line and dribble zig zags in and around them this will give you great ball control. You also have to be knowlegeable of the game, like learn all the rules and tactics. Depending on what position you wan tto play, also, if you wanna play forward, work more on shooting, if you wanna play defence work on stealing the ball and passing, if you wanna play midfield work on passing and ball control and long range shooting. also crossing, work on putiing the ball inside the box from any point on the field.  If you are bored or ssoemthing JUGGLE, ask your bro what that is, JUGGLING will improve your comfortability and touch with the ball and will make you a much MUCH MUCH  better player, trust me. good luck!!

I bought it over a dozen years ago and have never regretted it. I spent months researching different guns, trying them out, and finally had come down to the Kimber, the Para P14 Limited, and an H&K USP. <br>  <br>  The higher capacity of the others was attractive, but a single stack 1911 fit me the best and the Kimber is still the best fitting most natural pointing gun I own. It is also the most bench accurate as well as the most practically accurate.<br>  <br>  The bluing is still perfect and about everything I learned about shooting I learned on that gun. Still have it, still shoot it and it will be the last gun that ever leaves my collection.<br>  <br>  Thinkingblade|`|fUDlbOP0aa	My favorite gun that i own would be between my Marlin 925r and Norinco SKS. <br>  <br>  the Marlin 925r is a curious rifle. its barrel is between a bull/heavy barrel type and a carbine type tapered. it results in superb accuracy but while still being light. it has a polymer stock, not my favorite, but at least its very durable and will not nick, ding, or scratch like wood. its also black so that many people mistake it for some cool super sniper it is not. its a .22LR rifle, and a bolt action. I can fire any cartridge I want in .22S/L/LR, although the .22 short cartridge do not feed reliability. I have a scope on it, Barska 6-32x50mm, which works great for target, plinking, hunting, pest control from far ranges, <br>  <br>  My Norinco SKS is another favorite gun I have. It came poorly maintained and dirty. I cleaned it up, fixed it up some. Now only the stock is still damaged (nicks, dings, scratches). It came complete, with a bayonet, a cleaning rod, matching serials, and cleaning kit in stock. Its just like what a soldier may be issued some where in the world today. It even came with some Norinco ammo with mild steel cores. I haven't fired the ammo, its too valuable to shoot. The carbine came wit ha bad sear, it drops releases the hammer every time a jolt or shock is introduced, such as the bolt slamming all the way forward. This results in full-auto slam firing, a very fun thing to do. Its legal (but dangerous) malfunction, not a modification that would make it illegal. If I can mill down the bolt some I can get it to accept detachable magazines, which would be really cool. <br>  In accuracy its like my WASR10, not great but okay. 2-3 inches at 100 yards at best. the reliability is AK-like. extremely simple basic design, even an idiot could clean it. i have a cool looking compensator on it (slip on rather than pin-on), I would very like to have a screw on type instead, but that may be costly and a bit troublesome wit California law. I'm not sure if threading a rifle muzzle is legal. Even just for a good compensator. Likewise applies to the detachable magazine part- milling the bolt can make it illegal. (but just in California)<br>  Its fun to go to a some empty part of the mountain with friend and practice squeezing off a few rounds full auto-like. the 10 rd magazine capacity is really annoying though.|`|AA11729094	Right now?

xOReEw6Waa	The Stevens is currently selling for about $275 around here, that is no Accu-Trigger or scope. I've seen the Savage-scoped packages at around $400 also. The Howa/Weatherby Vanguard will be around $300 with no scope also. New Marlin XL-7 is pretty good for around $285 locally too. I've seen a lot of rifles on sale for under $400 lately so you need to bring your budget up just a little. <br>  As for best deer cartridge I would lean more towards the 270,30-06, 25-06;then the 308,7mm-08 and the 243. In many states the .243 Win is the minimum caliber allowed for deer because of the energy requirements for a shot at 100 plus yards. With a 243 you need a 90 grain or heavier BONDED style bullet to ensure good penetration. <br>  You always want to look at range and terrain and types of shots you will take. A larger cartridge or bullet gives you a lot more options than a 243 on quartering shots where the 243 isn't going to penetrate as deeply. Below are some cartridge comparisons and game recommendations.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	To go WAY under $300, consider a Mannlicher-Carcano 6.5 mm Italian Army surplus.  They have an undeserved bad reputation, and gun shops will almost pay you to take them.  Ammo is hard to find, but you can reload.<br>  I understand that the Russian Mosin-Nagant rifles in 7.62X54R are also available at insanely low prices.|`|FhuXtF4haa	Matt your responce is stupid. The cartridge that the gun fires is not going to pre determine the price. Most rifles are chambered in several different cartridges and are the same price you just choose which one you want. The company Stevens as some good guns offered in deer calibers for under 300.|`|vsRjnbTfaa	Any used savage will work.  They will be around 300.  Someone already mentioned Stevens.  Stevens is made by Savage and i used to own one and was very impressed with it.  Stevens will be around 300 as well.  A used 30-30 will work very well also provided you keep your range in check.  Look at a gun show if you will be having one near you any time soon.  You never know what you will find at a gun show.  I've come across some GOOD deals at a gun show.|`|oX2KsnOQaa	savage 111 30-06|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	A used 336 Marlin 30-30 win.|`|Es3XXoVsaa	Look into .243's

(Get used to using that other hand for a few days.)<br>  <br>  Ice it to decrease the inflammation.<br>  <br>  Compression also helps to keep down inflammation and minimize stiffness later.<br>  <br>  Elevate it to bring blood down away from the swelling that you do encounter.<br>  <br>  Then, more important, learn from your mistake. Don't do that anymore.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	but in ice water|`|vLD8L1P0aa	Next time use wraps or boxing gloves AND wraps but for now just wrest your hand and let it heal|`|FvtBS9cpaa	the reason you are getting sore wrists is because as you impact the bag or sparring partner your fist and forearm aren't in a straight line so your wrist is "kinking" as you punch. Practice technique before speed or power. Keep the wrist perfectly straight as you impact the bag and the energy produced will travel in a straight line from your shoulder to the impact point.|`|ehQ2XTGxaa	Wrap your hands CORRECTLY.<br>  When you throw a punch do not bend your wrist,even slightly,your arm will get accustomed and it will start bending and it will screw your wrist.<br>  I had the same problem weeks ago and now i'm throwing punches right and i'm getting in the ring more and getting better.
dfBwVxXFaa	it may not help with your accuracy, cause every pistol shoots a little different, but it will help with your form and stance. The better your stance, and form, the better you will shoot.  PRACTICE, PRACTICE!!!!|`|QrjuueMCaa	Absolutely. Getting a nice breathing and trigger-pull habit along with practicing safe pistol practice. Have fun. Learn good habits now and they will last a lifetime.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	yes and no<br>  yes because it will help you get accustomed to shooting a gun and shooting over all- like teaching you patience and how to hold it, etc<br>  <br>  but no because a bb gun doesn't have any recoil like a handgun or a rifle or a shotgun, so that will be something very new to you- either way- when you start shooting a handgun (or rifle or shotgun) start with a small caliber or gauge (gauges are the 'measurement' for shotguns) <br>  <br>  i personally, have shot a bb gun similar to that and i've shot a few handguns before, and it didn't help me much.. really shooting a bb gun hasn't really helped me any with shooting a rifle, or shotgun, or handgun- but that is just me- everyone is different<br>  <br>  have fun (:|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Sure *|`|4mb6xaxBaa	yes, practice is the best thing to get better and bb gun is a cheap way to practice a lot.|`|4BoteYDwaa	It could, if you wear some wrist weights while practicing (about 5 pounds). Hand guns are much heavier than bb guns.|`|9NcOBG8Laa	The weight, the recoil, and the trigger pull on bbguns, both airgun and airsoft, is completly wack, and unapplicable to a real firearm.<br>  <br>  Advantageously, they are usually SHAPED alot like real firearms, allowing you to work on hand-positioning.<br>  <br>  Beyond that? You might as well be holding a banana.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	Oh, yes!<br>  <br>  The secrets of good shooting are sight picture, and trigger control.  Your BB gun, or any other BB/pellet/soft air/paintball gun will help develop those two skills: getting, and holding the proper sight picture, and trigger control - achieving that surprise shot!|`|a7758985bc328f86aea63a86e0cd5cfdaa	Yes.<br>  Maintaining sight picture , stance, breathing etc will all translate into "real" handgun accuracy.<br>  Basic elements never change but you will have to adjust for  weight, & recoil the way shooters do when switching between guns of different caliber.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	Yes, every shooter wannabee should start with and air gun.

DLxh9CANaa	Because these games were intended to be a showcase of Hitler's theories of how well a so called "master race" could perform in athletic competition, and instead, they turned out to be the breeding ground for a great American hero who just happened to be of African descent, that's why. Hitler ended up being publically embarrassed at these Games, and rightly so. The rest of the world thumbed its nose at him and his arrogant Aryan athletes, and gave them the finger- all the while pretending they knew nothing about what Hitler was already doing to Germany's Jews at that time. <br>  <br>  As for the supposed controversy in the sport of Eventing, at that time, the only competitors in the sport were army officers from various countries. Women were excluded, and would be so for the next thirty plus years, until after the second World War was fought. Once the great cavalries of the world became mechanized and horses became obsolete as a means of military transport, someone came up with the bright idea of opening the horse sports to women- and history was made in 1952. It's only TOO LIKELY that the Germans had prior knowledge of the problem on the XC course in the Berlin games, and used this to their advantage- at everyone else's expense, might I add. But with world opinion and sentiment running so high at that time, no one even dared suggest anything was wrong, because the consequences of doing so would have been very grave indeed. <br>  <br>  The 1936 Olympic Games were perhaps the most politically charged in history- no other Olympiad has faced the kinds of pressures that this one did. Even with the boycotts during the 80's, nobody else has had to deal with what Germany faced.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	It'll most be remembered for Jesse Owens dominating the track and field events during implementation of Hitler's eugenics policies.<br>  <br>  It was pretty much a big F U to Adolf.|`|dbRfQVpXaa	The 1936 Olympics produced controversial results, with the Germans winning all 6 gold medals, the only time in Olympic history where one team has made a clean sweep. There were protests from all 18 teams at the Games. One incident occurred on the cross-country course in the eventing competition, where the 4th fence, a 3 ft post-and-rail dropping into a pond, produced a great number of falls. The landing was much deeper than anticipated and the footing underneath did not hold up well. However, all of the German team members made it through without a problem, suggesting that the host team might have known the true condition of the obstacle

AA10958272	YES.<br>  <br>  The BILLS have a much easier schedule. The Cowboys play the Giants, Skins, Eagles in their own division, just to start.  The Cowboys are in turmoil now.  The Bills are solid.  Keep your prejudices to yourself (those who'd thumb this down, and get ready to eat your HAT). <br>  <br>  It doesn't matter what ESPN or many others in the tank for the NFL/Cowboys promotion says -- Romo is a choke artist and T.O. MADE his career, at that so far.  Terrell Owens is routinely discredited by the NFL/media complex (mostly all white, all frat boy types) but he is..<br>  <br>  -a FIRST BALLOT Hall of Famer<br>  -in great condition<br>  -a world class athlete that showed he could play in the NBA over their all-star weekend<br>  -adds another SOLID weapon to the Bills offense<br>  <br>  Try and tear into this guy all you will... he's LED THE NFL over the las 3 years in TD passes. He's a difference maker. If the Bills ever get their QB situation squared -- they now have 3 mega-WRs, and much the same way that Arizona surprised, so can the Bills.<br>  <br>  The Jets, Dolphins, Pats are NOT powerhouse teams. Steelers, sure. Colts, OK. But, then there's a drop-off. SD Chargers are done. Ravens are crippled because of Free Agency. Don't laugh at what the Bills have just done, in giving T.O. a launching pad.<br>  <br>  GL Bills.<br>  (from a NY Giants fan)|`|hNZ3wflHaa	nope|`|48c83727f449473c97be31a3baff4f99aa	No|`|7078186576934268513c3e942623c173aa	Not likely....it is a pretty easy assumption  that TO will destroy what little confidence Edwards had left the first time he isnt happy that the offense didnt funnel through him. Keep in mind this is the same guy who complained horribly after a Boys game about not being included....after Romo threw 18 passes his way one game. He dropped a couple, didnt run through routes on a couple, didnt make the effort expected to reach for a couple and he also told the media "look at the tapes, what am I supposed to do?". How about catch the ball and shut your mouth...just an idea. No, I dont see good things when you put a young QB with such a mental case who is only concerned about "me". Trent had a bad game last year and lost his confidence the rest of the year, I dont see how signing TO will help his confidence (great tools receiver, of course but football is much more than talent alone).|`|FKeh9kYUaa	Haha you serious?

Km9QC8a9aa	What is most needed is to know the immediate circumstances under which one contemplates delivering a punch.|`|hlqj0pvxaa	It is not one thing or the other that make a technique effective. <br>  <br>  It is form, but also intention, alignment, breath, relaxation - rooting and body mechanics.<br>  <br>  I see all the questions asked on here on how to have a powerful punch, etc.<br>  <br>  All those who have little or no experience in martial arts give suggestions on how many pushups and how many pounds to press - THIS IS NONSENSE!<br>  <br>  Pushups and weight training have nothing to do with developing punching power. <br>  <br>  It is Body Mechanics!|`|uE2aOqeNaa	Well if you have one with out the other the punch is worthless any ways. If you have the technique but are scared to hit them they your going to miss and get screwed. If you want to hit them and do not know how then it does not matter. How ever people do get knocked out on the streets all of the time by people who have no technique but have intent<br>  <br>  Now it is muscles that make body mechanics work. So if you have strengthened the whole body correctly and do the technique right then you will hit harder than some one who hits the same way but is weaker.|`|uBrTu7OBaa	The spirit behind the punch matters just as much as the technique behind of it.
fn1sKCT0aa	Do you have carl edwards or kyle busch? if you do I would put one of them in.|`|3e1ELOgnaa	I know you would have better guys in if you could but since there is a cap..........Keep gordon and smoke for sure, take Jr out and put in Kenseth or Clint Bowyer, or both if you can somehow. You might have to pick someone a little lower on the chain such as a Menard to do so but I think you would be pleased with your results.|`|gC8NFODSaa	I agree somewhat will Gordon Fan<br>  Labonte, while I would love to see him continue his success, I doubt he can follow up his run from last week with another good run.<br>  Jr. needs to come out of your team. Wait until he gets his head back in the game, wherever it is, and then you can start including him again.<br>  I think Reutimann will have another good top ten run but you would have a better chance with Edwards, Kyle Busch, Johnson, and I think even Kurt Busch (you are blue deuce after all). If you don't have these drivers, I would consider David Ragan, Greg Biffle, or Mark Martin. If you still don't have any of these, then I think your choices were good after all.|`|IRbkrJUWaa	Take out Jr, Smoke, Reutimann, Labonte...  <br>  <br>  and think Regulars.. always.. because, honestly, and this is the simply truth.. the regulars always win.. no new guys comes in and WHAMMO wins.. won't happened, hasn't happened in a long time... <br>  <br>  So Labonte and Reutimann, no chance.. even with their success last week..<br>  <br>  Jr... not ready, never was the last 2 years.. needs something new, a crew chief maybe?<br>  <br>  Stewart... too early for him, he needs more time..<br>  <br>  Put in Edwards, Busch, Johnson.. you made such a big mistake?<br>  I wonder why you didn't put them in there.. of ALL people.. <br>  <br>  So put them... also Jeff Burton.. he might have something for everybody..<br>  <br>  Most importantly, Jeff Gordon is a good choice.. especially seeing as he has had the best car out of ALL of them the last 3 weeks.. on average..|`|TCsrpf2Xaa	replace labonte and reutimann with edwards and kyle

You guys need a WR and you need offense.  T.O. is relatively a low risk high reward player, since he's really not going to go psycho his first year in a city, he never has before.  Its only a one year contract and worst case scenario, you don't resign him, there's really no bad side here.  Not to mention, Trent Edwards really isn't a bad QB, considering what he's done with no good WRs.  T.O. will make a difference.<br>  <br>  The whole Toronto game is a stupid idea.  Like you said, you lose the weather advantage playing in a dome, so of all teams, you don't pick Miami, who's used to playing in sunny Miami to give them a break.  If you want to play a game in Canada, fine, but play someone who's used to the cold anyway, like the Jets or Patroits, so you don't lose much.|`|UgnMjtYDaa	A one year deal 6 and change.... cant go wrong there. Well worth the risk. It's only a year and I feel he'll probably play better and conduct himself classier with only a one year deal. If I'd of thought he was signing one year deals for that money I would have loved him down in miami. We could of actually done something.|`|43daa72d6abd58775d0e46a24824eddeaa	the guy has been on three teams that boast winning records and play-offs with him on the team...when he plays football w's is all that matter. and y'all need the w's idiot! it ain't like the bills cant use all the help they sorry asses can get...don't cheer when he scores td's..boo like the moron you are.....lol|`|yuGhmhGuaa	On behalf of Bills fans everywhere, Glad to see you go!|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Try not to lose hope for your team. But you can if it gets really bad. I lost hope in the Steelers when they had Mark Malone as Q.B. and just kept him in there.<br>  <br>  Hopefully what will happen with T.O. is that they are explicit with behavior clauses in his contract. That is an issue. He is a loose cannon and unprofessional but is a good football player. He lost his temper this year, when Dallas played the Steelers on the sidelines. They televised that too which probably partially led to his demise there. I say give it a chance, imo. Cheer the guy. Why not try it?<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'll leave you with some comedy: When Mark Malone was quarterback for the Steelers, people booed him everytime he came on the field, and gave him the middle finger. And he used to give it back to the fans every chance he could. It was really nasty. Back then, he was allowed to. There were no fines or discipline for that. Today you can't do that. I attended a bad game against the Redskins when the Steelers were losing badly. The "booing" was almost deafening, when our own quarterback came on the field. And he would play, and then leave the field with his head down giving everyone the middle finger.<br>  <br>  Think about that!!!|`|khqWGKU9aa	10 td's and 1000 yards. Are you saying you would not want to have that? As a bills fan i went crazy when i heard this. The bills only had Lee Evans, no Trent wont have to throw into double coverage and have those int's. And T.O the first year will be caring about Wins, and i see the Bills now becoming a wildcard team. 7 and 9 last year with Edwards shaky the 2nd half.  The bills need points, and T.O is a threat every time.|`|mFtSBujqaa	They suck.  That's what they are thinking (and more likely knowing).  They're just hoping to make the playoffs and with a healthy and motivated TO they have a much better chance at doing that.  Edwards looked promising before the concussion, now they just have to hope he continues his development.|`|XKtOUTfJaa	they're thinking they need another wr to take some pressure off of lee evans. yes there is a lot of drama surrounding him but hes very talented. their also thinkin this might get some more fans to the games and will probably get them some more prime time or monday night games. its only for one year. typically TO can behave himself for one year.|`|O1tiemu0aa	well the only teams interested were OAK SF and BUF, they have the best chance of the three to go anywhere next year but it dosnt matter he will complain when Lee Evans gets more receptions than him|`|bIbyAkHPaa	is T.O. now a song?|`|xxtvhn5Naa	I agree... notice how it was only a 1 year deal, so if things go bad, they can let him go fast.|`|HpBKn35Caa	well t.o is coming to buffalo yay|`|cpTh1QRfaa	its pretty simple really. TO was never gonna go to a good team. (i mean currently, not like the bills are a bad organization in general) Any decent team was not gonna risk bringing in a guy that could potentially ruin the clubhouse. so the only teams he was gonna go to were ones hoping for some sort of spark. <br>      <br>      and so from the bills point of view, they really didnt have anything to lose. they cant be much better without him. its only a one year deal, and they desperately need someone to take the pressure off of lee evans. and so if he sucks this year, that'll just be it. he's gone.<br>      <br>       i don't really see them risking that much in bringing him in.

If you are living in the city limits of one of the big cities, go talk to your local gun shops to find out.<br>  <br>  As a general idea, go talk to your gun shops just on general principal. Find a shop that has people you like, and become a steady client.<br>  <br>  The final thing is, why a Glock. The cops use them to limit lawsuits, but for personal use I hate their trigger. The pull is long and heavy.<br>  <br>  The Glock is always fired from what amounts to a Double Action pull, where you are cocking the hammer with the trigger for each shot. As I said, the police departments like this because it makes it hard for the officer to discharge his gun without intending to do so. That cuts down on liability in lawsuits. For an individual on, why would you want a lousy trigger pull for every shot? I would check out the S&W autos with their double and single action trigger. Or better yet, go get a 1911A1 in 45ACP, and learn how to work a single action only auto.|`|9Djep77Vaa	Ask a local gun shop. When you pass the requirements, there you go!

EdOzbvAVaa	probaly but why dont you just go outside and run|`|GmTs1BB1aa	it can't make it worse.|`|TRrTunqvaa	why dont you just improv your running by running for real?|`|mBXu5G5saa	well you are not actually running, you are just walk really fast in place, i have one too and i do it once in a while but i would rather go to the park and do 5-10 laps around the field and be satisfied, than to just walk in place, what the wii free running does is just burn calories, (you get tired fast) so it is better to do exercises by yourself than depending on the wii to help you improve any fitness problem!|`|FkunZ9q4aa	It might boost your stamina but the real thing is always better.  Not to mention a heck of a lot cheaper...  Doing 10-20 minutes a day isn't going to hurt your running, but it's probably not going to make you any faster because you're not actually moving forward.|`|Kdr9CRbqaa	no. it's extremely different when u run on pavement rather than in ur house. u get tired more easily when u run outside... i workout on a teadmill, but it feels different when i run outside.|`|o3E0aoIjaa	Of course NOOOOOOOOOOOOO you have to run  for that.|`|UzMcNOCRaa	it could , <br>  if you ran around your house with it. <br>  since the wii picks it up when your in other places, <br>  it makes it less boring because your not running in the same spot.|`|hORVMOHKaa	i love the WII fit although i was already in good shape before i got it, but any kind of running even if its running in place will improve your running|`|68a61b5dac67c3eb2655a1e0f6fdfc3baa	From my experience, not really...<br>  It helped me run the same amount of time without almost having a stroke afterwards, but It didn't help my actual running.

UoT86gbiaa	Yeah, you already asked about the other one.<br>  Here's the short answer: don't trade Hanley Ramirez.  Especially with A-Rod out, he's the best player in fantasy.  <br>  If you were offered Pujols and a second-tier SS (maybe Furcal), then consider it, but even then it's a questionable proposition.  Don't entertain any trade that doesn't offer Pujols.  Hanley's an outstanding fantasy commodity, and you can't deal him without getting unquestionable value on the other side.|`|AA11720887	Decline them both. Your outfield is weak and you have no closers. You have too many starting pitchers to look at trading some of them. Surely there are free agents better than your outfield.|`|rYqBGkwjaa	Actually the first trade may be great to do.  I know people may disagree with me, BUT Sizemore is the ONLY threat on the Indians.  He is a great player, and tries his hardest day in and day out.  He can hit, he can field, and barely gets errors.  But those other 3 guys could ruin the trade for you.  Try to get more.  Sizemore and another great player for Just Ramirez.  That would be a much better trade for you.<br>  <br>  Hey check out my question.  The question is "Who is looking for a fun sports website with Great Games, such as Sim Leagues and Re-Drafts on it?"|`|eFQXl7uyaa	After seeing the rest of your roster I can see why you are getting these offers. You are being punked. You went too heavy on pitching and have no offense. These offers are using your desparation to create on offense - they leave you the same on offense while stealing your pitching. And what's worse you have pitching problems. You need to shop Chris Young for a 3B.|`|04bc2c48d79f30c010ba500a390cb62daa	I would do the Peavy trade before i would do the Sizemore trade|`|M6uIbKXRaa	i think its the worst trade ever i mean why would you even ask|`|YkXKPsUsaa	Yes, that's a great trade!
eFQXl7uyaa	This is actually one of the most interesting trade offers I have seen all year. There is really no downside on the surface. The guy getting Han Ram is looking for a little more power and there is slight advantage to Haren in whip and his KO's have gone up. I would do this trade for this reason; Han Ram steals bases and hits for power which makes him an asset in multiple categories, Reyes hits for a little power but for the same reason he is in the top 5. I feel HanRam is due for a little slump because he has started to focus on power and his BA is going to drop. That will hurt his other stats. Reyes may move to the number 3 spot in the batting order which may not produce as many SB's reducing his value overall. I also don't think that will last whereas HanRam showing a little power is more of mental problem and will last all season. That's a trade of what you need - I would still go with Reyes to top steals this year between the two and HanRam to top HR's but with 10-20 lower on BA. That leaves Haren and Peavy - This is almost a wash even though Peavy's offense is so much worse. Given the choice I may actually go Peavy on this one anyway. Not because he is that much better but because he may be in a better position in the rotation and the home field he has to work with. I really depends on which stats you need though - If I needed a good WHIP guy, I might lean a little to Haren on this one. The Ian Stewart thing is interesting because he does have a lot of upside and is a good 2B option but I also think Colorado screwed up on Barmes and aren't giving him a chance. He hit the bench after hitting .330 for a half a seaon after dropping the groceries and breaking his colarbone. They haven't really let him play since - I would really like to see him get traded to a team that will let him play. And maybe that's what the Rockies want, a little value. If they can do that early Stewart could be a good pickup.<br>  <br>  I like the trade - I would do it. You get even for even and a prospect to watch.|`|KKCMIE04aa	Ramirez looked awful today in the worlds<br>  Peavy was shakey<br>  Pudge and Youk were killers<br>  The angel setup man stunk<br>  <br>  Hanley looked overweight and slow|`|AA11720887	Stewart is a good free agent. You can find him available in most leagues. So your deal is really about two for two. I don't see making the deal unless you need the stolen bases over the home runs you are giving up. I have seen some pretty good teams that have very few stolen bases. It's just another category to get points. Home runs give you runs, rbi's, hr's and batting averages. I wouldn't take the deal but I haven't seen the rest of your roster.|`|JGxT8L1Aaa	What a great trade - I would probably accept. If you go roughly by last year's numbers, Reyes' average was only a little lower (.297 compared to Hanley's .301), and has more speed on the bases (56 SB compared to 35). Don't accept the trade if you need Hanley's power, though - a lineup change to 3rd in the order will net him more RBIs than last year's 67, and his OBP is increasing as well. When all is said and done, you'll have one of the two top SS in the MLB. As for the other players, this is where the deal gets better for you. Haren was great last year but Peavy is amazing EVERY year. Ian Stewart also looks to be on the up and up, and he can always pad your stats or be trade bait.|`|UoT86gbiaa	Haren and Peavy are pretty comparable; call those two a wash.  Ian Stewart is a questionable fantasy own in a vast majority of formats, and the hit you take from Hanley to Reyes is in no way worth it.  Don't do it.|`|YzxTweFWaa	too risky <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Akzm5roBVZR7b030rSovlCjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307200843AAuqIjg">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|dhmk7MJtaa	who cares

An ill eagle is a sick bird that can send you to prison for a long time.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Yup, people do it all the time.  The problem is that a lot of arenas have went to a barcoded ticket system where they scan a ticket, and it would come up on their system if its fake or not.  It also helps for people who print out online tickets, so that way a person can't make copies and have multiple people use the same ticket.<br>  <br>  Generally fake tickets are used moreso as a scam than to actually get into the game.  Some scalpers can try to sell the fake tickets and whatever they get for them would be pure profit, and they'll be long gone by the time the buyers find out the tickets aren't real.|`|yt05KPhBaa	Yup.|`|piZ4xDBqaa	You can make a fake anything.  However, the likelihood of your fake tickets actually working to get you into a game are almost nonexistent.

DHIudHy2aa	Read the above, but forget all the shotgun stuff they said. You can also have over-bored rifles, like the Lee-enfield for example. It is actually bored to take a .310 shell, but you are supposed to shoot .303 out of it.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	it means the barrel of a shotgun is larger then it's supposed to be, purposely.<br>  like a 12 gauge shotgun using 12 gauge shells, but the barrel is bored to 10 gauge, supposedly to help with the patterning of the pellets?<br>  idk, kind of a weird idea.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Like the guy above stated, the barrel is a little bit bigger diameter than traditionally used.  It does two things.  First, it makes a shotgun pattern better.  Second, it reduces recoil.  It seems like it would hurt your velocity, but I've never heard anyone complain of that.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	Also referred to as back boring<br>  <br>  it is the practice of making shotgun bore larger than spec<br>  <br>  Some believe that it improves patterning and reduces recoil<br>  most do not<br>  <br>  Either that or it's a shot out barrel whose rifling is gone and the bore is larger than spec<br>  <br>  Either way it is a larger diameter bore than spec|`|xR7LmmyOaa	It means the inside diameter (the "bore") of the barrel is larger than the standard bore for the caliber of ammunition the gun takes.

rW4bt6ZAaa	Make sure that you eat breakfast, as that will help get your metabolism going. Just eat something like a bagel and a cup of orange juice. As the day progresses, try drinking an equate or something else that can fill in as a between meal snack.<br>  <br>  Don't stop eating. If you stop eating, you'll cut off your metabolism and that won't help you at all.<br>  <br>  For anyone asking how this is a wrestling question:<br>  I'm fairly certain that he is trying to drop weight because he is a wrestler for his school going to state.|`|iOICjcZcaa	Recent research has found that it's not really how MUCH you eat, but it's what you're actually eating.<br>  <br>  Start cutting majorly processed foods out of your diet. If it's got a lot of fat, sodium, sugar, or calories, it's best to not eat it.<br>  <br>  Don't eat candy, donuts, McDonald's, etc. Cut out soda of any kind. Drink a LOT of water. Water actually helps fill your stomach when you're hunger, but it's not a complete substitute for food.<br>  <br>  Eat fruits, vegetables, and meat. [Preferably turkey, because beef is fattening.]<br>  <br>  If you exercise, don't eat for FOUR hours after you're finished exercising. Your body continues to burn calories for four hours after you exercise, and if you eat even one crumb of bread, you'll stop burning calories.|`|Gr7My8FTaa	ur in the wrong section dude|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	1) eat oats: they expand in your stomach and make you feel full.<br>  2) eat a lot of celery and carrot sticks.

MxHIdyVAaa	products that supply whey protein are not evaluated by the Food & Drug Administration.  I recommend researching a brand before buying some $30 bucket of protein shake powder.<br>  I'm not saying that because i think it will be bad for you, necessarily.  I'm saying that because another $30 might be the difference in buying something that's half enriched flour and nes-quick mix.<br>  Your a young still developing individual so introducing mass quantities of protein into your diet does pose a slight health risk.  If you wish to take this sort of approach you must do so in a mature manor.  i.e. Correct doses of whey in contrast with a professional-esq. work-out regiment.<br>  To be honest with you, given your height and weight, building lean muscle should not be a hard task for you.  As you body continues to mature (puberty) you shouldn't really need any substances to build muscle and speed.  Your young, you still live with your mother, just ask her to buy you a bunch of frozen chicken.  Broil a chicken breast every night and after each work out have two glasses of chocolate milk.  Whey protein won't have a steroid like affect on your body.  The protein merely nourishes your muscles after each work-out.  At your age hormones and protein are surfing through your veins.<br>  Good luck.<br>  ___________________________<br>  I just read a recent question of yours.  Actually, walking/running on the balls of you feet WILL make you faster.  This is a technique i've been instructed to use in the gym.  But, i had a knee operation in December and probably will never be able to run on a treadmill again.  It's strickly eliptical for me nowadays.<br>  Anyways, back to what i was saying.  All athletes are trained from a young age to utilize a similar stance.  That being kneeds slightly bent, back at about a 70 degree angle, shoulders and elbows square with your hips and your knees, and feet on your toes.  This stance is what we learned to refer to in wrestling as "resting" .<br>  In sports you will always hear "practice how you play".  So, it would only make sense that if you start achieving a better time on a treadmill running with your heels off the ground, it will only translate in to a faster speed on the field.  Standing on your toes will provide you with your best balance & agility, while working out like this will utilize the most of your calfs; including higher & deeper muscle.  Squating & working out your quad muscles will be very important as well.<br>  But, to conclude, running in a straight line and building leg muscle is not going to make you fast on a football field.  Players like Marvin Harrison were once considered some of the fasted, most feared players on the field.  This is due to their ability to spring in different direction, while maintaining a neutral "resting-stance look" .  A good thing to use in your work out 2-3 times a week:  Run about two miles, work out your legs, and then find some real open space.  Take a 3-point-stance, fire up, and sprint about 10 yards in your 5 different basic directings (West, North-West, North, North-East, East) .  Do this until your legs are completely exhausted at least once a week.<br>  Other good exercises are suicides and running, then every 10 yards changing directions 90 degrees without slowing down as much as possible.|`|wwRbkCMraa	yes, this is a fantastic time to take advantage of your bodies surging hormones!  Make sure you use a pure whey protein with No artificial Sweeteners, No artificial Flavors, No artificial Fillers etc.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.buybulkwhey.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.buybulkwhey.com/</a><br>  <br>  These guys sell the highest quality and best priced pure whey protein.|`|SqgXLLnwaa	That guy has no idea what he's talking about.

But Michael, this is very important: do not bulk up too much with weights. What will happen is, at your age, it WILL affect your bone development. Talk to your doctor he will tell you the same thing. Don't try to get all bulky b/c you can have problems later in life. Major problems such as premature arthritis. Ok?

2SSD6BP9aa	You really should be more concerned with the protection you get from the cup then how it looks.  <br>  <br>  If it seems like there's extra space in there, then that's a good thing!  The whole point of a jock/cup combo is that the cloth from the back of the cup pocket holds your junk back from the inside of the cup itself.  Your junk should not be up against the cup, because a solid hit to the cup will carry the shock of the impact right through to your nuts.<br>  <br>  The greater the gap between the cup and your nuts, the more of a cushion you will have if you take a hit there.  Going to a smaller cup that fits you more tightly will give you less protection.<br>  <br>  Is it worth the trade-off to have a smaller bulge down there?  I mean how bad is it anyway?  Don't the other guys on your team have similar bulges from their cups?|`|48c83727f449473c97be31a3baff4f99aa	Yes<br>  Yes|`|mOwznDfaaa	Anything that holds a 'nutty buddy' or 'banana cup' would be better as those are long and slimmer than a typical cup which is what causes the big bulge.  I completely agree with you on that one as I've gotten rid of my old jock with the standard cup and gone for the slimmer hard cup for the same reason.  You may have to go online to buy one as most sporting goods stores only carry the standard jock/cup.|`|r84dPhmLaa	The old style cups are flatter and less noticeable.

gUMucKOkaa	I am answering from what I know in Yahoo. Try playing a public H2H league to get a feel for it. You can have daily lineups, same scoring categories, free agent, waiver rules, all the same as in roto.<br>  <br>  I have and do play both. I like the H2H better though in a one week contest anything can happen, particularly true in the playoffs.<br>  <br>  It does require a different strategy. Streaming of pitchers to win the counting pitcher stats is common, but that can be controlled. For example, we limit the number of free agent pickups to 40 per half season. Using k/9 instead of k is another way.<br>  <br>  Again, you may want to play a league before you convert.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|9fe84f36f98810f1f9585b773366babdaa	what i love about rotisserie is that its the most fair way 2 measure the best team. head 2 head involves a lot of luck, and the best team doesnt necessarily win it. in some ways, its a lot easier 2 win head 2 head leagues b/c as long as u win more categories than ur opponent, ur set. for instance, if i just draft pitchers and ppl who will steal bases, i'll probably win every week, b/c ill win all the pitching categories, as well as SB. that makes head2head a little more fun sometimes

Evans has faster hands than Rampage and with as much power as Rampage! Rashad has the better wrestling and is more powerfull and explosive.

d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	They are the only Japanese 230's on the market. Your choice is basically between those two models unless you move up to a 250. I prefer the CRF but they are very close. I don't think the CRF is better, it was just more comfortable for my body type and riding position. The CRF250X would be a much better performing bike, but you need to be at least 5'7" to fit on it comfortably and it costs about $3000 more. Both 230's are excellent bikes, just not intended for racing or real hard core woods riding.|`|QnsUZbDYaa	My recommendation would be to get a crf250x or a wr250. They will last you forever, they have race engines, WAY better shocks, and they are overall better bikes then the 230. But if you really want a 230 because its less expensive then get the crf230 my step dad has had it for 3 years and NEVER a problem. I hoppe this helped your decision. Jeremy|`|OrM5Xrnoaa	I use to own a crf230 and it was a pretty reliable bike, but i would recomend getting a 250cc bike instead because once you ride the 230 for a while you will get tired of it and want to move up to a bigger bike. Besides you will be able to ride a 250cc forever.|`|FeZNtAN2aa	ive rode both and i liked the TT-R better i would suggest that

dfBwVxXFaa	I didn't see what color the laser is, but if want something with good visibility in the day light, go with a green laser. It is much more visible than red during the day.  Both are visible, but green is better.|`|It2jlZXmaa	G'day mate,if i was you i would stay away from the laser scopes,don't even mount it to yr rifle scope.Laser scope works better if it is very close to the barrel because a lot of lasers don't have enough torrent adjustment.laser is only good for close range shooting during the day but if you shoot it at night you would have to re a just the torrents.If i was you id go for a red dot scope,red dot scope would be better then a laser.My experience i have had with a laser is close range dot isn't always easy to see you always have to look for it in the day shoots. but at night it is much easier to see it.So i got a red dot scope and now i cant go wrong with it.cheers mate|`|dpSr0icwaa	green is more visible<br>  <br>  however, no laser is very visible beyond spitting distance in bright daylight.<br>  <br>  further, a laser really doesn't do any good if you don't have good marksmanship to begin with, because what ruins marksmanship for most shooters is they can't keep the sights aligned because they don't have proper grip and stance, or they have movement in their hands/arms at the very last second just as they shoot the gun.

Y4mz8BShaa	150 sounds right.<br>  Please don't buy the piece of ****. That's all it really is, it should be melted down.<br>  There's only one quality AEP on the market, the CM030.<br>  <a href="http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.php?products_id=2074" rel="nofollow">http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...</a><br>  <br>  Don't use eBay for airsoft guns. If the item you find isn't trash, the retailer selling it is.|`|3r0dgtdSaa	I've bought those before, they hav very little, about 150 with .12 bbs. We use them for fun backyard/basement battles. They dont hurt or anything, cant be used agaisnt serious guns. A spring pistol is usually faster than that. They also break very easily, cheapily made. I would not reccomend, for 20 bucks you should get either a Electric revolver without the cheap blowback or a spring rifle/pistol. I can send you links if u'd like. You can get those at airsoft1.com for about 5 bucks each.

mMFJrPbvaa	Osprey, Gregory, Mountain Hardwear, Go-Lite and Arc`teryx all make good packs.  I`d go with something light weight but that can hold about 30-40lbs.<br>  <br>  You can buy a water proof backpack, waterproof your pack with a spray or wash in product, or you can just buy a pack cover.  All 3 are viable options.|`|qyATAaeXaa	If you can't find the corporate website for any article of gear, then don't buy it. Thus is the case here. If you buy something from Osprey, Kelty, Gregory, GoLite, Mountainsmith, etc. etc. at least you can find a dealer for those packs somewhere along the trail. If something happens to that Cuscus pack...where are you gonna get it serviced? Last I looked Cuscus wasn't sending gear reps to Trail Days and I don't think Amazon.com and Bizrate.com have stores in trail towns.|`|xwEEfzY7aa	No, that looks like it would fall apart pretty quick on the AT--BeachBum818 is right..............|`|LjqoMHMJaa	The Osprey Atmos 65 is a great pack. I took it to Philmont this summer and it didn't cause any back/legs problems. It holds a lot of gear. I'd take that if I were you.

7JEWBeEjaa	I like Pujols over Wright because he is consistent in the long run.|`|cCIQdtlmaa	I'd definitely go Wright because he is a 5 category player and Pujols already said if he comes close to the pain he had last year, he is going to shut it down for the season.

I doubt it, as they are American. Having flicked through them in a bookshop, the best that can be done with them is to use them of Bonfire Night.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	The second test in S.Africa.

9KaPcyXqaa	depends where you live, go with the most popular probably soccer if you like them the same because you will be able to meet more people that way, but if you feel diff. about the two pick the one thats the most fun
tgROmqffaa	normally if you can get a membership to the shooting range you can shoot there.  Normally you can't get a membership unless you are sixteen.  If your not your parents can get one and then you can shoot under their supervision without a membership.  Thats how it works at my shooting range and I assume thats how it works at most.

syzMIfLLaa	a lot of experts give advise on this now because everyone wants to raise the next tiger.  They tend to say that you need to let the child develop a swing, then find a pro who will supervise them, with out trying to mold them into swinging a specific way.  Cookie cutter swings don't create great players.  They need to form habits, a repeating swing, learn to putt a little, then have a pro help them discover the best way for them to play the game.  Regaurdless to age, I would get the kid some clubs that fit, let them hit at the range and chip in the yard, learn to putt a little, and then and only then interview a few pros and find one who will agree to help them discover golf rather than try to mold their swing.  When is the time to start lessons?  when the child can hit similar shots repeatingly.|`|folnUuzraa	As soon as they can walk and by the time there 20 they will either hate it or love it so if they dont want to play just force them to|`|JSGLKnA4aa	you teach a child if they want to learn. don't force them to learn for you but allow them to learn for them selves.
8bTder08aa	I Want Revenge.  This sends I Want Revenge's Derby stock up;  prior to the Gotham, he'd never won outside of California and never won on dirt (as opposed to synthetic surface).  A lot of pundits wanted to see him win on dirt and outside California before they would count him as a legitimate Derby prospect.  Well, evidently he's "for real," at least as far as the field he beat in the Gotham is concerned.  <br>  <br>  The horse that finished second, Imperial Council, came from 8th to finish second, although a long way (8-1/2 lengths) behind the winner.  Imperial Council is by Empire Maker, and so has legitimate basis to get better at longer distances.<br>  <br>  I Want Revenge is by Stephen Got Even, and A.P. Indy son who has gotten some nice horses.  Good performance by a legitimate Derby contender.  Just hope he isn't peaking too early.|`|lTeXIjpOaa	i want revenge, he ran a great race, stayed at the front the whole race then joe talamo pulled him away at the end, he won by probably three strides, pretty good for the jockey or horse never having ridden on that track before|`|A5ypQeqwaa	i want revenge, he romped, and he will run in the Wood Memorial next time.|`|9to0vRbhaa	i want revenge
Y4mz8BShaa	Sounds like the O-ring at the fill valve is broken or deteriorated.
Y4mz8BShaa	MAGAZINE. You're not using a clip.<br>  <br>  It could be a feeding issue, it may be jammed, there may be problems with the internals. I wouldn't recommend opening it up to due to your lack of experience, but if you can find a tech, take it to him/her.|`|Y2VYcoboaa	the spring in the clip might not be loading the bb into the chamber|`|5x5Bpq2Saa	First of all...How did you get an airsoft gun to shoot bullets!? Thats amazing! I wish I could do that.  If only if only...<br>  <br>  And like Dmitri said:  I really don't think you are storing your BBs/bullets (whatever it is your shoving in that gun) in a clip.  And if you are, then I doubt you have a clip fed M4 Carbine.  But hey, who knows.<br>  <br>  And I would bet that your gun is very simply jammed.  And it doesn't help that you keep firing it, which only makes it worse.  NEVER keep firing your gun after you find out BBs are not coming out.  That my friend is a sign that something is wrong|`|EBaFsz9gaa	i would say bb jam sometimes there pretty bad and you have to realy try too get the bb out but you most likely already tried<br>  <br>  it can also be the clip
