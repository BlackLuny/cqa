IP2suWFTaa	You really haven't been there long enough for them to get to know you.They might be life long friends or have known each other for a long time and are in the same routine every day.Sometimes it takes people a while to get used to change.I am a supervisor for a cleaning company and had to hire a new girl six months ago.I was used to working with another woman for four years,but unfortunately she had to quit.It took me and the new employee quite a while to get used to working with each other.Just give it some more time and they will come around and get used to the fact that you are part of the team.|`|0bjQfb01aa	If you've only been there for a few months, they're still probably getting to know you. Maybe after a couple months, they'll include you when they get together. If not, just remain friendly and be yourself. If they don't include you, then it's their loss.|`|K3gqlxonaa	If you feel you have to be apart of the "click"  that's going on between these people and they don't have the generosity in their hearts to invite you to hang out with them, even if it's for a break or something, then go about your way and you will find I'm  sure something or someone else to occupy your time. You never know they may be up to something that you really don't need to be a part of. leave them alone and they will come home...|`|ltqiMaA8aa	Your either:<br>  <br>  A. a loser<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  B. Your a complete asshole and they don't want to hang with you<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  C. You are shy<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  D. Your one of those goody-goodys that noone wants to chill with because your so annoying.
g5hbtv4laa	Not a fan.  Showing emotions is fine and all, but crying (unless someone died) is not really something I like seeing a guy do.  My opinion though, some girls might dig it.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	i sometimes wish my bf would cry for me like i cry for him.when we have our little fights cus its one of those days he just wants to blow me off and be alone and not talk at all and makes me feel crappy and it seems like he doesnt care meanwhile i cry lol. i cry bc i miss him alot too sometimes . i know he misses me and he loves me but i sometimes just wish he would cry for me ,even a little but oh well. i mean not crying over little things but i definately dont see a man crying as a weakness or anything like that. i think it takes a real man to cry lol|`|O1lm79EFaa	lol...<br>  <br>  be more specific<br>  <br>  Crying because I didn't return a call... then that is a ***** lol|`|2FsNdcXEaa	Depends. If someone died, that's nice. If it's because of something stupid, like I didn't text him back, I would think there was something mentally wrong with him.
tXg464rTaa	I'm an unmarried male and over 40.<br>  Many arguments and jokes have come my way over this decision, but I use the logic that marriage is like jail or debt - easy to get into, hard to get out of.|`|AA11449112	i have a sister-in-law who's turning 40 in May.  She dates here and there. but could never find the right person.  it may be that her standard is too high ... who knows. she believes in soulmates.|`|AA10358331	Yes! Because he just never found someone who he wanted to be with. <br>  (but he did just get married a few weeks ago. He was in his 50's)|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Yes, female, because she never wanted to.  She knows she's happier and mentally healthier being single.|`|cGbTJobeaa	I didn't get married until I was 42. I wasted too much time on the wrong men when I was younger and should have either stopped ignoring red flags or (more importantly) moved on when the relationship wasn't progressing to marriage.<br>  <br>  Once I hit my late 30s, I changed my dating strategy to calling it Next! If a guy didn't rock my world after 3 or 4 dates, I didn't waste my time on him and sent him packing so I could be available for Mr Right. NEXT!|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	I know a friend of my husband that never got married she is like 42 or something, she had a bad closer love affair more than 15 years back and since then she is living alone, had some close friends but never BF's, but i know one day she will change all that because everyone need love in their life one day.<br>  <br>  <br>  _K_
xsmBEZGbaa	Umm sometimes they are actually in the shower, but other times they just say that because they don't want to talk to you.<br>  truth or dare is usually to find out more about you, or to make you show them something. haha just speaking from past experiences.|`|OoftsMLhaa	Im going to take a shower is usually and excuse to end a conversation without having a good reason.  Showers are roughly interpreted as a 30 minute absence so in other words he is saying "im bored and wanna play xbox" or "i have **** to do but i don't wanna be rude"  or depending on the truth or dare boundaries maybe something a little more "hands on" if you get what im saying.  <br>  <br>  Which brings me to part 2 of your question.  This is basically an avenue to talk about sex.  I don't know how old you are but if they are starting truth or dare games i imagine the guys are under 18.  Later on we simply start asking questions like "so what kind of music do you like?"  "whats your favorite food?" blah blah blah about 8 of those lame *** questions then we just kinda spill into ones like "what turns you on?" or "whats your favorite position?"  The entire motive is to get you to talk about sex, that's it.|`|tluojTpSaa	It sounds like you are attracting the wrong type of guy!  The shower thing is just so they can stop talking to you.  The truth or dare thing is so they can get their jollies.  They think you are easy, or naughty.  You dont want to talk to that type at all! <br>  sometimes what you say on the computer can sound different than what you meant it to because they cant hear your voice fluctuations.|`|FjUZjnSlaa	Think about it. When you hear shower, what you think of? Someone being naked washing themselves. It's just another way to try to make you think of them without saying anything pervertedly. <br>  <br>  Truth or Dare is a game guys play to see what girls are thinking about them. <br>  <br>  Girl - Truth or Dare?<br>  Guy - Truth?<br>  Girl - When was the last time you had sex?<br>  Guy - Last week (Inside mind: "Oh man! Im a virgin! And she wants to have sex with me! Sweeeeet!")|`|JI1EpWX6aa	Maybe they just don't want to talk to you cause my best friend says that all the time to her guy friends as an excuse to stop talking. And some times I get messaged that and i reply with a yeah right|`|m9xM2HKUaa	yes they have. & it simply means what they're saying. nothing homo or strange about it.<br>  <br>  turth & dare is a fun game with guys. especially if you just go with dares but the game is usually all about getting to know you a bit more.|`|gD8NTUtZaa	I actually do both these thing.<br>  <br>  On AIM, I just say "brb shower" to different girls. I doubt that they will think twice about it.<br>  <br>  And I did play a game of truth or dare twice already. A little awkward though...<br>  <br>  And I'm 18 btw|`|8lLrzz1Baa	If I say I'm going to take a shower, it's usually because I need an excuse to say I'm leaving.<br>  Truth or dare is lame. They are just looking for a way to bring up the topic of s*x.|`|TlPUDrUDaa	uum... i used to talk to my ex boyfriend online and i'd say ill be back in 20 because i had to take a shower..?? i dont see a problem there?<br>  <br>  and as for the truth or dare...sounds kind of childish. maybe theyre just messing around|`|Gk7BeNPSaa	i do it.....maybe because the culture is changing and guys doing it is ok now.|`|dsF1aWbjaa	Saying "I'm going to take a shower" may be just a reason to avoid that other person that you are contacting with.|`|NSwkUNb1aa	whats wrong with saying "I'm going to take a Shower"?, I've never done the truth or dare thing....probably wouldn't play that if I were you....|`|NEMX2Y6maa	Say none, do none of those things. You should change the weird guys you know|`|W2GcDwyOaa	They all like you and I've had several tell me that.|`|olt2ZFkLaa	yeah alot i say it too|`|J4EVtMFtaa	shower yeah its normal why lie to u but truth or dear never|`|NjsVuTjhaa	no not all guys do that, like I am a guy and i dont say if iam having a shower only if i get of like msn and the person asks me were u are going. but maybe they ask u these question and say these stuff  to impress u or they wanna ask u out or some sheet like that|`|yxpFVlHfaa	yeah <br>  my guy friends all say that|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	The shower is a good place to ......|`|klcqgST9aa	My guy friend says he's going to go shower, and he actually goes to masturbate. Idk if it's the same, but, maybe that helps?|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Well, letting you know they are going to shower is tended to put an image in your mind. T&D is a way to see how far they can push you. Maybe even right to the shower if they are so lucky.|`|Fi8AIi4baa	why not say they're taking a shower. would you rather them say 'going to go pick off the aliens in my backyard'?<br>  And I do truth/truth, because dare is somewhat difficult to do over the internet. You know?|`|jeHTjvbaaa	Lol I have texted "Ya, I'm going to take a shower, i'll text later" but usually just as a reason to stop talking...|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Guys did that to me when I was in highschool.|`|lnzeM1m0aa	lol i tell boys when im taking a shower. its just a heads up that they wont text, that or they want you to be like "can i join?" or "oh baby!"  or something.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and i hate truth or dare. can never think of good ones :(<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and you all over think everything. maybe they just need a shower. for real. if i wanna go then i just say "well i think imma go" and guys if you are more complicated then a girl then you need theropy! haha!|`|x2bTvscWaa	it's a mystery to girls why boys do that. my opinion is that maybe some or one of them likes you and wants to hear stuff about you. Or Maybe they just feel like you a true friend and they don't feel awkward talking to u like that.|`|MU453gLqaa	Relax they probably need a shower they probably stink. And they just what to get to know you with the truth or dare it is fine just play nice and only with guys your age. If the questions get to much stop playing with them.|`|ICOmnGIUaa	i have never said i am going to go take a shower i just say i will be back in 10 minutes. They want to play truth or dare with you to probably know who you like and i have done that before.|`|OCTvfDsxaa	I have a guy friend who tells me he's getting in the shower when we've been texting. He don't mean thing by it-just T.M.I!! I think he tells me that because he don't want me to get mad if he don't answer me right away.|`|6a1cc93dd55dba4164421281fe1a70aeaa	they are opening the door to talking about perverted stuff w/ u like sexual stuff to see what you say or how you react then go all out from there. These guys are just perverted.|`|1A1ozEaKaa	it coudl be like one of those 'BRBs' you give when you don't feel like talking anymore<br>  or they could actually be showering lol|`|cRqCyIdRaa	Maybe it is there polite way of ending the conversation...<br>  <br>  truth and dare, maybe its because they want to get to know you better...<br>  <br>  hope I helped
dbQHlp85aa	LOL aww young love.. I remember being 13. <br>  <br>  You're both nervous. YOU need to be the one who makes the first move at school. Just go right up to him in the halls and give him a big hug. You'll feel hardcore butterflies in your belly but you'll be soooo glad you did it once you let go... and believe me, it'll be hard to let go. <br>  <br>  Your friends will all laugh and stuff and you'll both be embarrassed but they'll most likely forget about it by lunch time. :) <br>  <br>  By him saying he wants to play truth or dare means he wants to kiss you and is looking for an excuse to. Don't let that be your first kiss. It should be on a walk home from school or after a date or something. <br>  <br>  Also, and you'll learn this after time... keep some stuff in your relationship PRIVATE!!!  You'll really want to tell your friends about it but just be weary of who, you don't want your secrets blabbed all over the entire school. <br>  <br>  And don't worry about being a bad kisser, it really does come naturally. <br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie.. you have made my whole night.|`|m3q6CIQMaa	this is so childish<br>  <br>  go to school and get an education<br>  <br>  deal with this s - h - i - t   later|`|dsF1aWbjaa	Oh jeez, I'm 13 too.  I've had a bf before, we hugged like everyday and talked o him everyday. <br>  <br>  But Even though you guys have never hugged/kissed, or hardly talk at school,   maybe doesn't mean that you should break up with him.<br>  <br>  But telling him you would like to do more of these things, and telling him that you feel invisible when he is around his friends, this might lead to a better relationship.|`|ICOmnGIUaa	its because you are just getting into the guy/girl stage. After a while you should be more comfortable. I would probably break up with him because it just gets in the way of things and it would probably be easier for you to talk to him.|`|gD8NTUtZaa	Just talk to him and be around him more. Being 13 shouldn't matter if you like the guy.|`|ESsQeH8Aaa	First, you complain that he isn't talking to you enough at school, and then you say you dont want everyone in the school to see him kiss you?  <br>  <br>  Puppy love is so cute.   Annoying, but cute.<br>  <br>  Sweetie,  think about it.  If you were to actually date this guy, won't people know about it?  won't they see you guys together?  Your still treating this relationship like he has "cooties"... which means your just a bit too young to start dating.<br>  <br>  If your going to insist on acting "grown up", then you might want to shed those 3rd grade attitudes about dating. <br>  <br>  If you can't start acting like your 13, then you should stop trying to date this guy until you DO start.|`|olt2ZFkLaa	uhm no..im 13 too. just go f***n talk to hm, he's ur bf!!|`|hw6mnbzHaa	um no. i dont really see any reason to unless you dont like him (which i think you do..hence the butterflies)<br>  <br>  if your nervous about kissing him or whatever..if you havent done it before..tell him that and hopefully he'll take it slow for you. <br>  if you both have phones and can text..plan places to meet at school so you guys can hang out for a few minutes here and there. <br>  <br>  you guys are still very young =] - - just go slow and talk to him about things. <br>  <br>  hope this helped =] goodluck!
319f68749e1561bec57a3eb18244e1e3aa	It is not possibly to cause an orgasm with the use of words... and if you could, be prepared to make lots of money doing it.|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	I don't know but yeah it's just like impossible because you have to be near them! ~I LOVE DEREK|`|Lnw6ZYMoaa	..If you're still using IM, I think you're too young to be thinking about giving a girl an orgasm. Save yourself the embarrassment and go play xbox.|`|9bSCOZB1aa	Calm down Mr. Hormones. I understand that you're in middle school and AIMing girls is exciting and you're obsessed with sex and all but this is going a little far. I can tell you that it really isn't possible to give a girl an orgasm through IM unless you happen to send her a message while she masturbates.|`|0lQtTE9Daa	if your asking this question and you seriously want to give her an orgasm. dont talk to her at all...you will embarase yourself.|`|FYH2xl6Naa	lmao.<br>  deffinitly not,<br>  that's just weird|`|cwyZk7Fuaa	umm u have to? yeah sure. and if she's your friend and have no 'feelings' for her, dont do this. she might stop talking to you..:S|`|Gk7BeNPSaa	use words that well make her go crazy. Not the kinda words that anyone would use, think like a girl and guess how she would like it.|`|YG288fG4aa	Uhmm.... how old are you? Probably too young to have real sex
y9CgveCGaa	He must think you are cool.  I bet he was uncomfortable during those scenes too.|`|FjUZjnSlaa	I usher at a movie theatre. I guess 15 is ok... but absolutely just wanna slap some parents who bring their 6-13 yr old kids into this movie. No wonder why our community is full of screwjobs!<br>  <br>  Your son is comfortable with you seeing this movie with him? 3 reasons:<br>  <br>  *He has no friends.<br>  *He's gay.<br>  *Bad Parenting.<br>  <br>  He should be a kid telling you he's going to see Mall Cop or something and try to sneak in Friday the 13th.|`|LlzJLyiUaa	Hahaha... I would say you're a pretty cool parent. I love my parents and think they are cool. I would go see a movie with them in public, it doesn't bother me. However, I would always make sure the movies weren't anything higher than PG-13! Haha, but that is cool. You don't see that too much these days.|`|8i11907Maa	hahaha you sound like a cool parent i wish my parents were that cool. they get all weird and start being like "cover your eyes!! recent studies show that watching inappopriate things start make you doing them!" man this is why i do NOT go to movies with my parents.
Rtj0tPTDaa	Say to her "if you feel comfortable." Basically tell her what you are telling us. I've been asked back to apartments before and if the guy says he doesn't want me to get the wrong idea and that he just wants to spend time with me, it makes me feel better. You'll be fine. Just be nice and calm.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	Until you feel comfortable with her coming home and she does aswel. Next time you are going to ask her to go somewhere with you. Say to her. Would you like to go to ..... or Would you like to come to my place for dinner or movies and dinner .. . also say - i dont mind what you choose its up to you and its okay if you dont want to come over to mine yet....<br>  <br>  She'll give you her answer. Because going over to someones house. is pretty serious. Obviously you arent going to be there to have s*x but its like a more closed envrioment then out in the dinner place etc.<br>  <br>  but it is asking her back to yours..... from the date...<br>  i think around the 3rd or 4th date.<br>  <br>  1st will be too soon. 2nd is more - getting to know the person a bit more. Firgure out what they like here and  there. Gives you an idea on what plan for the night together after dinner. <br>  3 rd is still here and there. Shows here your not just trying to get in with her.<br>  4th is more - i woud like you to come to mine after. Enjoyed the evening alot - keep the fun night going til late. But no sex until both partners are ready to.. She wont see it as you want sex. If you dont try anything or do anything that will encourage that. Be yourself. Your smart - you can from asking this question that you are.<br>  <br>  God bless|`|2imXzBHbaa	i wait 3 weeks before I expect sex.|`|m3q6CIQMaa	I wonder what you and her would be doing together in the house.  You got a bowling alley there LOL? Sex might be the only option lol.<br>  <br>  Go bowling or something or hang out in public places.  She won't think sex then because yuo can't have sex in the bowling alley lol<br>  <br>  i'm only 21, i don't know, that's what i wud do though I think.<br>  <br>  Invite her to your house when u have known her for a little while.  I don't think you should wait after so many dates.  I would give it at least a couple months.<br>  <br>  Good luck bro|`|QTjnxatraa	That is a hard one. <br>  <br>  If you have had a few dates and been a real gentleman ( and you sound like a complete sweetie), she maybe ready to head back to your place to hangout.  Maybe don't ask her after a date, but make the date at your place, ask her around for pizza and a movie...I don't think she will over read into that like she would have after being out on a date...<br>  <br>  That's how I would see it ;)|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Let her suggest it.|`|tluojTpSaa	you should invite her to your house on the first date!  But do NOT even try to have sex with her-not if you like her.  Just watch a movie or something similar.  Then say you had a good time, tellher goodnight, and that you hope you 2 can get together soon.<br>  I would wait 2-3 weeks before trying the sex thing.  2 dates=a short kiss.  4 dates=passionate kiss.  After that you will be able to tell if she's into it (and you) or not.|`|YG288fG4aa	"Hang Out"? Okay so is this going to happen after a date if so she will probably say no because she thinks you want sex, if it is during the day or not too late at night maybe this can happen. But you should probably wait several dates, uhmm i think you should wait until you know where she wants to go with this relationship|`|kxnRSBp6aa	You shouldn't have to wait too long, as long as those aren't your intentions. After a few dates, she should catch on to who you are kinda, and will realize why you want to invite her back. I'd say the third date. Dates at the house are actually great at getting to know each other better.|`|FYH2xl6Naa	well the question is, are you inviting her back for sex?<br>  If you are i would wait awhile.<br>  Really depends on the girl.<br>  If not, I don't see why she wouldn't come over after the next date.
XsmPnMU4aa	Well did it teach her anything or did she keep asking for money. <br>  <br>  If she kept asking for money she didn't get the hint so yeah your an idiot but if it gets her to stop asking for money it was worth it. <br>  <br>  Sorry I can't think of any good advice right now I just keep thinking about beer now.|`|TuqdZtVpaa	ha! now we know how a woman can get you to burn money fast! she just wanted you to burn your money so she can't have it and you can't! ha ha ha! she is satan!!!!! wow what a fool 50 dollars you could have been drinking away!|`|2P2K0rl2aa	What exactly did she do to you?  Nobody forced you to whip that $50 note out of your wallet and burn it.  You made that choice all by yourself.  It is your fault that you are $50 poorer - make better choices next time.|`|mtOVRAnbaa	Well if you guys have kids and that was the reaso nshe was demanding money then your a jackass for not helping with your children..Otherwise I cant understand why your ex wife would be asking you for money.. <br>  <br>  On another note... your just weird.. and your broke! good luck!|`|OXleDYVQaa	Oh my you poor man. You should be giving her Monopoly money, or those little chocolate candies that looks like coins.<br>  <br>  You blew it big time buddy. You coulda bought a dozen 12 packs of cheap beer.<br>  <br>  Lesson learned I think.<br>  <br>  Dallas|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	She is more intelligent than u, good for her and i feel pity for you, and how u think.<br>  <br>  _K_|`|gocQ9ND5aa	No she is not satan , but you are stupid|`|o1yy6KABaa	yes you are.|`|oHuhTJPwaa	Burning money is never a way of proving a point. Remember you are in control of your emotions and no one can make you do anything you don't already want to, no matter how messed up they are or how mad they make you. Next time, stick the money to your forehead running over her foot as you drive off.|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	Now that was stupid! Now she thinks you just got money to burn.Now she expects more than the 50 you set on fire,You need to figure out a new method on how the two of you can relate you did say EX that's if children are involved!!!! Dumb ***|`|1os95dHZaa	I really wish it had been a one dollar bill, but you cant change the past... Just look at it as that's $50 she ain't gettin, and neither is Uncle Sam! Muahahah...|`|GzvLG6x5aa	you're the one who burned the money. control yourself.|`|vRe6CwgEaa	1) she shouldn't be asking you for money<br>  2) stop burning money|`|gZo1NPVCaa	I would recommend not drinking so much from here on out.|`|XPPGphLbaa	She is not satan - you are!|`|NmsuIXd1aa	she is prob satans daughter.|`|8i11907Maa	dammit dont do that. she is not satan. you are just cocky|`|RahLqH9kaa	you need to grow up|`|8ZGuOuvAaa	I'm happy for her and glad she divorced you.  What's your deal?|`|9IvcV7tiaa	it sounds like she might be. I'd stop carrying cash and just keep plastic in your wallet.|`|61Fwbi79aa	Yep, you're stupid. Shame to waste $50 in this economy. Next time you want to make a statement to her, send me the money.|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	She's not satan.<br>  <br>  You're an idiot.<br>  <br>  Not only did you burn the $50, but you think the best thing to spend it on is beer.<br>  <br>  Nice toilet, btw !!<br>  <br>  :D|`|B12E4rYiaa	You might need help with your drinking problem if you're burning up money. AA is a good program and will help keep you sober.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	you dont get to many beers out of fifty bucks .. so you did the right thing .. mate but next time just dont answer her you got play mate|`|0ftlllPBaa	damn man i was needing to borrow some money off u
AA11452160	37? I think you need a break from them for a while. Maybe a long while.|`|cOce5YbRaa	It is so very hard to deal with parents or even family that treats us like this. It seemed no matter what I did, it was never good enough and no matter what I would buy especially my Mom, I never even got a thank you. It is beyond what I call mental abuse but I let it get to me but I loved my parents with all my heart. I am the youngest of 2 other siblings and I chose to take care of my Mom the last about 5 1/2 years of her life. I gave up my life and career and moved back and lived with my Mom. My brother lived in the same town, just down the road about 1 mile and only came by to see her about once every 3-4 months. She would gripe and holler about him and take it out on me all of the time but when he would come she would be so happy and pat him on his leg and ask him how he was doing and like nothing had ever happened. She never once acted like she appreciated a thing I did for her. It really got to me but my whole family was like that. When my Mom passed away, I found her lieing on the floor in her bathroom. She apparently started feeling bad I guess and just laid down and that was it. It messed me up really bad mentally for a long time. It's so hard feeling like you aren't loved by anyone in your family. And when she passed away I felt even more alone because my Dad had passed away in 1993. I was alot closer to him than my Mom. I was 44 years old when I lost my Mom and I am now 47 years old. It just takes time to get over what happens and I don't know if people ever really get over it. I have just learned to live with it. I quit going around all of the rest of my family when my Mom passed away so I don't have to feel like this anymore. Good luck and I wish you the best.|`|15Uz3lO2aa	Stop seeing them for awhile, sounds like you need a break. don't look for reassurance through them, they never gave you that, so don't think you'll get it now. <br>  <br>  Tell them you won't come the next few times they invite you over, even if on holidays, when they ask you why, say "because I'm really happy with my life right now and I don't want any negative energy coming my way." Even if that sentence sounds like something you'd never say, say it because it's a powerful statement of "I won't put up with you treating me this way". If they start yelling and accusing after you say this, say, "You just proved my point" and hang up. Keep doing this. <br>  <br>  Whatever statement you choose to make to them, that will notify them that you won't be putting up with it anymore, make sure you repeat the exact same sentence every time they call to invite you over. It may take 10 times til they get it that if they ever want to see their daughter again, they'll have to change their attitudes. <br>  <br>  There's a chance they'll never get it, in which case, don't ever see them. You're better off without their negativity, and your old enough to live your own life. Get the support you long for from friends. Family is the family you were given... Friends are the family you choose.|`|Gv5CDtMdaa	I got the occasional "I pay the bills" etc. I... don't care. You're 37 now, and like you said, you have a job at a big company. So, your dad WAS wrong.|`|UWx1beYtaa	You need to tell them the next time they do something like that to you that you don't want them any where near you.<br>  <br>  If you start ignoring them they may see how serious you were and sick of it you are.<br>  <br>  Your 37 now so you don't need that in your life. Your father said you wil never work for a big company and you are now so that tells him that he is wrong and I think you need to point that out to him.<br>  <br>  OR the next time they yell at you just start yelling back telling them how you feel, if you keep it at the same level that are at then they will eventually have to listen to you.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if they went off because you have them each $20, don't give them anymore presents if they are so unappreciative.
RtkB46peaa	He's got cold feet.  That could be perfectly normal and reasonable, depending on your relationship, how long you've been together, and your collective maturity.  Stay with him if it feels right.  If not, you'll know what to do.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	this has to stop .. you need a man not a boy .. so tell him its you or nothing .. stop him playing you ..|`|2P2K0rl2aa	He's not that into you.  If he was into you, he'd have no qualms about marrying and staying committed to you.  He wants to keep you while he waits for someone better to come along.|`|o1yy6KABaa	Basically hes e xpecting you to hang around and put up with all of this until he IS ready.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	No, I would say he "likes" you. But not enough to be committed. My advice....send him packing. You are worth more than what he has to offer.|`|iD4ejChZaa	here it is, he loves you, today. He is not ready to say if he will always love you. he is being so honest, its great. he deserves to know that this is what he wants for the rest of his life. stop talking about marriage<br>   [i know its difficult i'm female too] but just stop it, enjoy life, please please go to church, pray, let him see you grow as a person. he is very wise to not blindly follow his heart.|`|ARalIeGsaa	He's afraid of commitment. Talk to him and give it some more time. Help him to feel "comfortable" with you. He's nervous. I think it's worth working on if you both love each other. If after awhile he still seems to be this way, say "I think we should see other people". If he doesn't want to lose you, he will start figuring out how to commit himself more so that he doesn't lose you to some1 else.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	He is not husband material, plain and simple.  If you think love alone is enough, then wait and keep waiting.<br>  <br>  Then again, I don't know if you understand the meaning of husband material because you were fixated on love and chose not to talk about whether he was ready for the responsibility of being a husband.  It is easy to say "I love you", a lot harder (and scarier) to take on responsibilities.|`|IlSGU9Yzaa	He may really love you but is afraid of having "buyers remorse". Like buying a car. The deal sounds good but would hate to hear of a missed opporrtunity. Tell him to get with it or See Ya|`|vRe6CwgEaa	This could be related to something in the past.  You may want to talk to him about it and get everything out in the open.|`|9fpJSgsbaa	I think he's confused and a bit immature. Has he asked you to marry him? If he has and still says these things, then that's a bit weird.|`|0X33btOfaa	sounds like a guy who is immature and has problems with commitment...red flag!|`|9UQlhzitaa	well of course your not desperate<br>  <br>  let me but this in a woman terms for you (stop laughing until your done reading)<br>  <br>  yea he is scared that he is going to make a mistake that will hurt you both.<br>  <br>  he loves you but may have a fear that once he says i will commit to you for the rest of my life it will all blow up in his face<br>  <br>  he has been hurt before by moving too fast;but also doesn't want you to walk<br>  <br>  in your terms for some reason he is emotional bankrupt when it comes to feeling secure about marriage; sorry with the small amount of details i can't offer anymore help but if you want let me know and i'll tell you what i see from the outside looking in|`|uvXgD9Ygaa	This guy said to you, I don't know if you're the right girl for me, and I just don't know if I want to be with you.<br>  <br>  Is there anything else that needs to be said to you?<br>  <br>  You should read into that book, he's just not that into you, it sounds stupid but it's true.  If you were the right girl for him, he wouldn't be voicing doubts to you, he would force through any fears brought on by the past or anything else to be with you.|`|3d45de200426a763c6eea218946f1c01aa	I am not a man honey, but to be honest, if he is getting cold feet before getting a ring, that will not change.  You owe it to yourself to find a man that will treat you as a Queen.  If a man really wants you- he will show it.  Please quit wasting your time on this person.  You may love him to death, but if you show him you can be independant on your own, it may bring him to his senses.<br>  <br>  Be strong!|`|CAKPLhTDaa	I think it's just cold feet mixed with immaturity. Just have a nice conversation with him and share your thoughts.|`|ldg9R93iaa	it could be related to something that hapened to him before!|`|7wY015Ysaa	Woah! <br>  <br>  It looks like full-blown commitment troubles. How long have you been together? Are you hinting towards marriage? Do you 'want' to marry him?<br>  <br>  I think for people who 'are' scared of commitment, it's best to be as relaxed with them as possible, and try and not take it personally, though that can be pretty difficult.<br>  <br>  For some people, getting into a 'serious' relationship can be VERY scary, like having children or buying a house. <br>  <br>  Depending on his life before you, and what he's used to and what he enjoys, he's probably scared that by getting married/too involved with you could jeopardize that.<br>  <br>  If it were me, personally, and I were saying that, I'd be confused because I'd want to be with you (assuming I love/lust/whatever you) however I don't want to lose the life which I already enjoy.<br>  <br>  Obviously, it's just a theory, he may hate his life of course lol, but that's what it seems like. Hope it helps in some way.
cOce5YbRaa	Oh my goodness sweetie!!  You are definitely in a tough situation but not one that can't be resolved hopefully. First off my advice to you would be to ask your Dad if you and him could sit down and have a talk. Tell him how you feel, especially the part about wanting to be his little daddy's girl. And put the word little in it when you tell him even though you are 14 years old. That will really catch his attention first off. I know it is hard for you to understand this but your Dad is under trememdous stress with not only work but especially with your Mom being depressed, but your Dad needs to realize that all of you are being affected by your Mom's depression. Bring this to his attention also because alot of people don't realize just how bad it affects everyone and he isn't thinking straight. My husband used to holler and scream at his kids(their Mom passed away with cancer nearly 6 years ago) so they are my step-kids but I don't like to call them that. But anyway, he acted like your Dad because he had to be the Dad and Mom for so long and not only worked but had to cook, clean, wash dishes, wash clothes, etc....  Anyway, his daughter is 16 and son is 13 but they never helped him with anything period and still don't help with anything because they are so lazy and only want to do what they want to do and get what they want. After a few times of me getting involved with his screaming and cussing at his kids and bringing it to his attention, he finally quit. He just didn't realize how much he did it and what all he would really say until I bought it to his attention and told him to stop. Don't ever stop loving your Dad sweetie. He is only human even though he isn't doing you right at this time. But he is the only Daddy you will ever have and I know he loves all of you alot. Depression can put so much stress on other people it is unreal. I am a counselor and have experienced depression alot in my life so I know how it feels but your Dad needs to realize he is depressed also because of your Mom not being at herself right now but he needs to realize it is affecting all of you and not just him. Just talk to him sweetie and talk to him like a really loving daughter which he really needs right now. If he is the right kind of Dad, which it sounds like he probably is, he will listen and it will surely give him something to think about. Sometimes everyone, young and older, need to be told something to realize what they are really doing and how it feels so it will be brought to their attention. Good luck sweetie and I wish you the very best. Hang in there. Things will get better. I will be thinking about you alot. If you want to talk sometime, let me know. I am here for you. Sorry my answer was so long.|`|UWx1beYtaa	You need to talk to him, tell him how you feel when he yells at you, make sure he knows you understand that he is stressed but he can't be taking it out on you, maybe even tell him its pushing you away from him, that might give him a walk up call.|`|a90d2414a4c76a94b6d06ed42bca2891aa	Why not put your arms around him and give him a kiss, and tell him that you know he's troubled, and that you're there for him whenever he needs someone to talk to.
czPTpyraaa	There is no excuse for a one year old child to not understand "sit your *** down" - If the child in lieu of your request decides to ignore you then I suggest screaming at the top of your lungs, this usually makes the child cry and incapacitates them, thus making them lose energy and sit down|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	WHAT????????????????<br>  <br>  HOW DO YOU SIT KNEES.

I had a hard time figuring out what you were asking because of how misspelled it was. Babysitting your niece requires you to watch her/supervise her so she doesn't get hurt.

Maybe play some games with her and give her a snack. And the word is Niece. If you are young you need to tell your mom you cannot babysit. You shouldn't be left with a child if you aren't old enough.

You have gone through this too long!|`|PYF8cYtqaa	a real man provides and helps out leave him and get your self a working man that will you out. and not some lazypants|`|14929d050f0d4920cb09fe344ab094b9aa	Did he move in with you? Does that mean he doesn't eat at your place? Why do u expect him to be responsible when he doesn't eat there? Just tell him that you are financially struggling too and you want to rent the extra bedroom and see what he says. If he lives with you , he should be paying rent cause its not fair for him to pay his debts and may be live you after when he is comfortable. That would break your heart , eh!  What is his excuse for not marrying you? Did you move in with him with the hope of getting him to marry you? Since there is no hope you shouldn't live with. live is separate and see what his next move is.|`|gwa7YS88aa	I know you love this man and it's easy to say-leave him but from what i see he is taking advantage of you.Reality is that some men are not worth us giving all of ourself's.He will never change hun.If he dosen't want to marry you now why will he later on-loook's to me that if he did ever consider you would pay for the wedding :/ .We want a man that can take care of him self that way when we need help he is there-think about it.If you bring it up is because he know's it wrong of him to not want to help so he turn's it on you and create's an argument.You should really think about how you see yourself in 5 to 10 years and if he will be in the picture.Good luck :)|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Sorry, but sounds like he's with you out of convenience and not love.<br>  He has a profession and hasen't paid you in 2 years?<br>  Girl, what is wrong with you? Do you have an ounce of self respect? Dignity? Pride?<br>  Give this guy the boot. He's is NOT going to change. Your first mistake was to ask him to move in with you. I never lived with any of my boyfriends. But that's just me. <br>  He is obviously not showing you any respect or a hint of appreciation. Especially what you did for his daughter.<br>  Quit being a doormat to him. You are much more worthy than that.
l43NSgHyaa	Well, I love weddings.  So, I always try to remember something good about them.<br>  <br>  The best food was at a wedding I went to about 4 years ago.  It must have cost the couple a ton.  But, the cocktail hour was massive.  They had about 10 different passed hor'd oeuvres, craving stations, veggie/cheese/ fruit crudites, passed signature drinks and open bar.   Then, dinner was about 5 courses, including an intermezzo (the sorbet to cleanse the pallet)  They also had wedding cake and a huge Venetian Table.<br>  <br>  The Best Wedding Cake was at a another wedding I went to about 2 years ago.  I don't know what kind of cake it was.  But, I remember eating a fork full and thinking, "wow, wedding cake is usually horrible, but this is so good"   Even someone sitting next to me agreed.<br>  <br>  My future brother-in-law and his wife  had the best venue.  It was outside, under a pavilion and in the evening.  It was really beautiful and I loved the open and airy feeling.    But, what was even better, was that it was a traditional wedding hall, but they just opted to have the reception under the pavilion.  So, the food was made on the property and was fresh and good.   <br>  <br>  I went to a brunch wedding and I loved it.  The food was so good.  Plus, the bride and groom had use of a private garden/patio area, that was ajacent to their reception room.   The wedding was in the summer and I like having the option to go out to the patio and mingle with people during the reception.  I really like that.<br>  <br>  Other than that, I been to two other weddings.  The first wedding wasn't all that memorable, expect I remember they had a really good cocktail hour and it was held at a golf club.  <br>  <br>  The other one was my boyfriend's cousin.  It was fun, because I knew a lot of people there and we sat with my boyfriend's family and cousins.  We were right near the bar and we were having fun drinking and socializing.  Plus, the bride and groom where having the best time.  I never saw a bride having so much fun at her own wedding!!|`|eF92uM2Saa	It was very informal summer afternoon wedding in a park. Some guy strummed  a little guitar over by where the food was before the ceremony.  A friend who was a judge performed the very short ceremony with just the bride, groom and judge. The couple had a retired florist friend donate the flowers.  The food including the cakes (wedding and grooms cake) were all provided by friends. The food was really good though not what you would expect at a wedding and the cakes were not traditional or fancy. People sat around in the sun and shade and talked. The guy who was playing guitar lazily and softly played a few more tunes for those who were into it.  Guests played hackey sac, frisbee, badminton and volleyball. Someone stuck up a  money clothes line and I think most everyone gave them some cash even though they had already given something else.  <br>  <br>  It was just so low key and everyone was happy. Nobody was stressed. I especially liked that the couple didn't have a big  financial burden.|`|y54U1JL6aa	I've definitely been to my fair share of weddings!!! My favorite would have to be one that my mom and I directed a few years ago.  It was big as far as attendance (500) but it wasn't flashy.  This girl was known by the whole town because her parents own a local business.  The wedding itself was short with beautiful music and the sanctuary was decorated with ferns and not too many flowers.  Then the reception was at her family farm with a band and tons of food under one of those big white tents.  I liked this because I don't feel that you spend that much time in the church, so why spend TONS of money on flowers and stuff?  We spent from about 6:30 -1:00AM at her reception so that's where she spent the most money on food and a band.<br>  <br>  I guess this wedding was so good because she seemed to really know how to have a simple wedding with a "good time" reception.  (and she was one of the easiest brides my mom and I have ever directed for!)|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	The best wedding I ever attended, ohhh wow, this is hard.  The first one I was only 9 years old and it was my cousins wedding in New York.  She was so pretty had a beautiful dress and it was at this huge place that had a two sided staircase.  There were champagne fountains, and it was very nice.  The second one was another cousin of mine and it was very nice too.  She had taken photos of her and her husband as they grew up and put them on a slide show which was cool and she had a beautiful dress too.  Her reception was at the Omni and of course you know we had all kinds of food and dancing.|`|fZdBaMl1aa	my cousin's wedding took place in a beautiful cathedral and then we went to some fancy hotel and they entered the room on opposite stair cases and met in the center of the room. then they danced together and it was seriously Cinderella esque. God it was gorgeous!|`|qMrFd0vNaa	when the bride and groom walk in at the reception we all throw rose petals<br>  chocolate fountain
NeymQe9raa	by fighting and getting jealous you're really just pushing her into leaving you or cheating on you. you really need to talk to her, you need communication. if you find that your stressed then just tell her something like "hey im feeling this and this way because of this" and if its about being jealous than just say you're sorry that you get that way and you're trying to work on it, but the key thing is to work on it together.doing everything by yourself in a relationship isn't a relationship. please just communicate with her more and try to understand each other. good luck.|`|RnQFwIuUaa	You are feeling helpless because you have moved and can't keep tabs on her. Does she do anything that makes you think that she isn't faithful? Ask her if not tell you about her talking with other boys and her ex boyfriend. Let her know that it makes you jealous and you start imaging her with them. Do something nice for her and tell her how much you appreciate her. Good luck|`|j2qrOjo1aa	trust is everything<br>  tell her what you just wrote here and give her space...dont accuse her|`|t3G5xSbIaa	u just gottta learn hun too embrace the pain and taht she loves u so u needa trust her no more jelousy darlin|`|FyvrWG6laa	The only person who can control in a relationship is you. Your gf is also uncertain about you and your plans towards her, a little insecurity maybe.Try to listen to her, we girls wanted to talk things and wants to be heard. Dont argue with her if she gets moody, show her you care and love her and that you are sincere. Being in a relationship is not only purely dating and sex its more than that. you are dealing with the minds not just your gf now but other girls that you might meet in the future. Dating is fun..even if she doesnt turn out to be Miss Right and vise versa. God bless you.|`|ou3wQcuYaa	This is some general information I had in my head from a magazine:  When a boyfriend or girlfriend gets jealous easily and there is not a good reason they could be trying to create distance between their partner.  I am not sure if this is the case for you, but you might be afraid to be in a relationship.|`|JYQ6M5xmaa	well how far did you move? well.. i used to get jealous really easily with one of my ex boyfriends... basically why he's my ex. she'll eventually get sick of the fighting and leave, so just picture your life without her and then put the two together and maybe youll realize if you keep the jealousy thing up you're going to lose her. so maybe then you won't even think to start a fight.. seriouslly.. good luck with that|`|a2MZLS2Qaa	If you and her have a great relationship then that means you Have a good Gf. try and think of all the good things she has. and then tell yourself your really lucky to have someone like that. Jealousy is some what normal but it can drive someone nuts and then run away from the relationship. Ask yourself what makes you jealous? and go from there..<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|flspL64taa	i have the same problem, my boyfriend just started college and i'm afraid he's going to find a new, older, beautiful girl to be with and i find myself picking fights with him just out of my own insecurities, when i realize it i explain and apologize then he tells me he couldn't find anyone better than me blah blah blah. <br>  we are all prone to these emotions, just try to avoid them, jealousy never helped anyone, but if you do slip up explain and apologize|`|T8P2sXMGaa	honestly. you have to be good with you, before u can go dominating someones life. it doesn't matter if this is about your girlfriend or anything else. it seems like part of the reason your paranoid over her is because your terrified to lose her. that shouldn't really be the case. if you know you can't trust her.. you probably cant. and if u think you cant. ITS NOT YOUR BUSINESS TO TAKE IT OUT ON HER.|`|dI6jfLM9aa	you need to learn to trust her to know that if she loves you as much as you love her then you two should be just fine :) you have to trust her. be honest with her and tell her how you feel :)|`|AA12117694	trust is all|`|EZ1cPPvkaa	Something that really helps when I get jealous is to think about two things.<br>  One, imagine how your jealousy is making your girlfriend feel. Has she ever reacted jealously towards you?  I think about how much better my boyfriend responds to me when I accept his ladyfriends and whatnot, and how much better our relationship goes. <br>  Also, it helps to turn the situation around.  Say, for example, you're jealous of a male friend of hers.  Just think about a time when you've wanted to hang out with a female friend, and hopefully, how she reacted without jealousy.|`|63tch8D5aa	One of the deadly sins, Jealousy.<br>  <br>  7 months is a good length,<br>  ask yourself,<br>  <br>  do you know trust her?<br>  do you have any reasons not to trust her?<br>  <br>  <br>  without a doubt, <br>  there are other attractive people on the planet,<br>  not saying your ugly or that she thinks like that,<br>  but i hope you get what i m saying.<br>  <br>  <br>  i am a major jealous person.<br>  <br>  but she is with you,<br>  not with anyone else,<br>  <br>  let her know shes the only one for you,<br>  maybe she has jealousy issues,<br>  <br>  open your ears,<br>  heart and eyes,<br>  <br>  and talk to her about it,<br>  <br>  let her refresh your memory who matters to her and who doesnt.|`|up0FZEv0aa	WEll i am a woman, and i think the best thing to do is trust her. maybe you are the way your are because of a past experience. but remember a good relationship will last if there is trust. if there isnt....it wont last really long. also, try calling her and tell her that you just want this relationship to work...and that u like her alot (or love her if your inlove in that matter) <br>  <br>  trust me, try to calm down on arguing....because that just makes matters worst. JUST TALK IT OUT! CALMLY OF COURSE! lol<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK HUN <br>  ;)|`|dRyifylCaa	OMG! wow lmao your very much like me i get jealous so easily its not even funny.<br>  Well what you can do is just explain to her why your jealous.....But for you to get over your jealousy just calm down a little when a guy flirts with her or if she flirts with a guy because what shes trying to do is get you jealous or shes trying to see how you react..trust me i know lol...so if its a test just act natural and once you get use to it you'll be jealous free TRUST ME. =]|`|FV2qx8V5aa	Coming from a girl, dont be so jealous, or just keep it to yourself... Jealousy is annoying, if u annoy her she will probably leave u, me and my bf have been together for 8 months, we are practically married, but one thing that keeps us sane, is not being so jealous.|`|QIXSndBSaa	Well i think that you guys should make eachother laugh and try on being happy togather.And listen to her point of view when she needs to express her fillings.And i think that you should try on doing the same thing.|`|THe0Jt0haa	Are you jealous because your a friad that she wont be faithful.<br>  <br>  or afraid that she'll meet somone else.<br>  <br>  <br>  Either way you have to have full trust in someone if you love them.|`|NkokYuSuaa	Tell her how much u love her when u r hugging her or sumthing and then tell her the u get angry sumtymz and itz just becuz u luv her and try to understand u when u get angry or jealous.|`|YG288fG4aa	Well every couple fights but if you are fighting everday thats a problem, just try to be more trusting and not so jealous|`|K2jT1z5jaa	look at it Like :<br>  <br>  If you are too obsessed with her and you dont do something about it- She could leave you.<br>  If  you trust her - you will let her have her choice and say in things. im not sure how jealous you get. But you need to calm down a bit about it. Because this is serious and can get out of control if not delt with. My partner used to be like this. (because of other reasons - like he was at work alot and i was out alot)& i had enough and i clearly said to him. You need to lighten up if you dont. i dont think this is going to work out and either you do something - or i will...<br>  Sorta thing..<br>  <br>  but since we actually sat down and talked about it. Things changed the relationship got alot better and everything improved - our trust and arguments alot less. <br>  And we just started falling in love again... And it felt so much beter. that he trusted me.. like he didnt before.<br>  <br>  Please be strong - yes you love her- but you need to trust her with everything. Or it can turn to the worst.<br>  <br>  God Bless x Be strong x|`|HJrTuihcaa	you just need to train yourself not to get jealous and not let it get to you.

Just casually start talking about the dance & then ask her if she is going with anyone|`|wPT33kEUaa	don't worry about how far away it is just ask her before someone else does.|`|jxcXVRDuaa	2 year crush?<br>  GET DAT AS-S MENG|`|ADSCOgxmaa	you take your chance man tell her ta feel free to say no but if you don't ask NOW someone else will!!!|`|07HWkV4eaa	If you're a sen that doesn't leave a lot of time. Be a man, ask her or I will.|`|QUFAKk1paa	dont be a pansy just do the dam thang|`|D0sLR3j5aa	Ask before someone else does,|`|bhE4o0Teaa	Wait until you hang out with her alone at first. That way you get more of a feel for what she is like. If you like her, then go ahead and ask, I mean if she never liked you to begin with, it's not like you gained or lost any ground. Girls get over the awkwardness if they really want you as a friend. Good luck.
vM0ey1rCaa	DON`T. trust me, nothing but trouble.|`|fZgoUty4aa	look after your baby forget the rest|`|lIO4uiJmaa	Well if she has a boyfriend and baby when she is not in a position to go out with you, or she shouldn't be.<br>  <br>  Forget her and find someone who is free to be with you
74qzsGalaa	Try to relax. Dress for success, but make sure your still comfortable. Style your hair. Use a style that is cute.  Use make up, but not too much.  Just enough to make your skin look smooth and clean. Wear a sweet smelling perfume.  Be nice and act confident.  Remember to be respectful, because the only way to gain respect is to give respect. And treat yourself with respect. Its your life, cherish it. Try to be helpful.  Treat others the way you want to be treated. Join a club at your school or church. This will help you become less shy.  It's normal to be shy, so don't feel bad for doing so.
4sJP4aGSaa	I agree with the guys above...hed get into much more trouble than she would..cuz its kinda like kidnapping since she's not an adult....even if she wanted to go with him the government would think something else....i dont live in the states so i wouldnt really know but im sure hed be in much more trouble.|`|98XExOmqaa	she won't get in as much trouble as he will.|`|BtvlBwy1aa	if they get caught he gets charged with kidnapping and goes to jail.

jQFk7KT4aa	sell your xbox<br>  sell your playstation<br>  sell your computer games<br>  <br>  enroll in sports or some kind of activity, drama club, etc.  <br>  <br>  being a teenager is an awkward time and here's a little secret i'll share with you.  Im 25, I wasn't shy but I was just never around, i had work/sports/school etc...never had time to party and i didn't date that much.  <br>  <br>  You know all those "cool" kids that are at your school now that party, drink, smoke up and having lots of sex? thats it for them man, high school is the last time they will be "cool"  they'll be hanging out with the same kids from high school 10 years from now and they'll have fat wives, be selling phones at the mall or snow-bums on the slopes.  You know what guys like you will do?  be graduated from college with a bachelor's and maybe even a master's, making two to three times as much as they are, hooking up with much prettier girls or married to higher class women.  having a family, owning a house, traveling to different countries.  <br>  <br>  at 16, I wasn't the cool kid, but guess what, im 25 now, ive been with hundreds of girls, im over that phase and am about to be married to the love of my life, literally the perfect woman.  Im in the military, about to be commissioned as an officer, ive seen the world, traveled a lot, defended my country, and now im settling down, have my degree, making big bucks, getting married, i'll be completely debt free by the end of this year...<br>  <br>  guess what else.  im now stationed back home where i grew up.  When we go out with the select few friends ive kept from my childhood, we laugh at those same "cool" guys that are drunk at the bar, hitting on girls, getting rejected constantly, living in apartments with roommates, driving 1993 hondas with a beer belly and completely pathetic.  <br>  <br>  high school can be rough, but once you're out you'll look back and realize the only thing that matters is your grades and where you go from there.|`|qIEhu6uxaa	aw this innocence is so sweet!  but i understand it makes life hard.  definitely try talking to girls slowly.  if you have a lab partner or math partner or something, try telling them a random story.  be like, "ah man my mom makes me so mad sometimes.  i got grounded yesterday.  are your parents that annoying?"  just little starters like that help out.  if you dont talk to people right away about relationships and what not, they won't think you're creepy.  they'll see you as a normal human and find you funny or interesting, wanting to hear more about you.<br>  <br>  good luck sweetie!|`|Mo2J38uAaa	Start smoking weed.|`|TmStqzaVaa	Everyone has a talent. Find yours, master it, and you'll get a lot of confidence from it. <br>  Force yourself in social situations. That way you get in more practice.<br>  Remember, the thing that women find most attractive about men is confidence. It has been ingrained in the natural selection process that males who are "protectors" are better mates. So heres the cliff notes version:<br>  <br>  1. Tap into your talents, gain confidence.<br>  2. Man up, believe in yourself.|`|NSwkUNb1aa	curse? its all in your head dude, get over it, and so some confidence|`|1EXAZMnLaa	i definetely agree with "Chiodos" anyone who is 17 and puts themselves up as a power ranger def isnt gonna be getting the ladies.|`|QUFAKk1paa	first off.... maybe ur socially awkward, i mean look at that avatar u have of urself|`|AQPdi1KUaa	stay true to who you are because you will meet a shy and creepy girl who is perfect for you. there is a whole new life out side of high school, i swear it doesn't stay this way. im 24 now and im still shy and creepy. i didnt have any boyfriends in high school and i have had plenty there after. don't worry about it. pay attention to yourself because you have to figure YOU out first before you can figure out a woman anyway.|`|N2EObz5Baa	First off this one goes out to "Rick The Ninja" aka (man with experience...sucking man peen)...Take a hike bozo you aint got a clue. Second this goes out to the creepiest of creeps. You think you're coming off weird? You are. I had to turn the lights on in my room cause after reading your little bio I thought you were lurking in the corner pulling on you're little wee wee to the sound of me typing. It's really unbelievable. If I was a girl in your school I would avoid you every chance I got. Sorry the truth hurts sometimes. If anyone feels what I'm saying is harsh you can just go fly a kite cause I could really give to shakes of my droopy cack to what you think. Don't defend the freak he needs to end his life by leaving the family car running in the garage. Take out the whole clan. If it were my way I'd make sure Rick "Ninja" was in the house too and got a double dosage of creep and carbon monoxide. Well, I gotta go now and be awesome enjoy my words of wisdom and don't talk to girls they don't like you. :P|`|yO6Akf3Faa	hey bro ur not weird, there is no such thing is weird. Some people are social and some people like u and i are not so much. When that girl that likes who for who you are comes around man she wont care if ur an alien!! haha <br>  anywat man dont put yourself down! EVER!! you are worth so much more than that! just be happy in your own way, start believing in yourself because it is very obvious to me that the only limitations in this world are mental, you can do whatever you want if u put ur mind to it<br>  <br>  best of luck bro<br>  eric|`|qHiBm3q7aa	Why don't you get a job at a place you like to go shop at a video game store or a store at the mall. Chances are there will be at least one girl and she will share at least one interest with you considering you guys work at the same place. Don't feel like you are weird or creepy 17 is a tough age you will be fine :) Good Luck :)|`|jxcXVRDuaa	Go to your friends house.<br>  Go to the movies with your friends.<br>  Go out in public with friends.<br>  <br>  No friends?

It won't.|`|MpTgh6MMaa	you should talk to girls in your class first. make small conversation first. <br>  <br>  or ask your guy friends to introduce you to some girls|`|fd3t77YLaa	damn ud destroy the competition on the biggiest looser|`|UsILuXt1aa	The only way to get over this problem is to just jump all in. Go up to a girl and say hi, what is the worst that can happen? if she is mean she might pick on you but once that is out of the way there is nothing to fear. Take it from a girls perspective, I personally like the shy guys, they are soooo cute! and i know its a bit cliche but just be yourself, and whatever you do, don't try to "play cool" we can see that from a mile away!|`|OMs8tKlJaa	Take a shot of vodca or two, relax a little bit and just suck it up and talk to them!
mN9Oby3yaa	No, its not wrong. It was only the second date, so you are both new to this relationship. Chances are he didn't think much of it. Plus, now he knows that you have respect for yourself; who knows where the invite inside could have led? ;) Anyway, you probably did yourself a good thing. Guys love a girl that plays hard to get. Good luck with the new guy :)|`|IrK3XqYKaa	3 dates I think should be a general rule. After that I believe you can start inviting him into your personal space and vice versa. I think things will gradually build up to your satisfaction. But don't give in too quickly, too soon is a slutty and too long is a gal who likes to lead guys on (or use them) just trust your womanly instincts...|`|jO9ybkv0aa	I think he understand that, but next time try to have a coffee with him. <br>  <br>  And don't think negative just be yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|8d305d626997db3cee36b1f14b85aaf8aa	take your time if he is worth the wait he will wait|`|o1yy6KABaa	No you did the right thing....make him wait:)|`|3BfNshHYaa	i dont think so.... if he was just dropping u off i think its fine|`|nZ49ukJvaa	your smart, its a good thing to get to kno him better before u let him in, cause hey, he could be the type of guy who is actually lollipop mc gravediggerzilla, the man who hadnt any teeth, cut off his fingers, and put them in his gums, because HAHA, now he can pop his knuckles every time he chews a good char broiled steak inside of his cozy tent inside of his cozy igloo|`|M4X3HOV5aa	its a good thing that you didn't invite him in. you are making him want you more. and if you have sex with him too soon then he might lose interest.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	I think that's what he was waiting for.  Invite him in for coffee next time.|`|RtkB46peaa	Um, you kissing him back is enough to tell him that  you're interested.  The fact that you didn't invite him in on the second date, just tells him you're not a skank.  Good job!<br>  <br>  My only concern about your question is this:  you said " I didn't want him to get the wrong idea about me, because I really like him".  Does that mean if you didn't really like him, you WOULD have invited him in?|`|D3hYbsVJaa	It is a bit early for that. If you really have a good one, he'll wait till you're ready to progress.|`|ed8e2883b996a3685d6359a821a2d765aa	I don't understand this thing people like to do of not doing what they both want to do because they think it is more polite to be frustrated.|`|84f1d633997f832abb6eb96e376f11daaa	not yet, wait for one more date
8FbOtXAXaa	Yeah why not? I'm sure she already has an idea that you like this guy so just come out with it and tell her.
loqsl5xXaa	take her out for ice cream or something like that. Then just take a deep breath and go for it. Explain to her how you really care about what she is doing to her body and her future career. Tell her she is great and has so much going for her and you would hate to see it all go away because she is doing something so ridiculous. Ask her why she is doing it and let her know why her answer isn't good enough (any answer isn't good enough when it comes to why). Explain to her that you will support her in anyway she needs is so she can start being clean. Tell her that it will stay between you 2 if she promises that she will stop. I know you might not want it to go here, but if she really has a future and if she doesn't want to stop. It can lead to harder stuff or she can start using more and more. you may have to talk to someone outside of your circle..and ask them for help to help her. <br>  <br>  You are a great friend and I am sure if you just talk to her from the heart and be really calm and collective she will listen and talk to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you can get through to her!!

Then open up to her that drugs are capable of ruining lives and careers.  It can damage her health and she will eventually loose her dreams as an athlete, if she won't put a stop to it.  It is a good thing that you are concerned for your friend's welfare.

Because either you both know better than to make really big mistakes that will tear you apart, or you both can truly forgive each other for those terrible mistakes.  (Both traits at once would be ideal though)  Plus you have to be 100% sure that person is your best friend and your best lover.

Start loving her more because think of how you will feel if they were gone.|`|tF3iHmrCaa	put her head INSIDE your vagina|`|ouEdxS5taa	just let your sis sleep, then when she finds out all the classes she failed....|`|FwJLD1uDaa	hahaha i love getting revenge on my little sis, but she and i do sort of a back and forth thing, as a game. its not serious payback, because i would never want to really hurt her feelings. try to make her guilty about not being nice to you, just tell her stuff like "sis, im trying so hard, i just wish we could get along better"<br>  <br>  or if you want revenge, re-arrange all the furniture in her room and put some of your stuff in! lie down on her bed when she gets home from school. scare her into thinking that you have two rooms and your mom and dad told your sis to sleep outside. best of luck! xD|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Just let her suffer the consequences of her actions. Don't get her up for school and let her be late and such.
jQFk7KT4aa	If your parents think your baby's dad is a piece of crap, then he probably is, you shouldn't be letting him see the kid just so you can have "free time."  you are living for free under their roof and they are providing for you and your daughter.  If they don't think you should be going out and partying on the weekends that is their perogative.  <br>  <br>  basic fact is you are a mom now, you made your bed and you need to deal with it.  You shouldn't be out partying it up if you have a 10 month old at home.  special occasions are one thing.  This is why you don't have kids until a little later, when you are a responsible, mature adult and have had time to have your fun and get the craziness out of your system.  They are probably mad because it sounds like you had a kid out of wedlock.  well i would be very pissed at my daughter if she did that too.  <br>  <br>  point is, you should probably listen to those who are older then you.  They've been there and know whats best.  if they are a little overbearing then talk to them about it, but ultimately while you are under their roof it is their call.  don't move out for the wrong reasons.  they are probably raising your kid FOR you right now and that is a lot of stress on them too.|`|l43NSgHyaa	First, your mom doesn't have the right to say that your child's father can't see her.   It's actually against the law for her to do that.   The father has rights.   So, I would give the baby to her father on the weekends.  If mom has an issue with it, let her know that your ex talked to you about going to court and getting visitation rights.  I bet your mom won't be so strict about it, knowing that you could get in big trouble with the courts, for withholding visitation.<br>  <br>  Second, I would look into moving out.  However, you MUST start working full-time first.  With a baby, part-time work might not be enough to cover rent, bills, your needs and your baby's needs.   Plus, you have every right to work full-time and bring your baby to daycare.  If you're mom doesn't like it, then she can watch her!   But, she doesn't seem to be offering to do that, so daycare wins.    <br>  <br>  But, your mom can't physically stop you from going to work.   So, get working and save some money.<br>  <br>  Overall, your mom has some control issues.  But, put your foot down!  Tell her flat out about your plans for moving and that you WILL be obtaining a full-time job, putting your baby in Daycare and that her father WILL and has LEGAL rights to see her.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	move out.|`|UfOP3xtcaa	I know how you feel. If you think that you have your finances right, then you should move out. But i would not move out unless i had enough money saved up to pay at least one months rent. That way if you do run into trouble you have a back up plan that does not involve your parents.|`|mwSrzGwVaa	Put your foot down tell your mum your the mother of your baby. <br>  Or move out if you are that miserable.|`|DS21ekeJaa	Move out now before you totally ruin any relationship with your mom. If you are making decent money and you should also be receiving child support then go for it. Set up a schedule of visitation with your ex so you have time you can count on for yourself. <br>  If you decide to stay and save more money, put the baby in daycare while you are at work or make arrangements for her dad to watch her. Sit with your parents and let them know what you will be doing. They have the option of accepting your decisions and allowing you to stay or telling you to leave. Good luck!|`|w2lRPkYiaa	I think you should move out to gain back your sanity and your independence. You can still visit your parents when you need their help but its important that you both have your space! When everyones crowded in a house, it just builds the tension and that just a plain bad idea|`|pLS18YLwaa	Can you do it on your own?  <br>  <br>  Raising a child and working full time can be very hard.  I can see why you are frustrated.  Perhaps talking it out with your family may help. Try not to burn any bridges.  You are going to need them sooner or later.  Best of luck in your decision.|`|wlmdOxAuaa	If you're absolutly sure you can support you and your baby comfortably, then Yes.|`|arIB3BNVaa	you shoulve moved out years ago<br>  but MOVE OUT seriuosly lmfao<br>  seriously move out NOW!|`|nYORxiuaaa	Yeah, I would if I were you.|`|B66JN4NRaa	i sugest save then leave|`|UWx1beYtaa	If you do not feel you are ready to move out then you really need to talk to your mother.<br>  <br>  Tell her that she is the grandparent and she has no say in how you raise her just don't say it too harshly like I just did or she could push you away.<br>  <br>  As for the father, well every child needs both parents in their lives, you mother is too controlling.<br>  <br>  I think it is important that every child starts day care at a young age, I have a few friends who are stay at home mum's until their kids are 3 and they have really bad speaking skills but now that their in kindy they have improved dramatically. Day care is an important part of child growth, they learnt o play with other children, the are not as attached and not as relient on their parents, i.e. if you don't send you kid to school until their 4 then its going to be very hard for them to cope with out you.
vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  Just come right out  and say I love this song ( Would you like to Dance)|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	What is LPA? ~I LOVE DEREK|`|evCu7Ckvaa	- Does he play a sport? You can tie it into that. You can write on the ball (basketball, soccer, golf, etc) a message or spell out the message with them. It'd help if you knew the guys on his team also.<br>  <br>  - Make cupcakes to spell out "LPA?" and make a cute-looking note that says "It would be such a sweet treat if you went to Turn-about with me." Or get even a cookie pie/cake and write the message on it with icing.<br>  <br>  - Find a stuffed frog and attach a note that says "Out of all the froggies in the lake, you are the Prince I'd like to take."<br>  <br>  - Get a plain white t-shirt and on the front write "LPA?" Then on the back write a bunch of girls' names (probably ones that go to your school and that he knows of) with washable marker and write yours with permanent marker. Leave the t-shirt wherever he can find it with instructions telling him to run it through the washing machine to find out who his date will be. All the other names will wash off and yours will be left for him to see.|`|7oQ9eOCdaa	He might actually dig that you asked him out...and it saves him from actually doing the job of asking a girl to the dance.

c2NDhLnDaa	I have the same kind of relationship with my dad.. it never got better for me but you just learn to deal with it and not affect you anymore. The only thing that pisses me off, is when i see him using the same **** on my lil brothers and then I feel the need to intervene.. you just gotta be above it and not let it affect you growing up.. thats what I've learned from it.|`|mjDdy67Jaa	i have a bad relationship with my dad too, although he doesnt know about it. i keep it a secret.<br>  He always force me to do simple things and always doesnt accept no as an answer. simple things like doing stuffs my own way, etc.<br>  the most annoying thing he's doing to me is "pakialam", like my body for example. its none of his business. 'go to sleep early so you wont have pimples anymore' why? did i tell him that my pimples are a big deal to me?<br>  ****. next thing he wants to do is to pull out my bad tooth. why pull it out when it's still about 80% in good condition?  i know this is just a simple matter, but i really dont like people "pakialam" my body or my stuffs. i consider him as a dictator in my life lol.<br>  <br>  sorry, dont know the exact term for a local word 'pakialam'<br>  its meaning is "to pry into other peoples affairs"|`|utOVoGo3aa	I'm sorry for your relationship with your dad, Fathers are important and you are very lucky that you have one. Talk to him about this issue because its important, you need to rebuild your relationship with him because if you dont you will regret it in the fruture. I agree that he needs a job and that he tells you to shut up, but I know that he loves you, thats the only thing thats importa|`|TvGqrcr9aa	If you can stay calm and have a conversation with him about his behavior then try that. Maybe he doesn't realize how he's acting. Personally, I don't have the temper to have a calm conversation about something that pisses me off so I would get a job and help my mom and tell him that if he's so miserable here then he should go back to the old country and leave us the hell alone. <br>  Not the nicest thing to say but he's only making everyone miserable and sometimes brutal honesty is the best way to go.|`|V0iGdZDSaa	Be honest with him. Sit him down and say dad i love you but i can't do this anymore. I am sick of fighting with you and if you don't want to try and get along then i won't talk or acknowledge you anymore. Please i want us to still have a relationship and improve it. But this needs to change. be sincere and honest. good luck|`|UWx1beYtaa	Tell him how you feel, if he doesn't understand then to tell you the truth, he obviously doesnt care.|`|1xDA3lJmaa	dude i can totally relate.. im 16 and my father (i dont even feel he deserves to be called dad, and i even want to change my last name when im older and even my first name) drives me up the wall EACH f*cking day, starts off in the morning, and the second  he gets home. he does the same thing with asking me what is pissing me off from him, then telling me some bs after i answer it. only making me even more angry.<br>  <br>  only peacetime i get is at school and when hes not around. only difference is my father is a total jerk even with a job. my plans are to move out when im 18, get a loan my own place go to school and then join the police. its stability at age 20 and you wont need to depend on your parents.|`|655cc68ef8d7913644636e7bace4a60faa	WOW!!! he is obviously taking his depression out on u... have u spoken to mom about it, does she know how he is treating u?<br>  <br>  he is out of a job, he is home all day and his wife is the bread winner, talk about cutting a man's senses of him being a man... <br>  <br>  my advice to u is to talk to dad and let him know what is going on with u, if he starts to fite then walk away and wait for mom and ask her to mediate for u... don't both of u gang up on him bcuz he is already feeling down so just give her the rundown of what is happening and ask her if she can talk to him about it.  if she doesn't maybe u can talk to an uncle or one of ur father's closest frnd and see if that helps.  if he still is depressed then i wld advise asking him to go to a therapist, that may be ur best bet sometimes someone that is not close or involved in the family is easier to talk to.<br>  <br>  u need to let someone know what is going on, u r too young to try to handle this delicate situation by urself.<br>  <br>  hope this helps...<br>  God bless.|`|rwdc6mLNaa	Sometimes, when a person looses something they have trouble recovering and getting back in the game.  The wish of going back to the old country is just wanting to return to the familiar.  A time when he felt he had it all together, or when it seemed like a better time in his life when he was happier.  Not necessarily without you all but just a time of more control or with a better job.  Do this- take a little note and write <br>  Dad,<br>  I just want to say I love you, and things will get better.  Thanks for being my dad.  <br>  Put it in his hand or on the table where he can see it. He may not say anything to you about it, but you will have touched something in his heart and, maybe gave a shadow of hope of returning to the race of life.  Also Hats off to your mom, she is trying real hard to hold down the fort until the calvary arrives.  So do whatever you can to help make her job a little easier.  Do extra things around the house to show that you are trying to do your part in helping the family.  Mom will appreciate it alot.  Do not say anything smartalic like to give your father any reason to say your mouth caused any problems.  You will make a difference I promise.  If you don't see it now then you will see it later.  Watch for a brighter sun.  Hope I could help. If you need me look me up.<br>  Love Always  <br>  Aunt Tammy to all

If you have "disappeared" and she has had no contact with you in 7 years then she possibly got a court to give her full custody.  <br>  Go check with the county court house in her area to know for sure.  Go the family law dept and request anything in regards to her and the child. <br>  <br>  Good luck on your search<br>  <br>  (oh and shame on you for not supporting your child)|`|8G42oyydaa	Why do you want to see him? Its not as if you love him or give a rats a** what happens to him, or what kind of life he has with a dead beat dad who doesnt care if he eats or has a home. I bet you are one of those fathers who think they can come waltzing back into their childs life when they have "grown up enough to talk to and arent whiny little brats who need attention". <br>  <br>   I hope she can stop you.  <br>  <br>  Think of custody this way, if you had custody you would have actually had to put our some money to feed, clothe and house the child. <br>  <br>  Not something you ever wanted to do right? So yah I dont think it was hard for her to get full custody. You arent even aware of any court dates or appearances you never bothered to show up for?  <br>  <br>  Do the kid a favour and stay out of his life, he doesnt need a loser like you for a father. He's better off with no father.<br>  <br>  In Canada she would have custody, with or without you appearing in court this time. You dont show up in court - she wins, whatever she is petitioning for. Its a good system, stops dead beat jerks from disappearing and holding up the divorce and custody issues.|`|y21VcTjDaa	I don't know about where you live, but here, if you left, she would have de facto custody which is sole.

We know what the other girl is thinking! So to answer your question. . . Hell yeah I would have a problem if a girl did that to my bf, thats just NOT cool! Gay guys are (in general) more femine therefore its not as problematic as a young, hot horny lesbian feeling him up (and she could be bi you just never know). Gay guys immediatly fall into the friend catagory and most girls are not turned on by them . . .UNLIKE with guys! Guys tend to like lesbians, don't deny it! Hope that answered your question :)|`|j2qrOjo1aa	i am a lesbian so i am not closed minded to this...at least i hope i am not lol<br>  if a gay guy friend grabs my boobs or something i just laugh|`|ixyNeBhWaa	If both partners are ok with gay people touching them, then its ok.<br>  But if one person feels hurt, then there are trust issues to discuss.<br>  Maybe someone doesn't feel these people are actually gay, depending on what you see.  but all is left up to perception as to what someone might find Inappropriate.<br>  This is why both partners must discuss the whole physical touching and trust.

ajgC0KPhaa	I was alone with one of my lady friends at her house, so we decided to go to the TV room and watch a particular scary movie that I *knew* she hadn't seen (because she told me).<br>  <br>  She did everything that I expected her to do.<br>  - grabbing my sleeve, and eventually grasping my wrist<br>  - screaming<br>  - covering her ears and squeezing her eyes shut<br>  - hugging my arm, firmly<br>  .....And I just kept on telling her, "It's just a movie." - and she would say "I know, I know."<br>  <br>  I found it amusing.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AinzwVQsVwT.H1baqD3FS9Xty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090212210557AAl3UEa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  I read your answer. Thanks.<br>  <br>  .|`|RkzzBKxwaa	we wouldnt be watching the movie. we'd just mack on each other.<br>  <br>  <br>  thats what usually ends up happening :P|`|0BF25Md4aa	I expect her to act how she normally would. If you're wondering if guys expect the girl to be scared and the guy to swoop in and be comforting, then yeah most guys do. Most guys suck though, so you decide.
ATGXKT08aa	First off...why would you take a picture of it? Second, it doesn't really seem like something worth telling on...maybe just try to talk to him and let him know that that's what they made bathrooms for.|`|AA11649443	Uhm wtf y would u take a pic of it???<br>  thats messed up dude!!! <br>  dont tell on the poor guy i bet you masterbait to!<br>  next time show him to the bathroom!!|`|j0Fn8Fvoaa	he probably wanted you to catch him - next time offer to help him out|`|vHB9zUcCaa	if yer not sure what 2 do, u can consider letting the boss catch him. sooner or L8r he'll get caught.|`|E7TkNO00aa	If the poor guy is embarrassed enough, you should leave him alone. You seem like a pervert yourself for saying that yuo took a picture with your cell. Who's more of a pervert, the one doing it, or the guy taking the picture. Who died and let you be in charge? You should try to mind your business.
5nmFtzgqaa	There was an article in the latest issue of cosmo that guys, more often than not, think about other people when they're having sex.<br>  Reassure her that it's normal and that it doesn't mean anything.<br>  If anything, get her to read the article, it's really general and explains things well.<br>  It just kind of says that it doesn't mean the guy wants you any less, he just uses other people to stimulate him more.<br>  p.s don't mention that you think the supermodel is more attractive?<br>  that's really demeaning her and it's pretty rude to even mention that in the first place.|`|3i7oCQGaaa	omg dont get attached to the super models. look at them drool and then suck it up and go hang out with ur girl friend. give her 11 real roses and 1 fake one and a little not that says i will love you until the last rose dies. trust me any girl will want to take you back.|`|AQPdi1KUaa	1. don't tell her you think someone is hotter than her.<br>  2. you are allowed to have as many fantasies as you wish, if she doesn't understand that then tell her not to be so insecure.|`|dbQHlp85aa	you are a selfish pig and I hope she dumps you. <br>  <br>  I can't believe you even had the nerve to finish!!!|`|VWvI5RyBaa	You are in so much trouble, I can't imagine that you could fix it in a million years.  If she sees this question and the word gets spread, you might as well move far, far, far away.  After such an admission, no woman with half a brain would want you in their vicinity.  Good luck!  You will need it.  If you can't forget that Marissa model, you're only hope to ever be in a relationship is if you meet a woman by the name of Marissa.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	Wow...Usually guys say "It's not that I don't find her attractive, I just find the model attractive as well". But you find the model MORE attractive? And you just finished, left, and got coffee??!! She has a right to be angry with you. You screwed up. So if you were rich, you would date a model and not your current girlfriend? Just break up with her and masturbate to models. Give your girlfriend the chance to find someone who is actually worthy.|`|U53R1Bq0aa	Thats horrible! Sorry, but you really messed up! I think i would kill my bf if he called me somebody else...You need to be satisfied with your gf...If you are not then she needs to dump you and move on to someone else that loves her for who she is, and not imagine her being some fake supermodel!<br>  <br>  Guys these days! =(|`|FyqCMrCdaa	LOL just tell her that you feel she is just as pretty as her and that she makes you feel like the luckiest man alive! lol I often call my girl Erin(from "The City," MTV) and Audrina(from "The Hills") because she looks a bit like both. :)|`|yLTDUZIDaa	I like what you do...
ehtXVKyVaa	People make conections and are attracte/have feeling for many people throughout their lifetime. This ma overlap an existing relationship and that is okay. What is not okay is acting on these feelings behind your partner's back. If you feel like you need to be with this other person then you need to end your existing relationship before starting a new one.|`|ixyNeBhWaa	It is possible to be in love with more than one person, as long as they are different.  If you like someone who is similar to the person you are already dating then it means you are kinda messing with their feelings cause you are thinking about yourself and what you want out of a relationship, instead of thinking for the two of you.<br>  If these two people are alike, then you need to let go of one of them Now.<br>  <br>  But if they are different, then its ok.  As long as no sex is involved.<br>  But that's in my belief, that sex should be with one person if you are in love with them.|`|Gq7p05fzaa	you cant help having feelings, but what they lead to is what causes problems. and if you are a loyal partner in your relationship, you dont have to let your girl/guy know you have a crush.<br>  <br>  but if you love one person and are with another that you dont, thats wrong. for yourself and whoever you are with. it leads them along, and makes it worse when the truth finally comes out. <br>  if you arent loyal, dont drag along someone who loves you. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. dont be too quick to judge the hot kid that mightmaybe have smiled at you as "the one," and leave for/because of them. youll regret it. be smart.|`|33a82b8c3b2f36a4dcfce5e7a2076a2faa	I have a friend who feels the same way, and his feelings actually led him to CHEAT on the girl he was currently dating, and when she found out(which if you didn't know, they always do.) she AND the other girl dumped him.<br>  <br>  So be careful the choices you make when you have feelings like this, because they can lead to you having problems such as the one mentioned above.<br>  <br>  If your feelings get to the point where you just can't hold them in anymore, you should let your current partner know of these feelings, and they should understand. If they don't they were never meant for you to start with :P|`|nYswXPaRaa	It's a problem if you know that your feelings for that someone else are just going to grow but if you know that those feelings are just going to come and go soon, then don't worry about it so much. <br>  <br>  Cheating will be when you start to get intimate with that person which could even start with deep personal conversations.|`|Q4bB14Kcaa	no,only if ur feeling start to grow and u start hanging out with that other person and he/she have the same feelings that u do for that other person so if it gets to that point ur boy/girl friend will get jealous and they will think you r cheating<br>  <br>  i hope i helped|`|364Zj7yBaa	Dude u can have feelings for whoever you want, and thats not called cheating.  if u have a gf already be friends with the girl you have feelings for. i have a gf, and a lot of girls thats friends.|`|acyJryLZaa	You should always have loving feelings for your mom regardless of the relationship you're in ;)|`|mCF4wGjdaa	Quote:<br>  <br>  "You cannot love anyone fully without loving everyone at least a little"<br>  <br>  Unquote; Lazarus Long<br>  <br>  Blessed be<br>  <br>  Karma Singh|`|q7ZCycOTaa	As long as you don't act on them you're fine, you can't control how you feel|`|C8XiEzTzaa	well if you have feelings for someone else you might aswell say good bye-that some sort of cheating u can only not 2,so you have a make a choice i hoe this helped good luck|`|h3adDJ9jaa	It's a cheat.... :)<br>  I've been through that.!<br>  If you love your partner then you shouldn't be having feelings for someone else... <br>  I still didn't know what to do now... we have the same situation..|`|crCvwvQ8aa	nope perfectly natural!

If it's just a little crush that isn't acted on then that's normal but if you are drifting from your partner and wanting to pursue someone else then that's a problem. And no thinking isn't cheating...|`|YTKQDT7Zaa	If you have feelings for some one and your in a relationship.

sXB0N2jDaa	Not to be harsh, but no. I tried that, waiting/hoping for chemistry to bloom. To show up fashionably late. It doesn't. Sorry :(|`|W1T91aEcaa	If you think you might like him, then go for the second date. If you don't think that you'll be interested in him at all, then don't waste time. Sometimes it takes a few times before the chemistry starts coming up. But then again, sometimes it never shows. It's really up to you. Personally though, I think I would try for a second date.|`|3BfNshHYaa	no such thing as luv at first sight--- try to get to know him see for his personality then decide|`|wPABw3U0aa	yes try a second date. instant chemistry doesnt always happen. sometimes it takes time to build things and stuff and time to feel things for someone<br>  <br>  i mean think about it. havent you ever in the past been around a co worker or a classmate for months and never felt anything for them. and then BAM. after a while randomly you just find yourself drawn to them. attracted by things you never noticed about them or cared about. and then havent you had times when you first see a guy in your class or at your work and youre like WOW. you want them so bad but then it wears off after a little while.<br>  <br>  its kind of the same thing with the date,. you have to give things time. i suggest you just start hanging out with him more. dont call it DATES. just call it hanging out. chill out with him and get comfortable and get ti know him. dates are too stiff and fake. just hang out and become friends. thats the best way to find chemistry. GOOD LUCK|`|hjVZac9xaa	There's a book written by a female proffessor from UCLA in california, it's called The Female Brain.

I was visiting in Iowa of all places and I promised him a dance if he danced with my gf's mother. Then I chickened out cause he was shorter than I was.  I was in Iowa for heaven sake!  But he persued me in another state when I left him with my number.  Well that was 28yrs ago and three kids. So never say never. Even so I never went out on a date that I didn't decide where we were going, so my dates were worth while. Most men are at least mildly annoying, the ones with chemistry just know more about how to flirt and touch and kiss--the devils.|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	You're right there is no love at first sight.. but I believe in giving people a second chance too.  My boyfriend and I, didn't click at first.  We met at a party once, didn't talk for another month and a half, saw each other again, didn't see each other for another couple of weeks and then finally i asked him out to coffee just for kicks, and now we've been dating 4 years.<br>  Sometimes it takes a little longer for a person to come out of their shell.. or for that "chemistry" to appear.<br>  <br>  Go for a 2nd date, what's there to lose right?

po85q148aa	well my parents have been married 45 years.  :)  my dad is 11 years older than my mom.  when they met my dad was working at a gas station.  my mom was 18 my dad was 29.  my grandma (my moms mom) knew who he was and thought he was a nice young man.  well my moms car had broken down and my grandma asked him if he could pick her up and take her home after work until her car was fixed.  my daddy was more than happy.  my mom didn't really care too much for him at the time, but he had liked her long before that when he would see her at the gas station.  he really liked her in her skating skirt when she would come into the store after going to the skating ring.  LOL  so long story short ... he painted her name on the side of his car and she was ecstatic.  :)  so the story began and and here I am.  forty five years and counting for them (she's 63 and he's 74 now) and the greatest daughter they could ever have. LOL  oh and i forgot to mention they are still madly in love with each other and she still points out that gas station every single time we pass it.  hope you enjoyed.|`|b9c9041858524491c6a2d66f914cd0e1aa	My parents have been married 60 years. They met at a picnic. All the girls would bake a pie and the guys would bid on the pie. The highest bidder got to eat the pie with the girl that baked it. My Dad's brother actually should have been the one to eat the pie with her, but I guess my Dad bullied him out of it and the rest is history. My Mother was 16 and my Dad was 19 when they were married. Dad will be 80 in May and Mom just turned 77. They have six children, 9 grandchildren and 4 great grandchildren. My Dad has been through a lot this last year due to Peripheral Artery Disease and has lost both of his legs, my Mother refuses to put him in a nursing home.  I think this is what true love is all about. Too bad we don't have more of this today.

Thank you!!!!!!!|`|X7i59NeIaa	I guess I qualify as I'm 68, married and still in love. I met my husband the first time in a club. I was with a group of friends out for the evening to hear a band and dance. Well they cleared the floor for an exhibition dance and this guy came out on the floor. He was dressed in some wild looking clothes with a bandanna around his head. He began to dance and I became mezmorized. I had never seen any one dance like that before. It was just beautiful. I asked my friends who he was and said I have just got to meet this guy. Some of my friends knew him and later introduced him to me. We hit it off right a way. It was a very different thing for me as  I had been divorced for about 9 years and never thought I would ever meet anyone again. I had male friends but wouldn't date any one as I was afraid of getting hurt again. Well anyway we became friends and began doing things together. My daughter adored him and was always playing tricks on him. We have now been together for 31 years and there is no end in site.  I think that when you find the right one it just works out..

AA10604300	Persian parents are more aware than most western parents, about what happens to young girls who go out.<br>  <br>  Strict is better than loose morals<br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus wants you to have his free gift of salvation / eternal life, <br>  ask Jesus to forgive and save you of your sins, and then <br>  <br>  read about Esther in the Bible, <br>  and see how that the Persian king Ahasuerus favoured a <br>  beautiful girl who obeyed her strict uncle Mordecai<br>  <br>  Ahasuerus' wife Vashti was in Persia, but she favoured loose morals, and so she was rejected as queen, <br>  and replaced with Esther.<br>  <br>  It is your parents nation who historically know of Vashti who Ahasuerus rejected and married a Jewish orphan who loved God<br>  <br>  Jesus the Lord, is King<br>  You are to be like Esther and please the Lord Jesus,<br>  and in due time in heaven you will see that you will be honoured like Esther the Queen.|`|ZxYxB9jCaa	Hi.<br>  <br>  First off, I am Persian too!  My mom and I have a PERFECT relationship...?I LOVE her!!? <br>  <br>  So, about your situation... you should not want a mother that lets you do whatever you want...you want a mother to care about you and look out for your best interest.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you should try and understand why your parents are putting restrictions on you...they want you to be safe and not get into any trouble...they want you to have certain morals.  Also, you shouldn't be lying to your parents...there is no way your relationship will get better if you lie.  Another thing, in the Persian Culture, parents always treat their children like "children"...meaning that they are always looking out for them.  You should try and make your relationship better by listening to your parents...they have your best interest at heart...also, you shouldn't be making a big deal out of your curfew...LISTEN TO YOUR PARENTS :) <br>  <br>  Try to create a close bond with them, maybe then you will understand why they are placing restrictions...you could sit down and talk to your mother calmly...be like, "Mom, why can't I stay out later?" or "Mom, why...?" and so on...once you hear her explain it to you, you will start to see that she is right and truly cares for you.  Parents have experience, and they only want to help you. To be able to tell her everything, you need to build trust first...start bonding with her, ask her about her experiences growing up, and tell her what goes on with you at school, etc.  If you want to go somewhere, etc., just be like "Mom, can I go to...?" and if she says "No," then the answer is no. When you don't whine,yell,lie, etc., your relationship will be better and you will probably start getting more privileges, etc.<br>  <br>  Best Wishes.
r8MiItmpaa	ok, i totally get how you feel. im in somewhat similar situation. i am quite attractive with a slim and fit body, have a very high iq. people find me funny and very interesting as well as extremely kind and gentle. so far, i did attract few guys that i liked but this could never last. and till today i could not figure out what was the problem and where i went wrong. i dont have much time to waste as i am in my 30's and i want something serious to happen.<br>  you say you are bald and find it hard to deal with it? well, my best friend is a model (he used to be a model for shampoo and hair products). he had the most gorgeous hair any man or woman would dream about. few years ago, he was about to get married when his fiance was killed in a car crash. he was devastated and started losing hair and going gray. i have never seen anyone suffer so much. but what was he supposed to do? commit a suicide and forget that life has to go on? he decided to shave his head and wear it bald. i must admit that it looked weird at first but he learned how to live with it and continued with his life. it took a long time for him to start dating again because of everything that happened and because he lost his self confidence. from a great looking guy who was extremely attractive he became bald all of a sudden and lost so much weight. but, he learned how to use his new looks to his benefit and attract girls. sometimes you have to joke about the things you dont like about yourself. <br>  and you have to use it to your benefit. work on yourself. lose those few extra pounds, find the best look that suits you. believe me people will notice...and it is all about the attitude. if you feel positive and act that way as well as think that way, you will see the changes in your life. dont be so depressed and miserable. you can do it. respect yourself.
XmJZkFuMaa	Both believe in the Bible, both believe in the authority of the priesthood being necessary for ordinances like baptism, both have 'communion' or 'sacrament', both believe in God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, and both believe in the resurrection and second coming of Christ.<br>  <br>  Okay, so the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (mormons) believe there was an apostasy and that the priesthood was lost, then restored.  This is a major difference since the Catholic church believes the authority was passed down from Peter if I'm not mistaken, and the Mormon church believes it was completely lost through corruption and then restored.  Mormons believe in the Book of Mormon being another testament of Christ given to the people who lived in America at the time of his crucifixion.  Mormons believe in prophets, seers and revelators existing today, as well as apostles.  Mormons do NOT believe that God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit are one person, but that they are three individuals who are one in authority and purpose (a godhead, not a trinity.)  Mormons do NOT believe in Original Sin (ie, that a baby is born inheriting the sin of Adam.)  Mormons believe that until the age of 8, a child is innocent and will return to God without any baptism necessary.<br>  <br>  Mormons believe in the temple, and that couples can be married for eternity in the temple, and families can be sealed together for eternity.  They believe that there is no hell of fire and brimstone, only a stopping of progression.  They believe that there are three levels of heaven (main levels anyway) and that the highest level is where God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are, the second level is where Jesus and the Holy Spirit can go, and the lowest is where only the Holy Spirit can go (this is seen as merciful, since someone who is sinful wouldn't want to be near God who is perfect.) <br>  <br>  Mormons DO believe in grace, but also believe in works.  The bible says that faith without works is dead.  But Mormons STRONGLY believe that there is no amount of works you can do to get into heaven.  You do all you can, and then Jesus' Grace makes up the rest.  <br>  <br>  Those are the basic main ones that I can think of off the top of my head.  I'll include some sites you can look at to get more information.|`|AA10898823	You may want to re post this under religion.  you will probably get more educated responses.
PK5Elowdaa	Theres no better time for revenge than now! Sick her boy sick!! Good dog. I mean seriously she dated someone right after you. If you bring a girl around her, she can't say anything to you. I mean if you're worried about hurting her feelings, you shouldn't cause did she think about your feelings when she dated another guy? No. <br>  <br>  I've dated a ton of females.Im now 35. I've heard all their stories. They like playing games. For all you know, things could be going bad with this new guy she's seeing. This may be her reason for calling you. A back up plan? Well my friend, take it from me. Move on with  your life. Don't let them string you along for their own amusement. Go on with your life and if she comes running back and ask you to get back with her, thats fine.. At least she's made up her mind. But for now, there's no solid reason for her contacting you. If you like females playing with your emotions, go ahead and continue her games. But if you're ready to move on, brush her off slowly.

Now I've heard it all!|`|M4X3HOV5aa	why are you giving your ex money? if i was your husband i would be extremely upset. it seems to me like you still like your ex, which is why he asks for money cause he knows you still have feelings for him.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	You simply say "No". You really don't owe him a reason or explanation. <br>  <br>  If you want to soften it a little you could say "No, sorry, I don't have it to loan out"|`|X7i59NeIaa	Just say no, I'm sorry but I just can't help you any more, I have responsibilities of my own to take care of. If this ends your friendship then you will know that he was just using you all along.|`|dbQHlp85aa	why not be harsh? The guy obviously doesn't care enough about your feelings. Why care so much about his.. <br>  <br>  and i would strongly advise you to tell your husband before lending him any money. That's a lot of money to lend to someone. See how he feels about the whole thing.|`|RPhla0R7aa	Just say no that you are also going through financial problems and that you cant. Anyway like the girl below me wrote he doesn't deserve an explanation.|`|5klC4d4Paa	He asked you because he figured the worst that could happen would be that you say no, and the best thing could happen is that you would say yes...and he would probably never have to pay you back because you are "friends", he is in a tough spot, you have too much class to dog him for your money, your friendship is expendable, etc.  You are a safe bet..and bonus, his girlfriend would NEVER find out, because you live a long ways away and you don't talk to his girlfriend.  (I am sure his girlfriend wouldn't like him borrowing money from you either...and the "she would be stressed out" story sounds fishy to me.  It is more like he doesn't want her to find out that he hasn't been managing his money well or that he has none.)<br>  <br>  Of course, you will say 'no'.  You don't do such things behind your husband's back.  And you will not ask your husband, because you know he would never approve.  In fact, it would probably cause issues between you two, if you asked him, because your family needs that money and it shouldn't be used to bail out ex-boyfriends.<br>  <br>  And don't feel upset about your ex being less respectful to you than his girlfriend.  He is not building a relationship based on honesty with her, and that is not respect.  One day she will probably figure out who he really is.  You already know.|`|AA10776535	You just say no...You don't owe him an explanation why your saying no, that's silly.  If he wants to get his car fixed he will figure out a way...I would be very angry if let say my husband loaned money to some ex to get her car fixed, i would leave without saying goodbye.|`|AA11996507	So you had your "moment of clarity" earlier last year, when you finally realised what a free-loader he was, yet here you are still allowing him to use you?  Never mind about "breaking it down without being harsh", just end the so-called friendship.  It's a one-way street anyway.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	You were wrong to see him alone in his town to begin with <br>  <br>  You should consult your husband because the money is "joint" and this is a large amount.  If you loan out this much money without consulting him, you are making the 2nd mistake.  Therefore, the answer is that you cannot take out this much money from the FAMILY.  Where he goes next is really not your business.

If I do have feelings for her, I would have to muster up courage and then talk to her.  However, it really depends on my mood and how I happen to perceive the world that day.  I could just have a day where I just go up to her anyways.|`|yBnmqLZ7aa	Well, if he likes you and you approach him, he'll absolutely love that. Or, maybe by becoming a study buddy or talking to him about school everyday, he will begin to like you. Either way, you don't have much to lose. You're just asking him about homework, so its not like you're divulging every feeling you have for him (pretty harmless).|`|qigjzA77aa	100% if i liked her<br>  <br>  60% if i didnt like her but thought she was really hot and out of my league<br>  <br>  15% other|`|pFjgBBUZaa	well buddy the chances depends on you, but u for sure have a chance to continue the conv. some other day about the homework or etc. like you could ask her how you don't understand a problem and if she could help you? or you could ask her if she wants to study together for the coming up 'test'. if you do Like her then spending some time together will hopefully make you friends and then you could ask her out. if you don't like her then just give her what she asked for and just keep to friends :).|`|tZAgJpSNaa	Well if she just talked about classwork then chances got a lil bit high if i liked that girl, i wouldnt approach her much actually, but i would be confident to approach her to ask her about skool or if i could borrow a pen cuz i forgot mine at home lol<br>  If i didn't like her then chances are low, i would approach her if she was the only girl who had a spare pen or who could help me with school work lol|`|o716IHkHaa	chances of a very cute , cute  or average girl walking up to me about that would be 1% out of 100<br>  <br>  and im good looking and freindly but all the girls these days are taken , stuck up , evil , too full of them selves , jelous , etc. <br>  <br>  chances i would approach a girl in the future and ask her about class work will be<br>  85% out of 100|`|oXRZfAWaaa	If I liked her, I'd feel more comfortable talking to her in the future, and wouldn't be afraid to approach her first.  If I didn't like her, I *may* help with classwork, but I wouldn't approach her in the future.|`|k2jFRqATaa	if you dont like her<br>  you proboly wont talk to her first unless it has to do with school work or something else.<br>  <br>  if you do like her<br>  you have a high chance of talking to her in the future<br>  <br>  goodluck(:|`|1zfwLsQpaa	14% on a tuesday|`|lFzFtiCBaa	Depends on what you have for breakfast|`|RkzzBKxwaa	i answeredddd thisss ;)|`|acyJryLZaa	If you like her...<br>  - You should use the opportunity to make it happen.  When you answer her question find a way to followup.  "Let's compare the rest of the questions when we're done" ... or something like that.<br>  <br>  If you don't like her...<br>  - She may come back and ask again if she likes you.  Just be polite and treat her as a friend.  Can always have more friends in your life.|`|xoJcx0rFaa	if I were  a guy ...quite a good chance if if i knew her answer...and quite a good chance if i thought she had a potential good answer for me!|`|ROVExbzFaa	If i like her then i would...but if i didnt then probly not unless i really needed 2 lol...|`|QqxvBpUXaa	Do you wanna work together with me? =)|`|07HWkV4eaa	Real good, see I'm already starting to like you.|`|a9K4ZpOOaa	Your question is kind of confusing but ill answer it the way I think you ment to say it.  If i was a guy and I liked a girl, and wanted to talk 2 her about class work, the i MOST DEFFIENTLY would. lol. But even if i didn;t i still would probally ask. But im different then most guys in that sence.

HnEcgVGiaa	No! It's not your looks! You are great-looking! That's very bright smile!<br>  <br>  There could be something that you're doing something that you aren't aware of. Perhaps you don't want to get too close a guy. Perhaps deep inside, you are seeking for that one guy who's perfect for you.<br>  <br>  Don't change yourself to conform to what they are seeking. Just continue to be yourself. Someone will come along who will accept you for who you are. It seems like in your experience, relationships are done through trial and error. You are meeting different guys to see if the right one will come along. But don't let breakups let your give up on meeting that special someone. He will bound to come!<br>  <br>  But when you are seeking a relationship, make sure you get to know the guy first. Don't just jump into one simply because both you find yourselves interesting. Be observant. Is he a guy who can be trusted? Is he honest, faithful, and caring? Does he have the potential to be that special someone in your life? You must look before you leap.<br>  <br>  And be strong. If a relationship doesn't work out, get up, dust yourself, and move on. I'm sure there is at least one guy who will genuinely like you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|5ocCUojWaa	relax ull find someone just take it slow to go asking them on dates right away take some time to get to know them and then go out on a real date <br>  oh and its not ur look ur <br>  actually very pretty i would dat u  if u said yes to me
O31DgyGTaa	Hey there, I think that I may very well have gone down the same path if I didin't try to change. I'm 14, body image does kill things, but you've got to try and stay positive.<br>  <br>  Firstly, I tihnk you'll find it's unhealthy because you're nt happy, and that's not good. I know what you're feeling at, it's like there's nothing that interests you and your lfie is jsut so utterly boring and lifeless and you wish you could change it but you're not sure how. I tihnk you'll just have to TRY and let people in, TRY and jsut lsoe yourself, and have and take an interest in other people. Hopefully you'll realise that there is a lot of life, and you're missing out on it because you're not feeling up to participate. Don't let fear or anxiety or anything let you stop playing the game. Maybe you should do somethig unusual? take a holiday or go somewhere exotic to 'find yourself'. I'm sure you can become someone else if you leave everything behind for a while and just try new things.|`|aRWXUguQaa	I understand exactly how you feel I use to feel the same way depressed most of the time and leaving everybody out of everything im also a christian and make time to read the bible and pray i know that drugs can't solve anything but to make it worst nothing can top to commit suicide that's just awful I would never even think of such a thing like that.<br>  <br>  Nothings wrong with you - you just need to let in the people in your life that means the most and can help you.<br>  Go out go out and have a little fun don't keep your self isolated in your house it'll just make things worst that's what I did until i let myself be more freely and go out again always meet new people and keep yourself busy. I think it's great that you lost weight but it isn't right to be obsessed with your body just let yourself be and don't get to thin.|`|Smg9AjdXaa	you are very self concious and insecure. you should go to a professional for your depression. no offense. everyone has depression at least once in their lives but yours seems more severe. a therapist could help you, talk to you. because you shut people out that means you have no one to confide in right? a therapist could be the person for you. it is unhealthy some people are depressed to teh point where they will suicide. i hope you do not do this to yourself. if you can;t afford a therapist. im sure you have people who love you alot and are willing to help you and talk to you about your problems. goodluck =]

If your not then you'll never find the right guy to begin with. Trust me!!!! You'll worry to much about pleasing them when you should be making yourself happy! So there are times for a little bit of both. To fill you in though, the only type of guys you'll get being a huge flirt are the ones that aren't down for a relationship. They get ideas in there head like she's like this to me so she's prob. be acting like this with everyone else and they get the wrong impression. Well, I hope I helped.

My advice will be to find a sport that you are good at or practice.|`|0SQou2X9aa	Tell her this with a smile on your face.. 'am sure any guy would screw up like i did if they were  playing with a beautiful girl like u.well,unless they were blind.u cant blame me,look at u!?'   Trust me those words can change your life forever!|`|pNww5UC0aa	Well, it's quite normal to feel embarrassed because you didn't perform very well when you were playing basketball infront of her. Just relax. There will be other opportunities to play basketball again. It wasn't the last game you'll ever play in your life. Persevere. :). Show her you know how to play.|`|OUwyHduraa	Aw...I'm sorry, man.

I doubt that she is even thinking about how bad you played right now while your stressing out!|`|qIEhu6uxaa	well to be honest, high school girls will get turned off by someone who tries something and doesnt succeed because they're shallow like that.  so don't play again!  now do something you're successful at in front of her.  make a joke about it, say something like, "now if only i could play basketball as well as i could solve math problems!"|`|3WeAfZNraa	Don't worry. The girl would care less if you can't make a shot. Just make it fun and tease her a bit. Play one on one. Girl wouldn't pay attention to the fact that your missing shots as long as you have a good personality and your having a good time.|`|RnQFwIuUaa	It is normal to mess up around a girl you like. Does she know you like her? If she does, she understands why you are nervous. Try to take some deep breaths next time to help with the butterflies.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	Well what are you good at, play with advantages not disadvantages<br>  <br>  oh and dont kill urself over it|`|ZCEMQ8ARaa	How good you are at sports shouldn't matter. She should like you for your character not if you could make hoops. Don't be sad, if she likes you for you, then she won't care. Take care babe :)|`|IK5PoN4Laa	Don't try to act macho.  Admit you aren't the most talented basketball player.|`|xBXwKBuZaa	play football!!!! its a real mans sport and shed love watching you play.|`|LguXFbvsaa	Why would you play basketball with her if you're so terrible? Listen - you were probably nervous, and she could probably tell. That's not the end of the world. Just try to display some talents and skills that you are exceptional at... most women want a man who they respect and admire... who have ambitions and strength of character, etc., etc. Talent is a turn on, but you don't have to be a jock. I couldn't care less if a guy was good at basketball, if he was, say, the best mathematician, or singer, or speaker. Don't stress about it - you'll only make yourself that much more self-conscious the next time you're around her... and that is certainly not going to help you win the girl. <br>  <br>  Try to be confident and nonchalant. I know it sounds like cliche advice - but it's just such good advice. Good luck, hon.|`|tZAgJpSNaa	You don't know how to play?<br>  <br>  Well first you could possibly be a loser, probably try to take off the butter off your fingers? could help you dribble and catch the ball better.<br>  <br>  Learn to play basketball or tell her you suck hairy donkey balls at basketball and ask her to teach you, it could probably get things between you and her really good if you know wat I mean, but remember to alwayz use a condom.|`|IHK2suw7aa	Haha! No you could totally make this to make you look cute! Next time your talking to her, and there are other people around be like "heyy remember that time you creamed me in basketball?? hahaha. you were amazing. i on the other hand......" then ask her out. after you've dated a while be like "yeahh... so i suck at basketball... and i dont really like it... but i wanted to play so i could hang with you.....haha but i totally made myself look like a fool!" and she will react with something like "awhhhh! no you didnt. thats so sweet though!"<br>  good luck :]|`|3i7oCQGaaa	okay girls dont really care for super athletic dudes. if she dosn't like you beacuse you can't shoot a ball then too bad for her. make a joke out of it. like hey it takes some real professionalism to shoot a ball like  that. or my favorite WOW all of this not running is killing me i need some water!|`|Lq1p2aKpaa	oh well.. that's a natural feeling of failing to impress your crush..<br>  maybe you weren't giving your full concentration in shooting the ball because you were too conscious of you self.. next time,stay calm..relax.. focus on the game.. just remember that your crush is watching and you have to give your best otherwise you'd gonna make up another impression again.. <br>  well..what has happend has happened..therefore dont bother yourself much about it.. bother yourself on how you can earn again her impression.. okay.. goodluck. :)|`|loqsl5xXaa	lol, u were playing to have fun. no big deal..i'm sure she didn't think anything of it. you know despite what everyone thinks, girls aren't easily impressed and some just don't care about things like that. Just play something you are really good at invite her if you are really feeling like you need to redeem yourself..|`|63tch8D5aa	haha aww,<br>  you sound young,<br>  <br>  correct your grammer before you plan on writing her a love letter ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  anyways,<br>  <br>  i m sure michael jordan or magic johnson sucked at basketball before they became pros or maybe even sucked at a pro game,<br>  <br>  <br>  cheer up<br>  <br>  :<br>  :)|`|FyvrWG6laa	Huh?! how can playing basketball be embarrassing? what about your team and the coach? It is supposed to be teamwork so why are you suffering? if playing basketball is not your game, i suggest you play gulf instead. am i making sense here?|`|MpTgh6MMaa	that happened to me too! if people bother you about it dont let it show that it bothers you, it'll pass. <br>  <br>  that's very cute though<br>  <br>  OoO if you want, tell her that it was cuz her presence there made you mess up. girls like compliments!|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Just accept that basketball is not your thing. <br>  <br>  As well as if you actually are pathetic enough to try and impress her, do it with something you are good at. Thats just common sense man.|`|07HWkV4eaa	Hey man it happens. You were probably just too nervous, I did that once and felt like shooting myself. It gets better, just relax.|`|KGz62rW0aa	I wouldn't worry about it.  If she judges you by how well you play basketball, then she'd be pretty shallow.|`|Q5hVEyfoaa	You will be alright! good thing you didn't show off girls don't like that either...Lol|`|jxcXVRDuaa	AN HERO|`|NSwkUNb1aa	cute, dud, cute...calm down I'm sure she'd understand if you told her you had a crush on her and that is what screwed you up....right?|`|0YyKdGETaa	DUDE DON'T TRIP. first rule just because you arn't better then her probably makes her feel better about herself. basketball isn't everything.|`|ntxLR2tDaa	enjoy the game.... play for urself not to impress anyone....dont make big out of it.....
NxHExauOaa	Don't every tell a woman that you love her if it isn't true. I personally, was just in a long relationship. I was deeply in love with him, and he had told me he loved me as well (he told me first). But then he was so quick to get rid of me as soon as something went wrong and it got a little hard.... I think the break up was a million times harder on me because i actually believed he loved me. It really sent me into a downward spiral. Don't lie to her. It will only hurt her in the long run. If you care at all, you will wait until those feelings are really there. Also, she seems a bit clingy and seems to want more out of the relationship than you do (i.e eventually move in/get married.) If you are not at all ready for that then you truly need to let her go. You are only leading her on... (my guess if for sexual reasons. but hey, what guy doesn't do that). What's the point of being in a commited relationship if you don't want something more out of it? You would be better off single.<br>  <br>  sorry if that seemed harsh!|`|Q4bB14Kcaa	don`t lie i think 9 months isn`t enough i dated my now husband   for 3 years until he told me he loved me and i was patient but ur girlfriend is probably moving to fast in my opinion  sense i waited for the 3 special words|`|D4fucNxeaa	why are you with her if you do not love her? Sex? I do not get why women give them selves up like that.|`|AA11280073	She is desperate and will not stop. End it now. Why string her along if you have no love for her or no interest in marriage?|`|DTGO1pgyaa	I am 20 and a female just to start. If you have a reason to not say "i love you" which you clearly stated, then she should respect that. your reason is good enough for you and shouldn't have to be explained as to why you wont tell her you love her. you are an honest person and it's good that you're sticking to it. If she knows you are not being honest if you say those words, she might just be looking for hope in you actually falling for her enough to truly love her or something else like closure to something confusing she's thinking about possibly a break up. In all reality, you are not being mean, you're being honest. SHE doesn't hear what she wants and now YOU'RE mean? no. There should be meaning behind "i love you" and if there is not, what's the point of saying it?|`|2La87Gw1aa	she.. sounds like a freak.<br>  a freak that's desperate for attention.<br>  Don't lie. Even if it makes her happy when / if you lie, you'll feel bad about it afterwards. And even if it does make her happy, the happiness probably wont' last long anyway|`|s967PhGhaa	Tell Her That You Aren't Ready, And You Really Care For Her But Don't Love Her.|`|NbmnWwqEaa	Why are you with her, then? Sex?<br>  Break up with her now . . . why be truly mean (cruel) and drag this out any longer. You can find sex anywhere, why make this girl suffer and spend the next few months or years trying to get you to change . . . <br>  <br>  Sadly, like many women . . . she thought her love would change you. And I wish she were asking the question about "getting her guy" to say 'I love you." I'd tell her to kick you to the curb before the sun rises this day.<br>  <br>  She deserves a man who loves her wholeheartedly . . . <br>  A man she doesn't have to ask to lie to her . . .<br>  A man who loves her as she is, for all she is . . . <br>  A man who wants a future with her . . . <br>  <br>  And anyway, we like to hear nice/pretty things ONLY if they are true, sincere. As much as she says for you to "lie" to her -- she is just hoping you will change.<br>  <br>  That is wrong of her . . . and it is just as wrong of you to stay with her out of pity or for the sex. For that is a lie, too.<br>  <br>  You, obviously, feel, at some point you will break up. If you're going to be a "player" or drop her when someone "better" comes along -- you are just a jerk! Because she deserves the truth . . . <br>  <br>  If you're only with her because she's good in bed . . . shame on you!<br>  <br>  A relationship is about two people wanting the same thing . . . and to grow together. You refusal to find things to love about her tells me you have no relationship, anyway.  Lying is poisonous and hurtful; and you're doing it by being with a woman you do not love. <br>  <br>  Again, why are you with her if you have no intention of marrying or loving her? You said "set her up for a hard crash of depression when we break up?" tells me and every woman; you have no intention of staying with her, anyway. Why are you with her? I don't get it.|`|uJ9waJDYaa	I get you. She needs to understand, she is just being an immature high school girl, i think you need to tell her something like this,<br>  <br>  It has only been nine months and that is not a Very long time, and I love you is a very powerful and meaningful words when you say it to someone your in a relationship with and you shouldn't just say it to anyone you are in a relationship with because if you say it to everyone you do or have dated it becomes meaningless and how does the person you are with know it is true and that you really "love" them.<br>  People throw around "I love you" way too much and it seems to mean nothing these days. I think it should only be said when you are sure you really, really do love that person and think you may even spend the rst of your lives together.<br>  <br>  And pff 'girls want to hear pretty words' I think if a girl uses that as an excuse to get a boy to tell her they Love her she is a childish idiot and taking advantage of what it means, You don't say it cos it sounds pretty, you say it because what it means. I dont think it would sound Pretty it you didn't really mean it.<br>  I hope she understands, otherwise you might have to just tell her that you love her too or you should break up and find someone you really do love.<br>  <br>  Good luck.
BLsdUBfIaa	WOW!! YOU HAVE GOT ALOT OF ANSWERS HERE!!!!<br>  <br>  HEY OVER HERE!!! READ MINE READ MINE READ MINE  READ MINE!!!!!!<br>  <br>  LoL, ok so now that you've actaully stopped to read this I REALLY think you should read what I have to say!!<br>  <br>  What ever is typed in here is explaining why your girlfriend asks you those questions!! Why women need sweet words and other things!!<br>  <br>  TRUST ME!!!!<br>  <br>  I know its a fricken LONG one, but bear with me you might find some answers!!!<br>  <br>  I've been reading these answers and most of them say dump her, get on with your life, or something like why don't you love her after 9 fricken months?!?!<br>  <br>  Well, just to tell you, these are other people's opinion's on what they see and read. they don't REALLY know what's going on between you and this girl of yours!!!<br>  So in my opinion weed out all the ones that sound like they don't know what they're talking about!!<br>  <br>  And to answer your question, no of course you shouldn't lie to your girlfriend.That's the worst thing you could possibly do, but you ask why women want sweet words??<br>  <br>  Women need sweet pretty words to make themselves feel NEEDED or WANTED!! To make them feel safe or know who they are and where they stand in a relationship. That's what most women need in a relationship. Well in most relationships!!!<br>  <br>  Some woman only have relationships for the benefits or express little or no feelings towards their partner!!<br>  <br>  Let me add and say that the boyfriend doesn't tell their girlfriend they love them.<br>  <br>  The girlfriend will start to wonder why her boyfriend hasn't said it. Then she'll maybe thinking about what she might've done to cause her boyfriend to not say I LOVE YOU yet. Or maybe she'll be thinking that you haven't said i love you to her because you really don't love her and that you are just using her for your own benefits!!<br>  <br>  In your case I think that your girlfriend feels INSECURE!!! She knows that you don't want to get married, but when most women are in relationships they often want to feel wanted or needed. That's why she is always asking you whether or not you LOVE HER or NOT!<br>  She needs to know that you do care for her, or think she's special.<br>  <br>  BUT don't keep saying the same thing because she'll think YOUR lying!!<br>  If your TIRED of saying things like this to her, like saying shes special, or that you care for her. Maybe you could do things for her to SHOW her that you do care for her!!!<br>  <br>  You don't have to do anything BIG for her!! Most guys think about BIG surprises when they have to show their affection. <br>  <br>  LET ME TELL YOU, woman LOVE the LITTLE things that men do for them! Like waking up early to take her out for breakfast or making breakfast for her. Or buy her a small gift (doesn't have to be expensive or anything) just for the heck of it, out of the blue. Or even just keeping her close to you no matter what for a whole entire day.<br>  <br>  The little things you do actually count MORE than the BIG things you do for her.<br>  <br>  WHY?<br>  Because it shows that you are thinking about her every day and you DO care about her. And if you still don't understand,,,, then just trust me. Sometimes you don't NEED to understand things that make your girlfriend happy!! Just try it out and you'll see that she'll stop asking you whether or not you love her.<br>  <br>  You have to understand this about women if your going to date one!!<br>  <br>  WOMAN ARE NOT LIKE MEN!!!! <br>  <br>  If you tell a WOMAN she's fat, she cries or gets angry. When only your telling her the truth because you care about her and don't want to lie.<br>  <br>  If you tell a MAN he's fat, they'll brush it off and get the sense that your joking or they just don't care. <br>  <br>  WOMAN on the other hand, I REPEAT are SENSITIVE!!!!!!!! They'll take things more personally, remember that!!<br>  <br>  NOW REMEMBER THAT THE NEXT TIME YOUR GIRLFRIEND ASKS YOU IF YOU LOVE HER OR NOT!!<br>  <br>  TALK ABOUT IT<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you actually DO take my advice, talk to her. <br>  You may think that talking about it may not help but IT DOES!!<br>  <br>  IF YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT IT?<br>  <br>  Well, your saying that you don't want her to get depressed right? She'll GET depressed soon because your not talking about your feelings/problems to HER!! If you don't talk about it sooner or later, IT'LL END WITH A BAD ENDING!! TRUST ME!!<br>  <br>  WOMAN'S ANGER<br>  <br>  Woman don't talk about things that really bother them out right there right now. Their anger BUILDS!! Until suddenly they can't take it anymore and explode at you!! <br>  <br>  WHY DON'T THEY TALK ABOUT IT<br>  <br>  Women usually don't want to talk about something the guy did wrong because they're afraid they will hurt their boyfriend's feelings or sense of pride!<br>  <br>  REMEMBER TO THINK<br>  <br>  Remember to think about WHY YOU don't say I LOVE YOU to her. Not just because you don't love her, that's not going to be good enough for her or for you. THINK HARD and really think about WHY you REALLY don't feel that you don't love her!! <br>  <br>  THINK BEFORE YOU DO<br>  <br>  Think about why you do the things you do for yourself, and why you do the things you do for her. Think about what you want to talk to her about, and why!! THEN talk to her. If you don't have a straight HEAD on your shoulders, while talking to your girlfriend, then nothing is going to happen. You'll just be running around in circles like cat and mouse!!<br>  <br>  WHAT DO YOU TALK ABOUT<br>  <br>  Talk about how your not ready to say it, or you don't want to say it. What ever you want to talk about always ALWAYS give a reason why, for whatever reason. BIG or SMALL!!<br>  If you don't give her a reason, then she REALLY won't understand why you can't say it. ( TRUST ME, she still won't understand why until you give her a reason!!!)<br>  <br>  GIVE A REASON WHY!!! ALWAYS!!!<br>  <br>  oh and if you still have QUESTIONS e-mail me for sure!!I'll help you out with ANY kind of problem!!<br>  <br>  babikrystalrose@yahoo.com <br>  <br>  (remember to tell me who you are though i get ALOT of junk mail)|`|ghXH7JZRaa	Tell her that you care a lot for her , but you are not in the place yet where you feel like you are in love. If she can't wait for the relationship to mature and for love to develop naturally, then maybe you should end the relationship since she is not mentally in the same place as you are and would rather have you tell her something that in your heart you know you do not feel and she knows you do not, just to satisfy her own selfish needs.|`|EV14IuG9aa	if u dont love her whats the point of being with her men, the sex might be good but is it really worth it? she's gon get pregnant and then u'll be saying i love u faster than u can say sit down. leave her, simple, if u dont love her, DONT BE WITH HER...|`|pcI25NXzaa	Sometimes it takes a long time for someone to get to a point where they can say they love someone. don't listen to these people who say you shouldn't be with her if you don't love her. explain to her that you're just not ready yet. IF you can see yourself getting to that point then tell her that, and if you can never see yourself getting to that point, you might want to either break up with her or idk try to phrase it in some way that will let her know you care, but you're just not sure right now or something.<br>  <br>  Definitely don't lie, esp about stuff like this. You don't want her to freak out and get all pissed if you end up breaking up with her just cause you "told her what she wanted to hear". If it's not true def don't say it. Good call.|`|qf0kuMCiaa	I don't know about you want I would want someone to tell me the Truth then a big lie.  Saying I love you means a lot to a person. I don't think it should be a game you really could mess up a person life by lying to them, so your doing a good thing keep it real with her tell her you care about her ,you do right?  Have you ever been in love before?|`|GHc87m6caa	my answer is think properly how to ignore her from this satisfaction.but don't let her to cross the line.|`|yKZQoLDoaa	I am 27 years old and have been through 2 serious relationships and I am currently in my 3rd one.<br>  <br>  It feels good to a women for a man to tell them that they love them, you don't have to be in love with her. But telling her you love her is just basically a friendly gesture. You could say "I love you" as a friend or boyfriend. It doesn't mean that you are in love. <br>  Now, if she takes it like you are in love with her, just sit her *** down and tell her that you are not ready for that, and if she can't respect that then you need to move on. Because to me, she would be acting immature...but 9 months, you can say "I love you" it's okay.<br>  <br>  Who knows, your relationship might get better.<br>  <br>  And...last but not least...you have had plenty of time to figure out if you like or love this person, if you don't love her by now....why are you with her still? <br>  It is not nice to drag people along, and since she is buggin so much you should make the first time you tell her you love her to be really special, considering it is past Valentines' Day (Which I would personally have dumped you if you didn't say your *** love me!) LOL<br>  But since you past that special time up, maybe tell her you love her (Romantically, not at McDonalds' during lunch, or in the middle of the Mall or in the bathroom while your peeing!) LOL<br>  <br>  Just maybe do it on her birthday or take her somewhere nice during the summer one day and tell her love her, and look at her when you do!<br>  <br>  Okay that's all the advice my fingers can handle, good luck bro!|`|CHUDVsbEaa	Not really considered your girlfriend if you don't love her just a booty call|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Dont give in man, dont let her have that satisfaction.|`|QoWi0hzWaa	dump her,|`|qpAl6EGTaa	y the **** r u going out with her|`|48HKDSR0aa	Okay so you don't love her but she wants to hear it?<br>  I know that I would love to hear a guy say that he loved me, but then again, I know it wont mean as much as coming from a guy later in my life who I am wanting to marry.<br>  In a way, saying it is just three silly words, and in another way it could mean a lot.<br>  <br>  You've been with her for only 9 months and I don't know how old you are but maybe you are not at the whole marriage-age yet.<br>  <br>  Just tell her that you believe those three words are really special and that you don't want to say them like they mean nothing. Explain to her that you two have been only together for 9 months and that you don't want to say yet just yet and that when you are ready to say it, that she can expect that you REALLY mean it.<br>  <br>  if you just dont really like her, maybe you should consider ending it?<br>  sorry, you just didn't seem to like her too mcuh|`|Bh259vTjaa	No, don't lie to her. You just need to talk to her about it. Tell her that although she is ready to say that, that you still aren't. You do seriously care for her and like being with her, but that you just need to move slower. Tell her what you believe comes with the word "LOVE". Its been soooo overused in this culture that I don't think we truly understand what it means anymore.<br>  I'm soooo happy to know there's a guy like you out there who takes it seriously and isn't going to throw the words to any girl. :) <br>  Just talk to her about it. She should understand.|`|DdfoawNCaa	Explain to her that at this point in the relationship you still haven't established if you love her and you would rather not say it than to jeopardize the relationship by telling her a lie.  Instead see if she would be willing to be in a like/care relationship.  For example, instead of saying I love you, say I like you or I care for you.  Do this until you can figure out if you do indeed love her.  If she is unwilling to compromise, maybe she's not in the relationship for the right reason.  Maybe she's just in the relationship for justification and the desire to hear someone say that they love her.  Hope this helps.|`|I2WKO33Maa	If you don't love the girl much better if you will broke up with her, your girlfriend was expecting that you love her that's why you commit with her if you don't have plans to get marry in the future it will be better if right in this moment you find a girl who also doesn't believe in marriage, in that way both of you will not get hurt when the time comes that you have broken up..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://FreeTryAcai.com/blog" rel="nofollow">http://FreeTryAcai.com/blog</a><br>  <a href="http://laxativesandweightloss99.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://laxativesandweightloss99.blogspot...</a>|`|QETSv98Haa	Love- what an evil word! That four letter word gets tossed around too easily. Honestly I don't think it's wrong that you don't feel as if you love her at the moment and you don't want to lie to her! Love grows, it's  not just something that is automaticaly there. Different people have different ideas on what love is and based on your question I don't think you have found out what love means to you personally. You need to sit her down and explain what you feel about saying I love you to her and if she doesn't understand you both need to move on.|`|QgxCbEk5aa	As a 21 year old female, I think it's perfectly fine if I guy does not say "I love you" to me. Why? because two persons in a relationship did not grow up with the same parents in the same home and environment. Their actually complete strangers with one thing in common, and that is attraction for each other. Now...attraction for each other is just a natural mechanism that nature gives us so we could be able to share a intimate bond with another. "Love" on the other hand is just a social construction, meaning a term used to express your greatest liking for the other. Please! how would one know how to love if they never experienced the lovey dovey atmosphere in their childhood days, how can that person say "I love you" to a complete stanger if their not used to saying those 3 words. Therefore, you do have a right to not say "I love you" and if she does not understand, tell her "Actions speak louder than words." Good luck sweetie.|`|W1T91aEcaa	Wow. Just so you know, you sound like a major jerk! Why are you wasting her time if you don't love her. I wouldn't consider a 9 month relationship casual by the way. As soon as she says she loves you, it's no longer casual. She's not asking you to tell her that you're IN love with her. She just wants to hear you say that you love her as in, you care deeply for her. If you DON'T care deeply for her, then why the hell are you with her? You're just stringing her along and guess what? That IS mean!|`|g6N5gkBwaa	definitely do NOT lie to her.... you can just tell her that you are unsure of your feelings for her. it isn't that you don't care about her, but you aren't really sure what love is. and tell her that she doesn't really want you to just say it, that when *and if* you are ready to tell her you love her, she will know that you really truly mean it, and it will be that much more special. <br>  <br>  good luck to you|`|iFSJteceaa	How old are you and your girlfriend?  You are so right though.  Don't lie to any girl about whether you love her or not.

People these days through those words around all the time without any Real meaning attached to it.<br>  If you two have been dating for 3 years.. then say " I love you " but come on, you have only been dating for 9 months, its not even a full year yet.

That's just selfish.  It's about more than her just wanting to hear pretty words, she wants to know that you feel the same way about her as she does for you.  If you don't and don't think you ever will then the only decent thing to do is break up with her and let her find someone that does love her.   She deserves to have her feeling reciprocated and we all want to be loved - including you (I bet you like the fact that she says she loves you).<br>  <br>  If you don't love her let her go...|`|KW7iy8ZEaa	Everyone who answers this is dumb. You dont have to love someone to date them. Ive been with my guy 3 years, were happy, BUT NOT IN LOVE. I would never want to hear it if it werent true, and if youve told her you dont, and she doesnt get it, then thats her problem. Say it, and then DUMP HER A WEEK later....teach her a lesson.....how old is she 13?
T3BXC8qXaa	1) Check to see if this man can still be prosecuted. Your mother was insane for not reporting this. Imagine if you report it now, how many other girls you might save from the same fate!<br>  <br>  2) Tell your husband. You shouldn't keep things like this for this very reason. <br>  <br>  3) Calm your husband down when he takes off to kill this man.....I know that would be my husbands reaction.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Very difficult situation.  Sorry for you.  You are 100% right to want to prevent this relationship between your husband and the rapist.  You can likely do it without full disclosure.  Something along the lines of "I have really bad history with him which I don't want to discuss.  But could you please stay away from him.|`|8G42oyydaa	Tell him, if it comes out later he is going to wonder why and be upset that you didnt.  This is not something you want to keep from him, If he knew he wouldnt want to associate with this man. <br>  <br>  He's a man, YOUR man, he isnt going to act like nothing happened when you tell him !  And go to work everyday with this guy, that is asking too much. DONT ask him to do that.<br>  <br>  Be prepared for him leaving the job, but there are other jobs, this is more important. I am sure the stress of keeping your secret is going to have an impact on your marriage.  If you find it hard to tell him ask your Pastor to be there and assist you.|`|dbQHlp85aa	Your mother was wrong for not reporting it. But you really should tell your husband. <br>  <br>  He is your best friend.. your partner.. your confidant. <br>  <br>  He might be upset that you haven't told him before but, he will not focus on that right now. <br>  <br>  Have you seen this man in person recently? Does he know it's you or who you are?|`|CD5JsjxKaa	oh my god!! you must be the worlds sweetest soul. if i were you, even if a million years had passed, i wouldn't let my husband (or anyone else i loved for that matter) within a thousand mile radius of that bastard unless they were armed with baseball bat and meeting him for the sole purpose of smashing him. <br>  honey, you have EVERY right to not want your husband to be friends with him. do not for one minute think that that's asking for too much. if it were me i'd get my husband to quit and move!! but you're stronger than me. you NEED to tell your husband. if you think he'll be upset in ANY WAY then you're wrong. he'll love and cherish you only more. OF COURSE it's not going to matter in that way, he'll only want to protect you more fiercely and i'm not going too far to say that he'll probably want to bash that guy's face in for doing what he did to you. your husband is going to be fiercely loyal and supportive of you. you need to be open and vulnerable to him, he's your husband. he loves you. if anyone will understand it's him. trust him. this will only make your marriage stronger. good luck honey!|`|ghz5D5iLaa	Yes you need to tell your husband. Telling him this should not ruin your marriage. If it does then you don't have much of a marriage. Tell him the truth. You thought that you were over it and could forget it until now. You also did what your mother told you to do over it and you were just a child. This is not something that you just forget and get over. Some people don't even function the same after wards.|`|AA11391968	It's understandable that you need to tell your husband now.  He is working with this man.  It was your choice as a child to remain silent or prosecute.  I am sure your husband will understand.  Unless your husband is violent.  Do not tell him when he is due into work.  Tell him a a free weekend of something.|`|H652tDkyaa	TELL HIM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... DO YOU WANT THESE 2 TO END UP BEING BUDDIES|`|AA11124905	Your mother was wrong for not reporting it years ago. Although it may be hard I personally feel that you have to tell him. It has been 11 years and if it hasn't gone away buy now it won't be going away anytime soon considering your circumstances. My advice to you is to tell your husband and seek counseling. I will keep you in my prayers. Peace and God bless.|`|SS5py9jIaa	I know pretty much how you feel... similar "secret" for 40 or so years. And you are right to be very upset about this situation you are now facing, but it's worth a good cry to tell someone you trust... you will just have to get used to that idea if you tell him. <br>  <br>  Also, no doubt your husband might do something regretful when he learns of this, so for his sake, you need to be very careful how you approach this subject with him. You could simply say that something horrible happened to you all those years ago, that you were raped. Start from there. You needn't tell him more unless you are ready. The news will upset him more because he is powerless to make things right for you than because you havent told him everything. But telling him everything still will not fix it as you know.<br>  <br>  As for the rapist... on a separate occasion tell your husband tht the dude gives you the creeps... you might tell him why.. or choose not to.. up to you at the time.. but give your man a chance to digest a little information at a time.<br>  <br>  It isn't too late to report the rape... but on your word alone you are unlikely to get a conviction against him... not enough evidence. However, he may have other victims... waiting... wondering, worrying, dreaming.. who might also come forward. Hugs. (Oh, you should know that whatever you choose to do, you're extraordinarily brave)|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	The only way to get over this is to talk about it to someone i was raped and i had big problems with sex. I was very young when it happened to me. My husband always wondered why i wouldn't let myself go sexually and i told him what happen to me. I felt so much better by telling him and it made him understand why i was so frigid. It took me years to get over what happened to me and i did finally open up to my husband sexually. I finally realized that i was letting what happen to me control me it was time for me to take control of my own life. When i told my husband what happened to me he wasn't mad or angry that i waited so long to tell him. Tell your husband you will feel so much better when you do it's like a big weight being lifted off your shoulders. I'm not so sure you should tell him who it is but that's up to you. When i told my husband who raped me he wanted to kill him so just be careful because your husband will want to go after him or at least say something to him about what he did to you.|`|iD4ejChZaa	Your mother is [or was] out of her mind, that is why you are like a double victim, first the rape of a virgin, a child, then there's no closure, no punishment, he is a criminal, it wasn't up to your stupid mother to decide what is a crime and what isn't. The legislators decide this.<br>    You need to face this, face this now, she should have given you the strength, the wisdom to put a pedophile behind bars. Go to the police not to dear old mom, you're a grown woman now, God put this criminal in your life again to force you to deal with it, who knows what other children he has raped? Even the experts say they cannot be rehabilitated.<br>     Go to the authorities, of course tell your husband, you were an innocent child!!  He took your virginity away!!! are you going to be the victim untill you go to your grave?  thanks to your mom he could have gone on to rape other little girls, they do not stop at one if given the opportunity. Start reading facts about pedophiles. He is a criminal. You din't do anything about it then but you can expose that s.o.b. now.|`|l9lrT7bfaa	This situation is fraught with danger. I doubt if the feeling will go away. If you definitely want to stay in that town you will have to choose the right moment and tell him. There will be fall out but it is not your fault in any way. This pig raped a child, it is perfectly understandable why you haven't mentioned it as it would be very difficult.<br>  You know your husband best and should have some idea of his reaction. Will he confront the pig? Will he confront your mother? Will he want to leave town with you?<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if you cry when you tell him - it is a serious painful matter.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with it all - consider going to the police, even now.|`|xnd99EX4aa	Check your state laws on the statute of limitations for rape and sexual assault of a minor. Many states have no time limitations because the child may bury this traumatic event as they lack the maturity to deal with it. Some girls feel they may be in further trouble because they may have put themselves in a compromising situation by not following their parents instructions in the first place. Many people have come forward years later and have been successful with bringing their predator to justice. If you were my wife and you told me this I would be pissed but not at you. I would support you to bring this man to justice. Just be sure to counsel him not to whip his a$$ and get himself in trouble instead of the rapist.|`|RPhla0R7aa	Yes tell him there should be no secrets between you two. I totally agree with you they should not be friends and you should have reported him when it happened, that is something that you will never be able to get over.  Your husband should understand and you are totally notbeing selfish.|`|JWVZc4rnaa	Yes I think you should tell your husband. I think it would be best if your husband just got a different job b/c once you tell your husband he is probably not going to be able to be around him. I think your husband should know for sure though.|`|e4DAjaYUaa	I WOULD DEFINITELY TELL HIM. I THINK HE WILL UNDERSTAND AND IF THIS IS UPSETTING YOU THIS BAD HE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG ANYWAYS.

You can tell him, why should you keep something so personal a secret from your husband? Obviously you married him because you loved each other and wanted to be there for one another. I think you should tell him, that way the man won't come around your house and won't associate with you. <br>  <br>  Why would he be mad? If he's mad that another man raped you then he doesn't love you. A good man would be mad that another man raped you and would try to tell you to turn him in to the cops, although I'm not sure legally  how because of the statue of limitations, but still even if legally its too late to turn him in, you should tell your husband. A good man will want to be in your corner and will be on your side. <br>  <br>  Especially when you went through something so scary and emotional. Don't be scared to tell him. That's what marriage is about. Its about the two of you coming together and facing your problems together. Don't keep secrets, that doesn't help a marriage. Just tell him. If you want, write it all out in a letter and then give him the letter.|`|8f03238949ce3a1af22657b15dccfd0aaa	two bits of advice:<br>  <br>  1. You have to tell him because it is eating you up and it WILL come between you in your marriage.  He'll feel there is something going on and you don't trust him so he'll start to wonder and he'll not trust you and pain all around... divorce.  Also, if this goes on for a long time and then it comes out (you're bound to end up face to face and this man knows what he did to you, what if he tried again?) your husband will be pissed that you didn't tell him.  He'll feel like you made him out to be a fool.<br>  <br>  Trust him.  He loves you.  You have to include him.  And yes, it will hurt, but it is one step to setting yourself free.<br>  <br>  2.  Look up Friends of the Family or another rape crisis center in your area and TALK to a counselor about it all.  Everything.  Everything. It doesn't matter that it happened over a decade ago. They deal with people calling many years later all the time.  They can help you heal.  You can be free.  The pain and the shame and the fear can end.  Take the step!|`|AA10494978	Unfortuantely, the kind of trauma you went through at the age that you did will be with you until such time as you are able to work it out.  I'm sorry to tell you, but it will not just go away on its own.  Victims who are prayed upon in such a manner tend to look at it as if they did something wrong.  I wish your mom would have chosen to report it instead of covering it up.  Think about it like this.  If this man (if you can call him that) did this to you, how many more victims are there out there that he did the same thing to?  How many lives has he ruined and damaged?  I would suggest first that you talk to a health professional and get evaluated (even now its not a bad idea) for any kind of STDs which may or may not be in your system.  For some of them there is no cure, but can be effectively managed.  I would strongly suggest you do this ASAP.  I would also suggest that before you tell you husband exactly what happened, you ask him to just trust you and not tlak to this man.  If you don't feel comfortable telling him up front.  <br>  <br>  I would also suggest you contact a rape counselor in your area.  Unfortunately, what tends to happen in these cases is you will have to deal with the attack sooner or later, and people who don't deal with it tend to have a lot of anger issues (justifyable of course) in later life.  But like you said, you don't want to have your marriage affected by it.  So after you go through all of these steps, you will ahve to tell your husband what happened to you and I would strongly urge you to also consider whatever legal options you may have.  For all you know the man who did this to you may still be doing it and getting away with it.  But first you have to concentrate on getting better.  Good luck with everythign!|`|IrK3XqYKaa	I had the same problem... except my husband was friends with the man who raped me while I was a teenager. At first I ignored it, but the longer I didn't say anything to my husband more hurt, anger, and shame came back. Finally one night I broke down and told him what happened and why I was so weird about his friend for the longest time. I reasoned with my husband since the incident was so long ago, and the rapist did his time (I charged him and he got 2 1/2 yrs). So he just gradually stopped talking and associating with him... I think his friend knew in a round-a-bout way, and never bothered to pursue a friendship with my husband further. <br>  If you do still feel anger and bitter about this I suggest seeing a councillor and also talking to your husband about these things. That's what helped for me.|`|gIChvgVWaa	Honey, the same kind of thing happened to me, so you are not alone, and i am only 18 right now, so its very awkward for me. I would tell him, but don't just come out and say it, talk to him and tell him slowly, that's what i did with mine, now you might want to consider his temper, my husband is a soldier, and lets just say he was WAY less than happy with this man. My situation should have turned out a lot worse than it did. you are not being selfish AT ALL!! don't think that, it was not your fault, you were hurt. that is my best advice, if you feel you can't do it alone, get a counselor, tell them the situation, go to a few sessions, then bring your husband in and once again, tell him slowly.

RUdUIaB6aa	Sorry I don't know anybody just because I don't like talking to people who pretend to care about you. I do know what you are going through. I got married at the age of 18 and I had my first child at the age of 17. My child is hypoglycemic. He as been in and out of the hospital, he has had so much blood work done, he has seen so many doctors and he is only three. It has put so much stress on our family especially me. I just feel so bad for him especially when he is having blood work done. Anyways my husband since 2006 does the same thing. Most of the time it seems like he don't even care. When I ask him for help it is like why do you need help I'm the one who works all day. I really don't know why he acts that way but to be honest with you if my son didn't have him it would be harder. It would also be harder on you if you didn't have you him too. You can't go through it alone. I don't know what your child's health problem is but if it is anything like hypoglycemia I know what it is like. Good luck to you and your family and just remember keeping your child happy comes first. If you need to talk you can email me if you like.|`|SS5py9jIaa	Well a great marriage counsellor who doesnt cost much... can't think of any.

I don't mind seeing couples of different nationalities or origins, it just makes you think that you find love in the most unexpected places, and it goes beyond race.<br>  <br>  And for this guy that you like. I think he is very flattered. If you're not ready to date yet then befriend him. Take a chance, and remove these "what if" questions in your head.|`|KKxX5wszaa	Well, to tell you the truth, you certainly shouldn't at all be concerning other people's opinions towards your likes of others. You like a person, who is a different race, you should not care, and be proud of it. Weren't we taught better to look beyond our skin color? I'm not trying to be mean at all, with all honesty. I actually really admire the fact that you encountered him, with the differences in race. To my personal opinions, I don't find it weird at all. Although, it is unusual with the probability of a Caribbean/African American and Asian person being together, I think it would be something someone to could look at to change their perception of life. I think that you guys would be making a difference in the eyes of our future, one step can make a difference. On the other hand, it looks like he built up his ego or something! It seems as if he is interested in you, you must be really hot or pretty! Haha, he seems very interested, you should try giving him more chances of talking to you. Next time instead of skating away, stay there and have lunch together. He probably won't mind, he seems like a very nice guy. He seems like a pretty shy guy too. Good luck, I hope that I helped.

EUGoxWXuaa	be positive and yourself and thats al you can be.<br>  people will like you for who you are, not what you are trying to be!|`|t1cVVbGMaa	well you should be nice maybe you should have a party and invite them  party's get every one having fun and they will have a lot of fun and will want to be your a biff|`|ZKESDOrraa	be friendly. Find common interests. Start small talk.|`|w923GXtSaa	Be yourself and try your best to start conversations with a couple of people who look friendly. =)|`|YUEVhOxsaa	Lots of ways...<br>  <br>  -Try joining into school activities that you like such as sports or theater. This will put you among people who are interested in the sames things as you and friendships will be a very natural thing.<br>  <br>  -Try finding what the local teen hotspots are and go check them out. A bit harder as you don't want to seem like the outsider but if you are more social than scholarly this can be a better option than school related activities.<br>  <br>  -Go to internet social websites like MySpace and Facebook and see if you can't meet some kids who go to that school. A good way to meet kids at the school and strike off a friendship before you even get there but beware of internet predators and beware that even honest people are not always what they appear to be online.|`|Q6zeJdOuaa	First you'll start to notice the kids that you share one than one class with.<br>  For instance:<br>  <br>  Sally might be in your science class and and then you notice she's also in your home economics class.  <br>  <br>  Ask her what her favorite class is.  Ask her if you can be her study partner.  Tell her you're new in town and you could use some help.  Where do other students hang out in between classes?..after school?<br>  Can she recommend good places to get some cool clothes? <br>  After you develop a rapport with her ask if she could introduce you to some of her friends?  <br>  <br>  And to boys the new girl appears more mysterious.  They know nothing about you.  They might think gee she's cute, how do I meet her? <br>  <br>  It's your big chance to start with a clean slate.  You can mold your new image.  You can become cool and sophisticated, as opposed to being just another girl as you may have been at your old school. <br>  <br>  Watch the other kids at lunch time, look for the cliques, study their behavior and the styles they wear.  See which group you'd like to hang out with and try to copy their style so you'll fit in.<br>  <br>  Can't think of an ice breaker? <br>   Try asking someone about their favorite type of music.<br>  or say:  <br>  I'm new in town, and I hate to eat lunch alone, can I eat lunch with you?  They be flattered that you chose them!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  I'm sure you'll do just fine.|`|JmXs9g3Yaa	i make friends by trying to play the game their playing and in a day or 2 ill ask if they wnt to be friends. try to be nice and kind cause some ppl will be friends with nice and kind ppl. HOPE U WILL MAKE FRIENDS =-)|`|afvl2t22aa	just be yourself.<br>  eventually, you will find the people you were meant to be with.<br>  remember, everything happens for a reason!<br>  peace and love~<br>  RAWR!|`|jxcXVRDuaa	Have you ever rode on a Bandwagon?<br>  <br>  stfu.|`|P38ULZbraa	Don't worry about fitting in. I made friends in high school just by talking to people that I sat next to, just introduce yourself and talk about your move, or maybe your schedule. Good luck, I know it's hard moving.|`|DYlsqrMcaa	just let them beat you up once or twice then they'll leave you alone. its all down hill after that. friends are made shortly there after
a4fb671bdeb9d97a5ca6b59c2e09d198aa	A smile and good conversation go a long way. Try being more open around her and ask questions... people love talking about themselves.|`|Dl9a08Rxaa	scream at the top of your lungs lol jk<br>  ya a smile definately works or even the tiniest wink its cute and its really noticable but you have to do it at the right time otherwise the person might be weirded out|`|K7Rqrpesaa	Don't try to impress her. It's the guys that try that irritate me. Just be yourself... sounds lame, but it's the truth.<br>  Make an effort to talk to her, just be genuine and friendly, if she doesn't like that than she's not worth it.|`|Smg9AjdXaa	looks will attract her and your personality will make her stay. try being polite but not like super nice. you know just act cool when you're talking to them. flirt a little but don't get too into it. =]|`|0BF25Md4aa	Egg her house or yell her name while your voice cracks. Gets all the chicks.|`|RkzzBKxwaa	spit on her.|`|UYfeRLxwaa	Smile and her and make eye contact for a few seconds. Not too long or you'll look crazy. After a while, go over and make conversation.|`|7y4qaLDqaa	just a smile will do, it'll also probably make their day, <br>  o and talk o them
JhvqUvlsaa	Well I really don't see the problem. You said you've tried pushing her away meaning you don't want her influence around you yet when she finds out and gets upset then you freak out. <br>  So what if she found out that you were getting annoyed with her? You do not need this kind of friend messing up your life. She has an obsession with guys that is unhealthy.<br>  <br>  Bad company corrupts good manners so I suggest you and your friends  stay away from her and begin doing things without her. She could start to influence you to do bad things if you spend too much time with her. And you do not want that.|`|RD05jXYwaa	nothing much you can do it is all in her.............. whatever . just standby till she sheds this one too. tmm|`|3iGDZ85xaa	Well... you have to decide what do you want.. her as a friend or not as a friend. you say shes a bad influence but how..? because she stalks a guy..? has she ever done anyhting with those older guys? is she a bad person because of that? you have to decide... make up your mind on what you think and if you think its better off without her in your life... than move on... but make she at some point to let her know why you did what you did.
LguXFbvsaa	If a guy is giving you that much attention I would assume he's interested in you. Don't jump the gun on the whole BF/GF thing yet. Just find a way to subtly let him know that you like him. Maybe up the ante... ask him for his phone number so that you can talk on the phone, not just online. See how interested he is in the idea. <br>  <br>  He probably feels the same way you do so be confident and don't rush things. You don't want him to feel pressured or pushed.<br>  <br>  Good luck, girly :)|`|l36g3owqaa	MSN is loves best friend<br>  if you are nervous about asking "do you want to be my boyfriend", which you should be,  just ask if he wants to go see a movie. he will get the idea immediatly. if he says yes, great! if he says no, then you've lost nothing.<br>  (hour long conversations? he likes you a lot!)|`|qIEhu6uxaa	if ur talkin for an hour every day then he clearly likes you too.  i would just wait it out, let it happen on it's own.  dont force it.
zbl29wXSaa	If you seem like a nice person, I wouldn't be annoyed with you. I would try to be your friend because I don't have much friends of my own. but hey that's just me. It really depends on the person. If you're lonely and you need new friends you could look for someone sitting alone, they would most likely appreciate you more than someone who already has friends and you might become best friends.|`|74949bbcd18d4caa76c3f5b6e04e85a0aa	Well I wouldn't waste my time trying to b friends with people who didn't even care to know me. I believe that u shouldn't have to try so hard to get to know someone. What is so special about this group that u want to b friend them? And yes i think i would b annoyed! Well good luck to u!!|`|jRSzeuQOaa	First off, been there done that! If you want to join in with a clique of people, ask your self; are these the type of people I want to associate myself with? What do they have in common with me? <br>  If you don't have a lot of friends right now, don't worry. Things will get better. Making friends is not always the easiest thing to do. Especially if you do not put your self out there and just try talking to people. Randomly approaching a table of people you don't talk to normally assosiate yourself with may not be a good idea at all... Rejection can be a *****, and make you feel worse. Just be your self, don't try and change who you are just to conform or fit in with a group of people just to feel normal. True friends are the ones that come along and notice YOU. If you talk to anyone of this group at all and get along with them, ask that person if you can sit with them at lunch sometime. You never know until you try! If they treat you with disrespect then they should be forgotten about. People like that needn't waste any of your time.|`|EUGoxWXuaa	The best way is to be positive and be yourself!<br>  No, i wouldn't be annoyed!<br>  Personally, i think that you need to act instead of stressing over it!!!!<br>  Just join in, have fun and be yourself!|`|w923GXtSaa	It doesn't seem like you have much in common with them..  I think it would be a good idea to join some clubs, sports, and after-school activities. Also, try getting to know a couple of your classmates and starting conversations. Make small talk, like something about the weather, a test you had, etc. There are many ways to make new friends. Just be confident and don't lose hope about making new friends. :]
2LlC6AWHaa	find an event coming up and make everyone know that you're stylish and cool. like a talent contest. that would be great. maybe sign up for a club. besides, it's not like the whole school thinks of you this way. that's what I thought at my school, but there were some people I didn't know I talked to, and they liked me. It'll spread around that you're a nice person to get to know. You're probably exxagerating. that's ok though. good luck!|`|ixmaM395aa	Do you like your style? Because if you do then don't change for anyone. Let your personality shine through. <br>  <br>  But if you hate your style then go out and by some teen fashion mags to get ideas & inspiration. <br>  <br>  I'd rather be known as boring & dull than mean & obnoxious. Those girls/guys never go far in life. They're the ones at school reunions who're fat, have 10 kids and sit on the couch all day eating popcorn. <br>  <br>  So join some clubs at school, make friends you've got common interest with and don't be swept up in the labels you kids give yourself in school. <br>  <br>  Just be yourself and people will respect you more.|`|c4fNS7Iuaa	Who cares what others think. Do what makes you happy.<br>  <br>  Follow your heat!
0BF25Md4aa	Ask him what he does for fun, then ask him details about those things. Ask questions about himself and then say something about yourself. It's really basic, just get to know him. Once you know someone, you can just go with the flow and it'll feel normal.
TShsb3EXaa	One thing I have noticed about asking a question in the USA section is that there are so many people asking that some question are just left behind and not answered also when most people answer a question they do not ever check back to that question to see added details.<br>  <br>  Try re-asking that question of yours several times including all the added details and try asking it in different country categories such as United Kingdom etc. This way you will get more answers and answers that you actually need.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	yes alimony should be given when the wife makes less than the husband,or the wife is left for someone else, or the wife has been a stay at home mom.|`|F8CSNTQdaa	Yes.  If she can not support herself after divorce there should be some type of financial aid to help until she is able to do so.  It is not a womans fault if they are the wife and the mommy and then forced out into the world to make ends meat.<br>  <br>  Yes each circumstance should be looked at but a man can not just throw her out into the cold.|`|VlzlPAEwaa	yes, as should it be given to men, If one stayed home, gave up their careers in taking care of the home, they should be entitled to something. Just because the other made the bacon, doesn't mean she/he should not eat...|`|GHH1i6d3aa	If one partner made significantly less during the relationship than the other partner, the one who makes less should get alimony for a period of years until they can get their own life on track again.|`|VjMyHAWraa	I think in certain circumstances it should be. For example.. if a woman has dedicated her life to her husband and children and has never had time to pursue a career, yes! Maybe only for a certain amount of time though so she can get back into the workforce. On the other hand, if she provoked the divorce (like infidelity) then no! She knew what she was doing and would have to live with it! My opinion!
dGBbFwFWaa	i think u should wait and see if he comes around again if it was him.. u cant really say he was there cause u were not able to see  the face clearly..and sometimes we like this person so much we see their faces and similar things they would do in other people... but i wish it was him  so u can feel happy  he made it again to the rehearsal..  good luck and i hope u find out .|`|EkTaBfdcaa	yea, ask him.<br>  and if not, oh well.<br>  but dont get too worked up.<br>  i found out that when you least expect it you'll find someone. :]<br>  good luck man.<br>  :]|`|MgMsMExPaa	Send him an invation to the play.|`|MpTgh6MMaa	ask him if he was there.|`|V1wDqlvnaa	Unfortunately there is no certain way of knowing if it was him or not. Not even I can answer that question, but I think if it was him and he bothered to go to your rehearsal then I think he most likely would have gone up to you and thanked you for the rose or at the very least said HI to you. Best of luck with him!|`|tXU4dkyoaa	your vision is not the problem, each person has a figure ad if you jnow his figure then you know it is him. simply tell him the truth, maybe he will be happy and he likes you too im a 16 year old boy at a public school and i would love a good looken 15 year old lol|`|LsBS5bOCaa	Could be him. Why don't you call him and find out? What's the big deal. Just casually say, "I thought I saw you that day, I'm not sure. I didn't have on my contacts, but oh well!" and SAY NO MORE. See what he says after that. Don't mention the flowers, yet. See if he'll bring that up on his own, as well. That way, you can see how much he's willing to share with you, or not...|`|2GMdTj3aaa	you sound like you're 12<br>  <br>  with that said, i think you should balls up and let him know that you're into him. guys like that|`|QI36SaLhaa	While talking to him ask him what he did that day and if he says he went say oh no wonder I thought I saw you be smile :)|`|KjkOT5rfaa	you should just ask him if he went to that play.|`|DM2M5LK4aa	It is hard to tell.  Either way.. tell him how you feel.  Or talk to him by texting him or something like that and try to ask him some questions and judge by the way he responds whether he likes you or not.  You've just got to give him some kind of hints somehow or you might never know. Go for it!|`|fEGtfeYaaa	Ask someone that was there with you, who it was. If he/she doesn't know who it was, ask him/her what he looked like. Or if you don't want to do that, ask him. What can it hurt? The most he'll probly do is ask to take you out (if he's single).
Py3XJc8saa	That's not weird at all. Don't be pressured by your friends, if they are your true friends they will respect your personal decisions. When the time is right, it will happen. and only you can decide when you're ready.|`|JI1EpWX6aa	Its not weird just case your friends are telling you to do it if you don't want to don't. if there your real friends they'll accept your opinion and its better not risking getting pregnant.
X7i59NeIaa	You have to do it through the court system. Otherwise he can change his mind anytime he wants to. He will not get full custody of the children so don't let him scare you with that. The courts have the best interest of the children in mind. He will be required to pay child support and he will get some kind of visitation. It could be for the summer if you agree to it.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	What you do is get what he is saying in writting...Keep it all down.. If its emails...save it all..<br>  <br>  take it to a lawyer.<br>  <br>  In California.. you can not do it without a court. you can if you don't have kids but here you have to go thru a judge when you have children.
63FZl3Lqaa	Talk to her, it won't do anything most likely but you can try because it is your only option. Say hi to the moose's for me ^_^.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	It's not your choice and throwing a temper tantrum or begging isn't going to get your way. If you move, deal with it. Think of it as an opportunity to meet new people
AA10776535	I wouldnt waste my time or energy....Just move on you dont want a repeat of what happened.|`|7IbT8cUiaa	Been there - Done that - He came back- Wish he had not - Disastrous Marriage- Stay away from him|`|7mtdqUpwaa	I'm 26. Yes I've had it happen to me. Everyone makes mistakes hon but from your post I think you're better off without him in your life. Don't even be friends with him. You deserve better than him. I hope you find a good man in the future. You are better off without this guy.|`|RPhla0R7aa	In my case my ex-boyfriend and I are both 21 and were together for 3 years. We have broken up several times before and in one of those he told me that he didn't love me and that it was not working out. So i let it go and was trying to move on.  He came back after 2 months, he was stressed out because of his family not wanting to accept me but came back because of the relationship and connection that we had. It was stronger than that of his family. I am actually going through it again but i think i am letting go forever this time. But to answer your question yes I gave up and he came back. But is it worth it when he's an ******? you decide.
pcI25NXzaa	No offense, but why don't you just do everything he says and be ridiculously nice to him for a week or so? If he's still a jerk just be like look, i just did all your stuff for a week, was the nicest guy to you, and youre still being a jerk. See if that makes him understand.|`|ONTzkwSqaa	Oh im sorry. Yeah just ignore him and do what you are generally told, stay in school, get a job, save up, move out when you can.  <br>  <br>  When he wonders why hes not seeing his grandchildren, he will regret it all.|`|TvGqrcr9aa	He's a jerk and not worth your energy. Ignore him, pay attention in school and get a job so you can get the hell away from him ASAP.<br>  Unfortunately the government offers no help to us lost 18 year olds.|`|czPTpyraaa	What else can you really do? Some people in life are assholes, drama queens, and the only way they know how to feel secure with themselves is by making everyone else around them angry.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to ignore him as much as possible and save up and move out, I know it's hard but in life you can't really choose the cards you're dealt; you can however choose how to play them.<br>  <br>  **PS: I know there are people out there that will look at my advice and think it's somehow idiotic, they'll be the ones who say things like "Ignore his father? What? That's ridiculous" - what these oblivious folks don't realize is not every parent is the "dad of the year" , some are good, some are bad, some are in between.|`|swAONFfEaa	the military. any of the branches are good, it just depends on your individual interests. but listen: don't let your dad give you a bad perspective on life. he might seem like the most annoying person ever but remember it could be worse. also, while you're still at home, instead of focusing on your dad and filling your teenage years with pent up anger and distress, make your own good memories and find outlets for your temper. but DON'T hold it all in because then you'll probably have a troubled adulthood as well. and don't forget to be there for the rest of your family for comfort and support because they're going through the exact same thing you are. offer them lots of love and stay connected.
IK5PoN4Laa	He could like you, but there is an equal chance that he really does not and for some odd reason doesn't see a need to try to get in your pants.<br>  <br>  However, if you do like him at all, you should go for him but heed the risks, and if you feel the risks outweigh the benefits, don't go for him.  And if you don't like him, don't go for him and ignore him.  Simple.|`|akjk0KDlaa	because unlike the other girls, he actually likes u. its easier to go upto somebody ur not really interested in as since u said, he jsut ditches them. he likes u so whatever he does impacts his chances with u. he screws up and if it hurts how u feel about him, then he'll pretty much regret it thats y.|`|Bxvs28oBaa	soome men not shy to women on the streets but you tingle his heart so he is scared! He likes you...Give him some time ...Nut tell him that you don't like guys who hook up with all the girls like that...That must work...He will get more honest with you how he feels about you|`|oXRZfAWaaa	maybe he doesn't find you attractive.|`|3BfNshHYaa	hes a jerk leave him be and forget about it|`|LguXFbvsaa	He doesn't sound like too much of a winner. You like him, I'm sure, because he's the desirably "bad boy". If he's not shy with girls, then I assume he'd have let you know by now - or at least hinted - if he had some sort of feelings. <br>  <br>  If it somehow is revealed that he does actually have feelings for you... a young boy like that who simply messes around with girls and has no sympathy for how they might feel after he ditches them... might not be the best bet for a relationship. I wouldn't get my emotions too invested. He clearly has fickle tastes, and you don't want to be the flavor of the week. You sound to me like you WANT him to have feelings: "i dont understand why he couldnt just tell me how he feels since hes not shy." You're aggravating yourself over what's probably nothing. <br>  <br>  Don't let this cassanova leave you all doe-eyed and waiting for feelings he doesn't seem capable of having at this stage of his life. He wants freedom and variety - leave him to it.|`|V1wDqlvnaa	The reason he can approach all those girls is because they're easy. He's a guy that knows what to look for when he wants some, no offense to those girls but they obviously will sleep with him in a heartbeat and he knows that. You on the other hand do not give off that vibe, he knows that you're a challenge and maybe he can't figure you out.|`|zq7EgC4Xaa	uh...HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU. he's an as*hole and hence enjoys being mean to you/acting stupid. i don't understand why you would jump to conclusions like this...HE DOES NOT LIKE YOU. but it's obvious you like him for asking this question|`|ioMucCZbaa	he really doesnt like the other girls but if he likes you he's shy with the one he truely likes
gDo5SDUbaa	Wow you seem young..lol....ok in your younger situation tell a friend you like him....have her tell a friend....and get the whole news of you liking him out there but not that much out there.....just enough so that one of his friends knows a little about it. Then through aim or myspace or facebook tell a friend to casualy tell one of his friends that you would say yes IF he asked you out.....in the halls or anywhere you might see him slow down if you walk next to to him... maybey stay after in science class a lil bit but dont look conspicuous.....with-in a week you'l have him...lol.....dont ask why i answer SH*t like this but i just did....so good luck|`|0KmJwYunaa	Just say something like: <br>  <br>  "Sooo, when are you going to ask me out?   You know you want to."|`|qIEhu6uxaa	who cares if he's popular or not.  keep flirting with him and he'll come around eventually.  don't force it, just take it slow and he'll ask you out sooner or later.|`|apNmPcvHaa	the best way to get a guy to ask you out is to just tell him that you are interested in him.  If you tell him, it cuts out a lot of the BS that goes on before actually dating. <br>  <br>  If you are bold enough, you can ask him out.  If you ask him out, all he as to do is say yes or no... and it also will show him that you are a strong person, which can be attractive to some guys.|`|tZAgJpSNaa	Aww immature love, isn't it cute??<br>  <br>  1st of all he likes you, 2nd try to get close to him, talk to him more often, spend more time 2gether and from there on both of you would see wether to go out 2gether or not, if u really want him to go out with you then just tell one of his friends that you like him as much as to go out with him and thatll work|`|5yWdyJCfaa	honestly.<br>  i dont think he likes you that way.<br>  he might think your hot but thats it.<br>  i think he is just a really nice guy.<br>  but.........<br>  popularity doesnt matter.. i was popular in school and i'm dating a guy who no one really even knew.<br>  i think a way you could grab his attention is just by asking him yourself.<br>  just say.... "hey. your really nice and funny. i was thinking we could maybe go get something to eat one day?"<br>  something along those lines.<br>  dont wait for him.. just do it yourself|`|7HYJG7q9aa	wow dudet u guys sound cute haha but i really hate when girls want guys to ask them out instead of them asking the guy so i would ask him and idk if u think that the stuff he does is cute but like is it enough for him to like u do u think cause guys dont always tkae things to heart as much as girls do|`|cGNVYpVIaa	I think the best you can do about that is to make it really obvious that you like him. If he said you were hot 3 weeks ago,then even if he's started to like somebody else, he'll quickly turn back around if he knows you like him. <br>  <br>  Chances are if he's really nice to you that he likes you still, unless he's that nice to everybody else. But that doesn't make it any less likely that he's into you.<br>  <br>  I hope it works out for you, and good luck!|`|sXB0N2jDaa	It definitely sounds like he might like you. Why wait for HIM to ask YOU out? Lots of guys think it's cool when a girl is all confident and makes the first move.|`|0YyKdGETaa	txt or message him on myspace or something and start throwing hints that you want him to ask you out. ^^ flirting helps

dw440Lylaa	Plan on being grounded for life.........unless you're upfront with your parents on the situation.<br>  <br>  They WILL find out, explain to him you're not allowed to date, if he can't or won't respect that, he's not the right guy for you.<br>  <br>  Make sure your folks know who he is, and both you and he need to respect their rules on dating.<br>  <br>  You're 14, you may feel like an adult, but you're not, you're parents are trying to protect you!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Imagine being pregnant, (don't say it can't happen to you, by the time you finish high school, some of your friends and acquaintances  will either have children or have had abortions).<br>  <br>  Be smart.  You can stay friends with him, even stay interested, don't touch!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Luck
0bjQfb01aa	Your friends are changing and are getting into some trouble. Try to find new people to hang out with. Join a club or volunteer. Don't listen to what people say about you. Keep your head up high and know that you'll meet new people. Be friendly and positive- you'll make new friends before you know it, it just might take some time. Plus your old friends may come back to you once they realize they're being stupid and they miss you.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I think you need to cut ties with these so called friends. You sound like a really nice guy that is just looking for friends that will actually be there for you and want to go out and have a good time. True friends are not going to put you down for anything. A true friend always wants to help you and lift you up. I think that this group of people will end up just bringing you down. I suggest that if you have a few other good friends, spend more time with them and if not then get involved in some activities that you enjoy whether it is sports, the arts, or church if your into church groups. At least this way you can find people who want to be your friend because they really like you as a person. I wish you the best!|`|mwm8iSBsaa	same as me!<br>  try hanging out with new people!<br>  you probably are a nice person! it's their loss if they cant see that!!
ixyNeBhWaa	Don't call her.  Sometimes strong feelings are associated with this sorta thing because its Sex, and Sex in general is suppose to be intimate.  If you love your girlfriend, then love her and show that you have a strong mind by not thinking of the other girl.  You are just having strong physical feelings about the other woman and how the sex felt.  You need a strong mind and a strong relationship.<br>  Truth is, if you have a 3som with a girl, then you need to be equal.  If she wants one with a guy, are you strong enough to give her what she wants and can you handle it?|`|h3adDJ9jaa	woaaah... :0|`|9f3H3xSAaa	Its called LUST!!!!!!|`|tF3iHmrCaa	do you even know what a three sum is?|`|YLajQcFkaa	GO with the hottest girl|`|YWjhqlxbaa	That's deep.

It happens to me all the time. You still like him, but since you aren't with him most of the time you're fine. However, imagine spending everyday with him? Things would be a lot different. Those spasms of yours would be a normal thing....But since you aren't with him all the time, yes, you still may think of him, but yur mind is distracted by other things right in front of you. Seeing him with other girls reminds you of how much you like him. If you had to spend every day with him, trust me, you'd be hurt all the time. You still like him. It hurts, but sometimes there are people we just can't forget, right?|`|5nmFtzgqaa	Seeing him with another girl could trigger it.<br>  What you're feeling is totally normal though, I've felt it before and I've seen friends go through it before.<br>  Don't over-think the situation, there's nothing wrong with being care-free about the guy or being emotional about him.<br>  Just take it by stride and don't think that there's anything wrong with you.

zMD0VeOmaa	yes. looks are not everything but couples cannot fall in love if they are not attracted to each other. people select a mate based on physical attractiveness. this is simply mother nature at work.<br>  <br>  However, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Some persons might not like a person's looks but usually there is at least 1 person out there that will find them attractive.<br>  <br>  And, sometimes less attractive people have other redeeming qualities such as intelligence, kindness, a good sense of humor, and other such traits to compensate. that is of course not to say that beauty and brains are mutually exclusive. some people are lucky enough to have both.|`|RkzzBKxwaa	they say there's no such thing as a stupid question.<br>  <br>  <br>  you sir, have proved that wrong.|`|8bTF1xT0aa	LMAO...that is a stupid question, looks do matter, at the beginning of meeting a person...afterwards, not very much, people tend to grow on you.

Flirt lightly, and see if she flirts back.  Also when you make eye contact smile.|`|p2P9pUQKaa	Be yourself...|`|cGNVYpVIaa	this is such a common question, but here's my best answer. You don't "get" a girl to like you. The only way to get a girl to like you is to be yourself. Eventually, some girl will like you for your personality, and hopefully you will like her too. It takes time, so don't sweat it.<br>  <br>  Also, I know that probably wasn't the answer you were looking for, and you're probably wondering how to get a specific girl to like you. Well get to know her, act normal, and then she'll either like you or not. It's that simple. Whatever you do, DON'T push it. if you try to do a bunch of extra stuff to try to get her to like you, she's not gonna buy it. It'll be more awkward and annoying for her, and she'll like you even less. However, that doesn't mean that once you get to know her you shouldn't ask her out. Go for it, she won't blame you. But wait until you're sure you know each other.|`|7BGYY9nKaa	Dont feel bad ive been asking myself this question for a while. From a recent experience my x broke up with me because i didnt show enough attention( such as being distant during conversations) trust me i know it seems different from girl to girl but they all require someone who listens and makes them happy. Atleast thats my opinion. Good luck.|`|V1wDqlvnaa	be yourself and be aggressive. Most importantly be aggressive! Don't be shy to talk to her, so if you feel like going up to her and having a conversation then do it! That is the only way she will get to know you and the only way she will decide if she likes you or not.|`|U286XG21aa	Be yourself.. Be respectful and outgoing..

If he comes across with a gift & card, thank him as you would have.  Some people just were not brought up with any fuss being made on birthdays and certain holidays.  Yeah, poor planning is more likely the reason though.  He will do better next one.|`|7IbT8cUiaa	Forget it - It is not important. he wished you Happy Birthday didn't he ? What more do you want ?

I would be grateful for that...|`|DI3GBpk9aa	is it a big issue... that it ponders your mind so much?|`|AA11124905	Happy belated Birthday Lily. Often times we become so wrapped up in ourselves that we forget the things in life that our most important. Let me ask you this Lily. If your husband was involved in a serious car accident and was clinging to his life in a hospital bed, would you still be upset over the fact that you will be getting your birthday gift a few days late? We must always remember to be thankful for what we have. While you're pouting about getting your B-Day gift a few days late, some woman has just been notified that her husband was killed in Iraq. While you are crying over a gift, she's crying because she will never get the opportunity to hold her husband in her arms or say one last I love you or goodbye. I am sure your husband loves you very much and will make good on his promise. Truly love should always outweigh the material things that this world has to offer. Considering this and the fact that we are in a recession I feel you should definitely cut your husband some slack and be thankful for what you have. Peace and God bless.|`|d3eab5726a0f9f49c756fdcdee1a6bc5aa	You should let it go & don't say anything about it. Birthday is not that much important that you overlook many things which affect your matrimonial relations. If you argue, it will affect love & affection between you & him. Your married life is short(,1 year) & you still have long way to go. On any difference between you & him, explain tactfully with love(particularly on division of domestic responsibilities but there is clear cut boundary). Avoid arguments, altercations, snubbing, taunting, ridiculing, blaming, tough talking, making a mountain out of a molehill, shouting & fighting of any type particularly in front of others, inside the house & outside too. The first year of marriage is very tight in budget for most of married boys. After marriage both learn from the other slowly almost all of the works both can do. Nominal house keeping, money saving, budget planning & expenditure control are important things go with calculations. Save the money for rainy days. Most of people celebrate birthday according to English(Gregorian) calender which has no spiritual or religious value. For you most important thing is winning over his heart to have strongest & deepest possible love & affection permanently by your day-to-day attitude such that he himself becomes your slave. Remain cool, polite, positive, sincere, sweet, soft & tolerant(in non-serious matters) while interacting with him. Use him most for love & affection purposes at home daily. Your every action should be love based. Make a time table that at every night both of you will love each other externally on a soft bed for at least half an hour say from 8.00 - 8.30 pm or so by wearing bikinies only & kiss, smooch, hug, rub & gently press each other's muscles. This has medical benefits too which reduces fatigue, increases fitness, enthusiasm, love & longevity. Maintain your body slim & strong. Take warm milk with pure honey dissolved in that & have regular sex at least once in three days attaining orgasm. You can have even thrice every night too. All these things increase deep love, affection & intimacy to unaffectable level. Entertainment is the most important for newly married couple including regular sex which is very important like regular food. Try to go for sight seeing at romantic places of natural beauty, a little away from residence at least once in 2 weeks & talk about your love towards him at some secluded places there. This is necessary for a change. Make innovations in daily life at home to maintain attraction. In future you will control him fully.|`|iD4ejChZaa	That someday will never come, he's not half as sensitive as you think he is, [only about himself], a sensitive man would have been sure to celebrate your special day. <br>     On your b-day you should have said let's go to the mall [or store etc.] and look around, then picked out something for yourself. Don't let this guy off the hook, I been through it too many years, but he always seemed to buy himself whatever he wanted. He's changed now, after 20 sad b-days. Anyway chose a day when you 2 go shopping and pick up something, tell him right out ''this is what I like for my birthday, thank you very much'', first he's cheap then he mind controls you not to speak up.  If it causes an arguement~ go out and pick up a 300. gift for yourself, please do it. No excuse he knew your b-day was in Feb. He could have bought something weeks ago.|`|xnd99EX4aa	Sorry sweetie, I can't agree with every one else on this. They have 99 cents cards in the dollar store and grocery store. If I had no money I would make my wife a card. I would tell her not to do the dishes because it's her birthday. I would draw her bath water and carry her off to the bedroom (after we dined on the meal I prepared). Even if the meal had to be sardines and crackers, my wife would feel special on her birthday. The economy is no excuse. As a matter of fact, since the economy and all the other bad news issues are so depressing in this country right now, all we have is each other and we need to take extra time to make each other feel special. It doesn't cost money to show love. Maybe this is a sign that this man doesn't have a high capacity for consideration.|`|7BGYY9nKaa	I find this extremely strange and very sad. Yes the economy is bad!!! seems that he could atleast buy you a card. What does a card cost? $3 or $4 come on. I mean how does the guy survive? However I would stay on the chill side about it atleast for a few days. There is no way i could remain calm in this situation so your doing very well at the moment. Everything will work out for you.|`|gIChvgVWaa	I am in the same boat, no Valentines day for me, ha ha ha. my husband DOESN'T know how to manage money, but atleast he remembered. that is the most important thing. i would just let it go and see what happens. It would be completely different is he didn't even remember it. and he is a man, no man can manage money well, get used to it, trust me. :) good luck and happy birthday|`|p8RvGtNYaa	Men feel less of themselves when they cannot financially provide for their family.

HE can't buy anything nice for himself, how could he buy anything nice for you?<br>  <br>  Instead of complaining about your selfishness, go and help out YOUR HUSBAND!<br>  <br>  Really, if you continue bitching like this he's better off with a more appreciative wife.|`|8d305d626997db3cee36b1f14b85aaf8aa	was there any way he could have possibly budgeted the money? i mean your finances are you business, so if you were paying out money thru the month and just didn't have the extra funds, maybe you should cut him some slack. if not and he just squandered any extra funds foolishly, then remind him daily, or at least on his b-day|`|9iyZGPx5aa	Hey you are lucky that he rememberd and wished you...he loves you and wants to give you more than a card.|`|RPhla0R7aa	Just don't say anything about it. Its not worth arguing about and if he truly wants to get you something he will so just wait it off. Come on look at the economy, give him a break.  :)|`|GHH1i6d3aa	No one is entitled to presents.

It is not the gift, it is the part of remembering.  He couldn't budget 3.75 to buy a nice card or better yet, write something for you?<br>  <br>  The problem is that now every time you guys have an argument and you get really mad at him, you will bring this up as a fault of his (which it is).  He is being selfish and he hurt your feelings.  YOu need to let him know that... like you said, gently explain to him it is not the gift, it is the fact that he didn't think highly enough of you to do something.  <br>  <br>  It can also be a little worrisome because the lack of respect can be amplified and an excuse can always be found for neglecting a partner.  No money, no time, no resources, no whatever... This si how small arguments turn into big ones.  Better communicate now while you guys still have no major issues, before you get major issues.  Didn't you cover this in pre-marital counseling?|`|SEjrzaVJaa	Sometimes i really am amazed at how women can always console themselves and make believe that their men still loves them and cares for them but yet not make a slightess effort to spring small little surprises on their wives.....If he can remember your birthday, cant he make a small effort to get anything?? Cant budget his money?? More like cant be bothered.... How much does a single stalk of rose cost?? or a small slice of your favourite cake? A simple card? Or did you give him the impression the gift gotta be lavish to be appreciated??<br>  <br>  Why do you think YOU caused any arguments with him? Dun you think he is the one who starts them by being "sensitive" over your comments? Why do you have to be "careful" about the way you put things?<br>  <br>  Lady, you have a big "problem"...and it doesnt love or respect you. Believe me you.|`|w6v8JnBAaa	Happy Belated Birthday Lily, I'm sorry that you didn't get a gift or at the very least a card. I have to agree with those who brought up the fact that cards are 99 cents & he could have still made you feel special on your birthday without spending any money. Like they said, he could have cooked you dinner, draw you a bath, done the dishes, took you to bed....he could have used his imagination....this was your first birthday as his wife but what about before you married him? Did he do anything for you on your previous bday's?<br>  Anyway,  I guess if it were me I would be heart broken that he didn't acknowledge it more but I wouldn't allow myself to be upset for too long because I have learned to "pick my battles". As the years go by there will be many times of challenge because marriage is work...sometime HARD work.<br>  Good luck to you & I hope you having many happy years together despite this ooops.
dw440Lylaa	You're kidding........right?<br>  <br>  You have to be at least partly naked to do it right..........just so you know, "humping" makes you sound immature.<br>  <br>  Where, exactly, do you think you came from?<br>  <br>  <br>  Luck|`|TaTCbLSzaa	put some earphones on and turn on your mp3 or ipod on full volume if you have one and there you go noone wants to hear that kinda stuff especially if its one of your parents ewwwwwww....|`|2imXzBHbaa	Did your penor get hard?|`|AA10327722	Sex you are usually naked but sometimes you have some of your clothes on.|`|qIEhu6uxaa	by the way you asked it sounds like you're young.  ask your dad this same question and maybe he'll understand and be quieter next time!|`|uPRYwa3zaa	by humping do you mean having sex, and yes you do, unless they were dry humping|`|qigjzA77aa	you don't even know. my x gf's mom was really bad like that with her gentlemen lovers. way worse. she would moan really loudly|`|ktsPCsBjaa	no not really.<br>  <br>  it kind of defeats the purpose thought, to do it with clothes on?<br>  <br>  but that's none of my business.<br>  <br>  good luck with listening to your dad bang his girlfriend<br>  <br>  i pity you|`|UK8c5CFPaa	HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...|`|1zfwLsQpaa	no, u could have dry sex, with ur clothes on but that is unlikely if ur alone, overage, and in bed...|`|eLDMlmSYaa	WHoa O_o<br>  <br>  no you dont have to be naked to <br>  hump eachother. but you need <br>  to take off your pants to do that.|`|5YdI3SAMaa	nop.. you can do dry humpn' :)|`|Sv62SsxXaa	you dont HAVE to be.. but most likely they were..people tend to be naked when they "hump"|`|gtr3CGU5aa	More than likely they were naked.|`|W1T91aEcaa	You don't HAVE to be naked... but they probably were and they were probably having sex! *GASP* Two adults having sexual relations???

zMD0VeOmaa	that's hard to say. I like both equally well. curly hair looks pretty on some women while straight hair looks better on others. I like longer hair though at least shoulder length.

However, it really depends how the person wears it.  Both can look quite attractive if done correctly.|`|r1IWKjFxaa	I like straight hair generally... unless you just have the entirely wrong face/body type for it.|`|T3TDOoGPaa	if it is upto me to choose among stright hair and curly hair i would choose sraight hair.|`|buNimd8Kaa	in my experience my hair is really really curly. but i straiten it sometimes too. my bf likes it both ways. so i guess it depends on the guy. look at his dating background and see if u see a pattern. im shure it would look fine either way though|`|nRLBRLwiaa	I usually like curly hair but looks don't really matter to me if she has a good personality everything about her looks good.|`|Vqhy1LI8aa	hair is hair.<br>  At the end of the day we all have the same basic features.<br>  HAIR, EYES, MOUTH, TEETH, EARS,ecttt...|`|l36g3owqaa	Its obvious why you are asking this question, but, as these following answers will tell you, it all depends on the guy. we arnt all the same you know!<br>  (i like curly)|`|tZAgJpSNaa	well... straight hair actually|`|DxyyWahdaa	i like curly hair|`|Sv62SsxXaa	ive had both and honestly - it just depends on the guy.
AA11375689	This was like 2 years ago. I worked at a movie theater. There was a male teenager with down syndrome working as greeter/ ripping tickets. A  female  customer in her teens with down syndrome came to the movies with her mom. She went up and talked to him for like ten minutes while the mom watched. The rest of the night he had the biggest smile on his face. You could tell it made his day. It really hit me hard. I thought it was one of the sweetest things ever.|`|FyqCMrCdaa	a Ferrari Enzo. :P|`|jS6Qkj0faa	a volunteer firefighter all blackened and sooty from helping battle massive fires giving an injured koala a drink of water in amongst the blackened bush.<br>  <br>  TOTALLY want to kiss that guy!|`|7HYJG7q9aa	um i think its when a guy and a girl are looking deep into each others eyes outside like a movie theater when snow is falling all around them or rain and they share a cute kiss or somehting like that or at the beach when a girl and a guy are just on the beach wit the girl laying on the guys shoulder and them wispering they love each other as the they either ewatch the sun set or rise or they watcha storm going out to sea|`|RkzzBKxwaa	kick off your stilletos.<br>  kick off your stilletos,<br>  and f*ck me in the backseat.<br>  f*ck me in the backseat.<br>  lalalala....drugs on the dashboard..blahblahbleah;P|`|B9sXtQWHaa	Being at the airport, and watching the faces of a young girl and her partner greet eachother. Absolutely priceless.. Ive never seen anyone smile so sincerely :]
po85q148aa	I don't want to judge her kuz I don't know her but ... I used to have job-itis too.  Jumpin from job to job like I lost my mind.  But I'm honest ... I don't like to work.  LOL  I've been married a little over a year and have maintained a job for that amount of time (yay me).  However, I think you need to really sit her down (even if you've already done that) and break down the bills and everything for her.  But in my opinion she is sounding real selfish by saying she got the babysitting gig so "I can have a little money for myself to spend".  Like wow ... really?  I don't know if you have a religion or not but praying for her and y'alls marriage won't do any harm.  Seriously though ... break it down for her and let her know how it's affecting you and the bills.  There's no reason you should have to be the only one working to make ends meet unless you were just ballin.  And obviously|`|VjMyHAWraa	I agree... she should find a job! Something puzzles me though! Why would you quit a job because it doesn't pay enough before you find a better paying job? Now you're stuck with a job that pays 3 times less and working 50+ hours! Where's the reasoning behind this?|`|dbQHlp85aa	She seems very immature for someone in their 40's. Is she cheating on you.. why else would HER friends beg you to stay away from your own home until she gets there?|`|y21VcTjDaa	You took a job that pays three times LESS than the one you quit thinking that would help pay the bills???? You're even dumber than your wife!|`|LNSiLxlBaa	Sounds like you need to tell her to get a real friggin' job or get out. You're paying bills on your own anyway. You can struggle by yourself and not have to feed TWO mouths. Explain to her that she needs to get a real job of substance to help you pay your mounting bills, because "babysitting" just ain't doing it! Tell her that she needs to put a little more effort into finding a full time job that's reliable and less into taking care of other people's kids randomly. I hope she realizes it's just as much her responsibility to help pay bills as it is yours. If she gets pissed about it, then tell her you'd like to take up underwater basket weaving because it makes about as much money as her "babysitting"" does. Then I'll bet she''ll get the point when you guys are sitting in the dark starving because YOU aren't being the work horse without any real help anymore.|`|iD4ejChZaa	man up and take care of your wife|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Your wife sounds like she's losing her mind.  If she knows you guys are having financial issues and she wont look for a job? You've got problems once a partner starts disregarding you like this.  It also sounds like she has troubles holding down any kind of job.  What is she doing to keep getting fired?<br>  <br>  She sounds like a girl I used to know who was so pathetic she couldn't keep a job for 2 weeks.... You need to get your last job back to earn more money.  You also need to tell your wife she has to get a job, if she doesn't well, maybe you should consider seperation and see how well she can pay her own bills then, she'd have to smarten up.<br>  <br>  I feel bad for yea thats a rough spot to be in.  But again you did give up a good paying job so that was silly too|`|AA10494978	Give me one good reason why she should get a job?  She probably sleeps until noon, doesn't have to worry about bills, has a car at her disposal and the money she makes is hers to do with it as she pleases.  <br>  <br>  Sounds like you are not married to this woman but raising another kid.  You guys need to have a talk about what is going on and let her know, CALMLY, that this is not acceptable.  You hold your temper no matter what and if she gets upset, as long as you are calm, she will calm down as well.  Good luck|`|GHH1i6d3aa	That does seem unfair.  If she does all the cooking/cleaning/grocery shopping then it's not quite so bad, but if you guys aren't making ends meet and she's capable of getting a decent job, then she really should.  Otherwise you'll both be too old to work one day and have nothing to retire on.|`|RPhla0R7aa	Don't know its kinda strange for her not to want to help you seeing that you are working you butt off and she's just at home babysitting. Don't get me wrong its still a job and more depending on the age of the kids, but i would put my husbands needs before mine. Also, maybe she just needs a break from a real job and will start to work once you talk to her and tell her how you feel and how its affecting your relationship.
7Z7r2cUHaa	Drunk and naked. In your parents bed. They'll get over it. <br>  <br>  The movie probably sucked anyway.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Put your head on his chest, arm around him (his waist) & lay back.|`|EcCLlRtTaa	Lean to his NECK and intentionally tickle him by gently breathing to his neck or to his EAR...<br>  <br>  You can also smack him a kiss once in a while while embracing him at his hips...<br>  <br>  Be ROMANTIC and at the same time CREATIVE...<br>  Just don't make repetitive, awkward, monotonous and/or boring...<br>  <br>  Have Fun!!!|`|e80aa9c0a25afc548ff200fc3f1000dfaa	LOL.  Someone said "spooning".  You can't spoon while watching a movie sitting on the couch..lol.   yes spooning is the best in bed.  My gf is the best spooner so far (a very complex tight yoga like spooning which lets no air in between the body..lol). <br>  <br>  Best cuddling while watching a movie on the couch is to take turns.  One day one person likes down and the other person on one end has his/her head on lap or his/her leg/foot on lap.  If if you have the head , then you can slowly stroke it, stroke the shoulders, stomach, butt etc.,   If you have the leg and foot, then massage the legs, foot (possibly use a little bit of scented massage oil).  Make it smooth and nice and not like giving aprofesional massage and distracting him/her from the movie.    Also slowly kiss her legs feet, hands (palms).  If you have a head, kiss her head , play with her hair, kiss hands.  etc., <br>  If both are sitting up , then usually the guy can put the hand around the girl and possibly use a wam blanket and cuddle inside.   A bit of slow kssing on neck , hair etc., will be great.   In cold regions always use a electric blanket instead of turning up the whole room heat.   You can use it evenif the fireplace is on.   It's a different feeling.|`|mLdlFhyqaa	No, you should let him initiate that.  He will reflexively put his arm around you.  If you do it, he will feel like you are making the moves and he will feel unmasculine if you do that.  Just be open to what he does and show him that you appreciate it.  Don't go too fast; you were good to start with just hand-holding.  That way you two are certain that you are comfortable with each other when you start the more intimate things.|`|kq0yqASCaa	Sit by the fire, on the couch witha  blanket and just liek lay your head on hsi shoulders or lay on his lap?|`|g3pGZEw9aa	Spoonin is the best!|`|2GzmIimDaa	Putting your head on his shoulder is good, or just sitting close. Don't worry too much, I'm sure even just being together will be great, especially if you just started dating. Good lucK! :)|`|AA10021295	Buy a Snuggie<br>  www.getsnuggie.com
ukQhwKo4aa	its an adolescent thing...most guys in high school are looking to see how many girls they can have sex with or atleast perform some sort of sexual act with....some are looking for that 1 person like i did....it all depends....for me sex feels great and it was all about the pleasure and not about bragging to my buddies about it the next day|`|4f51ca5e733afd3aff18667f295ba3c6aa	Every people has a different perspective when it comes to sex. If they think sex is like that then you can do nothing about how they feel about it. Well if you are enjoying it who cares right? It's a pleasure especially if you do it to someone your heart is longing for.|`|RkzzBKxwaa	he was drunk.|`|eO5sddfLaa	thats the strangest thing iv ever heard<br>  wow<br>  if thats true<br>  what a disappointment<br>  maybe guys are even better fakers then girls<br>  what a concept<br>  i sure hope not|`|ioMucCZbaa	your friends are weird
y4zYkceEaa	Tell him straight up how you feel. Honesty is the best policy! ;))|`|5qAUsXzfaa	Be straight up with him.  Hiding your feelings isn't a good thing.  It will cause crap to build up and make things a lot worse.  I speak from experience.  If it isn't working and you aren't as happy as you used to be then maybe it isn't meant to be.  If it was, then ya'll will eventually get back together in the future, but for now it just isn't working.  If you do talk to him, it might change things and make him see how he's treating you.  I would know, I'm married and it took me a year to tell my husband how I felt and now he kisses my butt.  LOL|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well every relationship has arguments and I don't know of any who doesn't have any. I think you need to sit down and talk with him like you are talking to us now. Either he is tired of being with you and wants to move on, so therefore he is trying to make you leave. Or he may just be mad at you at that time and acts like he doesn't care meanwhile he does. Talk to him, that is all I can tell you.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	i think u have to sit him down and let him know how u feel.. u have too have good communication in order to continue in a healthy and happy relationship... the yelling and screaming all those things wont help the relationship in any way.. ask him what he thinks is going wrong and how he think u both can improve the relationship..  u have to be open to ideas.. and u have to listen to him when he is talking ..as he has to listen to what ur sayin.. good luck|`|o716IHkHaa	It happens in every relationship here is the cycle<br>  <br>  first 3 months - Lovey dubby couple<br>  <br>  next 4 months - More closer lovey dubby couple<br>  <br>  next months - 1st year aniversary - Can talk or do anything together<br>  <br>  next months after 1st year fights and arguments begin<br>  <br>  next few months after that - BREAKUP|`|Tck4lXx5aa	I'm going thru the same crap, its horrible. Weve been together for 1yr and 1mnth so im pretty sure its normal.
DTGO1pgyaa	chris brown- say good bye<br>  Baby come here and sit down, let's talk <br>  I got a lot to say so I guess I'll start by <br>  Saying that I love you <br>  But you know, this thing ain't been <br>  No walk in the park for us <br>  I swear it'll only take a minute <br>  You'll understand when I finish, yeah <br>  And I don't wanna see you cry <br>  But I don't wanna be the one to tell you a lie so <br>  <br>  How do you let it go? <br>  When you <br>  You just don't know? <br>  What's on <br>  The other side of the door <br>  When you're walking out, talk about it <br>  Everything I tried to remember to say <br>  Just went out my head <br>  So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand <br>  Cause I kno... <br>  <br>  <br>  There's never a right time to say goodbye <br>  But I gotta make the first move <br>  Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me <br>  Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you <br>  Girl it's not you, it's me <br>  I gotta gotta figure out what I need <br>  Oh <br>  There's never a right time to say goodbye <br>  But we know that we gotta go <br>  Our separate ways <br>  And I know it's hard but I gotta do it <br>  And it's killing me <br>  Cause there's never a right time <br>  Right time to say goodbye <br>  <br>  <br>  But now your heart is breaking <br>  And a thousand times I <br>  Found myself asking, "Why? Why?" <br>  Why am I taking so long to say this? <br>  But trust me, girl I never <br>  Meant to crush your world <br>  And I never <br>  Though I would see the day we grew apart <br>  And I wanna know <br>  <br>  <br>  Girl I hope you understand <br>  What I'm tryna say <br>  We just can't go on <br>  Pretending that we get along <br>  Girl how you not gonna see it? <br>  <br>  <br>  But we know that we gotta go <br>  Our separate ways <br>  And I know it's hard but I gotta do it <br>  And it's killing me <br>  Cause there's never a right time <br>  Right time to say goodbye <br>  <br>  <br>  Listen to your heart <br>  Girl you know, <br>  We should be apart, baby I <br>  I just can't do it <br>  I, I just can't do it <br>  Listen to your heart <br>  Girl you know <br>  We should be apart, baby I <br>  I just can't do it|`|p0D4dxEqaa	truth always wins out.<br>  <br>  tell her the truth, don't beat around the bush. Tell her there is no fun in the relationship, there is jealousy from her, there is selfishness. tell her flat out you want a break,with no promises to even get back together.<br>  Boredom is a sign of incompatibility.<br>  <br>  "when I'm gone" by 3 doors down might set the mood.|`|4Ovf0Gr8aa	tell her exactly what you just typed<br>  its SO ridiculous when one person gets mad in a realtionship about one thing, but then goes and does it themselves that is the absolute worst.. you guys definately need a break if shes not trying to change for the better.. show her that she can't do that **** to you... cause if you stay with her and don't take control shes just gunna think she can do whatever and you'll still be there|`|M8MlviOFaa	Okay, well, just tell her you need some time away from her. Tell her you feel like its not going anywhere, tell her You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin' (hall and oates). Your not feeling her anymore, you need your space. its over, we are done. <br>  <br>  how was the sex? cuz thats a huge sacrifice if it was any good. Okay, so hit it one more time, and make sure she gets hers more so in the long run she'll wanna come back for more. IM SERIOUS! <br>  <br>  After that, (not right after) tell her how you feel, and explain all the problems with the relationship, starting with the main reason, and work your way down the list, just like a persuasive essay. But keep in mind that statistically, conflicts are won with the main points presented first. So use the big ammo first.. <br>  <br>  Make sure she doesnt cut you off either, tell her to allow yourself to elaborate. And in the end let her off easy though. Tell her you guys can be friends in the future once your over each other.<br>  <br>  It was fun at first right? Well, with you out of her life, she may fight to get you back, hopefully for your sake she'll change. If not, then you made the best decision.<br>  <br>  damn im good, they dont pay me enough for this! actually, they dont pay me at all. just 2 points in the bucket!|`|ghXH7JZRaa	Tell her that you have enjoyed being with her over the last year, but as the relationship has gotten to be more relaxed and the newness has worn off, you don't really see a future for the two of you. Tell her that she is a wonderful person but that you really don't think she is the right woman for you.<br>  <br>  Don't be mean about it, but tell her the truth. She might be angry but in reality she'll thank you in the end.|`|BaG8yeVVaa	lol a song? are you kidding me! just tell her straight up how you feel, if you really want this to be over. best of luck dude!|`|xCAbKKIOaa	aly and aj  the potential break up song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN_58vHQKh4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN_58vHQK...</a>|`|87TTGyQsaa	i f*cking hate you by godsmack<br>  <br>  or dude just do the manly thing and tell her its over. seriously a SONG?|`|jxizzHL1aa	How old are you?

4bAZW3F6aa	sure im up for it chek my profile for my contact info|`|4f51ca5e733afd3aff18667f295ba3c6aa	Give her time for herself everybody has the right to fall so deeply in love with someone but if you see that it's too much and it's affecting your friendship then confront her about it besides she is your bestfriend she will listen
1vaqtRI2aa	The sweet, simple and short answer: Because he respects you enough to not act like a freaking pig when he's around you.<br>  <br>  This is a GOOD thing- don't be concerned. It's a good sign that he's a respectable guy.<br>  <br>  Hey, does he have any brothers? Haha, just kidding!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|zCakedeXaa	all guys are pervs to a degree, your his girlfriend and he is tiring to be your knight in shinning armor.  if u don't want to be with him don't be with him.  don't let your friends tell u what to do.|`|EeQ6qL52aa	maybe cause you guys have sex anyways (assuming) so he doesn't need to be perv.  Usually when a guy is a perv it means he is trying to get at some girl in an overly sexual manner.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	he has to keep up the act|`|7fe1b273a9f987230ff6b1a136231dd3aa	Its probably him showing off for his friends, guys act that way, and then they are really sweethearts on the inside.|`|Iu5Q9lTSaa	Because if they act to perverted they may get dumped or the girl may not have sex with him.|`|1FAggU5Zaa	its the other way around there even more perverted~!|`|432454c57ce1cb88f9527575e85289d0aa	Cuz if he acts like a perv, he ain't gettin' no stank-*** pussy!|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	LOL  Are these friends guys?? Guys always act different around other guys then they do around there wife's or gf because if they acted that way in front of their wife or gf she would cut his nuts off and throw them down the garbage disposal.|`|gmBzMFDLaa	because he loves you! and cares about you.<br>  and wants to look mature around you, so you feel safe and protected=]<br>  guys will be guys.<br>  just not around girls(if that makes sense)|`|UYfeRLxwaa	Hehe, its out of respect. He must care about not being a pig around you or that you will get upset at him if he does toss around perverted subjects around you. You should ask him about it.|`|aL0OCQG3aa	That's weird? My boyfriend is perverted towards ME, but if he was towards other girls id be a little angry for him being flirty with someone besides me.|`|gC6r0WDaaa	It sounds to me like your friends do not like this guy and are trying to break you too up by going on about what a freak he is.|`|fA4MHQWmaa	maybe when he's around you he cares what you think of him. <br>  but when he's around others he doesn't care at all what they think of him so he does/says whatever is on his mind|`|AA10313141	He wants to be a better person for you, but also doesn't want to alienate his friends.|`|3LjMWownaa	what gigatone said.  he just acts differently around people he knows better, or is more comfortable with.|`|4jW455dgaa	Do you really think you would like his true self if he was perverted? <br>  Thats why he acts different|`|07HWkV4eaa	It's true, I saw him screwing a dog down the street yesterday|`|haGMBfmPaa	you don't find him perverted because you are in fact a pervert.|`|BM4TnWxQaa	they don want u to think he is a perve or maybe he thinks youll take it seriously nd think hes wierd mines the same way =]|`|6AP6fmtmaa	good impression i guess?|`|fWWHMDWQaa	haha . wow you are stupid. I don't know it's a mystery|`|kWjy7uzAaa	Because we want to have sex with our girlfriend, and is she is all hissy about something she wont have sex. Your BF's buddies are gay and not looking out for their friend by telling you that kind of stuff. They prolly wanna sleep with u.|`|uGQZWvGOaa	I never tone it down around my girlfriend. I'm always cracking dirty jokes around her.|`|8wmjYlfaaa	im sure all girls do not want to hear about ***** and vagina's all the time, including how much he wants to bang his girl.<br>  and im not kidding, many of my friends do that.but there are those occasional guys who are perverted, but act very seriously around girls that they like.(like me)its not that im a major pervert, just around my guy friends.its nothing personal, really.|`|4vLt3SqFaa	Without details it is hard to judge exactly what is going on.  Perverted is often in the eye of the beholder.  For some people bondage would be a tame form of sex play while others view anything outside of missionary position, in the dark, and strictly for procreation, as perverted.<br>  <br>  It may be that he has done some wild things in the past but is serious about you and is putting that stuff behind him just like some girls are rather slutty but they find a nice guy and put their loose ways behind them.  Unless you share more I really can't help you much.|`|mcehFtY0aa	perverted?|`|dtq32xuwaa	saving best for last
3URrhz10aa	First of my dear you should be very proud of yourself for not succumbing to the promiscuous lifestyle. Secondly thing that's it's pretty healthy that you have a prerogative. Some people just follow the flow of what's going on in their environment and don't always follow what's in their hearts.<br>  <br>              You don't need to improve anything if it means for the satisfaction of others. Unless you are happy then the hell with what everyone else thinks.Follow your heard and your dreams. People need to recognize that just 'cuz your young doesn't mean you have sex in your brain all the time.<br>  <br>                                                    And Yes God is definately love|`|jgF8NC8qaa	Not to be straight up but are you afraid to be in a relashionship due to the fact uve never been in one??? u have to find appeal in some sex u and I both know this..dont be afraid of who you are, cuz god accepts every1|`|9mv3XPeBaa	no, but you are an EXTREEME PRUDE.|`|80Xanfvzaa	You shouldn't listen to anyone but yourself. You may be 22 years of age, but there is absolutely nothing wrong with liking different things than what most people that age do. I actually think it's mature of you to not go after every single guy that crosses your path, like a lot of girls would. By waiting for the 'right one', and you will know when he comes, it really shows how you respect yourself. Do not get yourself pressured into following the mainstream, just be yourself and good things and happenings will come to you.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say you are a kid, but a kid at heart, which is great to be.|`|XCrkjoQQaa	i have not seen you personally and i cannot read the heart and mind of anybody for only the LORD God has the power to do that as mentioned in Jeremiah 17:9-10 "The heart is more deceitful than all else And is desperately sick; Who can understand it? I, the LORD, search the heart, I test the mind, Even to give to each man according to his ways, According to the results of his deeds." if you say you are 22 years then you must be acting and feeling the way a 22-year female person. there is nothing wrong if you are longing for a right partner in life but be sure that someone must be given by God, Proverbs 19:14 "House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers, But a prudent wife or husband is from the LORD." everybody is subject to improvement, but what kind of improvement? is the improvement you are taking according to the will of God or only according to your own self-righteousness or the righteousness of others or from the books you read or from the movies you have seen or from the practice of other people? if it is the latter i.e., from your self-righteousness to the practice of other people, then you are not of God as you claim you are. am sorry this is not the way God wants His people or children to act and behave. you need to know the word of God and practice them because the word of God is truth, John 17:17 "Sanctify them in the truth; Thy word is truth." our Lord Jesus Christ was talking to the Father in heaven in this particular instance. the word of God is in the Holy Scriptures or the Holy Bible. hope you are reading and listening to what you are reading as answers to your questions. may God bless and love you! i hope i am not transgressing the will of God when i write this answer to your question.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Well anyone who is 22 is going to be called a "kid" by people who are older than they are. You are very young in their eyes; and you are young; you were a teenager just a few short years ago.<br>  <br>  So if you are happy with the way you are living right now and if you're believing God will bring you the right man into your life at the right time then don't listen to the nay sayers who say you act like a robot. Be yourself. Youv'e got nothing to lose.|`|dbQHlp85aa	Nope, you are perfect just the way you are. <br>  <br>  As Christians, we encounter a lot of non-believers.. you know that.. and they will do anything in their power to break us.. but stay strong in your faith and keep doing what you know is right.|`|pvosPN40aa	No joke, Im 22/m and never had a girlfriend or even kissed a girl. (by choice). Your actually more adult then they are in my opinion. It is ok to like a guy though, just because you don't want to date doesn't mean you cant find guys attractive|`|ZldKA17Iaa	YESS you are keep thinking god will throw mr. right down from above . hello every heard of you gotta work for something to get <br>  we date to find the right guy not always is our so called first boyfriend MR RIGHT !|`|ojEkgJoqaa	ask the jonas brothers good GOD|`|mwm8iSBsaa	live you live like TI says|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Just because you have morals does not make you a child. However, you might be a little naive, which is perhaps what they are implying. I do however think that maybe you're taking this a little too far. I mean, since you believe in God, I don't think that He's going to just drop the guy in your lap. I don't see anything wrong with harmless flirting. However, life is about what you want to be, not how others perceive you should be. Whether or not you need to improve on yourself is a decision only you can make.|`|9087c63bf667d25bf1ebbecfe37cae22aa	No, you are legally considered an adult. You have more responsibilities than a kid. They are using that term maybe because it reminds them of kids, with the cudies and all that jazz.|`|Jk9jPNeLaa	No, that doesn't make you a kid. You have your own beliefs and people should respect that and your decisions.|`|TUJlPcGLaa	No. You are perfect. And you have a mind of your own. Unlike 90% of the brainless trash hoes in America today.|`|5agXk9ldaa	no you are not a kid my dear <br>  it is a life style, i do what makes you feel confortable|`|KOSuw0Bkaa	Wow..Sounds pretty cool....Just stick on to Jesus,u will get endless hope.Without Him....hopeless end. Be a kid n stay innocent to reach ur goal :-) :-)|`|1thElV58aa	you will start to grow up sooner or later maybe your appearance will. But you will always be kid at heart after 21 years of age you are consider a adult. MAybe their sad because they lost their inner child, or was force to grow up. <br>  <br>  I know what you mean by still feeling like a little kid. <br>  im 19<br>  i sound like im 12<br>  i look 15<br>  and i always get carded when i want to buy a lottery ticket, they stop and stare at me for awhile lol.<br>  <br>  you feel uncomfortable talking about adult things, sickness which is normal depending on your personality. But flirting? why is there a problem with that?<br>  <br>  <br>  you cant force yourself to grow up... Impossible|`|2KJvaWDYaa	no your not a kid (your 22!!!), your immature. im not being mean, but that is what you are. here is a dictionary definition: immaturity - not having reached maturity.<br>  it goes kid, pre-teen, teenager, young adult, adult and you r an adult. just because you refuse to accept things that are part of growing up, and dont do things that people consider 'adult behaviour' doesnt mean ur a kid. it means u have a problem with growing up.<br>  they call u a kid because u act like one and most likely think like one. that is not necessarily a good thing and may actually become annoying to ur friends and workmates so watch out 4 that. <br>  have u ever considered that u are 'asexual' (no this isnt a sick discussion)? it means that u dont experience a sexual attraction to either sex. this is unlikely though.<br>  <br>  here is the solution: go live with Peter Pan in Neverland.<br>  :)|`|VjgIeIMgaa	keeping away from adult jokes and other crap doesnt mean that u'r a kid. u'r friends colleagues etc are wrong. being a kid is when u'r acting all childish like trying to be "cute" thats a kid. u'r right and someday u will find that Mr Right. u dont hav to improve for anything its just being u'rself which is fine.|`|593f5a959e494d93b72266dbf2f2bd3faa	a kid? no. naive, absolutely. god is not going to bring you mr. right, you have to meet him half way. sleeping beauty and cinderella are not real. wake up, grow up, and maybe you will meet mr. not to bad.|`|90faa4cd94ef7f4fc6117ba415c52a62aa	U RNT KID BY YOUR AGE , BT YOUR THINKKING .<br>  U NEED TO BCME ELDER N MATURE BY GROWING AGE .<br>  U HAVE TO CHANGE WITTH TIMES N INDULGE IN ACTIVITIES N CONVERSATION WHICH IS MEANT FOR THAT AGE ONLY .<br>  U WL SURE GET UR MR.

Please be true to yourself, people just try to put you down to pull you down to there level. Don't question yourself, they wouldn't be questioning you if they didn't have doubts about themselves.|`|jxizzHL1aa	At 22 you're a woman, there's no two ways about it.  But it does sound like you're kinda sheltered/haven't lived enough.  But it's cool that you stick to what you believe in.  In a way it's admirable even if you did still watch cartoons.|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	Live your life the way you are.  As long as you're being professional at work when you need to be, it doesn't matter how you act outside of work.  Whatever makes you happy, do it.|`|Osmyhvc7aa	YES!!!!!!!  You need to do something while you are still young!!!!!  Before you know it, you will be 50 and wasted your entire life away without doing anything fun or special in your younger years.|`|lM9OwEiNaa	uh, NO! You are like you should be, and you do NOT LOOK LIKE A KID, LOL! You sound like you act mature|`|McXwX0hEaa	your smart<br>  do not listen to people <br>  they are flawed <br>  enjoy life as you wish not as others do|`|G2OdDlmjaa	im 13 and i do everything you dont|`|wd0WYcHKaa	Great Friends...|`|1EB7fbxpaa	Don't listen to those idiots. Just be yourself.|`|mDBHMJPjaa	life is to short..live it up the way you want|`|AimszmSTaa	You need to go with your instincts but don't be afraid to take chances, you should do whatever it is that makes you happy and not worry so much about what they say or think even though that might not be as easily done as it is said. And as far as flirting and sick discussions and adult jokes go, if that's being done where you work and it offends you, that could be stopped by letting someone know. Otherwise outside of work it's a matter of personal preference if you find that acceptable or not and if you choose to be around it or not.|`|uJ9waJDYaa	I think you should just ignore them. That if just you identity. If you are not interested in dirty jokes or flirting then fine, you can do what you want. Just because you haven't had several relationship or don't laugh or make dirty jokes doesn't mean you are a kid.<br>  You just have interests else where and different beliefs, If i were you id just tell them that, and bullS. you don't need to improve! What would they rather you be? A lady of the street, talks openly about your sex life or other peoples. Stuff them, you are an adult and you are just being responsible and sensible the way you know how to and feel good about.|`|yKZQoLDoaa	Honey, you are on the right track, keep thinking like that and you will be just fine in life!<br>  <br>  Make your own decisions, be a leader NOT a follower, dump the haters that you call friends who are either teasing you or telling you what you need to improve on in your life.<br>  <br>  GOD IS LOVE....you are absolutely right! Believe in him as he believes in you! Because he is the one you need to impress, NOT your friends, they are not going to be there when you are gone, it will only be you by yourself facing Christ...just something to keep your head up! <br>  <br>  P.S. No one is perfect...
QLhuYWmxaa	i think of it this way, i can get a guy very easily so why worry? and besides if  he really loved me he would've stayed with me and not broke up with me|`|802039e497fd4fd85be4b25a60fcf29faa	grow some balls|`|OPoFnRbmaa	she'll be back and make up sex is always the best anyway....hope that makes you feel better.|`|imCW8574aa	make yourself busy...that way you have less time thinking of her...just be BUSY...try it!|`|mrtVjheRaa	eat ice cream

You control the conversation by asking questions. Ask her about herself and she will talk and talk and talk. Look around the room. Make comments about things you see especially if they are funny. Ask her opinion on things. Ask her questions about a track meet or workout or her running shoes or whatever. Here's the tricky part. After you ask the question...shut up and listen! Then ask her questions about things she is talking about. **** luck to you!|`|0DdSoi4Maa	Well that was about 7 years ago for me.  If you haven't known her for years & I'd ask something like; "so how long have you been running track?"  Or maybe, "do you get this class, do you like the teacher, how are you doing in here."  I'd just ask her something about track or the class.  Or maybe make a comment about the weather, like dang it's cold outside or I'm ready for it to be hot.  Hope this helps, good luck ;)|`|tsNMMLMUaa	Compliment her without going to far. Just remember girls can tell when you are trying to hard.<br>  <br>  Say something nice, and then just walk away.<br>  <br>  Don't treat her like a piece of meat, and don't keep trying to talk about her looks. It is pretty rude, even if you are always saying good things. Talk about her interests not her hair or face or anything.|`|BjYgRy7laa	Ask her about track training and nutrition and if maybe you could train together|`|ZKESDOrraa	start off with small talk.|`|1EB7fbxpaa	Ask her what she is doing this weekend.|`|07HWkV4eaa	WTF Kind of name is that? Speak gd english.|`|pl2SocVKaa	Quit Crying you just burned how bout them French Fries but<br>  yeah Emily G is right with the starter platter conversations but if your trying to get something serious with her your gonna should talk about her interests and then give her gifts maybe and get to know her and then you can get the prize|`|67dWrrH9aa	just say hey you look nice today =) and go from there. she'll like the compliment|`|pvosPN40aa	Walk up to her and tell her that your the one responsible for all the crop circles.

Then just go from their|`|Oa4QZGXSaa	give her a compliment on something she is wearing, then walk away, she is expecting you to keep talking to her, but if you don't she will come back to you.|`|pOi0wewIaa	You could talk about anything like about your likes or dislikes. You could ask her a Q about anything. Just be yourself and just start talking to her.|`|Fqq2OFmVaa	I like Emmy G's Answer, and talk about stuff that happened in school.|`|cNZAO5BRaa	"Hey, so what did you think of track practice the other day?" (She answers.) "Yeah, I thought so too. Maybe after practice this Friday [or whenever your next practice is- DON'T make it unspecific like 'sometime next week'; pick a day and say it specifically] we can hang out afterwards, just the two of us?" (She says yes- hooray! She says not on that day, she can't for some reason, pick the next practice day and ask her about that day. If she says no, pick the next practice after that. If she says she can't again, play it cool and say "No biggie. I'll see you around." If she flatout denies you the first time and says she doesn't want to... don't worry about it. There'll be other girls.)|`|oZ5QPymuaa	Haha even a top contributor needs help lol ok well<br>  since you are in some of her classes talk about those classes. be like ooh dont u think that math test was hard or man this track meet is going to be difficult. Small talk basically. talk about these things and then u can move on to talking about personal things and make sure to give her plenty of attention :)|`|QOlZ9qv0aa	She  is  probable  feeling  about  the  same.  Smile,  compliment  her  on  one  thing.  Smile.  Later  ask  about  a  class thing.  Then  later  ask  if you can  call her. On  phone  be  honest  you  are  some  what  shy. Dont  aggervate  parents  calling  too often  and  talking  too  long.|`|EeQ6qL52aa	Be like hey what's up.

NLi51W1Saa	thats exactly how i was at first lol the best thing for me was just to do it no matter how awkward it was, just have plenty of things to talk about beforehand so it doesnt get more awkward than it has to lol. and dont be afriad to step up to the plate because obviously he's just as nervous, hope this helps:) good luck.|`|h1HBi53vaa	i have been in the exact same spot as you are in now.<br>  just start off small, i know it is a lot easier to talk over the computer but you don't just want an online relationship.<br>  just walk up to him and ask him how his day is going so far.<br>  or get a random question that will make him laugh and hopefully spark something.<br>  good luck |`|tMHdxxnJaa	Just talk normally, it doesn't have to start off serious to be a good relationship. Just talk to him like one of your other friends and eventually things will even out.|`|PcPq61cqaa	i think since its your first relationship its going to be akward a lil but just go talk to him and kinda break the ice first it will work out if you dont let it get to akward|`|fd5f3e1adfc3aca438e6dabb1cf19fb5aa	get over the awkwardness together. =]<br>  thats what my boyfriend and i did. almost 3 years ago =]|`|8eBfFxPnaa	just talk to him its just another person

It cracks me up. I don't think a lot of teens even know what love is anymore.|`|5qAUsXzfaa	OMG!!!  That is great...Sounds like a lot of people that I knew growing up.  I actually know adults that can still be like that.  I know a chick that's 25 and been "engaged" 10 times...Funny, some people never change.  LOL|`|Bx7F9jscaa	It's both funny and sad. Hah.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	I don't think it's funny nor sad.  I think it's a pretty normal teenage reaction to emotions that they are just learning to deal with.  When you young and infatuated you think it's gonna be forever.  When it ends it feels like the end of the world.  It's just normal and helps most people deal with adult relationships a bit more realistically...|`|ngz4s4VVaa	hahahhahahahha OBVIOUSLY i think its HILARIOUS when teenage "couples" do that. This girl i used to be friends with would do that, except she would be with the guy for only WEEKS and then break up and then start all over, she's said "i love you" and "forever" to more guys than i have fingers for. I think its sad and funny, sad cus this generation of kids is so DAMN STUPID it gives us mature teens a bad name. But funny cus you cant help but laugh at these dumb a s s e s! I even bet with my family how long until a certain coulple breaks up lol its quite funny.|`|MJyM1XWJaa	It's sad but it's a part of growing up. We are taught to seek love from disney movies to valentine's day to the wedding INDUSTRY. So naturally, from a young age people seek it and think they have found it. And when you're young, you tend to be pretty naive. <br>  <br>  It's just part of growing up though.|`|V27IROySaa	I understand where your coming from in a sense...because I knew a lot of these silly relationships when I was in high school.  <br>  <br>  However, not all high school relationships are like this.  I started dating my boyfriend when we were 16 and we are in our mid-twenties now and are still together!  <br>  <br>  We never did the whole breaking up and getting back together thing though...at least...not until college!|`|xXGn1zfsaa	So true.<br>  Sadly, I don't know if it's just something that happens with Cali kids, but ALL the girls usually about 17 and under are like, "OMG I LUV MY BOYFRIEND.

And they all tell their 'bf/gf' that they love them but i mean... They say that to every 'partner' they have, so "I love you" also becomes meaningless, so i do find it very sad.<br>  <br>  Though, they are just having fun and learning while their young, but I do think certain and important things become meaningless over time from having several bfs and gfs at a young age.|`|K7Rqrpesaa	It's kinda irritating. I've seen it a lot and I just feel like people miss-use "love". Who knows... they may have actually loved the person, but I really personally just feel you can only truly love ONE person whole heartedly. All the other times it's usually just infatuation... or lust ;)<br>  But yeah... it's kinda sad, a waste of emotion and time.|`|UNhYZMoWaa	So true lol,<br>  <br>  When I was a teen.  I liked boys but I was shy and reserved so spent my time in the library studying.  However my younger sister who is only 16 has had boyfriends since she was 12.     <br>  <br>  It's always she loves this one guy and he is going to be her one and only 4 eva  and they would get married etc.  Only with in weeks they break up and she thinks the guy is the scum of the Earth.  Then she moves on to other guys.   Which around our town she has been labelled a hoe.      <br>  <br>  I have truely been in love once and the guy and I have our ups and downs and I have cried over him etc but we are still together lol.      Great question though :)|`|bitKsIPkaa	Funny because of how naive a lot of people are. Sad because I make the same mistakes and tell people I love them. Sad because I always realize I don't really love them. Funny because sick masochistic me always goes back to get hurt a little bit more.<br>  <br>  A little of both? Haha.<br>  <br>  P.S. <br>  Hope you don't get told off. People on here can get a little ridiculou every now and then :P<br>  <br>  Night!<br>  <br>  Or I suppose possibly day?<br>  <br>  lol|`|HCzZClfvaa	Heys,<br>  I be a teenage girl and think it is incredibly funny! <br>  Watched it many times and the same people keep repeating everything<br>  It's hard to see my friends go through that and it would suck if was me but when you take a step back and look at the 'larger picture' i can't help but laugh.|`|ymqRux3xaa	It's just an emotional roller coaster where teenagers eventually learn which qualities to look for in a dating relationship to spot the ones that will not last early on. It's sad but it's also a learning process that never actually gets resolved but hopefully gets understood.|`|zq7EgC4Xaa	I think it's just part of growing up. It is a very special feeling. It's worth the tears, in my opinion...liking someone that much. I think that's what makes teen years so special...that we can feel things THAT STRONGLY and still not have it be "love" necessarily. I love that about being a teenager, and yes, it's happened to me before.|`|1vKY3Usaaa	you know;<br>  their kids.<br>  their dumb.<br>  their hormones are all over the place.<br>  its a normal thing.<br>  we were all like that.<br>  you know you were too.<br>  and so was i.|`|tXU4dkyoaa	i totally agree teenage relationships are totally unnecessary and they should be illegal, their is absolutely no benefit from these relationships, they make me sick!lol|`|Zue2XXQOaa	I would agree. It's stupid. Teenagers are very stupid. But that's just how it works.|`|U286XG21aa	Its funny but at the same time their teens.. Most of the time they dont really even know what love is...|`|qnqTjRZoaa	well its true and funny.  Probably only funny when you look back on it years later.  Its sad when you're in it|`|pFjgBBUZaa	it's not funny nor sad, it's just a learning experience and some learn it the first time and some never learn it :).|`|YWjhqlxbaa	Circle of life.|`|qpAl6EGTaa	that funny lol|`|gmBzMFDLaa	i dont think its either.<br>  <br>  its not funny.<br>  its not sad.<br>  its just interesting.<br>  because its the process of learning.<br>  <br>  oh, and when you're a teen and you "think" youre in love, you probably are.<br>  <br>  just because somebody is younger, doesnt mean they arent capable of loving like an adult.<br>  love is like cooking cookies.<br>  <br>  the first time you bake the cookies, your mommy helps you.<br>  the second time, you get to help make the dough and put them on the pan<br>  the third time, you have memorized the recipe.<br>  BUT.. that doesnt mean the first time you WERENT baking cookies!<br>  <br>  you were just in different stages, like in love.<br>  <br>  so saying "they think their in love" isnt always true.<br>  they were probably in love, but just ruined it.<br>  <br>  adults do it too.<br>  <br>  and its not funny<br>  and its not sad<br>  its just interesting..<br>  its a learning process...<br>  <br>  <br>  im in highschool and believe that i was in loved wtih my last boyfriend.<br>  we broke up, like you said.<br>  i weeped and got mad<br>  and said i wont love again<br>  <br>  BUT, i learned so much.<br>  and now, im in a new relationship, and FROM MY LAST realtionship, i learned so muchhh! now this relationship is going much smoother.<br>  <br>  so DuDE, u should go out there, like YOUR FRIENDS and try a relationship instead of just thinking about ur friends relationships<br>  <br>  because chances are.. their next few relationships will be much more mature than their last.<br>  <br>  and learning and getting more mature about love choices ISNT FUNNY OR SAD AT ALL|`|EkTaBfdcaa	haha<br>  yeah i think its dumb.<br>  <br>  they obviously arent mature enough yet for an actual relationship.<br>  im still a teen. and when my bf broke up with me, yeah it sucked. haha<br>  but really.<br>  whatever!<br>  i dont care haha<br>  ill find someone else :P<br>  he was a whore anywhoos.<br>  hahahahaha|`|X9GkF5d1aa	me and this girl were together 2 years ago for 3years...we broke up i met a girl and stayed with her for a year i then left her for my the same girl i broke up with 2 years ago...we are now engaged and she might be pregnant...love is love if its ment to be it will come back|`|OPNRw0NLaa	I think it's hilarious :D. Especially when the kids involved are 12/13.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	Very true & funny.<br>  <br>  it does happen<br>  god bless x|`|K1UicE7kaa	It is a learning process to get a set of communication and  appropriate behavioral skills down.  Also, to develop some maturity for when the dress rehearsals are over and you will have some idea of what a real life commitment is all about.  It is a painful evolution... but, important!  I don't see it as funny as it is pathetic sometimes.  The learning curve is very individual... some never get it.
RmhaaUpHaa	I only had 1 ex boyfriend and I never wasted money for him nor give him anything. Whenever we had a date or go out, he's the one spend money and gave me everything I want. We just lasted for two months because I'm not really in love with him. I just pity him.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, my current boyfriend whom I really love, I gave him wristwatch  which costs 105$.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	Mind was $14,000.00.

If he's maily talkin about u, and wanting to get to know u then he likes u.  If he called to talk about himself and his day ect... He likes u as a friend.  If he called to ask to borrow something, or ask u for a favor, he's using u.|`|WDGPrlEUaa	that very nice..<br>  its an healthy start..<br>  this guy likes you and would love to know you better..<br>  he kind of wants to know what kind of a person are you..<br>  he likes youu!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <3
K9MJwEVkaa	to me It just sounds like you haven't met the right girl yet.....I understand the whole friend zone thing because I've been there....there are girls that want a nice guy I've found one.....keep looking it will happen one day|`|YWcFDQ7zaa	I think it's because you are a very nice, laid back guy. Right? I think girls are so at ease with you because you don't demand something of them like alot guys do. You are a nice, sensitive guy and girls tune into that, they are so at ease with you, it's more like a friendship then anything. Believe me tho, when you find the right one, it will happen. Don't change who you are :)|`|psB5SKjbaa	maybe because you act to much of a friend...they see you more as a friend that's a boy...than an actual boyfriend...<br>  <br>  I have friends that are boys...there not gay either...but i just can't see myself going out with them...there to much of a "pal"..<br>  <br>  =)
RgdMyEq7aa	Don't drive her around anywhere. Seriously how does this girl get places?? A bus won't even drive that slow. If she says she will break up with you over this then it's not worth your time to drive her places that would be quicker to get to by biking. I would think the police would stop you for obstructing traffic.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Sorry mate, get a new g/f.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	My fiance and I can't stand each others driving and both of us have let each other know, but that doesn't mean we are going to break up. We will still drive with each other in the car and since it is already known, we keep quiet about it. There is no use arguing because we both know we aren't going to change our habbits. We have been together for almost three years and getting married. Go ahead and let her leave because you don't need someone like her. Either you accept the person for who they are, or don't be with them.|`|bAnyRNZUaa	Throw her out of the car while you are doing 110 around a hairpin turn...don't put up with that crap.  Tell her she can drive from now on (saving you gas $$) or you'll buy her a pink crash helmet, but that's all you'll compromise.<br>  <br>  Man, she's testing you! Stand up for yourself and don't let her walk on you!|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	Break up with her, or tell her to walk and meet you there.

She must be extremely stressed out, so reassure her that you will be there for her and whatever could be wrong with her the doctors will treat. Worrying won't help anything and she should just focus on fixing whatever is wrong. I'm sure its nothing too serious, but good luck.|`|NxHExauOaa	Make her a BUILD A BEAR. Tell her that even when you can't be there, that this bear will be there for her to hold and squeeze whenever she gets scared.<br>  <br>  Let her know that you aren't going to leave her for any reason dealing with her health. Support her. Be there for her. Let her cry and vent to you. Hugs and kisses on the forehead are subtle, but very comforting gestures.|`|uVimZ7T8aa	Well actually NEVER say everything is gonna be okay. Make sure shes comfyy and maybe get her her favorite type of flowers so she can look at them and think of you. Get her a cute stuffy and tell her "I love You"|`|4mCPrgHZaa	let her know shes not alone and that you love her<br>  but also be prepared if its bad news and she tries to push you away just know its because shes upset|`|RBrQMBY2aa	spend every second you can with her and tell her that you are there to listen if she needs to unload|`|0YyKdGETaa	she will be fine no worries ^_^ I been  sick for the last few months on and off like crazy and real bad too.

120fa8a58f89d9395f170c90eb592af1aa	Saliva doesn't give any STDs, sex on the other hand, does.|`|UYfeRLxwaa	Kissing does not lead to HIV (rare cases, cuts/sores in mouth on both partners). Nor, STDS (cold sores, yes, potentially). <br>  You should never have sex with someone you are unfamiliar with unprotected or even at all; the risk is huge. If you are really going to "make love", you wouldn't have brought up this question in the first place. Please, be safe rather than sorry - there are some things you cannot take back.|`|C7C3vVeYaa	Yeah it gives you ******* aids bro never do it.|`|9ib0tC9Waa	I read that if you get pugh saliva from making out you can get HIV but enough saliva is a few gallons or more than humanly possible.|`|6r6s5AfXaa	You can get oral herpes from kissing someone if thats what you mean.
9Nm05PWnaa	you say he's your best friend? so does that mean he makes you feel better then your boyfriend? go with the best firned|`|LTRgZwQ5aa	sweetie, you don't want to mess up a good thing. If you bring your feeling out into the open, it just may mess up a good friendship, but on the other hand, they say the best relationships started out as best friends. So it's really up to you if you want to take the chance. Good-Luck!|`|TzaHGixdaa	OHH STRESS! Ok if you really think your friend likes you the way you do well then talk to him BUT it could be just a phase. become a bit flirty with him and see how he reacts, dont over do it tho because if he doesnt feel the same it could change things between you, altho if your feelings are the same about your boyfriend you must really like him more than you think.. my advice is to stay with your boyfriend and if you still feel this way in a few weeks well then go for it if you think he feels the same!! good luck hope it works out for you :)|`|xNwGejCdaa	Do the right thing ... the ethical and moral thing. Practice ...<br>  Do unto others as you would have them do unto you <br>  it's been my experience what goes around comes around and when it comes around you better watch out!

No nagging about picking up the clothes, or taking out the trash, or that annoying thing he does before he goes to sleep (hypothetical) But what are you going to do if you ever have children or become pregnant. I'm sure your child wont be amused by the fact that their daddy lives in a separate house.|`|RrDXAtJUaa	hmm... can't believe I didn't think of this.<br>  I think it's a great idea if it works for all parties involved!!!|`|SAYMX5e5aa	See Marriage is a mutual understanding and only when you love your partner deeply,should you get married.<br>  You need to adjust,with your partner,try and be calm and accept anything your partner says and apologise,if you did not.<br>  If you take anything seriously,then your marriage will end...<br>  So marriage is like a thing that is in both the ends of a thread,so if you are not balancing properly or taking care of....|`|cee5af603d7d3aced648eac2d0c9832faa	I LOVE MY HUSBAND TO DEATH, WE ARE VERY MUCH IN LOVE AND WE BEEN TOGETHER 9 YEARS MARRIED 6.

2e103842ea492d6dca1571e0a0df8befaa	I used to be a wedding coordinator. The 2nd to last wedding I coordinated, the mother of the bride was just unbearable. It didn't matter what her daughter wanted. She found a problem with everything from the location of the ceremony to her invitations to the food for the reception. The bride was so stressed out. My advice to her was to find one thing they could agree on but then to make it very clear in a very loving way that this is their wedding and not her mom's wedding. If she didn't stand up to her mom, it was going to only be the beginning of her trying to control her married life. <br>  <br>  I understand your dilemma about when the best time would be to have your ceremony based on your schedules. You guys have to work out what works best for YOU. New Year's Day or New Year's Eve, those who love and care for you will be there for you. Not everyone goes out and gets wasted on New Year's Eve, so please don't let that deter you from having your wedding on NYD. <br>  <br>  You and your fiance need to decide if that is what works best for you and then go from there. Neither of you should be made to feel like you have to have the wedding of someone else's dreams and not your own. Perhaps you can allow your mother in law to be to give a couple of suggestions as to where the reception should be held. Not saying it has to be that. However, I would try to include her in something. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind though, if she starts to become overbearing, then you have to let her know that if she's not willing to work with you and your fiance, then you're going to have to ask her to not be involved. And I would let her know that it is VERY hurtful (at least to her son) that she would threaten to not come to support him on this very special occasion because she can't get her way. <br>  <br>  I'm telling you, if you guys don't put a stop to it now, it's going to overflow into your married lives. If you're able to stand up to her now, you'll become empowered to stand up to her later on down the road. <br>  <br>  Congratulations! And Best Wishes to both you and your fiance!|`|AA11996507	Sheesh, stop agonising already!  Stick with the date you've chosen and ignore his moronic mother.  If she wants a mid-summer religious ceremony, tell her to get married herself, then she can have everything the way she wants it.  At this point, it looks like your fiance has hit the nail on the head.  It's probably best if his mother does not even come to the wedding if the only way she can be involved is by demanding that everything be done her way.|`|1179ac1ef69ec53031ff43e46bee7a38aa	Refusing to speak to her son over this is a pretty strong response. It sounds to me like there's more going on here than a squabble over the exact date of your wedding. Could your mother-in-law 2B be more upset that you are not having the wedding of her dreams than about the date itself? Is she generally a control freak? Could she perceive your rejection of a church wedding as a rejection of her and her values?<br>  <br>  If you feel like compromising, you could always look for a different location for the wedding--somewhere that might have Jan 2 open. At any rate, the event is more than 10 months away. Hopefully she'll come around by then. In the meantime, you may want to bone up on family systems theory. The family you're about to marry into sounds like it has its share of problems. You and your fiance might benefit from a few couples counseling sessions, or at least some conversation about how you expect to interact together in the marriage, especially in times of disagreement or conflict. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|crxbob5jaa	Actually I think Jan 1 will be a good day. Your wedding party will have something to do for New Year's Eve. They will be at a wedding rehearsal & maybe dinner with you. <br>  <br>  While the mother has a point, she is trying to control the two of you. If she controls you now, will she get mad when you tell her you are pregnant and when the baby is due. Will she tell you it's bad timing? Even though she has a point about the wedding date, it's not her decision. And when she "threw a fit" because she wasn't getting her way, that's when I stopped caring what she has to say. She's his mother, but she shouldn't be allowed this behavior. She's blackmailing him into doing what she wants. This will last forever if he doesn't stop it now.|`|zYt0kPtzaa	Go away for the wedding, elope to a nice destination maybe where you are going on honeymoon and get married,<br>  if she is that hard up about the date then she needs to get over herself, she is being selfish.<br>  <br>  Personally i have had the same problem, my hubby and i eloped and it was the best thing ever.|`|pcI25NXzaa	He needs to talk it out with her.

First things first, don't let her ruin what should be a very happy and exciting time for you!! - its not every day that you set a wedding date.<br>  <br>  I think you should just ignore her for now.  She sounds like such a control freak that curiosity will get the better of her eventually and she will probably come sniffing around for some involvement.<br>  <br>  If you go ahead with making your plans, it will show her that you two are your own people who can make your own decisions.  If you give in to her, she will ALWAYS try to control your lives.<br>  <br>  She will calm down eventually and if it ever comes up again about "her feelings" you can kindly explain that although her feelings aren't really a major factor in YOUR wedding, you did take her into consideration, you thought about it and decided what she wants isn't what you two want.<br>  <br>  For now, just try not to stress out about it too much, it will sort itself out - there is no point being unhappy.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the wedding plans.|`|uh5DlJzqaa	As far as i'm concerned its not her wedding and she's not the one getting married, so.. she shouldnt ***** about it.

Also, i think new years day might not be the best time, everyone wants to be out drunk on new years eve and you dont want a bunch of hung over people at your wedding! if you are going for the numbers thing try 01.10.10 just a week later and still similar to your original number thing. Plus, its a winter wedding like you wanted so you wont feel like you are giving into your Mother in laws demands as much. It might help if you made her think that it was her words that made you decide to switch the date to a later time, then she'll feel appreciated and be more willing to cooperate. She may still offter more suggestions, and just listen and smile, and say "that sounds great! let me talk to (fiance's name) and i'll let you know what we think!" Then you can have him break the news to his mom, so that you wont be the bad guy and she'll like you better, because after all, a mother wont hate her own son over his wedding plans.

65736225dc1841e9fc293d8a138baf94aa	Forget him?  Never!!  I think you mean get over him.  Let me share this with you. It took me almost two years, you know why?  I’m glad you asked.  It took me two years because I expected him to apologize for hurting me.  I want him to tell me why he did what he did.  I felt like he owed me something. The truth of the matter is he didn’t owe me anything, he never was going to apologize, and he didn’t need a reason to do what he did to me.  The bottom line is you must forgive and move on.  Having animosity in our hearts and holding a grudge only hurts us.  You will be the person that can’t sleep at night, can’t eat, can’t work, depressed, lonely and defeated not him.  When you forgive him is when you will get over him.  You will always love him because once upon a time you and he was one person.  It’s like a death, you go through all the pains of death, what helps is number one pray and ask God to give you strength, and to mend your broken heart.  Then secondly act out your emotions!! Do what you emotion tells you to do – cry, scream, run, sleep.  What helped me were numerous walks along the lakefront.  It was if I threw all my problems into the water and the waves took them to a sea of forgiveness.  I love you, be strong and God Bless you.|`|1726b63a2f35b9e54a98101e18d15643aa	You know...in my opinion, life is just a theatrical performance,after all, we are supposed to pay with the same praise.So think that morrow will give you another chance to play a role...why not, the biggest of your entire life.

ca04fb4375fb954bbfca701c7977cda7aa	Remembering a number and using it are two different things.  If you really don't want to talk to this person again, you will eventually forget his number too. But maybe you can't forget because at the back of your mind, you want to contact him.  Why not phone him and see if there is something worth following there.  If not, you will at least get the "I wonder" aspect out of your system, and therefore the number will no longer have any power over you.|`|a7hbM6efaa	im sure you feel something towards the person who possesses that number...you can't remove something out of your system if you know it still has value for you....

8NtjSSkFaa	First of all....does she know where the baby comes out of? OUCH!!!!!<br>  That was enough to scare me when I was a teenager. Giving birth changes your body permanently. Your belly & breast are never the same again (wither you loose the weight or not). Not forgetting, what  happens to your "va-jay-jay".  Or a c-section scare is great when your young and wear a bikini. Those are just the "vanity" disadvantages. And who in the world wants to be an unwed single mother? And is she sure she is going to have a healthy normal baby? What if the child is premature or a special needs baby (born with a mental or physical birth defect)? Because of her age, she is at a higher risk for birthing problems & birth defects (she would be considered  a "high risk pregnancy"). How does life go on for a sixteen year old mother? Is she prepared to care for the possibility of twins? Sounds cute, but a heck of a lot of work. She should go spend a few days with a mom with a newborn.

Io non vorrei che il mio lui restasse con me per questo motivo, vorrei che mi amasse e mi scegliesse ogni giorno per quello che siamo e non per quello che siamo stati!|`|ZCsvioqcaa	Secondo me è possibile. Non razionale, non bello, non giusto. Ma possibile.|`|yaKZNII8aa	siamo (o no?) sulla stessa barca, inconcepibile, inaccettabile, eppure dicono succeda........ e chi se ne frega io voglio pensare che non puo' succedere... tempo per farsene una ragione ci sarà, e comunque nn sarà stato tempo perso, ma vita guadagnata se ci hai creduto davvero con tutto te stesso!
2592731056d68cd57e76207f5ea9e4dfaa	then he doesnt love you if he makes you feel like that. cmon ladies get a clue|`|AA10228460	Tell him how you feel, communication is the key to any good relationship you should be able to tell him anything. If he doesn't change then you have some thinking to do. You can't go on someone "telling" you they love you, he should be "showing" you.|`|bdad824f90eed10293f68f4529f8e84caa	That has happened to me but all you have to do is act like he does toward you and then see what happens! so if is a total jerk towards you then act like a jerk towards him and see what that does.|`|2c110bdfc86eda9432220b793ebd0f1faa	I wouldn't say that you are not dating but he may not be that into you, right now.  Often time guys tend to have moment in relationships where they are completely in love, then they get comfortable, then you are just a part of his life.  You should probably find something to do for you because while you are following behind him asking him..."why are you acting like this?", "talk to me", "whats going on with you?", his is really disliking you but getting some kind of sick pleasure about you sweating him all the time.  <br>  You need to get busy for you and make him wonder..."Dang. why is she not sweating me anymore".  Trust me he will either get it together or you will figure out your or worth more then all those constant tear shed trying to figure out "WHY".|`|6dabccb545734da3346ed4cffe48449baa	This is a little hard to answer because you didn't give any examples to what bothers you.<br>  <br>  Do y'all go out from time to time?<br>  Do y'all know and/or hang with each others friends?<br>  Does he act one way in front of you but another way when others are around?<br>  <br>  A lot of times people expect certain things when in relationships, but you never know how different people can be. I dated a guy & I thought he was ashamed of me because he never asked to go to dinner or movies or anywhere with me. After we talked about it I learned that he wanted to but had never did this with his previous girlfriends so it never dawned on him to ask. After that we went out all the time.<br>  <br>  He may express his love to you totally diffrent from other guys in your past but he's going off his own experience and know-how. In his mind & heart he may feel he's being a great boyfriend to you. You really need to sit down with him & express what's bothering you.
dqeR7BJlaa	A stalker is someone that follows someone around in a creepy fashion. You usually call creepy people that talk to you and follow you around stalkers.
sFdn9hIkaa	It could mean she's interested, but it doesn't have to. If she maintains the eye contact until you completely cross each other though, she probably is curious about you. If she smiles, she's definitely interested.|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	It means you passed her and she's just looking at you.  If it meant something she'd smile or something.  Just cause someone looks at you doesn't mean anything.|`|UYfeRLxwaa	Personally, I do it because I know it makes guys nervous. <br>  Maybe she likes you? Next time you should smile at her and see if she smiles back. If she does, then the next time say something to her.|`|gmBzMFDLaa	it depends if you like her or not.<br>  if you are friends wtih her<br>  if you know her name<br>  <br>  if a girl gives eye contact, she just might not notice<br>  or think you're hot<br>  <br>  soooooo.... just think about it... are you hot?

K1UicE7kaa	Your girlfriend will give you some insight and direction for her parents...she has known them all her life!  <br>  <br>  Most parents just want to see their daughters not dating guys that smoke, drink, drug.  They look for very safe drivers, return home when they are suppose to and go where they say they are going.  They like to see someone that dresses appropriately, speaks and interacts politely and treats their daughter with respect.  It isn't rocket science it is common sense.  It is OK if you are a little nervous or shy... but try to make some eye contact and smile.  After a couple of dates you will have the drill down pat!|`|f8bdbf58f085a611413f7039f0ff211daa	Be yourself. But don't be mean, obnoxious, rude, etc. If the girl is under 17, DO NOT do sexual stuff. It's worse for the girl's parents to find out than the guys. I know a lot of girl's fathers who would beat the crap out of the guy when they find that stuff out. That itself would lead you on the wrong path with your girlfriends parents. Imagine them finding out and everytime you see the parents, the dad stares you in the eye and says, "so, you had sex with my daughter..." and it just makes everything awkward. Just be respectful towards them and especially your girlfriend. Be a total gentleman and not some jackass. Talk to the parents, be friendly and confident (not over confident). Good luck.|`|35EDYBKQaa	just be yourself.|`|CUB3wUdiaa	well if you are a respectful and trustworthy guy then just be yourself and dont be shy.  let them know your  intentions.  basically thats it.|`|f17RMVa3aa	you already sound like an awesome guy,<br>  <br>  just make sure you know what you want to do with your life haha|`|k1AZtmM1aa	why r u dating so young?Do u plan on getting married anytime soon?|`|AhKMDIJNaa	Well if I was the chicks rents I would feel like you were a douche.<br>  <br>  No offense XD<br>  <br>  But what you should do to make a different impression is show me how much and why you like my daughter.<br>  <br>  Be respectful, especially in front of her parents. No kissing. That is awkward moments.<br>  <br>  All I can say is grow those balls man, all you can do is be you. I mean eventually you will have to meet parents. Do it, manly.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|wEcPi6Tvaa	take a shot or two<br>  thats what i did when i had to meet my bf's parents

S3i3MYNtaa	you can search for people in myspace and search for people with similar interests as you. most people will accept strangers if you were to add them. so you can just add randoms and start speaking. if they asked why you added them tell them that you were reading their profile and found this and this interesting about them...or just tell them you're looking for a pen pal type thing?|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Ill be friends but my account is music I deleted my regular one long time ago.

RXzj8vg2aa	Now this i know....High School Drama.  She thrives on getting ppls feathers ruffled.  she probably doesn't have a problem with you.  she just enjoys knowing it makes you mad.  You can ask her if she has a problem with you, and try to work it out, but i would just cut her loose.  It's hard to get over crap like that while still in HS but the first thing that happens when you go to college is you realise just what a waste of time that drama is.|`|jtAV6A6zaa	Maybe she's just being like she usually is...? If you don't know her that well, how do you know that she doesn't do this to most people? I think that's just her personality, let it go and stop talking to her.|`|hid5HDqfaa	Delete her from myspace, to be honest I don't think you should even care a tiny bit about this.
wRQNcFWyaa	Aw yes i seriously do think that you will find that special girl ..<br>  just hold out.. don't be in a rush to find her... <br>  she's out there .. let her come to you .. wait on God for your wife this time<br>  she will most def. have gorgeous gorgeous feet. ?<br>  exspect the unexspected<br>  your a good guy . you have most of the qautiles girls wants these days in a man 1. your healthy 2. great JOB! ? and 3. i'm pretty sure your a good looking man!<br>  you may want to drop some of the female friends.. some women are jealous.. <br>  but yeah try and find a unjealous girl ..<br>  don't stress about it...<br>  you'll meet your soul mate|`|X9W689ZGaa	I was pretty sure the foot-fetisch has been discussed in pop culture for years now? It's one of the most accepted fetisches out there. Personally, I would think it's kinda cute if a guy has a thing for something a little odd and I'd have no problem with a footlover ;)<br>  <br>  Telling girls about your fetisch might not be a good pick up-line, but I'm sure it shouldn't pose any obstacle in a relationship.|`|kQ6TQqX9aa	I always found the foot fetish a little odd, but I totally think you have a chance. It's not really a turn off.|`|vxEDtriRaa	Totally. There's a fetish-match out there for everyone. You just have to keep looking. And if that's your biggest concern I say you'll do fine.|`|3i3cZGadaa	omg i saw this on law and order!!<br>  ok it just means that the section of the brain dedicated 2 sex is close 2 the one for feet.its not totally weird trust me.someone will be fine with it.|`|4u1WVJ3gaa	maybe dont tell a girl that ur obsessed with feet on the first date. . .|`|531okYegaa	i agree with "more jello please" :)|`|5huhAZcXaa	oh you'll be fine.  there are a lot of crazy women out there who will do anything to keep a man.  just not sure how many of them have pretty feet....  Good luck XOXO  :)|`|78UZwiehaa	yea.their is someone that is looking for the tipe of guy like you but you just need to search for her.|`|FVaUV5uPaa	you should find someone there is always someone out there for everyone and that's the same thing for you  One of my friends likes girls feet too and he has a beautiful girlfriend so yes you can find someone|`|LUfY337Jaa	Feet love is good on some terms. Foot massages are wonderful so I think its a good trait.|`|R1rIYqe5aa	everyone has a fetish for something. she might think it's kinda weird but you'll end up laughing about it. just keep it under control lol.|`|Tc6XCvQyaa	aaaaaaaaaaaa... weird but if you feel like it then go for it|`|TtYVE93Raa	im the total opposit|`|WA3AHiLsaa	yes of course! i just gave advice to another foot fetish guy just the other day. i personally think its very cute. you got nothing to worry about. like i said to him. it's not common but that doesn't mean its weird. i like to call it, out of the ordinary. :]|`|Z53MWyWXaa	of course you have a chance. there are going to be plenty of beautiful women out there who are unhappy because their feet don't get paid enough attention as they'd like by men, and you'd be perfect to fill the void :) and maybe you can even join a sex positive group where fetishes are welcomed and you won't feel alone.|`|ZEYp3vcOaa	yes ofcourse you have|`|dzVRvj6Naa	I think there is someone out there for everybody. You will find the perfect person when/where you least expect it. I did :)|`|jhEQGF3Iaa	well, one of my guy friend is also crazy over beautiful legs. it's nothing wrong unless you start to ditch your current girlfriend for a girl who has better legs. Dont be too possess over it because it's never ending as there is always one better than the other. Just find a girl who attract you by her sexy legs and love her as who she is. You love her as a whole and not just her legs.  <br>  <br>  Fion T|`|sUk704xxaa	Yes definetly! As long as you supress your fetish to just your girl. If you live a double life and stare at women and their feet on the internet all day. Then thats a problem. But if you just like feet hey....it is what it is.|`|sgXoWNxOaa	sorta of kinda.....is there anything else u find attractive in a woman?|`|tcrya813aa	That is kinda odd, but I could live with it if I really liked the guy. I wouldn't worry about it. You definitely have a chance baby:)|`|oDzOYMjDaa	I wouldn't mind... As long as a guy loved me for more than my feet... If he likes him then that's fine, once you get to a certain point you're supposed to be able to share everything and every part of your body... Of course you stand a chance...|`|AA11441704	Whatever makes you happy ... I think you will find one.
jtAV6A6zaa	I sorta have the same problem, but my mind only goes blank when I'm talking to the girl...what i do is start with something both of us have in common, like homework or something, and when they respond say "thanks, how was your day?" or something like that. It usually seems to work for me. Just make sure you always respond to something they say, even if you have to start a new topic.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|f17RMVa3aa	so i'm not going to say be yourself because that obviously doesn't help. but before you talk to the girl or anyone for that matter try to think of things to talk about beforehand or maybe some funny jokes, just kinda be prepared<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219222401AAqrwhq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|35EDYBKQaa	just before you talk to her<br>  think of all the things you can talk about so you can have a subject and dont just like go blank or anything.<br>  <br>  just like ask what her fav color is or any random thing like that.|`|dvvQQ6eRaa	Talk about school, pets, movies, tv, books, sport.<br>  <br>  <br>  Please return the favour.

15jfF0tKaa	Kelly honey I'm so sorry. I am a mom too and I think she is stressed out sweetheart. You are so wonderful to have tried to help your brother. And please forgive your mom, she did not mean to yell at you I'm sure. Your not a brat. I would say if you vaccum for her or give her a smile and a hug when she is calm in the morning, offer to do a chore. She should warm up. Where is dad in all this? Please talk to him he is a good person to tell your cares too and he might know how to make things better.  But I think your great!|`|52otNiElaa	I'm sorry moma.|`|MJyM1XWJaa	Wait til she calms down. The approach her and tell her you are sorry for not appreciating the things she does and gives you but you as a 13 year old need to be a child. And while you want to help with your brother, you can't help him figure out the game when he won't let you. <br>  <br>  I mean it is obvious she is displacing some stress from elsewhere on to you and in no way do you deserve this but as an adult she should respect what you are saying and your mature approach.|`|uAzToWC7aa	LISTEN TO ME! YOU ARE NOT A BRAT. YOU ARE JUST STRESSED. WHY DONT YOU LOOK UP LEAPFROG OR WHATEVER ONLINE AND FIND DIRECTIONS. YOUR MOM WILL NOT STAY MAD AT YOU FOREVER. SHE ID=S JUST STRESSED OUT. WHEN SHE STARTS BEING NICER TO YOU, TELL HER TO WATCH AS YOU TRY TO HELP HIM. YOU ARE NOT A DOMN BRAT AND REMEMBER THAT. NO OFFENSE, BUT IN THIS SITUATION YOUR BROTHER IS THE BRAT! IM SORRY YOU FEEL THAT WAY. GET WELL SOON!  : ) LIVE. LOVE.  LAUGH. BE HAPPY. hmmm... what game is it? maybe i can help you.|`|Dl9a08Rxaa	it must be hard for her to have to take care of an autistic child so it understandable that she may get mad or frustrated and may just have some trouble<br>  i can see how its hard for you too always having to help and not having much time for yourself <br>  your not a brat  but maybe you have to understand what its like for your mom and maybe you could also talk to her about what its like for you|`|lcuxD3qlaa	you should have more sympathy towards people who are not as fortunate to have a properly working brain...Plus, its your brother...hopefully one day youll see that you are wrong in this situation...sorry|`|0a92a06fb2c7565638777b7ba8574ec0aa	Just tell her that you'd like to help your brother, but he's really, very uncomfortable with it.|`|tVPyRHEJaa	give her a nice sorry card bought in card store<br>  and nice bouquet of flowers like red roses|`|4crJhN62aa	just say your sorry|`|ytMpRueeaa	ummmmmm what?|`|DM2M5LK4aa	Sounds like a pretty crappy situation to me also.  Your mom may be really stressed out, it happens a lot to moms.  What I suggest is that you approach her calmly and speak reasonably and, again.. calmly.  Tell her that you are doing your best to help him but he will not let you.  Tell her how she screams at you to go away and, instead of telling her the job cannot be done, ask her for her advice on how to fix the situation and accomplish the task of helping your brother.  This is probably your best shot at communicating with her and showing her that you really are trying to do what she asked of you.  I hope this helps.|`|k1AZtmM1aa	Ok well one thing is to tell your brother how it is.You're the elder in that situation and you need to take control.If he fights,you fight back.<br>  With your mom,help her out.It will be hard since you don't really have any respect for her(and i really understand why)and try to earn some money of your own to buy your own things,that way your mom won't have anything on you.I'm about your age and I clean the bathrooms for 30 dollars every 2 weeks.Sometimes I rake leaves or babysit for a good amount of money.It's not too hard to work for money.<br>  And some advice is to also learn to accept no.It's very,very hard but it's worth it.<br>  Honestly I think your mom should apologize for trying to make you feel guilty for favors she did for you cuz your bro yells at you when you try to do what your mom says.<br>  Maybe you could approach her nicely and tell her how you've been feeling.I think she'll try to be an adult in that situation.|`|3pBKQzbRaa	she's being mean to you (Im an adult and I wouldn't talk to a 13 year old like that or expect that 13 year old to know how to handle an autistic child).  Just do the best you can...your brother will be that way because of his condition and you just have to build your own special bond with him... and dont apologize...you dont have anything to apologize for.|`|vD4bjMtXaa	go buy a leapfrog for yo bro(:|`|3cLE5L7Saa	She's not expecting too much of you, but you're brother isn't letting you help.  Theres not much you can do, exept say "why don't you come in here and see for yourself" and then maybe she will get it.  I remember when my little bro was like that....its annoying I know.
rTaaIXSuaa	Don't be confused. <br>  Are you two back together?<br>  If so, she is saying that because she is realizing how precious and fragile your relationship with her is and she almost destroyed it by her actions. It's not everyday that a man (or woman) will have the strength to forgive their significant other of infidelity.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	when you lose something in life. You relise how much it - is worth.<br>  She relised what she lost.<br>  Thats why she said that. <br>  the person she was with. Wasnt wat she had with you<br>  God Bless x|`|yBnmqLZ7aa	maybe she's realizing how big of a mistake she made and she doesn't want to do anything to lose you|`|PK5Elowdaa	Oh Gawd! Dude, make her suffer. Don't take her back right away. Punish her with time. Like 2 weeks of silence before you take her back if you do plan on taking her back. This will teach her a lesson (hopefully). My girl just cheated on me and is still trying to deny it.. Its so sad how females really think men are idiots! I mean come on ladies, we men practically built this world!  My advice, really think before get yourself hurt again. From one man to another...Be careful!|`|DdfoawNCaa	Maybe she wanted to go out and explore other options thinking that she was missing out on something, only to find that what she had in the beginning was the best thing.  Thus, making her love for you stronger. Good luck!|`|UcezPQcjaa	She realized what she had too late

Well what did you think about that new movie, [insert movie].<br>  <br>  And so on. Basically, turn your little greetings into complete sentences.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	Instead of answering with, "Nothing really", tell her about your day at school or work, or about sports practise. If that fails, tell her about a game or show you watched on the telly. Whatever you do, don't gossip about people.<br>  <br>  If these things fail, reconsider your relationship because it may be that you really don't have anything in common.|`|8FiJ5i81aa	idk just b stupid together ask something random. just try and joke around or somethin|`|Osmyhvc7aa	talk about something random and then something will build from that and you'll be talking for hours.
cqMULVB9aa	lol that's sad. You have to be exaggerating. If anything, just bring up something to start the conversation. Like a fun fact, "Hey guess what? Did you know that you can't shed a tear sniffing onions when you're chewing bubblegum?" or bring up some funny or interesting story you have from the past week or something. idk just something!!! But I'll let you in on a little secret here, tease her a lot, chicks dig that. ; )|`|f17RMVa3aa	agreed with that guitar person idk.<br>  <br>  but as her questions then she'll know you are actually interested and want to know about her, i think every girl likes to talk about herself haha.<br>  <br>  ask her what she does in her free time and then ask her out to do what she likes to do. if your convos keep going the way they are she'll think you don't like her and she'll move on if she does like you
ScMwNWhuaa	haha. well if he is ur boyfriend, of course he'll like it! I did that in my first relationship, for the same reason you did. (afraid person wouldn't like it) chances are, he wants the attention just as much as you wanna give it. =) so don't hold back!|`|jvKazMgwaa	I am sure he wouldn't mind, and i think all that that holds you back is just in your head. well you know wat couples do, he wud expect you to do that and i think he will even be glad if you did.|`|I2WKO33Maa	You can't have the answer unless you try to do it, after all nothing will going to be bad, you are his girlfriend so you have the rights to do some actions that girl/boy relationship usually do, the only thing you have to avoid is to look like you are too much displaying your affection..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://FreeTryAcai.com/blog" rel="nofollow">http://FreeTryAcai.com/blog</a><br>  <a href="http://superslim99.blogono.com/" rel="nofollow">http://superslim99.blogono.com/</a>|`|cGNVYpVIaa	well first you gotta make sure there's a reason that you're thinking that way. Is he kind of distant? does he seem to not like you anymore? If that's the case, then just don't hold back, and eventually he'll feel bad and talk to you about it. But if that's not the case, then don't stop hugging and kissing him, or he might start to have second thoughts about your relationship.
7RbootLlaa	He just likes you.
dqeR7BJlaa	show him your ****
O31DgyGTaa	hey! don't worry! I hate being single too :S You jsut feel so lonely and well, I feel like there's nothing interesting in my life. But I don't think you need counselling, some people jsut really need to be attatched and loved. Why can't you get a bf? If you're having problems, I suggest you jsut act normal and not make him feel like you wantto devour him on the first few dates. Don't be too shy to dress yourself up and talk to people - guys are attracted to happy girls, usually (altough im not exactly into those types)<br>  <br>  I'm sure something will come up, everythig takes time, but meanwhile you shouldn't spend your whoel lfie waiting. It's not all about having this ideal guy. Maybe you could do some travelling? you might meet a nice stud at some exotic location.|`|k3KADyEVaa	yeah, it sucks..i'm single and since about a year ago i've been really wanting a gf pretty bad...but whatever. i guess you should just let love come to you and when you don't expect it, it'll come (or so i hear)..also, try being a little more positive..don't worry, you'll find someone.|`|gcsnMAlCaa	You should really focus on yourself in this time.  Sure, it's normal to have moments where you feel lonely and you think about wanting a relationship.  Just live your life and make yourself busy so you don't have to think about being alone.  Find something that you are passionate about and get lost in it.  If you can't be happy alone, you aren't ready for a relationship.  Don't expect another person to make you feel complete.  Worrying about finding someone is not going to help your situation; it always happens when you least expect it.  <br>  <br>  Maybe you need to talk to a counselor if this is causing you physical pain.
eNulfbs7aa	You know..go with your gut...maybe a nice goodbye would be a book about forgiveness...Maybe a Purpose Driven Life...or something with poems..something with meaning...and then write your apology on the inside cover.  It would be something to treasure always and trust me..it would totally work.  Show her you really took time to think about your apology.  Maybe print this out and show her you cared enough to ask the people who know..the people at yahoo answers..you know the saying..when you care enough to give the very best...well you got it baby..Good luck on your deployment.  You guys are my heros!  ILY|`|9bSCOZB1aa	I think you should. Even if she hates you you would regret it if you never even said goodbye. I don't know the extent of her hatred for you, but who knows, maybe just the fact that you had the decency to say goodbye to her will changer her mind about you.|`|K9MJwEVkaa	do what you feel man......if you feel like you should say goodbye then do it ....if not don't.....what is she going to do hate you some more...I mean really|`|g2JqGIOCaa	No.  She hates you, Leave her Alone!<br>  <br>  Stay OUT of her life!  Move on.  It's OVER!!!!|`|3QSiLT2baa	If you like her a lot than I guess yeah. Say bye to her. Just don't expect the biggest hug and an "I'll miss you" back..|`|MZkoojQYaa	Idk your guys' chemistry, but at least a voice-mail message or letter or something. she doesn't want you dead. no one would wish that on anyone. my ex cheated on me and i wouldn't even with that on him. just say good bye somehow. no matter how subtle.|`|UYfeRLxwaa	What do you have to loose? If you want to say goodbye, do just that.

So this kid is throwing a fit because you were honest about your feelings.<br>  <br>  You are not responsible for other people feelings and actions.<br>  <br>  Just go and ask the friend if he told him. Then Right after you know go and talk to him.Tell him how much you didn't mean to hurt him but that you rather be honest with him now than to give him any ideas that would make things even harder for him.<br>  <br>  It'll be ok.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|JH6oCuUZaa	Leave the kid alone.....he expressed interest in you and you did not return it....why should he stick around.|`|cZ2WDB34aa	act like nothing happened|`|CUB3wUdiaa	personally no i wouldnt tell my friend, but i would recommend that you tell him how you feel.  if this cat isnt mature enough to deal with the fact that you would rather be friends than date then hes out of luck.  ive been in that situation before and she didnt tell me that and i assumed she didnt want to be friends at all.  we still talk to this day and were really good friends.  long story short, tell him.  lets the pieces fall where they may!<br>  <br>  ray
84850f63a760f129473caa5eef33fdaaaa	Good question.<br>  <br>      Personally, I think love in unconditional; but in this world we place stipulations on what love should be; that then is how we fall out of love.|`|03llfXdpaa	You can't control your emotions whether it's falling in or out of love. The heart wants what it wants there's no way to control that.|`|60971347eee441a7bcfa07148fa56a5daa	No you can not help who you fall in love with, but if the relationship is abusive yo have to get away. It will take time to fall out of love with anyone when you have been in a relationship for a while, but you can and it will take time, but do not let thjis discourage you from falling in love again.|`|IVcKWm9faa	i don't think we can i don't think someone will intently fall in love with someone that they no is going to miss treat them.|`|3hjjX9lFaa	Now if the relationship is right why would you not want to pursue it and see where this love can leave now with a wrong relationship you have to think if its wrong then how much love is really there for the person that you are falling in love with and yes we are able to have love for a person but yes a person can make you fall out of love it happens in life i hope that you are on the right side of the relationship|`|5OCPF9Fpaa	Love is something that just happens, people can't just flip it on and off like a light switch.|`|AA11195645	You can fall in love but if you check your reasons you will feel it is more of an attraction. This attraction might last a lifetime and can continue to grow as you mature. However, once your feeling of love is no longer fed or being returned by your partner so it can at least maintain if not grow, you will fall "out" of love. You will find that the attraction has been replaced by boredom and subconsciously you will be looking for the positive feeling of being "in" love, perhaps somewhere else.<br>  At the very best, you fall in love, nurture the love and trust in the other person, with your partner doing the same thing, and you will have a mature bond that will last a lifetime and will never die.|`|AA12134041	PLEASE WAKE UP GIRL You can't be in love if it is wrong, love is the only true thing that's never wrong so if what you have is wrong than your not in love.|`|jGel6gZCaa	love is a wonderful thing and you cant help who you fall in love with. it just happens when it does and sometimes its who we least expected it to be. this i know to be true. and we fall out of love just as easy as we fell in love.|`|lbgzGW5oaa	Yeah. If the other person is married, you need to find some one else. There are 6 billion people in the world.|`|e4gYOgCmaa	Love is a very powerful tool that has emotions as gasoline on the fire. With alot of negative you can convince yourself that this isnt for you and fall out of love. I have done it. It took a long time though. If we fall out of love easily then was it really love|`|P8WAKaWBaa	No we can not help who we fall in love with but we can choose who we chose to deal with in a relationship be careful and make good choices...and could you please answer my question

For me, it depends if I like the guy or not.. but if I don't like him more than a friend I would just get annoyed that he texts too much and it is actually a bit of a turn off. But if i like the guy, or he's my bf then I would want to text him all the time. I would suggest texting often but not too often to creep her out, and not too seldom because she might think you're not interested.|`|3QSiLT2baa	Well.. hard-to-get gets annoying sometimes. It can send off a bad message too.<br>  <br>  <br>  Some girls like it when you text them non-stop; some don't.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Experiment.|`|gmBzMFDLaa	play hard to get. thats the way to go. make HER want YOU<br>  anyway, girls like the "chase"<br>   just be like (in txt) "hey how u doin" <--- dont use a question mark! that looks desperate!<br>  <br>  dont look desperate, shy, or OBSESSED with her.

c4fNS7Iuaa	Tell them exactly what you told us. It doesn't sound demanding or rude. It sounds like a nice, caring person is being taken advantage of and needs some help because she can't do it all on her own. <br>  <br>  They're grown. They should understand.|`|R9zaR2mQaa	I have the same problem and I just choose to grin and bear it.  When it gets too bad, I just suck it up and clean.  My situation is too perfect (REALLY low rent) to complain too much.  Oh ya, I'm a guy living with two women.  And people say men are messy....|`|BtvlBwy1aa	Well.... if you don't want to just come off of it and say it or ask them to help... and if it is your FIANCE they need to get their butt up anyways because you don't want to do that for the rest of your life. You don't want him to get the impression you are a house wife if that is not how you want it to be. If you are fine with doing all the cooking and cleaning and raising, that's fine... <br>  <br>  Anyways- you could stop cleaning the extras also. You clean your stuff and only your stuff like they do- it's gonna get pretty messy pretty fast. You think they would notice? If they did, THEY might be the ones on here and soon they could be the the ones trying to get everybody to help. If not, you should come out and say it.
BlVJCUUJaa	use the money to buy materials to make her a personal card|`|BtvlBwy1aa	get friends to pitch in, parents stuff like that. Or you could get candy, or balloons and stuff for fun.

They always have nice things cheap like lip gloss, or barrettes, jewelry that's been marked down. You could take the two bills and look on an oragami website about how to turn the bills into oragami animals or rings. Thrift stores are great for finding special unique things for real cheap too. How about a book of coupons that you make up yourself where each coupon is good for something special that you can do for her. Everytime I made those for family and friends they loved them! I'd put a coupon for an hour back rub, or free house cleaning, good for dinner cooked by me, or a half hour of hair brushing. Ya know, get creative...you can even make it funny like by making one say, will clean the link out of your belly button for free. ya know something goofey like that. She'll get a huge kick out it and it will only cost $2 bucks for some construction paper to make it. Good luck!|`|c4fNS7Iuaa	You can buy a poster board for like $1 and write her a birthday card.

5w4KLsMRaa	I would pray about it and put it in Gods hand, it has to be horrible to live in fear this way. It sounds like you felt like you was losing your mother to the alcohol  or did you? Just relax and everytime you feel that way just say a little prayer and let it go. there is nothing you can do to keep someone from dying by worrying anyway, you are just keeping yourself uptight. Think Possitive and have Faith.|`|PHhKrdqsaa	Dear i understand what you feel.at times in life we get such fears especially those who we adore in life let us down or do things that we never imagined thye could do. but please remember as much as we value the impotrnat others we got our lives to as much as they have their lives.So, please try be strong, and most important pray God....it works and He will deliver you from such illusions. all the bset and God bless

ajgC0KPhaa	You can always meet a guy at school. There's losts of boy/girl activities where you just happen to bump into a cool guy.<br>  <br>  Go to a club. (I'm talking about the "friendly and respectful" kind of club, not the "wild and crazy" kind.) Guys go there because there is something in the character of the club that attracts them to it.<br>  <br>  You could also be a waitress. If a cool guy is at a restaurant, he probably goes there more than once.<br>  <br>  Reply to my question? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AinzwVQsVwT.H1baqD3FS9Xty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090212210557AAl3UEa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  .
EAwgYjYGaa	You need to let him go.  He's got someone else he cares more about if he has another girlfriend.  Think about it, if he has the option to have you but he chooses to be with someone else that means he likes them more than he likes you.  Movie's lead us to believe one day he's going to miraculously change the way he feels about you but Movie's aren't real.  The only way to make him realize how much he needs you is to cut him out of your life.  Tell him you love him but can't handle being just his friend because it's not fair to you (which it's not).  If you cut him off and he comes back and wants to start a relationship and call you his girlfriend than all of your sorrow goes away. If you cut him off and he let's you go then he wasn't the right person for you.  You need to think of something to keep you busy after you cut him off because the first month is going to be REALLY hard but it gets better after that.|`|3QSiLT2baa	I think for a good-bye you should kiss him.

Spend some time alone, and allow yourself to think, watch a chick flick, and pig out on junk food. Just have some alone time or hang out with another friend for awhile. The space between you and your best friend will allow things to cool down. And don't worry, whatever happens happens, and you will find someone who loves every little quirk and thing about you. Good luck, dear! :)
535c6b37a43491751caf29b3ce1fdd51aa	Well, if he's young, he'll act weird around you if he likes you.  Sounds like that may be the case.<br>  <br>  If he is older, like 15 or 16+, maybe he knows you like him and his friends tease him about it, and he is not sure if he likes you back.|`|cgc9vdEsaa	he's teasin u
SIzKIe1iaa	Hmm. Firstly, do not do the note idea, can be rather difficult.<br>  <br>  I would advise that you try to talk to him, and become friends at first. that's your first step. Then show that you have interest in him, if he discards it, step back and stay friends. Go back to the way you were when he did like you, it might revive old feelings. Keep giving him signs that your interested. Keep the signs coming, if he totally discards it then become dire if your love him so much. Leave him messages, talk to his friends, get to know more about him from them.<br>  <br>  To be honest, if he loves you, he would not care about your religion.<br>  <br>  Try being flirty, but not on a sluttish level, look at his eyes etc... Small notifications showing that your there.

el8yX5q3aa	If you are married...you don't.  You rededicate your life and marriage and go to counseling and get that marriage back.  You do not give up.<br>  <br>  If you are dating...you have decided to remain single for a reason.  You have NOT found the one you want to spend your life with.<br>  <br>  Love is forever. It takes on many stages and many faces.  You grow with it.  You might think it is boring and maybe even lost it for a day or two..but something happens to remind you that this is it.<br>  <br>  Love is forever.  If you cannot see your life with this person going on forever...then end it.  You have time to find someone else.   Love is something two of you work at and you communicate the changes and are not afraid of them.  <br>  <br>  You have to remember.....people grow up.  They change...their needs change..their priorities change.  You may not want to be joined at the hip 24/7...or you might want to spend some time with girlfriends once in a while..or you just might need a break from sex for a week or so.  It is ok....that doesn't mean love has left...it just is that you are recharging.  NO relationship can keep an intensity of new found love.  That is animalistic....passionate and new.  But it settles down to deep and abiding love...just as passionate but in different ways.   You are more comfortable..you are more playful....you know you are safe.<br>  <br>  No one can answer this question but you.  Take a long hard look.  Like I said...if you cannot see yourself with this person forever...if your outlooks on life are totally different...if the communication isn't there...if you can't trust .......if you can't believe...then you probably aren't in love.<br>  <br>  This is one reason I tell everyone...don't say I love you so quickly.  There is much to making up one human being...you can't possibly know you love someone in a few months....let alone a couple weeks.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.....remember...no matter what decision you make....you will be where you are supposed to be.  Your life will have gained a lot of knowledge and a lot of experience from this person.  You will know better who you want in your life and why because of this.   This person has been invaluable to you.<br>  <br>  If you do break up....if you decide you aren't in love...and when you do break up...know there will be a period of wondering if you did the right thing.  You are taking off a pair of old shoes...and walking a new path.  It will be a little scary and you will question yourself.  That does not mean you didn't make the right decision.   We call comfort foods and old clothes we wear only at home comfort clothes for  a reason.    They are part of us...we feel good with it.  But as you go forward...you will be just as comfortable with a new direction.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|1179ac1ef69ec53031ff43e46bee7a38aa	I wondered this about my relationship once, and an older and wiser woman asked me, "Would it bother you if you never say him again?"|`|JDRj44xMaa	I TRULY believe that if we stop loving someone, it just means we never really loved them to begin with.. sorta like unconditional love from our family. Do they really stop loving us? Blood is blood. We love people despite their flaws.<br>  <br>  I think once you have to question whether or not you truly love someone, then you know deep down inside, you really don't.<br>  <br>  I know how the whole love-thing goes. You go gaga one day, then the next day, reality hits you (hormones settle down), then you really see them for who they are, and realize, "What the heck was I thinkin??"<br>  <br>  Sometimes, it's better to let go with care & respect. Time's too important, right? Good luck.|`|6OkIzEoQaa	arnt you confused???|`|AA11812653	you either feel it or you don't.|`|lIfO2MGGaa	have sex.|`|F4PkNwpgaa	It's easy to tell when you've stopped loving someone by looking for these signs:<br>  <br>  1.)  You no longer want to do things together. i.e. being around your partner.<br>  2.)  You no longer enjoy any affection and pull away from your partner.<br>  3.)  You find yourself thinking of future plans and don't think of your partner in them.<br>  4.)  You find yourself spending more time at work or with friends.<br>  5.)  You start to pick petty arguments with your partner over nothing.<br>  6.)  Communication breaks down.<br>  <br>  These are just a few, but, are big indicators of when the love stops or that something significant is going on.

HKkbqlIuaa	Well to really help you, it would depend on your definition of "same ol, same ol." However, I find it nice to try different things as well. For me, movies and restaurants are where most dates take place. I like to branch out just a little bit, where it's still a relatively relaxed environment, but still leaves room for conversation. I like to go play pool, putt putt golf, bowling, museums, etc. These are all activities that I enjoy and find are nice to enjoy it with someone else. Some people may find these things dull, but I think it brings variation to traditional dating, but it still allows time for you to get to know the other person. Well, I hope I helped! Good luck with everything. Also, my fiance and I have found that picking a new place to go on a date once every two weeks or so gives the relationship some variation which is always good.
eGpOIV12aa	women LOVE the attention. <br>  <br>  you will learn this.<br>  <br>  men love to brag about money and sex.<br>  <br>  women love to show off that they are "loved"<br>  <br>  she likes you. go for it if you want to take it further

dGBbFwFWaa	i think your a great guy..and i am sure u dont want to break up with your girlfriend for what her mother did.. i think that your girlfriend didnt tell u right away because she knew how much that pendant meant to u and how hurt u were gonna be.. if her mother threw it away dont hold your girlfriend accountable for her mother actions it wouldn't be right.. i understand the value and i understand  u care about them much.. i would be mad as hell if it happened to me.. but i think  it can work out ..  i am sorry for this person who didn't value or appreciate the thought u had when u gave that pendant away.. good luck..|`|pFjgBBUZaa	well first question how old is your gf? because if your gf is living with her mom and she dependent then most likely she won't confront her on a long relationship. and sometimes things that mean a lot to us are just peace of trash to others so you should of never thought that her mom would take care of your sister's pendant like you would. and bro from my personal experience farther/long distance the relationship, more secrets there is :).|`|o716IHkHaa	dude learn from me i was that age and had a gf that had family problems just forget about her and find another chick it may be hard but its well worth it<br>  <br>  sex and all that good stuff with a girl will always come <br>  but real feelings from a girl who really is loyal to you will come once in a lifetime<br>  i learned that the hard way not many girls are loyal these days|`|lvIPNDbgaa	It sounds like she was afraid your feelings would be hurt if you found out. Don't spend too much time around her mother and don't give her mother anything valuable to you.|`|7UDvZfVkaa	if you really love her, you will stick by her side and try to work it out as hard as you possibly can<br>  and think... your girlfriend probably didnt mean to hurt you, in fact i think she tried to spare your feelings. and its her mother you gotta understand that standing up to your mom knowing that your mom is going through a rough time is hard to do<br>  obviously something happened causing her mother to act this way<br>  and if you wanna bail, then think about if you were having problems and how you would feel if your girlfriend bailed on you. i understand you tried but now is the time for communication and confronting|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	Why would her mother throw that away!? <br>  <br>  Anyways, that is really nice of you to do all of those things. Secrets ruin relationships, and are best not to be kept. If you really love her, I wouldnt break up. <br>  If you want, you can confront her mom, but im not sure that would be the best idea if she hates you. You could give it a shot and see what happens. Tell your gf also that you dont like her keeping secrets from you. In relationships, people are supposed to support each other, be honest and share everything. (well, not literally, but you know what i mean). I would just talk everything out. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck:)|`|ipRPrvzxaa	She didn't tell you b/c she didn't have the heart to.  <br>  And the mother's probably going through a mid-life crisis.  Try to work it out, but never give something that important to anyone unless you are engaged/married.
jAwjlyJWaa	Maybe you could just start out saying that you do not agree with her cheating behavior. Then say how it isn't funny to hurt peoples feelings like that for no reason, and its no joking matter. If she wants to have a boyfriend then she should just stick to one at a time. When you are talking to her about it though try to make reference to what she would do if someone was cheating at her, and maybe that will help you in making your point. :)|`|NCe7nI2Iaa	she enjoys the power she feel when she does it

If so, I'd say go for it. worst that can happen is she says no...... and thats not really so bad. and if she says yeah, then good to hear it.......|`|3QSiLT2baa	Sounds like she liiiiikes you a bit. ^________^ <br>  <br>  <br>  Don't get your hopes up too high.

b2G7zM3Xaa	i honestly think if he does ask you to prom that you should yes although a part of you would not want to . And also be totally honest with him .Lay down exactly how you feel and see were you go from there.<br>  Good Luck!|`|YWjhqlxbaa	Stop playing games. If you want to go with him to prom then ask him or if he asks you then say yes.

If she's always staring at you, she probably likes you too and would be so excited if you asked her out!<br>  I think you could just catch her alone after school and ask if she wants to see a movie or even go to the park. You don't need to be really over the top, just casual - then if she says no, smile and say it's fine. If she says yes, then you've got your date!<br>  On the date just be yourself... act like you're really interested in what she wants to do and show that you just want to get to know her.|`|HUUZgDppaa	exactly what these people are telling you just do it man be yourself and just ask her to lunch or something act now or she will get taken|`|WiTdZAZsaa	be a man and ask her|`|JJLjo2QRaa	aww thats sweet! make sure you really like her, it sounds like you do. and all you have to do is tell her how you feel. sure it'll be scary but telling the truth is way better than keeping it inside. and girls like shy guys, it shows your sensitive. odds are she likes you back, and you'll be glad you took that risk for her :)|`|Dl9a08Rxaa	just ask her out she probably likes youif she stares at you and even if she says no at least you will know and at least you gave it a shot<br>  <br>  just go up to her like in the hall os something like after school or before or during a break and when she is alone not with her friends just make it sound casual like "hey sometime do you want to hang out?

AA11243438	LOVE BEGETS LOVE.  HE MAY BE UNDER SOME STRESS FOR THE TIME BEING.  IT MAY ALSO BE FINANCIAL STRESS/OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE CAUSING SUCH A SITUATION.  ASK HIM FRANKLY WHAT TROUBLES HIM ?

DON''T GET DISHEARTED.|`|0SQou2X9aa	i agree with lolly.ur lucky that u are in country that can offer support and protection.my advice to u is seek help fast and that type of man changes only 4 the worst.i know that type,my close friend went through the same and now shes in a mental hospital.that man never touched her but he destroyed her inner being to ashes.i wouldnt want anything close 2 that to happen to u.act fast,plz.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	This is something that unfortunately happens often. But this also means that the country recognizes the safety issues faced by women who get married and become citizens. Therefore there are laws to protect people like you, so that you don't have to stay in an unsafe relationship for the sake of maintaining citizenship. Contact a local support centre where you can get legal advice and the help of a social worker, they will be able to help you with the process of leaving the relationship. there is help for you out there, you just have to seek it.|`|iD4ejChZaa	This is why i always say that men who marry women from poorer countries do it to make themselves feel superior. they think they're 'heroes'.  Go out and buy yourself some thing very nice like real jewlery, [not costume jewlery] etc. that will make him think twice next time.|`|6OkIzEoQaa	this is a very sensitive issue so kindly get a professional help asap!!|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	He seems to be a materialistic man with no values, no culture, no respect for love and friendship<br>  Yes he did help u and u have to have some gratitude, but u have paid the gratitude by marriage, and now r equal, no one owes anyone anything. <br>  He has not understood the meaning of marriage, the sacred vows of marriage etc.<br>  However, if u still love him, u must be persistent but gentle, and try to show him light (love), the poor boy has lost way in darkness (materialistic world).<br>  Love is not for sale, love is not given as gratitude, one must earn love, one must win love, there is no rich or poor in front of love<br>  Heart of hearts, we r all children of evil, we don't understand love, materialism has the upper hand.<br>  Anyway, as u r the victim, gently try to persuade him to acknowledge your love for him, try hard because u love him<br>  if u fail, u may have to take harsher measures to make him see sense.
6DGLxJ1daa	You have made an accomplishment - you have realized your boyfriend has undesirable flaws.  <br>  <br>  Do you want to stay with someone who is stubborn and kinda spoiled?  That's your prerogative.  <br>  <br>  I personally would break up with him.  It seems that you'd want to be with someone who would be a little more easygoing.<br>  <br>  You aren't going to be able to change him.  He can only change himself.  And since he is stubborn, I'm guessing he's not going to WANT to change himself.<br>  <br>  So if you don't like this behavior, find someone else whose behavior you like.  Don't compromise your time, your emotions, your happiness, your life, your Self, for someone you're not compatible with.  Yes, you two have a history of four years... but make it history.  You've lived and you've learned the type of person you want to be with.  I'd say find someone worth your time and effort!<br>  <br>  Best of luck - stay strong and stay true to yourself!  You don't owe anyone anything.  You owe yourself happiness.|`|vg9C2TqQaa	you need to straighten him out! he cant expect everything to go his way all the time. and you need to be careful. if one day he gets really mad, he may take it out on you. handle this situations delicately, and start by having a conversation with him. make him aware that this is a serious problem that is negatively affecting your relationship. if he doesnt toughen up, it may be an oppurtunity to leave the relationship and get into a healthier one.|`|pFjgBBUZaa	well first of im shocked that you been with person like that for that long. well you have two suggestions either be a baby's mommy and do things his way. or get him some help like you said gym might help. leaving him is not even a suggestion because if you didn't' leave him for past 4 years im sure you won't leave him now :).|`|U286XG21aa	I been there done that.. After a while it will only get worse.. So I would tell him that you need sometime a part.. And be nice about it..

The reason I say this is because if youy stick with him, your life is going to be spent just trying to make HIM happy and completely forget about yourself. So, think of yourself first, and find someone who will at least TRY to meet you halfway. Hope this helps and get you thinking.|`|lIfO2MGGaa	You have to realize, your relationship isn't all about him! It takes two people to be in a relationship -- and it can't always be his way. When he gets mad, let him be mad. And if he "Leaves" you over it, that's how you know weather he was the "one" or not for you.|`|eKbYRAlEaa	Its time to end this relationship!! You are not Dr. Phil. It is not your job to fix him.

Be careful.|`|ClaJhsYVaa	i say that you should confront him about it and if that doesnt help, the best thing to do is dump him sorrry...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Please help me: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219221810AAOuG1w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|Jwb5TWVPaa	he is not interested in you anymore. so just dump him before he dump you.|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	he needs to get a life - a hobby and YES SOME GYM TIME|`|M7r7gHNGaa	Be wary of him.

He's probably stressed out about something else and feels the need to take it out on you. Sit him down and ask him whats up adn whats been bringing these strange feelings up.

V1wDqlvnaa	If he believed other people over you, it sounds like he wasn't trying as hard to save the relationship. A year is a long time and it's going to be hard to move on but you must continue to live your life. You asked if it was possible for him to come back to you...well it is! There's a chance he will realize what an asshole he was and what a great person you are but you can't hold your breath. Because in the meantime you will loose out on other opportunities. I'm being honest and by the things you write, it sounds like he wasn't interested in continuing a relationship with you. best of luck you will find someone better trust!|`|U286XG21aa	Yea it been there done that.. My husband did that to me once where he broke uo with me and then a couple months later he called me and told me how much he missed and what not...

And keep you head up...|`|Zue2XXQOaa	I'm 18 years old going on 20 so I'm sorry if I'm a little young to be answering this question, but I'd like to give you some advice. I was in a relationship for three years and we finally decided to break-up. It was mutual, but still painful. As time went on, we stopped talking for 8 months straight and didn't see each other. Then one day out of the blue she called me and said she wanted to meet up somewhere for just a casual lunch. It was difficult to just see her as "casual" and we eventually decided to stop talking. If it's any consolation, do what you think is right for you. If this is too awkward, then you can tell him you don't want to be apart of it. However, if you decide to try and work things out, keep a shield up. Getting too attached again can lead to more unnecessary pain. <br>  <br>  I hope that was help. Again, sorry if I'm not the right age, but I really hope things work out for you<br>  <br>  - aidan delgato (:|`|5qAUsXzfaa	I've been there and done that hun, but don't sit around waiting because there's the times that he won't come back.  I know it's hard, but I had someone from my past believe for almost a week that I had messed around with someone else.   I never touched anyone, but him...the girl that told him stuff wanted him for herself because he had a good job and a hot car.  He came back to me after almost 2 weeks of being an ***...At this point, all I can tell you is to take care of yourself.  Have girls night out...go shopping...lol...whatever it takes.  I'm 24, almost 25 and now married.  Things will work out for the better.|`|oBSdFPU1aa	I don't have the ending to my answer, but I'm in the same situation right now.  Except that my "boyfriend" called himself my best friend all along.  Then he blurted out that he loved me, but was finally moving on about two months ago.  He wants to remain best friends and he's taking time to himself before he sees me again.  I don't know whether he'll be coming back to me as a friend or as a boyfriend yet, but I do know that you aren't alone in this situation.
1Ayb4UK7aa	3 by the time I was 20.  That number has gone up significantly since then.  Don't worry about what is average.  Each person is different and you shouldn't be judged by how many girls you have or haven't slept with.  Do what you feel is right.|`|92iuiuZKaa	I am a 20 year old female. I've only had sex with 4 guys!|`|H9Bzw0VNaa	Yea thats average I think.. My ex was 20 n had already slept with 10... I though that was too many!  He was a man-ho though lol Ur fine, its not like its a competition|`|FyqCMrCdaa	Its not the quantity its the quality. :P Promiscuous people now a days. gheez! lol|`|PXfUyd5aaa	0.00.|`|decWPAHkaa	None, I sleep with men.|`|vg9C2TqQaa	it shouldnt be about competition. it should be about the right person and the right time. this isnt a "lets see how many girls i can sleep with before im 20" kind of game. you guys are so ridiculous.|`|zCakedeXaa	it varies.  some guys sleep with many some with none.  i have only slept with one 1 girl and i really care for her.  i have 4 months till i turn 20 and i don't that record will be broken in time.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Look go at your own pace ok, don't rush it.

And by the way i think you should only sleep with someone if you truly love them and want to spend the rest of your life with them.|`|6DGLxJ1daa	Mmm. I'd like to meet more men like Kyle S.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'd say four is about average to high-average for a 20 year old who is respectful to women.  Only sleep with girls you care about, and don't compete with guys when it comes to sex partners.  Sex isn't a game to girls, so don't make it one.|`|AT4erlHzaa	thats really low for a guy i mean its a good thing i wouldnt be ashamed of  it at least your not hoeing around...  iono numbers dont matter so i wouldnt stress it|`|33df754d326544fd662a2d38ab0435f9aa	1|`|V1wDqlvnaa	four is plenty. don't listen to these assholes. you don't want to become some man-whore and catch a disease!|`|e93273dbb5e6ab0fee546d7128bd0f80aa	there is no competition dummie. dont get STD
QgxCbEk5aa	Wow! do you know how lucky you are to have such a wonderful gentleman in your life, who does all the stuff women wishes their significant other would do? So what if you guys don't have a romantic time together, if you like him alot try smiling, rubbing his arms while speaking or something flirtatious and watch for his gestures, most likely if he encourages the behavior by smiling or not removing himself from you then you know he likes you, but if he does, get out of his life! and if you don't like him too, you should get out of his life before you break his heart :(|`|M4X3HOV5aa	no man just wants to be friends with a woman. he either likes you or wants to have sex with you, otherwise he wouldn't be spending time with you.|`|ymqRux3xaa	Do you have a "low amount of sexual activity" with all of your friends? That right there says it all.
4DbpJPXKaa	it sounds like he is a bit confused and is not sure if having sex with you was the right thing....give it a bit of time and if he doesnt talk you should ask him|`|C7C3vVeYaa	He probably asked to get deployed early and tried to get away from you.|`|C6to7ExVaa	Some guys are clueless, and only use girls for like. "Toys" If you know what I mean. You should call him and confront him about it, because it'll get worse if you don't talk about it anytime soon..<br>  <br>   Or you can call Movin'!, and set up a love trap with baltazar and maria. (: <br>  <br>   Hope this helps.
rTaaIXSuaa	Why do you have to lie?<br>  Tell her exactly what you said in your answer.<br>  You are not going because you want to stay home with your family and spend time with them. <br>  As a friend, she should respect that.|`|84db822e80c8ab6223d50689fd25b00aaa	I suggest going for a bit, or just "dropping by."<br>  I understand that social situations can sometimes be awkward or frightening, but since it's her birthday I think you should stick it out for a while and show that even though these kinds of situations aren't your favourite, you're still willing to go for her.<br>  Go for a while, say happy birthday, say hello to her guests, give her a present, get a drink or a snack, talk to her a bit, and then leave if you're uncomfortable. You never know, you may end up getting along with some new people.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	If you don't want to go, don't lie about it.  Tell her happy birthday, but you want to be at home with your family.  I always found that telling  people the truth has the best results.  She'll get over it and you'll feel better for not lying.|`|ixmaM395aa	You should still go. I'm shy and hate it when my friends bring out a million people I don't know but I always end up having such a great time. It's fun to meet new people and you just might surprise yourself with how much fun you'll have. <br>  <br>  She's probably so excited that you're going so don't let her down. Even if you're only there for an hour it shows you care.|`|U8VGvgC1aa	No you should go. At least see what the new friends are like. If you still feel uncomfortable after a cpl hours then tell her you don't feel well, but you should definitely make an appearance.|`|rjtVWCPEaa	lie but dont get caught|`|4c6c3682e6d0aeba072315485c919287aa	Its not about you. Birthdays are a big deal to some people. You should make an appearacnce but have a good, resonably true excuse to leave early.|`|SEjrzaVJaa	I know exactly what you are talking about! I have the very same problem when i was younger, always worrying about going to parties or outings where there are many strange faces or unfamiliar and i would be worrying what to say or do. It just got so tiring cos I will be worrying about how to turn down such events or coming up with excuses to not go.Eventually it comes to a stage when you find the best way is just to agree to go and not turn up at the last minute.  <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do for yourself is just go for the party. Just dun think about it and the people who will be there. Just go... Trust me. You will find its not too bad. Its the worrying that makes you uncomfortable and it manifest in your bearing and behaviour and that is what actually makes you not enjoy anything.|`|TxBXVL6caa	just make an appearance|`|bcfd7b5ccba4d54bc635158d1fdd6dc9aa	You are not selfish, you are entitled to not want to go! There is nothing wrong with that, but you need to get a backbone and tell the truth. Are you really that scared of what her reaction may be? So she may get upset, so what...she'll get over it...and if she doesn't I would never be friends with her ever again. My friends understand everytime I cancel with them and they say, "Awww, we'll miss you, but have fun! :)" They've been my good close friends for over 20 years. Never have they disrespected me or put me down in any way ever. Stand up for yourself and others will respect and treat you well. Good Luck!
VjgIeIMgaa	ok i'll try my best with this one. in life there will always be one love in u'r life. u'll always feel the pain when u think about her. love is difficult to explain. but just remember this if u keep thinking about her u'l just keep feeling more and more pain. if u can start to move on, u can still be good friends but u have to find someone else that u can feel strongly about. u are hanging on too much to u'r previous feelings and they are getting in the way of making u feel the same feelings with the person that may in the end be that special someone.|`|MJyM1XWJaa	I think you're just afraid to let go of the first one. She played a significant role in your life but please understand this: that role is done now. You are possibly missing something completely wonderful and happy that is right there in front of you and waiting!<br>  <br>  Don't make comparisons of the girls, it's not fair to them. How would you like it if you were compared to another guy? It won't be the same because maybe this is something that will be a real love. People have a lot of really bogus concepts of love and true loves and crap from disney movies. Love is a really deep feeling and needs work. Whether you believe in the bible and God or not, the best definition of love I have ever seen is in 1 Corinthians 13. or go to www.geocities.com/cat_and_mels_list on the front page it's on there too. That's the kind of love we should all strive for.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|iABAZj2Haa	the first one was probably your first love<br>  and those are really really hard to forget.<br>  most people dont forget those and well all you can do is move one.|`|ICjBorriaa	Well obviously you are going feel slightly different with someone else.

I do think your a little worried about getting hurt again and yes it does take time to heal so give it time. There is no reason you need to make a decision right now. So just relax, you being comfortable with her is a great thing!

But just be honest.|`|3zr9dHffaa	Well you care for her, you really like her and she feels the same way. Love is different with different people, the emotions you feel are natural and there's nothing wrong with that.<br>  <br>  If you aren't sure if she's right for you then just ask you self these questions.<br>  <br>  Does she really love you back?<br>  <br>  Do you feel happy around her?<br>  <br>  Does she treat you well? make you laugh or act lovingly around you?<br>  <br>  Do you have strong emotions for her?<br>  <br>  If you answered yes to all of them then she is the right girl for you.

Its okay.|`|To85W1Rgaa	i don't know the right thing to do here. the best i can say is that each girl is different, and your feelings will be different for each. if you really are the best of pals, then go ahead and be with her. couples SHOULD be best friends with their significant other. i don't know what is right, but that seems like your best bet.<br>  hope you can work it out!|`|Wwb1Ywf0aa	Love is absolutely different with different people.

If anything you have probably already slightly hurt this girl because u two are so close and practically dating and yet you still havn't officially asked her to be your gf. Shes probably just as confused as you are. Please make the move and take the risk, sounds like your going to have a good result. <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|tcFg1gWjaa	doubt is doubt. even if it is for 2 seconds, it shouldn't be there. It sounds like you were really in love with the first girl, enough so that it motivated positive changes in your life. That's what love does! Dont settle for something you know isnt the same. You had the chance to know what it feels like, always look for that feeling. If its not with her, every aspect, its not love. You may go the next 10 years without ever finding that feeling again, be patient. The good news is you know what to feel for, a lot of people never get to experience it. Believe in your instincts.
QAGaQUDRaa	If she already knows you like her and she's saying she's "too old" for you, then it's possible that she just isn't interested, because the age difference isn't that much. I'm your age, my s/o is 24, and we get along perfectly, so I think that is just an excuse she's making. Although, I will say that he and I both thought the age difference was too much to start with, but if you click (and you're both adults) age isn't that important. <br>  <br>  If you want the chase, go for it, but if I were you I wouldn't worry about it too much. Be cool, let her see who you are, and if she starts to like you, awesome. If not, keep on fishing, there's plenty more to catch.

XmJZkFuMaa	I would contact the United States Embassy first, or your local Veterans group.  They would be able to at least give you an idea of what steps should be taken.  <br>  <br>  My dad was in the Korean War.  He wants to be buried in an army cemetery, because that's where a lot of his friends from the war are as well.  So if you can't get the remains to Korea, perhaps you can find a way to honor him in an appropriate area of the cemetery where Korean veterans are, or even go to the Korean War Memorial and see if they will allow you to scatter his remains there, since we fought so hard to have it put up.|`|uxwSd0KLaa	I lost my mother and father a long time ago ; so I know what you are going trough ; and about your father ashes ; put them in his paternal cemetery .

It's about you and how you feel.<br>  <br>  You know your dad best. I would look into yourself and as you already know you think he would like it if he was released in Korea.<br>  <br>  Why not bite the bullet and you and your father go to Korea find a nice quiet stream and release him there. Saying goodbye.<br>  <br>  I did that with my mother and sister. But only you know know what to do.<br>  <br>  It's not illigal to do it so do it.|`|lXpGlAm3aa	I don't have the answer to this.But I would say Thank You to your Dad serving our country.And by the looks of your picture as your screen name,Thank You as well!<br>  <br>  Anyhow,good luck on continuing your father's wishes.=)
Do7UBU7Kaa	if you don't want to confront her about it you could make little excuses like "i haven't gone food shopping in so long, there's nothing to eat" or you could try planning lunch or dinner together so if she comes over during the day you could just say your going to be eating soon anyway.|`|jxizzHL1aa	tell her fat *** to get some manners and learn some self control.  Then go back hand her across the mouth before she gets a chance to retaliate.|`|c4fNS7Iuaa	Just try to talk to her about it. Don't be rude about it though. You don't wanna lose a friend because she thinks you "called her fat".
M7r7gHNGaa	Unless either you or your friend already have a relationship with the girl there is no reason why you shouldn't ask her out. Besides, you said that you t h i n k your friend is going to as her out. The only time it would be wrong to jump ahead of him is if you were going to ask her to spite your friend.<br>  <br>  Ask her and have fun.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	yeah it is|`|1neMZoRLaa	just tell your friend neither of you should ask her out if it's going to cause problems|`|q4m4kEtRaa	Try this dating site -- ______ MixedFriends.

uxwSd0KLaa	Yes it is ; and its not everybody who would ask you a contract . Just choose a safe place|`|ba4R1tf1aa	What the first person said is right, you must be 18 to sign anything legally binding, however if a person is on a month-to-month agreement requiring 30 days notice, they may not be required to sign a lease at all.<br>  Stay where you are and try to work things out, or go stay with relatives or friends of the family for now.|`|swAONFfEaa	you can't be legally held to a contract until you're eighteen
AA10065812	*** Yes, but she can get a reduction.  If she's applying for SSD, as soon as she received the award, he needs to file for the children's benefits.  They will be retroactive, in case she has arrears.  In all likelihood, a judge will reduce her payment to what the SSD children's benefit is, which isn't much, and is divided among all children.  If she has more children, your payment gets reduced.  You will also need to turn in a yearly report on how the money was spent.<br>  <br>  Check the SS web site for the forms on filing for the children's benefits.|`|AA11124905	It is really hard to say because laws vary from state to state. You may want to visit your local library and checkout a book on the garnishment laws of your state. It may also be a good idea to call an attorneys office. They should be able to answer your question free of charge. Hoped this helped. Peace and God bless.|`|tcFg1gWjaa	regular disability yes, SSI no|`|0N0ExMMAaa	yes they will
ajgC0KPhaa	Yes, you freaked him out, especially with that accusation at the beginning. You didn't point out that he actually did anything to make you assume that he was using you.<br>  <br>  Anyways, if neither of you want a relationship right now, then neither of you are doing anything wrong.

He probably just wanted to have a chill chick to make out with and be cool with. He may not want to be anymore serious than that, and by you asking the question you did, he is probably worried that your taking this more serious than he does. I think that you should move on. You're young and i'm sure you're cute. There are other guys out there, not everyone one is the one!

uJ9waJDYaa	Im around her age, I think think the age difference doesn't matter if you are both interested and things work out etc.<br>  I think you should avoid it though because she is your employee and that could makes things difficult for you both. Although first thing you should do is find out if she is interested as well, if she isn't then you can be sure both your jobs will be safe, if you find out she is interested then maybe date once or twice and talk about what you both think you should do.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and don't feel bad if she just isn't interested.|`|AA11108018	Ok I give up what are you going to open the door, open the oven and stick your head in what in heck are you going to open.

9KklyOcbaa	I don't think it's ok to hate your best friend. You shouldn't be best friends with someone who you're not jealous of, because then you will feel like you are superior to them and that's no good. You shouldn't lose your best friend because you are jealous of her either, though. You sound like you don't have that much self-confidence. You just have to find some things you like about yourself. Confidence comes from the inside out - although you may think they do, your friends really have nothing to do with how you're feel about yourself in the end. Just be a good person, and if you feel like your friend steals all the attention, you should be more outgoing. Talk to guys more instead of being shy. Don't blame her, because then you will resent her. You obviously friends with her for a reason (probably because you like her as a person ;)), so keep things in perspective. I definitely think you would miss her. Good luck.

I personally think, in general, that's a little too much, and that if you really want to do it, you should do it in person, and not in public. Unless you're going for that secret crush thing. But, I think it's too soon. I think it's a bf/gf thing, and it might make her feel uncomfortable if she knows it could be from you and she pictures you as just a friend, or something like that. but that's a pretty risky thing to do... depends on how fragile your heart is, and how you would take rejection too.|`|gmBzMFDLaa	wow.<br>  if a guy did that to me id kiss him on the cheek!<br>  this is such a kind thing to do.<br>  it will make her feel special and beautiful.<br>  make sure you give her a yellow rose though (red is too lovey-dovey, yellow is more respectful)<br>  <br>  this is so sweet!<br>  i wish more guys were like you!|`|48Iacfvfaa	mmmm... take it slow buddy ... u dont wanna freak her out  start by getting to really know her and then ask her out while on the date tell her she's beautiful and maybe give her a rose, but don't pour all yer feelings out... take it slow but show her yer really into her ... :)<br>  <br>  good luck|`|e2O0T0UKaa	Why not? Maybe you could chat to her a little bit more, and ask her to hang out with you and a group of friends somewhere (to get to know her), and then present her with a rose =)|`|0jKaDzUfaa	aww thats beautiful :D<br>  just try not to do it infront of many people cos if you embarrass her it may not go so smoothly but thats so cute :)|`|psB5SKjbaa	I think you should get to know her first...<br>  if you give her a flower and she doesn't even know you that well...<br>  she'd probably be creeped....<br>  <br>  =)|`|8H97U1qDaa	Awww..datss gewdd:)

So, usually the initial response will be somewhat negative until you explain your reasons for choosing not to have sex.|`|xZYWOZMEaa	I think its a good thing. Girls don't like players.. save it for someone you love :)|`|jD0nfrIBaa	Impressive<br>  <br>  Go you!|`|ABWQgoDtaa	amazing, wish guys were more like you.|`|rVsnBLfdaa	I think it is great and something to be proud of .   I admire that you have not reduced your values because of peer pressure, too many young people do.   Good on you!!!!
bAnyRNZUaa	No but you got to time it right...like when she is doing squats you slink up behind her and whisper in her ear "You need a spot?"|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	no, i wouldnt mind it. if thats the only place you can ask her out, then go for it. place doesnt really matter.<br>  <br>  Do you mean gym, as in school gym, or the other one in which you have to pay to go to? hah im so dumb right now, its 2 am and im still on this damn site.
UNhYZMoWaa	You are artistic  and it's great to see a guy whom can pour out his creative side.   <br>  <br>  Have you read the Diary of Adrian Mole?   If not please do you might have a connection :)|`|xhVe918waa	Well if you are chivalrous and romantic, I think you would be perfect. I think all of that you mentioned is attractive!|`|AA11108018	like your poem very good in fact.  If you have a great singing voice pursue the career in sing.   Always remember where you got started|`|OCTvfDsxaa	I know a 16yr. old that would find you perfect for her. She is a lot like you. She enjoys all types of music(and she sings),she writes all the time, she don't play sports,and she is very bright. While I'm just out your "realm" of age group you still sound attractive to me.  I'm sure others would find you the same way.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Every person is different. I am sure there are some people that find it attractive. However, you should expect people to find YOU attractive not your accomplishments. Although they are commendable, they should not define who you are. Well, I hope I didn't come off as rude, but that's how I see it. Good luck.|`|MJyM1XWJaa	Yes some women or girls will find that attractive. Everyone is interested in different things and different people! And being creative and talented in the arts is still admired by many women today. Otherwise they wouldn't lust after celebrities lol.|`|psB5SKjbaa	I'd still find this kinds of men attractive...<br>  i don't get how so many girls can like guys too jockkkk_like_ish...<br>  I think that's really nice...<br>  <br>  =)|`|EkTaBfdcaa	yes,<br>  as long as you dont act in love with yourself.<br>  :]|`|6DGLxJ1daa	Yes, it is.  Make sure you stay in shape.  There are too many talented male vocalists that are not in shape or masculine enough.  And male theater vocal talent is often not seen in a masculine light anymore, unfortunately, but in more of a homosexual light.  So stay in shape and stay masculine too.<br>  <br>  There are always girls interested in artsy guys, guys willing to express their emotions. It may take a while for them to come around because some of them are shy.  But you'll meet girls, especially if you decide to use your talents for fronting a sweet band.  There are never enough good male vocalists with original lyrics!<br>  <br>  Don't give up your passions to try to fit in.  Keep pursuing your passions and you'll meet like-minded people who want to know you for the right reasons and who will value your talents.

ZjM0ghSnaa	It can take a while to get over a girl. For others, they bounce back fast and by the next week, they have another girl/guy. <br>  <br>  Think about the positives and negatives of your split. <br>  As of now, your free to look around, right? <br>  And...you two are still friends. not many people remain friends after relationships. <br>  <br>  I dont think you've done anything wrong. She just had a change of thought maybe, and needed a break. Dont get upset, there are plenty of great girls out there. Who knows, you two can get back together one day. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck:)|`|tHFY2hg4aa	I went through the same thing with my first girlfriend, and let me tell you something ... I still find myself thinking about her even though it has been 10 years since we dated.<br>  The story there was that she also decided that she wanted to be just friends after we dated for a year. She and I were not doing bad as a couple, but she had moved out of town and we didn't see each other that often. I was kind of prepared for it because she had been acting kinda weird since she moved away. I learned one thing about young and wild women (not saying yours is wild). They can be fickled sometimes when knowing what they want, and they tend to back away from a guy when they are not sure instead of giving it more time.<br>  I found out a couple of months later that she had already started dating someone else and was pregnant. That pretty much sealed the deal on us not going out anymore and I haven't seen her since. <br>  It's all good though. You may not forget her, but there is better out there. Then again, it may all work out for the two of you in the end. Life is funny like that.|`|SvFzMMDVaa	Bro, I know exactly how you feel. I just got out of a relationship where I really liked my guy and we broke up out of nowhere because he was moving.<br>  <br>  I can tell you this. It's overrated, but it'll take some time. Talk to her. Ask her to hang out sometime even though it might be a little weird. Text her sometimes just to ask how she's doing. Being friends is pretty much all you can really do . I just talked to my ex and we talked everything out. And that helped somewhat. Listen to really good music that reflects how you feel or write.|`|jRLsyoX7aa	i understand where your coming from 1000%. i went out with this guy for two years, he was my first well... everything. when we broke up i was absolutley crushed, i couldnt stop thinking about him, always seen him but he treated me like he never knew me, and every thing rminded me of him. it tookme a couple months just to get it back together. But thats because i surrounded my self with friends, went out and kept busy so i wouldnt think about him as much. And i happen to meet someone new and once i met him i rarely ever thought about my ex. Hopefully you understand that the best thing for yourself  is to move on, becuase life is too short to dwell on  this girl.
uYkqXWN4aa	He's missing you and isn't over you..

Most of all, just have a good time.|`|C7C3vVeYaa	Bring a pack of condoms and yell to the drunk bitches "OI LOOK WHAT I HAVE!"|`|bxji3S56aa	bring a condom|`|AA12022610	winking, looking|`|bAnyRNZUaa	This approach always worked for me:  telling jokes and look like you are having fun.

It's a talking sausage!' "<br>  When she is done cracking up, you go "would you like to go smooch somewhere?" Works like a charm...|`|M7r7gHNGaa	Don't get drunk and don't get arrested if the party gets busted.|`|237ab7a90e5b9d51488ea4a1c42d65dcaa	Look for the ones that can't even walk straight.|`|WfUMOPyhaa	Beer goggles

pcI25NXzaa	Well, there's nothing wrong with being bisexual. Second depending on your age, you might want to wait til your 18. While youre younger you go through a lot of emotional changes and stuff, just the general experience of life with your parents might change your mind about feeling incomplete without them. It's fine to wanna meet your birthmother, but just remember, they didn't have to adopt you, and what i mean by that is they loved the idea of having a child enough to choose you, ya know? Like it's not like they just got stuck with you or something. Eventually you might find that you were meant to be with them all along...|`|YWcFDQ7zaa	You should defiently talk to your adopted family about this. I can't believe they would get mad at you for asking. It's natural to be curious. And believe me if you hold in your feelings it will do much more harm then good. If you still dont want to talk to them about it, talk to a teacher or a conselour. Good luck! God Bless|`|lXpGlAm3aa	Well,can you talk to a school counselor?<br>  What about talking with your adoptive parents?They have to know you must have some feelings.I was adopted,too.Fortunatly I was able to find my birth mom and my birth dad is no longer alive.But my adoptive parents didn't get hurt or mad.I guess they also were foster parents,so they understand.<br>  I think you need to talk with them.Maybe with a school counselor or someone professional.That way the conversation can be non-confrontational and heard.So basically everyone gets to have a say,and feelings etc can be discussed.<br>  Also,do you know much about your birth parents?Are you sure they may want to hear from you?Just a heads up on that.Some birth parents don't want to be found.I'm only being honest with you.Like my adoptive mom told me,"It's no fairytale about your parents,they had alot of problems." I guess for me,personally I used to think it was this fantasy or fairytale.But keep that in mind.Or maybe they do think about you.<br>  <br>  But all in all,the curiosity is going to be there.And no one can tell you other or change your mind.You will search and look for answers.Because that's how I was,too.=)No one could tell me other,until I found out for myself.That's part of my nature,though.=)<br>  <br>  Well,I know you don't feel complete.And you may not see this now,because you are soo young.But maybe realize your life could've been worse.Try and realize things happen for reasons.You may not see this now,but maybe in another 10 years or so.<br>  <br>  Okay,good luck!

If she says she still likes him back off its not worth ruining a friendhsip. It's not bad that you like him, you can't control how you feel.  Just talk it through with your friend and see where it goes from there.<br>  <br>  btw, if this guys amish why does he have a phone?? =o
Osmyhvc7aa	tell him your a lesbian and you only like girls.|`|OD24TSrgaa	Talk to him about guys you think are cute, it'll get on his nerves.

I wasn't to sure if he liked me or if he was lonely. What I did was, I ignored him completely (lol), I ignored his calls (he left me a voicemail to see what kinds of grades I got!!) and when he did call, I sometimes let my friend answer the phone and she spoke to him in a different language. Yes thats a mean BUT, eventually, he'll get the hint to leave you alone. Or, you can just tell him straight up, Boy I do not like you!|`|vTra7n5baa	Well, just show him this question you posted online and he'll think you're as dumb as everyone else does already.  Problem solved.  He'll be out of your hair in no time.<br>  <br>  Duh??? Just stop thinking about him or this issue and focus on getting an A+ on your next test or something else important.

Then write out what their opposites are.  Chances are, those are the things you DO want in life!<br>  Ex. "I don't want to be bored all the time" ---> "I want an exciting action packed life!" then think of things that go with that (cool hobbies, trying new foods, learning new things, etc)<br>  <br>  2) I want you to check out a book called "PsychoCybernetics" by Maxwell Maltz (sp?).  It talks about transforming your self image.  Read it and DO THE EXERCISES.  I think they could be of help.  This is too much to get into on here, but keep me posted.|`|35EDYBKQaa	Well I don't think I can help you because I think that I am becoming depressed.<br>  <br>  This is why. Please help me.<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Avxw0qbflEw9PkAUHO68w1fD7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090219224010AAHCO34">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|WpQJeAQfaa	i feel the same... u just gota find ur passion i suppose|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	First off, I really think that you should talk to a doctor about your feelings.  I experienced the same thing - ups and downs, peaks of interest - then discouragement... and I started taking an inexpensive, low-dose antidepressant.  It has been so amazing for me.  I think it would help you, too.<br>  <br>  When I need to cope with negative feelings, I go get my "happy thoughts".  <br>  <br>  It's a little book in which I put things that make me smile: pictures of my friends laughing, pictures where I think I look hot (view: my profile picture, LOL), comic strips that make me laugh, jokes, etc.<br>  <br>  In the secret, it often mentions people who found pictures of "their dream home", or their "dream car" or even the breed of dog they would someday like to own... and they would store these pictures, so that they could use them for creative visualization.<br>  <br>  Maybe that will help.|`|UYfeRLxwaa	Well, its ultimately up to you. If you are actually tired of feeling sad and down, then do something about it. You have the ability to do that, mentally, we are capable of so much - we just choose not to put it into effect. Sure, it is difficult and strenuous, but no one said attaining happiness was easy. Stop worrying about the unnecessary and don't be afraid to do what you want to do. We live approx. 80 years (if we are lucky) don't waste time by feeling down.|`|iAs67p17aa	No one can give you a really good answer unless it's your doctor.|`|6DGLxJ1daa	I have depression and that's what I go through.  Therapy and/or medication helps me, and it should help you to build your self-efficacy.  Don't feel bad about being depressed, it's a sickness, and clearly you know you're sick.  I have troubles coping with negative feelings, and therapy has helped me in the past with giving me the tools to deal with this difficult problem. [I need to go back to therapy when I get money or find a good free clinic.]  <br>  Also, try to actively expose yourself to new things and see if anything interests you.  Push yourself to get out there, meet new people, try new exciting things.  I know it seems unbearable some days to even get out of bed, let alone push yourself to meet new people... but life is worth living, and living well.  Send a few emails to friends and family members who you may have gotten out of touch with to try to re-establish the connection (or maintain it).  The best way I've been coping with my negative feelings lately is to get back in touch with people I've lost touch with - just to realize that there are people who love me.  Keeping busy helps too.  The combination of keeping busy by being with loved ones is a blues-buster in my book.  A little phone call goes longer than you'd think.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you - stay strong.|`|EAwgYjYGaa	I went through a very bad depression at one point in my life.  I cried and worried and cried and worried about my life and one day I figured it out.  I realized that my depression was caused by me over focusing on myself.   I stopped focusing so much on myself and started focusing on helping other people.  It can be as simple as asking every person you interact with "How's your day been?", or buying a cup of coffee for the person behind you in line.  The smiles you get from other people makes you feel good about yourself and gives you a sense of purpose knowing you're making others around you lives better.  Stay busy, the more time you sit around by yourself the more time you have to over think your life.<br>  <br>  As far as inspiring yourself, you probably just need to follow through on a few goals to find answers.  Think of something you're interested in that is measurable and set a goal for yourself.  Promise yourself no matter how tired or frustrated you get you will follow through and make it happen.<br>  <br>  OK so here's the good news being depressed was the best thing that ever happened to me!  Sounds crazy but I learned so much about myself overcoming depression, to this day whenever I have a bad day I think about everything I've overcome to get where I am today, and smile because I did it!<br>  <br>  Believe in yourself.  Life isn't about you, it's about everyone else...And your experiences with everyone else make up YOU!|`|df9a2bc65b9256f2948d5b73efcf40fdaa	Try setting aside some time to do what makes you relaxed, just so you can think about things. Try joining a yoga class or do something regularly that relaxes you, like regular massages or pedicures. try out everything you can possibly imagine and talk to people about recommendations.<br>  <br>  for inspiration you can try to read more books and watch more movies, learn about culture from other countries, listen to more kinds of music and try to analyze what it actually means rather than just listening. try something different. and seek inspiration wherever you can. think outside the box!<br>  <br>  good luck :]
5f08fec74e91bf775a86c713d4731112aa	First of all, is your father around?  you could ask him to speak with her about the insults.  second of all, if things are really how you say they are, that is not right for her to be abusing you verbally in that manner.  i cannot believe a mother would say those things but hey some people are crazy.  If you have sex for the reasons you listed then you will only feel worse, not better, i hate to tell you that.  you are looking for that fulfilling relationship that only a mother can provide.  To help though, try spending more time with good, supportive friends, or other relatives.  If you hook up with a random guy, chances are it won't be his first time also, who knows what you could end up with!! Keep your pants on dear.|`|AA10766729	You sound like a beautiful, smart person.  Your mother is the ugly one.  If you are of an age (18+), get out of that situation as quickly as you can.  You don't need that kind of sh!t from anyone.  <br>  <br>  Don't feel terrible!  Does your mother have a relationship?  If not, her attitude is what is causing it.  <br>  <br>  Don't have sex till you're ready, and certainly don't do it just to "prove" something to your mother - who doesn't deserve to have any sort of relationship with you at all!  <br>  More than likely, she'd just add the word "sl*t" or "whore" to the list of filth she calls you out of ignorance and jealousy.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7e0753afb0f2dc14c3fec9e00a784a33aa	first of all tell someone at work about the guy who is harrasing u and then tell ur mom that she should be ashame of her self for calling u names. by the way how old r u? u do know if ur of legel age u can move out and not worry about what ur mom has to say about u.|`|AA10297098	you should never have sex for anyone but yourself, sometimes parents think they know all about their kids but they really don't.|`|AA11501962	DONT HAVE SEX YET!!!! ur mom seems like shes acting like a real bit*h and she doesnt kno how 2 love sum1. but 4realz gurl dont go out and have sex with jus whoevr cuz that wont b good...u dont have 2 prove ur mom anything rii now until she knos how 2 show sum REAL LOVE! talk 2 God about all of this and i guarantee ur life will get better.Good luck and God Bless! :)<br>  ps: U ARE A VERY BEAUTIFUL LADY...not the least bit ugly...and i aint jus syin that|`|AA12204864	Tell your mother that you know that she is truly taking out her self loathing and self hatred on the wrong person. That you don't have to do one thing in this world to please this woman, your life is not her choice it is gods. And that it doesn't matter what you look like, someone loves it. Believe me, everyone is someones cup of tea...|`|AA10351189	u do not hav sex just because u wan to prove something...that's stupid|`|AA11102246	Parents sometimes doesn't know how to show love and is easier for them to show anger or disrespect. If I was you I would move from home and enjoy your life. Don't let anyone to put you down it doesn't matter if is your own mother. No one has the right to treat you like that. What it makes a person ugly is not their physical appearance is their personality and the way they treat others. There are beautiful girls that are unhappy, yes they might be popular but once they are alone they are miserable. Don't make a mistake trying to prove wrong to your mother. Don't run the risk of catching a disease. There is someone special for you out there, take your time and enjoy your life. If your mother regrets having you too bad for her because she is missing the wonderful experience of having a wonderful daughter...|`|AA11291170	Try to restrain yourself from committing what you think is morally wrong. Your mom might tease you, but she is looking at the mirror and laughing at herself! Be positive about your look and your physique. None of us had any say in the choice of what we came out to be from the worm; male, female, fat, thin, tall or short, these are variations which we have, which we use and that is why life is beautiful. It would be a horrible world if we all look exactly alike! The inner soul of humanity is the beauty of creation- cultivate it, be happy with the way you look and the way you are.|`|AA11461601	tell her to **** off no mom should treat u like that EVER call her an old hag and and tell her those modles could afford plastic surgery see what she says then!!!|`|ffb046b7372d5189a426271b2fba5769aa	Ugly people have sex too so that doesn't prove anything.

Everyone must admit even the person that is NOT AT ALL attractive to you becomes easier on the eyes when they have a beautiful spirit.<br>  <br>  What's on the inside will certainly come out and a beautiful spirit covers a multitude of would be flaws (beauty is in the eyes of the beholder) because physical beauty is not only fleeting but also skin deep.

Please don't be a sheep and say *I like pie...*<br>  <br>  Be confident, and give him a COUPLE of compliments, not too many!

5f568984c834bb49358fc78371558d20aa	Not at all!  I'd find it hot and sexy . . . there's no bigger turn-on than a man who knows how to pleasure himself and isn't scared of creativity in the bedroom.  I'd have to come in and help him!|`|0d4fb83fb09340408fa705d50d52c503aa	well i have walked in on my girl using my toys and i usually join in|`|5451ce4d5f0c13007b0b038cf69769ecaa	i don't own sex toys!!!!

I would help. I love freaky. He is the one with the problem with it.
ZrTap5nlaa	tell him that it bothers you that he doesnt have a close relationship with his parents. you can tell alot about a man by how he treats his mother and if that is indication of how he is going to treat you then you need to say something. tell him that you dont understand why he feels he needs to trash his parents when if it wasnt for them he wouldnt even be here. i would offer to go visit his parents with him to see what there relationship is really like. hope it helps and good luck!|`|1XaNzzx3aa	sounds like he will find out the hard way if he doesnt straighten his act up|`|hU73gsMTaa	i dunno|`|wSCtDmCWaa	tell him youd love it if you could have a good relationship with them.<br>  tell him about your relationships with your parents and tell him that family means alot to ou.<br>  <br>  keep trying to help him<br>  good luck
jQdkjNF8aa	Fighting is so immature...Just avoid her as best as possible. It's too bad that your best guy friend may not want to be friends with you anymore just because of your boyfriend. It's not like he's dating him lol... If you feel getting back with your ex is the best thing, who cares what other people have to say? Do what you think is best for yourself.|`|jh5JLRqMaa	Good grief get out of this situation.  Relationships should not have anywhere near this much drama.|`|6XHZSN5Haa	Date who you want and learn how to fight back!|`|AA11315306	The trite answer is follow your heart , the actual one is be true ti yourself. <br>   There are , or should be people in your life who have treated you with love and respect ( Especially respect ) in the past and will continue to do so. Listen to these people , take their opinions seriously. Maybe your guy-friend doesn't want you to be hurt again , doesn't want to watch you suffer over again , and he believes this will be the case if you return to your ex. <br>  <br>  As far as the little twitches threatening you , buy some pepper spray.|`|f1tGxPXBaa	If you like him fight for what you think is right (even if it means you will get your *** kicked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

AA12086491	umm, i would say both of these matters are something you and your love interest have to decide where you stand with them.
G7dvZtAZaa	You work for the World Health Organization and talk about yourself in the third person!? What an odd character you are.|`|2yOPVi5Taa	By the way that's not where he works and I think you would have to deal with more whining then you are now to keep her.
eI4IxBaLaa	Because if you want to keep them, you have to let them be free to be themselves.  If you try to stifle them, force them to be something they naturally aren't, you'll make them eventually resent you.  If you allow them total freedom, they won't be able to get enough of you, because they'll feel SO GOOD about their relationship with you.
JDaFhgOhaa	Yo should wait him to ask u !!!|`|109a6dfea08822c4b720a3d5f9fa6b9eaa	A guy who attends church is likely to have old-fashioned values. Rather than ask him out, try to be more encouraging. More smiles, more eye contact, etc. Best of luck. This could be a match made in heaven!|`|84f095788f307d2fdcfa7ee05e590bdfaa	even though i am only 14, that is the same with me and one of my best guy friends he holds my hand tells me he loves me and flirts with me but yet he still says that he doesn't like me but yet i feel like if he didn't like me he would be doing that stuff to me. i mean i LOVE him and i REALLY like him. i ask him out and he said no but you know i think it was to soon and we are still GREAT friends so i doubt that that it will ruin your friendship. i mean it didn't bother our friendship
47f46b3fd3ae946b98d5fca9ebdc87a3aa	Time is your best friend. I know it's easier said than done, but I've been there before. I'm glad I'm not with that person anymore. It's very painful to let go, but sometimes it's the best that can happen. Maybe Mr.right is out there waiting to meet you.|`|37bdc5bddf7573b864ffefc13a66d300aa	maybe you have to seriously work it out with the male species. but what if the guy you want is not good for you.would you want to live in hell with him or have peace of mind but without him in your life? hard choice?

0771dd853edb466ba95dc6df9a71b58baa	My husband (not at the time) lied to me about who he was playing racquetball with and he tore his hamstring (couldn't walk on it for over a month and never has played racquetball again).<br>  <br>  It's not so much that you have to know that something happens to someone as "payback," you just have to think of Karma for yourself. If you treat others nicely, you will be treated the same way (and actually it's not in this life, it's in your next life that you'll benefit from how you behaved now).<br>  <br>  My daughter and I have tons of the stories you're referring to, though.|`|b402a3c916f7468b54ad48aa6528138daa	I have several.  When I was 18, this girl I hated got pregnant - I of course said that it severed her right - 3 weeks later, I'm pregnant. I was a senior in high school.<br>  I was a brat when I was younger and was mean and wished bad things on lots of people.  After about 25, my life went down hill.  I got cancer, money troubles, gained weight.  <br>  I have spent the last few years trying to get my karma in a good place.  I'm nice to everyone (well most people) now.|`|AA12131791	I have several also but this one is my favourite...<br>  <br>  When my husband left me he wanted to take the x-box and the playstation (both of which we bought as a couple) but i agreed as at the time i hated them as he was always on it... anyway three weeks after he took it i found out from a friend that a power serge went through the house and the x-box, the playstation and the tv it was hooked up to all blew up.. nothing else in the house was damaged..<br>  <br>  I never laughed harder in my life|`|2NoAFDq0aa	I think the point is we dont seek happiness if someone goes thru bad karma, let the law of karma work its way, be good, do good and good will happen to you. dont care or seek pleasure in someone else's pain too. we all make mistakes and that is what teaches us to do good karma.|`|QoQ8ko03aa	With me it's (most of the times) very scary. There are many incidents but the most scary was this one. There is a guy who was married and had a kid. His wife was cheating on him but didn't want to get divorce. Now this guy became my friend; same date of birth, same years and many things in common but we were (and are still) just friends, though very good. This friendship always remained in limits and nothing that can remotely be related to sex ever happened between us. <br>  Now his wife, somehow, thought that we were having an affair so she started calling me. Then some other guys with whom this woman had affairs (and my God, she had many) started calling and threatening me. I am a strong person, so I didn't get intimidated and told them that we were just friends. This kept on happening for around two months and I really got fed up with the situation.<br>  This woman went to meet her mother along with the kid when she got killed in the earthquake; the child was saved.<br>  This happened in 2005. The guy and I are still friends. He has a relationship with another girl and is happy about it and I have a relationship with another guy and am most happy in my love life. <br>  I believe that what goes around, comes around but I never wanted any such thing to happen to that woman.<br>  There are many more incidents in my life but this was really very very scary.|`|nJcSXcGgaa	this may help you to understand it better<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.11meditation.co.nr" rel="nofollow">http://www.11meditation.co.nr</a><br>  <br>  there are some basic concepts and examples of karma from Buddhist religion.<br>  <br>  hope it helps|`|twibrGkraa	yes i believe in it... what goes around, comes around.. as the saying goes.  He cheated on you and he broke his toe.. so he got his in return!
ev72f1U5aa	That's is life, babe. You cant get everything u want. But u should be happy with what u have. U must have shared many good moments with him. So cherish the good memories and let him go, not in tears but smiles...though it's hard. Pull urself together and pray.|`|8c9c5da69d999ce02b0998ca4cbf37ebaa	Well if thats his job then he needs to do his job, but he can still stay in contact with you .. as in writeing and maybe calling. I know it might be hard but, the long miss will be worth it also.|`|e54e3842e88b1fe04f8e5fc918d3ee32aa	You stay strong, not just for yourself, but for him as well!  If it's love, if it's so deep, stick with it, and it will last!  Nothing can destroy true love!  It might take work, but he's worth it right?  Best of luck!|`|ecbba3ff55c54c6721b0bcec9d42ad3faa	Stay with him. My dad is gone too and him and my mom still love each other. and if they were in your situation they wouldn't split up b/c if someone really cared about you leaving just wouldn't be a caring thing. there are other ways to keep in touch. Hope it works out!|`|jqR5npmqaa	you dont have to split up, you can still call each other and stuff. i have a friend who does that and everything is ok

tgWWVvAJaa	I have a friend who is exactly the same way. <br>  Think about y it has been 3 years and he still hasn't opened up or expressed his feelings to u....The best way to get throught to somebody is to put urself in their shoes and look at everything including urself in their perspective. Once u have done that think hard if this is the guy is for u and where u and him stand if it is friendship, relationship, or nothing at all. Its better to find out now than waste ur time. Than u should try and bring up a conversation with him. Just whatever u do don't confront him to show his feelings this would just make him even more cold, quite, and closed up and most likly to back out of ever showing his feelings to u. Just Try and ease ur way into a converstation that will eventually lead u both into coming up to the topic of ur feelings and emotions. This way a comfortable environment has been created for the both of u to talk freely to one another.  U should try and get him to do most of the talking becasue this will get him out his quiteness therefore making him less closed up. Than look for signs that show feelings toward things it could be anything that just makes him say "i feel like"...That way it shows that he does have feelings and he just has many thick layers before u can get to the core aka his heart. Once he gets his feelings out about alot of stuff just jump in when the time is right and say u make me feel like that....Just get something out than step back and see his reaction. If he is not to cold and seems like he wants to continue the conversation than u know ur on the right track towards reaching his heart and winning him over. <br>  I hope my experience helpes u get what u want :)|`|AA10578359	Walk away from him.

HOWEVER, even though he's not quite like this anymore, in the beginning of our relationship he was very much like this.  I was patient and now it's easier for him to express how he feels about me.  It took some threatening of leaving and coldness on my part to show him I care, but I'm not going to settle for anything!  And it worked, I was patient and I've talked to him and talked to him and now it's now trouble.  He knows what I expect and I've gotten used to him too.  It's all about compromise.  Maybe he's not ready for a more serious relationship than what you're ready for, but doesn't know how to say it at times.  Instead of guessing, ASK!

It's like they want you when they think they can't get you. But, it sounds like you should find someone that appreciates you anyway. Forget him!|`|JyuoPnnKaa	So your suddenly mature overnight <br>  I think you ll still be winging to answers in 2 years time go away and stop wasting our time waste your own|`|KKUrosXWaa	Show him how much you love him.|`|sMKsBDSFaa	I know that this is gonna be hard to hear but ive been in a situation kind of like this! Unfortunately right now there isnt much that u can do!  U need to be without him for a few weeks to get over whatever is stressing u out and try to b a bit mature (cant believe he said that ur immature). U see if u tell him now that u will change he wont believe u cause things will be great for a while cause u will be watching what u say and do. But after a while it falls apart again cause u cant be something that ur not! If he loves u he should accept u for who u r faults and all! I bet he isnt perfect but u still love him even with his flaws!!!  Maybe u should reassess ur situation and relationship. Do u wanna be with a man who isnt gonna support u and be with u no matter what!  Besides in a way i think that he is making excuses cause he wants to be single for a while but still have a chance to get back together with you when he is done having his fun! (that happened to me!) Dont let him be in charge!!!!|`|G9eT3oGzaa	well have u taken a look at how u act?u have 2 really take a look.and if certain things annoy him. u should change it.<br>  if u really like him the way u say.<br>  just show him.but damm don't beg..<br>  if he doesn't come back to you.then owell. move on to the next..<br>  there's someone out there who will be there with you know matter how you act.|`|LsOcukmpaa	If he is really love you... then he should understand you and try to rectify your weakneses, attatude etc. I think he is using you or passing time.... dont change yourself and trying some who likes you and your attatude|`|aNUAcWriaa	Well, first of all have some self respect. dont call yourself immature. Human beings do crazzy things when they are stressed out. Now the answer :)... Just apologise to him . Tell him exactly what you feel. If he REALLY REALLY loves you so much, He'll come back running to you. <br>  Guys are not that complicated. I am sure he'll understand :)...<br>  Best Luck :)|`|gTamcW1saa	I thought that if i were you,i will apologized to him sincerely and tell him i still love him inside my heart . Maybe juz this once?If not,then he's a big weirdo who doesn't even understand you.Tell him that you aren't yourself these days as you are under stressed.If he really likes you,he will noticed that you are down thesedays and try to cheer you up.If he can't even realized that you are under stressed i think he's not observant at all.Either build back your relationship or simply stumble over it!Make a choice and start your actions!Good luck!!!P.S dragging this on will only hurt both parties.Make a decision!
5e7c9e17fa413bb3da30f3b33c42403faa	no its not
AA10325918	i believe in that saying. However, we should not base everything on such thing. It is always us who make our destiny. Deal with your feelings first. If you guys still have that sparks for each other and things work out between the two of you, then you have just proven to yourself that the saying was true..:)|`|ZXv6sILeaa	i believe in one thing and that is: if you let somthing go and if it comes back  after a while then it is meant to be!!!!|`|gTamcW1saa	Is it or not?It depends on you .I totally agree with the sentence!=D  If bumping into your first love made you feel special and unforgettable,then i think you still feel something for that person!If it means nothing to you, then well,you still can be normal friends with her,right?|`|9b9e99a6ce44ae131c2bd937da6d180daa	If they are single and available count your lucky stars, if they are seeing someone, cool it ,back off, this may be your hardest heartbreak.|`|AA12343193	It could be a coincidence... But most importantly, ask yourself if you have feelings for that person or not|`|NeTcIT2Paa	I dont believe in fate, but its definetly a sign that you two were meant to cross paths again. Now, what this chance meeting turns into is all up to you. Just because you run into each other again doesnt necessarily mean that you two will jump back into a whirlwind romance, ya know?

I can't... I hate... I love... are just a few of the words that we have over used in our extended vocabulary to the point that no one believes in them any more when said with great feeling and depth|`|68lGkNyDaa	Everyone today thinks things have to be new and improved, not so. Plain old "I love you" will never go out of style.

IxzAuMjFaa	Asking him out won't hurt. but always be sure to proceed with caution. friendships that start online should GENERALLY be given more time to blossom. you have to know this guy in & out before get too comfortable of jumping right in for a relationship, which MAY end up with you regretting it. Take your time, don't make hasty decisions.also, use your woman's instincts.  After all, it's your LIFE, your FUTURE,  we are talking about here, Right? Good luck!!|`|AA10152907	bring up the fact that you are single... when you two are talking about it LOOK HIM IN THE EYES|`|SrUwUrE1aa	make the first move-- take some initiative, and his response will immediately let you know whether he not he feels the same way you do. go for it! =]|`|wwlP29I1aa	He is shy and he is axpecting you to make the first move so make it and see how he feels about it, or you can just play along with his game and be like he is being to you. Or you can just randamly add the movie topic into your conversation|`|lZ54Ixlbaa	life is short .ask him? move forward ,guys dig agressive girls...|`|mWkpqtL3aa	First off... make sure he doesn't have a woman.  Or his mind on someone else.  Just because you dream about something and a guy talks to you a lot doesn't mean he's into you in that way.<br>  <br>  Secondly, talk to him.  I would come right out and tell him how you feel and let him take it from there.  They gotta learn sometime. LOL|`|zPLBBw8Laa	you have to be patient<br>  take it from an exdoormat<br>  i have been dumped more times than i can count<br>  all by losers.<br>  dont ask me why?|`|b8b06f4ecb41e0dcbbef0bdfac455625aa	Send him a email asking him to go to the movies with you!<br>  <br>  No big deal ?<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|0b8db0ba29e1be2aab2a7322891be7fcaa	If you get a good feeling and he responds positively when you flirt, sure, keep pursuing him. Eventually you'll find out, and you've got nothing to lose either way.
AA11112572	I can say that you really are in awkward position and I can't blame you for that. I guess, you and your 13-yr. old best friend, should take some time. There's is no hurrying though, you can talk about it when necessary in the coming days. Also, if you're going to talk about, better let her know how you feel. And let her know where you are right now in her life. If that's just a thing of the past, let her know as well. It's important to move on and continue on with your friendship. There are so much more in life that you can enjoy as friends. Maybe at this time, she just needs you to understand and accept everything about her.|`|JztuC9I9aa	if you like her as more then a friend, then you have to tell her. if you don't tell her how you feel, then you will continue to grow apart. just because she isn't a virgin, doesn't make her a different person. shes still your friend and she is there for you. don't keep secrets from you good friends, this could ruin your friendship. hope this helps.|`|TnLcIXxCaa	is it a big problem if ur fren still virgin or not.<br>  if u like her.<br>  u have tell her.<br>  u will regret it if u dun|`|c1Xw4oThaa	do her!!
K1biaWU7aa	Wow, I really feel your pain and it really hurts.  I am so sorry for how you are feeling right now.  I've been there too.  Here are some things to think about or try.  First, stay busy, no matter what it is.  Second, surround yourself with good friends and family and speak with them.  This is a time when you need to lean on someone and a time when friends step up and be friends.  If need be, be direct and tell them you need help.  Third, try to get away physcally from your present environment if at all possible.  Give yourself a break. Fourth, concentrate on being good to yourself (exercise, eat well and enough).  Fifth, if you have routines, keep to them no matter how difficult that may be.  Lastly, and prehaps most importantly, ask yourself where your own self worth comes from.  Deep down inside is a voice within you.  That voice tells you things that are at the core of who you are. For instance, that you are a good person and you are important.  You have allowed someone else's actions to over run that voice.  Happiness comes from that voice and not other's actions.  Make a list of things that you think make you as a person have value.  This is who you are, and nobody else can tell you otherwise.  This is a very difficult time in your life but it is also an incredible opportunity for self betterment.  Good Luck...|`|CN69WYKUaa	It's been 2 1/2 years for my fiance and I, and he just recently confessed thinking of breaking up with me. I thought my world had ended. I know how you feel, and I cry all the time now, and have been trying to be perfect so he doesn't. Pretty pathetic, huh?<br>  <br>  I am sorry. I really am. But time will pass, no matter how it seems you won't get over him. But you will smile and laugh again, I promise. It will take a lot of time, but you will. If you need to ever talk, I will be here for you!<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck in finding your soulmate, and i hope he finds you soon!|`|rm8ozxRDaa	you know most people don't last in a long term relationship but some do well they do only when they find the right person for them selves and maybe you just haven't found someone that loves you the way you deserve to be loved. and love like that just doesn't go way like that..well Maye you feel like that because you love him and he said he loved you and well maybe hes not ready for a serious relationship but if he moves on you have to move on to but your not worthless  and you should feel lucky to be with you and be happy that you were their for him  but you cant be their for some one if their not there for you.|`|AA10504499	some times people just grow apart and one day realize they don't feel the way they thought they did. There is nothing wrong with you its just a part of life. He's obviously a coward because he broke up with you over the phone. He doesn't deserve you if he can't see how great a person you really are. Its tough to move on but try to keep busy don't dwell on it to much.
344fca07219fb35dbfcb7edbc214204baa	Both, since you're saying sexy, im assuming the cheerleader is of reasonable beauty & figure. Sexy peopel attract guys, its that simple. The only difference is that the "jerks" will make a move on the sexy cheerleader while the nice guys will go home and think about the girl all day meanwhile jerking himself off.<br>  <br>  Think about it this way. When it comes to primal nature, does the personality of a person affect what he visually sees as attractive? (unless its the personality of a gay guy :O)<br>  <br>  to prove my point further, do nice guys and jerks think differently of jessica alba's beauty? <br>  Obviously not.<br>  <br>  Vo.|`|UA6SIyyyaa	this is dumb. obvious answer, seriously.|`|2qM6Neh5aa	First of all, are you a girl or a guy? Cuz I couldn't tell from you photo image... it looks like a guy... or you could be a girl with very short hair. But, I disgress... back to the question:<br>  Cheerleaders are atheletes who take a major part in boosting the spirits of fans and team players. Like all women, they have the opportunity to spice up their appearance and sex appeal in anything they do. It's all up to the individual in how they see themselves. You don't need a cheerleader's uniform to attract good guys or jerks, your personality does that for you. I'm sure they get the same reaction from cheerleaders the way girls react to a guy in a football uniform.... rrraarrrllll..... Good Luck!|`|fdfzYLOyaa	Well it will attract jerks but it will also attract nice guys. most men love cheerleaders. If you want to be a cheerleader just remember don't alienate your friends because you will be popular they where there before you decided to do this and I'm sure they support you OK.|`|gzE0D5OCaa	yes.|`|xBoBd3JAaa	The cheerleader can attract all kinds of attention but the fact is, what kind of people does the cheerleader want to be around with
OmZxgKHRaa	In love is how you feel about someone emotionally and initmately like in a relationship. To love someone is to care about them more than most people like the same love you would have for your parents.<br>  Basically the difference between caring and intimacy emotionally and physically|`|hzuim98Raa	He's not into you like you probably want him to be...|`|AA10878115	He is not in love with you. He loves you like a friend. Sorry.

xCoFY8Yiaa	Ok, simply put, men are from mars and women are from venus. Just kidding, but really men and women are different, we are attracted to very different things, thankfully. Men are very physical and visual. They were designed this way. Why I dont know and to be honest it is hard for girls to be ok with this. It is how they are built. Women are more emotional and relational. Women want a man who is going to make them laugh, and more importantly be able to take good care of them. Men want someone attractive. This is normal. Now even though that is what our bodies tell us we need to not abuse it. There is a point where men become shallow. As there is women, such as if the man is not rich enough. Also a man who can not control his eyes and his heart is not worth the hasstle. However, I am disgusted with the number of men who are leaving their wives because they are gaining weight. I have seen on here a few times where the man needs to be smacked over the head with a two by four. Women after ageing and having kids will not look as great as they did at 22. However, neither do men. Therefor men have no room to complain.|`|0eff4c99d540e6d2d442a619b510c7dcaa	girls want fairytale princes and guys want playboy models.  its just how we were raised for the most part.|`|48qlw5bQaa	haha, yeah, most of us are.

jbmknjYAaa	I do not think you should cheat on ur wife. You have kids and you gotta think of that first. If your cought you'll lose most of your wealth and wife. You will not see your kids alot also.

I believe the best way to have a good strong relationship is to go into the situation with no expectations. Get to know him. When you're sure he's a good person, then consider moving forward. Too often people jump into relationships before knowing the person at all and you realize after it's too late that it's a bad idea.|`|AA12151600	Take that hardhat off and smack him in the head with it.

9cde4f091c95b44ebd1deff864cdaf28aa	First, ask him if he likes anyone. If he says he does ask him who. If he doesn't want to answer then don't push it. And one day when you're talking just tell him that you really like him. Tell him you hope it doesn't affect anything or make things awkward between you two, but you like him and you heard he likes you back, and you just want to know if it's the truth or not.|`|9XrqW0pNaa	if you pressure him he might back off and you will never know it. just take things one thing at a time, hang out with him and gradually everything will fall into place!|`|2Fy1huxeaa	No, dont tell him too soon, it wont be any good either for you or him, since you are not sure about his feelings. <br>  You can try to ask him casually, just to make sure about it.

AA10702820	Stay away from her until she's able to go up to you and tell you what's going on. Don't try to keep finding out, it won't do any good. Whenever she starts to talk to you again, ask her why she got mad at you like that. If it's for something pretty reasonable like family problems or a simple misunderstanding, then let it slide. But if she continues to do this, then maybe you should stay away from her for good.<br>  <br>  'Hope I helped!|`|d8WN4WNOaa	You know...i had that same problem. If she just out of the blue hates you, then she's not your true  friend. I learned to ignore my use to be friend. And, now i'm super happy. But....follow your heart to what you think is right.|`|h6B07HPOaa	If you know for sure that you didn't do anything wrong, then just ignore her.|`|yaK1qS2uaa	my friend does dat to me all the time just let her come to u dont go around actin like ur her puppy dog jus wait and if she doesn't come talk to u than she probaly doesnt need to be yo friend no mo
T6H5r54Aaa	First, I think a translation into English (for myself and future answerers) is necessary.<br>  <br>  PLEASE HELP: I NEED TO KNOW IF HE LIKES ME. HELP!<br>  <br>  OK; well, there is this boy, and I could find this word (which word? In a crossword puzzle?), and then he found it for me (ahhh, you could NOT find this word. OK.). And Leo told Trevor, "Why did you do that?  You like her or something?" And then Leo and Trevor went off a little ways to talk. I went behind them 'cause I had to put a book back. Leo said, "Dude, she's right here." Trevor started blushing. He smiles every time he sees me: does he like me?<br>  <br>  * * *<br>  <br>  Was that, by any chance, the first book you had handled in your life? <br>  <br>  I think he might have mild interest in you, but not full-fledged infatuation. Why, quite frankly, is beyond me. Are you really physically attractive or something? If he ever recieves a love letter from you, he might rethink his decision.|`|9vXpNHPmaa	sounds like he likes you but i hope you dont talk like that in real life. with the never ending sentences|`|d8WN4WNOaa	He definetly likes you. He has the hots for you. Whatever your doing for him to like you, keep it up. And maybe he'll ask you out!|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	he likes you|`|20700d248a7c2ab6dd75fe6276405a9aaa	he likes you, and you like run on sentences
QmyiyshQaa	Oh man that guy just like me. Well i did that too, because i need some time for myself, i wanted to build my own computer, design video games and hanging out with my friend. So i stopped calling my gf, but now shes calling me 24/7. Yup also, stressful on my job and family problem for me<br>  So i guess your bf just need some time for himself. Just let him relax. Call him once week if you can, Plan a relaxing date, maybe walk around on the park and maybe rent some movies.
vJasD3Soaa	Possession is nine tenths of the law, or at least it is in the UK, he gave it as a gift you have no responsiblity to give it back to him, although if you want him out of your life perhaps giving it back would get shot of him.  <br>  <br>  Personally I'd keep it and ignore all emails.|`|6Sya3wB8aa	keep ur pride and giv it back. u can buy another 1 im sure u cn afford it.....u cnt buy pride.....hope that helps|`|Iq5nMxjqaa	A  lot  depends  on  the  bracelet .   If  it  was  a  gold  bracelet  or  an  expensive  piece  of  jewellery ; perhaps  you  should  give  it  back .   If  it  is  a  pretty  trinket  of  no  great  value , keep  it ; you  can  say  to  the  boy , you  really  like  it  and  would  like  to  keep  it , to  remember  the  nice  time  you  had  together .|`|dQQGJmMAaa	He give you the bracelet as a gift so you should keep it. If he's getting on like that personnally I wouldnt speak to him again as thats being petty. I would ignore his emails or even write back to him and say look you give me the bracelet and if your going to be like that I dont want to talk to you anymore. You dont have to be cheeky just say it in a nice way! Dont let something like that annoy you!|`|vEWTRn3Taa	pay him back rather than giving back d bracelet i love
da01a183e542dfa37aaed0cf065bd218aa	everyone is capable of cheating .never say never hon.. u should talk to him and let him know how you feel ....and anyways well look at it this way........if he leaves you for her then when she shortly thereafter cheats on him again as she inevitably will then he'd have gotten what he deserves.|`|NaoSNazNaa	I don't think there's any problem at all if he's just trying to make amends with his ex, as long as he doesn't spend too much time with her. I would trust his word, it seems fairly harmless.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, this is unrelated, but granted this man is not your husband:<br>  <br>  "i know my bf loves me and wud never cheat"<br>  <br>  That's the mistake a lot of girls make and end up hurt, to be quite honest...|`|66d8ca141e45dbc278c587a59dbda423aa	You are an honest to god disgrace to ANYONE who speaks the English language.  Is THIS what the public education system is spitting out these day?  <br>  <br>  You spelled the word "would" w-u-d and you think your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend is your biggest problem?|`|DdYxu5Jqaa	tell him he is not allowed to talk to her.|`|bcS4GlCuaa	No, because if he cheats, u can find someone else, someone better thats actually faithful.  Dont overstress over a bf, a husband sure, but not a bf.|`|uR7YUITwaa	If he say he hates her you have nothing to worry bout. but stay close to him.
5RAM4T7eaa	talk to him more closely...words are worth alot in finding that out...does he talk to u as a friend? or as someone that has a crush? example "it was soo  much fun talkin to u" but from wat you've said ..like he hugs u alot etc...i think he pretty much does<br>  <br>  hope this helps! <br>  <br>  cheers <br>  <br>  good luck|`|9180afe6f28d6aa0dfbf88b2475729a8aa	well one way to see is he like u is ask him on a date not a serious date but to like the movies and  go with his friends yours then in the date he might get some stuff like pop corn or something or pay for stuff or in line for popcorn   pretend like yo u don't have anymore money and make sure hes in line so he might pay for it to then it show he cares which also means he likes you|`|IXHkhJ79aa	I'd just come out and ask him if he wants to come out with you.|`|egcmmm65aa	well..u could just wait a while to see if he still flirts with u,and if he does,ask him on a movie night.its not a date,just a casual meeting between friends.if it goes well,ask him on more adult dates,nothing to adult though.thats no way to get a guy ;).hope it all works out :)
TR2f2Aqqaa	if u dont like him and dont want to b his girlfriend u shud deffinetly break up with him, he doesnt sound to bad so sit him down and just tel him right now you dont want to b in a relationship and just break it off gently, u can carry on being mates with him and u never no u might end up liking him and geting bak together! but just explain to him that you feeling mixed emotions and tell him u want to be his friend. im sure he will appreciate u being honest:) good luck i hope it goes well|`|RCdzTI54aa	keep it real with him let him know how you feel.if you keep try and you feel the way you do about him you will start showing it and it will be more of a problem and you are looking for your happiness and if he not it then why keep going and trying to make it work|`|bZn5exwtaa	ask him what he really likes about you and stuff then stop doing them and act the oppisite then he wont like you anymore and you wont have to deal with breaking up with him also act like a pig and burp and fart alot that should help lol|`|d1c1bdce1f77fe4a0d90a384dad69438aa	tell him you dont want to go out with him anymore,better sooner than later.
f2WPCSN5aa	I think the point of telling your teenager he needs to grow up is to actually hurt his feelings. Ofcourse you don't want to, but by doing it, it makes him feel like he's dissapointed you. That way, he will try to grow up and impress you so you don't hurt his feelings again I guess. You can't really expect him to actually put an effort into maturing without making him feel low. I remember when I was told I needed to grow up or that I was immature, and it hurt my feelings, but it made me want to be mature and do things more maturely. Just hurt his feelings knowing that it's for the best.|`|60727b7a69fa8d5147eadb2d20e17e83aa	depends on why you think they have to grow up, if their behaviour is detremental to their safety/well being then fair enough, but anything else i would question why you feel they need to "grow up" they grow up too quickly these days, let them enjoy their teenage years while he can|`|7b7da153b919d404dedfc18a733191f6aa	I'll tell her/him to be just Natural. Be true to her/his self. Be happy and live life to the fullest.  Just do good, feel good and live a normal life.|`|E1vdI8Graa	That's hillarious!......hurt his ickle feelings?  I don't think so....if it was my teen and they were doing (or not doing rather) something that would require me to tell them to grow up, they would have to worry about me hurting a little more than his feelings!  Say like his butt just for starters!!  You need to grow up yourself and realize that the last thing a kid needs is another friend!  They need a PARENT, that will stand up to them, set good MORAL examples, and if necessary take action...instead of waiting around wondering whether or not its going to hurt their feelings.  The fact of the matter is that the truth hurts......you think the world is going to be that kind to your child?  I don't think so!   Your child needed to learn from the get go that all actions have consequences whether they be good or bad.  It is your job to raise your child to be respectful,  considerate, honest, educated (including their spiritual education......Does your child know who Jesus Christ is and that he died on the cross at Calvary to save our souls?), et cetera.  If you are waiting for someone else to do the job...you are WRONG!!  Your child needs you, HIS FATHER, not his friend! If you keep going on like you are, I do not see your child being happy and whole as an adult.<br>  Why would God have given us parents if he thought we didn't need them?|`|POAEe2Oqaa	just tell him that its time to take responsibility for his actions and his life and to start making desissions for his future. that what he starts to do now will effect him for the rest of his life.|`|YZ0oPAdYaa	It is hard but if you sit him down and have a heart to heart conversation with him and then tell him you are having this conversation with him because you love and care about him I am sure he will understand. That is what my parents did with my brother when he was a teenager. Hope it helps. Take care.|`|aNwSilUYaa	depands how old the teenagers is if he about 12 and you say u haev to grow up cause ur becoming a teenager then making it a game tell him the good part and exaplain however if it a older teenage you haev to speack when they ready and calmly you dont want to sound like you telling then what to do even if you are : P  good luck

Most rejections happen when a guy doesn't know the girl and approaches her out of nowhere. But if you do know her, just tell her that you'd like to get to know her better...the rest is history. And moments of silence can be a real *****. Avoid them by bringing up a topic to talk about.|`|bfeWdTKTaa	man its not that hard! when u talk 2 her pretend she's just a normal girl! when u see her in the halls say hey! wat class do u  have right now? and then ovbiously she will tell u wat class and then say o ok koo! well see u in lunch and then in lunch go up 2 her and make a conversation! easy as 1,2,3! if ur natural bout it so will she ;)|`|0lm3sm88aa	just say hi and ask her about her day|`|6dxhrN4gaa	Simple questions about what she likes is the easiest way to go...good luck|`|CyHARIrPaa	find out her interests and see what you have in common.<br>  but the best thing really is to just talk to her before someone else snatches her away from you.<br>  it may be hard to bite the bullet and pick up the courage<br>  but if you want it you got to go for it.<br>  good luck!!!!!!|`|HGp2st92aa	If you freeze that easily with her, just try and think of things that happen everyday or just look around at where you're at and talk about something. It doesn't matter because at least you'll be communicating with her.... And if she replies back to what you say, then continue. If you've already known her for a long time, you could just ask her if she likes anyone, she likes you, or so on....... good luck|`|QeHid3a6aa	use the oldest trick in the book ask her about some homework or if you and her heve the sema teacher then ask he out on a date,maybe to go out to eat or to the movies.

Trust me don't let dat happen its annoyin as hell.<br>  <br>  you got to make kinky detailed moves only for his eyes. kinky as in drop your pencil in front of him and bend over to pick it up. If you have classes with him, let's say, do NOT make eye contact with him or look at him unless he is speaking with you. <br>  <br>  if you're gonna talk with him in person keep a relaxed tone cuz if you're too hyper, you'll scruu your situation like hell. What you SHOULD do is be his friend for a while with occasional kinky stuff, bring up some hot topics that might turn him on...and when I mean hot....;)|`|Bx7b2Jsdaa	Well just get another guy like LT|`|MAz7llhlaa	You just said you have not talked to him in a while.

FBS1trICaa	Well that's a very hard thing to know! You see! Even if you are the most ugly person at class everyone is going to look at you because you are ugly! What I am trying to say is that people look at some one not just because they are good looking but also because they got their attention by making a noice or just saying something. Maybe she just looked at you because she saw someone move and you looked at here. But remember that you don't know how many people also looked at you just because you made that move. You can either wait for a while and if destiny makes it, for some reason you guys will talk to each other. For a joke or something in commend. But what you can also do is ruch things and go to her say hi and just say: Hey I have been looking at you because I like you a lot! I was wondering if we can get to know each other a little better. Just go were she is with spirit and energy not like you are dead. Go with a smile and just say hi! If she says no then you will know!

Tell him you both don't want to regret the things you didn't get to do when you leave.

QPTiiUm7aa	My boyfriend of 1.5 years just ended our relationship saying I deserve better and he would only make me unhappy in the end.  He has a lot of issues that I wont go into here..  HE wants to remain friends, as of course we were best friends and had the most amazing connection.  <br>  <br>  All I can say is, from my point of view.. it is impossible for me to remain friends with HIM because all I am doing is hoping and waiting for his call and waiting for him to "realize" how much he loves and misses me.  He has called several times over the last couple months and it feels great to talk to him.. even for a day or 2 later..but then the sadness hits all over again.<br>  <br>  If you still love this girl, the best thing you can do for yourself is figure out how much it hurts to just be "friends."  Can you really deal with the fact that she is seeing someone else, or are you inviting more pain into your life?<br>  <br>  Good luck..  I hope you find peace and happiness...|`|aeb6a9eccc02ea073c914dc6ce0edcaaaa	You should tell her how you feel. You probably already have but did you tell her you loved her? If she goes to you for her problems and stuff and thinks of you as a best friend, there's still a chance. You need to talk to her one and one, and have a nice long conversation. Tell her you love her.<br>  If that doesn't work out, I'm sorry. It was stupid of you to break up with her if you love her. You'll never get over someone you love. THey'll always remain in your heart, whether they are physically or emotionally there for you. Try to get her back.|`|GnLeTyPkaa	if you are gonna stay to be her friend you will still have feelings for her and still like her...tell her how you feel, and ask her how she feels, or just move on....|`|LBWpwsRFaa	You dont have to get over her. No way no how. But I think you should still be her friend. Obviously she trusts you enough to come to you with her problems. Dont let her go, and dont give her up. Just because she doesnt feel as strong as you doesnt mean she doesnt need you.|`|WetgnpGCaa	u have to cut ties with her or ull lose years of ur life..and u did say that she moved on? then y does she call u when she has issues? shes playing with u so bad and ur leeting it happen..move on<br>  PEACE<br>  not that ez eh? i went throught the same thing but we dated for 4 years and she dumped me and wated me back even though she has a bf..just move on and quit being her door matt|`|b02fe2a7455ac5a9a9b351cce12412e3aa	go search the world for someone new let her go and have nature take its course if she was the right one for you let her go and she'll come back.|`|im9pEXkGaa	yes, yes, yes! still be her friend.    things between me and this guy didnt work out, so now he just totally ignores me. hes says its his only way to get over me. but i miss him so much! i dont get why we cant still be good friends?!  how is it that if you cared so much for a person, all of the sudden you're fine with just letting them go once you find out things aren't going to be how you wanted it to be?? i think that sometimes friendship can be more valuable than a dating relationship; i just wish more people could see that.
LBWpwsRFaa	Start out small. I think the coffee thing is a good idea. Dont go extremely big or she may think you want to date her, unless that is what you want to do. lol. I think you guys have already started a good friendship, now just hang out some more.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope you find what you are looking for!!|`|0msUuC6Eaa	i think that she prob really likes you. if she is giving you all those sign then you should go ahead and ask her to coffee. She'll probably think that you wanna date her, considering all the conversations you strike up with her
Sln2M0Syaa	If all he does is sex-related comments whether joking around or not, I think he's only trying to find out how open you are about sex.; to see if you are shy about it or if you don't mind "doing it in the park." If he comes up to you to talk about personal problems or just ask you how your day has been, thEn he might like you more thAn a friend. (thEn is for time; thAn iss for comparison)|`|mTkhEFw9aa	wow i think he likes you a lot but for the wrong reasons!!! If you want a bf that respects you then he needs to like you for who you are not for how you look!!!!!! seriously!|`|m5GV1SwYaa	hmm<br>  i think hes just horney
vMri6ZP0aa	balik in ama  dia ,,apa dia sempurna...welah.welah..sok 2 cari yg sempurna|`|5l8r8ofyaa	Ini ada sebuah kisah tentang Cinta yang sempurna :-<br>  Suatu hari Plato menanyakan gurunya, apakah kita dapat menemukan pasangan yang sempurna dalam hidup kita ? <br>  <br>  Sang Guru lalu menuntun Plato ke sebuah taman bunga yang indah, lalu dia berkata, masuklah dan petikkan aku setangkai bunga yang menurut mu paling indah dalam taman ini.<br>  <br>  Maka Plato masuk kedalam taman bunga itu dan melihat bunga2 yang indah.   Waktu dia mau memetik setangkai bunnga yang indah menurutnya, dia berkata, ah... mungkin di depan masih ada yang lebih baik lagi,maka dibatalkan lah niatnya dan dia berjalan ke depan.  Namun setiap kali dia akan memetik setangkai bunga itu, setiap kali itu pula dibatalkannya, hingga akhirnya dia mencapai pintu keluar taman bunga itu tanpa memetik setangkai bunga pun.<br>  <br>  Sang Guru bertanya, kenapa engkau tidak memetik setangkai bunga di taman itu untukku ?<br>  <br>  Jawab Plato, karena setiap kali aku ingin memetik yg terbaik, selalu terbayang akan ada yang lebih baik di depan, sehingga setelah tiba di pintu keluar, saya menyesal tidak memetik satu pun.|`|6J2T55ELaa	Tipe Perempuan Menyebalkan Menurut Laki-laki<br>  <br>  Rasanya seluruh energi Anda sudah dikerahkan untuk memperoleh kekasih, tapi tidak satupun pria yang bertahan lama menjadi kekasih Anda. Pertanyaanpun muncul: apa sih yang laki-laki cari dari seorang perempuan? Pintar dandan? Tubuh aduhai atau pintar masak?  Anda boleh saja berpikiran seperti itu, tetapi kebanyakan laki-laki tidak berpikir seperti itu ketika mengajak kencan seorang perempuan pertama kali. Masalah baru muncul setelah ia sudah menjadi kekasih Anda. Bila si pria merasa ada yang tak berkenan di hatinya, pelan-pelan ia pun akan mundur teratur.<br>  Daripada Anda pusing memikirkan apa yang ia inginkan, lebih baik Anda cari tahu sikap apa yang mesti Anda hindari agar laki-laki incaran Anda tidak menjauh. Simak :<br>  Perempuan yang pamer otak<br>  Punya kekasih pintar adalah suatu kebanggan bagi lelaki. Tetapi bukan berarti ia merasa nyaman bila kekasihnya secara berlebihan memamerkan kepintarannya. Misalnya saja selalu mendebat pendapat orang lain dan merasa paling tahu akan semua hal. Sikap seperti itu bukan  akan  membuat  lelaki  terkesan tetapi justru bakal menjauhi Anda.  Lelaki  tidak membutuhkan seorang saingan yang selalu  memberinya kritik atau menunjukkan kesalahannya  melainkan seorang sparing partner yang  mampu memberi tanggapan yang tepat.<br>  Bila Anda tak mau si dia meninggalkan Anda, mulailah untuk bisa menahan diri dalam memberikan pendapat. Atur kata-kata Anda saat berbicara agar sang kekasih  tidak merasa 'terintimidasi 'oleh kepintaran Anda.<br>  - Perempuan yang terlalu bergantung<br>  Benar bila Anda berpendapat lelaki akan  senang jika ia merasa dibutuhkan oleh orang yang ia sayangi. Tetapi tentu saja ada batasnya. Seringkali, perempuan menganggap pacarnya adalah orang yang wajib mengantar, menjemput, menghibur, menemani belanja dan menonton. Awalnya ia memang menyukai sikap itu, tetapi lama kelamaan ia akan berpikir bahwa Anda bukanlah perempuan mandiri. Ia berpikir, kalau untuk mengurus diri sendiri saja Anda tak mampu, bagaimana Anda bisa diandalkan untuk mengelola rumah tangga dan, nantinya, anak.<br>  <br>  Untuk menyiasatinya, Anda harus pintar memilah-milah mana hal yang bisa Anda lakukan sendiri, dan mana yang membutuhkan bantuan kekasih Anda. Percayalah, kemandirian Anda akan membuat lelaki semakin bertekuk lutut!.<br>  - Perempuan yang selalu membicarakan pernikahan<br>  Umumnya perempuan selalu berpikir bahwa hubungan asmaranya akan berakhir di pelaminan. Akhirnya topik pernikahan pun selalu mendominasi pembicaraan dengan si dia. Tidak bisa dipungkiri hal ini juga akan memotivasi pria untuk memikirkan kelanjutan hubungan ke arah yang lebih serius. Tetapi hati-hati, bila berlebihan akan membuat ia lari tunggang langgang. Pasalnya ia akan merasa terbebani oleh harapan Anda tersebut. Sementara Anda sendiri tidak tahu apakah kekasih Anda tersebut mau menikah atau tidak.<br>  <br>  Karena itu, bersikaplah santai saat membicarakan topik yang bersinggungan dengan pernikahan. Bicarakan saja hal-hal yang lebih umum dan menyenangkan untuk dibicarakan tanpa perlu menyinggung hal-hal terlalu lebih detail, kecuali kalau rencana pernikahan Anda berdua memang hanya tinggal beberapa bulan lagi|`|84i11x4Eaa	gk bgt..<br>  gw udh prnh punya penglmn..<br>  dia cakep,tajir,putih,pinter,pokoknya TOP d..<br>  ujung2x putus..justru klo cewe yg ngangep dirinya sempurna dia malah suka merasa tinggi hati sehingga byasnya sombg dan ngangep gmpg bgt buat dptin cow bru sehingga dirinya semena-mena..hehehe<br>  klo gw maah yg penting hatinya..|`|B0X2k5SOaa	klo cari jodoh menurut agama ada beberapa hal pertama agamanya, kedua keluarganya, ketiga asal usulnya, keempat hartanya dll. klo org jawa bialng bebet, bobot, dan bibit. <br>  cari jodoh kan buat seumur hidup (klo bisa) jadi harus yg terbaik, jgn gegabah.<br>  tapi  diatas itu kan msh bisa dikalahkan dengan masing2 saling menyintai dan percaya|`|Fw2QOksYaa	mnurut gw c penting jg euy|`|G7IBn0QQaa	gue sedih juga denger kisah lo.<br>  berarti dia orangnya perfectsionis, kolopun lo berhubungan dengan dia, pasti gak langgeng deh.<br>  dengan dia nolak elo, berarti dia gak serius ma lo.<br>  dah tinggalin aja...lupakan|`|Opg6PLjvaa	cie... patah hati nieh ceritanya ...!<br>  <br>  hehehe...!|`|PzlTuVWwaa	Wah..dimana2 semua manusia musti nyadar diri!!

If you display a more mature attitude than your peers, you will attract someone of similar maturity level..... it's not about acting older or faking your age, as you will undoubtedly come unstuck.......... age should never be the criteria to attraction, however personality is.
AA10735939	Guys go to clubs to get drunk and meet women<br>  Women go to clubs to get drunk and meet men<br>  Why else do you think both dress to impress?<br>  And don't believe that crap about only dancing with "her friends".

If she starts going all the time, then make a stand. Once in a while its ok, you trust your gf so let her have some fun. She'll respect you more if you do and she'll reward you..if you know what I mean. ;)|`|9HPUzoJRaa	clubs exist for one reason. . . .for people to meet, get to know eachother and hook up.  that is it.  maybe she will just hang out and have a good time.  but do not even for one minute(trust me on this) trust that a guy wont come along.  if she looks good that is all it will take.  there are guys out there who know what to say, how to say it, etc.  I have seen guys make out with girls who are married. do you see what I am getting at.  Maybe you should go with her.|`|bmQilXDEaa	let the girl go. you have to trust her. she will be fine with her friends.<br>  the truth is guys will probably try to dance with her, but she can simply say no. dancing is nothing to take serious, ur the one she cares about and not some random guy she is gonna meet once in her life.<br>  plus, she will respect you even more if you let her go, she wouldn't want to let you down.|`|yqfEQ7lZaa	girl going to the club reads trouble all over it.honestly i think its a bad idea unless u can actually go with her.i mean just think of the atmosphere in a club.trouble all over it!!!!|`|AYC8MiIfaa	Ask her if you can tag along =] you'd have fun! if not then just trust her, believe me if you tell a guy to back off on the dance floor, with all those bouncers around, they usually will.|`|DiwsZSaRaa	Tell her yes she can go with her friends you don't want to be to protective of her that will drive her mad.

x3EPqezJaa	Go to Al-Anon.|`|AA10248966	Alcoholics Anonymous literature, websites and meetings and also, codependents anonymous meetings which is the core root of why they drink. Google both|`|RKhSRMlZaa	I experienced the exact same situation as you up until about a month ago.  My husband would go 4-5 days a week with heavy drinking and was capable of taking weeks off or cutting back to only a day or two, but it would always spiral out of control.  <br>  <br>  One day, after about 6 straight nights of drinking, he had to stop all of a sudden to go to work because he had some important stuff to take care of at work.  He ended up having a terrible panic attack and shaking and breaking down at work to where he had to go home.  <br>  <br>  We found out that the drinking was a result of a generalized anxiety disorder that he's been battling with for years.  His mom has the same kinds of symptoms, only she's on medication for it and manages it very well.  After he went to the doctor and was put on a low-dose anti-anxiety medication, his desire to constantly drink went away and he is now able to simply enjoy alcohol in moderation.  He has since been weaned off of the anti-anxiety meds (its addictive) and has been put on a non-addictive mood-stabilizer.  Since this has happened I have noticed a HUGE change in him.  He's still the same man I've always known, but he is less anxious about silly things, doesn't come home and go straight for a shot and a beer, and has far fewer sleeping problems and other related problems.  <br>  <br>  Your husband could possibly have a medical issue or some kind of depression and that is what leads him to a desire to drink every day.  Try talking to him or ask him if he's willing to talk to a doctor to see some different methods of learning to enjoy drinking in moderation.|`|AA11634525	 Beside consulting an AA place where professionals can help him, keep no alcohol drink at home. Refuse to bring drink in the house and you do not do it under any circumstance. Refuse to be the driver when you go out. Knowing that you will be the driver on the way back home is an open door to drinking. Do not be an enabler to make access to drinking an easy way.|`|p2AG6CnGaa	I wish I knew the answer.  I have the same situation.  Every night he's drunk.  He likes to start fights with me when he's drunk, then gets angry when I refuse to talk to him.  I'm at my wits end.|`|AA11534512	You could look into a support group for yourself.  |`|a37dc179b9a04772f24bb7711a8e0702aa	My suggestion may not be what you want to hear, but it is the truth. If you think that you can do anything to help him you are crazy. The truth is all you can change is yourself. If you are willing to be with this man dispite his addiction then be aware of the problems that will come from them. This is the only choice that you can make. The last person said something about Al-anon. This is a fine group, but what good can it do for you? Isn't he the one with the problem?|`|2DntUI3Haa	Decide NOW what you are willing to take.<br>  <br>  If you stay, you don't have a right to complain; you know what you're in for....and it isn't pretty.  If you have children, consider them.<br>  <br>  If you go, then give him 90 days to get clean and stay as long as he's clean.  <br>  <br>  PERIOD.  No negotiations, no option #3.  He is either going to drink, or he isn't.  If he isn't ready to choose the latter then you need to make YOUR decision:  stay and deal with it, or go.|`|H6Lc79EOaa	Maybe you could check out an Al-Anon meeting, they have experience with this.  Good luck.|`|2keIEMFUaa	Yeah!  Both of you go to AA meeting together|`|PhSKibKJaa	divorce them |`|c52cbd262f9bbe8b25813042e1adaf6caa	Ok, this is right up my alley so I'll answer.  I have been married for 4 years (2nd marriage).  Did not know this man was a drinker until after the wedding.  At first I thought nothing of it because I still had feelings for him, even tho alot of times when he was drunk he'd instigate an argument with me.  Not a good thing.  This has gone on for the entire marriage.  Sometimes he's a good drunk, sometimes a bad drunk.  For the past at least year, he's come home every night with a 12 pack and drinks the whole thing.  He says he is not an alcoholic.  I tell him he is.  He says he can stop any time he wants and claims he can go days without beer.  He does to prove his point, but ends up drinking again.  He does not go to bars either...he always is home.  Every blue moon he admits to his problem, tries to stop, and starts up again. It is a vicious cycle.  Get used to it.  You are in for the ride for the rest of your life.  Until he is ready to get help, which will probably be never, you will bear the brunt of it.  While he may be an ok drinker now, they get more violent.  I can attest to it and statistics prove so.  My husband has been violent with me at least 4 times in the 4 years, including our wedding night.  This is not a good thing.  I myself am trying to figure a way out of this mess.  I have 2 children from my last marriage.  My son hates my husband (#2) because of his drinking.  He gets mad because he says I don't drink so why am I married to someone who does.  So in the interrum, I will stay with this man until I can find a way out.  By the way, he knows I hate his drinking.  He does not care.  That is the nature of the beast.  He will not care how you feel and will not change to please you.  If his drinking gets worse, if he provokes arguments, or if he becomes violent, I suggest you find a way out.  I know I am trying.  There is nothing you can do.  He has to change...not you.  He has the disease.  Good luck.

If everything is down for you and you have no one to talk to a BFF will be there. Don't have a dollar in your pocket a BFF is there. Left stranded somewhere a BFF will find you and bring you back. If you done something horrible and no one wants to talk to you a BFF. A BFF will always be there no questions asked and asks for nothing for return except for friendship. Can't sleep at night a BFF is there to listen to your problems. Got yourself in a big Jam a BFF is there to bail you out or at least there to pick you back up. Left your lunch at home a BFF will share theirs. A BFF will forgive you even if you mess up and its your fought. Many friends come and go but a BFF always sticks around even if no else is...I hope thats enough to answer your question.|`|W1TbwHnOaa	Well, the fact that they would tell ANYONE that they just use you...I hate to say it, but it means they're not your best friends. They're not even friends. I'm lucky enought to know what having real friends is like, and a real friend would never say something like that about her friend to anyone. 
YSeZSI3laa	well if hes been your friend for about a year then you shouldn't be invisible. just try talking to him whats the worst that can happen..o right being rejected but how will you ever know what could have been if you don't give it a shot|`|HqFtaCnsaa	make your self noticeable, change somethings about you. Example haircut. Make yourself to the best of your ability, including looks & personality. Then if he notices you, you get him or You will end up with some other guy I guarentee. Even if your not attractive guys like neat and presentable girls. If you smell nice, and are a nice person with a good attitude. Life becomes easier, and thus would creating getting the guy of your dreams easier. :D|`|W1TbwHnOaa	If he's worth it, whether you're popular or not won't be an issue. It sounds corny, but it's true. And from what you've said, it seems like he is worth it, seeing as he doesn't care about your status enough to be friends with you. So just act as if he was any other boy, don't focus so much on him being popular. Don't let the popularity thing become a barrier in your head keeping you from doing anything.|`|BlxewCkkaa	ok i can tell u is to pull him aside and tell him how u fell about him maybe he just don't see you there and you should tell him that i really like you and i don't like to be invisible when you is around your popular friends so please we been friends long enough i want to have a Relationship you<br>  |`|k4HdeoANaa	i know how you feel,<br>  if he is your friend he will understand how you feel you might not be invisible to him he might think you popular 2 .<br>  But if you tell him about ur feelings and you say i like you<br>  and ask him out he might say yes,<br>  |`|9x9zKDBQaa	What a joke!

It's also really immature for you and your friend to do that just because you're jealous of her. Grow up. There's going to be a lot of people you will be jealous of in your life. But you can't hate them for that. Some people are just naturally like that. It sucks, but thats life, and its not like they can control it. I feel bad for that girl because she probably thinks your friend is actually friends with her. But no real friend would talk about her friend behind her back. That's just mean. How would you like it if you found out your friend had been talking about you behind your back with the other girl? Maybe if you actually TRIED to be this girl's friend, instead of her fake friend, you would have more success. Also, there are better reasons to be someone's friend than that they're popular or pretty. Like if they are nice or friendly for example. And maybe you're better off not being friends with a girl who you would just make you feel bad about yourself whenever you were around her. Also, it gets really tiresome trying to be friends with someone who just doesn't want to be friends back, and it's really just not worth it in the end. Trust me.
78d5f692c2b8bf3f8eeb89d114428d75aa	It all really depends on which kind of addiction are you talking about.<br>  <br>  Every addiction, has two reasons behind it. A completely biological reason (Our brain's Reward system) or a psychological reason (which is again in the end Biochemistry but that's irrelevant here).<br>  <br>  Most drugs, like salamangkero mentioned have the biological reason behind people getting addicted to them. One of the most toughest to get rid off addictions has to be cigarette smoking. Nicotine is a psychoactive chemical that releases certain enzymes in the liver and certain chemicals and hormones in the brain after crossing the Blood-brain barrier approximately within 7 seconds inhalation. This gives feelings of relaxation, calm, stimulation, alertness, better concentration and the lack of appetite and shot up metabolism makes people lose weight. The circuitry in our brain which regulates the "good" feelings, also known as the Reward system is affected by Nicotine and that's what makes it so addictive. This makes people unable to quit even after knowing the potential dangers of tobacco smoking, Nicotine in it's base form is far more dangerous than even Cocaine when it comes to toxicity.<br>  <br>  Almost all drugs have some or the other biological effect on our brain, especially the Reward system and this is exactly why Human Will power alone cannot curb addictions so easily. It's best to resist from the very start.<br>  <br>  There are many other kind of addictions like someone mentioned, gambling addiction or something some of the members here are addicted to, computers or the "environment" of the internet. Some researchers have led to the conclusion that along with gambling being a psychological disorder or mental illness rather than an addiction, it does have some biological effect on the brain which makes it an addiction similar to drug addiction due to the lower concentrations of Norepinephrine in the person. And now when it comes to computer addiction, it's mainly psychological.|`|UsOrHIL1aa	I wish I had the answer to that question, my dad is a full blown alcoholic and my mom is addicted to proscription pain pills. My dad is on the verge of death because of his long term abuse, yet, he won't stop.<br>    My mother has many health issues, but I don't know how much is due to "just life" and how much is due from years of abusing pain pills--she says the pain meds have not caused any damage--BS!<br>    By alrights, I should be addicted to something.<br>  <br>  I do smoke tho but I am not addicted--yeah, many people say it but I can honestly stop right this minute.I have stopped 3 times in the past---when I had a reason to stop, I was pregnant.

I think that much of the allure of the "chase" by the male is lost in this way when things are made too easy for them. A woman should try to maintain a certain aura of mystery to keep things exciting. |`|oSuUslbBaa	Nope, there are couples I know marry much later ie in their late 30s or 40s.

aDhZIhQcaa	She needs ro ask herself, whar is really going on deep inside of herself or her marriage to make her feel so insecure.  And yes, her behaviour is controlling.  She needs to lighten up.  Maybe her husband is cheating, what can she do about it?  The best thing to do in this situation is to evaluate why she is even with him if she is so insecure or his behaviour is making her insecure.  She needs to learn to love herself and like herself, by herself and for herself.  That way she can become secure and confident in the woman she is.  And her life and emotions wouldn't be based on what her husband is doing.|`|K8OjmMUAaa	No, it doesn't sound "controlling". It sounds to me like she has probably been thinking he's up to something for a while now. And the fact that he deviated from his usual routine probably did freak her out, if she already suspected that he was cheating on her. Thinking you're being cheated on can put you under a lot of stress, and she cracked under it. That's what it sounds like to me. Maybe she should have been cool with the coworker, but if she thinks he's up to no good, then she has every right to try to catch him.|`|3iNobwVraa	Yep.  Sounds par for the course, providing, of course that the course is a sh*thole filled with sandtraps, boobie traps (no pun intended) land mines, and... ... ....awww, come on!  Dangit, I can't think of what it's called....you know that sand that you can't get out of, and you die because you slowly sink down.  Flip!  Well, anyway, yeah that stuff!<br>  <br>  That course is horrid, and it's my new par.  Yeah.  Isn't that just tons of fun?!?  Tell her to stop it! Tell her that you see what you look for.  Knock it off before you destroy what was fine except for the snooping insanity!|`|AA11990465	Sounds like she has some serious issues and with behavior like that I wouldn't be surprised if she chases her husband away.

If he has never given her a reason to then yea that's bad.|`|88bDvyiwaa	People do get flat tyres all the time.|`|ygw1KFWSaa	Yes it sounds very controlling. She should lighten up a bit.|`|AFjehuZ5aa	Sounds like she needs long term treatment to me.

Is she strongly suspecting him of something?|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	Sure does sound like it, spouse on complete opposite shifts can be very suspicious, rightfully so, they are not getting much as it is and are wondering if the other may be getting it elsewhere.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	No, that's not controlling.

RC2aQBkgaa	A guy I didn't like asked me out, and although I just acted like nothing happened after that, the best way is say something along the lines of, "Your a great guy, but I really don't think we can be more than just friends..."<br>  Don't say something like Not right now or I don't want a relationship now because he would think you are interested but things aren't good right now or something, so he thinks he still has a chance. Just be truthful and honest. If he really likes you, he will understand.|`|WlFSaOpQaa	a guy asking to go to the prom with you is kinda like asking you out. so he is just trying to be nice to you so that you will go out with him. unless he is walking by your locker in a creepy way or something like that then he might be a creeper.|`|IYPfnYOLaa	Um, I think so.

gTfIQaHcaa	Wow, this sounds like it will be a dramatic wedding! <br>  Congratulations, I hope getting married goes well for you this time :)<br>  Since your theme is Dark Fantasy, you might want to consider a hairstyle that has a fairly elaborate appearance:<br>  <br>  (<a href="http://www.wwbeautystore.com/images/ad_hair_updo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.wwbeautystore.com/images/ad_h...</a> - you could change this one how you like)<br>  <br>  and you could use crimson or burgundy coloured flower(s) as an accent in your hair at the top or on the side of your head (next to the part of the hair that is pulled up):<br>  <br>  (<a href="http://hortiplex.gardenweb.com/plants/jour/p/75/gw1080375/58849993760020.jpeg" rel="nofollow">http://hortiplex.gardenweb.com/plants/jo...</a> - you'll be wanting an artificial flower though as they will never wilt or become less bright and colourful!)<br>  <br>  The other hairstyle I could recommend for this theme is to have lots and lots of wild curls piled up at the back of your head:<br>  <br>  (<a href="http://media.onsugar.com/files/upl0/0/0/02_2008/HelenaBon_Eamon_14482810_600.larger.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://media.onsugar.com/files/upl0/0/0/...</a><br>  like Helena Bonham-Carter in this picture, or similar)<br>  <br>  It would generally give the impression of a fantasy-like wild beauty, as this kind of hairstyle is often associated with elves and fairies of different kinds, hence - fantasy.<br>  <br>  The other option (a cheaper one by far and on that I am choosing to use to some extent) is to find a hairpiece or hairpieces from a place like ebay, or a local wig shop if there is one near you. The best ones are the ones that clip relatively invisibly into your hair. The one that I bought is this one:<br>  <br>  (<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com.au/RED-IRISH-AUBURN-33cm-Hairpiece-Hair-Piece-Ringlets_W0QQitemZ310118433930QQcmdZViewItemQQptZAU_Women_Accessories?_trksid=p3286.m20.l1116#ebayphotohosting" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com.au/RED-IRISH-AUBURN-...</a> - I bought this one and was very happy with it, so you may want to consider buying from the same seller)<br>  <br>  Depending on your hair colour, you are probably going to be able to find something to match your hair quite well. There are all the standard colours: brown (light and dark), blonde (light and dark), and red (this is slightly more difficult to get what you want in this colour but if you persevere you can usually find something)<br>  <br>  I really hope this helps!<br>  And don't worry about the time thing, I'm getting married for the first time this November 21st so we're on a similar time deadline, and you really do have plenty of time to organise yourself. Try not to stress too much!<br>  <br>  Ciaou and good luck!|`|0AShsMsoaa	why dont you just have a halloween party and leave it at that.|`|cJCLNtc1aa	first of all congratulation, here are some really good site<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h..." rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://haircomesthebride.com/photo1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://haircomesthebride.com/photo1.htm</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.liweddings.com/vendors/hair/" rel="nofollow">http://www.liweddings.com/vendors/hair/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tahoeweddinghair.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tahoeweddinghair.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://host.avissoftware.com/~tashavan/g..." rel="nofollow">http://host.avissoftware.com/~tashavan/g...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  this sit is the best....<br>  <a href="http://www.projectwedding.com/photo/brow..." rel="nofollow">http://www.projectwedding.com/photo/brow...</a><br>  <br>  i hope you find something you like good luck|`|DtUpcdXwaa	Wow .

If your dress has an accent around the neck or bust, you will probably want your hair up, or at least half up... if it is fairly plain up top or if you have really short hair, you can leave it down... thats all entirely up to you. Also, imagine yourself in your wedding pictures... how do you want them to look? What do you want the accent to be? Some brides don't have a lot of accent peices on their gown, so they add a large hair piece...You have to decide where you want the focal point to be. <br>  <br>  Also, if you are thinking an updo... do you want to be able to see your updo from the front as well? Or only from the side and back?<br>  <br>  I know these are a lot of questions - but in all honesty, only you can decide whats going to work best for you.<br>  <br>  When I was looking at wedding hairstyles, I gave up looking at wedding websites and magazines... I actually ended up finding my hairstyle in Vogue... so broaden your searches... <br>  <br>  I'm thinking something chic and classy... I think it would go well with the dark look. Something almost retro marilyn monroe type...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?ndsp=20&um=1&hl=en&rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-SearchBox&rlz=1I7ADBS_en&q=%22retro+updo%22&start=0&sa=N" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?ndsp=20&...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aipChC3haa	<a href="http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/photos/9344898/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/photo...</a> -the Red head, you can get a good shot of her in the last pic with her arms in the air<br>  she is GORGEOUS, and her hair is GORGEOUS BEYOND WORDS|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	This site has some interesting hairstyles.

NuUdCz0Laa	It depends on which body part we are wanting to wrap.  Since body parts vary in size, this is not a one size fit all question.  So when your husband comes home tonight, take him in the bedroom and strip him of his clothes, then take you cloth tape measure and check all the parts you wish to wrap.  That will save you the embarrassment of buying to much or to little ribbon.  To add to the measurement ordeal you may want to also take the measurements in the nude, but this will alter some of the measurements, so just make note of any body changes at that time.  Your so damn funny.|`|ICLekd2Vaa	i think i saw them in a collectables etc. catalog last xmas?? or was it another one?|`|5boLbxzdaa	Here's what you do....buy him one of the cars with the big red bows, then take the bow off the car and put it on him!|`|8j7zj9aKaa	Ask for help at a fabric store - they will hook you up.|`|uW1ZlA2Haa	Gotta go with JB . <br>  He is always thinking .

Siv0DwQKaa	I don't see anything wrong with that, you were just trying to be nice. Maybe she was just really young though using her mom's or dad's card at the atm though. If she was that young maybe she thought it was weird an older guy was talking to her. I don't know, but that was really nice that you offered some help. Don't give up you WILL find your someone special if you keep up your kindness. Good Luck  :-)|`|3QNPMVd5aa	wow, your over analyzing it...all she said was yeah, she had plans,...and she prob. had a bf, she wasnt being like a ***** or anything, you dont know her, she could have been a shy gurll!

Only time can tell. Nor am I sure whether he will show up tonight or not. But I think you should make today the ultimatum. If he doesn't show up tonight, call him, if he doesn't respond I think it's fair enough to end the relationship. If someone wants to change, they will commit themselves to do so. If they don't want to change, there's nothing in the world that will make them. So just wait for tonight and see, and you'll find out yourself.<br>  Gluck !
pFH3ZDftaa	i know how you feel its heartbreaking. but if it makes you  feel a little better think of it this way, if you were really crushed you wouldnt be alive right now would you? sorry if that was corny. umm what i do to make me feel better is listen to sad music. it seems like the song sounds worse then what really actually happened. i listen to whered you go by fort minor, wont go home without you by maroon five. if this doesnt help you, im sorry. i do the same as you every night. i cry my eyes out. im in love with my bst friend and he doesnt feel the same way. it sucks. i always think hes showing interest in me because hes very flirty, i just have to learn that he will never like me.. =/ ill never get over him though. i still believe theres hope and you should believe too. you never know what the future brings.|`|o1rzGR8kaa	I no like too|`|1L8ETufRaa	Get over her.<br>  Sounds horrible but you really do.<br>  Wouldn't you want somebody who loves you back,<br>  I know it's hard (been there done that) but I say<br>  'balls to her' and don't worry becuase your strong :]<br>  <br>  *hug* hehe :]<br>  ?
48f05733ad5213c40c6efa92aa9ee2c0aa	Coasty got it right.  Don't be in too much of a hurry to leave the "nest".<br>  <br>  I congratulate you on wanting to do it though.  Too many young people want to stay at home forever and let mommy and daddy take care of them.  So, that shows some real maturity on your part (or else, you parents drive you nuts, like mine did!).<br>  <br>  But, take Coasy's advice.  Save some money in case you need to have it in an emergency.  Also, when you finally do move out, don't cut the ties with your family entirely.  It's good to have a "Plan B" to fall back on, in the event that you suddenly can't afford to pay for rent or food or whatever.<br>  <br>  And one last thing.  Go to college.  NOTE!  That does not meat you have to graduate from college.  Graduating from college is a great thing and having a degree will get you places.  But, at the very very least, take some college classes.  That way, even if you never finish, when you go to apply for a job, you can at least check the box that reads "Some College".  "Some College" could mean you went for one semester and took basket weaving classes, or that you spent 3 1/2 years working on an engineering degree before you decided to drop-out and pursue your life's ambition of inventing a perpetual motion machine to solve the world's energy crises.  Prospective employers generally won't dig much further and ask for transcripts or anything.  Out of 3 jobs that I have had in my adult life, only one of them (the first one) asked to see my high school and college transcripts.|`|KMASS2Gmaa	First a little fatherly advice. Put off that move for as long as possible. Ask to see your family's budget for the last six months. Discount luxuries like eating out how much did your family spend each month on basics.<br>  IE Food, Utilities, Clothing, Transportation, Medical and Housing. When you have that figured out you have a total amount for your family.  How many in your family? If less than 5 divide by 2 if more divide by 3. This gives you the amount of AWWWH SH^^ money you need in the bank in savings. That is the minimum amount of cash for emergencies. Now then you need another account a checking. In that account you need almost as much as in savings.  This is the money you can spend to set up apartment, utilities, furniture (early American Garage Sale works wonderfully) and stock groceries. <br>  <br>  If you do not plan this move out then you are planning a move back in about a year. Been there and done that. You need a minimum of six months saving to live on in case of job loss due to any thing from sick to car wreck to a blooming Depression. This means you need to understand how banking works, including Checking accounts, bank fees. and last but not least DO NOT I repeat Do Not Get a Credit Card. They are rigged to get you deep in debt and the bank will always win.<br>  <br>  A. You have a place to live already how much per month is cost and cost to move in.<br>  B. College is much more expensive than you think. Email me and we can discuss other things in a less public Forum!|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Look I am 19, you want my advice worry about saving and find a steady job that is not cotton picking. You will need year round work. I have been through Georgia but I do not know what is available to you as I am not sure what region you are in. There is always work at telemarketing firms for example. For that the only skill you need is a voice. Cooks in restaurants are good and most of the time you get meals included free of charge. My advice is to live in the dorms and live home only on breaks.  Get a good job with your degree and you are golden. IDK if you want more advice from a college kid email me or whatever I will do what I can.

CWgJ7Yyxaa	Divorces are never fun or pleasant; and only you know what happened between you two.<br>  <br>  I don't think you were nice to her; but her asking to stay over was inappropiate, IMO. <br>  <br>  I have read some other answers you have written, and think you are a nice man. Have you considered going to therapy or counseling so you can deal with your feelings regarding your ex?<br>  <br>   I went through a divorce myself (he was an alcoholic) and am now happily remarried; but therapy did help me to see things in a different light. Maybe you should give it a try.<br>  <br>   We all need to vent; and sometimes we bury unpleasant or hurtful memories deep down...and they later on come out and make life hard for us. Being angry with our exes works for a while; but sooner or later we need to heal ourselves and let go of a lot of things that can poison us and make us bitter.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Congratulations on being a good dad.|`|htWw0OlCaa	I don't think that you are in the wrong for being so honest with her. You had your reason's for divorcing her. I think by you telling her to leave was the smartest thing you could have done. She is just trying to get you back and I guess by her thinking sleeping with you might do it. Like I said, you had your reasons for divorcing. Take good care of that little girl and be the best daddy to her you can be. Which Im very sure you are already doing that. Best wishes to you and your daughter.|`|j38mlGvZaa	So now I see where all of your animosity toward "gold-diggers" comes from.<br>  <br>  I can't stand people who constantly want their man to pay for them.

But i do have to say.. if she had your kid.. and was being a wife to you (whether you were married or not) .. you needed to be paying for everything..<br>  <br>  Being a mother and house keeper is a full time job.. and you as a father.. have the responsibility of taking care of the two of them. <br>  <br>  Some women WANT to work, and that is fine.. I have nothing against that.. But if she wanted to be home with your kid.. I don't see ANYTHING wrong with that..<br>  <br>  I do apologize if i don't have the full story though! <br>  <br>  ahha :) <br>  <br>  Good luck.. and it sounds like you're doing okay.. you don't want to lead her on. and i understand that!|`|bqkfu6Diaa	That's kind of wrong of you because it could turn her angry and influence her to cause problems with your child. I suggest simply saying no if you don't want to or just tap it for old times sake and kick her to the curb in the morning. As long as you and not fronting the bill for anything, what have you to lose?|`|uLnz3yoTaa	You were not wrong at all, you are a TRUE man. What you did was right because  you thought about your little girl first and how it all would affect her instead of a piece of @$$. You left your ex-wife for a reason and if you have the child that shows what good character you have. You were not wrong at all. Keep your head up and have good faith.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	No you were not wrong.  As a matter of fact, there is a good possibility that she was hoping you would get her pregnant again and remarry you.  After all, you said it, she really does not want to work to earn a living.  Well done for thinking with your brain and not your other head.|`|44QPXU5eaa	I think that you did the right thing by telling her how it is. She needs to know that there is nothing or will be nothing between you two.<br>  Good job for standing up for yourself.|`|mQhSxCpoaa	Sounds like you have the right.<br>  She shouldn't expect to sleep with you just because you have a kid together.

Good for you for being honest and letting her know exactly what's up.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Simply telling her you wanted her to leave probably would have sufficed. But it's not wrong to be honest.|`|uGN7Lmg0aa	From what I gather from your previous questions, she hasn't loved you for awhile (but it sounds like that was mutual), and she never wanted to lift a finger around the house or contribute anything.  Also the sex hasn't been there for a year.  So this seems like a rather unfocused attempt to get you to reconsider the divorce.<br>  <br>  It also sounds like you are still early into the divorce.<br>  <br>  Basically, the way you turned her down, you are burning bridges.  As such, especially with a pending custody battle over somebody you care very much about, I don't think it is necessarily the smart thing to do.  You are just trying to ensure that it is going to get vicious sooner rather than later.<br>  <br>  But since that's the way you honestly feel, I'm not going to call it the "wrong" thing either.  I don't think it's ever wrong to be honest.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Nope, she probably needed to hear the truth for once. Good for you, ex sex is ALWAYS a bad idea!|`|aEpPt9koaa	No your not wrong! I wish more men would be as honest as you instead of leading women on.|`|286ad294d7de5c688cda40ae6d7bcb95aa	No...Sounds like she needed to hear it.
iizKx4Bvaa	build it and I will becum a preferred customer. Tell her to put her fears aside and say holla to a nice long dolla.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	I think women generally try to distance themselves from anything exhibitionist about their sex lives.  If you are making bondage gear her friends will learn of it and think she must be freaky to want to be tied up and whipped etc.  People can be pretty ignorant and make a lot of assumptions.<br>  <br>  Basically she fears being ostracized as a pervert.<br>  <br>  At least, that's my guess.|`|4gZYucHMaa	You picked the wrong chick obviously.<br>  <br>  However you bring the money in a woman shouldn't complain (Dave: Take note hahah!)|`|wnb0EgaHaa	Well, you know your wife, and I'm guessing you're probably on the mark about her concerns.<br>  <br>  I can appreciate her hesitancy, but niche marketing is absolutely the ticket to high profit margins if you can find a demand and fill it.  Personally, I think you have hit on something with incredible potential - a possible goldmine if you manage it well.<br>  <br>  Here are my thoughts on managing it with her...<br>  Her concerns are valid because she's probably not going to just ditch her family, lol, and if they are stalwart vanilla types, they will likely be appalled.  <br>  You're gonna have to discuss it with her, and come up with ways to manage her concerns effectively if you hold any hope of gaining her  support for this endeavor.  <br>  I would suggest outlining a high level business plan, with several possible market and sales strategies.  <br>  Online sales, would, of course, give you the option to minimize and control the details that you share about your product line with her family and friends.  Vague references to an online custom furniture business will likely suffice.<br>  Catalog sales, specialty brochures, or trade shows would be another option.  Might you be interested in marketing wholesale to an established adult products or BDSM site, versus the public, for example?  <br>  <br>  The bottom line for you is that if you believe you have a viable product (I think you do.) and you feel it will bring you guys enough financial reward to pursue it, it will be much easier if she is working with you instead of fighting your every step.<br>  <br>  Show her that you are serious about the business side of it and why (give her numbers!), but put in options and alternatives that demonstrate your concern for her feelings.  Give her some choices that respect her privacy and boundaries, but don't back down from a really great idea. <br>  <br>  Good luck with this!  I think you will have a great outcome if you work it out and follow through.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	The adult porn industry is one of the richest industries to get involved into. You could be the "prop master" with your bondage furniture.<br>  <br>  If your wife can't get behind you and support you than send her home to those family members that disagree's with what you do.|`|286ad294d7de5c688cda40ae6d7bcb95aa	Honestly, I bet you could make a small fortune doing that.|`|AA12190953	You say in your question that you have a "feeling" it has to do with what her family thinks. Have you asked her what it is specifically she has a problem with?  Because until you fully understand her reason,  you cant know how best to put her at ease.<br>  At any rate I had a similar situation happen to me. Well not to me but.... My best friend was engaged to this guy and all i knew was that he built custom furniture. No big deal right?? Well one day she let it out of the bag that it was custom S&M stuff. Now im probably one of the least judgmental pple you'd ever meet. I just kept thinking, what r her kids going to think about that (when and if they had them). So i asked her  what her fiance would say to all the little second graders on career day when he had to go to the school and explain what he does for a living. Her reply was  that he would tell the kids he made custom furniture. Also she said  he could elaborate on how it was done and not the specific designs. That was as simple as it gets and quite true.<br>  Now with the economy as it is pple have to do what is necessary to put food on the table. But we both know that for you to be successful  you'll need your wife's support. Now there are a couple things to consider such as where you would be building it at home/shop. If at home does her family visit much? If they only come around occasionally you could consider having a "prop" piece, that is "normal" for her family to view. That is what my best friend did until he got a shop to work out of. Which i must add didnt take long at all he cant seem to build the stuff fast enough. And at least you'll know that you can support your family no matter what the economy is doing because unlike other things, gas, going out to eat etc.... pple will ALWAYS be having sex!! <br>  I hope this helps or gives you some different angles to look at.<br>  I wish you luck and prosperity.|`|af160a8fd6d84d201b88d510eaeb3ae3aa	A lot of people get embarrassed when the whole BDSM thing comes up. This is between you and your wife, but if it were me I wouldn't care. She could just tell her family you make custom furniture. The kink aspect wouldn't NEED to come up, would it?|`|FMfAcAGpaa	Yes, this could be a shocker for the in-laws.  I see her point.

Calmly ask the friend about the things you've heard he's been saying - about yourself and about your bf. Ask if he's got a problem with you and/or the relationship between you and your bf. In other words, get everything out in the open.<br>   It sounds like this "friend" is the jealous, manipulative type - but his tactics are sly and cowardly and they rely on people being naturally uncomfortable about confronting things head-on in a grown up, fearless way. Take control of the situation. Show both this childish little nerd AND your bf that you've nothing to fear from baseless malicious gossip and that you, at least, are adult enough to sit down with the 2 of them and iron out any problems that may exist.<br>  Fact is it sounds, on the face of it, like neither of these 2 worms are really worth the effort, but putting the matter straight one way or the other - and on YOUR own terms - could at least go some way toward restoring your self esteem. <br>  Of course, it may be that this snidey friend's poison has already sunk in too deep and your guy's not gonna call back. If that's the case then your (ex) bf's a spineless gullible twerp who is too easily led by others to be considered a man. The new friend's quite possibly gay and there may be some homosexual undertones in their relationship. Leave them to it. They deserve each other. <br>  You can do a lot better, hon.<br>  Good luck|`|jlpRbJpMaa	I think you need to have a serious talk with your boyfriend. It's his job to stick up for you, even if it is one of his friends. And if he doesn't want to take you seriously, then end it. You don't deserve that kind of treatment. If he can't be mature enough and man enough to tell his friend to cut it out, he's not worth your time. You definitely deserve better than that crap.<br>  ?<br>  Good luck girl!|`|mUzpoGWXaa	End it!<br>  I could kick his *** 4 you;]|`|9SSO454taa	i think your boyfriend knows this is getting to you so hes going to use this a weapon to get stuff he wants if you know what i mean ;]|`|AA10097424	Make your boyfriend believe that your the victim, hell protect ya|`|yN84JYcWaa	Tell your boyfriend to make his friend respect you or you walk.|`|hE3rB2ofaa	end it|`|a766661bb7dbb13127569416a3fd110eaa	doesnt make any sense
AA10519043	It is really hard to say goodbye, and it hurts bad. It's gotta be bad for him, too. He knows you like him and he has stayed with you. He may not have told you how he feels because it hurts him as well. It might be easier for him to just walk away without saying he likes you back.<br>  <br>  In a way, you are lucky. All too often we break-up after a fight or something bad happens. In this case you are fortunate that you only have good memories.<br>  <br>  Give it time. Make sure you exchange addresses to mail each other. Exchange phone numbers, remembering you don't need a cell phone to make/place a call.<br>  <br>  It will continue to hurt for a while, and years from you you will still recall when he left. It's a sad, but expected part of life.<br>  <br>  Feel better, let us know what happens.|`|16HqzRcfaa	tell him how you really feel. tell him for how long you've felt like this and that you really care for him. <br>  <br>  give him the biggest hug ever!!!!|`|HCzZClfvaa	AWww!! That's so sad! I'm Sorry. <br>  Hmmn you could hug him goodbye or as your last chance kiss him goodbye? <br>  Have you thought of giving him something as a goodbye pressie? Suppose if it's tomorrow it kind of too late. <br>  But I Think you should give him your home number and make him promise to call you ALL the time to keep in contact. It's no fun losing contact with your best friend.<br>  Good Luck!!|`|ZqDvQprCaa	the same thing happened to me! <br>  except we still email each other some times.<br>  its going to be hard but you have to say good bye even if it hurts!<br>  you just have to be strong!<br>  its not easy at first but youll get through it! <br>  hope i helped :)|`|KqTMOhAMaa	give him a letter or note that says GOODBYE
BWM7NIA0aa	If he is interested in you, you'll know.  He will be like a bee to honey.  Right now, guys are trying to find that someone who they think will fit their needs.  Not the best way to put it, yet you must realize that guys take longer to mature than you ladies.  You must share common interests and desires to move forward in a relationship.  Take baby steps and you will be OK.  Don't be rushed into anything.|`|y9N3DsKBaa	There is no way to tell.  There is a 50% divorce rate in this country. <br>  And unless you are in a mutually agreed upon  exclusive relationship. You don't have any right to demand that he not see other girls. Same goes for you and other boys. That is why it's called dating.

I mean, you have probably have your period (you're a 'woman' haha) and high school is the start of the dating field. You can learn what you like about relationships and the opposite sex before you get into a serious relationship later on.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Why not you let her meet the guy you like. I always meet my date's parents. My perspective is that if they are going to trust me with the most important thing in their lives I at least owe them a handshake. If he is a good guy and respectable then she will see him. Bring him over for dinner as a "friend" and see how that works out. Let her see him as you see him and see if that does anything|`|16HqzRcfaa	you might be old enough but are you mature enough??|`|xTSdNfzqaa	how old are you??|`|s7VCRYofaa	It's hard to give you a proper answer without knowing your age.  Yet, you can try to hang out with people in a group which will allow you to see the people you are interested in while still having the support of others around you.  This would also give your mom sometime to adjust to you being out of the house with friends and possible dates.|`|JZI8VqhRaa	I have the same problem but it is the girl that can't date, i believe that true love can't be found until you are at least 20 but i want to date to have a relationship, don't get your heart broken over him and don't be upset if you can't date, it is not like you will marry him, right?|`|tuendbBeaa	oh lordie, i ALWAYS hate saying this, but... maybe she's right. Ask her if he can come over for dinner at your house, or maybe if your parents can accompany you to the theatre / dance / whatever. This will show them that a) you respect the rules your parents set and b) that you are thinking about dating, and want to start off the safe way.|`|xv63biFiaa	well u should tell us how old u are. but that's ok, ill work with it.<br>  <br>  i don't think it would be that rebellious if you just didn't tell her.  Say you want to go to the movies with one of your girlfriends or something.  Wait until she understands and trusts you completely. Moms are tough to deal with, but you will live.  Good luck with this guy ;)<br>  <br>  ~oxox|`|kGAu6wcWaa	You don't really need to "date" at all.  You can do stuff at school to show your affection, and when you can show your mother after the guy visits that he is mature, she will probably allow you to date, seeing you as mature.<br>  <br>  please answer mine?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An.xSSk5dbjNczNhtASfph_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219172935AAtb2UO">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7oZv4KMhaa	first of how old are you?<br>  or make a powerpoint presentation for your mom|`|hahwsMd7aa	show her that u are mature and can take care of yourself|`|XHRPDDwFaa	First off how old are you? Then I can give you my honest opinion. But If your younger than 16 ill say that you can talk to this guy on the phone but if your older than that you'll able to date just make sure that you show your mom that your mature, and can control yourself around guys and that your a responsible adult who is proud to be you and be sure to wrap it up!|`|ufu5DlQ2aa	thats what happenewd exactlly to me group dates are fine cause its just a bunch of frirends and you can do what ever you wnat jut like when your alone and if he trys to go to far you girls will stophimm|`|xSFjArmXaa	well first of all, how old r u

RuxPKGSlaa	Yes. I had a huge crush on a man I worked with who was married. I never did anything about it though. A while later him and his wife split up, and he started coming on to me, (i think he knew I had a crush on him). But after he was available I started to realize that I really did not like him that much after all. He wasn't my type. Guess it was something about knowing I couldn't have him that made him more desirable or something.|`|s5N28gsDaa	"strangely" attracted? Can you elaborate?|`|AA10187219	Of course!

7cjqT33Baa	Get over the insecurity...I don't say that meanly, but just realistically.  Life is too short to spend a day of it insecure.  So what, you are 20 pounds heavier and so is he.  If you don't like it, change it...but don't let it define you.  Sexy is an attitude.  I've seen heavy women that completely rocked it.  Also, get more skills sexually because to someone that really enjoys sex and pleasure and knows what they are doing, 20 pounds isn't going to hold them back from a good time.|`|Pj81dRTAaa	Just be patient when you're working out, do it as a couple and look at it as QT rather than a chore. Don't be looking in the mirror or weighing yourself all the time, you would not see immediate results and get despondent. Eventually, it would become routine and overtime, you'll feel better and look better. FYI though, what other users are saying is also true, your hubby probably doesn't care about a mere 20 pounds. Good Luck!|`|LMIbr1aeaa	We both struggle hard to stay as sexy as possible for each other.  We both struggle to maintain our weight too!  Our metabolism is slowing down as we age into the future.

Together as one! I motivate her and she motivates me! Just like when we first met each other.  She was hot and I was hot at one time. GL|`|fMEypXDYaa	Well just look in the mirror and tell yourself that your sexy, work on getting your self-esteem back up, if you two are working on getting rid of the weight then every thing will work out, you just need to quit dwelling on the weight and focus on having good sex with him instead.|`|sx0PpjvAaa	Get out and walk together each day. it will bring you closer and help to shed the pounds.|`|dqMf8IeCaa	girl im thick in all the right spots. more pushin for the cushion.

Well good luck.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Realize that he's probably insecure about his body too.

It could just be that you have a natural fear of commitment. It could also be that you think you may like him but you don't really so the case may be that you just need to find the right person:)|`|7eTQLTuRaa	Maybe that's just you telling you your not interested and maybe you don't want to get hurt or just plain don't want to be in a relationship so your body is giving you an reason to say no.

If you need to impress him, to keep him around, then he's not worth it, I would say. Men generally like good food. You could invite him over and cook for him, eat together, and talk or rent a movie for after the meal, if that sounds better to you. If you don't want to cook you could order a pizza or something. |`|5xiX9IzEaa	You need to ask yourself what you're in it for. <br>  <br>  Are you in it to better him?<br>  Are you in it to get some?<br>  Are you in it to better yourself?<br>  <br>  When you can honestly answer why you have a boyfriend, then try to act accordingly. |`|Tax3tmKTaa	you guys need to hang out. hold hands, talk, kiss. yeah... its getting to know the other person more and better and sharing experiences. its a great thing to do.|`|f8898ef1c68facd9d40c20d2f8bbc0d7aa	Follow your heart.

There is no step by step manual. If you're worried about sexual things, talk to him about it. One thing that really helped me relax with my boyfriend was talking to him about how I'd never done anything and I was new to it. I started dating late-ish so I was kind of nervous. But he loved how he was my first real boyfriend! He liked it better that way. His experience was a little intimidating, but talking it all out made our relationship 100% stronger than if we had kept things to ourselves. Have fun though!  Congrats! |`|vja4ddNmaa	it dont matter what is going on, the question is always "now what" thats the question of my life and it has no intelligent answer. just have a good time and create good memories.

7zrsIK9Paa	Those guys either like you, or they were just joking around with the other people.<br>  Like i joke around with my friend a lot. If i bumped into him he would be like "WHATS YOUR PROBLEM?

Otherwise, I much prefer to take my time and avoid obstacles by taking a different route.<br>  <br>  By the way, WHY did jack feel the need to jump over the candlestick, and was it lit at the time?  Did someone DARE Jack, or was he just a weird jump over the candlestick sitting in the middle of the floor (who put the candlestick on the floor, anyway) type of guy?

jlpRbJpMaa	I think it is really sweet of you to think of her and her friends relationship. Maybe if she wants to hang out sometime, tell her to invite a friend, or maybe tell her to just have a girls day with her friends. She needs some girl time, even if she does have you. It is really good for you to acknowledge that she doesn't always have to hang out with you.<br>  As for her joking about cheating, etc, I suggest that you tell her how that really  hurts you, even if she is just joking. She needs to know what upsets you.<br>  Good luck. You seem like a really great guy. I hope thing go well for you.<br>  ?|`|fPMLO4CBaa	i was going through the same thing with my boyfriend actually, you see the first few weeks we were going out i lost touch with my friends but it wasn't cause of me or him it was just the fact that we got so attached to each other that us being together felt normal and it became a daily habit. i did miss my friends really often i still miss doing things with them  now but also my friends dont know what its like to have a boyfriend so its hard to explain to them that you cant always split yourself in half.. but it came to a point later on that they started compromising now i do things with them sometimes and bring him along or sometimes i just do things with them alone and he hangs out with his friends. it's going to come to a point where it would just be natural its 4 months and 2 weeks were going out now and my situation was like yours at 2 months :) not to worry it would slide by like nothing happened..<br>  <br>  and the joking part i do that too , and it hurts my boyfriend too but we tend to say it with love at times. we dont mean what we say we just like to see how you guys react to it lol.. i know its wierd but i guess thats what love is. <br>  <br>  :D<br>  hope i helped.|`|a2c8212cf5a52db9a0b799d0060c3037aa	try to be friends with her friends, then you can all hang out together.|`|hce2FY9Waa	No, you did not take her away from her friends, it was her choice to "dis" them after you started dating. Encourage her to continue to hang out with her friends, but she needs balance so she can spend some time with you also. If she jokes about cheating, that's not good. My past experiences, anybody who jokes about cheating usually ends up doing it. Be careful!|`|PRgf7M6zaa	If she doesn't see her friends as much as she used to its her fault not yours - unfortunately many people become so enveloped in relationships that they alienate  all their friends. Encourage her to hang out with them a little more often so she can't blame you if she loses them.<br>  And tell her to cut out the joking about other guys (or give her a taste of her own medicine, of course!)|`|4FR9d17Xaa	Give her a day with the girls while you spend a day with you friends. You both will appreciate it.|`|CKpPpK0saa	so basically your girlfriend wants to have some girl time with her girlfriends. thats not wrong at all. you should let her hang out with her a little and sometimes let her be with her friends. you also need to be with your friends too. remember its not your girlfriend 24/7! you have a life as well! maybe you could sometimes hang out with her when she is with her friends, or have some group gatherings with your friends and hers.<br>  <br>  about the cheating and not liking you, you siriously need to talk to her about this. if this is hurting you, you have to tell her its hurting you. if she doesnt understand, try to put her in your shoes (do not repeat what she does to you) just tell her "how would you feel if you were me?..."<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck! :D|`|VGhy6Wdxaa	just tell her your not stopping her from hanging out with her friends if she wants to she can that you dont care that you realize your not the only person in her life!!!<br>  if shes "joking" about cheating on you! if she really liked you and cared about you she would not "joke" about that! i would ask her about that and ask her to stop saying that cuz it does hurt you!|`|gr8HG5JJaa	Talk with her honestly. Try to find a solution together.|`|tzy4kOEraa	tell her how you feel about it
cKPsWFgxaa	I wouldn't because she would be taking you to the ground slap you across the face kick you in the nuts and you would be totaled|`|JC3kBl9saa	wait.<br>  what if the older sister likes you?
B0y9aO1Laa	If he flirts with you that's a good sign.  One example, if he stares at you from a distance and when you look back at him he looks away then he at least finds you attractive or likes you.<br>  <br>  The only way to really know if he likes you is if you just tell him you have a crush on him.  Tellin' someone you have a crush on them is a safer way to tell someone how you feel about them instead of tellin' them you like them or possibly in love with them.
Bnl7z8pBaa	We want to get married...to the right woman.  It's scary for us, especially these days.  The divorce rate is over 50%, and alimony is fairly standard, so the idea of marriage is terrifying as there is a 50/50 chance that we'll lose half of all our assets.  <br>  <br>  So why do we still get married?<br>  <br>  Easy.  Love.  When you love someone, there's nothing you're not willing to risk for that person.  Even a guy who hates the idea of marriage would gladly wed the woman of his dreams.|`|unVj43Xxaa	Guys want to get married but generally it's the guys in their 30's that are better marriage material because they've had time to grow up and decide what matters to them in life. I would never advise young people to get married because rarely are people ready. That's usually when you see guys that feel pressured to get married or hear them saying how they'd never marry but those same guys a lot times change their tune as they get older.|`|AA11795191	I doubt for sex, since its rare that people stay celibate till marriage these days.<br>  <br>  Probably societal pressure.

Some guys want it to do the right thing as they say, other just like to screw there way to the alter.|`|b6aRyiRbaa	perhaps he really loves her, and when he asked for her hand in marriage, he really only thought "we can be together forever." but when marriage came along, he thought, "that's a lot of commitment. i don't want to be tied down." i don't care what anyone says, but guys are just a fickle and moody as girls.|`|r1PGyXLfaa	"What are you talking about?!! Lots of guys want to get married and be married for the same reasons women do." yeah. When I got married He asked me, and we had already had sex so it wasn't about that.

lNlL0Ag2aa	You don't have to relate-able because for me, opposites attract rather then people having everything in common otherwise it will be to boring. Humor is just a plus but confidence is definitely in one of the most important things a woman needs to allure a guy.<br>  <br>  Reasons being that there are so many girls that don't have confidence that one girl with confidence will stick out from the rest and since we guys have so tiny of an attention span, a confident girl is the only way to let us know that she's actually attracted to us. Otherwise, a guy can not spot one girl from a hoard of reserved, quiet girls in the corner.|`|mLdlFhyqaa	I believe following the codes of gentlemanliness and ladylikeness go a long way.

nxHjSKTTaa	It's refreshing that your thinking about this. Most guys don't seem to get that far, no offense.  Well, if it really bothers you that she cooks your meat you could take over that. Just ask her if it bothers her. Relationships are all about give and take. I am sure you do things for her that you don't want to do and she does things for you that she doesn't always feel like doing that is part of a relationship. I think your incredibly sweet for being so concerned and thoughtful.|`|oTHGgowsaa	It's fine, I cook things for my girlfriend all the time, and I don't mind at all. Girls tend to not be very direct for whatever reason, so you should ask her if it's ok, or mix it up and take turns.|`|DeRRNCvnaa	I personally would try weaning her off of it. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong I respect Vegetarians, however, It is unhealthy.<br>  <br>  You do not get the right amount of protein and nutrients when you do not eat meat. <br>  <br>  Sure the animals get tortured or whatever but god DID NOT put animals on earth for us to stare at them all day, we were meant to eat them to get PROPER nutrition. <br>  <br>  I would ask her if she would try some fish, then chicken, turkey, pork and eventually steak. <br>  <br>  Other than that, MAKE YOUR OWN DARN MEAT!|`|EE9F6q3Jaa	it's not selfish if she's offering you to do it.<br>  i'm a vegetarian and i wouldn't mind cooking meat for my boyfriend.<br>  if you do feel bad, you could offer to cook for her.|`|A40jdi5Naa	awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww... lol yeah well maybe idk uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhd o it toghter..no umm yea i guess do it ur slef....|`|qaMrAspCaa	You better not offer to cook all your meat unless you are willing to do it for the rest of your life! What if you two get married? She will probably be the one that cooks the meals, so i'm sure you won't keep it up all the time.  If she loves you and doesn't mind cooking separate meals then let her do it.  But to be honest I wouldn't do it! I would just date other vegetarians if I were her. <br>  <br>  when I first met my husband he ONLY ate chicken, and i told him "if you plan on marrying me you better expand your dinner options or go hungry because there is no way I am eating chicken for the rest of my life and i'm not about to cook 2 meals every night!"  So he now eats everything (even sushi, which is really shocking)  good luck to you!|`|QODJNf1oaa	Well, it depends on why she is a vegetarian. Is it for health reasons, or because of religion/morality. If the latter is the reason, then you probably should take the intiative when you want meat to cook it yourself. She probably dreads everytime she cooks it but doesn't want to be seen as the girl who wont cook for her man.|`|eVLUIvDjaa	ask her to make a meal with vegetarian foods and meat with it.<br>  <br>  or just go out to eat one night when you want meat and just order different things.<br>  <br>  their really isn't much of a choice but your definitely not being selfish.|`|Dx9h0qkFaa	i dont think that youre being selfish, but you should offer to make dinner every now and then|`|9bQaSCngaa	selffish|`|aDZyh2jzaa	go grab a burger or prepare separate foods once a week.|`|q34vCB3Qaa	try offering to make dinner once in a while. or both of you can cook together|`|BL4OBp0eaa	you should make dinner every now in then regardless of what you two eat. its a nice gesture and gives her a break. since she makes you your food, make her her type of foods and then also your type. my sister is a vegetarian and i always make sure to make something she can eat, like meatless spaghetti sauce and little things like that. also, when i go food shopping, i grab her a box or two of veggie chicken patties. they are actually pretty good too! but she understands that its my personal choice to eat meat, as it is hers to not.<br>  <br>  try and surprise her, there are tons of food that arent "vegetarian" specifically, they are just already meatless (fruits, vegetables, pastas) what i would do is one of these days go to the supermarket, buy a veggie tray and some pasta and alfredo sauce, and make her a big dinner as an appreciation for all she does. it would be very cute and thoughtful! good luck|`|T1i65ar6aa	it is fine you need your needs and she needs hers you can't agree on everything. you are not causing any harm believe me.|`|lgM3xZkWaa	Maybe you should make the meat.She might not want to make meat of an animal that was killed for food.It might be painful for her to make you meat.I know humans need meat and the protein.And about the vegetarian meals,ask her what's her best.Then learn how to make those.She would really appreciate it.Oh and don't have her make you the steak because it may be painful for her because that is a bigger animal that was killed for food.Eat it when you're out with your buddies.|`|FGRtmHF4aa	Well it sounds like you two have a healthy relationship.  She accepts you eating meat and cooks it for you, and you respect her diet and enjoy her meals too.  You can cook things for yourself when you want them but make sure she is taken care of too.

Don't just expect her to do it. Offer to cook her something every once in a while.   You can make meatless spaghetti sauce for her, and well, meat-sauce for you. Find cool recipes online and in books.  She shouldn't feel like she's doing all the work.  besides, you might find a vegetarian meal you like!|`|cWh9z8Bjaa	Well I think you're both being considerate...it shouldn't be a big deal to her, but if it'd make you feel more comfortable in regard to her, just offer to cook the meat.

sCCjAKllaa	Some of them need that treatment, though. I agree that you should treat girls nicely, and not just look at them for sexual pleasure; but some of them aren't worthy of that.

Same old saying, theraphy....|`|AA11990465	I wanted to remain friends with my ex after the divorce and there were times I thought MAYBE we would be able to work it out, but I was wrong.

My guess is that the two of you will grow apart and there will be no reconciliation.|`|mMBzpldbaa	my partner's parents were always friends after the divorce, and his stepdad and father are best mates :) <br>  <br>  thing is, the mum and dad had a great deal of respect for each other but just couldn't live with each other. they were consistent about rules for my boyfriend and his sister and would call each other all the time to let each other know what was going on with the kids.<br>  <br>  they each have new partners now, but friendship after a divorce is easy with the right people and for the right reasons.
oNqxzfLQaa	a little secret ive learned recently. the term gold digger was designed by men to make females feel bad for actually searching for a man that was a good provider. so, we all need different things. we need to know that we have a man that can provide for us and men want a physically attractive wife. and yet, they arent made to feel bad for requiring that. the term gold digger, isnt in my vocab. id prefer to replace it with a smart woman. ;)<br>  <br>  and btw, the term "trophy wife" is extremely relative.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	Ha ha, I never thought about it that way.<br>  <br>  Another thought:  Don't men who marry trophy wives eventually just being married to gold diggers?  I mean, it takes a lot of money to keep a trophy wife looking good.|`|AA11988503	People make a joke out of marriage nowadays. It's shameful on both parties.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	It's no one else's business why a couple gets married.  I know a couple who got married for money.  So what?|`|286ad294d7de5c688cda40ae6d7bcb95aa	Not all men are looking for trophy wives...Some would rather have one they can trust.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Exactly!!!|`|RtkB46peaa	Most men aren't shallow pigs.  It's a stereotype.  Just like most women aren't gold diggers.  Besides, neither justifies the other.|`|EFlX4GYOaa	You can fall in love with a rich person just as easily as a poor person.|`|aEpPt9koaa	Yes it is shameful.  Who cares about what other men do or seek? You need to worry about you and stay true to yourself.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Yes It Is|`|HL8PEDFLaa	Nope. If men are going to superficial little boys, then women shouldn't get scrutinized for marrying for money. Then again I think both sides need to grow up and realize there's more to life than money or fake boobs.|`|asxqampCaa	Of course not.<br>  <br>  Stupid, insincere, shallow, superficial reptiles DESERVE EACH OTHER.|`|N28zLxtpaa	Nope.

sG8397Iuaa	Maybe  because you were doing her favors and favors are supposed to be a one sided thing that you don't expect anything in return for.<br>  she is probably ignoring you because she doesn't want to lead you on anymore and she doesn't like you like that. why would you tell ehr to **** off?  That would be pretty immature. moving on would probably be a good idea tho|`|nCP2QIWzaa	yeah, you were there every time she needed you so she now she expects that considers your help as matter-of-course, but she will contact you only if she needs something from you... you should move on because she is just taking advantage of you|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	This is what can happen when friendship turns (or tries to) to love.<br>  <br>  Woman can be very funny about this.  She obviously doesn`t want a romance with you.<br>  <br>  She has probably decided to cut all links to clear up the confusion.<br>  <br>  She thought your friendship and help  was purely platonic and altruistic.<br>  Forget her, and move on. You have done nothing wrong. It`s just one of those things.|`|kQf5TbUFaa	ignore her she doesn't need you obviously|`|Sn42Qw8qaa	I like how you said "should I just tell her to f*ck off and move on"<br>  <br>  yeah do that, cause now she knows you like her. If shes being so rude, don't help her, you're more of a tool than a friend. If she has no time for you, you shouldn't be putting forth the time and effort into her. <br>  <br>  So I think you should just tell her to f*ck off next time she calls for help.|`|zHJufZTcaa	Dude.. you are being used. Your only good enough for this chick when she needs something. (sounds like most of the women I know) Don't be so quick to jump when she asks. That is if you really like her.

Just because she is not saying doesn't mean that it is right.  I wonder why she gives into it.  Try to find an animal and do it.

If not, you need professional help fast.
UfOP3xtcaa	This happens to everyone. Just remember that she is not doing it on purpose it is just one of human nature acts. Just keep in mind that guys do not last forever and when she needs you then you should be a good friend and be there for her. You can always ask her and her man to  go out with you one night. That way you can be friends with her man that always helps maintain a friendship.|`|eeHgm5hGaa	yes my friend  has a boyfriend at school and she is always ignores us except for best friend unless we are in class and she was walking today and i decided well shes my freind and im sick of him and if he says something i'll cut him (kidding) and i said hey whatcha doin and she said walking and looking for stuff i said so what in particular are you looking for and her boy friend got an attitude and said she just did i wanted to slap him so hard.<br>  <br>  Can you help me??<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Apo0IMM_cnjH.2ie3QfT8HPsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219180951AAtnoQ8">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|CMUXo9wdaa	No, I don't.

LHJTrJreaa	Well... young teens usually say stuff to try and sound cool. Im 16 and i still do it hahaaa ;)<br>  <br>  But yeah anyway maybe hes just trying to sound cool. <br>  <br>  <br>  The person you should be asking is him.
TShsb3EXaa	Its a phase he'll grow out of it. <br>  <br>  I haven't heard of anything like this before but he will grow out of it.<br>  <br>  I know you like him and all so try not to feel annoyed by this, do not act like you like it either when he does call you 'mummy'. Some guys just try to act cute that is all to be honest or they really do not know what to say so they act like a weirdo as they can't really express themselves this happens with girls as well. He might even think its funny you know.<br>  <br>  Besides you can hold this to your advantage to an extent because if he ever makes fun of you for something with hopefully will not happen you can say 'Hey, I don't make fun of you calling every girl a female and mommy!'.

41e284c4ae4178dd7ffd2cdd7557871daa	She what my mother terms a "marrying ho". Instead of just have sex with different guys and not marrying; she marries them to justify her action of having sex with so many men.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	Yes, she most certainly is.  <br>  <br>  But I would even beg to use this as an example of one of the reasons why marriage really shouldn't exist in the first place other than as a religious formality.  Think about all the homosexual couples who love and honor and cherish each other and want to make their commitments legal and final, but are not allowed to.  Yet people all over this country are allowed to take their right to marriage and proverbially eff it in the a** as many times as they want.  Disgusting.<br>  <br>  Either let ALL marry and do what they want or get rid of this now pointless religious symbol of marriage.|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	Wow that is so sad. It is hard to say someone will even get married once for love there is no way she married for love it was a game to her to see how many times she could marry. She is a mockery of marriage for sure.|`|AA11996507	She and many others out there.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	I would say yes, especially since she admits at least one of the marriages was a publicity stunt.<br>  <br>  otherwise it sounds like everytime she had an "itch" instead of scratching or shacking up, she got married.|`|l43NSgHyaa	No, she's making a mockery of herself.   The institution of marriage can't really be compromised by one person, who obviously, has issues with relationships, self-esteem and commitment.

AxSX61eoaa	If you have so many friends that are girls why don't you ask one of them.|`|6kAtYLAdaa	you gotta go out more... clubs, bowling etc. etc. so ya just get out more and be brave :)|`|1IZFvA45aa	you can't make it your goal to get a girlfriend.  you have to talk to people & when the right one comes along, you'll know & you should ask her out.<br>  <br>  don't ask a girl out just to go out or say you have a girlfriend.|`|6M6XhKDKaa	try ebay|`|rZ7ft6YAaa	i would say wait for a girl to come to you. works for me :D

2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	It only ruins your relationships if you allow it to. Someone who has moved on is not your "true" love - the one who wants to be with you is. You have to stop living in the past.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	You always love your first in a special way, it never ends.You need to put things in perspective, thats why you feel confused. Enter the time of the present, who can and is making you happy?|`|fYv0dtUFaa	Not at all.  I was with my "first love" for 9 years.  We broke up almost a year ago I am now with someone who I love more than I ever thought possible
ODosyM8zaa	Hi! Me again! If the two of you are in love and you are marrying for the right reasons then by all means GO AHEAD! My sister got married when she was 16 (with parental consent of course) and has been with her dear husband for over 6 years now! Good luck and congrats!
H2bpuDsKaa	no, I don't.......to each their own.|`|uLnz3yoTaa	Partner is used for gay couples If you are gay then use it but if you are not I think that  you need to say husband and wife because that is something that  you take serious and if you were not ready to take the title on then you should  not get married.|`|45UTKuamaa	What the big deal call your selveses what you want we uee wife husband life partner love of my life. and some times I am the the donkeys posterior|`|pDrkcc6taa	Why do you prefer "partner" seems like a foolish nonsense question all around.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	I don't find it offensive but I prefer husband and wife. They show that you are married and not just shacked up together.|`|l1KlZrAOaa	It reminds me of "howdy partner".|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	sounds good if you are gay !  Thats the term they use|`|1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	I find it to be fine if you're gay.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	I don't really care either way. I don't get what the big deal is about calling your husband your husband unless you two are not yet married. It's not a huge deal and it's pretty weird that both sides are reacting this way. I've heard of the term life partner and to be honest the concept of that is stupid. I'm not trying to put down what you like to call it at all, but since you are asking.... I don't see the point in playing house for 50 years and it just seems to me that marriage is a step you take to officially join two lives together. I wouldn't call myself conservative, because my marriage is anything but traditional, however I don't see a point in just being "partners."|`|wia9SXCPaa	Yes, you chicken!<br>  <br>  Partner is for someone afraid to commit!|`|PuQyYMM8aa	Are you gay? I'd smack you for calling me your partner!|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Well, people will assume you're gay. My son is gay, and they are "partners".|`|VSVQHKwKaa	I personally don't care one way or the other.<br>  <br>  But you might.<br>  <br>  Partner is a non descript term. It implies ambiguity of duties, responsibilities, strengths, needs, temptations, and the entire marriage dynamic.<br>  <br>  These days, we're so absorbed in everything being "equal", "same", and "non offensive" that we've forgotten how life works.<br>  <br>  Do you think husbands are exactly the same as wives? Do you think the duties of a husband are identical to those of a wife? <br>  <br>  Do you think wives share the same motivations as husbands? Isn't marriage a continuing struggle to bring those needs and wants into line with each other?<br>  <br>  Are the two roles identical?<br>  <br>  It's a pleasing thought. But ultimately, it's not very honest.<br>  <br>  I don't know many husbands who send their wives downstairs with a handgun to face off against intruders.<br>  <br>  I don't know many wives who ask their husbands to negotiate with relatives during a family crisis.<br>  <br>  I'm sure people like this exist, but they're the exception; not the norm.<br>  <br>  The fact is....<br>  <br>  MEN AND WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT!<br>  <br>  We have different priorities. Different needs. Different goals. Different bodies. Different brains. Different behaviors.<br>  <br>  So why call each other partners? It denies that there is a diffence between the role of HUSBAND and the role of WIFE.<br>  <br>  Are we afraid of these roles? Do we fear that the role contains something we can't live up to?<br>  <br>  Perhaps we do. <br>  <br>  But is the solution to grow? Or is it to pretend these responsibilities don't exist. <br>  <br>  And how will it serve children? Are we supposed to believe that anything less than a mother's love and a father's discipline will satisfied little children?<br>  <br>  Then why are we trying to reword the roles that dictate appropriate child-rearing?<br>  <br>  Is it that we just don't like being told what to do? <br>  <br>  It's not fun, but it's determined by REALITY....not by other people. Children who feel loved, but have no discipline are disadvantaged. Likewise, perfectly disciplined children who do not feel loved are disadvantaged.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, I see many motivations for your decision, but none of them are wise ones. <br>  <br>  Husbands should be expected to work, fight, protect, provide, and grow for their familes.<br>  <br>  Wives should be expected to love, organize, motivate, and nurture their families.<br>  <br>  Anything less leads to disaster....as our society is quickly discovering.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but I disagree with your revision.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|RtkB46peaa	Offensive?  No.  Childish?  Yes.<br>  <br>  You think WE are trying to hold on to tradition?  You think it's sexist to use the terms husband and wife?   Do you not see the ridiculousness of your argument?  You remind me of the paranoid types who think that being called a woman is degrading, so they call themselves womyn.  Partner a non-sexist term?  No, it's a term for paranoid, self-proclaimed "victims".<br>  <br>  Do you ever choose your battles, or is everything a conflict to you?|`|asxqampCaa	In American culture, at least, that term has evolved into being solely for gay couples.<br>  <br>  Are you hinting at something here, sport-o?|`|OHfZFR31aa	When I hear partner, I immediately think they are not married|`|5DJzp6bMaa	That Term is For gay Couples

AA10197672	You both need to grow up and stop acting like kids! It is his fault here, he should've paid more attention to you and taken you out, better than that, he should've picked up the soup for you since you feel sick. This is something you need to  TALK To him about, instead of getting mad at him, and acting like kids going in to a room and being all quiet...|`|f9sL3WgQaa	What a childish situation you have going there for yourself.<br>  <br>  yes you are both wrong.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	It's all sound and fury, signifying nothing (to quote Shakespeare).  Don't let him pout - go out and get your own noodle soup, and ignore his tantrums.|`|7cjqT33Baa	If I was sick and still willing to go out to celebrate a new job and get the soup I was craving and my husband didn't want to, I'd leave his party pooper butt at home and go get my own soup.  <br>  How does he dictate what you are and aren't going to do?  <br>  Congratulations on your new job.<br>  Sounds like you guys could use an improvement in the communications deptartment.|`|VHA9qrVSaa	Well, if you were so sick and you shouldn't have wanted to go out. <br>  I don't know what the big deal is. You should have stayed with him and ate dinner.<br>  Yea, you were in the wrong.|`|aXYiOskmaa	the way he saw it, you were pouting cause you couldn't have your soup and got fed up. can't blame him.|`|osZ5zVEDaa	Sounds like he was hurt because he thought you were trying to eat away from him and so he got ticked and moved away from you. Typical of not talking to each other. If he had just asked you why you were sitting in there he may not have gotten ticked. Less passive aggresive bull and more talking!<br>  <br>  Besides all that if you wanted the noodles I say go get the noodle. You are a grown adult who can do what you want.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	You are overreacting and so is he.  Immaturity shows itself when a fight breaks out over something completely STUPID.  Grow up.  You're adults now.  And easy way to have made sure this didn't happen?  You should have called him at lunch and suggested Pho for dinner.  If you weren't able to make that plan at lunch, you should have just picked it up on your way home and that would have solved everything.  <br>  <br>  Whew!  This question makes me feel like I'm dealing with children.|`|vj2pWs9Maa	Simple lack of communication.  Maybe you should have called him earlier in the day to let him know your intentions.<br>  <br>  PS. Congratulations on the new job & I hope you feel better (& get some of that soup!)  :)|`|AA11706291	Get him to take you out tomorrow.<br>  <br>  Think you're being sensitive from being ill and he was in a mood from being hungry.|`|MVxFOI5naa	What would you do if there was a real problem-these little things need to be compromised on.|`|ObVYg0iRaa	that is something i would get mad at also....
xKgZAp1Oaa	It could mean a lot of things. He could have gotten nervous, he could have lost track of time and just forgot. Give it a little while, they usually come around and call eventually. Just sometimes a little later than they previously mentioned|`|TilqqjNMaa	It can mean that he is trying not to appear to anxious.<br>  Or that he chickened out.<br>  Or that he's not interested.<br>  Sometimes people say that because it's a nice way to end the conversation.|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	It probably means he's just not that into you. And I'm not trying to be funny but if you look at one of my questions.. the same thing happened to me. Just forget about him... even if he does eventually call you... tell him to kick rocks lol.|`|rZ7ft6YAaa	try watching that movie 'hes just not that into you' with jennifer aniston and scarlett johanson in it.<br>  <br>  that might answer your question and you get to see a decent movie in the process.<br>  <br>  if you havent the time to watch it he doesnt like you|`|OCTvfDsxaa	It depends. He could have just got busy. He could have lost your number by accident. Talk to him and see if there is a reason why he hasn't called. Maybe he has a valid reason.|`|fwKMZqwlaa	he will eventually call you.. it doesn't mean anything~<br>  he probly had something to do and forgot|`|AA11846750	He could just be busy.

Or maybe he changed his mind (sometimes that's a good thing.)|`|bc999a4e25e815eab170bb839ca3863eaa	he might be busy<br>  he might have forgotten<br>  and *gasp* he might not like you but,<br>  he DOES owe you alot for missing it|`|JHMK2g6taa	dont wait by the phone couse he prolble isent gonna call|`|SszvBQUvaa	If y'all are young, like in high school then he most likely did chicken out.|`|nVPTmmUgaa	probably he was chicken out or he is just think your preety and he has a record of cheating|`|zx0IQ1Fsaa	lol yes <br>  he probably likes u but is just tooooo scared to call|`|g5vQYWrzaa	That he is just not that into you.

So if you are going to take action that's how long you've got!|`|BdALIympaa	everytime you see him, have some kind of fatty food in your hand.<br>  that way over time..he'll think your just getting fat, and eventually dump you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  or get an abortion :)|`|n1RqtQ4Naa	i would say about 3 months <br>  depending on how big or skinny you are naturally<br>  but like 2 or 3 months is when you start to see alittle roundness in your belly|`|4nYPw5D3aa	till she gets curves (im a guy)
lWxUn0Xraa	its very clear you are confused but thats not what bothers me. although it is natural and expected to be unsure, what bothers me is that you don't seem to be concerned about her feelings. no one likes being led on and then cut off - which seems to be what you're doing unintentionally. i wouldn't see surprised if i saw a question from her on here asking "why does this guy act like he likes me one day, and then ignores me the next day?". if you saw that, how would you feel?<br>  i am by no means saying you're not allowed to be confused... what i am saying though is you should figure out what you want before you lead her on or dismiss her. if that means not flirting and keeping a tad of distance while you do that, then so be it. in the end you want to make sure she doesn't feel like you are yo-yoing with her.
aez3cIkvaa	He's not sure if he likes you more than a friend or not it sounds like.  If he wanted nothing to do with you then you wouldn't be hearing from him period.
2pxGPcxaaa	Yes. because im the guy she wanted to lose her virginity to. thats a very good feeling to have.|`|dCmSA6r2aa	don't give it up thinking they will treat you different from other girls hon it doesn't work that way for guys|`|tWOUr89uaa	Not really, because it does not really make any difference to me in my opinion. These days women fake virginity and one may not tell. So don't let that mislead you into thinking that you will have him for good. It might not be the case. good personality will save you trouble in any given situation and you must have faith to drive you.|`|aez3cIkvaa	Damn right.  She gave me the first pop!  I'd have a much stronger connection to her.  At least that's how it'd be for ME.  Sadly you will find a lot of guys that just want to bang you so you need to put them through the wringer before you even hint that you're going to give it up to them.|`|P3WfJeDjaa	You should ask the women if they were treated differently by the guys who took their virginity.

If you truly believe he meant the comment then move on and take your share.  You are entitled to half.

Either way good luck.|`|T3g9Rzkjaa	Girl You are worth more than you think It sounds like you have low self esteem  get some help with that.

Hell, a divorce just gives you the opportunity to pick which half you want!<br>  <br>  As far as the good sex comment ..... You should have told him that the mailman paid you the same compliment! Sometimes, you have to remind a person that you are there with them because you choose to be, not because you have to be.<br>  <br>  p.s. If you really think that there is some truth in what he said ....... take the half with the house in it.|`|GegQJNzSaa	That is abuse. If you were to divorce him, you would get half no matter what. And because you both decided to have you be a stay at home mother, He will have to pay for your divorce lawyer too. He may also be forced to py to re-educate you to be able to join the work force too! That said, I worked for 20 years on the Midnight shift. I was home for my kids,I slept while they were in school.

He sounds like I was when I was in middle school|`|BvLAcCLyaa	That was a ***** of a thing to say, probably hurt the poor dude.|`|mKULeVN4aa	i think he likes u<br>  cuz hes not like, shes not my GF<br>  i think he was trying to just avoid the question<br>  so he likes u pretty much.|`|LSCG8aGVaa	i htink he's just messin with you.|`|MUluaYE1aa	I would take it as if he just made a move so its time for you to make one back*|`|3V9Ab2Ptaa	your racist|`|i7LE8xziaa	hes playin with u|`|gYuJUyvvaa	It means you're stoopid|`|gLXzVbm8aa	he was just being funny
RhZaVwKkaa	Depends on the guy if you're dating. Depends on the woman if you're married.|`|FkJgd8o4aa	However long you want it to.|`|KJxwNfsaaa	well average time is definitly in minutes<br>  personally i think its all lies when they say they have sex for 2 hrs straight.<br>  but it just depends on the guys and how long they control there "jimmy"<br>  some guys will hold it in until the girl has her thing.|`|RJX1FYY0aa	0.5 seconds. <br>  Don't waste that valuable time.
aEpPt9koaa	I would do what Princess says but no matter his reaction leave it at that.  Never pressure a man into marriage, it will only push him away and I dont think you really want to marry someone that you had to convince into it anyway.|`|LCNAI6AOaa	Arrange a time so you can see one another in-person, wait until the time feels proper, and you are alone, and tell him everything that you've told us. Consider apologizing, if you do regret what you said. Ask for him to forgive you, and to move on forward together, with marriage in mind.<br>  <br>  Be brave. You HAVE to, or you will regret it forever.<br>  <br>  Put your own pride aside, and spill your heart.<br>  <br>  If he's the man you think him to be...trust me, he won't refuse.|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	Ask him for a tattoo with your names link together like two wedding bands entangled for life.  If he does not get the hint, then I think you may have to ask him to marry you.  Good Luck|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Ask him to give you a tattoo of an engagement ring on your ring finger.|`|pDrkcc6taa	Ask him and give him a ring, it will show him how much you love him and how SERIOUS you finally are!|`|51bTkU30aa	His jealousy is NOT going to change.  So, if it was over something small, just wait until something big comes along. . .<br>  I would wait on marriage until everything is right--does he want the same things as you--kids, house, etc., What are the reasons you want to marry him?  Be sure it is for love and NOTHING else.|`|K8tzxFQaaa	Tell him gently to ask again. If he kneels down to propose, kneel down with him. It's the most divine thing you could do for him. :]|`|vmVBwgFvaa	ask him if he remembers asking you to marry him and then say i would love to take you up on that if you are still asking. :) good luck!|`|4JrDGW7Taa	So what answer do you want? Marry him or not? Is he a good risk or not? Should I wait or not?<br>  <br>  May I suggest that you consider compatibility. How much are you alike. For, the more you are alike - and we're talking her about your interest, your lifestyle (the way you view life) and your spending habits, the more likely are you headed into a lasting relationship. Talk about this to him. Find out his preferences. For more detail on lifestyle and relationship check out my source below.|`|AXbdNdPzaa	one of two ways, either propose to him in a romantic way, or ask him if his proposal is still on the table.
5d94V16uaa	Be direct, Just say something like Hey i like you do you want to go out sometime?   The worst thing she can say is no.   I like it when a guy or gal asks me out like that, and that's the same way I ask guys and gals out on dates.|`|NW3vCOVoaa	whatever you do DONT do corny pick up lines. you want to snag a good girl? then just be really sweet. really treat them special. girls really like that. and if they dont like you, you'll know. if they dont seem to want to hug, laugh at your jokes, look you in the eyes, start a convo with you then shes either not interested or extremely shy. hope i helped !
kS1xOgxbaa	at first it will feel like ur crotch is pulsing a lot and then u will like a wave of intense pleasure. im guessing you have not had an orgasm because if it had happened, you would DEFINETLY know. It is kinda of like when a person scratches ur back lightly or touches like pets ur hair lightly and u get that fuzzy feeling up your spine. but instead of up your spine, you will feel it mostly in ur head and on your body and it will be like 50 times more intense. trust me, the first time i had an orgasm, i knew it right away, ul know when u have it|`|426a3dee7ed8c56e74b81f48767f2bbaaa	I know this will get a thumbs down but if you don't really know then you didn't and you should not be asking this question.|`|PCb44JoWaa	You will know!!!! It feels great. Its uncontollable feeling.|`|CzIaAnsraa	You'll feel an amazing amount of pleasure. Sheesh, what else?
PRgbVg1raa	be yourself around her, as if she one of your guy friends or you could look at other girls|`|GE1TT6rPaa	Well, you could always try the blunt approach- just ask her to a date, or if she feels the same way about you.<br>  <br>  About the awkwardness... there's nothing much you can do, just act and be yourself, and, though you still might be interested in her, the awkwardness might start to fade. Just don't try to not be yourself and act "cool". It almost always backfires. <br>  Good Luck.
Lc2pYDycaa	Well you gotta remember that Romeo&Juliet was not a true story but as for finding true love you might find it not know it, but until you can really experience a real relationship not just like holding hands and the occasional makeout for example, but when you are a little older and have been through more and know more then i belive you can =)|`|8a553a06ec63d3305f06ba0fe0b74456aa	During the time of Juliet women of her rank were usually marred by her age or within a few years. So it was still probably a teen form of love but about as close as she would have gotten to choosing someone she loved.|`|qDII8luraa	Anything is possible. But many teenagers throw love around like it's common vocabulary. Saying I love you is a very mature decision and there are plenty of mature 14 year olds out there.|`|cBb3YsOjaa	For sure, if you are lucky enough to find him. If you did, I am very very happy for you <3 <br>  ^^|`|tyNzkO0waa	I believe you can fall in love as a teenager. It is rare, but I think it can happen|`|QMRq8Cneaa	Yea, its possible, but RARE. Most young coupples eventually break up over time. Romeo and Juliet were one of a kind.|`|2nMkDyDqaa	I don't think so. But I am sure it has happened before.
Bv3Dm11paa	I have a frienemy... I call her my toxic friend because every time I see her I come away feeling worse off.<br>  <br>  She has this way of saying things about me that are derogatory but they come off as being perfectly normal! How does she do that!<br>  <br>  Also she is a total whore but no one seems to notice??<br>  <br>  I'll keep being nice to her though .. keep your frienemies close right!|`|Tf19RETiaa	aka the b*tch bestfriend, yea have one thats extremely jealous of me.<br>  currently in a big fight about something stupid. never want to talk to her again.
AA11795191	I know theres a song called "meet in the middle" by Diamond Rio...<br>  <br>  I start walking your way, you start walking mine. Well meet in the middle under that Ol Georgia Pine....|`|JDogbPg6aa	"meet me in the middle, oh won't you meet me in the penis vagina!"
sosYw7Z5aa	I would say sorry but no!  It is a or could be a trap, who knows, you are free, and stay that way, unless you really want to get back with her.|`|yhsi0sWzaa	she just wants some cock.
IzghUHbyaa	She likes someone else.. The Guy she likes doesn't like her or have she had a previous relationship with him.  Don't bother, move forward, if she likes you, she'll come clean with her feelings. Don't beg anyone to like you.|`|f17RMVa3aa	agreed with carrie.
qJK4alwQaa	not all guys like the same type. there are some preppy girls at my school who act like they own the universe. i really dont like that. i like the sweet, clumsy kind. the girl thats a dork but in a cute way. don't ever try to change yourself though, cuz every guy can agree they DONT LIKE a fake|`|4Cedy0Rfaa	every boy likes a different type, and ever guy will find the boy who likes her for her.|`|O6pgbGMhaa	I'm a good looking male. and I like girl that aren't total sluts but ... well wait. I do, if you don't put out , some other girl will and you'll be thrown off to the side eventually. I also like girls that have a sense of humor and don't cry to me about everything wrong in their life. So basically, be open-minded about sex and willing to have it, don't use guys as your emotional sponges (That's what your female friends are for) and you will find a good guy!|`|b99c02d2efcaf0924dc72f729d7ae118aa	All types. You can't just narrow it down to one type. Different strokes for different folks.|`|imY4dv4yaa	girls that are themselves|`|fb0e6ee443fc42488c552557d2231b78aa	girls|`|6kvsvFRMaa	WELL IT TOTTALY DEPENDS ON THE GUY..IF HES SPORTY-THEN THEY LIKE THEM BEING A LITTLE ATHLETIC. BUT IF THEY'RE NOT...BE GIRLY..ALWAYS WEAR SOMETHING CUTE.NO MATTER WHAT!FLIRT WITH HIM..LIKE TLK TO HIM!... U WELCOME NO PROBLEM...OH IT WORKED FOR ME!|`|L8uyv9xhaa	hot ones
39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	yes, they can.  because there is another layer of latex between your skin and hers, the sensitivity is reduced.  as a result there may be what you would call "less sexual pleasure".<br>  <br>  however, they do make thinner condoms to enhance the sensations.|`|g7uMKvEzaa	Yes, they do, not only by physically touching person to person in sensitive places, but they get awkward putting them on.<br>  <br>  I used birth control and it was great but as I got older we had to switch to condomn.s for health reasons (age on pill) ...It was not cool , we didn't realize how spoiled we were without them. It was a necessary evil and we used them until 2 yrs ago when I had a hysterectomy...YEAH ,,,, no we are back to none,,I would just deal with them if you aren't in love with the person or want kids...OR if you think either of you have or may have STD's  GOOD LUCK!<br>  No amt of pleasure is worth the risk if you are smart . But if you are both tested and ok and you don't mind the risk of getting her pregnant,HAVE A BALL!|`|rqFbNhAGaa	depends on the type. there's various different condoms on the market, some are designed for extra comfort and pleasure while others are just plain basic simple condoms.<br>  <br>  a good idea when using condoms is to use a lot of lubricant I can tell you it is very uncomfortable for a chick to engage a guy with a condom with no lube ouch.<br>  <br>  putting on a condom as part of foreplay to some is a turn on so it can increase the pleasure if shes turned on by it, depends on the individual.<br>  <br>  just remember be responsible only do the deed if you can deal with the consequences, condoms can break and if they do you can end up a dad.<br>  <br>  my tip only go for it if your ready to be a dad, I have seen many girls get pregnant because of broken condoms and left, guys assume that because they wear a condom girls can't get pregnant, when in reality they can!|`|NyBNA726aa	yess!<br>  :(<br>  <br>  I know you said not to comment on the STD thing, but even though it somewhat reduces pleasure...it's still very important to use one! <br>  It's sex; it's going to feel good no matter what! So might as well be protected :)|`|YTXoBgVsaa	It completely depends on what condom you use. Try a few different ones- some actually increase the pleasure! Lube is definately important especially if it is your first time.|`|NzsRVAPQaa	yeah they do!!!
vQ8NPLzLaa	i know how you feel, if you really like him try to get to know him although it might be extremely hard.<br>  it may seem difficult, but sometimes we have to face the facts and i think you should find someone else to be attracted to
vYoyGziFaa	It will be a painful reminder, so in that sense it is bad. You can't direct your dreams, usually.<br>  <br>  It is common to dream about all sorts of people; old loves, old friends, old relatives. Once, after a lecture on the Civil War in college, I dreamed about Robert E. Lee, although I never loved him, was never friends with him and am not related to him.
RJX1FYY0aa	Your in 8th grade. When your in college you should start worrying. <br>  They may feel intimidated by you. Most guys don't ask out girls they find prettier or smarter then other girls due to the fact they are afraid of rejection. They feel like they are inferior so they set their standards low. <br>  Just show guys that you won't reject them.|`|vTPyX497aa	Boys in your grade are extremely immature! Boys dont become really "mature" until they graduate from highschool. it's not weird that you have never had a bf, i mean if you REALLY want one you should probably put yourself out there a little, not sexually but maybe you should be doing the asking or flirting instead of the boy. At your age boys are very awkward and intimidated (especially if your pretty) and they wont be the first to ask you. So i think you should go for any guy you like and just make the first move and see what happens.<br>  Hope this helped|`|tjRuKlJaaa	ok this is totally normal...I'm in 8th grade too and I'm 14 and i've NEVER had a boyfriend. I have never kissed a boy either. it's not embarassing. guys have asked me out tho. it is completely normal and not having a boyfriend yet i good because you get to save it for that one special guy.|`|qzqEMB8Jaa	don't worry babe. u r enough young that i should not bother to u at the moment. what should bother u is finding the perfect guy to be ur bf.|`|4pANb6Epaa	ur eitehr ugly scary too pretty too sexy too smart or too mean for guys to ask u out<br>  its normal tho<br>  no offence by above commments|`|ZNRZM2gOaa	Guys can be intimidated by you being smart but all in what you have described. Everything is very normal. Maybe to normal for you to bare. Seriously, all in good time. <br>  <br>  Don't try to rush things or think that because things haven't moved along faster for you, that something is wrong because it isn't. <br>  <br>  The guy you know that like you... do you like any of them? <br>  <br>  Don't rush. Good things come to these who wait.|`|9Ee2pU2Laa	hey, you got nothing to worry about,<br>  <br>  just wait for one guy to come and take it from there, dont rush, you will only end up regretting it. <br>  <br>  i am in the same postion as you, although i have had offers but not chosen not to have a boyfriend atm because they all seem to be after one thing.<br>  <br>  hope it helps<br>  <br>  :)|`|988435e45ef6f3294ca0f6fa9b9a976daa	Theres nothing wrong with that...<br>  <br>  you are still really young|`|xIowgWL7aa	If you said that you were 25 and never had a boyfriend, I would think differently, but at 14, you have your entire life to have lots and lots of boyfriends and not having one at 14 does not mean that you are destined for a life of spinsterhood and 15 cats in a studio apartment.<br>  <br>  Do you have any guy friends? Anyone who you feel comfortable enough with to ask what other guys might think about you? And even it at your age, it is negative, then you don't need those guys. There will probably be more in the future who will like you for who you are.
98r3nCleaa	tell him about it , <br>  sya you should have a break for a while ,. <br>  whan it sinks in he`ll start to get worried to be alone , <br>  dont give him hand job , <br>  shave your ***** , and wait on the bed in the raw . <br>  <br>  worked for me ..|`|hqx5T6HEaa	Have you offered up anal?  That has an amazing impact.  Guys love that.|`|9maQMHXFaa	instagate|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	You want the truth? Sounds to me like it's time to either get couples' counseling or a new boyfriend. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|XuoT57Idaa	He doesn't believe in foreplay? He needs to be single and you need to  have more self-respect. Poor sex life=Poor relationship <br>  Maybe he is gay
eVLUIvDjaa	he is probably just really into you, so its definitely acceptable.|`|yo9TVOFPaa	He's not controlling....but in a way it sounds like he wants you to be free for a booty call.  I've had a guy do this, he was always making plans and if I was busy he'd bother me and phone and see if anything changed so I can hang out with him....<br>  it could be different though, but he sounds reeaaally eager to hangout with you..like he wants to hit it then quit it.  Sorry..|`|OLlPPJFqaa	well.....maybe he's just trying to be funny....or he's trying to see if you will feel bad and give in.......in my experience, i have just given in and then the attempts to get me to be with him all the time got worse.....not all men are the same....just reply with "no, i cant i told u im busy lol" or something....i dno......see what he says.....if anything, having you online asking this in the first place tells me your very smart and just want a second opinion....i think you know what the answer is :)|`|CvESLNnkaa	If it is only one to three mesages and just wanting to know if you can do somethin after your other plans it isn't controlling.  Now if he is trying to make you change plans or something like that then it would be controling.|`|dP08cZl5aa	its not controlling i think he just likes uu. but is trying to be cutee but actually end up beign anoyingg,make sure u dnt sayysoemthign like kinda mean or bursting out at him like OMG U NEED TO STOP or something becuase then he will get hurtt. just be likee oo sorry i cannt. or somethingg, like that|`|2GNFQPdmaa	It's not so much controlling as clingy. Controlling would be if he tried to make you cancel your plans, or if having other plans made him jealous or suspicious.|`|w6RMoMSXaa	i got the same problem, they can be so great but annoying later. realy u got to talk to them abought it. after the answer should be a lot more clear. depends on how they take the talk.|`|eFee5yYYaa	Acceptable :D|`|WNymHApTaa	Sounds very needy.|`|BYdXXt4Oaa	He seems kind of clingy. And this is not cool.|`|RpxKmUBUaa	I'd say its acceptable, because he doesn't continuously force the subject on you or anything....but if he does, then yeah, its controlling.|`|xccRugjHaa	Maybe neither.  It seems more like desperate, which is not acceptable.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	I wouldn't say it's controlling, but it is a little clingy. Hmm.. Honestly, he sounds a little too clingy, but that's just for my taste. I don't really think it's controlling, so if you think it's sweet then stick with him. If it were me though, I like a dominant man, not a clingy one.|`|jwURGwAHaa	This can be very creepy. It is controlling but at the same time sweet. You should just watch your self. If you get more than 15 texts than you should break-up. On the other hand it is really up to you.|`|mKULeVN4aa	its fine<br>  he just really wants to see u :]<br>  if he like<br>  forces u to change plans<br>  then ya he is.<br>  but asking to change ur plans in a sweet way is fine.|`|4RxE1Ad6aa	acceptable|`|X1TeqHcxaa	You can take it as flattering, for now.  It sounds like he's really into you and is just trying to make sure he doesn't have any serious competition going on.  It sounds sweet now, but be on the lookout later if it gets extremely annoying.<br>  <br>  I'd enjoy it, but a little keeping him hanging is a good thing for both of you.|`|xRFhWMFSaa	well, he is just desperate or obsessed about you.  He wants to hang with you all the time!  You should be happy!  Well, it can get annoying.  Tell him how you feel, but don't make it harsh or it will scare the poor guy away|`|AA10010935	You told him that you're busy, but you'll hang out with him the next day.     But he still texts wanting to see you anyway.   He sounds childish, insecure, and yes a little bit controlling.|`|8e172b6b03562dfb30dd48d18dae04baaa	Depends on how you feel when he does it.  Happy?  Pushed?  You know already if it is acceptable to you.|`|Zdj6wmaiaa	It sounds a little clingy, but not quite controlling.  Is he able to take "no" for an answer?|`|OB8KPPIQaa	well its not like hes forcing you to change your plans so i think its acceptable|`|rHnL4rYoaa	he just likes you and wants to see you it's not controlling|`|xPms3MKwaa	he just realllllllllllllly wants to hang with you..... <br>  <br>  idk if your  a guy or girl.. but this guy seems like he really wants ur attention.. maybe hes just bored and needs a close friend to hang with him. iddk.
mJKSybiVaa	I don't know what other may think of you because i cannot just tell by reading this. One thing for sure I always love to talk to nice girls because they don't complaint about anything i say or do wrong (may be thats your problem). You may be a shy and quiet girl, that may be the reason because when your girlfriends talk to guy, notice them how they (girls) flirt with guy or even talk. The only suggestion I can give you is to open up more to people and you still can be a nice person.|`|igkbUflbaa	Hmm...<br>  You could try being more assertive and flirty about your feelings for others. You could also do this to new people you've never met before; its likely that you would have been pigenholed by your group of friends or the people that know you as the nice girl. People tend to do that sort of thing.|`|5lfW4v45aa	They just don't that the nice girls can be very bad sometimes.  ;)|`|7vt21U1naa	Ahhh joke around with them. Flirt and show them an attitude not a bad one but a bad *** one you know? Guys love that. And act like you don't care about them if they like you or not. Let them come to you don't go after them. Just act tough let them know that they are not the only guys who wants to be with you..there are a whole bunch of other guys who wants to be with you.;]|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	I'd rather be known as the goody-goody then the school slut, wouldn't you? <br>  <br>  Maybe you should talk to other guys, or you could get a piercing somewhere... I want one!|`|aXKM4aQMaa	girl i feel the exact same way|`|5d1b54e3efed93f0e4984edefdd98aa7aa	I agree with the get other guy friends dude|`|OLlPPJFqaa	prance around half naked......its wrong and demoralizing though...but guys may see u in a different light once they see more legs and boobs....not in a GOOD different way, but the neanderthal way.....<br>  <br>  another thing you can do is just fake an interest in something they enjoy doing....ok THIS is wrong to do also, but then again, most guys dig a girl who's into South Park or likes his football team, for some stupid reason, they see her as a keeper lol <br>  <br>  also......just be yourself damnit lol This is the only answer out of the three that I recomend whole heartedly....eff those guys who don't find you as the "oooooo i'd hit that" type....be PROUD not to be that! those girls get hurt way worse sometimes....I mean, I get both the cute comments and the ooooooyeah comments, but guys are usually turned off because i am a prude when it comes to sex.<br>  just be YOU. dnt change a damn thing..|`|2GNFQPdmaa	get new guy friends.<br>  <br>  but seriously, flirt just a little bit and see if their opinions change. And if they're sex obsessed jackasses like some of the people here who answered you, maybe you do want new guy friends.|`|CZvFAuN4aa	Lmfao, at Super S's answer. xD<br>  Don't change yourself for anyone, but if you truly are a "rebel" underneath your "good girl" image, then just go along with that and see where it takes you.|`|ldAJ3Et8aa	Youre stuck with your face for the rest of your life. We all are. You can change it, tan, plastic surgery, etc. but its still that face, sorry.|`|91AMtKEraa	Dress hot and flirt with them and slap them and makeout with them baahahaha xD|`|8o7s9tynaa	They're probably afraid of you because you actually have a brain.|`|AA10349002	I wish I could meet someone like you.|`|MGp3asPTaa	i used to be that nice girl. so take my advice on this:<br>  <br>  1.) Let them see a new side of you they've never seen..<br>  For example, [not to be slutty] maybe flirt a little bit. tease them.<br>  make them laugh, also remember that guys LIKE rejection.<br>  so next time they ask for a pencil, play with that. <br>  2.) To keep your nice girl personality, yet take away the image<br>  you would have to step your game up. next time a guy gives you a hug, say something like, "wow you smell good"<br>  3.) Be daring, ASK HIM ON A DATE. you're pretty right? then why wouldn't he say yes. if you dont want to ask him the first time, maybe plan a double date or even just a day where you guys hang out. you can be with friends, be keep in mind you want alone time with them.<br>  4.) Dont completely change yourself, but you can mix and match your style. they like you for being sweet right? so show them you're not just sweet, you can be sexy and cool!<br>  5.) Remember being the nice girl isn't that bad, because nice girls get nice guys :]|`|AA11224144	make sure to stand up for yourself.  if someone does something that you don't like, tell them how you feel, don't just say nothing.  if you stand up for yourself, then people will realize that you're not just a nice girl.  make sure that people get to know your real personality.|`|6ah8cUsAaa	You can change it, tan, plastic surgery, etc. but its still that face, sorry.or get out of the friend zone, the next guy who says your so loveable, walk up to him and give him a huge kiss on the lips.|`|FL0S2tSCaa	get out of the friend zone, the next guy who says your so loveable, walk up to him and give him a huge kiss on the lips, and then say "Damn right I am" and walk away...<br>  <br>  Hehe|`|MtYKQS7Faa	Maybe they just think that you don't like any of them.. Thats the reason.. I usto be just like you.. But things will change eventually.. Just flirt around them try not to so nice.. But actually alot of boys like nice girls... I hope i helped.|`|tQXQS01waa	You can keep being nice, just start sucking their *****.  Then you'll be the slut.|`|NxwyCCDRaa	flirt with them, and make gestures towards the fact that you don't want to just be "friends"
8tqQXcp4aa	scream out get a room. LOL<br>  no but seriously that's just wrong, and uncomfortable.<br>  replace her vulgar clothing with turtle necks and over sized t-shirts lol|`|LKsl00CTaa	Only one option: Commit suicide.<br>  <br>  Unknown Identity.|`|eNlGfAPaaa	invite me to your house next time...|`|y1xPK3Txaa	Tell her to tone it down a bit....damn.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Tell your mom sometime,"You know mom, all my friends think your hot, and they think you are a **** because you dress and behave like one.I love you, but I am ashamed of you".<br>  If you can not say that to her, then write it down for her to read.She needs to hear it.

ydj487W2aa	I like a kind of shy-guy too. I talk to him more cause' im in some of his classes. I suggest you talk to him before you ask him out. If your in any of his classes, ask him if he needs help or for him to help you. Start a conversation with him. Maybe start with how or what he did for his weekend. If he says nothing just ask something else, maybe to do with homework, friends, school or teachers. Once you start developing a relationship then ask him out. Make sure you don't develop the relationship 'as-a-friend.' Keep it interesting, if you think you are developing a 'friendship' more then a 'relationship', maybe change what you talk about or catch his eye by doing something unexpected.

AA10752706	I have Friends that sometimes hang out with other people who smoke but when they hang out with me they tell me they always have so much fun with me. They just seem to hang out with their other friends when they want to get high and avoid their problems. Your pot smoking friends should realize that you are a fun girl. There are a lott of things you can do to have fun and maybe it's time you found a new activity (sport, music, anything that you enjoy) and you'll make new friends. Your other ones are the ones that don't seem mature. I have many good friends - some who smoke now and then and some who have never done a drug in their life. You just need to know who you are and try to keep the friends you want. Just don't let them pressure you into something your not into. Never ever. One of my friends who smokes every now and then told me she respects me for not smoking and giving into the pressure. And i don't care that some of the people she smokes with don't like me because i'm "not fun" (aka- i don't smoke) and my friend doesn't either. She defends me. And respects me. And she always says she has the most fun with me and thinks we'll be best friends in our granny years. <br>  <br>   !                                             !!!                                                !<br>  Basically what i'm saying is that it is true when they say be yourself, don't let anyone push you to do something you don't want to, and if they are really your friends they will respect you no matter what.<br>   !                                             !!!                                                !|`|KjkOT5rfaa	.do you have any pets hang out with them instead or play with barbies|`|3d2q4X5Taa	Well if your friend make you smoke than leave them.<br>  but maybe you can make your group 2 do more stuff.<br>  plus do you smoke pot? if you do hang out with group 1 but watch what you do?<br>  <br>  if you dont just hang with group 1 but if things get to much go to group 2
wXOGqZxJaa	ehh. thats kind of a tough one.<br>  i think it make me worry A LOT more about it.<br>  so not in that way...<br>  but seeing him like a risk-taker and kind of a dangerous side to him might seem more attractive.<br>  more spontaneous and daring.<br>  <br>  so overall... yea.

AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|27lHtnnVaa	U KNO WEN A PERSON LIKES YOU IS WEN THEY GIVE OUT  LITTLE HINTS...AND TRYING 2 SMOOTHE TALK YOU & ALSO BEAT AROUND THE BUSH WIT THANGS.KEEP ON GIVING YOU COMPLEMENTS EVERY  SECOND!!!!!

E4MKOIE9aa	i have the same problem like my ex and me were walking and i really like her so we talked and i just kissed her but she just stop and stared at me and gave me a hug and went to her house and my adivice is go to her and she likes so just make the move like i did and trust me it will come out good and remember defend her when her friends make fun of her and always talk to her or hang out and she will like u more that wat im doing right now and its working and trust me i try hard for her
4LSt76mgaa	Wow, that sounds like  a dilemma. First thing, find out if she really likes you (maybe talk to her friends again or even her if you've got the confidence). See if her friends know or could find out who she liked last year, if she liked anyone. More importantly, do you still like her after a year? Sounds like that would be based on weather or not she's "shallow." Think back to when you first began to like her, and what first attracted you to her. Was it her looks? Whatever it was, you would have to know her well enough to make a decision. My opinion is that you should go with what your heart says (I do realize that is a cliché, but it shouldn't steer you wrong). If you really like her, it is likely that over time she will begin to like you. Get to know her better, and if you really want to find out if she is shallow let her know you better as well.|`|nOezzy5caa	if she only like you because of your new look then maybe give her a chance and maybe she will get to like you for who u r
G3emC90haa	go buy yourself an icecream cone ;)
frj854Foaa	First of all i wuld need to no how old u are cuz im thirteen but anyways if hes like trying to get your attention, makes eye contact with u at random times (which means hes staring at you secretly) or hes being hella nice all of a sudden hes into you. Or he'll be trying to play hard to get. But if hes not and is coming to you play hard to get but not too much. And when a guy means by a little bit they mean they have feelings but they need to no u better.|`|RPdBmJ9Caa	Well guys act nonchalant about romance kinda brush it off to act masculine. Try not talking to him....make him start up conversations...but make sure you try this only over a max of 2 days or else he might loose interest in you. If a guy likes you he will come after you...like in football a linebacker goes after the running back.<br>  <br>  Secondly a little can be interpreted a few ways...he:<br>  A. likes you like opposite magnets (attracted to you in other words)<br>  B. Likes you like a sister<br>  C. Has intense feelings but doesnt want to say<br>  D. Doesnt like you but is being nice<br>  <br>  as any teacher will tell you if you dont know guess...b and c are the most logical answers!<br>  <br>  good luck i hope it's C|`|BKnCt1Bdaa	It depends on the guy. Some will be very outgoing and some will be shy. If he says he likes you a little he either wants you to try a little harder or it is exactly as he says, he notices you but not enough to go out of his way for. If he holds your gaze and smiles back though, then go for it.<br>  Good luck.|`|2bal1VqIaa	Do you notice him looking at you?

Get a grip of yourself.  If the guy doesnt talk to you, you have some relationship problems.  Either you talk to him and why he isnt talking.  Or your going to have to OMG break up with the guy that you this is so awesome but ignores you.  You really want to be with somebody that will not talk to you?  Relationships are based off of communication.  Otherwise how will you guys know what you are thinking or what's on your mind.  Just talk to him and you need to open him up.|`|Kd3GRiLyaa	are you high??
d4c9a4d52a9e77de4545721ac937c02faa	It's spelled "quiet" not "quite". Anyway, maybe he thinks being called quiet is an insult, I don't know, but he could be pissed off at something else in his life too, you never know.
eA817mGoaa	maybe this person was waiting and waiting for you to make a move, and you never did, so she got fed up and decided to not waste her time on you anymore. especially when you say on and off for a couple weeks.
CHF7VtElaa	i don't think its realistic to keep a long distance relationship at this age. i wouldn't worry about it too much. just let your ex know that you're with this guy and that he needs to get over it and your relationship has nothing  to do with him.|`|2OqA5Fi2aa	i think your dating two loo0o0o0o0osers.<br>  <br>  ummm..... your in california, and they are in mexico. <br>  get over it.<br>  <br>  amor de lejos, es de pendejos.
OsQkpljLaa	Just start out slow. Try sucking on your guys lower lip, my boyfriend loves it. As far as tounge goes, just try to avoid opening your mouth really wide, and kinda just let him take control with his tounge. Don't worry. You'll be fine. My boyfriend is the first guy i ever made out with, and it was okay, I mean you kinda learn as you go. Good luck!|`|deHI2i94aa	just go for it, build up your confidence by finding a guy that will always complement you, and take the compliments dont say nah not true.<br>  <br>  when you kiss, just do whatever feels comfortable with you. it just takes time and practice to get it perfect, so dont be nervous or embaressed. if its the right guy he should understand
2f6UATGOaa	He wants to lick your butt hole that's been covered in jelly or syrup.|`|Svek6aXEaa	He wants to screw ya
Tf19RETiaa	maybe he actually cares about you, and wants you to do good.
V4ONcH1Daa	Is he really cheating on you?<br>  And are you really still with him?<br>  Are you that lonely?<br>  Come on! Have some self respect!|`|fMEypXDYaa	Just kick him dead center of the "Y" and that will take his mind off any astrology signs for awhile.|`|RPdBmJ9Caa	Well If my Girlfriend was cheating on my i would get over her. MOVING ALONG is how most guys think. If one girl doesn't make them excited they MOVE ON so. you have choices..MOVE ON or TRY TO WIN HIM BACK. to win him back you have to find out what he thinks he didn't receive from the relationship. Better it, find out what this "new girl" isn't strong on, make yourself into a man jaw dropping machine and he'll want you...but so will other guys im sure :)<br>  <br>  the main thing is..enjoy your life!<br>  <br>  hope this helps!<br>  -Casey|`|EPIpgw2Gaa	IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WIHT THE HOROSCOPE ****|`|57LFRfqCaa	Dump him|`|c54RKDitaa	you should do me that will make things even!
FyhzmgRUaa	people are always going to talk. But since this is a guy spreading rumors that's not a very good look. I say you stand up to him.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	He is jealous and sounds miserable. That should be your satisfaction right there. You should ignore him. He is an ex for a reason. <br>  <br>  As far as your reputation, only immature people would beleive that. Your true friends is all that should matter.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	well from you profile it kinda looks like you are a ho,but you should tell people your ex should join the tiney weeney club.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Call him and tell him you'll have his butt busted for slander if he keeps it up. Then tell him you don't have a problem telling others he was such a shi**ty lay that you only did it a few times. Get him where it hurts, his ego.|`|ydPOlK3uaa	talk about him back or comfront him about and tell everyone he's lying<br>  whatever makes you happier|`|LKIsoYdgaa	rise above it and just ignore it.|`|7yUoLRDyaa	I mean in this case all you have to do is just let it ride. Even if he didnt spread rumors ppl will still find something to say. So you know what you did and so does he. I mean that just shows why you moved on from him in the first place. I HATE THOSE DUDES! He is just salty because you moved on (like you said) Girl forget him, you are going to find somebody thats right for you but honestly in this situation you cant do anything but DO YOU cause he done already said stuff, people that matter know that it isnt true! FORGER HIM! (but if you want revenge just lie on him lol)|`|FyP4QFJ1aa	Fire with Fire... I'm sure you could think of your fair share of ways to get back at him. Start crap about his Small unit(if you catch my drift) things of that nature to ruin his rep to shut him up might work. Or just the common ignore and persevere can work too and if the ppl close to you like friends are giving you crap about it.. they aren't very good ones. Sounds like he's a crude and immature jerk that your bf needs to have a serious talk with if all else fails.  Hope I helped a little :)|`|YwagvE5saa	***** slap his nasty face!!!!<br>  lol
CBa9G4j4aa	No it's not a good idea. It is okay if the friend finds out if she likes you but not asking out. It is more meaningful if you do it yourself.|`|wIKvnsb0aa	No, do it yourself. If you have your friend do it for you she may see you as immature, or silly. Face her is the best way.|`|Bnl7z8pBaa	No...but it wasn't necessarily the biggest mistake.  She just might not have been interested.<br>  <br>  Move on.  Find someone else for your own sake.|`|eVLUIvDjaa	NO<br>  <br>  girls like it when you do it yourself, and in person. trust me, it works.
hritHZZcaa	NO GIRL IS WORTH THAT! If she said no then move on, trust me if you "loved" her since 2nd grade you haven't. You just like her a lot, move on, try to like someone else.|`|r8owV9esaa	im so sorry babe.. it takes time but you will heal.. kisses|`|AA10731562	Ask Geoffrey!|`|hLozB0MUaa	oh my gosh sweetie, settle down, you will survive! do not kill yourself! she's only one girl and hun if she doesn't like you, that's her problem, and her loss, she doesn't deserve you! there are plenty of girls out there, and i guess you just picked the wrong one, it'll be ok...

You seem to have really low self worth.  No one, not even your crush since 2nd grade will be able to make you happy unless you are happy with yourself first.|`|y1xPK3Txaa	Don't worry about it brah, you'll find someone one day.<br>  <br>  Don't you think I hate that the girl I've liked since 1st grade (now in 9th grade) doesn't like me like I like her?<br>  <br>  I do, but I don't get down on myself.  Don't kill yourself, you have much more to live for than that.  You'd hurt so many people that care about you if you did, and for such a silly reason.<br>  <br>  You can choose to ignore my advice or whatever, but just let me let you know what I've went exactly what you're going through and I know how it feels, and it feels so much better to conquer it and get over it.|`|ZyBLhQntaa	OH! SAD! Don't kill yourself! I totall feel your pain! I'm sorry that the girl doesn't like you, but that doesn't mean you go kill yourself! We all have to go through break ups sooner or later. Its better sooner then never. I'm sorry that she said no. If your still mad a really grea way to relax is to lay flat on the floor with you palms of you hands facing the ceiling. Breath in and out. Pretend with ever breath you float up and down. Then concentrate on your toes till they feel relaxed. Then your feet and so on. Then imagine somewhere you really like and keep breathing in and out. It really helps. I do it alot before I sleep. I know love is hard. We all have to go through it sooner or later. Its pure torture, but its life. Try and move on. Its really hard, but just try. I know your probable dying right now. If it makes you feel any better your worth more to any other girl that comes along. You sound like an amazing person. I'd love to be your friend and help you. Be friends with the girl you like. Don't ignore her. Thats the worst thing to do. Try and relax and the most important thing in life. BE HAPPY!!!! :)|`|1uRUaSblaa	Rejections are part of life, buddy. You can try to date her out after some time again. Besides, there's so many lonely gals out there too...give yourself time to get over the rejection and move on if it is really impossible with her. She may not even be meant to be yours in the 1st place. There may be someone far better for you out there.Have time with your friends and get involved with activities to divert away this hurt in you.Trust me, time is a marvellous doc.for wounded hearts.:)|`|4m0Wu524aa	shes probably not the one. you will probably find another girl that loves you back but until then just have fun dont think about her and eventually she will walk out of your life and you will find another girl.<br>  <br>  i know im deep :)|`|eSDNSq4zaa	okay so if your pulling out your hair there is somthing wrong, thats self harm and can be categorized in many different disorders. good luck though and if your over exagurating then i think its just an efatuation and can be cured by moving on.|`|k4I9dG0Caa	listen to mike jones <br>  <br>  <br>  "BACK THEN HO'S DIDNT WANT ME, NOW IM HOT HO'S ALL ON ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"|`|NAvaa1Araa	Get a hold of yourself and move on!|`|of2sIYtPaa	this chick thinks ur ugly go try another one|`|CV2NPBMAaa	“Don’t jump for the quick fix.  Embrace the pain.”<br>  accept that failure and misery can only equal to success and happiness. <br>  you can change your life by cherishing this experience, cause if its a <br>  bad memory or a good memory its still a memory. the first time your heart<br>  got broken. im not asking you to move on. im telling you to accept it for what it is. <br>  hope this somehow helped :)|`|rRvoOPvzaa	Realize that it wasn't love, it was just infatuation. You're only in high school or middle school. Ask anyone who was a nerd if life gets better and i'll guarantee the answer is absolutely. I wasn't that cool in high school, i had a guy throw away a flower i sent him in middle school. It crushed me. But now i'm living a life i love, and i know i'm beautiful. I get hit on every day. I have a boyfriend I love, I have a job that pays the bills and i'm happy. Just wait. You're life will begin when others "popular" peoples lives go down the toilet. Be happy now because you have a future.|`|x3bkJHBZaa	Yes u can. Instead of throwing ur psp at the wall, u shld use the money to change ur closet (throw away ur nerd attire). Instead of u tearing 3 big chunks of hair, u shld go to the saloon to change ur look. Who knws ur crush will be the one gng after u. Even she not coming after u, u shld be urself and be proud that. Since u said u r now walking thru society, u will be able to meet some1 special in ur life soon|`|Bnl7z8pBaa	I think I already replied to another one of your queries.  If you're seriously contemplating suicide, please seek counseling.  Call the Samaritans if the urge is immediate.  Look into getting therapy in the long run so you are equipped with what you need to deal with life's curveballs.|`|wXOGqZxJaa	yeah, if this girl you're talking about read this... then she'd probly wanna kill herself.<br>  i dont wanna be mean.. but thinking about killing yourself over a girl that said no to you? i mean c'mon! <br>  theres so many other fish in the sea! do some more socializing.<br>  stop centering your life on this girl. its the worst mistake of your life! and tearing out your hair will make you less attractive.<br>  <br>  i hope everything works out. best of luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. dont kill yourself.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Get some counseling NOW. Your response to being turned down isn't normal but that doesn't mean you'll always be that way. You called her a "crush". You may have a crush on her but most people have dozens of crushes in their lives. Not all of them work out. Please, get some help.|`|PRgf7M6zaa	don't kill yourself. If we all felt the need to do that after being rejected there'd be no-one left - seriously! It happens to us all. The best thing you can do is try to get over her. find someone else.|`|JcV2nn4jaa	Dude...change your haristyle, your dress code, your demeanor, go to the gym,  whatever.  Start have confidence in yourself, and like the way you look, and i am sure girls will be falling for you.

gTslbP6Baa	well i usually smile allot or make funny jokes...invite him over your place to watch movies or something? and get to know each other better Then ask him if he still likes you ETC.
8qa0j0Ebaa	<br>  Listen, the only way to find out if a guy likes you, is simply by telling him that your willing to PUT OUT!<br>  <br>  It's so hard for guys to come up to girls and ask them if they'd like to, "Hop in bed." Because girls are all like, "Uh..no, ew" or "Ummm...I'm not sure." Blah blah blah.<br>  <br>  Just put out ladies, than you won't have to deal with the trouble of figuring out whether a guy likes you or not.<br>  <br>  Hey, if a girl doesn't wanna sleep with me whenever I want, than I WON'T LIKE HER!|`|XYm0YyHcaa	he so likes you. he's just flirting with other girls to see if you like him back ad to make you jealous and all that. don't even worry about it.|`|SEcUbBD8aa	He sounds like a proverbial flirt.  The only way to know if he likes you is to ask and honestly he probably will continue the flirting as it seems a part of his nature and if you're this insecure about it now it'll be worse if you're dating!|`|lVaFqtkhaa	messing with your head!<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkmtW_G8zBIrJaTMRbHbyh_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081109124521AAXhB4G">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|pJBtWbtnaa	he's just messing with u.he's not ready 2 date.he just wnts to flirt around but.4rom my experiences.he's just playing with yr head  |`|2acd2ddb3d8c55d6819a3ca10ff2d4bbaa	he's so messing with you.IF he doesnt wanna be seen with you in front of his frneds and ignores you then..hes just a loser..and whyd you wanna go out with someone like that..?|`|3Krv9nb1aa	well, from what I've experienced, as well as hearing from other people, it could be a 50/50 split here. On one hand, he could be playing with your head to see what you will do, and there's also the chance that he likes you, considering that you say he acts like your the only girl and he'd do anything for you when it's just you and him.<br>    On the other hand, though, he could be a jerk that likes to flirt around. it wouldn't surprise me one bit if he did that to ALL the girls he is ever with. So if you decide to ask him out or something like that, try not be shocked if he turns you down or stops hanging out with you if start dropping hints. But either way, good luck!|`|m4jIZ9Ggaa	Sounds dangerous to me.. lot like a player or whatever. To be honest, I would want someone to treat me like a queen if I am around a lot of ppl or not.

Plus you won't have your kids thinking its okay to do/sell drugs and get locked up.<br>  Get yourself and your family out of his druggy grasp!!!|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	You what let me tell you this <br>  1- I am tired of all the people that are using christianity a way to take craps from their husband or lovers <br>  being a christain does make it OK for you to be a matyr <br>  I am a Christian, as a Christian I am kind to people and will point finger nor talk bad behind someone back or intentionally hurt anyone <br>  but to stay and be a victim that is NEW <br>  and if you do then you are intentionally hurting your children whom God put in your care, God did not put this man in your care the devil did so time for him to move on and for you to take care of the your children <br>  after 9 years what make you think that he will change <br>  PLEASE USE ANY EXCUSE YOU WANT BUT DON'T USE CHRISTIANITY <br>  because the choices that you have made to stand by someone who over and over show that he doesn't give a darm about you or the children are not right and as a Chritian you are suppose to do the right thing|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	I think you should leave this guy because it sounds as though he is not going to change - why are you putting yourself through this- I understand that you love him but you need to do something for yourself too not wait around for him to come back into your life just to do it all over again. think about your children. is it a safe environment for them? he always thinks your cheating so yea maybe he already has and is taking it out on you. dont you think that someday it may get worse just by being with him...|`|lb6jBcDiaa	move on sweet heart<br>  itll be hard at first but you need to get out of there!<br>  how do you think your husband is setting an example for your kids?<br>  do you really want your kids thinking "wow dad goes to prison, that sounds like fun! i want to be jsut like him"<br>  NO!!<br>  find a better environment<br>  <br>  good luck and god bless|`|8o7s9tynaa	Stop being a martyr for someone that treats you like dirt. This man is being irresponsible and selfish. I'm not religious, but didn't Christ loathe irresponsibility and selfishness? Your job is to look after your children and yourself to the best of your ability and if he's not helping you do that then the time has come to part.|`|p1NFChftaa	Eff himm, wutta jerk.. You deserve alott better than that!|`|3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	What does being a christian have to do with staying married to a piece of crap like that? I highly doubt God would be angry at you for leaving a person like that. If you can't decide whats best for you then you need to do what is best for your child. A child needs a strong father figure. Not a drug user who refuses too change. <br>  <br>  I also think that you are afraid to take a chance. You accept being in a familiar situation even if it's a bad one rather then take a risk that could lead to a much better life. Life doesn't get better just because you hope it will. Life can change for the better and God will still love you, but you need to do your share and get yourself out of this very bad situation.|`|BRBiuYDOaa	ur husband is in prison, not u. he did the crime therefore he gotta do the time. I been thru the exact same thing.  I was with my ex beginning in 1997 to 2006. we have a 10 yr old son. who i had in 1998..my ex went to jail Oct. 1999 .my ex went to jail for possession. I worked and provided the best I could for my son. my ex was locked up for 4 years. I went to see him on my weekends off from work, spending my weekends on the damn highway. Sending him $ when I could, high *** phone bills, ect. I got tired of it. I had no income from him or his family to help. I stopped writing letters and visiting. I told him why. he got mad. so what i didnt care. he got out of work release in Jan. 2004. I got pregnant with our now 4 year old son a few months later. I kicked him to the curb July 2006 due to his old ways. u shouldnt  be doin time right along with him. I felt cheated as well. Those are years I cant get back and u need to get out while u can. Obviously he cant stay out of trouble just like my ex. u and ur lil ones arent that important to him cuz if u were then he would get sum act right and stay out of jail, get a job an keep it and help support u all. its called being a man! My ex accused me of cheating as well but I wasnt. I didnt have time for it with me working all the time and going to visit him. My ex had females sending him $ cuz I couldnt. Stop and think.. if u was locked up would he be there for u being 100% faithful? hell no he wouldnt. why else do u think he is accusing u of cheating? cuz he would do it if u was locked up! think baby, think! Always act like a lady but think like a man. do that and u will be just fine, always staying ahead of the game. he broke ur heart a long time ago. hell yes u need to move on, he gonna talk trash and try to make u fell guilty and fell bad. let him talk. he need to realize he the one in trouble and locked up, not u. u shouldnt feel bad cuz u didnt make him do what he did to go back to prison. he a jailbird now,thats what he knows. jail life. kick the depession, u aint got nothin to be depressed about. u live for u and ur lil ones. u and them is all that matters!!  yeah u a Christian and thats all fine and good but he shoulda put away childish things long ago if he really a man. thats what the Bible says. contact with the kids is all thats needed. U got a life so live it!|`|MX5GOUgDaa	Have you thought about asking him to seek addiction treatment? Best would be to wait until he serves his time and make it a condition for staying together. He needs to get help, your child cannot be around that...it is not healthy. After the drug counseling you need to do couples therapy or family therapy to work on things. It is indeed alot of years and very complicated. I think this would be the best way to go about things, especially because you mention you are not sure if he is ready to change...I wouldn't get him out of prison...worry about yourself and your child...don't get in more debt because you are enabling him. I wish you the best...|`|P63n2JENaa	"He always accuses me of cheating. Could this be a sign that maybe he has done so?" <br>  <br>  Yes, he has, but not in a way that you'd like to hear about, I'm sure. <br>  <br>  Being a christian, are you afraid God will condemn you for turning the other cheek? Stop it. If he abused you physically, would you use the fact that you are a christian to stay with him? Of course not. <br>  <br>  I think if you read over your question you'll know the answer.|`|mC6mrOYiaa	Make a list why you should stay with him and a list  with reasons to split. Do your kids witness the way he talks to you? It can have a bad affect on kids to see parents fighting. Sometimes you have to wait a few years down the line to see the affect taking place. And why should anybody have to put up with abuse because that's how I call it what he is doing to you . Maybe you could be both happier just being friends. Trust is a foundation in any relationship, have you got Trust in each other?
WKtakdsOaa	I got married at 20 and my husband was 19. Its fantastic and I love every minute. Getting married young is great cause you spend the rest of your life with the man of your dreams. Dont listen to anyone else.|`|0KXiwjDbaa	That depends on how mature you are.  There are a lot of good reasons to get married.  Being in love is at the top of the list.  Employers prefer people who are married because they are usually more reliable, plus you have the benefit of two incomes.  When you are ready to have children both parents will be under one roof.  If you all are faithful to each other you don’t have to worry about STDs.  <br>  <br>  Single people enjoy their freedom, but the reality is that they are lonely and try to compensate with one night stands and it doesn’t work.  Ask someone who is happily married and they will tell you that there is nothing better in the world than waking up in a house full of love and knowing that love is real and yours forever.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you talk to as many different married couples as you can before you tie the knot.  Make sure that you are prepared financially, that is, do you both handle your money in the same way?  What debts do you have?  Do you want kids and how are you going to raise them.  Be sure you’ve talked about chores, in-laws, religion, values, and politics.  Have you talked about sex?  How often and what is expected.  How are you going to handle the sex thing when you are pregnant?  No, I’m not joking, it will become an issue so try to prepare for as much of this stuff ahead of time as you can.|`|xmmX3JTRaa	Usually the couples that marry very fast get, divorce fast as well.<br>  <br>  You have to make sure that both of you want it, and both of you are ready for it. also make sure that you will be able to support your family - I mean have jobs etc.<br>  <br>  As I said, make sure that both of you want it.|`|7KhIn4HJaa	Nope not really.It depends on how mature both of you are .If both of them think it's not a bad idea it's ok cuz it truly can last in two's honesty and love.|`|o5jSID4Jaa	Got married at 20. Lots of people will say its too young. But only you really know if you're ready to be married or not! I've been married to my hubby for 5 years and we are very happy. But that's not to say its not hard work! You just have to be willing to make it work no matter how difficult it gets sometimes! Just do what you feel is right.|`|1936c4452418e5d1e53f841e56ce4d31aa	i got married when i was 20. I don't know if i would have if i didn't get pregnant tho. I do love my husband, but we has been threw some really hard times. I really don't know if we could have made it threw them if it wasn't for us having a son together. Tho im 27 now and he is 38, we have been married for almost 8 years. We both believe that we are soul mates, and we still make others sick at time b/c we are just that close. But honestly. I would have waited alot longer to marry him. But i think our son was brought into our life's b/c we were just meant to be together :)|`|4D9dwDeHaa	im 20 and im getting married next summer and i think its a great idea because you can't put an age on love.|`|7cjqT33Baa	I met my husband when I was 20 and he was just about to turn 20.  We are still together 15 years later.  I think it all depends on the individuals and their attitudes and values.  You can have a person more mature at 20 than another one is at 40.|`|n8lXItGraa	I got married at 19...bad idea.  Divorced now.

The relationship was only 2 months long - that's hardly enough time to be serious.  I think he's going to just move on and you should, too.|`|0AShsMsoaa	drop by his house every night about 10 pm and knock on his door.  call him every hour.  drive by his house all day long. you could also have a heart to heart with his wife, about how she needs him to be free, and, you could boil a bunny on her stove.   <br>  <br>  or, you could get off the drugs and stop being a crazy stalker.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Give him space and write him a letter, something heart-felt that he can read over and over and think about.  If you show up at his door, it won't be good.  Emotions are running too high, and the letter will give him a chance to calm down and think everything through.
AwXDBoASaa	try to be flirty in a way that is not that noticeable so it doesnt seem like your flirting in an annoying way, but you are indeed being flirty. ask questions, compliment them, laugh kinda loud, and find a way to touch them without being all over them too much.|`|z9k2TUcbaa	Flirting is for FUN purposes...don't flirt too much...or else it'll seem bad.

You will have a great aura about you.|`|NSwkUNb1aa	eye contact, brushing up against him, might want to try telling him you like him (IDK the whole story there)... just try not to do anything too "slutty"
GUUa1s6Laa	You were absolutely not being mean to him. You did the right thing, not leading him on and letting him know your intentions up front. So you did well! <br>  However, it obviously took him a lot of courage to ask you to hang out, You could redeem your rejection by going to the dance with him (making sure he still understands that it is just as friends)<br>  Very mature though I am proud of you.|`|RPIVHQX5aa	hahahahaha<br>  <br>  oh man, thats not nice<br>  <br>  Not nice, coulda at least gave him a chance.
uvcqPfuNaa	Well either way make sure that the card itself is personal and relates to your relationship. If you are bad at making cards then go buy one. Although she will always value something that you made yourself more than one you put two dollars down for. Don't think it has to be all serious. Go to faceinhole.com and you can use the image you create for a card. It doesn't have to be all lovey dovey. It can be humorous but then include cute words and compliments in your writing.|`|whoHoGjuaa	BE CREATIVE ,, ! <3333.. don't but any thing ,! you make the card it's so sweet and CUTE .. it'll mean something to her .!

She a teacher? sounds like she a stupid one for a start!|`|sAuB8vLCaa	No, he can not throw her out, only the judge can do that.|`|iD4ejChZaa	nobody can throw her out if her name is on it.|`|71b5d9acd0e084b723a6c805c9cfd85daa	That's a very sad story.<br>  <br>  The police can't put someone out if they are both on the mortgage.  It's not a police matter - it's a civil matter.<br>  <br>  Sometimes when someone wants to get the upper hand in a relationship like that, they will try to strong arm them by saying things like that.<br>  <br>  Tell your aunt to relax and get a lawyer.|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Sounds bad.She abused his finances and squandered them away instead of being responsible with them.I could understand why he is upset.They both need counseling though for the kid's sake.Hope it isn't too late.|`|8o7s9tynaa	Sounds doomed to me. Can't have been pleasant for your uncle to come home after risking his life for months to find he had nothing to show for it. Poor guy.|`|qAR26vRFaa	It sounds like a serious threat to me.  Especially considering the fact that he may be suffering from some form of depression.  Your aunt should seek the advice of a mental health professional.|`|hvcjyEmDaa	Sounds like a worse threat then pack your bags. If I were she, I'd take the kids and leave. Who knows what he meant? Sounds like he intends violence. Why else would the police be coming by the weekend? It's too bad she blew all that money. It's too bad he's not working. Still, if he threatened her, she should get the heck away from him and be sure she stays safe.
M85hL2eCaa	hey maybe h does. maybe he was just waiting for you to make a move and when u didnt he probably thought u didnt like him. y dont u talk to him and say like "ok do u like me or something cuz u stare at me all the time and wen u and ur girlfriend were broke up u flirted with me so whats the deal?" say something like that or if u like him flirt with him who knows maybe he will flirt back<br>  <br>  <br>  hopw that helps.......

Maybe wait a couple of days and try asking her again. There's just 1 thing I don't understand. Y do girls have to be so damn beautiful??? LOL
e0Yi7RCtaa	Yeah he probably likes you. <br>  <br>  Or maybe he's leading you on... (sorry don't know the guy, but I do know that guys can be very deceitful, being one, i know many deceitful jackasses)<br>  <br>  Seeing as he's making both eye and body contact, there's a strong chance that he likes you. Good luck :D|`|qJK4alwQaa	never fall too fast. you could get hurt. but it sounds like he does. talk on the phone, Y! messenger, myspace, hang out at his place, then ask "so hey ________ my friend ________ said you liked me. is this true?" good luck girl|`|y16e3fnkaa	Your in the clear he certainly likes you|`|39Dl6e2maa	he hates you|`|hQ7y7sQZaa	well duh! he totally like you.mayb if ur not sure drop some hints to him tht you like him and then see what happens. but as it sounds he totally likes you!  good luck girlie!|`|AA12297189	Yep.

After my first kiss i questioned myself this, 'Did i really just make out with that sexy beast?' Trust me it's the best thing in the world. You will enjoy it. Good luck bro!! You'll nail it!

umrXBkeMaa	(Is this the B&G handbag girl?)<br>  <br>  Seriously, she's got problems.  The constant grip on him is a definite sign of insecurity, as is her bragging about what she expects and what she wants.  All of it is her way of expressing real embedded fear that she won't get it or that she'll lose it all.  Her boyfriend probably bought her those things as a defensive measure, not out of love.  A girl like that will easily get upset if she doesn't CONSTANTLY get reassurance that she will get what she wants.  She is the "high maintenance" type, and her boyfriend is really going to have his hands full with her.<br>  <br>  She may be an old friend, but you're right, she has become very petty.  Her smugness is a wall that she puts up out of fear.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend's gift came from the heart.  I still have some gifts that I got like that in my keepsake box, because they are so precious.<br>  <br>  But I'm confused.  Is this the same boyfriend who said you have to "earn" his affection in another question?  (That comment still bothers me, but maybe you misunderstood it.  Talk to him about it.)  Maybe he really just meant he can't afford to give you more yet, and HE'S the one who needs to earn more so he can give you the things that you want.<br>  <br>  The one thing you DON'T want to do is to aspire to be more like your friend.  She has issues.  The fact that you picked up on them means that you don't.  That's a great thing.  But don't put the same expectations on your boyfriend either or you'll be sending confusing messages.

GF1PEO2Xaa	One, she doesn't like the way you look minus clothes<br>  or two, she's feeling so good, that she's trying not to let any of it out, because then it might go away?
kknSPYxKaa	You should totally tell him how you feel.
s0qrPl5saa	Maybe telling the teachers that he is adversely affecting your work would encourage them to stop putting him in your group? Aside from that, I think the best way to not be let down would be to do all the work yourself. <br>  <br>  Can't rely on anyone but yourself, sadly :)
8mR3Kchnaa	aww thats so sweet i wish my bf........lol naah its normal nt weird at all
AxSX61eoaa	Touch him. make out with him. Let him touch you. Basically anything you can think of will do the trick.|`|MqPUWdXhaa	You're asking how to turn on a teenage male? That's the dumbest question ever, but really easy to answer. Take off your shirt, or pants, or just about anything else. You could probably get away with "Wanna ____" (fill in the blank with just about anything slightly sexual)
abb886581ffcf2d8bf185b206f80f441aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  My opinion on this would be completely maturity level of the person.<br>  <br>  Firstly, Understanding Incest. You mentioned about this lady who had been abused by her father and siblings. This will fall under incest abuse and rape victim. At teenage, it is very common for a men to be sexually attracted to their sister or mother, hence they are the only access. Most men don't talk about it and suppress their feeling. The rest take it to next level, of which certain times the women share the same feeling, it will end up in incest.<br>  <br>  I have known a friend, who was attracted his own sister, and they shared a relationship for sometime at their teen. Now, his sister is married and gone and this friend is engaged. His fiance knows his history and was able to accept because, she know it is just a leeway the guy had at his teenage. Also, my friend and his sister don't dwell on guilt or anything. They have spoken about it and accepted it is fact of life.<br>  <br>  By and large, I feel people accepting it (His fiance accepting it) is based on their personal experience and cultural acceptance. Also, Maturity of individuals.|`|d08rkYlpaa	There is something to be said for both sides, as each approach has both deleterious and advantageous effects. Much of the trauma from sexual abuse is caused after the fact, rather than during it, by the reaction of others - making it seem like the victim ought to feel more traumatized, and guilty if they do not. Also, if a person is functioning well, healing, with few symptoms or reaction behaviors, it might cause more harm than good to reopen wounds.<br>  On the other hand, a calm surface can hide a volcano waiting to erupt. Allowing abusive behavior to go unaddressed may encourage it to continue, causing personality damage, coping problems, behavioral disorders etc that may need therapy which includes getting all the facts straight and honest.
ou3wQcuYaa	I felt this way and  I know that I was more jealous than hurt. Being jealous will make you forget your strengths because you will be comparing yourself to your friend.  Plus, it sounds like your friend is trying to take this guy on purpose.  She may be trying to compete with you and make you jealous.  She should be the insecure one in this situation, not you.  Forget about this guy if he is into your friend.  If you walk, talk and feel confident people will notice, especially other confident guys.  Maybe your friend will grow up but probably not soon.|`|UfOP3xtcaa	Do not pick a guy over your friend. And if the guy is more into your friend then he is just not that into you. So move on there are a lot of guys out there but you can only have a few good friends. And pick your battles wisely.|`|CMUXo9wdaa	No it's not backstabbing. I really don't know what to call it. Just talk to her and explain to her that you like him too. Work it out. I hope this helped.
hvcjyEmDaa	Well, she should believe you, because you don't lie to her. Since she doesn't, she will find out soon enough that your ex is going to use her.
4KlGO1h2aa	No joke...  I love giving females oral sex.  Then when they cannot take it anymore, I do whatever they want me to.  Use your imagination.<br>  <br>  Sex is the best with someone you love and someone who loves you.  Don't rush into it because all the others might be trying it.  Stay pure and beautiful.  You'll get much more respect this way.  Respect is everything.|`|c5a8c01fdaa7e9cec90ecf61c2701989aa	opening the legs and just putting it in!!!! and then bend her over and put it in again =p|`|L4LLQQN9aa	<~~~ no comment :x

ronomgTIaa	You know in my years i have learned that confidence is everything. Now with that said i have dated all type of guys back when i was in highschool and jr high. I mean ive dated the jocks, the nerds, the skaters, you name the type, ive dated them. Anyways its all about how you carry yourself. If both of you are into sports go up to him and say"So I've heard that youre on the basketball team hows that going or what position do you play. Or well if he is on track i (personally) would say "Omg i hate running how do you do it." The point is to start the conversation. Then its easy from then on. Don't be shy about it. Also if this kid asked for your phone number obviously he likes you. If youre too scared to start the conversation, start saying hi to him when you see him. The point is to break the ice. Then its easy. Good luck. I hope i helped a little.|`|Rf2r23sYaa	It is NOT POSSIBLE to know if you like someone without speaking to them. Seriously, it's not possible. You're going to have to talk to him.|`|7R8IPHXIaa	I'm simple, cool and intelligent. What I want from a girl are; beauty, love, respect, wisdom and knowledge. Also caring.|`|l0AnNJibaa	im smart and kind of nerdish<br>  i like girls to be funny, smart, and nice<br>  i would date you|`|PzHplogSaa	Just be confident with yourself. Be happy of what or who you are.<br>  Just try to be yourself always don't pretend to be anyone else.<br>  With this guy, just find someone who could introduce you to each other. And see if you would click. Enjoy life!|`|g2XbXYyraa	holy ****, you have such an easy life. its just like the ****** movies you see on disney and ****...|`|ZQZf1iINaa	usually, while you are 13, people go out in school. how would a relationship work?|`|6M6XhKDKaa	it depends on your personality. date around and see who you like.|`|m9MVvQwXaa	Well if he asked for your number im sure he's interested you should talk to him next time you see him.

One time I was flirting with this girl and she seemed pretty cool until she dyed her hair red right after a conversation we had about me liking redheads.  That was so not cool.  <br>  <br>  Either he likes you, or he doesn't.  Don't go pretending to be something you're not just to get some guys attention.  Just be the best version of you.  <br>  <br>  And no, I wouldn't date you but mostly because I'm more than twice your age. :)  <br>  <br>  It'd also be hard dating someone if they didn't want to have a conversation with me.  Why don't you want to have a conversation with him?  Maybe he's just as nervous as you are?  <br>  <br>  You seem quite the analytical person (which I would find attractive) but there is a big difference between being analytical and being critical.  Take your moles for example.  Okay, if they are the size of tennis balls, I'll accept they are defects but otherwise they add character.  Look at Marilyn Monroe who is widely regarded as being one of the sexiest stars of all time.  It's you girl -- own it!  <br>  <br>  Since you are analytical, I'll give you something to think about.  It's one sentence that contains all the dating advice you'll probably ever need, if you understand it.<br>  <br>  "Be how YOU WOULD WANT someone to want you to be."<br>  <br>  Would you want some guy who would want you to act like a skank?  Would you want some guy who would want you to be quiet and never ever speak?
YLajQcFkaa	Fact is a womans vagina is only so long and a cervix can only take so much pounding till its sore and painful.  8 inches is around the max to be a "perfect" size penis.  Also its a safe bet your lying about your 9.5 anyways.  Anything above 81/2 is rare VERY rare. Also a penis that size will have trouble getting erect  as time goes on..

This may sound weird but you don't want to be too nice too them thats how you may become a just a friend.(my friend has done that before) But this really abouslutely doesn't mean go and be mean or uncaring if thats a word. If this helps try not to monopilize conversations or talk about yourself too much(I'm saying you do) so my point of that was try to be outgoing but to a certain point. Also maybe remeber how you used to act and maybe possibly try to act similar to that?? well I hoped this help if it I didn't I'm sorry for using up your time.|`|1xJYTRVXaa	theres somethin wrong wit every1 u will eventually find some1 my first girlfriend was in 3rd grade u never know wat will happen 2morrow always be prepared 4 rejection but listen E-mail i u need more advice but im probably the only 1 2 answer this question
ObVYg0iRaa	um...my boyfriend says he agrees with you...and he feels the same way...shes an idiot...she was prolley cheating with them anyway....<br>  <br>  but in my opinion i say its okay for her to have guy friends..but not okay for her to see them when you are not around..i think she is just being selfish...|`|tHVTZSMlaa	Absolutely. Relationships are based off of trust, and you should believe her until she gives you reason not to.|`|RsDAGnBhaa	Well she does have the right to see anyone she wants. You can ask her to stop seeing them, but you can't force her to leave her friends, that's unfair. I think you should let her have her guy friends because that shows you trust her, if she starts acting suspicious, then I would be worried but she's with YOU now, not them, they broke up for a reason. So yeah if you trust her, i'm sure she'd appreciate you a lot more, and to appease you she'd hang out with them less (not entirely cut off lol) =]<br>  <br>  hope this helps >_< good luck =D

Fuo2BcK2aa	Firstly, Jon is a muppet. Lets clear that out the way.<br>  <br>  That could be simple beating around the bush, if he's an anxious type of guy? Has he had many g/friends? relationships? Is he used to it? Does he have mates 'egging' him on towards you? Does he flirt with this other girl, or just using her to get to you? <br>  <br>  Simple answer to all this? Talk to him, nothing embarrassing about clearing up some confusion or "mixed-signals" as you may call them when you confront him.|`|J0WBbDwCaa	Unfortunately you're his plan B girl.

8QO17Xw1aa	im in a pretty similar situation. but ill try to help anyway<br>  <br>  1. for the acne go see a dermatologist. insurance helps to pay for visits and medication if it's the money you're worried about. dont be embarrassed to ask your parents either. <br>  2. kids in high school can be pretty awful but dont worry you'll be out of there soon enough. two more years and youll never have to see them again<br>  3. many people have trouble trusting their peers. especially in school because girls gossip and backstab. but it is important to have friends you trust, so you should work on learning to trust people more, bit by bit<br>  4. dont worry about not having your first kiss yet. there is no 'right' age for it to happen. it will happen when you're ready. dont force it either otherwise it will just be gross and have no meaning<br>  5. same goes for boyfriends. you dont need a guy to make you happy. a great guy will come along when you least expect it...<br>  6. it can definitely be easier for someone to love others than to love themselves sometimes, but zits cant be the only reason you hate yourself. that just means you hate having zits. if you feel like you are worthless and you truly hate yourself, you need to talk to someone like a therapist. depression hurts more than just your self esteem.|`|8a553a06ec63d3305f06ba0fe0b74456aa	Try seeing a dermatologist about the acne. Acne happens to lots of people but they usually grow out of it. You might want to talk to a councilor they will be able to help you find your good points.

It okay... zits suck but no biggy... there is no reason for you to think that you can't love you just because of zits... Its okay... it happens... but don't let your high school years be messed up because you were worried about zits :( High school is going to be some of the best times in your life... and dont let it be messed up because you dont love yourself... I am sure that you are beautiful and you make it sound bigger than it is... or you see yourself in way that other people don't ( like i bet some people don't even care realize that you have zits) its not something that should make you not love yourself... There will be a guy out there that is waiting on a girl just like you... and he is going to be the most amazing thing ever... and it is not going to matter anymore... I KNOW HE IS OUT THERE :) and you are not a total loser... it hurts really bad when people don't except you, but if they don't except you because of zits than there is not a reason for you to even talk to them because they are all jerks... you are beautiful :) and you are more than just zits :) you have to learn to look past them... YOU HAVE TO!!!!!! love who you are... and i know sometimes that is hard... ( its hard for me and it is hard for everyone)(we all have our own inicurites) but you have to LOVE YOU!!!!!!! zits are nothing :) they are stupid and its no big deal that you have them... so start loving you :)|`|eAIapfXsaa	Read "Six Pillars of Self Esteem" by Nathaniel Branden. <br>  It helped me tremendously and enabled me to improve my life a lot and be happy.<br>  I used to have low self esteem because my parents and the kids in school were very mean and abusive to me.<br>  But now I have high self esteem and if something bad happens, I get over it quickly. Nothing can get me down anymore, at least not for very long.<br>  <br>  You need to use Google and look for answers on what to do about those zits. Don't just whine about it.

qrI5ZH42aa	1) the support from your families, they'll be able to give you advice when you need it the most and a shoulder to cry on when you're upset.<br>  2) you know that they'll be of a similar background to you so as long as you are both sweet and kind to each other there's no reason why love won't grow.  In love marriages the majority that break down are corroded by money worries and the like which won't happen to you if you're well matched.<br>  3)don't have to crack your head looking for girls of your age/culture/language/religion if these things are important to you.<br>  <br>  Those are the main differences.  Obviously you don't get full freedom in choosing who you marry when it's arranged but after the first few months, once you know each other well, you'll be just the same as any other couple apart from your families will be more supportive of you this way rather than if you had a love marriage.

Any how please, please be careful. If she is going out with other guys, and you have sex with her, you might be at risk of HIV / AIDS or other sexually infectious diseases.<br>  <br>  There are so many mature ladies or girls.  Do not try to look for them though, carry on with your ambitions and God will show you your favourite partner.  Promiscuity takes life.  Again, if you have sex use a condom.  But do not go so far, just let her go and live her life, she may regret it in the end.

Unfortunataly for me, he was the one who I shared my first kiss with, so it makes it kinda tought. But distractions help, like for a while, the Twilight series helped a great deal, because they kept my mind focussed on something else for a few weeks. Now I am almost over him completely. Also, I finally spilled to my BFFL about my feelings for the guy, and that helped MAJOR!!! Hope I could help!

brkvK1Teaa	It depends what you mean "like".  Most guys are looking for easy sex if available so it's pretty easy for one to like you.  If you're talking about someone who values you for who you are, then that would take more time to find out.  It doesn't matter if a guy is American as you say or not.  Just remember that sincerity is what counts.  Good luck.|`|CX5RGqZuaa	id like 2|`|yw5J2J6faa	IM AMERICAN!

15c8ad2687584eea83444b4419958919aa	I am not sure the cost, I do know that you have to go through the city to get permits to have a ceremony on the beach, so I would contact city hall to see if they have prices.|`|4POGapREaa	I'm in Huntington Beach.  Hey neighbor!  Originally we wanted a beach wedding here but canceled it & flew to Hawaii instead.  I did a lot of research though.  The cost for the permit is like $150 for most beaches & parks but you can't make the beach private or section it off.  I don't think that's allowed but people will respect your wedding in general & probably try not to walk through your photos.  The downside for me was seating because I only found one beach that allowed it.  Even the cliff weddings in Laguna didn't allow seating because of the grass, etc.  So it's pretty much standing room only.<br>  <br>  Our officiant was going to be $350 going up to around $500 for special requests plus a gratuity is expected generally.<br>  <br>  I don't know where you're at with money but my biggest problem was that all of the ocean front restaurants were incredibly expensive for a reception.  It started around $125/pp without alcohol & that was bare minimum.<br>  <br>  You need to consider parking too.  Beach parking sucks & if you're doing the ceremony there & the reception somewhere else, you're guests will be parking at meters & walking far.  If you're having the reception at the beach, the valet cost is usually between $10-$20 per car.<br>  <br>  If you're not entirely set on the beach, I would highly recommend doing it at a restaurant like Cannon's in Dana Point overlooking the Harbor or Tortilla Flats in Mission Viejo on the Lake.  We wanted water but just couldn't afford the prices & the inconveniences of the beach so I found those 2 places to be the best priced & the prettiest.|`|6LYe4BOLaa	I'm getting married on the beach in Florida this August and for us to have our wedding (not including the reception) it's going to be about $2,000. I've seen prices much cheaper and some more expensive than that. It's all about what you want! Good Luck and Congratulations!

b4c080d0f4c39aa94fde4b1f35a009fbaa	First tell me who all is spreading this rumour that if husband & wife doesn't live together for one year their marriage can be challenged in court & by whom? This not so. Now you both belong to different religions can marry according to Civil form of marriage without either of you converting,no Arya Samaj Mandir required for such marriage but only the Marriage Officer. Number of times I have answered such questions regarding inter-religious marriages apart from getting them solemnized before the marriage officer. You both belonging to different religion can marry in the court without changing your individual religion. Registered/Court marriage as you call it is solemnized under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 all such marriages can take place between any two Indian citizens as well one Indian citizen with a foreigner irrespective of their religion, caste or creed, and you can say this is the secular form of marriage available in our country. Such a marriage is solemnized before the marriage officer/registrar usually D.C. deputy commissioner of the area /SDM where both or any of the parties to such a marriage reside permanently or for at least one month. Cost of such a marriage as the rate prevalent in your area. Now how you proceed? Both the parties to the marriage file a joint application before the marriage officer along with individual affidavit attested by notary public specifying the age(boy 21yrs &girl 18yrs), place of residence, marital status(unmarried or divorcee as the case maybe), mental status(not idiot or not with unfit mind), not related to each other. Along with this you have to give proof of age (School certificate, Passport, Pan card), proof of residence (Passport, ration card, voters ID card, rent agreement), & the application/notice of such a marriage maybe asked to be witnessed by 3 independent adult persons, affix one photograph of each of the parties & all the 3 witnesses. You have made such an application/notice to the marriage officer in person along with all the 3 witnesses. On receiving such an application/notice the marriage officer issues a month notice regarding the intended marriage & get such a notice affixed on the notice board out side his office, a copy of such notice is sent to the marriage officer under whose jurisdiction the other party lives, also a copy is to the individual parties address. After expiry of the period of notice a date is fixed on which all the persons parties to the marriage & 3 witnesses appear again before the marriage officer who declare them married & issue a certificate to this regard. Incase of any objections raised the marriage officer will settle these objections. Now what can be objections that can be raised? These can ONLY BE REGARDING THE CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR SUCH MARIAGE & NOTHING ELSE. What are the conditions? As I stated above i.e. Age, martial status, mental status, prohibited relationship (related to each other by blood). This is the brief & general procedures I have told you here. It’s always better to engage a lawyer to get such marriage solemnized to avoid any legal impediments which he will be able to handle.|`|yL8gpWTRaa	If you are in the UK or USA just go get married in the Town Hall and drag 2 witnesses off the street!<br>  <br>  Whatever happend to romance?

I think u need to sit yr husband down and tell him how u feel, I honestly think u shud end this marriage its obvious there is no real intense love in this relationship.  Hes signed up online dating, well, that tells me he is interested in other women and is gonna see where it takes him in the world of other women.  This other guy is prob frightened to tell u how he really feels abt u cos he knows ur married and that yr family are very involved but i'd say he thinks a lot of u and prob does luv u.  You need to get this sorted out or ul go away in the head<br>  <br>  Luv Magsxx|`|3fOFbz5Taa	Have both of them !!!!!|`|705SlyOaaa	you have a lot of issues!<br>  1st leave this guy alone! he doesnt have the same feelins for you, and you cant leave your marriage to run after the wind,<br>  you need to resolve things with your husbands you say you never go out well you initiate it!!! instead of focusing on this guy focus on your husband just try and try, he is feeling this to as he is on net dating sites so work hard on your marriage, be positive but dont expect miricals if you want somthing initiate it.|`|AA12250380	Boyfriends are always more attractive than husbands untill you start living with them.

Don't get your hopes too high that you are going to be with your friend with whom you are in love with though. He said he didnMt have the same feelings for you. But, do set your husband and yourself free to find the ones you will love. That is the only way to go, otherwise you are both wasting a large part of your spirit and soul on nothingness when they desire to express and receive love. You will both be happier with the one YOU choose, and so will the rest of the world. Don't give in to family pressure.|`|3aEzvOBcaa	There is no guarantee for that the marriage with this other guy would end better then this present one. Being inside or outside of a marriage is a big difference. In the western societies the divorce is terrible common, that is not a good sign. If possible, try to agree with your husband on that you open a bit your marriage, and he lets you, and you let him to date bit around. I think this is the only possibility to correct the circumstances of an arranged marriage when you feel a bit forced to live together. This was not your own intention. But do not want to destroy your marriage immediately.I am sure of that there are values in it. I hope your husband will be intelligent enough to understand that your continuous  fighting comes from that the marriage was arranged. But two intelligent persons can find out that how to solve this problem, and you may be very good friends who help the other one even in emotional disturbances like your present love (that is not a forever love!). And if you do it well, at the end you will even love each other. The key to this future love is an understanding and support the other person to find some happiness in the life, even if that is a temporary love with  somebody else. If you cannot live this way then you will supply each other with unhappiness for a whole life.<br>   <br>  <br>  |`|Jwfbel1Caa	is your love life exiting enough for you and this is a phase we all go through i advise you speak to your partner  before any thing happens this also will gain more trust,<br>  Dr D|`|e540c226567d45a2b9f2750a45a76d4baa	wow you sound like my wife. yes i have reads her emails, things get bad then better, then better than bad, go to him leave the husband. i so wish she would do the same, or see a dr!!!! they make meds for this. i love her so i stay knowing it is not her, or me, it is what is. trust me if you go to him you will be wrighting this same line about the new guy.michael (sorry no caps on my computer) |`|nChu1bNJaa	Don't do it!! <br>  Fix it with your husband. Leave that other guy alone. You chose your husband and he chose you. You need to work it work and be happy with your husband.<br>  <br>  The only reason you both are doing what you are doing, is because you both have drifted away from each other. Get some counseling and fix this, before you regret it.|`|lgxE5nUoaa	Focus on your marriage - let go of this other guy.  Not worth it.

Good luck!|`|Yq2cmrIFaa	Think about it:<br>  This guy has dumped you after all you have done for him and you are going to mope over it? Don't give him that satisfaction.  You seem like a really nice person and he is a real jerk for breaking up with you and using the excuse that you lied to him and he won't even tell you what the lie was. I know it still hurts and don't forget that crying is always 100% okay, and is always a good way to get your feelings out.  You might want to think about moving on. Remember, you deserve WAY better.<br>  <br>  If you are still upset: Maybe think about talking to him and finding out exactly what this "lie" was.<br>  <br>  Ways to move on: <br>  1) Get rid of any text messages or emails you have gotten from him.<br>  2) Get rid of any photos you have of him. A picture of you and him on a date in your room is not any help to recovery.<br>  3) Have a girls night out. Grab a bunch of your close girl friends and take a night to shop and have fun.<br>  4) Keep friends and family close by to you.<br>  <br>  I hoped I helped and I hope everything turns out for the best.

p7xOo5Hyaa	Just give her some time.  The nice ones are worth waiting for.  If your referring to things not happening in the bedroom, maybe she is a virgin or just really nervous? I was almost 19 when i lost my virginity to my now fiance', and i didnt tell him i was a virgin.  So you can imagine how frustrated he was when i was terrified of anything other than kissing!!

Take her out to movies, dates etc. Talk! Communication is key to keep a relationship alive. Ask her what she thinks about you and if she wants to continue. I don't understand how someone who likes someone can stand to dump them just because not much happens. If you're going to dump her because of that, it means you don't really like her. <br>  <br>  Liking someone doesn't necessarily mean having things happen all the time, but caring for them and making them feel special.|`|MKHd10MYaa	Two months is still the start of a relationship.<br>  <br>  If you think nothing is happening between you two, speed things up.

Don't dump her over something silly like that, it's not completely her fault for things not happening.|`|A2VJuYgSaa	If you like her, just take it easy and get to know her more. the more you get to know someone then things change with time.<br>  <br>  please answer my question!!<br>  :)|`|SaTfE6TEaa	If you like her why dump her, just tell her that you two should do more stuff together.|`|4NXaKEykaa	Hmm...<br>  If you're questioning the relationship, chances are that she is as well.

I've been dating my boyfriend for 4 months, and I think that you should decide around the 2 month mark as to whether or not it is worth continuing the relationship.|`|5DS1lfExaa	umm yeaa i agree, jusst take her out and stuff and get to know her alot more and ask her what she wants to do in life and just basic stuff...dont make it rocket science...and communication is probably the key for a good and healthy relationship|`|J49ugF0xaa	Ok here are the instructions...<br>  <br>  ?Ask her if she has a my space.<br>  ?get texting if you don't have it. <br>  ?Call her everyother dayish.<br>  ? Always give her presents for C-mas, B-day, and V-day.<br>  ?Talk in classes|`|LJMLQMytaa	i feel ya man just go around listening to what she has to sayask what she likes, be diffrent wierd fun and if that does not work i guess you have to|`|SoXLTmcnaa	then if you really like her but your only problem is that nothings happening...the only reason nothings happening is becasue yall havent made anything happen...|`|wF2G3Krcaa	You shouldn't rush her into anything, if you really like her, wait for her. She'll reward you. Trust me|`|gE0JbWTCaa	Dont dump her if thats the ONLY thing! Maybe you should do some stuff, so you dont make her do all the work|`|79i7fqVxaa	wellllll ok ummmm if you havnt kissed KISS HERRRR<br>  <br>  duhhhhhh<br>  <br>  haha but dont dump her unless you realllly want to|`|i0fwYMOUaa	i think ur taking toooo slow speed it up|`|jNwA2M8Jaa	One of my friends has this problem... almost at the 2 month mark with her bf and they haven't kissed yet. Have you guys?
Fp1IFEEBaa	put on something sexy and start giving him a message. than start kissing him on the lips on the neck and unbotton his shirt and undo his pants and by than u guys should be well one your way to having sex|`|Fuo2BcK2aa	"initiate", right there, you make it sound like a chor or something! There obviously isn't enough incentive for you to engage as much as him, it's hard to judge to be honest as i'm sure most will agree unless you give us an idea..<br>  <br>  Like do you have sex 8 times a week, and he's asking for more.<br>  <br>  Or do you have sex once a week, and he's asking for more.<br>  <br>  Makes a big difference to the answers your going to get :D
7cjqT33Baa	I'm sorry you are going through this and feeling so alone.  It's not a fun feeling.<br>  Perhaps you are TOO even tempered to the point you've become a doormat.  The second you tolerated that kind of behavior of his, you set it up to continue in the future and now he just knows he can get away with it.  If he started yelling at me or having an outburst I'd yell right back and say "look at me, I can yell too"  I would not put up with that kind of behavior of his at all.  You sound like a really good woman, honestly, and I think you deserve more for yourself and you shouldn't settle for this kind of treatment.  You have a job, move out for a while if he won't change.  Stop tolerating that kind of treatment.    This isn't the Stoneage.<br>  This is your only life, at least that we are guaranteed, so take control of it and demand more for yourself.  And NEVER invest more in the relationship than he does.  NEVER.  That is the biggest mistake a woman can make.  Do not be his cook, his maid etc. if he isn't taking care of your needs too.  I know it's programmed in some women to keep doing it, regardless of how they are treated...but that only leads to a miserable life.<br>  He does all this to you because you have shown that you'll tolerate it.  Be strong and stop tolerating it.  Even if he yells, just yell back or leave.  At first he'll do that kind of stuff because he's trying to intimidate you into backing down.  Don't back down.  He really will change if you demand it through your actions.<br>  Good luck.  I really hope it works out for you.|`|TDLw7ozyaa	I can relate to what your're going through, currently we are not talking, He acts like he can't stand the sight of me. I'm ready to give up, again.|`|AA10211580	you do not need his negativity in your life. he is inconsiderate about your feelings and acts like he is a bachelor. you have a full time job and you can probably support yourself (if you were a housewife. I could understand why you would stay in the marriage financially) but this is different.<br>  i'm not one who tells people what to do each person is different and does what's right for them whether to stay in their marriage or to leave it.|`|HC17qGwEaa	He is self-centered. And until he realizes it, it will surely stay this way. I am sorry, my husband  too is selfish but, in his defense I kinda made him that way. Because I was so giving and wanting to take care of him. Now I don't get what I use to get from him.|`|gVwqxDMQaa	Have you asked him what he wants out of your relationship? Sounds like he is taking you for granted. I noticed the more I did to make myself happy and take care of myself, the more my husband paid attention to me. Unfortunately, it was too late for him by the time he finally did and now we are getting a divorce. But, taking care of myself and doing things that made me happy changed my outlook. You really can't change anybody else, you can only change yourself. Good luck. Wishing you happiness.|`|wP4c5bbYaa	Marriage Counseling.  I had a friend who wouldn't go in a similar situation.  After refusing to see a Therapist, his wife finally (third time I think) made the appointment, and told him to either be there with her or at the Holiday Inn room she had reserved for the same date, his choice.  No yelling, fighting, or nastiness, just a stateement of fact.  <br>  <br>  She wanted what they used to have back, and found a way to make it happen.  You can also go alone.  The United way in your area will have a list of available options.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  Dean|`|veZLfnGFaa	Oh, you would have been better off staying single.  I guess the old saying is true "You don't know anyone until you live with them".  This is sad to live this way, knowing he can't or won't be changed.  You have a choice, live in it or get out.  Personally, I would rather be alone.
K8EJVxLgaa	YES! You should at least try to be friends again. A world of hate is not so great sweety. :)|`|trERH3oBaa	for now, move on|`|Al0ey6iQaa	I think you should tell him to cut the sh!t. He is obviously having a massive laugh over this, however he does actually like you, not to mention the fact that he LOVES all the attention you are giving him. If you tell him to stop playing, and he agrees, you'll be great. If he doesn't agree, well, you'll allways have that great time txtn each other.
BlSeGah7aa	iv lived on my own scenic i was 15 1/2 so yeah go to the cort office an tell them you want to get emancipated an they will give you paper work so you and your parents can fill out its easy!!
VHE22iNbaa	Nobody can answer those questions because they don't know enough about your situation. This is something you'll have to figure out including whether the relationship is worth saving.<br>  <br>  I can tell you from experience that when your head is messed up it's very hard to decide what to do. When my boyfriend and I broke up, I did some really stupid things because I wasn't thinking straight.<br>  <br>  I finally listened to my best friend who had been trying to tell me to back off for a while. She's always messing around on the internet and found one of those on line books about fixing relationships but analyzing them first. It has some fantastic stuff in it. It worked for me because I was in no condition to decide what to do on my own.

All good things take time. Personally, I feel better because I have some insight and a plan. I don't feel like everything is completely out of control.<br>  <br>  Wish me luck, and I wish the best of luck to you.|`|v1uNUcwCaa	rate <br>  if you dont get back together within a month of spliting up you need to accept its over and move on.<br>  <br>  ex means past. leave it there.<br>  <br>  learn your lesson from what she has told you and dont let it happen in your next relationship|`|HZgjUguWaa	1 st change your locks then change your girlfriend She is your "ex" for a reason leave her be You move forward|`|1146c92abdc9757a27d4e2f824c1d33faa	Take the keys away if it is your house!<br>  Don't worry about number two.

First for all for how long can you take this that insulting beating and stuff? You don't deserve that you deserve to treat good And yes i think you should break up with him but i or other people can't force you to do that it's all up to you all we can't do is give you advice.|`|WLLvMY3iaa	Please break up with him. You should never allow someone a second chance after they hit you.  NEVER.  He could easily become worse and cause you permanent damage.  People should never hit each other in a relationship.  Leave him and never talk to him again.  He does not love and probably cannot love anyone. Hitting or hurting someone physically is not a part of love or like.|`|421b1247395dca6ee67c1d6b736731a7aa	The reason women stay in bad relationships is because the man claims he is so sorry in times of calm, and treats the woman like she should be treated all the time (cared for, respected, given gifts, etc).  I know you love him but you can't save him, and you can't change him. He needs professional help to get over his anger issues.<br>  <br>  Here is some information for you that might ring true with your situation. I'm not saying you're being "battered," but you are in an abusive relationship just the same, and you might recognize some of his tendencies in this information.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jcfcc.vcn.com/battering.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcfcc.vcn.com/battering.html</a>|`|EvDmgWjvaa	I stopped at he is hitting you.<br>  If you don't know what your next move is I hope you will listen to most here.

Don't ever let a man hit you and get away with it. I don't care if it's a little slap here and there, a man is someone who can treat his girlfriend right, and hitting a woman is not what a man does. If you have any respect for yourself you will get out of this relationship. You should never be afraid to stand up for yourself. You may love him, but the truth is, he needs help. I don't know what his problem is but you need to tell a close friend, your mom or dad, his mom or dad, or someone else that you can trust what has been going on and have someone with you when you tell him he needs help. I would even be willing to help you if you needed it. <br>  <br>  You may wonder what would happen if you told someone that he is hitting you, but what would happen to you if you don't?

65ecae20f0ade905381af6cc841421f0aa	The truth is painful, and I am not sure you want to hear it, but penis size is the most important thing in how much pleasure a guy can give a girl in sex.<br>  <br>  Some girls say that a big penis is good, but skills as a lover is better. Well, maybe that is true, but a guy with a big penis AND skills is obviously the best of all.<br>  <br>  Consider this also. A guy with an average penis and good skills will always be only that, you can't make his penis bigger. But a guy with a big penis and not so great skills can be educated by the right woman (like me!) and will then give the best of all worlds.<br>  <br>  So to sum up, penis size is all important, because everything else can be improved and changed, except for that.
XsLj9jERaa	I think you need to speak with your friend about this.<br>  I think she is trying to be an honest friend and waited 5 months to start dating your ex because she figured you would be over him. <br>  If neither of them know that you still love him, then this makes sense. <br>  I don't think you should say anything though because if they like each other and want to be together and waited almost half a year to make sure you could heal, knowing that you still love him would make him feel awkward and she would most likely feel guilty being with him.<br>  It takes longer for some people to heal than others, however, you deserve someone who loves YOU. If your best friend and your ex like each other there isn't much else you can do...<br>  Hope things work out! :)|`|TrPySdXFaa	DAMN DATS UR BFF WAT A *****|`|K68YXJPtaa	Oh wow i'm sorry. Tell them how  you feel, tell your best friend how she's hurting you...Did she know you were still in love with him? Anyway that doesn't matter.I would definitely Talk to them!
AA11818873	The answer is simple, but not "easy" to adopt in practical life.<br>  There is no "asking" mind in love. There are no expectations, no desires, etc. Only giving oneself quite unconditionally !<br>  That is why true love is very rare. In true love, we actually "forgo" any security offered, instead of 'seeking' security. So there is no scope for fear or worry, no scope for feeling disappointed, deceived etc. <br>  Very sorry to sound so crude and unhelpful, but 'truth' doesn't need any support. We can be only aware of it.We cannot 'use' it in commercial sense! <br>  Infatuation is primitive, whereas a bit more mature thing is sustained 'mutual' compromise, but still it is not 'true' love. So sustained relationships can 'afford' to laugh at those innocent 'infatuation' cases, but , when we look deep enough, they are really no better. Just a question of time!<br>  Best wishes|`|70DZWz2Baa	Everyone fights as a couple. If not you are doing something seriouslly wrong(not literally). I think I am in love but you know when you are in love. Whenever I see this girl I feel like I could take on the world and fly away into the night sky. I just want to scoop her into my arms and hold her close while she listens to my heartbeat and I will tell her how much I love her and then I'll kiss her(first time). Ah aren't fantasies wonderful.|`|VmuLzz0Waa	Maybe you are more useto being around each other then loving one another,sometime's being useto someone is more stronger then love but you can't tell the differents because there both to strong or you love him so much but just don't want to accept the truth you know when you pass from a 1yr relationship and start to pass it and go up to 2,3,4,and then some you can't tell weather it's love or just to useto that person.....|`|oAPSJnSEaa	If you are in love....you have no worries you trust this person with all your heart and only want to see them happy..and want to spend the rest of your days together. If its just infatuation/the feeling of security..You will be questioning your relationship a lot...have the feeling you want to leave maybe start fights in hopes you will break up and you are afraid to really leave because you may think that's the best you are ever going to get and if you leave you'll end up with some lowlife....|`|Dj5f1SRfaa	if tomorrow your boyfriend was in a devastating car accident and needed to get every one of his basic needs from you- bathing, eating, going to the bathroom- would you do it, or would you hesitate?|`|fmHyfVmVaa	It's like when you go into labor the first time, you just know...<br>  Blessings!|`|Sg0gCtEAaa	Ask God.|`|nVPTmmUgaa	i think it is better to go to to a cristian church and ask god <br>  <br>  <br>  ps:you don't have time god is coming soon and destroy the world<br>  sorry if this hurt or scared you it's the truth|`|XtHsBlJKaa	When your in love,  you will know it.

I feel like deep down you know the real answer|`|LAnmsupZaa	you just know|`|b5bWauW1aa	You know because whenever he smiles at you or the way you feel around him you get this feeling like your chest is gonna burst and you feel so happy it's impossible to contain it and you feel your heart isn't yours it's his plus when he's happy are you happy or when he's sad do you want to fix his life and make it easier and do you want to help him in any way you can. if you feel this way for him and he feels this way for you than this i 100% guarantee is true true love. And true love is unconditional<br>  <br>  <br>  I wish you the best.|`|9UQlhzitaa	Abby hi girl<br>  <br>  Love is= the ability to care for someone eleses need over your own wants<br>  <br>  infat or lust is= i need, i want comes out of you or your partners mouth all the time<br>  <br>  love also is unyielding to the bad things in life it is called unconditional love; which begs the question under what condition does that which is unconditional become conditional?<br>  <br>  to know if you love him the ask yourself these questions<br>  1) why do you love him?<br>  2)what is it that you love about him?<br>  3) is he your best friend<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1) if you can answer this then you have a need problem,he fulfills something In you that you lack and should he stop doing it then love turns to hate because your left with that need not being met and it is his fault<br>  2)you need at least 5 answers here to show what type of relationship bonds you 2 have so that when  the storms come there are these to hold you together and give you your bonds for after to build yourselves back up as a couple<br>  3)if he is not or not well on his way to becoming your best friend then there will always be security/trust issues because who do you trust more than your best friend  male and female and yes no 1 man can be everything to his woman because as hard as we try we can never give birth or see the world exactly the same way you woman do<br>  <br>  well i have given you enough to think on best of luck and i hope it all works out for you|`|OCTvfDsxaa	Good question. I thought I was "in love" with a guy I dated and lived with on and off for 5 years,but it turned out to be a deep infatuation. His started out to be everything I wanted in a guy and it even felt like he could read my mind at times. But over time he changed and wasn't as thoughtful of me anymore. I realized we had always had different ideas about what road to take our relationship down and we would never go any farther than where we already were. In my idea of love,you never stop growing and experiencing new things. If you stop feeling as though your sharing a life together and are growing apart-it's infatuation.|`|Ku5g1hXtaa	The difference between love and infatuation is for one, would you die for this person hands down? If yes, you love him. Two, can you imagine your life without him? If no you love him. Three, would it take months to get over this someone if not years if he said good bye, if yes you love him. I use to question my relationships all the time when I was young, and believe me when you find that special someone you know.|`|1itmn0NOaa	Many of us tell we are in love if somebody likes us or each other.But most of the time it is not love but infatuation. <br>  I Loved some one and still Love and for that I didn't demand anything inreturn neither love. we are good fren now because she didn't reply me yet.And i didn't asked her more .But I remember before I porposed her I was always planning of our future, My eyes were always searching for her , I felt  my breathing was shared within us.I had awaken the whole night thinking of her, But by the time I considered my self my love for her is one sided so I still love her without anything demanding or aspecting. Inour good frenship criteria I still love her.<br>  And I know I am in love with her and she is in with our frenship.|`|2cIceMVdaa	Feeling secure is love. Knowing the one you love will protect you in life and death.Knowing he will stand by your side until there is no breath left in him.<br>  That is love.   If you were not in love.you would fight a lot more and you would constantly wonder why your going out with him.<br>  <br>  Hope this was useful|`|pFjgBBUZaa	well to be honest with you every relationship have fights, i mean every 'real' relationships have some disagreements. however, that doesnt' mean that you give on the person you been/known with for so long. about the love part, i know everybody thinks different and i think love is a selfish act, act to make you happy. So as long as your feeling happy with him/her then ur good  :).|`|m2WGmGXjaa	If you're questioning whether you love him or not, it's most likely not love.<br>  <br>  Love is just something you KNOW when you feel. It's intense and it's unlike anything you've ever felt or could dream of feeling. It's when you just want that one person for the rest of your life no matter what.|`|JcV2nn4jaa	I think when you post this question is when you already you are not truly in love with the guy.  There is never doubt in love
afcLu9YMaa	Why didn't you tell her yourself, that way no one can add their slant to the story.<br>  <br>  I don't like anyone lying about me, what I have said or done,  however the only way to stop this is to go and sort it out directly with the person, ask them what they have been told and then tell them the truth.|`|CkVREmR1aa	Woah, that question is making my head explode.<br>  <br>  And here i was thinking this was an english web site....
Zuj07b5saa	1st of all, tell his sister. 2nd of all, ask him out! life is too short, and if he used to like u....he still may :)  3rd of all..well i dont have a third of all ahhahaha but u just do what feels right :) i am sure he will go out with u and then u too will be happy together, but if its too awkward, then just end it, but like i said b4, life is too short, so be spontaneous!! (: hope this helped ya!!! :D
SweWC8p1aa	Guy 1: Flirt by telling him thank you and ask him what he's doing this weekend and see if he wants to hang out. and complement him.<br>  Guy 2: honestly, i think this guy REALLY likes you.. so he isnt going to be too heard to go out with. if he likes your art, he isnt lying! he must be really into you. and if he winks at you, then duh.. wink back :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped.
Wf8PbTraaa	yea he should wait it out and see if his friend has the same feelings for him....if not then some things are  left in the dark.<br>  <br>  but if he is gay (or bi) then thats something he can't control or change (unless he lies to himself) the best thing you can do is let him know that your his sister and you love him no matter what he is (and it seems like your doing that so kudos to you)
0b7kCM5Jaa	It sounds like she might already like you....<br>   But, first of all in middle school so many guys think the way to a girl's heart is to be crazy macho and basically rude. The truth is, the nice guy is always better liked. Teasing is always good, but acting aloof is a bad mistake. <br>  Anyway, I say just be nice and honest and it sounds like good things could happen for you. :)
XJ6RxMQIaa	text him and somewhere in the conversation be like dude do you think (movie name) will be good? I kinda wanna see it. If he likes the movie just be like we should see it together ;)|`|eNlGfAPaaa	jus text him... u r hot..

aLgY4l3Naa	Come on girl, can you please pick up your values, morals and self respect, you dont know what to do?? You knew better and know better to allow youself to get caught in the middle of this mess!! What do you think you will get out of this guy besides sex and a broken heart!! He is NOT A MAN, he is a coward, looking for an easy fix to his problems!!He does not even carry any type of respect for his wife or children, HONESTLY were do you think you rate on the todem pole?? Wether his marriage is on the brink of divorce or not, its not for you to decided and how can you trust him that he is telling you the truth about anything, he is a liar and deciever!! Truly what you need to do is get your head out of your ***, and toss this guy to the curb!! Open your eyes girl and realize there is no winning here for anyone, get out of this situation while your still ahead of yourself and you have your heart in tact still!! And just for a moment put yourself in his wifes shoes, how would you like to endure the pain of your partner betraying you and your children, IT HURTS and you or him have not realized the life time of heartache and pain you are going to cause to a family, if his marriage is not going to survive let it be their decision, but you should not in no way be a factor for the reason of that divorce, REMEMBER PAY BACK IS A ***** AND KARMA WILL GET YA!! Do the right thing and remove yourself from this situation, its not worth it!! If you dont respect yourself no one else will including him!! Good luck to you and i hope you decide to do better!!|`|VPksp6SQaa	If you wanna do the right thing, wait to see what happens w/ his marriage....do not give him marriage advice either! It wouldn't be good coming from someone who is attracted to him!<br>  If you are still attracted to him if he gets a divorce, then go for it....I know the age is an issue, but if it doesn't bother you or him, then it's obviously not a problem!|`|3916f5798ac025038c4fefc3c8b7ea7caa	Let's see...he's much older than you, he's married with 3 kids, he's flirting with you BEFORE his divorce is final...although his marriage is "on the brink of divorce" (like ALL those kinda guys claim)...and you're even letting him pay for little things for you.<br>  Gosh...I wonder what he's wanting?<br>  <br>  I swear...some women are just too damn dumb to be turned loose with a vagina.|`|EvaRsC5Eaa	How can you flirt with him knowing that his children will get hurt once he gets a divorce? Don't you feel any guilt? (no offense)<br>  <br>  If I were you I would quit that job. I would try to get out of the situation as fast as I can. Besides, he's almost 40, my dad is 40 and i would kick the *** of any woman he would cheat on my mother with.<br>  <br>  I don't think you would want this in your conscience. Just do what is right.<br>  Not what you want, not what he wants.

RRCnwwuwaa	She sounds desperate.  Are you?  I might meet her somewhere, but I would never tell her where I lived or give her my phone number.  If you haven't even met yet, and she's texting you that many times, what do you think she'll do if you were dating regularly?  Scary.|`|LFE878Osaa	she probably really likes you. she probably doesn't get asked out a lot though. If it gets annoying just kind of back away a little|`|a0S75L1faa	she could just really like you and i would go on the date i mean your not going to get married its just a first date so if it doesnt go well you dont have to go on another..just get your feet wet try it out.
lAZWTLtRaa	That's rough. But I think it's just a natural feeling. When you've been with someone for a long time, and shared many secrets and good times, of course you're going to miss him. You have to give him time. It was your fault (I'm not blaming you here so don't get upset) for the split, and you've done/said what you could. That is very bold of you to confess your feelings for him, I'm impressed, people usually don't do that, so kudos to you =)<br>  You have to give him time to get over the fact that you broke up with him for another guy. You also have to consider that he started dating your ex-bestie, which seems like a retaliation to me.  If you're single, stay single for a little while, and see if he changes his mind. If you're with someone, it'll be harder for him to approach you about dating again, and it will be hard on the person you have to break up with (and if you really start liking them, then this situation is just going to repeat itself).<br>  If you're still friends with your ex, stay friends. And be an awesome friend. Make him fall in love with you again =)<br>  Either that, or just move on.  Like I said before, wanting him back could be a result of wanting back the memories and good times. But you still have your life ahead of you, and maybe you'll find someone just as special =)<br>  Hope this helps!|`|Sg0gCtEAaa	I learned about emoticons in Computer Applications II today, but some of yours are unidentifiable.|`|JbeQoMvTaa	everyone feels like this at some point in life.<br>  you ditch somebody.<br>  then they go out with somebody you like.<br>  you get jeleous.<br>  and realise you want them back.<br>  theres nothing you can do.<br>  WELCOME TO THE HARSH REALITY OF LOVE.<br>  it's bummish i know (:<br>  all you can do for the best is tell him, tell him how you feel. honestly.<br>  and thats the most likely way you stand a chance.<br>  <br>  <br>  take care x|`|yid0jeX4aa	Tell him how you feel and if his reaction is positive, then you're fine, but if his reaction is negative, sorry to say but you may have spoiled it|`|8f38917f28354b150fc3180e3404c810aa	your love is like the wind you can't see it, but you can feel it<br>                 -A Walk to Remember|`|HdXy9Ppvaa	no, you're not a slut, whore, or anything like that. it's natural to want a guy back when you dump him. too many girls have the same problem. what i think you should do is wait. wait and see what happens, maybe he needs some time to take it all in. he probably thinks that if he takes you back, you'll do the same thing. if in a little while he doesn't come around, get him by himself and tell him how all you can think about is him and how you really do love him. prove to him that you ARE sorry for what you did. don't be mad at your ex best friend either, she probably feels the same way you do about him. and no, you're not doing anything wrong, like i said, he might just need time. if you have any more questions, feel free to e-mail me. i'll answer ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ytvvQdKUaa	hes probably confused since you broke up with him and now want him back.  dont keep saying you love him.  that will probably just scare him and he'll think you are obsessed with him our something.  wait for him to come to you.  if he dont go to him and tell him EXACTLY how you feel about him.  if that dont work try to forget about him.  good luck.|`|qDII8luraa	That is not wrong, but he is with someone else.

AA10065812	First off, he's already 13 years behind in child support, because she can file for up to 18 years worth of retroactive child support, so you better start putting money aside because she can come in and take anything of value.  <br>  <br>  Finding her is a problem, especially if she was legal at the time, but you need to do so.  Unless she's been on Welfare, you could avoid the retroactive child support by doing a preemptive strike.  Find them and than set up a voluntary child support order.

Smart guys encourage their women to inherit -- and wear --  their all-cotton dress shirts.|`|UI79JnJVaa	"White satin panties, with white Lace trim,<br>   Looks scrumptious on a young woman."<br>  <br>  "Thongs really don't excite me, and edible<br>   panties aren't exactly my fetish."|`|U53R1Bq0aa	I honestly think that girls that wear thongs like almost everyday are skanky..i think if your panty line shows then yeah wear a thong, or if you are like trying to seduce your bf then thats great too! but panties are fine! as long as they are cute! But yeah definitely boyshorts are cute! =)|`|DC1WZvwJaa	I like thongs there hot but i really like boy shorts they get me going but even get me going more when they come off.|`|3Ae9XYOUaa	?|`|X8ImtFIDaa	im a girl but i would say panties are better.|`|7L7zpAT6aa	I don't think a guy will care as long as your pants come off.|`|7AfEG5rWaa	thongs obv|`|MAloAT8jaa	go for the crazy underwear. every time you see a piece of underwear that is so crazy your not even sure how to put it on then buy it.|`|SbZMunCAaa	I like panties because thongs are all up in your business. but maybe that will change for when i have a guy to show it off.|`|wE2etBzbaa	No underwear.  with short skirt.  all guys with functioning d**ks love it unless they are gay.|`|zAtQoTwraa	I wear bikini string (low-backs) ;)<br>  but an occasional thong when my baby comes over ;)|`|iRGC6bWsaa	i think a thong because if you have a husband or a boy friend he will think its SEXY!!|`|fZ38PPgSaa	:)|`|OUtEtm2vaa	thong! and booty panties|`|szyrw5P0aa	thongs by far|`|FkJgd8o4aa	Thongs.

For example, if you're gonna wear a dress with thin fabric: thong. If you wanna feel more comfortable, then probably panties (or even those sexy, cute panty-shorts).<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that using thongs too frequently eventually helps the butt-drooping process...|`|x3InEhjFaa	Hey awesome question! <br>  <br>  Thongs and panties are great but I honestly prefer booty shorts! They are hot!<br>  <br>  Since the question is only between those 2 only I guess I go for thongs panties are old school!<br>  <br>  Who is with me! =)|`|wJstSw9Daa	Depending on how the girl fits in them. If she has a booty, I think both would be great. If she has no booty just the panties. If she has a booty she can wear jeans anything.|`|meKSppblaa	Panties!|`|e913314056b0ff092cd25829149fdd7faa	Commando!!!<br>  <br>  Edit: For those of you who don't know, it means nothing at all.|`|V201Rrgnaa	thongs|`|pAwa23hEaa	Brasilian cut!!

xhqKLSwCaa	Your psychological response depends on your mental and emotional state as well as how you feel about the person who is kissing you. Psychologically, kissing someone you want to kiss will generally encourage feelings of attachment and affection. If you're kissing someone you don't like, or you're kissed against your will, your psychological response will be completely different.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  People in some cultures rub one another's noses or cheeks rather than, or in addition to, kissing. Anthropologists theorize that this "Eskimo kiss" grew from people smelling one another's faces much the way animals do. <br>  Your body physically reacts to being kissed. Most people like to be touched, and that's part of your body's response to kissing. But kissing also affects everything from your blood to your brain. We'll look at your body's biological reactions to kissing in detail in a later section.<br>  <br>  <br>  The culture in which you grew up plays a big part in how you feel about kissing. In most Western societies, people are conditioned to, look forward to and enjoy kissing. The behavior of the people around you, depictions in the media and other social factors can dramatically affect how you respond to being kissed.|`|ronomgTIaa	Well when you kiss the right person you see sparks. Kissing is fun. Also it can lead to other fun activities.
wJstSw9Daa	With time you'll get over him. That's really the only way, if you try getting with another guy you'll just feel bad or something. TIME.|`|oYMgaBNraa	find someone new to like probably someone that lives somewhere around you|`|6iCVElTdaa	This person is right, time is a solution... but there is one more, replace him, that is the only true cure, find sombody else.. trust me i have gone through same thing... met a girl on a cruise ship, fell in love with her, i mean true love and her me..    just find sombody to replace her that is really the only way
a0S75L1faa	just causually say something im sure once you convince him your ready he'll be more than happy to oblige, but this is a big step so make sure your ready you cant take this back and i wouldnt until your married but i wont preach.|`|FdGBJdU9aa	Isabella, You are only 16, is he the one or will you both eventually grow tired of each and move on? Have you really though about the consequences of having sex in your teen years. Do you understand your body and know safe sex and birth control practices? Think about it. once you have given up your virginity it's gone for ever.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	you didn't say how old you are|`|19JkC34Xaa	Awww...I think that's sweet. =] You could just be like "Baby, I really appreciate you waiting to have until I'm ready...and...I'm ready" =] Good luck with all that. Remember that the first time is always a bit awkward but I *promise* you its totally worth it. =]<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Ignore Dakota. People like her are always trying to make unmarried people feel guilty about something that's total natural and part of life. Sex isn't dirty or something to be ashamed of and you're not too young, as long as you think you're ready. Just be safe.
3H5zhdL7aa	Alright you got two options, come clean and apologize or try to lie your way out of this and take them down with you.<br>  <br>  Option 1 : When you talk to the teacher, before the conversation even gets going just say, I am completely sorry for what I have done and regret it...I just don't know what I was thinking. It was a big mistake and I am truly sorry for it, please forgive me.<br>  <br>  Option 2 : If the teacher just tries to bust you just mention that she had called you ugly and in order to stop her you put the piece of wool on her head. (and maybe even lie a little and say that you begged her to stop and she still called you ugly) and then her best friend started saying mean things to you that had really hurt your feeling so as self defense you told her to shut her big mouth, but once you did she stopped being mean to you. Also mentioned you apologized.<br>  <br>  You got to choose one or the other, you can't go with both and change your story half way through. I know what your going through, I was quite the trouble maker when I was younger and I either lied myself out of it or just came clean.|`|zGQt7sAOaa	you should just let silly stuff like that go. in the long-run of things, small stuff like this wont matter. next time anyone calls you ugly just roll your eyes and let it go. because chances are you arent ugly and the girl is just jealous. dont let little argunemts become big things. overcome it and be more mature by ignoring it.|`|ytGaDM7Haa	you don't sound 18. but, give me a break, how much trouble are you going to get into for calling someone a silly name.|`|FnMFoIyiaa	how old are you?|`|3y0w1qIBaa	The best situation for you is to come clean with your teacher.  Also, you may want to tell the teacher that this girl called you ugly and that's what started this whole conflict.|`|BCgp7GTpaa	just apologize to the teacher and then dont talk to those girls anymore.|`|dT8tbGrLaa	LOL how old are you dude?<br>  <br>  <br>  i wouldn't worry about it at my school ( im in grade 9 btw) people swear in front of the principal.<br>  <br>  seriously maybe the teacher will tell you not to do it again and that's it big deal.|`|aJRP6WWYaa	If the teacher ask about it just explain what happen and that the other girl overreacted.|`|VYS1VfFXaa	Get over it.  You should have punched her in the face.<br>  <br>  Seriously, this is nothing.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	Just say that she called you ugly first
Wo5Ezmwiaa	It's fine that you didn't go up and talk to her. More than likely, she could have seen right through you and she would have been able to tell you felt awkward and that you were thinking she looked weird - and that would have embarassed her and made her upset. I know if I didn't feel good about myself and felt embarassed of my appearance, I woudn't want any guy looking at me. So from her point-of-view, she's probably really glad you didn't see her when she looked her worst. Plus, she asked you not to look at her. You just obeyed her wishes. So all-in-all, yes, I'd say you did the right thing. From a girl's standpoint, I wouldn't want any guy looking at me when I looked all sickly and weird. We always want to look our best for the opposite sex.
RILRurzpaa	alright hun.<br>  this happens all the time.<br>  and it always ends up the same.<br>  if you dont do anything, your going to be unhappy for a very long time. <br>  obviously, she likes you alot more than you like her (sanja).<br>  if chelsea is available, then go for her.<br>  dont drop everything for her, for in the end you may end up with nothing.<br>  see if chelsea likes you.<br>  sanja sounds like a better friend than a girlfriend.<br>  i know you dont want her to hate you,<br>  but what worse,<br>  having one person possibly despise you for most likely a short period of time? or never being able to have the girl of your dreams.<br>  <br>  im sorry if i didnt help.<br>  xx good luck.|`|eXhToIS4aa	if you liked chelsea then why the hell are you dating sanja?!<br>  just tell her gently, you gotta break it to her<br>  just be like sorry but i wanna be friends<br>  something like that<br>  you have to break up with her|`|2wabQow8aa	There's no way to break up with somebody and not hurt their feelings. What's the use of being with somebody if you don't have those kind of feelings toward them. Break it off before it's get more serious because then it could hurt her more.|`|Fmu1j3ruaa	let sanja down softly.  take the straightforward route and tell her you don't want to go out with her anymore, or just say that the relationship isn't going anywhere or something.<br>  <br>  and another thing, don't break up with sanja then be all over chelsea the next day...that's just wrong.|`|qxiK2rjtaa	u really shouldntve settled for second best if u were goin for somethin better but juss be easy on her or try not to be touchy feely at all for like a month so itll be easier on her
FBUEi2Pnaa	hi everyone|`|AA11982696	Being official.|`|7OuNY2q9aa	BF = Boyfriend<br>  GF = Girlfriend<br>  <br>  Hope i helped|`|TVg25seaaa	I think that the definition of a bf and a gf is having everyone know that you are an official couple, actually dating, and going on dates. A first kiss does not mean you're bf and gf, but that would be good if you two are bf and gf and experience your first kiss together.|`|KTtf0GLlaa	knowing your boyfriend and girlfriend and if someone asks you do you have a girlfriend you say yes ... ask each other weather you would classify your self as dating|`|qDII8luraa	Public and open about an affectionate relationship between two people.|`|VYZOFZ7Faa	Umm making it official. Going on dates. I don't know doing couple stuff?
FBUEi2Pnaa	Kiss him already it wont kill you|`|kW4mC5yvaa	RELAX!  It's really not that bad(:  Just close your eyes, and you'll love ittt, trust me!|`|YVeZ8K6haa	I was in the EXACT situation when I was 14. Seriously my boyfriend dumped me because I was too scared to kiss him. I would just go for it, and have fun :] But don't get crazy! ;] just kidding!|`|AA11982696	just lean in and give him a soft kiss on the lips, basicall a peck.|`|FIXQXwtXaa	if you want to kiss just do it.its not bad.if you need to practice i nthe miror|`|3ByYhstxaa	tell him|`|G25VY8Anaa	just go for it,, what do you have to lose|`|i9421OOYaa	Okay, chill! He might get pissed off at you if you don't kiss him soon! Trust me, I just had this happen to me last week! No guy I know doesn't want to kiss his gf. Go on a date with him, like to a skating rink or the mall. [I don't really suggest the movies, to hard to make the move] When you just standing around with him, look him in the eye and get close to him, close your eyes, turn your head to the left and kiss. It realy isn't that big of a deal. Also, don't wear lip gloss, and pop a mint! [If you don't want him to see you do it, wear long sleeves, hide the mint in your sleeve or something, and then eat something small and take the mint in with it!] Try not to be nervous, because it really isn't that bad. When you are driving to met him, blast the music in the car and sing out you nervousness! It really works! Get excited! Good luck<3333|`|AA10119162	Being nervous is perfectly normal before a first kiss with someone you really like. Sometimes a tender kiss on the cheek can say the same thing as a kiss on the lips.|`|wJstSw9Daa	Just walk in front of him and smack one on him. Or start with a kiss on the cheek and move to the lips.|`|7OuNY2q9aa	Try 1 kiss before 2 kiss|`|fZ38PPgSaa	Just do it.|`|bZCSRu8Iaa	Hey don worry... kiss him|`|AwXDBoASaa	just do it.|`|1xJYTRVXaa	wait 4 the right moment cus u might ruin ur relationship u will know wen the time is right
GqhtePhgaa	It could just be that the novelty has just worn off.
2BcK2pvJaa	I would like to hear that she has been missing me.Most men are not going to admit it first so If you don't then It will go unsaid.|`|aez3cIkvaa	If you broke up with him then you shouldn't mess around with him like that, telling him you miss him.  If he broke up with you, then yeah, just tell him you miss him and all that jazz.|`|DPkE9ho3aa	Tell him exactly how you feel don`t try and cover up your feelings because it will do nothing but complicate the situation more than what it already is!|`|3H5zhdL7aa	It really depends if you want to still hook up with them or not. If you want to choose the path and hook back up with him I highly suggest you say you miss him and every moment without him has been miserable (in a very sincere manner). I can assure you 99.9% of men would love to hear that from an ex and eventually end back up. However if you want to just keep it the way it is, I wouldn't go about by saying your perfectly fine but however just being rather friendly about the manner and just act as if you guys hardly went out before, treat him more as a friend than a boy friend.|`|ei0ooZF1aa	Ask him if you could hang out together and do something new that you haven't ever done before. Tell him you have a really fun idea and come up with something by wherever you live. I live in Minneapolis, so if my ex called me and asked if I wanted to go downtown to a new restaurant "my friends" had told me about I would probably go. That or ask if he would want to come over and cook something with you :-). Sometimes cooking together can bring out a romance. Just keep it light and fun. You have to remember that it's been months and he may have moved on. You just don't know but approach it by having fun. I don't know your relationship though. Hope I helped :-)
dtXzOGoKaa	his trying to annoy  you|`|5BOV76bmaa	I agree he's just trying to annoy you. All you have to do is turn the tables. ignore him|`|AQ3QqA5daa	beacause he's keeping his options open!! Screw him and block him first!! LOL|`|BaNrweQ4aa	maybe he wants to ignore you; but just to let you know something. he could actually want to speak to you and know where you are and things - but can't bring himself to. what has happened between you both? just keep trying to talk to him; (on msn) or just play him at his own game and start ignoring him too. he will speak to you eventually lol :)|`|2c4oLCOqaa	He's just doing it to make you mad.....i wouldnt say anything to him.. if he reallly didnt wanna talk to you or hear from you he would of by now... just back off and dont say anything he'll eventually stir up a conversation|`|oJTxk2cDaa	There could be any number of reasons, but perhaps you have annoyed him and this is his way of telling you to back off.
d4oD5Ptkaa	what the freak are you thinking!? he hits you? he makes fun of you?! you got to mother f'ing kidding me! you should be done with him. take it from another guy! i have never hit a girl and never will. thats just wrong to hit a girl. but its ok if girls hit us guys. but guys hiting girls? no that unacceptable! tell me where he lives! i want to teach him a leason! hes not gonna lay a finger on your head.me and my possie are just gonna take a walk with him (just kidding i dont want to know where he lives, just don't let him hit you) he is whorthless trash. dont let him hit you!|`|td6WXhv4aa	Your boyfriend beats you and he makes fun of you but you love him to death? and to top it off you cheated on him that's not love.<br>  <br>  Let's get real as Dr.Phil would say (looking at you with a straight face)|`|kW4mC5yvaa	Your ffffuuuucccckkkkkeeeeedddddd.|`|FIG58FVpaa	You really should get as far away from both of them as you can. It's not right for your boyfriend to hit you EVER and you shouldn't have to put up with him picking on you and breaking up with you constantly.<br>  <br>  Plus since the guy you cheated on him with is one of his friends, it's not like you can start a relationship with him even if he wasn't a "player" and would date you.<br>  <br>  Dump your boyfriend and run!|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	your "boyfriend" if you can call him that, doesn't seem like a good guy, and your relationship isn't stable, so i'm sorry to say but i think you need to break it off and let him go. telling him about what you did with his friend might make it easier honestly. but don't mess around with that guy again either, it won't do anything for you.|`|G25VY8Anaa	why would you wanna be with a guy who hits you and makes fun of you? you need to get out of his life ASAPPPP! there are other guys out there just wait|`|VNRJnNr2aa	what we have here is a unwilling,uncommited relationship,the in<br>    and out and coming and going phases are short burnt out cycle <br>    of your relationship..<br>  <br>     This type of relationship is recreational...sometimes either side plays by the rules,some get hurt and some dont its just that some partners dont play by the rules..<br>  <br>    if there is hitting this means one of you are not listening and the hitting is the opening up to ones mind and soul meaning your emotions or the heart..if this happens then one of you have to lower your defenses this is the reason why your relationship partner comes and goes or break-up and make-up because of the tension is too great<br>   on the relationship..there is no remedy for this relationship because its a relationship that no one has ever endured to resolve it..<br>   <br>    you must play on the deuces or court to survive the relationship..if he hits you then hit him back..this will take some of the stress out of the relationship|`|3wjOk0Saaa	Sweetheart.. If the guy hits you.. You should not be his girlfriend to begin with. What the hell is wrong with you? And now you feel bad.. Screw him. He doesn't deserve you anyway if he hits you. If it was me.. I would shove it right in his face that I got my rocks off elsewhere, and then tell him to go pound sand. CREEP. Any guy that hits a girl is GARBAGE!!!!!!|`|aez3cIkvaa	You like a guy who beats you and that you've broken up with 12 times?!  Get some sense in your head and end it already, stop going around him, stop talking to him, stay away from his finger bangin' friends.|`|oC8Ul5H6aa	Dump both of them.<br>  they sound like losers.<br>  you need a guy you can trust not a guy who is rue to you.<br>  you have to do it girl! its tuff but ya'll live|`|mOpODbdsaa	Well, its not good to cheat, but you were in an abusive relationship already.

From what I read, you sound like a pretty honest person (up until the cheating thing) and you don't deserve to be abused by your boyfriend. Also, if you love him that much and he still hits you, HE doesn't deserve someone like you who stuck with him through everything. And about the cheating thing, any man who doesn't want a relationship isn't worth the time. I mean, he's probably made out with more girls than there are chickens on a farm. You don't have to be one of them. You can be "The One" if you choose to be.
5eBXB9lKaa	I had almost the EXACT same thing happen to me.  There was this guy who I was starting to be friends with.  He invited me over, and at one point tried to make a move on me.  I told him I just wanted to be friends, and it seemed like he was O.K. with this...however, after this he never talked to me again.  When I would attempt to initiate conversation with him, he was rude.  To this day, I have no idea why. The funny thing was that I actually kind of liked him, but just wanted to take things slow...until he started deliberately blowing me off.<br>  The conclusion I came to was that he thought he would get laid, and when he didn't, he had no further use for me. But through this I found out he wasn't someone that I wanted a relationship with, let alone a friendship.<br>  So the guy that you were kinda sorta friends with? I'd say don't even try to talk to him anymore. If he really cared about you as a person he would still be trying to talk to you.<br>  And if he really liked you, the fact that you have a boyfriend wouldn't stop him, trust me.
F08qx2hgaa	Hm... there's no way that you can ask tonight? Tonight would be fine.<br>  <br>  Ask a girl if she wants to hang out next weekend... on... hm... Tuesday seems good. That way, she has less of a chance of having plans already made. <br>  <br>  If you're just asking a girl to the movies or the mall of something, it's not too late to ask her tomorrow. *shrug* My friends do it to me all the time. We make plans the day before to hang out the next day.|`|AA11425983	Friday is a little short notice. but you can ask her if you want. But for future references, I'd say ask her on Wednesday.|`|5LKjemF8aa	asking a girl to hang out over the weekend is fine on a friday, but she might already have plans<br>  you should ask her on a thursday that way she has time for you|`|1qkdHe8jaa	sure! but careful, since friday is soon, she might have made plans. aske her bout next week.

oST5QRC4aa	Nope. She may never pick up on your subtle hints. If you are unsure or have a hard time reading her signals than you might try some subtle hints just to test the water. But eventually you need to be straight forward and tell her. Be honest with her and just tell her how you feel. Be prepared for the worst though. Trust me, I'm going through it right now. I told a girl how I feel whom I though felt the same way and it went wrong. I spooked her and now I'm dealing with the silent treatment trying to figure things out in my head. But remember this bit of advice. Would you rather hurt for a few days if she rejects or or hurt for a lifetime wondering "what if I told her how I feel, what would have happened?"

Be upfront about it. There is no way you can ease your way into this one. It cant be done. No baby steps. Take a giant leap. <br>  <br>  Dont the two of you belong together? Doesn't she need you in her life just as much as you need her in yours. You better go get her. One thing about girls- they are like eggs and bacon. They go really quick. Don't wait too long. She's gonna be with someone else and your gonna be crying in bed and talking to yourself "Why did I wait so long?"<br>  <br>  Bottom line. Be a man. You are going to college. Your gonna have a good job someday. You will be capable of supporting a family. You deserve her. She'll probably say no when you ask her. This is to be expected. Dont get down. You know why? Cause after she says no, shes gonna be thinking about you all day. Shes not gonna sleep at night. And after that, she'll turn over and say yes.  But not until you ask her first. <br>  <br>  Be a man, man. You have my best wishes.|`|hPjPtno0aa	i think if i was B i'd be thinking the same thing as you except that maybe you don't think of her like that at all because you asked about A.<br>  I think you and B could be great together 100% but you will have to be very careful as i'm sure neither of you will want to lose your friendship.<br>  I would say to B casual maybe when your just hanging out just slip in "Do you think we can be more than friends?" If she has a slight possitive response then you can suggest maybe testing the theory however if it's negative then you can say i was just wondering if we're getting married then slip a wink.<br>  <br>  You can't lose<br>  <br>  feel free to message me and tell me what happens ;) lol|`|5BOV76bmaa	Matey, just be straight with her. tell her how you feel.<br>  & as for the dinner thing its normal if you are good friends.|`|92yiQo7uaa	I am sorry to say that you have a few things working against you--(1) You have known B too long without doing the nasty. More often than not this puts you into the "friends" camp and that is deadly. The girl looks at you as a trusted "friend" and while your horndog hormones rage on she dreams of some stud without giving you a second thought. This is a problem area for you.<br>  <br>  (2) Having meals together doesn't mean squat and believe me if it did I'd been the champion doing the nasty. I have tons of meals and no sack time ever emerged. <br>  <br>  (3) Being her dreaded "friend" and having a few meals means you have been unfortunately put into the godawful category of her "buddy" and this is a dead end. <br>  <br>  My prediction: You'll not bed her.

You follow through with those consequences. <br>  <br>  Our kids knew that when we said something, that was it unless the circumstances changed. They and their friends knew that if they kept asking their friend's parents, they would eventually give in. They ALL knew if they kept asking us, there was NO possibility.<br>  <br>  We explained to our kids that we will keep them on a reasonably tight "rope". We will release it bit by bit as they mature so they can grow their "wings" and fly. If they fall, we will pull it in a bit, till they grow a bit more. <br>  <br>  We will always be there for them, no matter what, so we need to be kept in the picture. If they overstep the boundaries they will lose our trust, and they NEVER will want that to happen. It did, and they hated it. They each said it was the worst time of their lives, not being trusted by mom and dad.<br>  <br>  We have a close family, with great kids who quite often would rather spend time with us in preference to going out with their friends.

HKkbqlIuaa	I'm not interested, but I have done this before. I can understand not wanting to do it with someone you know, but I wouldn't make it a one night fling. I would recommend getting to know the person a little better. I tried a "blind threesome" once, and it wasn't half as much fun as doing it with someone you are at least a little comfortable with. For some reason, if you've been around that person a few times, you are more attuned to their personality, which makes sexual relations easier and better. Well, sorry I'm not interested, but I hope you find the person you're looking for!|`|PJZRGsc3aa	right....read what site we're on.

HKkbqlIuaa	As for the future thing, the only advice I can really give you is to enjoy the time you have left. If you spend it all worrying about when it's over, you're going to miss out on some of the best parts of it! As for the best friend thing, I was in the same situation a while back. You should really tell him how you feel. Also, just because he tells everyone he doesn't like you, doesn't mean anything. Believe my current fiance and I did the exact same things. We both swore up and down that we were JUST FRIENDS and never going to be anything more. A few years later, and we're engaged! =] Lol well good luck with everything! I hope it works out for you.
ia2Ncw0taa	don't think about it it comes naturally :) if you really want to know youtube it its hard to explain|`|RvSHQtrXaa	Kissing is like magnet.  Emotions alone without even a talk can drag you on the lips.  <br>  <br>  Be careful also Herpes are carried this way.  Make sure you know him and his lifestyle before giving a lip.|`|wrhi24jTaa	uhhm u kinda just follow what he does then once you get the hang of it u can take control :)<br>  <br>  to start out you can put one or both of your hands on his shoulders facing him and right when your going to kiss make eye contact. if it creeps you out just look at his lips until yours and his finally meet. aim for the bottom lip and just peck it slowly as if you were going to give him a normal short kiss.<br>  <br>  Instead of backing away you lightly suck on it and while your doing his bottom lip his going to be doing your top lip.  When you turn faces try to switch to the upper lip. *haha make sure you dont pump noses*<br>  <br>  like when you suck on a lolipop but you want to do it gently. Dont use tounge on your first kiss that is overkill.  You can move on to tounge later.<br>  <br>  haha the first time i kissed my bf i started giggling so did he it was just so funny<br>  <br>  so i guess if you laugh it wont kill the moment just continue<br>  <br>  if its at school just make sure teachers are not around x)|`|BZVlzAywaa	help me too!<br>  i have no clue|`|kyWzKFi8aa	you put your tongue in his mouth,dummy!|`|mKULeVN4aa	umm..<br>  try wikihow.com<br>  or youtube<br>  u cant rlly explain that|`|Fl6u3RDNaa	try wispering "who" into the palm of your hand!

XgdxeKRMaa	ugh!! i have the exact same problem just ignore him for a while and if he doesn't talk 2 you hes not worth ur time
kQgvhzB5aa	well it comes naturally to be honest. <br>  Like the more you make out the better you get. Just know that when you make out with someone dont make it akward. Just peck them on the lips and then from that open your mouth and they will do the same and like play with their tongue. Juts dont slobber or stick your tongue to ffar. It comes natuarally, everyone has their own way. Dont woryy (:
SmNFiTkbaa	I'm 13 too. Not to get you down, but I hear this excuse a lot. Many of my friends have gotten dumped by their boyfriends because their parents didn't approve of a girlfriend at the time. It turned out it was a bunch of crap. However, there is the possibility that he was telling the truth. It's just weird that he won't talk to you and that he ignores you. It seems to me that if he truly liked you he would at least try to remain friends. Its even sketchier that his mom approved of the girlfriend thing before. Watch for any signs that he is embarrassed by talking with you, like he doesn't want his friends to see. I wouldn't prod him, just let him talk to you when he's ready. If he doesn't seem to be making any progress towards talking to you, I would move on. Sorry and I hope I helped.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	I imagine his mother objects to "one girl" for him at this age. I rather agree with her.

e8e92e68ad36bd1f8ef519d59f0b913daa	Awww this is a prime example of the first stage of liking someone. He is so diggin you girl and I think when yall talk just tell him how you think things should work out. He will eventually ask you to go with him. Trust me I should know.LOL|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	yes u r special and he lyks u.<br>  <br>  i mean the pencil game?? lots of boys do that 2 da 1s they lyk.<br>  <br>  start a convo...mayb w/ hi......or about next year n if he is lookin forward 2 it.watz 4 lunch 4 school 2day. homeworktv shows, school things, activitys, hobbies...ect..<br>  <br>  it can go on for a whole long time|`|03d02ccfb35b78c46d0906cedf98349daa	you don't have to ask a guy if he likes you, reading someones actions can be a very clear indicator. and yes, he seems to be interested in you. And don't put to much pressure on yourself to start a conversation, that's his job in my opinion, just keep playing little flirt games and it will eventually lead somewhere, no rush :)|`|KJWd7q1Saa	yes , he really likes you .you have talk with . if you also really like him than forget Good or bad way .just tell him <br>  <br>  <br>  i like you  or i love you|`|XmxN58XCaa	you're special alright.|`|lnzeM1m0aa	well if you two havent talked he just wants to do you.|`|vDNJhGU2aa	Haha. That's so cute. You can totally tell that he likes you sweetheart. If he even dares to try to make "games" like that you can totally tell. He probably wouldnt do that to someone ugly...so you are definately "special". <br>  You should try to make a convo but just dont talk about something retarded. If your too shy to ask him out, have a friend do it, or ask if he likes you. That always works without all the emberassment!|`|B0y9aO1Laa	Of course he likes you.  The staring and the way he jokes with you tells it all.<br>  <br>  Just ask him what he thinks about last nights homework or if you could borrow his notes from the second class you guys have together.  That's always a good opener because you both are in the same classes.|`|NbnknEb0aa	I think he probably likes you.  If you're too shy, you could get one of your friends to ask him who he likes or if he likes you.<br>  For conversation starters, you could ask a casual question like what he did this weekend, or if he thought a test was hard.<br>  hope this helps!|`|7minC5Evaa	Lmao what does a pencil have to do with if he likes you... and staring at someone doesnt always mean u like that person, u can stare at them even if u thinking (oh that girl is uuggggly) I think 50% he does and 50% he dont.|`|N8wjemENaa	Omg your just like me!<br>  Well, people tell me that when a guy plays those kind of games with you, its either he likes you and wants your attention, or he is just bored and wants your attention.|`|Kc7dbcB7aa	He definitely likes you<br>  flirt back and see if he will try to et closer to you<br>  if he does he likes you|`|7RO4Pxeaaa	sounds like it to me<br>  rule of thumb-if you think somone likes you, then they like you
0pGHEctIaa	i don't think she should date him cuz 14 is alot younger then 16 and he might take advantage of that (if he's that kinda guy, i dont know). if it comes up tell her how you feel. and if she does decide to date him (if he wants to date her) make sure she's happy and safe and that's all you can really do.
EB4bakByaa	I'm in college and in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend too. Times can get busy and a little rough. We did end up going on a "break" a while back. And we both truly loved (and still love) each other. What I would suggest is go see him. If you talk to him face to face he knows that you really do care. Don't bombard him with calls/text's/e-mails. If you're not the type to go down and see him, give him a little bit more space and see what comes out of it. <br>  Now, if he really does love you, he will realize that you are sorry for what you said, and he will come back.<br>  <br>  The best things take time.<br>  <br>  i hope this helps!|`|CX0y66Puaa	If you feel he still loves you i think you should go see him face to face. <br>  Time heals most things but not all so rmember that your feelings should matter also. 1 week of ignorance is more than enough time,

But sadly i think like me, he lost trust in you, so you better go all out on it, because actions speak louder than words. <br>  <br>  P.S. I think you caused him enough pain for him to forgive you|`|fLvzhAX8aa	Wow, 3rd time?<br>  After the 1st i prolly wouldnt forgive my girl unless she had a legit reason.|`|kxmxJXEGaa	Hun, you cheated on his 3 times. <br>  <br>  3 times you hurt him as much as a girl can hurt a guy and it didn't matter to you because you keep doing it.<br>  <br>  You know how to make it up to him?  Leave him. Give him a chance to find a decent girl to share his life with. One who can share his love and someone that he is enough for.<br>  <br>  That someone will never be you. You don't need him. You don't know what you need except you are afraid of being alone and that is just not a good enough reason to jack up someones life.|`|1gS6osqoaa	ask him what you can do.<br>  you could also do something like make a sign and hang it on your care,or his, or at the skool. It might mean a lot that you did something public...you need to be honest with yourself when you answer the obvious question-why did you cheat??|`|Zqby1cXpaa	plz just let him go if you really do love him you would'nt want to hurt him cause when your cheated on by someone you love it is one of the worst feelings I am being serious dont break his heart anymore if you love him an your not selfish you would let him go

TPud8FMFaa	pretty/cute -- more innocent looking, but attractive<br>  <br>  hot/sexy -- high sex appeal, brings a tingling sensation to my pants<br>  <br>  beautiful -- drop dead gorgeous,  i'm intimidated by her she's so good looking|`|yt2zVOZfaa	Cute: A respectable term for saying a girl is good looking.<br>  <br>  Pretty: More like saying the guy likes her. (She's really pretty)<br>  <br>  Hot: First glance judging. Nice boobs, butt, and face but dresses sort of slutty. But it could also mean other things, for example when you are in a relationship, you call your girlfriend hot because anything else would probably offend her.<br>  <br>  Sexy: Everyone has different perceptions on what is sexy and not. So it's a kind of different for everyone.<br>  <br>  These are my definitions/opinions.|`|6HBlHO8Faa	i think of cute as somethin u would tell a little girl wearing a flower sundress..and pretty can be taken the same way too<br>  <br>  usually when guys use hot/sexy they refer girls who have nice bodies like big booties and/or boobs...i really dont take that as a compliment cuz guys tell me that when i go out to the clubs<br>  <br>  beautiful means natural beauty...like if ur wearing sweats and no makeup one and guys still says ur beautiful...HUGE COMPLIMENT|`|SnqsDt1Caa	pretty.cute more friendly term<br>   <br>  hot/sexy kinda less respect<br>  <br>  and beautiful the best thing a guy can say|`|AGXk7TTWaa	ok im a girl but i think i've got this down pat lol<br>  pretty/cute: they're talking about your face<br>  hot/sexy: theyre talking about your body. for example, someone could have a hot body and at the same time not be pretty<br>  beautiful: talking about the girl as a person, not just a face, not just a body, but a person. I think it's really rare to hear a guy say that and if you hear it, you're a lucky girl. :)|`|NSwkUNb1aa	here's my honest ranking:<br>  <br>  Pretty/cute-one in the same, mostly taking about the face of a shorter woman<br>  <br>  Hot-physically attractive, bangable, may go out with you a couple times<br>  <br>  Sexy-really attractive (physically, and emotionally), could be my gf<br>  <br>  beautiful-wouldn't mind spending the rest of my life with you|`|mP6naFLDaa	pretty and cute (to me) are the same but sexi is to darogatorie to me I wont call a woman sexi because thats just saying she's easy and beautiful means your really pretty and you have a great personalitie and thats something you should allways want and cute means your attractive|`|v5Ta04Mtaa	Pretty/cute - Good relationship material, reliable.<br>  <br>  Hot/Sexy - The guy thinks you look good, Can be good or bad because alot of the time guys dont stay with the sexy/hot chicks.<br>  <br>  Beautiful - The guy is really into you. Good relationship material|`|OCTvfDsxaa	If a guy says your cute-not bad. If a guy says your sexy-he wants you sexually. If he says your beautiful-he thinks your amazing and he wants you all to himself.|`|wMtB4vixaa	Pretty/cute = you're nice to look at.  Hot/sexy = he wants to rip your clothes off and sex you.  And beautiful = the woman is a work of art.|`|bdade993e630dbc15f1df344277bad03aa	depends on the context. He might be joking around as a friend, or into you. I'd usually call someone that playfully because I'm into them.|`|JuGH3Rowaa	because its like a scale of how good looking some one is its like a compliment.|`|wlmdOxAuaa	Theres huge different meanings to these words, and probably vary from man to man, but here's my interpretation:<br>  <br>  Pretty - Person is nice to look at.<br>  <br>  Cute -  Person is fun to look at, almost immature.<br>  <br>  Hot -  You want to do that person<br>  <br>  Sexy - Revealing some skin, nice curves, always dressed up.<br>  <br>  Beatiful - You want to look at the person all day long, or perfect|`|hAH0fmhVaa	Its not a range you twat.<br>  <br>  Basically all it is, is an insight into how much effort he wants to put in.<br>  <br>  If your HOT, he just met you on msn.<br>  <br>  If your BEAUTIFUL, He might actually just care.|`|6ZlgdUmIaa	cute is like a dog,<br>  beautiful is lookign sofisticated , nice, clean,<br>  sexy, hot is like almost slutty but not there yet|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	You missed out "fwoar!"|`|jeHTjvbaaa	Cute/Beautiful means there's an actual attraction, personality and looks.  <br>  <br>  When your called Sexy/Hot it usually means there is A LOT of sexual attraction...

ZIyZRGftaa	It can work out forsure. I was (and currently am) with my boyfriend for 4 years and then he decided he didnt want to be with me, he didnt love me anymore, it was devastating, we were high school.  We split for 6 months, we did the typical hook up thing then stopped talking really for a month or so completley.  He came back and told me he made a mistake and wanted to work it out, we've been back together for 4 months now and are happier than ever. sometimes people need time apart, need to figure out what they want, if it is real they come back.|`|YkzPfyp2aa	I've known of people who have gotten back together after breaking up and it worked out.

JW1RVr1aaa	Of course, there is always a possibility. A good way to find out is to: <br>  -ask his friends if he likes you<br>  -if he messes with you like throwing little things at you, he probably does like you.<br>  -Ask HIM...haha the climax of it all! if you DO ask him, just say your just wondering....there are a lot of ways of finding out.<br>  good luck!

Just ask him what's so funny...see what he replies.|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Joanna, he apparently has some interest in you, however, if he does not act any better than he is, I suggest that you just leave him alone and ignore him, until he comes to you.

Just stay hairy!|`|P38ULZbraa	Not all girls like that. I think you should think about what you want to do, why don't you wait until you have a girlfriend and ask her how she likes it. If you insist on getting rid of it tho, you should probably trim it, not clean-shave or wax it, it will probably get irritated and hurt if you do either. Good luck, whatever you do...|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Not all girls like a bare man's body. <br>  <br>  Maybe for you young people many of your girls do.<br>  <br>  For the older crowd, late 20+, more women find it as a turn off. <br>  <br>  Reminds us of little boys rather than men.

I've been to all sorts of "romantic dates" but not one has made me feel as special as he does. Not one has even made me feel as Loved as he does. And thats all that matters.

I mean honestly is it worth coming on here asking all of us for advice when you made it plain you don't want to leave  him..  he apparently thinks he can get away with it.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	So he TELLS you all he likes is the basic boring gets old fast sex, but he is telling the World Wide Web something completely different?  Hmmmm....One is a lie and I am thinking the lie is what he told you.  Seriously...you broke up once already because he wanted to screw not only someone else, but a MARRIED someone else?  He has already shown that he has no morals and obviously does like some sense of danger with sex (screwing a married woman-he could get caught by her husband????) so I think it is time for you to just pack up your crap and leave his sorry butt....|`|uetenAeRaa	good luck.  let me know how this round works out.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Again - SO WHAT?

GUYS LIKE THAT ARE HARD TO FIND THESE DAYS. I THINK ITS GREAT TO KNOW THERE ARE A FEW GUYS OUT THERE STILL THAT HAVE THERE HEAD ON THERE SHOULDERS AND ITS NOT ALL ABOUT SEX.|`|AQPdi1KUaa	i hate admitting this, but i think most girls want a guy who knows what he is doing when doing the grown up. women are very special creatures who are not designed like men in any sense (sexually). it can be most difficult to please a woman. so in my personal opinion, i think it is more sexually alluring when a man has already had practice runs and knows what he is doing. on the other hand, there is no better way to learn what a woman really wants and desires until you are in a long term relationship with her. the best lovers i have had are always the ones who were in long-term relationships. i hope that helps.|`|AA11441704	amazing question.|`|dbQHlp85aa	Aboslutely... I would want him more than anyone else. <br>  <br>  I wish I knew you.. but i'm engaged :)<br>  <br>  Don't let anyone rush you.. and save yourself for that special woman. Even when you ask her to marry you.. still wait until after the wedding. It'll just be that much more special.
pfm0wcEIaa	Honestly, I just like to go for a walk.  That's it.<br>  <br>  But I think in your age range, dinner and a movie is pretty typical.  But you could go see a museum, or a play...Bowling is fun too, because at least you get to do something and get to know each other better.
3ILRBXlRaa	I'm just guessing here but it sounds like you met someone who's like a waitress, bartender or dancer?  <br>  <br>  The thing is they are nice to EVERYONE and if you think you are getting some sort of special treatment, I hate to tell you this, you're not.  <br>  <br>  They are like this to everyone.  They get numbers everyday and they have to smile and be polite because that's how they get their tips and extra cash.<br>  <br>  My advice to you, is to probably look elsewhere instead of this place to meet women.  Because, they only care about your money.  Meet a nice girl at church, school or your own job not one of these places.

We see a guy hanging around a lot of girls we think, "Hes gay or a player" Just act a bit more umm MANLY?<br>  <br>  1) if you want the girl to like you, lightly touch her sholder when your talking (sholder arm) whatever you plz. Look into her eyes while you talk, play with her hair just a bit while you two are talking too...<br>  <br>  2) Act more manly and less femanine...<br>  <br>  3) the way you confront her is, go up too her "Hi my name is [insert name here] and start talking.

I think that you could still do a lot together you could read to her watch movies and you could just talk to her let her know that you are there and your not going anywhere just because she's in that shape now is the time that she needs you the most.

You could push her.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	It's a life-changing event, and doing everything you can to remind her that she is still a valuable person despite her injuries is the most important thing you can do for her.    Be her hands. Do her hair, paint her nails, type for her on the internet, where nobody needs to know she's not able to do it for herself.    Enjoy a mammoth book or series together. Read aloud, a chapter a day (or more). Talk about it. Share excitement, disappoint, theories about what will happen next.    Remind her friends she's still around. They may be staying away because they don't know how to act. Show them.    Watch movies, or pick a favorite TV show and watch it together. See the entire works--*everything*--of an actor she likes, or an old TV show from beginning to end.    Give her sympathy, but not pity. She wants to be as much like everybody else as she can. A loving sister can help her achieve that goal.    If college is in your future, make sure further education is in her future, too. She can take courses online, or do all the reading and homework for the classes you take, for instance.|`|TaJWZ96paa	I assume that she can still speak so why not play some word games and things that will challenge her to keep her mind busy.     I do pray that God will bless all of you with a miracle  soon.

I didn't say anything to him because I didn't know him. Don't care, like how I didn't care, that is why when he looked in the classroom all my classmates were like "ew, he is ugly as hell" right in front of his face. Karma is a b****.|`|FHxegXZAaa	He's HER boyfriend, why does he have 2 like you???|`|f4Yec6iNaa	Ignore him, act non-chalant. He will not expect it lol.|`|Q9GFKzg3aa	ya i don't think there's much you can do. with my first boyfriend i hated like all of his friends and my friends ended up pissing him off (long story) so the only real happy people was us. it lasted about 2 months but because he moved to a different town the distance kind of broke us apart.
FfjyYHByaa	I say 'ima' ... I've never seen anyone spell it 'imma'
PaVyuYVUaa	of course it is. she can't be mad, well she can but she shouldn't, if you tell her the truth. when my best friend is mad at me i always want her to tell me because ignoring them and being mad and telling someone OTHER then the person ur mad at is stupid. if you really want this relationship ur going to have to work at it a little so tell her how you feel. if she's going to still be mad then i guess shes not worth it. and i no thats hard to believe and its hard to leave but if your the only one working its not worth it. i really hope you guys work it out. and i hope this helps.|`|hyBinAFJaa	yes i think you should tell her why u left but, if she's mad then she's mad she will probably get over some time. so i just say go with the flow. if she's mad with you then just give her some space and see how that goes.
ONWCXzUMaa	All I can say is just be careful, sometimes beautiful things have a black heart.<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|V8YlHXUAaa	WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN TO U?!!!!! GRRRR I'm so jealous! He probably thinks ur cute or sumthin. :D Just don't try anything... u don't want him to get arrested. Other than that, go for it!!!!! btw, try flirting w/ him & give me details!|`|J7oQV0zPaa	I hope he's not too hot!  Melted ice cream gets everywhere! lol|`|r6rcCTKHaa	^^^ LMAO! agreed :)|`|ySwnTzdsaa	If you're 14 and he's 20+ you need to hit up the cops.<br>  <br>  That's corruption of a minor at the least.|`|MwiBGBK1aa	haha this is amazing!<br>  The ice cream driver loved me as a kid... not in a sexual way though...|`|YwTbCihDaa	Same old Rocket Queen.*sigh*  Just crush don't actually do something, remember you are still a minor.
WFRooU7Maa	Ya that is a sign of flirting depending on when and how much it is done<br>  <br>  I would most likely take it as flirting, depending on how hard you hit<br>  or how you pushed and how long you are hitting|`|w5aVE1LUaa	It can be considered flirting. <br>  Some guys would probably think you are, others may not.|`|AcBPdvy3aa	yes. my friend does that ALL the time. it kindof pisses me off, not because im jealous. its just annoying to have someone always ALL over everything that has a d!ck. <br>  <br>  good luck. <br>  <br>  (my friends a WANNA BE whore) /: just sharing...|`|W2GcDwyOaa	That is flirting. As is the gentle nudge, punch and the occassion laugh and shove from the shoulder.
TJiGs8S4aa	It is always right to be civil, provided of course that you are not dealing with a stalker whom you are avoiding entirely.  You are taking the high road - that is a good thing.  Be polite, but you don't need to open the door to be his best friend or hang on his every last word.  You did the right thing.|`|jkL4K7otaa	honey just being friends with an ex is not giving him another chance i had an ex who broke up with me because i wouldnt have sex with him and i still talk to him because his family and i were close and he can still be a good friend i call him randomly just to check up on him make sure he is doing good in life
T4esqtuUaa	Well Kristina both sounds great but I think that (B) sounds better but it is your wedding and it is wonderful.On your first question I would just put that the reception will follow.Second question I would use the first names only that way its short and to the point. Your thirdquestion I would put Mr. & Mrs. Chad and Kristina. That sounds great. Good luck at your wedding|`|AA10975867	Second one. You are not married yet so the RSVP card can not say "Mr. and Mrs. Chad...."  the RSVP card is mailed back to you ahead of the wedding so it should be addressed to you, using your single name. The reception info can be printed on a separate card and enclosed with the invitation and RSVP card. As our reception is quite a distance from the church, we printed the reception info on one side and driving directions on the other side.|`|AA11312653	Sorry to be harsh, but you did ask for advice. Please get one or more of Miss Manners' fine and easy to read books as you need guidance in several areas. Do not trust the advice you get from Wedding Industry related sources such as magazines and web site, nor from vendors such as florists and printers. Miss Manners and Emily Post only want to sell you a book, not talk you into doing and buying things that are unnecessary, rude, counter productive, or just plain ridiculous merely for the sake of flattering you into buying things.|`|s30Duwdraa	Here, check out this website.  It should answer all you questions:    http://www.pulpandcircumstance.ca/pages/...|`|ofCRTXw9aa	I like the first one better.    I think you should put in your first & last names. But no middle name. Unless you like it? lol    On the RSVP, its really up to you. The most common however is using your maiden name.|`|sGP6s7uraa	I like the second one better.  It flows better.     "Reception to follow (place if there is one)" at the bottom of the invite.  Give place, address, and time.    That is totally up to you about names.    RSVP - just put your name with your maiden name and his name.      No wording help, sorry.|`|lcj1AKt1aa	I do not believe that you should put your daughter's name in there.    'Please join us as we, Kristina and Chad together with our Daughter Kaitlyn exchange our vows of marriage'.  This sounds like the three of you all are getting married.    if any thing I prefer the second one.  That sounds much nicer. The quote seems awkward but that is just my opinion.  It starts off referring to the bride and then the next line to the bridegroom.    You can say "reception following the ceremony at The Dining Club, Manor Lodge near Pricesmart.    At the bottom you can put, "RSVP by June 1, 2009.  telephone   or kisses @hotmail.com    I had used my full name    You have to put your maiden name    This was some I was looking at.  Please accept our invitation  to join family and friends in witnessing the sanctity of our love , devotion, and dedication to our new life.  We, My Whole Name and His Whole Name will be joined in holy union on June 26, 2009 at The Place at 2:00 in the evening.  reception following the ceremony at the Dining Club Manor Lodge near Pricesmart.

5r2Csdzwaa	So your wife caught you smoking some DOLTS bone did she?|`|sl8ffVHVaa	I wish everyone was as happy as you are|`|ByUS0k8waa	Well thats nice. Im glad your happy!|`|bYjercAqaa	Got caught cheating, did you?|`|fHfVRcqbaa	I think your wife is probably a really good lay.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	Great...|`|gfHutvEFaa	This was nice. Pretty refreshing after always reading about cheating, hitting, financial troubles, etc...    If this was true, hope it stays that way for the two of you!    If I wasn't true, then.......whatever.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	I threw up in my mouth a little bit there.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Until one of you has an affair that is.|`|vV77Pv1vaa	good for you, tell me again after 20 years of marriage, and what the hell is your question?|`|nWGgaQdhaa	i wish that there were more guys out there like you, she i s a very lucky lady. blessed be to you both.|`|DIx2ZD4Faa	Is there a question?    I think if you love her that much you  should be a better poet, That  sucked!|`|vLgbjmI2aa	Congratulations to you that you have found"the one".I feel the same way about my husband.He is my whole world and it is so nice to see that someone else feels that way about their spouse.She is blessed to have you and you are blessed as well.Dont take a single day for granted and make sure you tell her that you love her each and every day,;)|`|HwTMMVd7aa	Is there a question here?
GHnkKwl3aa	Girl, that means he's paying really close attention to you which means he's pretty into you. :P<br>  <br>  A guy looking deep into your eyes is really interested in you. A lot of guys aren't looking at a girl's eyes. And if they are, they're only looking on the surface of their eyes, not what's behind (philosophically - not the gooey crap inside everyone's head behind their eye :P :P).|`|VEEgoDkFaa	It means that when you look at him, he can tell that you think he's the hottest man alive.  Nothing wrong with that, it just means you haven't fooled him into thinking that you don't like him. He knows.  Trust. ';-)|`|ajgC0KPhaa	He's implying that he knows A LOT about reading emotions.<br>  <br>  He knows how your feeling about him.<br>  <br>  Reply to my question? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AinzwVQsVwT.H1baqD3FS9Xty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090212210557AAl3UEa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  .|`|QPKgc1xJaa	That means he wants to use you.
fP46meSmaa	You just have to move on and let him go if you can't have him.**
HwTMMVd7aa	Honestly, I think you really need to think about what's best for you. Anger problems generally escalate, and it sounds like he's doing his best not to do something he would regret, but one day you might do something to make him fly off the handle, without even realizing you're doing it.  The relationship you're in right now is not a healthy one. I think you should step back from it and take a look at it from the point of view of an outsider. The fact that you're even here wondering if something is wrong means that there probably is something wrong. My advice would be to take a break and really explore your options. Maybe there is someone out there who you'll find you like even more than him, but maybe not. I think you should just take a step away from everything and seriously think about marrying this guy.|`|l10h4yqeaa	I can't answer what is wrong with him, but I just wanted to tell you to take a step back and look at your relationship. Being the way it is Can you see yourself with this man for at least another 50years? I don't think you should have to question him, apparently you think there is an issue and sound worried about your current situation. You should be able to talk openly about anything with out being scared. The way you explain what is going on sounds like there is a problem and it worries me. Be careful and good luck|`|R2WxQ1cCaa	There is a reason your getting those feelings - they are called warning bells.      If you still doubt them sit in some battered women's shelter meetings and you'll hear they all felt the way you felt first.  Fast to anger, ignores you, but demands your sole attention.  It won't be long before he starts either making sure he alienates you from family and friends or insults you and you may not even know it's happening until your in a full depression and trying to battle your way out and have no one to help you because he has chased them all away and convinced them all its you not him because he's just so damn charismatic.    The thing about marriage is it is supposed to be about not having doubts ever again about your partner if you doubt him now what does the future say.|`|G2qc2k26aa	Have you put out? Well that's the best time to ask what wrong, because his defenses are down.  My mom says "you need to feed your man in 2 ways his stomach and some ***".  My husband says "us men are always in the mood and when it has been delayed so long our brain does not function well and are easily irritated by stupid things".  (prior to marriage)  My husband use to always get angry at a flip of a switch and would destroy things.( weired)  I  confronted him about and told him that he scared me, he looked stupid and ugly when it happened.  He did not believe me. One day he got very angry when I questioned his intelligence among his family ( something simple not bad ) and took a picture and showed it him.  He was shocked how ugly he looked and in disgust destroyed the picture and apologized.  Since that day he changed and clams himself down before it gets bad.|`|oc6mEU75aa	I KNOW IT MIGHT BE HARD TO DO BUT I THINK WHILE YOUR AWAY FROM  HIM YOU MIGHT START USING THIS TIME TO START  SEEING OTHER TO MAKE SURE THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT .HE NOT ONLY IS INSECURE BUT ALSO MIGHT BE OBSESSED WITH YOU ITS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE HE STARTS TO CONTROL YOU. RUN YOU WONT BE SORRY|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	First off it seems that you probably talk to much by reading the extensive narrative that you wrote just telling us whats the matter with this guy, thought that I was reading a short novel.  Second, you might need to go to the world wide web page .morefishesinthesea.com and start looking for another person as this person one day might be off his meds and do something to you that would not be nice like take you for a ride in this race car and get mad then wreak it just because.  You seem that you are a very nice person and can do a lot better than this mental case that you are with now. Darling, I truly wish you the best of luck.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	sounds to me he might have anger issues...  might want to help him with that!   that and lake of experience with inntimate relationships.. the more you have the more complex things and issues you expereinces the more you can hand stuff!|`|tX1Pt1HDaa	I would say DON'T GET MARRIED!! It will only get worse. find someone that you can REALLY get along with.|`|tsBL19qzaa	He has anger issues, need you see more. Drop him and move on.|`|JV0i77uiaa	This guy has a lot anger and frustration and is taking that against you.  If he does not get any help he will get worse and will ended up beating you.  Do you want you want to live your life like that?  I would get away from him.  Please don't married this guy, keep moving on.  He is in denial that he has the problem, that's why he is telling you "what's wrong with you.  Just imagine being married with this guy, I guarantee you is going to be hell.  Don't mind what's wrong with him, take care of yourself.  If he does not want to get help by this time after two women left him.  It's up to you if you want to live that kind of life.  God bless you and I hope you think about.|`|7ewzmiNEaa	Better to find this all out now instead of after marriage and kids.  You obviously are not inclined to stay with him.  Face up to it and move on, before it is too late.  Do you want to be back on here in a couple years telling us how bad life with him is?|`|5r2Csdzwaa	That DOLT is a queer!|`|5ViTUTyZaa	He is hiding something that he is afraid you will find out and he is insecure.|`|MuVKeK8faa	He has anger issues and will probably start beating you.|`|kTZevQNHaa	Savor the flavor cause if and when you 2 wed...it's gonna amplify...sounds like you two are not really set for this marriage or even maybe to be together...up and down with the moods in this relationship...add a kid into the equation and it's going to get even more dramatic...do you really want to live like that?|`|mwrSbSVuaa	Get out!  Get out!  Get out!  He sounds dangerous!!!  Like a firecracker waiting to blow.  This is how women get killed by their husbands.  The fact that he did some of this at his parent's home is a tell tale sign that scares me.  Is that how he was raised?  Learned behavior?  If you really want to try to make this work, suggest anger management classes, but talk to him in public about it.  If you have a bad feeling about this listen to yourself!  You may be 37 and him 31, but there is NO reason to be in a relationship like that.  He may not beat you now, but when you are married, you may be fair game.  STAY  SAFE!!!|`|lzooHi0Baa	Leave him, you don't need such stress and humiliation in your life.  Imagine he acts like this now when all should be a bed of roses.   If you get married, it will be worse.   I could never allow anyone to raise their voice at me.   They'll never see me again, not even in the afterlife.     Pick up your self respect and leave the jerk to some other insecure woman that he can feed off off.|`|1hpctY4saa	Trust your vibe.  God has blessed women with an incredible ability to see between the lines and to "feel" that something is not quite right.  There is a certain word for it, but I just can't think of it (probably because I am a guy).    Do not marry this man until you get to the root of the problem.  There is probably something else going on...just keep digging until you find an answer.  I recommend counseling.    If there is a problem, it will multiply after marriage.  It's hard to give you the perfect answer without knowing too many details...but just trust your judgement.|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	well to me, it sounds like he's going to get abusive if you get married. And I would call it quites if i were you.    From what you described is what most abusive men do when they want to charm their woman and once they gain controll they abuse neglect and belittle them.     For your own safety .. maybe just stay engaged for a long term engagement to see how he is. And if he pushes for marriage...  break up.|`|VOYSmwOXaa	he has anger issues he needs therapy! tell him that if you still love me then you won't yell or what ever else he does! take controll don't back down! If that doesn't work you might as well get a divorce! becuase he could really get mad and hurt you! you know! he needs help!|`|r1B0ZPylaa	I'm going to make this short and sweet.      break up now to save yourself time a trouble. UNLESS you want to spend the rest of your life with a guy that has anger issues. IT'S UP TO YOU..|`|1oAOrpVzaa	well obviously he has anger problems. you should try to do something that would sooth him to calm him down.|`|vV77Pv1vaa	the deal is, that hes not the one for you, keep looking or dont complain later on.|`|vMG6N7N1aa	In my personal opinion, i wouldn't get more involved. I think those things are warning signs. He may not have layed a hand on you yet, and he may never, but there is also emotional and verbal abuse. If he gets that angry, that quickly, something must be wrong. Its your call, but i wouldn't want to get into the relationship any further if he treated me like that.
SYKGIiQkaa	Its very normal. I really don't mind when I catch a guy checking me out, sometimes it makes me feel good.|`|zIoWCX7vaa	damnn we love it<br>  <br>  email me:<br>  <br>  waterpolome@yahoo.com|`|Qe9EULsdaa	If they are cute I get nervous, if they're ugly/creepy I get more nervous lol. But seriously, if they're cute and I'm attracted to them as well I'm usually thinking "well he's going to look at me, and then not approach me or even try to make it very obvious that he's even slightly interested." It never even crosses my mind to approach them because I think that should almost always be the man's job anyway. It also depends on the context/environment in which the guy is checking me out. I also often assume that he has a gf. Maybe he's assuming I have a boyfriend. I DONT KNOW.|`|5FCiKNaGaa	either "crreeper..."<br>  or if i like him or think hes cute then i will be like"yay, and belike at least i m not ugly :)"|`|1QGRIyaVaa	hmm...i think...is there something wrong with me! haha! but then im like...i guess i have something good that he likes! ;)|`|fioNl1k7aa	that's why we dress as we do, we want you to look........|`|1b1ZMpLYaa	Depends, I suppose. If she only caught you once, chances are she won't think much of it other than "weirdo..." If she catches you checking her out more than once, however, she'll be suspicious of your motives. "Does he like me? Was HE looking at ME?" etc.<br>  <br>  It also depends on whether you were checking out her face, her rack, her butt, or just her body in general. If it was her face, you might have a chance. If was any of the last three, forget about it.|`|cDue0jdDaa	Honestly?  I can't speak for everyone else but I can usually tell when someone is "checking me" out.  No matter how sly they think they are.  But what am I thinking?  I think "ALRIGHT!!" LOL  I mean it isn't a bad thing in my book.  I am seeing a guy who probably doesn't know that I know when he is making those side looks at me and including when he makes those looks to other women when we are out and about.  But we ALWAYS know. LOL|`|cd9108e5eefb19394649f6cb2d4535e1aa	I find it funny.<br>  Haha, this guy in my math class always stares at me, he sits behind me.<br>  And I can always feel his eyes on me - so I turn and smile at him.<br>  We're friends but it's flattering I guess but he doesn't do it in a creepy way so I'm not bothered.|`|OCTvfDsxaa	Lol. It depends on the way the guy was doing it. Sometimes it's a complement and sometimes it's an insult! I've been pretty creeped out by it before. I'm betting she took it as a complement.|`|JHo7g8vAaa	well i just think to myself "uh oh i hope he thinks im cute" or something<br>  ...the girl probably didn't really think of anything when you got busted|`|k7WUFZpvaa	Well ... if she didnt snub you than your cool. Though I would just play it cool until she checks back or tries to speak with you.|`|LGCTOxZxaa	If hes cute, we are like good! Maybe I should talk to him more. If hes not so hot, we are like ew, so and so just checked me out... Real Life lol|`|a7Iqk7Yhaa	I love it when someone checks me out, it makes me feel really pretty. Haha. Especially if the guy is hot
1xI9BWJtaa	Listen HERES THE BEST ADVICE. I always hear girls ask this. Guys do not like fattish girls with big breasts and ***. They prefer medium/smaller girls with average breast and ***. YOU WILL NOT LOOSE IT. You will loose the fatty parts and be left with a firm tight but that the boys will like. (Theres a difference between a woman with a big *** and a big *** woman lol)|`|3wjOk0Saaa	YES....... 2 points|`|ObVYg0iRaa	well chances are you will loose your "booty"<br>  if you diet and loose weight.<br>  as well as your "boobs".
XH2o1MM6aa	.He likes both of you and probably other girls as well.Don't confuse like with love.They are totally different emotions.I mean surely this isn't the only boy you like.
XwjMwcFjaa	you should get a different color on your hair not cut it and curl it up wear cooler clothes <br>  <br>  that my advice=) you'll look better and your cute though<br>  i will give you a 8.1|`|zIoWCX7vaa	woahh there hottie<br>  <br>  hello:)<br>  <br>  10+<br>  <br>  email me?|`|TPud8FMFaa	4|`|ijR3ygAJaa	Hmm you aren't bad-looking.

I'm not talking use a can of hairspray, two kinds of gel and make sure it's rock solid, but just something to make it look soft, touchable. Ya know? :]<br>  As a girl, I totalllly love that. :D<br>  <br>  But you're still adorable. 8 for you, love.|`|vtfKjWUAaa	woah, dud you shouldnt be pputting pictures of youself on here. there are like pedifiles and stuff. you look like you are 10 years old, but i'd rate you a 5<br>  xx|`|lBSt7jsNaa	Yhuur an absolute babeee!!! <br>  <br>  Can I have yhuur number???

HUGE TURN OFF<br>  <br>  =]|`|a5TJzrujaa	Just be yourself! I like a guy who has humor. Be yourself and relax
ajgC0KPhaa	The 2nd and 3rd paragraph do not prove that he likes you.<br>  <br>  The 1st paragraph might be a good hint, but it's still doesn't prove that he likes you. If he didn't think you were pretty, he would've definitely denied it when his friend spoke out. But just because a guy thinks you're pretty doesn't mean that he wants you to be his girlfriend.<br>  <br>  .
CLjTgZfIaa	hmm,youll notice a disgusted look or like "WHAT?!" look. ususally we do this to protect ourselves. most likey,since were in america they will probably be rude.|`|M0WypELtaa	a few things. They could simply tell you to get lost, or give u an excuse for them to leave.<br>  <br>  See girls have a ***** shield...and for a very good reason...Pretty girls get hit on constantly...They get hit on at work, the shop, streets and of course bars/clubs. They hear the same lines, the same speech from guys trying to sell themselves, or even worst begging or asking why they wont consider them...blah blah... <br>  <br>  Imagine doing this every week, every time you go out, multiple times in an evening. It gets tiresome.

They can be silly and teasing, with little winking faces. Not that 'Heyyy, it's so hott in my room. I'm wearing like, noo clothes right now' crap. That makes boys think you're slutty.<br>  <br>  Hang out with him, when you can. But don't seem desperate.<br>  <br>  Be genuinely interested when he's talking to you, but act like you don't care much when he's talking mainly to another girl.<br>  <br>  Look at him, and when he catches you looking, smile a little, lower your eyes to the ground, tilting your head down a teeeeny bit, and then glance back to his eyes, leaving your head down a bit so you're glancing through your lashes. BIG clue that you like him there. :]<br>  <br>  Etc.<br>  If you have questions, feel free to message. ;]

Just tell him the truth.|`|U53R1Bq0aa	I think he did have a good time, because if he didnt he would not have bothered to text you. He might be wondering whether or not you had a good time. It might be that he likes you and enjoyed himself, and was just wondering about you...Tell him the truth, if you had fun let him know that! It'll be a cue for him to continue your relationship!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|HdSaN24caa	you people are UNBELIEVABLE.|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	He wants to know if YOU had a good time. He is just wondering if he did a good job as your date. If you say yes, then he knows you like him and he will most likely ask you out again. If you say no, he won't ask again.<br>  <br>  Just be honest with him, if you had a good time just tell him.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	He's finding a way to talk to you after a few days and wants to know if you had a good time.<br>  <br>  Tell him you had a good time and ask him what has been up to this week?|`|Sv62SsxXaa	where did you get the idea he didnt have a good time.. he just asked you if YOU did..<br>  <br>  stop overthinking things.<br>  text him back YES or NO!<br>  <br>  lol its simple!|`|qHiBm3q7aa	haha yes you are overanalyzing it. text him back. If you liked the date tell him honestly how you thought the date went. If you didn't text him that you think that you would be better off as friends. If he is texting to see how the date went it means that he truely cares to know if you enjoyed it. good luck :)|`|gpxcUtL1aa	It means he wants to know whether you had a good time.<br>  <br>  Guys are nervous and self-conscious too. Basically, he's trying to gauge whether you're into him or not.<br>  <br>  If he didn't have a good time, he wouldn't be curious whether you did.<br>  <br>  If you're into him, tell him you had a great time and ask when you can do it again. If not, just tell him thanks for the dinner or whatever, and leave it at that.|`|vXXDzBaKaa	No thats not what he is saying. He is simply asking you if you enjoyed his company when yall went on the date. Answer the question.|`|URoLA0xKaa	If you had a good time tell him you did. Don't over think it.

I think most guys do, and it sucks to say the least. In my opinion she knows you like her and she really likes that feeling. A lot of people are selfish like that and will string people along just to know they have admirers. <br>  <br>  If she were interested, she'd take your calls. Trust me! <br>  <br>  Look at it this way- If she texted you the way you text her, you'd return a missed call right from her right?<br>  <br>  There is never any shortage on guys for girls in college, and with you its out of site, out of mind. <br>  Its easier said than done, but try to move on. Dont think about her, because she isn't thinking about you! The best satisfaction is seeing her reaction when you find a new hot girl. <br>  Good luck. We all need it.|`|319f68749e1561bec57a3eb18244e1e3aa	It take 3.768 weeks to move on to a new guy....<br>  <br>  I mean seriously, there is no formula here. If she finds someone she likes, she will move on. If she likes you, she won't. How about you just meet her for some coffee or something, and actually talk to her, asking these kind of questions here won't get you any helpful answers.<br>  <br>  Instead of being stalkerish and asking where she is on campus, how about you ask her if she would like to meet you somewhere (public), to hang out. That is a lot less creepy.

z9k2TUcbaa	You two are still young and have plenty of time to spark up an intimate relationship. <br>  <br>  Tips?<br>  1) Be patient, don't make it obvious that you're trying to get him to like you<br>  2) Spark up conversations. *Key*<br>  3) Hang out here and there, preferably just the two of you if you trust him, for example- the movie theatre...or maybe even just to hang out after school :)<br>  <br>  I put *key* under conversing with one another because it's a great way of building a solid relationship...it's also fun and exciting, you get to know each other more as well, which is important in getting into a serious relationship.<br>  <br>  Like someone said earlier, he seems like he's playing it safe. Obviously you make him happy which is really good.<br>  <br>  I strongly suggest you start talking to him a lot more, and just let time work itself out and see what happens.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)<br>  <br>  *edit: "If a guy likes you, he'll make it happen.<br>  Just be cool and do your own thing, dont wait around and obsess over it."<br>  <br>  While some guys may make it seem that shyness is never a factor for them, there are the masses that always kept their opinion to themselves. People who never found the confidence to talk won't talk until they find the motivation.<br>  <br>  If you talk to him first, you can become his motivation to open up, understand the process? :]<br>  <br>  Again, good luck ^_^|`|1A1ozEaKaa	we all would like a guy to sweep us of our feet or like admit his eternal and undying love Notebook style in the rain, but trust me, that never happens.

I was similar. U gotta make it pretty clear u like him for him to respond to u.|`|AcBPdvy3aa	this isnt much help, buttttt that sounds adorable(: <br>  <br>  uhmm.. keep talking to him. but dont get clinging. just when you see him smile, and keep walking. if he wants to talk, he'll say something. when he texts you first, thats a GREAT sign, he likes you. if you talk at night, say "goodnight(:" and if he says sweet dreams, thats also a GREAT sign. <br>  <br>  pay attention to little things. but dont be too sure. boys are very confusing! trust meee/: but its worth it, i promise.|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	ok first of all: i don't think you're being too obsessed. i had this HUGE crush in my eighth grade year, and the guy lived in my neighborhood like twenty feet from the little park that's in the middle, so me and my best friend (who also had a crush on him) would go sit in the corner of the park in front of his house and hope he would like, wander outside, then we would talk loudly and laugh and stuff and see if he would look over at us. and he was in our creative writing class and we would try and talk to him and stuff and i think we were a little obvious... especially my friend when she finally got a myspace he was the first person she added as a friend.... haha. so back to you're problem.<br>  <br>  i think if he liked you that much before, he's still going to have some feelings for you. if you start talking to him a lot and stuff he's bound to like you a lot more. chances are, the more time you spend with him, the more he'll like you. just keep becoming friends and hopefully, if he's even a little bit normal, he'll ask you out eventually. it might take a while, especially if you said he's not a "ladies man" he'll be worried about being rejected. <br>  <br>  good luck!!!
IaMs2QGwaa	If he ask you personal questions like....are you single or what do you like in a guy.... most likely yes.|`|D9k0aoqdaa	i would say from that there are no negative points to lead you to a conclusion that he doesn't like you, Just see how things go over the next few days, id say that he does like you, but just carry on as you are till you think you know he likes you enough to commit to something, assuming that is what you want as well.|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	i can't know for sure, guys are so weird.<br>  <br>  if he does like you, then he's definitely the type of guy you would want to go out with. if he considers your feelings, likes to talk, and doesn't mind being in your company publicly (i'm assuming there were OTHER PEOPLE on the field trip?? haha) then he's a good guy. i don't know if he likes you for sure, though, you'd need a guy's take on that. i'm no man expert :D
Uj5kuzoJaa	The whole thing about being friends with benefits is that you dont have to deal with this crap. If you like him enough to date him, but he just wants to stay friends with benefits then it sounds like you need to move on.When you are "friends with benefits" it's because neither of you want a serious relationship with each other, just someone to hook up with every now and then. You need to tell him that you want to be his official girlfriend or else you're outta there. Otherwise you'll have to except the other women. Sorry babe|`|iufAPDeWaa	If you're in a friends with benefits relationship you set rules for the relationship. You all should have talked about what would be accepted by you both and not accepted by you both. If not you risk contracting std's and just putting your health in danger. And if you cannot do the "cut buddy" thing without getting attached you don't need to do. Its only for those who can keep their feelings separate. My advice is that you leave him alone. Obviously he's not as into you as you are too him and he hasn't been monogamous. So... theres you answer. Move on and cut ties.     Don't get me wrong I'm totally against it period. But theres my advice. It will get better with time. Don't worry.|`|paerqxfMaa	That's a risk you take with a friends with benefits relationships - you're just friends who happen to have sex.|`|cmDV4TJTaa	I was in a similar situation and I had to separate from him because I couldn't except the fact that I wasn't the only woman in his life...So i decided to finish things off before someone got hurt and I knew it was gong to be me.    Leaving him was the worst thing that I had to do and I thought I was going to die and til this day leaving him was the best thing I did because I found out I needed to be with a man that would love me back. I didn't need to hide from no one. Karma is a big DEAL.    You know what you have to do now the question is can you actually do the right thing?    Good Luck!

2Qykhk0gaa	ASHLEY'S ANSWER:<br>  I suggest you mind your own freakin' business. It's not you place to be putting his stuff on blast. If he's dumb enough to cheat, then he's dumb enough to get caught eventually. Karma really is a ******. It'll come back to bite him in the end. And if she's dumb enough to (1) not notice anything suspicious or (2) she is and isn't putting a stop to it then let her handle her business. Plus, you say this guy is your friend. Why would you rat out a friend?? Snitches get killed, don't you know that?? We have no moral obligations to out somebody regarding things that have nothing to do with us. She approached you about it, right? Just point her in her boyfriend's direction. That's who she should be asking the questions to. Not somebody else. Now, if you just feel compelled to do something to suffice her.... Don't deny or confirm any of her suspicions, but you can always suggest other things. "Hey, if you're really this concerned about it and don't feel comfortable confronting your boyfriend, look into hiring a private detective or investing in a tracking device for his car." This way you're not ratting out your friend, but this chick feels like you are helping her out and on her side. <br>  <br>  SARA'S ANSWER:<br>  There are three outcomes to this scenario...<br>  1) You tell her the truth, that her old man is cheating they break up and you lose him as a friend.<br>  2) You tell her the truth, that her old man is cheating, she doesn't believe you and listens to his lines of bull and you lose two friends.<br>  3) You say nothing and if she asks again tell her she's in a relationship with him not you and if she's having doubts she should be discussing them with him.<br>  You can do what ever you want with this but remember the bearer of bad news always gets screwed some how.<br>  Bros before hoes.<br>  Let it be for now, you keep getting pulled into the middle, stall her for a minute and go talk to your boy and tell him to handle his ****.|`|m2eHPeciaa	bitches snitch period.|`|J6hwyKoQaa	tell him how much it bothers you and warn him that if he doesn't STOP and/or TELL her sometime soon, you will.|`|srjm2m9gaa	you should snitch on him <br>  <br>  us girls need to stick together|`|VXIYgrHfaa	Really you should talk to the guy and tell him he shouldn't cheat on women it makes all men look bad. Best thing not to do is Yell or threaten to tell her that is a bad thing trust me. If the cheating is still going on for more than two weeks after you talk to him its maybe time to talk to her. <br>  Tell her that he's cheating if they have been together for a long while she might think your lying. If she does think your lying don't push it. But if she does find out be there for her and support her. Also try not to get to stuck in the middle of things it might tear one or both of your friendships apart.|`|RD05jXYwaa	who do you value? <br>  <br>  understanding that telling her the truth may alienate her towards you. <br>  <br>  and ratting him out may make him push you aside. tmm|`|ijR3ygAJaa	Hmmm... which of these two friends is more important to you?<br>  If you feel like you must tell her, maybe you could sort of just set her up to find out?

omegLbOAaa	it depends on the dress code for the wedding. the invitation should say something like "formal," "cocktail," "casual," etc. to give you some idea of how fancy to look.    Many people *like* an occasion to dress up & look more glamorous than they do on any normal day, which is why most wedding photos that you see show people looking their best.    You can wear your hair down, but just make sure it's clean, brushed & tamed.    You don't have to wear jewelry or makeup... it just helps to achieve a more glamorous look. Maybe if your dad ever gave you a necklace or bracelet, now would be a good time to wear it.     Don't wear jeans or tennis shoes or anything that might embarrass your dad. Wear a nice dress or a suit. Even trousers are acceptable if they're paired with a pretty top & high heels.  If you don't want to shop for something new, then just choose the very nicest things that you have in your closet & that should do.|`|LAXbJfvwaa	It depends how formal the wedding is as to how much you need to dress up.  But think of it this way - people dress up to show that they have taken the time and effort to look good for a particular event.  If you could not be bothered dressing nicely then it comes across that you could not be bothered about the event - and I am sure that is not what you are wanting to portray.    You don't have to layer the makeup on, or wear the most expensive jewellery.  You can still look nice and appropriate without all the hoo-hah.  Just a little lippy and some mascara would do the trick for makeup and shouldn't make you feel like your face has been plastered.  At least wear a nice skirt and top if you won't wear a dress and maybe just add a pretty pair of earrings.  (You can get really cheap jewellery that will still look lovely with a more formal outfit)  And you may leave your hair out but maybe curl it or at least blow dry it to show that you have taken some care about how you look.    So what I am trying to say is - if you make some effort with the way you look, then it shows people that you care enough to have made an effort for them.  It is just basic ettiquette.  If you want to say 'I don't care' (and also make yourself stand out in a bad way) then go in your jammies!    If it is a summer and/or more casual wedding this type of look would be fine...  http://i.ivillage.com/BS/fashion/wedding...  http://www.flickr.com/photos/the_amanda/...

Perhaps a fresh flower in a barrette to pull the hair away from one side of your face?|`|AA11603468	It's not flaunting, its dressing appropriately for the occasion. You wouldn't wear a ballgown to go camping, and you don't wear shorts and a t-shirt to a wedding. A wedding is typically a more formal occasion, and a dress or other nice clothes are appropriate.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Yes, I get all dolled up to attend weddings.  Even when I am a guest.  It is a special occasion.    I guess the closest comparison I can think of for you would be prom or homecoming.  Don't you and/or your friends try to look your best for the prom or homecoming dance?  Same thing.    Actually, since you are the groom's daughter, think of it more in terms of prom than homecoming...since the dresses people wear for prom are more formal.    You can still wear an elegant dress that isn't all diamonds, ruffles, lace and pearls.  I'd find a gorgeous party dress that you like a lot.  If you have to get all dolled up for this stupid wedding anyway, you may as well make the best of it by wearing a fancy party dress that you love. I'm sure there is one or two out there.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Well, it's a really special day and a somewhat "formal" one as well.  It's kinda like getting ready for the prom.  You can still be "you" but looked like a really cleaned up version of you.|`|7VzbVzBnaa	You haven't got to do anything that you don't want to, but it's usually best to match your dress to the formality of your make-up & jewelry.      JFK Jr's wedding is a great example.  http://msnbc.com/modules/take3/july/img/...  She wore a simplr slip dress, hardly any jewelry, and light make-up.      If you are in a giant ball gown, then this look doesn't fly quite as well.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	You can be simple with getting "dolled up" and still look fabulous.  And to be honest, a lot of the time, less is more.      You do want to look like you put a little effort into looking nice as that shows that you respect the seriousness of the event as well respect the couple getting married though.      This website has several hairstyles that allow your hair to be down and they are relatively simple, yet nice.    http://www.thehairstyler.com/downsmooth_...  http://www.thehairstyler.com/downcurl_ha...
9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	Because we're a bunch of sheep.  Marriage comes from religion. Religion comes from order. If there is no order, then there is no control.  Man made religion to keep things in order.   You scare people to keep order.  If you don't do this or if you do that, then you go to hell and burn for eternity. "Most ancient societies needed a secure environment for the perpetuation of the species,a system of rules to handle the granting of property rights, and the protection of bloodlines. The institution of marriage handled these needs. For instance, ancient Hebrew law required a man to become the husband of a deceased brother's widow."  So you see to understand why we have marriage now, you need to look back into history.  Somehow the marriage thing worked more before than it does now, but it's so popular and the largest religions in the world require it so it's still practiced.  Kudos to you for not wanting to do it.
HnEcgVGiaa	Hello Amanda,<br>  <br>  That's very immature of your boyfriend. I'm actually graduating in may as well after 4+ years - hopefully!!! It must really be stressful that you're 16 credits short and have to take another semester! How come you haven't noticed before? Usually they provide you with the list of courses required for graduation.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, I understand what you're going through. And your boyfriend isn't helping by complaining and yelling. He's not understanding your situation. If he knows any better, he should come down and actually take summer courses WITH you!<br>  <br>  It's best to get your college year over with. Once you go over 4 years, you don't really care about anything except for getting the heck out. I think you're making a wise decision. But this is important: Make sure your college offers all the courses needed required for your graduation in the summer. Sometimes, they don't offer all the courses because they don't expect many students to take the classes. You might have to plan a backup for the fall semester instead. But that shouldn't be too bad either. You will still be classified as a class of '09 student - like me! :D<br>  <br>  You should tell your boyfriend that you need to do this for yourself. I know it sounds selfish, but tell him and make him understand that you want to get your degree as soon as possible. Then once your college education is done, assuming you put off your grad school for later on, you can find somewhere to work.<br>  <br>  If he can't accept that, then there's something wrong with him, and he doesn't seem like that guy who you fell in love with. He must be there to support you, and not be selfish.<br>  <br>  Go get your degree! You earned it after 4+ years. But again, MAKE SURE that your school offers all those courses. I don't want you to plan on taking the summer semester, only to find that there's ONE class that's not being offered in the summer and you'd have to come back in the fall.<br>  <br>  This is YOUR life that we're talking about. Seize it by the horns. Let me know if you need any other help! It seems like you're going through quite a hard time!<br>  <br>  Best,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	As stressed as you are.. don't be rash but think about it. Your boyfriend offers up some good points.  What does it hurt to take the summer off?  You're so close to graduating you can take on a summer job with a company in your field, and you'll be trained by the end of the summer that when you come back in January, you'll be set and ready to go. <br>  Plus, taking a summer off, your LAST summer before school is done forever - soak that up girl!  I went to school for 5 years as well, and man I miss it... not the finals, not the 3 hour labs.. but it's a lot different these days.|`|Bxvs28oBaa	Go to school! Boyfriends come and go ,but deegree and carier you will have forever.Go to school! I made a misstake and choose my bf instead of school and I lost 3 years...Oh man ,what those man can do...Now I am not even with him anymore.I met another men and married happilly now but still have to go to school after will give birth to my baby boy that coming soon.Please don't wait on him,go for school1|`|07HWkV4eaa	You two won't last, just save yourself the trouble and walk out now.|`|uGouDvlXaa	If he's not supporting what you want to do, he's no good anyway.|`|o716IHkHaa	be selfish do what you want to do !<br>  thats best for you !<br>  <br>  unless <br>   if you are engaged to him ......<br>  you shouldnt put some effort into the relationship <br>  <br>  in the end it will either end up is it what he wants ? or you want <br>  <br>  who will be the selfish one here ?<br>  <br>  see love  and relationships ruin people|`|j8jhNlCSaa	education is better than any other things, if he really loves you then he should understand that it is for your own benefit anyway
8XKmMBU7aa	Please don't care.  IF you would like, you may talk to me through my messenger IM.  I will make you happy and you may listen song from me through headphone and you may aslo see me through my cam. Don't take tension about these kind of things. I will try to make you happy, more happy than every woman of the world.  I don't find any Joke on this beautiful question.  You may find Joke from www.google.com  If Answer of same question in Joke, it should be really Crazy.    Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|iufAPDeWaa	This world has become more and more immoral. you're doing the right thing. What good comes out of being a slut? Guys don't respect you. You get std's. You're pregant and alone. The lists goes on. Think about how much you will appreciate being a moral person down the road when you won't have to deal with the things I listed above. Don't let peer pressure get to you. Do what you know is right... it pays off in the end.            "If we are ever in doubt about what to do, it is a good rule to ask ourselves what we shall wish on the morrow that we had done".      "Live in such a way that you would not be ashamed to sell your parrot to the town gossip. "    "There is only one way to achieve happiness on this terrestrial ball,  And that is to have either a clear conscience or none at all".    "God grant me the courage not to give up what I think is right even though I think it is hopeless."    "Every wrong seems possible today, and is accepted.  I don't accept it. "|`|0ulKsvXlaa	Stay exactly as you are babe.  It's the others that are wandering astray.  This is not morals, it's sensible, and you know it.  Sooner, rather than later, you'll meet a guy that is just the same, and you'll appreciate each other far more because you are so.  It is fine to tease and taunt a little, that's a game we all like to play.  If this game gets out of hand, well you know, kisses are not the end of the road.  The excessive amount of Porn on the internet must bear responsibilty for this new wave of promiscuity. What is too often forgotten, is that the younger generation also has access to this, and many impressionable "children" tend to believe that what they are watching is normal adult behaviour. Nothing could be further from the truth.  I admit there are many people with open relationships, but these are a very small minority. Most people are manogomous (including people in gay relationships), we don't need to experiment, except with each other. I am not at all old fashioned or behind the times, if people want to "spread themselves around" well that's their choice. But that is not for me nor for the majority.  I am in no way prudish and have no hangups about my body. In summer I spend much time at the local naked beach. To start with I was surprised that so many normal people particpated in this culture.  Coming from England, I never realised that in Germany such things were so absolutely normal, now it's normal for me.  Even though I've seen almost everyone I know in their birthday suits, I am still the same faithful person I always was, my girlfriend is exactly the same.  At 17 years old, I never could have believed I would be as I am now.  I feel so good and mentally free, 37 years later.  I'm so pleased that I never dropped my standards, just to be trendy.|`|5uFXCBpraa	Keep your morals -- you'll need them later.    By the way, "get off" means something different than you think it does.|`|a9e5IZOWaa	good for you!  why should you change your behaviour just to feel that you fit in?  there are more people with morals (or should that be standards) out there than you think.    i think that there is more talk going on than action.  kids always say that they are going further than they really are so that their peers won't call them stupid names etc---and that is a shame|`|OGWYjsbtaa	There is nothing wrong with having morals. There is nothing worse than seeing people who put it about.  Not only do they run the risk of S T D's, but they dishonour themselves, spiritually, mentally and physically.  Love making, and even kissing should be a profound experience, so dont feel bad just because you have a strong moral code,   Feel Proud.|`|l7T0Ac3faa	i know what you mean ..you need to hang out with people who are more like you ..or tell your friends they are being slutty and maybe they will find out they have morals as well .......|`|RdLU5nVOaa	dont b a super slut|`|Ol3YHm3iaa	its not frustrating to have moral.personally i like people who have morals , they seem more mature and able to rake the correct decisions.Do not try to follow the trends of your friends , because it definitely doesn't suit you.you should try to live by your norms, and not by that of your friends.because later on you might feel sorry for kissing someone just like that or even sleeping with someone ,....  and i don't think that's its causing you more pain.You feel its pain because you cant be like your friends , but why the hell do you want to be like them?be yourself .you think they are the cool dudes but in the end you're the one who wont be having multiple boyfriends , partners or even STD's.|`|MR9Ax1WZaa	Hey :)  I can understand why you would feel out of place because it seems like 'everyone' is putting themselves around but please don't. A lot of people have morals and I admire you for being honest with yourself and respecting yourself..Too many people just 'follow the crowd' and lower their standards to try and fit in, then they end up making mistakes that ruin themselves and their conscience..   Never think that having morals is more pain than gain.. Just you keep doing it the way you feel happy and you will meet someone just like you :)   Trust me, the more people you meet, the more people you will find are like you...  Well done babe.x|`|mU2tx4Nraa	im just the same... nd i dont care . my friends at school (slutty) r totally difo from my mates at home.   stick to them .. is my advice lol x
zfWmQst5aa	I FKING FEEL YOU|`|07HWkV4eaa	Take your meds, it will be alright.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	what about with bb?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  be seeing you....
1vaqtRI2aa	Your situation sucks! But just show him you're more mature.<br>  Hang out as friends, and if the relationship is meant to be, it'll work.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have a great relationship, so just give it time, and it'll work itself out. Life has ways of doing that. I was actually in your exact situation, and that's what I did- I proved to him I changed and I showed him I grew to become a better person. We've been together over 2 years now and moving in together this summer!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck! If you need to chat, i/m me or e-mail me!|`|tZAgJpSNaa	Well, whatever the problem was you said it wasnt HUGE then he just had enough of you and just decides to stop gettin hurt and move on, if you really want him to stay than change something in you that causes the fights, stop being immature probably or something, I have no idea wat you 2 broke up for or almost broke up so i can't help much but yes you have to change a lil bit<br>  <br>  That's the problem in some girls, us men change the way we are to keep our gf happy and love us but they wont do the same for us and is wat cause us to get hurt..
QvhPJAKyaa	well dont keep askin him places now, otherwise he'll think our kinda desperate, ou ma give the wrong impression.  hes not coming across as he likes ou, it seems as hes just a mate, although he has agreed to go with ou to these places, so who knows?! and wen ou are together, leave it for a while, and see what happens, if ou reall wanna, make a move, but not straight awa, give him a chance, or ou will deffo look desperate.  goood luck x|`|aIHSmRYwaa	just get him out of his shell!!|`|NAkQdoYlaa	Just text him and tell him you like him as more than a friend but you're not sure how he feels about you. If he says sorry he sees you as just a friend then that's ok, just don't let it spoil your friendship. If he likes you as in a gf way then that's even better!|`|1vKiGBF4aa	He seems like a nice guy, sometimes nice guys do nice things.   Like agree on going to prom with you. But by him saying if I can make it I will. Maybe ask him if he is sure, other wise you can ask someone else =) so you are not dateless for prom, see what he says. By him replying i am up for it, sounds like a friendly sure, I have nothing else to do. But then again that maybe just be his personality. I wouldn't text him again for a while. Make things a little more interesting for him. So that he things you other things to do then text him all day =) He may ask what happen to you or what you been up to. If he does he likes you!  hehe|`|W618lfZ6aa	First think hard about if you really like him as a friend or a romantic interest, if you two start dating and break up do you guys want to remain friends? Mature enough?    Best thing to do is take it slow, be flirty but not too over baring, do the concert thing, if its a rock concert then dance with him. If its a orchestra then try to hold his hand or rub up against him.|`|rzDbR1Yiaa	its totally mixed from my POV...  so ask him! =]|`|5MkwIq6Jaa	Just go with your gut feelings. Let things flow. After you go out more you'll get more of a feel for how to react with him.|`|qH0cXkRvaa	Text him right now.  And say this.  "Oh you know the concert, dont invite anyone else will you. I think it would be nice for us to get to know eachother before prom :) xx"    See what he texts back. Let me know what he says babe :)    xxx|`|Hq2oUqnDaa	i dated a really shy guy and its hard to get them to do things so....you can kiss him ON THE CHEEK cause guys dont like to feel like you wear pants and obligated to make the first move..good luck!!!|`|5G7YWzTGaa	Make a move he probably likes you|`|9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	If he's shy, you should probably Proceed with caution. Don't come on to strong (you'll scare him away) Sounds like your taking the right approach by offering options like going to a concert, date, etc. I would let him do the asking. Just keeping joking around with him and making suggestions.|`|govN3EESaa	i think wait until he makes a move it will be better if things develop naturally plus you don't want to scare him. Make little moves like subtle flirting just to give him the idea but i speak from experience don't come on too strong.|`|085qYCdDaa	Ok how long have you know him if it more than  6 months and he still seems shy with you is it when your alone or out in public. If you want to make a move do it in private. Have you ever ask him what he likes about you or why he likes hanging with you.Let him make the plans you can suggest but let him plan it. You might have to wait a while but if you really like him and you satisfied with the above answers he gives you then wait it out.Good luck if it is ment to be you will know!!!!!|`|m7lHSV7waa	It sounds to me that he just wants to be friends.  His texts are non-committal and not very enthusiastic like you would expect from someone that wants to be more than friends.  I would say wait and see if he makes a move because you have been inviting him to stuff and now it's his turn to make a move on you if he wants to.
eGpOIV12aa	FIRSt!!!! wut
LGCTOxZxaa	Yeah she prolly does like you. We ladies always want something we cant have! Maybe she'll break up with her over protective BF though, then its a key in for you! Hope for the best!|`|AA12023355	Not if she already has a boyfriend.
oHuhTJPwaa	Men do like a good chase. Men are like kids, they want to test you to see how much they can get away with. If you give it into them, they win and never stop the cycle as long as women continue to be stupid.  If they get what they want then they loose the thrill of the kill. When they call you act nonchalant and make them think you could care less if they call you or not. You'll be praying they stop calling you. Never let them see your sweat. They will loose interest!|`|2P2K0rl2aa	I'm not a man but.......<br>  <br>  You might wish to have a look at some of your past patterns, that might give you a clue.  Ask yourself questions along the lines of:  Do you sleep with them too quickly?  Do you fall for them too quickly?  Do you give them the opportunity to chase you, or do you always chase them?  All of these things make a difference as to whether somebody will stick around or not.<br>  <br>  Everyone plays games to some extent, most of the time it's unconscious.  Look at this this way, if he wants you, he will let you know, if not then let it go.  You will find somebody who will want to share their life with you, it's just not your time yet.  Like most of us, we have to kiss a few frogs before we find the prince. Don't lose hope.|`|RtkB46peaa	If you've experience this nonsense with all the men you date, you obviously need to re-evaluate your choice in men (duh).  Generally speaking, men aren't nearly as concerned with who's in control of the relationship.  Women have that covered.|`|SzQi9N7daa	maybe your asking the wrong men?  <br>  <br>  You let yourself get hooked up with the game players so you have only to look at yourself.  When they start to play the game simply say I'm not interested. Don't wait for them to call you and don't jump when the do!!|`|M4X3HOV5aa	men aren't playing games with you, your problem is that you have no standards. you are complaining about men who only contact you every once in a while which means you are obviously not in a relationship with them. maybe you should require that a man date you and make a comittment to you before you get intimate with them. why would any man put an effort into a woman that will just answer the phone whenever he calls and won't complain when he doesn't? you are the perfect back up plan.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	i can only wish you well.. i hope you find the right guy soon ..
CwA2MBx8aa	Oh, I am so sorry! You know, I didn't have a mother who yelled at me a lot, but I come from an Chinese background where a lot of my friends got yelled at by their parents for academics, music lessons, extracurricular activities, etc. And yes, it was very, very hard. <br>  <br>  You are right, your mother shouldn't be taking out her stress on you and your siblings. It is unhealthy and damaging. And if she has had a hard childhood as well, she hasn't had good role models. She probably got yelled at as well for everything and anything. It is not an excuse, but just an explanation.<br>  <br>  Realize there there is NOTHING YOU can do to stop her from having something to say. Even if you were 'perfect' your mother's issues lie deep and she will ALWAYS be able to find something to talk to you about. It is unfortunate and it is totally unfair. I think you are amazing for not yelling back at her! amazing!<br>  <br>  At some point, you may be able to talk to her about this. I'm not sure how old you are, but I suspect that with you get into college, move away, and find a job... maybe you'll be able to have a more adult conversation about this. Right now, you can try to talk to her (not in the middle of an argument but when things are okay), and let her know that you are concerned about her stress and it really effects you and your siblings. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|hHpTrSpYaa	the next Itzak Perlman? idk who he is but has nothing to do with your problem<br>  YOUR SCHEDULE SEEMS FULL AND STRESSFUL (try taking life optimistically and reach for opportunities when they arrive in a calm matter)<br>  NEVER QUIT SPORTS its crucial for your teen life for and active lifestyle try as hard as you can on that one plz <br>  there is no point being put across if your mother doesn't listen <br>  sometimes all that you need is just a reaction <br>  your mom seems to love you, but make sure she focuses on YOU and not "your" life accomplishments|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	why are you making all of these excuses???  why are you looking for reasons out of why you got yelled at???<br>  <br>  you got yelled at because you keep going over on your tests. plain and simple.  <br>  <br>  you should spend more time worrying about what you are doing wrong instead of making excuses as to why your mom is yelling at you.
ViNFT9RQaa	he might be preoccupied with something else right now that you don't know about. sometimes my boyfriend will act strange, forget to say i love you, etc. and instead of taking it personal, i wait for him to come around and tell me whats on his mind. don't think too much into it, but when he comes to stay with you, if he is still acting strange, sit down and talk to him about whats wrong. good luck!|`|POHWTDPRaa	Skipping one little 'I love you' doesn't mean he doesn't love you. It doesn't mean anything, except that he didn't say it. I'm sure you don't say it as often now as you used to either. No biggie.|`|YSoBO3tpaa	he's got a problem....|`|5MkwIq6Jaa	he was probably rushing or thinking of something else...don't think too much into it until it because a regular thing.
7BGYY9nKaa	Wow! ive seen this many times. Yeah commitment and being insecure could be a small portion of his issues right now. As mentioned earlier he could be one of those guys who just like to see what their capable of. Sorry to say this but you may not have been what he thought, which could have possibly changed his thoughts towards you. I wouldnt worry about it too much especially if your at a young age. <br>  I wish you the best of luck!|`|vwL7twjPaa	maybe he just wanted to have a little time away, or he wanted to see if you were easy or not..<br>  <br>  ..truth hurts, don't it?|`|PBsF8HaVaa	For the hell of it. To show that he has game.|`|J6X0JZkKaa	he's probably just not looking for a relationship at the moment. to him it was probably just a date, a fun time but nothing more serious than that. advice: find someone that is worth your time.
FyqCMrCdaa	Perhaps...he may be looking for something else to develop though if you get my drift. Just be aware. :)|`|wJstSw9Daa	Ummm, no. I would just take her out to the movies instead. If i invited a few friends and her than yeah.|`|jd14u32qaa	Yes.  It's called being friends.
3ISGQ4Csaa	I'm a girl, but i would say jeans and a cute t-shirt is good. I mean, ur not going out anywhere, ur staying in, so dress down. Just don't dress too down:)|`|SszvBQUvaa	Yeah, look relaxed.|`|qDWuMuwZaa	jeans and shirt is cool|`|7EXXw5cEaa	Yeah :)|`|oST5QRC4aa	To me if a girl can pull of jeans, flip flop and your basic shirt or sweatshirt, then that's much hotter than her getting dressed up.

She definately likes you!|`|MpTgh6MMaa	that is so cute. well i think she does. i act differently around boys i like. possible she does too|`|etuPowvoaa	ya know, I have a similar situation, except I'm a girl. I think she hugs other guys just because she's friends with them. Maybe she doesn't hug you because she's nervous or because she's not sure of the way you'll take it. Like, if you will be mad at her or something.  I'm not sure about the "stab him with a knife" situation but there's a chance she might like you. One thing I learned is if you ever try to tell her. don't review your thoughts in your head. Just tell her straight up. But remember, things happen for a reason.|`|ixyNeBhWaa	I think she likes you but in a different way, she doesnt know how to tell you.  She is probably use to talking to guys, but doesnt know how to express her feelings towards someone she really likes.|`|ClaJhsYVaa	Yupppp she likes you!<br>  the only reason she doesnt give you a hug is cus she likes and you and she is to nervouse to. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine please : <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219221810AAOuG1w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|NlWELg2Uaa	Yup definately likes you ASK HER OUT BEFORE SOMEONE ELSE DOES!!|`|MtzDCkgFaa	It means she hates you. <br>  <br>  Ask obvious questions get sarcastic answers *****.|`|ROVExbzFaa	Ya...and if she says no then just b her friend and dont b a nat about it qns keep annoyng the crap outta her lol|`|42f7477dd28b3aa2f361b23cc59ca672aa	lol yes she does that sweet btw XD|`|AA11097124	thats cute. she likes you|`|hw6mnbzHaa	haha yeah she does. =] go for it man!|`|otkuhc78aa	from your positives it seems like she does like you and <br>  your negatives aren't really even that negative!<br>  <br>  If she always hugs her male friends and she never hugs you, she might just not want to make it obvious that she likes you.<br>  <br>  If she talks a lot and sends notes to other guys while she is quiet and shy with you she might be trying to make you jealous, to show you "See other guys like me, you should like me too.<br>  <br>  Her behavior is different with you then with other people there is a high chance she likes you.<br>  <br>  From what you said happened in class it seems like you make her nervous... another sign she could like you.
4jW455dgaa	not do it.<br>  <br>  You should tell him either two things,<br>  "i'm just not ready to do that yet"<br>  or<br>  "Are you crazy, i'm 16"<br>  <br>  LOL|`|Y44ZKI97aa	Well if he dumps you just because you say no, than he doesnt really care about you. That means he just wants to use you for doing it. A boy doesnt really love you if all they want to do is sleep with u.

Sorry, but thats the truth. because if he really liked you he would wait for you and give you time until YOUR ready.|`|o1ibwPKPaa	Well if he dumps you because you won't have sex with him yet considering you are 16 I would think that he doesn't actually like your for you.

If he really liked/love you, then he would respect you. You should do it when YOU FEEL you want to, and want him to be your first. It also should depend how long you guys been going out, my close friend and her boyfriend have been going out for around 2 years, he wants to do it but she doesn't; she wants to wait till after highschool. He loves her too much, and wouldn't let that get in the way of their relationship, so he waits for her because she's worth the wait. And if your boyfriend loved you, he would wait.,|`|9fe025be4d88d6ddc1c006f3f4e44dd9aa	DON'T HAVE SEX WITH HIM!!<br>  <br>  If he dumps you because you don't have sex with him, that means you were never his girlfriend to him, you're just a potential booty call. If there is no emotion on his part to pick you over someone else and wait for you then there is no reason for him not to cheat on you with anyone any everyone that is willing to have sex with him... and he'll be bringing all of those diseases back to you. <br>  There is also the possibility that you're just a conquest and as soon as you have sex he'll be out the door and never want to speak to you again.|`|HrtRYxjOaa	Your boyfriend should care about you the most, and care about your feelings.

It may be wise to wait a little longer before pursuing it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|BqkIOSk3aa	if my girlfriend said no.. i would try damn hard to proof it to her that i am honorable person. i'll do whatever it takes to make her see and ...then do it:) ehehe i'm being honest ..don't mock me people.<br>  if he really loves you then he would not gonna force you to do something that you don't wanna do. so what i think you should do is listen to your heart.. you wanna do that (especially the first time) with someone special, not jerks, coz you will wanna remember that for the rest of your life, not regretting it for the rest of your life... so lose him if you have to.|`|jxcXVRDuaa	If he's black, yes.<br>  If he's white, no.<br>  If he's white, and a jock / prep / wtfe, yes or he'll dump you.<br>  If he's mexican / hispanic, find another boyfriend.<br>  If he wears a "WITE TEE," under his shirt (or above), restraining order.<br>  If he's me, yes.<br>  If he isn't any of these, no.|`|FyVdQKIBaa	If you're not ready, don't do it.<br>  <br>  And if he dumps you because of that, he's not worth it - you're not a piece of ***.

Tell him you're not ready yet. If he can't respect that and leaves you over it, find a guy who CAN respect it. Never give in if you aren't ready...having sex with a guy won't make him stay with you.

Life is too short to have it spoiled by someone who wants to refuse to let nature take its course.<br>  <br>  Whether or not you should depends on a few things.  What are your objections.

If he breaks up with you, consider yourself better off because if he leaves if you won't sleep with him then he was clearly with you only for sex.<br>  I was 16 when I lost mine... and you can't imagine the regret I have for doing that. Some people lose it when they're young like that and they're okay with it, but for me it was the wrong choice. Now I'm with a man I want to spend my life with and I feel like I wish I would've waited for him. <br>  You seem pressured... either by him or by yourself being concerned about whether you'll be dumped or not...and being pressured into sex is wrong on any and all levels. <br>  <br>  You're a smart girl - stand up for how you feel.<br>  Say what you believe is right and whatever follows is the best thing for you.|`|7Z3hWNewaa	Just tell him that you're not ready.

hYRP0x2Eaa	No. Never do it just so he won't dump you. If he cannot understand that you want to wait, then he is not the right guy for you. He should respect you enough to at least not take off your shirt when you already said no. I would talk to him about it seriously. Sit him down and tell him that you really want to wait. Give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he is not used to girls wanting to wait, so he thought you were joking. If after talking to him he still does not understand or listen, then leave him.

You both have unusual and unique chemistry (note-unusual is spelled with 1 n) and I believe you should take the next step.

If you want to save the relationship then talk to him about your phone situation and if he is not willing to deal with that then you guys should split. He should be able to trust you. Good luck :)

ADP9swbMaa	I don't agree. My boyfriend and I respect each other very much...but we also think of each other quite sexually.|`|Lk0noY62aa	I just met my GF the 13th, and we haven't done anything yet. And I won't push her. When she's ready, I'm ready.
JuGH3Rowaa	intrested-you actually ahve feelings for some one<br>  Ex: a boy loves a girl<br>  <br>  Depsrite: you need to or want to have feelings but still try to get the girl cuz you cant get any other girl<br>  Ex: boy asks girl1 out she says no, boy pleeds girl2 to go out with him cuz girl1 wont<br>  <br>  i hope that made sense
XH2o1MM6aa	.Don't fall for that sucker line.I (him) don't want to get hurt. He kissed you while he had a gf.So it's ok for him but not for you.He's just trying to get you to feel guilty.If he's jealous, then he's not worth the bother.|`|7IoBuuL4aa	well no offense but kissing his friend doesn't really help him trust you! my boyfriend's ex girlfriend cheated on him with his best friend a year ago.. he didn't even talk to any girls for like 6 months cause he didn't trust any of them!! just give him time.. don't go kissing other guys that doesn't help him trust you. just let him know that you still like him and that you're willing to wait for him. cause he still has feelings for you i promise it! but if you're not willing to wait for him to get over this you should let him know and move on..
rTaaIXSuaa	Well why would you be attracted to someone if you know their choices in women aren't very good?<br>  Do you feel challenged? Quit wasting your time and just concentrate on more important things such as school, friends, life. Plenty of time for boys.|`|AA11441704	You are 15.........think of school.|`|vAUewI5faa	im sry to say this<br>  but there are plenty of other guys out there<br>  this guy doesnt sound nice to me at all<br>  and thats not experienced<br>  dont risk ur health, dont do drugs just for this guy<br>  dont go out with him|`|Dt3t6KwHaa	Just from this I can tell that he respects you, that's what you should focus on!  Don't be afraid about him spreading rumors that you wouldn't have sex with him because you're lame, chances are that other rumors will spread that are about you not having sex with him because "it" was too small.|`|AA12023355	Don't ever have sex unless you feel ready. If a guy only wants you for that he's not worth it. And it won't stop him dumping you, he will have his way then move on to the next one.
WlAPb2nfaa	I do i have a crush on one his really shy and smart  and i stare at him all the time i think he notices but he doesn't talk much to me and when there's a moment i get nervous and blah.I suggest you talk to a girl you like or if a girl stares at you ha ha if your really really? shy write her a note:). Good luck|`|9e6a66fe8592d126c6b207054fb2fa7aaa	Personally, I like intelligent guys, but not ones who boast about it.  It's more attractive when you find out a guy is intelligent after speaking with them. It helps if he's good looking.|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	It depends. ~I LOVE DEREK|`|emJ79qagaa	I love quiet Asians!<br>  <br>  I'm a girl btw, mind my geoffrerry icon!
wJstSw9Daa	1. 0<br>  2. what?<br>  3. I lay down and SHE would get on top of me. (Didn't ask her) cuddle<br>  4. she already did. Broke up with her cause of College and told her she needs to realize what if I find someone, and you waited for me but didnt' get me? (Not trying to hurt her though)<br>  5. talkative(not a lot), kinky. IDK
1k7LIZVWaa	She's cheating on you with someone else.  Maybe she wanted someone who didn't think of her as you do: 'I have my own personal whore'.  I do not condone cheating and I have no doubt she is a whore, but so are you.  Kind of the pot calling the kettle black.      Get a divorce.  Lose the whore.  Figure out how to make your life better so you can have some dignity and self respect.  Start over.|`|wKzH60Xlaa	Yah, I'd say she's having her cake and eating it too.  You gotta look at the bigger picture.  She's being selfish -  I would cut it off.  It's best for both of you.  You're a big boy and you can handle it.    I think you're having doubts too, otherwise you wouldn't be here looking for answers.  Deep down - YOU KNOW THE ANSWER!|`|d508e71226a169afed7ebfc7e78bbc5baa	the two words having and affair is the issue here|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Yes I agree you are confused.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	You have the morals and intelligence of a common turnip!    "...your own personal whore..."    Perhaps you need to get a divorce, stop the affair and rethink your entire life, especially about the part where you commit and devote yourself to another person.  This isn't all about you...which is how you phrased the question.    Quit thinking of whether YOU will get hurt.  There are two other human beings involved in this nasty little triangle.|`|MDWaPmXsaa	If it is obvious she doesn't want a divorce and wants nothing more from you, then there's your answer.  If that kind of relationship is ok with you, then there you go.  If you want more, (I'm sure you've heard this plenty) then there are plenty of completely available women out there.  If your current lover is the only one that will possibly do, then you just may have to settle for the way it is.|`|iM2BaJbeaa	I have a friend in the same situation you need to end it hun, seriously the only person that is going to get hurt here is you. She has someone to go home to you don't. Doesn't sound like she will ever leave her hubby, or she would have done something by now. You are just her comfort puppet when she isn't getting what ever she needs there she comes too you and if she says she is in love with you then shame on her bc obviously she doesn't know what love means. Look at her personal life too have there been others before you, if so then your just another number totally replaceable.|`|FmEsMOKVaa	well why not get a divorce? You should do it out of respect.|`|oQQ9DF9oaa	The problem is that you are having an affair.....|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	If you want more and you say she doesn't, then you will have to find someone else.  It really is simple.    By the way - you are cheating which makes you really unappealing.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	That's why affairs aren't good things. Leave her be if you want something more. She is married.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Perhaps the reason she makes no real effort to be with you is because of your tendency towards misogyny and calling women "whores".  With a brain like that, I'm not sure even your mama loves you.|`|tX1Pt1HDaa	Sounds like my wife. Only she moved in with the guy. You will never have anything with her. If she cheated on her husband with you she will cheat on you. I would drop her before you get a STD.|`|KL6zuNuuaa	ok you say you love her but she's your WHORE??? 1st off you don't refer to people that u supposedly love like that.  and if she isn't with her husband anymore why is she divorced after 3 yrs. just ask her where is it going and if its not what you want to hear and you want to stay that's u but if not move on|`|vV77Pv1vaa	youre a fcken spineless ballless coward loser is what you are.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	I'm confused too.|`|I9YH3HLQaa	heres a real ****** peice of advis first off all y and how the **** u gonna go and **** over the person u love if u knew was gonna cheat dont waste a ****** persons time who tryin to acually care for the other person not use them|`|rw2TcmGIaa	You sound like you are paranoid, immature, possessive and cowardly.    You should be greatful, you are in an amazing relationship that a lot of people take years to find.|`|HwTMMVd7aa	What's wrong?    You're having an affair, that's what's wrong!    Stop having the affair! You're enabling her to cheat on her husband. It doesn't matter how happy she makes you. If she can cheat on him with you, she can cheat on you with someone else. Think about it! Leave her. End it. Don't be stupid, here.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	So shes beautiful.... but , get a job Climb off that wall and go get it all.....Accept has 2 cs!|`|0e9846c69a3447404194ba8083d4f969aa	Personal whore?    And you wonder why she's not wanting to commit to you.|`|onbwN4csaa	It's whats you both did in the beginning..      You did not care.    Who ells would. your seeing a married woman.|`|5cjKxcSFaa	I think that you need to come to terms with what kind of man you want to be.  Do you want to be able to respect the person you see in the mirror?  How about when you're alone?  Do you feel ashamed of what people would think if they knew what kind of hurt you inflict on others lives?  Not to be mean but you should.  It takes work and mostly time, but if you just show some self-restraint and dedication you can turn around and be a deserving, committed one woman man.  Give it a shot, and mostly give it time.  Get the spice network if you have to.|`|hitKzYhBaa	i know someone who has been an affair for 12 years. It is a woman  and she can call the house and with a low voice can disguise it as a   man. She loves him very much and never interferes in his relationship  with his wife. He loves her very much and the sex is great. It is really  hard once you have entered into a relationship like this and unless you  put yourself on the line with her you will continue to have these feelings.  Is that something you want to carry around with you. Or do you want to  clear the air so to speak. Do not be afraid to ask. Never be afraid to   express your feelings, because the relationship, the deep devotion you  search for will not be found and the empty spot you want to feel will always bother you. Is it worth it? I ask her. Don't you  love her?|`|u3FBa2zuaa	Eh, I know that you don't need to be screamed at right now but his just confirms my opinion about marriage and relationships. Ppl just never seem to be happy and are always taking things for granted. Men always seem to fall for the fake and neglect the real woman that is right in front of them, that actually loves them and that really wants to be with them long term.   My husband would stick his d    into a blender if some woman with a soft voice and a smile told him to do it. Yet every time I tell him to get lost and go find his pollyanna he freaks out and cries and tells me that he can't live without me.  It sounds like you need to understand that no matter what relationship you are in, I don't care what the optimists say, you eventually get bored, start fighting over bills, start wishing that you had a mom and a wife all wrapped up in one because most men are unable to deal with real stress so they look to fake disney like characters to pat their little heads and put them against their bosoms and breastfeed them and tell them it's all going to be alright and then go to bed with them. That is not real life and you'll miss reality when it's gone.|`|sXVLD2whaa	OK, can I get some answers? Who is married? You or her? and if she doesn't live with her husband, I'm not sure what the problem is? And if you are in love with her and have been for three years (a really long affair) why do you say that you don't care about her? You need to ask yourself why you have so many contradictions. If you do love her, then tell her you love her and if you get rejected at least you can cut your losses, but if you would prefer your own personal whore, then just leave it at that and buy her flashy gifts every so often (like a Victoria's Secret gift card).

AA11404465	Because he likes you and he's playing hard to get, he's trying to see how he can get inside your head until you break down and actually approach him instead of him making h is first move. He's not going to make the first move in approaching you, his pride is in his way and he doesn't want his friends seeing him melt in front of you in their presence. If you approach him first, then to his friends, it's all good. It's a boy/macho thing. It's a game guys play in order to hide their ego. But it sounds like he does like you.|`|Ev2uhqyCaa	i think he likes you but he doesnt want you to know so hes trying to give you the impression that he doesnt so no1 will give him abuse|`|51IxTvZNaa	i think your friends are freaking him out more than anything lmao<br>  picture this,, he likes you but maybey has a girl in secret , his mates say something about u infront of his gf then she sees ur msn addie so he blocks you too keep the peace , he likes you but knows nothing can happen in the sitch hes in ?  could be 1000 miles out but its a possibility ,<br>  He could stare because hes deep in thought about you or something that hes heard ?<br>  Forget what your friends say it could be all rumours and trust me theres nothing good about rumours  <br>  itl probs all blow over and youll just find hes a  park  kind of guy ?<br>  <br>  good luck anyway :P xx|`|90faa4cd94ef7f4fc6117ba415c52a62aa	may be he is physche ?
PuxP6UzVaa	If I got to know you for a while and you don't go to bars or use drugs then yes as long as you don't constantly talk about your ex boyfriends or husbands because that turns me off.<br>  I hope you called the cops on the douche bag who assaulted you because that way somebody else doesn't get hurt.|`|nxHjSKTTaa	I am sorry for what happen to you! I hope the guy was caught and put in jail. I am not a guy but I know someone who has been in your shoes.  Please work on you before worry about weather or not someone will date you. You can recover from this. I know it will take time.  If someone on this site says something insensitive do not take it to heart.  The person who truly loves you will see past this and see what a brave soul you are. I know you want to be validated but wait until your more confident before searching for love. You are still vulnerable. God Bless you! Take care.|`|xHcQSLiVaa	If I were a single guy, yes.  You are you and that is all one should ask for.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	yes i would<br>  <br>  even with what you went through that would not change my mind about you<br>  i would actually admire you because you are still living through a horrible experience<br>  <br>  but if i did date you<br>  i would also try to help you get your life back on track|`|cZyeJ2praa	well if i was dude.. yes<br>  <br>  it wasnt your fault and i would give u another chance|`|d4b619c10771cb613c956622f5ad31acaa	Be honest and TELL the guy what's up right away!|`|fLvzhAX8aa	Sounds tragic.<br>  tragic is hott.|`|vXKKQnXeaa	I'd have to get to know you first, but just because you've had some hard times in your life, doesn't mean your a bad person, or even a strange person.

You need to start socializing again. If you don't like yourself then that's a huge problem. In other words, I think you need therapy.<br>  <br>  Most guys when they date you they will not ask for your resume and ask why you didn't work from x and y.  Bottom line if you like yourself and you are happy with who you are and how you look you will be attractive.<br>  <br>  Answer to you last question: I don't think you should bring it up unless it is absolutely necessary, especially right away. Another point that proves that you need to talk about this somewhere....  Have you tried organizations for women who have been abused like www.woar.org?
AA10975867	You need to ask yourself how mature you are and how much you stick with your own decisions. Too many brides are impatient, rush away to Vegas or the courthouse to marry and then, a couple of years later when their friends are having lovely weddings, they get remorseful, jealous and regretful. Then they demand a "do-over" and spend money their house or marriage or baby needs to have a wedding reception. (EVERYONE gossips about these events, no matter how much girls think they are acceptable.) You need to really think about your priorities. Would you regret missing out on being the star of you show? Are you a sensible person who would rather have a down payment than a huge party? If you feel that you are a person who can make logical decisions and that you always stand by your decisions and that you don't have a jealous bone in your body, then go ahead and "run off". If you have even one shred of "maybe" in your mind, hold off, talk to your parents and set a date for a real wedding reception. My own thoughts about white weddings - based on experience personally and of my kids, I can tell you that when times get difficult, it is very helpful to sit down together and look at your wedding photos to remind each other why you got married, how much in love you were on that day, and why there is too much good in each other to lose....ADDED: Ahhhh, so you are pregnant. the question should be "If I was NOT pregnant, would I be marrying this man?" If the answer is doubtful, do not get married at all. If the answer is a defnite YES, then by all means, get married. If you want the baby born within the wedded status, why not get the dress and flowers,etc. and plan a wedding for next month as best as you and your family can afford. We planned our wedding in only a month and it was gorgeous and affordable.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	elope!  weddings are overrated and most of the time, trite.  if you have a kid on the way, how can you spend $$$$ on a party that only lasts 5 hours and a dress you wear once?  you gotta get your priorities straight.  elope and put your wedding money in a college fund for your kid, they'll thank you in 20 yrs.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Its going to be difficult planning a big wedding when you are pregnant, so my advice to you would be to have a civil ceremony with a reception and then once baby is here you can renew your wedding vows in a big or small ceremony as you choose.|`|MDWaPmXsaa	If you're not sure what to do, I'm sure you're weighing the pros and cons of either one.  Just running off is usually the best way for money saving, and stress saving!   You could do the in-between thing, like I did.  We "ran off" to Vegas, and had a small ceremony with only a few people (family) invited.  That way you don't have to bother with the big old traditional wedding, yet you can still feel like you had a little more than standing in front of a judge at a courthouse.|`|GvamTVqAaa	Run off.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	my mum always said all you really need for a wedding is the bride, the groom, a couple of rings and the preacher - everything else is just icing on the cake and money out the window!    if you have a little one on the way then elope and save your money for her/his nursery!  congrats and good luck!|`|7VzbVzBnaa	Pick whatever you feel is best for you and your friends & family.      Remember that you only get to do this once, so be sure that everyone is comfortable with your decision.|`|xFv6LirIaa	Have a traditional wedding.  Weddings are wonderful and your whole family gets to share in the special day with you.  If worried, just keep it very simple, no foo foo.|`|DrzuDOD6aa	Whatever you ultimately decide to do is up to you, but I would suggest not running off. I think eventually your will regret not having an actual wedding, and your friends and family will probably be sad too. This is a huge event in your life, you should share it with loved ones.|`|Jjx90cCQaa	You should have a traditional wedding or if you want do a crazy theme for your wedding if that's too boring for you. But think of your family and friends, getting married should be the most wonderful part of your life.|`|LVNbP6VWaa	I wouldn't swap my traditonal wedding for the world!  But it is stressful and expensive.  Doing the whole planning thing does make you feel very special for a long time though.  Don't elope! x|`|DEU7BI7maa	Maybe you could do both, running off to get married would save on money/stress, but if you'd still like to share your big day you could let your parents or some other family member/friend throw you a party to celebrate. Or throw one yourself and invite them all.    If you do run off to get married, you could even keep it secret then announce it at the party...|`|c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	it will probably be easier to elope for now and have a celebration on your 1 year anniversary.  planning a wedding is soooo stressful and it sounds like you have a lot ahead of you.  take the time to plan a 1 or 5 year ceremony to have all the family together.

447b3c2cce6bc6d60c0a2667a9e8a9a9aa	You wouldn't happen to be married to Ann Chovey  Hint: 6 questions down from you.|`|MT0gw2hmaa	It depends when and where your texting, Are you texting right in front of her while eating dinner or while you should be focusing on her for instance? If its distracting and noticeable then yes, I see why its bothering her. Its part of phone eetiquette its really hard I know, I text all the time, I think I text more than I use the phone like so many people. The thing is when a text comes in, ddon'tgo for it right away, specially  your partner is around it looks bad and makes them feel bad that the text is more important than they are at that particular time. If a text comes in, I always say oh its so and so when I'm with my husband and he sees,  just to let him in and he wont think anything is up. Sometimes, its best just to put the phone aside and forget about it till later, turn it off, and spend time in the "now" the text will be there later when you have time for it.|`|ByUS0k8waa	You should have spaced your questions better. You asked this just like 2 minutes ago with the fact you where a women.|`|TzeYsXKGaa	Is she trying to talk to you while you're texting?    I know I get a little upset if I'm out to dinner with my husband and he starts texting one of his buddies about a game or something. I don't threaten to break his phone lol just makes me a little upset.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Maybe you're rude.  Unless you're the president, when you're with your "wife" and kids there's no reason to be glued to the phone.  In fact, you should try leaving the damn thing at home every once in a while.|`|tX1Pt1HDaa	I can tell you this. Stop if you love her. Is it worth a fight. My wife used to do it all day and night. She ran off and moved in with a guy 3 weeks ago. Like I told her if you need to talk pick up the phone. Cell phones cause allot of problems. Even if you are not doing anything wrong.|`|OOL4XdjPaa	No, she just doesn't trust you for some reasons.. if it bothers you check her phone.|`|vV77Pv1vaa	yeah ok, 5 minutes ago, you were a girl asking the same question.     give it up|`|701bbe1c569791c58e8a627b54425b08aa	She feels that your texting is hiding something from her.  Like you cannot talk to that person on the phone in front of her.  It is deceitful.  Why not pick up the phone and talk to that person in front of her?|`|DIx2ZD4Faa	at lea set you keep your questions short. This one was lame.    Next. 2 points|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	That sounds a little extreme my friend. Ask her why she hates it so much. Is she controlling elsewhere?|`|onbwN4csaa	It's like talking a different language. If they can't understand it...  Your talking bad about them.  Have you ever been anywhere and the person is talking in a different language. For all you know there tilling you to go fu_k yourself. You would not know the difference....  You my have even laughed about it. and did not know they just screwed you.
2qjgS99Qaa	aww... =) hold her waist, i love when my boyfriend does that.  Now if your sitting just rest your hand on the inside of her thigh, i like that too. haha... if yall are standing then like i said hold her waist, and get pretty close to her not violating her but prtty close. if sitting, then have yalls legs touching atleast. hope it helps. good luck!      oh and make sure you have a breath mint too!! lol|`|yKJSvdHCaa	Start with lips (not immediately insert tongue), don't put your tongue too far in her mouth.

FYH2xl6Naa	1) we only have your side of the story, she could have a million differnt feelings.<br>  <br>  2) I think you contacting her wouldn't be a problem<br>  <br>  3) no, i don't think she was. But who really knows, find out for sure !
7mtdqUpwaa	First of all I think all of us like knowing that the opposite sex finds us attractive but you shouldn't act on that feeling. I think you have more character than you think you do. You have not cheated. However it can be a dangerous line, like straddling the fence.<br>  <br>  I think you just need to find other ways to get attention besides that. Focus on your friendships, your relationship with your immediate family. Do you work or go to school? Try to good in those areas as well so you can get the attention you deserve.<br>  <br>  Its great for your boyfriend to give you attention, but perhaps you need recognition with others besides your boyfriend. I think the best way to get is through work and school, friendships, and family relationships. If you feel like a guy finds you attractive, you can appreciate that for yourself. But you don't have to reply to the guy that talks to you on myspace or on instant messaging.<br>  <br>  Just remember, even if you meet the right guy, you could lose him because the right guy wants to be with someone who appreciates him and loves him and wants to be only with him. Don't let this guy go over something so small.|`|P9Bbmj3waa	listen to yourself. You sound like such a b****. I mean come on. If you really loved him you wouldnt be doing it.

Turn your myspace theme into something you're into rather than something that  makes teenage boys drool. Ask yourself what is more important? Attention that I guaruntee that you can live without or "your one"?|`|F8CSNTQdaa	If you wanted all the attention from others you might have considered staying single.  You are right...not considering your husbands feelings might lead you to being able to do whatever you want whenever...because he will not stick around for that.

Pah3miTYaa	Hey!<br>  I had this problem a while ago. So you've known this guy for a while and so talking to him is easy, invite him over for an afternoon and watch a film or something. When he is there (if not the first time, invite him over and again until you feel ready) start friendly and then a little flirty and when you're closer - if he hasn't already - tell him how you feel.<br>  Telling him how you fell is tricky but it makes the other person feel great and if he likes you (which it sounds very much like he does) will bring you closer.<br>  Good luck and i hope this helped :)<br>  Sophie x|`|vg9C2TqQaa	the best thing you could do is talk to him. be completely honest. if you want to be more subtle, try doing other things. maybe casually bring up fun times you remember. even try being flirty, but be careful of being slutty. do something sweet or sentimental to show him you do care. if i knew him, i'd be able to help more. if you ever remember him saying something, such as something he wanted or something he wanted to do, do it with him. if you know he likes you too, go for it. you'll never know unless you try!! start off slow. invite him over for a movie. hang out in a group if it makes you feel more comfortable. just be yourself and put yourself out there for him. let him know what you want.
AA11123333	You're one of God's children.<br>  And if you're not religious, then there's someone out there for you that you haven't met yet.<br>  And if you don't believe in true love, then remember that there are people worse off than you, but you have a chance to make something of your life.<br>  And if you don't buy THAT, then I hope you find a reason that works for you.  Because life is worth living.  It may not seem like it now, but start doing what you love.  Do you have any hobbies? Interests? Do more! It'll definitely make life more interesting.<br>  Good luck.

They'll try harder to get your attention that way. They'll want to chase you and find out what makes you think you're so special and confident.<br>  <br>  Guys LOVE when you ignore them or act cocky (cocky- not bi*chy).<br>  <br>  You can tell for sure they like you if they touch you or sit/stand way too close.|`|8i11907Maa	tell a stupid joke and see if they laugh or if they dont laugh and call you stupid. thats a pretty straightforward way haha
mwrSbSVuaa	What does the ex say?  You must have discussed the abortion, did she want anyone to know or keep it hush, hush?  She is your ex, but don't disrespect her.  As far as telling the new girl, I would give it some time before you go telling her if it was hush, hush.  You will have to break it to her in a tender way at the right time.  If other people openly know, however, then you'll have to tell her sooner, before someone else does.  My husband told me about his ex and their abortion when I asked why they broke up.  I was mortified for him...he wanted that baby.  Her Daddy bought her a car to get rid of it.  She still has that car...he still has the scars from losing that baby.|`|55765cc66dae020fdfa62c5759c7f28eaa	Your ex got an abortion for a reason: she didn't want the baby. That means she probably doesn't want you blabbing it to anyone, especially your friends. Besides, why would you tell them, they have nothing to do with this. It's not like your bragging about banging the top cheerleader in the locker room to the boys. Men don't normally brag about getting someone preggers.   As for the new girlfriend, I would throw out the box of condoms and get another batch. Also, ask her if she's on the pill or using another form of birth control, but don't tell her about the pregnancy. It's the past. The only thing you should disclose is if you contracted an std, but aside from that the past is the past.     If the baby was still alive, that's a whole other can of worms, but you don't have to concern yourself with that. consider yourself lucky dude. Oh, and by the way, if you didn't pay for that abortion, pay up now...be a man about it.    and don't, for heaven's sake, do not wear two condoms...that's how they break!|`|ZOakpNy7aa	First of all were you involved with your current girlfriend at the time this pregnancy occured? And if so whether or not your ex got pregnant is not the point The fact is you cheated and you need to tell your girlfriend.She has the right to know. And why do you feel the need to tell your friends unless  1 she was your friends girlfriend at the time. or  2 You want bragging rights that because you can get a girl pregnant that in some way makes you more of a man.? Dont degrade yourself your ex or your girlfriend. You plaster the word abortion on paper like it was a klenix  you blew your nose on. I not tring to insult you I just want you to see that your actions very well could have caused a lifetime or at least 18 years of Drama,Trama,Tears,And Lots and Lots of Money for alot of people. And Most of all it could have caused another child to be born into and grow up with the fact that he or she was not the missing piece to make a marriage of 2 people in love a perfect family.Instead to be born to a Dad and Mom who concieved her out of  Lust.Therefore a broken home and and a broken family life was planned for him/ her before he/she was born. We all need to think about tomorrow and stop living as we are the only ones that suffer from our actions.  A  few minutes of  feeling good is not worth a lifetime of regrets.. good luck to you.|`|sx55M7YRaa	Keep it to yourself and keep ya dick in ya pants if you can't put a condom on properly|`|EuCNBiq6aa	Your best friends have absolutely no reason to know that.  It's up to you whether or not you want to tell your current girlfriend. I suppose it also depends on her view of abortion. If she's pro-choice, she'd probably see it as none of her business in the first place, so it's not necessary to tell her.  If she's pro-life, you might consider telling her because if she finds out later on, she may feel like you were keeping something from her that may or may not have changed her opinion of you.|`|XcXii6fsaa	MAKE SURE YOU WEAR 2 IN CASE ONE BREAKS!        rofl|`|ZaMzRSrraa	no- DONT SAY ANYTHING TO ANYONE-- its all in the past and none of anyones business about your ex's abortion- that is private information!      please dont kiss and tell about past relationships-- unless it directly is affecting your currnt one ( if you had a STD that would be different)|`|kpW7Jyb2aa	If you were dating your current girlfriend while you got the last one pregnant, well I'm of the mind to fess up to my mistakes but not everyone is so that's your call.    If it was before you got with your current girl then sure tell her about it. It wa before you two got together so it shouldn't mean anything to her. I wouldn't go into complete detail about it. Just that you got her pregnant but the pregnancy didn't work out. If you feel comfortable telling her more then do it.    As for your friends.... word has a way of spreading. Tell your friends only what you told your girl, and make sure to tell your girl first. She finds out from one of them on accident then your *** is toast.|`|uw0Gx8m2aa	Calm down its not a big deal...its ur Ex not ur present one SO feel free to tell...

AA10918275	Talk to him in a casual way, as you would to a friend. Gauge his interest. you can tell a lot from how a person acts around you. and just because he's not interested in you now does not mean he would not like you ever. show him some interest while keeping your guards up. that way you can protect yourself from being hurt but still let him know that something might happen between you guys.

Just let him know you're fine with him being with someone else (even if your not), it'll help him be more friendly with you, and i think that'll help with your situation, the worlds full of guys, go and search!|`|OP6zAOULaa	hhhmmm. back when i was in hs that happened alot. really, he's not worth it. although make sure you dont go psycho and constantly contact him.

I guess your the one who has to decide in the end if it's love or something different.|`|cQw6JueFaa	ohh.. wow i am in the same boat. there is this girl i talk to online.<br>  she is a very fun person and very smart. i realy like her and i think she likes me. but she lives in europe and i live in USA but we think alike and we are same race and speak same language and we have many connections and similarities. i am hoping to visit her some time. mabie she might visit me this summer. i REALY hope this works out she is a realy awsome girl! :)|`|YJH5YcjBaa	something like that and i have been asking myself that for the past month...i think it isss then i think its not<br>  <br>  <br>  its all in you<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  buuuuuuuuuuuut, WARNING, you dont really ''know'' that person<br>  , so everything you ever thought was, probably isnt|`|PkUBJMd9aa	have u seen this person on webcam...spoke to them on the fone...aswell as seen them on webcam...please be carefull to meeting strangers on the net....but if u have seen them on cam on the fone etc and they're a nice person...then maybe its the real thing....good luck =]|`|wmoKm4jHaa	ive been in EXACT same posistion. the guy i wa dating was actually a girl. yeah . but now we still together : )))

If you're coming off as nice to them, then maybe you should evaluate how friendly you're being.  That being said, there are women out there who are attracted to married men because that wedding band is a symbol of the fact you can commit.<br>  <br>  Honestly though, if you're having women show too much interest in you, you need to tell them that you're happily married and not interested.  You make it sound like you're being nicer than you should.|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	I really do not know why some women 'go after married men'.

First married folks are reasonably a safe bet!<br>  <br>  How many men would go home to their wives and say damn honey that 20 year old I just met at the bar after work was fantastic she blows you outta the game. NONE!!  <br>  <br>  Their safe sex, cause they dont want to anyone to know they did it.<br>  <br>  or Two...<br>  <br>  They seek to find a sugar daddy.

"Caution: Do not enter" well, we want to enter. "Dont look behind you!" We look.

Make her have an orgasm during oral sex and the move on to something else. When she has an orgasm from that do something else. The absolute worse thing you can do is leave her unsatisfied, If this happens you will have trouble getting her to do anything. When both of you have had  your orgasm keep her close to you. Women need  emotional support as much as sexual support, especially after sex.|`|nZ49ukJvaa	easy!  you should simply explain to her that you are actually lollipop mc gravediggerzilla, the man who hadnt any teeth, cut off his fingers, and put them in his gums, because HAHA, now he can pop his knuckles every time he chews a good char broiled steak inside of his cozy tent inside of his cozy igloo|`|ambPUDB4aa	Simple play this song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80DtQD5BQ_A" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80DtQD5BQ...</a> and she will be unable to resist you.|`|DYlsqrMcaa	alcohol...works every time ;)|`|AaXl5YYkaa	run your fingers lightly over her. kiss her neck.... be creative.|`|MTqimWfEaa	Ask her.|`|W4IOLSzbaa	don't be fat, preheat the oven, and take an interest in her|`|vRe6CwgEaa	You need to stimulate her mind and do kind things for her.

izQn53q2aa	Tell her what you just wrote here.  If you like her then you need to tell her.  Usually if someone is staring at your mouth then yes, she wants you to kiss her.  Besides, what have you got to lose?|`|xs5J6VJTaa	She is waiting for you to make the move and kiss her. Go for it!!!|`|BZwJeuMGaa	suck it up and call her. ask her to go out with you on a date or something.<br>  <br>  its only awkward becasue you make it awkward. and KISS HER
dbQHlp85aa	She might just be rebelling.. maybe she got tired of the "prim and proper" life and wanted to "lash out at society".. <br>  <br>  What do her parents say about all of this?|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	She was probably gay from the start and didn't want to accept it at first. If she didn't sleep with her boyfriends but did with her then that is an obvious indication. If she likes girls so what. What ever makes her happy.|`|iPMpWtG6aa	Your friend may not be gay, but who is to say she is not.  Could she not be gay because she is beautiful, popular, president, best swimmer, and dated the rich cute quarterback.  And why on earth do you care if she is, if she is your friend what does it matter.  And nobody can make you gay, could someone make you gay? If you don't get it, possibly it is not meant for you to get.  If she is your friend then stay out her relationships unless they are causing her to not be beautiful, not be popular, not be president, not be the best swimmer, cause dating the rich cute quarterback doesn't mean anything if she's not happy doing it.
319f68749e1561bec57a3eb18244e1e3aa	If he is unwilling to  make the first moves (which sounds like it may be the case) perhaps you should. I will be straight forward with you, I don't believe in astrology and probably never will. But to me it sounds like he might just not be comfortable with making the first move, so if you wanted to you could make it (It doesn't have to be a kiss, but it could be something like holding his hand.)<br>  But do only what you feel comfortable with.|`|b6X6mmATaa	if you like him, go for it! i personally dont believe in astrology, but im not gonna bash your beliefs or anything. i think you should let what you really feel dictate how you act, especially when it comes to things like this.|`|49a82a8cdfa7d7006aafe861637faf39aa	thats cute, hes lucky, and he sounds like he likes you. I really don't know about astrology, but hell come around. just ask him if he is busy over the weekend and jump his bones.
tLVZXLRSaa	You also have other problems. Maybe you should stop calling girls weird and they'd actually go out with you.|`|mYQiWMFRaa	maybe you are turning...gay..?|`|gEK6UPwYaa	so many of them are such dumb bitches. but i guess thats life
p9j5zl4Naa	I agree with Ashley.  He is seeing how you would react in hopes that you react the way he wants you to.|`|iWWGiWqHaa	hes just testing you to see if youll look for someone else. he wants to be with you.
I9L0FUogaa	I don't think there's any possible way to guess how someone feels about you if there's no verbal communication. I know that this sounds like the most difficult task possible - but try talking to him. Not small talk, or something that he's interested in, but something YOU'RE interested in and know a lot about. If he doesn't, you can tell him about it. Try to converse...contrary to popular belief, small talk doesn't get anyone any where.|`|qHiBm3q7aa	Umm... well it could be i guess.. but the only advice I can give you is to start talking to you. He won't just ask you out if you have never talked to him. Get to know him it's the only way you will ever truely know. Good luck :)
rTaaIXSuaa	Well if he's talking a lot about you to others, are they good things or bad things?<br>  By the way he's acting, it might look like he's not interested in you or is an EXTREMELY shy dude.|`|zfWmQst5aa	Girl's need to stop thinking that it's the guys' job to ask out the girl all the time.<br>  <br>  I guess you can wait until he asks you, or finds a girlfriend, but that's completely up to you.<br>  <br>  ASK HIM OUT!!|`|PYF8cYtqaa	well be careful if you like him telll him wit hints but dont tell ur mom or she might fire the dude it happen to me i got fired for that and i didnt like the girl. but yeah think about it if do it and he get fired he mightnot like u
kTZevQNHaa	Oh this is very strange...I can't imagine why you felt guilty...unless maybe you didn't like him THAT much and maybe subconsciously felt a little bit disingenuous in your attraction (or lack thereof) to some aspect of this fellow...so not that you're cheating on him...but like you're cheating on YOU by settling for someone who really was not suiting your preference...not your type....or maybe you felt like this was not going to lead anywhere so you felt bad because maybe he felt it was...but you knew it was just a bit of noncommittal fun--and nothing more....so maybe you felt like you were leading him on and therefore, in a roundabout manner--sort of lying to him because you were not "that" into him...as much as he was into you.|`|nyq0gqpOaa	I put your text into all the translators I know of because I wanted to help you out, but it doesn't seem to be in any of the major languages.

Your guilt comes from somewhere and your not giving us enough Information to help you.|`|KJWd7q1Saa	no|`|xLDxUpAOaa	well...um it depends on how you met him and why you started going out. i-idk actually sorry lol. it could be you feeling guilty from something else? like another boy? mabye you thought u liked him but you dont so u felt guilty that deep inside u were getting his hopes up...lol i have no clue sorry!|`|V6MdE2mDaa	guilty of him being your boyfriend?<br>  <br>  Hm. Get him to be your BF again|`|DP3rQkrtaa	were you in love with someone else or just get him to be u'r boyfriend again.|`|QMRq8Cneaa	U felt guilty cus u were being too hard on urself. U felt like u didnt deserve him. Well, you did deserve him. If u both loved eachother, and he accepted u the way u are, then why the heck did u break up with him? That doesnt make sense. U need to not be too hard on urself and tell urself ur preety. And u probably are considering that u got a bf.
aITWZoQzaa	Give the girl the befit of the doubt that she can recognize between a creep and a nice guy.  Go and talk to her and see how it goes.
c5UAa65qaa	Wanting to see a tattoo on your hipbone's a little bit much, I'd say, especially if he recognizes it's not something you'd typically show off in public (hence the rush to close the door).  If you've never met his fiancee and don't know how she feels about even the verbal exchanges, I'd distance yourself - and definitely don't send the photos.<br>  <br>  And no, happily married men don't do this.  Not if they want to stay happily married, at least.|`|M4X3HOV5aa	all guys like to flirt, whether they are happily married or engaged. there is also a good chance that he would have sex with you if you were interested.|`|c1gnFE8Gaa	No not normal at all and not ok.<br>  <br>  Stay away mate he has the hots for you<br>  <br>  Dont hurt his partner (not that I am saying you will) but just dont, think about how you would feel, <br>  <br>  I wouldnt just adjust my attitude I would steer clear all together or tell him he is being a prick to his partner|`|B12E4rYiaa	If you get caught up with him he will do the same thing to you these kind of guys just keep doing it to feed their egos. Don't fall for his sleazy tactics. A waste of time it flatters some women, but it really is an insult.|`|RtkB46peaa	No worries.  It's perfectly normal for an ****** to behave this way.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	to late you got him .now ..|`|qw7BmBq6aa	The guy is a creep, stay away from him, seriously.  He probably only wants a picture of your tattoo so he can masterbate to it... I feel sick for his fiance, that is terrible he is behaving that way.<br>  <br>  I think next time he says something too nice you should tell him he's being innapropriate, and that you're pretty sure his soon to be wife wouldn't approve of his comments.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	He's flirting.  I would be okay w/ my man acting that way, but would not want the flirting to go any further.  Then again, my man would probably tell me about this girl at his office and tell me she's cute.  The honesty makes it easier to not care.|`|5wDjXzSraa	Same avatar, reworded question, different name. <br>  <br>  You already know the answer and you are enjoying the attention.

GHnkKwl3aa	Okay - this is just me:<br>  <br>  Hug: I hug people ALL the time. I don't go five minutes without hugging someone...not even joking. I'm very huggable. :D So, the hug wouldn't be a problem.<br>  <br>  I miss you: ...you just tell him you miss him...you do...don't you?<br>  <br>  Kiss: I'm Latin. We kiss to say hello (cheek). I have no problem going up to one of my guy friends (including my crush) and kissing them on the cheek. I wouldn't care if my guy friends just walked up to me and kissed me on the cheek. It's the cheek. That's like a friendly kiss. <br>  <br>  <br>  My advice:<br>  <br>  Go up to him, hug him and during the hug tell him you miss him, then just before you pull away from the hug give him a peck on the cheek.
juXQJJrXaa	DOES SHE GIVE YOU REASON DISTRUST HER??  IF NOT, CHANCES ARE UR RIGHT.. AND IF YOUR UNFAITHFUL, DO EVERYONE A FAVOR AND BREAK IT OFF.  YOUR NOT IN LOVE WITH HER IF YOU CHEAT ON HER.

t043WEDIaa	I'm an aries too and it looks like this kid is insane.  He met you a week ago!  If you keep in contact with him too much, he'll probably never stop.  He sounds like he will move on pretty quickly, and although he won't thank you for it in the beginning, he'll probably be much happier if you insist he leaves you alone.  But please try to be polite.  Good luck!|`|FsDcrFDiaa	i would suggest talking to him.  Blurt out little things as your talking like "i like this kid" or "i think he likes me" or something like that.  The guy should either a)start to try to understand you. or b)leave u alone cause he knows u dont like him ^^. if its the "a" option i would suggest confusing him even more until he just leaves. good luck|`|l7T0Ac3faa	you have to be mean and stern about it but remember not to say ...YOU ARE OBSESSIVE ..MAKE SURE TO SAY YOU ARE ACTING OBSESSIVE because he get pissed off and do something crazy ..but you need to cut all communication off with him|`|VeYbalAjaa	Grammar!

7BGYY9nKaa	Im with Fast Track--- but let me throw in some honesty with that.|`|FyqCMrCdaa	Personality, looks, every differentiation between her and the average girl produced in modern society. Us men want the unique woman not the average or normal woman. Once you get to the stage of being past looks(not neglecting them!) you seem to want more than that....That is what all men will soon seem to find. Even if your not america's next top model most men don't care even if you were. If your not a down to Earth girl then who are you foolin? Your not a Goddess nor will any woman ever be although they live and treat people like crap thinking they are. Don't be like them please. I happen to know a lot of women that win pageants and are very beautiful but i would not date them cause of their low-life-shallow personality. :)|`|wJstSw9Daa	Just type this question in the search bar and you'll see how many times girls have asked this question.

I even moved my desk but he still would come up to me.  One day I put  a desk right next to mine so he couldn't get through to bother me but he still moved the desk.  Anyway, he'll get over it, probably just immature.

Plus, he called you crazy so even if he did like you that's still messed up. Ignore him and tell your friend that you want her to get your picture back.

It's where you spend time with her but it's more around her family and you get to know them almost like you do her.  This will work to your advantage because the more you hang around them and the more that they see you and get to know you, the more they will trust you with their daughter and be more likely to let you guys go out to a movie or something.

Nothing bad can happen from kissing someone except for a few diseases like mononucleosis. I've kissed many people and I've never gotten sick once. <br>  <br>  Think of this, though: If you kiss her and she gets mad and ends your relationship, that is the same result as if you never pursued your relationship. In other words, if you kiss her you might win or you might lose, but if you don't kiss her then you definitely lose. You might as well take the risk.<br>  <br>  "You miss every shot you don't take."  -- Wayne Gretsky.|`|0OB7yhCKaa	i'm not 12-14 anymore more but when i was i wasnt allowed to date either! and i wanted boys to like me and i woulda liked one to kiss me even more because of it!!! however thats not a good reason to kiss a boy so you should ask her and see if she truly likes you and wants to kiss you!!|`|utOVoGo3aa	Respect her, if she does not want to kiss you then let it be. And I have no clue if she is going to kiss you because I don't know anything about your girl.

MtEZChaGaa	It is a problem within yourself.. you don't have enough self-esteem and respect towards yourself ! You do not think you are worthy enough to be completely loved and loyal to. You have to stop worrying about these things. Go and do your own thing.. and If he is in fact the kind of person which you can't trust... you will know in time.

aHWGRNbDaa	I've had a boyfriend like that. He's showing his affection for you and I think it's cute. If you are definite about waiting then talk to him about it, even if he already knows he may be tempted to when you guys are making out. Remind him that he needs to relax and just take it slower. My boyfriend loves touching me and holding me but it's great because it's like never gone past the point of annoying.

You may have no choice but move the actual marriage date closer or risk losing him to someone more willing. You can also get a legal marriage in front of judge, then set a date for the big wedding ceremony. Are ya'll both agreeing to this, or is he just being "agreeable".  Keep in mind while ya'll are "making out in bed", your just warming him up, then leaving him half baked. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_balls" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_balls</a>|`|bf3bc2c3811507a54ef69dd9118ca5a3aa	It's between you and him.

GOOD LUCK|`|9tbupRCuaa	That girl, the way she reacted, seemed like she likes you too! She wants you to do something. She's the girl, of course, she'll initiate a thing to let you know. Do something.

w109EDfmaa	Since he is in a relationship then do try anything with this guy. His girl did nothing to you so you should respect her in that aspect. If you had a guy and he had a great girl friend just as a friend how would you feel about that situation? If he wanted to be with you like that then he would be with you right now. Maybe you should go explore other options and find yourself someone to connect with. Its better then hoping that you two end up together. If its meant to be then it will happen but don't be a realtionship ruiner by trying to get him all to yourself especialy since you know he loves her. Plus if I was his gf I would be pissed about how you two carry on. Its wrong on both your parts.|`|2d8c6f27c3437723163ff69e22f22598aa	i been in that saaaaame situation. me and my friend went to prom together, next thing i know, him and his gf broke up and me and him are together. it was so great i was completely in love, but he ended up leavin me for his ex gf. i was like sooo heartbroken so if i were you, i would leave it alone. maybe one day yall will be together. who knows|`|OCdJ38EQaa	leave him alone. seriously. he has a gf so **** off. girls like you are bitches. if its meant to be then it will be, but for now, LET IT GO.|`|AA11812482	U LOVE HIM, AND HE WANTS U...SO....GO 4 IT!|`|5G7YWzTGaa	JUST DATE THE GUY =)|`|Ki90Irkcaa	If a part of you feels that he wants to be more than friends, then back off. You will be stepping on your friends toes, more than you already have, and you don't want no problems with that, because no matter what he does, you will always look worse because you knew your friend is dating him. Second, you need to find your own guy. The best advice is to just back off, because you guys will hurt her in the worst way.

Mostly guys are not that interested in these progs.|`|lPSiVbBvaa	dancing, i dont think its girly, but some argue that it is lol|`|mYQiWMFRaa	a guy that can sit through a chick flick and not get bored.|`|vwL7twjPaa	your dad not try hard enough?|`|J4EVtMFtaa	hahaha<br>  im a guy<br>  im into cars u stay with ur make up and gossip probs<br>  my only prob woudl be my car lol
vwL7twjPaa	she's using for the attention she doesn't receieve from her BF.. she will not go out with you, she will not sleep with you, nor will she start anything with you (hence the drama). these girls are typical and only use them for learning experiences.. <br>  <br>  move on bro.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	She's stringing you along to see how far she can manipulate you with sexual innuendo.
jIzlX1rdaa	Well dude, this is every guys worst nightmare. Firstly if you are friends with any of her friends then ask them if they know if she likes you or if shes looking for a girlfriend. Then spend a coupla days talking to her (text, msn, etc), this way she is thinking about you because you're talking to her. This is where you can drop hints that you like her, sometimes the really cheesy stuff works like if she is saying she looked really horrible today (I don't know why but girls always say this but they do and its great to play off of) you can say things like, "I think you looked beautiful" or "You always look great to me", she will probably reply with something like "Awww thanks". Now once you both know a little about each other (because all though you may know her a lot some girls don't want to go out with guys they don't know much about) Thia is what I do (it usually works for me). <br>  Tell her you like her a lot, saying this to her face takes a lot more guts than msn and stuff because you get an immediate reaction, if you do this look at her facial reaction, if she smiles, you in, if she kind of look uncomfortable, sorry dude... and of you can't tell, say ask if she wants some time to think about it. If she says she feel the same way then pop the old question in, if she says "Sorry but...." just say it's O.K even though you're probably crushed inside.<br>  Now if she does reject you, let me be the 1st to say " Sorry dude, she just couldn't have been the one." Now I'm not gonna lie, it's gonna hurt, you're gonna feel upset but don't let it get to you because you did the right thing and she just didn't feel the same. After watching a lot of chick flicks (I got tons of girl mates XD) you start pick up on the whole eating ice cream after a bad occasion, someone told me "It doesn't get rid of the heartbreak but it softens the blow" (this also works for me). But just give it time and things will be normal again.<br>  <br>  DON'T act all hard around her its not what girls want they want someone who is going to be there for them and tell them they love you without being told<br>  DON'T show her off to your peers, it would be as if you are treating her as an object and she will hate that<br>  <br>  Try not to forget special occasions, like the date you met, her birthday, and things like that, it won't turn out well if you do (another past experience =])<br>  <br>  Hopefully I haven't missed anything out, if I have then message me.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, took me like an hour to write this =]<br>  <br>  And good luck but I'm sure if you just be you, everything will turn out fine|`|FYH2xl6Naa	It all depends on the girl. Ask her out the way you THINK she wants to be asked out. Nothing cheesy,
qHiBm3q7aa	ok well this is tough for you because she is dating your best friend and if she stops dating your friend you need to first talk to your best friend about how you liked this girl forever and if it would be cool if you give it a shot with her. The last thing you want is to make it super awkward with your best friend. Second, make sure this girl doesn't just see you as a friend. Plus look at it from her point of view if she stops dating your best friend I don't know if she would even like to go out with her "ex's" best friend. The whole situation is just really awkward, but if it isn't then go for it after talking to your friend. Good luck :)|`|4pyoJ9ZBaa	You shouldn't get back at her for dating your best friend. It doesn't really sound like she did anything wrong. I mean if she told you that she actually liked you and she just went on dating your friend, then that's a different story. If he is your so called best friend, then you should be happy for your friend. If you try to get back at her, your friend might be upset, causing you and him to start an argument.|`|gmBzMFDLaa	well obviously she likes ur best friend.<br>  the only thing u can do is back off.<br>  if you're cool through the whole situation, she'll think thats hot
klcqgST9aa	To be honest, I'd hate that.<br>  <br>  But, if she likes getting high, I'm sure she'd love to get high with you.<br>  <br>  Like any girl, if she likes to do something, she'd love to do it with a guy she likes.|`|AA10149603	well thats the only time i enjoy getting high (with my only man) it makes you sexual aroused so if you don't want that to happen don't do it|`|7IoBuuL4aa	NO!! i have a ton of guy friends that get high all the time! and they invite me everytime but honestly i won't do that with a guy i like! i don't want to lose control of myself like that. my friend was dating this guy who was getting high all the time and she didn't want to get high with him but he would be high ALL the time and then would lie about it because he knew it made her mad when he was high and they fought all the time and broke up! don't invite her to go with but don't lie to her about it either. k? just be like i'm going to get high and if she says i want to come with then great but if she doesn't want to don't try to force her.|`|7EDGtYVoaa	stop getting blazed.  most girls i know really really do not like guys that smoke anything<br>  <br>  PS please answer my question<br>  <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtPeXjX8AreSVyIhlsNc32rg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090219204642AA4ofv9">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|470e7367616ada33a5e0f857c15fe4afaa	YAAAA! i luvv it
mNaJGPzMaa	It depends on what you fight about.... if you both learn to listen to each other and compromise then you won't fight. And if she says that its always you but you know that she is wrong too sometimes then maybe you should talk to her about it and let her know that you both make mistakes and you'll both have to put effort into the relationship to make it work. Let her know that you don't want to fight anymore and that you both should accept each others and your own mistakes and talk about it not fight. I hope this helped. good luck.
UtUC7cuBaa	How old are you guys?  He seems a bit immature|`|MFTY5v1Laa	well you don't know how he really feels until you two actually hang out and maybe he's not replying because he's been busy.
EZ1cPPvkaa	Realizing that you are a great person is a wonderful start.  There is nothing more attractive than a confident woman, and there is nothing wrong with you not dating often.  So many women go on dates with people they don't even like that much, just because they feel that they should be dating.  The right kind of partner takes a long time to find, and in the meantime, take comfort in the fact that you are an amazing woman with plenty to offer to the right person when they come along.|`|AA10495394	Just be happy that you have life and can enjoy it.

Or should you? How would u not get over this is by not learning from your past mistakes which will not not lead u in the right direction in self-improving urself to have a more pernament boyfriend. The logic behind this is think before u act which is not not not not right (four nots = yes). You have to be able to depict a guys personality just like that so he could like you because u would know what the not guy would not be not interested in not. I am very insightful on this.|`|Mo2J38uAaa	Just go out and have fun and not worry so much about dating. It's not a bad thing that you're single. You have more freedom to do what you want.

MJyM1XWJaa	Let me start out by saying disregard the first few answers (at least the first few that I saw) because they have no idea what it's like to be in this situation AND they limit themselves to finding a match that lives in close proximity to themselves.<br>  <br>  You and I on the other hand didn't ask to be in a long distance relationship. But sometimes a feeling is so strong, who is to say we are right to fight it? And why do people think that the person meant for them is someone who lives in their town? <br>  <br>  I'm also in a long d relationship. Didn't start out that way and of course it won't end that way but DAMN IT'S HARD RIGHT?! Ugh. People do this all the time though, whether it be for work or military or whatever. <br>  <br>  Maybe you should ask him what's up? Check to see what's going on in his mind and how he's feeling about the relationship. Do things that make you closer. My bf and I keep a journal (composition notebook) and write eachother letters when we can't talk on the phone or I'm in lecture at uni. We paste in pictures of us together, pictures of us blowing kisses to the other, drawings, etc. You can do things that keep you closer together until you can be physically in one another's presence. <br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope things work out!!|`|klOP21xTaa	Distance in relationships doesn t work at all, for all you know he could have a girl there and you are being all faithful, i would let him go and find someone closer who is accessible, that you can hang with and do all that stuff together.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	Wow, do you leave citites, states, or countrys away from each other.<br>  <br>  Yeah you live too far from each other.|`|tc178rzeaa	This is a relationship????????????????????????????...|`|GujkIOoqaa	you need to think about the whole picture.<br>  <br>  if u have been dating for 6 months and havent seen him in 5... this means you were only together for one month!  this isnt doesnt seem like enough time to really fall in love with someone!<br>  <br>  you have to ask youself these questions.<br>  <br>  1.  are you going to see him again soon?  if so then stick it out and dont do anything until you see him or you might regret it!<br>  <br>  2.  are you going to have to wait 5 or more months to see him every time?  is so, then it might get hard as you have to do this kinda thing over and over again!  BUT if u will start to be able to see them more as time goes on, then u might consider toughing it out.<br>  <br>  Now for opening up... you have to make sure you trust him and you need to show him that.  he cant be intimadated and feel the need to hide things from you!  but just always be honest with him and soon he will open up!|`|0yuxnSocaa	You know long distance relationships arent for every one. But if you honestly and truly love him, no ditance is too far. Most guys dont like opening up because they may think it is "fruity" to be emotional , but in fact it isnt. So just ask him and say something like, I really wish i could see some emotion in you. Does this help|`|yo6OTEXnaa	it is bad<br>  <br>  u should break up with him<br>  <br>  hes prob cheating on u ryt now at this min<br>  <br>  prob having sex with a diff girl<br>  <br>  and once again its called guilt<br>  hes txting  and calling  u  to make you<br>  not worry  and suspicious about him goin out with a diff girl<br>  <br>  <br>  get up and  call him<br>  <br>  and tell  him its over!|`|54GHFbTraa	Holy shitt! 16 hours?

If you bug him about it, it might drive him further away. <br>  <br>  A little surprise visit might be in order to see what your sweetie is up to these days.|`|PmNGnHU8aa	you were dating for 6 months and havent seen eachother for 5 of those months?? wow.

RH7K4rsmaa	Instead of waiting for him to figure all of this out, why don't you plan something with a group of people. This way, you could say "we are all going for pizza (or whatever) want to join us?" Much easier than trying to figure out what he's thinking. <br>  <br>  It's much easier to flirt in a group setting. Good luck!

a2MZLS2Qaa	Wow!!! i went trough the same thing!!! 2 years ago. First you need to stop sleeping with him. Then you need to make yourself unavailable. My mistake was to stick around and be his doormat, thats what your doing. If you love him, you need to let him go. If its meant to be then he would come back. the reason why he is still hooking up with you and answers to your txt, or email is because he misses you in his life. But women to women..you NEED to let him go, he will see that you can have your own life without him. that you don't NEED him, i know you do. but Be strong...tell you friends to help you out, delete him from your phone. Like i said If it's meant to be he will come back. <br>  <br>  I'm with the same guy that treated me like a doormat for 4 years now. that year i wasn't with him was HELL. but you know what? he learned to appreciate me.  <br>  <br>  Maybe he can appreciate you too. but you gotta teach him not to treat you that way. Be strong, hold your ground men find that attractive in a women that she can be good and doesn't need a man in her life to be happy..hope that helped. keep your head up.. ok?|`|THe0Jt0haa	I think I am in the exact same situation as you are.<br>  Well, except the guy i am in love with isn't going around sleeping with girls, he has a girlfriend and they never ever hang out or talk really.<br>  <br>  But back to you, If you still love him and you have a gut feeling that you are suppose to be with him, then i say go for it, tell him how you feel.<br>  I might be a hypocrite for saying that cause im not doing the same thing, but it's way better than bottling everything you are feeling for him.<br>  <br>  If he says he doesn't feel the same way, than the best thing to do would be to remian friends, and try and move on.<br>  <br>  This has happened to me before with the same guy that i was in love with.  He broke up with me, and i just cut him off completely for about 4 months, after that we gradually started talking again, and he said that he fell back in love with me.<br>  <br>  Im in the process of doing this again and it's working out pretty good.<br>  so i would say just cut him off for a while.<br>  If he comes back to you, then you know he loves you.|`|d880c9bfefbe824a62d3c49507d0b53eaa	Run!

When i met him I had 3 kids and 1 on the way and now we have 2 more(yes total of 6 boys now) and still to this day his family will have nothing to do with me...which is sad because they will also have nothing to do with our children( I am not talking the ones I ha=d previous to him either I mean OUR mutual children) and i feel they are missing out on so much just because of the fact that they discouraged him of being with me because I had children before him...it is More important that the person you are with is able to accept your child than if anyone else around him is able to accept you. You have the whole world in the palm of your hands girl I am sure you will find someone wonderful for you and your daughter. Good luck!!!|`|ukZcr3ftaa	If you love the person, & you believe that the person loves you... There's no reason to worry on anything...|`|AA10821051	As long as you guys are happy and the kid is doing well, I don't really see what the big deal is.|`|OCTvfDsxaa	First of all, a few details about me- I had my first daughter when I was 16 and in school. I also had 2 more children with the same guy while I was in school. I was pregnant when a got my diploma. I was  sure it would be hard to find someone to date me with all the kids. Honestly, it didn't take long before a really good guy wanted to try dating. He never dated anyone with kids but he wanted to try. When things got serious took his parents out to a nice dinner alone to tell them he was seeing a girl with kids. They were so excepting of us that I was moved. I have went out with other guys that were just as excepting. I think your going to be surprised of the openness you will get from other people in your search for the right relationship.|`|vw0qsY6Iaa	Not at all! First of all you shouldnt worry what people think of you. Your post makes you sound as if you are ashamed of yourself, and if you are, people will assume the worst. You are one of millions of single moms in the world. You arent an alien!<br>  I was a single parent and so was my husband (i am on his yahoo account right now) when we met. I had a daughter and her "father" disappeared when I was 3 months pregnant. It wasnt my fault and I didnt do anything wrong (other than choose an immature *** of a man to sleep with) Lesson learned, and I never made that mistake again! I knew I was a catch, and I never gave a crap what anyone else thought about me, especially if they didnt even know me! And I held my head up high and I was proud of myself for sucessfully raising my child (very well) all on my own. With no help from welfare or anyone. (except my parents lol) I had a good job and no college degree to boast of. But I was a responsible and determined woman/ mother/ and daughter. I eventually found a great man and married him a year later and we now have a total of 4 kids. 1 his, 1 mine, and 2 ours. <br>  <br>  Dont worry, your doing just fine. And even without all that external education crap, you are still worthy of love and acceptance. Its not whats on your resume that matters, its what is in your heart.|`|HMsgbFENaa	My concern would not be that you don't have your stuff together. It does sound like you are confident, smart, and goal orientated. I would be a little more concerned with the fact that you do have a daughter, are in school full time (I assume) and have a job (I assume). I would think that this would leave very little time for you to date let alone pursue a relationship. I think that I would wand you to finish school before we moved from the "friendship" stage to a relationship stage.  and effort and you might just be a little low on the time issue right now.|`|VSG70WcFaa	you go and get him!!! <br>  my cousin had her daughter at 16 and she found a guy that loves her 9 years later,<br>  girl you bringing up your daughter by yourself is enough, to prove anything to any man or his parents.<br>  so all the other school stuff is just frosting. <br>  your a beautiful single mother wanting, looking for love.<br>  there is no rule in love saying you can't try again.|`|9fpJSgsbaa	You sound as though you have it together and have bounced back very well after the father of your child showed what he was made of and split. I really do think that your other accomplishments would make it easier for people to accept you as their sons/brothers girlfriend.<br>  A 24 year old guy may be a little immature for your situation but it all depends, some guys at 24 act as though they are 17 and some are reasonably mature. It all really depends on how much he likes/loves you.<br>  I wouldn't think any less of you if I didn't know about the deans list and the other things, it's really hard to say exactly what I'd think as you need to meet people to have any real idea at all.<br>  Best of luck with everything, your bub sounds like she's got a really good mummy.
1hcupwT4aa	Lol yeah I know what you mean.<br>  <br>  It's always either "nice rack" "hot a*s" "great legs" "smoking body" -- can you say ew? I agree I mean compliments are great and all but sometimes guys can get a little over the top. Like, I don't always need to be aware that they are staring at me you know?<br>  <br>  I dunno. For me, I usually say something like "hah yeah right, stop lying" and/or make some sexual teasing comment to catch them off guard which I have to admit is more fun than it sounds, and it usually gets them to shut up.<br>  <br>  My one rule: they can look (although, no idea why they'd want to) but can't touch, and if they do look I don't always need to hear about it!<br>  <br>  EDIT: I still hear those real compliments sometimes, and when it comes before the teasing comments about the rest of me it makes it easier to separate the users from the sweethearts. You know? Nice guys are awesome. But they wouldn't be special if everyone was like that.|`|1vaqtRI2aa	I agree with the person said it's time for you to meet some new people.<br>  <br>  This is quite simple, really: Don't ever just settle for a guy who says "Oh hey, nice rack", because clearly he doesn't respect you as a person- he simply see's you as a sex object. He more likely than not will only want to hook up and not pursue a serious relationship. And if he does, it most likely won't be successful. Of course, there are exceptions, but like I said, in the beginning if he says "nice rack", he see's you as just that. A pair of boobs.<br>  <br>  I've never taken a guy seriously who said these comments to me. If a guy REALLY likes me, he will be a little more creative. And if he's worthwhile, we will be a little more classy. Hope this helps in some way, a good luck- Because I'm fed up with it too!|`|qsjGiaW2aa	because this generation of men are all pigs in the sense they only look at ones body than their face. if there are men out there that do compliment you on your hair or eyes it either because he's gay or maybe he's one in a million. I get the same compliments everyday and trust me i feel the same way as you do.|`|Gk7BeNPSaa	for me i don't need to tell a girl that her boobs are sweet, but i do like eyes on girls it's what i look for. i bet, you have sweet eyes that will make me fall to the floor.|`|mzf1buHCaa	oh, cry me a river. maybe you should just be flattered that people think you have good boobs.|`|07HWkV4eaa	Why can't I see your boobs? Show the boobs!|`|xJCc01oRaa	Nice boobs.|`|zYt0kPtzaa	YES and having a E size makes it well not easy to push them out of the way.<br>  <br>  Guys are just perverts these days|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Guys are guys and they'll see a nice pair of jugs before they start looking at other details.|`|FdGBJdU9aa	LOL Bubbles you must have a great rack. Actually it's a cheap shot and a shoddy compliment unless you're a pole dancer.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	Please, don't take this the wrong way.  You're asking a question and I'm just trying to help.  Sure most men like that, not all since I've heard the line about more than a handful is a waste.  But if it really bothers you sometimes, I would suggest that (just to see what happens) you buy some more conservative(now I'm not talking nun like style), something that minimize that part and use a make-up that put the accent on your eyes and go to a hairdresser and have something new done to your hair that will put the emphasis to your face and hair.  Wouldn't that be kind of fun to try?  It doesn't take anything away from you, it will just accentuate the whole picture(the whole pretty you).  I'm not suggesting to throw your whole wardrobe away.  I'm just thinking for a change once in a while when you feel like you want to hear something else.|`|ff545BLyaa	I could care less about a girls brests, its like my uncle always use to say before he died " If its more than a handful its a waste"...  (love my uncle).. I tend to agree with him and believe me if you have green eyes I will be the first one to tell you how pretty they are....  Love like shoulder leanth hair on a girl too its soo sexy.... What I am rying to say is that not all guys are looking for a girl with a huge rack or a nice ***....|`|Bx7F9jscaa	I actually get normal compliments more often. Which is pretty cool to me. I think that our society is overly focused on sex but it's still taboo in a way, so everyone is confused. Haha.|`|aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	wow.. what kind of crowd do you hang around with??!  might be time to meet some new people who are actually decent..
fP46meSmaa	making fun or she isn't used to saying hi.**
12xBKdkqaa	There really is no way to "let a girl down easy," I'm sorry.<br>  The only thing you can do is sit down with her and tell her straight up, considering her feelings, of course. Depending on her personality, she might throw a fit, cry a lot, cuss you out, etc.<br>  But that's really just a girls way of trying to make a guy feel sorry for her enough to take her back.<br>  Don't fall for it. Tough it out and explain to her why it won't work. Hopefully you can still remain friends and both find someone else that actually makes you happy.<br>  Good luck, and sorry you're in a tough predicament.|`|LkOcJRRWaa	Just tell her what you told us...you are not happy with her attitude and the way she treats people.  it is your life and you will not be happy if you stay with her.|`|09X3ozvzaa	Tell her..."I discovered I have a mild form of epilepsy and you bring on attacks because you make me too excited to be around you."|`|V6MdE2mDaa	Hmm.<br>  <br>  Explain to her everything. <br>  <br>  Tell her its not working out, or maybe like we should just be friends.|`|Ix2eWrswaa	tell her you dont think the relationship will last and you think you should end it now on a good note and stay friends|`|SR04mlQQaa	Try roofies and leave her in the woods|`|IgPFRVtDaa	tell her before it is too late. <br>  or it will hurt more.<br>  at east u didnt do "it"|`|Erdyu0bEaa	No the sex part should not because she has not actually had intercourse with you which is good because you want to break it off with her now. Sit her down talk to her and discuss how you think that you too should take a break because your either trying to find your self or where you want the relationship to be ...just make something up that sounds excusable and not as harsh as in its over. or Im dumping you. Tell her you think you too should take a break because you feel that its not working or that you think your better off friends. Does not matter how you put it, it still may hurt her but atleast it will not be as hurtfull. Good luck.|`|JiBAc9xmaa	nah it would only cause more trouble if you guys didd have sex but its good that you didnt..that way you can let her down more easly. Just telll her that you really do like her but more as a friendd; just tell her the truthh.. what you said in the questionn you asked uss.. tell her your just different people and it was a good thing that you guys tried going out but that it didnt really work as well as you wantedd it to and that your sorry. she should understandd!|`|kELDXjkgaa	No matter how you do it, you are going to bein the doghouse, but you know what you want.  Let her know that the friendship is important to you, but you do not want to be in a relationship with her.  It is good that you have not gone all the way.  She will be upset, but the longer you wait will likely cause more problems.|`|yZ9bSoyUaa	My suggestion is, tell her that you feel that you two were better friends and you don't want to take the chance of losing the friendship that you guys have if something were to go wrong in the relationship. If she brings up the fact that you said that you loved her, simply state the fact that you may love her but its not quite the same as being in love with someone, and that you were confused and apologize. Tell her that you hope that you can still be friends and that you understand that you guys might need sometime to figure things out.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...good luck!|`|Fd0vQ6HDaa	I think you should be honest with her first of all. Let her know that at this point in yall relationship you feel that she is not the right person for you and before it goes any further you think it should stop now especially since yall don't have sex as of yet. Once sex come into the picture it's going to be even harder to get rid of her.<br>  <br>  Be honest !!!! it's the best policy !!!!|`|a3R1NxH5aa	well being physical with each other will make it harder for her and she doesn't seem like your type its exactly like how me and my bf were i was the nice one and very active and he wasn't but if shes not your type you should dump her i think you should talk to her hope everything works out well!|`|LGCTOxZxaa	Just tell her that for you, the relationship spark died, but you honest to god dont wanna lose her as a friend. It might be a little awkward at first (The lack of hooking up), but that will pass. Hope all goes well!<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|8fbe16559a0547f51fbf785d4de89899aa	No a physical relationship wont cause to much trouble but you should just tell her its not working out. And if she is like you say she is you should do it now. Be careful|`|4ftOPCoQaa	wright her a poem about how great she is and end it say but a perfect friend is  only a friend. watch her read it and hug  her when she finishes then say sorry|`|UtUC7cuBaa	One bullet to the head usually works especially if she doesn't see it coming|`|ldAJ3Et8aa	**** her then never call her again. That's what I did and my life is awesome!|`|Zk7uWuoVaa	is it the same one that messes aroud down there cuse if it is dont break up|`|MMaATnAiaa	just tell her then|`|WTvOHjXmaa	Three important rules for breaking up<br>  Don't put off breaking up when you know you want to<br>  Prolonging the situation only makes it worse<br>  Tell him honestly, simply, kindly, but firmly<br>  Don't make a big production<br>  Don't make up an elaborate story<br>  This will help you avoid a big tear jerking scene<br>  If you wanna date other people say so<br>  Be prepared for the boy to feel hurt and rejected<br>  Even if you've gone together for only a short time,<br>  And haven't been too serious,<br>  There's still a feeling of rejection<br>  When someone says she preferres the company of others<br>  To your exclusive company,<br>  But if you're honest, and direct,<br>  And avoid making a flowery emotional speech when you brake the news,<br>  The boy will respect you for your frankness,<br>  And honestly he'll apeciate the kind of straight foward manner<br>  In which you told him your decision<br>  Unless he's a real jerk or a cry baby you will remain friends|`|5Ioe0GE8aa	Just tell her that you guys are different and it just isn't working out. Of course she is going to be upset but she will get over.|`|xJBJn6dOaa	It's only been two months, and she's already acting like a crazy girlfriend. It will only get worse... you are right in wanting to break up with her.<br>  <br>  Just tell her you think you're better off as friends. If she asks why, be honest. Tell her you can't picture yourself going out with her in the long run. She'll understand and hopefully will be your friend.|`|QpyX8RQFaa	Let her down easy. In the long run it will make a better person of you when you let go of the ones that hurt you the most.<br>  <br>  and i don't it will cause trouble. but make sure your heart doesn't tell you what your doing is wrong to let her get this far when you don't like her.<br>  <br>  my thoughts:]|`|OLpWRv2uaa	Say this "Hello. I was thinking that I may be gay and need some time to think about what I want to do with my sex life" she will understand and allow you to have your time with other men.|`|9607f07a7fcd3e1d711c44cbed59369faa	No way to avoid the hurt. The best thing to do is be up front and honest with her.|`|dbQHlp85aa	Well, if you haven't had sex yet.. don't do it now obviously. <br>  <br>  "letting someone down easy" is never easy.. in fact i have no idea where that even came from. One way or another.. the dumpee is always going to be hurt. <br>  <br>  So I would just tell her that this isn't really working out for you and you liked it better when you were just friends. But be prepared for the nasty side of her to come out if you say she's mean and hateful. <br>  <br>  Tell her you don't want to hurt her but you can't be in a relationship with someone who's so negative all of the time... it's bothers you the stuff she says about people because it's just not you. Tell her you're really sorry but it just can't go on any longer.
1nN3v4foaa	Ya really haven't given us a lot to go on.  It's hard to say why, but I would go with her actions and not her words.  She maybe afraid to be honest with you.  Actions speak louder!
Pnn3VgFpaa	I would not do anything, to be honest. Even if I would actually be charmed, first of all, you would have met him a single time, so what would you do anyway? And if I would see him more often (cos of work or whatever), I just can't see myself going after a married guy, because I don't want to hurt people.<br>  <br>  But you can rest assured that there are more women who will not share my opinion.<br>  Do tell me though, where lies this Utopia you speak of, where manners and good morals prevailed? :)|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	You know not all women are scum.  Usually when the "M" word makes its entrance into the conversation, single women will head the other way.........they want someone single, someone interested in them, and someone they can have think about them and only them.<br>  <br>  Now........this is most women - but not ALL women.<br>  <br>  If you think there is someone trying to steal your husband, pull out all stops, unleash the claws, and go after her.  If she knows he's married and still tries - she's horrible.  But so is your husband if he gives in to her - are you afraid that he will?|`|hUXAA4Zcaa	I for one, NEVER got involved with someone who is married.  I find it wrong and disrespectful.  Unfortunately, a lot of women don't feel this way.  Some women even get off on the fact that a man is married- something about the thrill of not getting caught.  It's wrong, but people are who they are.  I too grew up in a very strict, religious household, and when I hit the real world I was caught off guard by the morals of other people.  Oh, and by the way, age definitely doesn't matter- I'm 22 and my boyfriend is 33.|`|ou3wQcuYaa	Personally I think men are off limits if they are in a relationship.  I have seen a lot of people I am close to get hurt by there partner cheating.  I also know a few women who have been the lover of a person in a relationship.  Yes, some women think it is ok to cross any line.  Hopefully, none of your friends feel this way.  What do you mean about your daughter?|`|NbmnWwqEaa	I don't date or go after married men.<br>  I, personally, would be respectful . . .  as I give out what I want in return and believe "what goes around comes around."<br>  <br>  I wouldn't do that to another woman .  .  . try to get her man; as I wouldn't want it done to me if I was married.|`|8o7s9tynaa	I'd leave him well alone, seeing as he's already spoken for. As for whether some women are bad, well yes they are, but some men are bad too. Who is this mother and daughter that are after him? I'd get them out of your lives if I were you.|`|xkGfxn70aa	Married means off limits if he has respect for you and himself.|`|Zjgmm9t5aa	I  would dig a new hole for that man|`|IWJULg3Yaa	I am a married woman and respect women.Would never break or spoil another women's relationship because of his man-no matter how he is.He is hers for keeps.<br>  I personally will not go for any married men even when a married man may take interest -its disgusting as I can understand how a women can feel in such situations.<br>  My message to all those ladies who look for just fun with married men out there-- "Get your own man or better get a SINGLE man Ladies,if you got gutts-why should you enjoy the fruits of some one else's labor.|`|5p2AiZLWaa	I personally wouldn't go out with a married man, it would just be more hurt for me.|`|KUhZX3Hbaa	I'd bang him while you watched tied up in the corner.|`|61Fwbi79aa	The daughter thing freaks me out.|`|PuV9lh37aa	Yes|`|gw0UzZg3aa	it depends on the women <br>  if shes out there looking for a good time then shes gona try and get at him<br>  but if a nice respectful women comes along then i think she would respect ur marrage<br>  and its also how much u trust ur husband...?<br>  do u trust him?<br>  cuz u even writing this right now kinda makes it seem like u dont trust him muchhh..|`|dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	personally i think if he's married he's off limits, but their are skanks out their who wouldn't care.<br>  <br>  i don't think any mom would want to hook their daughter up with a married guy..at least not a good mother|`|iKJycf6Zaa	This is freaky. Anyway, I would leave him alone. Because I'm married and I hate "other women" and I don't want to be one.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	i would leave him alone! married means unavailable to me, i don't care how sexy he is.
zIoWCX7vaa	sense of humorr
xLDxUpAOaa	Well...im a girl so how i personally would like to be asked would be like: You: Hey um ____ you doing anything on ____? Her: why? You: well....i was wondering if you wanted to maybe see a movie? with me? and she'd say yes and a happy ending :] lol. but just dont carry it out for that long like pauses, keep it straight to the point. we like a guy whos confident ;]
Q3DfmT5Gaa	just got to be yourself and make more of an effort to be around him. if he doesnt like you its not meant to be
Zjgmm9t5aa	OOOHHH girl, can I come too? I love to watch people run trains, especially dem young-ins. You should wear denim overalls, and some man boots. Bring him a banana, and ask him if you could be the caboose.|`|15xdNe2gaa	wear somthin sexi<br>  toot toot<br>  have fun!|`|fwPvnlkNaa	hes too old for u u need to move on and find a better person|`|lXE75yQjaa	Aww..that's sweet!

6e083f2ba7e3043fb68160d6bfe280dcaa	Firstly, if mom likes him... he's got to be a keeper.<br>  Because not too many guys can put something over on mom.<br>  Sounds to me you might have a good thing. I say "might" because you two haven't really made a commitment.<br>  You mention he is "supportive". That's a very good sign. And being kind and having a sense of humor makes for a great trifecta.<br>  <br>  You don't want to push him into doing something he's not ready to do, so you have to be cool.<br>  One way is to inform him that you will be leaving the country this summer on vacation, and... "What are the chances you'll still be here when I get back? That I would like to pick up where we left off. How do you feel about that?"<br>  <br>  That's kind-a straight forward. You're looking for an honest answer, I'm sure you'll get the one you want.<br>  Enjoy your trip.<br>  <br>  PS - As far as "growing up": Yes... but not too soon. Enjoy your young years. They will be gone before you know it.<br>  God Bless You!<br>  .<br>  .
e5k8Bsxpaa	Tell him to go to anger management or else you just cannot live with him anymore. Show him that you're serious. If he doesn't do it, leave. This is for you and your baby. If you can't or won't leave then don't threaten to though. Tell him that you'll look for someone together and that you could even go with him if he wants. Tell his friends to try to convince him to go if you think that may help (and not get him mad)    Once he's in the program, tell his friends that they must stop calling him that because he will be essentially changing his identity and personality and he needs to feel confident that he can do that.|`|d20mM90uaa	Are YOU seriously putting up with all that, sounds like you need more help than him for that  geez!!!|`|bO2rzfISaa	It was an excellent idea to get pregnant with this guy. You know you will have to fight in court to get supervised visitation, and you might not even win. What were you thinking?|`|tOdjjeAmaa	It doesn't matter WHAT he has or WHY he is doing this. You need to leave now. He's not right in the head and your child deserves better. It's your fault completely if you stay.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	Usually with children involved I think couples should try to work things out.    BUT, HE SOUNDS CRAZY.  For your safety and your child's safety you need to RUN.    If he gets angry and throws the baby, the child can die.  You must protect yourself and the child.    You said he butted you in the head.  My husband of 21 years has NEVER even touched me in anger - ever.  That is a horrible sign.  I want to repeat - he is not normal, he seems crazy - run!|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Your Answer:  I am sorry to say this, but he definitively HAS a problem...and you need to get one or two doctors' opinions on what he has!    Sounds to me like he could be manic-depressive, or bipolar.  He should take meds and he should also go to therapy or counseling. I mean it!    What he has done before clearly states he loses control...and someone who loses control can do all kinds of terrible and dangerous things, both to himself and to others around him.     Do not ignore all the red flags you have seen, honey. Your unborn child and you are in danger. Contact your family and inform them of this today. Do not wait! Please do not become another statistic.|`|5SR5Hyfeaa	He's Nuts !   I think he is very special too. His "core values" are what he does and the way he acts. So yes he's special, but only to him self.   He's going to hurt you or the baby, He goes and gets help or you call an attorney. Head But ? Dang lady get out of there.|`|rWCliJTuaa	Your just as bad as he is. Why did you get pregnant with someone like this. What were you thinking. Now you will either raise a kid in a violent house hold, by yourself or with a broken family.    You go on rambling how screwed up he is but your having a baby with him.|`|TPPJEHjsaa	You need to get away from this man until he gets some help. You are putting your unborn child in danger. There has to be SOMEONE you can stay with (aunt, parents, friends, coworkers, etc.) in the meantime. Tell him that until he has proof that he is seeing a therapist at least once a week you will not come back. If he would harm your cats and even you (the headbutting), what makes you think he wouldn't hurt your child in one of his fits of rage? He has serious psychological issues and he needs to learn how to work through them or I guarantee your child will end up with a broken body someday. I don't want to scare you, but he could even possibly kill your child.  Babies can be very frustrating and emotionally draining with their constant need for care and attention and their constant screaming. Someone of his fragile state of mind could end up shaking or hitting your baby.     Give him an ultimatum, and then FOLLOW THROUGH WITH IT. He is obviously not taking you seriously because he hasn't done any counseling even though he has promised in the past that he would. Move in with a relative or friend and tell him you are not coming back until he has proof that he has had at least 10 counseling sessions. And the moment the counseling ceases, you move back out again. Make him give you weekly proof, or even drive him to the sessions and wait in the waiting room.       Good luck.|`|tsBL19qzaa	And why are you still with him?|`|MuVKeK8faa	Sounds like he has more than anger issues.  He has mental issues..and probably needs therapy and medication.  Get out before he attacks you...it's only a matter of time.|`|HwTMMVd7aa	What is going on with him is a serious problem. You're right to fear for you and your baby. My advice? Go stay with a friend for a while, prove to him that if he doesn't change his ways, the marriage is over. I am a firm believer that marriage is a lifelong thing, but when your spouse is violent and there is a threat to your life and your baby's life, then you need to do what you can to save yourself. He needs a serious wake up call. He needs to realize that this behavior is NOT in any way okay, and that if he doesn't change, he is going to lose two very important things in his life: you, and his baby.|`|0e9846c69a3447404194ba8083d4f969aa	Leave now and keep him the hell away from you and your child. I completely agree with the second answer.     Maybe stay with family if you cannot live on your own. Find cheaper housing. Do something. Don't stay because of money.
WDs4fRoxaa	It is not okay to engage in this type of activity in someone<br>  else's home.<br>  <br>  This is a home that your sister created for her family.<br>  <br>  Her children should not be subject to hearing or walking<br>  in on any activity that their parents would have to explain.<br>  <br>  You are a guest in her home. Your mother pays for you<br>  to live there as a benefit to you.<br>  <br>  If you are adult enough to engage in such activity, it should<br>  be time to get your own place to live.<br>  <br>  The only children that should be in a home when adults engage<br>  in such activity should be the children of the people doing so.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|E7TkNO00aa	To begin with, that is pretty rude of you and your boyfriend disrespecting his mom's house and your sister's house. Even if your mom pays rent for you, doesn't give you the right to be having sex with your boyfriend. Why don't you live with your mom? For crying out loud, there are kids in that house that live their too. Don't be inconsiderate, when you guys feel like having sex, go to a motel and do your thang. Don't you feel a little remorse for doing that?|`|ADP9swbMaa	If she's ok with him sleeping over, I'd assume she's ok with you two having sex.

mrI8mfFpaa	WHY DO PEOPLE IN THE WEST GO TO PARTIES, FIVE STAR HOTELS, BUY FERRARIS EN PORSCHES SPEND MONEY ON LUXURY ETC WHEN MILLIONS DIE AROUND THE WORLD IN POVERTY?|`|l43NSgHyaa	India has a caste system.   Many times, the people who have the most luxurious weddings, are the people who come from a higher social class.  <br>  <br>  But, with that said, it's tradition in their country.  It's the way they choice to celebrate and it's something that's been a tradition for centuries.  So, telling them they're wasting money on something that very, very deeply rooted in their cultural identity is wrong.<br>  <br>  Yes, Indian weddings are very, very expensive.  But, they are also very beautiful.   I'm not Indian, but I'm guessing people spend a lot of money to preserve their cultural traditions.  You have to admit, Indian weddings are very much about their pride in marriage, their culture, religion and traditions.   I honor that!   More people need to uphold their traditional beliefs. <br>  <br>  But, like I said, I believe the more expensive weddings are held by people who have a higher class status.  So, more than likely, they can easily afford it.    But, above all, it's their tradition.  So, even if they go broke,  they're honoring their beliefs, which says a lot about their cultural values.  They value people, relationships and tradition over material things.|`|eF92uM2Saa	The lavish long wedding cements the couple together and the families together for that matter. It's an incorporation of tradition and religion which gets everyone in their family and social circles to buy into supporting the couple in maintaining their commitment to each other. After going through all of this ceremony, expense and time, people (not just the couple) have a lot invested in making the marriage a success.<br>  <br>  My thought is that by emphasizing the importance of the wedding, they are emphasizing the importance of the family unit. Strong family units are important to the survival of offspring.<br>  <br>  So, it's probably not such a bad way to spend their money.|`|aipChC3haa	It's just like the U.S. The bride just wants one chance to really have her day and do whatever it takes to make it FABOLOUS!<br>  <br>  It also is that they want to show off that "hey we can afford this".  It's also that they want to preserve cultural aspects of their culture.<br>  It's just they can pay for it so they want to make sure people can really see it.<br>  <br>  The other answers are REALLY good btw|`|zopegiT4aa	I know what you mean....same reason that people in the ghettos drive luxury cars, buy expensive handbags, and have gold jewerly..If I was them, I'd rather be OUT of the ghetto, in a nice neighborhood where I don't have to worry about getting shot, and not have all the expensive bling.|`|zYt0kPtzaa	So what does your question mean?<br>  You dont live very well?<br>  or are you going to spend the money on other people who are in poverty?<br>  <br>  Its your wedding, once in a lifetime experience just spend the money on yourself
Se2Ko2NKaa	dont worry about it.........listen to classic rock!|`|PBsF8HaVaa	Guys usually do nothing while you grind on them. Probably sway side to side. Only ghetto people will do more than that.

VII5wup3aa	Ok, well here's the deal. I've been in one for 2 years now, 742 miles away. We didn't meet in person til we had known each other 7 months. He's been here twice, I've been there once and currently planning to go again before he moves here in September. We're an amazing couple, out long distance relationship is amazing. We communicate and talk and tell each other everything and love each other with a love that will never die. But, to start off with....he didn't tell his parents about me til we'd known each other about 5 or 6 months, he told his friends but not his parents (where the same week I met him I took my computer in there and introduced him to my parents via web cam) We met in September of 07, he called me his girlfriend to a few friends, but never actually asked me to be his girlfriend. Well, I eventually straight up told him around January either you ask me to be your girlfriend or quit calling me your girlfriend and of course he did. He didn't tell his parents about me though til it was almost time for him to come down here the first time and they knew so little about me that they were worried I was a man :0. But ya, don't dream. Talk to him about it, tell him how you feel, lay down some rules....if you mean anything to him he'll fix whatever's bothering you, I can promise that. Don't be in a relationship where you don't know where it's going, especially a long distance one. Talk to him and figure out what's going on, get an explaination and get him on a roll :)    <3|`|dqCTS60raa	I kind of complicated because since he doenst want to introduce you to his family and he refers to you as his friend I don't think that guy is for you after all.|`|0Uo20SmWaa	Be careful of any one that you meet on line.

9RtdvLEKaa	I think you were very wrong.  You're not going to like this, but technically, if she wanted to, she could have you arrested for rape because she told you to stop (repeatedly, although she only needed to say it once) and you kept going, not to mention the fact that you're over 18 and she's not.  You betrayed her trust and she has every right to be pissed at you, and that's statutory.  If she doesn't want to talk to you, you should leave her alone and not push it because, if all you get is to never see her again you'll be lucky.  She did nothing wrong, but you took something from her that you had no right to take and I wouldn't blame her if she took herself out of your life forever.  It doesn't matter how it felt for you, if someone says stop when you're having sex, you STOP!!!  ...otherwise it's rape.  Good luck!|`|779f397084aa4666983d22c2e4d1a290aa	you were wrong. she clearly said stop, you shouldn't be raping your girlfriend. you're kind of a dick for not being considerate for her feelings at all.|`|CjOOkfX4aa	That was definitely your fault!!!!!!<br>  You have no idea how badly that must have hurt her.<br>  Basically you raped her. she was trying to move away from you. <br>  I feel so bad for her. <br>  Your a prick!!!  wow i wouldn't have called you back either|`|BbT3DCHvaa	Seriously? You think you could possibly be right here?  You did a terrible thing and need to make up for it in a big way.  You have to make sure she is comfortable with the situation.  You can't just force sex on someone.  Unbelievable...|`|e86df6aeda098a41020c4baf4c81dcddaa	you basically raped her.<br>  <br>  you were definately thinking with the wrong head..|`|ijR3ygAJaa	Jerkface.|`|ADP9swbMaa	"No" means no and "Stop" means stop.<br>  I feel sorry for her that her first time was with someone so inconsiderate.|`|CX0y66Puaa	OMG that could be classed as rape! When a girl says stop, you should stop How selfish of you. If your so experienced you wouldve known to stop. Thats just wrong i don't know how you think shey'd want to talk to you after that..I know i wouldnt<br>  :P|`|0vW88Uw9aa	Um your her boyfriend and if you do something like that a lot changes. Thats sort of like raping her? Sex is a big stage and if she didn't want to do it then you shouldn't have forced it upon her.|`|1gS6osqoaa	um yeah...you were definatly wrong. when she says stop you should have pulled back immediatly and let her go at her own pace. i doubt you'll be gettin any more form her.|`|OB8KPPIQaa	whats wrong with you? you hurt her!! if you really cared for this girl why would you hurt her? she has a right to be mad!!|`|bs1QqRN8aa	maybe it isnt always about you|`|pVaZty4Maa	when a girl says "stop" then thats exactly what you do.....|`|amAcoXz4aa	well hello<br>  <br>  if she asked u to stop then y didnt u<br>  <br>  she wasnt ready!!!|`|GiaVm26baa	First off, you raped this girl. She said stop, twice. You didn't. You took advantage of her, it was her first time, she didn't know what to expect. You mean to tell me after a year of dating, you didn't care enough about this person to stop when you were hurting her? What kind of selfish asshole are you? I hope she presses charges. Maybe you will think twice before you 'don't hear' what a woman has to say.|`|IpjqvuOMaa	Your an ***, you heard her and carried on!  That is disgusting!  Her first sexual experience was like that.  Way to make it special and enjoyable for her!  I hope you're proud that you only thought of yourself.  You are completely wrong in this situation, as she asked you to stop and you kept going...that is practically rape.|`|bS6sGSueaa	********.<br>  <br>  What Do you Thinks Wrong?<br>  Oh, Apart From The Fact You Carried On When She Told You To Stop.. Then Fell Asleep On Top Of Her?<br>  <br>  Congrats For Ruining One Of The Most Important Experiences For A Girl.<br>  <br>  Oh and you enjoyed yourself?<br>  She'll have went through agony.|`|jIsAIwCgaa	Omg that same thing happened with me and my ex the first time we did it... the only dif...HE STOPPED! Your an ***. She was in real pain and you didn't care because you were enjoying it. How selfish of you. you should be ashamed.|`|YvvcsdUUaa	dude thats practically rape. are you stupid? if she says stop. STOP IT. wth. especially if shes your girlfriend. your sick bro. obviously who do you honestly think is wrong? she was in pain man. ugh this is why i despise young girls losing their virginity to ducks like you. -_-|`|Eq6cjEwAaa	i reckon, she was just shy that you guys made out. it's just normal for a girl, virgin girl to feel mad and get hurt at first but it will just vanish. don't worry. just confront her.|`|St2Ljwe0aa	okkkk....mann yu kinda of raped her in a way;she told yu to stop and yu kept going<br>  Your going to having big problem;<br>  Your wrong soo wrong|`|HSXspcPTaa	she was in pain and you didnt stop...your fault
8s4pA8ASaa	Yes, it was rape. If your partner asks you to stop and you don't, that's rape. It's probably not what you want to hear, but that's the reality. Women and men are socialized very differently, and men are told to be aggressive in sex--for example, men are told they should be the ones to pursue sex, they should be the ones to "convince" their partners to do it. Women are socialized to believe that they're are supposed to remain chaste (not have many sexual partners), and that they should resist sexual advances and not take control of their own sexuality. It's extremely complicated and impossible to explain effectively in a short amount of space, but we're all subject to this socialization. However, that's not an excuse for your actions. Your girlfriend is very confused right now because you hurt her, even though that wasn't your intention. She's trying to understand how she feels about you and how she feels about what happened. She may not want to speak with you again. Whatever happens, it would be smart for you to get a book about date rape so you can understand your actions and hers. Good luck.|`|TofmqjUaaa	THAT IS SOOO RAPE!!!<br>  <br>  Rape is defined as: UNWANTED CONTACT...<br>  <br>  soo yea.. why'd you scar that girl for life?|`|ClK9W8THaa	Alot of guys think that being with a virgin is a great thing. I suppose it is in their minds.  But it can be traumatizing to the young lady.  And that needs to be taking in consideration at all times.  If someone  saids  " no" or stop" you ought to respect that.  Because if you don't then it can be looked at as a forceful situation.  I think it's wonderful that you enjoyed yourself... but you failed to hear .. that she didn't.  Stop praising yourself about that fact that you were with a virgin, because it may have cost you much more  than you thought.<br>   You may want to apologize to her for not considering her feelings and being a jerk about having a good time... Give her some time alone to calm down , she needs that right now.  And  work on being just a little more sensitive to her needs. Remember it wasn't just you who went through this experience, it was the both of you. I wish you the best right now.|`|ADP9swbMaa	Yes. <br>  It would be darn near impossible to prove in court, but you did rape her. When she said "Stop" you should have stopped. She struggled, and you held her down. She didn't want it, and you did it anyway. That's called rape. <br>  Like I said in your earlier question, I feel sorry for her.|`|KO4kkypnaa	That was horrible! You are definitely wrong! Thats rape!|`|yt2zVOZfaa	Wow. Yes, I'd say you raped her. She said stop, you didn't and forced her to have sex.|`|MhzlGHkyaa	Yes you raped her. What's YOUR problem?<br>  <br>  Selfish @$$ hole.|`|yd9ECJJfaa	that was wrong of you. first off she was a virgin so you should've respected her and stopped when she said to. yea that is rape. you had sex with someone who asked you to stop. you are defiantly wrong in this situation. i would be mad too|`|CLjTgZfIaa	WELL KINDA YEAH! i mean really shes tellinh you to stop and you ignore her,dude! shes hurting and while ur happy she not i would call it not really rape but close to it.U SHUD FEEL BAD!|`|k9IFYBDQaa	you treated her very poorly and she has good reason to be angry with you.|`|FfjyYHByaa	You should be ashamed of yourself. You should have listened to her. I wouldn't be surprised if she never spoke to you again or if she pressed charges against you. She's underage... if she really wanted to she could do some serious damage to your record. ALWAYS listen to what your partner says. Now she's no longer a virgin and her first time with you was a horrible one. You obviously aren't ready to have sex.. you aren't mature or responsible enough. I guess you didn't even think to make sure that she orgasmed? Guys like you are such scum bags. All you care about is yourself. Grow up.
AA10604300	No.<br>  do not drag up this issue, <br>  as the living person is already traumatised, and needs no more self righteous acts of regret<br>  pushed on by you.<br>  <br>  If you could do one thing, do this, remember Jesus the Lord ?<br>  why not ask him to forgive you of your sins first, and then teach your freind that there is a way to put away the guilt of what happened,<br>  <br>  Ask Jesus the Lord this, <br>  Dear Jesus, please forgive me of my sins, I know that you rose from the dead, and that you want me to be with you in heaven,<br>  I want to be with you in heaven.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  then if you have tasted that the Lord Jesus is sincere, then, and only then will you be able to show this guy how to overcome that tragedy.|`|FHhQl5soaa	From one who has fought clinical suicidal tendencies all my life (first attempt at age 6)...<br>  <br>  Any mention of suicide is either a manipulation of the person being told, or a roundabout request for assistance.  From my perspective, suicide equals peace and freedom.  A release from an endlessly painful life.  Those of us who "feel" their way through life become overwhelmed.  Even thinking of suicide is comforting.  To know that I don't HAVE to continue to feel this way forever.  That I can always choose not to.  It's actually liberating.  <br>  <br>  However, to speak of it to someone else is drawing them into your drama.  If someone is truly suicidal out of helplessness, they might attempt to get help.  They may be unable or unwilling to get professional help themselves.  Telling another gives them a way of doing it without guilt of weakness.  I know it sounds strange.  <br>  <br>  If someone comes to you with thoughts of suicide, and is NOT attempting to manipulate you (If you leave me, I'll kill myself...), make no mistake...  CALL someone!!!  If the attempt is eminent (Use your best judgment, do they have a plan, a note, and/or the means, (a gun)) CALL 911 and remain with them.  If they make it through, you may lose a friend, for the blame will then be on you.  But, better to lose them this way than the alternative.  If the attempt is not eminent, or is a response to massive external forces, guide them to assistance.  Financial, therapeutic, social...  They may balk at first but they will understand that once the immediate stress is over, the feelings will subside.<br>  <br>  Unless you are a psychiatrist, you are NOT equipped to counsel them effectively...  DO NOT TRY.  Get them trained help.  Even those who use suicide threats to manipulate are in need of help.  This is not a completely sane thing to do.  If nothing else they will learn after a 3 day mandatory psych hold to NEVER place another person in this kind of position again.  <br>  <br>  I'm not a pro, I've just been there.  As much as I disliked feeling betrayed by ones that have helped me, I AM still here and still fighting.
fP46meSmaa	He could be just looking at a fixed object that's in your line of fire.**
3hBQz33Yaa	your right it sounds like he's not wanting a relationship..hes just wanting fun. the fact that he pressures you as much as he does and gets mad if you don't do what he wants shows hes controlling, selfish, and not relationship material in the least. if he was he wouldn't pressure you and he wouldn't only be worrying about having cam fun. if your looking for a relationship this is not your guy...you need to break it off with him or tell him your only going to be friends and no more sex stuff on the cam and if he doesn't like it to bad so sad for him...tell him he missed out on something great and goodbye.|`|X8Fd2dm6aa	Forget him! You shouldn't have to do things you are not comfortable with just so that a guy will like you. If he really cared about you he would respect you and not ask you to do things like that. This guy is purely around for his own satisfaction, not a relationship.
0vW88Uw9aa	Its not bad at all! A lot of girls are doing stuff at a young age nowadays but really don't think that and yeah a kiss is lips touching and making out is like kissing a lot sometimes with tongues and don't be nervous because if you just go with the flow, it'll work out!|`|pVaZty4Maa	trust me sweetie it will all come to you naturally when the time comes okay :)

US88C092aa	You shouldn't have gotten into another relationship if you weren't over your ex because now you involved a new guy that could possibly get hurt if you choose to get back with your ex.

Goodluck!|`|9220e99cf581203dda5db0c56616ac40aa	imagine the person in your life that you hate the most.  like he's a bum or a whiner or just gives you a horrible vibe.  now try to think of things he has in common with your ex.  now start believing that your ex is as creepy as that guy.  soon you won't want to talk to him.<br>  <br>  you have to believe for it to work.  it's self-hypnosis, and it requires absolute faith in it.|`|ou3wQcuYaa	I think you should wait to go out with another guy.

You need to ask yourself.. which relationship is better for you? the one you left or the one you are in now? think about whether your ex deserves to be your bf again or not and if you think he does and you really do like him  you need to either talk to your ex about it or tell your new guy . I know telling the new guy is hard but if its a serious relationship its important that you tell him how you feel because that will make him trust you more, If he found out from someone else then he wouldn't be too happy Just do what you think is best for you and follow your heart. Hope i helped good luck.|`|bZzThzDbaa	i was kinda in this situation when i liked my ex gf while trying to be in  another relationship.. my suggestion is to not date untill you know you hare completly over your ex.. otherwise you are going to end up hurting the new person.. thats what happened with me and i felt horrible.. we ended up dating later on so i just needed that time to get over it.. and sounds like if u just give it some time, it will eventualy work out.. remember, you guys broke up for a reason otherwise you would still be together .. good luck|`|uUacOBgmaa	Nobody wants to drink spilt milk, and nobody wants to clean it.<br>  <br>  ...Sounds like you need to (sorry to say) but get over him!

y7MsBXdmaa	Its possible you just became "too good"<br>  I know that sounds so stupid but sometimes arguments are good & normal & spice up the relationship.<br>  She is definitely one of those girls who ruins good guys & turns them into players.<br>  She wasn't worth it. There is A woman out there who WILL appreciate you.
y1xPK3Txaa	1.To like a guy who is older then you?

(when you liked them first)<br>  Not unless your friend was aware of your pre-existing crush.<br>  <br>  8.To like someone your friends hate?<br>  No.|`|hUynmdRSaa	1. Not so much when your 13. Better wait until high school for that much older.<br>  2. That's perfectly fine. Do what makes you happy.<br>  3. Yeah but get to know them more before you really start to like them.<br>  4. No that's not right at all.<br>  5. If the other person is who you think will make you happy then go for it.<br>  6. There is nothing wrong with keeping your options open.<br>  7. As long as it doesn't turn into a blood bath.<br>  8. Depends on what they hate him for. If it is something reasonable(he hits girls, heavy drug user, etc) then maybe you should listen to them.|`|iCnQBqbFaa	1. Not wrong.<br>  2. Not wrong.<br>  3. Not wrong, its kinda exciting and makes you want to get to know them better.<br>  4. Yes. Super wrong. How would you feel about someone spreading rumors about you, and they don't know you? Yeah, uber bad.<br>  5. It depends on the situation. Personally I think that its better to break up with someone then lead them on or cheat on them.<br>  6. Not wrong.<br>  7. Not wrong, unless your friend starts dating them. If that happens, then he's totally off limits. <br>  8. Not wrong, you like him because he's different from the people that you are always spending time with.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|kELDXjkgaa	1. No<br>  2. No<br>  3. No<br>  4. Probably will come back to haunt you<br>  5. Break up, no.<br>  6. No<br>  7. No, just don;t act on it<br>  8. No|`|TPud8FMFaa	The correct title should have read, "There are more than 1?"<br>  <br>  You're welcome!|`|MFTY5v1Laa	1>no<br>  2>no<br>  3<no<br>  4>yes<br>  5>depends<br>  6>no just don't play them<br>  7>kinda but then no<br>  8>no|`|DZeswuTwaa	I think, considering your age, everyone of them is okay under specific circumstances except for number 4.  Spreading rumors about someone, whether they’re about someone you know or don’t know is divisive, malicious and just plain mean.  Staying away from evil gossip will keep you out of trouble and away from immature drama…unless that is what you’re looking for.
m2eHPeciaa	lol, u should tell him how u feel i guess. theres nothing wrong with that. im sure he'll be pleased to know.|`|1611a17a4b0cd6610c45b73de16234bcaa	haha...tell him that....see how he reacts...lol....i would kiss him if i were you....since he tried to be more than friends...<br>  <br>  i said you better go on with him...ask him...pop the question...ask him he rather have u as a girlfriend or friend...|`|1gS6osqoaa	kiss him.|`|s5dspNk5aa	take your shirt off.|`|Ix2eWrswaa	you should ask if he likes you first
W2GcDwyOaa	I think you should wait it out a little while longer just to be sure. Sounds like he does infact like you though|`|YHcyuka3aa	I never do give girls the 'go ahead' signal about asking a guy out. I really think it is the guys place to do the asking. It always made me think that a girl is being a little too pushy or brave or desperate. In my opinion I think you need to wait and let the guy be the gentleman.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	Its him that has to ask you out. He has to try but if hes too shy it seems that it is up to you.|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	in your question have other people told you he likes you? because if they have then he probably does (it means he either told them, or it's that obvious). my advice to you is if you're too nervous to actually ask him out, then just show him you're interested. talk to him whenever you can, or you can like be REALLY obvious and see how he responds. he's probably unsure and nervous to ask you in case he's rejected. good luck!|`|UkPkIaxjaa	just ask him out you got nothing to lose, whats the worst thing that can happen "lets just be friends"|`|Ix2eWrswaa	ask him if he likes you|`|VXIYgrHfaa	Calm down chances are he likes. Before asking eachother out maybe you could go to each others house get a feel of what the person goes threw in a day you could learn even more about the person. If you already know allot and you really want to ask him out its best to do it in private were no one will disturb you like going for a short walk outside the school with him. When you ask him out do the old fashioned way and ask if he wants to go to the movies or for something to eat( it dosnt have to be a fancy restruant always). Really act like yourself and you should be fine. :D|`|eERXx2lYaa	i think u should keep talking to him ask him some questions . and if its in a email or myspace it would b better so anyone listen 2 u guys
W2GcDwyOaa	What's wrong with being a virgin at 20? I'm a virgin at 21 years of age...|`|vwL7twjPaa	uhh fug the **** outta him?|`|M0WypELtaa	Hey buddy, i feel for ya...But the best news is this can all change, and fast<br>  <br>  First of all...sitting back and feeling sorry for yourself is only gonna make the situation worst. Wheres that gonna take you...absolutely nowhere. The past is gone, you haven't had a girl. that aint going to change. But where your heading...thats another story.<br>  <br>  So you want to resolve this. First of all realise that what your doing now isn't working. You keep going the way you are with girls, your going to be in the same situation. It's time for a motherf*cking change :)<br>  <br>  now i don't know what your situation is (eg your getting knocked back, you dont leave your house, you have a 3rd eye, ect)<br>  <br>  But i'm gonna use the example that your normal, average looking guy who does go out and is half social, but nothing seems to work.<br>  <br>  heres a few quick tips<br>  <br>  Get yourself out there<br>  Theres people who complain they never get girls, never have money, aren't happy with their lives...blah blah...and you know what...they do nothing about it. You want to get girls. Put yourself out there, theyre everywhere, my specialty is bars/clubs. So i make sure i go to the bars/clubs regularly so I have the possibility of meeting girls<br>  <br>  Learn to pick up<br>  Theres stacks of material out there (a lot of it sh*t so be careful). If you do a search on pua (pick up artist) you will find theres communitys, books, products even bootcamps teaching guys to be successful with women. A recommended book is The Game by Neil Strauss. It is the best introduction to the pick up and seduction scene and will give you the tools to begin your transformation. (you read this from front to back, you'll be halfway there) If your going to search topics, I recommend looking up inner game. Its about your beliefs and really bringing out the better you, topics like being an alpha male. After that, start learning the routines, body language, emotional spikes, esculations and other things that will make you the man that girls want to be with<br>  <br>  Don't Give Up, Follow through with this (your life will only better) and Enjoy the ride...Good Luck Friend :)<br>  <br>  theseductionstore<br>  <a href="http://www.theseductionstore.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.theseductionstore.com</a>
Qjir5MLMaa	this is the time when you take a break, and maybe see other people to reazlie just how much he really means to you.<br>  thats really the only way.|`|InzHK1rcaa	Maybe ask him if you two can take a break? It's a risky thing to do, but after a few months you guys might realize how much you miss eachother and get back together. If not, you'll find a new guy and it'll be better :] don't worry.
kWcIsrSAaa	When I had to ask someone to a Sadie Hawkins dance, the guy I liked had broken his arm and asked me if I wanted to sign his cast. I wrote "Will you go to the dance with me?" in bright red Sharpie. :)
xnZqoTOjaa	i would be.<br>   im 14<br>  130 lbs. (omg, i know im fat)<br>  reddish brownish hair (im dying it on saturday though)<br>  and im kinda tall.|`|ijR3ygAJaa	From that description... sadly, probably not D: But a picture is worth one thousand words! And you've got the tall thing going for ya, which girls love! Personally, I am not a fan of long hair on guys, so that might be something to look into...|`|Qxexz4mEaa	A picture would help. But if I had to use my imagination...no! sry.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	Nope too young. I don't mind the other qualities though. If you were 19 I would consider it.|`|yudfOAQQaa	Sure I would be interrested but I'm a bit older than you. Still, I would be interrested. =)
HeOVyxDtaa	have you tried to talk to him? like telling alll of this to him? i think it is important to save your relationship especially in your pregnant state and communication really is the key. talk everything outt, be completely honest with each other and see what the deal is. try not to fight or be stubborn though, just work it out|`|QTjnxatraa	Maybe you could go and see someone and talk it all out.  Communciation is so important and that clearly isn't happening at the moment and you guys really really need to talk.<br>  <br>  The baby could be adding more stress, maybe he is really stressed out and it's coming out as anger in your arguements.  Don't give up yet, go and see someone so you can both talk it out.
LgOOYyXIaa	well..the fact that you guys work together may cause problems..and depending on what kind of guy he is he may/may not lose interest, just try to keep distant and lay low for a while, and see if he talks to you..if he doesn't then theres your answer :)  god bless|`|59429d3d1859d61851cb1c978737cff3aa	if the feeling was there, you did the right thing.  if he really likes you, he won't lose interest, so you'll find out once and for all.|`|690MZg0Xaa	Sorry hun thats the worst thing u could have done, i dated a co worker last year we didnt have sex for 2 months coz i didnt want to be called a slag .. and as soon as we had sex HE DUMPED me.. All he wanted was to say i sl eep with her...|`|Hh92sQQbaa	Maybe not all guys are the same.Maybe he is really interest in you.So good luck.|`|HiNswxALaa	No and yes. It depends on what type of guy he is. Me and my boyfriend I've been with had sex before we even went out and I thought that would be it. Now we have been dating for over six monthes. It depends on how much you too like each other I guess. Try talking to him about things and see were it goes.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Yes. He has conquered you and can now spread it around the office that you are easy and he is macho man.|`|uBssj3Znaa	yes, he already got what he wanted.|`|rEBdSRrHaa	sorry,  but tbh,   he mightve been only after that one thing,  you'll need to wait and see  good luck!
wYga8wIOaa	I was in the exact same position,     I recently turned down an opportunity to work in America because i didn't want to leave my boyfriend and we split up three week later. I regret it so much since he was the only reason I stayed.    Never let someone else influence your decision, it sounds like you're not very happy where you are now and if you stay you'll end up resenting your boyfriend for holding you back.     Try moving away, if it doesn't work out then you can always go home.    Hope this helps,|`|PQVji656aa	Probably...........  Maybe get a new boyfriend.  Or just leave|`|GVlzdZKsaa	Get a new boyfriend.
9pYEHVHPaa	You will know by his actions. If he isn't saying it to your face, I say that he is just saying 'I love you' to you like he would to a friend. You will know when he says it and means it in a serious relationship type way. He will look you in the eye and tell you and you will feel that he means without question.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	If he is under twenty-five, and his lips are moving, he is not tellling the truth.    This is a biological fact.  At his age, "love" = sex!    Period.    Now, learn from this and trust no boy, and very few men.|`|hazucBxbaa	its all about trust!|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	If he says it with a stright face while looking right at you|`|c159efe1b44ee4b1b369d779c1d19521aa	You can only tell by his actions. He can say I love you all day, but if he isn't showing you it doesn't matter.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	To find out if he using you,tell him you are not having sex until marriage. If he seems distant or tries to break up with you,he is using you. If he respects that,he loves you.    p.s. you don't have to mean the whole no sex before marriage thing.|`|USn04b4Paa	your mind can play tricky things with you .|`|sr0vZPQqaa	You can't.|`|DCe7GVJAaa	he is ptobably not lyimg just shy to say it right next to u.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	he don't.|`|6846a3395d16d18b95b001a1bda626a1aa	Pardon the expression, but if he won't put his body where his mouth is, then I am not sure the sentiment is the whole truth.|`|8IJEMFFlaa	well hey,, i think he is nervous to say it in front of you... maybe it's his first time saying this... if he didn't than he won't be saying it on the phone... but whenever you two meet each other, does he look into your eyes?,, next time look,,,,,,,, and oh yaa who is the one that says i love you first ,, you or him?|`|aMHIA7XMaa	Do his actions back up his words? Maybe he is just shy about saying it and nervous about what you say back to him. Doing it over the phone is more passive and not as direct nor as scary. If you feel the same, try telling him when he's next to you and see if he will say back.|`|RncUc0traa	you cant ......you just have to wait for his actions as u kno know action speaks louder than words, because when you love some one you cant help treating them like your queen...|`|aZsyxJ5Gaa	hmmm this is weird!!  maybe he's shy or even better,maybe he doesnt love ya..|`|5MkwIq6Jaa	well, that's a big sign. he probably doesn't realize it...just bring it up next time you are together.|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	You have to know that person.  It just depends on what type of relationship you two are going into.  It is also different degrees of love.  So be careful he might just mean that he loves you as a friend.  Don't get caught out there with your feelings in the wind.  Until he is more specific don't get carried away with what he is saying.|`|j6YWA3Qnaa	I am a guy and have honestly never told someone i loved them besides my best friend and my family, i guess if your with him feel around in his pants. haha nah j.k. but most guys just want to get in the girls pants, sad days today eh?|`|gG4IUGLlaa	Tell him to prove it. Action speaks louder than words! Ask him how does he knows that he's in love with you. Don't fall in love or have sex with him until you know for sure.
PoBIyZ27aa	When I was trying on veils with my gown, I went with an elbow length style. I think it depends a lot on your height. For instance, I'm 5'1" so the cathedral length veil really dragged me down. I don't think the mantilla veil would be problematic at all. It would look very pretty with a gown that has a chapel length train. Good luck and congrats!|`|ofCRTXw9aa	I like the mid-sized veils.  They end just over your butt.|`|4SjwTCASaa	Your veil isn't supposed to be any longer than your train, but if you want it longer do that.  With the mantilla veils, I like the ones that fall just below the butt.|`|h6AH6Biyaa	I picture a mantilla veil as falling somewhere between hip and knee length.
y1Fihj3Maa	It is not the size of the prick that does the trick, it is the throb of the knob that does the job.
S7iQ9FkGaa	Let your decision take its course. Things will get better.     Take care.|`|KTB5jwpQaa	it sounds like uve done enough now to let him know how u feel so take a step back, be strong and just hope he starts to remember the good times u had and give him time n space to miss you.
XxFHAT2aaa	What do you mean by every way? I dont think that there is some kind of religion cause Ive studied a lot of them. I think that hes just a mommas boy|`|GmTMVmASaa	say what? you can not love your mother in every way, whether or not dad is dead or alive. you can be there for her and  be supportive, but if there is such a religion, i'm thinking it's on another planet.|`|1k6UUC8qaa	its called incest. I even researched but sorry can't find a one good luck with that please stay away from your mother if that's the case and its you if not advise the same to whoever it is you are talking about|`|VnRECJJxaa	that's disgusting|`|h1wQDMT1aa	NO, you are just admiring her because the love of a parents you've been encounter right is just focus with her.|`|vrFH5AKraa	haha your sick dude and if your question means what i think it means then you need some serious help FAST you can't use religion as a answer 2 mess with ya mom  love her yes in a mom son natural way an help her out where your dad did but 2 ask what your askin DUDE THATS F***ED UP
svzGz9STaa	What does the hospital say the problem is?     Like the other poster said, go to a regular doctor if you don't like what's been happening at the hospital.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Go to the doc and check for ulcers and depending on his age but my bf had a colon test done and found some pal-lops|`|sN4wTWJ4aa	well im no expert but has he been checked for ulsers? high blood pressure and ulsers can be caused by stress and if eating bothers his stomach well not eating the right foods with diabeties puts blood sugar way out of wack.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	No.  If you feel like you aren't getting the proper care - go to another doctor, go to another hospital - do whatever it takes to get someone to listen to you and fix the problem.
1uRUaSblaa	Maybe learn her language to communicate with   her (if it is English) and to know her better.|`|23221fc5800c194352dec2cc606aa4e0aa	Try bucking up english to help....    Don't even know what are you talking about...
IuJjYz6gaa	You're not conceited, yet you call yourself a gorgeous model type.     It sounds like he could be attracted to her.  Maybe she's not conceited?  Maybe he loves her intelligence level.  Maybe he just likes short women...|`|VMY7No0eaa	he's attracted to her...   you need to stop her coming over.  meet elsewhere!|`|u1uECuFNaa	Don't bring her over anymore. (won't make things better for you.)  He is attracted to her. Perhaps it is a bit hard to hide it. (acting awkward.)  Sounds like she is a bit attracted to him also.   No, you are not conceited, but as a paralegal, I expect you can spell better.|`|rno6XarMaa	It sounds like your husband is attracted to your friend, and it sounds mutual.    Thankfully, your husband is not as shallow as you, and might look deeper into a person than their height and 'model gorgeous' looks.  Listen when the two of them talk - do they have more depth than you two do?|`|M4X3HOV5aa	He probably is attracted to her but it doesn't mean he would sleep with her. Either way, I'd suggest not bringing her over too much or leaving them alone together.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Ok,    You tell your man to "shut up"? You think that it's funny? Even if you say it in a funny way, it's still very insulting!    Do you make fun of him, point out is quirks, roast him a bit in front of friends? Complain about his habits? Deride his ambitions?    The reason you have a great sex life and a "okay" marriage....is you're not being a very good wife!    Now this girl may be plainer than you are....but she's nicer. She's supportive. She is encouraging. And she's genuinely interested in what your husband has to say.    How can you expect your husband not to be uncomfortably attracted to her? You haven't given him any reason to find you attractive (pretty, yes....but not attractive).    And this will continue to happen until he finally gets sick of it and leaves.     Remember....in 40 years....both you and this girl will have stretch marks, crows feet, saggy boobs and bigger bottoms.    But she'll treat him nicely.    Can you say the same today?    Guard your marriage. Be nicer to your man. And be very worried that other women could be nicer, sweeter, more supportive, more encouraging, and more kinder wives....than you are.     When you meet one....step up your game and make your husband love you like you are the only woman in the world.    Good Luck!|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	I think it's just the normal awkwardness of building a new friendship. Try not to over analyze but at the same time do not be blind to what could happen right in front of your nose. It's probably nothing though.|`|svzGz9STaa	Could be he's attracted to her but is making an effort not to act on it, which is making him act weird.|`|rWCliJTuaa	He probably thinks she is hot and is nervous around her. Probably wants to do her. As long as he doesn't who cares. Leave it alone|`|afc450c272a8e7cbe986f3278a12edf0aa	sounds like he likes her stop inviting her over for dinner.|`|701bbe1c569791c58e8a627b54425b08aa	He is attracted to her and he is trying not to show it.  He is real uncomfortable.|`|5cjKxcSFaa	Most likely SHE likes HIM...but in regards to his behavior I'd say it's typical for a man who isin't usually a social butterfly to interact awkwardly in the presence of another attractive woman.  He's probably just trying to show you that he CAN have female friends that he doesn't have sex with.  I can't.  At least not for long, but I'm not married, and I'm working on that aspect of "friendships".|`|hz0I0zFWaa	To him your friend is HOT!!!!!!!!!!|`|omfSAeBjaa	WHY?  because he thinks she's hot.  these are really simple questions.|`|DIx2ZD4Faa	hes just a flirt.|`|5ViTUTyZaa	Sounds like they like eachother.    You know, not everyone likes 'model' types.  Most men think they are gross.  Who wants to feel bones when banging?  That's just gross.      I suppose now you will say how big your boobs are and that you mean sports model type, right?    You brought looks into this so don't get mad....most men will choose the short cute chick over the tall model type.|`|AA11293318	I think he is attractive to her, but feels uncomfortable b/c he is married or you are there.|`|byBY2vpGaa	All the signs are there...that you are being an insecure, petty B****?    "Gorgeous model type" - possibly, but there is more to it than looks.|`|u3FBa2zuaa	Here's the thing, no matter how happy a man is in a relationship once that novelty feeling of sex and newness wears off he will start to test his boundaries with other girls. And other girls will most always oblige as it is fun for them to see if they can possibly ruin your relationship.   I'm so fed up and sick of men right now that I probably shouldn't be posting this but let me tell you there is no keeping him on a leash, there is no keeping her away.   I'm pregnant now which makes me terrified because my husband of late has been a total crazy basket case and he is getting texts late at night. All he does is try to get attention because he is jealous of me getting attention. I totally married the wrong guy and I completely regret  it.  The best thing you can do as hard as it is would be just to get on with your life and flirt as much as you want. Why should you not flirt with his friends? It's so stupid and humans probably aren't meant to be monogamous anyway so just do to him what he does to you. It may be immature but screw him.|`|zxGaToBBaa	hesw just trying to protect your Job with your Boss
Fq27TY6Waa	I will tell you what to do, u make her happy. If she wants your cock, you give it to her. Make sure she will remember it. Give her what she wants and make sure she likes it. Its all u dawg|`|YYvPR9pFaa	I think you should finally skip the barrier, keeping the little boys from the man, and have sex with her. Of course, you should always remember to have safe sex, no matter what the girl tells you (it's okay,I took pills, etc..). You never know if she has some disease. Or maybe you..     And if u want a tip, then care about hygiene. A guy who stinks in the bed, or is dirty is worse, than a guy, that doesnt have a penis. Oh and try to make her happy, dont care only about yourself.|`|YPvnC8yYaa	1-either you still sleeping.  2- or your  gay|`|aZsyxJ5Gaa	lets do the math here........  guy+ girl begging for sex=girl screaming n moaning and guy HAPPY     but    guy+girl begging for sex= guy online asking whether he should give it to her or not!!!!!!!      dude ur so lying...|`|YSoBO3tpaa	lol...you wish... try maxporn.com it'll be good for you right now..|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Having another fantasy, and playing games with the forum are we?|`|bYjercAqaa	give her my contact info|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	If you have to ask, then leave the room and send your dad in.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	this is about the dumbest question I've ever seen on here.

9pYEHVHPaa	Tell her to her face while looking her in the eyes if you really mean it. Don't tell her while you two are in bed this just means that you love having sex with her. And also how long have you been seeing her? I wouldn't want to say it to my guy or hear it from my guy unless we had been exclusive for at least 3 months. At this point you both know how you truly feel about each other, you will know if it is just puppy love or true love.|`|Pi6O8xmMaa	TAKE IT SLOW!THEN WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT YOU'LL KNOW WHEN TO KISS HER AND SAY YOU WANT TO GO OUT IF SHE SAYS NO YOU WILL RECOVER  PLEASE GO TO MY ?

Do you even talk to her? If your dating, just out and tell her, she'll either be estatic, or be mad, but you'll know where she stands. Most likely she'll love you too. If your just friends, ask her out, and then slowly move toward what I said...if you don't even talk, I would say start with getting to know her and move from there...cause that could be akward. Good luck!|`|hxhZez7caa	i think that is so cute..just tell her how u feel u never know maybe she'll go for it maybe she wont..i bet you she will(:|`|6jM9aAAvaa	just take her somewhere private and tell her!!!
8XKmMBU7aa	You told that you have only 2 children but didn't told that how many do you have required before small wedding on a budget.  Without knowing, how we can say you, So  I don't find any Joke on this beautiful question.  You may find Joke from www.google.com  If Answer of same question in Joke, it should be really Crazy.    Have a nice day and nice dream.|`|AA12268495	Here in the US parks & public beaches are wonderful options. Also, many campgrounds offer different types of shelter/picnic areas. Historical sites are another option that are beautiful and inexpensive. A Bed & Breakfast may offer a deal on an outside area ~ and give you a discount on rooms as well if you get an entire package. Do you have any friends with a nice backyard, garden, etc.? If you are looking for an indoor reception you could try churches ~ they usually have inexpensive rooms for rent for large gatherings. Restaurants can be pricey if you have a group of more than 10 people they may add extra service fees. However, many restaraunts have private banquet rooms.     Hope some of these ideas help :)|`|1hciyvKdaa	With all the snow right now I guess suggesting a park is not an option is it!  A park, your own home, or relatives home. A community center room. Here in the US golf clubs have renatable rooms, and so do rotary clubs for men. Any club you can find, that has a facility might have a room they rent out for this exact thing! Congradulations!!|`|69GgJhnWaa	Church, a family member's house, a park, a beach...|`|a1esFJ53aa	If it's a small wedding, maybe booking a table (or area if you want a bit of privacy) at a great resturant would be a good idea! Find out what kind of food everyone likes and find a place! Make sure you have a look around the place first, see where your guests will be sitting and find out what the resturant can offer you!     Congratulations and good luck :)|`|AgC30lhbaa	Pubs, golf clubs and church halls are normally most suitable as cheap reception venues if that is what you want.

Ask family each to cook a dish and bring tables/chairs making a couple of overseers so they can total up on who's cooking what. Tell them they can do this instead of buying gifts. Cheap as chips!|`|dsxDysQZaa	justice of the peace.|`|rp46MQKeaa	Congratulations   My wife and I lived together for years before getting married and had established our own home.  We had a small mid week church wedding no frills only vicar and the organist (now days you can marry at any licensed venue)  and we and the guests went to a local carvery restaurant for a meal (took over a large section of the restaurant for 3 hours) each guest paid for their own meal and we had no presents  who needs 3 toasters  the day went well and no debt   And good luck to you|`|jrVlzffeaa	If you were on a really tight budget, go to a nice restaurant/nice pub for food afterwards and get everyone to buy their own meals and drinks and tell them not to buy you gifts, that having them there is enough, that way you wont have to high venue, buy food and drinks, plus people wont have to think of what to get you.

Its what's wise and better for you.  I knos through my life its hard.
ahjOfnIIaa	If he is upset about it, then he was obviously let down when she didn't show up, so I would say, maybe not expecting her to come, but "hoping".........that can be a big letdown and in turn make one act as if they are mad or sad.....|`|pHmrBRlGaa	It could mean that he thought they had some kind of unspoken agreement. I have a similar thing with a girl in one of my class. She was not at the spot we usually talk and I was a bit surprised. I did not get mad though as she is an independent woman and not my property.<br>  <br>  Me, psychology major/pre-med|`|PcJG3lrDaa	yes, cows have spots and caterpillars have 42 legs.|`|SR04mlQQaa	WTF?! What are you talking about?|`|K7n0DY8Faa	Of course maybe he felt he was stood up. It was like waiting and expecting for something to come and it didn`t. Let him alone with his anger and it`ll pass. (hey you didnt promise him anything eh)|`|Aj0bXSz1aa	Relationships are pointless wastes of time.|`|KiDq2xNiaa	he was planning something.|`|dsF1aWbjaa	It could maybe lead to the guy thinking that the girl is trying to avoid or cheat on him?|`|pdsMM2Xeaa	guys can be like that idk why but i get like that too|`|c9tiQnNIaa	Stalker?? Sounds like it..|`|SnU8rQBkaa	no|`|q1NGyaBraa	i dunno could just have expected u to come|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	get mad baack at him .. to think you have to do as hes says .. tell him to rack off .|`|dbQHlp85aa	because she's broke the pattern. <br>  <br>  Now he probably thinks she's got something going on on the sly.
XH2o1MM6aa	.If this girl is setting you up with her friends,then she has no romantic inclinations in you.She sees you as a friend only.
LGCTOxZxaa	Are you in different social groups? That may be why she doesnt talk to you at school. Or shes too nervous, just be confident and cool, and approach her more often, something will spark for sure :)
ZAz7SEcfaa	say some friend wrote that and laugh in his face. he will stop taking you for granted and then go back to flirting with him.<br>  <br>  he will start chasing the affection he has become so comfortable getting from you.
hWnRY8ZDaa	he probably had a problem at home<br>  its not u|`|TRSAev5waa	i doubt it.<br>  i think he was just in a bad mood..even guys on their honeymoon can be in a bad  mood..it happens..dont worry :]
c5UAa65qaa	Clearly you don't believe her if you're going through her text messages, let alone finding things that are reinforcing those doubts.  If you want to fix the relationship, then stop focusing on what you've both been doing and figure out what needs to be done in order for you to get back together, but I'm not sure you'll be able to overcome the lack of trust.
t8RsIs18aa	You're easier than easy mac
cKlSBc1daa	I suggest put all fingers one by one|`|baRXcPTeaa	Thumb?|`|7Jm2ZZGzaa	the pinky finger of one of your friends :P|`|K7jjvnjpaa	well, it depends. If you are mounting a woman while doing this, definitely your left index finger. But if you are eating peanut butter your right ring finger.
a2MZLS2Qaa	do the same thing to him see if he likes it.|`|dbQHlp85aa	get unattached...<br>  <br>  that's so rude and pigheaded of him to speak of females that way.|`|3jwXB5araa	i dont know, but maybe its his hormones...|`|aeeb1724bde31a668f62b9b940156629aa	I know it isn't so nice to say but in most cases different nationalities I find do treat their g/f's so differently. Im german/irish and I dated an Italian not very long ago I loved the guy to death but he would always make comments about other girls and I would tell him how I felt about that and he said sorry that he wouldnt say anything again that he loved me blah blah blah... but yet he would keep doing it over and over again. If it makes you feel uncomfortable and not very good about yourself I would consider ending the relationship because over time it might do damage to your self esteem and its really not worth that trust me their are so many other men out there that you will love just the same but maybe even more and they will treat you so much better.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	I hope ur sarah<br>  <br>  and i also hope that u realize that humans are created equal, regardless of place of origin<br>  <br>  just tell him to stop|`|MU453gLqaa	Next time a real cute guy walks by say god he is so hot I would just like to ------- him.

XH2o1MM6aa	.He's flirting so he likes you.So do something to grab his attention.
8uiOXAIIaa	yes he likes u he just didnt no u very well on the first day try again he will proboly say yes and if all else fails its his loss Right? oh and he was proboly scared in the beggining  because u were younger
i2ke0Zjxaa	it seems like it  =]<br>  you should write a note to him askinq do he 'LOVE you x]
AA10358331	It hurts when he inserts his penis and the first few thrusts, after that, no the pleasure begins to take over.Then pain goes away after the first few times of having sex. Its they hymen breaking and the walls stretching.  What does it feel like.. like a big stick going inside of you, but they hit all the right spots! If you want to know what it feels like, try using the handle of a hair brush. <br>  <br>  Good for you for waiting until your married. My husband and I waited too, and personally i wouldn't ask it for any other way. There were time that i wanted to, but it was worth it to hold to what i believed. I lost my virginity to the person I wanted to, and I was able to laugh with him because we were trying to figure it all out!|`|589c0be44e080f2889dcc72588d0ea80aa	? it all depends on you..
cwyZk7Fuaa	if u want to stop thinking it's you, then ask him first if its you he likes...if it is you, be honest with him.tell him u don't feel the same way,but that u dont wana lose his friendship.|`|zfWmQst5aa	Are you kidding me, of course it's you!<br>  If you didn't like the other 2 guys when they confessed to you, you're not gonna like this guy either.<br>  <br>  Same things are gonna happen unless you have actual feelings for him.
wlhMUwKsaa	You're probably smothering him.  He probably only wants to get together once or twice a week and that's it.  If you keep bugging him about it, he might break up with you for nagging him...|`|TPud8FMFaa	you're probably just a tad too ugly for him.|`|ICjBorriaa	it's BS and he is not that into you! he is IN to you ( yes he would be happy to have sex with you from time to time) but not THAT into you. If he is making you feel hurt then that is very bad. I think you two are just friends, you really need to find other guys to hang out with.|`|kKOIuslzaa	Nope! A guy who is really into you will make time always! He's not diggin' you as much as you think. Wouldn't you make arrangements and time to see him more?|`|X8Fd2dm6aa	Busy is a code word for not interested. Don't waste your time, you are worth more than that.|`|MAloAT8jaa	he often doesn't like you that much|`|6ZlgdUmIaa	ya im busy. hes just busy 2. that all it mean, its not complicated, maby he needs some time alone 2, i know i do. tell him how you feel but dont forc him to be with you.
g5hbtv4laa	and...?|`|bckwv8ioaa	what's your point?|`|vwL7twjPaa	cool
XH2o1MM6aa	.Not too sure about the 2nd cousin thing.I'd assume you share the same great grand parents.For me that's perfectly alright but society may take a different view.You may care for each other deeply but judge with family their reaction.
XH2o1MM6aa	.Of course he likes and he likes the attention you give him and he does everything he can to maintain his interest in you.So this is good groundwork for a genuine and lasting friendship.
oKRbe6XYaa	Well do what you think is right. But that day she was very talkative with u cus she broked up wit her man & mite not wanna be lonely, & maybe she found out that her bf is still really important to her so now she's trying to get things str8 & she if they can get back 2gether. So yea, just telling u wat i believe is da truth but do what u think is rite.(*_*)GOOD LUCK|`|bedYxivOaa	she might actually like you. but its probably hard for her not to be with her ex so thats probably why she is trying to go back with him. maybe you should ask her to sit with you at lunch or something talk to her and maybe she will forget about her ex and just want to hang out with you more often.|`|VMIR9IoKaa	Don't jump for joy just yet. Just because she was nice to you and looked at you doesn't mean she's interested. She just broke up with her boyfriend! And obviously they're trying to sort their problems out.<br>  It could be that she was trying to distract herself from her breakup by talking to someone else? Or maybe she was trying to make him jealous by paying attention to you.<br>  But it's possible she could be showing some interest. Wait and see how things go and if she continues to show signs of interest then she probably is.|`|FyvrWG6laa	be a good friend to her, everytime your eyes meet show to her that everythings ok, just treat her nicely. For the meantime focus on your studies and prove to your parents that your doing good and enjoying. Dont get serious with a girl yet, your time will just come. God bless you.|`|1scwV5bJaa	don;t get confused with hormones and love, its the hormones acting up, most girls are nice if you get to know them|`|p9r6sKx2aa	Be aloof|`|eCmc97IWaa	Give her some time to get over the relationship. Don't try to rush things. First become friends with her. As your friendship progresses you should eventually be able to see if she is willing to date you when you guys hang out. You can ask her to hang out alone. If she is up for hanging out alone often, she may like you. If she invites other people, she may just value your friendship.|`|Kd0kwQmUaa	Hey, if she is trying to work things out with her boyfriend, then she probably still has feelings for him. I'm sorry, but I am a girl myself, and I wouldn't get back together with my boyfriend after liking another guy. God bless! ?|`|U0Ssc17Daa	If you are nice and you are there for her, she will see that you're a better guy than her ex bf.<br>  <br>  Just be confident, but don't bug her.|`|qMrFd0vNaa	I think she likes you but likes her boyfriend better<br>  <br>  she probably misunderstood something her boyfriend did and he explain what truly happen the day after their break up<br>  <br>  You are her 2nd choose|`|wQcFLCXRaa	she definitly thinks of you as a good friend if she talks to you right after her breakup...so she might like you...|`|iWSKZqvoaa	well, i think she might actually like you.<br>  <br>  ask her out, see what happens.|`|nMMx77wQaa	just give it 2 or 3 weeks.... you really don't want to be her rebound....|`|oEqqWYtEaa	Give her time, she is clearly not over him yet
y4zYkceEaa	Personally I think talking to him in person is better. Texting is old school especially if you went out with him for 6months. Since you both can't be together (for whatever reason), ask him if he wants to remain friends. Exes can be friends. It's better than completely illuminating them out of your life. You can't pretend there was never a connection between the both of you. Give it a try. If he won't accept your friendship, then believe that you're better off without him. Good Luck ;))|`|Q9GFKzg3aa	i think you should ask yourself if you really want him back as a friend or still have serious feelings for him. if you just want to be friends than there is really no harm in talking to him but not in a flirty way or bringing up your past. if you DO still have feelings for him you should talk to him and see if he still has feelings for you. if he doesn't then you could still go along with your friendship idea. just text him and be like hey i haven't talked to you in a while(my ex says that to me every now and then) and ask how he is and stuff like that. after talking to him you should realize if you want to get back together with him or just be friends like you say you want to.|`|swL7bQfAaa	Let sleeping dogs lie! If you happen to see him around and the chance to speak arises, use it. Don't pursue what is not necessary - it will only cause more problems for you both. It will follow its natural course and if you are meant to be friends your paths will cross and it will work out!|`|HCzZClfvaa	Hmmn You could go up to him or text him and just tell him that you want to be friends with him?? Ask if he is willing to give to give friendship and JUST friendship a shot?<br>  But be carful please. Becoming friends with your ex can have bad consequences. <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|vwL7twjPaa	look here sweetie, exes are exes for a reason. they're the PAST. get over him, learn from it, move on.<br>  <br>  good luck to you, it'll be tough though but its a new journey.
p9r6sKx2aa	Just be aloof...and WHIP it, WHIP it real good!|`|gYuJUyvvaa	Just keep talking, that's an obvious sign that you like us if you're going red lol.<br>  <br>  They'll love it, it's cute ;)|`|JzAMcMzlaa	i think being bash full is one of the prettiest things that can happen =]. Anyway.. just talk.. and please be yourself because we will find out. Even if you do turn red and they wait for a reply..just say hi and look down..he will smile..and he will take control of trying to talk to u. He knows that u are bash full by then. But don't depend on him..if he doesn't..notes and text messages are a bit...10 years ago lol..but it always still works =]|`|ICOmnGIUaa	get one guy that all your gf's are good friends with have them bring him over and just practice talking to him. And do not be mad if you mess up it will only make it worse.

Try asking around to find out who has the same likes/dislikes as you, then talk to them...|`|yOu724shaa	well the problem is tat u think too much abt it<br>  <br>  stop thinking abt guys as ppl from other planet ... they r also normal humans and u can go and talk casual stuff wid them and no1 wud mind or say nething<br>  <br>  if ur heart starts pouncing before u go to start a talk then just think in mind that the guy wont bite u ....at worse 2/3 out of 10 wud think u r starnge.....or u talk strangely but the rest will just act normally....<br>  <br>  u can start by asking time or enquring abt directions or ask for class notes which will boost ur confidence and then u can continue the talks just as u talk wid gals|`|r3LI6mKhaa	Hahah, y eah same here. Guys that seem funny and cute and who i'm attracted you. You just have to have confidence! I hate how I turn red also because i get embarass if I say something stupid and not funny. Just find a common interest and go from there. The right guy will listen to you  and pay attention|`|49a82a8cdfa7d7006aafe861637faf39aa	Its upsetting to hear this because a lot of guys get down if girls don't talk to them. It really makes my day. <br>  <br>  Just remember, no matter what we enjoy it!<br>  <br>  Just start making eye contact and saying hi. Its hard at first, but is realistically the easiest thing to do! Youll be surprised at the warm reponses! Its they act weird its their own shyness and their problem, not yours.|`|nMMx77wQaa	First of all you have to be confident about your self and when you talk to guys be friendly and.... chill about it ...more like whatever you know dont really care if they enjoy ur conversation or not and dont get all hung up on them....<br>  And You'll Be Fine<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|PYF8cYtqaa	just go for it im sure they wont bite.|`|7GxZTxMbaa	Same way just with Girls :( Oh I'm a boy to just say....

v5Ta04Mtaa	Just think about it this way.<br>  <br>  You only live once!<br>  and these are the most fun times you'll have in your life.<br>  besides, whats life worth living if your not living life?<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090218202923AADzb60&vm=r">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|THe0Jt0haa	YOu just need to try and get over it.<br>  If you cant talk to him in person, talk on the phone or through the interenet...<br>  <br>  itll get easier as time goes on, thats how i was with my boyfriend at first, then it just got easier to talk to him.|`|r8ynDWCjaa	It doesnt sound like your shy. It sounds like you are self conscious and worry about what he may say or do. You may want to talk to your dr and see if you need xanax for this type of stress. Its weird, i used to sleep next to my bf fine  and since he started saying that i talk in my sleep I started getting anxiety attacks laying there waiting to go to sleep at night. My bf says you better not say someone elses name in your sleep, but im worried because I have nightmares of my ex stalking me and trying to hurt me. lets just say my ex's and i left on a bad note. You should write him an email or letter describing how you feel and what happens when you try to talk to him, he will probalby tell you that you are over reacting and that everything is ok and then you can talk to him in person. You need to change your ways of communication because a relationship cannot thrive like this. You will never have a successful relationship without communication.|`|YEcY1b1Saa	Im guessing your pretty young. In middle school i remember i had a bf & i didnt say a WORD to him for like 2 weeks....we just sat there holding hands. it was awkward. He ended up dumping me a few days later. Just remember that he is dating you because he likes you. So it doesnt matter what you say. just have a good time
RJUgeoKHaa	tell her the truth tell her you think things are going to go bad soon physical bad trust me my boyfriend was like this i eventually got shoved into a wall pinned there and slapped by him its the worst thing that has ever happened to me i always watch out for girls with this problem help her as soon as that *** is out of her life she will be so much better off|`|7HYJG7q9aa	well dude this is complicated and all but if she likes the guy than idk what u can do to get them apart but u could try and show her that she is too good for him or something and she really cnt be truley happy if this guy is suck a dick in my opinion but girls are so ******* wierd liek that and sometimes dude u just gatta back out and let it resolve itself but just use good judgement im sure ull figure out a great solution|`|nRLBRLwiaa	I had the same problem I worked with this one girl and she was dating this guy for about 2 years and he was the same way just a real dick and I knew she wasn't happy so what I did was just being there to comfort her and help her with the problems she was having with him and after about 2-3 weeks she ended up dumping him and maybe a week or 2 after that she was dating me but then she decided to leave me for another guy...so the best advice I have for you is just be there for her don't rush things like force her out her relationship even though you know shes not happy just talk to her and when she realizes shes happier with you she'll dump him just give it time.|`|TDfuhLPQaa	well have you told her how you felt? Tell her she doesn't deserved to be treated that way and that her boyfriend itsn't worth it.  Tell her how you feel, and that you want more than friendship...but if thats not what she wants then tell her you will always be there for her no matter what. <br>  <br>  there isn't much you can do really.  Just tell her how you feel, and the rest is up to her. Good Luck!
bBJXp9oFaa	Well, I think you could because the girl probably would've told her friends. So, by watching her friends, they will probably look at you alot, just to see what you're up to and stuff. I DONT KNOW, it's hard to explain. But maybe if theyre looking at you talking uietly and stuff.<br>  <br>  hard to explain, sorry. :)|`|a45c2cc73915d245be2735d9c1260381aa	How to tell if she likes you:<br>  <br>  *She gazes in your eyes with deep interest and her pupils are dilated.<br>  <br>  *Her skin tone becomes red while being around you.<br>  <br>  *Her crossed leg is pointed towards you or if that same leg is rocking back and forth towards you.<br>  <br>  *She raises or lowers the volume of her voice to match yours.<br>  <br>  *She rubs her chin or touches her cheek.

jQFk7KT4aa	he's a teenager.  nuff said|`|EFD3c81Gaa	Don't worry about it at all. You're obviously a kid, and your relationship with him would last all of 2 weeks assuming it went super-well. <br>  <br>  The bottom line is this: Kids never stay together very long, irregardless of who they are. Besides, even if you did get together, what are you going to do? Go to the mall together? When you're 2 or 3 years older, you'll look back at that and laugh like crazy.<br>  <br>  Relationships don't mean anything until you're in your mid-twenties. Everything before that is drama. Expensive, time-consuming, pointless drama. <br>  <br>  Go read a book.|`|z0CQ1AWIaa	move on. thats the best thing to do. its not rite for him to hide you. its like your not good enough. date one of his friends and im sure that will make him mad.|`|3BfNshHYaa	Yikes.  Maybe he's dating already?  Are you suuuuure you aren't less popular than him?  <br>  <br>  OH i know - i think - maybe his friends think ur weird and he doesnt want to go out w/you cuz hes afraid of what his friends will think... no that cant be it.  cuz his friends asked u out!!! UUUUUGHHHHH! THIS IS ANNOYING ME!  lol sry i get stressed out a bit too much........... hang on i have to think..... hm cant think of anything... r u sure hes worth it?  <br>  <br>  oh WAIT! maybe hes just not into public relationships and doesnt want to go serious.... hm, yes thats prbly why.  he doesnt want the world knowing that u and him are together, and he doesnt want everyone getting into his business.  Maybe.  Idk.  Sry, hope it helps.  <br>  <br>  Btw this is going to bother me for quite a while.  Tell me if anything happens... idk how u will but JUST DO! haha no jk its ok if u dont
t7c4nZ2xaa	Don't think about it too much, just do it.<br>  Surprise her, but make it inviting.<br>  Make sure not to overdue it.|`|RnQFwIuUaa	Go to www.cosmopolitian.com. Read their articles. It will help.|`|OSSRoUs2aa	Well no one can tell you what time to kiss and there really is no way to kiss.

You know one of those with the mMm;wWw'.a`,H', sounds !?!at the end of it lol.. TRY THIS GIVE HER 2 or 3 short pecks on the cheeks `bout every 3 to 5  or 10 minutes !! depending on how long you two conversate !?! & if it stays at that..

G/L~!!   r'`R`'r|`|rlfaVhlxaa	its really not that difficult. theres no secret to it... i would describe it but i dont think thats gonna help. just go with it. one thing you dont want to do is overuse the tongue (if shes wants to use the tongue). it will probably just be an everyday kiss on the lips. i think you can handle it.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	just be confident|`|j2qrOjo1aa	dont stress surprize kisses are the best kind!|`|IHK2suw7aa	Haha. Talk about Awkward. Its not going to be good probably.

You should feel that both of you are caught up into this little world where it's only you and her, and then you lean in. simple. i know it's nerve racking, but hey! it's going to be worth it....trust me ;]|`|YoN8fV4Caa	just kiss, her.<br>  <br>  you will have a butterfly feeling in your gut,<br>  that tells you its the right time,<br>  <br>  Do It how you feel It should Be Theres no Wrong Or Right.|`|ibKMtCBYaa	just go in and do it. if u really think about it nothing bad can come from it because she has been hinting. so just do it.|`|07HWkV4eaa	Just kiss her, before I do.|`|V2SHuCM6aa	etter kiss her fast cus i kissed her and shes a really good kisser she uses tounge

p9j5zl4Naa	I am the same way.  Im not very good at groups of people I dont know well, but Im great one on one.  I suggest trying to get the girl youre interested in alone.  Or ask your friends to help you out.  Im sure they would be more than willing to get you involved in the conversation.|`|7HYJG7q9aa	ya dude i undertsand where u r coming from but u just gatta break that mindset and just throw urself out there i mean dont do it irrationaly and screw it all up. dont like try and impress or anything tot he point where ur friends will think ur a tool but also try and get in one on one and be charming and cute it hink girls like that
7foornMVaa	Tough one, keep on looking for it and show her how sorry you are, not keep saying it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|lvIPNDbgaa	Tell her what happened and do your best to replace it.

FtBqmFDEaa	Do one night stands count as dates?  Of course its not bad, if you're horny your're horny, just use protection.<br>  <br>  Its better than dating for 5 months then finding out the guy has a tiny todger.|`|4f3017e9314ece0d4dcec124019bf954aa	yea.  you should only have sex with a person you are committed with or married to.|`|fd7fe1f691df6908d8e583dbd5b9a6b7aa	it's not good.  It gives the perception that you'll do it with anyone any time.|`|Oa4QZGXSaa	Why do you keep asking all of these questions about doing it on the first date?|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	yes, it shows that your easy and can do it with anyone. especially when you dont know the guy that well|`|jD0nfrIBaa	Yeah<br>  <br>  Very bad<br>  <br>  Heck, I've been with my guy for over a year and 7 months (and have known him for 6 months prior to that even during our "flirting" and getting to know each other stage) and still haven't done it with him (I plan on saving it for marriage, but still).<br>  <br>  Sex on the first date screams that  you're a wh**e and you're EZ|`|U286XG21aa	Thats really up to you.. But its better to wait that way you at least gives you time to get to know the person... And you can see what his motives are... But if you decided to go and sleep with him,,, Then thats your business.. And your the one that will have to deal with your choices....  But most guys dont like it when a girl gives it up that easy...  And they dont have  repesct for themselves.|`|zCakedeXaa	your not a bad girl. i would say u know what u what.  be sure u want to and not being pressured into it.  most guys hate teases but if your too easy he might be bored, make him fight for it.  it is more fun for everyone that way.|`|e6DxkKBpaa	does what? jk lol. but yah it is probably not that great of a thing to do...i am not gonna until i am married so i think it is bad.|`|RD05jXYwaa	if you have to ask i have to say no. if you just do it without questions i enjoy it, as much as you do. tmm|`|f17RMVa3aa	wtf?!<br>  <br>  of course its bad! you have to leave the guy wanting more each time|`|jvKazMgwaa	depends on your beliefs.|`|cqMULVB9aa	Yes. I would never want to be with a girl like that.|`|LsBS5bOCaa	((((YES))))
3QSiLT2baa	Test the waters. You never know. Anything can happen.|`|cGNVYpVIaa	well hold on. If you don't really like tis guy, and you just think hes kind of cute, then what you're doing is using him as an experiment, right? I don't know about this guy, but if i hooked up with someone, i don't think that I would be too happy if i found out that she didn't really like me much, she just wanted to "test the water", or see if it worked out. I am a human being, not some water to be tested, darn it!<br>  <br>  But in all seriousness, i think it really depends on the guy. If he doesn't get fazed by much, it'll probably be ok, especially if he's run through a few girlfriends.|`|Ii5udGmJaa	it all depends on what your true intentions are , and rather or not he knows them.<br>  It would be mean if you just want to hook up with him just because he is cute , and he thinks that he is going to have a long term relationship with you. <br>  So heres my  2 bits,<br>  tell him that you don't really see you 2 having a long term relationship but would like to try any ways , and if he feels the same way then problem solved. Besides I don't think he would mind hooking up with you.<br>  besides whats the worst that could happen ?<br>  all he can say is no. <br>  so good luck|`|93b9efecd6ca82bff2f4e552457b1bd7aa	Ummmmmm, that is kind of the point to dating. Just make sure you don't go too fast or give the vibe that it is a long term relationship. You never know he might turn out to be a winner or not. But, you will never know if you don't try.|`|ClaJhsYVaa	No i dont think it would be mean at all, you would be giving the boy a chance wich is always a good thing :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Please help me : <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219221810AAOuG1w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|5yIph0u5aa	Be careful it could ruin your friendship w/ ur friend if it doesn't go well with the brother.|`|4wkIOVDoaa	Not at all.

You will be playing with his feelings just to flatter yourself.|`|4bAZW3F6aa	yea it would be mean, dont go for it if you dont really want it as you might lead the guy in false hope|`|rrXkIJ0xaa	You never know until you try.|`|SzsrajV4aa	No it wouldn't. I find learning more about a person is the purpose of dating and relationships.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	hmm...I wouldnt. <br>  <br>  But your thoughs can change once you hook up with him. You'll never no until you try. But no, I dont think that would be mean.|`|M7r7gHNGaa	You already perceive a rather big objection to the guy. "...kind of immature..." and stating you don't know if you see yourself having a relation ship with him makes me think you're only interested in him being "really cute". What are your motives for wanting to hook up with him? <br>  <br>  Regardless of your definition of "hooking up", I think you should simply leave him alone. You can't just think of yourself when dealing with other people. How would you feel if you "hooked up" with him, developed an emotional connection then he dumped YOU?|`|HKkbqlIuaa	No it would not be mean. In general, you never REALLY know where things are going to lead. I would try things with him and see how it works out. That's how dating usually goes anyway, you're probably just a little more worried about this because if it doesn't work out, you'll still be seeing him quite frequently. I wouldn't worry about that too much. You don't want to leave yourself wonder, "I wonder what would have happened.............?" Lol well good luck, and I hope everything works out!|`|P7mYy4CFaa	Tell him the truth and say I like you but feel like you may be a little immature so if you want to go out,lets go, but if you act imature I will have to change my mind about you..|`|8be50fd52c14928ab397f86265c4cb52aa	test the waters|`|bAnyRNZUaa	NO!  I'm not sure how old you are so I don't want to be mean or shatter any illusions but it cracks me up on here when I hear girls talk about guys wanting relationships so much.  GIRLS want relationships, guys want to hook up with lots of different girls.  YOU are more likely to get hurt in the relationship game then a guy is for the most part.  That's not to say guys don't like a steady girl to hook up with, but that's different...<br>  <br>  Two thoughts:<br>  1) you'd better check with your brother.  He might have a big problem or want to steer you away if his boy is a dog.<br>  2) I'm guessing you are very young, but it's probably not the best idea to go into something with the goal of a "long term relationship".  You need to see how you guys connect, learn more about each other, and let things play out...|`|PK5Elowdaa	Im a guy. My advice to you is don't do it unless you're sure you want a relationship. Thats the mistakes females make nowadays. Jumping into something only to test the waters. If you find out he's not the one for you, its going to be hard to break it off. Try getting to know him a little longer before you jump into something you're not sure of. How would you like it if a guy went out with you and he's unsure?  I hate it when girls do this.|`|k1AZtmM1aa	Ya I would say so.What if he was ugly?Would you want to hook up with him then?You don't really like his personality anyway.Just be patient and wait for that one guy you want to spend the rest of your life with.I think you just like him cuz he's atractive and he would give you attention.I mean is it really worth both of y'alls time cuz you were attracted to eachother?This really seems like an affection game to me,and you might hurt him in the end cuz you wanted to "try him out"|`|uJ9waJDYaa	Hm, I don't think it would be mean though you really should tell him of your intentions.<br>  Just start going out as friends and hanging out and see how things go with that, then maybe hook up. But you really should tell him after wards, or even before that you aren't sure what you want right now, and you just want to see how it goes with you and him.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|aL0OCQG3aa	No, just hook up with him, and than when he asks whether or not you guys should go on into a relationship just be like "when we hooked up I didnt feel any feeling or passion" soemthing that sounds all deep and what not haha. That way you get the satisfation of a hookup, while he finally gets closure of knowing that you and him wont work out.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	no it wouldnt|`|f17RMVa3aa	actually i would do that haha<br>  <br>  and if it goes good yay for you :)<br>  <br>  answer mine please<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219222401AAqrwhq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	not so Mean, just give him a chance u never know he could be the right one.<br>  u could actually like him after dating him, he may be different as a BF

I hate to put them in a box, but it's true.<br>  <br>  It's not about a guys image, really, that make me wanna approach a guy.

dqeR7BJlaa	Let me tell you something, the girlfriend I have now and have had for 3 years just happened to be in my everyday life and we talked and just hit it off... like a normal friendship. All my previous girlfriends I had to try to get their attention and it didn't work out. Don't play their stupid ******* games. If it's going to work out in the first place just be yourself, talk to them if you want and they'll talk to you if they aren't stuck up :)|`|WfUMOPyhaa	no i just think youre the kind of person who need some encouragement to get up and go for a girl.  at least you recognize youre lazy, but youre not really going tohave much luck if you continue to be that way.|`|b0vq1CDLaa	if youre to lazy to even talk to a girl, you probably are to lazy to be fun to date.

MTwNXcZvaa	Okay, wow. I had a very similar experience with an ex who committed suicide a little over a year ago. I can tell you this: Two months is not enough time to get over something this big. To be honest, I am still dealing with it. I can tell you how I dealt with it, but I am sure that it will be different for you. I quit my job and basically went into hiding for a while. I stayed with some friends in the country. Then I got a job in another state and moved there for 7 mos. That is a little extreme, I know, but I needed to get out of dodge. One of the best ways to deal with this is to write about it. keep a journal. Writing is a great outlet especially if, like me, you don't really want to talk about it even though everyone is telling you you need to talk to someone.(The idea of seeing a therapist or psychiatrist is still utterly unbearable to me) I even wrote a letter to my ex, telling him how I felt about what he did and things I felt I should have told him when he was still alive. Eventually I ended up burning that letter. My artwork is also a great healer for me.   The main thing; And listen very closely here, It is NOT your fault. It took me several months to realize this, even though my friends and family kept drilling it into my head. The fact is, guilt is an inevitable side-effect. After that subsides, I guarantee there will be some anger, and rightfully so. That is a selfish thing to do. Her actions were her own. I know you've probably heard it all at this point, but believe me, you will get there eventually.  I could write a whole book at this point, but I will stop here for now. I hope that someday you and I both will reach a point where we can see this terrible thing as something that will not only make us stronger , but give us better perspectives and insight on life in general. <br>  <br>  Take care, and drop me line if you have any questions or just want to get something off your chest. Sometimes it can be much easier talking to a complete stranger.|`|c630401eb9baa68dddde8641339b6a29aa	I'm so sorry for what happened. Honestly, I don't think I can give you a good answer, or anybody on this site. Don't take this as an insult, but I really think you should consider talking to a counselor or psychiatrist who can help you through this. <br>  I hope you know that you still have people there for you.
QggEZxaeaa	it's love, but move on and give someone  a chance :)|`|AA12022610	sounds like it|`|cOConVpXaa	if you don't think its love, or have any doubts about it, than chances are its not.<br>  <br>  i'm sure you're just being a smart girl and not settling for someone you don't find to be "the whole package"|`|k1AZtmM1aa	Maybe.But he may not be the love of your life|`|f17RMVa3aa	could be :)|`|ilLPvvU7aa	I think it WAS love........your first love.........you never forget 'em|`|ooqFBtq9aa	you went out with a BOY<br>  <br>  and you use that many question marks<br>  <br>  <br>  are you old enough to think long term relationships?
mp6JUzUhaa	I think you guys should enjoy each others company...................<br>  age aint nothing but a nr. in my opinion......, and you will notice if she;s only with you for the money..............<br>  <br>  of course there are young girls who find that attractive because they have a certain "security" ..............<br>  <br>  But if she really likes you, and you like her.... why not?|`|rTaaIXSuaa	LOL, she doesn't love you. And you, being  a 38 year old man you should have the intelligence to see this.<br>  She loves the thickness of your wallet. So of course she's going to love your 'company'.|`|xXGn1zfsaa	*cough*shesagolddigger*cough*|`|LsBS5bOCaa	(((( NOT GOOD))))<br>  <br>  Not for long.  She's a gold-digger, dude.|`|FyqCMrCdaa	Its obvious my friend that people will assume your buying her or what not....That does not matter though. If yall really like each other then why not? Just remember though the age difference is not something to be neglected. I often tell my friend this in a joking manner "so  young, so naive" lol so remember her competence/intelligence/motives may not match yours. A 21 yr old female usually has different intentions at her age especially if shes in college. lol You know how that goes. lol
Zue2XXQOaa	You seem sincere about it, so don't give up. Don't call her a bunch of times, just pace it out. If you don't hear from her in a couple of weeks, call her again. Give it another week, and then do the good old "texting" trick. Just text her and ask her how she's been and what's up. The best way is to play it cool but flatter her in the same way. Say you really want to meet her because she interests you. If you still don't her back from her, it's probably best to let her go. She's either not interested or too busy herself. And you definitely don't want to come off desperate, so just pace it out. <br>  I hope that helps.<br>  - aidan|`|gmBzMFDLaa	she probably feels stood up.<br>  like you're a jerk.<br>   but you're not, so dont worry.<br>  stop calling her and play hard to get.<br>  you did the right thing.<br>  <br>  if it doesnt work out, it just doesnt work out.<br>  find a girl that respects that you actually HAVE a life outside of her.
ZjM0ghSnaa	Any time is the right time to start looking for a gf, as long as your ready to be in a relationship when a girl comes along. Personally, I think 20 is the perfect time. And its ok if you've never had a gf (I know ppl the same age as you and older who havent either). I agree, it is rare to find girls that your interested in, (im kind of picky myself, not in a shallow way though)<br>  <br>  If you ever find a girl that your interested, go for her. Dont freak her out though by coming on too strong (which I know you wont do). Just be yourself and the right girl will eventually come for you. Your young, your 20, you have your whole life to get into a relationship. Would you rather rush to find a gf(in which the outcome of the relationship doesnt come out well), or wait a while to have the perfect girl? Just be yourself and let the chips fall where they may! <<--haha I had to include that in there! <br>  <br>  Best of Luck:)|`|jD0nfrIBaa	Stop looking and just enjoy what's going on in your life with friends, family, and other stuff.  Once you stop looking for her, she'll come along.|`|CIKr28xoaa	hurry up and start dating
5nmFtzgqaa	Don't ask her if she wants to be friends,<br>  just add her and send her a message after she accepts<br>  (everybody accepts everybody on facebook)<br>  and start casual conversations about classes and stuff.<br>  After that, it'll be easier to talk to her in person.<br>  If you have a class with her, it'd be easier, but just start saying hi in the halls<br>  and honestly, that can get you pretty far.<br>  Offer to walk her to classes and you'll slowly get into more conversation.<br>  Good luck!|`|5898be249e4a040763c5194ca001e728aa	I'm not gonna laugh but you could be a little more creative.Yeah don't try cyber relationships they never work. If anything talk to her on facebook after you've actually talked to her.Just have the balls to go up to her and introduce yourself. Your confidence will impress her, she'll kinda be in awe its not everyday teen guys have the confidence to just go up and introduce themselves to a girl.Or perhaps get a mutual friend to introduce the two of you.Best of luck.|`|UYfeRLxwaa	I think your approach makes sense. There's nothing wrong with the facebook thing, it's actually easier for you since she is always around a large crowd.

rTaaIXSuaa	Well you have two choices here.<br>  Don't tell and let him continue his bullying with you OR<br>  you stand up for yourself by either confronting him face to face which I guarantee that he will stop. Bullies retreat when confronted. If you can't do that, tell your mother, person in charge of the school, whoever. It is their duty to put a stop to the bullying and make sure school is a safe place for you. You should NOT be afraid of retaliation.|`|9bSCOZB1aa	Just ignore him. Don't try to be nice, don't try to be mean, just flat out ignore him. Bullies piss me off. I hate how immature they are. I was never bullied, but hearing about other people being bullied always drives me crazy|`|SdOtY7Isaa	rude.<br>  laugh in his face.. act like you don't care.<br>  he's doing these things not because he feels superior.. but because he feels insecure.<br>  just ignore him,<br>  you cant worry about people that act like him. <br>  good luck|`|MueDyDyDaa	say to him wat the **** is your problem<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  when he calls u names, just laugh about it and say ''got anything else''<br>   <br>  eventually he will stop|`|u2rYPblDaa	You must be really smart to be in college and your only 13.

I'd carry a baseball bat with me just incase. It might help to deter his vulgar behavior when he sees you carrying it. I am in no way saying you should use it for violence, I am only saying to carry it or play baseball with it. Also, report him to the police, but don't tell him. Telling him anything is like giving him a reason to hurt you. Tell everyone you know and trust like teachers, counselors, parents, tell everyone about what he's doing to you and they will help you figure out a good plan of action to make this kid stop. Good Luck!|`|ugmtF6Bsaa	Kick his ***.....|`|Rkik3eUuaa	u sound like a wuss. immediately tell your mother u want to enroll in some martial art class.< or boxing. u re a future man, how come u re afraid the same aged boy? he senses u re afraid, that's why he is mean. start martial art class immediately. do not try to befriend this mean boy, he will be even meaner to u cos he knows u re scared of him
8YfYh3y0aa	It's natural to miss her.... be happy that you have somebody to care about so much.   The main thing here, is that you must not start feeling sorry for yourself.     She'll be back soon, and you have plenty of stuff to keep you busy until she returns. <br>  <br>  While she's away, write her a letter (yes, a real letter...pen & paper...you know?).  Tell her how much you miss her.  Tell her what you miss about her.   Hand it to her on Monday when you see her (after the big welcome home hug).
6DGLxJ1daa	I'm with 'being nosey"s response.  It seems like it may have offended her or caught her off guard.  She seemed to react as if she were shy and did not expect it.  Going on those cues, I'd say a small apology for making her uncomfortable would be in good taste, if it didn't happen more than a week ago.  If next time you see her, she is still acting uncomfortable around you, then the apology would do good.<br>  <br>  Personally, some days I like the attention, other days I am off-guard and may get offended.  But most times I like the attention, it boosts my self-esteem to see guys looking.|`|Wwb1Ywf0aa	Absolutely not! Honestly as a woman it's almost a compliment that you like what is there enough to look, and in your case it's even better because you seem like such a sweet guy and I'm sure she knows that. All women understand that men have needs and although they may not always provide what the guy needs they understand the urge. Don't worry about it!|`|ul7itRe8aa	I have big breast and I think that if I have a shirt that reveals them then I'm asking for attention.  So she may just be embarrassed by it.  Just ask her if she if offended and I'm sure you guys can go back to talking again.  She should be flattered that you find her sexy and have not disrespected her. Good LUCK.|`|2Y017yBdaa	It definitely bugs me. It just makes me feel uncomfortable and not trust that person anymore. But I do understand that you're a guy and its natural for you to do that.|`|u2rYPblDaa	Of course not. It is natural for men/guys to look. If  you didnt then you wouldnt be human. For a lady to get mad because of a casual glance then obviously she has a problem with perverts.|`|AT4erlHzaa	when im talking and if a guy is just staring at my boobs i dont get mad im just think hey im up here... but if you just take a peek thats fine as long as you dont over do it... next time you see her shell prolly be fine|`|dffe3d0533cae84e9ffacb6c6b597350aa	<a href="http://milkysharts.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://milkysharts.blogspot.com/</a>|`|MUizjJpEaa	i would be flattered. it doesnt make me mad at all lol.|`|MTvAdOPjaa	You ARE a guy, so there's no need for her to get offended. <br>  It's not like you tried to grab her chest or anything.<br>  & if she didn't like you peeking at her boobs, maybe she shouldn't<br>  of worn that "nice" shirt. Ya know?<br>  I am a D cup and I catch some guys looking sometimes,<br>  but I can't do anything about it unless they go after them.<br>  Right?<br>  I think she kinda overreacted, just apologize if anything so things<br>  aren't weird anymore. :]<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|5qAUsXzfaa	I personally love it.  LOL  It's a turn on that someone is looking at me in that way.  I'm not a slut, but I am a major nympho.  I love those sort of looks|`|sZhTwzh4aa	i'm not "offended" by it, but i usually just wear straight-up t-shirts so it makes it a little bit tougher for you all =P i mean, i realize that guys are prone to look, but it does make you seem shallow. just an FYI.|`|Q5KFND17aa	nah i find it a turn on...maybe thats weird but i think its hot if a guy ive  been flirting with is thinking of me sexually. 0.0 also, any girl wearing a low cut shirt has it coming, so if she's pissed she can just remind herself its her own fault. you are not in the wrong here.|`|5tl1uLgVaa	Hahah :) no I wouldn't if you're as you say you are.<br>  Guys are guys, and there's nothin you can do about it. <br>  I wouldn't get my panties in a bunch cause of this.|`|aL0OCQG3aa	I dont get upset, You ARE a man after all. I mean come on, its kind of expected. and if she was wearing a "nice shirt" that showed them off she obviously wanted that attention on her chest anyway!|`|ytMpRueeaa	its in your blood to look trust me if she gets mad then she probably gets mad at alot of little things...... stayyyy awayyyyy|`|sU9wrTr4aa	No, it would not make me mad, just a little concerned that you were caught! But play it off and apologize to her. Let her know that if it offended her that you are sorry but that you find her attractive and the situation presented itself where you were able to take a look at her, it just happened at the time when she bent over...Good Luck and Stay blessed!|`|vg9C2TqQaa	certain people may get mad or offended. she may think now that you're only interested in her body. you have to be careful with things like that. and us women are complicated. maybe she thinks you're thinking of her in a different way than she is thinking of you and that may cause a lot of awkwardness. hopefully, she doesnt avoid you.|`|UNhYZMoWaa	I know I have caught guys looking at my chest and behind, but at first I was embarassed but then I was like oh well it's human nature.<br>  <br>  A funny event happened to me when I was walking back to train station on New year's morning with my boyfriend, this guy came up beside me and said "Hey boobs" while looking at them.   I just laughed and so did my boyfriend.<br>  <br>  Human nature my friend.|`|Y96jpGe2aa	Bro your a good guy.  I feel the reason why the girl acted differently is because she got a little embarrassed.  She may not be used to situations like that or that she had a previous experience like that that she got embarrassed about.  Some of the answerers are right, don't worry too much, it just shows that you really like the girl for being this concerned.  She should know about this post!|`|f17RMVa3aa	i wouldn't get mad or anything. but i guess she felt a little weird?<br>  <br>  i'd actually be kinda flattered hahah like someone else said it's actually a turn on but i wouldn't want you moving your whole head and just LOOKING! that's creepy haha what you did was totally fine in my opinion|`|MPOHHTtAaa	I take it as a compliment but sometimes when I think someones looking at my a$$ it makes me feel self consious. I think she wanted you too look but after you did maybe she felt shy.|`|RZzw2m8uaa	I'd probably be embarrassed, since I'm shy... But I don't think she would be mad, especially if you said she likes you :)|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	Well, by staring at her boobs you made her feel like a sex object. She may have been offended. Way to go!
w2WFDunnaa	Is this a question or a novel?!?!
VkzmH1GKaa	Is what you want to tell her good or bad? Is it something you would want someone to tell you if the roles were reversed? Remember friends have each others back no matter what.
eNulfbs7aa	ok..lol..whatever happened in first grade...stays in first grade..similar to Vegas...so let it go...and move forward.  If you want to go out with him...DO IT!!!!  You don't have to tell your friends..but if they are your friends..they will agree...leave it in elementary school.  Have Fun!!  Don't sniff the glue!|`|qy07K2k5aa	There's no need to tell anyone, but if they find out, there's no real harm either.|`|AA11996507	Tell all your friends.  Maybe they can figure out what a "rivle" is.|`|rLiyrhCdaa	well how old are you?<br>  I am in High School and when i was younger i DID have bfs, and now, i look back and laff at how seriously we took it. Listen, unless your bffs with the kid, i would just go up to him and ask him out. Or ask him if he liked me back. Whats the worst that could happen? He says no. So what? its not like it will change your relationship. <br>  All this nonsense about it being "awkward" is a bunch of B.S. <br>  Trust me!!<br>  <br>  If you trust your friends tell them. I have this one really good friend that just cant keep a secret so i never tell her any of my big secrets and i always tell my friends not to tell her.|`|pFjgBBUZaa	lol your in first grade and you have problems like this too?
y0GOP487aa	He acts dumb around you.

Good luck with your guy(:<br>  <br>  Hope he realizes what he wants.|`|oYCfEWSfaa	"How can a female know if the guy is really interested with her?"<br>  <br>  Ask him. Listen to his response.|`|Zue2XXQOaa	Very good question. Some guys are just horny, other guys are just as confused. It really depends on the guys. But since you asked, here are some signs a guy is flirting with you:<br>  <br>  #1: He teases you.<br>  Even if it's playful or comes out down right mean, if a guy says something obnoxious or rude, that can mean he's interested in you. Guys like playing the whole "stone-cold" game sometimes. They think it makes them look like they're important. These guys usually are looking for seriously relationship, but pretend to be assholes to avoid being rejected.<br>  <br>  #2: If he's incredibly shy.<br>  A guy who stammers or simply can't make eye contact with you is a definite sign he has feelings for you. You just need to make him comfortable enough to talk to you.<br>  <br>  #3: If he pretends like he has no interest in you at all.<br>  Yes, I know that might be hard to tell. But sometimes guys that talk to you like to pretend they don't like you...when they actually do. Of course this leads to mixed signals, but this guy is just like #1--he fears rejection.<br>  <br>  The best way to deal with guys that act like assholes or pretend like you don't exist, is to give them a taste of their own medicine. For #1, hit him back with some wit attached, and he'll back down if he's truly interested. For #3, do the same. Play hard to get. He'll back down. <br>  Us guys don't know what we want either, and girls, you guys are just unbelievably confusing! Haha<br>  <br>  Hope that helped<br>  - aidan|`|Hiw6VZOhaa	When a man likes you, he finds way to get your attention, to see if you like him too and to get you to like him. But it becomes clear when he go out of his way to please you no matter what hour of the day it is . Guy as a friend don't go out of their way to please you all day long, neitherless consistantly; they have better thing to do. They only sent mixed signals to see if you like him. Have you ever see a bee, fly around the flower all day and never landed nor goes out where? No right. Guy are like that. If they want some thing, eventually it will show it.|`|TZ1Z2nhhaa	All men know what they want    SEX
K1UicE7kaa	I think he is a cuddly friendly kind of guy... I would be patient and friendly and not try to define it as anything more than that at this time.  <br>  <br>  If it is more than that... other things will surface.  Just take it for face value at this point and don't make it anything more than a "trusted buddy relationship".  He will try harder to make it more if you are friendly but don't force the issue.  You are not rejecting him... you are just maintaining and enjoying it on that level.  That is a good thing!  Smile a lot... laugh with him as appropriate and be a really good listener.  You will have him eating out of your hand eventually.|`|8FiJ5i81aa	hes a ho stay away|`|4jW455dgaa	I think he likes you but he wants to keep his eggs in more than one basket if you know what i mean... He wants to have a backup.  Now the problem is identifying whether it is you or the other girl who is the backup.|`|BqXSymxjaa	I think, uh, maybe, ask him.|`|iSDs32e2aa	Yeah he likes you because if there are other girls in your group why doesnt he do the same to them|`|WiTdZAZsaa	yes he does like u|`|Wwb1Ywf0aa	Hes obviously interested in you but he also seems a little bit on the player side if hes doing the same thing to other people. I think having fun and flirting with him is all good, but anything serious isn't a good idea because it seems like hes the kinda guy who could really break a girls heart, you know? <br>  GOOD LUCK, anyways though!! :) <br>  and thanks for answering my question! haha|`|X5RIiL7Paa	i think it seems like he likes you - i could be wrong but why would someone waste time paying so much attention to someone - also boys are stupid so you never know - i'm sorry - maybe just give it some time and see what happens, how did the other girl that he went out with find out it was serious? maybe you should just confront him.|`|CUB3wUdiaa	he might be one of those guys who feels the need to make all girls feel special.  which makes it hard for the girls that may like him know exactly how he feels.  been there done that.  all i can say is talk to him and find out exactly whats what.  i know its easier said than done but try....|`|dYGnVjjoaa	Maybe a close friend who likes to get touchy?<br>  Is he close enough to ask if he likes any girls to get an idea of his love seeking scene?<br>  <br>  I dont know, just my few cents :)|`|NmA0nJKHaa	He digs you. If he didnt, he wouldnt wanna be near you|`|AhKMDIJNaa	LOL!<br>  <br>  I like a guy named Matt as well. Same situation. Hope it is not the same guy. Pahaha.<br>  <br>  Uhm, I personally do not think the guy I like likes me because he does the hints to other girls. Like he offers help and his jacket to me but then will do it with another person. We have to face the fact that Matt may just be one of those rare species. You know the nice guy. But I also like to think of it as, HEY, he may like me if I showed how much I like him. Also don't buy into every little sign. I know when you have a crush signs are hard to see clearly. You think every thing that happens is a sign that he may or does like you.<br>  <br>  Meh. Play it off for now. I would anyways. How I like to think of it is "Hey, if he likes me he wil come to me" I mean I don't want a guy who has no balls. <br>  <br>  <br>  I am sorry that I used you to vent, but I hope it helped.<br>  <br>  Peace.
S3i3MYNtaa	roses are a tad...overrated as a first gift. she's probably been given them before and they wouldn't be anything "special" to her which is what you want. you could buy her a nice pair of earrings, or a really elegant silver or gold bracelet (depending on which she prefers...most women have a preference). these at least last and she'll have them forever.|`|xVEcaOveaa	roses are always a great gift....maybe even some type of unique jewelery or perfume :)|`|EkTaBfdcaa	roses.<br>  :]<br>  <br>  really.<br>  out of all the things i could have, i would want to be given roses.|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	She has probably been given roses many times. Rather than roses, I would give her a rose bush.|`|5tl1uLgVaa	Give her something heartfelt, forget material things they mean nothing. <br>  If you're talented in the arts & literature department write her a little note about how you feel about her and get her flowers. Google some flower types and find out the meanings behind them if you want :)<br>  or give her anything YOU think is strait from the heart.|`|7XSMjgroaa	Find out what she likes but has never really gotten. Maybe something that she really wanted from her child-hood that she never got. While you can never go wrong with roses, if she knows anything about the meaning of flowers, make sure you go with an orchid. It's the ultimate expression of love and romance.|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	roses are a beautiful gift, and if you dry them they will last for years :] but if your looking for something more... then i would say perfume. you can neverrrrr go wrong with a yummy smelling perfume! and plus, women can never have too much of it!|`|PgJqpbE2aa	Flowers...if she ever brought up a certain salon give her a gift card...a nice braclet, u can even go with a cute little wristlet ( usually girls like to take these out on dates instead of lugging a bag)...|`|P3ADxqJlaa	hmmmm....roses....or a card about love....maybe even a stuffed animal....

O31DgyGTaa	sorry, but DONT try reading Twilight. It's the msot arteficial and unromantic book I've read in a long time (no offence to all you twilight fans)<br>  <br>  Read the Mists of Avalon, i lveo taht story. It's about a woman who's not attractive, and she's in love with the most handsome man that anyones ever seen, and they get so close but then this other woman who's fair and naive shows up and the guy's fate is sealed, and he'd spend the rest of his life going after her. It's really very sad, but it's complicated. Morgaine, who's the original woman, ends up having a child with her half-brother (neither of them knew eachother) and the son grows up killing his father. You've probably heard it before, it's based on the legend of King Arthur but it's so much better!!!|`|UNhYZMoWaa	Try fanfiction.net or hey if Ms Meyer's can right a whole series of romance then anyone can even a skillful dog that can use a keyboard.|`|lheBbzNFaa	No, because I never been in love.|`|6JPiNGdfaa	tats my story|`|A7QROnjLaa	I met this hooker, and I was broke and down on my luck.

snBeIxpBaa	Good for her, sometimes it can be hard to resist peer pressure, society and other factors while holding onto your beliefs/morals.  I'm in the same boat as her.<br>  <br>  I'm a 21 virgin guy, waiting till marriage most likely, and some people think that is weird.  lol (considering I'm not overly religious) It is her life, let her live how she wants to... I agree with what you told her as well... giving into pressure is rarely ever a good thing to do.<br>  <br>  <br>  Kudos to her for her choice and kudos to you for supporting her decision.|`|YWjhqlxbaa	Well nothing's wrong with being a virgin at 22.<br>  <br>  She'll have sex when she's ready. And it's kind of sad that her friends are kind of pressuring her to have sex.|`|XXT7zcuCaa	I can fix it for her|`|AA11108018	I take my hat off to your friend there is reason for to lose her virginity until she is married.  I it  find hard to provide the right words as to she is a great woman|`|XGgPhaDbaa	I say Kudos for her. She is not letting anyone else talk her into doing something she doesn't want to do just to be popular. I wish more girls were as strong as her.
AA10334348	"Can I Australian kiss you? It's like a French kiss, only down under..."|`|H9Bzw0VNaa	be confident. :) best advice I can give u that has worked everytime with me and all of my girl friends....|`|EALy7X7Gaa	dont be too cocky, girls dont like that, act casual, make her feel special, compliment her, smile, and listen :)|`|VWvI5RyBaa	Is your avatar the way you present yourself?  If it is, forget the flirting tips for now, work on the expression on your face.  Okay, I'm just kidding.  Really, you don't need to be a flirt, being nice is the best way to go.  I know, I'm old, but I have experience and I have three children in their early teens.  It's quite simple, just be natural and honest when you give a compliment, don't overdo it though, be friendly, courteous(it still works) and smile.  Opening a door for a girl, pulling a chair, picking up something that fell, asking to bring some of her books if she has many.  It will all come naturally, just be nice, be yourself.<br>  <br>  If you knew all this, why are you asking?|`|P7mYy4CFaa	Any time you tell a girl she looks beautiful or pretty and then act casual after,, like dont make it dramatic works..|`|9KklyOcbaa	Give a lot of genuine, compliments ;)|`|oZ5QPymuaa	ok dude, just be urself. Dont try to be super ganster or super cool. be urself but kind of adjust urself to the girl so u r compatible. make sure u are nice and funny. joke about being mean.

haGMBfmPaa	the best solution to your problem would be to meet someone in real life that you can share feelings with.  i'm not trying to be mean i just would hate to see a young girl like yourself waste away your younger years pursuing love interests over the internet.  i'm sure there is someone at school or elsewhere in your life that you could have a great time meeting and enjoying life with!|`|63FZl3Lqaa	Uh... sorry this question is weird I mean "meeting some one over wow"... but I guess I have no right to say anything...<br>  <br>  so what exactly is your question? do you want us to tell you where he is or something? because there are lots of servers and over 10 million players we can't do much...|`|dvvQQ6eRaa	That's my brother!

Once they've been talking, leave them alone in the room together or something|`|HGl8ddWjaa	have one of ur Friends(girl) take that girl to play or do something like movies. Then u tell ur friend to go to the movies with you, you bump into them and leave them alone =D|`|uh5DlJzqaa	why dont you put them on a blind date with each other but tell them that that they know the person well or whatever just so they dont get the idea that your setting them up with a random person|`|rsAqrbsgaa	my dogs name is max!|`|YzCTq13caa	5 shots of Tequila.
dGBbFwFWaa	if u have feelings for him and he is dating someone at this time i think its best u try to avoid going out with him... keeping in touch by phone as friends is ok.. as long as u are aware he is just a friend at this time.. i say get to know him more learn what went wrong between u two.. and what u can do different if u  had another chance with this guy.. good luck
PK5Elowdaa	Man you got some F'd up friends. Obviously she doesnt care for you. Stop hanging out with her if this continues. You don't need friends like that.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Ew! What a terrible friend. I would tell her she needs to stop talking to him, or stop talking to you, thats extremely messed up.|`|ajgC0KPhaa	You should simply tell. It's nothing complicated.<br>  <br>  She doesn't seem to care about your feelings at all. You probably shouldn't be friends, especially if she doesn't listen to you.<br>  <br>  Reply to my question? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AinzwVQsVwT.H1baqD3FS9Xty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090212210557AAl3UEa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  .

If he comes just have a good time.|`|bcfd7b5ccba4d54bc635158d1fdd6dc9aa	Lie, blind fold him and tell him you're going to surprise him.

c630401eb9baa68dddde8641339b6a29aa	It really depends on the girl. Personally, I'd feel more comfortable if I'd known the guy for a month or two at least before hand. In person is definitely better - phone comes off looking kind of weak. I like boldness, just saying it, but there's a difference between being bold and being cocky. Don't be shy or half-ask her out, but don't act like an overly confident jerk.<br>  <br>  Finally, I always used to find those things important. I would think "I wouldn't go out with that guy because he dresses like that, or plays that video game all the time, or because his friends are really immature." Then I met my (now) ex boyfriend and even though he had a lot of hobbies I hated and friends I wasn't crazy about, I liked him so much I went for it and stopped caring what people thought. I think it's definitely a matter of the girl's maturity.|`|gmBzMFDLaa	how long you know the person doesnt matter at all.<br>  IN PERSON. shows your respect and your "courage" to ask in person.<br>  i think boldness is hot! but it depends on the girl, if shes shy, then be shy yourself so you dont scare her! (that would be the worst thing ever!)<br>  <br>  yes, the guy must be active (sports)<br>  must be intelligent.<br>  preferable not on drugs.<br>  he must be confident/have high self esteem.<br>  but respect girls.<br>  good personal hygiene<br>  clean clothes<br>  combed hair<br>  white teeth of course!<br>  <br>  oh.. and must be hot/handsome!<br>  (this is crucial, because this is the first impression you make on a girl, your outside looks)<br>  <br>  good luck! i hope this helps ya!|`|f17RMVa3aa	1. you at least have to have known her for a month so you know what you're getting yourself into. i knew my boyfriend 2 years before he got the guts to ask me out.<br>  <br>  2. in person<br>  <br>  3. boldness, you don't beat around the bush [like my boyfriend haha] and you just get to the point<br>  <br>  4. well you can't be playing video games all day and have your attention to only one thing and ditch me for that 24/7 and your friends wouldn't really matter to me unless they were like potheads or something like that but overall personality is more important.<br>  <br>  thats just me though :) answer mine please<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219222401AAqrwhq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|EkTaBfdcaa	honestly,<br>  just be yourself.<br>  <br>  in person i think is more preffered...<br>  <br>  and as of being confident or shy... just whatever you are.<br>  <br>  but it does help to have similar intrests, but again just be yourself :]<br>  <br>  and good luckman

But it could be that he didn't really wanted to be with his ex again, it was just the situation that made him do that. so what i would say i wait for it for a little while, but if nothing happens til then, then you should move on :).|`|7RbootLlaa	All you have to do is tell his girlfriend that you had sex with him and the chances of them breaking up is very good. Then when he comes running back to you, you can ask him,"Am I second choice?"<br>  <br>  He is a pratt, don't waste you're time with him.|`|PTFoPHk1aa	yeah your think is right, cause of naturally a man will have many criteria about a women.|`|zHVZAyY7aa	forget him<br>  i know those kind of guys<br>  and he will never change<br>  <br>  move on and fine another one|`|9R0RB465aa	WOW, i'm going through the same thing.

n2P9vD1eaa	Relationships have to be built on trust. Trust your boyfriend, not his best friend. You should even tell your bf that his supposed best friend is telling stories about him behind his back. But, if you want to believe him, maybe you shouldn't be in the relationship your in. You should think about that, and decide if maybe he has point, and you should leave your bf.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	it could be real or lies.<br>  Ask your boyfriend the truth. Say to him did you cheat on me?<br>  Ask your bf bestie to give you details. like when it happen. or who maybe?/.<br>  <br>  So then you have something else to say to your boyfriend about it if he deny's then. he will think about it twice.<br>  <br>  it sounds to me like he was lying to try get to you...<br>  <br>  god Bless x Your bf will tell you|`|M7r7gHNGaa	You should decide who you trust more, your boyfriend or his friend. Personally,  I  believe you nailed it yourself in your last paragraph.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	Talk to your boyfriend.  Tell him everything that his friend told you.  Not in an accusatory way but in a "can you believe what he's doing?" way.  Watch for your boyfriends response about his cheating and go from there.|`|AdFucadgaa	His not consider as a best friend then. Talk to your boyfreind, you should know better than him. Why would you be affected of what his talking when you know exactly that his lying.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	jealous little twat|`|9fpJSgsbaa	Your boyfriend needs to know what a grub his best mate is, he may be telling the truth or maybe not but he definitely sounds like a snake in the grass.|`|X9GkF5d1aa	its a lie-big a** lie...if you havent told your boyfriend what his bestfriends been saying to you then thats really messed up..you should really be upfront with him...because if his bestfriend is saying that to you then hes not really his friend guys have a thing with eatchothers girls off limits.. same with exs off limits its a guy thing...so ur b/f's bestfriend is prettty much a scumbag who if you got together with would treat you like sh*t.|`|PTFoPHk1aa	Its right that, but before you make decision, try to give any research for confirm the problem, do you know that the truth is relative its depend on the situation.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	all boyfriend's best friends tell their best friend's girfriends that the boyfriend cheated. Thats a dirty little snake and you will be considered as low as him if you hook up with him....dont believe the hype.|`|0N0ExMMAaa	i would confront your bf and find out who it was with if the other guy knows then ask the other chick if it's true. but just from what was said he is most likely lieing so you would date him.|`|nYswXPaRaa	Why don't you just directly ask your boyfriend? You're never going to find out if you don't ask him since your boyfriend's best friend is just going to lie to you.|`|07HWkV4eaa	You answered your own question when you said he lies all the time. Dump the loser.|`|zmab07Giaa	sounds like he wants to get in your pants|`|TxBXVL6caa	Try and get more evidence.
bC5XeVEIaa	Curvy. Very curvy.
K7Rqrpesaa	Personally... I just don't PLAY. I don't flirt with guys, don't treat them as anything else but a friend. If they want to make a play for me, they can have at it, I'm just not into the whole flirting thing. <br>  You could go the whole cold shoulder route... but playing hard to get is just a vicious circle a lot of times, it comes back and bites yah in the butt. (i.e. "you liked ME?! I had no clue! You always acted so indifferent!")|`|5nmFtzgqaa	Basically act as if you're uninterested or really nonchalant.<br>  A lot of the time it backfires though, you might want to try a different tactic.|`|a7Iqk7Yhaa	When you play "hard to get" its basically pretending to not be interested in a guy/girl when you actually are.<br>  <br>  Its supposed to leave them running for you, but in my experience it never works. It only leaves them thinking you are un-interested and they move on|`|RdITBrwIaa	hun, i dont play. I am. :D<br>  <br>  but I guess just try not to look too much at a guy and not flirt with him as easily
zbl29wXSaa	Aw, that's cute. So your faces touch but never your lips? Um well when your cheeks are touching you could just press your lips to his and see how he reacts to that. If hes been with you for that long and he's super shy then I'm sure he wants to kiss you too. If you press you lips against his maybe he will go keeper into the kiss :)|`|WlAPb2nfaa	Well i had that problem at 15 I'm 17 now what i did was the i guess slower way we build this sort of trust we waited two months not like decision we just did? and one day we just kissed if his still shy give him time too! they wont be shy forever trust me!|`|Ncb7WoB3aa	you should just go for it :D mainly because at your age the guy is usually the shyer one. im 17 if it doesnt work out for you add me on myspace maybe we can work something out ;D<br>  <br>  myspace.com/icedragon92

Tell her that she is cool but you are not interested in her. Tell your cousin to stop playing match maker. If you cousin doesn't learn to be honest with her own friend and leave you alone, you may want to stop communications with your cousin for a while. Just until she gets the point.|`|RGG30rbkaa	Go out with someone else ... Or is that too harsh ... Think about it?!|`|USzwsA0Waa	be blunt|`|psB5SKjbaa	you should just tell her straight out "I don't like you...so leave me alone"...<br>  <br>  <br>  =)

xXGn1zfsaa	Yes, sex is exercise.<br>  <br>  Generally, when you do exercise, you work your muscles.<br>  Often with sex, you work muscles you didn't even know you had.<br>  It's normal.|`|uJ9waJDYaa	Yeah, well if you were at it for about an hour then you are probably just sore from the actions of it like from moving your muscles etc.<br>  Just stretch your legs gently, and the pains should be gone in a day or two. Just like when you go for a really intense run then the next day your legs/muscles are sore|`|Ii5udGmJaa	don't worry about it.<br>  that is very natural to feel sore. So don't sweat it.<br>  just start worrying if she gets pregnant. Then that'ss acompletelyly different can of worms you have to worry about.|`|4vLt3SqFaa	For her that is a long time for the first time.  so sure she is sore.  You worked real hard for a long time so you should feel like you really worked out at the gym.<br>  <br>  You both will get better with time - sounds completely normal
4Ovf0Gr8aa	well i'm gunna start saying you cannot make someone love you, once it's gone, it's hard to get back if one person keeps pushing the other<br>  <br>  what you gotta do is.. act like a friend to him.. don't act like you are sad, frustrated or anything. don't let things get to you... he will see you are more mature about the situation and maybe want to start talking again..that seirously is the only way.<br>  show him that you can be strong|`|NbUwThM4aa	try a sassy haircut!
jgF8NC8qaa	yea if she doznt talk or take action or try to communicate it prob means shes promiscuous or sum bs like that,<br>  hey id still hit it if she waz beautiful.<br>  but really i like girls with high self esteem, and im not talking about striaght up ***** status<br>  A girl that has a brain with a dope personality<br>  But yea im not gona sugar coat my truth thats what i think|`|52otNiElaa	Well if there wasn't any i contact i'd think she's a *****.|`|AFGxrXSyaa	how is that desperate?? its just eye contact.....|`|g2JqGIOCaa	No.<br>  <br>  But eye contact is not a clear way to convey that you are interested.  SPEAK UP or leave a note.|`|teEJOOOHaa	nope. because you see...not all girls are that obvoius on how they feel to a guy. instead they just stay in a corner and wait. that's all
U5A8JQ1paa	just ask her|`|xVEcaOveaa	maybe she knew right away that you guys weren't compatible so she decided to end it because she didn't want to be in a situation that she knew wasn't going to end up anywhere.
TkNgWS4Naa	Awh.....<br>  Well if you do hook up with her soon it will be during the rebound phase and that can be both good and bad I just want you to be aware that she might replace her hurt with dating you which is good for you but not healthy for her.  <br>  You could remind her that you're always here for her when she needs someone and then be around her a lot to show other guys that she's "yours" <br>  Definitely make her cupcakes or something to make her smile and when you say"i made it for you" she'll totally flip and maybe realize you're the nicest person in her life right now.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps
uh5DlJzqaa	If i were you i would test the waters you may be very surprised with the outcome<br>  <br>  that happened to a friend of mine and he tried things with a girl(relationship and sex) and he was so he said gay and after 6 months of dating he is completely straight now.<br>  <br>  thought just see what its like for you and decide the outcome, it cant hurt to try right?|`|AA10962298	Just do It!|`|3QSiLT2baa	It's normal believe it or not. It's a confusing age.|`|O31DgyGTaa	Most people your age are probaby confused about these things, but I think you should just do what you feel. Or if you're not sure, wait and see. Thing's will become clear to you eventually.|`|KaMI67V4aa	oh kinky... i like it... nyahahaha...|`|CIKr28xoaa	admit it you're a lez
dqeR7BJlaa	She obviously has a problem. Attention whore... idk whatever. I personally would tell her on one of your rides back to her car that this is the last time you will be doing this for her. If she still parks over there tell her you warned her and she will have to walk. I understand you're attracted to her, I have a girlfriend and have been dating her for 3 years. I love her to death but obviously find other people attractive. I find cheaters to be scum as well, what I do is just completely ignore the women I find attractive. Simply don't talk to them, unless I have to for business. If she doesn't get the hint then she deserves to get raped. Woman like that are the reason honest decent men fall into the trap of cheating. In other words, politely tell her to F off|`|TDGhHIvNaa	Maybe you should ask someone else from class to join you so that you are not alone.|`|U8VGvgC1aa	Well, you have to trust yourself, and if you love your gf as much as you say you do then it shouldn't be a problem. But having "thoughts" about other people is completely normal. Just leave them at that-thoughts. Also, I suggest trying everything in your power to bring back some passion to your relationship, if all is well at home, then you won't even think about straying.|`|XSXLWN1yaa	my advice is  stay away from that chick and ignore her. spent more time with your girlfriend, memorize all then sweet memories between u n her, n remember how much u love her and the most important thing is  how u met each other. the truth about relationship is honesty , sincerity's love and be loved.do u know how hurt when u find ur couple cheating? i experience once, it's hurt, when 8 years r'ship just gone like that., so i dun  want ur gf feel what i had feel. so stay away from that chick . in r'ship sincereness is more important than  physically attract.
ipRPrvzxaa	is this a serious question?
Smg9AjdXaa	time is your only solution. don't think too much about them. they're his ex-'s for a reason you know? he's with you now and that's all that matters. you should trust your boyfriend and let go of his past cause that could ruin your future together. just spend more time with your boyfriend and you'll think less about them and more of you and him<br>  <br>  hoped this helped =]|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	not really. im suffering with the same problem and people say well its the past and blah blah and hes with you now and thats all that matters but that doesnt get rid of the thoughts or anything it doesnt help at all. hopefully with time it will go away other than that sorry im no help|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	He is with you not her.  If he wanted to still be with her, he would still be with her.  Tell your boyfriend how you feel but be prepared that he may not like insecure females.|`|kKsPYFSgaa	The past is done. I kinda went what you went through but you have to realize that you cant change that. Now its your chance. Prove to him that your the better girl. Make use of the time you have with him and stop focusing on his past and ex girlfriends and instead try to be yourself and be the greatest GF you can be. You never know how that will end up.|`|hd442Ha5aa	You have to realize that he is over them and now with you. That was in the past and you shouldn't focus so much on that; it'll lower your self esteem and trust with him and end up ruining your relationship. They obviously did something to not make him interested in them, so be proud that he likes you.|`|054bfce8ce5933a083f96a2cc71caf09aa	Yes. Just picture the good times you and your bf had together instead of those two. And stop it because if you don't your bf would get mad or weirded out.|`|ipRPrvzxaa	it will get better once you guys have been together longer than he was with his ex|`|UzEuM5Mmaa	I was kind of in the same situation.. my bf had sex with his ex girlfriend and that was his first time... and I can't stop thinking about that. and how he didn't wait for me.. and even though I wasn't ready and we weren't dating at the time it just won't get out of my mind. I get sad when I think about it.. cause I really care about him and It bothers me to think that another girl had him and pleasured him.. sometimes it makes me mad. Just try to get it out of your head, that;s what I try to do. Just think of the fact that he's yours now.|`|pFjgBBUZaa	well for a start, start picturing yourself with your bf not the ex. also the ex is has been and your the future so don't mess it. using imagination is good, but here i think you should just let it be and enjoy your life with your bf :).|`|48HKDSR0aa	You need to think this way.<br>  <br>  Why are they his EX girlfriends, not current?<br>  you are his current girlfriend, and if you keep thinking about the ex-gfs, you may be one soon! so stop|`|07HWkV4eaa	You need to talk to him about this.|`|Bd47h6Ovaa	No its good. Shows that you care.<br>  <br>  Convince him to ditch the pictures. Both of you will be better off for it|`|zMkQvxLraa	if he wanted to be with her he wouldn't be with you. that's what i always think when i get thoughts like that. :)|`|RBrQMBY2aa	you need to do the things you think of him doing with his ex|`|7UDvZfVkaa	as we get older your going to have to get used to people having ex's cuz well.. the older your are it will be harder to date someone who hasnt had an ex. <br>  now think, your boyfriend is with YOU<br>  thats why he is YOUR boyfriend<br>  obviously there was something that caused all his other relationships to not work out and now he's with YOU<br>  and the other girls dont have him and YOU do<br>  basically you just gotta stop looking at the negative and try to look at the positive<br>  if you keep this up it might even drive him away<br>  and you dont want that right?<br>  so just stop and chill and relax
NxHExauOaa	Good sign. Flirt with her a little bit in class! <br>  <br>  I bet she doesn't know if you are interested in her, or just want company in a work related way... <br>  <br>  Girls really enjoy flirting and developing some kind of connection before they actually go out with a guy|`|cj8iM1Olaa	She probably doesn't see it as a date. She sees it as work.|`|s41monvEaa	yikes i doubt it. usually girls try to make you feel better by prepping you up and getting you excited. but who knows i could be wrong and she could just be making sure nothing else will go on that day. high school girls have a busy schedule.
ymqRux3xaa	Are you a guy?<br>  <br>  Stop talking. You'll probably just screw it up. Use body language. Tilt your chin up. Put your hands on your hips or behind your back. Make yourself look approachable. Smile. Wink. Touch the small of her back or touch her arm. Touch the back of her hand with one finger. Smile.<br>  <br>  Ok. Now you can talk. Tell her she's cute but you already have a dog. Smile. It's that simple. Have fun!
rTaaIXSuaa	Teenagers will say yes.<br>  Mothers and fathers say no. <br>  What does the law say?|`|cOConVpXaa	yeah!<br>  i've  been with the same guy since i was 14 and he's 4 years older than me.<br>  <br>  if it's right, then it's right!|`|x7SsiIZOaa	If there happy sure
DWwv3v9Raa	Say something nice about her, always compliment her.|`|P3ADxqJlaa	Try talking to her again...Say "Hey...So I know were both shy but wanna be friends" and if she doesnt know ur name then say "Im so and so...by the way" If she thinks ur a complete retard then say well nice talking to u...then walk away. If she likes u then compliment her. Like "I like your shirt. Ur hair is pretty. I noticed u like to flip it a lot and thats cool"|`|etuPowvoaa	Well, it's always best to just come clean. I had trouble talking to this one boy in 7th grade, so what I did was make up cute little arguments to start a conversation. You might need to get to know her more if you don't know her like that. Start talking about random things. But not to random. for example, don't talk about the weather. (I don't think you would do that anyway.)  If there is a break coming or a weekend, ask her what she's going to do for the weekend or break. Always flash a smile at her. After you get to know her a little bit more come clean and tell her how you feel. Remember, everything happens for a reason.<br>  =]|`|qpAl6EGTaa	ok kid you are in 7th grade you don't need too brake the ice you are still a kid next week you will probaly like a different girl|`|1neMZoRLaa	Grow some balls<br>  <br>  ask her out|`|RBrQMBY2aa	wait till high school|`|iAE6VNwWaa	well if you have phones u could text her and talk to her the next day, then you'll feel a little lesss nervous maybe if you've talked to her before.<br>  <br>  you could ask her a question about the assignment and start a convo from that.<br>  <br>  you could compliment her ?. that ones the nicest, i perfer that one<br>  <br>  you could ask her out, thats nice. but first maybe find out who she likes from one of her friends or something, or ask her yourself.<br>  <br>  hope i helped. good luck|`|wFXvYc5kaa	Fart in front of her (:|`|AvERZv04aa	why are you worrying about this <br>  in 7th grade. my gawd.
QgxCbEk5aa	Definitely  wait to see his response. And if he agrees to have sex with you, then you know for sure he's just into booty calls. However if he disagrees you know you have a good guy. If he questions you, then let him know you're serious and if he agrees, then again you know he's just into sex. Good luck, but don't text him saying its just a joke. WAIT FOR HIS REPLY.. ;)|`|EkTaBfdcaa	yeah.<br>  he probably wants you for sex.<br>  <br>  and honestly, girl, you can find someone soooo much better,<br>  <br>  say goodbye to his sorry ***!<br>  <br>  you deserve sooo much more|`|RBrQMBY2aa	off and on with an ex is never a good thing<br>  <br>  get back together with him or just be friends|`|YZddsudlaa	sounds like your plan b drop him move on you deserve better|`|07HWkV4eaa	My God is this what damn English has come too?|`|dw440Lylaa	He wasn't joking,....... if you'd said yes to sex, you'd officially be a FWB<br>  <br>  Yes, he's planning to use you for sex.<br>  <br>  Find someone who actually cares for you, not just your body.<br>  <br>  Sorry<br>  <br>  <br>  Luck|`|LguXFbvsaa	Wow. Everything you are doing is wrong. EVERYTHING. I am going to be very honest, and I am not trying to sound rude or hurtful...<br>  <br>  You are coming across as utterly desperate. He can say whatever he wants to you, he knows it confuses you, but you simply cling to whatever he says that sounds positive. It's very silly and unattractive. Men want an independent woman with her own life and happiness. No one wants to be the center of another person's world... it's too much pressure. You haven't even been together for a year and you've already been breaking up? That's not a relationship at all - that's messing around and giving it a title in an attempt to legitimize things. <br>  <br>  You are not over-reacting. He's not interested in you, and you know it - that's why you're writing on this question thing. He's not excited when he texts you back because he assumes either you're not going to have sex, or if you do it's going to have to be a big, emotional ordeal. Do not see him any more - ignore him completely. It's the only sort of treatment he deserves. Seriously. I have been in his shoes before. He won't care how you feel.<br>  <br>  Don't be naive and let your emotions cloud your logic!!|`|iEJTAVP3aa	you should compeletly ignore him for a while,<br>  so he gets confused and wants you back full time.<br>  and if he asks why your ignoring him, say i was just joking!|`|dffe3d0533cae84e9ffacb6c6b597350aa	<a href="http://milkysharts.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://milkysharts.blogspot.com/</a>|`|xNxyStuvaa	hes using u,|`|wsvkYamfaa	Okay first of all if yall cant keep a steady relationship this it prolly isnt meant to be.They are called ex for a reason!Besides if he ignores u that should tell u that ur just wasting ur time because if he cared he wouldnt.Oh and the sex thing when he asked he was prolly being serious until he found out that it wasnt cool with you then he acted like it was just a joke.When u asked him to hang out and all he said was k well thats just a guy for you or maybe he was busy and didnt have time to text a long answer so dont freak out about stuff like that.You shouldnt joke about havin sex because he might take u seriously an think thats what u want!Anyway i wouldnt bother with him because he sounds kinda like a jerk!!
dqeR7BJlaa	Cut back on sex toys
cqMULVB9aa	Lol, it's funny i hate it when that happens. Reminds me of a time not too long ago. This girl in my school, that I knew liked me because she always smiled and stared at me everytime we walked down the hallway. I didn't even really know her, but decided to go talk to her since it was getting weird with her just staring and smiling at me all the time. BAD IDEA, well just that time cuz it ended in a super akward silence. Haha, she still digs me too. Well, here's some words of advice. It's not that big of a deal, just be yourself. You can do it online when you don't actually see each other so do it in real life, duh. Just let go, what's the worst that can happen?|`|VSPD4Ynpaa	Try talking to him frankly. Don't go in deep points but just talk generally. don't go nervous or it will waste ur plans.|`|f17RMVa3aa	talking online first totally helps but JUST talking online means that you guys would be kinda weird going out, not gonna lie.<br>  <br>  just go up to him and be like hey and maybe bring up something you guys talked about online and take it from there don't plan things out just go with the flow<br>  <br>  answer mine please :)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090219222401AAqrwhq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|EkTaBfdcaa	just be yourself!<br>  <br>  ...and you can even tell him, im only good at talking online, and laugh it off! <br>  :]<br>  <br>  just be as confident as you are comfortable being. :]<br>  <br>  and good luck!
tKtBX18Zaa	Sounds like you are pretty young and unfortunately things like that happen when you are young. And guys are more immature than girls in general. But, the good news is that you will get over it if he is not the right one for you, trust me, and you will find someone else and this will seem like a minute problem.|`|EPe2p55Eaa	stay with me :)|`|SzsrajV4aa	Confront him about it and see each other more.|`|YzCTq13caa	lamo!!! Your f*cked and I'm glad! Kiss that realationship good-by toots. :)<br>  <br>  edit:Jones. lol. P*ssy.|`|8FiJ5i81aa	give it up more. do something kinda different to change things up. umm try chocolate body paint. hell go on a mini vacation together. or just tell him what u think.|`|TDJsIjfyaa	He is going going GONE !|`|pcI25NXzaa	You could just try hanging out. Or seeing if he feels the same way?<br>  <br>  Just try to make time to hang out, if it feels weird when you hang out then say something. Sometimes people have other things to do, it's not like you have to see your bf every day. not trying to be a jerk, just saying.|`|3QSiLT2baa	Any free time you have on your hands should be spent with him. Try to get back close together. It sounds like it's going really well so it'd be pretty sad to drift apart now..|`|xPpwIzh8aa	if you love him and he loves you, do anything and everything to make it work, tell him how you feel and ask yourself do you really want to be with him =]<br>  <br>  hope i help =PP|`|07HWkV4eaa	Maybe you'll both drift right off the face of the planet.|`|PK5Elowdaa	Remember this, " RELATIONSHIPS DOESN'T DIE FROM NATURAL DEATH. IT DIES BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO REPLENISH ITS SOURCE "|`|MPOHHTtAaa	Do something together! Just the two of you! And then talk about it afterwards!|`|wJGJUVswaa	good dump the loser|`|McfrauFnaa	it's called life it happens you know? it's not the end of the damn world....
DuR26Pojaa	Never underestimate a court's power to take away EVERYTHING in a divorce. It depends on what state you're in and what led to the divorce. If she claims abuse or infidelity, you're screwed. If she ever contributed money to payments on the car, she might have leverage to try and take it. Get a good attorney, be aggressive in your case, and take nothing for granted until the judge's gavel comes down.|`|H652tDkyaa	CUT IT IN HALF SHE WANTS HALF GIVE HER HALF A CAR|`|qw7BmBq6aa	You'll probably end up having to give it to her.  Especially if you cheated on her, then you're def screwed.  But then again, she'd deserve all the belongings if thats what happened :P|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	If you're in a community property state all assets and debts will be split 50/50 during the divorce. If she has a vehicle, its not likely the judge will give yours to her, however if she doesn't have a vehicle then its likely the judge may require you to sell it and split the money. It all depends on the specifics in the marriage. Most judges can see when a spouse is just trying to be spiteful when they're asking for things in a divorce, and they don't usually allow such behavior.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	In my state, the man is legally obligated to provide his estranged (or divorced) wife with a running vehicle, if they have children.  It's bad news.<br>  <br>  You need to check your state laws before you make any decisions.|`|9lZdDU2Vaa	She has the the power to share all the property until you  divorce her legally|`|YQqkTBhbaa	if its in your name no she cant..she trys to get it tho..call the cops on her *** get her for theft of property
uJ9waJDYaa	They can see that you are comfortable with your self. They are either jealous and trying to bring you down, or just bringing you down cos they think you are less than them, which you most likely are not. <br>  Please, just ignore them. After a while they will just forget you and things will be fine, but if you show you are paying attention to them they will feed of that and do it more and may do more things to makes you feel bad and etc.<br>  You are above them so just ignore them.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|5pGfmlxcaa	thier jelouse let them be|`|kWdlfnQqaa	dont worry they are just jealouse cuz your hotter than them... you seem like a good person so just ignore them|`|f17RMVa3aa	i bet you're an amazing person and really gorgeous.<br>  <br>  they're jealous bitches so ignore them and do what you are doing, schoolwork, because when you become all famous those girls won't matter at all :)|`|R6WHaxP2aa	Ignore them|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Nothing. They are just jealous|`|0DdSoi4Maa	Yup, they're jealous... they're intimated by you & are afraid you're going to get all the guys you want b/c you're a pretty girl & you have a lot going for you besides that.  They see how the guys react to you & they want the attention to be on them, not taken' away from them & go to some new girl. It won't be the last time girls do that to you so get used to it.  You don't need people like that in your life.  They just get pleasure from it for some reason.  They want you to say something & don't give in.  It's best when you ignore them & not give them what they want b/c then they become more pissed off & more jealous & let em, it's great.  You have what they want when they should just be happy with themselves.  I usually just be nice to them & if they do say something you know it aint true.  Guys don't like getting involved with drama queens.|`|coa3oXMXaa	These girls are obviously just petty, insecure, and jealous. They need someone who is pretty to talk about to feel better about themselves. Just ignore them, and if things get out of hand tell an authority figure, or try telling them to cool it. Good luck! And remember: who gives a damn about what people think of you? :)|`|4bAZW3F6aa	ok a quote from a friend "bitches be crazy" but i digress, you have haters, which really means they envy your swag and wana be like you, but cant "the hater" next time you see them hating on you just smile and wave do your thing, you gota love the hating =]|`|lheBbzNFaa	They are drama queens, stay away from them.|`|AT4erlHzaa	their jealous.... i wouldnt even conversant with them just worry about yourself|`|0QUFjLmcaa	Ignore those ********** they're jealous of you
