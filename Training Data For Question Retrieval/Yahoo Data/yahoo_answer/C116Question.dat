He worked for 2 weeks and once he got the second check he hasn't been back. That was on Oct. 8th. I have tried to call, leave voice mails....Still nothing. I sent an email this week in which he finally replied and said that he would be back today and tomorrow to finish the work. The job that he's done is pitiful. This was an insurance claim so he did not charge me my deductable and he figured in the replacement of my hot water heater so it wouldn't cost me anything. Will this affect me when I take him to court?

Sie sollen in einem Ermittlungsverfahren gegen Nutzer des Forums herangezogen werden.        Beschuldigt werden die Nutzer der "Volksverhetzung" und Billigung von Straftaten, weil sie einen Vorfall am 5. September zum Teil mit Verst?ndnis kommentiert hatten. Eine 46-j?hrige Erwerbslose hatte an diesem Tag zwei Mitarbeiter des Jobcenters mit der Waffe bedroht und als Geiseln genommen. Nach knapp zwei Stunden war die Aktion unblutig beendet worden. Beispielsweise hatte sich ein Nutzer gefragt: "Was mich dabei wundert: Wieso kommt das nicht ?fter vor?"

Daschle, nominated to be secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, did not pay more than $128,000 in taxes over three years, a revelation that poses a potential obstacle to his Senate confirmation.      The back taxes, along with $12,000 in interest and penalties, involved unreported consulting fees, questionable charitable contributions, and a car and driver provided by a private equity firm run by entrepreneur and longtime Democratic Party donor Leo J. Hindery Jr., according to a confidential draft report prepared by Senate Finance Committee staff.      A spokeswoman for Daschle confirmed last night that he recently paid back taxes in excess of $100,000. She said that Daschle, a former Senate majority leader, and his accountant discovered the error regarding the luxury car service and reported it to the committee after his vetting was completed.      Daschle paid the back taxes six days before his first Senate confirmation hearing with the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. The Finance Committee, however, has jurisdiction over his nomination.

20090131084228AAfPmIy	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Where and why are all the jobs gone?	Obama facing dilemma over protectionism in bill      WASHINGTON -- Less than two weeks into office, President Barack Obama faces a dilemma over protectionist provisions in a massive economic stimulus bill: Backing the measures could set off a trade war, while opposing them could trigger a backlash from his supporters.      The choice involves "buy American" provisions attached to White House-backed stimulus legislation moving through Congress. They would require major public works projects to favor U.S. steel, iron and manufacturing over imports.      Some Democratic lawmakers and interest groups allied to the president support the measures, but international allies and trading partners are warning that favoring U.S. companies would breach U.S. trade commitments and could set off tit-for-tat countermeasures around the world.       I found this interesting as I was pondering why so many Americans are unemployed and facing unemployment in the near future.      After I finished my cup of coffee I looked on the bottom of the cup to see that the PFALTZGRAFF cup was made in China.      Since the Chinese have been buying the debt that the US is continually incurring to grow the government how long will future US workers have to work to pay off the debt. How many years of work before they expect to retire, and what kinds of jobs lay ahead for our children and grand children?

20090131102738AAHSrYF	Politics & Government;Elections	Obama tries to work w/GOP to create bipartisan earmarks, mimimize pork in stimulus..but they keep playing poli?	I am sure many of you noticed that Obama changed a lot of things, now many are calling him a liar, but the fact of the matter is he HAD to change things because GOP refuses to work with him, probably on purpose just so Obama WOULD have to change things and they could make him look like a liar/bad. For instance Obama said he would not hire lobbyist, but must do it now because GOP is doing so much damage that he needs help to repair it. There is a huge difference between lying and protecting your own interests. If Obama COULD work with the GOP in a bipartisan way to create a plan with less pork, he would do it. But the GOP cannot continue to play politics and then accuse the DNC of shutting them out of the process when the DNC clearly has no other choice.

Rush Limbaugh said two days ago in this article:        http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12331890...       that recessions will end on their own, and that government tampering worsens them.       With the collapse of the job market in the Great Depression, it seemed that working on infrastructure made jobs, which made people money.

20090131110429AApjxd4	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Do I have a case here?	So here's the situation. I was at a party on a friday night and there was a guy there who was trying to hit on my friend. He tells her she "owes [him] a kiss." She gets a little worried, and she comes over and sits next to me. Ten minutes later, the guy comes over and grabs her hand and tries to say something and I caught the phrase "kiss" and my friend starts looking at me for some kind of help. So I looked at the guy and I said "Hey man, leave her alone, she's with me" he says some stuff and he's still holding on to her hand, so I grab her hand and give it back to her and put my hand on his stomach (lightly) to kind of stop him from leaning over (my friend and I were sitting on a couch, and the guy was towering over us.)      He smacks my hand away and says "touch me again and i'll break your f**king face", to which I said "right, but you touch her again and i'll break your face first." Next thing I know he smacks me twice (I was intoxicated and I didn't feel a thing, so I couldn't fight back. I was also sitting down, and was not expecting that swing AT all.)  and takes his shirt off for a fight, while at the same time, about 15 people come in between us to break it up. I was taken to the sink to clean myself up, because my lip was cut in about two spots on the outside, and there were a few interior cuts and bruises as well. My nose didn't break, but it was extremely tender. I clean up (still can't feel a thing) and go to clear things up, but it gets broken up and he leaves, but before he leaves he starts acting rude to about five other girls there, and says something about him being a "pimp" and how "girls fall for [him]."      I looked up some stuff online, and this scenario seems like an Assault and Battery towards me from him. As well as a Sexual Assault towards my friend. But I don't know for sure, I don't even know if I should go to a lawyer or the cops, because remember after he said he'd "break" my face, I said the same thing back to him, but in a defending way, so that he would stay away from my friend. But, I never took a swing at the guy, or threatened to kill the guy like he did to me.      Please, help me out here. Do I have a case? Or should I just drop it?       P.S: I wouldn't go after the guy for money. After he left, my friends told me he's always looking for a fight, and he does this kind of thing every weekend with someone new. So, I really just want to put a stop to his maniacal acts.      P.P.S: If I was to press charges, how do lawyers charge for these types of cases? By the hour? or a percentage of the "damages" money.

Obama i think, is a complete inexperienced idiot.  all he talks about is the economy and how hes going to get america back on its feet. but what about if a war breaks out? what the **** is this idiot, that majority of you people elected, going to do? he just seems clueless. mccain seems to be much smarter in areas when it comes to talking about protecting Americans, the economy, and all that other **** that goes along with it. yeah i know that im black and you people think that i problably should be rooting for obama because he's black also, but i do not give a ****. who ever reads this question, tell me what you think.

Once outside the store, he asked for proof of ID because he looked like a wanted criminal. Once he proved that he was not, indeed, the wanted criminal, the officer asked why he was in this town and not the town his ID was from (just moved here to start student teaching at the local HS). I guess I thought you had to commit a crime before you could be asked to prove yourself... Searched local bench warrants, no criminal with the name the officer gave was in there..checked the most wanted with the pictures, no criminal by that name. What is going on? Was that legal?

(Reuters)—"The U.S. government’s latest bank rescue, this time a multi-billion dollar lifeline handed to Bank of America, has led to more talk of what once would have been unthinkable—European-style nationalization of major American banks.      Few see the government nationalizing the entire banking system the way Sweden did in the 1990s, but the U.S. is growing more willing to put significant pressure on the largest banks."       http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/busine...       "“Well, whatever you want to call it,” said Ms. Pelosi, Democrat of California. “If we are strengthening them, then the American people should get some of the upside of that strengthening.

Wouldnt it be better if the government used the stimulus money to help sustain small and midsized businesses that up until the crash of the stock market were showing reasonable profitability? They were obviously doing something right to be in that position...and it was only the stock market crash and freezing of their credit lines that have made it impossible for them to retain all their employees. Wouldn't it be better to make people's jobs secure? That is the reason that people have stopped spending. They are scared. They see all the lay offs and are afraid that they might be next in line. Let the government guarantee the viability of those once profitable companies. Not give them huge bailouts to do anything new...but to just give them enough so they can retain employees and continue to pay reasonable salaries. Then people's confidence will return and they will start spending more freely.

But the substitute saw me and said,"You, yes you, pick that up" After that I picked up the eraser and Jacob was laughing at me because I got in trouble. I sat back down to my desk and everyone was looking at me like, "OMG! I can't believe she did that! She's always shy and quiet!" (which is not true) Then I watched the substitute write something that she will tell my 4th period teacher, and I think she wrote me down! Any bad comments will get an automatic TWO HOUR detention. After class, I put a note on her desk when she wasn't looking and it said,"I'm sorry I threw the eraser." I was SO scared! I don't know if I'm gonna get a detention or not and it's a REFERRAL! I've never gotten in trouble like this in my life! I wasn't fooling around! What should I do?!?! If I got a detention and told my parents they won't let me do anything for the rest of my life! I'm stressing out and I have trouble sleeping thinking my teacher will get mad at me..         Oh and I don't know why this is in law enforcements or whatever..

20090131115145AAlk8b2	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Have you noticed a noticeable lack of menthol in your menthol cigarettes?	I believe it was last summer that I received an "alert" email from Lorillard (Newport) that stated congress wanted to ban menthol cigarettes, specifically, they wanted to ban any "flavoring" of cigarettes and supposedly menthol is considered a flavoring. I smoke Newport and My husband smokes Marlboro and I've noticed with the last few packs of my cigarettes that they now taste much more like his--"non-menthol". Since I never heard anything further about the proposed ban, I'm wondering, was it passed? Or, are they just forcing cigarette companies to gradually reduce menthol from their cigarettes, kind of sneakily, without telling us? Wouldn't surprise me.      .(I had no idea which category this Q should be in, so please excuse me if it's in the wrong one :) )

20090131131256AAmFwvo	Politics & Government;Military	Questions about commissioning as U.S. Army officer?	I have a couple of questions regarding which path may be the best way to achieve becoming an Army officer. First, let me explain that I'm currently enlisted and have served only 6 months. I feel that I am scholastically competitive having 95 credit hours accrued with a 3.85 cumulative GPA, I scored a 98 overall on the ASVAB with a 135 GT score. Physically I'm average, scoring only a 230 on my last APFT (personal training time and motivation has made that improve though) and I have a squeaky clean criminal record. I currently have a SECRET clearance for my MOS and I'm 22 years old.    My question is, should I attempt to go Green to Gold Active Duty Option or put my OCS packet in? Most of my LT's have recommended Green to Gold, but they've all commissioned via ROTC. I also understand there's a requirement of serving 2 years active duty before even getting Green to Gold -- would that be waiverable though?  If anyone who has been through or heard a similar situation can shed some light as to which direction I should go I would certainly appreciate any input!

20081015194537AAMrYFf	Politics & Government;Elections	Was it appropriate for McCain to mock the notion of protecting the health & well-being of pregnant women?	Obama stated that he absolutely DOES oppose late term and "partial birth" abortions, but that exceptions ought to be made for cases when the compromised health of the mother takes precedence.      And McCain made fun of him for it.  McCain brushed it off, saying "Again, another example of Obama's eloquence. The "health" of the mother, you know, that's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything".      So... what he's saying... is that he doesn't think we ought to take into consideration the possibility that women MAY ACTUALLY DIE due to childbirth complications, and that, rarely, pregnancies must be terminated for the sake of the woman's life?      I mean, honestly, he put air-quotes around the word "health" during the debate.  He air-quoted when referring to making life-saving exceptions for ALL pregnant women in the United States.      Is that indicative of how much he "cares" (with quotation marks!) about women's safety?  Is he of the opinion that women are nothing more than portable incubators who deserve absolutely no reproductive rights whatsoever?  To McCain, are women nothing more than potential baby-factories whose well-being can be mocked with the flippancy he demonstrated tonight?

Bell, authorized warrantless electronic surveillance used in the conviction of two men for spying on behalf of Vietnam.       The men, Truong Dinh Hung and Ronald Louis Humphrey, challenged their espionage convictions to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, which unanimously ruled that the warrantless searches did not violate the men's rights.       In its opinion, the court said the executive branch has the "inherent authority" to wiretap enemies such as terror plotters and is excused from obtaining warrants when surveillance is "conducted 'primarily' for foreign intelligence reasons."       That description, some Republicans say, perfectly fits the Bush administration's program to monitor calls from terror-linked people to the U.S.

20081020084921AAk4mEz	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Need advice on filing a lawsuit against county officials? ?	A few months ago, we were harassed by an Animal Control Officer. To make a long story short, she admitted that the call she was responding to was unfounded.  But she noticed that I had puppies.  She became demanding about my breeding practices.  She tried to tell me that breeding is illegal in the town I live in.  I said I was a hobby breeder and exibitor, and I was within my rights.  She tols me that I was required to provide doghouses.  I corrected her again and said that I am required to provide adequate shelter and I had done that.  My kennels are covered to the point that a doghouse is useless, and I have a weather resistant breed that doesn't use them anyway.  Then she demanded to know how many dogs I had.  I had 5, she saw only 1, and wrote down that I had 4.  She said the town's zoning office would be calling me.  During her visit, my kids were playing outside in my fenced in yard.  My 11 year old was watching my 2 year old.      That was on Friday.  On Monday, my husband and I went to zoning ourselves to find out what we could.  She had already turned us in for having 7 dogs.  So she falsified information there.      If this had ended there, we would have gone no further.  But then she called CPS and reported me for neglecting my kids.  My 2 year old had fallen duing her visit.  The basis of her call was the fall and the fact that "mother is running a kennel"  She said I had large dogs in the back yard, but she never even saw them.  They are kenneled in the back yard and not running loose.      My kids were pulled out of school and interviewed.  They were told that their mother was bad and they were going to take them away.  They came home scared and in tears.  I have recently found out that it is unconstitutional for my kids to be questioned, even by CPS, without my knowledge and consent.  The ACO also went out of her bounds to file the complaint to begin with.  By law a required reporter has 72 hours to file a complaint.  This had expired.  She waited until after her time limit, and after I was cleared by zoning to call in her complaint.      I filed a complaint against her with her supervisor.  Nothing was done.  I talked with the Sheriff.  She hasn't been back, but my kids and myself still worry about CPS and the "next complaint."  This was unfounded, but still stays on my record for 3 years, which could cause problems when my husband tries to get his ministerial credentials.  I also panic whenever I see the Animal Control truck.      We want to do this right.  We will get a change of venue.  We want to take it to the proper court in D.C. where there would be no immunity because of the offices held.  I also would like to know how to put a monetary amount.  I'm not money hungry or sue happy.  But this officer is a bully and needs to be stopped.  My family should also be compensated for the harassment and false complaint as well as the emotional stuff that we have had to deal with as a result.  I've included the basics.  I didn't include every detailed piece of harassment, but that has been there as well.      Any advice?

20081015193058AAEAXJz	Politics & Government;Elections	What did it mean when Obama got called  on his record that he turned his head to the RIGHT and smile?	He couldn't face his own record, and he had NO legitimate answers.
20060723095301AAHAZr4	Politics & Government;Immigration	Why don’t everybody research better the situation?	Illegal workers has deductions too, I know I was there, in Colorado, California, Chicago and Nebraska always pay FT, SS, ST, for 5 years and never see a penny of that money, is not in my SS and not in my taxes where the money went. I work with hundreds of Illegal Aliens do the math, may be 50% if illegal Aliens work only the season and go back to Mexico never claim SS, they do not do Income taxes forms true but they put the money in the system. We need to know the realyty before we express our oppinion
20090131142941AAZU8Z5	Politics & Government;Elections	Did Sarah Palin know Levi Johnston's mother?	I know that amongst my group of friends in high school, most of the parents knew each other, or made an effort to know something of their children's associates. Just wondering if Mrs.Palin had an inkling of what kind of things her daughter may or may not have been exposed to.
20080930120730AA8K0Cr	Politics & Government;Elections	(For republicans: a question about Sarah Palin. I would like serious answers.) Why? ?	Hello,    -Why is it that republicans think that democrats are scared of Sarah Palin? Isn't it possible that democrats (and a lot of republicans now) see that she is just out of her league?   -Why do they think that she's been the victim of gotcha journalism? (I believe that Ms Couric's and Mr Gibson's questions were both very direct and asked questions that a country full of people want to know about her positions and ideas on several issues concerning the country.    - What grounds do you have for saying that Sarah Palin has more of a base in foreign affairs and general American politics issues than Senator Obama?   - How much time do you think she will be able to dedicate to her five children, including a little boy with down's syndrome and a pregnant 17 year old daughter if she is elected to the second highest position into this country? or, how much time will she be able to spend being an appropriate vice president when she has a full family that's about to get even fuller?   - Why is she and her daughter being applauded instead of left alone on the delicate matter of pregnancy before a person is ready for it? Why are republicans trying to orchestrate appearances of the two teens together and a quickie wedding before the election?   - Why is she now not allowed to talk without John McCain by her side? Why is she not allowed to talk, period?    - Why are people who question her about her ideals or opinions being called sexist when Hilary was called terrible things by the public at large when she started to take a little more control of the country?      and finally,       - In your heart of hearts, do you really think that Sarah Palin is the right woman for the job?         In my opinion: when compared to John Doe, Sarah Palin is not stupid; she's just not experienced on much that happens outside of Alaska, or indeed outside of what she defines her world to be. She is instead an inexperienced politician who is being painfully made into a joke as more and more people see the ridiculousness of her nomination as Vice President of the United States of America. Personally, I think calling her stupid or ignorant is nicer than her being made into a national joke.      I'm not asking for abuse or insults, or being told to research it myself. I have researched extensively, and I still have a fairly negative opinion not on Sarah Palin the person but Sarah Palin the politician. I am honestly asking for opinions and if a republican can tell me something that I have missed.

20081019191854AAKYvgN	Politics & Government;Politics	Do You Feel The Media Has Been Biased For Borack Obama?	I am a liberal independent. I will vote for Obama. However I have noticed that most T.V. networks have been biased for him. I have seen several satires in the newspaper and on sketch shows commenting on how much the media LOVES Obama.      I wanted Hillary Clinton to win, but apperently the media did not want to. So has the media been biased for Obama?
20060611090801AAPUHxj	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why do attorneys/ lawyers and judges get to license themselves through a private club?	I've heard the argument that their profession is so highly technical that only a fellow lawyer could understand it, but surgeons who preform live donor organ transplants which are also highly technical are licensed through the state the operated in, so I reject that argument, as well as the argument that the public doesn't understand that criminals need a defense and that people would seek to revoke the license of a lawyer that defended a particularly reprehensible criminal, this might have been the case years ago but after so many Grishom movies and novels and so many lawyer shows on tv I don't believe that argument either, so what is left?

20081014123046AAEw12e	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Are agreements over the phone legally binding?	A few months back I was talking to a telemarketer over the phone. He offered me a bunch of magazines for a year or so for around $600 and that I would receive a $1000 shopping spree. I stupidly agreed (I was kinda depressed and this just seemed great) and gave them my address, home and cell number (well, they had my cell already), and debit card #. They told me the call was being recorded also. A few weeks later I received a contract in the mail about what we talked about on the phone. I never signed it. Now they are sending me magazines and sending me letters saying I owe them over $600. They also keep calling me. Am I legally obligated to pay them even though I never signed anything or can I just ignore them till they stop?

They all agree on the bail out, immigration, much of the foreign policy, etc.       This election is going to be like choosing which terd smells better.  There is no difference.  Do you want a fresh stinking terd, or a stale terd that smells worse when wet?      Bottom line:      When will you people of America wake up and see that this government has been hijacked by the Globalist party disguised as two different parties who distract you by blaming each other and who force you to choose one side of the fence?  Why can't you sit back on the bleachers and see what is really going on?

20081004175406AAAGGxp	Politics & Government;Military	Warning system in America?	"The British are feeling the pinch in relation to recent terrorist threats and have raised their security level from "Miffed" to "Peeved." Soon, though, security levels may be raised yet again to "Irritated" or even "A Bit Cross." Brits have not been "A Bit Cross" since the blitz in 1940 when tea supplies all but ran out. Terrorists have been re-categorized from "Tiresome" to a "Bloody Nuisance." The last time the British issued a "Bloody Nuisance" warning level was during the great fire of 1666.      The French government announced yesterday that it has raised its terror alert level from "Run" to "Hide". The only two higher levels in France are "Collaborate" and "Surrender." The rise was   precipitated by a recent fire that destroyed France's white flag factory, effectively paralyzing the country's military capability.      It's not only the French who are on a heightened level of alert. Italy has increased the alert level from "Shout loudly and excitedly" to "Elaborate military Posturing." Two more levels remain: "Ineffective Combat Operations" and "Change Sides."      The Germans also increased their alert state from "Disdainful Arrogance" to "Dress in Uniform and Sing Marching Songs." They also have two higher levels: "Invade a Neighbour" and "Lose".      Belgians, on the other hand, are all on holiday as usual, and the only threat they are worried about is NATO pulling out of Brussels.      The Spanish are all excited to see their new submarines ready to deploy. These beautifully designed subs have glass bottoms so the new Spanish navy can get a really good look at the old Spanish navy.      Americans meanwhile are carrying out pre-emptive strikes, on all of their allies, just in case."      Just a joke!      That's all folks!
20080929130027AA85FBw	Politics & Government;Elections	Was this an example of Republicans "America First!"?	The majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives voted against the bailout plan.  Their first announced reason was because they didn't like what Pelosi said.  Then McCain says Obama is to blame.  What does Obama have to do with Republicans voting?  They made a decision to reject the plan, no one can be blamed for how they voted.  What do you think about their view of  "America First!" based on what they did.  Should they have let Pelosi's comments affect their vote?

I cannot imagine that my PUBLIC high school has the right to dictate what color students are allowed to wear. This year, my new principal for my school prohibits ALL costumes, any color suggesting "Halloween", and even things like no spider earrings, or bags with pumpkins on them. First of all, i believe this is a violation of my freedom of speech as dictated in the supreme court trial of Tinker v Des Moines relating to the wearing of black armbands to protest the government's policy in Vietnam. I am a hard working student, I do not disrupt classes, and I am not infringing upon other student's rights by wearing black and orange. I will be wearing black and orange tomorrow. Is this a good idea? Why would my school do this anyway? Is this just a common mistake of any inexperienced new principal? (All my teachers think shes crazy because of this new rule).

Barack Obama, citing the Democrat's "ability to inspire" and the "inclusive nature of his campaign."         "He has both style and substance. I think he is a transformational figure," Powell said on NBC's "Meet the Press."      "Obama displayed a steadiness. Showed intellectual vigor. He has a definitive way of doing business that will do us well," Powell said.      Powell, a retired U.S. general and a Republican, was once seen as a possible presidential candidate himself.      Powell said he questioned Sen. John McCain's judgment in picking Gov. Sarah Palin as his running mate because he doesn't think she is ready to be president.   -------------------------------------   For McCain supporters, Powell has long been cited as a Republican of rare integrity and courage.  Does his endorsement sway you?   He also said he was disappointed with some of McCain's campaign tactics, such as bringing up Obama's ties to former 1960s radical Bill Ayers.

Do these orders stay on ur record if they are dropped? if they are not dropped do they stay on ur record? I have never been in ANY kind of legal trouble and I do not want to have her drama affecting me. Her allegations are mainly false... She only took one out for retaliation because my BF had her charged w Felony theft cuz she stole his money and our last court appearance the judge found probable cause for her to be arraigned. 2 weeks later we get served. This girl and I have never even  spoken to each other. We don't know each other. she couldnt even fill out the restraining order correctly because she doesnt know me. I have been w my BF for 1 1/2 years and she alledges I have been stalking her for the last month...Will this be on my record?

Ok Im sure you read the title and thought "wtf?!" but I found this:      The germans have a phrase Kadavergehorsam, that denotes blind obediance, or "obediant corpse".       but I have never heard of experiments to reanimate corpses for military (or other purposes).       The nearest anecdotal account is that of a ceremony that was rumoured to take place at Schlo? Wewelsburg (an officer's school for Himmler's Schutzstaffel) where the preserved heads of SS Officers killed on the Eastern Front were returned and communication (via necromancy) was attempted in order to gain information.       There are claims by Anton LaVey and Michael Aquino that they adapted this ceremony into their ritual "The Rite of the Stifling Air", but there is no proof any written evidence from Wewelsburg actually exists.      So wht do you think? Could the Nazi's have created Zombies and deystroyed all the evidance? I dont think so but I want to see what you guys think.

20061027065858AAsrdby	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do liberals use statements by talk shows hosts to indict all Republicans?	I constantly see liberals posting tirades against all Republicans based on statements by Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh. There is no question that these people are partisan and spin for the Republicans, and while they do have influence in the debate, they in no way represent the whole of thinking in the Republican Party. When I see Republicans posting regarding statements it is usually, but not always, in response to actions or statements of politicians. You don't see them saying did you hear what Al Franken or Alan Combes said on his show? In those rare instances when they do, the liberal answer is "change the channel if you don't like it". Some content from these shows may indeed be offensive based on your viewpoint, but what about free speech? and Do liberals not know how to change the channel?       Disclaimers: I am not a Republican. I am an Independent. I do not listen to Hannity or Limbaugh as a general rule and wouldn't base my views on their opinions if I did.       What say you?

20090131084320AA1TnYp	Politics & Government;Politics	I pledge allegiance...?	to Obama?   Here's an excerpt:   At least three of the five classrooms have an overhead projector and as the children stand to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, the teacher turns on the classroom overhead and a full body image of Obama, with six U.S. flags behind him, comes up about 4 feet away from the flag that hangs on the wall. The screen is apparently around five feet by six feet.      In the image, President Obama appears to be staring straight out with no facial expression, just a serious look. All of the kids in each class faced the President, instead of the flag that hangs in the corner.      Local parents are up in arms over this situation. Teachers clearly do not realize the gravity of what they are doing.      This is not right. Why would those teachers do that? People should be worried about this kind of thing, it smacks of brown shirt tactics.    http://newsblaze.com/story/2009012722450...

Everybody -almost- in our country seems to think Hezbollah uses human shields but yet someone asks: so how come lebanese and all arabs and muslims still support, respect, and even love Hezbollah??   The answer is that "they don't really use human shields!!!" Who would believe that they would use their own brothers, sisters, wives, mothers, and children as shields? No one with brains!      So who uses human shields?   The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights "B'Tselem" reports:   "Israeli Soldiers use civilians as Human Shields in Beit Hanun      B'Tselem's initial investigation indicates that, during an incursion by Israeli forces into Beit Hanun, in the northern Gaza Strip, on 17 July 2006, soldiers seized control of two buildings in the town and used residents as human shield... the soldiers held six residents, two of them minors, on the staircases of the two buildings"       http://www.btselem.org/english/Human_Shi...

Supponendo che sia vero che tutte le multinazionali sono sfruttatrici, malvagie ecc. capite che non si possono boicottare?!? Se andate a far benzina date i soldi a una multinazionale, se comprate una macchina o una moto sono delle multinazionali, se comprate una casa finanziate diverse multinazionali (tipo italcementi); non potete andare al bar perchè tutte le acque minerali tutte le bibite e molti alcolici appartengono a multinazionali; il computer che state usando è di una multinazionale e forse anche i vestiti che avete addosso, lo stesso vale per la tv, il telefonino, il gestore telefonico, il dentifricio, i prodotti per i capelli ecc.

20090131110116AAwe10h	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can a restraining order keep my roommate away?	I live in an apartment with two other girls. One of the roommates is fine and mostly keeps out of the situation. The other roommate has had a vendetta against me basically since I moved in for very stupid reasons. I admit, I had my faults too. All three of us had a meeting and we set up ground rules. We even made a chart to split up cleaning duties!! But very strange things would bother her, like me saying "hi" when I came in or "bye" as I left. Eventually of course, she let me know and I stopped (weird, I know). Anyway, I eventually things got very awkward and she left shortly before finals, yet left her things there. This semester, she came back and again, things were awkward. But earlier this week she informed the other roommate via text that she was leaving and cut off the internet, which was under her name. She has not taken any of her belongings, but when I came back to the apt this weekend, there was a smell in the apt and some of my things were missing. The other roommate is gone all weekend, and she is the only option as the culprit. I honestly fear for my safety, and definitely for my property, and have installed surveillance to really make sure it is her. I hope this combined with some other incidents and verbal assaults/threats are enough to get me a restraining order. Will this be able to keep her away?
