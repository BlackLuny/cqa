Currently I am a major in Economics and I am almost done with it, but the problem is that my school will not let me graduate without 120 credits ( I am already 1 year ahead of my actual class). So I am thinking about adding Accounting or Finance as a second degree.      Which one do you think looks better on a resume, Economics/Accounting or Economics/Finance?       Also how does the job market look for Accounting and Finance, I know that Finance majors are having trouble right now but what about Accounting? And since in a couple of year companies will be switching to the international standard wouldn't all accountants have to relearn it since all they teach us at school is GAAP?      Thanks

20090227013127AAG2k56	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	If you have a small amount of income, would you consider it foolish to use the ATM to get $$, with $2 fee?	I mean, does having 2 extra dollars taken from your bank account seem foolish, when you need $40 for household cleaning items, toiletries, co-pay on prescriptions, & change in quarters to do laundry?      OK, It's 3:18 AM, & I'm SO worried. I get SSI & Social Security. Total=$694/month. I have a neurological disability, & I want a job, but it's difficult to find one.       Today, I got paid $246, & on the 3rd, I get $448. I'm debating on whether to go to the corner store @ 6 AM to get $40 out of the ATM (inside the store) with a $2 fee taken out, & out of that $40, $10 in change for laundry & the rest of what I need to buy, -OR- wait until 9AM to go to WalMart & get what I need, & then, get $40 extra (no $2 fee) from the cashier when I pay for my items, & then ask for $10 in quarters.      If I'm just getting $246 today, & I have to buy the above items, plus pay a phone bill, do you think $2 would hurt? I, myself, am not tripping off of $2, but it's outsiders & control freaks, like neighbors, family members, & misc. acquaintances who would make a big deal out of it.      Well, I need to get @ LEAST $40 out the ATM, with $10 of quarters included because I need to do laundry REALLY badly because my brother had a problem with my sister, & he got angry & left & came here by me with only the clothes he had on him, & I had to loan him my clothes, towels, & washcloths, so I need to do laundry really bad & like ASAP! So I can have washcloths & towels cleaned, as well as clothes, so I can take a shower before I leave to run my errands for the day. But that's why I'm wondering if I should do it now or wait & save $2.       Sorry for too much info. But I just needed you to understand the entire situation. What would you do if you were in this EXACT predicament?

20090305074911AAB85l9	Business & Finance;Credit	Does this hurt your Credit Score?	Does it hurt your credit if you switch to a different credit card? Such that I have a balance with a high APR and I would like to transfer it so it has a 0% APR (at least til it is paid off).       Can you (anybody) just transfer the balance so the APR is 0% and get no penalty on your credit score? If so, Can you do it continuously so you don't have an APR ever on balance transfers or purchases? (like 0% APR on transfers and purchases for 6 months, transfer from one to that then 6 months later transfer again to another of the same?)      Is this a way to cheat the system?

20090305073305AA1d12v	Business & Finance;Credit	Credit card online transactions?	I recently discovered that my son who is in his first year away at school has run up 2 massive debts on his credit card.  These were accrued on betting sites outside of the US.  I was under the impression charges like this were illegal for U.S. citizens and would be blocked by the CC company.  How can the cc company process a charge thats violating american law?  Would contacting the CC company accomplish anything in terms of having these charges removed as they're allowing for something to happen that is banned.  Any help would be appreciated for a frustrated father.

20090227012333AAyd81j	Business & Finance;Corporations	Royal Mail Postage Costs?	Right - it kinda goes without saying that we're in a state of financial boo boo at the moment, and need to save pennies wherever we can.   Fat cat bosses seem only to be getting fatter (with pensions exceeding GDP of small nations) and strategies in place to screw us wherever possible for our last pocket cash.      I was curious to know if there was an unwritten agreement by everyone to only buy 2nd class postage - surely the RM can't sit on every letter/parcel for 3 days before deciding to do anything about it!   Before you say it - I know the socioeconomic issues surrounding a loss in more money, and don't believe that I am trying to advocate further job losses in a "already damaged" market - however we need to recognise that you simply cannot reward senior management big bonuses when shopfloor workers are struggling to figure if their next payslip will arrive or not.       Can we as a democratic nation not agree to address this failing in top heavy industry?  Please discuss.....      Power To The People MFs!!

20090227013446AAtaHjM	Business & Finance;Small Business	Purchased costly item on Ebay and wrote to seller that item is NOT as described and he said return it?	and upon receipt within 1 day or same day, he'll return PayPal money.      Now I asked this question ON Ebay website and he responded on Ebay website.        Still I don't trust the guy cause he doesn't give out Pos Feedback, even if you pay Immediately, he waits first to see what you give him (which I thought was't allowed and certianly not ethical).  But Pay Pal said, it's safer to first put in complaint, but, because he responded to your specific question, that I want to return the item because it's not as advertised and replied on ebay that I can return it and as soon as he receives item, he will reimburse my paypal account same or next day, pay pal person said, "then it doesn't matter and you can immediately return it" cause it's on record when he replied to you (since you both wrote  on Ebay it's on record) that if he doesn't give back money, Ebay/PayPal will fight him.  And even though she fist said, "PUT  a complaint in First to cover yourself", she then found out that he replied to my request for refund on ebay, and on ebay he replied affirmatively.  So that it's on record...so I don't have to bother to make complaint cause I can always make complaint afterwards, since it's already ON Record, at the Ebay Site?       What is the best thing to do?  Truthfully, Id rather not make complaint but, if that's the only wayto assure refund,k but payy pal said, ""NO he has to return it"            and if he doeswnt, he can d o the same thing even if you log complaint first (so that may antagonize him, no?)....HELP?

I recently complained to the management that my neighbor plays music really really loud. It was literally vibrating the dishes in my kitchen loud. The management sent a letter to the tenant, and they got really pissed...I assumed that they got the letter and came to my room. The lady threatened  to kill me and called me a fu**ing ***** and left. I was so stunned, I just didn't know what to do. I'm so scared they might come back. I did not (haven't) filed a report to the authority because I was too scared that they might get more angry if they get another letter (possibly to evict).... when I talked to my landlord about the noise, they said that if I break my lease I wont get my deposit back and will be held responsible for the rest of the rent. I don't know if I want to sublet because I will still be on lease and held responsible for the damages that new tenant might cause. what can I do? Any suggestions?
