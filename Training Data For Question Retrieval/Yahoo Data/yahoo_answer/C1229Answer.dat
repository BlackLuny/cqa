Normal polarity in electronics is when you have the positive hooked up to the positive terminal and the negative to the negative terminal. Reverse polarity would be having the positive hooked up to the negative terminal and the negative to the positive terminal.

kA7GEKf7aa	Okay well reaction order is when changing a reagent has an effect on the rate. If you doubled the reagent and the rate increased by a factor of 16 (which is very rare btw) that would have a reaction order of 4 since 2^x = 16 and you figure out what x is. So another example would be if you doubled the reagent and the rate doubled also, you would have the equation 2*x = 2 and the reaction order would be 1.

AA10657034	In biology, an organism is said to regenerate a lost or damaged part if the part regrows so that the original function is restored.<br>  <br>  Regenerative capacity is inversely related to complexity: in general, the more complex an animal is the less regeneration it is capable of. Whereas newts, for example, can regenerate severed limbs mammals cannot. Limb regeneration in newts occurs in two major steps, first de-differentiation of adult cells into a stem cell state similar to embryonic cells and second, development of these cells into new tissue more or less the same way it developed the first time. Simpler animals like planaria have an enhanced capacity to regenerate because the adults retain clusters of stem cells within their bodies which migrate to the parts of the body that need healing then divide and differentiate to provide the required missing tissue.

9Xur3g9Paa	There is plenty of misleading information on this question.  First, antidepressants affect brain serotonin (that's why they are prescribed).  However, your teacher is misinterpreting basic neurophysiology and neuropharmacology.  Clinically depressed patients have a decrease in the functional activity of monoamines, including serotonin (the other monoamines include norepinephrine and dopamine).  It is pretty clear from the last 30+ years of clinical research that depression is directly related to serotonin in one of several ways: either not enough serotonin is being produced and/or released, or there is down regulation of serotonin receptor density or down regulation of serotonin receptor sensitivity.  Common classes of antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs, MAOIs) remedy this by increasing the functional activity of the serotonin system.  This is accomplished different ways but basically they each turn off the brain's natural turning off mechanism to make whatever serotonin is available more effective.  Here's how: Normally, many neurochemicals when released from neurons make brief contact with nearby receptors which in turn either cause an increase or decrease in release of some other neurochemical stored in that neuron.  This process is often turned off by something called reuptake (wherein the neurotransmitter is removed from the synapes so it cannot continue to interact with receptors).  This ballet occurs millions of times a second in the brain.  SSRIs block the reuptake (removal) of serotonin.  If reuptake back into the neuron is blocked, it allows more serotonin-receptor interaction.  Similarly, MAOIs accomplish the same end result but in a different way.   Another way the brain turns off serotonin (and some other neurotransmitters) is through enzymatic destruction by an enzyme called monoamine oxidase) MAO).  MAO inhibitors (MAOIs) inhibit MAO.  By inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down serotonin, more serotonin is available to interact with serotonin receptors).  None of these actions would decrease the manufacture of serotonin (and yes, I have considered presynaptic inhibitory feedback loops).   <br>  <br>  It would make little sense if antidepressants decreased the ability of the brain to synthesize serotonin since the lack of serotonin (as discussed above) is an important cause of the depression being treated by the antidepressant!  That thinking is simply illogical.  Sorry.|`|vVfH8yBYaa	Your body doesn't stop making serotonin. If that were true, your brain would stop working. Serotonin is a neurochemical necessary for brain function.|`|luYtFLSUaa	It does not. An antidepressant affects the serotonin equilibrium.  Serotonin is either in the brain's liquid or it is attached to serotonin receptors in brain cells. It leaves receptors and return and leaves, etc etc. in the normal person. In depressed people it tends to spend too much time attached to receptors. Antidepressants lock onto receptors and slow or inhibit serotonin re-uptake by the receptors|`|P4cvrMxgaa	Doc is correct, and your teacher may want to invest in a pharmacology handbook.  There are a few types of antidepressants, but I think she is talking about SSRIs (Zoloft, Paxil, Prozac, etc).  These work, just like Doc said, by affecting where serotonin hangs out.  The abbreviation SSRI stands for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor, which is a fancy way of saying it keeps serotonin from being sucked back up by the nerve endings that released it.  But it has no effect on how much serotonin is produced.|`|AA11615294	Michelle is correct. These drugs do not in any way alter the production of serotonin. What it does is to affect the re-uptake of the serotonin at the post synaptic neuron. This has the effect of increasing function of serotonin and thus will affect mood. This process is called potentiating the serotonin.

Conservation of energy states that the amount of energy in a system must remain constant. Ignoring friction, this is written formulaically as<br>  <br>  Em = Ep + Ek<br>  <br>  Where Em is mechanical (total) energy, and Ek is kinetic energy. <br>  <br>  Ek = 1/2 mv^2<br>  <br>  So, substituting the formulas for Ep and Ek into the equation for Em:<br>  <br>  Em = mgh + 1/2 mv^2<br>  <br>  Since Em is a constant value, as one of the terms decreases, the other must increase. The higher your initial height from the ground, the more potential energy you will have at your initial time (when the speed of the car, and therefore the kinetic energy is equal to zero). As the car speeds down the ramp, your height from the ground decreases, and so the speed must increase so that Em remains constant. At the bottom of the ramp, your speed is at a maximum because your height is equal to zero. Because Em must remain constant, if you increase your initial height (making the first term large initially) then your final speed will be greater because Ep at the top must equal Ek at the bottom. That is,<br>  <br>  mgh = 1/2mv^2<br>  2gh = v^2<br>  v = sqt (2gh)<br>  <br>  Since g is essentially constant over small changes in height, the only variable affecting the speed of the object is its initial height from the ground.

jcGeCJnOaa	Well the Sun will never become a 'brown giant', but what you described is the Sun becoming a red giant. <br>  <br>  Yes, the Earth will broil. It will be a slow process over hundreds of millions of years. Will the Earth itself crash into the Sun? That's open for debate. Many say the the mass loss of the Sun while it expands into a red giant will allow the Earth orbit to expand. Others contend that that same mass loss will create a drag on the Earth and it will be consumed by the Sun.<br>  <br>  I guess we’ll have to wait around another 5 billion years to find out for sure.|`|TuR5vMuzaa	The good thing is ,long long before earth is consumed by sun ( may be a millions of  yrs early) there won't be any one left on this planet.

zf8BnU6Yaa	Radioactive elements are those which are unstable.  They will eventually break down into other elements through the emission of radiation in different forms.  These unstable ones are called isotopes and the elements decay on a regular basis.  So the rate of this decay is described by its half-life where it is the time that half of the material will have undergone radioactive decay.  In some cases it is minuscule fractions of a second and in others it is thousands of years or any span of time between those.  So the material decays to half of the original, then to a quarter of the original, then to an eighth of the original etc.

Probability of no winner is exactly 28/64 which is the probability the 1 is on an edge.

(in 68 cases, they are neighbors)  C(36,2) = 36 x 35 / 2 = 630 have them both in the interior (110 have them as neighbors)<br>  <br>  So in this case, the probability of NO winners is:<br>  (378 + 68 + 110)/2016 = 556/2016 = 27.6%<br>  <br>  I think the differences between the simulation and the calculated results are due to the following:<br>  <br>  - the simulation is for exactly p 0's and q 1's.<br>  - the calculation is for P(0) = p/n^2, P(1) = q/n^2.<br>  <br>  Those are not quite the same, since, for example, for the single 1 case, in the probability model, there could be more than one 1, so higher chance of there being one surrounded by 0's.|`|UnGDFFVFaa	n2=p+q, p≥8, q≥1<br>  The probability that there exists only one such cell is<br>  P=(n-2)2C(n2-9,p-8)/C(n2,p)<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  My answer was based on the following:<br>  The total number of the 0's and the 1's is n2=p+q.<br>  There are (n-2)2 different ways a 3x3 cell to be put up in a (n x n) array.

Nn8OSkrBaa	Use a monostable (non- retriggerable) circuit with a variable time setting. Once triggered it runs the pulse and when the pulse ends it triggers your grenade. The best is a CMOS Hex inverter chip. Two sections are for the triggerable timer and the third inverter hooked up to it gives you the rising pulse to do what you want. Three parts... one chip, one capacitor and one resistor and maybe a little circuit board to mount it all. There are so many ways to do that.

NbdTgyLPaa	Not having done this before either, I can't tell you what will work.  But I have a couple of ideas you might try.<br>  <br>  The first idea is getting (or building) something like a pan that is 10 cm high and filling it most of the way to the top with a very viscous liquid, like maple syrup or some thick oil.  To keep the liquid from escaping, seal it with plastic wrap (thick wrap or multiple layers).  Make sure that the covering is loose enough that the egg can sink to the bottom or almost to the bottom.  If you expect the egg to hit the bottom of the pan, try padding it with some soft layer, perhaps some bubble wrap.<br>  <br>  Another idea is use the a pan (or box) as in my previous idea, again covered with plastic wrap.  Inside you can have the packing peanuts that you wouldn't ordinarily be able to use as now they won't spill out.<br>  <br>  My third idea is a combination of layers of bubble wrap and thick towels.<br>  <br>  Obviously for any of these, experimenting before you have to do it for real will help you choose the best approach.  The one idea of putting peanut butter on top sounds like it could be useful to any idea that you have some concern that the egg would bounce or roll away.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|fS8joiTaaa	i dont know but we had to drop an egg so i put the egg in my sock that was filled with paper towels then put the sock in the middle of the shoe followed by more paper towels and it worked better than peoples who worked on them for days.|`|Ujvla6Uiaa	ok never done this before but it came to my mind when I read your project. How about a cone shaped like catcher. what it will do is that the egg will come done this cone and friction will do the magic of stopping it. as the egg goes down the cone there will be more friction acting on it.<br>  <br>  since you only have 10cm high you can have a wide open 'mouth' so the egg is catch and then you have 1meter to the sides that means you can have a 1meter cone that will gradually stop the egg as it get to the tip of such.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Let me know how it goes..|`|xsDwZgroaa	How about a sticky surface, like peanut butter on cardboard, over a set of springs.  The peanut butter will keep the egg from falling and soften the landing a little, and the springs will bring it to a smooth stop.<br>  <br>  That's the first thought that comes to my mind.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Better yet, how about combining my idea with DJ's?  A wide, shallow cone, covered in peanut butter, over a set of springs.  That'll let the egg roll a bit and slow it down more gently.

QUL2XWaJaa	The formula for ammonium sulfide would be (NH4)2S, since the ammonium ion takes a 1+ charge and the sulfide ion takes 2-. <br>  <br>  The first step in any problem like this is to determine the molar mass of the compound. This can be done fairly easy by consulting the periodic table:<br>  <br>  2 x 14 (for N) + 2 x 4 x 1 (for H) + 32 (for S) = 68 g/mol<br>  <br>  Now, we need to determine what percent of this is nitrogen. But that's easy:<br>  <br>  (2 x 14) / 68 x 100% = 41.2 % N<br>  <br>  Now, to answer your question: It seems a bit odd to me, since the law of definite proportions tells us that the percent nitrogen in ANY sample of ammonium sulfide (be it 6.4 g or 6.4 x 10^6 g) is 41.2%. So, really, that's your answer. However, if the question asks how many grams of nitrogen there are in 6.4 g of ammonium sulfide, the answer would be:<br>  <br>  6.4 g x 0.412 = 2.64 g.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps you understand what's going on!

RA3p25Qoaa	How the seal hunt is good for sealers<br>  - Provides employment during the early spring for those with seal licences<br>  - Selling the pelts, oil and meat allow people to continue a traditional way of life and make a living at it. <br>  - It allows First Nations in rural communities to take part in hunting activities and bring in income to their communities as well as those of European decent. <br>  - The meat is rich in Omega 3 and 6 so it's good for your heart. It is eaten locally and sold. <br>  - The pelts are water proof and tend not to cause allergies the way rabbit and other furs do. So it is ideal for people living in cold regions. <br>  - The Harp seal population off the coast of Newfoundland is over 5 million. These animals have been hunted for hundreds of years yet their numbers are still going strong. Just imagine how many there would be with out hunting. <br>  - In Canada the seal hunt is tightly regulated. People caught breaking the law loose their license and face charges. There are quotas based on the population. <br>  <br>  How the seal hunt is good for activists<br>  - Even though " baby" seals have not been hunted since 1987 they still use them on their posters and protests. By spreading this false information they are able to win people who don't know a lot about the hunt to their side. <br>  <br>  - Protesting the seal hunt makes these groups a lot of cash. The money is then used to continue protesting and continue making money. While Wolffish and other endangered species continue to die off. <br>  <br>  - The seal hunt takes place outside unlike slaughtering of farm animals. So they can easily take graphic images to upset people. Today people are far removed from nature so the images of animals being killed is shocking, yet we still go out for burgers and fries no second thoughts. <br>  <br>  - The majority of people do not know the seal hunt practices or regulations so the activists can say pretty well anything they want. Thus we have the " baby seal" issue and skinning alive claims. Both are illegal and would carry consequences for the sealer caught doing such a thing.  Other claims saying the hunt is a sport is just plain silly but people believe it.  anti-sealing groups love to focus on clubbing. But the majority of seals are shot. so few seals are clubbed that the sealers association is debating banning hakipiks. Oddly enough the HSUS stepped up and said clubbing should not be banned because it would make the hunt inhumane.... Is anyone else as confused as I am?|`|2qQPBDlkaa	seals natural predators.. great white sharks and orcas are both greatly reduced in numbers... so seals have to be hunted in some manner to insure he numbers stay within the food supply capability...<br>  <br>  if we had no seal hunts then the seals would rapidly out breed their food supply and instead of dying from being hunted they would simply starve to death.|`|tMY4iTlVaa	They serve no real purpose and are unnecessarily cruel.

MqFBxh65aa	Because the diagonal is an axis of symmetry, you know that the angle formed by the base and the diagonal has to be 90 degrees.<br>  <br>  Let's position the square so the vertexes point up, down, left and right and have the bases of the trapezoid so they are perpendicular to the up and down diagonal.

8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	Nothing extraordinary would happen (apart from a slight time dilation - see below the main post). Travelling through time zones only affects the local time. You could, if you move fast enough, go from 23:00 local time back to 01:00 local time of the same day. But once you cross the International Date Line, you will find yourself back in the day you started from.<br>  <br>  The International Date Line (IDL) is an imaginary line on the surface of the Earth opposite the Prime Meridian where the date changes as one travels east or west across it. Crossing the IDL traveling east results in a day being subtracted, and crossing west results in a day being added. You need to travel west if you want to go backwards through the time zones. But crossing the IDL from east to west will put you one day forward, making it impossible to "jump" one day back.<br>  <br>  For example, imagine that it's midnight exactly over the IDL. You are approaching the IDL from east, and in the local time zone just before the IDL it's just after midnight on 21 Feb. You're hoping that, by crossing to the next time zone, you will find yourself in 20 Feb just before midnight, but that will not be the case. The IDL will put you forward 24hrs, making it 21 Feb just before midnight. Crossing any more time zones in the same direction will only mean going back through the same day you started on - 21 Feb.<br>  ...<br>  <br>  One interesting thing that will happen to you if you travel very fast (in any direction) is that your own time will end up slightly behind the time on the ground. It's called time dilation, and is predicted by the theory of Relativity.|`|53sVKcOeaa	Time is relative, we use it to measure the passage of space between events although you could technically never travel backwards using your idea you could appear to travel back 12 hours, you'd just go backwards 12 hours then forward 12 hours and so.|`|AA10328947	I have asked this question ages ago , here;s the best answer i got :<br>  Newton's special theory of relativity.<br>  This says that if an object is moving close to the speed of light, to an observer standing still the object would be all distorted. <br>  However in the frame of reference of the object (in this circumstance you) as you are moving relatively to the speed you will appear as normal. however there will be a time dilation (it will seem longer to get round the world to you than it would to an observer) and length contraction (the distance to you would seem shorter than it actually is). As you are moving faster than the speed of light i cannot tell you because it defys all laws of physics and no-one really knows what would happen then, maybe you'd explode or turn into a fairy....?|`|WNPdYY3haa	no matter how many times it went around, the people in the plane would be as many hours older and when they started their journey and wherever they land they would put thier clocks to the day and hour it is in that city.|`|vMR0IqNCaa	surprisinglyyou would become a little disjointed from time. an experiment where 2 atomic clocks at the same time were seperated 1 was sent on a plane around the world as fast as possible while one stayed when brought together again they had a difference of 0.01milisecond|`|9SSO454taa	if you go the speed of light then you go forwards in time, if you go faster than the speed of light you would go back in time.<br>  <br>  but your body would rip apart before you could hit the speed of light.

We can't easily count individual atoms or molecules because they are so small and it would take a very long time even if we could see them. However, we can weigh atoms and molecules easily the mole lets us easily convert weights into numbers of atoms/molecules.

QmwYOQuDaa	After you graduate with a NAAB accredited architecture program, you are called Architectural Intern, assistant project manager, job captain, drafter, or designer (Architect in Training or AIT when you pass the first section of tests).  You are only legally allowed to refer to yourself as an architect after you fully pass the ARE, and only in the State you are registered in.  Generally, non-registrants make a lot less than architects.  As an intern, depending on the city you work in, you may make $26-40k/year.  You will be expected to work a lot of over time, so your pay could net $5/hour or less.  With more experience, your pay will go up.<br>  There are several ways one could be an architect and it all differs in the State you work in.  In California, you only need work experience and a high school diploma to be registered.  But generally, there are two different types of programs, a 5 year BArch and a six year MArch.  You can also pursue a non-architectural undergraduate degree and pursue architecture in a 3.5 year MArch program.<br>  I firmly believe the best architectural college is the one that will accept you.  You really start learning when you're in the field.

NIyyDwNVaa	This is complete guess based on some knowledge<br>  <br>  So Myopia (Nearsightedness) occurs when the lens focuses light from a DISTANT object in front of the retina. <br>  <br>  Okay so a lens of the eye is a converging lens = () (try and imagine the parenthesis as connected and that's the shape of the lens).<br>  <br>   Obviously with eye defects the lens is for a better work broke and doesn't converge light on to the retina properly.<br>  <br>  Nearsightedness means you can see close objects but you can't see far objects. In fact what happens is light from distant objects is focused in front of the retina.<br>  <br>  In order to compensate we have eye glasses which help bend the light to help the lens focus the light properly on the RETINA.<br>  <br>  So for nearsighted people; if you use a DIVERGING lens you can bend the light rays outward just enough so that the eye lens will focus the light on the retina<br>  <br>  Try and draw this if you know about rays.<br>  <br>  Okay so obviously if you want to make fire you need to converge light to a single point. If you're glasses are made from a diverging lens then you can't focus light on a single point to create fire<br>  <br>  If you're far sighted<br>  Nearby objects are hard to see because light is focused BEHIND the retina. (Retina is AT THE BACK of the eye btw)<br>  <br>  Okay so in order to try and compensate eye glasses are made of CONVERGING lenses and you could use them to make fire<br>  <br>  I don't know about the telescope sorry. I'm pretty sure the above is true for lens but try wikipedia or yahoo search just to be sure.<br>  <br>  Hey I was just curious and I searched and found this stuff listed under sources to kind of prove my stuff. Which is cool just to be able to think through it.<br>  <br>  For the Telescope. Since Both lenses are converging lenses.

Since he can see really far, but not at a near point, his lens would have to able to focus at a near distance. on the other hand the nearsighted person's lens focuses at longer distances. which would not be convenient if you want to start a fire. <a href="http://www.yorku.ca/eye/near-far.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.yorku.ca/eye/near-far.htm</a><br>  <br>  2) he used the lens from the barely farsighted eye and then put the lens from the farsighted eye after it (so first the barely farsighted, then the farsighted, then the eye) why? well if you think about it the barely farsighted eye means that he is nearsighted therefore the lens he is using will be to focus at long distances (You will get a magnification). then the farsighted eye means that the lens will focus at short distance. ie. the amplified picture will be more clear with this lens since it will let him see more details.

AA12327015	No it will not take effect right away. Prozac is "stored" in your body (to explain it very simply). This is one reason people don't need to taper the dose when going off the drug.<br>  <br>  You could even skip a couple of days and you would still have some Prozac in your system. That would get a quicker effect of you wanting less side effects. It would not hurt you.<br>  <br>  BUT, I'm not a doctor, and I don't know your history. So you're on your own.|`|OgQ8opeAaa	It's likely all in your head.  The previous poster was correct in that Prozac and other drugs in its class (called selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, or, SSRIs) are "stored" in your body.  Their half-life is very long (approaching two weeks).<br>  <br>  Contrary to what the previous poster said, you should not abruptly stop these drugs because after a week or two you are at risk for "seritonin syndrome."<br>  <br>  Even though your feeling better may be little more than a placebo effect, who cares?  The important thing is that you feel better, right?

If they kept going that fast in a straight line, their so clocks would be slowed by a fraction of a millisecond per day. Since they are going in circles, the slowing of their clocks is much less; it is extremely difficult to detect the difference between clocks on the ground and clocks in orbit. <br>  <br>  The risk of being blown up during takeoff or reentry or during a space walk takes several years off of their life expectancy.|`|oVz6sPsIaa	The phenomenon is called time dilation and it is a result of the special and general theories of relativity.  There are actually two types of time dilation.  The first is when something goes very fast (like a reasonable fraction of the speed of light).  The second type is called gravitational time dilation.  The more gravity the slower time passes. Both of these are real phenomena and physicists deal with them everyday in laboratory situations with subatomic particles moving fast or things near the surface of gigantic masses like stars and black holes.  An astronaut is affected by both.  He is moving rapidly (but no where near light speed) but he is being affected by less gravity because he is away from the earth's surface.  However, having said all this the effects would be so insignificantly small as to not be measurable under ordinary circumstances.   <br>  <br>  Google 'twin paradox' and 'gravitational time dilation'.|`|nzdDdKtyaa	It might be because of the high amount of oxygen in the air they breath in a plane/spaceship.

OgQ8opeAaa	Marijuana, heroin, and LSD are considered "Schedule I" drugs, meaning they have absolutely no medicinal use and, as such, may not be prescribed under any circumstance.  What the previous poster said is true, in that some doctors in some states can give certain individuals prescriptions for marijuana.  The active ingredient in marijuana (THC) is available in pill form called Marinol and is available to cancer and AIDS patients.<br>  <br>  Cocaine is occasionally used during certain ENT procedures, as it is wonderful local anesthetic and stops blood loss on the mucus membrane it is used on.

The other ones are schedule I drugs and there is no way they can prescribe those, and also there is no way for them to get their hands on them, it is not something that a pharmacy would carry.  There is also no real reason for them.  As far as heroin, there are other drugs similar to prevent pain such as morphine and phetanyl.  LSD really has no medicinal purpose, as well as speed so there is no way that doctors could prescribe those medications.  I hope this answers your question.|`|fshRuXzmaa	A doctor can prescribe drugs, _except_ controlled narcotics.  Heroin, LSD and Speed are controlled narcotics and cannot be prescribed without very close government oversight.  Therefore, the doctor will have to justify _why_ he prescribed these drugs, and in most cases, the prescription _cannot_ be justified.<br>  <br>  Also, your local drugstore does not stock things like Heroin and LSD, so if you have a prescription, where will you get it filled?|`|8V2KIPw3aa	In California, it makes more sense for doctors to recommend medical marijuana use.  No legitimate pharmacy (licensed by the Board of Pharmacy) stocks marijuana since it is still illegal federally, even for medical use, so a prescription wouldn't really mean anything.  <br>  <br>  The law is very tricky because it is okay for patients and their caregivers to possess just enough for the patient's medical use, but obtaining it may be more of a problem.  Many of the "distributers" are being shut down by the DEA, and California law says nothing about how the patients are to come  to possess the marijuana.  It is legal for them to grow a small amount though.   <br>  <br>  In other words, it is legal for the patient/caregiver to possess it, but illegal for someone else to sell it to them (but not illegal for the patient to obtain it or grow it), and all of that is still illegal federally.|`|2JTBPhuuaa	-Marijuana-<br>  Yes, in Calfornia, patients must have medical marijuana cards.<br>  <br>  -Heroin-<br>  Yes, in the UK, heroin is a prescription drug there.

AA12108882	I am afraid you are out of luck. Valuing stones is far more complex than merely looking at a price list, you need to establish if the material has been heated/treated in any way for a start. With rough one has to calculate the cutting yield and assess the colour and clarity of the resulting stones - even slight colour variations can make a huge difference in price and so on and so on.<br>  Your only hope is to take your stones to a professional and swallow the small charge you will have to pay, it will be worth it to have an accurate result.|`|lKcRxJ1Xaa	This is not possible for you to figure a price using online guides.  It takes an expert to determine value as color clarity and treatments are difficult to grade even for an expert.  You can look at ebay and try to find similar stones.

Superstrings have never been seen, but they are theoretically possible.<br>  <br>  As far as the energy needed to make one; you would need the total energy output of 100 Billion stars over 1 year.

So we won't be using one for space travel anytime soon.<br>  <br>  Now to the time travel portion of wormholes; If you could build a wormhole you could fly through, you would travel near (possibly faster) than the speed of light. ToR says time would almost stop for you, so you would travel for 2 days and 1000 years may have passed on Earth.

IsttTBzZaa	Circle diagram of an induction motor is plotted set of lines , arcs, and angles graphically depicting induction motor performance,  derived from simple no-load and locked-rotor tests. A motor's "conventional" efficiency was determined based on four losses only: stator and rotor I2R, core loss, and friction and windage. Each of them could be evaluated with acceptable accuracy from tests without shaft load, through use of a circle diagram. Other than this all operational performances of an induction motor can be calculated by circe diagram without actually loading the machine.You can not count the advantages of the circle diagram only when you use it.

3ZPYB7nxaa	First of all, one needs to know a bit of chemistry to predict what the products of the reactions will be. Everyone probably knows the combustion of C3H6 will create CO2, but H2O is also produced, in the form of steam.     Thus:    C3H6 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O    The equation isn't balanced because there are not equal numbers of atoms on either side of the "->" sign.     Most combustion equations start with the carbon:    C3H6 + O2 -> 3CO2 + H2O    Do the Hydrogen next:    C3H6 + O2 -> 3CO2 + 3H2O    Do the Oxygen last. However, there is an odd number of Oxygen atoms on the right side of the equation. This means:    C3H6 + (4.5)O2 -> 3CO2 + 3H2O    To get everything in terms of whiole numbers, multiply everything by 2:    2C3H6 + 9O2 -> 6CO2 + 6H2O    ///////////////// NEXT    CaO will decompose into Oxygen and Calcium:    CaO -> Ca + O2    This time, balance the Oxygen first:    2CaO -> Ca + O2    The Calcium is now easy to balance:     2CaO -> 2Ca + O2    FYI: The combustion reaction is spontaneous, but the decomposition reaction is not.
PyOCZiwjaa	I don't know if it's the easiest way, and if I still remember how to do this correctly... it's been a while.    first I'd simplify it to  16x3+16*(1/x)    then you have to integrate, which should be  4x^4+16ln(x) (since 1/x integrated to ln(x) last time I did this, and the 16 shouldn't change... i hope...)    now you just sub in 15 and 3  4*14^4+16ln(15)-4*3^4-16ln(3)    I can't guarantee this is right, but I do think it is

So you're basically setting up a system of equations in t(1) and t(2):<br>  <br>  x = 8 - 3/2 t(1)^2 = 8 - 3/2 t(2)^2<br>  y = -3/6 t(1)^3 + 3*t(1) + 1 = -3/6 t(2)^3 + 3*t(2) + 1<br>  <br>  Solve the first equation:<br>  <br>  -3/2 t(1)^2 = -3/2 t(2)^2<br>  t(1)^2 = t(2)^2<br>  t(1) = +/- t(2)<br>  <br>  And substitute into the second:<br>  <br>  -3/6 t(1)^3 + 3t(1) + 1 = 3/6 t(1)^3 - 3t(1) + 1<br>  0 = t(1)^3 - 6t(1)<br>  t(1) * (t(1)^2 - 6) = 0<br>  t(1) = 0, +sqrt(6), -sqrt(6)<br>  t(2) = 0, -sqrt(6), +sqrt(6)<br>  <br>  0 is a trivial solution since we're looking for two different values of t. And the other two solutions turn out to be the same, so the only point of intersection is where t = +/- sqrt(6)<br>  <br>  Substitute in to find the point of intersection: (x,y) = (-1,1).<br>  <br>  At this point, it helps to graph the curve to get an idea of the area you're trying to find. You have one point already (-1,1). And x has an absolute maximum t=0. At t=0, (x,y) is (8,1), and there is nothing more to the right of this point because x is a maximum there.<br>  <br>  There's a local minimum for y at t = -sqrt(2) and a local maximum at t = +sqrt(2). So...<br>  <br>  for t from -sqrt(6) to -sqrt(2), x is increasing, y is decreasing<br>  for t from -sqrt(2) to 0, x is increasing, y is increasing<br>  for t from 0 to +sqrt(2), x is decreasing, y is increasing<br>  for t from +sqrt(2) to +sqrt(6), x is decreasing, y is decreasing<br>  <br>  Also, the values of y for -sqrt(6) < t < 0 are less than the values of y for 0 < t < sqrt(6). This means you can split the loop into two curves, which can be expressed as y1=f1(x) and y2=f2(x), where y1 < y2. Then the area is integral(from -1 to 8) of [ f2(x) - f1(x) ] dx.<br>  <br>  To get y1=f1(x) and y2=f2(x), solve for t in terms of x (you'll have two solutions, one for each curve). Then substitute in for y...

XQdYnndpaa	Okay, it pretty easy. You should know, that the slope intercept form is y=mx+b, where m is slope ( how fast or at what rate something happens) and b y-intercept ( where something starts). So, for 36, we know that Steve starts at 250 dollars. So our b is 250. We know that it costs 2 dollars to make a flower pot, so the slope ( m) is 2. The equation is y= 2x + 250. <br>  <br>  For number 37, its a same process. 25 is where everything starts. Its b, or y-intercept. They have to spend 25, no less. However, they spend 5 on each kid, so that an m, or a rate of change ( slope). So, lets write an equation. y= 5x +25. X, is number of kids. Y is the amount of money they waste. For ex., if you had 5 people at your party, you would have to pay: y=5(5)+25 giving you 50 dollars. in one word, your equation is y=5x+25<br>  <br>  For 32, the rate of change is 5. We can tell this because 5-0=5 and so on. So, our equation is y=5x +0. Notice that b is 0, cause they start at 0.<br>  <br>  For 33, the rate of increase is 4. To prove, -8+4=-4 and -4+4=0<br>  So, the slope is 4. However, the intercept is -8, because thehy start counting at that point. Your equation is y=4x-8<br>  <br>  For 33, the slope is -3. -1-3=-4<br>  So, y=-3x-1. B is -1 because thats wher they start the count<br>  <br>  For 34, the slope is decreasing by 2. So, its -2. The y-inter. is 10, thats where everything starts. So, your answer is y=-2x+10<br>  <br>  For 44, y is greater than -2x-2. Just graph the equation first. On the y- axis ( going vertically) go to -2. Then, move 2 down to -4. Go 1 to the right. That your second point. Repeat the same process. However, this is not over. You have to graph the inequality. So, the line itself is dashed - - - - , and the top part of it ( everything above the line ) is shaded.  M is -2, b is -2<br>   <br>  Advice: Graph the equations at <a href="http://www.ronblond.com/M11/LinIne/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ronblond.com/M11/LinIne/index...</a><br>  When woking on 44 for ex, move the lines and choose the right signs.<br>  <br>  Hope i explained everything...<br>  <br>  54. When y is < or <_, its always below the line. When y is > or >_, its always above.<br>  <br>  53. To find slope, subtract a couple values. Like i did above. For ex, 32:  5-0=5 10-5=5 You can tell the change.<br>  <br>  <br>  Forgot to tell you. ON 46, the line is not dashed. Just regular line. Whenever you have the line underneath the sign, its always the normal line. Whenever you dont have the line underneath, its always dashed. - --- ------- ---- -

First off you need to resolve your qoutient into partial fractions,  i.e.  (s+2) / (s+3)(s^2+5s+4)  note though s^2 + 5s + 4 = (s +1)(s+4)  Hence,  (s+2) / (s+3)(s^2+5s+4) = (s+2)/( (s+3)(s+1)(s+4) )  Thus using Partial Fractions decomposition,  (s+2)/( (s+3)(s+1)(s+4) ) = a/(s + 3) + b/(s + 1) + c/(s +4)  or  (s+2) = a(s+1)(s+4) + b(s+3)(s+4) + c(s+3)(s+1) (which holds for all s)  let s = -1 : -1 + 2 = 0 + b(-2)(-3) + 0  1 = -6b --> b = -1/6  let s = -3 : -3 + 2 = a(-2)(1) + 0 + 0  -1 = -2a --> a = 1/2  let s = -4 : -4 + 2 =  0 + 0 + c( -1)(-3)  -2 = 3c --> c = -2/3  Thus,  (s+2)/( (s+3)(s+1)(s+4) )  = (1/2)(1/(s+3)) - (1/6)(1/(s+1)) - (2/3)(1/(s+4)  Hence,  G(s) = (1/2)(1/(s+3)) - (1/6)(1/(s+1)) - (2/3)(1/(s+4)  Taking the Inverse Laplace Transform,  Inv_L(G(s)) = G(t) = (1/2)inv_L(1/(s+3)) - (1/6)inv_L(1/(s+1)) - (2/3)inv_L(1/(s+4))   G(t) = (1/2)e^(-3t) - (1/6)e^(-t) - (2/3)e^(-4t)    Hope this helps,    David|`|9ddfdc881e051735e1a46a1543e65397aa	i don't know about time domain but the domain of the fuction G(s) is:    R-{-3,-1,-4}
mxqAOxYRaa	In atomic physics, the Bohr model created by Niels Bohr depicts the atom as a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons that travel in circular orbits around the nucleussimilar in structure to the solar system, but with electrostatic forces providing attraction, rather than gravity. This was an improvement on the earlier cubic model (1902), the plum-pudding model (1904), the Saturnian model (1904), and the Rutherford model (1911). Since the Bohr model is a quantum physics-based modification of the Rutherford model, many sources combine the two, referring to the Rutherford-Bohr model.    Introduced by Niels Bohr in 1913, the model's key success lay in explaining the Rydberg formula for the spectral emission lines of atomic hydrogen; while the Rydberg formula had been known experimentally, it did not gain a theoretical underpinning until the Bohr model was introduced. Not only did the Bohr model explain the reason for the structure of the Rydberg formula, but it provided a justification for its empirical results in terms of fundamental physical constants.    The Bohr model is a primitive model of the hydrogen atom. As a theory, it can be derived as a first-order approximation of the hydrogen atom using the broader and much more accurate quantum mechanics, and thus may be considered to be an obsolete scientific theory. However, because of its simplicity, and its correct results for selected systems (see below for application), the Bohr model is still commonly taught to introduce students to quantum mechanics, before moving on to the more accurate but more complex valence shell atom. A related model was originally proposed by Arthur Erich Haas in 1910, but was rejected. The quantum theory of the period between Planck's discovery of the quantum (1900) and the advent of a full-blown quantum mechanics (1925) is often referred to as the old quantum theory.|`|ja2Jx8pUaa	In order to overcome the objections raised  against Rutherfords model of the atom,  Neils Bohr put forward the following  postulates about the model of an atom:  (i) Only certain special orbits known as  discrete orbits of electrons, are allowed  inside the atom.  (ii) While revolving in discrete orbits the  electrons do not radiate energy.  These orbits or shells are called energy  levels.These orbits or shells are represented by  the letters K,L,M,N, or the numbers,  n=1,2,3,4,.
AA11602341	Light behaves as either a particle or a wave like most things physical. It depends on how you want to measure it!    The photoelectric effect shows that light behaves like particles (photons), but refraction shows that light behaves like a wave.    Think of it this way. You can measure something discretely (particles), or continuously (wave). Look at the pictures here:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_si...|`|iaRSSHgDaa	The Laws of Reflection are only constraints on the geometry of how reflection occurs.  What you need to ask yourself is whether those geometrical constraints would apply to both a particle and a wave.  It's easy to demonstrate that a particle will obey the laws: just bounce a basketball to someone.  You can see an equally convincing demonstration of waves obeying the laws when a wave at the beach bounces obliquely against a pier.  Since waves and particles both obey the Laws of Reflection, some other test would be needed to determine the wave versus particle nature of light.
J3TGyOnDaa	Whoa. Before blaming Google Map, do you or your neighbors know exactly where your property lines are? What's the source for the property line data? Are you aware that there is a scale on the bottom left corner of the image. At what scale were you looking at your property. Even more important, do you know approximately when the image was taken. Google map still has images up of my house and neighborhood in Metairie, LA ( a suburb of New Orleans) where one of my neighbors still has a whole blue tarp on the upper half of his roof that faces the street. All that was left of that tarp in the 2007/2008 holiday season was the shreds of the tarp along the ridge line of the roof. Yes, in Google Earth, not Google Map, you MIGHT be able to figure out when the image was taken, but I doubt it, I have over ten years experience in interpreting satellite images and GIS, and even I couldn't tell when the images of my New Orleans house were taken when Google Earth was still working for me.<br>  <br>  Yes, slope does make a difference, but not as much as you seem to be implying.

The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (and various state level quality awards) look to recognize the companies that have the best of the best quality levels in their fields.    Your direct question is on the product quality itself:  Thus, some examples would be:   - how well does the measurement of the plastic item meet the engineering specifications (i.e. physical dimensions, part weight, color, surface texture, shine or not, or has the part shrunk any {many plastic parts tend to expand or shrink as the temperature changes}).   - how well does the part function with its mating parts   - how durable is the plastic part (i.e. will it last for a certain time under normal usage)   - is there anything that could harm a use (i.e. child projection)   - how well does the plastic part work for the customer    There are some of the various things that can be measures to ensure that the quality of the plastic part will meet the customer expectations of the intended use.

You have 8.78g in 65g water What mass in 1000g?  1000/65*8.78 = 135.077g per 1000g   This solution reduced the freezing point to -0.375C  1 mol would have reduced the freezing point to -1.86C   Therefore molar mass = 1.86/0.375 * 135.077 = 669.982g/mol  This result is dependant on the solute not ionising.|`|bQ36mdBdaa	The formula you need to use is:  deltaTf = Kf * mb    In which deltaTf is the difference in freezing temperature between the solution and pure water, and mb is the molality (moles of solute per kg of solvent).    deltaTf = 0.375 C  Kf = 1.86  mb = X/0.065  [X being the number of moles of solute]    0.375 = 1.86 * X / 0.065  X = 0.013    Now we know that 0.013 moles if the stuff weigh 8.78 g.  So the molar mass is: 8.78/0.013 = 675.38 g/mol

ApG0DpzXaa	It reinforces the notion that a child is to be shaped to the parent's plan for it.  Parents can inflict tremendous misery on children who do not develop in ways that are 'expected'.  Think of the stereotypic intellectual/artistic child being pressured to be a football star by a jock oriented family, or a physical girl being pressured to be 'ladylike' and not get dirty or break fingernails when she wants to rockclimb. <br>  <br>  A baby is not an object to be 'designed' because the personality cannot be designed and the personality is far more important than the appearance.<br>  <br>  Now for the other side of the arguement.  There are horrible heart breaking diseases out there which can be avoided by genetic selection.  I'm an RN.  I've watched patients die of Huntington's Chorea, and of Myotonic Dystrophy.  These are slow horrible ends.<br>  If I was at risk of having a child with one of the many many genetic diseases (another words if I or my partner was a carrier of the "bad" gene) I would not hesitate one second to sign up for a way to avoid such a tragedy and select for a healthy child.<br>  <br>  Laws are a blunt instrument.  They cannot be written to cover slim differences in situations.  I do not believe a law could be safely written to stop cosmetic genetic selection and still allow selection to ensure healthy babies.  How does a law tell if the parents are selecting the sex of their child so they can enter her in baby beauty pagents or if they're avioding boys to avoid expression of an x-linked gene in a sex linked disease carrier mom? This is a situation where less is more and legislation is to be avoided.  Social/community opinion pressure will have to suffice.|`|fRRTvReDaa	it would mean people are becoming more and more "superficial" but their argument could then be "society is already superficial and we dont want our kids to miss out so we want a design-a-baby to ensure he/she has a successful future"<br>  then youll get the religious groups come out and chuck a spastic saying we are not "God" to be choosing how the baby should look and that we should leave it upto God and not interfere (then the people who are up for design-a-babies could argue that if God didnt want people to use their brains and help technology advance to such an extent, HE would have never given them the ability to do such things)<br>  <br>  THEN youll get all these other people, especially mothers who did not have this option from before, argue that it is cruel and that you should love your children the way they are and not feel the need to alter how they look.<br>  <br>  basically... everyone will have a new excuse to bite each others heads off. and yes...the society is already superficial..and its only getting worse... and design-a-babies will add immensely to that... but then again its true - these days - to survive in a superficial society - not the country sides or villages or quiet towns where everyone still has morals and what not, actual superficial societies, you have to be just like them or you get left behind.<br>  <br>  if the government bans it in one country...im sure that will make room for even more illegal work to go on where ppl will be going overseas paying ridiculous amounts of money to get it done etc. itll be like a design your own baby in the blackmarket type thingy.<br>  But then if it allows it - all the religious and what not groups will sook and whinge and protest and what not... i dont think the governments would allow it everywhere though.

eded36129e5a615b93f2c19eb0ccd044aa	I think your question is, "How does a calculator calculate the sine, cosine or tangent of an angle?"<br>  <br>  They don't use a single formula, they use an algorithm that gives the desired degree of accuracy (to a certain number of decimals as chosen by the manufacturer of the calculator).<br>  <br>  You have to express the angle in radians to make the formula work.  Here is an example.<br>  <br>  sin(x) = x - x^3/3! + x^5/5! - x^7/7! + ...<br>  cos(x) = 1 - x^2/2! + x^4/4! - x^6/6! + ...<br>  <br>  When the calculation is done, it can be converted from radians to degrees if desired.<br>  <br>  Here is a link that explains it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/sine_calculator.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/s...</a><br>  <br>  If you want the angle instead, work backwards.|`|AxlFcjZoaa	it is like that    angle  inclosed by two sides is computed in a right angled triangle. it is basic of trigonometry. if x is angle  then sinx  (read as sine of angle x) =  length of base /length of hypot.   here x is  included angle between base and hypot. of right  triangle. what u get  in calculator is throgh sine,cosine,tangent ratios<br>   need further .email to  get concept.it is safe .|`|K9Mn7UnZaa	Alright, what your calculator is doing is converting a ratio of the lengths of sides of a triangle to an angle in degrees. There isn't a simple explicit formula that you could use to make the same calculation - it's much simple to let the calculator handle the specifics.<br>  <br>  Basically, the tangent function take the slope (rise over run, opposite over adjacent, etc.) of a line, and converts it into an angle. As long as your calculator is in degrees mode, that answer will be in degrees. It should make sense if you compare it to your understanding of angles (where 90 is a right angle). If you look at the triangle you gave an example for, you should see that the angle is roughly two-thirds that of a right (perpendicular) angle. That's all the function does.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you want to arithmetically perform the same calculation, the formula (in radians, NOT degrees!) is something like x + x^3/3 + 2x^5/15 + 17x^7/315 + ..., which is called a Taylor Power series expansion, and is something you'll learn about in calculus.|`|Ujvla6Uiaa	sure do. that number is just the angel between those two sides. what you are talking about is something known as the sine, cosine, tangent rules.<br>  <br>  in this case you are talking about the tangent.

Essentially, if you sum up an infinite number of terms of a Taylor polynomial, the value generated from the polynomial is very similar to the exact answer. Your calculator simply plugs in the number you provide into a certain amount of terms of the appropriate Taylor Series, and prints the result. The more terms, the more accurate the result. Then if you want the angle, the calculator simply works backward.|`|nRupb7k7aa	you really do not need to know how the calculator gets the 61.82751<br>  Tan or tangent is the ratio of the adjacent and opposite side in a right triangle|`|r2gybx5haa	Think of tangent as a number and try to remember some important  values like tan (0 degree) =0 , tan (45deg)=1. The calculator get the value 61.92 by the function arctan. Probably it does this by a look up table or some algorithm. In short, given y =tan(x) , then x = arctan(y) , or in some calculator, it is labeled tan^(-1) (y). Arctan(y) is a function that finds the angle given the tangent value.<br>    So , arctan (1) = pi/4 = 45 degrees.<br>  Pay attention to the unit, some calculator gives in degrees or radians depends on your settings.
VygxsVEGaa	You should know this, but just in case, exponents can be expressed in regular text with carets ( ^ ). Also, the order of solving in math can be remembered as PEMDAS:<br>  <br>  Parentheses (do things in parentheses first. Follow PEMDAS inside parentheses as well. If there are parentheses inside parentheses, do the things in the inside set first)<br>  <br>  Exponents (then multiply out exponents)<br>  <br>  Multiplication/Division (go through the expression/equation from left to right, doing all the multiplication and division operations)<br>  <br>  Addition/Subtraction (go through again, this time doing addition and subtraction)<br>  <br>  In addition, if there are just two variables or other numbers right up against each other, this indicates multiplication without any symjbols needed. XY indicates multiplying X and Y, and so does X(Y).<br>  <br>  As I do these examples, I will group things with parentheses to avoid confusion. Some of the extra grouping is unnecessary when writing out by hand, but I will do it here as I type. Sorry about the large numbers of parentheses. As to their relationship to PEMDAS, with the associative properties of multiplication and addition, the expressions within the extra parentheses can be broken apart.<br>  <br>  Another just-in-case: only like terms can be multiplied, divided, added, or subtracted. <br>  <br>  1. -(-8)^ -2<br>  negative powers are equivalent to a 1 divided by the positive equivalent of the negative power. If x is some number, x^ -2 (x to the negative second power) is equal to 1/x^2. Therefore:<br>  <br>  -(-8)^ -2 = -(1/(-8)^2) = -(1/64) = -1/64<br>  <br>  2. (-4x)^3<br>  The third power is distributed to both the -4 and the x within the parentheses, so:<br>  <br>  (-4x)^3 = (-4)^3 * (x)^3 = -64 * x^3 = -64x^3<br>  <br>  3. 2(4x)^2<br>  Distribute the exponent, then multiply out as normal.<br>  <br>  2(4x)^2 = 2 * (4)^2 * (x)^2 = 2 * 16 * x^2 = 32x^2<br>  <br>  4. -5 (-9x)^ -2 = -5 (1/(-9x)^2) = -5 (1/(81 * x^2)) = -5 (1/(81x^2)) = -5 /(81x^2)<br>  <br>  5. When there are exponents of fractions, simply do the exponent operations on the numerator (top) and denominator (bottom) separately, then put them back together into fraction form. When multiplying fractions together, do the same thing: separate the fractions into numerators and denominators, multiply, then put them back together.<br>  <br>  (3/2)((3/4)x)^2 = (3/2) * (3/4)^2 * (x)^2 = (3/2) * (3^2)/(4^2) * x^2 = (3/2)(9/16)x^2 = (3*9)/(2*16)x^2 = (27/32)x^2<br>  <br>  6. (-2x^-3y^10)^2(3x^19y^3)<br>  This looks intimidating, but is easy once broken down. When multiplying variables that have exponents, add the exponents together. When there is an exponent of an exponent, such as (x^2)^3, multiply the two exponents, which in this case gives x^6.<br>  <br>  (-2)^2 (x^-3)^2 (y^10)^2 (3x^19y^3) = (4)(x^-6)(y^20)(3)(x^19)(y^3) = (4*3)(x^-6*x^19)(y^20*y^3) = (12)(x^13)(y^23) = 12 x^13 y^23<br>  <br>  7. (x^9y^4)^2 = (x^9)^2 * (y^4)^2 = x^18 y^8<br>  <br>  8. (x^4) / (x^2)<br>  When dividing numbers/variables/constants/whatever that have exponents, subtract the denominator's exponent from the numerator's exponent.<br>  <br>  (x^4) / (x^2) = x^2<br>  <br>  9 & 10. You should be able to do these on your own from what I have told you for 1-8. A reminder: in case you don't know how to deal with stacked fractions, x / (y / z)  = xz / y. Flip the z up past two fraction bars. However, (x / y) / z = x / yz - multiply the two denominators. x, y, and z can represent anything. <br>  <br>  Here are the answers for checking yourself against.<br>  <br>  9.

AA10297143	The release of ink is done for evasion purposes, to protect them from predators and therefore not becoming dinner for something bigger than they are.<br>  <br>  An octopus’ “ink” serves three important purposes.Most - but not all - octopus species come equipped with an “ink sac” that spews out a stream of dark liquid into the water when the creature is threatened. When frightened, an octopus often “swallows” water with its body and ejects it forcefully. This not only propels the animal away from the danger, but also forces out a trail of “ink.” This ink, which may be red, brown, or black, is made of melanin, the same dark pigment that colors human skin and hair. The ink’s effects are three-fold: First, the initial “jet” of ink visually distracts, confuses, and perhaps even frightens the predator. Secondly, it may interfere with the predator’s sense of smell or sight. And third, once dispersed, the ink clouds the water to help give the octopus time to escape.|`|2nqmoerIaa	protection <br>  <br>  <br>  Dom K|`|CuMYdQV6aa	The ink released by an octopus does form a cloud behind which it can escape from predators.

AA10335036	Gradient means rate of change of something divided by rate of change of something else. In a heat conductor, this is the temperature difference divided by the distance it is measured over. A high ratio means a big temperature difference over a short distance, just what you want in insulation. A low ratio means the opposite, just what you want in a steam radiator.  Note that temp. gradient refers to an object (like an area of insulation) and is not a way to rate conductivity of a material, since gradient with a constant temp. difference changes with the length of the conductor. Temp. conductivity is a material-only rating that is independent of size or shape of the object.|`|AA11602341	The temperature gradient is the difference in temperature between the conductor and it's surroundings. A good conductor would have a very small temperature gradient compared to a poor conductor due to the lack of resistance of heat transfer.|`|pyOLICfSaa	well gradient means a slope in the graph, so high gradient is a good metal conductor.    Well, Ithink???...|`|xbma9SuWaa	If you have took a thermometer and measured the temperature at each position in a room you would have found what is called the scalar temperature field.      If there was a fire place in the room you would see that the temparture increased as you got closer to the fireplace.   This is what is meant by gradient the change in the value of the temperature with respect to position.   Once you have found the gradient you now have a direction that you had to go and the magnitude of the temperature in order to get to the fireplace.  In other words you have a vector showing you the direction of the increase (In this case) of temperature.   This vector is proportional to a term known as "heat flow".      Note:  The gradient of any scalar field will result in a vector field.

K79UmW7Uaa	Cats are very territorial animals, especially un-neutered males. He should be around your area so as to protect his territory from intruding cats. <br>  <br>  Perhaps there is a larger, meaner cat in your area that has succeeded in chasing him off. He may also have been taken to the shelter by someone- yes, surprisingly some people don't know better and take cats they find outside to the shelter. Maybe he's been killed by the elements (it's been rather cold), hit by a car, or eaten by some larger animal (dog, fox, coyote). <br>  <br>  Check your local shelters just in case. Of all the cats taken to the shelter, only about 2% are reunited with their original owners, simply because the cats don't have collars/tags and because people don't think to look in the shelter. Even indoor cats escape from time to time, so it's a good idea to either get them microchipped or collared so they don't get snatched up and sent to the pound.<br>  <br>  If your cat's an outdoor cat: Keep in mind that cats (and dogs) are DOMESTICATED animals, meaning they lack adaptations necessary for successful survival in the non-domestic outside world. They lack these proper outdoor survival traits because over thousands of years we have bred them to be our pets and to depend on us for survival. We did not breed them to live as wild animals.. seriously, that would be pointless.<br>  <br>  Also, unless you are a liscenced breeder (and clearly you're not because liscenced breeders keep meticulous tabs on their animals), it is your responsibility not to allow your pet to mate. In the U.S. alone, about 9.6 MILLION shelter cats and dogs are euthanized EACH YEAR. Too many animals, not enough homes. Even if you found "homes" for your resulting kittens, you'd have to make sure those people weren't going to later change their minds and send them off to the shelter. <br>  <br>  As for those who wish to impregnate an animal so that their kids may "experience the miracle of birth", they should right afterwards, take their kids to the local shelter so that they may rightfully experience the "miracle" of death which they have just added to.<br>  <br>  A tid bit about general shelter euthanasia::: because shelters are so overwhelmed and recieve more animals than they can deal with, they do not have the resources (time/$$) to humanely administer an injection to individual animals. Instead, becuase there are so many animals to get rid of at each shelter, cats and dogs are crammed together into wire crates which are then placed into a slot that releases deadly gasses. This gas form of euthanasia takes up to 15 minutes to kill an animal. Sometimes this does not kill an animal the first go-round and they have to be put in again, still crammed into the wire crate with the other already dead animals. <br>  <br>  Some shelter animals are also sent to labs to be used as test subjects.<br>  <br>  Such sad fates we deal to so-called "man's best friend".|`|LSxBwiFSaa	For What ? -So He can get fixed by the Vet ?!

(In real life, A often has a weak dependence on T).    If the rate goes up by a factor of 10 when T goes from 303K to 333 K, we have:    Rate = A*exp(-E/(R*303K))    and     10*Rate = A*exp(-E/(R*333K))    Equate the Rate between the two equations:    exp(-E/(R*303K)) = (1/10)*exp(-E/(R*333K))    Take the log of both sides:    -E/303K = -R*ln(10) -E/333K    E*(1/303K - 1/333K) = R*ln(10)    2.973*10^-4 * E = 19.144 J/mol    E = 64.4 kJ/mol|`|a4edf2e40162015de63a4dff47980bbbaa	You should have run into an equation that relates the ratio of two rate constants to two temperatures and the activation energy.

State's rights based on the 10th amendment.  2. Laws being made in Washington that favored industrial states to the detriment of agricultural states.  3. The central federal government was operating in violation of their Constitutional mandate.  4. Lincoln was America's first dictator (began the war between the states with the first 'executive order', thus abrogating the authority of the Constitution which required a vote of congress to go to war)    Don't get me wrong.  Slavery was the reason many of the southern states seceded from the union.  Strengthening the Constitution (whose authority derives from the concept that 'all men are created equal') makes it difficult to support an economy enriched by slavery.  So staying in the union was a lose/lose proposition for states favoring the status quo of the perpetuation of slavery.    Southern ideologues maintain to this day that the predominant issue for the southern states was "states rights", but they wanted 'state's rights' in the absence of the equality between races that is the philosophical basis for all arguments posed in the Declaration of Independence in the establishment of America.    Lincoln's war of agression could have been averted by either side.  The north could have ended the constitutional abuses and corruption that had crept in, and the south could have abandoned slavery and pulled the populist support rug right out from under Lincoln.  Either solution would have reconciled the two sides.  Pride and greed was the ultimate reason for that tragic bloody conflict.

The air handler is a big fan and control that moves air through the unit so that the temperature of the house or whatever will be affected by the heat pump    Think of an air conditioner. The air conditioner makes one thing cool at the expense of making something else hot. That is the heat pump part. But an air conditioner also has a fan to blow the cool air into the room. That's the air handler. Without the air handler, the coolness produced by the air conditioner would stay very close to the air conditioner.

That rules out anteaters which are not rodents. I can't think of one specifically with a long tongue because rodents are knawers and don't use their tongues much.  Are you sure it's a rodent? The only commonality between lemurs and raccoons is that ringtails have striped tails. Some ground squirrels have striped tails although i can't recall any specifically similar to the striping of a raccoon.

DO1ebm95aa	The control is typically when you compare something that got a treatment to something that didn't get a treatment.  Like medicine versus no medicine when you look at who got better.  A control answers the question "does X make something happen?".  You try X and you try your control, which is fake X, and if the results are the same, then X has no effect, or if there is an effect, then you conclude that X makes something happen.    Your experiment is a little different--it's more comparative.  You're not asking "Does Coke make you happy"; you're asking "which makes you happier, Coke or Pepsi?".  So since you're just comparing a response to two things, I'd say you don't really have a control.  But since you probably need to answer that question for your school project, I think you should probably say that the generic soda is your control.  In the future, however, you can set up your experiment from the beginning so that you can answer those questions easier (or you can just reword your question).  Pick a research question that fits the standard experiment model that you're being graded on.  Such as: "Do people like brand name sodas better than generics?".  Now, generic is definitely your control!  Sometimes it's just a matter of rewording your question, sometimes it's a matter of designing your experiment.    Not sure exactly what you mean by absolute and relative.  Absolute usually refers to numbers that stand alone--such as height, age, temperature, or even a 1-10 scale, etc.  Relative is stuff like "better" or "worse", or any comparison number, such as 20% more, or 10 feet higher, or something.

id1g6blsaa	Here's a start on the problem:    Instead of 1,2,3,...n it will be easier to work with if we have 0,1,2,...n-1. You can always add 1 back in later. Then everything is done mod n. Now A^m is the permutation that sends i to i+m (mod n).    The cycles referred to in 1) are (all additions done mod n)    0 -> m -> 2m -> ... (q-1)m    1 ->(m+1) -> (m+2) -> ...(q-1)m+1    etc.    2) isn't stated correctly since m does not appear on the right side. I think it should be k+m mod n.    3) is true because i, i+m, i+2m, ... can only repeat after n steps since n is prime.

bHPB2CuUaa	There is a limit on the low end, in terms of frequency: 0 Hz. This would be infinite wavelength, and zero energy photons. No limit on the high end known. After gamma rays, some say cosmic rays, but it is really just a matter of assigning energy to the photon, usually measured in electron volts. High energy photons can be 100 keV (X-rays), 1-500 MeV (gamma), etc. The energy is obtained by taking the frequency and multiplying by Plancks constant: E = hv, where E is the energy, h is Plancks constant, and v (supposed to be nu) is the frequency of the photon.|`|MZbxHhOsaa	Technically, all photons are the same "size" as in they don't have any size, they are point like objects. The wavelength is a probability distribution, (where you are likly to find the photon). So on the low end, you have zero frequency photons, or ones with infinite wavelength (means they are equally likely to be found anywhere) On the high end, (anything past a certain level is called Gamma) becasue of E=MC^2, if you keep increasing the photon's waveLength, it will eventually collapse into a blackhole (when it's "mass" creates a event horizon one planck distance away)  It will then very quickly "evaporate" into lower energy particles. I have not worked out the math as to how high the energy must be, but i'm sure it is way above the scales of anything we deal with. <br>  Hope this helps

k5Ece8BTaa	There is no accurate proof that the world is ending in 2012.<br>  <br>  This scam about the world ending in 2012 isn't true. It's all just a silly hoax. It maybe true that that mayan calendar ends but, it doesn't mean the world is going to end. One of several Mayan calendars is the Long Count calendar, which is reset to day 0 every 1,872,000 days or 7057.5 years. The next reset date, by some calculations, is December 21, 2012. This is not a prediction of the end of the world. The Mayan Calendar has to end sometime. Besides, nobody can't predict when the end of the world is. You shouldn't always believe what you hear from other people. The scientific evidence about 2012 doesn't go together. Those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what is sad, people may commit suicide over this thinking its the end of the world. Or maybe some people would get unwise with their money and spend it all like crazy and be in thousands of dollars in debt, just because they thought the world would end. Then they have to pay it off later and deal with the stress of those bills. That's why those who spread rumors about 2012 should be punished. You know what else is false about this 2012 garbage? <br>  <br>  ? Planet X (Nibiru) isn't going to hit the Earth it doesn't exist.<br>  ? Poles are switching everyday, this isn't going to happen all in just 1 day. This process takes thousands of years. Throughout geological history there has been may pole switches and life has still survived.<br>  ? Also people are saying these poles will switch in one day due to a black hole. That's NOT true. The nearest black hole to our galaxy is 1600 light years away.<br>  ? Sun will be lined up with a sunspot, but it doesn't mean it will wipe out all life on Earth. One time ago, Earth was lined up with a sunspot and people were on it and everybody didn't just die.<br>  ? There is not going to be catasphoic earthquakes. <br>  ? No coment will hit Earth or asteriods.<br>  ? These cultures such as the Japanese, Mayans, Japanese or whoever didn't predict such a thing. As I just said, this is just a scam to make money off of ignorant people who don't look at the facts.<br>  ? If you have been watching the Hysteria Chanel about 2012 or anything like that, all they are just trying to do is scare people so they can make money.<br>  <br>  Each time the end the world is predicted. They are always wrong. Here are all the predictions of when the world would end and each time they where wrong. Every year there is a prediction like this. I'm sure that if 2012 doesn't happen, they will think of something else. Through out history the end has been predicted but has never happened.|`|XukScWE3aa	The world ends for some thing ever second.

However, since the atmosphere on Mars is incredibly thin (less than 1% of sea level pressure on Earth) it doesn't do this very well.  Mars also receives a lot less solar radiation, because it is considerably farther from the Sun (228 million km vs 150 million km for Earth).|`|vMR0IqNCaa	the earth reflects the heat back into the sky at a different frequency so the CO2 reflects the heat back because of mars placement and surface it reflects the heat back at a different frequency which the CO2 doesn't stop|`|AFqZEOlRaa	Neither.

Og6XiYFoaa	for the dna polymerase to replicate the dna, it first has to read the dna, and then add the complementary nucleotide(write). dna is replicated(read) by the dna polymerase in the 3'-5' direction. however it is written 5'-3'. you are correct in that the 3' OH group is necessary for the formation of the phosphodiester(pd)  bond. the pd bond forms the backbone of the dna molecule whereas the nucleotides (think about the double stranded configuration of dna here) stretch across the helix and form hydrogen bonds with the complementary strand.  the Phosphodiester bond in your picture is the Phosphorus(P) bound to 2 carbons through ester bondage(the O's) since there is 2 bonds with the 2 Oxygens, then its di-ester.   the whole idea of reading 3-5 and writing 5-3 is confusing at first but if you sit down and draw out dna(just two parallel lines) and practice labeling which way replication is occuring it makes this a whole lot easier to think about.  <br>  the dna polymerase also has the ability to "proofread" what it has written, when it does this, it can reverse its direction by one nucleotide and correct its mistake, this is called exonuclease activity.|`|bKfAte8aaa	This link here shows where the Phosphodiester bond is:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphodiester_bond" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphodies...</a><br>  <br>  And as far as the directionality DNA uses DNA polymerase to create the new DNA base pairing.<br>    [If an error is made] ..."

Heonb5DDaa	I first would like to say that I am a Christian. I believe that God created the heavens and the earth(Genesis 1:1). I believe that Jesus was born, lived, and died for your sins and mine (John 3:16). I am also a scientist. I am in my final year of undergrad studies in biological sciences at Chicago State University. One thing I can say about God is that he has no beginning and no ending (Revelations 1:8). He will last from everlasting to everlasting. WE as humans made up time. We said that the day will begin and end from sunrise until sunrise again, who knows if God intended it to be that way. With that being said a vague and ambiguous definition of evolution is "a change over time." Evolution is driven by changes in the environment in which a particular organism lives in.  Organism who possess certain traits which are suitable to a particular environment pass those favorable genes on to their offspring.  I do believe that organisms change over millions and millions of years. I believe that the humans we are today are not the same as we were millions of years ago. I believe the earth has change and is continuing to change. But one thing I also understand is that the God I serve is complex; that somethings can not be explained even by science, and I am fine with that. I hope I answered your question and made you a little more comfortable with the theory of evolution.  It is not meant to undermine creationism, nor is it meant to be blasphemous, it is merely a scientific observation of how organisms change over time and how those changes effect the populations as a whole.<br>  <br>  Sidebar: I hate when people just copy and paste answers!!!|`|Ok55QNSiaa	Well evolution is like when something grows in a certain degree like turning into a more mature stage like how many thinks humans came from apes by evolution into smarter beings.

We use it in general language when referring to such things as "the evolution of the Italian language", "the evolution of Thomas Jefferson's philosophy", "the evolution of the Roman Empire", etc.<br>  <br>  But in the science of Biology it has a very specific meaning ... the slow change in a *population* (usually a species).  We use this to disguish between the slow change in a *group* of organisms from the change of an individual during its lifetime ... which we call "growth" or "development."<br>  <br>  When web sites give technical, genetic definitions ... such as "change in the allele frequencies" ... or  "change in genetic composition of a population" (biologyonline.org) ... or "change in the inherited traits of a population" (wikipedia) ... these are all just more technical ways of saying "slow change in a population" ... we *measure* that change in the way that the genetics change.<br>  <br>  So ANY "slow change" to the genetics of a population IS EVOLUTION ... PERIOD.<br>  <br>  <br>  Evolution does NOT just mean 'the change of one species into another.'  That is one possible outcome of evolution ... but that is NOT what evolution means.  For example, a kind of flu virus developing immunity to last-year's flu shot IS evolution. Period.   A strain of bacteria developing immunity to antibiotics IS evolution.  Period.   A type of insect developing immunity to pesticides IS evolution.  Period.  A breed of dog (the "cocker spaniel") being bred to have more and more floppy ears IS evolution.  Period.   <br>  <br>  If the population is *changing*, that is evolution, *BY DEFINITION*.  Period.<br>  <br>  So 'Katie E' and 'blue s' do NOT understand what the word 'evolution' means ... which unfortunately is typical of people who reject it.<br>  <br>  People who deny that evolution occurs are basically denying that species change!  Either that, or they are trying to *REDEFINE* the word 'evolution' away from the way *BIOLOGISTS* use the word.  They redefine it as "that part of it that I disagree with" ... which is why they try to REDEFINE 'evolution' to mean *only* the species-to-species part.  They are just trying to *REDEFINE* the term in a way that makes no sense ... so that they feel justified in rejecting it.<br>  <br>  Why do they do this?  Because so many good Christians are told from a *very* early age that evolution (whatever it is) is contrary to Christian faith ... which is just NOT TRUE.   But if you have been told that evolution=atheism long before anybody ever explained what evolution *is* ... then you will grow up with a distorted, incorrect understanding of evolution in order to justify your rejection of it!<br>  <br>  <br>  Please remember that in science, it is really, really, really important to *UNDERSTAND* a concept first, before you decide whether you accept or reject it ... i.e. UNDERSTAND a concept first, before you decide whether you BELIEVE it.   Always, always, always.  <br>  <br>  Science is about understanding *BEFORE* belief.     <br>  <br>  That is such a key part of understanding science, that it is impossible to understand science without it.<br>  <br>  Understanding BEFORE belief.<br>  ------------------- ------------- -------|`|nXSpS3Axaa	In biology, evolution is change in the inherited traits of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. These changes are caused by a combination of three main processes: variation, reproduction, and selection. Genes that are passed on to an organism's offspring produce the inherited traits that are the basis of evolution. These traits vary within populations, with organisms showing heritable differences in their traits. When organisms reproduce, their offspring may have new or altered traits. These new traits arise in two main ways: either from mutations in genes, or from the transfer of genes between populations and between species. In species that reproduce sexually, new combinations of genes are also produced by genetic recombination, which can increase variation between organisms. Evolution occurs when these heritable differences become more common or rare in a population.<br>  <br>  Two major mechanisms drive evolution. The first is natural selection, a process causing heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common in a population, and harmful traits to become more rare. This occurs because individuals with advantageous traits are more likely to reproduce, so that more individuals in the next generation inherit these traits. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment.<br>  <br>  The second major mechanism driving evolution is genetic drift, an independent process that produces random changes in the frequency of traits in a population. Genetic drift results from the role probability plays in whether a given trait will be passed on as individuals survive and reproduce. Though the changes produced in any one generation by drift and selection are small, differences accumulate with each subsequent generation and can, over time, cause substantial changes in the organisms. This process can culminate in the emergence of new species. Indeed, the similarities between organisms suggest that all known species are descended from a common ancestor (or ancestral gene pool) through this process of gradual divergence.<br>  <br>  Evolutionary biologists document the fact that evolution occurs, and also develop and test theories that explain its causes. The study of evolutionary biology began in the mid-nineteenth century, when studies of the fossil record and the diversity of living organisms convinced most scientists that species changed over time.However, the mechanism driving these changes remained unclear until the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, detailing the theory of evolution by natural selection. Darwin's work soon led to overwhelming acceptance of evolution among scientists. In the 1930s, Darwinian natural selection was combined with Mendelian inheritance to form the modern evolutionary synthesis,which connected the units of evolution (genes) and the mechanism of evolution (natural selection). This powerful explanatory and predictive theory directs research by constantly raising new questions, and it has become the central organizing principle of modern biology, providing a unifying explanation for the diversity of life on Earth

3ZPYB7nxaa	First, write the formulas of the reactants:<br>  <br>  Calcium nitrate = Ca(NO3)2<br>  Sodium oxalate = Na2C2O4<br>  <br>  It takes a bit of understanding about chemistry to predict what happens next. The most important is valence. Calcium has a valence of +2. The nitrate ion has a valence of -1. This explains why the calcium needs two nitrate groups to balance its valence of +2.  The same is true of Sodium oxalate. Sodium has a valence of +1 and the oxalate ion has a valence of -2.<br>  <br>  One other thing which knowing chemistry helps with is the fact the oxalate ion combines with Calcium to form an insoluble salt known as Calcium oxalate. The formula will of course be CaC2O4, since one ion has a valence of -2 and the other +2. Knowing all these things, the equation becomes:<br>  <br>  Ca(NO3)2 + Na2C2O4 -> 2NaNO3 + CaC2O4<br>  <br>  "2" was placed to the left of the NaNO3 because there are two Sodium ions and two nitrate ions. The NaNO3 is actually dissolved as ions, Na(+) and NO3(-) while the calcium oxalate is a solid and does not form any ions.|`|Y4YuOenwaa	Ca(NO3)2 + Na2C2O4 >> CaC2O4 + 2 NaNO3

Now I'm glad I did!|`|AA11560434	I love it overall.  (I'm doing the equivalent of A/AS Chemistry in the first year).  Probably the only part of it I dont particularly like is organic chemistry.|`|ziZpamVuaa	i'm taking it now, I don't really like it but I find some aspects of it interesting.
AA11560434	This question is a bit confusing, but if u mean why does the melting and boiling points of S, P and Cl exhibit the trend they do, I would first like to say that the two points DECREASE across S to P to Cl.<br>  <br>  Now for the explanation.  Solid sulphur (I'm Jamaican, so bear with me on the "ph" instead of "f") contains molecules of S8.  These are stable molecules that have rather strong dispersion forces (forces that occur when electrons in a molecule or noble gas atom move to one side of the molecule or noble gas atom, giving it, for a moment, a positive and negative charge, which induces a similar charge difference in another noble gas atom or molecule, allowing the molecules or noble gas atoms to attract) between each other due to the large number of electrons in each molecule (there are 16 electrons in each S atom in the S8 molecule; do the math).  For this reason, sulphur has a relatively high melting point and boiling point.<br>  <br>  Then there's P (phosphorus).  In white phosphorus, the most common form of solid phosphorus, there are molecules of P4.  Since P4 has less electrons than S8 (15 electrons in each P atom; once again, do the math), the dispersion forces between the P4 molecules are considerably weaker than between S8 molecules.  Hence, white phosphorus melts and boils at a lower temperature than sulphur.<br>  <br>  (A side-note if you're interested: unlike sulphur, the tetrahedral shape (pyramid-like if you dont know what that means) of the P4 molecule causes the bonds between the P atoms to be strained.  A little bombardment by atoms or molecules around P4, and these bonds snap like a rubber band.  That explains why white phosphorus bursts into flames in open air.)<br>  <br>  Finally, we come to chlorine.  Unlike the other two (solids), chlorine is a GAS at room temperature.  Hence, it has a even LOWER melting and boiling point than sulphur and phosphorus.  Again, it's because of dispersion forces.  The dispersion forces between Cl molecules (Cl2 to be exact) are even weaker than  those between P4 molecules, again because the number of electrons in each Cl2 molecule is considerably less than that in each P4 molecule.  Hence, it takes even less heat to melt and boil chlorine.

1kz1X1Xtaa	Alvin G is incorrect. Sexual reproduction is a benefit because it allows for a variation of species. Meiosis produces 4 different gametes, but if all of them were identical not one could survive and avoid extinction(Darwin's law of Natural Selection). So sexual reproduction by meiosis is beneficial because if a mutant strain or some type of pathogen is introduced, the organism is able to survive due to the different gametes.|`|KuSxKsKHaa	How? well sexual reproduction by meiosis turns a regular somatic cell (2n) into half the chromosomes (n) yielding a grand total of four haploid (n) unidentical daughter cells. Meiosis divides TWICE, the second division is known as Meiosis II (go figure).<br>  <br>  The contribute to the growth/surivival of the organism in that they allow the organism to continue reproducing which eventually leads to evolution.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|GbMAEXq3aa	ALVIN G SUMMED IT UP PERFECTLY AND BASICALLY IF MEIOSIS DOESN'T OCCUR, GAMETES WONT BE MADE, THUS DISCONTINUING THE GROWTH, SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION OF HUMAN LIFE.
NIyyDwNVaa	Advantages are that it provides organisms with a chance to shuffle their genetic material so life isn't so mundane lol. Through crossing over and separation of chromosomes meiosis can provide haploid organisms with possible genetic variance which might help them survive a radical change in environment.<br>  <br>  Limitation is that you need a mate (or two sets of gonads); and obviously for humans that's not such a huge limitation but think about fish in the dark deep regions of the sea; some male fish just attach on to their female fish for life to provide reproductive success.

So this equation is represented like this:<br>  29 x + 34 y = 12685<br>  <br>  Now lets put the two equations together by using the substitution method.<br>  <br>  1st equation  ----> x + y = 400<br>  2nd equation ----> 29 x + 34 y = 12685<br>  <br>  Change the 1st equation to: x = 400 - y<br>  Now substitute this answer for "x" in the 2nd equation.<br>  <br>  29 x + 34 y = 12685<br>  29 (400 - y) + 34 y = 12685 (Now solve for "y")<br>  11600 - 29 y + 34 y - 12685 (get like terms together)<br>  11600 + 5 y = 12685 (move the 11600 to the 12685)<br>  5y = 12685 - 11600 (subtract)<br>  5y = 1085 (divide by 5)<br>  y = 217<br>  <br>  Now substitute this answer for "y: in the NEW 1st equation<br>   x = 400 - y<br>  x = 400 - 217<br>  x = 183<br>  <br>  Answer: 183 jerseys sold for $29 and  217 sold for $39.

K6QlFoo0aa	You have written an inequality in your question.  That is not the same thing as an equation.<br>  <br>  However, I will do two things for you.<br>  <br>  First I will pretend that it is an equation, that is 3x - 5y = 7.  Then:<br>  <br>  Multiply both sides of this equation by (-1).  That will make the (-5y) into (+5y).  SO:<br>  <br>  5y - 3x = -7.......Add 3x to both sides of the equation:<br>  <br>  5y = 3x - 7..........Divide both sides of this equation by 5 in order to isolate y.<br>  <br>  y = (3x/5) - (7/5)<br>  <br>  I have to factor the x out of (3x/5), getting (3/5) * x so that the equation will be in standard form (called slope-intercept form).<br>  <br>  I have to make the - (7/5) into + (-7/5) so that the equation will be in  standard form.<br>  <br>  y = ((3/5) * x) - (7/5) = (3/5) * x + (-7/5)  This equation is the boundary of the inequality<br>  <br>  m = (3/5) and b = (-7/5)<br>  --------------------<br>  <br>  I have uploaded a graph to photobucket.  It show a shaded area which is the area defined by the inequality, it shows the boundary line (3x - 5y = 7) and the point where that line crosses the x-axis (2 1/3,0) or as I prefer (7/3,0).<br>  <br>  Click on this link to see the graph:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://i369.photobucket.com/albums/oo133/gerryrains/LinearInequality.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i369.photobucket.com/albums/oo133...</a><br>  <br>  The graph shows you the difference between the line (3x - 5y = 7 and the inequality (3x - 5y) > 7.<br>  .|`|bj0gXfE5aa	3x-5y>7<br>  move the x to the right<br>  -5y>-3x+7<br>  divide all the numbers by -5, which will make the > a <<br>  y<(3/5)x-(7/5)<br>  <br>  There isn't an equal in the answer<br>  The slope is 3/5<br>  The y-intercept is (-7/5)

KrkftOfkaa	If you immerse it in Gatorade it won't rust.  You need oxygen to complete the process and if the steel wool is completely immersed then there's no O2 available.  As for wetting the steel wool?  I don't know...that's part of the fun of science.  Set up a controlled experiment and find out.  Use dry steel wool, some treated with tap water, some treated with salt water (about 35 parts per thousand or 3.5%), and some treated with Gatorade.  Leave them in similar conditions and check for rust at regular intervals.<br>  <br>  Who knows you could find that all the other stuff in the Gatorade actually acts as a rust inhibitor.

Using surgery to replace these peoples organs, they might live to see their family for another year. Or for some, it may help with cancer.

The period of a 4409 Hz wave is 227 us, which is about the x-distance between successive response peaks and succesive response nulls. With 5102 Hz the period is 196 us which will reduce the times between peaks and nulls. I don't know the owl's audible range but generally with broadband input the minima shouldn't go all the way to zero and the peaks should be broader.

Although chemicals might speed up the process, nature would have eventually gotten there. Male genetics have been declining since the beginning of mankind.<br>  Here is the deal. Females have two of the same chromosomes. Males have one female and one male. This means that the female genetic errors can be corrected, with the backup chromosome, however, male genetic errors can not, because we have a female chromosome instead of a male. <br>  Errors in genetics occur periodically. Over the generations, males have lost pieces of their male DNA due to this problem. <br>  <br>  Now we know certain chemicals can increase the mutation factors, so its not unlikely that this is contributing to the problem.|`|OkPDVfh6aa	A fictional show on tv tonight had a baby being born both male/female.

The effects of chemical contamination, increased uV radiation from the sun as a result of the decreasing ozone layer, the steady change in the makeup of the atmosphere of the Earth, and the increase of average global temperature are ALL combining to increase the overall rate of genetic mutation. Add to this the very slight increase in nuclear radiation form many sources such as even just the turning over of enormous areas of deep subsoil which release Radon gas (a radioactive gas), and we are looking at the rate of the evolution of the human species along with the evolution of ALL species increasing at the fastest rate ever on this world. The genetic makeup of the humans along with all other species will be very changed over the next millenium and these changes may or may not be for the better. <br>  <br>  Our civilization NEEDS to get a handle on all of this and it NEEDS to be done by independent researchers, NOT by the industries concerned. None of these materials is found in nature, ALL are 100% synthetic. There is a reason for this, Nature simply can't function normally under synthetic conditions. Rachel Carson wrote Silent Spring in 1953 and yet DDT was NOT taken entirely off the open market until well into the late 1960's. Why? Because the Chemical Industry simply has TOO much clout over the policy makers. It boils down to JOBS over LIVES. Society's priorities have become skewed in favor of making a profit over the TRUE purpose of Science which is, to discover the mechanisms to how the universe functions. Big business has hijacked Science and forced it to serve the masters of industry rather than assist humanity as a whole.

ys6tQ8zWaa	If you set up a proportion and solve, you will always get the right answer. Set up the given info in the first fraction, and then what you are looking for in the second. Then cross multiply and divide. Remember to always keep consistent units on the top and bottom.

QFJlCEElaa	Count the number of subsets that have exactly k elements, for each k between 0 and 4, and then add the numbers together.<br>  <br>  Another method is to count all of the subsets, and subtract the subsets that have exactly 5 elements. Of the remaining subsets, half of them have four elements or fewer, so we divide by two to get the final answer.

qDkXEiBIaa	For the first inequality,  -1 < a-1 < 4 , all you need to do is to add 1 to all parts of the inequality, which leaves you with  0 < a < 5 .  I have it written out below.<br>  <br>          -1 < a-1 <  4<br>         +1      +1   +1<br>     --------------------<br>     =    0 <  a   <  5<br>  <br>  For the second inequality,  -3 <= 1-t and 1-t < 2 , the first thing you should do is combine these two inequalities into one.  You can do this because of the common  1-t .  You are left with -3 <= 1-t < 2 .  From here you need to get the  t  all by itself.  To do this, subtract 1 from each part of the inequality.  You then have  -4 <= -t < 1 .  Unfortunately, now it gets a little bit unusual for those accustomed to only solving equations.  To get  -t  to become  t  by itself, multiply each part by -1.  Now here's what you need to remember: WHEN MULTIPLYING OR DIVIDING INEQUALITIES BY NEGATIVE NUMBERS, ALWAYS REVERSE THE INEQUALITY SIGNS!  Your final answer, thus, will be  4 >= t > -1 .  The work is shown below.<br>  <br>          -3 <= 1-t and 1-t < 2<br>          -3 <= 1-t < 2<br>          -1     -1     -1<br>      -------------------<br>          -4 <= -t < 1<br>          -4 <= -t < 1<br>       *(-1)  *(-1) *(-1)<br>       -------------------<br>          4 >= t > -1<br>  <br>  I hope this has helped you!  Have a good time solving those equalities, and remember to switch the inequality when you switch the sign.|`|vHTwS3E3aa	-1 > a - 1 < 4 <=> -1 + 1 < a - 1 + 1 < 4 + 1 <=> 0 < a < 5<br>  <br>  -3 <= 1 - t <=> -4 <= -t <=> 4>= t <=> t <= 4<br>  <br>  1 - t < 2 <=> 1 - 2 < t <=> t > -1
l0Ojx5DCaa	Short answer - rise/run requires two points to calculate. The "tangent line to a point" offers only one point from which to begin measurements. Can't calculate rise/run.<br>  <br>  Long answer - What exactly do you mean when you say you draw a line "tangent to a point"? What does tangent mean, as you see it?<br>  <br>  The purpose of a tangent line is that it is a line that touches a curve locally at precisely one point. If your slope is off at all, your "tangent line" will be inexact; it will touch the curve twice at two points relatively close together.<br>  <br>  Since the traditional definition of slope translates only to straight lines, the slope of a curve is defined as a limit. It is the limit of the slopes of lines created by points which are increasingly close together (or whose distance apart approaches zero). As the two points become so close that they can be considered essentially the same point, we come closer to the definition of a tangent line - a line which touches a curve at just one point (locally).<br>  <br>  "Just drawing a tangent line to a point" is a rough approximation of what calculus does precisely. So in answer to your question, we need calculus for two reasons. The first, as indicated, is precision. How accurate do you need to be? This question is typically answered by money. How much money would increased accuracy cost vs. how much money would decreased accuracy cost? When these two meet, we have economic equilibrium. Of course, that's an answer of practicality. In the purest mathematical sense, no amount of of error is acceptable, and calculus works to eliminate error entirely.<br>  <br>  The second answer to the question is that a graph by which you can complete rough approximations of a tangent line isn't necessarily available. Sometimes data makes curves more complicated than a simple polynomial drawing. Curves-of-best-fit for scatterplots pretty much depend on error minimization, but cannot generally be drawn freehand.|`|XBwLjq1daa	I have no idea<br>  <br>  Calculus=more headache=pointless now thats a great equation<br>  <br>  I know exactly how you feel though. Theres an easier way I learned from Physics how to solve some problems and Calculus just makes me use the long and harder way.
fhiN8R7Kaa	For the first one, you can apply a^(log base a b) = b, so here:<br>  27^(log base 27  j) = j<br>  therefore j = 27^(2/3) = 32 = 9.<br>  <br>  For the second one, you can calculate directly:<br>  x = log base 1/2 8 = - log base 2 8 = - log base 2 2^3 = -3 * log base 2 2 = -3.<br>  <br>  Everything is summed up in the definition log base a b = (ln b) / (ln a).|`|CptGRMSlaa	27^2/3 = j<br>  <br>  cube rt of 27 is 3, sqrd is 9.  so j=9<br>  <br>  <br>  1/2 ^x = 8<br>  <br>  you know 2 cubed is 8, but you have 2 on the bottom so to move it to the top, it must be -3.

It's straight mechanics.  <br>  <br>  A "science" experiment and hypothesis might be "Is moving heavy objects is more energy efficient using a hovercraft than using rolling platforms?"  Then, you could build your hovercraft, put an object on it, figure out the total energy it takes to run the hovercraft and move it a known distance, and then move the same object the same distance using a little motorized wheeled cart.  Then you could compare the power required for each.  <br>  <br>  I dunno, that's just an example, but if I were your teacher, I wouldn't allow you to just build a hovercraft.|`|AA10276489	I see you have been to science and math. forum so go there and post your question in engineering and you will get some help
