I know that most people in this section are suffering, so i would like anyone with a success story to share it, if they don't mind, to give all the others in here hope that things CAN get better.   :)   for example, i was diagnosed with severe depression about a year ago, was suicidal and frequently self harming. After having therapy for a year, battling hard against my demons, opening up to people and gaining support, i am now so much better. i am happier, i have more purpose to my life, and i have only cut once in the last 3 months.   :)   yeah, i still get my down days, and still do get the extremes, but compared to last year i am nowhere near as bad, and am better at coping.      anyone else have any hope they'd like to share? any successes? no matter how small they may seem, if they have made a difference to you then they count, and may well give hope to others.      let's see if we can give everyone a little hope, or better, a smile.      :)      *hugs* for all

20090223135247AAO9opi	Health;Mental Health	I dont know what do with my life, i feel like im stuck?	hi, i really do not know what to do with my life anymore. i grew up in a fairly firm family, learnt manners, etiquette, alsorts of useful lessons etc etc at school, and when i hit secondary school, i learnt a bit more, then when i chose my options for yrs 10 and 11, once i started that i started to get a firm idea of what i wanted to do - something to do with food.   but i ended up going onto college in a childcare course only to get kicked out because i wasnt working hard enough, because i only chose the course so i could be with my friends, and by the time i got kicked out id fallen out with them all, then i didnt do anything with my life, i just lived at home on the internet all day, living off my dads benefits, which i knew wasnt right, but i really couldnt be bothered to do anything with my life. then i met a guy off the internet, we met up, decided to meet up again and over the following weeks it really grew into something really special(ive been with him ever since), then a couple months later he persuaded me to get a job at my local supermarket(not really what i had in mind but at least i would be able to get some money behind my back), only i find every time i get paid i end up blowing it one way or another, but i do have a credit card, but it only has a ￡100 limit and i want a bit of good credit history behind me too just incase for the future, although i am free to cancel my credit card at anytime.   but now i feel im stuck in this job i dont wanna do, and cant get any money behind me because my boyfriend lives in a flat he cant afford to run by himself so i end up paying half his bills, all my bills then i end up with nothing left, and ideally i would like to go back into education so i can get a better job, or have more chance of getting a better job.   i want to learn to drive too, but obviously i cant do that in my current situation.   not only do i have an interest in food, but ive considered office jobs not just as a job, but ive liked the idea of it too, and ever since going to work with my boyfriend for the first time ive been fascinated by tractors, foragers and all other kinds of farm machinery, so im willing to do anything to do with agricultural or mechanical engineering.   what i really need is, like, a career finder-type program, then a planner to help me get my life back on track.   if anyone has any advice, its more than welcomed, or if anyone knows any websites where i can find the 2 previously-mentioned items that would be great too, but dont forget, im broke, so it needs to be free.   by the way, i have access to the internet at home via a desktop computer and a laptop, i have a contract mobile phone, i have access to a jobcentre on foot, and several places that offer office jobs and loads of other places that offer loads of other kinds of jobs and im an 18 year old female stuck in a rut, if that will help anyone!   thanks in advance, its greatly appreciated

I have a beautiful 8 yr old who with every passing day i am becoming more and more worried about. She was born with no complications, but became ill shortly after wards. She vomited all the time and was FTT. She ended up with RSV which eventually caused her to have asthma. As a baby i was told that her brain is a little bigger then it should be.she would stare off into space for a few seconds. so her dr sent her to see a ped neuro.  She was easily irritated as a small child. She could not do shape sorters, doesn't play with any toys and if she does it isn't for long. Cries over the simplest things(if you brush her hair to hard or she falls it is over dramatic)  excels in one subject in school  this week then fails it the next. I have been told she is OCD,by a behavioral health dr. Things have to be perfect or she gets upset. She can not ride a bike, most of the time she has no desire too. Longs to have friends over, but when she does, she is either very very bossy or cries because they are playing with her things. I am actually very worried, i as a mother see that she is a little "different". Every dr that we have been to brushes me off saying she will grow out of it. Well she isn't and it is getting worse. Any one have any ideas what this could be? who do i take her to see. She has seen the same pediatrician since she was born. please help.she also suffers from kidney reflux. ( this is my second time posting got very few answers the first time.)      The behavioral health dr wants to put her on prozac for her OCD. and no other options.

20090223142551AAN2xwJ	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Extremely tired child?	My 10 year old very bright, musical & sporty granddaughter is giving us cause for concern. She can suddenly go extremely pale and become very tired. This happens at random times and can be shortly after a meal or before it. She was taken to the doctor who indicated that there appeared to be nothing wrong. My daughter asked for her to see a paediatrician who checked her over and as she was looking fit and well said she seemed alright. At no time has a blood test been taken. She has a good and varied diet and also regular sleeping times. There is just no pattern to when the sudden onset of tiredness, or more extreme exhaution, happens.This has been happening for over a year and my daughter hesitates to take her back to the doctors as they seemed to think she was a "fussy" mother. There are 2 other children in the family and they do not have this problem.   Any suggestions, or people with like experience and advice, would be most welcome   Thanks

20090223140344AA1SwqI	Health;Other - Health	What helps appendix stop hurting?	If I frink coffee, eat strawberries, oranges makes it worse? Because it hurts me then.   When I eat chicken,ham, cereal bars,whole bread, veggetables or even something really sweet I feel great. Only some fruits make it worse. It's not hurting like I have to do operation- i say this because lately I wasn't eating good (chips, cola, alchool, not sleeping enough) When I eat right everything's fine except some fruits and other things. For ex. I can drink grapefruit or sanguin but not orange. I cannot eat meat or pouletry without rice, bread or potato together. I can stand eating sauces or mexican tastes without problems. I prefer neutral taste juices, like vegetables juices or others juices with sugar. I like to balance everything. The problem is that if sometimes I cannot control my sentiments or I'm frustrated with a situation-whatever I've eaten-it's going to hurt me.      What else do you suggest?

One night, i was lying in bed. it was the middle of the night, i cant remember if i was half asleep, or just sitting there, but i lost  alot of my breath. its like i was too tired to breath. i had to take a deep breath for me to get air. and this is really weird, but i remeber laying in bed and my body got really tight, maybe not physically, but maybe mentally. i was kindof having like a body or mind spasm.  i had to try really hard to get my mind or body out of that tight stage, and breath. It was really weird, i dont really know what it was. i cant really explain things well, and im hoping to find what it is. my eyes felt weird too. they were closed, but as if they were rolling back, but i dont think they really were, bc i would be unconsious. its kind of like i was laying there in a daze, and on a mind block, and not being able to think or anything. the other night, i was laying in bed, and i breathed in and then after that breath i just layed there and felt like i had to struggle to breath. like put an extra bolt of energy. idk if this has anything to do with this but, that same night, the lights were off, and my cell phone was glowing really bright and then it turned off. then i started seeing splotches or like cloudy things coming over my eyes, and they wouldnt go away. but i think thatwas just bc of te light. plz someone help me! im going to the doctor about it sometime, but i was just wondering about any suggestins! thank you!!

Hello, I need help, any cardiologist that could help me it would be great!       ...When I was very young (about 7 yrs) I was diagnosed with Tachycardia. I remembered that the doctor told me that I could not drink coffee, or tea. He also told me that anesthesia wouldn't be good for me because it would make my heart speed up more than usual.      A couple of years later (I'm 16) I need to have a surgery that requires general anesthesia in order to remove all of my wisdom teeth. I was told that once I reached puberty tachycardia was going to disappear.

I started on Yasmin first for about two years and found that the mood swings were absolutely unbearable. I then changed and tried another three or four different types of pill and found they all gave me mood swings, plus other added symptoms such as headaches, acne, cramping etc.       I also have cysts on my ovaries, but am using this mostly as a contraceptive. I went off all pills about four months ago and my moods have dramatically increased, however just using condoms has made me a little anxious.       My period were always irregular and come anywhere between five and eight weeks and I am just finding that the wait for the period is agonising. I feel that my only option is to go back on the pill.       Does anyone have any similar stories with a good solution? Is there anything else that would work for me that you know of?

I had braces as a teenager but did not wear my retainer properly, so whilst my teeth are now straight I still have gaps....the gap between my two front teeth is probably the largest gap I have and is especially annoying!!! To give you some idea I would estimate my gap is approx 1, maybe 1 1/2 mm wide.   What are my options for having these removed? Roughly how much would it cost? I looked at the inman aligner, but that seems to focus on correcting crooked teeth.   Any advice would be really appreciated!   Thanks!!

20090223153316AAWQdJI	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Is the following situation medically and scientifically possible/realistic, with a full recovery?	Please, please help me if you possibly can. I know that this is quite long but I need to be precise and clear. Thank you very much. This really means a lot to me.      I was wondering whether it was possible for a person to be shot a number of times at "non-fatal" areas of the body, such as the hands or the legs. For my example, let us say a very, very fit, strong and healthy young man is shot once in the abdomen, twice in the left thigh and once in the left shoulder. In addition, he has a very, very strong will to survive. It is about 20 minutes before he is in hospital. Taking into consideration the places where he was shot and how many times, his excellent physical condition, his strong will power to survive and the amount of time it takes for him to get proper medical attention, is it possible to survive and to make a full and quick recovery?      The man's wife was with him, and she did try to stop the bleeding. However, because of a lack of relevant knowledge, she was unable to do much more than that. The shot to the abdomen wasn't a direct shot to the center, it was more to the side of the body.      Please also mention the expected time needed to make a full recovery if he receives good medical care and works hard to get back into shape.      None of the bullets hit any vital organs/major arteries/bones whatsoever, they just hit "normal" flesh. All of them remained inside his body. The gun was a Beretta 92, with 9x19mm Parabellum. He was shot from a distance of about 2-3 meters.      I really appreciate all help very much and will be choosing a best answer. Thank you all very, very much.

20090223151420AAy74nA	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Heart Diseases	Heart suddenly beating very fast?	This has happened to me twice already, and I don't know what to think. A few months I was lying in bed trying to sleep when I was suddenly hit with this overwhelming dread. My heart started beating extremely fast, and it felt like I KNEW somebody was coming into my bedroom. I wasn't game enough to open my eyes, so I just huddled in the same spot shaking, until it got light and I managed to sleep. Last night while I was lying in bed in the same spot, it happened again. My heart started beating fast, and it felt like somebody was coming into my room. I didn't look again. I was having troubles sleeping after that, and it happened about 5-7 times during the entire night, only not as bad as the first time it originally happened. I'm not sure what to think. On one hand, I think I might be having heart problems and my brain is interpreting it as fright (and my paranoia is interpreting it as somebody coming into my room), but on the other hand, I think somebody might actually be coming into my room. A few weeks ago when my sister couldn't sleep, she opened her eyes to see a white face hovering above her, and then it darted out of the room. But I don't know; it could have been her mind, even if she swears it was real. So what do you guys think? Natural, or supernatural? My family has a history of heart problems, but it also has a history of "seeing" supernatural things. Your thoughts?

I have a special situation. When I was in third grade the dentist said that I had to get my front and the one next to it pulled out(not the other front one). I had braces to help pull them down. One of them stayed down and the front one went back up. Now, I am in tenth grade and have just gotten braces again for an underbite and to move my teeth around so my stupid bridge can fit where my tooth was. I am so scared. I have so many other problems in my life I don't need this right now. This is consuming my whole life. I dream about this every night! Whenever I have free time, I am thinking about this.

20090223154549AA9WB7Y	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Stage 4 prostate cancer..?	My dad, age 52, was diagnosed with stage 4 prostate cancer on Friday. His PSA level is 256. The cancer has spread to his lower spine, neck and one lung. The tumor in his neck is pinching nerves and he is losing feeling in his hand, so they are starting radiation on Wed. to try to make it smaller so that he will hopefully have full arm function for a little bit longer. Other than that he is just on hormone therapy. The oncologist has said that there's nothing that they can do for him but make him comfortable. I have not been able to find anything anywhere on the internet about anyone who's had a PSA level of 256. Even the oncologists and radiologists are shocked about it. I am wondering what we can expect and maybe about how long we could expect that he'll still be with us. What will start happening? He hasn't shown any outward symptoms yet, except for a lot of back, neck and arm pain. The oncologist has said that his cancer is extremely aggressive, though, and things will go very fast. I am just so lost and confused and sad. What can we expect now and what should we do for him. Thanks.

Like I hold the mayo and put only mustard on my sandwiches, and I drink mostly water. My weakness is dark chocolate though and I can't seem to go a day without it. I try and work out at least 25 min a day on the elliptical. I have gotten out of shape and can't do much more than that on the elliptical but I can go 25 min on the stationary bike combined with 25 min on the tredmill, the elliptical's a much harder workout... I switch between the elliptical one day and then one day I will do the bike and tredmill together. Along with weights. But anyways, is there anything more I can do to help me have more discipline and will power that can help me shed more pounds. I do not want to necessarily lose "weight" just fat so my clothes fit looser and I am more toned and in shape. Any advice will be considered. Also, are there any pills or supplements that actually work?

20090223154252AAgcohP	Health;Mental Health	Borderline personality disorder question....?	I have been doing a little research because it seems like all areas of my life are far out of my control... despite all my best efforts to keep a semblance of "keeping it together".  Through that research I've done some reading on BPD, I STRONGLY meet 8 out 9 criteria for said disorder.  SO much would be explained if I were to find out that I truly do suffer from BPD.  I do NOT consider myself qualified to self-diagnose, but from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders I REALLY identify with BPD, though I won't go into those VERY personal specifics here in public.  I don't need anyone to tell me I'm being a hypochondriac, that has CLEARLY been proven to me to NOT be the case.   My question is this:  with no health insurance, no medicaid/medicare, no money to independently pay someone for psychoanalysis and possible hospitalization, how does one explore a possible diagnosis by a licensed mental health professional?  Also, in order for hospitalization to take place, does one actually have to go all Girl Interrupted and try to do herself in?  Because I have, for the most part, been able to suppress my suicidal urges/attempts and I mean to keep it that way.  I don't feel that I shouldn't be taken seriously just because I haven't recently attempted suicide (doesn't mean I don't think about it a LOT)...  Advice from a mental health professional would really be appreciated here, I've been suffering for what I feel is FAR too long and I think I might have found a way out of the dark.  Everything is coming down around me, I just need to make it stop.  Thank you so much.

20090223151741AAEB7OX	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Injury in October, still no relief (Neck/ Shoulder)?	Don't comment on telling me to go to a doctor, I have been and still am. I want real commentary, not some rude comment. Thanks.      Anyway, I was involved in a car accident in October 08. I was at a complete stop when I was rear ended by an SUV going 50 mph and slammed into the car in front of me. I went to the hospital where I was diagnosed with a partially separated shoulder and whiplash. I then went to an orthopedic who told me I had a neck strain. He had me get an MRI (which was a wk after the wreck) and it showed no bulging disks. He later told me the facet joints coming off of my spine were unaligned. He put me on pain medication, rest w/ cervical collar, then to PT. PT released me back to him because there was too much inflammation to realign the joints. Pain was not resolved. I went back and he diagnosed me with shoulder bursitis due to the shoulder separation. He then gave me a cortisone injection directly into the shoulder joint. Pain resolved a little in my shoulder but was back after two weeks. I went back and he wanted to try an epidural cervical block, where they make injections directly to the facet joints. It provided no relief at all. He then made me have a bone scan done to check for fractures. It showed no fractures. I go back tomorrow. Anyone with any ideas, or any similar experiences? It is not Feb. almost March and I have no relief. The pain lately has seemed to get worse. I have had headaches, pain on the left side of my face, tingling & numbness in left arm, pain in left shoulder blade, pain and swelling in left side of neck, swelling on the back of my head on the left side just below the occipital lobe, loss of range and motion, difficulty swallowing sometimes. The pain has been so bad some days that it had caused me to vomit due to its intensity.       Also, he has seemed to try every method of nonsurgical treatment, should I consider surgery?      Thanks so much.

20090223154109AANqJFg	Health;Women's Health	Is missing a period on birth control normal?	Let me start from the beginning. About a year ago I began using Nuvaring, I continued to get a period every month for the first three months. Then I got married and started having sex (obviously). After beginning to have sex, I stopped getting a period EVERY month. I would get them some months, and other months I would bleed only for about an hour then everything would go back to normal. Still other months, I would get no period whatsoever. (Let me tell you, as an inexperienced newlywed this made me panic because I thought I was pregnant). After finding out some of the scarier things about the nuvaring I switched to a pill (Junell) this was a little over two months ago. After my first bout of the pill I got a period for about an hour a day or two before I was done with my pill packet. Then I got no period when I was on my "week off". This month I just finished my pill packet last night and yesterday afternoon I got a light period, and it has continued into today and is getting a little heavier. My periods have just been incredibly strange the past few months, before birth control it would take almost a full day for me to actually bleed, and when I did it was really dark. Now I get bright red blood almost right away. I guess my question is just is this normal? Were my first three months normal because I wasn't having sex? Any input would be much appreciated!

Today and yesterday, my actual shoulder, slightly right and underneath of my collarbone, I get a pain when I lift my arm above a certain height, just below horizon level... The only way I can describe it is when you need to click your shoulder, the feeling just before that, when it is about to click, but it has been like this for >24 hours and has not clicked yet. I cannot lift much with that arm as it hurts too much. :( If I get the pain, sometimes (right now) my shoulder aches for a short while after.      I haven't done anything that I know of to it, I haven't been involved in any activities that would put stress on it, I simply play guitar for about 4-5 hours every day, but it has never happened before so I don't know what the cause is. I have naturally clicky joints, as my knees click every time I crouch down, and then click again when I stand up, and if I twist my wrist in a circular motion, it sounds like 2 cogs grinding against each other. But they have never hurt, whereas now my shoulder does.      Anyway, thanks if you can help. :)

For about three months they happened about twice a day, each only lasting a few seconds, and then slowly they decreased until around December I wasn't getting them at all anymore. But then at the end of January I started to get them again once in a while, but this time they lasted about a minute. Since then they have increased until now I get them around twice a day and sometimes they can last up to 6 or 7 minutes. I am not exercising when it happens I am usually just sitting down.  It feels like someone is taking a knife and stabbing me in the rib with it. What do you think this is?
20090223151643AApmRf8	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	I don't know whats going on..?	it all started when I was at school, and i ate school lunch and i constantly had to wipe the corner bottom of my lip because the food i was eatting was kinda greasy, after i finished i went to the bathroom and saw a white head, i went home and popped it. Scab formed and then it went away, after 2 weeks it came back, then i popped it again. Then today in school my scab was falling off so i went home and peeled it off and there goes the same damn white head. this is like a horror movie, i tried every acne medicine that you can buy in walmart but its not going away, I can't see a dermotologist because its just 1 pimple, my mom does not think its that serious. Is it because of the food im eatting or stress or waht? She says its because i stay up late and play games thats why. But i don't know if thats true or not.
20090223151723AANo7pW	Health;Mental Health	For anyone that knows about mental disorders or psychology please help me :( :( -tears-?	:( i need some help.         i have a friend who was diagnose with anxiety and mild depression but from what she has told me it seems more than just that.         she says she is scared of batteries cause they might spill acid, she is also scared of germs and mold.  when she spends the night over my house she constantly washes her hands and sometimes she wants me there because she thinks that she has came in contact with soap residue or mold or ( whatever that is ) from the faucet =/ ?      also when we buy fast food she is always looking at her food and is she sees a little black dot or something she thinks it's something bad       last time she made me eat of her burger cause she felt paranoid that it had something bad and by me eating it        umm, it would ease her anxiety ??   when we go out she is always looking back to check is she has dropped  a card, paper, or anything even though sometime she knows she is not carrying anything.        an example. she was wearing a shirt and sweats with no pockets  and she kept constantly looking back saying she dropped something????      when we got to the car she freaked out and said she had to go double check. i constantly re- assure her she hasn't dropped anything :'( sometimes she stresses me out with this.          she's also paranoid that people may do something bad to her when she goes out alone but when she is with a friend or family member she feels fine???        a few more things that she does is       when ever we pass through a trash can  she says "omg, i touched it "!  also she touched my remote control and said omg i think i touched acid ( cause of the AA batteries) but the batteries are not leaking and she then goes washes her hands.       this all started like 5 months ago. at the beginning it was just bad intrusive thoughts. from that it went to freaking out about diseases. then to this.          also she admits to realizing that she hasn't dropped any paper or that the batteries ain't leaking but to wash her hands after touching the remote and to look back too see if she hasn't dropped paper relieves her from the anxiety and worry she feels         she is my friend and i want to help her. it breaks my heart to see her get so frustrated and in tears because of this. i known her since for a long time and all i want her to do is get better. :'(          from what i have describe would anyone know is this is more than just anxiety and mild depression?         she has a psychiatrist and is on paxil 20 mg  but i dont think it's helping.            she is my friend and all i want to do is help her.       sometimes i see her get so frustrated and starts crying and i hear her out  and it makes me feel really bad because it sounds like she is seriously suffering :'(.          i really do want my friend that i known for a really long time to get better not worse. but idk what else i can seriously do.         - to anyone that would know does this sound like it's more than just anxiety?      also pls forgive my writing as i was just putting everything down since i feel really upset right now.

Celestone injections are similar to cortisone shots, which is probably what's typically used.  Celestone is Betamethasone (coricosteroid) which as explained to me is stronger version of regular cortisone.  I've had some people tell me to not get more than 2 or 3 because these types of shots can weaken tendons and connective tissue.  The dosage of the medicine is 6mgs.  Am I worrying unnecessarily, or is this a legitimate concern?  I'll be talking to the Dr in a few days, and wanted to get some insight first.  Thanks

I have been told to report to prison next week. I've heard that processing and transportation from the reception facility to the actual jail can take up to two full days. I've also heard that they take away the shoes you came in right away when you self-surrender, but they only issue you prison clothing once you have been processed and transported to the jail. Should I bring an extra pair of socks and underwear with me for this period? If I'm going to have to walk around everywhere in socks once they take my shoes, I guess my socks would get pretty dirty in two days. I was just thinking of plain white briefs and white socks, and wondering if this would be acceptable.

Around that point I started drinking and smoking (weed) also, drinking once every week or 2 and smoking a couple times a week. I know am less motivated, harder to focus in school, can never remember things, forget things all the time, and can never get the thrill I used to get unless im high or drunk. I stopped drinking and smoking as much recently but I don't feel any different, is this because of the adhd kicking in or because of the weed and drinking. Also if i stop drinking and smoking as much now will I still be able to do good in school in college and hopefully grad school

20090223152941AAAJ4lD	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Man dies from bacterial meningitis. What do you think about this article?	SHREWSBURY, Mass. - A 30-year-old man has died of bacterial meningitis in Shrewsbury.    Health Director Nancy Allen on Tuesday said the victim died in the emergency room of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester last Tuesday. Allen says state officials are working to determine how the man got infected. He traveled to New York City once a week, and experts will study that as a possible route of exposure. Members of his family were immunized last week. Meningitis is an infection of the fluid of the spinal cord and the fluid that surrounds the brain. It kills about 300 people in the U.S. each year.    Bacterial meningitis can result in brain damage, hearing loss, learning disability or death. Symptoms include high fever, headache and a stiff neck, and can also include nausea, vomiting, confusion and sleepiness.

20090223155227AAvrlSK	Health;Women's Health	Birth control and antibiotics...?	ok, ive been on yaz for birth control for about about 3 months now. last week my doctor prescribed me bactrim for a UTI. he never warned me about the antibiotics effects on birth control. after taking my entire prescritpion, someone brought it to my attention that the bactrim could have interfered with my bc's efficiency..      well, the entire week i was taking the bactrim, i had unprotected sex. but im not here to get lectured. i just want to know, could the bactrim really have allowed me to ovulate, increasing my chance of being pregnant? or do antibiotics really affect birth control?      im supposed to start my period sometime this week and im feeling really nervous that i could possibly be pregnant...
20090223155239AAOYVNr	Health;Mental Health	Nobody believes in me, not even my parents.?	Well... This is kinda my story...   About a year ago I was very depressed. By everything, everything was wrong and it felt like I couldn't do anything right. Summer 2008 I was the happiest person alive because I had a dream and I believed in myself that I will be one day, the person I have dreamed almost my whole childhood. That was my true happiness, it all made me happy and I could beat the world! Damn that were good moments. But since school started the popularity made me nervous and I started to waste my time in that piece of crap. I had made new 'friends' but they didn't made me happy and so. Then my depression started again... I felt all left alone, even by my father. My mom past away a few years ago. And my dad, he's the most closest person to my heart and I couldn't live without him. - Now I go to school in a normal class with very very friendly kids (I switched from classes) and I'm happy about it 'n all... So now I have time to rest and think about my mental health. I wanted to dream again because I was actually so stupid to forgot how to dream! Life was a waste of time because I hadn't a good reason to live for. But now, I want to believe and I'm willing. And I'm only thinking about for days and days and I get all crazy in my head. I want to be a great actress and some day, I want to be a great Hip-Hop dancer cause art was my first love (first drawing, designing than acting and dancing). But how the heck am I going to start if no one believes in me and that doesn't motivates me to believe in my self. This is a true life-dream, I have been dreaming this since I was little!      I hope I made my question kinda clear, It has been a difficult time...      Help is very appreciated! Love you!!!

Perhaps I ought also to mention that though I get only the occassional zit on my face, I have pretty severe back acne. I am a teenager, and I daresay it's nothing that won;t clear up (he says that now...) but I wondered if, rahter than drugging myself to death with various lotions and potions, I couldn't simply use an antibacterial soap and take vitamin A supplements to help control oil levels or something?

20090223155552AAQApCz	Health;Diet & Fitness	What to Do About This?	Yesterday evening, I was at a gym with my partner of (going on to) 9 years. My partner is a personal trainer and he decided to come along with me so that he could work out. I am on a contract with the gym for the next five months and my partner pays for a casual visit. He has been there three times and myself five.      We were  both working out and we were drawing to the close of our gym visit when I asked him if he could show me how to box; yes, we'd brought our boxing gloves from home to use (I don't believe that the gym has such equipment) as they're ours and they were purchased for enjoyment. At, maybe, one minute into him showing me how to punch his boxing pads the manager of the gym appeared from no where and jumped down our throats and falsely accused my partner and I of carrying out paid personal training on the premises. The manager also insisted that he'd received 4 complaints. I asked the manager if he'd really received these complaints because his claims lacked credibility - we were in a room that hardly anyone was using. This manager insisted that he'd received complaints. I asked from whom and he would not tell me. During this conversation a female personal trainer hissed at me and said to him as she settled on the floor nearby to do crunches "She doesn't get it!" The manager then went on to say that my partner was trying to solicit personal training business from the gym when my partner had not spoken to any of the other gym members and we'd hardly picked up our boxing equipment when this manager appeared. We told the manager that we are partners and the manager then went on to question for how long (not believing us - we're a biracial couple - and wanting more information that was not for him to ask). All of this happened in front of a busy gym where other people were working out together, friends showing their friends how to use equipment and encouraging each other. The only difference between us and the other couples and friends was that he showed me how to hit his boxing pads for, if at all, one minute; after we'd both used the gym facilities to individually work out. My partner had no involvement in all but that one minute of my gym time.      I told my partner that I wanted to go whereupon we walked to the reception and locker rooms to collect our things and I told my partner that I wanted to terminate my contract with the gym. After this the same manager appeared and started arguing about the situation again and we had to go through the entire process again in front of more people. For a second time I stated to the manager that we are a couple and that we can even show the addresses our drivers' licences to prove it.      During this whole altercation, the manager continually contradicted himself. There was no mention of whom had complained (after the female trainer hissed like a ferral cat, I have the feeling maybe some trainers said something), when the truth of our relationship was voluntarily revealled (becuase we couldn't believe that this was happening and we tried to tell them "no, we are a couple spending time together.") the manager did not apologise. The manager continued to argue.      By the end of this experience we both left feeling hurt, defamed, angry and discriminated against (continual justification of our relationship status). I want to take some form of action against this gym but I am at a loss as to where to start because I feel very stressed and angry that this humiliating occurrence happened to us. I want to publically shame these people and this business for what it did. All I can think of is writing to the local paper and sharing my horrid experience with the wider community.         I just can't believe this happened and I feel very hurt by it all.            - Pepper.

20090223155808AAkVSuK	Health;Diseases & Conditions;STDs	Oral HSV-1 transmission to a man?	I have had HSV-1 since I was a child (that's the herpes that is oral and causes cold sores in the mouth, I do not have it genitally). Yesterday in the heat of passion I gave my boyfriend a full unprotected ******* as a cold sore was developing on my lip (neither he nor I realized I was developing one), and I know that it was developing because I have a cold sore today. He has never had HSV-1 (a cold sore) and does not have genital herpes. I do not have genital herpes either. I heard that herpes is much more easily transferred to women than to men, and I am praying this is true.       What is the likelihood that I have just given him genital HSV-1 herpes? I am REALLY worried and have yet to tell him of this possibility as it just happened. I realize there is a high chance I have given it to him but is there also a fair chance that his immune system didn't pick up the virus and he is still clean?

Recuerdo que cuando ni?o en la escuela nos hicieron un examen de optometría y mi visión era una de las mejores.   Recuerdo que recién llegado a Bogotá (a los 11 a?os) el sol me fastidiaba tanto que se me ponían los ojos llorosos (imagino que por la altura de la ciudad los rayos son más fuertes) y a veces me era imposible levantar la vista y tenía qué caminar con la cabeza abajo (no estoy exagerando), así que mi mamá me llevó al médico, el cuál me hechó unas gotas en los ojos que me hicieron ver demasiado borroso durante un día... Pero esas gotas no me hicieron efecto respecto al sol.       no sé exactamente, pero aproximadamente a los 13 a?os me di cuenta que no veía del todo bien, sin embargo  no era tan mala la visión... Como a los 15 o 16 me di cuenta que había empeorado bastante...  No quería ir al doctor (ni decir nada) porque no me gustaba la idea de usar gafas...         "Continuará...

20070815061134AAmy31q	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Dudas sobre la diabetes...1?	1.  La diabetes es una enfermedad crónica que se debe a una falla en la secreción total o parcial de insulina, hormona que segrega el páncreas, y debe ser tratada de por vida.    2.  La diabetes puede aparecer en cualquier etapa de la vida. El 10 por ciento de los enfermos padece la diabetes Tipo 1, que aparece con más frecuencia en menores de 30 a?os. Entre el 85 y 90 por ciento restante padece la diabetes Tipo 2, que frecuentemente se acompa?a de obesidad.    3.   Si bien la diabetes no se puede prevenirse es muy importante que cuando se posean antecedentes hereditarios, el paciente realice periódicamente un análisis de determinación de azúcar en sangre (glucemia) para poder detectar precozmente cualquier anormalidad.    4.
