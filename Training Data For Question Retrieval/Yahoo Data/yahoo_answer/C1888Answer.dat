Apple Stores are popping up all over and you can make an appointment for a time and date, bring your computer there. They will troubleshoot it and fix it if it's a software problem it's FREE. What other computer company has stores and can make that statement? Get the 2.4 GHz with 4Gigs Ram and you got a speed machine like mine. The WinBloze people may not like a Mac computer but I'll bet they all have iPods.

I got a 4GB low-latency kit for $50 for my iMac, while Apple wanted $149.<br>  <br>  Second, I don't push AppleCare on people, but when you are getting a $2400 laptop, it's worth it! You get the one year free, but it's a good idea to add the extra two years. Sure, it's a couple hundred bucks, but if ANYTHING goes dead on your MBPro you more than make up the cost of the coverage. Desktop, prob don't need it. MacBook entry, still maybe not. MBPro? Get it!!<br>  <br>  That's really all you need to start. The last generation MBPros even came with the mini dvi-to-VGA adapter in case you wanted to run a second monitor or projector - I'm prettty sure the current one does too.<br>  <br>  If you want to run Windows via Boot Camp you can get yourself an OEM copy of XP or Vista for cheap on NewEgg.Com or Amazon.Com.<br>  <br>  That's it!

zorYTX59aa	The answers to your question is "no" & "no".<br>  <br>  If you want your videos to be shown at 16:9<br>  "widescreen" together with the "high quality"<br>  option, you should consider all of this:<br>  <br>  Basically, all digital video recorders (DVRs)<br>  function using 720x480 "rectangular" pixels.<br>  Computers have lots of different resolutions, <br>  but they all utilize "square" pixels. As such,<br>  Flash "encoders" can't always compensate<br>  or properly adjust for the difference. Just as<br>  important, lots of downloaders & converters <br>  render uploaded videos "fuzzy-looking" with <br>  rather large square pixels that look as if the <br>  videos were recorded using 120x90. This is<br>  particularly noticeable when there is motion <br>  in the video, or during slide show montages<br>  when images transition from one to another. <br>  Thus, keep your videos in their original form<br>  as much as is possible.<br>  <br>  DVR's and Hypercams are not "widescreen",<br>  nor does "widescreen" mean high-quality or<br>  high-resolution. The only thing "widescreen" <br>  really means is a "more rectangular" shape.<br>  <br>  YouTube accepts file sizes up to 1,024 MB,<br>  so it is now much easier to upload larger or<br>  HQ/HD (high-quality / high-definition) videos.<br>  Everything on YouTube is, by default, "high<br>  quality" -- so you shouldn't be fretting about <br>  what you have to do in order to achieve HQ. <br>  If your video is HQ enough, it will be offered<br>  on YouTube as high-quality.<br>  <br>  YouTube's old ideal at the very beginning of <br>  last summer was 640x480. It seems rather<br>  close to the 720x480 resolution of the DVR, <br>  but YouTube really scales all of their videos <br>  "down" to 480x360 (or 640x360 widescreen, <br>  which is the new size of the player window).<br>  <br>  Because the ratio may now also be at 16:9, <br>  those types of videos can also be uploaded <br>  at 480x270, 640x360, 864x486 or the really<br>  massive 1280x720 -- which is really overkill<br>  for no practical gain. The best option surely<br>  is 640x360. Because the aspect would still <br>  be 16:9, you could get higher-quality videos <br>  by scaling down to the lower number with a <br>  video encoder that's "high-quality", such as <br>  a codec that's H.264, Divx, Xvid or MPEG-4.<br>  That would then accomplish several results:<br>  -- a smaller file (thus faster uploading)<br>  -- YouTube also has less to "process"<br>  -- you control the final scaling of pixels<br>  -- the video gets high-quality encoding.<br>  <br>  The same result would happen if you would<br>  use 480x360 for regular videos because not <br>  only would that aspect ratio still be 4:3, the <br>  height of the new player is enow xactly 360 <br>  pixels.<br>  <br>  I hope that my answer helps you somehow.|`|qDMz5xa9aa	Nop.

pUzJiMUcaa	In game programming, you can expect constant challenges, unrealistic deadlines, and 70-80 hour work weeks. Most game programmers don't have much of a life.<br>  <br>  Any other area of programming, it depends on your employer. Still, I don't know many programmers who put in fewer than 50 hours a week, most average closer to 60 (plus any hobby/freelance work).<br>  <br>  Speaking of freelance work...it's not something that's easy to maintain and count on. At any point in time, I have PLENTY of work to choose from. The problem? It is not from professional outlets. Those people hire consultants and pay them a descent wage. As a freelancer, you get to deal with people who think that 5 thousand for a simple website is astronomical (if they went through a consultant, they'd pay double..). You will be overworked and underpaid, and you'll hate life. If you want to be your own boss, look to start a firm after you get a solid decade of experience.<br>  <br>  That's how long it takes to get good at software engineering: 10 years. Talk to anyone who does it for a living...ask em what they think of those "Teach yourself xx language in 24 hours!" books. They'll tell you they laugh at em.<br>  <br>  You don't need a degree, but you do need discipline. You need to spend a lot of time learning, and a lot of time practicing. Another maxim describing the amount of energy put into it: You need to spend 10 thousand hours programming before you can be thought of as "really good". Even then, some never make it there...because the caveat of all this is this: Great programmers are not made. They are born. <br>  <br>  Overall, expect constant challenges of the brain. Good programmers are skinny, yet they spend most of their days in front of a computer..you know why?<br>  <br>  They are using the brain to the max, and the brain can burn a LOT of calories when it is high gear.

2SSA9e9Naa	Hadn't heard the term so I looked it up here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID.</a><br>  <br>  Looking at this the reason would be is by its nature a database is designed and intended to be used by multiple people at one time. Thus transactional integrity must be maintained and the separation of each transactions is vital. They cannot interfere with themselves.<br>  <br>  File system implementers are less concerned because each file is managed as a separate entity, there are typically minimal (if any) relationships between them. The likelihood of many users trying to access a single file is much smaller.|`|9f24acea3f336390fe645178a492cd73aa	Basic answer... When two people attempt to write to the same file on a hard drive, one person will get access and be able to write to the file. Once that person is done, the second person will get write access and overwrite the first persons data. Overall there wont be too many people attempting to access the same file on a hard drive at any point in time.<br>  <br>  Databases are different as they tend to have thousands of people attempting to access data at the same time (think about the stock market and all the trades that occur). When you have 1000 people trying to access a database you generally cant tell someone you don't have access quite yet wait a while, that gets annoying especially when you have to wait for 1000 people to finish their jobs. Hence the Isolation part of ACID.<br>  <br>  Consistency refers to the idea that databases are allowed to have some rules associated in them. You can say that a value in column X must be less a value in Column y. This has to hold true no matter what so if a transaction violates this, consistency is broken and the database erases the transaction as if it never happened. File-Systems generally don't have these types of rules so consistency doesn't really apply.<br>  <br>  Atomicity - Transactions are executed in a all or nothing technique so that if it fails for some reason, the executer can just execute the same query and expect the same data.<br>  <br>  Durability - Both databases and hard drives have this

zorYTX59aa	The famous message "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE"<br>  is typically the result of software which stupidly claims that<br>  they can actually "accelerate" video buffering. This includes <br>  crappy things such as GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI, <br>  Diamond Fire and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at YouTube, Google and Macromedia know this, <br>  and write that in their own FAQs. Thus if you have any kind <br>  of "accelerator"...then dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you do not have one of those moronic utilities, something <br>  on your computer is interfering with YouTube. Thus, please <br>  consider any of these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  problems. I have never strayed away from 9.47, and a lot of <br>  conflicts. I have never strayed away from 9.47 -- and lots of <br>  "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think of those 2 like Windows XP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  I've saved my favorite other solution for the end. YouTube is<br>  at its best when you clear all your "Cookies", "History" and <br>  "Temporary Internet Files". My cool "CHTIF" triple-cure has <br>  resolved hundreds of people's problems, so why not yours?<br>  Close out YouTube, do the following, then shutdown/reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  I hope my multiple answer is helpful for you. If you are able<br>  to determine the "cause" and its "cure", I would appreciate<br>  it if you could please let me know, either by clicking on my <br>  avatar or emailing me at "inukjuak90@yahoo.com".<br>  <br>  Note 1: YouTube vids only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers may be shilling, because they <br>  are really disguised salespeople & peddlers. Their answers<br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of idiotic<br>  answer is: "Despite the fact that you can't watch or access <br>  videos at all, buy our downloader." [my paraphrase]<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS FIREFOX 3 AND ITS <br>  INTERACTION WITH YOUTUBE'S (GOOGLE'S) "CACHE" SERVERS<br>  THAT REFUSE THE PLUG-IN'S REQUEST FOR VIDEO FILES. THIS <br>  RETURNS A FALSE ERROR CODE TO YOUTUBE SAYING THAT IT <br>  CAN'T FIND THE VIDEO, OR THAT THE REQUEST DOESN'T MAKE <br>  SENSE.<br>  <br>  OF COURSE, THE VIDEOS ARE REALLY THERE, BUT FOR SOME <br>  STRANGE REASON, YOUTUBE RETRANSMITS THE ERRONEOUS <br>  CODE TO A "THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE" MESSAGE.<br>  WHAT'S THE SOLUTION? NOBODY KNOWS, BUT IT IS A FIREFOX<br>  AND YOUTUBE ISSUE.

isadV8SHaa	That depends totally on how good of a password you have chosen.<br>  <br>  If everyone knows that you have a goldfish named Fluffy, and you gush all the time about how great it is to take Fluffy for a walk, and you wear Goldfish t-shirts with Fluffy printed across the back, then it would be just plain stupid to use fluffy as a password for anything.  Or fluffy1 or fluffy01<br>  <br>  In reality, it doesn't have to be that obvious to guess most people's passwords.  The number one bad password that people pick for things is literally the word "password".  A close second is to use the username as the password (this is so common that many places now refuse to allow you to use your username as a password).  People also frequently use the names of their pets or children, or the birthdates and anniversary dates.  All of these things are horrible passwords.<br>  <br>  Here is a list of the top 500 most common bad passwords.

So, if your drives have different buffer sizes, one will most probably be slower than the other, so the fastest one will wait until data is written.<br>  <br>  On different sized drives, normally the smallest one will become the bottleneck and you'll have to format them at 250 gb (in your example).

rHqe7oMoaa	Do NOT click on anything in the email. If you have done so already, change your password & contact Paypal just to be safe. It could be a phising email.<br>  <br>  LOG IN to your Paypal account and see if there are any notifications there. If someone has tried to add money from your bank account, there will be notification there. If there is nothing there, it is a fake email designed to get your information. <br>  <br>  If the information IS there, change your password and contact Paypal just to be safe. <br>  <br>  <br>  ***Removing your Bank account from Paypal is useless, because they keep all of your information on file and will still attempt to withdraw the money from your account, whether you allow it (now) or not, because when you added the account, you gave them carte blanche permission to withdraw/deposit from/to your bank account.|`|AA10595519	Send me your money?<br>  <br>  Honestly, I have worked with Paypal and they are alright. You have to remember the person you are talking to is not Paypal but rather a person. You have to find a way for that person to rush your issue. I have a feeling your issue is going to take a few days because you have to understand you have paypal (bank) who hires people to manually oversee the transactions and you have another bank who has to input the money. It takes a few days to do this.<br>  <br>  My issue took weeks but I was debating a criminal online purchase.<br>  <br>  I would ask for the fee to come from paypal. I am sure they might help you.

The more you divide the work the better.<br>  <br>  That and windows only recognizes 4 GB|`|zk69CMPyaa	Yeah hey its safe dont worry go n put it in. just ur new ram will operate the same speed as your slowest ram stick. its fine dont worry =]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]...
iWi1qWi8aa	No it is not. Something about the upload process was wrong and the files didn't make it.On average, mp3 files should be about 1,2 Mb per minute.<br>  <br>  Solution : Re-upload the files until the full size gets there. <br>  <br>  Where are you uploading them? Mail servers might be experiencing difficulties, or you could be out of space.. Ftp servers might be configured to limit upload size, or such. Many things could go wrong about uploading files.<br>  <br>  By the way, after ripping them, could you play the files? Perhaps the ripping process in itself was unsuccessful. Vista has trouble ripping to mp3, and some media player programs as well.|`|583ff46a929130f3c37248e696cedbabaa	yupz. exactly small file|`|XlyLakYAaa	There's absolutely no way those files are 44bytes.

3LIzti5maa	is shouldnt make any difference<br>  if youv got an old computer it will take longer to proccess and display the information<br>  so less resolution will take less time to appear on the screen<br>  it must be a really slow computer though<br>  or maybe you just need to update the drivers for the graphix card
GxXpvNIwaa	For the pop up, you can block it manually under the steps.<br>  <br>  Step1<br>  Press the Esc key one time. If this does not help, press Ctrl, Alt, and<br>  Delete keys all at the same time. If a programs screen appears, select end task and left click your mouse one time. If another screen appears select end task and left click your mouse one more time. Hopefully your mission is accomplished with this five second procedure. <br>  Step2<br>  If step one worked for you, you'll probably have to do it again each time you connect to the Internet, but only once per visit, until you go into your computer and delete this file that keeps popping up from your computer. <br>  Step3<br>  If the above procedure is working for you, great. However, they may return again as invisible pop ups. When you're computer appears to be stalling for longer than normal, try the above procedure again, to see if the same program screen reappears. (Invisible pop ups are done away with in the same manner). <br>  Step4<br>  If the procedure mentioned above did not help, disconnect from the Internet. Press Start, then control panel, then Internet preferences.<br>  Delete cookies and search history. <br>  Step5<br>  If the above attempts were not enough, delete the user name and use<br>  another one. <br>  Step6<br>  If the above attempts were not enough yet, you should ran an anti-spyware software ,then clean your registry make it faster.<br>  Recommend:<br>  Scan your Spyware/Adaware<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com</a> [if you do not have one]|`|7TqFISbtaa	you tried downloading and scanning wit Malwarebyte ?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?tag=mncol" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant...</a>

I have a 4gb, they're pretty common and pretty cheap now.<br>  <br>  If it's too big for your flash drive, enable disk usage on your ipod (main ipod screen in your itunes window), then go to the finder and look for your iPod in "devices". Drag and drop the movie into the ipod, then just plug it into the next computer and reverse the process
1I29tpbXaa	One of the ways I do it is find the video I want on youtube. Then put kick in front of youtube once you find the video.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FROxZ5i67k" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FROxZ5i6...</a> <br>  to <br>  <a href="http://kickyoutube.com/watch/?v=4FROxZ5i67k" rel="nofollow">http://kickyoutube.com/watch/?v=4FROxZ5i...</a><br>  <br>  Download it to an mp4. You do this by clicking MP4 and then hitting the go button. Once you push the go button "down" will appear. Right click and pick the option where it says "save target as". Save it to a any location you want.<br>  <br>  Now you will have to convert that MP4 to a wmv. I do this by a program called Any Video Converter. It is a free program you can download.<br>  <br>  In that program, Any Video Converter, add the video that you just downloaded from youtube. For the profile make sure you choose .wmv. Then just convert. It doesn't take long to do this. By default the output folder that this program will send your newly converted video can be found in my documents under any video converter.<br>  <br>  In Power Point go to insert and choose movies and sounds. Then go to movie file and find the video.|`|oncNhLqZaa	well<br>  <br>  Very easy for u with E.M.

This isn't true. Computer Science is the catch-all programming degree. It teaches you how to analyze and produce efficient algorithms, teaches you data structures, and has a wide range of minors / specialties that you can choose from. This is what I would recommend if you're interested in going into programming as a career. Computer Engineering is focusing on software-hardware interactions. This includes things varying from what transistors are, how processors work, integrated circuits, all the way to writing drivers for devices. Computer Engineering is not what you'd want to do, unless you want to actually be the one developing the consoles. If you'd like to mostly program, I'd go with computer science.|`|b2qdwABVaa	It is to my understanding that to become a game developer or computer engineer, you must obtain a bachelor's degree at an accredited college in Computer Science (which will be more suitable for game development) and Computer Engineering (which will be more suitable for programming pc's).

AA11763018	It's a little bit tricky<br>  <br>  You will need to use these functions<br>  ? ROW  returns the row number of a cell<br>  ? COLUMN returns the column number of a cell<br>  Using the row number and column number you have a way to identify a cell, its like the cell address<br>  ? ADDRESS given a row number and column number it would return the cell name not the value.<br>  Using a cell name you can obtain the cell value<br>  ? INDIRECT using a cell address it will return the cell value<br>  ? CONCATENATE joins several text in one text<br>  <br>  Lets do an example<br>  <br>  On the sheet GOODWAY, the revenue from the company is on cell B67. And you want to show this value on the COVER SHEET:<br>  <br>  On the COVER SHEET on cell  A2 you have the name of the company GOODWAY<br>  <br>  using the above functions<br>  =row(A2) returns the row number value 2<br>  =column(A2) returns the column number 1<br>  =ADDRESS(ROW(A2),COLUMN(A2)) returns the cell name $A$2<br>  =INDIRECT(ADDRESS(ROW(A2),COLUMN(A2))) returns the cell value GOODWAY<br>  uff...we got the company name ... so the formula to obtain the company/tab name is INDIRECT(ADDRESS(ROW(A2),COLUMN(A2)))<br>  <br>  Now, you need to reference the revenue on cell B67 from the sheet GOODWAY, this means you need to concatenate the previous formula with the rest of information needed to reference the cell B67 on the GOODWAY sheet. This formula is<br>  =CONCATENATE(<br>  (INDIRECT(<br>  ADDRESS(ROW(A2),COLUMN(A2)))),"!B67") <br>  <br>  (the above formula goes in one line, it didn't show all, so I wrote it in several lines)<br>  <br>  Let's say that you write the above formula on the Cell B2 (from your cover sheet) then you will get the value Goodway!B67 <br>  <br>  Thats the reference to the sheet and cell where the revenue is.<br>  <br>  Up to now<br>  A2 has the name of the tab/company<br>  B2 shows the reference to the cell where the revenue is (Goodway!B67), but you need to show the value<br>  <br>  Remember the function INDIRECT. So on the cell C2 from your COVER sheet you write the formula<br>  =INDIRECT(B2) and this will return the revenue from the cell B67 on the sheet GOODWAY<br>  <br>  That's it .|`|yJxs6q0kaa	I think you already have your answer, but I would recommend restructuring your file to make it easier. Instead of having 500 sheets, you should have it in a single sheet. For example, columnA would list the company names, columnB could be 2008 Revenue, columnC could be 2009 Revenue or whatever. This way, with a simple vlookup formula, you can update your cover or summary sheet, and you can easily update for any number just by replacing the column.|`|SgQa4zjTaa	If the tabname is in cell A20...<br>  =INDIRECT(A20 & "!A1")<br>  <br>  The INDIRECT function returns a reference to a cell. You can use it to create a reference from letters and numbers in other cells.<br>  <br>  BTW: in Excel, "tabs" are called sheets.

Running taskkill /? will give you more info on how to filter out PID, USER, etc. However, you should be careful with the command above. If executed, it might kill processes that the machine relies on. For this very reason, it is a safer approach to kill the processes you DON'T want vs leaving the processes you DO want.<br>  <br>  Another approach would be to kill the explorer tree and avoid the processes you would like to keep<br>  <br>  taskkill /F /FI "IMAGENAME ne yours.exe" /IM explorer.exe /T

Most standalone DVD players (esp. older ones) can't read DVD discs burned at fast speeds since the burn depth is shallower than the slower speeds.<br>  <br>  Other reasons for choppy playback includes scratched/damaged disc, incompatible format (eg. DVD +/- R(W/AM)), disc burning software, etc<br>  <br>  NB: Not all players can read RW discs ...

Since you want to make it like the first day do that. It should be reinstalling/uninstalling everything.<br>     Wait until; its done 30 Minutes to an Hour, and then some on-screen instructions will come up. Follow those and your good to go.

Search youtube.com for "format+xp" without quotes to get good guidance on formatting issues.  Do search "fdisk" (without quotes) if you feel the need to redefine your logical partition.

(That means that if you're downloading a file, or running Skype, while you're playing, you'll probably see some lag.  A 5mbps connection is about all a single computer can use these days - that would mean 5 simultaneous full-speed downloads at once, or 4 and a game running at full speed.)|`|kUpAQ65Kaa	Shouldn't be a problem, 5 Mbps Down and 1.5 Mbps up.<br>  <br>  I prefer you get Verizon FiOS or wait for it to come out for your area.<br>  <a href="http://www22.verizon.com/Residential/FiOSInternet/" rel="nofollow">http://www22.verizon.com/Residential/FiO...</a><br>  <br>  Starting plan is the same price as Road Runner, but you get double the speeds.<br>  10 Mbps Down and 2 Mbps up.<br>  <br>  You would have literally NO lag what-so-ever on ANY game.

If they refuse, file a complaint with Paypal for the same amount.<br>  <br>  If it's only a small amount, its' probably not worth it - If it was a big item with a high postage cost though then I would consider it.

RAM cleaners are nonsense and there is absolutely no technical reason to use them. It is a left-over from the days of DOS which did not have virtual memory. It was sometime spossible to remove small programs or relocate them so that you would have more memory available for a program (640 KB was the max, and 1 MB the max adressable memory).<br>  <br>  You can reduce the numbers of programs in "startup" so less is running. You can also stop unnecessary WIndows services. Memory is managed by the virtual memory manager and it is quite good. In a 32-bit operating system you can have 2-3 GB of physical memory, and your memory space is 2**31 - 1 bytes (theoretically).

QUQY3HQYaa	Yes at the very worst you will get a little message that pops up saying would you like to run this in compatibility mode for windows XP when it gets ported to the school computer.|`|XlyLakYAaa	The OS is completely irrelevant to the software that's installed on it.  Now, if one is running Office 2007 and the other is running Office 2003, you might have a problem.  I'd recommend saving the file as an Office 2003 version to avoid problems.|`|ibeFIUpkaa	XP and Vista doesn't matter with a PowerPoint presentation.<br>  What will matter is the Version of PowerPoint and how you save it.<br>  If your school has Office 2007 and you save it as a pptx And you only have Office 2003 or Office 2003 you won't be able to edit it.<br>  <br>  If the school has Office 2007 and you have Office 2003 or 2000 at home Save the File as a .ppt (no x) and you should be good for the most part.)|`|C32K8iQVaa	If your Microsoft Powerpoint is a newer version than the ones you have at school (all schools use outdated stuff) then heres what to do:<br>  <br>  1. Open your completed project<br>  <br>  2. Select File>Save As<br>  <br>  3. When the menu appears there should be some bars at the bottom, one is for naming your file and the other one below it is for selecting the files format.<br>  <br>  Select the bar that talks about formats (.pp .doc .exe, these kind of formats.) There should then be some options to save in compatibility for older versions of Microsoft PowerPoint.<br>  <br>  When you save in an older version sometimes some special effects you have added may be lost, but it ensures you will have something that works. Try not to save in a severely old file format, personally I would save the same project in multiple formats, because the newest version of power point file you can get to work at your school, the better.<br>  <br>  So ya, save in multiple different formats and try them all when you get to school.<br>  <br>  Note: multiple formats are available when saving with microsoft word, so I have assumed the same for powerpoint.<br>  If only one format is available then just try that and see what happens.<br>  <br>  Hope I was of Help to you.|`|WxmVxTpZaa	Yes it will work properly because it depends on the program. If you have a later version of PPT on Vista and earlier version on Xp it might not open. It could open if you have a newer version on Xp but an older version on Vista. <br>  You can also open it on a Mac as long its not a newer version.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|YESUhp8gaa	Yes, although if your computer uses office 2007 and the other uses 2003 or below save it as 97-2003 compatible

Visit their web sites to review them, and sign in if you want.<br>  <br>  Then perhaps download and use a free template from one of many templates web sites, then upload your site to your free host (use a free FTP program to upload your site - e.g. Core FPT Lite.

Many free hosts require their company name to be added to your URL as a sub domain, (e.g. my site.their sub domain.com) and you may have to add one of their ads (link or banner) to your site. <br>  <br>  You could start with a blog as well, e.g. try the Google’s blogger or the advanced Wordpress (which you can add plugins for enhancement), or use the simple Google Page Creator (soon to be changed to Google Sites - You need a Gmail account) - easy to set up for a beginner. <br>  <br>  There are free (and easy) web site building tools, such as Weebly (Using drag and drop), Snap Pages (Good for sharing photos), and Edicy Pages (Various templates/themes similar to Blogger and Wordpress).<br>  <br>  Later on though, it might pay to learn html/JavaScript/PHP etc, which allows more flexibility to design and modify your web site.

iWi1qWi8aa	Yes that does make sense. What you are asking for is illegal and I cannot provide you with direct links.<br>  <br>  What I can do is direct you to torrent software. Best one out there is uTorrent and you can get it at :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.utorrent.com/</a><br>  <br>  It is free and definitely virus free. I've been successfully using it for years now.<br>  <br>  After installing it, you can look for torrent trackers on google. I can't help you there but searching for "mp3 torrent" for example gives you good results. If you find any that need you to register and create an user name, search again. You don't want the hassle of having an account on any torrent sites.<br>  <br>  The final step is finding a torrent describing what you want ( you'll want to search for artists, albums and discographies.. single songs are harder to come by ) and downloading it. uTorrent will do the rest. If in doubt, consult uTorrent manual and help online, it is extensive.<br>  <br>  It is all very safe and you should have no problem with viruses using torrents. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|XlyLakYAaa	There are indie tracks where you can download music for free and safely.  Unfortunately, things like Limewire and other places where you ILLEGALLY download music will never be safe.|`|gz2JF00Saa	That is not really going to happen, and it will not be legal. <br>  <br>  If you don't want viruses, you should not use windows.|`|a386ef2869afa3e59c3ae1150654e650aa	IM Me.
y0kPJJBmaa	get into 'device-manager' - look toward the bottom and find the entry called "universal serial bus controllers".<br>  click the + sign and 'uninstall' (right-click) everything in that category WITHOUT restarting the computer until they're all uninstalled. if there is an entry that will not 'uninstall', move on to the next one until you have all of them removed. and don't worry or panic, everything will be put back once you restart the computer. the only difference should be that your usb ports should now be working...
bBvdvqDVaa	If you have everything in 1 string, obviously you'll have error. The better way is to assign the returned value of Request.QueryString() to a variable. Check for correctness and then execute it. The way you code is very dangerous and prone to SQL injection.<br>  <br>  Take into consideration this example. Lets say query string Group contains "-1; drop table Thread;"<br>  <br>  Your SQL becomes:<br>  <br>  SELECT Thread.ID, Thread.GroupID, Thread.Author, Thread.Title, Thread.InitialPostDate, Thread.MostRecentPostDate, [User].UserName<br>  From Thread<br>  Where Thread.GroupID = -1; drop table Thread;<br>  INNER JOIN [User]<br>  ON Thread.Author = [User].ID<br>  <br>  which essentially deletes your table. Also, if query string Group value is "" (empty string), your query would become <br>  <br>  SELECT Thread.ID, Thread.GroupID, Thread.Author, Thread.Title, Thread.InitialPostDate, Thread.MostRecentPostDate, [User].UserName<br>  From Thread<br>  Where Thread.GroupID = <br>  INNER JOIN [User]<br>  ON Thread.Author = [User].ID<br>  <br>  which is also a SQL error.<br>  <br>  So the moral of the story, never use external string directly to your SQL code. Put it in a variable first, then check for correctness and check for security. After you're confident it is safe, only then execute it.

You need them both to be able to access the internet. <br>  <br>  TCP - gets data from a network to another.<br>  IP  -  It allows the internet to actually work.<br>  <br>  Together the two make the internet. You cant go from go from network to another without giving an address to the network (ip). The TCP standard allows the communication to actually function so one IP can communicate with another IP.

xERzGZ6Baa	There are a several reasons why your computer is freezing/slow. First question is when the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  Go to:<a href="http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectiveregistrycleaner.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...</a> get one to free scan your pc<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.<br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your computer.<br>  <br>  4. That last area is a hardware driver. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestions and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing/speed up.<br>  Check your drivers.

Look for files you saved that you no longer need. Delete internet cookies, temporary files and history. Uninstall programs like games you no longer need or use. Empty recycle bin <br>  Then run Defragmentator<br>  That should help.|`|W27qNJJGaa	In order to free up space on your hard drive, I would first suggest to delete any programs that you rarely use. To uninstall programs, go to control panel (Which is in the Start menu) and find Programs and Features. Wait for the list to populate, then look at what you do and don't need. Right-click on unwanted programs and choose uninstall, then wait for the uninstaller to finish the process. After taking out all the unnecesary programs, I'd suggest deleting files from you temporary folders. The "Temp" folder is in the "Local" folder, which is in the "Users" folder, at least for Vista. After deleting the files in that folder, run Disk Defragmenter. To go to it go: Start Menu, All Programs, Accessories, then System Tools. Don't do anything while it's running (It may take a while). Hardware wise, you may want to consider getting more RAM. If you are running XP, you need at LEAST 256 MB, for Vista, at least 1 GB. Send me a message if you need help getting the system information to find out how much RAM you have, or how to get to the temporary folder.|`|KeGsrdyuaa	i would recommend uninstalling all games you do not play more than once a week - month. after that, download ccleaner. it helps to remove useless files.|`|Ct44mTj8aa	Have u ever defrag your disc

DjR6rKuUaa	hi<br>  <br>  MSN Messenger Error Code - 81000314<br>  The Symptoms you get<br>  When you launch MSN Messenger and try to logon, you get an error message 81000314.  A wild guess, there is a problem with the MSN Server.<br>  The Cause of Code 81000314<br>  The Microsoft MSN server is down or otherwise unavailable.  If it is indeed Microsoft's MSN problem, then be careful not to make matters worse, for example don't try mending something that does not need mending and thus breaking a perfectly good system. <br>  Another possibility is that Softpub.dll may have become unregistered.  <br>  Solutions to MSN Error Code 81000314<br>  1) Wait for the MSN Server to return!  Meanwhile check the status of the Messenger service, at: <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/Status.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://messenger.msn.com/Status.aspx</a><br>  2) Delete ListCache.dat<br>  Launch CMD and navigate to %appdata%\microsoft.<br>  CD %appdata%\microsoft<br>  Dir /s ListCache.dat <br>  Decide if you want to delete the cache.<br>  Del /s ListCache.dat <br>  Restart your MSN Messenger. <br>  3) Register softpub.dll.<br>  Click Start (Button), and then click Run, type regsvr32 softpub.dll.  Restart MSN Messenger.<br>  It would do no harm to also use regsvr32 to re-register: wintrust.dll and initpki.dll<br>  4) Another problem could be firewall related, thus try temporarily disabling the firewall.  If this cures the problem, make sure that MSN Messenger is allowed full access through the firewall.<br>  <br>  <br>  ->>Summary of MSN Error Code 81000314<br>  If you are suffering from MSN Error Code 81000314, check that the server is available at Microsoft's end. at: <a href="http://messenger.msn.com/Status.aspx." rel="nofollow">http://messenger.msn.com/Status.aspx.</a>  Beware of doing anything to make the problem worse, when it could be the servers fault.<br>  <br>  <br>  ????????*`?. ? ??ρε ? ?εlρε??.?* ????????<br>  ☆   <br>  ::: (\(\ <br>  *: (=' :') :* <br>  ?..

This normally won't take longer then a few minutes/hours. For more information you can check the .NET Messenger Service Status<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Please note that the Service Status is known to not always be very accurate, if problems do appear the best thing to do is wait them out. Surely there are many other very interesting things to do. If the error keeps bothering you for over a few days there are some more things you can try below.<br>  <br>  If the error continues to appear it is most likely because the Windows digital signatures system is damaged or corrupt. To resolve this you will have to register several dll files that are required for Messenger. You can do this automatically by running a batch file we created or if you prefer by executing the commands yourself.<br>  Automatic solution<br>  <br>  First you will have to download this zip file which includes a batch file that can register the dll files for you.

Nothing is wrong with your computer or ur msn, its just temporarily un-avalible, the only thing best to do is be patient and wait. Doing anything else can damage MSN and make a more serious problem.

The people didn't tell them that unless they provided the software for Microsoft Office they automatically loaded Microsoft works, which is useless for them.<br>  <br>  You simply have to reload the software the same way you did the first time.

But if the computer came with Microsoft pre-installed, and you don't have the Office CD, you'll have to explain that to the "professional".<br>  <br>  Sorry I can't be more help.  :-(|`|3OpZuIByaa	Do you have the CD? You just need the CD and should be able to reinstall again. As long as it's a legit copy, you can reinstall it. If you don't have the CD but know it's a legit copy, you might be able to call Microsoft and get a replacement.  You can get Office 2003 pretty cheap now, if you want the new one, its' a bit more difficult and more expensive. Your other route is to download open office. Open Office is free, it works like word, excel etc, it's just not made my microsoft. It's free, so consider that if you have no way of retrieving your office suite.

In other words, you can run a PC within an running Windows (or Mac or Linux) application.<br>  <br>  On the side of the "virtualized" OS, it doesn't really know that it's not running on real hardware. This is the job of the virtualization software.<br>  <br>  Virtualization software include:<br>  <br>  - Microsoft Virtual PC<br>  - VMWare Workstation<br>  - Parallels Desktop (for Mac)<br>  <br>  Virtualization is usefull if you want to test software on an operating system that is different than yours, or if you expect that the installation might ruin your OS. It's a safe way of formatting your "C:" drive without actually damaging it because the virtualized OS formats "its" C: drive which is different that your real one (its C: drive is actually simply a file on your hard drive).<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	It is where you can do everything, including operate, your server online.

It's not microsoft office, but you can make them save as word and excel documents and works just the same, but the only difference is, is that it's free. I'd say give it a try.

WinXP handles log on in one of four modes:<br>  <br>  1.  domain -- requires you to enter a username and password (and sometimes choose from a list of domains) to log on.  this is probably the mode used by your computer at work.<br>  <br>  2.  workgroup -- no username or password required.  when WinXP runs in this mode, turning the computer on will lead to a desktop without prompting for a username or password.  the default user account is automatically logged on, and no password is assigned to this account.<br>  <br>  3.  workgroup -- select user dialogue.  when WinXP runs in this mode, a list of user accounts is presented after bootup.  clicking a user results in loading that user's desktop.

Sin duda la mejor fusión de calidad + rapidez & seguridad. Puedes ingresar a su página: <a href="http://aresgalaxy.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://aresgalaxy.sourceforge.net/</a> para que estés mejor informada, pero que mejor que la opinión de un cibernauta que por a?os ha trabajado con numerosos programar p2p y sin duda ha elegido el mejor. Muchos dicen que el Ares te dá mucho problema con los virus y trojanos pero está comprobado que con la nueva tecnología y su sistema de filtro reduce los riesgos, por supuesto que necesitas también de un buen antivirus y el que posees es uno muy bueno. Espero te sirva para tomar la mejor decisión, y un plus+: <a href="http://www.tv-links.co.uk/index.do/1#" rel="nofollow">http://www.tv-links.co.uk/index.do/1#</a> ahí puedes encontrar cualquier película, serie, comedia o cartoon que necesites!!! échale un ojo a esta web, está de 10!|`|DMpCK8Kzaa	ares|`|c77bbc6fd026c0f5ff1ed18436525749aa	La verdad me parecen malos los tres porque los he provado.Y la verdad ninguno es perfecto.|`|mj6eeEwnaa	yo pienso que lime wire en estados unidos todo mundo lo usa y personal mente esta libre de virus|`|HIUavkgNaa	WWW.LIMEWIRE.COM/DOWNLOADS|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	ares|`|28QsnUq6aa	Yo uso y simpre usare ARES<br>  <br>  Ahora te digo lo siguente todos los progrmas p2p contienen virus, no hay excepciones, TODOS.<br>  <br>  ventajas y desventajas de programas p2p<br>  <br>  ARES: ventajas, Muy facil de usar, muchos archivos disponibles(podras encontrar todos lo que quieras), salas de chat, Beneficios<br>  <br>  Desventajas: Muy inseguro, Lento en ocasiones.<br>  <br>  Limewire: Ventajas: Facil de usar, Filtros para archivos<br>  <br>  Desventajas: Lento en la carga de inicio, Poca disponibilidad de archivos, archivos con formato dificil de usar.<br>  <br>  eMULE: Ventajas: Rapido, Disponibilidad considerable de archivos, salas de chat y ayuda.<br>  <br>  Desventajas: Es de ley conpartir algo o no te baja nada, Poco seguro, Dificl de manejar.<br>  <br>  En fin Te recomiendo ARES pero eso si tambien un buen antivirus.|`|gJ8cexfjaa	Te recomiendo mejor el TORRENT que es más extenso que los que mencionas y las peliculas viene en la misma calidad de DVD.

Mi ordenata arranca muy lento porque le tengo enganchados tres antivirus y un antispy ; menos uno, el Mcafe de telefónica, el resto bajados gratuitos de la red.<br>  Para tu pregunta, mi respuesta. Mejor Ares, pero seguro, seguro... ninguno.<br>  No sé en que país te encuentras, pero en Europa  los profesionales utilizan SOFTONIC.COM para bajar programas, para bajar softwar. Es buenísimo y el que yó utilizo. Por sud.america, lo están pidiendo pero aún no anda. Hay modalidad de bajada gratuita y modalidad con pago de uno o dos sms. Yo siempre he bajado el de por la cara...y sin problemas.<br>  Espero haberte ayudado algo.

Si tu as telecharge des elements apres avoir reinstalle le jeu, cela n'a surement rien a voir avec le fait que le jeu ait ete en soit reinstalle mais plus avec le fait qu'il y a un fichier corrompu qui fait crasher le jeu.<br>  il faut donc extraire tous les noveuaux fichiers telecharges depuis que le jeu crash et les replacer dans le dossier un a un afin de trouver la source du probleme... C'est long car il faut chaque fois relancer le jeu et quitter apres chaque fichier, mais c'est la seule facon de detecter le fichier qui provoque le bug!<br>  Je parle d'experience...

2c48b3bd7e6ca9cfd29d601e87ea4eedaa	Acid is a program used for making music loops, or putting together a bunch of audio files to make a song or something.  Sound Forge is used primarily for sound recording and editing.  You can do looping in Sound Forge, but it's a lot easier to do it in Acid.  The Audio Studio version of Sound Forge is a less packed version than regular Sound Forge.  You get a lot more features in regular Sound Forge that are not available in the Audio Studio version.<br>  <br>  Summary: They both have their different purposes.  If you want to create music with audio files, then Acid is your best bet.  If you just want audio editing and production, then Sound Forge is your best bet.

First, make a copy of the temp folder to some other place -- ex: c:\oopsie.  Then, back in the temp folder, change the view to "details".  Find the "date modified" column, and click it.  This will sort the temp files by date.  My recommendation would be not to delete the most recent files.

(so that's a pro for LimeWire), and LimeWire is also easier to use when it comes to an unexperienced user, just click type of media and type it. LimeWire works basically by sharing score, the more you share the more priority you get when asking for files, it will place you first in line (so that's another pro). CONS in limewire are that limewire is much heavier than emule, because of all the graphic features and integrated media player, and it will upload files based on order of request, first asked, first shared. Another CON for limewire is the fact that most files are uploaded fully and not by chunks, plus limewire will bother you until the end of your days asking you to go pro, that way all those priorities for people sharing files will be given to you for a small fee.<br>  <br>  Emule on the other hand is a little bit more complicated, but it is completely free and it will never ask you to go PRO, because it already is (it is a software constantly being updated by volunteer developers all around the world) but when it comes to large files, this is the way to go, because emule is lighter and uses less memory to run and less % of your processor core; Emule works in download/upload file by priority (this opton can be changed by the user), which means that if there is a rare file that is hard to find, or is not very popular, or may be highly demanded by many users, then emule will automatically give priority to that file (OR CHUNK of file) for upload, that way, if you already downloaded the first half of the file, instead of standing in line behind another user for the second half, you will be granted access to that second half and the user that doesn't have either one of the halfs on his computer will be asking for that file from your computer, that way instead of both of you waiting for the same file from the same user, once you or him gets a little chunk of that file, it will be automatically shared among the rest of the community, and they will share that little chunk with the new people requesting the file, that way the users with the biggest chunks will be given priority to that file. <br>  <br>  In plain english, if you have a song that half of the network already have, and a file that is rarely found, the rare file will be given priority to be shared instead of the other one.<br>  <br>  So if you are downloading relatively small files (under 10mb) you can go limewire, but if you are downloading above that amount, go emule. I have experience using both, and I prefer emule one thousand times. but again, it all depends in how appealing the interface appears to you. good luck

55474b711a6c2377665e85b5c171cfc6aa	Hola!!! Es muy probable que tengas en tu ordenador un spyware que se ejecuta en segundo plano y que dirige tu explorador a esa página cuando lo abres. <br>  Instala un buen antivirus como Avast. Utiliza el buscador de tu explorador para encontrar las páginas desde donde puedas descargarlo.<br>  Instala un buen anti-spy como Ad-Aware, que puedes obtener desde las pagina de lavasoft.com.<br>  Luego, procede según lo siguiente :<br>  1) Ejecuta la utilidad de liberación de espacio en disco.<br>  2) Borra los Archivos Temporales de Internet, cookies, e historial. <br>  3) Desactiva cualquier programa "sospechoso" de la lista de inicio del msconfig .

La cosa es saber bajo que condiciones efectuaste las mediciones, pues si lo hiciste con todos los componentes desconectados, debes de tener en cuenta que siempre se producen caídas de voltaje cuando la fuente esta conecta a todos los dispositivos del hard. De todas formas, para tu seguridad, te recomiendo que adquieras un estabilizador de tensión, para evitar los sobrevoltajes de tu red domiciliaria.<br>  Saludos!!!|`|8a995168567c3f31ac1972408f70b47baa	se quema desconectalo|`|4d12750f99bb26cbec6ff6d0f55142f1aa	El tema es electronico y depende de la fuente de alimentacion, en tu casa recibes corriente alterna, la fuente entre otras cosas la depura y la convierte en continua y estable y la distibuye uniformememte, si la pce es nueva es dificil que tengas problemas con eso, lo que estas viendo es posible que sea una conexion por el tipo de voltaje, que puede ser con un dispositivo menor porque el mother necesita mas de 3.3v, asi que no es para preocuparse, es solo uns info.<br>  Saludos|`|f65844032aed1bb3b4a62c57756582d9aa	Si te refieres al voltaje dle microprocesador, no hay ningún problema.

yGQEnXYgaa	So you are looking for free PSP downloads? There is one thing you need to understand first: there is nothing like a free PSP download. Of course there are free PSP download sites, but they are illegal and you will be getting into BIG trouble using these services.<br>  <br>  But there are other sites that offer free PSP downloads that are legal. You only have to pay a onetime membership fee. After that you may download as many PSP songs, games, and movies as you can handle forthe rest of your life Membership to these donwload sites is low and varies. You will have to pay around $30 for unlimited access.<br>  <br>  So once you paid your membership fee you have free PSP downloads for life. A pretty good deal and honestly... don't you think it is a good idea to stay legal?|`|AA10023955	Free Flash games - <a href="http://www.psponme.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.psponme.com</a><br>  Free Videos - <a href="http://psp.connect.com" rel="nofollow">http://psp.connect.com</a><br>  Free Videos - <a href="http://www.guba.com/home_free" rel="nofollow">http://www.guba.com/home_free</a><br>  Free Movies and such - <a href="http://www.archive.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.archive.org</a>

You can download Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 from Microsoft for free and install Edubuntu in a virtual PC that you child can use.

D29KPqRqaa	WinAntiSpyware is spyware itself. There is also a program called WinAntivirus Pro. They are both spyware. You should get an good spyware removal program and remove it ASAP. I would suggest picking up a copy of Webroot Spysweeper. Great software. You can download a trial and use it to remove any spyware you currently have. It is possible that you have a piece of spyware that a program can not remove, in which case you will need to know how to remove it manually, or find somebody who does. Either way, you likely have more spyware than JUST WinAntiSpyware. Hope this helps.|`|3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	Concur with Alvis.

Guess what? Even if it looks like it is, the internet is not in your computer.  It is on a server a couple of rooms down and the IT personel has control of it.  They are they only one with administrating powers to delete anything.  So, you are leaving behind a trail brighter than than the "yellow brick road"  and pretty soon you'll be fired.

With IE and other browsers, you have a temp folder, a cookies folder, and a history folder which all store temporary records of the sites you have visited. However, they are easy to remove. Firstly in IE you can simply go to tools and delete browsing history, however that will wipe the temp memory from all sites you've visted, so load times may take longer the next time u get on because you have no cache of that page. You can also access your disk clean up and clean the temp folders, delete the cookies and clean ur harddrive if your using a windows based PC.|`|fGtpB3Heaa	stop looking at stuff ya aint suppose to .. get back to work :)
CKhwBbTkaa	The answer to the first part of your question is yes, maybe. It depends upon how your desktop computer is hooked to the internet. If you are hooked up through a Router, then the answer is no. If you are on a Local Area Network (LAN) behind your router and your IP address changes, then it is the router that is assigning the IP address. This is through a process called Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). This is primarily for the sake of convenience as DHCP will also assign the addresses for your gateway, and DNS servers as well. In some cases where your router is supplied by your ISP, they may set up these settings in the router. Again this is for your convenience because you will need these settings to access the internet. The IP address assigned to your desktop will be in one of the three Private IP ranges, most likely the 192.168.x.x range.<br>  <br>  If your desktop computer is hooked up directly to the internet either through DSL, Cable or dial-up modem, then the ISP assigns you a new IP address each time you log on to the internet. This may be done either through DHCP, Point to Point Protocol (PPP), or Point to Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE). In this case you will be assigned an IP address in the Public range.<br>  <br>  The primary reason your ISP utilizes a dynamic IP address is because it only has a certain number of public IP addresses. Because IP addresses are used to direct data over the internet every single device hooked to the internet must have a unique IP address. All the IP addresses in the world are currently between 0.0.0.0 and 255.255.255.255.<br>  <br>  The Internet Corporation for Assigned Named and Numbers (ICANN) assigns each ISP a certain block of IP addresses that it is allowed to use, and it cannot use any IP addresses that have not been assigned to it. If each ISP gave each of its users a Static IP Address, then once all of those numbers had been given out they could not sign up any new users. By using Dynamic IP Addressing the ISP can let somebody else use the IP address you were using at one point, when you are no longer using it.<br>  <br>  Dynamic IP addressing also offers a modicum of privacy since it keeps online companies from associating you with a particular IP address.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|b92ed6ec66e5f947f15f4122686a6bc0aa	Most every IP address these days is "dynamic" and is changed by the service provider on a regular basis, typically every 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Why? Because there are a finite number of IP addresses to go around. Dynamic IP assures that only computers that are actually on-line are assigned an IP address.|`|5CzsYARtaa	Yes, if your computer is using something called DHCP (Dynamic Host Control protocol) then it relies on the ISP to 'give' it a number.  Every time you reboot the computer, your dhcp 'asks' the ISP for a new number.  The only way to stop this is to contact the ISP and ask for a 'fixed' ip address for your machine.|`|D29KPqRqaa	Yes, for security purposes. Static IPs can be dangerous if your computer is vulnerable. But you can request a static IP from your ISP, they normally will let you have one if you need it.

lObEjUh1aa	It's hard to be sure whether this is a hardware or software problem, but my first guess is that your operating system is corrupt.  my second guess would be that your hard disk is dying a slow death.<br>  <br>  in either case, your first priority should be to save or backup your data to some external source (an external USB hard disk is ideal).  the easiest way to do this is to build a BartPE CD (though you will need access to a working computer, and your original WinXP disk, to build it).  Bart PE can be obtained by 1. downloading the build application (<a href="http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/#download)" rel="nofollow">http://www.nu2.nu/pebuilder/#download)</a> and 2. using a working computer (with CD burner) and your Windows XP CD to create the disk.<br>  <br>  once built, you can boot from the Bart PE CD.  it creates a "windows-like" environment you can use to copy any data that can be rescued to an external USB hard disk, a USB thumb drive, a network share, or whatever form of external storage you prefer.  at a minimum, be sure to backup the contents of these folders:<br>  c:\documents and settings\<username>\my documents<br>  c:\documents and settings\<username>\favorites<br>  c:\documents and settings\<username>\desktop<br>  <br>  Also be sure to find any .PST files and back them up as well (these are MS Outlook mailbox archives and are typically several hundred megabytes to several gigabyes in size).<br>  <br>  only after your data is safely copied to a backup would I recommend attempting to resolve whatever is preventing your laptop from booting.<br>  <br>  can Windows boot successfully into safe mode? (repeatedly press F5, about one press per second, during the boot process -- this will invoke the Windows boot menu and will allow you to select safe mode).  if you can boot into safe mode, but cannot boot normally, chances are you have a corrupt OS.  your choices in this scenario (in order of easy - to - hard) are:<br>  <br>  1. automatically repair the OS using your automated system recovery disk (requires you to have created an ASR floppy disk before the failure occurred).  automated system recovery is one of the options available presented when booting from the WinXP CD.<br>  <br>  2. reimage the laptop (requires restore CD or DVD from Toshiba -- should have come with your laptop when you bought it).  if you don't have a recovery CD, it is possible Toshiba support may ship one to you for a nominal charge (typically around $10 - $20 -- if they have one available for your model).  in some cases you can also download an image of the recovery CD and burn same to a blank disk; if Toshiba support makes this available, you will need access to a working computer with a CD burner to create the recovery CD.<br>  <br>  3.  reinstall Windows (will probably require your original MS Windows CD Key / activation code) -- should be on a Certificate of Authenticity sticker attached somewhere to your laptop.  boot from the WinXP CD and follow the on-screen instructions to perform the install.  if you want to attempt to preserve your existing data and applications (there is no guarantee this is possible), chose the option to install Windows without deleting the existing OS installation.  MS does not recommend this because it may result in a corrupt installation, but if it doesn't work, you can always run the Windows install again and choose to delete the old installation first.<br>  <br>  In some cases, an in-place install (MS calls this an "upgrade" install) is able to install just the OS without impacting your applications or personal data.  To be safe, I would be prepared to reinstall any applications by having the application install CD / DVD and license keys on hand.<br>  <br>  Note that if your system is part of a domain, reinstalling Windows will remove your laptop from the domain.  You will need someone with domain administrator rights to add you back (I am assuming this machine is not a domain member, as domain membership implies this is a company-owned PC, in which case the company's IT dept should be doing the recovery for you).<br>  <br>  One final note: I recommend against running any hard disk testing tools until after your data is backed up.  Disk testing tools place a lot of stress on the disk, and if your disk is in the midst of a progressive failure, just running the tool may be enough to push it over the edge.|`|PtqxVmwoaa	Re-install windows with recovery disks.|`|0fd84ba056353594be65eb4771d885ebaa	try reinstalling windows|`|Xy9YbCo5aa	I'm sorry to say, but it sounds like either :<br>  <br>  1. A corrupt Windows install. You will need to reinstall Windows to see if this is the problem. Of course, you will lose all your data, but it sounds like you can't get to it anyway. I would start with this option.<br>  2. A bad hard drive. If you do re-install Windows, and this starts happening again, it could be the hard drive.<br>  3. A bad motherboard. If you install a new HD with a fresh install of Windows, and still experience problems, it is probably the motherboard.<br>  <br>  I know this doesn't sound like the cleancut answer you were hoping for, but in these situations, there rarely is one. My best guess is a bad HDD, regardless of what the utility says.<br>  <br>  Good luck : )|`|AA10957984	This sounds very much like a progressive hard drive failure. <br>  <br>  Bad sectors on a disk can be just that, bad and the repair you describe above can fix them. However, bad sectors can also be caused do to a terminal error on the platter of the hard drive. This can be caused by a number of things but is more common in Laptops since the major cause are the reading heads of the hard drive colliding with the surface of the disk.<br>  <br>  This will show up initially as bad sectors but with quickly deteriorate as the bad area of the disk gets physically bigger and bigger.<br>  <br>  <br>  You could try doing a complete re-install of XP, wiping the existing installation but I strongly suspect that this will only be a temporary fix. A new hard drive is the only sure fire cure.|`|GuBnmZ8naa	I would try using the windows install CD to repair the files again.

zorYTX59aa	If your YouTube is slow, stuck or weird, and people suggest<br>  you either change or install stuff....DON'T TOUCH A THING!<br>  <br>  You don't need to fool around with java scripts, flash players,<br>  firewall settings, anti-virus utilities, active X controls, pop-up <br>  blockers or different browsers. And definitely stay away from <br>  whatever software anybody on this page may try to sell you.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer<br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine at one point, right?<br>  The first rule of thumb and best option should ALWAYS be: <br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  Every day, YouTube often shuts down many of their servers<br>  in order to update stuff. Be patient if your YouTube is slow,<br>  stuck or garbled.

Clicking on "Don't <br>  Accelerate this Website" will not help you whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are <br>  really disguised salespeople and peddlers. Their "answers" <br>  have nothing to do with your question, and their wares may<br>  actually worsen your problem.

mCEpu8fkaa	I'm a PC repairman in the UK and to be honest, I have to agree with you 100% :-)<br>  <br>  Rather than reiterate all you've said, I'll get straight to my theory: I blame the media.<br>  <br>  Many non-technical people expect to buy a PC, switch it on and see a message on the screen saying 'Hello there! Would you like to download the latest films or music album? Just click here and I'll do it for you. There won't be any viruses or anything, just sit back and relax and in five minutes you'll be watching the latest Harry Potter film in perfect high quality.'<br>  <br>  The reason they expect this is, to an extent at least, because some of the larger PC retail companies design their advertising in such a way as to make PCs sound very easy to use and that everything is instant, when in reality It's simply not the case.<br>  <br>  As you, and any other PC savvy person knows, it's rarely a case of just plugging the cables in, switching on, and doing whatever you want. You need to know about software, hardware, security, codecs and a myriad of other god awful technical stuff in order to get any of the stuff done that these large companies claim is a breeze providing that you buy their computers.<br>  <br>  I've lost count of the number of customers who've bought a cheap computer from a well known retailer then turned up at my workshop asking me why they can't find Microsoft Office on it like they can on their computer at work.

Consumers have a lot of power when it comes to a lot of things.  Technical support issues is one of them.  They know that people who work in IT/Tech Support look down on them, so when they got you on the phone, you're supposed to be the solution to all their problems.  They can hear in your tone when you become frustrated and that frustrates them.  They're calling you remember, you need to fix their problem ASAP since North America is all about getting things done with the snap of some fingers.<br>  <br>  People spend so much time working, raising their families, they rarely find the time, or care to want to figure out something new.  New things scare people, they like living in a comfort zone so why should they care about how to configure their TCP/IP for DHCP?  Why should they care about anti-virus/spyware programs, it should just work right?<br>  <br>  However this is also part of the problem.  They make poor decisions about a good many things, your example of purchasing budget computers is an excellent one.  Not only do they typically get some sub-standard system (In my eyes anyways), they're getting one full of bloat, and usually without any kind of decent rescue disk.<br>  <br>  Those of you suggesting Macs, dear God no.  <br>  <br>  1.  Over priced.<br>  2.  Tech support for them isn't the greatest, for a number of things, ISP, hardware, accessories, etc.<br>  3.  No.<br>  <br>  If people keep blaming Windows and Microsoft for all their problems suggest Ubuntu Linux to them.  It goes right over top of their current PC, so no need to spend a mint on a NEW computer if they just got one in the last year or two, it'll significantly speed up the machine, and no worries about spyware or virii.  Most users tend to do basic things, so they won't need all the fancy software that's more readily available with Windows.<br>  <br>  So to sum it up.  PC users are dumb because they want immediate results, expect you, the tech support agent to know how to fix their problem asap, and they're too stubborn to learn things themselves.

It is a patch that will remove the time limitation (though if the trial doesnt have full features you wont get those).

DVE15lCbaa	Mejor cambiate a Kaspersky  Antivirus yo lo tengo y me ha funcionado muy bien.<br>  <br>  Primero: Descárgate una versión prueba de Kaspersky Antivirus, la última versión. Mejor si es Kaspersky Internet Security. Puedes descargarla de su sitio oficial.<br>  <a href="http://www.kaspersky.cl/descargas..." rel="nofollow">http://www.kaspersky.cl/descargas...</a><br>  <br>  Segundo: Procede a desinstalar el antivirus que actualmente tienes en tu PC. Te repito, antes de instalar otro antivirus debes de desinstalar el que ya tienes ya que por lo general dos antivirus en un Sistema Operativo crean conflictos. Reinicia tu PC.<br>  <br>  Tercero: Una vez reiniciado el PC, procede a instalar Kaspersky, como la versión prueba dura 30 días, creo que con eso bastará. Después de instalarlo lo primero que tienes que hacer es actualizarlo (las definiciones de virus), para esto escoge “Update” o “Actualizar definiciones de virus”.<br>  <br>  Cuarto: Apaga el restaurar sistema en "Panel de control", luego escoge "Sistema" luego te sitúas en "Restaurar sistema" marca la casilla para desactivarlo, le das "Aceptar". <br>  <br>  Quinto: Ahora procede a reiniciar tu equipo pero en el modo a prueba de fallos (no iniciar normal, sino que tienes que presionar F8 antes de que cargue el sistema operativo para escoger el Modo a Prueba de Fallos o Modo Seguro).<br>  <br>  Sexto: Una vez iniciado el Sistema Operativo a Prueba de Fallos (Modo Seguro), procede a escanear tu PC con Kaspersky (recuerda que ya tendrías que haber actualizado las definiciones de virus, si ya lo hiciste no hay problema). Una vez escaneado todo el PC. Kaspersky te dará la opción para eliminar todos los virus, spywares, troyanos y demás infecciones de tu PC. Basta con eliminarlos todos. Sería bueno que hicieras de nuevo otro escaneo en busca de virus, por si alguno quedó sin ser detectado. <br>  <br>  Séptimo: Una vez eliminado todos los virus o spywares, reinicia de nuevo tu PC, esta vez déjalo que inicie en modo normal (no presiones ninguna tecla). Una vez iniciado el PC en modo normal, procede a otro escaneo, para que tu compu quede totalmente libre de virus y estés confiado (a) que ahora tu PC si está limpia de amenazas.<br>  <br>  Octavo: Vuelve a activar la opción de Restaurar Sistema.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  El Kaspersky es muy efectivo, siempre y cuando el virus o troyano no sea muy maligno, o lo que es lo mismo que se ejecute desde la BIOS. La mayoría de antivirus son muy buenos para prevenir, pero cuando el virus o troyano ya se ha ejecutado entonces el problema se vuelve serio. Pero nada pierdes con probar con el Kaspersky. <br>  Si se resuelve lo del virus o spyware y no puedes conseguir la activación del Kaspersky (después de los 30 días de prueba), entonces instala el Active Virus Shield (es gratuito y es el hijo del Kasperky), sólo entra a la página oficial del antivirus. Verás que ese antivirus tiene la misma interfaz (la misma presentación) y el mismo motor de búsqueda de Kaspersky. Te protege además de virus de spywares. Sólo está disponible en inglés. Lo ofrece la empresa AOL.<br>  <br>  Aquí lo puedes descargar:<br>  <a href="http://www.activevirusshield.com/antivir..." rel="nofollow">http://www.activevirusshield.com/antivir...</a><br>  <br>  Recuerda:<br>  * Antes de instalar otro antivirus debes de desinstalar el que ya tienes ya que por lo general dos antivirus en un Sistema Operativo crean conflictos.<br>  <br>  * Si tu máquina está infectada (y así parece) entonces el intruso si puede desactivar tu antivirus y firewall con tal de que tenga dominio y control total mientras estés conectado a la web. Te cuidado porque te pueden robar tu información personal.<br>  <br>  * No te olvides que después de eliminar el virus o spyware de tu computador debes de volver a activar la opción de Restaurar Sistema.|`|2r1HdIg8aa	?

You should be able to download the drivers and software from their website, especially if you registered the camera with them when you purchased it.  Worst case, if you can't find anything on their website, give them a call and ask if they can send you a new driver CD or if you can purchase one from them.

And once a file is permanently deleted, for all intents and purposes,  that is it... which is why it is a good idea to make backups of important files.  Run a virus scan, if it comes up clean, your problem might be your hard drive, in which case you will have to replace it.  In either event those files are probably history, you can pay someone who specializes in that sort of thing a lot of money to attempt to find the information you lost.  Odds are they still won't be able to do it, but if you decide to go that route, stop using your computer immediately, because you could overwrite the files,  and get your hard drive to such a specialist.
YNgh061uaa	never heard of this happening, if you have viruses on ur pc than i would try to get that fixed. if u cant get viruses than thats a good thing(all though unlikely)|`|FBQZ06vraa	Have you tried to fudge the word "virus" by typing, say, virue, then backspacing over the e, then the closing s?  That might throw the bugger off track.<br>  <br>  If you can get that far, get anti-virus, anti-spyware and anti-adware programs.  Many people around here recommend AVG anti-virus, and I recommend Ad-Aware SE and Spybot S&D.  All three are free.<br>  <br>  If you can't get that far, download those on your friend's machine and put them on a CD or thumb drive to move to yours.<br>  <br>  Install them, update them and run them. If they don't seem to be able to get rid of everything they report finding, try running them again, this time in Safe Mode.  Safe Mode often prevents the malware from running and protecting itself.<br>  <br>  Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.  <br>  <br>  To get into Safe Mode:<br>  <br>  1. Log out and reboot your machine.<br>  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.<br>  3. Select Safe Mode from the resulting menu.<br>  4. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.  You won't be able to see the Internet, for instance.  Log in as Administrator.  Administrator often has no password.<br>  5. When you're finished, log out and reboot back into normal mode.<br>  <br>  Update and run everything regularly. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|58becf004bd36eb415740a85b3bbb41eaa	Format and install windows.|`|b16e917da62064d674630aa7e23d9059aa	i think you have a keylogger which trigger your windows to close. try installing anti spyware like spybot.  and if you have a cd or friends with antivirus cd try borrow it and try if you can install it.  <br>  <br>  formating and reinstalling your pc will surely solve your problem but save your important files first on other storage., like cd, flash or portable hd or other hd

j5D3jIOdaa	ciao!!!allora, prima di tutto per inserire delle immagini o altro, tipo sfondi video.....devi avere dei codici....e poi, devi mettere questi codici o ne custom html oppure nel sandbox..<br>  è utilissimo il sandbox, al posto del custom html..certo, anche qui si usa in html, ma è più facile da usare...ci metti tutto quello che ti serve..basta che prelevi i codici per inserire immagini, oppure sfondi, o quello che vuoi..comunque, il sandbox sarebbe una "scatola" dove inserire i gadgets che vuoi(tipo orologio, datario, immagini, video, slides....) in formato html, cioè devi prelevare i codici e inserirli li....<br>  ecco il link che ti porta direttamente al sandbox:<br>  <a href="http://gallery.live.com/liveitemdetail.a..." rel="nofollow">http://gallery.live.com/liveitemdetail.a...</a><br>  ti chiede "aggiungi" e ti da due opzioni: live o space...tu seleziona space(sarebbe il tuo blog),poi clicca aggiungi, e ti si apre una nuova finestra..ti da l'anteprima..se a te va bene, clicca in basso su "installa".ti si apre una nuova finestra col tuo blog e il nuovo sandbox.all'inizio, è come una scatola bianca, magari prima vai su personalizza, sposta moduli, e poi metti quello che vuoi..il sanbox può essere spostato come gli altri moduli e contenere tantissime cose..<br>  comunque, ribadisco che siccome funzionano entrambi con codici, devi usare quelli...<br>  se vuoi mettere uno sfondo al sandbox, custom o intervento, ecco il codice da mettere:<br>  <TABLE style= "WIDTH: 100% " borderColor=#ffffff cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0 background="INDIRIZZO DELLO SFONDO"><br>  <TBODY><br>  <TR><br>  <TD>TESTO DELL'INTERVENTO</TD></TR></TBO...<br>  <br>  se invece lo vuoi con la barra di scorrimento, usa questo:<br>  <DIV align=center><br>  <DIV style= "WIDTH: 380px "><br>  <IMG height=450 src= "QUI VA IL LINK DELL' IMMAGINE " width=370 align=right><br>  <DIV style= "FLOAT: left; WIDTH: 380px; HEIGHT:460px; OVERFLOW:scroll "><br>  <P><FONT face= "Lucida Handwriting " size=5>QUI CI METTETE IL TESTO CHE VOLETE NELL'INTERVENTO</FONT></P><br>  </DIV><br>  </DIV><br>  </DIV><br>  <br>  poi, una volta che devi inserire un'immagine, o in un intervento o in un sandbox o in altre cose che vuoi aggiungere, devi usare questo codice:<br>  <IMG src="QUI VA IL LINK DELL'IMMAGINE"><br>  dove dice _link dell'immagine_, devi mettere il codice che prelevi dall'immagine..per prelevare il codice, clicca ull'immagine che vuoi inserire (presa da internet), clicca col pulsante destro su proprietà....ti da un indirizzo immagine, tu copia quello e lo incolli dove dice link dell'immagine..poi riprova su anteprima e vedi....ti ricordo che questo vale per inserire immagini, sfondi,..su guestbook, su interventi, su custom html, su sandbox html...<br>  <br>  fammi sapere...<br>  un abbraccio e se hai bisogno, cercami...|`|HapFN9zeaa	per quanto riguarda le immagini sul guestbook:<br>  Prima di tutto apri la pagina dove devu inserire l'immagine/(ovvero il saluto)devi cliccare su <HTML>,che si trova affianco alle emoticon.

Siccome l'immagine deve trovarsi in rete devi caricarla in un sito free hosting,il migliore è <a href="http://imageshack.us/" rel="nofollow">http://imageshack.us/</a> <br>  Per caricarla devi clikkare su sfoglia e una volta trovata l'immagine su host it,poi copia dalla pagina che si è aperta il codice posto affianco alla scritta <hotlink for website> e incollalo nell'intervento dove c'è scritto qui va il link dell'immagine.<br>  Infine riclikka su htlm e poi su salva.<br>  <br>  <br>  Per quanto riguarda lo sfondo in un intervento devi seguire questa procedura:<br>  1)accedi al tuo spaces<br>  2)apri un nuovo intervento<br>  3)clikki su htlm<br>  4)copi e incolli tra i due tag <DIV> questo codice:<br>  <TABLE style= "WIDTH: 100% " borderColor=#ffffff cellSpacing=0 cellPadding=0 border=0 background="INDIRIZZO DELLO SFONDO"><br>  <TBODY><br>  <TR><br>  <TD>TESTO DELL'INTERVENTO</TD></TR></TBO...<br>  4)vai su un sito free hosting come <a href="http://imageshack.us/" rel="nofollow">http://imageshack.us/</a> <br>  5)cariki lo sfondo cercandolo sul tuo pc e poi clikkando su host it..<br>  6)copi il codice posto accanto alla scritta hotlink for website<br>  7)incolli il codice nel tuo intervento dove c'è scritto indirizzo dello sfondo<br>  8)dove c'è scritto testo dell'intervento devi scrivere il testo del tuo intervento<br>  9)riclikki su htlm<br>  10)salvi il tuo intervento<br>  spero di essere stata kiara|`|BYNGAQ6Xaa	vai su qst sito, ci sn spiegate parekkie cs ke riguardano il blog.. <a href="http://www.mondoglitter.it/msn_spaces.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.mondoglitter.it/msn_spaces.ph...</a>|`|JCZX8MpNaa	Dipende dal tipo di servizio al quale ti appoggi.. se è permesso oppure no..<br>  <br>  Dove li vuoi mettere questi sfondi / immagini?|`|baZl2YJeaa	Per tutti quelli che si trovano in difficoltà con lo space basta andare su questi siti qui ci sono tutti i trucchi per lo space spiegati ed illustrati<br>  <a href="http://trucchi-e-consigli-msn.spaces.live.com/" rel="nofollow">http://trucchi-e-consigli-msn.spaces.liv...</a><br>  <a href="http://ptkthebestblog.spaces.live.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ptkthebestblog.spaces.live.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://teomande88.spaces.live.com/" rel="nofollow">http://teomande88.spaces.live.com/</a>

AA11563433	I also believe thats true from experience. So i keep my desktop as clean as possible. Having too many folders creates a loonger time when your computer starts up, because it has to bring up the files. Im no computer tech. but thas my theory. :)|`|Jabr9FSgaa	Hey.<br>  <br>  Well, to be honest  I dont think that folders or icons on your desktop slow you Pc performance. I know, for sure, that they affect only the start of you Pc. I mean the time it takes to load the desktop when you open your Pc. After that, there is no connection with your Pc speed. Maybe your processor is too slow or you have a low RAM. With Intel (Dual Core,Core 2 Duo,Quad Core..whatever) 2.4Gz or bigger Processor and a 3-4 Giga RAM, you wont have any problem with the icons and folders on your desktop. ^^|`|y9JLugGbaa	some belive that. i have 0ver 1,000 music files and so many downloaded games and software on it makes me think does it slow it down?  .    .NO........ it all depends on your internet like timewarner cable and others. also it depends on your cpu speed.|`|ivturGgTaa	Yes.  Anything on desktop, including the icons on the bottom of screen by the time.  YOu should be able to go to programs --->start up programs and see which programs you do not need to start when windows start.  Just delete the shorcut.|`|VNdBABJcaa	Ya .<br>  One should always sort and keep the files on the desktop in differen folders according to categories.<br>  e.g.-All games can be placed in a folder named 'games'|`|Pj2EqQbDaa	File Folders do not take any space on the computer. Those are considered labels. <br>  As a mater of fact, folders are the ones that separate what from what. Think of folders as piles of things to work with. <br>  <br>  If paranoia sets in about this, just take out what should go in another folder and rename the folder. <br>  <br>  Files and configurations are what take up space.

I'm taking it that you are implying an understanding computer? That processes and thinks? If so we get a ultra-efficient mechanic. We'll end up with a machine that wants to correct until no flaws are present.<br>  <br>  It all depends on how we program them, I suppose. What morals we distil in them. The movie I-Robot discussed the thought of having processing/thinking robots as slaves (with twists to give it entertainment value), but 3 laws were installed into every robot:<br>  <br>  1) A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. <br>  2) A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. <br>  3) A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.<br>  <br>  Aside from robots... Applications could be used for many things such as chemical engineering, space exploration, and even politics (because of their lack of emotions).<br>  <br>  We need to find ways to become less dependant on computers because of one drawback... electricity.

If it does not you will have to download them and make a driver floppy, and then press, I believe it is F2 when the installer starts and it says "Press F2 to load third party SCSI drivers".  There is no risk to your computer though if you just start the installer to see if it can see the partitions.<br>  <br>  You will need to re-install all your drivers, yes.<br>  <br>  You should not have to boot from the Vista CD, no.  If you insert it while you have XP running it should start the installer.  Just make sure you do not "upgrade" your XP installation.  If that is your only option then reboot and boot from the CD.

AGMycEC9aa	I don't want to sound pedantic, but it really depends on your definition of permanently.  As someone mentioned, you could burn CDs or DVDs if you only want to store your data 2-10 years.  After that you start to get data loss/degradation, especially on cheap media.  This is a good option for personal/home use because it is nearly dirt cheap, but it won't last all that long.  If you want to use this method, you will have to reburn your disks every 2-5 years and assume there is no data loss during transcription.<br>  <br>  Magnetic tape storage will generally last a good deal longer but is more expensive.  This method is often employed by businesses because the tapes do have a long shelf life with high data integrity, but is generally too expensive for home use.<br>  <br>  Hard drives also do a good job of long term storage, but are also quite expensive.  The good news on using hard drives for data storage is that they are generally easy to use for data backup for the home user.<br>  <br>  You could also use an online backup service, as I would assume they would keep regular backups of their data for you and keep it in good condition.<br>  <br>  Those are your best (and most common) options.  If you want anything to last 100+ years, you're better off with a stone and chisel.|`|7955c2538140bed26163e8a6ec2cedd7aa	Burn data/programs on a CD-R or DVD-R and store them for future use

aE4hyVehaa	Like the other person, I'm assuming you mean your non-volatile memory (hard drive, flash disks, etc). Your volatile memory (SRAM, DRAM, etc) erases when it is power downed.<br>  <br>  Do you have a Windows Installation disk? Reinstall Windows (whatever version) and there is an option for a clean install. Make sure to read all the option because it will allow you to format your hard drive.<br>  <br>  For secondary drives, you can right click on the drive icon (under MyComputer) and in about the center of the menu there is a "Format" option. You can't do this with a primary drive and if you are giving the computer away you're going to want to give it to the person with an OS (I'm assuming).<br>  <br>  There are also programs out there to format/write/format/write over the drive several times. This makes it impossible (nearly) for people to recover data. This is excessive unless you store proprietary information or government secrets or whatever that people will want to spend the resources and time to obtain (or you're afraid the FBI/CIA/police or whomever is investigating you).<br>  <br>  Basically, do a simple format on your drive and that will make it nearly unrecoverable for all intents and purposes.<br>  <br>  If you have a Windows ME, DOS, or some other bootup disk then you can boot into command line and type "FORMAT -u C:"<br>  <br>  That will wipe the drive clean without you having to install a new operating system and you can let the person you are giving it to worry about it. You can find MS-DOS disks on newsgroups or google for it... <br>  <br>  Another option is to remove the Hard drive from your computer case, slap it into another computer or USB enclosure and format it in the other computer just like a secondary hard drive (as described above) and then put it back into the computer.<br>  <br>  Or you can just yank out your hard drive, let the person you are giving it to worry about buying a new one and installing the OS. Keep your old one as a secondary hard drive on your new computer for backup purposes.|`|EGe0k8P6aa	What you want to do is overwrite your entire hard drive.

For example if you have downloaded a ISO you will need a CD/DVD burning app such as Alcohol.<br>  You can find lots of help on the Internet on Torrents and and other stuff if you are willing to search via google, you will be surprised what information you can find out about different appz and all the cool stuff u can do with them.|`|6260ae8a54ebd49059230ec1f77cf9e6aa	Azureus is a torrent downloader.

If yes, consult the manual on how to connect to the management interface to enable port forwarding.  If there is no router and your ADSL or cable modem is directly connected to your computer and you still can not host games, your ISP may be blocking it.  You can call them to ask, but the front-line staff at most ISPs won't even know what a "port" is, let alone if they are blocking ports (or doing NAT on their network and giving you a private address, in which case you would also not be able to host anything).

You can also choose Last Known Good Configuration, which starts your computer using the registry information that was saved at the last shutdown. <br>  Safe mode helps you diagnose problems. If a symptom does not reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and minimum device drivers as possible causes. If a newly added device or a changed driver is causing problems, you can use safe mode to remove the device or reverse the change. <br>  There are circumstances where safe mode will not be able to help you, such as when Windows system files that are required to start the system are corrupted or damaged.

dde6fe2179e353e51a4888e29baa2dd3aa	These are the five most recommended laptops:<br>  <br>  1)HP Pavilion dv5000z Turion 64. it includes: Windows XP Media Center Edition; 2.2GHz Turion 64 ML-40; 1,024MB DDR SDRAM PC2700 333MHz; ATI Mobility Radeon Xpress 200 128MB; Fujitsu MHV2120AT PL 120GB 4,200rpm. With an AMD processor it starts at a highly affordable $679. It weighs about 6.5 pounds and like its predecessors, is full of entertainment features, but also does well in productivity. Although it is not quite suited for optimum gaming experience, it does come with an integrated 802.11 a/b/g wireless with Bluetooth and an amazing 12 cell battery.<br>  <br>  2)Sony Vaio SZ. It includes: Windows XP Pro; 1.83GHz Intel Core Duo T2400; 1024MB DDR2 SDRAM PC4300 533MHz; Nvidia GeForce Go 7400 128MB; Fujitsu MHV2100HB 80GB 4,200rpm. At only 3.8 pounds, it provides a good sized screen and a usable keyboard. It includes an integrated microphone, Webcam, Intel Core Duo processor, an Nvidia graphics card, Bluetooth, and 802.11a/b/g wireless. Although it starts at $1,400 and a good unit can cost as much as $2,500, if price is no objective, this is a great model. <br>  <br>  3)Acer TravelMate 4650. It includes: Windows XP Pro; 2GHz Intel Pentium M 760; 1GB DDR2 PC4300 SDRAM 533MHz; Intel 915GM/GMS 910GML Express 128MB; Seagate ST9100822A 100GB 5,400rpm. It has amazing performance, battery life, and features for both home and office needs. Starting at $1,149, it weights 6.4 pounds with a 15 inch screen. It comes with the Acer signature curved keyboard, a hand Wi-Fi on/off button, and for the most part is quiet except for the DVD burner. For its low price it is well worth the money. But remember that Acer is probably the worst in phone support.<br>  <br>  4)Acer Aspire 9504WSMi. It includes: Windows XP Media Center; 2GHz Intel Pentium M 760; 2GB PC4300 DDR2 SDRAM 533MHz; ATI Mobility Radeon X700 256MB; Seagate Momentum 5400.2 120GB 5,400rpm. At $1,999 it is well worth the price. As another desktop replacement, it comes with a built-in TV tuner, a 17 inch display, Wi-Fi, and speakers along the front edge so while the laptop is closed, you can still hear. However, it only comes with one USB 2.0 port and weighs a whooping 8.5 pounds. However comparing to most other desktop replacements, it performs faster.<br>  <br>  5)HP Pavilion dv8000. It includes: Windows XP Professional; 2.2GHz Turion 64 ML-40; 1,024MB PC 2700 DDR SDRAM 333MHz; ATI Mobility Radeon Xpress 200 series 128MB; Seagate ST9100822A 100GB 4,200rpm, Toshiba MK1031GAS 100GB 4,200rpm. If you are looking for a laptop that will get the job done, this is the one for you. It can replace your desktop and compared to other laptops that are desktop replacements, this one comes relatively cheap at $1,600. Since it is considered to be a desktop replacement, it is a bit on the heavy side 7.3 pounds. So, if you plan on carrying your laptop with you everywhere you go, you may want to reconsider. Equipped with a huge 17 inch screen, an integrated Wi-Fi, and Altec lansing speakers, this laptop is good from in the classroom to watching movies and listening to music.<br>  <br>  *I don't believe I've heard of any problems with these notebooks.*<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK =)|`|sUAaeqlHaa	Every single laptop made this year has all of the features you mentioned. Windows Vista - all I can say about that is don't believe the hype. XP is still better in just about every category. To each their own, though. <br>  You did not mention the price you are looking for. <br>  Here is a link to a few Dell laptops - <br>  <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/products/features.aspx/hot_offers_nb?c=us&cs=04&l=en&s=bsd" rel="nofollow">http://www.dell.com/content/products/fea...</a><br>  based on what you said, I'd recommend the Vostro 1500, a relative steal at $599.|`|AGqgfjpxaa	if you just complete a few quick tasks on this site they'll send you a sony laptop, completely free of charge!!|`|haAk28ndaa	HP is not bad.  I would not pick Dell because too much problems.
zlHnILvZaa	you need to designate a file for them. when i want to have easy access i creat a new folder on the desk top and when i save files i make sure to send them to said file.
QjI6Ag8Daa	Just buy a TV tuner, you should get all of your local stations.|`|WBnVihmkaa	if you on wireless im guessing or even if u not use and download onlinelive make sure u have a visa or you wont get maxium pleasure outta it.|`|AA11799144	YOu first must have a television tuner built in to the computer, or buy a TV card to put in your computer.  Then you either connect cable, or an antenna.  Since you don't have cable, you would still need an antenna to connect to, provided you are close enough to the TV stations to pick up reception.
QLg6r1fRaa	Yes, I've done similar, but didn't host the videos, just collected the URLs and then displayed them on demand in a video player.<br>  <br>  First thing is to make sure the videos are hosted on something like youtube because they provide code to embed the video on your web page. On every youtube video to the right there is a line of HTML called "Embed". This can be copied and pasted onto a web page.<br>  <br>  In your case you want a pretty general embed HTML code.<br>  <br>  First thing is to provide a form so that people can send your server the link. This link needs to be validated as much as possible so that you don't allow invalid youtube URLs.<br>  <br>  Your server script als checks if the link already exists in your database/text file before it saves it.<br>  <br>  You have 2 choices here right now:<br>  <br>  You can ask people to only send the Embed code or just the normal URL. It is much easier for the script if it's the embed code.<br>  <br>  Now if you want users to see any of those videos,<br>  just read the embed code from the database. If they provide a normal URL then you'll have to translate this into embed code (not difficult).<br>  <br>  Any more info, please make an addition to your question, I will check.|`|rdHtlonNaa	copy the embed code from youtube it should always work when you are making a website|`|OOHSCZ5Aaa	If you wanted to have your own program running off of your server then I would suggest something like 'Wimpy'<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wimpyplayer.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.wimpyplayer.com/index.html</a><br>  <br>  If you wanted to just place videos from other websites onto yours - then simply go to 'YouTube' [or whichever video site you want to copy it from] and copy the 'Embed URL' and paste it onto your website.|`|hXYIJcBwaa	try photobucket.
AtPlzpi5aa	Double click the image to get in the edit window.<br>  <br>  Choose the Effects tab on the left side.<br>  <br>  Choose Focal B&W<br>  <br>  Play with the sliders and in the image drag the + cursor over the area you want to remain color. Takes some fiddling but may do the trick for you.

You can hide the picture comments for each picture by putting this in each picture caption:<br>  <br>  <style> .cols{display:none}td {color:white} </style>|`|AA12086296	If you mean that you don't want people to leave you comments with pictures in them, go to Account Settings --> Profile Settings and check the box that says "Disable HTML Profile Comments" or "Disable HTML in Picture Comments"<br>  <br>  There's no way to prevent people from commenting on your photos only - other than setting them to private so that no one can see them.|`|WhEFrqdCaa	you delete the pic comment!|`|42490cf33b66bf474daf61ce361846bfaa	MAKE UR PIX PRIVATE SO THAT NO ONE CAN SEE DEM EXCEPT YOU!!!
eYcZl50saa	It doesn't matter, and yes the disk space will return. But if it doesn't you can try running disk cleanup and click on the option that says all files on this computer. Then select c: drive. Then go to the advanced tab and click on delete backups and shadow copies. That should free up quite a bit.|`|r8CVFUTIaa	if it's a downloaded movie, you will get all the disk space back, it's not like installing a program wherein hidden files are installed in your PC
QlPBzMSlaa	I think you must be the only person still with Windows 2000
0185GdB7aa	if your at home then try hitting F8 lots of times on start up then choose boot in safe mode and your login user is administrator (or how ever you spell it) then create a new acount say your nick name and give it admin privelages then you can do whatever you want wen you want<br>  <br>  but sadly though there isnt much you can do if its at school|`|JNTZLwuPaa	sorry to say but you cant unless admin gives you the right
e7Dg7bbsaa	I would try the free OpenOffice.org software suite. Visit <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.openoffice.org/</a> and click on the green "get OpenOffice.org" button. It's a free replacement to the Microsoft Office suite and is quite powerful and very similar to MS Office.|`|h4YPo90Maa	OpenOffice Writer (free) is a clone of Microsoft Word. OpenOffice is free and compatible with most Microsoft Office applications. <br>  <br>  OpenOffice<br>  <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.openoffice.org/</a><br>  <br>  Can import from MS application and export to MS application unless noted:<br>  Base = Microsoft Access<br>  Calc = Microsoft Excel<br>  Draw = Similar to  Microsoft Publisher but not directly compatible<br>  Math = Create equations<br>  Impress = Microsoft PowerPoint<br>  Writer = Microsoft Word <br>  No equivalent = Microsoft Office Office Outlook|`|AA11299279	I think you pretty much have to register somewhere somehow unless you have your own website.  Google has that new office software but you have to have a free accont with them.
AA12097508	Yep, one of the best ones out there, but why will u use a format that uses most of your disk space, try using wma 192kbps and u will notice that there's hardly any quality loss..........|`|cb1c8e5fcd8492bc3787fd1b614481ecaa	I have never had a problem. You can also rip into MP3 if you wish.
4bce0669a3c79b9571d706a9876ad92eaa	Look into AVG. I'm currently using it in 5 computers and have used it for about 2 years. Its free also- free.grisoft.com|`|AA10756938	Yahoo!'s online protection is good enough, but you can't leave your own comp unprotected. It's highly recommended (if not vital) to have one monitoring  your system.<br>  <br>  Remember AV software must to be upgraded regularly.<br>  <br>  Even if your AV says certain downloaded file is safe but you doubt of it, don't trust blindly. The computer is a machine and you are human. Some viruses or troy horse can be modified enough to don't fit the AV database and be declared as safe.|`|AMWpucQVaa	i think it's important to have at least 2 virus protections in ur computer. that way if one doesnt find something wrong, the other one will HOPEFULLY find the problem. i hope that made sense. LOL. <br>  <br>  hope i helped! :)
MHZ1oHq0aa	its a program used to "share" files with people all over the world music pictures everything, you can download songs for free and its legal because it is considered sharing something like if a friend let you borrow a cd and you rip it you didnt pay for the cd but you have the music for free right??|`|UtZ6STclaa	Person to Person<br>  <br>  Used when transferring software, programs, etc from one person's computer to another.|`|AA10756938	P2P comes from "peer to peer"<br>  <br>  Using this kind of networks, you connect to a server. This server manages its users and when it find a match (client A has file.exe and client B requests file.exe), it allows the conection between both of them, so you download or upload to another person.<br>  <br>  The server is used to allow this conections and manage the requests between users
lsU1NO2kaa	To be honest, its more than these games require so these are really good specs. <br>  What did u mean when u mentioned no monitor because no matter how good the specs are, they wont be of any use without the monitor.|`|a2y9g4bpaa	Yh shud be fine =)|`|mJLyQwUjaa	gd yea

TE65gLcBaa	I've always been pretty impressed with "skimming". The crims attach a fake cover to the front of the ATM, or a very thin device that sits inside the slot itself, and it records the magnetic strip of cards as they're being inserted. To the side of the ATM they attach a plastic box with flyers from the bank, so it all looks legit, but hidden in the base is a very tiny camera filming the keypad as people enter their PINs. They set this up on a Friday evening and leave it running all weekend, by the time bank staff discover it on Monday they've already managed to get thousands of cards and matching PINs and drained the accounts.|`|rH3ylNuYaa	this is internet security and you are probably trying to <br>  scam an atm right?

Vista will run autoplay and give you option to use ready boost, which allows Windows Vista to service random disk reads with performance that is typically 80-100 times faster than random reads from traditional hard drives. Im preety sure you wont need to use readyboost, but there it is just in case.

7vh5fOeRaa	Important question...<br>  <br>  When your system blue screens, do you see the exact same message as the one you included in your question?  Specifically, is the file mentioned that is causing the crash 'aries.sys'?<br>  <br>  If it IS aries.sys, then you are infected with the infamous Sony Rootkit, a sneaky little program written by Sony records to hide a form of Digital Rights Management on unsuspecting user's computers.  Fortunately, there was some major fall-out from Sony's questionable behavior, and there are ways to remove the program from your system.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic34904.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t...</a><br>  <br>  If it is NOT 'aries.sys' that is causing the problem, then I would look to a second antivirus software.  What is most likely happening is that you currently have an infection on your computer, and as you run the antivirus program, the virus "crashes" the computer to avoid detection and removal.  You may have more luck with a different anti-virus application.<br>  <br>  One other thing to consider:  you say you recenlty installed the free virus scanner.  Did you already HAVE a virus scanner, even one that may have been included with the PC when you bought it, running?  You can't run two antivirus programs on a PC at the same time without running into some unusual behavior.  OR... how trustworthy is the "free" antivirus scanner?  Is it possible you downloaded one that is more trick than treat, and have infected your PC with malware accidentally?  Use a Google Search and look up the name of the program you just installed.  Is it good?  Reliable?  Or does it have a reputation as something a bit shady?<br>  <br>  You have a bit of work ahead of you... but you should be able to get things cleaned up.|`|EmgiGg17aa	It shouldn't take an hour.

f2da73f26820e41a00db0edf3483a591aa	If you used JS for what you want, people could look in the source and find what they need to respond with. There are pseudo encryptions like to hex/to unicode, and a few other things. But they are all very easy to decrypt. An amusing one would be to make it encrypt what they say through something like KARD (a custom encryption I wrote) and then make it check the encrypted string, if they aren't the same, then they will be denied. But, for this sort of thing, php would really be best.

However, some programs that run on Windows do allow you to protect individual files by using a password. For more information, check the Help for the program you are using.<br>  <br>  There are other ways to protect your files and folders in Windows. You can encrypt your files, manually specify who can access the folders or files, or hide them. Choose your method based on how secure the folders or files need to be. Encrypting is the most secure, while hiding the folders is the least secure.|`|NcXaMI95aa	A good software to protect your files and folders with a password - Folder Castle.

FBQZ06vraa	That sounds like adware.  I suggest you download Ad-Aware 2008 and Spybot S&D (they’re free), install them, update them and run them. If any of the above (or any anti-malware, for that matter) doesn’t seem to be able to run properly or get rid of everything it reports finding, try running it again in Safe Mode. <br>  <br>  Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.  <br>  <br>  To get into Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking:<br>  <br>  1. Log out and reboot your machine.<br>  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.<br>  3. Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu.<br>  4. When the login screen comes up, log in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password.<br>  5. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.  <br>  6. When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.<br>  <br>  Note that even if the anti-malware programs get rid of the malware, they may not be able to reverse the effects.  Search the Web for possible fixes.<br>  <br>  Update and run everything regularly, not just when you think you already have malware.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  |`|lObEjUh1aa	yeah this sounds like it's gotta be a virus.  running "hijack this" can help you locate the offending process, though you may need assistance from an experienced pc tech to identify which item(s) in the "hijack this" output are legitimate and which are viral.|`|RlKr7HRzaa	Run a virus and spyware scan. And if you have any toolbars in your web browser, delete them. Usually when this happens, a virus or a toolbar is looking for stuff you search for, and than redirects it to it's "sponsor" search engine, and in turn, whoever made the virus/toolbar gets paid for generating traffic.
VhHdTJnEaa	when I see things like "i installed the internet yesterday", it really makes me pause and wonder if I should even continue on - attempting to answer the question, just because that's such a ridiculous statement to start out with, but, here it goes....<br>  <br>  Here's what it should look like.<br>  From your cable modem, you should have a network cable (aka ethernet cable) from your cable modem (making an assumption here that you have internet service through your cable company?) and the other end plugged into the WAN port of your router. <br>  <br>  Now in order to get a connection to your computer, you will either connect with another network cable between the router and your computer, or if your computer and your router are wireless, you should be able to make a wireless connection to the router.  <br>  <br>  So here's where I'm confused.  Are you saying that you are making a good connection to the internet through the router? or are you saying that the only way you can get an internet connection is to go strait from your cable modem to the computer?<br>  <br>  *boggles*|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Make sure that the "wireless" or "wlan" light on the router is on.  If it's not, connect the cable, use your browser to connect to the router and turn on wireless.  (What address you connect to and where you turn on wireless depends on the router.  The make and model would help us to help you.)<br>  <br>  Make sure that the wireless connection on the computer is enabled.<br>  <br>  Also, tell us exactly what you meant by "installed the internet".  There's nothing you need to install on the computer to connect it to the router - you either plug in an ethernet cable between them or you enable wireless on both of them - that's it.  (The router just gets connected and powered, it doesn't get "installed".  If you installed software that came with the router, uninstall it.)|`|BmfNoEgXaa	You should not have your wireless on and the ethernet cable plugged in at the same time.  If you are using your wireless router, the ethernet cable should be unplugged.  First try reseting your wireless router.  You can unplug it, leave it unplugged for a minute or two, and then plug it back in and see if it connects then.  There might also be a switch on your computer to turn on your wireless card.  You may also need to manually connect to the wireless network.  At the bottom of your screen next to the time there should be a small icon of a computer.  If you double click it, it should open a window that can help you connect.  Hope this helps!|`|vyqciXGqaa	The router must still be connected to your cable source in order to establish the connection, and the wireless router syncs with the wireless adapter on your pc/laptop to allow access to the internet.  broad answer because I do not know what you have, but basically the router needs a connection source.|`|lObEjUh1aa	It might help if we understood a little bit more about your connection.<br>  <br>  Who is your ISP?  What type of connection do you subscribe to (cable, DSL, etc.)?<br>  <br>  What is your operating environment (Windows XP, Vista, Mac, other)?<br>  <br>  How is your connection laid out (walk through the connection devices one at a time, starting at your PC and working your way up).  example:<br>  <br>  Windows XP PC  ---->  Linksys 4 port switch  ---->  Terayon cable modem  ---->  Comcast ISP<br>  <br>  with this type of information, we might be better able to provide more helpful answers.  =]|`|AA12023243	go get a ethernet cable. here not that expensive and u can get them at walgreens or any electronics store.|`|GaPSu96xaa	Try this:<br>  <br>  Go to start>Control Panel>Wireless Connections>Left click the wireless connection and click enable.

It's worth it for DirectX10 alone but it also has tons of nice features.  Anyone telling you to get a Mac is an idiot as Mac is a terrible platform for gaming.

They will tell you if and when it was cashed and by whom<br>  <br>  I'm  afraid eBay is not very helpful and paypal can be a big scam as they kept my funds and if you google you'll see that they do rip off a lot of people!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Unfortunately you have to wait a whole 60 days to be able to file a claim for a refund. You'll then bring your stub to the PO and pay a fee and ask for a form #6401. The good thing you did is buy a postal m.o. Money Gram rips you off a lot of money when filing a claim.<br>  <br>  It sounds like the seller is not being honest as they should have told you beforehand what their address was. The not being able to change it is a charade! It's very easy to change.<br>  <br>  Never get one of those "visa" cards you can buy at drugstores: most of them are a scam and I also had a bad surprise after spending $100 for a card which was not accepted anywhere, it was declined and the store would not take it back. Google again and you will see the scams (google card name + fraud)<br>  <br>  Also Google the seller's id name + fraud or scam or ripoff and see if he's done the same to others. Feedback doesn't count: many buyers used to leave positive feedback for fear of retaliation up until they no longer allow sellers to leave negative feedback. (Sometimes  you can read negative feedback along with the green plus sign!)<br>  <br>  Good luck but don't count on eBay to help you: they are based in India (outsource) and all they do is send you a form letter which sounds personal but it's not. It's like "so if I understand blabla" they reiterate what you just wrote and add "I'm sorry about this..." but they give you the run around. In other words eBay leaves you and the seller to deal with it. Once I phoned eBay and was told this. You're on your own, even with PayPal!  In the end I contacted the seller and threatened her and that did the trick. (she lived not far from me and I had her home address, emails and phones so she knew I could make it very unpleasant, she figured best to give me my money back; she figure right!)<br>  <br>  Good luck to you sweetie, be tough, send a threatening email if all else fails, say that your friend who lives in the area will stop by to pick up your money in cash, that should do the trick!|`|f0503b7c948aabdd21ad5f5ddaca7e86aa	Since they flat out told you that ebay had the wrong address on file, this seller is responsible for this.  They should have said something like "DO NOT USE THE ADDRESS THAT WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY SENT TO YOU AFTER YOU WIN THIS AUCTION...WE WILL SEND THE CORRECT ADDRESS AS WE HAVE BEEN HAVING PROBLEMS GETTING OURS CHANGED".  I mean, did they at least send you an email saying that after the auction was over?  I would contact ebay and tell them everything that has happened.  I would call the people you have gotten the money order with and have them track it to see if it has been cashed in yet.  If it hasn't, I would cancel it...even though it will cost you...I don't know how much though.  In the meantime, if you go to any store you can get a visa card that you can load with money on it, which you can use to purchase things online.  But you do need to tell ebay about this because if these people are scamming people then ebay needs to know about it.|`|5cWCn9HLaa	Cash money order is a bad idea. Open a bank account, all you need is an address and a few dollars, at a credit union you can open an account for 5$. I would put the money and the 5$ into the account and get a cashier's check. Those are much safer plus covered by the bank's hands first. <br>  <br>  I think you might be out of luck. BUT contact Ebay's legal crew first if the payment isn't traceable OR has be posted. |`|0GtonJONaa	if it was a cash money order -- sorry looks like your out of luck unless you get ebay to visit the address you posted it too and start asking questions, ebay seller owns house sounds a bit fishy. Make enquiries at ebay for sure if the are scammers they need to be booted off ebay.<br>   Good Luck in this day and age  $100 is a lot of money|`|XqfH76PMaa	You can file a claim with Ebay to let them know that you have not received the item and see what becomes of it.  It is up to the seller to take care of changing that adress (I know because I sell on Ebay) and to let the buyer know immediatly if there is a different address to mail the payment to.  This is their fault, not yours.  I am including a link for you to go through to file a case against the seller.  I would also advise you to contact Ebay and let them know what the seller has done.  This is very unfair to you.  There is still a chance that you will get the money back.  <br>  <br>  Another thing, contact the place you got your money order through and tell them the situation (that the money order is supposed to be lost) and see if they can help you with finding out if it has been cashed or if you can recover your money.<br>  <br>  I really hope this works out for you.  It is people like this that give honest sellers a bad name.<br>  <br>

GQ6K85LPaa	 <br>  A typewriter with the QWERTY layoutThe QWERTY keyboard layout was devised and created in the early 1870s by Christopher Sholes, a newspaper editor and printer who lived in Milwaukee.<br>  <br>  With the assistance of his friends Carlos Glidden and Samuel W. Soule he built an early writing machine for which a patent application was filed in October 1867.[3] His "Type Writer" had its printing point located beneath the paper carriage, and so was invisible to the operator. Consequently, the tendency of the typebars to clash and jam if struck in rapid succession was a particularly serious problem, in that the mishap would only be discovered when the typist raised the carriage to inspect what had been typed.[4]<br>  <br>  Sholes struggled for the next six years to perfect his invention, making many trial-and-error rearrangements of the original machine's alphabetical key arrangement in an effort to reduce the frequency of typebar clashes. Eventually he arrived at a four-row, upper case keyboard approaching the modern QWERTY standard. In 1873 Sholes' backer, James Densmore, succeeded in selling manufacturing rights for the Sholes-Glidden "Type Writer" with E. Remington and Sons and within the following few months the keyboard layout was finalised by Remington's mechanics. Their adjustments included placing the "R" key in the place previously allotted to the period mark, thus enabling salesmen to impress customers by pecking out the brand name "TYPE WRITER" from one keyboard row. Vestiges of the original alphabetical layout remained in the "home row" sequence FGHJKL.[4]<br>  <br>  in summary it was to stop the mechanical arms on a typewriter crashing together when a typist worked at speed.<br>  <br>  |`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	It is partially because it is a layout that allows the most used letters to be readily accessible, but that is not the only reason.<br>  <br>  Initially, they had to do it this way because of the way that old typewriters used to work, with little hammers hitting an inked ribbon to type.<br>  <br>  This required that certain letters be in certain places to reduce the amount of times that the hammers and arms got tangled up.<br>  <br>  |`|oojO4WAraa	Because when typewriters they were really slow, manual typewriters.  The keys placed in a fashion to slow the typists down so the keys didn't bunch up as they typed.|`|g62ATenqaa	It was originally created that way to slow down typing on the manual keyboards when keys jammed if you picked up any speed. In effect though with today's modern keyboards, it speeds up typing because the most used keys, a e r t s are all placed to the left and if you are a touch typist it is easy to reach speeds of up to 200wpm with accuracy.  However, you can get alphabetical keyboards but I'm willing to bet it would slow up your typing. I do use alphabetical keyboards when teaching infants, but then it is a whole re-learning process when transferring to conventional. You can also get coloured keyboards for people with dyslexia where vowels, consonants, figures etc are in different colours, unbreakable keyboars, very small keyboards, the list is endless.|`|1cYPOJkqaa	It used to be in alphabetical order but people kept typing so fast they jammed. This was back when there was type writers so they jammed really easily. It was decided to jumble up the letters to slow people down. And the QWERTY keyboard was born.<br>  <br>  Edit: What I am saying that's getting thumbed down?|`|1b99e2172d8e187dc1c01f1f61578326aa	First type-writers were a-b-c-d-e but typists were too quick for the ribbon and mechanical arms of the typewriter mechanism, so lots of jams occurred.  So QWERTY was invented to make it harder to find the letters and slow them down.   I can't think it will have worked for long, as practice made them faster again.|`|ye1tS9a2aa	because its a load ballocks|`|kGT8sjURaa	it is easier to type with this way  if they were in alphabetical order your hands would be clumped together for alot of the words.  Each letter is placed in a certain part of the keyboard for a reason.|`|FIboB15Jaa	QWERTY was designed as a way to prevent 'crossover' with the spacebar. It was the easiest, and least typo-littered keyboard. It was worked out, with many, many prototypes, and statistical analysis.|`|LFQA94Msaa	It goes back to earlier typewriters.   They needed to slow down the user to keep the keys from jamming. |`|Te7OkH2faa	It is laid out in a manner that makes it easier to type the most common used letters in everyday english |`|E592Ui9zaa	its probs jus about the most used letters, placed wherever...|`|qz1OapGaaa	Cos the letters you normally use in words are close together|`|S42yzY99aa	I think they probably figured the human brain could process this way better... or something.|`|Md16KeXmaa	I'm just going on a wild guess here but I guess the keyboard is ergonomically and pyschologically designed. Basically, lots of research has been put into how people remember the letter's positions on a keyboard, and then lain out in an ergonomic fashion to help with our ease of access to typing.<br>  <br>  Ergonomics being the study of how products are best suited to certain body types. Like a pen shaped to fit a child's hand for example.<br>  <br>  Also I think it has something to do with a human's sensory nerves... again I'm going by a wild guess, but the human brain has been known to recognise certain letters before others while it is in it's younger stages e.g. Q (for it's unusual state and usage)|`|eL4XZUovaa	Wiki says ...the tendency of the typebars to clash and jam if struck in rapid succession was a particularly serious problem ...

He invented the qwerty because, on 'oldskool' typewriters the letters were attached to levers..... NOW.....if you had the letters on a keyboard in alphabetcal order, the likelihood of the typewriter jammin when typing fast was Alot greater. in modern days  that will ever happen because there is nothing manual, but the qwerty keyboard stayed in place because everyone got used to it! ha! theres a new keyboard which some bloke from poland invented... its called the 'dovrak' keyboard its suppose to put all the common used letter together for 'easy' typing and less muscle strain. <br>  thanks for the question that i didnt even know the answer to! lol|`|xd1PkaESaa	It might be grouped according to how often the keys are needed, what letters they are needed with and how easy they are to reach.<br>  e.g. type the word "ready" for example and all the letters are near each other. or the word "letter"|`|BpWnHy9jaa	It's to do with common placing of letters within words... for example "er" are close together because you will often have "er" together in a word!

This doesnot seem good to me. You know why : read this then : My computer's OS has recently gone for a toss and I am finding it difficult to get them all back up again. I need to get all my data backed up and then need to format it. Now read this : The Nero software too is not working on my computer. So I cant get the data backed up on CDs as well. Infact no other programs or applications are working. So I will have to shell out a good 100$ to buy an external HD to back it all up. And you want to crash your computer ? You dont know the pain and suffering I am going through right now. So never be in such an attitude again to crash down your computer.|`|9f178b78d1df3d5b00c072925dbeddc0aa	remove the side  cover of ur cpu  unplug the rams and dip it in water and hook the ram again and turn it on.|`|fY2ECKfIaa	dont be a brat, use what you have.

YJJMt2Bpaa	Usually when a program becomes non-responsive, your pc is telling you that something is wrong. It can be with that program, or other hardware in your pc. No, you cant coax the app to keep running either. Try uninstalling the program, and reinstalling, if it is the only program that freezes, if not, try checking your memory, hard drive etc, there are tools like memcheck, and scandisk for memory and hard drive.|`|b752fd6326ba18cebce3a336a9e16a09aa	2 make a long story short<br>  just reboot ur computer 2c wut it <br>  will do!!!|`|rLapSCUgaa	Wait.  Of course, that is a terrible answer, but there really arn't more options once code starts going crazy.  <br>  <br>  I would recommend taking a look at your event log to try to find out why the programs are crashing and fix that.<br>  <br>  The event log is located at control panel->administrative tools->event viewer->error events.  It will show you a list of all the errors that the computer has logged.  You can try to find errors related to whatever programs you have that are crashing and then post the error information www.techsupportguy.org for more help; they have an m$ mvp over there who has been able to help me with any issues I have.
AA10693945	I think you are looking for a solid state drive.<br>  <br>  Here is an example from samsung<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/products/flash/ssd/2008/home/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.samsung.com/global/business/s...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|lObEjUh1aa	yes these are solid state disks ... personally I don't think they're your best bet for a fast disk subsystem.  early performance evaluations seem to indicate the technology has some maturing to do before it reaches its performance potential.  your best bet for a fast subsystem is still to RAID multiple fast hard disks (such as WD Raptors or 15k RPM SCSI or SAS disks).  each disk you add to the RAID increases the performance of the system.  If you use RAID 0, be sure to keep good backups as the probability of data loss scales with the number of disks in the RAID.<br>  <br>  I recommend reading up on RAID (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID)</a> and reading some user reviews of SSDs (<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory.aspx?SubCategory=636&name=Solid-State-Disks)" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Store/SubCategory....</a> before making any purchasing decisions.
