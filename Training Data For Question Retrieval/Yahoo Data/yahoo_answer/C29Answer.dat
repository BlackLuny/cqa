Im8G3mjRaa	Well, I just graduated from Fort Benning yesterday. It was really tough and the longest 16 weeks of my life. In the end I am very proud I did it and I already miss it. My Drill Sergeants were very inspirational to me. It feels so different after 4 months of Infantry OSUT to be out in the civilian world again. My Drill Sergeant putting that blue cord on my shoulder is the proudest day of my life. If you're thinking about joining, do it.|`|fDPf66pYaa	Depends quite a bit on your MOS.  I was a combat engineer.  I think a combat arms MOS tends to be a little tougher physically and an MOS like medic or intelligence would tend to be tougher mentally.  I thought Basic Training was challenging but not too hard for the average person to accomplish.  My best advice would be to try to get in the best shape you can, and keep you mouth shut while you are going through.  Watch what you voulanteer for.|`|wRsSodTAaa	My husband was in the Army National Guard and said that Basic was mentally and physically challenging but rewarding.|`|BsUcTqfWaa	Hard, Canada has a much harder basic than any American Basic. But being fully Bilingual made it much easier.|`|3tnVVFjHaa	i enlisted in the air force when i was 18.i enlisted to eat.it was 1948 and jobs were tough to get.i gained 25 pounds in 3 months.and till today.it was the best thing i ever did.i went from a boy to a man.i recommend it for every one.although i hear today they are very leinent.and respect is at an all time low.i can only tell you how it was then.|`|BIQrsl4paa	I went through Army basic training Aug-Oct, 1969 and found it to be one of the most difficult things I have ever done. Of course, being told every 5 minutes that you're going to Vietnam and going to die there didn't make it any easier, but sure didn't diminish the pride I felt when I marched in my graduation parade.<br>  Basic, is what you make of it. If you expect it to be the worst experience of your life, you're right, it is. However, if you expect it to be tough, but also a learning, growing experience, again you're right.<br>  Don't take any preconceived notions with you, but do expect it to NOT be a sunday walk in the park, as they are trying to teach you how to survive should you ever find yourself in a combat situation.

04a4824f734643fd0c6adefd032a1af8aa	lethal injection is the death penalty|`|z88IMXNFaa	Insanity defenses rarely work.  Juries decide whether a defendant gets the death penalty based on instructions from the judge.|`|1KGXts5Daa	The United States is among the minority of countries in the world that still uses capital punishment (the "death sentence") as a potential form of punishment.<br>  <br>  It is not necessary to kill a law enforcement officer in order for a defendant to be sentenced to execution, although that particular offense certainly qualifies in most instances.<br>  <br>  Each state enforces capital punishment differently and use different means in order to execute a condemned prisoner.<br>  <br>  No state may use any means which meets the definition of "cruel and unusual" (such as hanging or decapitation/guillotine).<br>  <br>  In California, "The punishment of death shall be inflicted by ... an intravenous injection of a substance or substances in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause death…"  (aka: lethal injection)<br>  <br>  In California, conviction of any of the following offenses may be cause for the guilty person to receive capital punishment:<br>  <br>      * treason, <br>      * perjury, causing execution of an innocent person<br>      * first-degree murder with "enhancements", including:<br>            - the victim was an on-duty peace officer; federal law enforcement officer or agent; or firefighter<br>            - the victim was a prosecutor or assistant prosecutor; judge or former judge; elected or appointed official; juror; and the murder was in retaliation for the victim's official duties<br>            - (other "enhancements" not listed in the interest of brevity) available at: <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Capital-punishment-in-California" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia...</a>|`|VHrOe6kHaa	I believe it would depend upon the jurisdiction of where the act was committed.  If the state has the death penalty then it depends upon if the prosecuting attorney will seek the death penalty.  In most cases I'm sure they would.  If sentenced to death, the guilty gets choice of lethal injection or any other method of execution the state has.
r8qbCKgfaa	basically we need to stop giving handouts to everyone (this will kill liberalism), and stop banging the bible around while claiming no official religion (killing neo-conservatism).<br>  <br>  I don't understand either extreme really.

I vote we split the country into three pieces, and give N.Dakota and Montana to Neo-cons, new-mexico and arizona to liberals, and the rest of us sane people can chill in the middle.<br>  <br>  that way, neo-cons can bible tote and discriminate, as there are hardly any minorities up there, and liberals can promote free trade and legalize illegal immigrants from mexico.|`|HReBWI6qaa	The Republicans have lost their way and so now both major parties are creating more and more government, which is a big problem.

Kinda like the Democrats now.|`|XuLVfj1caa	Because they trusted their party leader, George Bush.  This was their opportunity to show the country that their system of government was the best way to go.  They reduced taxes, they cut spending on social programs and increased defense and military spending.  They engaged in two wars unexpectedly.  They deregulated investment banks.  All of it, except the wars, designed to benefit the country's financial system.<br>  <br>  Someone mentioned the do nothing democratic congress screwed the pooch.  But you realize they were do nothing because they didn't have the votes to get any legislation past the republicans, who voted down all democratic proposals.  Also, I find it interesting that the GOP complained about fannie and freddie giving out loans to middle class and lower middle class people, but had no worries about deregulating the wall street banks to become vast financially irresponsible institutions.|`|BIQrsl4paa	You do realize don't you, that had you asked this question about the Democrat party and Clinton, you would have gotten virtually the same spread of answers, albeit from the opposite parties.<br>  However, in an attempt to give a reasonable answer, I must point out that the GOP, when it had control of both houses, was about the most gutless of entities. Even Rush pointed out the fact that the Dems, although in the minority, were being allowed to run roughshod over the Republicans and were, for all intents and purposes, running Congress.<br>  I'm a 60 year old Republican, but I am also capable of admitting the truth, regardless of how much it hurts.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	For the same reason the Democrats provided zero oversight.  And when they took control of Congress, their approval ratings sunk lower than those of Bush himself because of their do-nothing approach.|`|G6yyceAxaa	because they normally negotiated out of a position of fear.  when bush wanted to pass the giant budget and democrats and republicans started bucking him, he started with the "they don't want to support the troops"<br>  <br>  He got money for homeland security under the guise that he was "stopping another attack".<br>  <br>  he was the master of bill through before anybody noticed.  I don't know if anybody recalls soon after 9/11 he asked for 5 billion in emergency funds for security, nobody knows what happen to that money. (the troops didn't deploy for another year, and then he only sent troops to Afghanistan, so it wasn't for deployment)<br>  <br>  double standards|`|L7wJwbjDaa	It was the GOP who begged for a regulator to oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The plans that Obama has enacted will not do anything until at least March. <br>  <br>  You know how the Republicans like to blame Clinton for the recession in 2001 and 2002 even after Bush had already been in office for over a year and still hadn't done anything about it?

Most larger towns hire first and send you to an academy so you can take the TCLOSE test.<br>  So, likely in your case you need to find an academy to go to. Check with your local community college. it of course depends on where you live. Around populated areas like Austin Dallas and Houston there are lots of academies, usually run by a local community college district. In west Texas your going to have to look around.<br>  After you pass out of the academy you are allowed to take the TCLOSE. you pass and you can be commissioned by a local department.<br>  I suggest you check with any that are hiring that you would qualify for and see if they will sponsor you to an academy.

We are looking at legalizing all illegal immigrants, and socializing the country even more than it already is. the housing bill that just passed is so socialist it makes me sick, and even worse, i am going to need to buy a house within the next 2 years.<br>  <br>  America is so full of ignorant people who believe whatever the news says, they are creating their own destruction.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I do not support Obama, as I already have to work until I'm 68 until I can retire, and that will probably increase as he's just outspent Bush in 30 days.|`|FOf9Y9dqaa	Of course we need to support our President.

You're obviously much more mature than your age.<br>  <br>  The problem though is that everyone keeps looking at things in "black-and-white" and it's not just race.

The issue is where to meet in the middle, because going to one side (be it Republican or Democrat) just isn't doing it.|`|JMEIP6G5aa	I do agree with you but I really just can't justify supporting a leader that clearly had his own agendas in mind before the safety of Americans.|`|L7wJwbjDaa	It's the Democrat Party who is stuck permanently on race and can't move beyond it.  Just last week we celebrated the 200th birthday of Abraham Lincoln -- the first Republican -- and the 100th anniversary of the founding of the NAACP which was founded by the Republican Party.  The Democrats have a very shady and nasty past when it comes to issues to race.  I'd encourage you to look into more if you can handle the truth of what the Democrat Party has done to the black population.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I agree we should show Obama more support.

Anyway, I took them shopping and sightseeing around our town here in Ohio. His mother was astonished (shocked, really) because everything she picked up was stamped with a Made In...sign. Most of it was China. Granted, we didnt' go grocery shopping, but she was still floored that everything she did see was Made In China. Or Japan. Or India. She was disappointed that she didn't get to buy anything Made In America. Sad, isn't it? Especially because she brought us a whole suit case full of stuff Made In Brazil.|`|AA11965360	The average American company tries to stay in the highest profit margin possible. America was based on capitalism and a government which would watch over businesses to provide a safe country for all of the people. President Obama was correct when he said change needs to come to America. We need to be able to prevent all scam artists from taking people's retirement funds and promising them a high return on their investments, then depositing their money in an off-shore account where it cannot be gotten by the American government. The FDA and food inspectors are a joke. To be honest, it is not entirely the departments fault. They are understaffed and over-whelmed, much like all Americans who have jobs. A bigger concern south of the border is the travel warnings. There are warnings to American people to not travel to many parts of the middle east, but Mexico has a civil war between the government loyalists and the corrupt people of the drug cartel. Kidnappings and public assassinations are every day occurrences. The further south you go, the worse it gets. One South American leader has basically created his own Zimbabwe, using democracy to destroy democracy. Now the food from other sources are wonderful, such as Chile. Some of the best fresh vegs and fruit. I hope this first month has been a taste of all the changes Obama will make. There are so many, he will probably need two terms to see America on it's feet again.

PI8VfiY1aa	Okay. There are multiple ways to answer this question. <br>  <br>  First of all, when you say Muslim women are "covering up" you're referring to an article of clothing called the hijab, or their head covering. You should know that this piece of clothing doesn't originate with the Islamic faith, but actually came from early Christians. It's in the bible. (1 Corinthians, chapter 11 verses 5-7). This is why the mother Mary is almost always depicted as wearing a hijab. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Veil.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/Veil....</a><br>  <br>  mother mary pics<br>  <a href="http://www.christcenteredmall.com/stores/art/sallman/Mary-mother-of-Jesus-zoom.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.christcenteredmall.com/stores...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/civil-religion/files/2008/04/virgin_mary1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.stltoday.com/blogzone/civil-r...</a><br>  <a href="http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i199/bentliberal/Ali%20Hamed/Blessed_Virgin_Mary.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i72.photobucket.com/albums/i199/b...</a><br>  <br>  Now- to logically address your argument. Who are you quoting? Because I'm a liberal and I've never called you a fanatic. <br>  <br>  On the contrary, I can't even visit Yahoo Answers without someone on the political right saying "all Muslims are terrorists." (aka fanatics) <br>  <br>  Therefore I could easily flip this question on it's head. Observe. <br>  <br>  "Why do conservatives call all Muslims terrorists?

If he selected bimonthly, then you will get half on the first of the month, then the second half on around the 15th.<br>  <br>  Pay also works like civilian pay. You earn it then you get it paid to you. So for example, February's pay would be paid on 1 March, unless he opted for the bimonthly pay then, half of February's would be paid in the middle of the month. Next half would be March 1.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	Payday is on the first.

The $800 billion package funds highway projects, medicaid, and tax cuts, along with a $500 refund check. <br>  <br>  Many presidents have done this before, but this is the biggest one so far. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with international economies, I'm American.|`|TS5z0SPwaa	A well planed stimulus package will help the nation as a whole. It is not only my belief but the belief of others that this stimulus package will do more harm than good. The New Deal prolonged the depression. WW2 brought the U.S. out of it. If it was so important why was more time not allowed to go over the package before it was voted on.|`|AA11485682	Basically, it means that the government is preparing to "stimulate" the economy by spending money.

yeu09pfOaa	right|`|tK5swgX1aa	right, the conservatives disapprove|`|CSbSQfYHaa	It is the political right in the US that is passionate about opposing gay marriage. However, the Democrats are not in any hurry to support it. It is not high on their agenda. They see the issue as a distraction from other issues such as education, health care, jobs, Iraq, and Afghanistan. They believe that the Republicans emphasize that issue, as they did during the 2004 presidential election, to distract voters from their performance in office, particularly that of President Bush. It is an emotionally charged issue -- "red meat" as they say in politics.<br>  <br>  As a side note, you are "writing" an essay, not "righting" one. To "right" something is to correct something as in "to right a wrong."|`|uxOxkyEGaa	Right.

Once a member is discharged (not retired) from the military, the Department of Defense has nothing more to do with them. <br>  <br>  So no, it does not grant you access to a military installation.<br>  If you need medical care, you either have to go to the VA, or in an emergency, a authorized civilian medical facility|`|AA10932453	Anyone can get on most bases with just civilian ID and proof of car insurance -- just stop at the visitor center and ask for a day pass.<br>  <br>  The Veteran Health Card will not do you any good, because the medical activity on base will not treat you.  Even if you were medically retired or regular retired (e.g. you have an ID card), they would put you at the bottom of all the waiting lists for any treatment.<br>  <br>  But you can usually get on base with nothing but a drivers license and proof of insurance.|`|013WcMpRaa	It is very dependent on whether or not the post hospital has a VA clinic. At my post, Veterans with a VA medical ID card or a DAV perm ID card are authorized access to post with a valid State issued drivers license or ID card. The vehicle must also have a post decal or a visitor pass.

Kaudz4Msaa	Lincoln was the first Republican president.  Before that, the main parties were Democrats and Whigs (1800's.)  Whigs were formed in opposition to the Democrats, specifically Andrew Jackson's withdrawal of money from the Federal Treasury.  They called him "King Andrew" and thought he had too much power.  Millard Fillmore was the last Whig president.  Lincoln was originally a Whig, but broke off to help form the Republican party over the issue of slavery.<br>  <br>  Federalists were a faction of politicians during the Revolutionary period who supported a strong federal government (presidential office), as the name suggests.  Washington, John Jay, Alexander Hamilton are the most famous examples.  Hamilton was the first Secretary of the Treasury.  Read "The Federalist Papers" for examples of their ideas.  As things turned out, we had a "checks and balances" system instituted, to prevent either the federal government or the states from gaining too much power.|`|AA12117384	They're political parties that don't exist today.

It made up an unauthorized organization called the Federal Reserve - which is not federal and has no reserves. The US Constitution also requires all states to pay their debts only in silver. Which is why all US coins were originally minted in silver. But, instead of real money based upon valuable metal, our current federal reserve notes are based upon...nothing.<br>  <br>  I think the second reason for the fluctuations in the currency is the Congress refusal to obey the Tenth Amendment, and instead to pass law after law which is not authorized - including such things as so called "bail outs"- which are really nothing more than looting the country and giving the money away to bankers.<br>  <br>  There are other reasons, but these two far outclass the rest in net effect. For an easy explanation of why, watch this: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ueEfRXZC..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ueEfRXZC...</a><br>  <br>  As to what did they gain? Well, back in the 1950s the government gained a lot by spending the nation's gold and silver reserves that used to back the currency - but now it's gone.. And the federal reserve has purpetuated this illegal and unsustainable debt system for decades - but it will crash eventually. No country can sustain perpetual debt forever.<br>  <br>  Edit: for Bluegray: I see you wrote Medicare/Medicaid is a collection of some 40 programs that have been around for over 45 years (agreed), but I missed the second part...uh...what was the total cost since the 1960s of all 40 of those programs? And...uh...which article of the US Constitution authorizes the government to create a national "health care" system?<br>  <br>  And, perhaps, I shouldn't have called you people sheep. For that I apologize. I should have called you by your proper name - Communists.<br>  <br>  Edit for Bluegray: Please note that I did not say I support the war, nor did I say that we should be fighting in Iraq. But, did I just read where you said we should give the government control of the economy a little at a time? (Hybriding the systems is the words you used.) Why is loosing the rights enumerated in our Constitution slowly somehow better than loosing them all at once? You have been well indoctrinated comrade.<br>  <br>  I advotate the return of all the Constitution's guarentees - all money in silver, abolishing the federal reserve, war only in our own defense, and RIGID enforcement of the Tenth Amendment.

Medicaid is not 15 times more expensive than the Iraq war.  That would put it at 1.5 trillion dollars a year.  Do your research and post your crap resources before you sport lies.<br>  <br>  And even if it was that expensive, it's a combination of some 40 different programs and has been around since the 60s.  If it's been around for some 50 years and we haven't hit a recession this bad, I would say that the straw that broke our back was the War; given that it is the most recent large scale spending project that we've begun since before the depression.<br>  <br>  You call us sheep for thinking the war weakens our currency?  Do you think it doesn't?  You'd be a fool to imply otherwise, which you do.  You can in effect say any single government program weakens our currency with your logic, and that a sham.<br>  <br>  War does far less to return the costs spent than does Medicaid.  <br>  <br>  the War has cost us 500 billion as of right now, and that's more than half of the new stimulus.  We could have done without a war that we should never have gone into, but a government is supposed to take care of its people's health; in return, the people will contribute to it's economy.<br>  <br>  You're an arrogant fool to criticize others for being sheep when you yourself cannot look into a mirror.<br>  <br>  Edit* Ski<br>  <br>  Sorry for name calling...<br>  <br>  However I'm going to say the total cost of medicaid is irrelevant as it is obviously older than the Iraq war, but that doesn't mean it was more detrimental per year.  That was the reason I gave you yearly estimates.  <br>  <br>  Calling me a communist?  For thinking the war is a strain on our economy?  After all, I do recall you calling people sheep for that reason.  #1 I don't recall the opposite of communism (what would you call that, capitalism?) requiring we fight wars for the economy.  <br>  <br>  #2 I don't know if you've looked around, but we haven't been a purely capitalist society for a while, for pure capitalism is just as flawed as pure communism.  <br>  <br>  People should really get it stuck in their heads that we need to hybridize our system, and adapt, or our stubbornness will break us in the long run, like the soviets were broken by their own.<br>  <br>  Edit* Ski<br>  <br>  I don't even want to argue with you anymore, as there's no point in dealing with people who refuse to admit change is not a bad thing.  Get with the times man.  Your world is black and white.  Good and bad.  To call on a hybridization, is not losing all of our unalienable rights dude.

I don't like Obama, I think he was elected for the wrong reasons, I think he's an empty suit that was plucked from obscurity by bigwig democrats when he made his speech at the 2004 convention, has too many black supremacist connections (who he mostly dropped when they were no longer convenient for him) and is already in over his head.<br>  <br>  With all that said, it's ridiculous to blame Obama for this problem, his stimulus plan may make it worse, but he's only been in office a month.<br>  You can't hold him responsible for something that the last administration had 8 years to address and avert, but failed in all aspects.<br>              Democrats tend to do better when they instill fear in the populace (read books about campaign psychology) so the MSM (which is liberal slanted whether you admit it or not) played up economic woes, thus feeding the problem (perceptions of the economy can and do make "self-fulfilling prophecies) that was ALREADY brewing.<br>  <br>  Obama is not to blame for this. He's been office a month, at the worse his plan will do nothing to help the economy, at best it'll stimulate it a little and we'll all have to say he did his best.|`|LCA7gdoiaa	OBVIOUSLY - When Obama said "It's gonna get a lot worse" he knew that he had the ideas to make it happen.

I will reinvest in assets that will survive Obama, and patiently wait for his inevitable failure.He is not all that new, innovative or special except to the young, ignorant or naive. We`will weather this storm just as we have  had to under other incompetent presidents. Thankfully being president does not yet take on the personal power and control of a total dictator. We will not give Obama the chance to dis-assemble the Constitution to allow him any more power then every other president has had to work under. Even though he is trying at every turn to move things into his favor and the favor of the Democrats, he too will fail and  fall under the true will of the American people. Propagandizing and lying will only get him so far before his dramatic and total fall from power. I see reminiscings of Mussolini and his mistress if Obama does not stay within the letter of the law.

iJQqX37daa	Well for drill, that depend what your unit is. Most are about the same, we start out with formation, then we go to work, you may have class you have to do. (again that depend on your unit). Of course we have PT, (annual APFT), weapson qual, MOS training. the best part....we have lunch too. (love the Army chow..:))|`|FJFG0GKWaa	It's like being a civilian, except you do a couple of months of Basic Training with the Army.  Then they send you off to whatever MOS school you signed up for.  Next, you come home and do it once a month or so for a couple of days.  Unless there happens to be a war going on, then you wind up going to Ira... Afghanistan.  Reserves and National Guard units frequently get deployed.<br>  <br>  Other than that National Guard/Reserves are pretty much the same thing: "One Weekend a month Warriors"<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|sKGVnNYdaa	There is basic training first.  Then Advanced Individual Training.  Then you begin your career in your chosen field.  Depending on your chosen field it could easily transfer into the civilian work force.<br>  <br>  Basic training has several parts: orientation into the military, conditioning, discipline and in some instances how to fire a weapon with the intention of killing someone.  Be prepared to get into pretty good physical condition.  Just about everywhere you go you run or walk.  Also be prepared for a Drill Instructor to be in your face if you mess up.  That is the discipline part.  If you can't follow orders from your Drill Instructor and keep your mouth shut you'll be in trouble.<br>  <br>  I spent two years in the military.  I went in as a young teenager.  I came out a man fully capable of taking care of himself in all aspects of life

They see the sucking vacuum of non-leadership in the Republican party and think that it's their turn to jump in. Of course, they know that they can say that bull and that their constituents will have their hands out, too. Then they can say, "The people in my state are hurting and we can't raise the money through taxation, so it is with deepest regrets that we must accept a portion of the stimulus package to get people back to work." WTF? Also, even if they don't do that, they know that the state legislature will override them anyway so they can just blame it on the legislators. <br>  <br>  Governors like Barbour and Jindal are huge cowards anyway. Both of them lead states that were basically devastated by Katrina and a couple of other natural disasters. I can only hope that the voters down there get some sense and vote their butts out because they don't mean the people any good.

AA11707728	I'd say the thousand point crash in the stock market the very second that bit of mass theft became law, says it all.<br>  <br>  Twice in the last year, the states have voted on calling a constitutional convention and missed it by only 2 states.  With this latest catastrophe by the Obama administration, don't be surprised if that is actually called within a few months, or even weeks (something not done since the contitution was ratified).  If that happens, likely something drastic will be done.  At the very least, a balanced budget amendment will be added that will put a very strict hard cap on what the federal government can spend (like 10% of what they are spending now....maybe much less).  But, I would not be surprised in the slightest if the states voted to dissolve the federal government or even split our country into two or more.<br>  <br>  I would actually jump for joy at the chance for the productive, clear thinking, conservative half of the country to leave behind the liberal, neo-communist slackers, who are concentrated mostly on thin strips of land along the two costs.

jinAwMGNaa	NEW PREAMBLE TO THE CONSTITUTION <br>  <br>   The following has been attributed to State Representative Mitchell Kaye from GA. <br>  This guy should run for President one day... <br>  <br>  "We the sensible people of the United States, in an attempt to help everyone get along, restore some semblance of justice, avoid more riots, keep our nation safe, promote positive behavior, and secure the blessings of debt-free liberty to ourselves and our great-great-great-grandchildren, hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny, guilt ridden, delusional, and other liberal bed-wetters. <br>  <br>  We hold these truths to be self evident: that a whole lot of people are confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim they require a Bill of NON-Rights." <br>  <br>  ARTICLE I: <br>  You do not have the right to a new car, big screen TV, or any other form of wealth. More power to you if you can legally acquire them, but no one is guaranteeing anything. <br>  <br>  ARTICLE II: <br>  You do not have the right to never be offended. This country is based on freedom, and that means freedom for everyone -- not just you! You may leave the room, turn the channel, express a different opinion, etc.; but the world is full of idiots, and probably always will be. <br>  <br>  <br>  ARTICLE III: <br>  You do not have the right to be free from harm. If you stick a screwdriver in your eye, learn to be more careful; do not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives independently wealthy. <br>  <br>  ARTICLE IV: <br>  You do not have the right to free food and housing. Americans are the most charitable people to be found, and will gladly help anyone in need, but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generation after generation of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation if another generation of professional couch potatoes. <br>  (This one is my pet peeve...get an education and go to work....don't expect everyone else to take care of you!) <br>  <br>  ARTICLE V: <br>  You do not have the right to free health care. That would be nice, but from the looks of public housing, we're just not interested in public health care. <br>  <br>  ARTICLE VI: <br>  You do not have the right to physically harm other people. If you kidnap, rape, intentionally maim, or kill someone, don't be surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the electric chair. <br>  <br>  ARTICLE VII: <br>  You do not have the right to the possessions of others. If you rob, cheat, or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens, don't be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a place where you still won't have the right to a big screen color TV or a life of leisure. <br>  <br>  ARTICLE VIII: <br>  You do not have the right to a job All of us sure want you to have a job, and will gladly help you along in hard times, but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself useful. (AMEN!) <br>  <br>  ARTICLE IX: <br>  You do not have the right to happiness. Being an American means that you have the right to PURSUE happiness, which by the way, is a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an over abundance of idiotic laws created by those of you who were confused by the Bill of Rights. <br>  <br>  ARTICLE X: <br>  This is an English speaking country. We don't care where you are from, English is our language. Learn it or go back to wherever you came from! <br>  <br>  (Lastly....) <br>  <br>  ARTICLE XI: <br>  You do not have the right to change our country's history or heritage. This country was founded on the belief in one true God. And yet, you are given the freedom to believe in any religion, any faith, or no faith at all; with no fear of persecution.

I know I cant it is worth anything to me!!!|`|4VzVfKvdaa	First of all, it was the USMC helo squadron at Quantico; not the air force.  Second, they are to replace the Marine 1 helos that are over 30 years old and the order for them was placed in 2003.  Finally, the price may seem outrageous, but there were numerous design changes and cost over runs and also includes spares and warranties and upgrades for quite a few years...the cost of ownership.  Just wait until you see what the new tankers that are needed cost when they are bought.  The ones we have now are over 40 years old and will soon start dropping out of the sky.  No tankers..no airlift or air cover to anywhere.<br>  <br>  Edit:  They will soon be trying to buy new air force one aircraft as well since the spares for 747-200s are getting really hard and expensive to get.  They should be out by 2017.|`|x5c7ek7paa	what? link? no helicopter is that expensive, the F-22 doesn't even cost that much.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  wow,<br>  <br>  you are serious<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VH-71_Kestrel" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VH-71_Kestr...</a>|`|9qJPfpRpaa	While I agree we spend entirely too much on unnecessary military expenditures, where are you getting these numbers from?|`|WyNOAZb9aa	at least it wasn't $790,000,000,000 for NOTHING.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	No they didn't.<br>  <br>  That was the estimated cost of the new presidential helicopters.<br>  <br>  But that contract is on hold for cost over runs.|`|vKxt1i0Faa	5 Marines can do more damage.
Ljq25VEJaa	Well, if 5 million packs of smokes are sold each day in the U.S., and the tax increase on each of those packs is $.61 that's $3,050,000 per day off of cigarette sales.  Multiply that by 365 and you get $1,113,250,000/yr.  Kind of seems like that 75 million is a token "Stop Smoking" ad.  In reality they are thinking "Smoke you bastards, smoke!"|`|DiDCG9UBaa	I'm not sure what the "porkulus bill" is, but the government has been taking money from smokers for decades...maybe they should give some back.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	Dont forget the fact that the expanded SCHIP programs will be funded with cigarette taxes. lol, this is hilarious

No matter what shape the country is in, anybody who works and makes a decent living will be worse off in 4 years.<br>  <br>  Who do you think is going to pay for all this, including the Minimum wage increases, the healthcare reforms, the bloated schip program, the extensions on unemployment.  I will be paying for it.  My children will pay for it, My grandchildren will pay for it.  It has been progressivly getting worse for 70 years.  Always more money, always government saving us from ourselves, always government is the answer.<br>  <br>  Well government is not the answer.  Government has never gotten us out of any crises, it is always the people.  If the government doesn't allow the people to see the full value of the hard work at all levels, then the people will not have the desire to work.  When people stop working or striving for excellence, then who pays.  <br>  <br>  And as far as the horse and buggy comment, No I expect him to be frugal with the people's money.  He demanded that congress pass a stimulus bill, then flew to Chicago to have valentines day dinner at a steak restaurant (amazing, that was important government business).  And instead of signing this ultra important bill in Chicago ( a bill can be signed anyplace in the world).  He flew back to Washington, Then on to Denver before he signed it on Tuesday.

Thanks to the new bill, we have now out spent any legislation ever... We have now created dependents on the government.  Do you mean to tell me you dont mind footing the bill for irresponsible home buyers, poor business decisions by car execs, increasing the taxes, for ex, here in CA they increased the DMV fees to double, your stimulus money and I have no idea where you live, but is now paying for a bridge in Missouri that is employing 60 people, and paying for a train from Los Angeles to Vegas. You dont mind that?  If you dont your a fool!   Mr. I will bring home the troops just signed up thousands to go to Afganistan. Mr. I will clean up and be responsible for the environment wants you to lower your heating bill and inflate your tires however the White House it kept at 70 and he isn't even there. Oh right, at the costs of $5700 an hour and YES my facts are right.... that is the cost of flying Air Force 1 AN HOUR!  So he flew to Chi town last week, then on to Denver, then to Arizona then today he is in Canada.   Hmmm. What are you doing?  Inflating your tires and freezing out your children?<br>  <br>  No, quite the opposite, you are out of touch and so is the President. There was NO reason for him to fly this week to those sites to sign his bill. In fact, and you can fact check me if you'd like, NO President has taken his pet projects on the road to sign. ESPECIALLY when we are talking money and wasteful spending. How can he (or you) justify spending nearly $1,000,000 dollars to fly his pen and paper around. All bills have been signed in or around the White House or Capitol. In regards to the  temp in the house, he campaigned on us setting our thermostats at 64 degrees.  He campaigned on bringing home the troops.  He campaigned on helping the middle class.  Well, my taxes will be going up $982 starting on April; my state sales tax is up 1.15% and my DMV fees double in 09'.  I totally have a grip that is the problem, I am quite versed in economics, politics and local legislation.|`|zEVpA4WCaa	KEEP ON DREAMING IT WONT HAPPEN,AND WE WILL BE THE FIRST TO SAY TOLD YOU SO.I REALLY DO HOPE THINGS GET BETTER BUT IT WONT HAPPEN THIS WAY.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	You're delusional.  Obama's plan is to continue stringing the "victims" along so he can get their votes in 2012.  He wouldn't allow it to get that much better even if he could.
LWzrCu5caa	Beautiful dream, wake unto me.....<br>  <br>  You will get what they issue to you.   You would feel pretty dumb to be somewhere with a 45 and the only ammo available is  9 mm.   Also they have enough problems with violations of the rules of war.  If they allow troops to have "throw away guns" it will make it even harder to investigate claims of war crimes.<br>  <br>  Dogzilla is wrong.  The 9mm was picked because according to NATO treaty,  we have to use the same ammo as the other NATO nations.  Since they all used the 9mm,  we got stuck with it when the 45s finally wore out.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	NO, you can not use your own weapons.<br>  <br>  There is a reason everyone uses the same weapons.<br>  <br>  That way ammo can be shared.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	If you are lucky, you may come across an old .45 cal. Grease gun SMG. If so, grab it.|`|szkrumAJaa	Cross that bridge when you get to it.|`|FJFG0GKWaa	Your issue weapon will be a 9mm.  This is what they will give you training, rounds, and ammo for.  Civilian weapons are not A) Encouraged and B) Allowed.  Because in the end, that sidearm is pretty useless on a battlefield, whether it be your prize Springfield or the Beretta.  Infantry Officers below LtCol (and even some of them) carry M16's. <br>  <br>  Also: There is no "Proper Qualifying" for any other weapon than a government issued weapon.  You can't "petition" the Dept of Defense or whatever to shoot your own weapon for qual.<br>  <br>  Also, as an Officer, you are directing combat primarily, not directly acting in it.  Unless you are a Marine Officer ;) <br>  <br>  Anyway, hope some of this helps.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|pJfR3gUOaa	A 9mm is the only option as far as a hand gun goes for the regular military....however, the 45 cal. is avaliable to special operations only and is often used as their secondary weapon for close quarters combat operations.  If you want a 45, you will have to go SF.  Otherwise you have to use what is issued to you.|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	The military chose the 9mm because it has the best combination of power and recoil. The difference between the two is about 10 percent, which is an acceptable reduction in power seeing that hitting a target is the point. <br>  Thats also the reason for the 5.56 being selected for service.|`|tcUXitYJaa	yes the 9mm is the only option...trust me, it does the job if needed.|`|bhc7HuN9aa	If you want to carry a .45 (great Choice!) say go ahead.<br>  Patton carried his own.<br>  You'll have to provide your own ammo.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	I wouldn't turn my nose up at the Beretta 92's they're very nice and 9mm is actually very easy to handle.|`|x5c7ek7paa	That is not going to happen, you cannot bring your own.|`|5BbxCohFaa	if the military issues a gun to me i will trust it is the gun for the job after all we didnt get here today with out the good guns of our military|`|lEaT5q06aa	once you are a general, you can choose your own personal sidearm<br>  otherwise you go with the TO and E<br>  if you are commander you may be able to alter the TO&E within very close limits, but otherwise you are stuck with what they provide<br>  <br>  i was not happy when they came through with the 9mm<br>  and my understanding is that SF, at least in some places, is back with the 1911, which was built for a specific reason, that the 9mm is unable to address<br>  <br>  my understanding is that the military went with the 9mm because 1) than is what most of nato uses and 2) production contracts could be sent to nato allies<br>  <br>  the 9mm is most certainly NOT the better round when you are a tough spot|`|esOaJoqBaa	Sorry, no personal weapons.

You could be charged with failure to report a crime, withholding evidence land hindering apprehension.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	its only illegal if you identify it as an actual authentic ipod instead of fake if you do say its an authentic ipod you could get sued for selling the fake. but as long as your honest and the people know its not real then they cant come back and sue you. i would personally sue the person that sold you the fake ipod because if you didnt know it was fake he can be charged with fraud|`|fgIbNRHfaa	You would not be liable for fraud if you clearly identified it as a fake, but you could still be sued for trademark infrigement because you are selling a product which infringes on a protected trademark.|`|zBRpOQ9Yaa	you would have to sell it as an ipod clone because if the buyer reports you and eBay is feeling up to the task they can make a lot of problems for you|`|ARKyNCLgaa	It would probally help by asking this in an ELECTRONIC category

I do not see any for mentioned things as being negative. Not a draft, just a way for American people to grow stronger for all applications in life. On the side line there are some countries that make it mandatory such as Bulgaria and Israel that I can think of. When you are done your one year you can continue a military career, or take those skills and apply them to other careers and education furtherment.|`|aFC72tLZaa	The draft ended after Vietnam.

This will mean that you will not have points on your DMV record. What you really want to do is avoid having any points. The insurance companies run your DMV record everytime you apply for insurance or change companies. And they will see your points and the more points you have the more they negatively affect your insurance cost. So take the traffic school option. You can take the it online hence avoiding to have to go sit in class all day.

fgIbNRHfaa	So let me get this right.  You are 19, have never had a job, live rent free with your family, your family bought you a car and pays all your bills, including $800 a month while you do who knows what, and you are complaining that they are hypocrites?  Give me a break.  Quit your whining and grow up.  You have a son to think about now.  Either get your head out from up your *** and get serious about school, or get a job.  Your grandmother is paying for your daycare, so there is no reason you can't work.  The economy may be causing downsizing of corporations, but people are still eating at McDonalds and Taco Bell.  You could find a job if you really looked and tried.  Learn to be responsible and quit looking for another free ride (i.e. housing assistance).  I was raised by a single Mom who never bought me a car nor paid for any of my bills.  I busted my *** to put myself through school by working full time at night.  I started law school as a single parent with a 4 year old son.  I don't mean to sound heartless, but until you learn to take responsiblity for your own life, you will never be happy.  You do not want your child to grow up thinking that society owes him something|`|RxeQJcqhaa	I don't get why gma is paying $800 for daycare when you don't work? <br>  <br>  Get on meds for the ADHD - counseling can also help you learn ways to cope with it. Use those hours the baby is in daycare and get a job and keep it.<br>  <br>  Save every penny of each paycheck towards your goal of being on your own.  You won't probably get real far without college, so try night school and only take a couple classes so you don't get overwhelmed. You can even do a class or two online. <br>  <br>  You got yourself in your situation but you are looking at it realistically, albeit a little whiny,so you know what some of your shortcomings are, which is more than some people every figure out! <br>  <br>  You mentioned you "got in trouble" and your xmas car is being taken away. What did you do? Figure out how to make it right. <br>  <br>  Make your goals about your son- if things are right with him and you do right by him you will have a lot to be proud of. Put his needs first, because that's what a good mom does, and you will also be able to make your dreams come true.  Not going to be easy, but like I said, you have taken a good look at yourself, so you know what you need to change. Good luck!!!|`|4z1gryIGaa	First you need to take a deep breath. ok. Now to start off you are very lucky as you know to have family that willing to help. The answer right now is to find employment before you even think about getting your own place. Yes, there are places that will help you but at the same time your still going to need employment(I live in Illinois so I can't exactly direct you to a place) but they are out there. You are just going to have to deal with your situation until you find a job to change it.

They took our business and personal records, left me out of the funeral, took the money in his bank account (which was my money.)  The point is that he NEEDS to make a will.

But whereas it makes sense to bail out banks (because, crooked or not, they are the only wheel in town) it makes no sense to prop up a unionized industry such as the domestic auto sector because the country has already shown that it can live without it - hence the crisis in that sector. The result of a bailout in a unionized industry is to effectively pay unemployment benefits at union scales to the relative disadvantage of everyone else.<br>  The irony of all of this is that if the Government had done its job and regulated and monitored the financial sector as it should have done, there would be no precedent for other sectors to scream "Why not me too?!"|`|Fyq5nK4waa	The problem is the bailout will only save poorly run, mismanaged, and incompetent corporations.  <br>  <br>  The natural business cycle is like mother nature.

They are afraid that the US will forget their agenda on North Korea, in terms of the provision of aid, and perhaps so that the US will tell the South Koreans to step down their hardline stance on the North in exchange for "good behavior". Of course, this isn't going to happen since the US distrusts North Korea. Besides, talking on tech, North Korea cannot go to war with the South, and they probably know it, commie they are though, they're not that stupid. True, the North has numerical superiority, but the South has far, far greater tech capabilities, and anyway the numerical gap has been closing in recent years.

Why the thumbs down? I voted before the Nixon scandal and did not say who I voted for or even if I was old enough to vote. <br>  The last few months have changed my view drastically.

The Political Party Loyalty thing is a tool used by both parties to keep we the people divided with "evil other party blame games" While they go about feathering their own nest and voting for the benefit of their financial backers.<br>  We need to stop being distracted by the "evil other party" propaganda and not holding our own Representatives responsible for what they do. Vote for those who vote for our interest, and vote out those who do not.<br>  I have told my Senators I will not vote for their re election in 2010 because 1`They Failed to represent me in their votes, (I had emailed asking them to vote No to the first bail out) 2 They failed to protect my interests with regards to how the money was to be used for that bail out 3 They allowed themselves a raise at the further expense of the tax payers showing that they are unwilling to make any sacrifice for the Main Street population that they are suppose to be working for.<br>  Their pay raise could have been declined by them. BOTH parties had their hands in their failure to do so. They are two sides of the same coin. They look different on the outside but when it comes to representing "We the people" neither are worth the cooper that they are imprinted on.

The republican climate of "deregulation" allowed them to be totally crooked and finally go belly up - but the structure of the institution is usable and could be saved.<br>  <br>  We'll have to nationalize these things - fire the republicans and put them up for sale again - and THIS TIME WITH LOTS OF BANK REGULATORS AND ACCOUNTANTS WHO VISIT DAILY.<br>  <br>  No more free ride - they've had 30 years of free rides - pay no taxes - write out BIG BONUS checks to the bosses.

dJnRFpWWaa	It doesn't feel good. isn't that self-evident? We don't have the luxury of remaining angry or feeling sorry for ourselves. We have to solve both problems simultaneously. We have to make insolvent or barely solvent banks solvent and functional and we need to relieve over-leveraged homeowners of their crushing mortgage debt service as rationally as possible in order to turn this economy in which we all sink or swim.<br>  <br>  If we keep trying to affix blame on this group or the other for past acts we will overlook the fact that fixing problems is the only way to make the future better. Fixing problems have nothing to do with the past. It has everything to do with creating a better economic future for our country in which, unlike the last 8 years, there will be winners and losers determined through by a free market capitalism appropriately regulated and overseen by the federal government.<br>  <br>  It's about the future, not the past.

So now, the second half is supposed to go towards rewriting loans to hopefully stem the tide of foreclosures.  Will it work?

And the Democrats denying that Barry doing the same thing won't have the same effect.  What the f*ck?  It's completely mindboggling.<br>  <br>  Now you would expect this from the Libs, but not the "Conservatives"...

Supporters and critics of the administration are tripping over themselves to blame the deficit on tax cuts, the war, and a slow economy. But the fact is we have mounting deficits because George W. Bush is the most gratuitous big spender to occupy the White House since Jimmy Carter. One could say that he has become the "Mother of All Big Spenders."<br>  <br>  The new estimates show that, under Bush, total outlays will have risen $408 billion in just three years to $2.272 trillion: an enormous increase in federal spending of 22 percent. Administration officials privately admit that spending is too high. Yet they argue that deficits are appropriate in times of war and recession. So, is it true that the war on terrorism has resulted in an increase in defense spending? Yes. And, is it also true that a slow economy has meant a decreased stream of tax revenues to pay for government? Yes again. <br>  <br>  But the real truth is that national defense is far from being responsible for all of the spending increases. According to the new numbers, defense spending will have risen by about 34 percent since Bush came into office. But, at the same time, non-defense discretionary spending will have skyrocketed by almost 28 percent. *****Government agencies that Republicans were calling to be abolished less than 10 years ago, such as education and labor, have enjoyed jaw-dropping spending increases under Bush of 70 percent and 65 percent respectively.*****<br>  <br>  -- 2003 (Rep. congress)|`|O5DZvc0Xaa	Bush and Obama are puppets to the same globalist interests. It is THOSE INTERESTS to whom the current economic policies should rightly be attributed. <br>  <br>  I don't really believe there was ever such a thing as "Bush policies" and I don't believe in "Obama policies" either. I don't believe that any President since JFK has had "policies" of his own. Presidents are no longer elected... they are selected. In Obama's case, I believe he was groomed for the position. The same people remain in power.<br>  <br>  Call them what you want... even Time Magazine has begun using the term "New World Order" again. Taboo, stigma... "conspiracy theory" ... whatever.

What we're seeing now is the failure of the Subprime Mortgage Market (AKA Subprime Mortgage Crisis), which was a direct result of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1995 (CRA1995) that was signed into law by President Bill Clinton.<br>  <br>  CRA1995 forced banks to use a point based system to determine the eligibility of applicants for home loans, with the three biggest points values coming from their area of residence, their race, and their income. <br>  <br>  The Community Reinvestment Act (or CRA, Pub.L. 95-128, title VIII, 91 Stat. 1147, 12 U.S.C. § 2901 et seq.) is a United States federal law designed to encourage commercial banks and savings associations to meet the needs of borrowers in all segments of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.[1][2][3] The Act was intended to reduce discriminatory credit practices against such neighborhoods, a practice known as redlining.[4] The Act requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agencies to encourage regulated financial institutions to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they are chartered, consistent with safe and sound operation. (See full text of Act and current regulations.[1]) To enforce the statute, federal regulatory agencies examine banking institutions for CRA compliance, and take this information into consideration when approving applications for new bank branches or for mergers or acquisitions.[5]<br>  <br>  Enforcement<br>  The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, enacted in 1974, makes it unlawful for any creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction, on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age. Failure to comply can subject a financial institution to civil liability for actual and punitive damages in individual or class actions with punitive damages as much as $10,000 in individual actions and the lesser of $500,000 or 1 percent of the creditor’s net worth in class actions.[6]<br>  <br>  By contrast, the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act defines discrimination in terms of loans made to individuals and business borrowers in different areas or neighborhoods, but does not mandate any civil or punitive damages.[7][8][9] The CRA mandates that all banking institutions that receive FDIC insurance be evaluated by the relevant banking regulatory agencies to determine if the institution has met the credit needs of its entire community in a manner consistent with safe and sound operations.[2] The law does not list specific criteria for evaluating the performance of financial institutions. Rather, it directs that the evaluation process should accommodate the situation and context of each individual institution. The law also does not require institutions to make high-risk loans that may bring losses to the institution; instead it emphasizes that an institution's CRA activities should be undertaken in a safe and sound manner.[2][10] There are no specific penalties for non-compliance with the CRA, unless a violation of the Equal Credit Opport|`|i0vcEyJtaa	If we continue the current policies, maybe 10 years or more.

Army medics have previously completed medic training, and many hold certifications as NREMT-Bs. The Army now requires all medics to transition to a minimum of NREMT-Basic status. The PDT course provides an opportunity for the noncertified medic to sit for the National Registry exam and meet this transition requirement. This certification not only provides a basic knowledge of emergency medical care, but also leaves the soldier-medic with a marketable civilian skill once he or she leaves the Army.<br>  <br>       The next five days of the PDT course are dedicated to Combat Medic Advanced Skills Training (C-MAST). It is during this course that the soldier-medics alter their focus from civilian prehospital emergency medical training to combat medical skills that save lives on the battlefield. The final three days of the course consist of "lanes" training under simulated battlefield conditions that allow the medics to utilize skills learned in the classroom. This training combines all the assessment and treatment skills learned during the previous 18 days and requires the medic to make instant decisions regarding triage and treatment under increasingly difficult conditions.|`|IKw5lXQbaa	medics deploy with what ever brigade they are in.a medic is usually placed in a company thats attached to a battalion witch is attached to a brigade.|`|OEMCUtKkaa	as often as everyone else is deployed...|`|LBg4DNpCaa	often

If he did that, future generations would spit on his name. Anyway, a potential bill to pass the secession of the supposed Talibanistan could not bludgeon it's way through parliament, lawmakers would howl with protest.

If we give them a country they'll form a government and install their power mongers and they'll be bullet proof by international law. the last thing we need is to have president Bin Laden and vice president Bush with such coverage.

O5DZvc0Xaa	EO 11110 is actually still in effect, I believe. Obama wouldn't have to sign anything. He could simply instruct Geithner to have the Treasury start printing JFK's silver-backed United States Notes. Of course, he would never do that anyways, as he was clearly installed by the banksters themselves! And Geithner (prior to his nomination as Treasury Sec.) was the President of the NY branch of the Federal Reserve -- a privately owned company that could be put out of business if the US Note became the primary currency.<br>  <br>  It is strange that there is technically no "legal" framework for our monetary system.<br>  <br>  The only thing stopping people from introducing competing currencies, or refusing to pay the "federal" income tax, is the intimidation, coercion, and mafia-esque strong-arm tactics of the IRS and the internationalist bankers that own the federal government.<br>  <br>  They don't really have the law on their side, but good luck telling them that! Especially when they have a gun to your head, and they own your entire financial life.<br>  <br>  Good quotes though. It's nice to see this info finally getting around.<br>  <br>  But please, don't count on Obama to fix this. He's a corporate invention. A brand identity. Nothing more. Even after only a month in office... I have no doubts about who he works for. Just look at his nominations, or the contents of his precious "stimulus" bill.

I just wanted to take a minute to prove Thunderhammer of Shocking wrong regarding his belief about Jefferson's quote.<br>  <br>  "We must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. We must make our selection between economy and liberty or profusion and servitude. If we run into such debts as that we must be taxed in our meat in our drink, in our necessities and comforts, in our labors and in our amusements, for our callings and our creeds...our people.. must come to labor sixteen hours in the twenty-four, give earnings of fifteen of these to the government for their debts and daily expenses; and the sixteenth being insufficient to afford us bread, we must live..  We have not time to think, no means of calling the mis-managers to account, but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the necks of our fellow suffers.  Our landholders, too...retaining indeed the title and stewardship of estates called theirs, but held really in trust for the treasury, must...be contented with penury, obscurity and exile.. private fortunes are destroyed by public as well as by private extravagance.<br>  <br>  This is the tendency of all human governments. A departure from principle becomes a precedent for a second; that second for a third; and so on, till the bulk of society is reduced to mere automatons of misery, to have no sensibilities left but for sinning and suffering... And the fore horse of this frightful team is public debt. Taxation follows that, and in it's train wretchedness and oppression." <br>  <br>  --  Thomas Jefferson|`|AA10415685	They have no intention of saving the Dollar.The truth is the world is washing out all monetary systems,we are going to one world financial system. a chip will implanteded near the base of your wrist scanning it will give you access to any transaction you want to make|`|f4Yec6iNaa	I think Obama knows better than to bite the hand that feeds him.

It has nothing to do with raising an army, but with control through the monetary system. As the Baron Rothschild said, "Let me control a countries money and I don't care who makes the laws!" Not a direct quote.<br>  To save the economy all we need to do is kill the Federal Reserve system and put the making of the money and setting the interest back into the hands of the government, and get back on the gold standard, which would limit how much money they can spend. <br>  Yes this would limit wages as we could only produce an amount of money under the amount of gold we had in reserves. This would lower the pay and prices of purchased items as well as wages, making people think more in terms of less is more, because the dollar would be worth more than it is now. At present it cost more to stamp a penny than the penny is worth and possibly the nickel too.<br>  <br>  Edit: I just looked up EO11110 and it has not been repealed and is, in fact still in effect. I believe the reason it is not being pushed is because if it were who ever was the pusher would be with Lincoln and Kennedy, McKinley and Garfield the four presidents that acted against the National Banking System.<br>  If O baa ma wants too emulate his hero, Lincoln, he will activate EO11110 and dispose of the Federal Reserve System once and for all, or the Fed would have him killed. In any case we would know and could react accordingly against the Fed.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	Obama can't save the dollar or the economy when he signed a bill that spends billions of dollars that do not exist.

Seems like common sense to me.|`|3MM64geHaa	It is because most blacks are liberals so there are not many running, dear!|`|TvD9BIGRaa	Why is it that Democrats vote for morons, black or white!|`|ExCAedp4aa	It's because the GOP has a smaller pool of non-white candidates, which is because they get less support from people who aren't white. <br>  <br>  There are Hispanic (mostly Cuban-Americans) that are GOP elected officials (look at Florida) and Vietnamese Americans are also strong supporters of the Republican Party but I know of no Vietnamese-American elected officials and the Vietnamese-American population is concentrated on the liberal West Coast. Younger Cuban-Americans and Vietnamese-Americans may be trending away from the GOP, it's hard to say right now. But basically, they have only a very tiny pool of non-white candidates to choose from. I mean, when Obama's opponent for the Senate dropped out in 2006, they actually ran Alan Keyes against him, and Alan Keyes is a known crackpot.|`|lza4rhDqaa	I agree with the first person, and also it is because, dun-dun-dunna*--95% of blacks are democrats!

The clerical error sounds like it has nothing to do with how his case would have came out. It's just a different title on the paperwork. As long as the sentence is the same.

8dc5NMexaa	1st, do not "knee jerk" react by assuming that if you talked with them, that they would be so kind as to release you from contractual payments.  <br>  On your blackboard or diagram board, state all possibilities under your GOAL of "Get out of this Contract;" you can see it clearer.<br>  Do not compliment them such as "in a great after school Martial Arts program."  Do not tell them how much your son enjoyed it.  Now is not the time for such. <br>  Don't tell them that you can no longer afford it.  Their 3-year contract was long-ago created by their business plan fully knowing that many enrollees would not stay for the whole three years, and with that business plan, they relied on attorneys to draft their contract in a manner that enrollees would be obligated for three years.  Do not assume that they care more about their client's financial difficulties than they do their profits.  If you tell them that you can no longer afford it, and they don't care, then they are not in a defensive mode, rather they are in an offensive mode.<br>  If I were them, and I was deciding what defaulting parties I was going to sue, then I would sue those who dropped out without any complaint about the program or who stated that they just could not further afford it.  I would think very long and hard, if I were them, before I filed suit against a defaulting party who might file a counter-claim against me.  <br>  Get the contract that you signed before you and a copy of their brochure.  Analyze it, the words, the phrases, their promises, their obligations, and their brochure promises. Do so as you would if you were analyzing a contract at work. Be nit-picky with your fine-tooth comb. TV's not interesting now, and this question is, so here goes a long letter example that I would write to the program, sending the same by certified mail.<br>  "Having considered the comments of other clients of the program; and having observed the program, instructions, and other activities of the program; the written materials of the program; the statements of the employees and instructors of the program; the unilaterally added requirements by the program as to additional charges that were not set out with particularity by the program as to amounts that were charged in order for my son to fully participate in good standing, such as charges for gradings, testing, level attainments, tournament fees, trips, uniforms, equipment, and other miscellaneous charges, I have concluded that there exists sufficient questions as to the existence of a deceptive trade practices violation.  I question also, from the above sources of information, personal and from others, whether the program is appropriately implementing its training and instruction in a manner calculated to achieve the results and goals of the art of (Tae Kwon Do, Aikido, Karate, Tai Chi, or ....), and by failing to do so, breached its obligations.  Having the above concerns, I have initially sought information from martial arts organizations and legal advice.  From those sources, I have been instructed to consider whether I want to pursue legal action.  I am not conclusively persuaded to do so at the moment, for I have a decision to make before I return to legal advice and consequential action.  I have been asked to request of you the curricula vitae or resume of all of the instructors and a copy of their instructor certifications and licenses from the issuing authority.  I have also been asked to request of you copies of the safety guidelines of the regulating authority as they relate to instructors, mode and manner of instruction, and of all of the equipment utilized in the instruction.  I have been asked to request quite a few more things from you; however before I do ask of you these things, I will, and am, considering my option of "cutting my losses of time" short."  <br>     <br>  Ending Note: It's a judgment call, of course.|`|1hciyvKdaa	You messed up, dont sign your life away like that. It is a legal contract, I do not like how marital arts does that. I know all about how the do not explain any of that. All you can try to do is to ask them if they will allow you out of your contract, and if they say no, either stop paying and hope they dont take recourse on your credit, or send you son letting him and the teacher both know you will not be doing any testing and belting and field trips so spare discussing it with your son at school. You never know, if you go in all in remorse, and tell tlhem you will be coming back when your situation gets better and you will use thier studio again they may say yes, the economy is bad on them too though. I hope you can get it all sorted out.|`|UQWusO1waa	that is just ridiculous, a 3 year contract for that school. one contract year would be  ridiculous.

Just explain your situation they may be willing to co-operate after all you could give them a bad rep. if they don't.<br>  Ask to see the contract it may say how it can be broken yes they have to let you see it if they did not give you your own.|`|d4e41d3df62e651aeb95bc6da71e5eacaa	Kill the bastard.

That's $194 Billion being pumped into the economy at no cost.  Some tax preparers, Accountants, and tax lawyers would new to change their jobs, but these numbers would be much less than the current unemployment.  <br>  <br>  With a Fair Tax, there would be no corporation tax allowing businesses to grow and create jobs.

What does evals have to do with anything since he doesn't want to go to boot camp anyway.  The army recruiter can't do anything.  Your recruiter is right, he doesn't have to let you go until June 10th if he doesn't want to.  <br>  <br>  I'm a navy recruiter in Cleveland Ohio and the way it works is you can't join any other service until you are out of the DEP in the navy.  <br>  <br>  You made the decision to join the navy and you already joined.  If the station that you joined out of has another person to join and can afford to take the loss and make up for you leaving then he can let you go earlier.  He has to submit a Dep Action Request to the CO to let you go.  Its NOT up to the recruiter but he plays a big part of it.  <br>  <br>  Why after all that paperwork do you want to switch over to the Army?   The army recruiters shouldn't even be talking to you if you are in the Navy DEP program<br>  <br>  If you want info, email me at d_underwood@yahoo.com|`|GoSYE02kaa	No. You are not contractually bound by anything while in DEP. He is just threatening you because he needs to fill his quota. If he doesn't get a certain amount of people to join a month he could receive a poor eval which will make it harder for him to advance.

PWvS7vqPaa	Unless you are a Class III FFL/SOT dealer or a military or law enforcement armorer with unit/department approval, you cannot legally buy an M4.  This is because machine guns (which the M4 is) have been banned for sale to civilians since 19 May 1986.  Only machine guns made AND registered prior to that date have been allowed to be bought and sold among non FFL/SOT civilians.<br>  <br>  If you want to buy an "M4," there will only be a few routes you can go aside from joining the military:<br>  <br>  1) Join a police department and become an armorer for them.  In most cases you will be able to repair and/or fix weapons for the department.  However, they will be department weapons and not personal weapons.<br>  <br>  2) Become an FFL/SOT (Special Occupational Taxpayer).  These are also known as Class III dealers and can legally buy and sell new machine guns whereas the general public cannot.  Anyone can become an FFL/SOT as long as they meet the requirements which include a background check, no criminal history, etc.  You must also pay the large upfront fee to get he license and a very large annual fee to maintain it.  In addition, you MUST buy AND sell in class III items (machine guns, suppressors, SBR, SBS, etc).  If you do not sell and only buy, then the federal government can and will arrest you on tax evasion as that is what it is.  For an explanation of why this is, you can e-mail me or message me on YIM.<br>  <br>  3) You can buy a legally transferrable machine gun (e.g. AR-15 or M16) made before 19 May 1986.  It will cost you anywhere from $9000-$22,000, but it will be legal.  Then, simply take the lower receiver and mount a new M4 upper receiver to it which is perfectly legal to have.  Technically it will not be an M4, but it will look and function exactly the same.<br>  <br>  EDIT: To OIFVET.  Actually it is a machine gun.  It may not be what the military terms a machine gun, but it is a machine gun in the eyes of a law.  The definition, according to the Federal Government (Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives), of a machine gun is:<br>  <br>  "Firearms within the definition of machinegun include weapons that shoot, are designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot without manual reloading by a single function of the trigger."<br>  <br>  In other words, even with burst or full auto it does not matter as just the ability to fire more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger defines it as a machine gun.|`|3xTNOevjaa	try e-bay :P|`|afAqlE3qaa	I want to elaborate on what chaseajordan and eagle said.

They go shopping and help stores, pay sales taxes, pay rent to landlords, and since they are God's children they show the hypocrisy of those who think they shouldn't be treated as a neighbor.  I know some of them turn to crime, get free services, and take jobs that Americans could do, but so do many greedy fatcats.  I'd rather criticize the hotshots that milk their companies dry, take millions of dollars and lay off thousands of employees, then declare bankruptcy and still get to keep a few of their mansions.<br>  That being said, we shouldn't let people in so easily, but when they are here, they are human and deserve to be treated as such.|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	well here are some that help but 90% are illegal and only drain the social services of states and  tax payers.

In my state (Louisiana), an employer is required by law to pay accrued but unused vacation pay upon termination regardless of what their policy may be.  The failure to do so results in STEEP penalties.  Also, an employer can usually not take vacation pay away from you once you have earned it, but can say at any time that no employee will earn any more vacation from that point forward.  Again, this varies by state.|`|3df62cd5d4c4550eefa351b54399e098aa	I would contact the Department of Labor and ask them if this is lawful.  You may not be the only affected by this.

fgIbNRHfaa	This is a matter of state law.  In Louisiana, you would most definitely get your UE benefits.  Of course in this state, you have to practically be caught stealing to be denied benefits . . .  The fact that the employer did not appear is likely to prevent them from contesting your benefits, unless the employer can show that they were not properly served with notice of the hearing or can otherwise show a compelling reason for their non-appearance.

However, if the new husband did not adopt then it can be collected as well as back child support.  <br>  <br>  Often, in adoptions, a public notice is filed in the county in which the biological father was last known to live.  This is a legal form of notification.|`|fgIbNRHfaa	This is a state law question.  In my state (Louisiana), if a birth parent has wilfully failed to pay child support ordered by the Court or has failed to attempt any contact with the child for 6 months, a stepparent can adopt without the birth parent's consent.  The legal adoption should terminate the obligation to pay child support as of that moment, but would not erase any child support obligation prior to the date of adoption.  However, I believe the mother would have to establish paternity before the now-alleged father would be liable for anything at all.|`|AA10104881	WOW, that poor child.

R7Hexutqaa	Tax cuts are a Republican answer to everything.  We had 8 years of Tax cuts under Bush with war spending on top of that.  What we got out of it was a war we did not need to wage, a doubling of the national debt, and an anemic decade of growth and expansion (compared to the 90s) that ended in the worst recession in 80 years.  <br>  <br>  Yes we are spending more now - but as a reaction to the financial crisis and severe recession - not as a matter of long term policy.<br>  <br>  Every credible economic expert tell us that with the credit markets frozen, Government spending is the only thing that can stop the tail spinning economy.  <br>  <br>  That is not socialism.  But if you allow the economy to fail to the point where everyone is equally poor, then you might as well have socialism because you are left with nothing else.|`|eu6UQElYaa	You're right to doubt it.  Economists are doubting it.  Everyone is doubting it.   Yes REASONABLE tax cuts would work better because the more money people have in their pockets the more comfortable they are with putting it into the stock market, the housing market, and the banks.   And a DECENT stimulus package would work better than the porkulous manifesto that Obama just rushed through.   One that streamlined spending to focus primarily on building infastructure, creating jobs immediately, and providing tax relief as opposed to one that put 90% of the spending into favors and liberal agendas like saving breeding grounds for some mice in California.   Now is not the time for that kind of nonsense and a stimulus package is not the place for that kind of nonsense.  But it's too late now.  We have a bunch of morons in Congress and a moron in the White House.

From the big corporate bailouts, to the ridiculous stimulous, and then to national banking.  Where the government controls the banks.  I truly think that if the government did the opposite of what they are instilling upon the people.  Giving less handouts, less money, less welfare, I truly think that the idea would help big businesses fix themselves.  Relying on their own gains or losses, instead of the government holding their hands.  You lose freedoms the more you rely on big government to free you of your debts.  The economy needs to fix itself by bringing in capital, and not having the Federal Reserve print more foolish fiat money.  The dollars value dwindles. The money becomes worth even less, but capitalism goes through a change. A change from capitalism into socialism because everyone relies on the government to keep them satisfied on a regular basis.|`|1f5717dd20b5e0c84f453019e13c20c3aa	Liberals like fantasy more than reality.

This is Obama's spread-the-wealth program in action.<br>  <br>  Team Obama is rewarding bad behavior. It is enlarging moral hazard. It is expanding its welfarist approach to economic policy. And with a huge expansion of government-owned zombie lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Team Obama is taking a giant step toward nationalizing the mortgage market.<br>  <br>   "Government is promoting bad behavior. . . . Do we really want to subsidize the losers' mortgages? This is America! How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor's mortgage? President Obama, are you listening? How about we all stop paying our mortgages! It's a moral hazard."<br>  <br>  We need to  called for a new tea party in support of capitalism.<br>  <br>  Obama's so-called mortgage-rescue plan amounts to $275 billion in new debt that will have little if any lasting impact on deeply corrected housing prices or the mortgage-default problem that stemmed from the insistence of government to throw home loans at lower-income people.<br>  <br>  A modest reduction in mortgage rates will have little impact on home prices. And by the way, re-default rates on modified mortgages have been running 50% to 60%. This is not going to change. So why should we throw more good money after bad?<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, Wall Street is awakening to the disappointment that the securitized mortgages behind the toxic assets that have done so much damage to banks and the credit system are not being treated in the Obama program. The oversight is incredible.<br>  <br>  There are no safe-harbor provisions to protect mortgage servicers against lawsuits if agreements are broken. The ownership of these securitized mortgage pools is wide and far, spanning the globe. Breaking contracts is exceedingly difficult, especially without any legislated legal protection.<br>  <br>  Of course, banks that have whole loans can choose to modify them if they want. And in some cases it's much better to modify than foreclose. But 70% of this bank-owned paper is performing. It's the securitizations that have clogged up the world credit system.<br>  <br>  Then there's the bankruptcy-judge cram-down, which would allow the courts to renegotiate interest rates and loan principal. This would abrogate private contracts and throw out the rule of law. Do we think future investors will put up mortgage capital if they fear judges will overturn the terms of contracts? Home-loan supplies will fall and mortgage rates will rise.<br>  <br>  Then there's Fannie and Freddie, the big winners here. Only their products are eligible for mortgage relief. Jumbo mortgages are not. Neither are private-label mortgages created by various nonbank lenders. Fan and Fred already run 48% of the mortgage market. Obama's proposal would greatly enlarge that and move the mortgage system toward government nationalization.<br>  <br>  What's even more incredible is Team Obama's stubborn refusal to have any faith in the free market. In some of the hardest-hit areas of the country, markets are already solving the housing problem.<br>  <br>  What's more, the unsold-inventory index for existing single-family detached homes in December 2008 was 5.6 months, compared with 13.4 months for the year-ago period. And the median number of days it took to sell a single-family home dropped to 46.1 in December 2008, compared with 66.7 in December 2007.<br>  <br>  So inventories are dropping, the number of days to sell a home is falling, and sales are rising in the wake of lower prices.<br>  <br>  If the government really wants to help, instead of bailing out irresponsible mortgage-holders, it should support new and younger families who want to buy starter homes and begin to climb the ladder of prosperity.<br>  <br>  All this is free-market economics 101. And I say, let free markets work.<br>  <br>  Let's remember that most folks — even those with underwater mortgages, where the loan value is more than the home value — do not walk away from their obligations. They don't want to wreck their credit — and their homes are their castles. That's the American way.<br>  <br>  But if we penalize the good guys and subsidize the bad ones, we are undermining the moral and economic fabric of this country.<br>  <br>  That is Socialism at the greatest height.|`|X8rzrqwxaa	Well if you look back in History Roosevelt did what Obama is doing by trying 1 new thing after another you can;t expect the Economy to fix itself by doing nothing<br>  <br>  P.S. actually the fastest way to get the economy back on track is to spend money on furniture and Tv and not saving it up  because if it just sits in a bank its doing nothing for manufacturing plants and buissnesses in America and promote American Consumerism. and the problem  with Bush's Stimulus package was he did'nt do a proper follw up.|`|kjnj5XEpaa	We are basically there...<br>  you don't buy a car because, lets face it, it sucks.

This forces the centre right (democrats) to concentrate on streamlining and rebalancing the economy, leaves little time or money for more meaningful reforms, and allows the GOP to slag them off as tax and spend and get into power to restart the process.<br>  A better approach would be to feed the money currently fed to the banks and carmakers etc, to the poor and beneficiaries.  These people need to spend what they get and so spark economic activity which flows up the chain while those at the top save it or invest in in a money-go-round which benefits only themselves.<br>  You flourished under a capitalist economy?  It was unbridled capitalism and Bush's tax cuts for the extremely rich cutting income, and criminal wars increasing expenditure and forcing overseas borrowing, which precipitated the current crisis.<br>  The top socio-economic half percent have flourished in the last few decades but everybody else is relatively poorer than in the sixties.<br>  By the way, the US is not a democracy - it is a corporate plutocracy.

If so, the answer is yes!  The military is always, always recruiting doctors.|`|PWvS7vqPaa	If you have ANY ROTC scholarship, no matter the branch, you will have an obligation to that branch of service upon graduation.  Nothing is free and the military is not going to fork over $40-$120,000 for your educaiton and expect nothing in return.<br>  <br>  However, at least in Army ROTC, if you do not have a scholarship, you can only take the first two years without obligation.  Once you begin your third year, you must decide to stay or quit as you are required to contract with ROTC beyond that.  If you contract with them, then you will be required a service obligation afterwards.  If you do not, then you can quit after your second year with no worries.<br>  <br>  In some senior military colleges like A&M they have what is called "The Corps of Cadets."  This includes students taking ROTC as well as those just participating in the Corps.  In short, you can be in the Corps and not be in ROTC, but you can't be in ROTC and not be in the Corps.  All ROTC Cadets at places like A&M are also in the Corps.  If just in the Corps and not ROTC, you assume no obligation to the military upon graduation.|`|jsIjyDEPaa	Yes.

NQGpw0x4aa	you're overreacting. stuff gets broken all of the time. who's to say you didn't hit it with your tooth and chip it. you can't get aids from cutting your own lip with a glass.|`|nfXbqCgZaa	Ok, accidents happen and it appears to me that the restaurant did a lot to try and resolve your complaint.  <br>  <br>  You can sue over anything, but whether or not you will win is up to the Court and the judge.  Usually to win at a lawsuit, you must have some type of injury that the Court can rectify.  You obviously cut your lip, but did you require medical treatment that you paid for?  Did you lose pay because you couldn't work?  <br>  <br>  Without tangible losses, your odds of winning any financial award is astronomical.  Most lawsuits that are filed by pro se plaintiffs are dismissed and to hire an attorney, you are looking at a minimum of $5000 for the attorney to just take your case.  If you file pro se - meaning representing yourself, you will also have to pay filing fees and service fees usually amounting to about $200 or more.<br>  <br>  If you lose the case you could also end up being ordered to pay for the other guys attorney fees.  That could be several hundred or several thousand dollars.<br>  <br>  So, first, yes you can sue, but it will cost between $200 and $5000 just to start.<br>  <br>  So, second, the odds of you contracting any disease let alone HIV / AIDS is astronomical.  Studies have indicated that even if stuck with a needle with HIV infected blood in it, the odds of someone contracting HIV from a needle stick is less than 1 percent.  So, the odds of you contracting anything from a broken bit of glass is, for the lack of a better word, impossible.  Also the HIV virus dies within seconds when exposed to oxygen.<br>  <br>  Third, if you were to encounter some sort of stomach ailment due to the ingestion of glass, then you would certainly have a case.  However, you do not appear to have and your health is not likely going to be compromised.<br>  <br>  So in conclusion, you can sue, I wouldn't advise it as you will end up being out more money than you will likely win.  You can contact the business and ask for them to cover a medical check-up and if HIV worries you so much, you can get an HIV test as well.  Please note though, HIV antibodies can take 6-12 months to show up.  So, a test now will only show that you are free of HIV, if you have HIV now, you got it from somewhere else.  You would then need at least 2 more tests, one at 6 months and one at 12 months.<br>  <br>  -----------------------<br>  <br>  Follow-up, if you lost your job and health insurance, what are you doing going out to eat and going to a hockey game?  Didn't mean to judge, just curious.<br>  <br>  It's hard to say, but if you do need stitches, then you have to get them within the first 12 hours after injury.  More than likely you won't, but you never know.  I personally do not believe you will be entitled to anything other than your medical bills. <br>  <br>  I suggest that you call the business, explain you are still bleeding and want to go to an urgent care / emergency room and expect them to cover your cost of treatment.  It will enable you to see a doctor and it will certainly be a lot quicker and cheaper than trying to sue.|`|AkIgv5WVaa	Well, naturally he was nervous and wanted you out of there.

As long as he is still able to go to and complete his training and thereby fulfilling the first part of his obligation, then he will get the first part of the bonus.  However, filing for bankruptcy could cause a few problems should they decide to delay his shipping out to training and thereby he would be held up and would not receive the first part of his bonus.  But, as long as he eventually fulfills his contract, he will still keep it.|`|433571011989f7699b6947635139e845aa	That will all depend on what the bankruptcy court orders.  If he is ordered to repay portions of the debt, than yes, his bonus could be considered for payment.  Additionally, when you file bankruptcy, they generally ask if you know of any monetary bonuses, inheritances, etc that you can see occurring in the near future..your husband will have to list the bonus as it will fall into that category.  And finally, he will need to be sure the proceedings are completed before he leaves for basic as they will not allow him to take leave during basic and tech school, even to attend court.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Yes,he can lose it to his Creditors...<br>  You know how many times that Scam <br>  has been tried...<br>  <br>  Oh, by the way...if he has any open<br>  Court cases he cannot enlist until<br>  they are taken care of...|`|rfPRc1E1aa	yup

gjMkNCrQaa	Greetings!<br>  <br>  The National Labor Relations Act of the Wagner Act of 1935 was created by Congress to protect workers' right to unionization.  The National Labor Relations Board was created to enforce the National Labor Relations Act.  The NLRB conducts secret-ballot elections to determine whether employees want union representation and also investigates unfair labor practices by employers and unions (Smith, 1998).  The act guarantees un-supervised employees the right to self-organize, choose their own representatives, and bargain collectively or they may choose not to do any of these things.  "The statute guarantees the right of employees to organize and to bargain collectively with their employers or to refrain from all such activity" (Smith, 1998).  This generally applies to all employers involved in interstate commerce other than airlines, railroads, agriculture, and government. The Wagner Act also enforces the national labor policy of assuring free choice and encourages collective bargaining as a means of maintaining industrial peace.  Through the years, Congress has amended the Act and the Board and courts have developed a body of law from the statute (Reynolds, 1979).<br>      The Wagner Act makes it illegal for employers and labor unions to interfere with these rights and establishes the NLRB to hear cases involving unfair labor practices (Anderson, 1979).  "The National Labor Relations Board is an independent agency created by the Wagner Act of 1935 to oversee the laws, investigate and hold hearings on unfair labor practice complaints, take action against employers found guilty of unfair labor practices, and to determine the make-up of individual employee bargaining units, as well as to oversee union certifications" (Anderson, 1979).<br>      The NLRB must also make sure that employers do not discriminate against union members.  There have been cases where companies do not hire someone because they belong to a union or fail to rehire seasonal workers who join unions.  Sometimes employees are laid off because they are in union or the employee is demoted or transferred to a less desirable job or location.  On occasion employees are mistreated because they follow the rules of the union (Smith, 1998).<br>  Labor laws grant employees the right to unionize and prohibits/allows employers and employees to engage in strikes, picketing, and lockouts for the soul purpose of having their demands fulfilled (Anderson, 1979).  Both federal and state statutes, as well as law and judicial decisions govern labor law.  It is also governed by the regulations and decisions of administrative agencies (Anderson, 1979).<br>      There are many laws that affect labor in some way, however The Wagner Act marked the beginning of affirmative support for unionization and collective bargaining by the federal government.  Sections 7 and 8 of the Act established employee rights and the enforcement of those rights.  Section 9 deals with the secret ballot election, and section 10 contains provisions concerning judicial review (Reynolds, 1979).<br>      "The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) of 1935 created an administrative agency called the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)" (Smith, 1998).  The President of the United States with the help of the U.S. Senate appoints five members to the board for five-year terms.  There are over thirty regional offices throughout the United States that report to the board's head office in Washington, D.C.  There is also a general director at each regional office that reports directly to the general council in Washington (Anderson, 1979).<br>      The NLRB regulates the power between labor and management.  This board prohibits management from using unfair labor practices like discouraging union membership.  There should not be any discrimination in the hiring process.  Another duty is to regulate unfair labor practices by labor.  For example, when the labor force refuses to bargain with the management or they have an illegal strike or boycott.  The NLRB has created a sixty-day "cooling off" period before a work stoppage at the end of a collective bargaining agreement.  The board has special powers that they can enforce if there are strikes by the labor union that threaten the security of our nation.  Unions must file financial reports with the NLRB so that they can make sure that the unions are following the laws and regulations that have been established (Smith, 1998).<br>  The current responsibilities of the NLRB include regulating power between labor and management.  The NLRB prohibits management and labor from using unfair labor practices.  The NLRB makes the decision as to whether or not a union can form.  The NLRB acts as a mediator between management and labor, which means that if a disagreement occurs than the NLRB must settle the problem.  Finally, the NLRB has to deal with complaints filed by the employees.<br>  There are certain laws that every group of employees must follow.  In order to form a union every party mus

However most motels/hotels have a number where you can rate their service and make complaints.  These records determine their ratings as a good or poor place to stay, so see what you can find out there.  I would also check into the Better Business Bureau, you may not be the only one who found this establishment less then desired.

Hoover did nothing in response to the market crash in 1929 and it took FDR and the "New Deal" to help our country recover.  The "New Deal" involved nationwide infrastructure projects, and they really did get our economy moving again.  Remember, people who work pay taxes, which helps pay down the debt from these projects.

GrKiEDb1aa	I really never thought about it until I joined the Patriot Guard Riders 3 years ago, and I do it as often as I can.<br>  When ever I go through one of the gates at the many bases here in S.E. Virginia and there's a military person there, after I show my ID I always tell them, "Thank you for serving our country."  One young female sailor got so choked up, she had tears in her eyes and could hardly say 'thank you.'<br>  I walked up to 2 U.S. Marines and one of their ladies at McD's on base and said, "Marines, thank you for serving our country in the world's BEST fighting force," and rendered a salute.  The young lady jumped up and hugged me and thanked me for taking the time to thank her brother and his buddy.<br>  I was on the way back from a Patriot Guard Rider mission and stopped in a supermarket.  As I walked down an isle I came up on a couple.  The guy had a ball cap on with a Viet Nam service ribbon embroidered on the front.  I stuck out my hand and said, "Welcome home, Brother."  He shook my hand and then hugged me.  And with tears in his eyes he said, "Thank you.  No one has ever said that to me."  We exchanged where we had been in Viet Nam, then his wife hugged me and said, "Welcome home, to you, too."  We shook hands again and went on shopping.<br>  I ride a motorcycle most days to work.  I came up on a pick-up with Viet Nam and U.S. Marine insignias on the back window, tail gate, and  bumper.  As I got along side him, I caught his eye, and rendered a sharp salute. He had a big grin and returned the salute.  <br>  Veterans are encouraged to render a salute when ever it would be appropriate as if we were in uniform (raising of the Flag, passing of the Flag, hearing the National Anthem, etc).<br>  Just the other day as I was sitting at a red light, a fella came alongside me on his 'crotch rocket' and I noticed the base sticker on his front fork.  I said, "Hey shipmate! Thank you for serving our country," and gave him a salute.  He flipped up his visor and said, "Thank YOU, shipmate!"<br>  A couple of years ago I had picked up a pair of boots that had been re-soled.  As I was leaving the shop, an older gentleman was entering.  He had a ball cap on that said, "WW2 VET".  I held the door and said, "Sir, thank you for serving our country.'  He grinned and said, "Well, I ain't done yet!"  We're losing our WW2 vets at 1,000 a day.<br>  Believe me, we really appreciate the words.<br>  (USN, retired/in-country Viet Nam combat vet)/proud Patriot Guard Rider)|`|h2KkiKK3aa	do it, really appreciated and it's good that they know people care about what their doing and believe in them, they'll probably sit you down with them and talk about their service and stuff, really entertaining and educational, you'll probably have to pay for their meal though, have some extra money on ya just in case lol.|`|367926de3fa96492022d3fae80bbab42aa	It is definitely ok and greatly appreciated. <br>  <br>  There was one time when I was walking through a parking garage late at night and I was by myself coming back from a military function. I was wearing my dress blues and I saw this group of guys walking through that looked like they were a rough crowd.

Although I was shocked a little that these guys took the time out just to say thanks, I really appreciated hearing it. <br>  <br>  Most people don't join the military to get a pat on the back and none is ever expected but it is definitely good to hear that people are grateful for our service.|`|s5lj3ENhaa	My husband loves it when people say thank you.

tvNkizDraa	A.  And a Pretty good argument for rewriting ARM to fixed rate mortgages based on realistic property values... rather than letting even more homes go into foreclosure.  At least I think that's the point you're making.<br>  <br>  Going with that assumption...<br>  The first half of that bailout has already been spent and it did not unfreeze the credit market so it did not help to stem the foreclosures or help loosen up the credit markket. Basically, the money was funneled to the top and did not 'trickle down' to the root problem areas. <br>   <br>  The foreclosures are at the heart of our declining property values and are gutting our local property tax base. As a result, we have less funds locally for our schools and essential (police, fire protection) services. I don't like any kind of bailout, but if there must be one, I'd rather see it go towards the local community problems than going towards retreats, CEO bonuses and dividends... or institutions that are 'too big to fail' (so we were told) using bailout funds to buy even more troubled assets, making them even bigger and setting themselves (us?) up for future, bigger failure potential.  Here's an interesting article about bailout culture, as it applies to the financial institutions:<br>  <a href="http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/moral-hazard/2008/09/19/what-moral-hazard?page=0,1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/mora...</a>|`|yb4FbFiSaa	I would take the first option and send out a lifeboat.

It doesn't cost me anything but a tad of my time to toss out a life line, and I'm not being placed at risk for harm myself by doing so.  I've also helped the person out of my own sense of good will and kindness.  If money that I earn is taken from me to "save" others and I have no control over what percentage of my income is forcibly taken or who it goes to, my family suffers.  There is no comparison.  <br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is the fact that every consumer is permitted the opportunity to READ what they're signing before they purchase a home.  I've never bought a home without making absolutely certain that I understand the terms of the agreement I'm signing.  I'm also intelligent enough to take out my calculator and decide what I can realistically pay for.  I've been offered as much as 50% more than I knew I could afford when pre-qualifying to purchase a home.  I made a conscious decision, in each case, to stick with the lower priced home that I had concluded I could afford when I made my budget.  Unless someone can prove to me that they have no education whatsoever or that they're mentally retarded, I refuse to believe that anyone is a victim of the evil lending institutions.  They took a gamble and they lost along with the people who loaned them the money.  <br>  <br>  Unemployment?  I've been laid off in the past myself.  Because I had a reasonable mortgage, I was able to work three jobs and survive until I found another one in my field.  It wasn't fun at all, but I never missed a mortgage payment and I was never at risk for losing my home.  If I can do that as a single mother of two, anyone with brain cells who made wise decisions should be able to do the same.  I have zero sympathy.

After years of studying the political and military instabilities of our planet, Vault-Tec analysts have concluded that the odds of worldwide armageddon this decade are 17,143,762... to 1.    Now the good news! The Earth may be destined to die by you don't have to.

So Imagine life in a Vault-Tec vault. Not just future.  A brighter future... underground|`|YkseyT7zaa	Cher and cockroaches would be the only thing left|`|YupMCYHlaa	I grew up during the 1950s when most people thought a nuclear war was inevitable, it was just a matter of time.  I remember when people built fallout shelters, with the idea that if you could stay underground and breathe filtered air for 3 weeks, you'd be fine.  But during that time we were learning more and more about the possible effects of a nuclear war, and so were the Soviets.    My father in law fought in the Korean War, and then participated in nuclear experiments in the deserts of Nevada.  The Army would explode a nuclear device and then have soldiers march into the area as soon as it was 'safe'.  Thousands of those soldiers, including my father in law, developed cancer later in life.  The US Govt. didn't realize then just how dangerous the fallout from a nuclear blast was, how long it hung in the air, how far it blew in the wind.  They began to realize then that the use of nukes in a war was a practical impossibility.  This was the beginning of a sort of unspoken treaty which was later called 'Mutual Assured Destruction'.  Some more honest scientists talked about it openly, though they were sharply criticized as being somehow subversive. I remember Carl Sagan's famous saying that the nuclear arms race was like two people standing in a room, up to their knees in gasoline, arguing about who had more matches.    In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan actually began talking once more about a 'winnable nuclear war'.  There was a lot negative feedback, and he stopped talking about it.    Today, no leader of a nation can envision a scenario whereby he stands to gain anything from the first use of nuclear weapons.  Whoever uses them first becomes a world pariah, and every other nation in the world will gang up against them.  This is why North Korea, China, the USSR, etc. never used them, or the US either, why India and Pakistan haven't used them even though they hate each other's guts.  In fact every nuclear nation has signed a no-first-use agreement, except, of course, the US.  Countries still want them, only to have them as a threat, to protect themselves.  North Korea is a good example, a very small, very weak country that might have been invaded by now by South Korea, which is many times bigger, aided by the US, if not for its nukes.    I suppose a terrorist organization like Al Quaeda might use nukes if they could get their hands on them, because they have nothing to lose.  But it's harder than you might think.

eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	to allow for our gov't to recognize and make effective changes when it is necessary.    its probably the single greatest part of our form of gov't.  It allows for change without revolution.    somehow our constitution was formed with "all men created equal" but not women.  The amendments allow for that to be corrected.|`|6Cp41lb6aa	Because the Founding Fathers recognized that they were not infallible.     They might actually be making a mistake (such as the 3/5 rule), that future generations would be able to correct.    Too bad the amendment process now involves 5 Justices instead of 2/3 of the states.|`|fj6YUwBUaa	To allow the government to evolve with the times.  And to be able to change and fix any problems that the founding fathers didn't know existed after it was written without having to rewrite the whole thing.|`|fa38e842848a4d4d0e66c24701940524aa	First, we have to be clear that the process we are speaking of is that contained in Article 5 of the Constitution.  This requires that any legitimate change has to come from the same source of authority as the original Constitution, and that is to say "The People."  Government in general is not permitted to make these changes on its own, and certainly none of the three branches may do so on their own.      The reason why the process was put in to begin with is related to the phrase in the Preamble "in order to form a more perfect Union," and we should note that the inclusion of the word "more" was deliberate.  Obviously they did not expect to get it perfect on the first try.  What bears consideration is the question of "more perfect than what?" and the answer to that is the Articles of Confederation.      The body that drafted the Constitution wasn't actually called to draft the Constitution.  They were sent to "fix" the Articles of Confederation (which lacked any kind of Amendment process.)  They quickly realized that there was no fixing a number of the problems within the Articles (see "The Federalist Papers") so they decided to start from scratch (which explains why the ratification process was necessary).  To prevent having to re-write whatever they managed to come up with every few years, they understood from the beginning that they needed to include a mechanism to fix any "errors" that they themselves might have put into the new Constitution.     It's actually a cumbersome process to Amend the Constitution.  Their reasoning for making it so was to be a barrier to changes coming on a whim, and yet no barrier to changes that were truly necessary.     It had nothing to do with keeping order or informing the People.  States were largely responsible for keeping order, not the federal government, and they considered "staying informed" an individual responsibility, one that would have little impact given the Constitutional limitation on government authority to impact lives of citizens anyway.|`|AA11702773	As the exclusive means for government to vary from the prescribed actions in the Constitution.    Note that 'legislating from the bench' is not in the Constitution.|`|QPPcUyyyaa	One of the big problems most people had in the 1780's, when they were trying to get the Constitution ratified, was that it didn't have any bill of rights.  It was just the rules for how the government would function.    So, in order to get support for the document (they needed 9 states to approve it before it would pass into effect) the Federalists lobbying for support made a promise: once the constitution was ratified, the first act of congress would be to amend it to include a bill of rights.    Only after this promise was made did the Constitution garner significant support.  And, sure enough, Congress' first act was to draw up the first 10 amendments to the constitution, which we now know as the Bill of Rights.  So you see, the Amendment process was instrumental in making sure that the Constitution as a whole was accepted.
vIHHQX3caa	No--the republicans are a bunch of sore babies that want to see the country fail. They don't have a plan other than cutting taxes for their rich bloated friends.|`|ScZPVCUpaa	So typical, how they trivialize and misrepresent the truth.<br>  They have no plan.<br>  No clue.<br>  No ideas.<br>  Just hate.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Yes. The Republicans presented their ideas and they were rejected ahead of time. Obama didn't think they would work because that is what his hand picked advisors told him.<br>  <br>  I don't hate Obama. I know he is only doing what he thinks he needs to do, but he is getting bad advice from people who are just in it for themselves...not this country. Those same people put the pork into the bill and will continue porking it up until the U.S. goes bankrupt unless we do something about it. I don't care what party my representative comes from...as long as he is representing me.

There was a recession/small depression in 1920 as bad as what we've got today. By the time Harding realized what was going on and thought about doing something, the economy had corrected itself. But in 1929, when there was another dip, Hoover started mucking about and caused the Great Depression.<br>  <br>  The US stayed in a depression long after the rest of the world had recovered, thanks to Hoover and FDR, who made the crisis even worse.|`|QEYFU5Lvaa	Actually Hoover was widely criticized for NOT intervening while the Depression was picking up steam.

Moreover, there are lots of other countries in the world which don't spend as much on social programs and they are not living in feudal systems. <br>  Social spending isn't a check and balance system on the rich. What makes our capitalist system different from feudalism is the protection we have under the law. The most important of which maybe the ability to leave our jobs and go and do something else (or nothing at all). Feudalism is a archaic systems where people had very little rights and very little control over their own lives once the became indebted to the feudal land owners.|`|Dqk3uuwzaa	You have it backwards, it is liberalism/socialism that will lead to feudalism.<br>  <br>  You are a serf and you don't even know it.|`|620L80L0aa	This is why we need to all be Libertarians.|`|TfpeYyuwaa	Basically. They would be lords and everyone would be their serfs tending their land trying to survive and sent off to war for the lord when another one pissed him off|`|6nS62bB8aa	Not at all, and I am not being nasty here.<br>  <br>  Conservatism, like Liberalism, has no logical end but instead is under constant evolution.<br>  <br>  And if "they" got their way to destroy all social spending, what would be left are private organizations which would be allowed to fail rather than propped up at tax payer expense.<br>  <br>  And you would be free to rule yourself unchecked. Your taxes might fall to as little as ten percent of your yearly income rather than the current thirty percent. That's when you could start to save for your own retirement, your own education, and your own advancement toward being "wealthy".<br>  <br>  Thank you for this small skirmish of the class warfare, you lost.|`|gau0w8LMaa	No one said to end all social spending just to get control of it.

6OLiuM9Gaa	Usually, "muster" means that you stand in formation and somebody up your chain of command reports that you are present or accounted for, or whatever your status is. That individual reports up to his superior, etc. until the CO or whomever knows that everybody in his/her command is accounted for. If somebody doesn't show up, he or she is UA... at least.    Sometimes "muster" is a sign-in sheet. Sometimes it's simply a phone call saying, "I'm Petty Officer Smithers reporting on station."    The idea is to make sure everybody's where they're supposed to be, and to know who's missing. At sea, that can be pretty important.|`|AA10465540	Roll call basically.

He only cares about himself.|`|it2UVkF4aa	Next question.|`|zejFr1Ciaa	Do you really think he did it voluntarily? When the stuff hit the fan I'll bet he had no choice in the matter.
BIQrsl4paa	I would have to say "yes". As recently as JFK, even the liberals expected companies and individuals to support themselves. It has only become fashionable, for lack of a better word, for the Democrats to provide cradle to grave assistance for individuals and economic aid to ailing corporations, during the last 30 years, or so.<br>  However, to be fair, aid to companies has also been given by the Republicans.|`|AA11819105	Yes the last Democrat President was JFK|`|fBvhkalFaa	Has a Republican President ever opposed corporate welfare?

AA10118655	I'm not understanding why him being on probation is an issue. He is going in for medical tests, and it is very unlikely that he is prohibited from receiving medical care while on probation.    As for the mother finding out, a lot of places have laws about parents getting information on their child's medical care. Where I live, a minor over the age of 12 has the right of privacy with his/her doctor when related to sexual matters (STDs pregnancy, birth control, etc.).     Of course, if he will be having it done under his mother's insurance, she will find out (the insurance company will send the normal statement of what procedures were covered to the parents). He can get around this by either paying for the entire thing out of pocket, or going to a free clinic.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Since he is on probation, he should just shut his mouth and, get it done.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	16 year old boyfriend on probation, with a possible STD.

Dont be dumb go to a free clinic and get the test done|`|6JXrlnYsaa	Probation has nothing to do with it.  He has the legal right to privacy in the doctor's office, even at 16.  He should tell the doctor he wants his privacy.  The doctor will have the mother leave the room.

To me this was being too greedy and prideful... Avarice and Pride are included in the Seven Deadly Sins... And all the while, my brother and his wife behaved as our superiors...

AA12109395	Its called "indeterminate sentencing" and it where the judge sets the sentence, then a parole board or commission determines what part of the sentence will be served. However, once sentence is served and parole is commenced, any violation mandates that the offender serves more time up to a maximum of the original life sentence.|`|DZzBfzVeaa	Here in America in most states the Life sentence is 35 years!|`|Re9Pdfxbaa	It is called Life sentence because he can be held in prison for the rest of his life. The 11 years is the Tariff set by the judge which means the least time he must serve. When he reaches 11 years he is considered for parole, if he has not reduced his level of risk, i/e, if he is still a danger to society then he will not be released. All Life Sentence prisoners stay on "Life Licence" til the day they die. If they break the conditions of the licence they go straight back to prison, no court case . All "lifers" are regularly assessed in prison many serve longer than their tariff date. tariff dates are decided by the judge who hears the trial and reports so, a Terrorist would get a life sentence for murder but because of his risk to society would get a 25/35 year tariff. The judge hears all the facts of the case  and bases his tariff date on this.But it is all about RISK TO SOCIETY.  Drunken yobs who like to go around assaulting people  can get whats called "TWO STRIKES"  SHORT TARIFF LIFE SENTENCES. This means because they are a menace to society they get a life sentence with a tariff of 4 to 6 years many do a lot longer in jail because they do not change and therefore are still a risk to society.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Do you have a link to that particular case.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying you're wrong, but I would think he would have been charged as an adult for such a serious crime.  If charged as an adult, getting life in prison would require a minimum of 25 years, all with good behavior for him to get parole.<br>  <br>  <br>  Getting only 11 years would suggest he was charged as a juvenile.  I am rather surprised by that, and I wonder if a link might provide the info needed to figure out why he was charged as a juvenile.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Add-on:<br>  <br>  Thanks for the link.

If any lifer is released it is on licence, and he can in fact be recalled to prison at any time for the rest of his life.  The judge has said that he won't even be considered for release on licence for 11 years<br>  <br>  However, I know what you mean. The only consolation I have is that 11 years is a hell of a long time when you're 16, and at least we won't have to pay to keep the nasty little scrote in prison beyond that.|`|HP1pToMOaa	As Bardic says, a life sentence is for the rest of his life. Once released if he offends again he will go straight to prison to serve more time.

They don't realize it reflects on them, not the object of their disrespect.|`|9npIzlHKaa	Maybe they really can't pronounce "president" like Bush couldn't pronounce "nuclear"?|`|r6JskEtxaa	Well I didn't catch the first part but no|`|CBx6qHztaa	Chimp, Dumbya and on and on....   What now?|`|m0muVAXfaa	I've said it before and it is still true. While it is true not all conservatives are stupid, It is also true most stupid people are conservative. Stupid people have a poor vocabulary and lack basic language skills.|`|651a651e9e9b67965456fb9edd123aafaa	If you are talking about this site? <br>  "president" is more words to type.. Everybody knows he's the president..<br>  <br>  I've never typed that before Bush.. Why should I expect Republicans to type it before Obama?|`|3GHXk05saa	And everyone ALWAYS used 'President' before 'Bush'. Were you upset about it then?|`|trMsK86jaa	Obviously you've been studying orator abilities.<br>  <br>  Good.|`|NTR6LnZSaa	bespeaks hunh...methinks i need a thesaurus|`|620L80L0aa	I almost agree, but do you say the same thing to the Bush detractors.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	I don't call everyone by the appropriate title all the time. I leave out Dr. ; Mr. ; Mrs. ; Sir, all the time... It is more the casual nature of language these days.|`|de711i5Vaa	I say "President Pelosi" all the time.
ioCiw5zlaa	Agreed!<br>  <br>  People have been brainwashed into pitying the DOW. The only validity is we have been conned into having our retirement funds fund the Market for the hyper-rich to make money off of.|`|xo7Ea5fZaa	The market sets the price for everything we buy.<br>  Oil sells for about 35 dollars a barrel right now.<br>  When it was at 140 dollars a barrel, we paid twice as much at the gas station.<br>  That increased the price of every manufactured item we buy.<br>  If you are not invested in any particular industry, you would only feel the bite when you went to buy the items you use.<br>  We have a market based economy.  If the price of gas, water, taxes, or labor increases, we have to make up the difference.|`|a6k5WZxGaa	It is a major factor in our economy. And, yes, people have learned to react to its every move... in a very Pavlovian way.|`|ntuJzqycaa	Cool - that means the Depression wont hit until 2011.<br>  <br>  I've got plenty of time to stock up!|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	Because the stock market is a snapshot of industry -- computers, healthcare, cars, food, clothing, etc.  If the stock market isn't doing well one day, that's nothing to worry about.  If it's not doing well for weeks and months, that tells you something is wrong in the business sector, which BTW happens to employ millions of people.  A company's stock doesn't dive to less than half of what it was last week without there being a reason.  You think you would have nothing to gain if the market rose a great deal in one day and while that may be true, you would definitely have something to gain if the market rose every day for months and then stayed at those levels.  What that would mean is that businesses are doing well and people are being employed and jobs are being created.<br>  <br>  It's like say you have a headache one day.  No problem, right?  The next day everything is fine again and you've suffered no ill effects, so your life goes on.  But say you have a headache every day for a month or two.  Now you could just keep taking aspirin every single day and deal with it, but most people would want to know why they are experiencing a headache every day.  Do they have some kind of brain tumor?  Are they having sinus problems, vision problems, high blood pressure?  Could they be gearing up for a stroke?  In this case, having a headache every day is not the main problem.  It's a SIGN that there is a bigger problem that needs to be diagnosed and treated before it gets worse.  <br>  <br>  That's how it is with the stock market.  Day after day after day of stocks falling is a SIGN that there is a bigger problem that is not being addressed.  Your statement that the Depression actually began three years after the market crashed in 1929 makes perfect sense in that light.  Just like with the headache analogy, let's say you do have a brain tumor that you either don't know about and/or do nothing about.  Do you think that tumor would just stay there, not growing?  No.  Eventually, you would begin to lose other functions until you died.  It wouldn't happen overnight though.  It might take a few years, but it will lead to disaster if left untreated.  That's the same way with the economy.|`|620L80L0aa	They are confused I am sorry to say.<br>  <br>  When we refer to the market it is not the stock market of the DOW.  It is the total value and trade of all the goods in the country.  Now if that increased I bet you would notice.  <br>  <br>  I can make it easy, the stock market sometimes is but is not always a reflection of our whole market economy.<br>  <br>  I hope this explains it for you.|`|NTR6LnZSaa	the "market" that you may/or may not want to demonize,provides you with everything you want need and desire.|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	I agree with you. The media seems to make such a big deal of wall street. What I find interesting is that when really bad news comes along wall street has one of their better days. Interesting
2a48fdc514a71a7ec08cb137b00a0443aa	Because he will play ball with Obama and Pelosi.    It is more important to have a team player, then to have someone that actually knows what is going on.    Or they got some dirt on him, and Obama can make him dance whenever he wants.|`|N3S9S1joaa	If they eliminated all those that cheat on their taxes....who would the find for the job?|`|AA11988604	because they think he can do the job, and they think he hired a less than perfect accountant, more so than being an actual tax cheat.|`|JKtw7nFMaa	because just about everyone on capitol hill is, he just happened to get caught|`|4efdc5368b23398e691a290a96c0937baa	Love the irony.  a tax cheat is good enough to be head of the IRS, but not health and human services|`|D69XI2LLaa	Because he has too much dirt on them!|`|CM3wR8upaa	Because Billy said"i did not have sex with that woman"|`|5yuZwOLQaa	It is questionable whether he meant to cheat.  I am conservative, by the way, and I do wonder how Obama picked so many to run the government that have tax issues.  I'm glad Daschle stepped down ( I was deeply troubled over his nomination)|`|RstCnGL2aa	Because they underestimated the outrage that fly-over America could muster. I sent letters to my representatives as well as Obama this morning expressing my concern over the matter. If I was one of many, then maybe that's what was happening.|`|fj6YUwBUaa	Party Loyalty.|`|eFhk1HB8aa	because they dont pay taxes,its only for the peons silly,|`|G2auAv1Saa	Because he was really really sorry and it was a mistake any ole guy could make     (uh-no not for the guy who is best qualified in the country to run the finances)|`|LzPhdri5aa	Because they approved Alberto Gonzalez and the next guy, knowing that they wouldn't admit that waterboarding is torture.|`|oHrqbdydaa	Because everyone, including you, cheats on taxes.|`|AA10187742	In my opinion, sickening.  I have no idea, but I do believe these tax cheats s hould never be working in our Government.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	Why you conservatives really like scandals, where were you when Bush was tearing up the bill of rights, wasn't that a scandal to you.|`|0nZHAaQDaa	those who did the approving need favors from Obama or since Geithner now controls the IRS a little tax evading is in the works for themselves|`|HGIuXxnRaa	Because most Democrats are hypocrites. Don't we all see that by now?|`|fDuCamMraa	It is commonly called "honor among thieves".|`|eqDXoCeTaa	Because they don't care.  A perfect example is William Aires (ex terrorist) is teaching our children.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Democrats are hypocrites.|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	Super-conservative Republican Senator Orren Hatch agreed that Geithner should be seated.

They said this phrase several times.|`|53216puqaa	He is now in a perfect place to quash any further investigations that may lead to criminal indictments for senior Dems.|`|nr96BgWfaa	they need him to 'create' a surplus.
7WpXJtqCaa	I think he is from the Moon, he looks like a cheese ball to me!    One that Pic you are talking about he looks like one of Americas most wanted....  like those posters they have in the post office!|`|MVLnWyTraa	He is Pakistani Hindu.....  he is not at all black!    The problem is that he was involved in some terrorist scandal, in the Clinton days!|`|eulMjLtPaa	He was born in the Bronx.  His family tree is from Barbados.|`|TKbYavhzaa	He's African-American.  His grandparents are from Barbados, but he was raised in New York City.|`|it2UVkF4aa	He's from Anartica.|`|dfo8gSaraa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Holder    African American, parents are from Barbados.    Sorry that he doesn't 'look' American enough for you.|`|3MM64geHaa	he is black. He did pardon a terrorist, though!|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	He is, like Obama, kinda sorta a black dude.  Holder is a big friend to terrorists, having helped to secure pardons for Puerto Rican terrorists at the end of the BJ Clinton administration.  This helped BJ's wife get elected to the senate.|`|7jNYqtWOaa	His nationality is American.  He has to be to be in Congress.|`|eGsNFUeiaa	He's black|`|kHx1upOpaa	so now america is going to redefine what blackness is when they come into power.|`|7JPKmprjaa	There is certainly a similarity.
7JPKmprjaa	I wish we could say strike three to the monsters.    What I find so disgusting is the fact that this whole organization was started by a daughter of the KKK.  So many don't even realize that its true purpose was to help speed up the slaughter of minorities.|`|EMWrT6imaa	The Party of Death (aka Democrat Party) will just find another barbarian with no conscience to carry on the American Holocaust called abortion with tax payer money.|`|sLEdPDkHaa	i feel better knowing "puff" Daschle is out, he is a clown|`|oHrqbdydaa	You need to read law books and biology books, neither of which seems to agree with your ideas.

HGIuXxnRaa	Obama is a fool for his picks. He has more people under scrutiny then I have ever seen. I am disgusted that he would even think to pick people like this to "change" our country. It just goes to show the kind of people we are supposed to help. Its ridiculous. And people criticize saying only Republican elitists help each other out. What is this when Obama wants to do something for someone like that?|`|fDuCamMraa	The "great and powerful one" is just like the wizzard of oz. An illusion.    Actually a great con artiest since he isn't even legal and, some question if, like his aunt, he's not even in the country illegally.|`|NIHXUmN1aa	The Bama, aka stuffed shirt has no idea what he is doing, he just makes speeches just like the campaign, even though they are rooted in mistruths...|`|OLCnQkmBaa	Obama has shown nothing but poor judgment.  Have you read Obama's brilliant conversation at the Alfalfa Dinner.  Hopefully Obama will not talk to other Heads of State Obama is to immature.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	No.  Daschle removed himself because he doesn't want to remain a distraction and talking point for the Republican attacks.  The country is in serious economic trouble and his appointment is all that some were talking about. I would like to see the Republican legislators have their taxes examined in such detail.  I don't think they would fare anywhere near as well as Obama's appointees.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	Why you conservatives really like scandals, where were you when Bush was tearing up the bill of rights, wasn't that a scandal to you.|`|de711i5Vaa	New Change and Transparency..I seem to have heard that before?|`|qAL0CZIiaa	Of course. I don't think we should completely condemn his presidency based on this though.    He better get his act together.|`|AA12203329	Well he wanted to make history and it looks to me like he's headed down the right road....Where's the change Mr. President..looks to me like your handing the keys to all the Clinton comrades...that's not change !|`|AA12071655	I think it reflects poorly on you that you are willing to jump all over Obama for his decisions but say not a word about the actions of Republicans.    Personally I feel Cheney, Rice and Bush all need to brought up on charges of war-mongering and lying under oath (all public officials swear an oath when they take office). How about you make comments about that instead of inventing issues?
CpTQagJOaa	sounds like maybe sneak some more pork into the bill to try to get some of those things you couldn't before, so use the crisis to try to add some of them in while you're at it.|`|33ppbrMJaa	Doesn't he explain what he means?  A serious crisis is a real challenge. It is an opportunity to do things you have never done before.  <br>  <br>  Every one of us will be faced with serious challenges in our lives.  To cave in, to buckle, to sit around and moan is not the way to face them. You have to find a determination to overcome these obstacles.  You will find the strength to fight your problems in a way that you never have done before.<br>  <br>  As President, Obama faces burdens no President has ever faced before. As he goes into office, there is a war, a huge economic crisis, prisoners that have sat for five years or more imprisoned without charges, partisan politicians, lack of jobs, health care....and the list goes on.  <br>  <br>  Rahm Emmanuel meant that they will not waste one minute to find solutions to these problems.  Good for him!|`|mdHqr17kaa	he is repeating brzezinski I think, tavestock institute <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4AuN6pN1kY&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4AuN6pN1...</a>|`|eqDXoCeTaa	That means exactly to take advantage/control of the American people when they're at their weakest point.<br>  <br>  Anyone ever think the Dems in office want to break us down the furthest so everyone will buy in to their solutions.....<br>  <br>  I hope not........|`|nr96BgWfaa	that he's a sleazebag with an open eye toward screwing us.<br>  <br>  screwing us all!|`|CSbSQfYHaa	You're hoping that I say it proves Emmanuel to be an evil, crisis generating man. Actually, what it means is that if a crisis is going to occur, then at least use the public concern to create support for much needed change.<br>  <br>  There's not much to interpret; it is a fairly straightforward statement -- that is, unless you're trying desperately to discredit Rahm Emmanuel.|`|RRTDRSw1aa	Pick  their pockets while they are confused and shocked. Reminds me of a cattle stampede. The best time to gouge them is when they are confused and alarmed.<br>  <br>  Those are the words of an opportunist looking for a good opening to take advantage of dumb voters. They are just mushrooms so keep them in the dark and throw them some bull sheet. <br>  <br>  Smart, amoral (or immoral) people always depend on the naivetee of the sheeple. Just like herding livestock into the slaugherhouse.<br>  <br>  Maybe Emanuel is a natural-born butcher.|`|RsDZu7iNaa	Pure politics. It's just that simple. Obama had a catchy phrase, all the hype and what not. Meanwhile, Obama was recruited by the leftist powers that be, to be their front man to push start the liberal genesis. Aside some areas where Job's, temporary or time limiting jobs, will be created. So after the highways and what not repair up grades are done, what then? They may put up tolling booths, But wouldn't that just hurt the majority even more so? Most are scraping by, many out of work. I just don't see much stimulus in that. The left ceased the state of mind. In a time of great uncertainty. Words of hope, and change, won over so many. A glimpse of a new chapter, is very appealing...the weak minded sheeple followed. They ( the left ) do see the opportunity to push their hard left agenda forward, having majorities in both the House and Senate. Obama is a tool, a puppet....who is this guy, no real political experience and wham...our first "BLACK" president. The ties Obama has with let's just say "Questionable" characters.... you know I am not even going to let it get to me... the point, here is the basic leftist game plan... Open boarders, blanket amnesty, promised entitlements will draw a substantial increase that could wipe out the two party system, and they intend to do so.|`|SkWzsnuxaa	I like the answers better than the questions. Putting quotes signs around something doesn't make it a true quote. But realistically Rahm is being truthful. He has an agenda he wants pushed and he is willing to use whatever opportunity arises to push it. Did we use PH to get into WWII?|`|AA11086243	like it or not... <br>  <br>  great things often come out of negative events... <br>  <br>  they are times of great change...<br>  <br>  you can recognize them as an opportunity to improve... <br>  <br>  or ignore the opportunity...<br>  <br>  it doesn't sound pretty... but it's true...<br>  <br>  you don't think Reagan wasn't thinking the same thing after Carter's mess?|`|pM81f5tnaa	In his second sentence, he explains what he meant in his first sentence.  And I'm pretty sure he's right.  While our country grieved JFK's death, LBJ was able to get the civil rights legislation passed.  The Cold War gave us the motivation to build our space program.|`|7de370467c1bd78c2289f9e195b0bb85aa	IT'S A CHANCE TO SET-UP A SOCIALIST STYLE DICTATORSHIP UNDER THE DEMOCRATS & B. HUSSEIN OBAMA.|`|Ga3lCQTNaa	What law of the plains said, totally agree.|`|EKRUq112aa	Rahm Emanuel is the dem version of Karl Rove. Nothing more than a<br>  little wind up attack puke. If you haven't noticed all of Obamas cabinet<br>  people and staff people are short, Not tall at all. What does this tell you<br>  about Obama. He has Emanuel running around sinking his fangs into<br>  anything and everything, Hoping to draw blood. I swear they have a <br>  casket in a dark corner of the Outhouse so Emanuel has a place to<br>  stay while its light outside. Emanuel simply means he will will smile<br>  out of one side of his mouth, and rip your heart out with the other,<br>  Don't trust him or Obama. They are tag teaming the country into<br>  oblivion.|`|651a651e9e9b67965456fb9edd123aafaa	Interpret the quote you placed? <br>  <br>  I'd think he'd want to put in programs that he could, because people would agree at the time. Where otherwise, they'd disagree..|`|b17e71d85e289323782f308374bc9642aa	It means that changes are more easily brought about during a period of crisis, for better or for worse.|`|58pYf74Vaa	It means that he a shameless opportunistic little prick.<br>  <br>  Just the kind of right hand man we should expect from president Buckwheat.|`|e2tE6EI8aa	SOCIALISM.....you would need fear and kayos for people to accept it.....hmmm sound familiar.|`|HCrDeJycaa	screw um,,,the people that is|`|ERGGLvYiaa	Dems...their chalice is always half full. *Vomit*
CdBdP2ymaa	Well this is new and different..He paid all the back taxes so he could play.  This is a pay and NO play!  LMAO|`|DBIKou8faa	I'm glad he withdrew. He did pay the taxes he owed, but the gesture was too little too late.  Good.|`|mBZU9a1Baa	Probably not. He'll get the tax cheat head of the IRS - Geithner - to waive everything for him.    Birds of a feather, don't you know. Big question is whether or not Charlie Wrangle will resign and/or finally pay his taxes!|`|62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	WRONG. He already paid. Last month, Daschle paid $128,203 in back taxes and $11,964 in interest.    His withdrawal was about confidence in him at that position.|`|4TT8lSgwaa	I don't think so.|`|DEaIiT79aa	I bet he feels like an idiot.  He had to pay all those taxes he avoided for all these years and STILL didn't get the seat!

Furthermore, the Senate should never have confirmed the nomination.   When are Americans going to say we've had enough of business as usual in D.C.?
xXIm13Mcaa	No the Navy is a much smaller force then the Army for example. At this point a high amount of people are wanting to join due to the economy, unfortunatly not alot of people are leaving the service for those same reasons.

After the failed bays of pigs invasion, Castro turned to the USSR for help which lead to the Cuban Missile crisis and closest that the world ever came to nuclear war.|`|TeJWqCL6aa	Next time vote for Batista|`|el8yX5q3aa	another homework question?  there is something called GOOGLE|`|MbssN5dcaa	Melly....

Hahaha...    Actually the answer is this. When JFK became president, he authorized an attack into Cuba with the Bay of Pigs invasion. Look that up and you'll learn more about it. Kennedy wanted to reduce American exposure so he reduced the air support and the invasion failed miserably.    After that Kruschev in the USSR decided Kennedy was weak and saw an opportunity to get missles in Cuba. JFK and Kruschev took the world to the brink of nuclear war, the closest we ever came. Ultimatly Kruschev blinked. JFK looked good but he caused the whole thing with his ineptness at foreign policy.    Being a skilled diplomat matters. Let's hope Obama is better at it than Kennedy    You can watch the movie "13 Days" to learn a little more about the Cuban Missle Crisis.|`|968KfJjqaa	In my opinion they didn't.

They would be calling for the blood of the person nominated, as well as the blood of the President and his family.    We can't forget the insulting name calling and slander of our "intelligence" minds.  It would be a total mess.    I'llll have to go back through some of my answers, but I'll pull some old quotes.    Prior questions, answers, and spews from Bush hater and anti-Republican people.    "Why do Republicans think that behaving like Nazis is acceptable behavior?  Your attitude stinks, your political philosophy stinks, your arrogance stinks. There isn't a single thing about United States Republicans that I respect."  ---Yet, Democrats don't find this question unreasonable, but if someone questions Obama or make this kind of response about Democrats, see what happens.    Information Police, this is not about Bush it is about Obama.  Way to fail to answer the question, but to go with what you said, the burden of proof is now on you to find people who were (past tense) in Bush's administration that had tax problems, or are you just saying that because Obama got questioned?|`|w5oQJpDwaa	Here's what Daschle would say.

By comparison, guns were outlawed in the UK after a (licensed) gun nutter named Thomas Hamilton went to a primary school and blew away 16 teachers & kids. The average gun murder rate in the UK is 60-70 a year. Even if you adjust the stats to account for the USA's roughly five times larger population, that still means you are around THIRTY FIVE TIMES more likely to be shot dead in the USA than you are in Britain.<br>  And spare me the bollocks about knife crime being bad in Britain. There are an average of 16000 knife murders annually in the USA, compared with an average of 250-300 in the UK, meaning you are at least ten times more likely to be stabbed to death in the USA. The simple fact is that people in the USA have a tendency to kill eachother that is simply not present in other developed nations. Taking guns away from them is a small step in making it more difficult for them to rub eachother out.<br>  <br>  The defence rests.|`|NktvqJhlaa	"CHICAGO – Three teenagers, including a 13-year-old, were killed Friday in a shooting on Chicago's South Side that authorities believe involved an assault rifle.

The UK has extremely strict gun control laws yet one of the highest gun crime rates in the world. Gun crimes committed in the UK surged after they banned most types of firearms. <br>  <br>  Banning guns just removes the weapons from the hands of law abiding citizens. Criminals will just get the weapons on the black market.

If someone doesn't put a value on human life, no amount of legislating will stop them from finding a way to kill you. No amount of gun control will stop criminals from obtaining a firearm, even if they've gotta make them themselves. Besides, with as fat as our nation is getting through fast foods & lack of exercise, we're killing ourselves off without firing a single shot. Who do we arrest for that crime?

Then the case can be filed in federal court.|`|nbibIzC5aa	I think the answer is (B) because it states that the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction when "all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a PARTY[.]"    (A) How the case originates will determine if the Supreme Court has jurisdiction.    (C) The type of penalties falls under their subject matter jurisdiction as the Supreme Court is an appellate court.

AA11586606	No, you can't just get jump wings on your time.  <br>  <br>  Jump school is at Ft Benning Georgia not at Ft. Bragg, NC<br>  <br>  Gold wings do not signify a combat jump.  <br>  The Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia (formally known as the Naval Parachutist Insignia) is a gold embroidered or gold metal winged pin with a gold open parachute in the center. Enlisted personnel and officers are authorized for those members who have previously qualified for the Basic Parachutist Insignia, and have, under competent orders, completed a minimum of five additional static-line or P3 jumps.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Jump School Students<br>  The vast majority of students at Airborne School come from the U.S. Army. These include soldiers on assignment to the 82nd Airborne Division, XVIII Airborne Corps,4th BCT 25th Infantry Division, 173rd Airborne BCT, 75th Ranger Regiment, or the Special Forces Qualification Course. Summer classes are frequently made up of substantial numbers of cadets from ROTC and West Point. Excess seats go to other personnel at Fort Benning on assignment to Officer Candidate School or the Officer Basic Course. The United States Parachutist Badge (also commonly referred to as "Jump Wings") is awarded to U.S. Armed Forces personnel upon completion of Airborne School regardless of branch or MOS.<br>  <br>  <br>  The United States Navy and Marine Corps issue parachutist insignia in two degrees: Basic Parachustist Insignia and Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist Insignia. Parachutist insignia is available to personnel who perform jumps as a:<br>  <br>  Static-Line Parachute Jumper, <br>  Military Free-Fall Parachute Jumper, and <br>  High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) Parachute Jumper (used for premeditated personnel parachute (P3) operations) <br>  Training is accomplished by successful completion of the prescribed course of instruction while attending the:<br>  <br>  U.S. Army Basic Airborne Course, <br>  U.S. Army Basic Military Free-Fall Parachutist Course, or <br>  other training certified by Chief of Naval Education and Training (CNET) or approved by the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO).|`|OBnNGcfHaa	It is very hard to get your jump wings and even harder to get your gold wings. The difference between the two is the amount and types of jumps you do. Gold means that you are a jump master and that takes years. The only women I know that get their jump wings in the Marine Corps are the parachute packers. You go to jump school at Ft. Bragg with the army and then finish MOS school at Ft. Lee VA. It is possible just to go to jump school but not likely. Sometimes they give you the opinion of special school when you re-enlist as a bonus. But you will almost certainly never get gold wings unless jumping is involved in your primary MOS.<br>  <br>  Edit- Ft. Benning my bad! But regardless of that Airborne and Air Delivery (0405/0451), i.e., Parachute Rigger attends MOS  school at Ft. Lee Va<br>  <a href="http://www.quartermaster.army.mil/marines/marines_main.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.quartermaster.army.mil/marine...</a><br>  <br>  These are the ONLY MOS's that Females can do with in the Marine Corps that relates to jumping. <br>  In addition to that the Marine Corps is allotted so many boat spaces a year with in the Fleet Marine Corps for Airborne School. Head Quarters Marine Corps may allocate those spaces as they see it with in the fleet. Airborne School can be authorized as a re-enlistment bonus though HQ if there are additional boat spaces and the Marine attains recommendation from their battalion commander or Equivalent. It rare but has been done.|`|Rv7guqX4aa	wish i knew, i love the marines, both men and women marines|`|0szdPqI0aa	Sorry to tell you this, the marine do not have airborne units.<br>  Only the army.<br>  <br>  so you cannot go to jump school as a marine.<br>  <br>  only in the Army you can.<br>  <br>  You can go to jump school in the marines if your in marine special ops.<br>  <br>  but you would only be able to go airborne in the Army.|`|AA11313983	In the Marine Corps you have to have a specific reason to get sent to Airborne School.  Gold wings indicate a combat jump; they don't come around too often.

McCain was just a poser who openly cheered and touted himself at a hero based on one event in his life. <br>  <br>  <br>  You know what, for the next election if the Republicans push Ron Paul they might have a chance to steal the White House from Obama. If Ron Paul ran as the Republican candidate even I would consider him just for change.|`|fBvhkalFaa	Thanks for the opinion.

n2oEhdZiaa	You will be elligible for a small number of MOS's such as health care specialist or admin.  <br>  <br>  The only way I have ever seen a colorblind soldier get into combat arms was a kid who enlisted admin, deployed to Iraq with the Cav, and then was authorized to go to a 19D course after the deployment.  This was in the Guard though, I don't know if the active army is so generous. <br>  <br>  YOur best bet is to go healthcare specialist and hope you get assigned to an Infantry battalion as a medic.

7113d2ecd54bd8e6d4704f58cb73decbaa	Hi, <br>  I think you have posted similar qs yesterday but this one is with more details.<br>  <br>  1) You can renew passport in Dehradun (although it was issued in Delhi). There will be no issues.<br>  <br>  2) Property Docs is NOT a Valid Proof. <br>  Bank passbook (with records for the past one year) and Valid License (if it is in the current address - Haridwar) are VALID ... but you need one more say PAN Card (although no address will be present in Pan card ... it is accepted) or Voters ID is a VALID Proof.<br>  <br>  To be very clear Passport officers now accepts only these following as address proof - Ration Card, Voters ID, Driving License, PAN card, Bank Passbook and last one is Community certificate.<br>  <br>  (3 out of these 6 must be submitted)<br>  <br>  (It will be strange because Community cert; PAN card - both doesn't contain Address but still it is accepted ... you accept or don't accept this is the reality).<br>  <br>  3) Customer Care: Nobody will pick the phone ... I'm sure about that. Even if you go directly you will get a step mother response only. But, what else can we do .... we want our work to be done.<br>  <br>  4) You will get passport in 5 - 7 days ... but kindly register well in advance through Passport website.<br>  <br>  According to my knowledge I can suggest you only few things<br>  <br>  * Since it is a renewal you may not have any big trouble<br>  * But see to that you have 3 documents (I think you have 2 properly)<br>  * Register your application online in advance<br>  * If possible walk in at least once to the passport office ... you will get a hands-on exp of the status.

480393beb0bd8d738e3d33a34301d4faaa	A 2LT basically is an administrative job. Generally speaking, they are in command of troops. Specifically speaking, what ever is in their job description.|`|vKxt1i0Faa	Stay out of the way of  senior enlisted folks.|`|SJ11pyCXaa	A short answer to a short question: management.     Each branch will have different skills required. But all Lieutenants manage and lead platoons. I am an Aviation Officer. I fly in addition to performing the administrative and leadership functions of a Lieutenant.    Check http://www.branchorientation.com and you can watch interviews of Lieutenants in each branch talk about what they do.|`|hexzaIGgaa	He/she does whatever his/her MOS entails.    My lowest commissioned rank was O-3 (Psychologist). As an O-3, I saw patients and had limited administrative duties. Upon promotion to O-4, my direct clinical work would've been limited.    EDIT: ...and this answer gets thumbs down why precisely?|`|FsBUKc1vaa	You can look up the list of jobs (MOS's) on the army website.    A 2nd LT is on the bottom rung of the ladder...he is at the mercy of the higher officers    YGG...you know the person asking the question gave you that thumbs now. Apparently she is retarded. We answered her question. THERE ARE TONS OF JOBS HONEY! you want a list or something?  nurse, infantryman, computer specialist, food server, doctor, mechanic, chemical specialist, supply, cavlary, parachute rigger, dentist, etc etc etc etc etc etc|`|sLkYSdoBaa	depends on the job..|`|Ar00Kkgkaa	You will have a basic branch (it's not an MOS) and generally a 2LT is a platoon leader with around 40 people.  Your focus will have a lot of administrative duties to be sure.  However in combat arms you will be out with your troops training or deployed.    Now, let me tell you what you will spend a substantial part of your time doing.  Babysitting!  If you read the questions in this forum you will find tons of teenagers that barely made it out of HS, lied their way in, had legal and drug problems and worse yet got married too young and even worse have kids.    Their lives are a soap opera of problems!  They will go to the field and leave their family at home with no money or ATM card.  Divorce, child abuse and dozens of other personal issues will suck your time away.    I'm sure to get a thumbs down but I was there and lived it as an artillery 2LT.  My worst incident was my platoon SGT killed himself because his wife wanted a divorce.  He drank a gallon of anti freeze.    That's one of many things you will experience as a 2LT!|`|8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	Gosh, what a broad question. It totally depends on what job skill the Army recruited the 2lt for.    I'm a nurse. When I was a 2lt, I did my job as a nurse taking care of patients. Now that I am a Captain, I still do nursing duties but now have more adminstrative/managerial responsibilities for the soldiers in my section/platoon. Pretty soon as I get up in rank, all I'll be doing is managing and/or supervising probably at the company level.    EDIT* Yggdrasil, I gave you a thumbs up...not sure why we are getting thumbs down. Oh well, like I really care.|`|G6yyceAxaa	depends on his or her specific branch assignment.  however I can tell you that about 25% of male lieutenants in the army are sent to infantry units for at least one year. reason being.  infantry units require that each platoon have a second lieutenant (platoon leader) and because there are not enough they are temporary branch assigned.    other than that, they will do whatever their specific branch assignment is, such as transportation, signal, so on and so forth.    PS, honestly, most are clueless, but they really try hard. they normally will have a senior NCO teach them the ropes.|`|AA10845721	nothing!
oAQib10naa	everything goes to the NY apo post office first, so however long it would take for something of yours to get to New York, add about a week to for it to get to Kuwait and distributed.  The mail in Kuwait goes to camp Arifjan and is distributed to the other camps from there, which adds a day.  So figure an average of 7-10 days.     Also, if you choose to insure your mail/packages, keep in mind that the insurance only covers the item to the NY APO, not all the way to Kuwait.|`|FsBUKc1vaa	i think my letters to Iraq took 11 days...|`|qpCUvqq8aa	Average in my experience is 10-12 days|`|NW7SSt2uaa	I suppose a lot would depend on the time of year.  At Xmas time it takes longer but normally I would say that one to two weeks would be the average.  Of course Email can be clocked at hours or at the most a day or so but they're not all that personal.  My wife sends packages to our son and they take about a week so I would say that a letter would be about the same.  I would recommend a bit of perfume on the letter, one that you wear all the time and it will be well received.  Emails are great but Snail Mail is better.  They're something he can actually carry with him and pull out at any time.  Good luck to you.|`|vNlyRmB7aa	It really all depends. My fiance is in Afghanistan...when he first got there, it took exactly one week for a package and several weeks for a letter. My advice, save up your letters and put them in a box...they'll get there faster and have less chance of getting lost in the mail. If the mail is running smoothly thought, hopefully it will only take a week (or less)! :)     PS--Go online and order the military flat rate box package from USPS.com. It's free and they'll deliver flat rate boxes (cheaper to ship overseas) along with tape and labels to your door. Good luck!
hexzaIGgaa	I was enlisted under the old AFSC system, but I was experienced as a Cryptolinguist (Korean) and as a straight Military Intelligence Specialist (worked with the SIOP...and at Task Force Alpha during VietNam).    Cryptolinguist is always a hot field, but the training is VERY long...and it requires a VERY high clearance, as well as an aptitude for foreign languages.    Op. Intel. is a good field...as our HUMINT capabilities are sadly depleted. Good advancement opportunities.|`|4VzVfKvdaa	Since you actually have a DLAB score that's good enough for all the languages...barely, go ahead and shoot for 1N3.  The hot languages of course are Arabic, Farsi, Korean and Chinese which means you will be limited in where you are assigned.  As has already been said, the tech school is very long...depends on the language.  However, just finishing tech school gives you an associates degree right off the bat to build on towards a bachelor's degree.  The clearance you have to obtain is one of the highest in the DoD and gains you a lot of respect, but comes with a lot of responsibility.  That clearance is very valuable after you leave the military as well.|`|AA10845721	1- op intel (1n0x1)  2.network intel analyst    those would be my top 2...them others i dont know...|`|xjb72SOpaa	I'm a 1N4, and currently we are on a path to merge with the 1N0's (briefers) and the 1N6's (phone snitches). The 0's and 6's are already mostly merged. Linguist is the one of the hardest to pass, depending on your language, but it has one of the best SRB's. 1N5's are centered around radars and need to be very proficient in math. 1N2's (Morse Code Ops) are supposedly fading out but that was what we were told 5 years ago in tech school, so who knows. 1N1's are in pretty high demand in the service and in DoD in general. Basically you stare at screens and point out what the blurry images are.     If it were me, knowing what I know now, these would be my top 3:  1N0--- they have a high SRB as well and all they do is brief people, plus they are merging the 4's and 6's to become 0's anyway  1N1--- interesting mission set, but can be redundant depending on where you work  1N4---even if we are being merged, we're essentially the jack of all trades AFSC     Plus, the 3's, 6's and 2's are limited in how many bases they can go to. Best of luck in your choices and hope this helped.
hexzaIGgaa	Telling the truth is not optional...and lying is NEVER justified. It is best to come clean. Withholding information is lying. Lastly, I don't see anything that would automatically DQ you...seizures as an infant might raise some eyebrows, but it is not an instant DQ.    I applaud you for wanting to tell the truth. And, I would like to publicly shame those who told you to do otherwise, either in person or on this board. Once your integrity is gone, it doesn't come back.    EDIT: Did a former recruiter actually just encourage and suborn perjury or the deliberate withholding of information? Please tell me he didn't say that...regardless of how many times he said that it wasn't what he was advising? Man, oh man...sure is different from when I was an NCO and Officer. Tell me Sir, was one of those stars for suborning perjury and encouraging people to withhold relevant information in the name of expediency?    - Yggdrasil, Former USAF SSgt & Captain|`|qyjXWCA0aa	Your worrying way too much bro.  Your recruiter told you to ommit the info because the system would slow you down or maybe not let you in for no good reason.  Yes integrity is important but you'll learn how things work after a few months in.  The recruiter knows the Army better then you so do what he says.  You want to go let everyone know you broke a finger 10 years ago then let them know at meps...they'll just look at you funny and put you on the bus.    I already know the type of troop your going to be...you'll be the guy that raises his hand in basic and rat's out his buddies, thinking your gaining the respect of your drill instructor and doing the right thing by the army.  Meanwhile the DI will have no respect for you and everyone will hate you.    Do yourself a favor, keep your mouth shut, do what your told and dont take yourself so serious.|`|xXIm13Mcaa	Recruiters tell you to"withhold" things for a reason.  When you go to MEPS its their job to find reasons why you are not a qualified recruit, they do their jobs VERY well. If I were you and you want to go with no hassles your best bet is to listen. disclosing those things for example the seizuers are an AWESOME way to get yourself forever DQ'd...But its your career and your choice.|`|MPavjXO6aa	Ok here is the bottom line. You have to weigh what your concience tells you say versus what will disqualify you according to what is in the manual that the CIVILLIAN DOCTOR WHO GETS PAID TO DISQUALIFY APPLICANTS reads the day you take your physical.    Based on your concerns about your medical conditions, I would have no problem as your recruiter with you saying them to the doc. I would also have a reasonable expectation that without documents from your personal physician attesting to the length of injury, treatment or other disposition, that you will incur significant difficulties trying to join. Am I telling you to withhold pertinent information from a competent medical authority? No. I am simply stating what is the reality. You can go to MEPS, have great asvab scores, and then disqualify yourself because you had an instant case of diarreah of the mouth.    If you have concerns still and based on AR-601-210, US Army Recruiting Program, and the Medical Procurement standards for entry to the ARMY, I'd recommend that you get the x-rays, and letters from your physician regarding all your bumps, bruises, cuts and scrapes. The only one of your symptoms that will cause concern is the Seizures. Those can be symptomatic of an underlying disease or undiagnosed illness that you should really get squared away. A lesser recruiter would tell you to keep your mouth shut, but the way I look at it, I wouldnt want to answer the call from your parent on why you with your "condition" were allowed to join, or worse yet died due to that cause.     Its a volunteer Army, and I am happy that you want to join, but you have to think about if what you are about to undertake is truly the path you want to be on. If so, then get your paperwork in order, spell out your concerns to your recruiter, and if he doesnt listen, tell the station commander that you want to work with him personally. If he doesnt want to help, then go to another Army recruiting center. I worked 4 years as a non-career detailed recruiter, and earned the second hightest incentive award in only 3 years. And I did this in the San Francisco Bay area- The toughest recruiting market in the nation. you might say I've sold ice to eskimos...|`|378161a161ce8b1460b92ef6619f0c5baa	Stupid civilians. You're getting all butthurt over nothing.     Google "fraudulent enlistement news stories"    Yea. Not many come up, and the ones to do are because someone tried hiding a felony.|`|AtWZqe7uaa	first off good for you for having the integrity to bring this up. however you will find that 75% of the people in the military lied about something at meps. as for the core values well lets just say most people treat them like suggestions rather than values. but these are all minor injuries that dont affect you at all now so theyre not going to require a waiver. when the army says "have you ever been hospitalized or treated for serios injuries?" they mean things that require surjery or that require major treatment such as torn ligaments or separated shoulders ect. sprains, hyper extenions and even minor fractures arent   that big a deal. if you tell meps they will just do another psyical if anything since these are very old and not serious   injuries. that will possibly affect your ship date. in my opinion dont worry about it.    thank for your service and having the balls to join the army and not the "chairforce"during wartime.|`|VbSR0HNcaa	There is a difference between integrity and unneeded disclosure.    Offering those event to MEPS guys will make your life miserable for a while. The recruiter is right here.|`|eN8txEaNaa	yes one of the key values is Integrity and the recruiter should have enough integrity about that and told u not to lie you would of had to get more x-rays at MEPS but it would of been fine because my recruiter told me to lie about my broken wrists and when i went to MEPS i told them anyways all i got was some x-rays to see if I was fine.
8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	Um, that would be bad.    EDIT* Sounds like you got discharged (probably a dishonorable, or other than honorable). Not good.

AA10123414	Depends on a few things:  1. Was she eligible for FMLA?  2. Was she out on FMLA?  3. Did she return to work on or before her FMLA approved leave expired?  4. Did she call each week to check to see if she was on the schedule?    If she was not on FMLA either due to ineligibility or failing to apply, they don't have to hold the job for her.    If she did not call to check to see if she was on the schedule, she did not exercise due diligence to verify her schedule.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	You can be "let go" at any time and they don't have to give you a reason. This is why companies form unions. I used to watch my employer squeeze people out of the schedule, just cut them back, up someone else until they are no longer on it at all. They did without your mother for almost 4 months they figure they don't need her, they'll just hire someone else and pay them less.|`|62998c1eb5a3f349422d1d49f36b44e8aa	Most employment in the US is "at will."

And it doesn't have to be on paper. If they told her she would be called back, that is a verbal contract. She should contact the nearest labor board and file a "wrongful discharge" complaint. No, it's not right.
XtQbPiD1aa	Unions are encouraged under a socialist government.  Some may say that they are a socialist movement.|`|ayhDyb16aa	Sure unions are inherintley socialistic and communistic.

AA10709853	generally speaking the Marines do not offer bonuses at all.      as for how bonuses are paid out, that really depends on what the bonus is for.  some you do not get until you report to your first duty station after all your training is completed.  some you do not get until you finish your AD contract and report top your Guard or Reserves Unit.      not every job qualifies for a bonus, not every contract comes with a bonus and not every person is eligible to receive a bonus.|`|v6l3o2kvaa	This info is army, if your asking about the marine side I don't know.    You have to qualify with a good ASVAB score 50 or above, you have to pick a critical MOS mainly combat arms or a very under manned MOS that they need filled.  Also you have to pick a 6 year service term.    All of these encompass getting the full 20,000, you can't just pick 1.  So hopefully this info helps, but ask your recruiter they'll try to get you that money as long as your determined to enlist for it.|`|eN8txEaNaa	in the army you get half of it in 30 to 40 days after AIT and the other half 3 years after your initial entry date|`|iiNDThCoaa	I am in the Reserves and i got 20k ,for signing up.

I was just talking to my sister and she says that he going thru Parker and I guess he is going for his bachelors. He already knows a lot about fixing computers now he just wants to get a degree in doing it....I do not think he has to pay anything while he is in the service. If he does pay anything it will not be so much as to when he does get out, though. I did not want to get into all of that though with my sister. All I know is that my bro in law is going back to school while also serving his country and that is pretty cool.

Jm3vMKx3aa	A Schengen tourist visa issued by Switzerland works different than a US visa. Tourist visa are valid for a maximum of 6 months and a maximum of a 90 days duration of visit. Tourist visa are generally issued based on itineraries presented and are valid only during the time as stated on the visa. That means if you enter Switzerland on April 4, you must leave on April 5. The other important column is the "Duration of Visit ____ days" column (3rd row). It determines for how many days you may totally stay.  The duration is dependent on the documentation provided with your visa application. If your travel health insurance was only valid until April 5, the visa will be valid until this day. If your passport should be expiring on July 5, the visa will expire three month earlier. If the proof of availability of funds per day (CHF100/Rs.4,250/-) is not provided for the whole period the visa duration will be shortened accordingly.  Attached as sample is a Schengen visa issued by Finland which was valid from February 7, to August 7, 2008 and has authorized a total of 30 days of stay within that period.       Source(s):  http://www.consilium.europa.eu/prado/EN/...  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexU...      Edit: based on the next contribution.  @ IbuGuru: Switzerland, same as any other Schengen country issues visa valid for up to 180 days (6 month) with a maximum number of 90 days of authorized stay. Any Schengen visa provison tells that visa may be valid for 90 days in a 180 day period. See the visa sample I have added as source!|`|AA11966821	Switzerland does not allow 6 month tourist visas.  90 days is the maximum.  Clearly you do not have sufficient funds for a 90 day tourist visa, or your reasons and itinerary for 90 days as a tourist are inadequate.  You did get a max of more than 60 days, which is very generous for Switzerland.|`|SBBnWsJJaa	I don't know the specifics, but maybe you needed a different type of visa to stay that long (work?).  Maybe you got a 2 month tourist visa.|`|e0rvBYOPaa	What kind of visa is it?  It is possible that Jan 28 is when it's valid from and 5th of April is the last date you can travel on, meaning you have to go there on or before the 5th of April.  So if you leave on the 4th of April you have 6 months from that date.|`|d36f4eb623d6717ded1abd5b98eaf929aa	You can visit Switzerland for a period of only three months maximum. Further length of stays require additional paperwork and forms.
2lFRYr8Eaa	They need to get an attorney and request that the judgment be vacated.  Now, the problems is that they missed the date.  Asking for a new date does not require a new date be granted.

Write to the judge and let him know that they never missed a payment and that they have the evidence to prove it and that they would like to have the opportunity to present it to him as it was taken away from them by not being notified of the new trial date. The judge in turn will schedule a date and notify the CC company of it. Trust me, if you want to see how an angry judge admonishes a firm such as them you'll want to go to court that day and witness it first hand.     They still can win and they can have this removed from the credit report too. It's just a shame that the company elected to do this under handed against them.    Have faith in the legal system for it will work in their favor.|`|f4ef0b3a83cc1af75c8cb10f391cb5c9aa	If your parents were not properly served with a summons, they could file a motion to have the judgment overturned.  Check with the courthouse were the judgment was entered.|`|nbibIzC5aa	Were your parents ever served with a subpena?  Usually when someone files a case against another person, a subpena is issued to notify the opposing party when to appear for court.  Subpenas in some states are required to be delivered by the sheriff's office.  Who ever served the subpena should have kept a record of when it was served and to whom the subpena was given to.  The reason why is so that a situation like this can be prevented.  The plaintiff must serve the defendant properly with a subpena before the case can proceed.|`|z88IMXNFaa	You don't respond to a summons with a request for a stay.  If the court did not receive an answer to the complaint, it's likely it entered a default judgment.  Your parents need to hire a lawyer.  This is way beyond DIY and DIY is what got them into this mess.  Understand something, the credit card company uses a lawyer because the law is about both procedure and substance.  Even if you have the substance on your side, if you screw up the procedure, you can screw up your case.    There is a time limit to setting aside a judgment.  Your parents need a lawyer to step in now - it may already be too late.|`|eh8jEYGCaa	They are completely screwing your parents! Credit card companies are terrible! Your parents need to get a lawyer who can then talk to the DA, because you MUST be notified of your court date in order to be there to defend yourself, and if they didn't inform you of that date, they had no right to present eveidence against you. Talk to a lawyer as soon as possible, as things like this can be deemed a completely closed case if you wait too long. If you have proof that shows you paid your bills, they can't do this to you. I am disgusted that your credit card company has done this to you, because it sounds as if they are doing it on purpose.

rYNM67oyaa	You have to have a college bachelor's degree to be an officer and you have to be an officer to be a pilot. You also have to be a U.S. citizen.      You can enlist in the U.S. military without being a citizen but you have to have a green card and be a permanent resident of the U.S.     If you can get through that part and you can get a college degree before you're 27, you can become a U.S. citizen after 1 year of honorable military service.|`|c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	You MUST be a US citizen to be an officer in the US military.  You have to be an officer before you can go to pilot training, be it USAF, USN or USMC.  To enlist (which is different than becoming an officer) you only need to be a permanent resident, i.e. "green card holder".  Once you are on active duty, you can then apply for full citizenship.  You also need a Bachelor's Degree from an accredited institution.  You could theoretically work on this while enlisted, then get out, go full-time to finish up, and apply for officer training.  There are a VERY few enlisted folks who are selected to go to college full-time, with end of becoming officers.  But I wouldn't change your whole life on this unlikely possibility.|`|JMJsCU1vaa	no chance, especially today.|`|AA11828439	You can enlist, but your prospects of flying are very low.|`|AA11404742	I think non-citizens can enlist in the US military.  Understand, however, that you will have to swear to defend the US against all enemies.  And that could mean that you might have to fight your own people.    US military service can also be a step towards US citizenship, if you are interested in that.

A simple cheat sheet usually doesn't result in suspension, a school-wide conspiracy might.  Your midterm is toast, gone, it was once they found you cheating.  The fact that it was a "larger cheating scheme" is going to raise doubt on your performance in your other courses and there's a very good chance that you'll find yourself in summer school because they'll most likely fail you in history all together.

jGgOVd5Zaa	Texas is a environmental nightmare.  They may have a good job market, but in 20 years the whole state is going to glow in the dark.  Several states on the 'Best' list are oil states and ethanol subsidies have certainly helped farming states.  Remember that job markets may not be the best indicator of how a state is doing.  It indicates what sorts of jobs are turning over, what is available right now.  <br>  <br>  It's also affected by whether people want to move there.  How many people want to move to Oklahoma compared to sunny California?  Florida and California (along with Arizona) have had huge housing booms.  If you'd looked at these lists before the housing bubble popped the state rankings would be different.  <br>  <br>  Michigan's problems have a lot to do with American car makers not adapting to change.  New York's job market is terrible, but that wasn't the case before the Wall Street collapse, and actually, the parts of the state that were in the worst shape were the more conservative, upstate regions.<br>  <br>  D.C., well, think about it this way: all the states hold elections to decide which crooks they are going to send there... talk about a hopeless cause.<br>  <br>  edit- There is a tendency to draw to simple conclusions from data like this.  If you were in Rome during the Roman Empire you would have said, 'huh, this Roman way of doing things is obviously the best way, since Rome is the most powerful nation in the world.'  Until recently you could say that Iceland was a great model for how to run a country, or the way we ran Wall Street or the housing markets.

ZkDmJtAsaa	It's due to a little thing called 'entitlement'. Many liberals believe they are entitled to a better job, better pay, and better living environment without earning it. Guess what? That money has to come from somewhere, and we all pay for it.<br>  <br>  Let me give you a prime example:<br>  <br>  I live in California. To cross the Golden Gate Bridge will cost me between $5 and $10, and only 20% of that goes to the actual bridge. The rest goes to paying for ferries, BART, and the local government. Sounds good? Not really- in order to drive, I have to pay and subsidize others who don't drive over the bridge.<br>  <br>  While traveling through Texas, I drove through Galveston. There is a small 2 mile gap along the STATE highway over the water. The solution? A free ferry that runs 24/7 back and forth.  When I asked why they didn't charge people for using the free service, the man looked at me like I am an idiot and said 'but this is a state highway. You are already paying your taxes to drive here'.<br>  <br>  That's right- California makes you pay over18 cents per gallon to drive the freeways and an addition fee for the privilege of driving over a bridge. Texas asks why you should pay more for something you already are paying for.<br>  <br>  Makes Texas look a lot nicer to live these days...|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Hmmm.....my state's 10% unemployment rate and 6 years of not balancing the budget says you are wrong.

gasquENMaa	Hello Hollie. The only messages that are accepted and passed along to inmates are of emergency nature. When a call comes in of this type, it is forwarded to the Shift Captain's Office. The shift captain will listen to the nature of the emergency and he will decide if it is of the type that will be passed to the inmate or not. It may sound callous, but we have far too many inmates to take personal calls and relay information. <br>  <br>  Jails and prisons use a payphone service for all calls. Leaving a cell phone will not work. Cell phones cannot accept collect calls. You would need a land line for this to work.<br>  <br>  Only advice would be to write him. Letters take the normal amount of time to deliver to the facility and then add one day for inspection of contraband. On the average, a letter would be in the inmate's hands in 4 business days. If you write, make sure to have his name and inmate number on the front of the envelope. Without his number, it cannot be delivered. If you do not have his number, you can call the facility and ask. They will give it to you over the phone.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you|`|l2MjVVpRaa	1. No, they won't take messages.<br>  2. They can't call a cell phone collect form jail.

We do not have authority to pass information to inmates from outside.  People needing to give info have to call the office during normal business hours and give the info to the Sheriff or a deptuy.  They will then let the inmate know.  Some jails may let you give the number to them.  Just call them and they will let you know either way.|`|CqLjZfkLaa	Most likely not.  Generally speaking, there's entirely too much going on and too many inmates for the officers to be delivering personal messages.  That's not a dig or me being sarcastic, it's really the way it is.  The best thing to do would be to write him a letter about it or go visit him and tell him then.  Good thing about a letter is it will be forwarded to him if he moves, in most cases.  Inmate phones are generally collect calls only, so keep that in mind.  And be forewarned, the charges on those things are outrageous.  If you call the facility they can help answer your questions.|`|GmW5mUrpaa	Do you really think a COP is going to care enough about you or the inmate to give them the message?<br>  <br>  Just think about it.
BUI2nlUVaa	Because people obvioulsy don't understand what a percentage is.  This can be seen by the plethora of retarded answers above me.  10% is still 10%.  If you make $10,000 then it's $1000.  If you make $1,000,000 then it's $100,000.  Rich people would still pay much much more but the percentage would still be the same.  This is why a flat tax would be the best solution for all.  And BTW, if you're only making $10,000 a year as an adult you have more issues than your tax rate.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the have nots have always envied the have's.  The scaled tax bracket is just another example of that.  Yes, many rich people hire accountants to hide their money simply because it's not fair that they pay as much as they do.  If it was a flat tax you'd probably get just as much.  But because it makes people feel good the politicians are going to just keep shoving it down our throats.  <br>  <br>  Oh and BTW, I don't make a ton of money, I wouldn't be considered rich by anyone's standards, but I understand that the people who hire people, start businesses and the lot are the ones that keep our economy afloat.  Remember this the next time you're complaining that rich people have too much money...they're they ones who are employing you right now.|`|AA11086243	because they have more disposable income...<br>  <br>  if they taxed everyone the same... it would take a ton away from the poor... and they would hardly ever have a chance to move up...|`|04a4824f734643fd0c6adefd032a1af8aa	i agree, but then again that percentage would have to be so low for everyone to afford...that woudn't help bring in enough money to the govt|`|DiYLkg31aa	because we are not as cool as communist countries.|`|G7SiH0ohaa	Rich people have more disposable income, and not all rich people work hard to be rich (ie Paris Hilton)|`|h2LmAM0Baa	Wealthier people can afford accountants and find ways to hide money.

No one told them, to live beyond their means. No one will be buying anything, after this stimulus package destroys the rest of America. People will be losing they jobs, in record numbers.

If more people are buying homes, then property values will start to stabilize and less people will have to foreclose. Banks are very picky about who they will lend to these days, so you can bet that almost all homebuyers now either have good credit and a stable income, or have enough wealth to purchase without financing.<br>  <br>  Obama has produced a plan to help homeowners facing foreclosure, but I don't know what the details are.|`|E9XL5x3Paa	Incidentally, Obama is helping people facing foreclosure, despite Republican attempts to stop that plan, too.<br>  <br>  <br>  And home ownership is still considered one of the best ways to build longterm wealth.

Not "either/or". <br>  And keeping up with the news, what passed was not 15,000, it wound up be 8,000.|`|iLozr2aSaa	There is a big difference.

Palin owed taxes on $18,000 of benefits that she got from the state as a result of living at her house instead of in Juneau.  While I don't like the accounting error, I find it more plausible that is was indeed an error rather than the 6 digits of actual taxes that Daschle owed the government.  Face it.  Why would she lie about taxes on $18,000?  I think she could afford the small amount of tax on $18,000 instead of putting herself in the sprotlight by intentionally committing tax fraud.<br>  <br>  2.  The other part of it is the hypocracy of the left on this.  Palin and company have never said that paying taxes is a good thing and aren't trying to raise other people's taxes.  On the other hand, Daschle and company go around trying to convince us how we need to pay more and more, yet they feel it is perfectly appropriate to skip out on their share.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	From your own article:<br>  "the governor asked us to look into this," Kreitzer said.<br>  <br>  So, in other words, she asked if she owed more and made no attempt to hide it at all.

The ChiComs could solemnly declare that global warming is the world's number one and only problem and promise its commitment to the issue.  Forget India.  If the United States will do these two simple things, the ChiComs could say, "Then so will we, the Chinese."

I side with the democrats on most things, but I also have shades of conservatism. Let me answer in chronological order:<br>  <br>  1. Because things take time. We are transfering them to Afghanistan. If we are still there by the end of this year, all hope is gone for this adminstration.<br>  2. Because, unfortunately, it protects us from the bad guys. I hate that it invades our privacy, but until extreme measures are taken to eradicate "bad" and evil people from this country/planet, we have to do stuff like this. Also, when was the last time the government followed the Constitution unless it was to benefit them?<br>  3. Because politicians are the "rich". Would you bite of your own hand? We need middle class politicians. Actually, poor. They've seen America from the inside out.Or, from the bottom up. Also, because the rich are the CEO's and vice presidents of our nations corportations. Raise taxes on them, they cut jobs, raise prices etc. But, if he had just done that years ago, inflation would have countered and wages would have adjusted accordingly. Although, they are no where near where they should be to live "comfortably" anymore.<br>  4. Because, like marijuana, gay marriage is a social issue. It shouldn't be. It being legal has no effect on anyone but homosexuals, and the opposite is true for it being illegal. Homosexuality is still, even in 2009, considered wrong or a "sin" by all the god fearing, illogical, hypocritical U.S. citizens that bog down America. I honestly, sadly, believe that people think that if gays are allowed to marry, they will literally fill the streets with gayness, and attempt, like one religion I can think of, to convert people to gay.Nothing will change, other than tax benefits to gays, which means more money for millions WITHOUT spending money. I bet that never occured to anyone.<br>  5. The stock market is merely skepticism with money. Bad news equals a drop, good vice versa, sometimes. It is dealing with something that is not actually there. Like credit cards. When you start dealing with something that is imagined, it is treated with haste. When people start, in the next 10 years, spending and buying homes below their value and holding on to them, opening (NOT closing business) and banks start handing out "good" loans, the stock market will resemble this up-turn.<br>  6. Because business are closing weekly. Corporations are crumbling. Corporations can have upwards of 15-30 THOUSAND employees, including managers. So, to explain this whole thing, people lose their jobs, they stop spending, more people lose their jobs because of that, people stop spending, people lose their homes, banks go under, people lose money, corporations crumble and so on and so forth. We have been in a downward spiral for years now. AND, AND, we have not reached the bottom. This new SPENDING stimulus, will put us into the bottom of the barrel. I personally believe we wont start seeing the light of day, metaphorically speaking, for about 3-6 years. Maybe longer. <br>  7. Because, again, they are rich, ignorant, and looking down at all of us. They dont truely understand the value of a dollar. I see SO many ways of saving hundreds of thousands of dollars, which would add up daily. Its kind of like, lets say you were facing bankruptcy, and you knew you could spend and spend, and never have to pay it back, wouldnt you probably go out and have fun while it lasted? Well, that's basically every day for those people. This better be worth 10 points :)|`|AA12104896	For the same reason that abortion is still legal and social security was never privatized.<br>  <br>  "Why are we still in Iraq?

Granted it wasn't perfect but it did some good things that we now take for granted.  The FDIC was a program created by the new deal. Do you put your money in a non FDIC insured bank? Do you have grandparents or seniors in your community that don't depend on Social Security? How about all the farmers that get money from the FCIC?  How about your housing?

There are similarities, but this is the Twenty First Century.<br>  <br>  There were NO COMPUTERS in the thirties and things were slower. Both Depression-wise and recovery-wise.<br>  <br>  [Together, government and business actually spent more in the first half of 1930 than in the corresponding period of the previous year. But consumers, many of whom had suffered severe losses in the stock market the previous year, cut back their expenditures by ten percent, and a severe drought ravaged the agricultural heartland of the USA beginning in the summer of 1930.<br>  <br>  In early 1930, CREDIT WAS AMPLE and available at LOW RATES, but people were reluctant to add new debt by borrowing. By May 1930, auto sales had declined to below the levels of 1928. Prices in general began to decline, but wages held steady in 1930, then began to drop in 1931. Conditions were worse in farming areas, where commodity prices plunged, and in mining and logging areas, where unemployment was high and there were few other jobs. The decline in the US economy was the factor that pulled down most other countries at first, then internal weaknesses or strengths in each country made conditions worse or better. Frantic attempts to shore up the economies of individual nations through protectionist policies, such as the 1930 U.S. Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and retaliatory tariffs in other countries, exacerbated the collapse in global trade. By late in 1930, a steady decline set in which reached bottom by March 1933.]<br>  <br>  Our problem occurred in the span about a month or two when the banks went belly up losing their asses trading Credit Default Swaps.<br>  <br>  Our economy is still intact except for the banks. THERE IS NO CREDIT AVAILABLE, and business NEEDS CREDIT. THAT is the crux of our problem. THAT is what is causing lay-offs.<br>  <br>  The more people compare what is going on now to the Great Depression...the farther away from the problem we get.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depre...</a>|`|ciQFlpuLaa	deep down in their hearts, liberals LOVE socialism. that's why they try so hard to portray communists such as Che Guevara and Mikhail Gorbachev as heroes.

2dqQQg41aa	Yes - that is actively supporting the liberals call for separation of church and state.<br>  <br>  Tony - the separation of church and state simply means that our government shall support no religious organization.  If we had no such provision in our Constitution then I could see our government upholding the concept of sanctuary.  The only reason our government doesn't do this very often is politics - they don't want to irk churchgoers, who "may" take offense.<br>  <br>  What gives any criminal the "right" to hide in plain sight in a church and expect that no arrest should be made.<br>  <br>  I don't care if the criminal was a simple shoplifter and law enforcement tackled him in the middle of the pews.  People should not expect to get a free pass on our laws simply by going inside a church!<br>  <br>  What would be next - child molesters hiding inside a religious cults building and expecting sanctuary?|`|bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	I applaud the agent for be willing to do his job.

Way to go. Keep up the good work|`|sf7lOcIiaa	Was he arrested outside or in the church hall? I could see if the agent interrupted a church service to publicly arrest the man inside the church hall, but if he politely asked the man to step outside, and then arrested him, then it shouldn't be a problem.|`|EzrciMgXaa	ICE works by meeting monthly quotas, so they are pretty much doing backflips to deport illegals.|`|Vpq8CZQHaa	I support the action.  There are no sacred grounds for criminals.  Deport, deport, deport!|`|lItwBo0Daa	If your here illegally it shouldn't matter when or where you are caught. Let the officials do their job and get these illegals out of this country!|`|CM1dfztQaa	I agree. If the agent asked Hernandez to follow him and Mr. Hernandez did so quietly, then there is no argument. Mr. Hernandez did not claim sanctuary. He didn't attempt to fight his arrest at all. This tells me that he knew he was in the wrong.

If you voted for the Moron of the Midway because he his black, then YOU are the racist. If you look around and see all of your friends have the same color skin as you, then you are a racist. If you choose to live in a neighborhood because you blend in, then you might be a racist.

vszOEaOZaa	no-these days their catered to or else they scream racism.  haven't they realized it takes a bit of effort to learn, graduate, go to college possibly on a scholarship, get a job and earn a living?  they expect handouts for what happened long before any of us were alive.  by me, there's the black pages for the black community, there's black history month etc.  g** forbid if we say anything like white pages for the white community or white history month.  maybe if they get over being black other people won't knock them.  they cause it themselves.|`|5syj6Uzaaa	No two people were ever treated "equally".  You are referring to different sets of rules for collective groups.  I do see special treatment offered to black groups.<br>  <br>  Given the history of racial tensions, it is unavoidable that there continue to be racial tension for some individuals.  Some of it simply comes from old prejudices.  Some of it is reaction to the special treatment to which you refer.<br>  <br>  Desires to retaliate for past injustices are understandable.  But they exacerbate racial problems.  By having different standards for races, we enforce racial grouping.  Rather than thinking about individuals, we think about groups based upon their race.  This is an official position that leads to individuals thinking along racial lines, sometimes reinforcing old prejudices.<br>  <br>  There are no quick fixes to racial prejudices (just ask the Israelis and Palestinians).  But official policies that delineate by race hurt rather than help.  Blacks are not treated equally.  To be fair to the black activists, some of the unequal treatment is still negative.  But policies that attempt to give blacks preferential treatment based upon their race do not help.|`|R7Hexutqaa	No.  The easiest way to get ahead in life is to be a white male.  I said easiest.  50 years ago it was the ONLY way.  Until the accident of your birth race has no bearing on your prospects, there is no equal treatment.|`|5Ma2ovxjaa	Blacks are treated better.

For example, a 19 year-old clean-cut white Irish Catholic boy walks into a retail store here in NYC and he's much more likely to be hired than a Black equivalent.  The whites always get hired first for retail jobs here in N.Y.  Just one example.|`|HcRhJ1yTaa	No, blacks are not treated equally, not in racist america|`|ZRuJFoUIaa	Your question should be, Are whites getting treated equally with blacks, And the answer to that is, No their not .

eYpE4bp2aa	Nope. Not at all. <br>  <br>  It costs far too much to ship them back, and I don't know one single American who would work in the fields for so little.|`|XRYAfxpTaa	They send more than $40 billion out of the nation and economy annually, or approximately $200 billion over 5 years. <br>  California alone spends over $10.5 billion annually for expenses related to illegal aliens. Some estimates wage depression costs the federal government over $100 billion annually in lost tax revenues from citizens. Bear Stearns estimated over $400 billion in tax dollars is lost annually due to illegal aliens working under the table. <br>  Cost of deportation would be a bargain.|`|hbOFDysJaa	Keeping them here costs us more annually than it would to send them back.  More American citizens could get work if they weren't here.  Illegal immigrants do NOT pay taxes and yet they qualify for tax credits.  They also qualify for home loans.  <br>  <br>  In answer to your question...we can't afford to keep them here.|`|Ht4lD0XTaa	Cheaper to get rid of them then get them set up on permanent government slave status.

Do you think if you ask it enough you might actually get someone to believe your crap? Every time you ask you get the same answers!  ILLEGAL ALIENS are bad for the economy and a hugh part of why we are in the  mess we are in! They have driven wages down to poverty levels not seen since the great depression!<br>  ILLEGAL ALIENS are not an asset they are a liability and any amount of bogus propaganda wont fly with any individual who has just an ounce of common sense!|`|vG0tsqJtaa	We pay more taking care of illegals then we would spend.  <br>  <br>  ex..<br>  Higher insurance since they aren't paying any for there auto.<br>  Paying for free healthcare when they go to hospitals.|`|GhWUbfySaa	They are here knowing that they broke our laws. That alone should be reason enough for any right thinking person to want them out. We would not have to deport them if we didn't make them so comfortable by allowing them free access to health-care, social security, bilingual support everywhere, easily available jobs and housing. They feel safer here than at home, more at home here than in their own home country.<br>  If we just turned the heat up on them, they would leave on their own. One way of doing this is to give them a simple deadline with a consequence: All people found living here illegally after June 2010 will have their cars, business, property and accounts seized and sold to legitimate citizens at discount prices to help defray the cost of deportation. We wouldn't go looking for them, but every time they were discovered, this would be enforced. If this policy were to be passed, the illegals would stampede back to where ever they came from, saving us the cost of enforcement for all but those here for nefarious reasons anyway.<br>   If they want to be here, they can get in line and do it right, there is a way to do that. Why are you so anxious to support criminal activity?|`|CM1dfztQaa	They are the reason our economy is in the toilet. If we deport them we will be better able to get our people back to work and get our economy moving in the right direction.|`|2dqQQg41aa	Your first link is ASSuming that we would have to actively deport illegals.  Anyone with a first grade education already knows that is not how it would or should be done.  We simply remove all of the rewards/incentives for them to be and stay here and VIOLA they will self-deport at their own expense.<br>  <br>  So your first link is totally irrelavant and wrong.<br>  <br>  Your second link only shows impacts to businesses which are actively admitting to breaking the law and feel they should be allowed to continue to break the law.  It also does not show the immensly positive impacts of paying slightly higher wages to Americans.<br>  1. Those people would be paying taxes - illegals pay far less or none.<br>  2. The citizens would be spending their money HERE where it will have a huge impact on our economy - illegals send massive amounts of American money to their contry where it helps them, not US.<br>  3. The playing field will be even between employers who go by the rules and thus far have been punished for their honesty.<br>  <br>  <br>  Your third link is the same as your first one - again nobody with any intelligence is saying deport.  We say remove the rewards and watch them run.|`|AA10045620	Of course, we can afford the deportation of all the illegals.  It would end up being money in our pockets after they are all gone.|`|wbIEau0qaa	so shall we just legalize them?|`|DgfEkFGLaa	If the workers are replaced by tax paying residence who spend the money here instead of sending it out to their original countries the costs will be recouped in no time.

Never mind immigration quotas, visas, <br>  international law, or any of that nonsense.<br>  Once there, demand that the local government provide free medical care for you and your entire family.<br>  Demand bilingual nurses and doctors. Demand free bilingual local government forms, bulletins, etc. Procreate abundantly. <br>  Deflect any criticism of this allegedly irresponsible reproductive <br>  behavior with, "It is a cultural U.S.A. thing. You would not understand, pal."<br>  Keep your American identity strong. Fly Old Glory from your rooftop, or proudly display it in your front window or on your car bumper.<br>  Speak only English at home and in public and insist that your children <br>  do likewise. Demand classes on American culture in the Mexican school system. Demand a local Mexican driver license. <br>  This will afford other legal rights and will go far to legitimize your unauthorized, illegal, presence in Mexico Drive around with no liability insurance and ignore local traffic laws. Insist that local Mexican law enforcement teach English to all its officers.Good luck! You'll be demanding for the rest of time or soon be dead. Because it will never happen. It will not happen in Mexico or any other country in the world except right here in the United States, Land of the naive and stupid,  idiotic politically correct politicians.   If you agree, pass it on. If you don't, go ahead and try the above in Mexico or Iraq.<br>  <br>  Legal immigration YES.

Many would likely find fault with my position on many things. I have never felt the republician party just gave me lip service. However I have felt for a long time that my voice would be drowned out in the democrat party by the far-left extremists there. Therefore, we move to the right which is suppost to be conservatives and republicians. The republicians lost a lot of votes because Americans felt they were controled by the religious right. I never felt the religious right had that much say.<br>  <br>  As a religious conservative, I want to see a country that is defined by it's freedom and not by socialsim. I do not want to see a country where others should be forced to accept my religious beliefs. If I live my life in a way that causes others to choose to follow my example, I'm happy with that but I do not want to use the police power of government to force this country into a theocracy. That would be too much like what we see in the Muslim countries. If people need to fear a theocratic form of government, it will be from the Islamofascists and not the Judeochristians.

RfxyVIh4aa	It is not invasion of privacy.  The telephone was turned in to the police by a civilian; therefore they have the right and ability to go through it.  Probable cause would only be required if the officer took the phone away from your sister.<br>  <br>  Likewise, if your sister was dumb enough to take pictures of drugs or paraphernalia and turn the film in to be developed an employee developing the pictures could call the police.  No need for probable cause if the evidence is simply handed over to the officer.<br>  <br>  To reiterate:  There is no expectation of privacy when you lose something - be it your telephone, backpack, purse, etc.  If you lose it someone else can look through it.  If there is anything incriminating found, you can be busted.|`|85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	It`s still probable cause as the officer did not know whose phone it was and evidents was found.|`|aBJDqwq6aa	'evidence' of what?<br>  Is she being charged with a crime?<br>  <br>  If not, the police lacked probable cause to even turn the phone on.<br>  If possessing a cell phone was probable cause for search and seizure, then everyone would be subject to the same search.<br>  <br>  Just because the phone is in their possession, doesn't absolve them of searching your property without probable cause and/or a warrant.<br>  <br>  File a complaint and talk to a lawyer.<br>  <br>  There was no cause to look at anything on the phone as it was already established who the phone belonged to.<br>  <br>  So, a picture of pot is evidence of a crime?!<br>  What if she had a movie on her phone that was a murder mystery?

Zrq8vjaXaa	You need to contact a lawyer.  There are issues in which you may not be aware of and evidence that you must submit when filing the I-130 and I-485.  It is not simply filling out forms.  The lack of evidence in proving that you are eligible for adjustment of status or that you have a bona-fide marriage can delay your ase for months or years, and if evidence is not provided sufficiently at the time DHS requested, your application may be denied.<br>  <br>  As an immigration attorney, this is the best advice I can give you, not knowing the facts of your case.<br>  <br>  Steven Pham|`|0b87103374738a74c6669593b14b6307aa	I got my green card through my marriage to my husband.

t3QAaSN9aa	The Republican Party is going to need a lot more than a PR campaign.

This is no time for the Republican party to be reinventing themselves, What they need is to get back to true Ronald Regan conservatism, And start telling these conservative heathens that want to throw God out of the party to take a walk . Mich McConnell made a speech to GOP leaders in Washington that the party needs to reach out to minority voters more, And then right exactly after that he picks Steele to head the party ? That is not the Republican party I know . Don't get me wrong, I like Steele a lot, He is a real conservative, But this is no time for the Republicans to be playing politics and working on marketing schemes to market themselves, What they need is to work on the product, Not marketing it , If they keep this up, The Dem's are going to have the White House again in 2012 . I don't like their strategy at all, And their going to continue to divide this party if they keep it up . God bless.|`|410cd3e1b1738d398d8b2183db222dc2aa	Im more conservative than Republican.  i think people would see it as a 'publicity stunt" or a side show.

AA11305474	Hard to tell but so far the bailouts sure haven't worked.  The banks are still not lending money, in fact, they are buying up other financial institutions.  The auto manufacturer's are laying off workers, offering early retirement and closing plants.  In my state, CA, unemployment just went from 8-over 9% in less than a month.  Due to our legislature's mismanagement of funds our budget crisis has only worsened since the end of last year and the budget they just passed last night is a nightmare for the middle class.  Even if we save every dime of the $13 we get from the fed stimulus every month for the entire year, we will now owe the state of CA an additional $200.  I think the "aid" to states may help initially to save jobs, particularly in my state as the governator suspended all construction projects that were underway last week.  And, if they didn't pass their 14 billion dollar tax hiking budget last night, teachers, health care workers, police and fire personnel would all have been out of a job today as the state officially would have become insolvent.  At least some of the infrastructure projects in the fed stimulus will provide jobs to some of the thousands of auto workers who were just laid off, but I doubt those who worked in the financial institutions will apply.  We definitely will end up with more than the 1.2 trillion dollar debt than we started with, but the question is who is going to pay for all of this?  Right now, in the state of California, the answer is the middle class, those who are still working and paying their mortgages and those who can least afford it.|`|ZkMfdTgBaa	We will all have to wait and see.  No one should expect this thing to turn around in a day or two.|`|AA10251487	If you go to stimuluswatch.org, it shows how many jobs each thing in the stimulus will create.  Once those jobs are done, then what? There will be some community improvements - not real sure aside from jobs, how that will stimulate the economy.  Yes there will be a check to tax payers, that will be a short term fix that most people will use to purchase that much wanted flat screen, then they will be in the same boat they are now.  There is the first time buyers incentive, that again is short term. <br>  <br>   If the government truly wants to stimulate the economy, they could have put payroll taxes on hold.  This would have given American families more money and would give American employers more money because they would not have to match the payroll deductions.  We would have gone to the stores, spent our money, increased demand for goods which would allow companies to step up production and hire people and the cycle would continue.  It probably would have cost less to have done that for a short period of time than the stimulus package. <br>  <br>  I do not see how it will solve things in the long term.  I don't understand how spending $99,000 on doorbells will help anything in the long term.

First, some background:<br>  <br>  Naugahyde is a brand of strong vinyl-coated fabric made to look like leather and used for upholstery, luggage, etc.  It was similar to what we call "pleather" today.  This is a vinyl product.<br>  <br>  On the fake petition, I wrote a long sad story about "Saving the Nauggies".  Nauggies were poor harmless creatures that were being senselessly hunted just for their hides.  The big bad hunters were trapping these adorable creatures all over the US and selling their hides to auto, furniture, and luggage manufacturers.  Nauggies are adorable little animals that usually mate for life.  When their mate is killed, they often commit naugacide--which is a terrible thing to witness.<br>  <br>  I filled a few tear-jerking long idiotic paragraphs about these nauggies and asked for people to please boycott anything made of naugahyde (asking them, "Haven't you heard of naugahyde?") and asking them to sign my petition to stop these indiscriminate trappers.  <br>  <br>  I took my petition all around work on a clip board.

There has never been a time in history when an economy didn't come back in some form. Nations fall through military action. They don't fall because they ran out of business or commerce.

But this is an excellent opportunity for him to spend like a crack whore, chip away at our freedom and create social programs that would never be funded except in such times. <br>  <br>  Sorry, long answer to a short question, but the answer is, no. Because the economy will recover and Barry will make darned sure that the recovery is 'mapped' to the obscenity that is this latest 'stimulus' bill. And, it will set a precedent for future obscene expenditures. "See?" Barry will say, "We spent $2 Trillion on the last recession so obviously spending obscene amounts of money results in a good economy." And many in America won't have sense enough to see through his smooth BS.|`|ipWRgKetaa	Ah, but it won't. And that is the beauty of Barry's little trick. The economy will come back. It always does.

They don't fall because they ran out of business or commerce. And Barry, being a smart little socialist, knows this. But this is an excellent opportunity for him to spend like a crack whore, chip away at our freedom and create social programs that would never be funded except in such times. <br>  <br>  Sorry, long answer to a short question, but the answer is, no. Because the economy will recover and Barry will make darned sure that the recovery is 'mapped' to the obscenity that is this latest 'stimulus' bill. And, it will set a precedent for future obscene expenditures. "See?" Barry will say, "We spent $2 Trillion on the last recession so obviously spending obscene amounts of money results in a good economy." And many in America won't have sense enough to see through his smooth BS.|`|TeJWqCL6aa	No they would want to change its distribution it is all pork,<br>  I like pork but they should be a State item|`|bmCInR5qaa	No.  They did contribute any solutions either.|`|eulMjLtPaa	Why else do you think they all voted no?|`|2kgTdNRQaa	I'm afraid they are determined to derail the new president in every which way.

That's how Dems operate. They wanted to win by being involved in the process of making the bill, and having it contain some real, proven, economically sound stimulus actions. Those would include reduced business tax rates, accelerated depreciation schedule, reduced capital gains tax rates, etc.<br>  <br>  But "bipartisan" Obama froze them out of the process, then told them to rubber stamp it or pound sand. So, they have voted to reflect that they had no input into it and do not agree with it.<br>  <br>  But I would iterate - it's not what they want, it's not what we want.

They weren't, but the Republicans weren't exactly Republicans during the last 8 years, as we moved toward more aggressive foreign policy and big and wasteful government spending.<br>  <br>  All Republicans seem to want is tax cuts and increase in military spending.

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Well since Democrats keep claiming that the tax cuts are purely the product of Republican input, I would say some are setting the stage for Republican credit. However, Republicans cannot be blamed for the failure because they will rightfully state that they did not vote for it. Credit and blame do not really matter in politics though. The partisans on both sides will always try to take credit for what works and pass the blame for what doesn't. In turn their loyal supporters will pick up the party line and run with it and those who do not bother to educate themselves on the facts will support whoever the media gives the most credit to.|`|AA10187742	HOW on earth would it help when this spending pork package increases Government big time.

TGgYhWLSaa	First of all, the socialists are everywhere I'm sorry to say. They go from the neo-cons (G. Bush) all the way through the democratic party although some members of the democratic party are still democrats but have to run as independents. Ralph Nader is a good example of a true democrat. Likewise, the only true conservatives are libertarians. Third party candidates generally reflect the original views of today's Republicans and Democrats. Most big party candidates are bought and sold off. The answer to this question is very long, but the short answer is that our elected officials are elected by and for the massive corporations which contribute to their campaigns. Obama got $700M just for his campaign. That didn't come from ordinary people. Those who get the money get the air time. They also win the favour of media outlets who are decidedly left leaning. In fact, our present government is less socialist and more soft fascism; that is a pact between corporate industry and government. Socialist believe the government is run by the people and thus can affect industry. But if the government is run by corrupted elites (as in 99% of socialist countries) it ends up being run more or less BY industry. It ends up becoming more or less fascistic. <br>  <br>  America has been a socialist country for a long time, but unfortunately for us, it is socialism for the rich; they get bailed out, they get tax breaks, they get the universal health coverage. One of the central planks of the communist manifesto is the establishment of a central bank which we have had (Federal Reserve) since 1914. Every country with a central bank always ends up being socialist. There is not one independent republic with a central bank. Sadly, people think socialism is just about 'free healthcare and pills like in Canada'. We pay for those pills dearly in the end...America never does things in halves. If America admits its socialism it will either continue to communism or go fascistic. There will be no universal health coverage as, being America,  it will be corporate health coverage i.e., bad situation. Tom Daschle's recent step down as Health Minister was a very close call with that future.<br>  <br>  As for us at the bottom all we can do is complain to our congressmen as they jet off to dinner with execs from Microsoft and Halliburton. <br>  <br>  Everything starts from the top down. Good documentary to watch is "Freedom to Fascism" by Aaron Russo. Books to read include "Tragedy and Hope" by Carrol Quigley, "The Creature from Jekyll Island" by Edward G.

pcHp7Dgkaa	It's very difficult to migrate to Australia and since the economic meltdown began to affect us, priorities have changed to ensure that strong preference is given to people with skills that are badly needed here.<br>  <br>  Once an immigrant is in Australia, they're very well accepted, particularly when they're from an English speaking background or if they have good English skills. The only real resentment is of people who refuse to assimilate with the wider community and gather in ethnic enclaves. There will always be people with protectionist attitudes and I guess there will be more as the economy weakens, but most people accept that we still need immigrants and that they have a lot to offer our country.|`|CM1dfztQaa	As long as a person immigrates legally, and is a valuable member of society, there really is no problem. The main issue with illegal Mexicans is that they are working under the table (meaning that they don't pay taxes), they aren't just taking jobs that no one wants (my brother lost his roofing job to 3 Mexicans), and they are sending their money home (which helps the Mexican economy, not ours).|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	australia is very strict about immigration - yes.|`|yTdQUqVRaa	I wouldn't say there's more of a protectionist attitude. You will still get your share of anti-immigrants, but Australia has always been a huge melting pot. Don't forget it got it's start as a penal colony.<br>  <br>  As far as getting tougher, I think it's always been fairly tough especially on those who enter without proper visas and documentation - they get shipped off immediately to detention centers. Legally though, you shouldn't have too many problems provided you can meet the requirements for residency.<br>  <br>  Don't forget too that the bad economy isn't just hitting the US. It's worldwide.

If they are unemployed but are not looking for work then they are not included in that statistic.  The same is true for small business owners.

There would be no way they could count me or anyone else like me or the people who quit their jobs or the people who exhaust their benefits. But all in all unemployment figures have always been much higher than official stats. That's intentional to keep people from panicking and to stop runs on banks, etc. During the great depression of the 30's there was no unemployment comp..

74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	our invasion of that country flew in the face of virtually all civilized accords regarding international autonomy of individual countries. However, we currently have a signed agreement with the government of Iraq duly authorizing our continued presence as a security force. Trying to punish the guy that's getting us out of the mess your golden boy created is truly the pit of hypocrisy and even low for a Republican to dare offer up. On the upside, you must have a 20 pound pair of brass balls to go there.<br>  IN RESPONSE:<br>  At the risk of feeding your rant, GWB invaded Iraq, days later, congress approved articles of war, thereby mopping up after him. He did it in spite of the fact that the UN was content with Iraq's level of cooperation at that point. The UN had to do an emergency evacuation of their people to protect them from us. The puppet government we set up has since been legitimized by a free election and is recognized by other nations. No where did I claim (or deny) the war was illegal, just the invasion. The agreement that GWB arrived at with Iraq's elected officials stands the international test of a legal agreement.<br>  BTW: do you concur with GWB that after we were attacked by 15 Saudi Arabians, two individuals from the UAE and one each from Yemen and Iran, all acting under Al Qaeda (a distinctly Shiite organization), that the appropriate and correct answer was to invade Iraq and take out their Sunni leader Saddam? Bearing in mind that Satellite images of Al Qaeda training camps in Saudi Arabia were being shown on various news shows shortly after the attack.

Its not so fun now is it libs to talk about Bush being in jail for war crimes when liberal congressmen/women will be imprisoned as well After all, even after the war crime allegations came out, they continues to fund this "illegal" war. At the very least, that makes them accomplices to war crimes.<br>  <br>  BTW. No credible person or organization has said the war was illegal. In fact, due to continue violations of the cease-fire from the first gulf war and numerous violations of UN resolutions, the war was in fact, legal.

Do you really consider it justice if the warden comes up to you and says, "Sorry, we had no right to put you in here.   We'll hae you out in a year."  Is that really justice?<br>  <br>  While I'm glad that Obama isn't doing this, in an odd way I'd have more respect for him if he did.  By taking the stance he's taken, he's trying to straddle the middle of the issue but neither side should be satisfied with his outcome.<br>  <br>  Personally, in an age of terrorism, I'd like to see Obama (or Bush or whoever) have some sort of Geneva Convention II.

rHwE5Rkbaa	Christopher obviously has no idea what he's talking about.<br>  <br>  Being called up depends entirely upon your rating, your specific billet (what you are doing at the unit) and your unit.

That is the entire point of having a reserve component. How likely that you will actually be called will depend on several factors such as your branch, job, and whether you have been activated before. <br>  <br>  I knew a guy that was in the CG reserves that got activated, but his duty station was about 90 miles from his home. If your law enforcement in the CG, that would increase the liklihood of you being activated. <br>  <br>  While there are some CG members that deploy to the middle east I believe it is a relatively small number. If you do get activated you will most likely be placed inside the U.S.|`|l89kUn4naa	not very likely because the Coast Guard is there to protect America not fight in wars. you have no problems.

5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	The U.S. cannot make the reconciliation you speak of.  Socialism has nothing to do with contentment.  Most people in Socialist countries are anything but content.  Listen to the Swedes gripe about their taxes and their health care system.  The French do the same.  Then they will brag about their “free” college and “free” health care (among other things).  But if all these things are “free,” why are their taxes so high?  Where is all the money going?<br>  <br>  Capitalism, properly managed, provides incentives for productivity.  Socialism provides only limited incentives and many workers do as little as possible for their wages.  Why break your back trying to be more productive when the bum next to you is loafing on the job?  Besides, if you try to do your best, you will likely be ostracized (or worse) by your fellow workers for making them look bad.<br>  <br>  Socialism works best in small countries with vast natural resources. Most such countries are monarchies.  Then look at Russia.  It has huge reserves oil, natural gas and gold.  How prosperous is the typical Russian?  Why do Russia President Medvedev and Prime Minister Putin spend their summer weekends at their cottages on the Black Sea while their “equal” citizens spend theirs cooped up in tiny apartments?<br>  <br>  Socialism talks about a “worker’s paradise” in which everyone is equal.  Socialism says “To each according to his needs and to each according to his contributions.”  Guess who decides what YOUR needs and contributions are?  Hint:  It’s NOT you.|`|Ry61ViNZaa	You do raise interesting and valid points.  The bottom line, as I see it, is that people in this country, over the last 45 years, have fed into an entitlement mentality.  People think they deserve what others have worked 20, 30 or more years for with little or no effort.  Too many people live off credit and buy things they can not afford.  And when they get in a rut, they look for someone to pay the bills for them because to them they have been taught that is "Fair".<br>  <br>  People have to learn to live a life style of personal responsibility and to live with in their means.  Otherwise, the must be allowed to fail.
bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	Online.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	AFROTC is "the real thing".<br>  <br>  Go to the website I gave you in the other question you asked.<br>  <br>  You are probably confusing AFROTC with JROTC.<br>  <br>  JROTC is a program for HIGH SCHOOL students, which teaches some of the military basics... how to march, how to salute, how to wear a uniform property, (more or less). If you complete it it looks good on your resume when you enlist. (I think you get an extra stripe in Baisc or something.)<br>  <br>  AFROTC ( AIR FORCE RESERVE OFFICER TRAINING CORPS) is the real thing. You do 4 years of college. While in college you take ROTC classes, and go to P.T. and  in the summer you go to summer camp (sort of a watered down version of basic training). Your Major is whatever the heck you want it to be, they don't care. (They do have a soft spot for engineers, but one of my friends who did AFROTC was a music major, and he flies F-16s now.) Your Minor is Aerospace Science..which is a fancy word AFROTC.<br>  <br>  After 4 years you graduate college. You have a commission in the USAF Reserve as a Second LT. You report to the USAF and serve three years (?) on active duty and then you continue to serve at least 4 years in the reserve... unless things have changed since I was in.<br>  <br>  If you qualify you can get a free tuition scholarship, you don't have to pay for college. These schollarships can be hard to get.<br>  <br>  I don't want to be mean, but the answers to all your questions are  pretty easy to find.  You can  just go to Google and type in AFROTC and read their website; or call up an Air Force Recruiter and ask these questions, or even see if there is an AFROTC unit near where you live and contact them... I don't want to discourage you, but if  you don't have the initiative and drive required  to do your own research on this how do you think you are going to be able to succeed in the Air Force?|`|8MnLsQ32aa	Since you're not in you may think that it is hard to be in the military and go to school. However, you will have down time, you won't always be deployed and you will most likely work a set hours. You can work from 0700-1630 (430pm) and then go to school after that. You can choose a school depending on either whats on base or a internet course if you want. You can also do internet courses if you do happen to deploy. If you PCS (permanent change of station), you can a) transfer the credits b) take online courses from the school you were attending or c) they may just have that school to where you end up moving to. <br>  Its not too hard. I encourage everyone to start taking classes as soon as they can. 1. It gets you used to it. 2. You don't keep saying "I'll start next semester." That can lead up to 4 years later as it unfortunately did in my case. I would say to start off with 2 classes so you see how it feels and you're not overwhelmed. And then from there you can see how you feel with the workload from school and from work. <br>  Education is important. It can benefit you while you're in (you can choose to go the officer route) and it will definitely help you when or if you decide to get out. Go for it!|`|6530dce5ca00babebb7f1d2a04250053aa	You can get degrees online or from night schools around the base.  In AFROTC you workout three times a week, take one class per semester about the Air Force, and once a month do field training that lasts all weekends.  After the first two years you will have to spend a few weeks during the summer at different schools in the Air Force.  <br>  <br>  They should pay 100% of your tuition when you are enlisted or once you receive a scholarship from ROTC.  Only certain majors apply to the ROTC program though, so ask which ones those are.  As for being enlisted and getting a degree you might only be able to get a degree that is related to your job in the military, so if you are a cook you might not be able to go to school for finance.|`|4p1m2Saeaa	Getting a degree while you are in the military is the sweetest of deals.  Get the GI bill (NO TOUCHIE!!!)  Then, request tuition assistance from the military ( i think its like 70% or something).  Then, you can use student loans or grants to pay for the rest.  <br>  <br>  Also, you can get CLEP tests for free.  (That's where if you know about a subject, you can take a test and get college credit if you pass.)<br>  <br>  When you get out, you can use the gi bill for grad school.  Also, working for some programs like AmeriCorps will pay off student loans.<br>  <br>  The numbers may have changed in the last few years, but probably not much.   So, if I am wrong, I'm wrong.  But ask all those questions.|`|Ht4lD0XTaa	It's very simple.  Choose a field and attend and pass classes.  You do it while on active duty.  Same as night school.  <br>  USAF Veteran|`|HFSk25tDaa	i would suggest ROTC.<br>  it allows you to be trained for the AF while getting your degree, without the risk of deployment in the middle of a semester, great opportunity, offered at 700+ colleges.<br>  <br>  goarmy.com/rotc<br>  <br>  there are also 2 and 4 yr programs. checkkk it out.:)

Not only that, but the banks would start to actually perform as they should. If the caps get rid of the sleazy, lazy, corrupt, bailed-out bankers because of the salary caps, I think that would be a good thing.

In other words, I would eliminate the 1965 New York Times v Sullivan creation of the Press as virtually unpunishable for the lies that they print.

In the 1870s, white Democrats gradually returned to power in southern states, sometimes as a result of elections in which paramilitary groups intimidated opponents, attacking blacks or preventing them from voting. Gubernatorial elections were close and disputed in Louisiana for years, with extreme violence unleashed during the campaign. In 1877 a national compromise to gain southern support in the presidential election resulted in the last of the federal troops being withdrawn from the South. White Democrats had taken back power in every Southern state.[3] The white, Democratic Party Redeemer government that followed the troop withdrawal legislated Jim Crow laws segregating black people from the state's white population."|`|f9oAVdH5aa	And there's a former Klan member in the Senate,Sen Byrd.

In its finding, the Court will likely order that he will be jailed for some period of time and that he may obtain release upon the payment of a good amount of his arrearages.  When a person is in jail a good percentage of those jailed will want to make application or requests to all of their associates, friends, relatives, loan possibilities, sale of other assets that they may have, and to come up with several thousands of dollars that they can apply on the arrearages, and after a week or two, if they have obtained funds from any of these resources, they, usually through their attorney, will seek court attention, and present the amount of funds that they have obtained, and the court will assess if they have made all the effort that they can, and the court may release them when they pay the amount that they could come up with, and will release them with orders for another hearing in a couple of months to determine if they are current in their payments and their ordered payments on the arrearage.  If they haven't appreciated their few month's freedom from lock-up by further reducing the arrearage, then the judge may squeeze them for more by placing them back into jail for a while longer, and the process is repeated. The court will most likely increase pressure on them to pay by also ordering that their driver's license be suspended and that additional attachment lien be ordered to their employer, if any, as lien on salary that the employer will have to legally abide by penalty of law.  If that is what you want, then do not alter your course, or you will be frustrated.  Upon a filing for motion for contempt, he will be served to appear at a certain time and date, and his failure to appear will result in a warrant for his arrest. When he does appear, he will in all probabilty be jailed, and the process stated above ensues.   Remember that he invited himself into the jail by his failures to obey a court order, and that he has the keys to the jail cell by seriously working on gathering monies to reduce his time in jail.  You also have a key for his release, but if I were you, I would keep my key in my pocket.|`|iOqmoIrcaa	And what good will getting him arrested do?  He isn't earning an income if he is in jail.

Why? because you americans don't even make your own monetary and fiscal policies. you central bank the federal reserve is private owned by foreigners. now how many people in America realize that? probably not even 1% of that chubby 300 million. too busy watching Simpsons and that donut chomping machine they call Homer.<br>  <br>  when Americans do not make monetary policy, have no control over interest rates, the money supply, inflationary and budgetary regulation? well, it's no surprise many coincidences occurr at just the right time, housing bubble, deregulation, fraudulent lending practices, a ton of people losing all their money, a small minority getting that money and becoming super rich. <br>  <br>  education is one of the problems in this country honey. i mean a lack of. i'm from malta, and i got a scholarship to go to yale for 2 years. complete waste of time! i have never met stupider people like my economics professor or political science teachers. complete morons. free market capitalism will always work. wow! look at all these government bailout eh? pretty free market if you ask me. AIG, fannie and Freddie, the Big Three, twice, now asking for a thrid bailout, Wall Street wants $1 trillion. <br>  <br>  can you believe that? those who caused the financial crisis actually get taxpayer's money. and the CEO's of AIG, Fannie and Freddie get $20 million dollar bonuses! pretty sweet to be a capitalist huh? <br>  <br>  for your question: here are some things you can do to stimulate the U.S. econominy. wink wink. the Fed has cut interest rates to historic lows. so this is suppose to entice fellow Americans to go spend and borrow money. so, go to your nearest bank, and take out the biggest loan you can get. max out your credit cards and go buy on margin.<br>  <br>  (Borrow money to buy stock btw) so go out there and buy some blue chips, DOW JONES, buy a stake in them while they're at 7500. in a year I say the DOW will drop to 3000. then after 40 years it'll rise back to 8000. you'll make a small profit. <br>  <br>  second, stop buying crap from communist China. those communists make communist lead toys, communist poisonous crap, comunist toxic dog food. communist son! do you understand! once everybody stops buying foreign crap like the all wise mainstream media is suggesting? all the better, American companies who sell those lead toys and toxic communist action figures will go bankrupt. more americans will lose their jobs and help the economy. <br>  <br>  don't shop at Wal MArt either.

You can also ask the local Community Health Council for advice.If you wish to sue for negligence then I suggest you seek advice from a Solicitor.|`|jh9iPYvXaa	You can't sue the hospital because you picked up a disease while you were there, unless it was because they used instruments that weren't sterile or procedures that weren't the standard of care. There are sick people at hospitals. You can catch diseases. The other choice is to have your baby with your midwife. You take a chance either way.|`|YFX2R2ucaa	i think you should talk to a lawyer or something to see if it would make sense to sue the hospital. you should not have gotten some bacteria from the hospital and when you did they should have taken care of you properly and not pretend they didnt know anything|`|8rKXT8sOaa	YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Its not ur fault u got it!!!!<br>  Sue their @$$|`|8SvAoq0Vaa	You can sue the hospital but would you be willing to undertake all the hassle and expense it involves?<br>  <br>  When you are administered treatment by any hospital they owe you in law what is known as a "duty of care".  This essentially means that if you are harmed by their acts or omissions they are likely to incur liability. <br>  <br>  In order to sue successfully you need to show what is known as "causation".  This is simply that the acts of A cause subsequent injury to B.   The problem I feel you would have is that the bacteria which affected you whilst in their care could have come from a number of possible causes.<br>  <br>  You would need to prove, on the balance of probability, it was the hospital.  How would you prove this?   Before you can even fire the first bullet you need evidence unless there is something that points to the hospital's misconduct such as reports, witnesses etc.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|G0U6BgZSaa	Suing the hospital is a long and drawn out process, and more than likely would result in a low out-of-court settlement. With a newborn baby as well, I feel you would be better off concentrating on building a bond with your baby than fighting a battle that will be difficult for you, both emotionally and physically. <br>  <br>  You cannot prove you caught the bug in the hospital, you were checked over by your midwife, not a doctor, and a basic check up will not pick up Streptococcus anyway. You will have been MRSA swabbed as you went in, but you still would not have been tested directly for the strain of the infection you caught. It is possible you picked it up in the hospital, but equally, you could have caught it elsewhere, and you will struggle to prove this one way or another. <br>  <br>  You say that the staff were not caring, and that a doctor did not come and see you before discharge. A doctor is not obliged to visit you before you are discharged, but they must sign off your discharge planner, and will have made sure you were fit for discharge before doing so. Staff in all departments, wards etc are understaffed and over worked, and will provide care to the best of their abilities, and your local PCT will be monitoring the care that patients were given. <br>  <br>  You cannot prove that somebody did not wash-up properly, or change gloves, but after every examination, the staff change gloves and wash hands. You would struggle to prove that in a court of law, it is speculation and conclusion making, rather than concrete evidence<br>  <br>  Your PCT will have a patient liasion service that you can contact, or PALS, if you were unhappy, but concentrate on your newborn baby, and build that important mother-baby bond, rather than fighting a legal battle that will drain your emotionally and physically. Be thankful you are better, and have the chance to build that bond. There are many out there without that chance. <br>  <br>  You do not have to sue straight away. You have a certain time from the date of the incident to carry out legal action, so you could pick up a legal battle in the future once you are fully well. <br>  If you are still concerned contact a solicitor for more advice.
qlqRYlbkaa	Yes, it will. But God will always have it on his record.|`|AA10045620	It will always be on your record.  Because you were a minor when you were arrested, that part of your record should not be revealed to those checking out your background.
