20090307172441AANLVR8	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you hold liberal, moderate, or conservative views on economic issues?	You could take the current economy for example. Do you believe that the government should follow the Keynesian style of economics and increase government spending on things like infrastructure to attempt to spur on the economy? Do you believe in the "free-market" way and let the consumers and businesses decide the fate of the economy? Or do you believe in a combination of both and perhaps let the government spend to a certain degree?

20090307223441AAygKLx	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do conservatives get all up-in-arms about "rationing" of health care?	What exactly do you suppose the function of "free" markets is? Among other things, it is to serve as a rationing mechanism. In the health care sector, a "free" market would mean that only those who are able to pay would receive care; anyone else, irrespective of other factors, including their value or potential value to society. Anyone not wealthy enough to afford coverage would be "free" to go away and die, even if their condition was easily treatable.      Thus, in the "free market" approach favored by those on the right, no expense would be sparred keeping the idle holders of idle capital sucking down oxygen, while even the most promising young people without the means to pay would be left to rot, reflective of the commoditization of human beings that the unchecked market inevitable brings about. How is that not rationing? It is by definition - merely an incredibly unjust, insanely uneconomical form of it.

They take advantage of people that that can't afford a lawyer & if by chance they do get one, they will bully the lawyer to get their way.

And still more to Pakistan, aren't we supposed to be allies? But he has been attacking, and why? Could it be because they have nukes? Is it possible Hugo Chavez is in this Socialist takeover, of USA? Do you know that he was involved in 9/11, and 3 days after paid al-Qaeda $1,000,000?   Did you know Chavez since 2003, has been trying to overtake the whole banking-economy of S. America, and that he almost did it to Argentina, loaning them millions, then a week before payment due, he raised their interest rates so high, Argentina couldn't pay that is why CHAVEZ hated Bush, because we helped them and Chavez told the world on TV he approved the Burning of the American Flag on 9/12/01, the next day. Are you going to get prepared soon? Did you know Obama knows exactly where we're at? Did you know we have no power as a Conservative Body of Government? Did you know most Liberals can't be trusted by a Conservative during a take over, or will this be a walk-over because they have EVERY SINGLE key to every office of the Government, and our Military are leaving home unneccessarily? Do you see it coming? When do you think it will be? Do you think any of the Military in America know what's going on, and will help we the people?       Meanwhile, Chávez has used his oil wealth to lend $2.5 billion to Argentina, offer $1.5 billion to Bolivia and $500 million to Ecuador.       Chávez is promoting what he calls a "socialist" alternative to the Fund and its biggest shareholder, the U.S. Treasury.

Un esempio: la stramaggioranza dei prodotti televisivi americani, gli indennizzi per i paesi che se lo possono permettere (una sorta di cassa integrazione che avvantaggia piu' banche e finanziarie che solitamente denunciano migliaia di ettari fittizzi improduttivi per diverse calamità) bruciando la concorrenza dei paesi piu' poveri costretti alla monocoltura.   Si spiegherebbe (leggendo fra le righe) la stridente differenza fra cio' che guadagna il semplice produttore ed il prezzo alla vendita diretta del prodotto.      (vi prego "risparmiatemi" Wikipedia)

The reason? A piece of legislation known as the Freedom Of Choice Act, or FOCA, that opponents believe will force hospitals and doctors to perform abortions even if they have moral opposition to doing so.      Since doctors at Catholic hospitals won't perform an abortion, the logic goes, the hospitals would have no choice but to shut their doors under FOCA rules.      does he forget who started hospitals??? the Catholics!!!! i hope he realizes how many jobs he will be putting out if this passes!!!      he will be know as the worst president in history just cause he wants to push his lib agenda!!!!!!!!!!

20070224141104AA0RaCK	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Want to know why minorities have trouble in some areas of politics?	It isn't discrimination : it's because of a fear of reverse discrimination.  E.g., people elect a president to serve all states & peoples of the USA, hopefully fairly.  Many whites likely see the way there is so much racially-charged & motivated speech by non-whites on radio, TV, etc. and feel like that minority politician will give extra special care to his/her own group, exclusively.  The well-being of this nation requires evenhandedness.  Serving only your own goes back long before the mid-1800's or black & white issues, so we all know this doesn't work : it divides and creates hatred & distrust.   I've sometimes listened to the radio & come across black gospel programs where the speaker was keyed up & telling how the black people need to do such & such, stick together & get for themselves.  That isn't christianity.  That's racism.   Be for everyone, earnestly & fairly , and you'll likely start to see a difference.

20090227123315AAIjP5Y	Politics & Government;Politics	Are any of you pro-choice, equal marriage rights Republicans?	I am. I'm just curious if there are other Republicans out there like this. My biggest reason for voting Republican is based on my conservative thoughts on the economy and all financial stances. I am also not an avid supporter of immigration whatsoever. I feel it's ok..but ONLY in limited amounts to people who are qualified to come here.       But anywho- I'm pro-choice even though I am a Christian because I realize that women are sometimes in a very desperate and dire situation and need access to that safely ( does it suck that some women use it as birth control? -yes). And I am also ok with gay marriage. I wouldn't spend my time fighting against it or spreading hate. I'm Christian and although my religion doesn't "agree" with it...I'm pretty sure that the stuff I do for half of my day is a sin anyway lol.       Ok..so are there any Republicans out there like me?

BEFORE ANYONE STARTS RANTING I DO NOT AGREE WITH SHOOTING CATS, BUT SOMEONE ELSE IS SAYING HE LEGALLY CAN.   What exactly does the law say, The bloke is trying use the law about shooting dogs to protect livestock, but that is specifically about dogs not feral cats. Also he claims to have shot domestic and feral cats on behalf of a railway company, and that the only law protecting cats is that you may not cause them to suffer.      So what he is basically saying is if your neighbours cat goes in your garden you can kill it as long as you do it humanely      Please no emotional views or opinions as i have already said i don't agree with killing cats, i just want facts.

Agree with me or not, I still have every right in the world to hold this opinion, it is ridiculous how yahoo censors ideas that they do not favor.        I do not support random killing or violence against illegal immigrants, I support a national law that makes illegal immigration a crime that is punishable by death with no appeals process to slow the process down.
20090227125212AAUiT4k	Politics & Government;Military	Should the military be private?	A lot of people think that military groups are souly that of countries consisting of large armies and massive amounts of troops. This is simply not true. Private military branches have been around for a long time and are just now becoming more popular. These groups usually consist of smaller amounts of men and resources but often do a better and more efficient job then regular military groups. I'm not trying to say that our military is lacking but i do think that hiring out private contractors for military jobs is a much more cost effect way to fight wars and has a very appealing rate of success with low casulties.  What's your opinion?

Politicians use the electorate as a means to an end and once elected become part of their Government that only does what they want irrespective of the public view. We the voters will probably never see or hear from them again until next time. Governments don't stick to their promises anyway so our voting is meaningless. Their term in office is a road to making personal gain at our expense. They are all top show and "brownie points " exponents. Maybe some back- benchers are the genuine article but there is little value in them attending Parliament, they would get shouted down if they didn't tow the line. Yes, I am of the view that contrary to what they say they are in it to look after themselves primarily. Am I just a grumpy old man?
