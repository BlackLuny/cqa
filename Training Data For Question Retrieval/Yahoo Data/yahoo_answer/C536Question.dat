20090225023452AAIVuuX	Health;Men's Health	Can a female get less pleasure from a penis after she is aroused and looser?	A woman's vagina is supposed to loosen or at least deepen as she gets more aroused correct?  Is it possible that once she gets quite aroused the penis can then feel 'small' or not as pleasurable?      I was thinking about this because my girlfriend has a pretty tight vagina.  It appears that after foreplay and intercourse for a period of time, she seems to deepen and get a little less tight.        If she loosens up, wouldnt my penis then feel smaller in comparison?  or would it still feel the same?  Im not sure but after she gets really wet and everything gets going, it feels like there is less resistance inside.      any information would be helpful thanks

20090225023621AANkOuV	Health;Dental	I'm scheduled to have braces on in two weeks but need to have 4 teeth removed.?	The main reason for me deciding that I want braces is to correct the overcrowding of my lower teeth. My upper and lower teeth protude out slightly. I would like braces for my lower teeth and realise that by extracting 2 teeth from there will help straighten my teeth. I am happy with my top teeth but the orthodontist said that I will need to take 2 teeth from the top or I will have buck teeth. People have said that I don't need braces because when you smile you generally only see people's top teeth.       I have seeked opinions from 2 different orthodontists. I am also worried that my facial features may change slightly. The reasons for wanting braces, especially on my bottom teeth is to be able to maintain them better. Any suggestions or past experiences with braces is greatly appreciated.

I thought I just was getting a urinary infection.. on Saturday after going to the bathroom I found blood on the toilet paper.  First thought it was blood in my urine due to urinary infection.  Bleeding and burning continued.  Then Sunday found blood in my underwear.   Monday I went to the dr.  Did a UA that came back normal.  Dr couldn't due a pelvic that day so I am going in tomorrow for pelvic.  I am still   bleeding, odor, and still occassional burning.  When I looked up symptoms I had all the symptoms of cervical cancer.  I am freaking out!    I've had a pap smear every year and did have an abnormal one probably about about 7years ago.  Was treated for mild dysplasia.  Every pap since then has been normal. My last pap was done last may and was normal.   Could this still be cervical cancer or is it just an infection?  thanks!

20090225031058AAemCra	Health;Men's Health	Would I have gotten sick (or died) if I ate semen, when I was four years old?	.      ***Make sure that you read the Additional Details. If you notice the "big plothole" in this whole question, the additional details will explain it as they respond to the disrespectful answers that I got from the last time I asked this.***      Anyways,      I already know that if a teenager or adult swallows semen, then the stuff is completely harmless to the body. (sources: I read fanfiction, and I also read the answers that girls put in this website about swallowing after a B-job.)      But I remember when I was four years old: I was left alone with my teenage aunt (she's an adult now) and she brought me to her bed to perform oral sex on me. I let it happen, probably because I was too young to know that it was a sexual activity.   Then, when she stopped, she took off her panties, expecting me to 'return the favor'. She wanted me to suck on her "area".      But I was lucky enough to get that *something's not right* feeling, and so I told her I didn't want to. She tried to insist (but not forcefully), but I still said no.   She shrugged if off, and it was over.      Now I'm curious. If I had actually ate her out, she would've "cummed", and I would've swallowed (I think she would've put me in a position where her semen would fall down into my mouth).      What bad things would've happened to me if I actually ate her semen at such a young age? And I mean physically.   Would it have killed me?      I refuse to believe that *she* would ask me to "eat her out" if she knew that there were any physical consequences, but I would bet anything that she didn't even know what would happen, especially since she was (technically) young.

Basically my nan always used to tell me (and tell my parents) that I didn't eat enough, and if I wanted to grow up to be big and strong, I needed to eat my greens and always finish my meals.      Thinking about it now as a 23 year old... is there some truth in this, because, all my life I've been a slim guy.. its only in the last 3 years or so, am I starting to develop a much more defined physique. I liken my body to that of a thai boxer. Slim, athletic and tight defined muscles...      I've been going the gym for about a year straight.. simply for strength and a little more definition & bulk (I'm not looking to beef up, with protein shakes etc etc) ..but I am eating better.. always making sure I get at least 3000cals/day and eating lots of lean meat (It's working great, so this isn't the issue)      ....but what I cant help wondering is, if I'd eaten more when I was younger would I have the body I have now?   Would I be stockier if I'd been taking in more calories when I was say, 14, 15?      Just how much of an effect do you think it has on our adult form?      ...and again, just how much truth is there in the saying "Eat your greens if you want to grow up to be big and strong"

My brother and I have decided to try and resolve some long-term "issues" with one of our family members. I knew that these series of conference calls would be uncomfortable, but in this last one, the other family member got down-right ugly in attacking me and crossed the line by yelling, constant interruptions, etc. This person is really important to me, and I do want to try and resolve some our "issues", but aftert this past phone call causing so much stress for me due to the attacking nature, I wonder if I should hold out until after this baby is born to continue these conference call meetings. My question is...Do I have a valid concern about this extreme stress affecting this unborn baby/my own health at this time in my pregnancy? The stress level has caused insomnia, lots of intense crying (past the "normal" pregnancy crying), my entire body shaking, and I wouldn't even know what my current blood pressure is.

20090225053052AA2ij6c	Health;Mental Health	Has anyone else become slightly obsessive and gone insane over kids TV?	My baby has decided he likes in the night garden, so we watch together and I talk him through it, in the hopes he will learn from it (god only knows what he will learn from it!)   The other day, I thought to myself, as all deranged mothers do "how come you never see the Wottingers, the next door neighbours of the Pontupines, are they nightmare neighbours and do they hate each other?".      Yesterday, as if by magic, Mr Wottinger knocked on the Pontupines door, but the fists were up!  What ho?  I thought. Fisticuffs ahoy?  But no, they were playing hide and seek.   Then I thought, hang on a minute, 8 kids a piece and dressed like that, you've got to be at least in your peg people 40's!  What the heck are you grown ups doing playing hide and seek.      So, my question is, have I gone mad watching kids TV, and have any of you others thought of similarly pointless questions.      Feel free to say "it's not for you, you nutbag, it's a kids TV programme and don't you remember similar programmes when you were a kid?  What did Mr Benn do for a living?

The shape is even good. I confused it for an actual molar. Lol      My question is how long will this wisdom tooth last for if I floss and get my teeth cleaned like twice a year.      I know they are not as strong as regular teeth.      But I know people in their late 50s and their wisdom teeth are still going strong.      I have no pain etc with it.

20090225052459AA1XR7X	Health;Other - Health	Plz help! need to find out what drugs were used on me?	this is what I know for sure: oxycodone and mescaline (in some form) were used often. either taken orally or rectally. There may be other drugs that I've experienced and I'm hoping for some input here.      it occurred off and on for roughly 15-18yrs. I'm now 23. I was sexually abused at these times, and any evidence was gotten rid of efficiently. I have been away from this environment for 4yrs now.      can you switch from one variety to another (with same similar ingredients or effects) and avoid major dependency?    what other drugs could be used, to lessen the effects of the withdrawal symptoms (if there were any), and what would that drug's effects be like?      If you could tell me what the effects are of each possibility that comes to mind that would help so very much. I'm trying to sift through some dark parts of my life, and did not know I was drugged at the time, so I couldn't really be sure what was real and what was not. Though I will say, oxycodone-like effects and mescaline-like effects were ever-present. I've done alot of research on both, but am not sure where to go from there.      any advice on how to go about this? I'm being constantly told that they likely wouldn't be in my system anymore, since its been so long.

It usually goes away at night about an hour or so before I go to bed, but then when I wake up, it is back again.      If it matters, me and my dad had a huge argument Sunday afternoon and night, but I wasn't yelling much then, I knew I was sick, so I didn't want to yell that much.      Well, no it's Wednesday, and I still have the re-occurring sore throat      I would go to the doctor, but I don't have health insurance, any ideas on if it is serious or not?

20090225032706AAPWijd	Health;Dental	I have to have my tooth extracted, should I worry?	So as my previous two questions were around my dental care so is this one, I found out why my mouth hurt, it was because the root canal preformed in 05 failed, and even worse a infection had been building up, but not noticeable for a few months now. The doctors also think the previous guy had a chip of his instrument in my gum, and didn't tell me. Bad form. Anyway three dentist both concluded that it would be better just to have the tooth pulled, which I agreed. My anxiety and agoraphobia would have made a root canal almost impossible and even this is hard so they'll be using an I.V. to put me to sleep, as it's a surgery...kind of.       But I'm scared of that too. Should I be worried, can anything bad happen? Is it true not all I.V.s work for people and you wake up mid procedure, even though this is only a 30 minute procedure tops.

20090225041309AApDyZY	Health;Other - Health	Should I get a gastric band based on the following information?	I am 24 years old, 5ft 4in, just under 16 stone.  Since aged 14 I have tried all the fad diets, as well as Weight Watchers and Slimming World and although I sometimes have had success I have always put it back on and am currently the heaviest I have ever been and am almost a UK size 20 (US16 I think).      I am a student and work part time.  I get my next student payment in April.  I can afford to put ￡1000 of this towards my op.  As I left my full time job after having earned more than ￡6000 last year I have had to pay tax on my part time job (although I am due some rebate which i would put towards op).  So from April this year I will not be paying tax as will be under the threshold.  This means I will be approx ￡70 per month better off.  I can get a bank loan for ￡2000 at less that ￡60 per month, so won't even know the difference to what I have had now.     I've been offered the loan y my bank already.      I have sourced a hospital in Brussels to do the op.  It is ￡3000 and aftercare is in the UK (the surgeon travels to UK every Thursday).  I have read about the surgeon and I am happy with him.      I'm already 24 and feel like so much has passed me by due to being a fatty my whole adult life.        or      I'm only 24 and have my whole life ahead of me to enjoy being slim, happy and successful.      I took a big step last year and left a job I hated to go to uni.  This is the only other thing holding me back and although I know it will be tough, and I will have to get back into going to the gym (which i actually enjoy once i start doing it) nothing else has worked for me and i know it is a big step but I am beginning to think it is the only option.      What do you think?         Thanks      B xx

20090225042245AAP2TCW	Health;Diet & Fitness	Looking to lose weight - any tips?	I've been 'dieting' for a few weeks now, which basically means I don't snack and have been eating as healthy as I can on a budget, which is pretty hard as I'm a uni student and access to fruit and veg isn't particularly hard, but it's less easy to do than when I'm at home.   I did very well the first few weeks, only eating around 600 calories a day, and I exercise too - an hour every day, including crunches and aerobics. Recently, however, I have been seeing my boyfriend more frequently (he works a lot so I was able to diet without inteference for a while), and being with him seems to put me off dieting and I don't exercise as well. I feel like I have put the weight I lost (3 lbs in a week, haven't measured since as I don't dare) right back on, and I know he's trying to help me by making sure I eat sensibly, but he really doesn't understand that I loathe the way I look and am trying to do something positive for myself, not him. I am not trying to get skeletal, just skinny. I am 5ft 9 and weigh 141 llbs, which I don't really know is good or bad.   Does anybody know any effective diets? Or good tips? I really need a kick up the *** to get to a place where I'm happy with myself.   Thanks!

20090225071650AA2wrXy	Health;Mental Health	What do I do about my girlfriend's anxiety?	Ok here's the situation, this may get lengthy.    Me and this girl have been going out for 2 months, we're really enamored with one another. She has been diagnosed with PTSD and GAD and takes meds for it. She has also tried to quit smoking upon my request b/c I can't stand the stuff, and she also has wanted to quit for years as well so she's said I am a good reason for her to. We have had to address the smoking issue numerous times when I she slipped up. I was supportive and encouraging, told her I wouldn't leave her b/c it was hard for her to quit, and i never yelled or shouted in ANY of the situations.    Recently I was changing out the air freshener in her car and found a pack of smokes halfway gone; not 10 minutes prior to this she was singing her praises for how well she was doing. I confronted her about it and she initially lied about it, then owned up to it and said she didn't want to disappoint me.    Now i'm frustrated with the sneaking around, and the lying; so i cut the filters off. I used a regular kitchen cutting board and a chopping knife which was about 4.5 inches long. She flips out! I understand and admitted later on that what I did was immature. But she isn't mad, her anxiety has taken over and she is now convinced I am this terrible monster who's going to start hitting her when i get upset. We decided to take a break. We talked on the phone last week and she's still scared. I've been understanding, humbled

I am a 24-year-old who for the past 3 days has experienced left shoulder/arm pain which has seemed to get progressively worse  when I try to move it at all. I am left-handed, so my left arm is definitely used more than my right. I moved about 4 weeks ago, which involved some heavy lifting...but I didn't experience any pain like this before now. I also drive alot for my job, since I work with clients and have to go and meet them, and I use my left arm and hand more predominantly with driving, as well as do tons of handwriting/notes for my work. I am not sure if it is a simple case of strain/sprain...or if it could be a rotater cuff issue. I have plans to visit a chiropractor this week..but wanted some advice from others on what it sounds like. The pain has also been radiating up my neck and down my arm.

I guess you will need to know more, or you will say go see your GP, well the only problem is i hate answering questions about myself. Also i've changed i used to be so loud and social but now i'm shy and lonely, could this be because my friends recently kicked me out of the group, but even around them i was lonely and grew silent.

It works faboulus on him, and I really want something the same that won't effect him or cause addition or abuse later. So the ped put him on clonidine 0.1mg in the am and 0.05mg with lunch, plus he changed the adderall to only 10mg in the am and no more. I am seeing absolutely no change, in fact in one week he had 2 referrals at school, and he is a walking zombie, or should I say a hyper zombie. The ped doesn't want to try anything else yet, it's been one month, and he won't give him more adderall either. I'm ready to get a different doctor, one that will give him his regular meds again because I honestly don't know what else to try. I want my son normal, not drugged or out of control. any suggestions? also, he has 00000 problems with sleep

There are a lot of emotional obstacles in my life and anxiety and depression prevent me from completing schoolwork even though I used to be a perfect student a few years ago.    I've been in therapy for a few years and am on a few different medications already. I still can't approach an assignment without freaking out and losing all ability to focus and organize my thoughts.    I'm so desperate that I'm willing to try just about anything. I've heard hypnosis can work for things like smoking and bad eating habits. Has anyone tried hypnosis or know anyone who has?     Were the experiences positive or negative?

I'm getting my wisdom teeth out on Friday and I have to have a small piece of my jaw removed in one spot so it's going to be painful and I'm being put to sleep. I was told I have to have someone drive me, but I've moved to school and none of my friends have cars, so my roommate is taking the day off to come with me and look after me after (part of what the clinic asks for) and we're going to take a taxi home after my surgery.       I've had teeth out before, but they were just simple extractions. I've never been put to sleep, and never had to have any pieces of bone chipped away or anything like that.       The clinic told me I could eat semi solid foods that day (just nothing hard or crunchy but solids are OK as long as they are fairly soft.. bread, cooked veggies, that kind of stuff), but I'm going to take full advantage of it and I've stocked up on pudding. :)      What else should I do to prepare and what should I expect?

It is now a month since it happened. On the day that I had felt some thing so strange, I was sleeping with my brother. Suddenly I woke up. My body temperature was soo high. I had a bunch of saliva in my mouth. I felt stiffness around my shoulders. I also felt as if some thing has pierced through my back and left abdomen. I also felt some thing around my anus. I didn't return to my bed. The next day, I packed all my stuffs and went to my family's house. I just told my brother that I want to do some thing with my sister and that I won't be with him any more. He didn't ask me hard. The next night I felt the same thing. I salivated, heated ...all the things I said earlier. The other thing, I noticed some form of impotence. I almost lost interest in sexual stuffs. I just show indifference. Now I am fine with the salivation and the stiffness. But I regularly heat around my abdomen. And still I am impotent.       What I think is that my brother has done something on me. He may have inoculated some thing to my body. I also remember that he has boiled some milk and invited me to drink when I get home. But what did he do and why, I don't know. I have seen a doctor and he told me that all what I say is a nightmare, and the impotence is due to stress. I have never had a sign of impotence before. Besides I am very happy with my life and nothing worries me. There is no any chance that I can become impotent psychologically.       What do you think has happened to me? What do you advise me? Although I didn't told this to any one, I am burning inside. I am starting to hate my brother. Please help me before i get to the wrong track.

For the past week I've been feeling incredibly low and as if nothing matters but sleeping and getting through the days, I've distanced myself from my friends at uni so much that they've started to not bother including me in things that they do (they didn't much before but now they've really stopped bothering), I feel annoyed with them all the time and ended up having a go at my close friend for literally NO reason at all. I've been crying on and off everyday this week and haven't even bothered revising for my exam tomorrow as I feel there's no point.   I just wanted a second opinion, as I haven't talked to anyone about this yet, I was wondering if it could be due to being on the pill microgynon for 3 packs in a row (due to a holiday)? Seeing as that pill has made me experience feelings of depression before that slowly got less and less, but now I feel as though everything is hopeless, still I don't want this to be a case of me overreacting to what might only be a simple change of pill.       I have felt like this before but never for this long and I'm just looking for a second opinion, or if anyone else has experience. No hateful comments and replies please - you wouldn't like it if you were asking for help. Thank you

20090225051440AA4GhTP	Health;Mental Health	Trying to overcome Social Anxiety and Agoraphobia?	I have been suffering from panic attacks, social anxiety and agoraphobia now for over a year, and for the past 6 months I have been trying to overcome them but finding it impossible. I first went to my doctor who recommended cognitive therapy which I agreed could work so I booked myself in and at the end of all the therapy sessions I was over my agoraphobia but not my panic attacks and social phobia, so I went back to my doctor who prescribed me citalopram as it was supposed to be good, I am now taking this once a day and although it has helped me somewhat it isn't dealing with the problem head on.   I now work 4 hours per evening but finding it really hard to socialize and remain calm at work, I get paranoid and anxious all the time, I cannot tell the difference between playful banter and general bullying but all I know is I get confused and I don't know how to behave, so I instead I tend to be quiet and try to fade into the background and I think people notice this so they target me more as they see me as weak, but if I stand up for myself they might see me as being weird as they could only be playing when I think they are being rude.   Aside from all that I stopped seeing all my old friends as they all took drugs so I have no friends, and I have never had a girlfriend and probably never will due to my social ineptness.   So here I am on the earth, a 19 year old male, with no friends, not much of a life, no future wife and no hope, and not much of a life.

I think my social anxiety could be being caused by something more serious such as asperges or some form of schizophrenia, but then I could just be overreacting, or suffering from hypochondria.

20090225052937AAVdoXe	Health;Dental	Why does the same tooth keep falling out?	I lost my baby teeth way back when.  Then, in high school, I had one tooth that looked like it had a cavity that was eating away at it from all sides (brown)--but it doesn't hurt like a cavity.  It only started hurting when another tooth began to come in from above it; then, the gums around that tooth began driving me nuts until the old adult tooth fell out and the new one coming in from the top replaced it.        Now, this second "adult" tooth has been, again, looking like a cavity is eating away at it from different angles.  There's another random tooth coming in behind it.  Again, the gums around this tooth are swelling and driving me nuts!  I just want to pull the darn thing out!      Has this happened to anyone else?  I've searched Google several times and can't find out what is happening.  I'm overseas and don't speak the language very well, so I'm not comfortable going into the dentist.  It'll be another six months before I get the chance to go home.      Any ideas of what is happening and how I can relieve the pain/swelling?

I was just put back on Adderall XR Friday as my ADD is causing problems in my adult life and I decided to retake meds, I have only taken it for 2 days and it is the spansule type medication, but I cannot tell I have taken anything.  No motivation, still sleepy, unable to focus.  Just wondering if it took awhile to "build-up" in system and how long before you started getting some relief?  I appreciate your help so much

I forced them to click constantly for a few years and stopped only last week.  For the last year I’ve been forcing my knees to click also. I could only stop if I was satisfied to end them the way that I wanted where it feels right and evenly clicked. Now I’ve got them all even I’m never comfortable and I think about every move I make. Today I walked on the icy snow and slipped and because I didn’t walk the way I normally would I feel that I have to get all the clicks out of my knees and start over and have a fresh walk otherwise they would constantly feel wrong. I felt a lot more free and able to do things when I was clicking my knees and ankles as I knew that I still had to get them even etc.  I know that this must be hard for anyone to understand but I know what I mean and I can only start living once I’m satisfied.

20090203144935AAf7pVR	Health;Mental Health	I am so insecure dont know what to do.....?	Hi there guys      Sorry this is gonna be a long one and i will try to make as much sense as possible.      Right to start i am 17 weeks pregnant and my husband is away in Canada with the army for 3 months back on the 31st of March.      When i found out i was pregnant we decided to get married due to security for the baby etc etc, well we had only been married 3 weeks before he went to Canada and prior to that had been together 5 months.      I have never had trust issue's with any of my partners and i have never felt insecure but i cant shake the insecurities off right now, the other day me and my husband were on msn chatting and on web cam to each other, i noticed he went to sit next to some other guy, later to find out that the guy was on webcam to the cleaner on the site (this guys been trying to get laid by her since he went there) out there and watching her have her boobs etc etc out i could see my husband was looking at something every now and then but i didn't take any notice until the next day he had mentioned what this girl was doing i then put 2 and 2 together and asked him outright were you watching that girl flaunt herself? his response was yes! i started to get very upset and said how would he like it if i was watching men do things like that, i got no comment and he started to get really bolshy with me for saying how upset i was about him doing it least of all when he was online talking to me.      The trust was never a 100% as we had been together a short while and trust is something that builds over time, my husband has been pestering me to do sexual things over the cam for him and i told him i don't feel comfortable doing them and he has made me feel utterly guilty about not doing it, i feel awful that i cannot satisfy his needs and am so scared as i am not doing anything that his frustration and the temptations will get too much for him.      I want to trust him a 100% but i just cant everyday im thinking perhaps hes doing the same thing as the other guy on the webcam etc etc, he says that he married me and he is 110% faithful but i feel after him checking out some trashy downgrading lass over the cam has sent my trust tumbling.      I am being treated for prenatal depression at the moment and the one person i could do with no worries about is my biggest.      I am probably overreacting but i just cannot get past the insecurities of him being away from me, i love him dearly and i know he really loves me but i am not sure how strong he actually is. I am so scared that he will do something out there with another women i have never felt like this before and don't know why i am now, i have sent him a email explaining how upset i am (have not had a reply) but i think he will hate me for being truthful with him about what he did and how much it upset me, he did say that the girl was making a fool of herself but he would say that wouldn't he? and he said he only looked coz all the other lads were too but there not married and not got a baby on the way. I don't think he realises how much this has sent my trust downhill and i was building it up.      I don't know where to go from here, i don't want him upset because he knows i cannot trust him 100% but then i cant handle the pressure of this on my shoulders.      Does anyone have any advice. I could do with some kind words i feel so alone without him here and with the insecurities i am a mess.      I hope this makes sense.

20090203143019AAyD93T	Health;Diet & Fitness	Can I lose weight with diet and cardio workouts alone? ?	I've been struggling with my weight for a long time - When I started high school I was overweight according to my doctor...but to me, I looked pretty good! Though - I always was going on different fad diets.       I went on a medication (several) for depression close to the end of my freshman year of high school and over the next few years gained a LOT of weight. I probably gained 80lbs by the time high school was over. I discontinued the use of the medications (i never felt i was correctly diagnosed, and i'm happier now that i'm not on them) - and I lost an amazing 20lbs in the first two or three months off the meds.      This past year has been very difficult for me. I'm 21 years old, and I just purchased my own condo (with my boyfriend) in october of 2008. Mainly to get away from my abusive step father. This past year was very difficult and I gained a lot of weight, and I am now the heaviest I've ever been.      I've been doing wonderfully the past 2 weeks going to the gym. I've gone to the gym 7 out of the past 10 days. And even though my eating habits werent too bad - i've done little things to improve them. (eating out less - sometimes the salads i think are healthy have more calories than my boyfriends burger...replacing a lot of carbs at meal times with veggies instead...etc..)         At the gym, I usually stay in the upstairs area on the cardio machines. I usually do the elliptical (my favorite, I feel it gives me the best workout), and sometimes i do some tredmill. I feel really self concious going downstairs where the weight machines are.       Will i be able to lose weight if I dont do strength training? I have a 8lb medicine ball at home, when i bought it i thought it was wonderful - now I wish i bought the regular weights. The ball is kind of strange to work with - but if I'll lose weight faster doing it a few days a week at home - i will.

20090203142632AAD9Kmv	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Please help....2 y/o with severe GI issues...don't know what else to do?	I know this is going to be long so please excuse.I don't know where else to go or who to turn to...I am just looking for ideas and/or suggestions.      My 2 y/o son has EXTREME constipation issues.He has since birth.He didn't have his first bowel movement until he was 10 days old.Then at 4 weeks he had projectile vomiting,blood in stool,diarrhea.At that time( 4 weeks old)they changed his formula to neocate and chalked up the vomiting to acid reflux.Ok well then began the constipation he was 2 months old and he didn't poop for 18 days even after suppository's,they had to give him a prescription laxative then he went.The constipation has never resolved and is only getting worse.He has been hospitalized several times.He is below the 2nd percentile for weight(always has been)and has a VERY limited diet.He has severe sensory problems and is developmentally delayed.On a daily basis this is what the poor little guy is given for constipation.   -2 full caps of mira-lax   -1 1/2 tbs of senna(little tummy's)   -1 1/2 tbs of mineral oil   -8 oz daily of either pear or apple/prune juice   and he still doesn't go!We are lucky if he goes 1x every 10 days!      He just got out of the hospital AGAIN he had another blockage and they finally did a biopsy of his colon and anal area they were thinking Hircshsprung's (he has every symptom)but we just got the results and they are negative for hircshsprung's.....I am SO UPSET bc now I don't know where that leaves us.In the hospital this is what they did before he pooped...   -they administered something called "go lightly"they guaranteed that thus would make him go they gave it to him via NG tube-a gallon and a half later they had to stop it.He still didn't go and it only made him more uncomfortable.   -12 enema's every 2 hours for 6 hours-still nothing   -suppositories-still nothing   -barium enema-still nothing   Finally they decided they were going to manually dis-impact him but when they did the xray the poop had moved father back making a dis-impaction impossible.So they put a tube up his butt with a special contrast and finally he pooped.They were all so sure he had this damn hirschsrung's.So before we went to the hospital and he got cleaned out he was only eating Elecare formula,gerber little crunchers,dry cinnamon toast crunch since we have been home and he is no longer so backed up he is eating every thing in his path!Does any one know of some thing else it can be?I am going to bring him to another doc but the issue is where his medical care is in SUPPOSED to be the BEST(ha ha)hospital in our area.What do I do?I feel like he doesn't eat,is always in a bad mood,and is developmentally behind bc he is so constipated and I refuse to give him any more daily laxatives...anyone have any advice or words of wisdom??????What could they be missing?I just don't know how many more days and night I can sit in the hospital and feel like nobody can help him.Why don't his guts work?Thank you for allowing this rant.      P.S. oh yeah I also forgot he also gets a pro biotic.I don't know about spelling but Saccromiss boulvardi supposed to be the mac daddy of pro-biotic's

20090203141654AAO4lss	Health;Men's Health	Why does a man lose sexual interest after ejaculation?	I'm not a pervert. I want to understand this biologically. After a man discharges semen during sex, his sexual interest disappears. What is the connection between a liquid in the body (i.e semen) and an emotion (sexual arousal)? In other words, how is it that one of the strongest natural impulses simply vanishes the moment this fluid leaves the body? Personally, I think this is a very pure state : a type of sex-nuetrality - i.e to be neither interested in, nor repulsed by sex. I would also like to know if this sex-nuetral state can be achieved/replicated without actually engaging in sex.

So I can't believe I am asking this, but my niece 18 is afraid and she just called me freaking out, I don't have an answer.

She didn't know it was there until to late.   She knew this guy has herpes, they are close friends not the issue.      She calls me crying thinking she now has herpes and I don't know the answer as to if it is possible. I told her schedule an appointment with her OB, but she just saw her Friday so my sister would ask why she is going and she doesn't want to tell her and cause issue with the guy.

20090203141557AAIfpIH	Health;Diet & Fitness	Easy Ten Points all i need is some tips?	Hi! im in the eighth grade. i wrote this essay, and i would like to know what people think (it is for health class). no rude comments please. Thanks!      Organic Food     People should eat more organic food for many reasons. One is that it is better than the environment. Another is that it is better for you. The only problem with organic foods is that many untrue rumors are behind them. Many people do not understand what organic means, which makes it more difficult to understand and rumors do not help.    Eating organic simply means crops grown with out pesticides (chemicals), biotechnology, artificial fertilizers, and irradiation (a type of radiation meant to kill bacteria).  Eating organic foods does not put unwanted chemicals inside your body. This is how it makes you healthier. Organic foods are better for the environment because it does not use radiation and chemicals.    Rumors throw off everyone when it comes to organic food: its not good for you, it costs too much, how do I know its organic, and so on. Eating organic food is better for you. With the rumors about it costing too much, it is not so untrue. It does cost more than non-organic food, but not by much. If something is better for your body, why not spend a dollar or less more?   On the question about knowing whether or not it is organic, that answer is simple. All one has to do is just check if it is passed organic by the United States Department of Agriculture, or more commonly known as the USDA. On organic food there is a sticker that says whether or not that food is organic (the picture above). If the sticker is on the food, it is organic.   In conclusion, eating organic food is better for everything: your body, the environment, even the plants and animals around. Everyone should chose organic to live healthier, and have better tasting food.

She's in her mid-sixties, and there's concern about cancer, and whether or not she'll survive it if that's the case...I don't know what to say. What DO I say?       And even more so...if his mother dies, I seriously...I question his ability to cope. I mean, I'm sure he'll be ok, it's just...I know him, and I have a terrible feeling about this. If this happens, how would I bring him out of it? Frankly...I'm scared to death for him for his family. What should I do? I'm no psychic, but sometimes you can just see things coming and...I just don't know what to do. He's completely shut down over smaller things. How would he react to this? I don't want to think that the worst will happen. I hope and feel that she'll make it. But...what if she doesn't? What will happen to Adrian?

Ok so im a 20 year old female, and for the past 6months or so probably a little longer than that actually i've had this dull headache that happens as soon as i wake up and lasts until i fall asleep at night. I feel more tired when i wake up then when i went to bed, and because of the dull headache i have all day long i cant concentrate on any of my school work. I lay around and im so unproductive because i feel like im tired during the day but not enough to fall asleep.       I was recently on the generic brand of zoloft but i stopped taking it about 4 months ago, i didn't feel like it was doing anything for me and i still had these same symptoms.       My iron is also fine and im always making sure im getting my B vitamins...however i do consume about 300mg of caffeine a day, could that be the problem? coffee doesn't make these headaches go away though.       HELP PLEASE!!!

20090203145116AACyefF	Health;Mental Health	Whats happened me =/?	Heyy!   I've been meaning to ask this for a while!   I seriously don't know what has happened to me....   I'm 16 and until about 4 months ago everything was perfect!   My life couldn't have been better I was popular, had the most amazing friends I spent every second of the day either with them or on the phone to them, every weekend was spent partying.   I was bubbly, hyper and looked forward to every day!   Then about 4 months ago i grew apart from my friends since then everythings gone downhill.   I feel really down.   I don't feel like talking to anyone in school because I feel like they don't want to listen to me.   I rarely talk and I spend ages staring into blank spaces without even noticing it.   I don't have a clue whats going on around me.   I'm totally zoned out.   I have no motivation what so ever.   I can't see point in doing anything =/.      I know it sounds like I'm just being really negative about everything.   But I've spent the last 4 months trying not to be and it hasnt worked >.<.   All i want to be is the old happy me!      So could you please take the time to suggest what's wrong with me?   Or any ideas on how I can get my spirits up again!      Thankoo in advance :]   x

20090203143010AA7OYWS	Health;Mental Health	There is no reasoning with me anymore I hate everything.?	No more, you say I need help yeah maybe I do, but when I'm on a tight budget as an apprentice earning **** all money, I need it for other things, it's okay...really being alone lol I'm fine.      The yahoo answers community have helped me, but you just state the obvious it's not allright and it's very hard for me to get help, virtually no money here.      All of it is going on joining a gym and fixing my hair up.      I've just sick of this...I'm sick of acting like everything is okay.      Now instead of being nice anymore, all of my being is consumed by hatred, and it's making me so angry about everything.      For 6 years I have tried making friends, throughout high school and work and cadets, and nothing works, I push them all away when I clearly need that caring factor here.      All I get is nothing, my mother has had enough of me talking about negative, negative, negative is what she says, she doesn't want to hear it anymore.      So there you go I've accepted the fact, my life is going to be a long and hard road.      You don't think I have tried to make friends, it's because you can't have a joke with me no sense of humor well I wonder why I always look angry or sad because I am depressed, because nothing makes me happy anymore.      I'm just going through the motions, like Faith she never had a caring factor in her life off Buffy in turn turned her a bit crazy.      It's not fair anymore, everybody is saying it's me, it's my aggressiveness, it's my stern look all the time with no humor.      And you wonder why I'm not approachable.      Maybe while I at it, I should ******* kill somebody that would truly fit the bill.      So can anybody tell me why the **** can't I make friends, because right now my pain, these feelings, it's not normal, it hurts me.      I hate everything, why can't people understand and become my friends instead of being pushed away.      What do I do..., is it me, is the wrong environment,      Am I doomed to live life alone forever, I'm only 18, I'm a girl who is becoming hateful towards everything.      It's not stopping there either.

20090225063851AA2Gvwk	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Do i have an eating disorder?	It all started last summer when i would eat normally (quite a lot actually) and just make myself throw up after dinner. Then i stopped that and just ate normally for a while until a few months ago i decided i wanted to make a drastic change and decided on my weight. I looked up pro-ana sites and all i could think about was losing weight. I've gone threw several phases - making myself sick firstly and then chew-spitting all my food. None of these seemed to make me lose much weight and now i've conciously stopped eating all together. I don't eat before 5pm and just have black tea, diet lemonade and coke, and water. I also take laxatives just incase. When then evening comes a few times i binge which can often take cals up to 1000kcal - but this is only when im really really tired and almost unconcious of it. I try my best and tell myself not to eat at all though.   I've been too scared to get on the scales since this started 3 weeks ago so i don't know if i've lost any weight or not but my first thought and last thought and most of them in between in the day are of food and losing weight.   Do i have an eating disorder or am i just obsessive over food like most women?

20090225064056AAziT63	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Ear Infection or TMJ ? Confused !?	Hi all,      For almost three months now have had what is thought to be an ear infection.Went to doc who said my ear drum was pretty red and he thought it was possibly labarynthitis (sp?) . He gave me a course of augmentin i believe and said it should clear.Went back three weeks later and he said it was still red and maybe as pills hadn't worked we should try an ear spray so tried that and that hasn't seemed to have worked.I still have an intense burning in the ear which radiates around the side towards my eye.However around the same time as the problems started my jaw started clicking on the same side (tmj symptom i believe) and i mentioned it to the doc but he didn't seem interested in it.What i would like to know is can tmj make the ear drum red or does it point to two different things happening ? I feel very dizzy,lightheaded and in pain and have to wait another 10 days to see doc so any help would really be appreciated as its been nearly 3 months now without relief.Many thanks in advance.

The palm area between the thumb and wrist has been quite painful (when doing push ups) for the past couple of weeks.

20090225064415AAEs1jP	Health;Diet & Fitness	Is it possible for me to gain some resemblance of a flat stomach without surgery?	m, 25 y/o, 6'1".      I started at 430lbs a little less than three years ago.  Through a lot of dieting, and a lot of working out, I'm currently down to 209lbs.  My scale at home puts me in the 15-16% body fat range.  Everyone has been telling me that I'm losing way too much weight, and that the hanging belly and flabby inner thighs I'm left with will never go away without surgery.  It makes sense, considering that my stomach is covered with heavy amounts of stretch marks. If needed to know, I'm running 8m daily, and in the gym daily rotating what sections of my body I workout each day, the lone exception that I work abs everyday.  Any help?

I feel bad everytime we have sex cuz it doesnt sound like she is getting pleasure it just sounds like she is in pain the whole time.  Plus it takes me awhile to get off, like 20 minutes minimum, so I might just have to get used to not having an orgasm and hurting her in the process.  Any ideas of what to do???

He has lied about other babysitters "beating" him, my 2 year old, and my six month old.      He comes from an abusive background (really messed up mother) so maybe this is contributing to it?!

20090203145427AAIpUB4	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	If I boil urine, will it rid it of any infection?	I have a urinary tract infection (UTI). I have always been prone to these since I was a little girl, therefore, I'm always sure of when I have one. I do not, however, carry health insurance at the present moment.   I was planning on peeing into a condom and placing the condom into a thermos of boiling water. My friend, who has insurance, is going to the doctor claiming she has a UTI. When she is asked for a urine sample for verification, she is going to use the condom of my urine to fill it.     If I go to the doctor, it will cost me $100 for them to tell me I have an infection that I already know I have...and then another $50-$60 for an antibiotic. It should only cost her around $30 for everything, of which I will cover.    My question is...If I place the urine filled condom in a thermos of boiling water, is there anyway the heat could rid the urine of the infection? Or will there be any other complications I should be worried about?

Here are my symptoms ~   *Severe nausea (five years, but in the last year has grown increasingly worse)   *Severe abdominal pain (last few months)   *Loss of appitite and painful boloating after eating (1 year)   *Black stools (past few weeks, I have not taken pepto bismal, ect. for months)   *30lb weight loss in 3 months (unintentional)   *Night fevers (last few months)   *Severe headaces (last few months)   *Dizziness/Fatigue/Blurred vision (last few months)      I am currently taking 25mg Promethagan once a day and 5ml of Zantac twice a day and they helped at first but not any more.      I have had tons of blood tests, some urine tests, and one stool test to test for a bacterial infection. No scans, mris, ect.      What is wrong with me? I just want to get better!

20090203150409AAWuNnj	Health;Diet & Fitness	I'm afraid about if my bodybuilding might influence my little brother... what do you think?	alright, i'm 16, i'd like to call myself a teen bodybuilder but i've yet to compete so i won't take away that title from those who've taken that one step i haven't and earned it.      i work out about 1 hour and 15 minutes on average everyday, around 8-9 hours a week total.      my little brother is 7 years old, obviously too young to understand much, but old enough to know what i'm doing when he sees me lifting weights or using the equipment my family has in our basement.      at first, i thought it wasn't going to be a problem if he watched, i was even hoping that if he grew up seeing fitness as a good thing then it might even keep him away from drugs later on. but then i saw him trying to do some of my workouts using a dumbell he found, forget how much but it was iron, not the material they use for physical therapy dumbells.       He dropped the weight on himself before i could say something, thank the lord he only ended up with a little bruise.      i keep catching him trying to do things with the weights in the basement, and always stop him, and now whenever i'm working out i'll yell at him if he comes anywhere near the basement door so he can't see what i'm doing.      i've talked to him a few times, but he doesn't understand how dangerous it is at age 7 to even go into a room with those kind of heavy iron weights. I got my mom and dad to talk to him a bit, but i don't think that helped.      i'm worried that he might hurt himself, especially because in two years i'll be gone and all that equipment will be there with no one to keep him away from it and he'll only be 9 then.      advice on what to do?

So i was looking at my feet about four days ago and i relized my left pinky toes was really swollen. There was no pain and i couldn't figure out what was causing it to swell.

I'm wondering what the heck is going on! I researched it and i found something that sounded similar it's called chilblains. I'm not completely sure though. Also on my right pinky it looks like there's a tiny bit mark from a spider or something but if it's a spider why would all my other toes on both feet be reacting too. Any answers?
