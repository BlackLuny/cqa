urCMCb1laa	Are you talking about 'Makeup Artist Magazine' ?  I have a subscription to that mag I dont know If you build your Makeup Kit with it but Once in awhile They do send you samples of Makeup Or even makeup brushes (which i Love the brushes they send)
EIXlcmyRaa	well it all starts with your hair.   a Center part will put focus on the nose  Side bangs draws eyes to the lips  Heavy/straight-across bangs bring attention to the eyes     To bring out your blue eyes using pink, gold or silver eye shadow will make them appear to be brighter.     Applying bronzer to the bridge of your nose and your chin, then your nose will appear slightly thinner.  Depending upon where one places the bronzer, it changes the shape of the nose.|`|HzKEkMgvaa	Hi, I have a couple great tips from you, they are from "Robert Jones" the make up artist.      First to accent your eys, use eyeliner on the top and bottom lids, and use the darkest mascara you can.  Also try a lighter lipstick so that the attention will be on your eyes and not lips and nose.    Next,  use a bronzer and gently sweep it on the sides of your nose to make it appear less wide.      Check the website for moretips, good luck!    http://www.simplebeaute.com/|`|icqCCyhiaa	get a nose job done|`|yzIB8Cbiaa	eyeliner and mascara! too much eyeshadow will make you look weird.  For your nose, brush bronzer down the bridge of your nose and from head on, it will look slimmer|`|q030BUvkaa	Gold eye shadow goes well with blue eyes, and so does brown. Just use mascara and eye liner too i guess.  But i'm sure your nose isn't as bad as you think it is!  Good luck!:)|`|O0HO1If0aa	use a light brown (not tan) eye shadow on the lid. use a dark brown in the crease. blend in well. Wet the tip of eyeshadow brush and use dark brown eyeshadow as eyeliner! top and bottom. brush black mascara on top lashes only. trying to get more on the roots than on the tips. Also, a light lipgloss will make your eye pop! =] hope this helps!   oh and not to be mean Eliza, but she asked for help with making her eyes stand out. not making herself look orange
9ZnYAfi7aa	what does it look like  http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...    ?
6Ss31wyBaa	hmm I don't know. They make some specifically for your chin (Im sure you are using those though). Make sure you are wetting your chin really good with warm water before applying it, and try not to move your chin.|`|aJ1aaOi9aa	there are ones meant for your chin..warm it up with hot water and apply it with hot water.
dHkvVlONaa	Usually its a temporary piercing, as in they usually get it just for a photoshoot or something, then take it out.    I don't know how much it would hurt when you put your shirt on, but I assume it would be kinda painful if it was like the same day you got it pierced or something.    And I think they're really cool looking.|`|lPagcZ2raa	people just like piercings.|`|XiOIBwbPaa	that would hurt to wear anything for a while, I think they look neat, but a little trashy, it kind of to me gives off a sluttish appeal (DON'T SAY ANYTHING TO ME) I'm not saying its slutty its just the whole corset thing that suppose to be like sexy lingerer. I think its a little weird, I really don't understand it myself either.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Corset piercings are generally temporary as it's virtually impossible to heal the piercings. People get them done for special occasions or for photo shoots.     People get them because they like them. I've done many in my career, even a few for runway shows or fashion shoots.|`|dtcH8CrQaa	obviously once its healed, it wouldnt hurt to touch or rub against it (like any other piercing). I know this gothic girl in one of my classes who has this piercing and she wears like short tops to show it off or baggy shirts. she changes up the ribbon to like chains and stuff too. and its not as tight as it looks in that picture so theres really not that much strain. i personally wouldnt get this piercing but everyone has their own style i suppose :/|`|rtx0YQDJaa	these corset piercings are not meant to be permanent, they are for piercing enthusiasts and the lace is removed once the photo is taken.  alot of people find this type of piercing to be very beautiful and they, as are you, are entitled to their opinions. but please do a little research into things you don't know about before you decide to judge others for their tastes..it's rude.|`|UppsoSZPaa	Not too sure how you could wear a shirt or of the concept of this set of piercings!    I agree with you; kinda gross looking!|`|7vk4xoKZaa	OUCH! Why would anyone wanna go through with that? It looks like it could get pulled out very easily! It does look very unnatural and "trashy" though. Not to mention very painful and it does not look nice at all. I don't understand the concept either!|`|sFtPK9MDaa	It probably looks weird, cause shes a little chunky but I like them. And I don't think there forever. If you google images for corset piercings you could find a prettier looking piercing (my favorite are the side corsets) and search You Tube as well because theres a few good videos with these piercings in it. Actually, I don't think its trashy. People like what they like no big deal.|`|c5anDswjaa	A trashy piercing?  I didnt know there was such thing as a trashy piercing, but ok.. They are just piercings, there is not really a concept to it.. Why does anyone get anything pierced? 98% of the time its because they like the way it looks, no big deal.. To each his own
adyNCp6eaa	maybe a white spaghetti strap dress with brightly colored flowers, and some frills maybe at the end, medium length(to the knees) Its kind of not too fancy but not too casual either, good for if you dont know what attire they want you to wear. Thats what i wore to my aunt's wedding & i think i looked great! Although the wedding was in the winter lol, i didnt have anything else that looked like a good dress for a wedding, the rest of my dresses were black.|`|kmXuhlJJaa	you could wear a cute little sun dress with a simple cardigan and cute sandles...thts what i would wear but if you want you could research more into what floridas weather is like during that time.|`|nZmr2nZaaa	Um how about t a spring outfit!!|`|u7o75zipaa	I would wear a cute, fairly simple summer dress.   You can team it with sandles or heels, and perhaps bring a cropped cardigan or shawl type top :) x
UrYYKkGoaa	That used to happen to me, and I fixed it by training myself to open my squinty eye when I was being photographed. I practiced in the mirror until I could recognise my squinty eye opening correctly by the way it felt. As a side effect of this, I gained so much more control of the muscles around my eye (my right eye, btw), that I could raise my right eyebrow independently, like Spock (I could always do it with my left eyebrow, but now I can do it with each).|`|lPagcZ2raa	its hardly noticable. just don't smile like that in pictures and if you are smiling like that in real life trust me no one will notice, and if they do they'll probably think it's cute.|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Wear sunglasses. Always|`|pmsINMWgaa	Smile a lighter smile,, i get kinda the same thing but i need glasses :S so have and eye test and smile smaller :D|`|TdGbIDH8aa	I don't think it looks bad at all I think it's kinda cute  don't worry about it|`|t6jJJSt9aa	I don't think you squint when you smile, I think you have a great smile. Don't worry about it and keep smiling. =)    Gareth
UrYYKkGoaa	Pilates will make your waist bigger. Dumbbell or barbell squats will bulk up your bum and thigh muscles.
CHCPnvksaa	It would look awesome. The layers would give your hair so much more volume and depth, and at the same time it would lighten up the weight on your head. You'd want to do long layers though if your hair is at the middle of your back, maybe starting at your chin. If you went shorter than that, your hair would look very thin.|`|PWkWptVuaa	Yeah, i think it would. Just try anyway!  Better than regreting or wondering.|`|kcehIfjkaa	Yes a lot of layers would look good.    A lot better than straight.|`|kMsShtwpaa	i think it would look good :)|`|pprrcLVhaa	well i have a friend who has the EXACT  hair you have and got many many layers and she looks beatiful i think it will look very good on you :)|`|yvvsrimNaa	tht wuld look so CUTE!!|`|455c0e34f52d6e363e31945ed99b03f5aa	It would look really nice actually and it would lighten up the thickness of your hair as well.  Go for it.|`|6Ss31wyBaa	Yes look at these picture, it would be somewhat similar|`|t9KytOdgaa	Yes. Check out this pic. Her hair looks hot and she has the same coloring as you.    http://fileserver.glam.com/glampress/bea...
MRtgpHGwaa	I use the Natural stuff in the hari dye section, and it comes out a nice color, not some crazy one. Any dye will work, really. And I would get it it at wallmart wallgreens (cheaper =p ) Hope i helped! =o))|`|lN9jcKYhaa	CLOROX|`|4Xmr0Yjlaa	well i have dark hair on my arms to but i dont think u can bleach it what i do is shave my arms which probrably sounds weird >:D >.|`|GZ88jyP4aa	Do you really want your friends to make fun of you for having white fuzz on your arms either?  No    Be a man and wax it off!  Or shave..your choice.|`|eZ4ki7aXaa	hmmm its ok babe ur friends are queer anyways.. and im gunna have to look at ur arm pits now i aint gunna lie haha|`|ZftI0W4Eaa	go to boots and look for their hair lightening products they do a cheep range :)
SJLgRqgSaa	beauthy therpay yeah? i did this    theres good beauty schools everywhere    you dont need high grades c and above will get you on level 2  d and below will get you on level 1    there pretty similar, also older people get on level 2.    there are no high school classes that help    its simple xx|`|u7o75zipaa	There are good schools for this in most areas.  You don't need high grades to get in (I live in Scotland, my friend got in with her Standard Grades which were General level at highest).  There's not really any classes you should take for it. I guess art could show off your creativity, but I don't think it'll really make a difference.    You should get an appointment with your careers advisor. They'll know what exactly would be the best for you to do, and they'll give you plenty of information.    Nicole.x|`|xNfhUVr8aa	i didnt even know there was such a thing ;]  mmm.  well my guess is it has nothing to do with your grades.  but as i said before i didnt even know there was such a thing ;]    sorry if i didnt help muchh ;/|`|GygOv3dIaa	Give your school advisor some work =D
nVQGpvuoaa	You should not go short. Because of your face shape. Your face is really long. What you should do is get short layers in the front and layer it all around but other than that let it go mid length.|`|t9KytOdgaa	I wouldn't cut it short. I think with your face shape, longer styles would be more flattering.|`|BRIeyc8Raa	i think youre better off with mid-length hair and side parts. what you have there isnt really working either .
154dzJ1Faa	It's a simple matter of holding the hair straight and letting it dry in that position.  It will stay that way.  Once you get water (moisture) back in the hair, your hair will revert back to its normal state.    When your hair is wet or damp, you need to stretch it out as straight as you can.  Normally, this is done with a special brush, and while drawing the brush down the strand, hot air is following close behind to dry the hair.  This is a slow process, and needs to be done methodically and completely.  Any moisture left in the hair, and it will slowly change shape before your eyes.    There are precautions about using any heat implement, so take heed of them in respect to use of the blow dryer.  There are techniques you need to be aware of as well.    There are some hair products, notably shampoo, that will make your hair absorb a lot of water and will not let it go.  This makes the hair fatter and feel fuller, but it holds more water than it should.  You will not be able to make the hair straight, or make it curl, which ever you want.  The hair needs to be in better condition.    The ends are always the hardest to get straight because they escape the tension they are under in the bristles of the brush.  Use a large round brush or a flat paddle brush to keep them as straight as you can.  A slight bend (but not a curl) on the ends does make the style look a lot better.  And you need lots of practice and patience to do this well.  When completely done, it will stay that way for 2-3 days at least.    One other thing you can try (if you have the time) is to wrap the hair smoothly all around the head, using the head like a large roller.  Do this after you have blown the hair straight.  Make sure it is very smooth and evenly wrapped around the head.  Cover with plastic wrap and leave for as long as you can, overnight, or under a heat dryer for 30 min or more.  Let cool, and remove and brush out.  This is called the Dominican Wrap.. and it may work for you as well, but does take time.|`|E8k3sERAaa	mine does the same, got natrually wavey hair sounds like you do too, you have to use straightners after youve dried it, ghds work the best for me.|`|IwXy8KLVaa	Heyya okay i just got a really good blow dryer that comes with a straightening attachment and it works really really well. I would say to try that and try using a straightening shampo and conditionar and see if that works and if not you might try to just straigten the ends when you are done it should work :-)  I hope this helps and best of luck :-)|`|AA12315431	If you don't have naturally straight hair , which you don't, it all comes down to heat and tension. Depending on the thickness of your hair you would either need a large round brush or a flat paddle brush if your hair is fine and thin.|`|OxwWclcmaa	I have really curly hair and I keep it straight by adding an anti frizz serum and a heat protection spray to my wet hair before dividing my hair into sections and drying it using a large round brush pointing the nozzle downwards.   When it is completely dry and straight I run a straightener through it. I then spray with a hair spray or scrunch a liitle wax into the top and ends|`|IAYeIRcOaa	that is somethign we'll never know... lmaooo|`|9W9l8HAuaa	brush it with a comb or thick bristled brush while drying    let it dry or dry it then straighten it    if all else fails buy a night cap and put it in that if it's long|`|jXblvTG0aa	FLAT IRON!|`|4Xmr0Yjlaa	well that happenes to me all the time i always brush it real at strait and if it wont go i usually put hair gel at the ends of it or hair spray and keep rushing it and then it will go strait i hope that helps :D

MPX0f5jzaa	If you don't care for citrus, try something by Salvatore Ferragamo (sp?) or Karl Lagerfeld.  Or go to the department store counter and ask for something more earthen/spicy/woodsy.  Keep in mind however that such scents are mainly worn in fall and winter, with everyone going back to brighter citrus scents in spring and summer.|`|3pIWS4J3aa	I like remingtons models electric shavers I got mine at http://www.electricshavers4less.com they seem to have good prices.|`|SJLgRqgSaa	citrus scent is sexy!!    wear d and g or something xx
8rTAfF1maa	there IS no natural way to grow bigger boobs. it all depends on how your hormones work.|`|1SnI86BIaa	gain weight  otherwise no|`|lPagcZ2raa	no there isnt. you could try some excersises that work out that area, which may add some muscle and make them look bigger but apart from that no.|`|7vk4xoKZaa	Unfortunately no I have not heard of any ways although that would be awesome! Try asking a personal trainer for some exercises to increase your pectoral muscles it may help perk them up a bit. Be careful what exercises though because some may decrease the bust! Other then that if you really want a bigger bust look for some safe surgeries. They are coming out with better implants and surgical techniques all the time! Good luck!|`|sFtPK9MDaa	gain ten pounds and hope it all goes to your boobs. but otherwise I dont think so. just be happy with what you've got.|`|znp0vztUaa	You guys! No one [unless their already skinny or crazy] want to gain weight!  I can tell you that I for one wear around the letter C and how about the numbers 36. I'm working out and doing my own version of up day/down day diet so I can lose [I am so not even overweight, I'd just like to be skinnier than I am] So either wait for yourself to get bigger chest, or get a padded push-up bra so that you look bigger.  =) Hope I helped!|`|KnGJ12cqaa	Implants!|`|fdP9UJOsaa	Gain weight|`|mimykKnhaa	lol i wish|`|xKCkPN8jaa	GET FAT!|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Will it ever end - another breast question!!

They go back to normal when you go off the pill, and it doesn't happen for everyone, but they can become noticeably larger for as long as you stay on the pill.    =)|`|FZfNsNwZaa	try to eat alot of healthy food and get alot of sleep|`|FftR5yToaa	No.
MiyuKZ7vaa	Anything you apply on your skin (cream, cleanser, etc...) takes 28 days to work.   If you are not satisfied after the 28 days then it doesnt suit your skin.  If your break outs dont stop after 2 weeks (maybe its that time of the month) you should not continue.    Hope that helps|`|AA11101361	It's normal to experience some "issues" when you start a new routine.  You have to give it 3 months to see if it's going to make a difference.|`|BKOgIfwHaa	It depends alot on what products you are using and what brand. I know after selling and using Avon products for a few years now, most results can show a difference in as little as 2 weeks and the most irritant I have experienced with them was a tingling and was told that means it was working. The tingling never lasted more than a few minutes. Hope this helps.|`|7vk4xoKZaa	It is normal for your skin to react to something new. You are suppose to keep using it for up to 6 months because sometimes it will take that long for your skin/body to fully adapt to it and work itself out. Don't give up on it yet unless you start getting really terrible breakouts or rashes. Then of course stop its use. But give it time and hopefully it will work out! Good Luck!
AA11101361	A plastic surgeon probably won't do lipo until you're 18.    My youngest laser client was 11.  She and her 13 year old sister were having their underarms, chin and lip done.  They had such a nice mother.  As for cost it depends on what you want done, but you can estimate that a session is upwards of $250.|`|jeX5VZAtaa	Lazor hair probably 14 with parents permission...lipo suction 18.

bdcecff4c5d24df3f626e75937f26e3baa	There is a hair mayonnaise daily conditioner (not the treatment or it would make your hear more grease) that you can use after shampoo (make sure you use a curl defining shampoo, even if your hear is not curly it can help transform your frizz into loose curls), but the final and most important step this:  Comb your hair with a wide teeth comb (during conditioner)  Do not comb your hair when id drying only while wet!  Use a curl defining hair foam (La Coupe has a whole line of curl defining products and is economical that efficient) and squeeze your hair bottom up as if you where trying to make it look shorter.  You may (optional) finish with a touch of frizz control wish is a silicone base product that give your hair further protection from humidity, just make sure you use a drop, rub it  in your hands and kip sculpting with the upwards squeezing of your hair.  One more note: Always comb or brush your hair from the ends working your way up, so you don't mistreat it and break it!

I also have a bob. :)  But, if you tease your hair, just a little, it   give a subtle more adult like appearance. :)|`|4RMInr2raa	dont get blonde strikes i have a friend that have a black bob too and she did that and she said she felt like a white trash whore lol. but she did have red strikes in one time and it looked great!|`|cia9dLy3aa	GO TO THE HOOD AND GET A WEAVE.  !!!!!!  i love you :)
zXHNSohTaa	I use Everyday Minerals too, and you know what I do is just mix it into my moisturizer/daily sunblock to make my own liquid foundation. It's great because I already have a perfect color match of the Mineral stuff which is near impossible for me to find in a regular liquid foundation, and I know it won't break me out because the moisturizer is oil free and the minerals are pretty pure. Also, since you're mixing it yourself, you can make it as sheer or opaque as you like. I usually tap some minerals in my hand, squeeze in the moisturizer, then blend with my fingers till smooth, and apply.

Mineral makeup on oily skin tends to turn orange in my opinion.   For the liquid foundation; get something WATER BASED so it wont add more oil in your pores and make your skin breath... you must finish off with a mattifying powder or normal powder since your skin is oily.    hope that helps!

Totally.  I am around your age.  =]]|`|LREo3Tjpaa	I totally think it is age appropriate. Natural makeup looks great on everyone and since you are young darker makeup would make you look old. i think you should go for it and it's great!|`|mhyL7Qw3aa	Yes it will suit you well.|`|KJG1Syhdaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several products.I would check out the review site at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and look around at the reviews.|`|0UOHex1Maa	Peach-colored make-up is very natural. I think it's great that you wear alot of neutral tones! :) Especially for your ago. Peach eye shadow would look very cute on you.
d6ae8eee5daf6a2257b987d4d0c3352eaa	you should take a better picture where you can actually see your hair... thats my advise|`|FeQvH7q9aa	I agree with the other 2 answers, We would need to have a better picture of your hair to know how to help.|`|N0cmhQYJaa	cant even see your hair really
9UgGwvtlaa	use beigan. dont use commercial hair colors|`|154dzJ1Faa	You shouldn't be using "dye" on hair in the first place.  Dye is for fabrics, and really doesn't work that well on hair.    Faria doesn't make dye, but they do make some tints. (different formula)  However, black is not a very good colour to use.  It is extremely rare to find anyone with true black hair. It will look phony and false on most people that use it. You would be better off using dark brown. There are some very bad ingredients in black that is not in any other colour.  They will react badly with other chemical treatments you may have.  Black is almost impossible to remove with any success.    Just be very careful with that stuff.  Now you know.|`|9QbinaQ7aa	Try garnier nutrisse that is the best i have ever used! ... but No matter what hair color you use, definatly find a shampoo and conditioner( as well as other hair products) that will help hold the color and keep it from fading.  you can go with something cheap from a drug store or walmart, but remember, you get what you pay for. The best i have found is the satinique color capture products.It holds color up to 115% longer and comes with a full money back guarentee!!!!!!   I use it myself and it is amazing!( and it smells great!)  the website is below...check it out!!!!!!!!!!  you might need an IBO number which is 5075587
dxeb0BfBaa	I have used most of these & they aren't bad at all but I would recommend TIGI Catwalk Thickening Shampoo & Conditioner & TIGI Catwalk Thickening Cream. They are quite pricey but the results are well worth it. Shampoo hair twice using a small amount of shampoo & towel dry hair then apply a small amount of the conditioner throughout the hair (from roots to tips, not advised with most conditioners). Leave for 3-5mins & rinse thoroughly. Use 1 or 2 pumps of the thickening cream, rub it between your hands then apply to towel dried hair, imagine you are trying to clean your hands in your hair, use your hair to clean the product from your hands (the correct way to apply product to wet hair). The thickening cream is heat activated so you will need to blow dry the hair with a large round brush taking small sections & starting with the back of your hair. These products should be available on eBay but if not you could try the TIGI Bedhead Superstar Shampoo, Conditioner & Blow-dry Lotion|`|hj952SLyaa	Get the aussie volumising shampoo its amazing!! and straightener your hair and when you do the roots of your hair curl the straighterner abit and it will give you a bounce|`|79F1VhEJaa	i use the victorias secret shampoo and conditioner, it works really well, and what also works good is aussie shampoo and conditioner.
OxwWclcmaa	Maybe you're putting too thick a layer on? I usually put on a thin layer in three strokes if you can. Then when it dries you can put on more if you want. Always top it up with a clear coat too so it doesn't chip.  Hope that helps!|`|SJLgRqgSaa	two very thin layers works better than one thick one. paint them in 3 stripes, one in the middle and then the sides.    xx|`|9W9l8HAuaa	get them done be a pro?  it's not nececcaraly the more expensive brand you use-but the quality  use 2 coats-don't dab it on-brush gently  usee a clear coat

PH3vvbrdaa	Get the wave apparently its really good and makes your skin smooth :D|`|OxwWclcmaa	Sounds strange but if you exfoliate really well in the bath or shower. Then when you get out don'y dry your skin at all but apply Johnsons baby oil and wait for it to dry- takes ages, I think that makes your skin really smooth|`|Xb7kaCkiaa	for face - exfoliate and moisturise! don't scrub too hard. always pat dry (same with arms)  legs - exfoliate and rinse under warm water to open pores, then shave. rinse with cold water to close pores up, pat dry and moisturise again or perhaps some oil such as Johnson's baby lotion.  feet - at night get rid of dead skin with a pumice then rinse off with warm water, moisturise and put white socks on overnight.  other tips - in a nice warm bath pour a little bit of oil into it and relax. just don't get the oil in your hair because trust me you'll have a hard time getting it out!    good luck!|`|hLu2j6IMaa	Exfoliating skin regularly can lift dead unwanted skin. A mask to shrink pores and eliminate blackheads. And a regular cleanser preferably salylic acid to remove blackhead. All and all I love murad. It helps with acne and it leave skin with a dewy ,healthy complextion.  The wave, which was a response isn't good for sensitive skin, it make me break-out really bad.  For the rest of the body, I love using baby-oil. It's cheap and smells good :)

K9Bcqloqaa	Relax, you will be fine.  It's going to take about 2 weeks until your tongue feels and looks normal.  Do not over do the listerine, nor the Sea salt.  Do not take out the piercing, or that could create a problem.  Think of it as if you bit your tongue real bad, it's gonna hurt like a mofo.  Don't worry about the white stuff, it's normal.  If you really feel upset by it, go see your piercer.  He will probably take a look at it and say, "yea, it's healing, it's all normal."|`|M8HVkIikaa	The whiteness is normal.. it's called lymph. It will be there until the piercing heals. Even after it heals, it's common for the bottom part to be white. To get rid of it after it heals brush the bottom ball after you brush your teeth, and it may help some.    Signs of an infection -  swelling  redness  pain (although above 3 are common in a new piercing)  warm to the touch  greenish discharge (AKA Pus)    Just have good oral care - brush your teeth 2x a day, use mouthwash without alcohol in it after you eat or smoke if you smoke, and you should be fine. Tongue piercings are very fast healers.|`|lLQunBRaaa	i'm pretty sure that's normal. a week after it's pierced it should hurt less. if the swelling is going down that's good. that should mean it's okay. if not take it out and take an anti biotic|`|2cf6501c9a3f33cf51f80b825ae1fa82aa	Did the place you got your piercing give you instructions and stuff to clean it with? (Any good place would have...) You need to call them or another reputable Tattoo/piercing parlor and ask this question. They are professionals and should give you the right information.    Listerine is no good because it dries out the piercing and removes all the bacteria that is supposed to be there to heal your piercing. I know when I had my tongue pierced the shop gave me a special cleansing foam that I placed on the piercing and let it sit a little while before rinsing it out. Also, make sure you aren't eating/drinking too much dairy or anything with yeast in it (like beer).     It takes about a week or two to complete heal. If it's infected longer than that you need to see a medical doctor and take the piercing OUT because you can get a serious infection and get REALLY sick.

UgvLTFmSaa	Well, in everyones eyes sometimes we are seen differently. You just have to like yourself for who you are.  And your mom and gradma should not say things like that, if your friends and other people tell you you are beautiful, listen to them. Your mom could be jealous of you for all we know.|`|BiWbEMXtaa	You can't be sure if you're pretty or not, that sounds  ignorant & self-absorbed.  Take it from family, you're probably beautiful.

Dg0D8SCZaa	stop taking it out. leave it alone!  all you should be doing is cleaning it. taking it out and putting it back is slowing the healing process, or even stopping it all together, and it is dramatically increasing your risk of infection. so, yes, it's possible it's infected. you should go have a talk with your piercer, have them look at it.    if you're not responsible enough to follow instructions that you are given when receiving a piercing, you shouldn't get one at all- you're putting yourself in harm's way. infections are no joke.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	It's probably scar tissue. From taking it in and out. It will only get worse if you keep doing it.     If you know it's dumb, why are you doing it?|`|IggGQ4GEaa	no the ball is normal and should go down in a few weeks to a month or two. stop removing it and make sure that you clean it several times a day|`|e158WyFGaa	Normal.I have one.Actually i have 2!    ;)I love lip rings!!|`|YeGroTEBaa	OMG u need emergency surgery|`|M8HVkIikaa	Cleaning your piercing "like crazy" can actually cause redness and swelling like you're describing. Unfortunately so can infections, allergy to your jewelry, and an improper fit of the jewelry. So no one online is going to be able to tell you exactly what is wrong with your piercing.     If you have redness, pain, heat, yellow/green/brown/ or smelly discharge, and other nasty symptoms you may have an infection. If you've just got an irritated looking piercing with a little whitish discharge and some puffiness, you are most likely not infected. It's possible though, so if your lip does anything alarming, please see your doctor.     To clean a lip piercing you can either clean it with sea salt soaks alone or you can clean the outside with anti-bacterial soap. Most piercers also have you rinse your mouth out with non-alcoholic mouthwash or a saline rinse after eating, drinking or smoking for the first couple of weeks. The mouth rinsing helps keep your piercing tidy and gives it an easier time healing.     To clean your lip with anti-bacterial soap is fairly self-explanatory. Use a soap without a lot of fragrance, rinse the area thoroughly when you're finished. You don't need to do soap more than once or twice a day unless you get particularly dirty or sweaty. Cleaning more often than you need to can aggravate your piercing, strip it of moisture, actually slow your healing process, and leave the area more vulnerable to infection since you've over-cleaned all of its natural defenses.     If you just can't live with only cleaning twice a day, you can perform sea salt soaks instead. To do this mix 1/4 teaspoon sea salt (or non-iodized salt) in 8oz warm water. Soak your piercing in the solution for a few minutes. You can stick your lip in the cup or you can soak some cotton wool in it and apply to the piercing. You can premix this solution, put it in a small clean bottle and carry it with you if you need to. Salt soaks will help soothe the area and keep it clean. You may notice the soaks drying out your skin, in this case cut back on soaks.    DO NOT PUT ANYTHING ELSE ON A PIERCING WITHOUT DIRECTION FROM A PROFESSIONAL. This means no hydrogen peroxide, no alcohol, no ointment. Hydrogen peroxide kills bacteria, but it also kills the cells that your body is using to heal the area. Alcohol is too drying and can strip the area of materials it needs to heal. Ointment keeps your piercing from breathing and its sticky so it attracts dirt and germs. If you must have something to rub on yourself, get some emu oil or tea tree oil, both of these can keep the area moist and are natural antiseptics. Just don't over apply them and ONLY apply them to a freshly cleaned piercing.     If you mean there is a lump inside your piercing, it is probably just swollen tissue that is trying to heal and has been aggravated by over-cleaning. Don't squeeze the lump, don't pick at it, just clean the area and leave it alone. If you mean there is a giant bubble of fluid someplace, then go to a professional and have it looked at.     One of the biggest parts of avoiding infection in a new piercing is to avoid touching it. Never, ever, ever touch a piercing with dirty hands. Not for any reason. There are nasty germs on just about every surface you touch. These germs get onto your hands and then can hitch a ride right to your new piercing. If you need to adjust your jewelry, wash your hands. Before you clean your piercing, wash your hands. Don't let anyone else touch your jewelry unless they have just washed their hands. The world is a dirty place, the best way to keep your piercing safe is not to touch it.    Keep your piercing clean, but don't over-do it. The more you let your piercing rest and care for itself, the better it is likely to heal. So no touching, and only just enough cleaning to keep it healthy.     And please, if it does anything strange like gets sore, oozes colored discharge, puts off heat, or gives you other trouble, go see a professional immediately about it.|`|K9IqkOrEaa	yes its normal i have a lip ring as well and it goes away about the first month or so but only take it out like when your showering or  sleeping and ew espacially when your eating!!!!|`|D518ejJDaa	Yes, it's infected. You need to clean it everyday before you put it back in.|`|klcqgST9aa	My ears are peirced and they feel like that. I think it's just calloused skin formed over the hole. But, better safe than sorry. Ask a doctor or even a school nurse, at the least.|`|1eiPSIydaa	don't keep removing it and putting it back in.  You're increasing the chance of infection every time you do it.    Some inflammation is expected but It might already be infected.  Keep cleaning the area and keep an eye on it.  If it get's worse I recommend seeing a doc for some antibiotics.|`|n7N6xq2aaa	you werent suppose to take it out and put it back in. that is going to irriatate it. your best bet is just leave it in and continue to clean it till it clears up. dont take it out its not healed yet and pulling it out is stopping the healing process|`|Cq8Uy5IXaa	normaaaaal, you should let it rest for a little while thooo.  but yeah it's tottally norma because it's like hardended skin where you pierced it.|`|DEMQR8piaa	Normal... the little ball is just scar tissue and a way for your body to deal with the piercing|`|MKp8ZT1raa	well is it red or swollen?

Y6IgaHTaaa	i tell my clients to use listerine to clean the inside and antibacterial dial soap to clean the outside.    mouthwash anytime you eat or drink and dial soap like twice daily.|`|HHyny0JSaa	The best is to rinse with something like listerine (you can dilute it with water if it's too strong). Use warm salt water soaks on the outside. And wash the outside with a mild antibacterial soap like dial (pump, not bar). I would stay away from using bacitracin ointment. It is too heavy and doesn't allow your skin to breathe for proper healing|`|TBRMH4hbaa	Dilute your mouthwash in half with water (make sure your mouthwash is alcohol free.) Clean the outside of the hole with ear piercing cleaning solution, and the inside with Gly Oxide (can be purchased at drug stores.) And use the mouthwash after every meal. DO NOT TOUCH IT WITH DIRTY HANDS. All of that is all you need to do. Also, smoking cigarettes and weed slows down the healing process.
DkrsZ4apaa	hahahaha. I would def doll you up. Lets see....... I would first make you shave your body hair (legs, pits, etc.).

S8cU6ONnaa	nope but if I were you I would go to someone that knew what they were doing. You do not want to be burned down there lol|`|lLQunBRaaa	i have! and i nearly cried. they have the microwave wax stuff and the strips called "NADS" i think? i usually get it done professionally but i decided to try it myself to save money. IT HURT SO BAD. i wanted to cry. and i didn't get to finish. the back does hurt less then the front and i recommend to just read the directions on the waxing kits in order to do it right..|`|YeGroTEBaa	no im a guy but hey go for it|`|n7N6xq2aaa	im not gunna lie its not comfortable. it hurts.  it hurts more on the upper part than the lower part  when they wax between the butt cheeks that does not hurt  but on the pelvic bone it hurts  i mean its worth it  the more you go the less they hurt|`|p4668Wx2aa	ehh!!!!!! be very careful. im a hairdresser/waxer and if u rip the wrong way u can end up bruising yourself.. if your going to do it at home. try and look up a site on which directions to pull in. i know its in my cosmetology book. but ill see if i can find a website & if i do. ill post it :]|`|USsDzaIsaa	If you want to look like a baby, I suggest a bib and pacifier.  They're less painful.|`|7haoi6xHaa	no, sounds painful though...  good luck!|`|KAkeAyOJaa	i did haha  it hurt like hell and nothing came off   my best answer is to go to a salon lol
xLO5VRYTaa	Don't overdo the makeup and if he wears a dress its a dead give away- so his options are tight jeans (ouch) or shave his legs and have him put short shorts on (ouch 2x!). As for wigs the long haired ones are obviously fake so have him wear a wig thats not too long, or have him grow out his hair. And ofcourse a stuffed bra|`|N7wPOX6daa	I know one way is the way he sits. Most females automatically cross their legs when they sit down as a habit. You could try to get him to do that.
2aFrHMLvaa	Wow, I'm so sorry to hear! That must be very scary for you!  At school, we have this American math teacher, (I live in Australia) - he looks down girls shirts, deliberately goes to their desk so that he could "look down their shirt", etc etc.    He is a pedophile girl! Yes, tell your parents and principal (if you can). Get all of the people that hes done this to, as well.  For more evidence, try to get a picture of him on your phone when hes doing it!    Even if it's really, really embarrassing, you need to tell somebody before he does something BAD.    Good luck!|`|vcWuPlOyaa	Tell your parents then call the police. That is illegal and very inappropriate. If he cant go to jail complain until he gets fired.|`|y1TDricRaa	maybe you should talk to the other girls about it about mentioning it to the principle cuz that is messed up.|`|2rtO69Jeaa	Ewwww, teachers creep me out! What i would do is, because this tends to work if i see like a guy looking down someones shirt is say really loudly, Hey (insert name here), i think you need to fix your shirt. or it its the butt issue, say Hey (insert name once again), those are cute jeans, i think EVERYONE likes them! then tell them about it later.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Thats way inappropriate.  Does anyone else in your class feel uncomfortable like you do?  If so, tell someone.|`|s0TiTrd3aa	that's really sick... unless he's, like, a hot 25 year old teacher... haha! just kidding, it's still wrong. teacher-student relations aren't right at all. how old is he? and would someone confront him about it?|`|ITJxXhQ0aa	tell your principal..report it|`|3TcifNJNaa	He can get fired for that. Tell your parents right away! You never know what could happen if someone doesn't stop him...    (^^ Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.)|`|XZHx3v4Raa	you decide what you have to do.  i had this teacher that winked at me.turns out he does it to everyone even at guys.lol|`|7D44tO9Daa	omg i have a teacher just like that!   he is always making comments about how we are dressed and it really grosses me out!!!! and he is really old!!!!!     tell your principal, parents or any other trusted adult|`|eeUG0VYTaa	Wear a sweatshirt zipped up all the way in his class...if not then tell the guidance counselor who could probably get him fired.|`|MeOOUhHkaa	Most definitely report that.    I had a teacher who put all the girls who normally wore skirts in the front row, and then he had set all his desks so they were really high, and then would really lower his chair in the front and look up their skirts. Ugh, unfortunately, I was in the front row. He always looked down girls shirts and invited me to his classroom during lunch to "clean the desks", and that is where everyone on that side of the building is gone, in lunch, and I said yes, but I didn't go.    He was fired the next year "retiring" but he had been reported so many times that they finally fired him.    So, if parents all are constantly reporting him, then you can get him fired. It's ILLEGAL for him to do that.|`|2LpWgU20aa	omg i used to have a teacher like that, he was a creeper. and everyone was convinced he was a pediphile for example once my friend had to stay after class because he had to talk to her about her failing grades so she went by his desk  and he closed the door and started lecturing her about her failing grades and after his short lecture was over he was like dont get mad, i really like you as a person (as he brushed her hair out of her face) and he was like i hope this doesnt come between us and asked her to hug him but she didnt and walked out of the class. those were just some of the many innapropriate things that teacher did. there were lots of parents calling to complain about them but he still wouldnt get fired for some odd reason. U should tell ur friends and parents. Maybe let the school officials or guidence counsler know about it. and if they dont fire him ask to get moved out of the class. if u are unable to switch teachers just were a sweatshirt in his class so he has nothing to look at. i wish u luck with ur problem!|`|dHeMxnp2aa	thats actually illegal and he can get fired for that. if i were you, i would talk to JUST UR MOM, and ask your mom to tell ur dad so u wont feel embarrassed and also ask her if they can call the school to talk about it. the principle will most likely have a sit down with the teacher and talk to him, but if they ask him he'll say: no ma'am! but that is obviously a lie. but actually, i think u should wait, the next time ur sure u see him looking at a girls butt or down her shirt then tell ur friend to plan it and say to her OUT LOUD: Wow! I nvr knew how rude some people can be in a classroom, you think they should see other people?? or stop looking in inappropriate places MAYBE?????|`|JWziUfDgaa	First I'd like to say your teacher is sick! I had something like that happen to me but, worse. WAY WORSE! When I was in 8th grade (Im in 12th now!) me and my friends all had gym class together and our gym teacher was woman. Now I'm not going to be rude but, to make it understandable their were these really beautiful girls and everyday when we were changing into our gym clothes the gym teacher would walk by and look at us inappropriatley! I ignored it for awhile thinking it was all in my head but, then i was called into the office one day and when I got their I saw the other girls (the one's I talked about earlier) and the principal asked me if I had noticed anything strange with the new gym teacher! The other girls said that the gym teacher would ask them to fix their shirts and stuff or tell them take it off and put back on so it wouldn't look wrinkled! I was like so suprised and so sorry for the girls! Anyway's the teacher was fired and we got a new one who was normal! Lol! But seriously you should defenitley TELL! It helped me it will help you!|`|y3UwO9kpaa	I have a art teacher like that  haha  uhhh talk to a teacher|`|vuPJipLeaa	Tell your parents.|`|KXZ8jIP9aa	i had a similar issue in high school. lol    turn around and yell out "can you stop staring at her ***?!!!" when he looks at a girls butt.    say it loud to embarrass him and act pissed off.      this really got my teacher 2 years ago. he was an old man, but got what he deserved.|`|zPFclJznaa	your probably just imagining it|`|6EPedq48aa	its illigal for techers to say that women shouldn't be leaders of countries and things like that!    tell the parents|`|PXnqbABlaa	well.  i had a gym teacher like that once...  ugh ew.  well, ur gonna have to tell ur parents  have then call into the school and comlain, but try to get other classmates to do it. (f they talk to the teacher they will keep it connfidencial so dont worry about him knowing)  thats really all u can do other than, wear things that arent low cut lol|`|Ym9bRgcDaa	TELL TELL TELL!    We have a teacher like that, and we have a plan to write "F**K YOU MR. (his name)!!! with Sharpie on our boobs or near that area and bend down in front of him! Then if he says anything you can ask why he was being a peeper :)    GOOD LUCK!|`|tfqpb5XQaa	Go tell your principal or something if you're too embarrassed to tell your parents. If you tell your parents, they're probably going to go to the principal anyway. Even if you go to your school counselor, and seeing as theirs other people who feel the same, go with a few other people.|`|Po6dgusAaa	Talk to your parents or a counselor. The most they will do is give him a warning. Get the other girls in your class to tell their parents also because he can't get fired with one complaint. They usually don't fire teachers that have been teaching for a long time in the same school or that have a lot of crudentials. I know what you are going through I had a biology teacher in 10th grade that was a pervert.|`|S8kx69vSaa	You should not let him get away with this!  That is disgusting!  Tell your parents, hun. If your too embarrassed, you and a friend can go tell her parents.  And you guys need to tell the school about this immediately and get that creepy disgusting pedophile fired!  Good Luckk.|`|caeGMhRYaa	omg.. same with me.  im in middle school too. but my teacher took a picture of me reading and used it as his backround on his computer! i was soooo creeped out. all i did was i got switched out to a diff. class right away. but now when i see him in the hallway he gives me this weird stalkerish look. haha
aV0QmAOtaa	That's creepy. But anyways, just cancel your order (if you still can) and try again or maybe a few hours later. Maybe they're having difficulties with the site or something. But I'm sure if you order now, your boots will come in on time, it's possible that the site is just making a mistake. But if you don't want to risk loosing your money or going through so much trouble, just go to your local Nordstrom's and buy it there :)|`|znLzOCHlaa	Thye probably come out next winter if that is what I think it means.|`|oH9oFbbKaa	i think that you should order and take a chance. hell, it could have been some typo or something. don't have a heart attack over something SOME ONE YOU DONT KNOW wrote.|`|sg0m6LBRaa	nooo thats not a typo.  that is the approximate shipping date.  its probably backordered.  you will pay for standard shipping - 4-6 days when it comes out of its backordering stage.    my suggestion to u is to get it from a nordstrom store or another store, such as the walking company, bloomingdales, neimann marcus, etc.|`|zhbBIlbyaa	uggs are... ugggggggggggg like as in eew. How else would they have come up with that name?!?|`|PK9R1V8gaa	your link doesnt work....|`|cacfXRDjaa	Um, Kath, that's not urgent.

But its like a vintage/hipster type of magazine.  So you may or may not like it. It's mainly about  fashion, and stuff like that. So, take a look@ it, and  see if you like it. But, i really seventeen too. J14, is  alright. But kind of kiddish with all them disney stars.  But i still like it. So, yeah. Good luck! (:

M8HVkIikaa	yo cant pop them unless you want scars on ur face.here is what to do.      ... don't use alcohol, your face will only be more oily because the alcohol strips your face of necessary oils, and your skin will produce more oil to make up for the loss. If you take a washcloth and run it under hot water and just hold it on that part of your face, keep doing this for at least 5 minutes, this helps it to come to the surface... don't pop it!!! That just spreads the bacteria... do however get some pimple cream and just dot it wherever you have the pimple (not over your whole face though) I use the Proactiv sulfer face mask, because it also helps reduce redness.|`|KAkeAyOJaa	get a wash cloth and put hot hot hot water on it.  Leave it on your pimple for about 3 minutes  than after you dry it off put a little dab of acne cream on it  (only a little amount)  and in the next few hours it should be a whitehead.|`|tao83sDxaa	for gods sake don't! i know it hurts. do you have any witch hazel? if not get some. put it on the spot that is causing trouble. with a q tip. keep on putting it on every time you can think of it. in a couple of days it should start to dry up and become a scab. no picking. the scab ahould get to a point where it is about to fall off, let it, new skin will be under it. good luck
I6zQeNGzaa	I really dig bright hair colors if it looks good on the person. I love this color on you, I think you can pull it off and look like a major hottie.  You should play up your eyes a little more with shadow and liner to complete the edgy look and also you would look even better with a fuller side swept bang.|`|lJYvGLKLaa	How cute! I love it.

HVDopA6Caa	obviously its going to hurt.. it's a thick piece of cartilage, but I can honestly say my helix piercing hurt more. I think a barbell looks best and it heals a lot faster.

I love mine, definitely worth it.     good luck.|`|K9Bcqloqaa	When I got my conch pierced, it did hurt, and it can take awhile to heal, so you need to be patient.  I really like my conch piercing.  Usually the piercer will put in a bar, but I asked for a enclosed ring.  That might be what is prolonging the healing, but it really looks nice with the ring.  Ask the piercer for his/her professional advise on what type of jewelry to use.  It's a very unique piercing, I haven't seen many people with it, and that's a good thing:)|`|M8HVkIikaa	A conch piercing does not hurt one bit !!! i went to get it pierced about 5 weeks ago the person froze it and put the needle through...all i felt was a bit of pressure but no pain at all...the same day i got my ear peirced on the rim at the top they froze that aswell and that hurt quite a bit ... so if you go and get ur conch pierced u hav absolutely nothing to worry about :D hope i helped :D  0  Pts      Rate Answer|`|lLQunBRaaa	well, i want one also! but my friend had it done not to long ago and he's really brave and he said that it hurt really bad. that's all i know about it really.. but i think you should get it! :)
rvoo4rBjaa	Try Michael's crafts store or Jo Ann fabrics.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	On Ebay there are a lot of charms and tings like this...try putting "Heart outline charm" or just "Heart charm" in the box|`|7D44tO9Daa	i have that bathing suit!!!! hahah     i'm not sure... maybe you can get one in a craft store....|`|d662a7ad0f118e08f311eec065c3ac54aa	try firemountaingems.com|`|b733u1O3aa	Craft Stores or a beading shop.|`|JlL68gfdaa	at any good craft store u should b able to find a big heart button like the one u want. what about using a broach??? search for silver heart broach on ebay or look in a craft store
kp0QYdb9aa	medium|`|d662a7ad0f118e08f311eec065c3ac54aa	that's like a s/m.  but you don't necessarily have to go by that, go to the store and try on some hats.  whatever fits is your size. :)
M8HVkIikaa	theres a fine line between tactful honesty and rudeness. Ive always been a big fan of being honest with people - even if it means saying something they dont want to hear. Its gotten me into trouble on more than one occasion. In some cases I dont care what folks think of the things I have to say.    But sometimes I do and so it becomes difficult to balance my need to be honest with my desire to not be too offensive or rude      If you are friends with them take them in back and say it!    or if it someone you dont really know be likr "whats that smell"! and look around if your with a big group of people.. it will work|`|lLQunBRaaa	Buy them some perfume or whatever or offer them breath mints. but be casual like "hey i got you this! i picked up some for myself and it was by one get one free so i thought you might like it!"|`|Rnjpqif6aa	buy them perfume  recommend a good perfume  start a random convo abt stench and deodorant  say that showers have been invented|`|vuPJipLeaa	Yeah. Just say.. '' Here i bought you deoderant... you can have it i already have some.. OH wait! Here i also brought you some perfume.. Oh and heres some body wash. OH AND.you stink jk dont say that''
TjPwxbuJaa	If your ears are healed there should be no problem taking them out. I'm thinking that about a week after a stretch they should be healed enough. I have stretched ears as well and take them out every night -- about 7 hours -- and my ears still keep stretching larger. Good luck.|`|TBRMH4hbaa	I have 1/2" plugs too (:   There really is no set limit to how long you should wait to change it. Usually it's at least a week, but I've only had to keep mine in a day at certain sizes. It all depends on YOU. Once you can turn them and move them and take them out comfortably it should be finneeee.  If they're not pussing or sensitive then you can take em out just for work. They won't downsize in 4 hours.
bkP696yiaa	Chi is pretty good not going to say amazing but i use a flat iron called the Milstan Feather Flat Iron and it's great on ethnic hair. It looks like a spatula and it distributes heat evenly. It can also get closer to the scalp than a straightening comb or flat iron. It leaves your hair looking like you got a perm.|`|v0FlUan0aa	tigi bed head|`|hxJouZgTaa	get a chi..they are the best|`|mW59lposaa	my friend mom owns a salon and it has like really good equipment and her mom uses the conair ionic steam straightener. it IS a commercial one but it works like magic. so far its the best one to me!  good luck!
QPyrEQWmaa	i like the second and third ones  the first and fourth ones would make anyone look really douchey  p.s.- your picture makes me smile. you look like you would be a cool kid for some reason.|`|PpJEaCpCaa	the 4th one|`|FmhUZLgoaa	either 1 or 4|`|zY6WXobEaa	i think its a tie between the second and forth.

TNFqxyjZaa	it depends on the following standards:  are you looking for a job  will your boyfriend/girlfriend like it  will school care  are you even old enough    personally i love piercings. it gives a person this special stand out flashy edge. and i love piercings but i do love having a job. i know people wont hire if you have facial piercings so watch out for that and and make sure your jobs secure.    make sure your boyfriend or girlfriend likes it because kissing may feel different. if you dont have onethen your all good lol    make sure there are no school rules against the subject if you are still in school.    i suggest not gettign one untill the age of 15. i feel its a responsible age.    goodluck with the piercing, make sure to clean it well and please get it pro done|`|ns1F0p8Laa	NO|`|7nGwou8uaa	depends what you look like.|`|6TlAd2TGaa	NO! That's just gross no offense. It's not attractive at all. An it makes you more intimidating negatively. I wouldn't lips are beautiful naturally!|`|7GXV0aMnaa	How about an industrial piercing like this one?  http://images-cdn01.associatedcontent.co...  =D good luck|`|boIzJnUpaa	I wouldn't. Personally, I just think it's gross. But, its def better than a tongue piercing!!! Bleck.|`|2QB90j85aa	YES! i got mine done new years eve and i loved it and it didn't even hurt that much and it healed within a few days|`|JDQP0Phraa	It's cool... unless you have a job or are planning on getting one. Most places will not allow you to wear facial piercings, and some might not even employ you depending on the job. It sucks that people think you can't express individuality and be professional at the same time.

Maybe if you look like your in better moods more often you would figure it out.. The angry faces aren't working in either one's favor. Don't get me wrong, both cute... but I wouldn't date you based on those pics... or this question. You know the word twins means something right?|`|gxOdYxX6aa	second picture|`|EFcoFT9Jaa	Ima twin too.. U both look completely different. Me and my sister look more alike!

6JKMz004aa	Tell your parent to trust u, i've had Facebook for 2 years and i nvr did anything inappropriate.if its possible let your mom have  your password. n except for putting a picture put something pretty like Quotes, or maybe sign created by U. dont worry your parent will let u have facebook    ~ Realmage  Hope this helped. n tell me how it turns out  :)            DO NOT KEEP IT PRIVATE~ IF THEY SOMEHOW FIND OUT THEY WILL  NEVER TRUST EVER AGAIN!!!!!      please respect your parents|`|Ux0spiIXaa	keep talking to them about how you can make your profile private.. and bring up the whole "i'm in high school, and getting older/maturing". U'll have to be involved in the social world eventually.. if it comes to this, let them see a little of what you do online!|`|WO68RZdIaa	I can see their concerns. A lot of kids & teens place personal information on the internet- that could lead a pedophile right to their front door or right to their school.    Bring the subject up with your parents again about allowing you to get a Facebook account. And if they still have any reservations about you getting one, calmly ask what their concerns are & be ready to respond with an answer that will remove their concerns.     For example-   Personal information- tell your parents that you are aware that placing personal info on the internet can be used by others to locate you & that you will not place any photos on Facebook that has anything that can be used to locate you. (Pics showing name of your school, street sign near your house, any of your cars that you can read the license plate, etc)    Accepting strangers as friends- just tell your parents that you can set your Facebook account to Private & that anyone who wants to add you as a friend must submit a request & you can deny them, also you will not accept anyone that you do not know.    Just follow those examples with any other objections that your parents may bring up. And if you convince your parents that you are responsible enough to get a Facebook account, email me & I'll give you my information so you can show your parents a safe Facebook site- it is mainly for my business I own, so I don't allow any junk on it so it stays professional looking.|`|st5reHVjaa	i have a face book and a myspace, my 'rents have no idea  i see no problem if u dont post ur address on it or anything.    my mom is all freaked out by everything on the news about "online predators" and "online bullies" when that never happens.  parents are just freaked by it. its no biggie.|`|v0FlUan0aa	omg my parents are the same, but i still have one. you can out it on private.. like your pictures and stufff. the only bad thing is when you add a friend they can stalk you. but its not bad. its a good way to connect with your friends. i got one my freshman year too and my parents still dont know i get on|`|XbVtfiYkaa	wow. your parents are really strict. just ask casually when everyone is in a good mood.|`|ITJxXhQ0aa	make one and dont tell them..delete your history when you are done with the computerr|`|vNnvpLKBaa	so get one, how would they know?|`|FtPFFd1Vaa	facebook is really safe compared to other online friend sites. in my whole year of being on it i haven't had anyone that i didn't know even try to talk to me.
6EPedq48aa	yea! as long as ur not going to like urbanoutfitters or somthing.     id add like 50-100 for shoes or somthing.      xoxoCBL|`|v0FlUan0aa	probably..|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	hmm clothes and supplies? I think it could be enough, just make sure to find some really good sales, and dont spend over $200 on clothes|`|RiIUxhhxaa	Yeah, should be fine|`|J78SRCe5aa	I know what you mean. I REALLY want to update my wardrobe for high school nect year. Actually, I'd do it now, but yeah, I'm trying to save for the summer.    It depends on what you're buying, where you're buying, and how much you're buying.    If you shop well to cheap, 300 bucks is enough for about a week's worth of outfits (from head to toe, accessories included), plus extra supplies, bags, etc. If you shop more expensively, maybe up to 3 outfits, plus the supplies and stuff.    I dunno, that's my opinion based on stuff in the malls around here, and what I call an outfit, but yeah.|`|PCYtNsIBaa	yes ma'am!  thats plentyy  unless you're in college and u need $ for textbooks too  (:|`|1a14D4X6aa	I don't think so..at least if you mean just clothing for the beginning of the school year ya..that will be enough if you go to the good cheaper stores :)    yes I think so....It shoud be enough
SgoMrPsQaa	Comb back your hair, except for your bangs.  Tease the crud out of it, and put it into a side pony.  Have some hair going down where your side burns are suppose to be.  You can curl the rest of your hair if you like.

4xkyCdAaaa	I'm 21, I've been advised by facialists etc and read a lot in magazines that you should definitely be using moisturiser morning and night, eye cream and sun screen every day in your 20's. You shouldn't use anti wrinkle creams as they are made for older, tougher skin and can be damaging and too harsh for delicate younger skin in your 20's|`|CUt6AqJHaa	I am 22 too and I don't have wrinkles either. I've heard that too but I think it is more important to moisturize and always wear sun block. Sun damage is most common cause to wrinkles|`|c1399de03ef647ddb85fb6f6fd6f6c2baa	It's never too early. Start now, and you may still look 22 in 10 years time!|`|O7M7cERWaa	Yes you should start in your early 20's and you will look great when your older :)|`|lLQunBRaaa	it couldn't hurt..|`|Y6IgaHTaaa	it's always good to use a moisturizer no matter what age you are, i'm assuming that can only help you're skin stay younger looking and healthy.|`|TdrpIkl4aa	i have heard that as well, i think as long as you use a good moisturiser then thats better than nothing. anyway is it even proven that all these expensive "Anti Wrinkle" creams work.|`|aadc56549fb798de3c0328b953407872aa	I wouldn't use it unnecessarily.  They sound amazing but they also contain loads of stuff which could do more harm than good if you don't need it yet.  Just stick to your normal moisturiser etc. and wait til you actually have older skin.
iwSRIIf9aa	As LindaLoo said, you are simply using the wrong color makeup for your skin tone.  Most people with paler skin have cool undertones, which means you need to look for foundation and powder with the words "Fair", "Natural", "Beige", or just "Light".  Stay away from any foundation with the words "Honey" or "Golden" or anything darker than a light shade.  The perfect foundation should literally disappear once you apply it to your skin, and if you feel that you look too pale there are some things you can do to warm your skin up.  Buy a bronzing powder, but make sure you buy it in a very light color.  With a large fluffy brush, apply it to the top of your forehead, bridge of your nose, tops of your cheekbones and your chin and blend it really REALLY well.  These are the areas where the sun would naturally hit your face, and by applying a light bronzer there you will give your skin a nice glow without an orange tone.  Also, buy a blush in a really bright color.  Then, apply it very lightly to the apples of your cheeks with the same large fluffy brush.  Using a bright color (pink, salmon or bright peachy color would be best for your cool skin tone) looks scary, but if you apply it very lightly it will really wake up your cheeks and give you a beautiful, naturally flushed look.  Trust me-it works.  Apply a shimmer powder to the tops of your cheekbones also to give your skin a naturally luminous look and you will have the perfect Peaches and Cream skin!!!|`|jdRKZe18aa	If you are looking orange then you are choosing a foundation with orange undertones that is obviously the WRONG COLOR for your skin.  Clearly you must need one of the lightest or fairest tones but you need to seek some help from a BETTER makeup consultant at macy's or MAC counter or a MARY KAY CONSULTANT  and get a make consultation about your personal foundation choices....  there is no need to look orange OR dead!|`|SRs6xcxPaa	a blue or gray eye shadow
98b98bd5749baadc8ce32ff1f2759dceaa	lucky penny by clinique or paradisco by MAC......they are kinda coppery colors...check them out-def. Lucky Penny looks great on redheads|`|otnJOmwSaa	Blue or Gold is an excellent choice. But pink is the most common in my opinon that looks great with red hair and brown eyes. It brings out the color in you're eyes and you're hair... good luck :)|`|iwSRIIf9aa	Golden brown (light, medium and dark), champagne, gold, burgundy/wine/eggplant, navy, evergreen.  Although most red heads use cool tones for makeup, warm tones actually look better and make your skin look more warm and bright.  Stick with any deep jewel tone or warm color (reds, browns and golds).|`|4zQEvzCsaa	A pale green would look beautiful with your features. Also a gold would look good too.
9rQzQxexaa	messy bun! like this one:  http://www.lynnechapman.com/images/messy...    pin back your bangs straight back across your head (bad description, i know) like this:  http://i204.photobucket.com/albums/bb262...    or a side pony with lots of texture (curl the ends)  http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_NxCVwWorQjI/SL...|`|MGjMjWwaaa	try typing cute hairstyles for school onto youtube it gives you tons of tutorials on updo's! :)
4MYJpkZcaa	Whatever, Asia Jams rocks. If they want you to stand out and be unique they'd choose that. I'm another American and I don't wear Abercrombie and Fitch or any of that other nonsense (bleh it's so cliche plastic). Actually, if they think you look ridiculous come to my school everyone will love it there- you can tell them that. Second, tanning is bad for you- do they want you to get melanoma? I did research on this- although it's pretty much basic knowledge that too much sun is bad.    Tell her you do dress like an American- we are not barbies we come in all shapes in sizes. *rolls eyes* Stupid stereotypes...Gah. I'm so sorry you have to deal with that.|`|NVPR8usJaa	Just go with your own style! But if you want your self-esteem higher than you would probably need to wear American clothes, sadly.  But if you don't care, GO WITH WHAT YOU WANT!|`|UgvLTFmSaa	Well i like the second outfit for clothing, and the hair looks cute.  Theres nothing wrong with liking what you like. You're parents are probably just thinking someone may hurt your feelings because other people at school may not like your style but i tihnk that's great you're being unique.  And i have pale skin and i ended up buying self tanner because i wanted to be tan cause everyone bugged me for being pale, but you know what after a month i hated wasting my money on it and it smelled, only to me but it was gross. So what iam getting to is, just be who you are, and if you like pale skin, which is lovely on some ppl, you should just do what you are doing and wearing. Don't let anyone change you.  I think your style is really fresh and funky:P|`|Ym9bRgcDaa	TELL YOUR PARENTS OFF!    Say, "I like my style. People say it's unique, and it suits me."    THEY CAN'T CHOOSE WHO YOU ARE!    Maybe you should get family counseling, because that's verbal abuse...|`|vuPJipLeaa	Aw.... That szucks idk|`|KXZ8jIP9aa	WOW. you wear what you want girl, and dont let ANYONE tell you otherwise. fashion is how you express yourself. not how THEY express themselves.|`|PXnqbABlaa	i think its really cool that u have an origional style.  maybe there is someway for you to mix your style of fashion into american style?   i think it would be rlly cool.  try telling them that you are an orgional and that nothing is going to changet that.  your not retarded! i bet i would think ur cool.  but i may suggest that u shouldnt wear a too white foundation just because people are probly think ur going a little too overboard. but i def. agree that pale skin roxx|`|XbVtfiYkaa	don't listen to your parents. your style is awesome|`|vNnvpLKBaa	Maybe ur parents want u to become "americanized"     tell them those brands they want you to wear are for posers... no one who knows fashion wears Abercombie|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Just ignore them.  Asian parents seem to be the ones who put the most stress and shame on their kids in their effort to strive for perfection and assimilation.  I know how bad those guilt trips can be.  Cheers to you for holding your own.  You sound very mature for your age.|`|pFS2LZGKaa	Wear anything you feel comfortable in, you don't have to look like other people. Make yourself happy!|`|3sCrTA1Raa	be  like  why does  it matter? ill  be eighteen in  two years and ill  wear what i want.  i dont tell you guys what  to wear.  im admiring my culture  and showing my pride for it.  i dont  want to be white washed and forget  about my heritage because its important for me|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	Tell them, I dont like American fashion, i like Korean fashion(it is adorable btw ^_^) and you should have the freedom to dress how you want without your parents putting you down. Say you want to dress like your culture and it just happens to be really cute|`|2aFrHMLvaa	I know how you feel.  I was bullied ever since I was in Kindergarten, so I know what it feels like to be teased because of your appearance.     I feel that your parents would like you to be more "American" because when they were growing up, they didn't have that opportunity.     I wouldn't call that ugly, nobody is ugly. Your beautiful, unique and sometimes it takes people a while to work it out.    We can't all be the same.     Good luck!|`|1IIY1Ds6aa	hahaha dont worry, there are people just like you in special ed!!!!    hahahahaha jk    its great that you love your clothes, and if your happy with life the way it is then ignore your parents about that.    but you know, there are some pretty cool american fashions out there    maybe you could wear a korean top with some abercrombie jeans?    you can still fit in and be YOUnique!! :)  hope i helped :)    heres me, btw http://i553.photobucket.com/albums/jj373...|`|6mBrJ2EGaa	aww but those are just too cute!!!|`|2Yijblbaaa	tell everyone to f*ck off because you are who you are and they can take it or leave it!|`|qE5XIAsYaa	I think your style is Absolutely great. If u can't be "yourself" in America I don't know where you can be yourself at. I love your style.|`|C8kUMHTfaa	Haha what the heck.  You poor thing. My parents are super strict Asians & want my appearance to 'fit in' with others too.  They've lightened up recently though, so keep doing what you're doing because I'm sure you look fabulous & your parents will probably give up soon enough. :]|`|AEF5Hj4faa	Awww. Ur style is unique and cute  Well, its ur choice if u wanna dress like that.. Not yur parents.|`|k1wg9nl5aa	You know what?  You style is so cute.  Your hair must be amazingg.  And you can tell your parents that you like the way you look.  And tell them it is a good thing you are trying to be different at your school.  I am.  I love skinny jeans, my parents think they look stupid.  So screw what other people think, be who you are.    ~Animal_Lover|`|Xhj9wrZsaa	ok 1st of all... u dont dress ugly. 2nd of all the hair style is different but cute. them calling you ugly is them trying to manipulate you into dressing the way they want to so stick to what you wanna wear. BE DIFFERENT CAUSE THERES NOTHING WRONG WITH BEING UNIQUE!!!!!!|`|MGjMjWwaaa	Oh my goodness! That's terrible from those pictures I LOVE your style!   I always look at asian style sites even though im canadian (white) because i love there style so much!! I even ship clothes from china all the way here because they have such a unique style that it's really hard to find it here.   I also always find that asian style is a step ahead of the american style like maybe one thing would be in style for asia and then 2 years later it would be in style for america.  Don't listen to your parents you are who you are and you don't need to act any other way   I love everything about asians the hair the clothes and everything!!   I wish you luck! :D|`|Tp2VuKzeaa	Dress how you want to dress. Its great being individual. Dont feel pressured into being something you are not.|`|5ieWhvYCaa	This is America not Korea.    You are correct.|`|fbZxJsmCaa	OK, in HS I had an Asian friend and she used to always say that you know your family loves you when they greet you with "you look terrible!", because according to her Asian culture is like that, criticizing a loved one means you care.      Anyway, i think your style is cool.  I go to art school and a lot of the abroad students wear cool clothes like that.  it;s different, it's fun and playful.  Honestly, HS is not a nice place.  if you go outside the little box that your classmates want to put you in, they will make fun of you on the spot.  Luckily, things get better after HS and no one freaks out because you dress differently.    I think you should put it in perspective, you aren't dressing goth or something like that.  I think your parents want you to Americanize a lot because they feel like they are providing you with a  lot of opportunities and they want you to "fit in."   Even though their showing it in a crappy way, they love youand don't want you to look back and say "I wish i fit in better in HS."    Talk to them, tell them how it hurts your feelings, that is all you can do,|`|lAZWTLtRaa	They just want you to fit in. They don't want you to get picked on and they want you to blend with everyone else, since you are not from America.  My Asian friends usually get ridiculed about their marks, so I see where you're coming from.  If they aren't going to punish you, ignore what they're saying and don't let it get to you. They're old. They aren't "with" the times, when being an individual is a growing trend.  Ok so I'm Caucasian and Canadian (close enough to the American style these days) and I don't wear brands like American Eagle and Abercrombie, or Hollister because it's just a rip-off for cheap clothes with brand names on them. That's how I see it, and it's good to see someone who doesnt conform easily.|`|GzHCK9TJaa	you cant let your parents do that to you,  that is just so rude  and this is your life.  but if they keep bugging you  let them buy clothes from wherever they want   you to get clothes  then never wear them:)|`|Bbn1ZSTcaa	God made you just the way you are and he loves you! Don't listen to your Mother when she says that kind of stuff to you. That is called verbal abuse. I wish I had some different cool clothes like you! I LOVE your style.|`|Q412OM5gaa	Aww, I'm sorry your parents are like this. Just tell them that they need to let you become your own person. Plus, those clothes are really probably more expensive than what you are wearing now. Say that you don't WANT to look like everyone else and that being different is a good thing. Just because we're in America doesn't mean you have to be tan and wear those brands. That's a stereotype. Tell them to stop trying to make you into a stereotype. :]|`|7cei5ifNaa	u look so pretty xxx
WCOeyt0Haa	dillards has some nice inexpensive dresses,|`|ZpLFNtTyaa	http://store.delias.com/item.do?itemID=4... i think this dress is really cute! it may not be your style, but the fit of the dress with the umpire waist will be very flattering on you! delias is in malls too and they have more on this site! good luck! |`|bMhBlWRuaa	http://www.bandlu.com/product.asp?item=j...  or   http://www.bandlu.com/product.asp?item=i...

dQxX26gQaa	Did he really? Why didn't I hear about this?    Yeah, I'm a teenage girl and I never liked Twilight, I thought it was badly written and cliche.    Seriously? Wow...kudos to you then, Stephen King!|`|4gcTZNZBaa	twilight is bad.. i tried to read it but i had to stop|`|NVPR8usJaa	Yeah, you tell them Stephen King!|`|YogATwEoaa	WOOH !  Go Stephen ;)|`|PpJEaCpCaa	um no Stephen King doesn't know what he's talking about|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Really?  Thats funny!  Now I want to read a chapter out of a twilight book to see what he's referring too.|`|6TlAd2TGaa	GREAT!!!! He has a brain and good taste....  I'm a teen girl but I'm smart. Twilight was boring...I guess she can write but that book had no spark! Just some romance fantasy writing. Half the people only like it because of the hot guys. It's kinda stupid. YEAH STEPHEN!!!!!!|`|ZpR57jbBaa	I'm very glad someone finally let out their feelings about twilight that way.  I mean twilight got on my last nerves but i read a couple of the books and they are pretty good but someone had to rain on her parade and I'm happy.|`|3sCrTA1Raa	TWILIGHT  IS AWFUL!|`|1IIY1Ds6aa	twilight sucks!!!!!!    wahoo!!!go stephen!!!|`|OaQWUfNoaa	One of my old teachers (who is also an author) is reading Twilight at the moment and told me that Meyer's lapses are like she is writing a shopping list. :) I'm about 2 chapters into Eclipse...I have been for about 2 weeks!|`|QWl1Iy8Waa	Hey, i have no problem with people being mean bout a book. That's their opinion. But people judging other's talents? That's wrong. Stephen King is a great author, and so is Stephenie Meyer. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Remember they're both still people.|`|63s3G8YUaa	I didn't know that happened, but it is about time someone said it! Ugh, Twilight is poorly written, Bella is whiny and Edward is way too protective(and a bit abusive too), and every other character is two-diminsional. Stephanie Meyer doesn't know anything about teenage life today, overuses the thesaurus, and has way too many details. The book would of made perfect sense if she cut out half of it! The morals are also extremely messed up. Getting married at 18 and having a baby afterwards? She is making teen girls think they are in love when they aren't. Bella and Edward don't even seem in love with each other. Yeah, Edward is good-looking and Bella smells good. So what? Neither of them have very little personality. It is pretty messed up that she is so convinced that she is in love after having one dinner alone and talking a bit. Stephanie Meyer is a horrible writer. Rob Patterson (who plays Edward in Twilight), even said he felt uncomfortable reading Twilight at times because it was like Stephanie Meyer's sexual fantasy. Oh, and I am 13. I hate Twilight. It is awesome that someone who can actually write called Stephanie Meyer a terrible writer. It is the truth.|`|16ff6296cfb40d2b056005d3fab83f0caa	No.     Just because he is more famous than Stephanie Meyer does not make his opinion fact.     Some people love it, some people like it, some people hate it. Whatever..it's just a book. Personally, I liked it. But now I guess all the little obsessed fangirls are going to give us sane fans a bad name once more. *sigh * Oh well...|`|IN7xvFqdaa	HA! YES I DID i posted a comment too. i thnk mines the first one! props to my favorite auther. i HATE twilight|`|ls6esy9laa	Aha,  I think its funny.  I haven't read the books yet, but they seem to be pretty good.  Maybe I'll try out some of his books as well x]|`|PrsLzRhdaa	yeah I think so.  I mean I read the books but they aren't very well written and the whole story is pretty generic.  It keeps me entertained though.|`|bEypuYJ0aa	Dude I lovee Stephen King. F*** Twilight.  He's right.  I can't stomach those books & I hope that Kujo eats Stephenie Meyer. hahaa|`|HFlytHlRaa	I'm glad somebody said it.    Supposedly, Robert Pattinson (whatever his name is.) doesn't like Twilight either.|`|6ybAFZuAaa	yes. amen!!!! stephen king is amazing..  the twilight series doesnt compare with any of his books.|`|1KRlZ1V4aa	stephen king is awesome|`|aZXnW6AUaa	i guess
AEF5Hj4faa	Don't eat when ur not hungry.  Don't eat fatty food.  Exercise 30-60 a day.  Uhhhhhh..  Annd.. Drink water when ur thirsty. Lols|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Stop eating sugar and drinking soda.  No fried foods or anything that you can buy at a 7-11.|`|ITJxXhQ0aa	when you are hungry for a snack..drink lots of water when hungry instead of food|`|eNEMhcy6aa	Go buy the book "Idiot-Proof Diet" by Neris & India (it's hot pink...can't miss it).  I have a hard time on diets but lost 10 lbs the 1st week!  It's basically a protein diet.  It's $25 (or around there).  If you can't afford it, stick to this:    8 glasses of water/day  meats  salads w/as much cheese & dressing as you want (dressing shouldn't be high in sugars)  nuts  eggs  veggies, of course  no fruits    Most ppl lose anywhere from 7-10 lbs this 1st wk. I'm going on Week 12 & lost 39 lbs.  Good luck!|`|6rmXxCR1aa	nah, don't hear it is not true. You must eat because you will be really hungry. You just need a Calories counter, but in order to know what yours is. go to www.sparkpeople.com it is a free weight loss program  where you can ask any question as many as you can 24/7 and you can also post your own nutriontal (what you ate everyday) on your page you can make on it. then they will give you your calories counter everyday that help you lost weight, it did a great job with me too I lost over 30 pounds when I was with them last year.|`|zY6WXobEaa	DO NOT eat when you are not hungry(if that is hard for you try sugar-free gum)  When you are hungry eat foods that are good for you like fruits, vegetables, and meat.  Try to not drink soda-i know sometimes its difficult (im addicted to mountain dew)  If you don't like the taste of water you can drink flavored water or juice instead.  Also try to excercise more.|`|IVnKn8ckaa	All of these suggestions are great. No junk food, lots of water, running is great for weight loss, Eat 6 small meals a day and taking supplements can help when your in a rush. Have you ever heard of carb blockers. They block the first 500 calories you consume. You can get them from www.shoptga.com I really hope this helps.
s0TiTrd3aa	maybelline COLOSSAL is definitely the best.    just yesterday, i watched a demonstration where someone put it on her eyelashes (which were blonde) and her eyes looked massive and her lashes looked huge, long and full afterward.|`|pFS2LZGKaa	Lash blast from covergirl is amazing.

6JKMz004aa	Don't wear make up everyday IT IS gonna effect u, I'm a teen 14 though i love make up im trying my best to avoid it.  Go easy on the mascara. because i used to have these beautiful eyelashes but later my eyelashes were hard to even notice without mascara . wear it less not lots n the chemicals in mascara will ALWAYS effect your eyelashes.  to  make sure please compare your eyelashes now to your eyelashes when u didn't wear mascara..( in a picture of course )    Hope this helped.  Please tell me how the comparison turned out    ~ Make up expert   Realmage
c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Yeah dude, I know exactly how you feel.  Somedays (usually when I hate what I'm wearing or just feel yucky in general) I am so embarrassed to stand out in crowds so towering over the general female population seems like a tortuous spotlight.  But thats only 10% of the time.  Most of the time I draw a lot of confidence out of being tall.  I love stilettos and it took a lot of courage to start wearing them and actually tower over quite a few guys but you know, now I love it!  I love being that girl that people look at and think (and sometimes even tell me), wow she looks tall and thin like a model.  I love when short girls tell me that they hate having to wear heels all the time just to keep up.  (I feel their pain, but it also makes me smile to think that I have the option of not wearing heels and still being a bit tall) I love walking around thinking, yeah that's right, I'm tall AND I'm wearing heels!  Take that!  I know I'm probably gonna get a thumbs down for sounding like I'm full of myself, but like I said, I draw the confidence that I don't normally have in life out of being a little bit different then everyone else.  Some days all I want to do is blend in, but on the days that I don't, I love feeling like a skyscraper amongst other buildings who wish they were taller.  I love that I have that option.|`|AA11196507	trust me being tall is NOT a bad thing. im 5'4 and i really wish i was a little bit taller. wear the heels! who cares if you're taller.|`|QWl1Iy8Waa	I am the same height and and have gained a few pounds over the winter too. Be yourself, and just enjoy towering over the boys cause' trust me they won't bother you. :)|`|K7Eg3BIRaa	learn 2 love n embrace ur unique self. im 5'2'' i wouldn't mind being 5'5'' but its not gonna happen. I LOVE heels there sexy no matter if ur the jolly green giant! Know ur beautiful n let others know it 2!!|`|Jpby2f3Gaa	dont worry     im 5'1o~~~    honestly  i think tall is better than short.. and not just cause im tall  i used to want to be shorter, but then i just learned to be happy with wat i look like..    and that sounds really lame...  but its true(:    so be happy to be talll girl!|`|0b5f07e5bab316afb60fcb47e579b84faa	I'm 5'9! And trust me, I get comments on my height all the time. Everyone wants to be tall with long legs, right? At least that's what everyone tells me. Being tall makes you stand out =) be proud of it. And anyway, all the models have to be 5'9 or over (and we all know they're beautiful, lol).|`|1432c0954c023817987cb8c19c056361aa	Girl just be happy that you have a little height.  Besides, I don't think 5"9 is all that bad.  But you have to look at the fact that I'm only 5"2.  Just remember that we all wouldn't mind being something that we're not.  I would love to be taller  LOL!!!!!  Oh and enjoy wearing your heels!!|`|n9u1x72qaa	well i think it depends on how u are. if ur young than u dont need to be wearing heels. im in school and rarely anyone wears heels anyways. plus fats are really cute. maybe look into getting some cute girly flats.     hey if it makes u feel better im totally jelous of u cuz im really short, so i get teased about it all the time. but just dont let it get to u. that what i do =]|`|HwrmAgzuaa	Girl, tall is GORGEOUS  I know you don't think that now because I'm 5'7 and I feel self conscious about being tall.  But everyone keeps telling me taller is  better. In the working world especially, people will have more respect for you (kind of like how guys are more respected than girls :| )    Besides, what fun is moping? Just have fun!|`|7keIKlp6aa	Rock it. Love who you are and love your style. Get the tallest high heels you want. If you're confident in yourself, people will notice, and hey- they'll notice just how pretty you are.|`|dPACNP6Kaa	find things that compliment you. since your tall you must have long legs. flaunt them. use them to your benefit!

Hope this Helps!|`|Sv9SQqyoaa	you can definitely still wear heels  the people that see you in them   will see confidence in you   you foot size definitly is not bigger than average  (im a size 8 and i am 5' 7"  & i know people shorter than me with bigger feet  and they are not going to grow anymore)  besides your lucky your tall because  you get to date the basketball players! jk lol :)  maybe you could be a plus size model  you are tall enough  and you will get to wear heels all the time  and make-up and dresses all the time! :)|`|4gcTZNZBaa	I'm 5'7'' and i know its easier to wear heels for me but I do and I still feel weird about it cause of my height.

hLdIO43Xaa	Rit Dye is easy because its a little pouch that you toss into the washing machine with the clothes you want to dye! Sold at any craft/fabric store like Michael's or JoAnn.    You have to check; maybe bring it to a bridal or prom place and ask the experts what type of fabric it is!    If it is silk satin, it's easy to dye (use an acid dye). If it's cotton satin, it's also fine to dye so long as there's no more than 10 percent spandex/lycra in it. However, if (like most) it's polyester, I wouldn't bother! There's a type of dye you can use with polyester satin but you have to boil it with the cloth for an hour - which is likely to shrink your jacket.

First of all  1 The design is very ugly the design is all over the place.   2 I don't like that long slit in the front it looks like a ball room dancing gown.   4 is a possibility with the colors, but if you look at the dress it looks like ruler lines going down the front on it or a snake design, hehe  But I would go with  3 I love the design it's not a confusing design.  The designs that are on the dress say alot about a dress|`|Zp4fCCKjaa	try asos.com  :)  xxoxoxo|`|Ngl0gBv5aa	number 2 is very pretty and it fits u|`|8HTdUIvsaa	your really pretty btw. and i like 3 and 4|`|wZYPFtL9aa	your very pretty, and if i were u 3 4 matches you rskin tone!
HE1cJJQYaa	you shouldn't have taken it out. cartilage piercing can take almost a whole entire year to heal and if you still have the ring in, you just prolonged that. use sea salt soaks and wash with an antimicrobial soap (dial, satin) and don't touch it! good luck, cartilage piercings are bitches|`|e158WyFGaa	No  it barely hurts|`|kp0QYdb9aa	idk dont worrie about it i have 8 carlige piercings and they hurt alot but i just dont do anything about it nuthing to worrie about it will hurt sometimes|`|QEeZgoViaa	That's normal mines hurted for about 2 months, but is because your ear is getting use too the piercing try to clean it thou. Because if not you might get a keloid.|`|so2y2lqIaa	well you could be elrigic to the medal because when i wear my earings  (nickle) they itch and it is very painful. so you could be have a reaction to they medal or it could be infected you should probably go to your school nurse or the doctor or where ever you got it peirced to see if it is infected.|`|VJpdmd0waa	No, at 4 months its still healing an now that you cant get it back through it has closed up some.   Ive had mine for a year an its just getting done healing.  You need to leave it out or have someone push it back through.  it might bleed if you push it back though but just clean it an it will be fine.|`|5YMkieeXaa	it might be but keep it VERY clean.    and if it does get infected, go to the place you got it done, and ask about how this might have happen and if you need to redo it (worse case.)|`|cd54a6aed5469ca63912c106ec5853c8aa	It can get infected (just like any piercing). I think you should go and see your piercer and he'll see what's going on. Best luck! Hope it isn't infected!
6UZ5Wzc7aa	Each to their own, who cares if others like it, it is about you. If you are truly happy with the tattoo and it means something to you go for it. It would look good on the top of your arm, don't get me wrong it would look good on the forearm too, but you have to think of factors such as how hairy your arm is, as thick hair will just hide the detail and true magnificents of the colour and tattoo, also forearms, especially the outside, are exposed to a lot of sun, your tattoo will fade and blur a lot quicker than if it is put somewhere that is not constantly exposed to sunlight.Also, go and see the tattooist that you are planning to do this tatt for you, she/he will be able to draw it up and alter it to your liking.|`|e61e220e96f1846a8c676b547798ecf2aa	I don't really think it would look good on a forearm. I don't know... Tattoo shops usually will draw tattoos up for you, won't they?|`|8ubWUh4yaa	DISGUSTED|`|84a92b794a6ae292684ad41ae82b80b4aa	10 points deserved .. First is this you ????? REALLY ???  What are you trying to be and say ??????  A tattoo is a picture of your feelings thoughts and expressions   Looking @ this design , You are lost and confused LOL SORRY.   Wait for a real life changing moment to occur.|`|mX0qaX3Eaa	I think it's pretty poorly designed and it's realisation is even worse. Not to mention the fact that it's clearly either a cover up or an expansion on an old piece.    Go and speak to a reputable local tattooist. Tell him what you want and he/she will draw something up personally that suits you and noone else.|`|rurfFLDkaa	yea its pretty cool just the only thing is the golden gate bridge isnt in socal. it would throw some people off|`|tiW6RAfLaa	i think it is tacky     i wouldnt date a guy that had a huge tattoo like that       sorry man|`|bKtpUETnaa	i think its cool
st5reHVjaa	dont get solid highlights (like blocks) that looks awful.  get lots of little ones.  yes: http://www.free-makeup-tips.com/images/t...  no: http://www.howtodothings.com/files/u1002... (too chunky)  i dont blame u for not wanting to dye ur whole head. maybe skip the blonde, and go with a lighter brown.|`|ZlKAswJiaa	I have the same description as you and although you don't want to, I dye my whole hair dark chocolate brown. As it fades and mixes I guess you could say with my hair, it changes colour and looks amazing! I get more comments on my hair about a month after I've had it done as opposed to when I have just got it done!!    You should try dark chocolate brown highlights. I think they would look best with dark skin also!!     Good luck!!|`|cbiHACrAaa	carmel sounds really pretty    from your description i think peekaboo highlights would look reaaly good.|`|SAQFsHEHaa	if people mistaken it for black then maybe get like a light brown highlight or something so that your brown hair will kinda show up i guess or caramel would be fine too =)
50qgybd5aa	sounds like covergirl for some reason.
1zy9ckbzaa	If you need medium to full coverage, then use Makeup Forever's Mat Velvet + Mattifying Foundation.    The best blush out there, that lasts all day is actually a cheek stain.  It's not a powder but a liquid.  It is called Stainaic by TheBalm.    Dior Mascara is the best.    Concealer - TheBalm TimeBalm concealer.|`|d28ed6e6ffd2770c91461a1986db486daa	www.makeupalley.com    find something that suits you. I'm on the hunt for most of those, but MAC's fluidline using small angled 266 brush and MaxFactor 2000 calorie are my favourite eyeliner and mascara. Good luck!|`|jcxtxBm0aa	mary kay is the best....i love this make up...and hopefully you will too its great try it out =]|`|dO5D1zhkaa	MAC is pretty good, it stays on forever, but for pretty much everything (mascra, eyeliner, foundation concealer, everything) i like covergirl.|`|IMOKF6alaa	Foundation i would use pur minerals its amazing, i have sensitive skin and i tend to break out a lot and with this i did not really get many blemishes on my face. Blush i would say mary kay. Eyeliner i would say almay or M.A.C. Mascara i recommend M.A.C's fiber lash or the lash pro, they are both great! and for concealer M.A.C's studio concealer or Neutrogena healthy skin concealer.|`|tzxYihQNaa	Dinair Airbrush Makeup by far!! It works as a concealer and foundation. It makes my skin look flawless. I can also do my blush and eyeshadow with it. It takes me a totally of 4-6 minutes to do all my makeup. I will honestly never go back to conventional makeup. You should go to google and type in Dinair and you'll find their site...=)|`|SHdrYV0Naa	mac make up|`|vwu6PU4eaa	welll i loveee bareminerals eyeshadow  any mabelline mascara is goood  foundation-- bareminerals amazing, or any other powder type from mabeylinne  i dont use eyeliner so i can't help you there
OIa6za0Baa	the fashion tape or as my friends call it the "titty tape" deff works.      if you want to wear a bra try clear bra straps that may make you feel more comfortable.|`|cupxeThNaa	A strapless dress with right fitted bra underneath should stay in place on its' own if it is fitted properly.  If you still feel that it will not stay up and are self conscious about ask a dress boutique for some dress tape.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	a strapless long line bra is a bit old-fashioned, but it will do the trick beautifully, and give you a pronounced hourglass shape, as well.    with the long line on top and spanx, or another good smoother, on bottom, you'll be fabulous!|`|WCOeyt0Haa	sometimes double sided tape work. but you can also buy dress tape.|`|qxAcwDsjaa	i like to wear strapless dresses too, but my lovely 34C's hold it up good and sexyy
5YMkieeXaa	when you get to the end of your hair flip it at an angle so it flips.|`|DoPFbjsraa	try crimping it instead??  if its long enough plat it when its wet, leave to dry and take out plat it will be crimped...  looks HOT!|`|bDbXGNYhaa	dont straighten it?|`|SRs6xcxPaa	dont  straighten it its bad for your hair|`|LgtQ6DTkaa	Layers all the way. I love men who have layers on their hair.
2epeZrOGaa	It looks wig-like.|`|UmDqxnr6aa	ya. cute.!  i wish i could pull off black hair.|`|bDbXGNYhaa	i think so. you dont have blonde eyebrows like this one girl who dyed her hair black|`|LgtQ6DTkaa	Uh, duh, you look absolutely gorgeous!

Super cute.|`|1dXkyXJ2aa	wow u really did a good jop =] it looks super cool and really awsome=) haha i lik the spongebob shirt|`|ARA4Q1Sfaa	for sure.      but probably fill in your eyebrows with a dark brown eye pencil, (so its not as obvious you died your hair)|`|kkAEK64Haa	light eyes and dark hair is an amazing mix.  im jealous.  ha ha    your really pretty too!|`|BIgj6h6oaa	hellz yeah! :D  I'd try darkening your eyebrows a bit, though.   it looks a little odd not having the eyebrows the same color.   just like a light brown might work, so it's not too drastic.     :)  you're cute! (no homo. hah.)|`|nA8Qc4ZAaa	yes, lol it looks amazing :o your eyes and hair are like the perfect combo|`|ZyQFd6NVaa	Yes!! You look super cute. I dont recommend coloring your eyebrows like other people suggested, just make your eye makeup darker and more dramatic. But good job!! you picked a lovely hair color for your face. I was wondering if you teased it or if you just naturally had that volume? Its amazing!
2ZtKyUoLaa	your pretty    and dont lose the nose ring just cause that BITCHHHH said   you look pretty|`|VAoG53KYaa	AVERAGE  love the nosering|`|z3uUtr33aa	no. but you obviously have low self esteem, how? besides you name being "fatty mcfats" your asking the internet if your pretty... yes, these are people on the internet but it's still the in.ter.net where HUNDREDS of people get raped per day by posting pictures of themselves asking about their apperence. you need to start respecting yourself more. good luck hun.|`|eNEMhcy6aa	You are pretty but the 1st thing I see when I look @ you is the nose ring.  You have great facial features & nice bone structure.  However, I can't tell if your hair is short or just up.  But judging by this pic, you need to cut/style it in a more feminine way.  Good luck!|`|gYFpaY9oaa	you don't have to ask people if you are pretty. A person can be pretty, but then their personality could make them ugly. so, no one can tell just by a picture! if you have a great personality and are kind that makes you beautiful! [ :|`|HzNcf5JDaa	I think you're really pretty looking but you're not facing the camera very well.  It doesn't really matter does it? I mean it's surprising but most people don't care how pretty you are, if you're a b i t ch then you're outta their life quickly. If you're the complete opposite of a b i t ch and aren't the prettiest person ever, they won't care what you look like, they'll still love you. Personality is the bigger impact.|`|T1oaQpv8aa	A big N and O|`|HZagGajhaa	nooooooooopeeeeeeeeeeeeee|`|C0KejMfVaa	NO! stop asking this question|`|fj3sHFfRaa	YOU LOOK FINE.

You should do something about your hair, though...|`|7dPwXcItaa	ewwww, fugly, fat, ugly face, bad clothes, nose ring, short hair, looks 10!|`|Ep9KbDhsaa	Outward beauty is a matter of opinion but regardless whether or not you are to other people you need to have better self esteem than to ask people whether or not you are pretty on a website and then want a reason why. I would say yes because everyone is pretty in their own way whether inside or out. I am personally not that shallow to judge someone on their outward appearence.|`|uQWKSQMzaa	Yeah, I guess.|`|ITJxXhQ0aa	nope|`|st5reHVjaa	not really... well, u have good facial features, but ur not using them.  grow ur hair longer and maybe add some makeup? u look like u just rolled out of bed.  try a powder foundation  and BANGS!!|`|TMi1GhSHaa	you definitly need a boyfriend, you have LOWWW self esteem.. seriously.. the pic u posted isnt even showing your face lol.|`|BMsy73rhaa	It's hard to be objective with a small pic taken at an angle.

RtQuJ70aaa	Many herbal extracts can work on skin tags: Tea tree oil, Castor oil, Bloodroot paste...    You can also get rid of a skin tag by tying a string around its base for a couple of days until it falls off.    Note though that none of these methods can be used on skin tags on the eyelids.    Below are some articles that you may find helpful:|`|M8HVkIikaa	http://www.getridofthings.com/get-rid-of...|`|HVDopA6Caa	you could try to freeze it off.

Depends how big it is, I had a small one on my ear no bigger then a small earring and i had to have a doctor remove it.

M8HVkIikaa	STOP popping the spots, also known as pimples and zits. This may make the pimple look worse due to inflammation and irritation. Popping a zit can spread infection under the skin and produce even more pimples than before. If you do pop a spot then immediately clean it with soap and water or rubbing alcohol in order to prevent infection. If a pimple erupts in a particularly bothersome place, learn how to target a single pimple. And if you're determined to pop, learn how to pop a pimple safely and properly.   Remove any make-up you have on. Wearing make-up can clog pores, making them dirty and causing pimples.   Use a mild soap for sensitive skin but it doesn't matter exactly what type of soap you use. It can be designed for acne-prone skin or not, but you will want to treat your skin gently. Harsh antibacterial soap may actually make your acne worse by irritating skin.   Remove dead skin cells regularly by exfoliating. Use a gentle scrub with natural defoliants like ground walnut shells, or use an over-the-counter chemical defoliant like salicylic acid or glycolic acid. Adding ground walnut shell to a thick moisturizer like cocoa butter can be effective too. Take caution, because over-exfoliating can actually increase the likelihood of acne by irritating the skin. Pat dry, rather than rubbing, since rubbing can cause irritation to the fresh skin you've just revealed.   Use a good toner. Spray onto face or wipe on with a cotton ball and wipe off with a clean, dry cotton ball. This gets rid of excess cleanser and tightens pores. Good, inexpensive choices include plain witch hazel for normal to dry skin, lemon juice, or 3% hydrogen peroxide for oily skin. 70% ethyl rubbing alcohol can also be used for severe oiliness, but it can really dry out your skin and irritate it more. Some toners are medicated, and this stage is the best for using a medicated product if you're only going to use one medication.   Bacteria in pores is one cause of spots. Reduce the amount of bacteria by using toners containing anti-bacterial agents like alcohol, peroxide and benzalkonium chloride, and by using creams that contain benzoyl peroxide (ask your doctor about benzaclin, with moisturizer if you have dry skin, as it works better than just plain benzoyl because benzoyl takes up to 8 weeks before improvement is seen) which kill bacteria as well as cause the skin to regenerate faster.   Maintain a routine. Most acne treatments take time to work. It usually takes between two and eight weeks before you see any significant improvement, so you are going to have to be patient. Once you've gotten your acne cleared up, it's important to continue with the treatment that's working so it does not return.   If all else fails, contact a doctor. Mild antibiotics that are available only by prescription can help reduce acne. Keep in mind though, that the widespread overuse (taking antibiotics when you really don't need them or for something they don't treat) and misuse (not taking medication for the specified amount of time) of antibiotics has led to the development of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria. That means that the antibiotics won't work for the things they used to (including your acne).   Keep hair off of your face if at all possible. If you want to keep your bangs, then consider taking showers regularly or keeping your forehead clean with oil-dabbing cloths / clean tissues / etc.   Get good sleep. Stress increases your skin's oiliness, which, combined with sweat and dirt, can clog pores and cause pimples. (Change your pillowcase frequently.)   Acne medications may cause your skin to initially break out worse than before because all FDA-approved acne medications (benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, and sulfur) are causing your skin to regenerate faster. This brings existing acne pimples already under your skin (but not visible yet) to the surface, which in turn causes a massive but fortunately temporary break out. Give the medications time to work -- about one to two weeks -- and you will notice a big difference in the quality of your skin.   See a dermatologist if over the counter remedies do not work. They specialize in skin care and can prescribe you medicines that help you improve it.   Drink plenty of water. Staying well hydrated can help your condition improve, because the "waste management" control system in your body requires a lot of water to do its job. Without enough water, the body has difficulty removing some waste products efficiently.   Look for face washes which contain the active ingredient benzoyl peroxide. This is the key ingredient in some of the best face washes. use a 5-10% benzoyl peroxide of mild to moderate acne and 10% for severe.   Try smashing one tablet of aspirin in a small bowl, then adding lemon juice to the mixture. Aspirin is acetesalicylic acid, chemically related to salicylic acid. Apply to the affected areas overnight. It boosts the healing process while reducing redness.   Try putting toothpaste (past|`|20M2yA9eaa	I use Neutrogena too and I love love love their products.  The one I use on my face is actually the Body Clear body wash with the scrubbing bits in it.  I like to slather (and I mean slather) my face with Noxzema first (after I rinse with warm water of course) and leave the Noxzema on for about two minutes, until you feel the tingle.  Then rinse it off and follow with a pea size amount of the Neutrogena body wash.  Massage it in small circles all over your face and neck.  Not too rough so that the granules scratch you, just enough to exfoliate all the dead skin.  Leave the Neutrogena on for at least a minute, up to two or three.  You will feel it breaking off all the dead skin.  Rinse your face thoroughly and you don't have to use acne cream unless you want to.  Do this twice a day (morning and night) and you will see results quickly.  Your face will be so smooth and clear.  If your skin gets dry easily, then only use the body wash at night or in the morning, and use your extra gentle facewash instead.  Also, use your regular facewash once during the day to get rid of excess oil.      Good luck and keep up your beauty regimen.  It will only help!!|`|k4NAnEYpaa	the neutrogena face wash is pretty good. Though I recomend proactive.|`|JIel7eM5aa	Mario Badescu's Acne Facial Cleanser.  www.mariobadescu.com.

zY6WXobEaa	Naturally curly hair needs moisture to keep it healthy and looking beautiful, rather than dried out and frizzy. We're not talking about grease, but you should definitely be avoiding products with drying alcohol.    Some curly haired girls will skip every other shampoo and just use conditioning rinses. You should shampoo at least once at week if your scalp is oily or if you have a building up of products. However, curly hair will become too dry and frizzy if you shampoo too often.    Use a moisturizing shampoo to help hydrate your scalp. Another tip is to comb some conditioner throughout your hair before shampooing.    On the non-shampooing days just rinse your hair with warm water, apply conditioner and rinse well. This will give you clean hair without stripping away the protective oils.    If mousse is not enough to stop your hair from going frizzy, then you should use some leave-in conditioning products, or anti-frizz hair serums.        John Frieda has a huge range of Frizz-Ease products specifically made to control frizzy, puffy, flyaway hair.     Step 1: Cleanse with Frizz-Ease Smooth Start Defrizzing & Nourishing Shampoo.    Step 2: Condition with Frizz-Ease Defrizzing & Nourishing Conditioner.    Step 3: Use Frizz-Ease Hair Serum. This serum works brilliantly when used with the other products, but can also be used successfully alone to control frizz. Apply the serum to wet hair.

FupqCfK0aa	In my opinion, dark eyebrows are the best looking. you don't want light haired eyebrows because nobody can see them. Thick, dark eyebrows are FINALLY in style (look at any fashion magazine, half of the models have thick black brows). Personally, I say you should flaunt your eyebrows, not change the color of them. Being different is finally in style.    but, do whatever you feel most comfortable in.

F3FblS6Haa	it's pretty uncommon for girls to shave their arms. i'm not saying you shouldn't, but not a lot of people do. and if you think about it, your arms are more exposed than your legs, so why not go ahead and shave those too?|`|4YqBHfkkaa	I do.|`|a0b40c7a80dd3de9085039f8daf76ec6aa	if they want to, there's nothing wrong wiht it, it's not like unshaved armpits|`|ukJ0rk2vaa	Wax it so it doesn't grow back all prickly. But I don't think there's anything wrong with shaving your arms either.|`|YPAHeUucaa	I do, because I have really dark hair everywhere. Girls shouldn't do it if they won't keep up with it and shave every day, because it's quite annoying feeling when the hair is growing back. I don't see a problem with it at all.    EDIT:  To those saying bleaching is better, it's not. It becomes very obvious that your arms are covered in light hair. Especially when you or someone else feels it.|`|umJrcAyLaa	i do|`|jPJaSIXPaa	well most girls i know don't shave there arms but if yours are hairy then yeah go ahead and shave them.|`|bSsLQdhgaa	umm.. this is weird.. but yeah u should shave there arms if there as hairy as a monkey..|`|b4GYpz9Maa	Girls should shave their arms and every other part of their bodies.  That way they are silky smooth to touch ... silky smooth is more feminine than running your fingers through arm hair|`|D4NOrqM7aa	umm...idk if u noticed  but every guy that answered this said yes.  and i think you want to know what tha guys think.  so i think u should shave 'em=]  good luckerzz=]|`|PogMq7Pcaa	heres what i do... im 12    like on the part of my arm that nobody sees my arm hair is REALLY dark so i shave some of that. and then i randomly shave all other parts of my arms. it is SOO unnoticable though...    but yeah if ur friends then u can it wouldnt hurt anybody|`|W840msNTaa	yes, absolutely yes|`|KbnAj2DVaa	i shave mine cuz i dont want to look like a barbarian or something lol and it makes my arms really smooth and soft|`|KDst9z5Naa	Yes , they should shave their arms.|`|YyOgywaPaa	oh yes u would think all of they do put a lot do not|`|rVbY5qBsaa	No because then it gets prickly which is strange and grosser than being hairy. If your hair really bothers you bleach it.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	Ye, i do it.  My arms are always so soft and smooth.  I love them!|`|ohOANFjFaa	Yes.  Girls shouldn't have any hair below their eye brows.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes|`|aIrKSvs6aa	ohh defintly, its a mad turnoff|`|TPdQBF2yaa	YES, nothing turns off a guy more than a girl with gorrila arms|`|vGxipYJnaa	No. Never. If they want to remove that hair, they should wax it. When someone shaves, the hair grows in spiky and stubbly.. and that would be awful on arms. Imagine brushing up against someone with arm stubble accidentally - it would be like sandpaper.|`|1qCpI0tRaa	If they are embarrassed by having maybe a lot of hair or dark hair!!! Its up to them what can it hurt??|`|cbefEuHWaa	yeah i hate girls with hairy arms they look like savages|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	I do and I love it.  I love having smooth arms.  Most girls don't need to, but I wish those who have really hairy arms would.|`|3izco6tXaa	I had a couple of friends who had dark hair on their arms and shaved it.  They hated it because it felt spiky and rough when it started to grow back.  I don't have this problem so I'm not speaking from experience, but maybe waxing is a better option.      I think if a girl feels comfortable and feels prettier shaving her arms then she should do it.  But be warned, it does feel quite rough.|`|lz26T6A6aa	No, I think it looks freaky and unnatural when they do.  Hair is natural, all humans have it. It's no big deal.

I am a nail tech, and advise that you not do your own nails simply because of the dangers of not applying the product properly and the dangers of having the product lift from  your nails causing a water stain which can turn into a fungal infection...which in the worst way could cause you to lose your nail or even your finger.  Just leave the nail enhancements to those of us who are trained in the craft and enjoy. It's better to pay the price for the proper technique than to have to pay the penalty of poorly applied enhancements.|`|AA11485944	please do not do your own nails...they will probably turn out bad, please just go to a nail salon and have someone do it for you, it may be expensive but at lest it will look really good/ nice and they will last.|`|fYCdP6dhaa	Go to Superdrug, lots of various styles, shapes and colours and trust me do your make up and then put them and too much glue and get them straight when first applying|`|ENimhaF8aa	hi, i tried most & I find naillene are the best, not too long come in all styles (I use french manicure) & look really natural they last well too about a week, if you just want them for a nite out they do pre glued ones which i thought wouldnt stay on, (but do!) and dont damage your real nail. x

AA10729271	Two steps:    1. First you have to do a regular exfoliation because dead skin cells can clog your pores. Now you can go an buy some expensive face scrub but most of them don't work worth crap, or you can try this basic face scrub which works wonders. Trust me, with one use your skin will feel as smooth as silk.     Simply mix 1 teaspoon of regular granulated sugar and then add a few drops of milk or water to make a paste. Rub into you face in gently circle motions and rinse off with warm water.     Note: you might want to do this before a shower because the sugar can get into your hair and make it sticky. It only needs to be done once a week and this recipe can easily be expanded and used as a body scrub, just use a cup of sugar and a few spoons of milk to make the paste. For the body scrub you can add a few drops of your favorite scented oil or even perfume.    2. Clay mask for pore extraction. Now that you've removed all the dead skin buy a simple clay mask (St.Ives clay mask works very well and is affordable). As the clay dries it will suck the oil from your skin, with the St. Ives you can actually see the oil being sucked out of your pores. You can do this more than once a week depending on how oily your skin is.    This works far better than those rip off pore strips. You should see your pores shrinking after even one round.    Finally you can use a face cream that tightens pores, usually something designed for oily skin. You may have to try a few before you find one you like.|`|rqk4cXydaa	chilled yogurt is a really good solution to make your pores smaller but if you don't want to go the natural way I would recommend neutrogena pore refining cleanser|`|AA12069442	Proactiv has solved all of my skin problems.

f1bdd8f3dd409cdd71223c7d68e40664aa	I agree that you should take it as a  compliment.  Guys don't like girls who wear a ton of makeup.  They prefer a more natural look.

The men I talk to say they like it when a girl looks naturally beautiful instead of caking stuff onto their face--even if a woman wears a lot of make-up, they like it best when she looks natural.

According to the Mulberry site, they are not carrying them in pink, but they do have a red in the alligator.|`|sO1tkGunaa	now, how am i supposed to see the purse in that little tiny picture?|`|3oGRNQKyaa	looks a little chanel...  but i dont think so...i am only around 20%sure..    bigger pics help a LOT|`|evEJxv06aa	its a wildkin brand and it costs $26.99 its a very nice bag you should buy it before any one else does ok.
d28ed6e6ffd2770c91461a1986db486daa	Strangely enough, I used to use that and started using Covergirl's Trublend Foundation. Generally I use the more expensive stuff, but this works so well with my skin. The shade is perfect (i have a bit of greek in me so my skin's yellow undertoned, yet very pale) and it covers up some discoloration. I have combination skin and I can wear this and not break out at all.    Also, it only costs me $18 AUD (and as XE said, 8). The only con is if you have really oily skin it can smudge, but I have a translucent powder I brush over the top and it stays on for ages. Hope this helps :)|`|st5reHVjaa	def. cover girl trublend  its so light and yet covers my flaws  but not if you have big zits.  it's good for large pores.|`|jcxtxBm0aa	mary kay.com   they have the best make up
8THz1sp9aa	I always wait until the 4/5th day. The best lotion ever is cetaphil moisturizing cream(fragrance free), it works amazingly i'll never use any other lotion!|`|cHtjrn4Faa	your tattoo is not healed after 3 days. it will take about 2 weeks for initial healing and up to a month for the new skin to regenerate itself. for the first 5 days wash the tattoo twice daily with anti bacterial soap and apply FRAGRANCE FREE lotion every 2 to 3 hours|`|267c2f32faefea8d7cfc0c410537cb2faa	You should have already been putting some lotion or some other stuff on it since day one.

29b36985ed4df1ad55d9f8c840ba7ec4aa	they wont see anything but u just have to pull ur underwear down so they could do the tattoo but don't worry they wont see anything   hope i helped|`|3kNeWYvdaa	Well it doesn't seem to be exactly in the pubic area so I don't think she'll have to remove her underwear to get it done it depends on how big the tattoo will be if it's small then no nothing whatsoever will be seen. If it's medium sized she might have to pull it down ever so slightly but nothing will really be seen. If it's large the answer is yes to all your questions. If you don't want anyone to see her vagina don't let her get the tattoo too big.|`|8THz1sp9aa	They will have her take her pants/panties down as low as possible, but they will not see her vagina. They'll cover below the area that is being tattooed with paper towels so no one will see or touch her private area. Tattoo artists are very professional, they've done risky tattoo's such as the one your fiance wants several times in their career, it doesn't phase them. If you are really uncomfortable about it, why don't you go with her while she gets the work done?|`|vVmia1w3aa	No, they wouldn't have to remove her panties. If they request her to, she should leave immediately.|`|odRuRys9aa	I have one exactly where your girlfriend does and I didn't have to remove my panties... If the artist requests that, something is really wrong.|`|D27mJKmWaa	I had one done today.. exactly the same area. They pulled them down slightly.. not enough to see anything. They won't remove her panties no.. unless she says she doesnt want ink on them! They wouldnt go anywhere near her vagina... they literally pull the pants down an inch.|`|5Mx6IQWxaa	she'll just need to roll them down they wont see her "private area"|`|lAXPvu2Saa	Try and get a female artist, would that make you feel more comfortable?
6L9jJnchaa	Another short answer:  Yes.  Here's a picture of what happened to mine.  Look at the "P"    http://s9.photobucket.com/albums/a85/ebi...    This was right after I had it filled in again.  I got a big stretch mark right on it.|`|29b36985ed4df1ad55d9f8c840ba7ec4aa	well if the baby is coming from the belly den i think the tattoo will get mess up but if its coming from the bottom part then u don't have 2 worry|`|5Mx6IQWxaa	short answer: no, it will be fine as long as you take care of it with lotions.|`|b22a981ee5ef67b133213156e0b13a5aaa	Short answer: YEP!|`|MlZKqf54aa	yes the parts on your stomach will get stretched and most likely permanently stay that way. my friend has a tattoo on her stomach and a part of it is all stretched out and has been now for years.
U8R2o1P3aa	They aren't HUGE they're pleasantly plump, lol.  I like your lips (that sounds weird), they compliment your face :)  You are a very pretty person, I envy you.

9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Cover it up if you want to use a traditional tanning bed. Sunblock and a towel should protect it. (be sure to use sunblock on any other tattoos you have too!)|`|OIa6za0Baa	i wouldnt risk it.  a bronzing moisturizer should do the trick. jergens or neutrogena have good self tanners|`|c3adf6eebebb43dc6a353232fb6a25d9aa	As long as it's covered it should be ok, but you should get a spray tan instead- those don't cause cancer!|`|BN9WlwDZaa	When I use to tan, they had a lotion just for tattoos.  You may want to ask what they recommend!

AA11101361	The pads are a treatment.  You need to clean your face to get rid of the dirt and sweat to treat your acne.  There are cleansing wipes, like Ponds that are used in place of cleansing.  The pads can be very drying and overuse can cause more acne.  Generally when I start clients on a straight acne regimen we start with the cleanser and add in products so we don't overdry the skin.  Over dry skin gets oily and breaks out.  All you should need to do is wash your face in the morning, use the pads and moisturize.|`|OIa6za0Baa	they normally direct the washing part towards girls who wear a lot of makeup.    you should be fine with just using them without washing|`|fUhosu5Raa	I use them that way before i go to bed... they take my makeup off fine! so i dont see anything wrong with using them that way|`|ACaxtw7Paa	well i think they say that cuz after all the stuffs off ur face, the pad can get deeper into ur skin and prevent acne faster....
Pp7ThhNmaa	Use main n tale conditioner, you can find it in the pet part over at walmart, or at Walgreen's in the shampoo area, it has horses on it. Yes this can be used for animals and people I've used it and it helped my hair grow faster. Also get your hair trimmed first, just a little bit to help it be more level and it will grow faster with using the conditioner. Try not to use too much of a straightener or blow drier, because all your doing is damaging your hair even more. Try not doing much to your hair after getting it trimmed and using the conditioner, let it air dry. If you brush your hair as it's wet (as long as you use a good conditioner) it will help it be for straight by the time it's dry.|`|pwC0bEmHaa	i think it will grow|`|A73OWrZWaa	Get it cut and wate and wait and wait it will  grow but get it cut normily|`|bAmpR3Exaa	that looks long in the pic?|`|IjMHcECzaa	Really curly hair tends to stop growing after a certain length, heres why.  People with straight hair have hair roots which come STRAIGHT out.. at a 90 degree angle.  People with 45 degree angled roots have wavy hair  People with 0 degree angled roots have wavy hair, like it comes out their scalp sideways... thats why its curly and THATS why it starts to slow down big time.    Train your hair with a brush, particularly at the roots, to come out at a 90 degree angle from your head. Do it every day all the time unless you start having major hair loss :)    Straightening it is fine as long as the heats do not touch the roots. If you do touch the roots, remember, 90 degree angle otherwise it will still grow out curly and stop    try using conditioner on the roots to help as well  but not alot because that causes hair fall.    eat healthy, plenty of water.|`|vOukAHowaa	WHY no Vitamins?!?! They help drastically- and i have the same problem mine was literally allll the way down my back and then started to fall out and to this day has not ALL grown back YET. Anyway turned out mine was because of my Thyroid. And if you are vitamin defficent that will also cause it along w/ a few other things so get yourself checked out, YES a Dr- a simple blood test can tell ALOT. AND it is very possible that the constant use of the straightner could be causing major damage as well- BUT it sort of depends on how long u have been doing that etc- I know someone that did it on a daily basis and had and still does have long hair and has been doing that for YEARS soooo,,,,,,,, Another ting that can't hurt is to use some hot oil treatments on your hair BUT they can weigh it down but they are really good on repairing split ends.Good luck! I still miss my LONG hair :(  Even though now it IS it still is not like it used to be so i know how ya feel kind of ?
BILIAKSOaa	I would say without. The glasses hide your eyes. They are really pretty. I love the blue.

I like glasses on certain girls, and you'd be one of them. I don't think they take away from your beautiful eyes. I'd say where them.|`|CZIQMIr0aa	I think without, you have really pretty blue eyes and they're more obvious without the glasses!

Maybe they are just jealous because your are pretty. && they feel insecure around you or maybe it could be your personality that makes them think that?|`|ZXJJmcG6aa	i think it's because you look the best in all these pictures so people are like well you look the best so you obviously trying to loook the best people are like that...just coz they don't look good lol|`|1pUIwBM1aa	Ohhh hahaha WOW! I thought this was a halloween costume and you were trying to be a vampire!

dxeb0BfBaa	If your on a budget bright colours aren't the best idea. They last less then a week so you have to recolour every 3/4 washes in some cases. Also the bleaching does a lot of irreparable damage so think carefully before you do it.|`|heCSHJ13aa	hot topic doesnt always have a lot of colors at the store, so go to amphigory.com and you can see the whole line of Special Effects dye.    You'll need to bleach the hair before you dye it or it won't be bright, and won't last as long.    And the color will wash out in a couple weeks, some faster than others (usually reds and colors in that family fade the fastest)     Wash your hair in cold/cool water, it helps keep the color a little bit. Hot water opens the hair cuticle and lets the dye leave the hair faster.|`|6IVnDR1zaa	go to anyy walgreens? or wal mart.  The sell bright color hair dye with bleach included.  for 10$ i think. =]    and it works good|`|gNV3bmDwaa	well i don't know where abouts you live but where i live theres a shop called time bomb, they do bright colours for 5 a bottle..  they have a website if you want to order from there, just type in time bomb in google.    hope this helps.
gIEWfDj3aa	Consider dropping the moisturizer.  You do not need it.    My skin produces more oil when I use harsher cleansers - products specifically for oily skin.   If you already use these products, consider something milder - for combination skin.  You will know in a few days if it is working for you.|`|652c9c4ac00397e3d3a672481ae4771baa	Get a good cleanser.  I have the AcneFree system, and also the Clearasil daily cleanser.   Your cosmetics could also be causing some of the oil, it's probably clogging your pores.  Try a cleanser and less makeup- see if that works at all. (:    You can also leave some honey on your face for about 10-15 minutes, then wash it out thoroughly. Honey is a good astringent, as well as lemons.|`|AA12186207	Sorry to hear that. Change your diet.|`|zJ6zoV0Laa	Try no make-up at all.     Or some cleanser.    Their are some products that help with oily skin. I think Avon does them.|`|OIa6za0Baa	you have to wash and cleanse your face before moisturizing    any face wash from the drug store that will get your makeup off and not be too harsh on your skin|`|OQb533GPaa	don't use those rice papers or oil wipes to git rid of oil on your face . . . this will only dry your face out even more and cause you to produce more oil.  people say change your diet, but that doesn't really have much to do with the oils your face produces (if you do a little research, most dermatologists will say so).      find a good moisturizing cleanser.  don't use cleansers that say "for oily skin" . . . it's been my experience that when i used those my face would get even oilier.  i think it's because it throws off the balance of your skin even more.  a good moisturizing cleanser will be very creamy and thick.  i used to use a brand called "milk," but they stopped making the facial wash.  i then started getting into Mary Kay which makes a very nice 3-in-one facial cleanser.  this works nicely for a while (i used it for one - two years).  your skin likes it when you change products every so often.  i currently use Murad products which aren't too bad, the trick is, though, you gotta wash your face in the morning and afternoon, otherwise it doesn't work as well.  with the mary kay and the milk, i didn't have to do that.     another good idea would be 2-3 times a week use a microderm abrasion (facial scrub).  Mary Kay also makes an excellent microdermabrasion scrub and a replenishing cream to go on afterwards.  they work very nicely.  they are a little pricey, but sometimes you can get the Mary Kay rep to come down on price . . . or you could become a rep yourself and only have to pay 50% of the price.    Good luck and God bless you.|`|rmEhNpHQaa	wash it|`|GmTs1BB1aa	Buy oil wipes. i forget what brand they are but you can find them in any drug store.|`|pluEas6maa	Wash night and day and whenever too oily with Nuetrogena in the blue jar.

Make up does make us look prettier, but  makeup just enhances the features that already exist. Natural beauty is the most beautiful of all =)|`|e2Pf2gJoaa	i have always worn lip gloss. not lipSTICK. i hate lipstick. too much for a teen i think. an 11 year old- lip gloss. 12 year old- lip gloss, concealer, foundation, a little blush if its not too obvious, mascara. 13 year old- all of the above plus eyeliner, maybe a light color of shadow. shimmer. bronzer. 15- all of the above and almost anything else not bright lipstick. just remember make up is supposed to enhance your already beautiful features, not change you into a different face. also, when applying make up, focuz on one thing, such as eyes, OR lips, OR glowing skin. dont play up everything on the same day, or it is fakelooking and overwhelming. hope i helped :)|`|Cha4lyL9aa	I started wearin make-up at 16, with havin spots make-up made it worse!  Rimmel good brand to start using, just blusher is enough to begin with and concealer when spots appear.   Then move on to mascara, once u've left school. with skin so pure no need to spoil it.   Dont feel pressured into wearing make-up, you will naturally know when to start using make up as u get older.   Doent look flattering caked in make-up too young|`|V9W6fMuVaa	The 11 year old is way to obsessed with something she shouldn't be.

Just remember that too much foundation is bad for your skin, and I hope you guys are taking it off everynight, properly!

(anymore then that looks like ur totally a loner..)  12- mascara and lip gloss. u dont need foundation yet, but im sure if its a special occasion or whatever, u can wear shadow and blush  13- mascara, lip gloss, and a little powder foundation, blush, some eyeshadow, maybe, just for special events  (14... i know u didnt ask, but im gonna say anyways= most everything except eyeliner. but not shadow every day. no one needs shadow every day)  15- as much as u want (even eyeliner) but not so much u look like a sl*t... (sry for language)    u should also upgrade makeup brands as u get older.  but eyeshadow every day looks trampy        once you are old enough to use makeup, you should know what looks good and what is too much.|`|oH9oFbbKaa	well im 12 and i just started wearing makeup last year. i think when you dont over do it then you are grown up enough to wear it. then again im what people call "emo" so i ALWAYS overdo it.

OuaUAAZlaa	these are the best boots ever ! i got mine from journeys- so try a journeys near you because they definitely sell them there.  i checked: delias, alloy, zappos, tillys, overstock.com, and pacsun.    i found them in a size 10 at this place: http://www.buckle.com/product/product_de...    i also looked on amazon, but they didnt seem to have them anymore, but maybe try to check back.    hope this helps !! :)|`|ZpLFNtTyaa	try delias.com they have cute boots.|`|pwC0bEmHaa	they seem nice u can try that|`|HjZZGkZVaa	Ohh! those are cute!

jXePpBoEaa	Primer does help your makeup stay on longer. I use Smashbox's photofinish primer. For a cheaper version, you can get Magix at Avon for about $10 (correct me if I'm wrong) or Rimmel's Fix and Perfect primer for $13.|`|Cha4lyL9aa	I have combination skin, its a pain. Estee Lauder foundation is good, i put it on in the morings and rarely have to touch it up. lasts 24 hours. A clear powder after appy foundation will help mattify oily skin. Blotting paper good to keep on u.   Cleasing skin day and night will help too. I use estee lauder face wash plus moisturizer.|`|3LWI3qfhaa	i have really oliy face 2. ANd by lunch my foundation has like disappered so i bought a primer at wallmart, and it didnt work, the same thing happened. u could maybe try like a better brand?|`|1zy9ckbzaa	I have very oily too.  So it took me many years and different products to find the best solution for my face.  I learned keeping makeup fresh takes a combination of different products, and yes primer is one of the steps. First, I would recommend using blotting papers before applying powder for touchups. The papers are amazing at soaking up the oil.  You can buy the Clean and Clear brand papers at drugstores for $6 and they are just as good as more expensive products. (Believe me I really have tried everything)  Then, before applying foundation, primer is essential.  It will help set your foundation.  I use the Smashbox Photo Finish Primer.  It cost just a little over $40 but worth it to me.

I use a special cream around my eyes as the skin is very thin, there are dark areas around my eyes no matter what I use nothing helps.  There are many good quality creams; it is actually your choice.   Check them out on the internet and try several different brands so you can compare.|`|fE1KEqCsaa	I have really sensitive skin, and suffer from eczema, acne and psoriasis.

XwCEZxvvaa	Okay, how long have you had the piercing? Why did you take it out, was it infected or not healing?    It sounds like it was a relatively new piercing. That means it'll heal over really, really fast. DON'T FIDDLE WITH IT! Just leave it alone for a while, try not to touch it more than you absolutely have to and wash your hands with lots of soap before you do. Clean the wound with a sea salt solution (tiny bit of salt + boiling water, leave it to cool) just to help keep it nice and clean. When it heals over, don't play with the scab or anything, hopefully when it drops off you won't even have a scar. If you do, rub vitamin E oil into it every day, that will help break down the scar tissue.    First and foremost though, leave it alone right now - playing around with it will encourage infection, and that'll make any scarring a lot worse.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	It's going to take a while for it to heal up. Do regular sea salt soaks for at least a few days, then vitamin E oil rubs when it's healed.    For more info:  http://www.articlefit.com/How-to-Retire-...|`|5Mx6IQWxaa	vitamin E oils/loations
dxeb0BfBaa	The only way to avoid split ends is to trim it before it splits. Every 6-8 weeks is how often you should get a trim. If you have healthy hair & trim it regularly you will only need to have half an inch cut off every time. If you dont cut your hair after a while it will start to break off faster than it grows. Now your best bet is to get all your split ends cut off & then keep getting half an inch cut off every 8 weeks so it can grow & be healthy at the same time. Straightening is a no-no especially for long hair. If you must straighten your hair you should use heat protection spray while your hair is wet & then blow dry & straighten with a ceramic iron. NB cutting your hair yourself can make it split & break more than it already is. Hairstylists have professional precision scissors with blades made from special hair friendly materials & sharpened at a particular angle which helps to seal the end of the hair after it is cut. Regular scissors dont seal the ends at all in fact they can actually tear the hair off.|`|Pp7ThhNmaa	I'm growing my hair out too and totally understand, trim just a little bit off the ends until it looks straight, you shouldn't have to cut much at all. And after you trim your hair it will look more level. Everyone has to get their hair trimmed once in a while, if you straighten your hair that's part of the reason, because straightening and blow drying until dry causes damage to your hair, use a good conditioner and that will help your hair. Main n tale conditioner helps your hair grow, I've used it and it's great! you can find it in the pet part of the store, like at walmart, over at Walgreen's it should be with the shampoo, it's a big bottle and it has some horses on it. Yes people can use it and animals.|`|cKeghBi7aa	just trim a little bit of it off  its not gonna be noticeable that u cut it|`|kknSPYxKaa	Get the trim, your hair will grow back.  For my spit end phobia I use Mane N' Tail, it mends split ends and keeps your hair manageable, healthy, soft and shiny, and best of all, it makes your hair grow faster! :)|`|heCSHJ13aa	1. Yes you do need a trim or they will split more and your hair will start to look really damaged at the ends and break off (become even shorter)  2. Don't straighten your hair everyday, it's horrible for your hair. Or at least get a ceramic straightener, a good one would be the chi ones from Ulta.  3. Use products to protect your hair against the heat, there are lots of balms/pomades and whatnot to help protect your hair pre-straightening.  4. Deep conditioner.      Also, nothing is going to "mend" split ends. You can get lots of things that will make your h air appear less damaged, but its not like there are products that will magically fuse the split ends back together into one strand.....
Pp7ThhNmaa	I think it would look fine on you, and you wanting to grow your hair out too? either way will be good on you.
3LPTLUczaa	You bought a LARGE instead of a SMALL? I would definitely have waited until I found my size (their website maybe) because those jackets aren't cheap.     I guess you could take it to a tailor but it wouldn't look quite right because of the double cuff (if I am thinking of the right jacket).
ReGhCqgVaa	1) In my opinion I don't think either is better. When I think cute..I think a baby face and amazingly adorable personality (when talking about the opposite sex at my age). When I think hot, I think amazing body. This is coming from the mind of a 15 year old girl though. Other people may not agree with my opinions.     2)I don't think A person is limited to only one. I think someone can be one or the other..or both. I also don't believe that someone can't change. A simple change in personality (Something you say or do) can make me believe someone is cute, Or a simple change in appearance. Also I believe that a change in a appearance (Such as hair/clothes) can make someone look "hotter".     3)I do believe that an individual can be declared both by others. I believe that someone can be both.    4)Again, coming from the mind of a 15 year old girl, I find the word Beautiful much more appealing then cute and hot. I consider it much more of a compliment then cute/hot.    5)I like being able to say other things then just beautiful. I do believe that I could manage not having any other synonyms for beauty though.|`|u7o75zipaa	1. It depends. Cute sounds a lot more young and innocent, whereas hot sounds more sexy and attractive. Depends which look you'd rather have. I'd rather be considered hot by guys I guess.    2. No, I believe people can change. You change as you grow up, and you can look entirely different.    3. Yeah, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. So it just depends on what attracts you personally.    4. I don't think there is any long-term beauty. Looks can come and go. It's all about the moment. I do feel that cute and hot are a far lower level of beautiful and handsome though.. they're a league of their own.    5. Definitely not just American.. we use that in the UK too! Lol. I don't think there is a delusion with hot and cute.. like I said above, it's just a different standard of attractiveness. It's like.. if someone was beautiful or handsome.. they're almost superhuman. They're mesmerising. But if they're hot or cute, they're simply attractive.    I hope this helps.  Nicole.|`|c3adf6eebebb43dc6a353232fb6a25d9aa	1. hot is higher up on the scale.  2. cute is usually used to describe someone young or younger than yourself, and hot refers to someone in your age group (it's creepy to say someone younger than you is hot..) so they can definitely first be cute and then grow into being hot.   4. beauty is the ultimate term- hot seems to refer to lustful thinking and cute can be used to describe a puppy. someone can be beautiful inside & out...they can't be hot on the inside.|`|Y3GNQ3Hraa	1. hot  2. yes, over time, maybe by growing up more  3. once and a while, but not most people  4. not the same as beautiful or handsome, pretty is more like a synanim for both|`|HiuZs5G5aa	1. i don't like cute or hot. i like attractive.   2. yes they can change  3. i don't see why not  4. no, leaving them as synonyms is better  5. not a disillusionment, it just shows that the english language is more descriptive and has more words to discripe things. makes it better.|`|TwNpl1gGaa	1. I wish to be considered Both Cute and Hot, Cute is a term i consider used when someone has a nice face, but you cant see their figure, or they don't have a nice figure what so ever,    When i try to look my best, In a dress and High heels, being Hot is what I'm trying to Attain, Hot can mean you have Only a nice body, or you have the whole package ; Face, Body, Bum, Boobs etc.   Though i must say, 'Hot' gives a girl more confidence, than Cute does.     2. It depends on who they are.  A boy with a Baby face, will most likely be Considered 'Cute' for the rest of his life, If he has a nice body, people will most likely say 'Hes cute, and has such a hot body'   For a girl, most of the time its easier for us to change from 'Cute' to 'Hot'   Dressing in a certain manner, Acting in a certain manner, Playing with your make up in a certain manner.   For a girl there's a lot more to change and Play around with.     3. Yes, Just like some girls may be considered Ugly by some, and Attractive by others.   It depends on what the individual thinks is Attractive.   If everyone tells you your Gorgeous, and One person calls you Ugly,   You should go with what the Majority of the people say.     4. If someone called you Beautiful, it tends to mean more than Hot, or Cute combined its an Elegant term.   I think Handsome and Beautiful, are Better, More meaningful .     5. French, has Beautiful, Cute, Handsome, Hot.   Portuguese, Spanish, Polish as well.   I know this because i   A) Am fluent in both Portuguese and Spanish   B) I know the basics in French  C) I have many Polish Friends, and they describe their crushes in Polish, (Cute, Hot, Sexy), Same goes for Asian's, They have ways to describe people as Cute, Hot, Sexy as well.   So if they have different words for it, I'm sure Russia, Germany, Greece and So forth do as well.|`|3WFqo8iMaa	1. hot  2.they can changee  3.why not.
Il0sobKDaa	it depends...it worked for me for about three weeks but then i stopped using it for two days and the first day it broke out really bad. i tried to get back on it but it just made it work. then i whent to the doctor for my SINUSES and got Persa-Gel 10 for my ACNE instead...so they didn't tell me anything for my sinuses...how rude!|`|ACaxtw7Paa	yeah it does.....but u'll see the results in like 2 weeks, not right away
WKpehOYfaa	that is absolutely positively normal! my sister has gone through just what your going through, three times! the heat and pain is normal and the 'goo' is normal too, and yes it'll be red when u do that too. its totally completely normal, all of it, i think the bump, too. just keep putting on the cleaner regularly and twisting the studs or spinning them when u remember to. just twirl them in ur ear, ya know? its good for it. hope it helped!|`|qWIha03Iaa	That "gooey" stuff is only puss. It's possible you could have a slight infection but don't worry. I don't think it's anything serious since the same thing happened to me. I would suggest using peroxide on them to help kill the bacteria and clean it out. You also still have quite a few weeks left to go so you'll just have to be patient hun. And don't forget to twist your earings every now and then also. :)|`|KzVLLPsOaa	that's normal when you get your ears pierced just make sure to clean your ears a lot and turn the earrings you don't have much longer till you take them out don't worry but don't take them out till that day just to be safe i would take them out march 1st and when you first take them out don't wear dang-ally  earrings for a while.|`|00nXfQBHaa	it just does that, it's normal. pick it off.|`|XyWr8lDyaa	ya that is gross......................................|`|B3jpU4Jraa	you have an ear infection you might be allergic to that type of metal or the instruments might noe have been clean and what you should do is take them out clean them e=with rubbing acholhol and you ears everyday until you ear healy then if it does that again then try having silver or gold earrings|`|Y76lmO38aa	Saline solution is good for that (used for contacts) It goes away after not too long though!|`|SNC58uQvaa	You can go to your local drug store or even the dollar store and purchase some antibiotic cream.|`|dfa8c0d357f9ae08e8eda9ba249cfa98aa	Your ear is not INFECTED. When you get your ears pierced for the first time they get gooey. That is your ear hearing itself. Just clean it off, then take they gooey stuff off. After you change your earrings the first time and you keep cleaning them they won't do that as often. Don't worry, it happens to EVERYONE, you are just observant enough to notice it.|`|HyDBQZhdaa	Don't worry!! The exact same thing happened 2 me! It's just the ear healing. Just take it off with ur finger or twist ur earrings a bit! Also, on the 10th, u can take them out but I would keep them in until the end of the month just 2 be safe. I got my ears pierced about the same time a couple years ago & I took mine out the 7th so u can, but it might hurt a little. I got them at the same place. Trust me, nothing 2 worry about!!!|`|kjAQj3i7aa	It's just pus, it happens to everyone! Six weeks is really just a preliminary estimate - it will probably take longer for them to heal, but that's normal! I got 2 more piercings in each lobe at the end of september, and they still occasionally get the gooey stuff!|`|kIblsxJQaa	You can change your ear rings now and I would say that you should use gold or silver.  Keep them in and bathe your ears as much as you can with salt water.|`|AA12186207	You got an infection. Take some penicillin|`|E98jJXzKaa	well, the "gooey stuff" is normal- that means its healing. Just twist your earring and it will crumble off.|`|pv8RjqzOaa	Its probably an infection. Have a barium enema and sleeping pills.|`|P7bNXrlOaa	often with new piercings, there is a yellowish sort of discharge that come from it which means it is healing and trying to get used to the foreign object. It is normal considering you've had the piercing for only 3 days. Your piercing shop should have set up another appointment to see how your piercing is healing. If they haven't, you can call them to take a look at it or you can just make a doctor appt. I've had a lot of piercings so that stuff is normal in the first week or so|`|jt4PVBKkaa	asks your friends or your mommy or doctor!!!!!!!!!|`|g5KuIO76aa	dont worry, just take out the earrings for a few mins and use a qtip to clean with alcohol, then put them back in, they arent going to close up in 5 mins :]|`|U8R2o1P3aa	Ouch.. I had the same thing happen to me when i got my ears pierced. They are most likely infected, sorry babe, but thats the way the cookie crumbles. Take some antibiotic and keep cleaning them, itll be alright|`|p0iHxbdJaa	That is a usual sign just keep cleaning them and if it doesn't clear up ask your the person that pierced your ears.|`|w1pbRmazaa	as nasty as it sounds it's probably puss :p put rubbing alcohol on it. it might sting a little but it works. if it's not puss it could be mold or built up bacteria. rubbing alcohol works for that too
Z2f5Ka6jaa	Go to your dermatologist. Talk to him or her about it.  Accutane is the ONLY real solution for acne. Only available with prescription and find out all the FACTS before people start filling your head with nonsense when you ask about it. Usually reserved for severe to moderate acne.  A prescription topical treatment that works well is called Duac (sp?).  Thats not as harsh on the skin.  If you're a girl, birth control pills help control hormonal acne (the acne around your chin and your mouth).    Everything over the counter including Proactiv is designed for very mild acne. Most acne is has to do with glands producing too much oil and hormones.  The best treatments out there are available through a dermatologist.|`|WXpdkbG8aa	I took birth control since the age of 12 to help with extreme menstrual cramps and it worked to keep my skin super clear as well. Maybe that's something to consider? Good luck!    Edit:: It doesn't get worse before it gets better. That's a false statement. Also, it DOES make cramps much lighter, but mine are completely gone. My period just.. sneaks up on me because I no longer get cramps. And I love it. :) My flow is much lighter and it is two days shorter.. (5 as opposed to 7.) I'm 19 and like I said I've been on it since I was 12. I totally back the pill. Just tell your doctor you would like to consider going on the pill because you have intense cramping and bleeding. Generally, they won't tell you no. There are no severely bad effects from birth control that would make a doctor sway you away from it. Good luck!!|`|dDDAbqqhaa	drink lots of water..use creams, the sun helps clear up spots, avoid getting dry skin..i.e in the cold|`|e9ZCYlT0aa	proactive|`|OIa6za0Baa	try seeing a dermatologist.  they specialize in this stuff and they can give you a perscription acne cleanser|`|cdf12dfb06b5883093f172ece3b52b99aa	What he said or use clean and clear it works for me.

Neutrogena has a new product that works really well. I'd try something strong that Morning Burst- that isn't for people with acne-prone skin.|`|qHUcyrytaa	See a dermatologist or try pro active. Some people get it and nothing helps but try to avoid touching your face with your hands, wash your face if you have been sweating, and wash your hands often too so when you touch your face it doesn't cause breakouts. Also some of the greasy and fatty foods can cause breakouts.|`|Il0sobKDaa	use persa-gel ten...i went in to the doctor to get my alergies checked out but she didn't even say hi and whent straight to "what are you using for your acne?" and then she perscribed persa gel ten and it is like a miracle although i still don't know what to do about my sinuses...oh well...atleast i don't have acne!|`|AA12286176	ok I had the exact same problem only im a teenager so the zits are EVEN WORSE. I went to my dermentologist and they perscibed Diffrin you may have seen some of those annoying commercials for it on TV. It really works im not even kidding my pimples are GONE g.o.n.e gone. If you do try Diffrin keep in mind it will get worse before it gets better because it cleans out your pores pushing all of the dirt and other things to the surface of your skin. hope this helps|`|jsD8WaQbaa	Since drugstore cleansers aren't doing the trick, I recommend going to a dermatologist.

They have prescriptions that will cure your acne, but it does take about 6 weeks. My brother had a serious acne problem and it was cured. But if you don't think it is that serious you just hate it and want it gone than try clean and clear advantage kit, its only $20 and works great!|`|fE1KEqCsaa	Aloe vera soap bar helped my skin a lot.

See a dermatologist And see what they recommend. they could give a prescription that will help|`|P2iqvxw4aa	proactive does work very well but cheaper alternatives would be spectro gel and then after that using something like cetaphil (it's a hypoalergenic moisterizing cream). i would use these twice a day. Wearing make up or perfume could also trigger break-outs as well as may be a sign of an alergy. hopefully this helped a little bit. Good luck :)|`|XgCPkZlWaa	I feel your pain, girl! I've struggled with acne and problem skin for several years. I've tried EVERYTHING and still, nothing gave me the clear skin I was looking for. Until I discovered a product called Acnexus. I love it! I've been using it for about a year and it has stood the test of time! I've only been able to find this product online. If you Google Acnexus, it will take you to the website. It's an all natural product and it costs about $30 for about a month's supply - so much less than what I've paid for products in the past (that did not work!) I really think you'll be happy with this product. I've told my friends and family about it and they've had amazing results with it as well.

AA11490319	First off, as many others have been saying, you've skipped sizes. It would be like losing thirty pounds in three days. It's just not good.   Second, what would be best is to take out the 14g and go back to the 20g until your ears heal back. Then, start slowly gauging your holes bigger. I'd say to leave them as a 20g for about a month, cleaning and turning the earrings at least three times a day. Then, go down a size to an 18g for about a month, still cleaning and turning about three times a day. Repeat this cycle every month, going then down to a 16g, 14g, then lower if you'd like, only one size at a time. That's the best way to gauge your holes, and also the safest.  Also, the earring itself makes a difference. Until your holes are healed, use a small, non-invasive gauge like a plug. Also, make sure it's stainless-steel, or some other really good quality metal. That's the best way to avoid any irritation. Otherwise, it could get infected, or hair could catch and pull on the earring, causing soreness and swelling.     Hope I helped!!|`|zmjAccMFaa	I am going to guess it is because you skipped sizes.  Even though your friends healed fine does not mean that yours will do the same.  Just try not to touch them, and make sure you keep them clean.    Next time do not skip sizes.|`|jxRooBhUaa	it's probably because you slept on it.  and i'm not too big on gauges.. but i heard you're not supposed to skip sizes.     just clean it and do sea salt soaks (1/4 tspoon for 1 cup of warm water)    good luck.|`|6uPZMrqbaa	one if your sleeping on it its goiong to hurt and sometimes your body can reject it so give it time and clean it all the time|`|xzNr2RmIaa	It's called stretchingggggggggggggg.

If it is, downsize and do sea salt soaks.|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	Good luck finding a decent job..  People don't really want the "freak" look in their employ.

Did you dead stretch or use a taper?    You probably stretched too much too quickly and incorrectly. Stretching should never hurt, if it does you did it wrong.    Please read this for more info:  http://www.articlefit.com/Guide-to-Stret...|`|4mDbogFraa	It could be the beginning of an infection.

ALOT. and they can get infected and even BLEED.    so make sure you clean them with either   1. peroxide  or   2. sea salt|`|XogTYdpKaa	thats perfectly normal, everyone that stretches their ear has one that stretches easier than the other. you might even get a little bit of puss that comes out of them, and even then you dont have anything to worry about. unless its really bad    the perks of gauging your ears :)
7uxP3Mvsaa	I used to have the same problem! And in winter it can be even worse as central heating will dry out your skin.  Just Exfoliate your skin with a Face exfoliator (Not a body one as it will be to harsh) and use slow circular motions to put it on. Aftwards wash it off with warm water. Do this about 2-3 times a week anymore often and you will damage your skin.    Also, Don't forget to moisturise. Exfoliating will Make your skin absorb the moisture better aswell! And dont forget to take your makeup off at night!    Hope i helped :) x|`|jBJt46KVaa	I used to have the same problem, so i went to a professional make-up artist and she said my skin was dry.  So you have to use cream (for face, of course) such as daywear plus from estee lauder just about 20-30 minutes before applying foundation. hope i helped=)!!    P.S. when ur skin is dry, it starts to flake and looks, welll>> rele dry, cracked,etc..so u need to use lotion to make it softer, smoother, and not only will u look better..it'll feel great., and so when u apply foundation after about 20 minutes..bcz u wanna wait for the lotion to settle in..the foundation itself is a little arid (dry) and so when ur skin's dry to begin with...it'll only look worse..well, thats my advice and the best of luck to ya=)!!|`|EL45UeUJaa	Make sure after you cleanse your face, put on some lotion all over face, then apply your foundation, if that doesn't work, you may need a new foundation.|`|hdoOcMFNaa	MOISTERIZEEEE|`|st5reHVjaa	put primer or moisturizer on first.|`|dO5D1zhkaa	Maybe not so much foundation?

Then in the morning if my face did not get oily the night before I will apply more moisturizer before applying makeup.  My guess is that your skin has just gotten too dry.  Also, sometimes if my make-up looks really bad I will just wash it off put on some moisturizer and go all natural that day.|`|Cha4lyL9aa	I have combination skin, i've never had this problem.

Powder can dry out your skin and make it look like it is peeling.    You might want to try a little less foundation and smooth it down with a cosmetic wedge sponge. You can even use the wedges on your eye shadow.|`|b2694fb134bd99af7c220f1712c86d2daa	omgoshhhh, oil free acne wash dries out your face compleley .  switch to olay ,  theres the really great moisturizer/cleanser.   :)|`|4j6vNSFkaa	dont use liquid. use powder foundation. or just try a different brand.

I know somebody who spray tanned her face but she had her eyes scrunched shut when she did it and when she was finished she had little white lines all round her eyes. It wasn't a great look.

Did you see, that this little bottle of Vitamins shall cost 24$ ????? You can get the VERY SAME ingredients for 4,99$ at your drug-store (and probably MORE tablets inside)! SO...do "me" a favor and SAVE YOUR $$$$ for such "garbage", which promises you "the world", yet holds ---NOTHING--- !!!    Get you some basis multi.Vit.-Combination and you're served just as well as such OVERPRICED "gimmicks" !! You can believe me, sweetie...such companies are just getting rich with a fancy name and elaborate advertising, but in ESSENCE...all the product contains are plain Vitamins, which you can get for 1/4 of the price at the drug-store !!!

After that apply eye cream and a good Serum, one with vitamin A or C would be best for preventing aging. My fave is MD formulations continuous renewal serum. Serums are a smaller molecule liquid and can be absorbed into the skin much deeper than a cream, so they are very effective. In the morning splash your face with some cold water and go over it with some toner on a cotton ball. It's best for your skin's PH if you only cleanse once a day. After that apply your moisturizer and eye cream again, then your make-up. 2-3 times a week exfoliate your skin either with a Glycol product, like MD formulations peel pads or with something that contains Jojoba beads. Once a week you can do a mask to infuse moisture back into your skin. The best way to prevent wrinkling and fine lines is to keep skin moist. Oily skin won't wrinkle prematurely, but dry skin will.|`|MTjyPMzHaa	give yourself a facial once a week    1.) wash  2.) Toner  3.) face mask ( clay or peel )  4.) moisterisor

If you want to buy some for when you can change the jewelry (10-12 weeks after piercing) get either a nostril screw (looks like a messed up L - no backing) or a labret post (flat back with bead on the top). It's best to wait until after you get pierced so you know what gauge jewelry to buy. Nostrils can be anywhere from 14-18 gauge.

V9W6fMuVaa	You're 11 years old, you don't need to be wearing lipstick, push up bras, so much foundation. First of all foundation is bad for your skin, your chest will come in, so just enjoy life now, and lipstick isn't for an 11 year old's daily life.        No, I don't think it would look pretty.  If I saw someone wearing all that at 11, I would think she was trying way too hard, and I would think she looks stupid.    And plus, if getting attention from high school guys is your main priority and you love that, then I can already tell whats in your future..    I can probably bet you anything that the high school guys are JOKING. "So there!!!!!!!!!"|`|AA11311675	Little 11 year old slut,   whats with the lots of foundation, you'll have more wrinkles than your grandma in a few years  I bet it'll be really funny when you hook up with one of those high school guys and they find out you dont have any boobs|`|5BtMv1r1aa	Red lipstick & Foundation- Gotta go.      Maybe you should wear just a little mineral powder make-up if you're that uncomfortable with your skin but don't try to hide your freckles because that's natural beauty. Foundation will clog up your skin and not let it have air, so in the future you may have acne if you don't slow it down.    As for the "high school" boys and the push up bra, all that's useless.

And don't use gold eyeshadow, use a lighter color that doesn't stand out so much. People will think you are hiding something ugly behind your makeup, which you are not.

WHAT THE HELL?  you are 11. you are not supposed to wear ANY make up at all, unless if its for a celebration( even then minimal), dont worry about you chest looking flat, you are too young for that, you probably havent gotten your period yet. foundation at your age will make your skin age quicker and by the time you are 25 you will look 40!!!AND you are worrying about freckles now, what you gonna do when you get extreme acne? because you will get it if you keep using foundation at your age. perfume is ok, but you should use a delicate one.  and the gold eyeshadow? what is that about, your sister is being sweet to you because to me darling you sound like some trying to dress up as a prostitute. By the time you are 13 everyone will have the wrong idea about you. so i suggest you seriously stop pretending to be what you are not and enjoy childhood while you can.|`|j8LymeCoaa	i'm 11 yrs old, and in my opinion, i guess it's okay to wear some makeup but not much. i don't think push-up bra is such a good idea...enjoy life like the other comments say.    hope this helps|`|XcfNAIvpaa	first of all. STAY AWAY FROM HIGH SCHOOL BOYS. They're really stupid and a waste of time.   don't wear red lipstick thats too much.  don't wear so much foundation either. freckles are really cute.|`|9Iykkiuzaa	In my opinion you wear too much makeup. When people wear too much makeup it makes it so they look like they're over doing everything. I am 13 and me and most of my friends do more of a simple natural style. With too much makeup you cover up and its not good looking. Here is what you should do instead:  Lip Gloss instead of lipstick WHY? because lip gloss is smooth and shiny and doesn't feel uncomfortable or taste bad on your lips, and believe me its way more appealing to guys.  Get some mascara and an eyelash curler. These make your eyes stand out so much more by making your eyelashes darker and curled.   Eyeshadow. For eye shadow apply some white or creamy colored eye shadow on your eyelids and stop a little below your eyebrow. Then, add a color that matches with what you're wearing over the white, but not up to your eyebrow! Then take a makeup brush and brush it across your eyelids to blend it in so it isn't to much.  In my opinion, you don't need foundation, or still use it but much less than you are now.  And keep using the perfume:)   Hope I helped!  P.S If you don't already use some, get some body lotion from bath & body works. There is plenty of variety so find a sent you like and get it, this way your skin is smooth and you smell good:D|`|UmidemI6aa	This isn't a serious question.

When i was 11, i wore lip gloss, and and clear mascara...    and the bra...hun, the womanly parts will develop, and believe me, it's not all fun and games. And now that i'm older, i wish i could go back to being younger like that, because i didn't have to worry about that kind of stuff. So give it time. you'll grow up fast enough.

JkoywYrPaa	You can use the same lashes over again, but they are still limited. I recommend using them for a maximum of about 5-6 times and makeup artists recommend using them for the same length of time. The glue, peels off the eyelashes (gently!). It is a gummy sort of glue so it has no problem peeling off the false eyelash (or your eye for that matter too!) You shouldn't have to use any makeup remover to lift the glue off and if you do, then I would reconsider they type of glue. When I was first interested in false eyelashes I went down to Nordstrom and went to the MAC counter and they helped me. They have all the right tools and advice. Also, if you can't get the hang of it, they will put them on for you. =)|`|OirhZal5aa	not to be mean or anything ,but fake eyelashes creep me out|`|ro3X9fs3aa	i know if u buy them at mac or saphora u can use them 2 times but even 3 if u choose 2 .

XCazFZr9aa	The guy at school was probably too shy to tell the truth. You are a very beautiful girl and anyone that says otherwise is probably jealous. That guy at school is either trying to be mean or he really does like you but is trying way too hard to make sure you can't figure it out.

PhJTPNtyaa	It seems to work on me, I really like it.    There is no smaller bottles, that's the only size I have ever been able to find it in.|`|heCSHJ13aa	I've heard people say it does....but I really don't think so. Maybe it depends on the person, but it doesn't seem like it actually works. Things that can help hair grow are certain vitamins, or even massaging your scalp. whether or not you try the mane n' tail i would say you should try prenatal vitamins, or the hair/nail vitamins from GNC, many women find those to help their hair and nails grow. I tried prenatal vitamins for my hair but I don't think it helped (definitely made my nails grow though) so it might work for you. You can buy a bottle of prenatal vitamins at target or wherever for a few dollars and see?    I'm a dork and watch Keeping up with the Kardashians and one of the sisters got the mane n' tail shampoo and they said it smells just awful...idk if thats true but they said her hair smelled like b.o.....|`|kknSPYxKaa	You can buy the normal size bottles at Sally's Beauty supply, but it is cheaper to just go ahead and get the bigger bottles.  I have been using Mane n' Tail for about 3 weeks now and my hair has already grown an inch.  Amazing stuff!  The smell is great!  It really repaired my split ends, made my hair thicker and guess what!  In three weeks, my hair is 1 inch longer!  I would highly recommend it.  Watch some reviews on youtube, you will see what I mean.     hope i helped :D
tRmtmRQZaa	I think if you cut your hair like this:    http://i145.photobucket.com/albums/r217/...    it will look really cute and since you said you like edgy style,this is great for you!  And everyone will love your new haircut!|`|govCVZySaa	I once gave myself some bad layers, and I suggest that you mix all of the layers together.  Ya know, like you can even them out a little bit.  You could cut parts of the layers in between the levels at a variety of shortness.  I hope you understand what I mean.  Basically, you can try to blend the layers together to make them less noticeable until they grow out.  Good luck!!!|`|NSuilHx1aa	go to dollar cuts you retard!|`|Dkk5HwbEaa	DO you know anyone that knows about hair?  They can turn your bad chunky cut, into a cute chunky cut.

A3s2eg3Aaa	dont do anything crazy with your hair, because you'll regret it when you look back on the pictures.    is your hair straight? if so, maybe just flat iron or blow it out to make it super shiny and healthy looking    if your hair is wavy, do soft curls or blow it out.    do something really simple. because i know a lot of people (like my cousins and what not) that look back on yearbook pictures and go "OMG LOOK AT MY HAIR/MAKEUP/CLOTHES/ETC" etc haha|`|yqKi9l9laa	try these. curls always look beautiful.    mousse hair when wet, dry.    either put in curlers, scrunch or curling iron.    if you want waves, curl it around a high temperature flat iron    or skip the drying and put in sponge curlers which will create spirals but you might need to let your hair settle for a couple hours.      hope this helps! good luck.|`|kWuzKDiraa	just put into a pony tail
vxEDtriRaa	My natural hair color is a medium blonde, and I dye it black. Mine fades from black to dark brown fairly quickly, like within the first 2 weeks. Probably because of the natural blonde? I don't know though. But yes, it will most likely fade to a dark dark brown. Just make sure to use shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair.|`|JT4SHBViaa	if you have brown or dark hair like me, then yeah, the black WILL fade. mine fade back to my natural hair color.|`|NSpSWEWTaa	it depends on the weight and condition of your hair and also how often it is dyed. It is possible it could completely fade out  or it could turn into a soft black.
p5iB0Ogkaa	Unless you can find a dipilatory product that is specifically designed for use on your face (and most are not), do not use one. Especially, if you have sensitive skin. Ive used Nair before and showered or gone swimming within the 24 hour time period without any problems but I did not use it on my face.     I would suggest using a bleach or waxing it off. Many salons offer body waxing including facial waxing for pretty cheap. While it may be painful at first, I would think that it would be a more desireable alternative to breaking out with a rash on your upper lip due to improper usage of a dipilatory cream.|`|OIa6za0Baa	nair hurts reallllllly bad.    um best thing to do is just shave it verrrrry carefully|`|6uPZMrqbaa	nair is not used on the face or vag areas try reading the back of the bottle i had a friend out it on there eyebrows and had to go to the hospital|`|W1UpbMOvaa	Have you tried to bleach the hair instead? I used to use one from boots and after i washed and dried the area it looked ok. trouble with getting rid of the hair in that area is that it grows back thicker!|`|KHcVZliWaa	whatever u do don't take the girls advice of shaving !! that's a complete no no !! u could use a depilatory cream but it's not really good for sensitive skin and continued use of this can make ur upper lip look darker then the rest of your face so will make it noticeable. waxing it off is ur best bet as long as u do it in the evening before u go bed as ur skin will go red at first but usually disappears in the morning . from my experience perspiration / showering the following morning/ day gave me no reactions.     threading is also a good idea as it will slow hair growth and make it finer and gives u no reaction at all because it doesn't involve chemicals :) hope this helps
X061o2Lzaa	Try to put nail polish on them. Then you will pick at the nail polish and not your nails. A lot of my friends also use the fake nails, but not the long ones, so they won't pick at their nails. Once they get out of the habit, they take them off and don't have the problem again!|`|JZnSPgAOaa	I Have the same  problem!  but what i have found, is that if you put some nasty-tasting substance on your nails, such as glue,clear mascara,clearnail polish, or anything else that could be unattractive it helps. i know that's an old way to stop, but if you dont want a nasty taste, you'll stop.|`|g5KuIO76aa	paint your nails really pretty, how could you pick that?|`|gJeJaNPRaa	ack I am the same way.

O6q1ygsAaa	Use that shampoo and conditioner on that Commercial about that girl who was tying her hair to stuff... it was like hecka straight and he just tugged her hair lightly and the knot came out almost immediately, I think it was like Pantene or something. Using a flatiron would also help.  Good Luck

9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Piercing artists have strong hands :)    Actually we just have a better angle and gloves.     It's still a little early to change your jewelry, especially to a ring. I would wait at least another few weeks, longer if you can.    To undo the bead, get a pair of rubber or nitrile gloves, they will help you get a grip on the jewelry.|`|VkFWgXaHaa	your gonna regret it when ur 30 and pregnant with 2 kids and trying to get a job.|`|eS9nPWqBaa	You might 1.  Want to just hold out and wait - it could be really tender and you can end up with an infection.    2.  It might be better off going back to the place you got the piercing to have them change it.  Those things could be tricky - then you end up losing the ball =(.|`|AA11490319	As the woman above me said, it's still a little early to change you're piercing. Five weeks isn't enough time to have the hole heal properly and completely. Give it another two or three weeks, then you can change it safely. If  you can't get the ball off (try twisting both ways, sometimes one direction is easier) get a friend to help. Or, use gloves. Or, if you really can't get it off, go back to where you got the piercing done and ask them to change it.    Hope I helped!!|`|wSYhEREjaa	when you get a piercing the piercer always puts the balls on tight, that's what happens to me. Just go back to ur piercer and ask them to loosen it    ?|`|AaYEgDwWaa	Well cause your piecer scwed the ball on pretty tight and maybe your turinging it the wrong way!! lefty loossy.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	they are very tight and as they are a ball very hard to grip  the piercest will use plyers to unscrew it   so either get some plyers yourself or go to a piercist|`|EoawVhBTaa	except most piercing holes arent permanent.. i got snakebites before and theyve healed up already.. she wont regret it.

GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... jeans by the way!! i wish i could find those but i wish they would be a skirt instead!!|`|8a2XXsnzaa	I agree with the other guy u might have to order them or go to the mall to the nearest american eagle store, call them first see if they have it.|`|bVRgrvDbaa	you should try American Eagle!|`|QNhyowIKaa	American Eagle|`|N9BiqI8gaa	American Eagle or 4 ever 21|`|7dKqdhD8aa	but them from the store or order them from the website     orrrrrr:    Make your own!!!!
PmvKOJcRaa	It depends on how light your hair is now. Ash means neutral / grayish and the base is usually blue/violet. You look at the base color to determine the worst case scenario, if it's really light and already in bad condition you will have a result that looks similar to the base color than the actual dye .|`|c3adf6eebebb43dc6a353232fb6a25d9aa	if you want blonde hair i would definitely go to a professional- although they can mess it up too (i had my hair red for a few years then decided to go back to my natural blonde & the guy turned my hair green!!!!).   most at home blonde hair color doesn't come out looking exactly like the color on the box unless you have light blonde hair to begin with. :/|`|heCSHJ13aa	box dyes with 'ash' in them are iffy because 'ash" can mean blue base, violet base, or green base. Most likely green since green minimizes warm tones like red.     put the dye on a small chunk of hair in your underneath hair to test it out...that's what I usually do.    I've had my hair turn awful tints from using ash box dye but I don't have reddish hair so I can't really say what tint yours will turn out|`|nqkXE1cUaa	I highly doubt it, but it would probably be best to consult a professional, such as your own hairdresser or your stylist.|`|KzVLLPsOaa	The only reson it would ever turn pink is that if your hair was like automatic black or a really dark colour and then you died it blonde.
MAqEfauiaa	a tank top that is a pretty color like navy that has lace on the bottom  once you get that then you would be set and lookin fine in 2009!  haha  = )|`|zINGUVkqaa	a tank top|`|TnnFTLQXaa	Pants normally go with tops. Just in case you didn't know.|`|wbSD0MAyaa	use a spaghetti top  some maybe good colors are white, purple, red?  White is always good.  Also, jeans or some really cute sweatpants like these:  http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/st...  whichever color  it depends|`|xFVjLpdYaa	a gray, black, or white tank|`|avlVHXDCaa	black jeans|`|g5KuIO76aa	white lace cami  or white tee if you feel uncomfortable in a cami|`|4lqwMnhJaa	A printed tank top, cami, or wifebeater would look cute.

AA11490319	Because eggs are perishable, DO NOT keep the mask for more than three or four days, and store the mixture in the fridge. Otherwise, the eggs will start to rot, and that will do absolutely nothing for your blackheads :P    Hope I helped!!|`|gw58sCOAaa	Very Carefully.

I would suggest some kind of concealer cream, but since your a guy...................|`|AA11490319	The quick-trick that I've learned is this: take a wash cloth and soak it into cold, whole milk, then lay the washcloth over your face for a few minutes. The cold will help calm your skin, and the lactic acid in the milk will help neutralize the redness. Also, try Aveeno moisturizers. they work wonders.     Hope I helped!!
qOKFuXfLaa	false lashes (if mascara is not applied on them) can last for about 5-6 uses.

If so they're most likely baby hairs. I used to suffer from these too. Everyday my hair would stick up, it sucked. The only thing you really can do is grow them out. Don't cut them! My friend did and she looked horrible. Try changing around your part to see if it will cover them or help to hide them a bit. Hang in there, I know it sucks :)|`|mpvt9l2yaa	just trim them or you could straighten it each day|`|7r4Z2vRPaa	Gel them down until you trim them.

1da69de5d66630d36a6f1f05ecd687b1aa	Girl use Coconut.  I use it in my daughters hair.  OR you can use vaseline, that's what I use in my hair.  The vaseline will not make your hair stink like gel or mousse.  But make sure if you use either you need to wash you hair real good and leave a little conditioner in your hair.  Then put the vaseline in while your hair is still wet.|`|EL45UeUJaa	When i scrunch my hair I do it when its wet for one.  Then i take the mouse after combing it through and flip my head upside down, then scrunch through like normal and hairspray, then i flip my head up and do the same to the top, repeat this until you achieve the look you want, then hairspray all over. I also use gel just for flyaways at the top.|`|TGV834WJaa	reapply honey bun    or use a straightener    good luck!|`|Gnx24Eqvaa	first spray with a shine serum, a good cheap one is the tresame in a spray bottle. flip your head over and put a small amount of gel in the back. flip it back over and put a combination of the 3 products, gel, then moose, then finish it up with hairspray. and scrunch it. if that's the look your going for.|`|VydFKOFBaa	"jingles" hairspray works very very good. very strong  "Vo5 curls rock" mousse is what i use and my hair is straight and it usually gives it a wavy look.  also use a shampoo and conditioner that is for waves(aussie, biolage)  if you wave it with a straightener and then use Vo5 mousse (like meee :) it should stay for about 8-9 hours|`|X2lesqhRaa	Use hair oil. it really works good. It even moisterizes your hair and contains no chemical. If you cant find any, use baby oil, works just as good.   Only use hair products on wet hair.  Only wash your hair once a week.  Tie up your hair when you sleep.  Let your hair get a little greasy.  get a japaneese perm.  Use frizzease.  Use heat protecten spray or cream before straightening.  Dont blow dry before you straighten.  Die your hair a lighter color, it wont need to be shiny.  Try sunsilks "Waves of envy" shampoo   Try minimal damage organic substances.  Get your hair cut a little shorter, because the longer your hair is the, driar its going to be.  Try herbal essence "none of your frizziness" leave-in cream  Chi, BedHead, and Biosilk are some awesome shampoos, a little expensive though.  Use an egg whites hair mask

lIURL4Qkaa	petroleum jelly! Just plain petroleum jelly, I love the stuff and its better than vaseline!|`|O3i7zJB2aa	carmex/ normal chapstick for lips  aqueous cream for dry skin generally|`|7kopRjIwaa	Man you just ruined my whole life! I have horrible eczema and I use vaseline all over my body daily! Haha that sucks! Seriously people! Answer this question!|`|dO5D1zhkaa	If you are just looking for soft skin, i would go with cetaphil, the cream.  I have really sensitive skin and this is amazing. It makes your skin really healthy and soft, but has no smell, so i just put smellier lotion on over, or spray some body spray.  As for the chapped lips, i use regular chap-stick, or more recently, Nivea kiss of moisture. It works really good.  Good luck, and hope this  helps! :)
u6HndVxaaa	why do you care? how about you go look for a hot chick yourself and take notes or something...creeper|`|SuD5CjGraa	u'r crazy and u have no right to say those on the internet. cuz there are children online also. and i don't mean i'm a child. i'm just saying becuz my sister also have a yahoo answers and she's only 10.
4z2L9PTLaa	If your hair is naturally straight,  with no wave or curl, you could be  out of luck with curling   your hair, unless you got a perm.  However, you could try mouse or gel,  by scrunching it. Thats how I do mine,  but my hair is naturally curly.  I hope I helped,  [:|`|SaAmcaaSaa	lol. my friend has the same problem. Go to walmart *best place in the world** and go to the hair aisle. Get the hair curlers that are pink and fluffy kinda like this:  http://www.istockphoto.com/file_thumbvie...    and buy em (: Hope i helped (:    oh sorry i forgot and sleep with them in your hair PUT HAIRSPRAY before bed and when you wake up :)|`|boipPoVJaa	My friend uses a curling Iron.    I have naturally curly hair it is the worst. My friends get theres to stay a while you just got to keep the iron in long enough.|`|ind4ZbEcaa	iidk but this might work for u my hair is straight so it doesnt hold anything...ok this is what is do is grab a piece of hair then twist is it and clip it up make sure the hair was just washed and soaking wet then i dont put anything in it and leave it in my hair and go to sleep and then in the mornin i just dress and do my hair last.. i take out the clips and the i spray it with a good hair spray.... like got 2b or pantene..... and then i just scrunch it and respray if needed and yeah i did that today and it was wonderful!!!!!!!!! trust try this and if u dont work just use a straighteneer when i use a curler it goes limp and use a good straightener like chi.....http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv-JSQbcu... and after u curl it... just put hair spray.....|`|jAOVX4QQaa	Well, My hair is straight and I get it to stay, even when it tries to come undone.   Clean hair - mix leave in conditioner and a  conditioning gloss (Like Garnier fructis) to give you hair some texture so it holds the shape better. Use about a nickel sized dollop of each, rub hands together, and apply throughout hair after you shower and comb hair..Clean hair will not hold at all, but if you're like me, I have to wash my hair everyday, so I put something in it to hold better.    One day since washed - this will hold better and you won't need so much styling goo, style as usual. finish with hairspray.    The trick? Use bobby pins to pin the curl to your head, do your whole head, pinning each curl up as you go, when the whole side is done, spray lightly with hairspray, wait a minute, then take it down. It works wonders.    Don't spray your hair while it's still warm, not only do you NOT spray while it's hot, but it weighs your hair down before it's had tome to cool. Hope it helped.|`|hYohgOcAaa	I have wavy hair and i curl and straightenet it all the time so i know how to get it really nice ad curly FOR A WHOLE DAY  You will need (any type of curlers, pins, comb, gel and hairspray)  Here are the steps;  1. before going to bed take a shower AND(WASH YOUR HAIR LIKE YOU ALWAYS DO)  2.after shower put your hair in a towel and wait for 20 minutes so the hair is not to damp and is not too wet) in the time between you can take care of your teeth, face, nails or anything you want.  3. after 20 min comb ur hair so you have NO tangles  4. take about 3 quarters or less of gel in your palm and put it all over your hair make sure you get everywhere  5. comb ur hair so it isnt tangled   6.put in curlers and secure them with a pin on each end (the curlers could be sponge, metal (its old school but it works well without damage and it lasts) or any other kind just make sure that they are the size you want your curl to be.  7. go to sleep (its best to sleep on your stomach or secure your head really tight in a pillow) or if you want you can put them in at any time throughout the day for like 5 to 6 hours or even faster take a blow dry and just dry it when you have them on  8. when you wake up in the morning just take them off and style your hair however you want (hairspray will do the trick)
UYnZtJ2daa	Why not go call the place you're planning on going to? None of us can tell you how much it will cost, all places charge differently. At my place it's $25 for the piercing and the jewelry starts at $35 because they use high quality jewelry. So, around $60. It just depends.|`|Ggg65VBXaa	Depends on the metal u buy. I got the basic sergical steel barbel it was around $50 i think then I had to pay to have them pierce it. I think it came out to around $70, but that was years ago. Your best bet is to just call and ask your tattoo/piercing place.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	NO WAY!!! $70 is way to much      It should be NO MORE than $50 including jewelry      ** anyone paying more than that like $60 or $70 are getting ripped off NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO!      A place that I get my tattoo's at charges $50 including the highest quality jewelry! for all piercings except the industrial which is $70 because it's 2 piercings.     Another charges $40 including jewelery|`|MVdbt4Esaa	$50 in all  go to a tattoo shop|`|CbGkQklXaa	It all depends where you go. Some places charge 20 others 50. Remember good work is not cheap and cheap is not good work.|`|rWsUjaiVaa	i live in manhattan and got mine done in greenwich village. it cost me a total of $20 (including the jewelry) and it didnt get infected or anything.
zEES49hhaa	The Epilator, OUCH!! I used something similar a long time ago but it was not called the Epilator then (It was worse than waxing, because it's slower..but hopefully they have improved it) Who knows it might have an electric shock that numbs the pore ~  Let me know how it works, if it does the trick I'd be willing to go through the pain again.|`|w0ZI33E4aa	its called a razor lol|`|O3i7zJB2aa	epilator|`|zdMlBTATaa	epilator? I use Braun silk Epil|`|DrT0RXtUaa	Ummmmm..it might be Laser or is it electrology  ha not really sureeee :)|`|lZxet9t1aa	is it the thing from sephora? the permanant hair remover? thats called no!no!
bwLv2USTaa	yes  because gel & hairspray both contain a lot of alcohol which damages your hair.|`|eHrvVMZjaa	if you use a little bit, no    but since you u a lot, your hair will probably fall out by the time your 40...all of it|`|Cc8ICAXnaa	Yes, a lot of gel will make your hair greasy and a lot of hairspray will make the surface of your hair dry.
VUfT35UQaa	Nope, but lots of layers trap heat better than one thick layer, and if you get hot later, you can de-layer.    eg: on top of underwear  a vest top,  a tank top,  a thicker gym tank top,  a thin T-shirt,  school shirt,  school jumper,  school blazer,  coat.    and 2 pairs of tights  with socks inside and outside (so the tights dont get soaked with snow water)  with leg warmers and shorts under a school skirt (in case it's windy!)    Thermal leggings are a brilliant idea, but can't be used with skirts, however thermal vests can be worn.|`|avlVHXDCaa	we dont have them  but to tell the truth sometime i would  but never in the summer where it hot  but in winter i would most the time|`|uoMahrymaa	ye|`|MfBDN2mxaa	No because that would have made me a tramp.|`|HKNbWjtOaa	sometimes i used too wear my pyjamas over the top and other times just by themselves!|`|1rQTmEZMaa	always and shorts in summer   we have long skirts   it makes us feel comfortable   and if we do rowing or dancing at school we can just take off our skirts :)|`|RyMNLddQaa	no! do you. do you have special pyjamas just for the job?|`|8sAbT96Maa	I have not worn pajamas, but I have worn long underwear. It helped a lot. I got them from Lands End.   Here is the website:http://www.landsend.com/ix/index.html?st...  Hope I helped!  Or, you could just go to www.landsend.com and search "thermaskins"|`|h3t4Uewvaa	yeah it was lush!  unfortunately for me though we wear skirts at school so i had to take my pj bottoms off, so i put my tights on the radiator & that made my legs lovely and warm :D  microwaving underwear is also really nice :D|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Haha yes i have...feel like a tramp but iv done it lol|`|FTBiFqlXaa	No i dont have a uniform. :D. If i felt like wearing pjs one day i would just wear them. I usually (never) dont feel like wearing just pjs though.|`|zdMlBTATaa	yeeesss wen i was like 8 xD and once wen i was 5 i went in slippers and my mum didnt realise|`|aIZfiU6Kaa	This is a most amazing question for me because I once did in 1947, this was one of the coldest winters on record, I was five years old.    My father was a painter and decorator and I noticed one day that he wore his pyjama bottoms under his trousers when he went to work and I thought it was a great idea.    By an amazing and horrifying coincidence I chose a day when the school nurse visited, a row of us boys had to form a queue and one by one we had to stop in front of a desk where the nurse and the headmaster were sitting and drop our trousers.    I don't know what was most embarrassing, showing my credentials to a woman or her sarcastic comment to the headmaster about how lazy I was not getting out of my pyjamas.    As God is my judge that's true.|`|dzaX1o7Daa	no but I'm tempted if I have to go to school tomorrow.  (:  x|`|FzKkLF0raa	umm...no .|`|65c2814e235f6d7bf1be306702a35139aa	If it stops u from being late for school then it's a good thing i suppose!...

Nobody that age really wears briefs...  But if that's what you're comfortable in then I guess it's okay.|`|PAvYZJK2aa	that is okay to do|`|xGWZ5DfIaa	i agreee with the first answer but you need to get into new things so after about one wk on briefs go to boxer briefs and then if ur ok go to boxers.but boxer briefs are nice 2 :-)|`|B3Cd58ehaa	If you feel comfortable with briefs then so be it, Iv been in highschool for 2 years now and no one realy cares what underwear you wear.

It's perfectly fine if you choose to wear briefs.  There shouldn't be any problem with people making fun of you.  I wore briefs all throughout high school (i'm in my final year now) and I have yet to get made fun of.

Sometimes, it looks kind of creepy when people with really dark eyes wear extremely colored contacts. But if you go for a subtle blue or green or even like a honey-ish color, I think it would look really pretty and stand out a lot against your skin :)|`|5R0MdDENaa	never seen it before...but thated be pretty =)|`|gexth6UEaa	here are a few :  http://www.africancolours.net/media/1092...  http://koxcradm.ko.ohost.de/goodstuff/Mi...    i think it looks pretty!|`|aae33ca98ed4acc2878892601466ebc5aa	On a darker skin color honey colored contacts would look really nice!

You'll look like a lizard because the pupils stay one color and one pupil looks one direction and the other looks another direction. They are horrible and you'll start feeling self conscious when you talk to people and look them in the eye. Completely bad idea. I used to wear them. OH and then when you take them out you won't want people to look at you without them because it'll feel phony.
dqSqlArRaa	The cool off button is to set in the style. Just like when you curl your hair, you shouldn't touch the curls until they are fully cool or else they will fall out, the cool off button is so that you can cool the hair faster so that it will "lock" in the style when blowdrying. Hope this helps.|`|UaIR316oaa	it your blow dry is on warm or hot, and its getting to hot for your head press the cool Button for as long as you hold it down the dry will stay cool...and if you mean the Button that keeps it cold that is for sensitive heads and little kids.|`|Xa1QdsMtaa	if you blast your hair with the cool air, it seals in your cuticles therefore making your hair shiny and its supposed to make your hair stay perfect for as long as possiple|`|heCSHJ13aa	hot air is bad for your hair...well anything hot is bad (curlers, straighteners) so some people dry it with cool air.

You could do wavy curly, stright anything.  ANd for those, short choppy layers is how to be.  Side sweep bangs.  DOn't color it.  Your hair color is beautiful|`|2rmNwCiVaa	Well girls in my school dye the underneath part of their hair   they usually color it blonde or a light color but sometimes they dye it purple or pink.  So its just like a half up half down hairstyle,   but with less hair down.  And they dye the bottom part. its pretty cool if you want to die your hair.  With your hair color, a light brown would look nice
kknSPYxKaa	Your hair grows about a half an inch or an inch each month, depending on if your hair grows fast or slow.  If you are a slow grower, your hair could take a year, or if your hair grows fast, you could be looking at around 6 months.  You might want to try some new shampoos and conditioners though.  I use Mane N' Tail shampoo and Conditioner.  You can buy it at Sally's Beauty Supply or CVS.  The bottles are huge.  32 ounces to be exact, which is like 3 times as much as a regular bottle of Pantene.  It costs around $6 a bottle.  The shampoo really does make your hair grow faster, if that is what you are looking for!   Hope I helped :)|`|Lgue20G2aa	well ur hair grows about 1/2 inch a month so it will take u about a year....|`|vuPJipLeaa	a year.|`|heCSHJ13aa	Geez, I've heard it only grows 1/4 an inch to 1/2 an inch each month.  Definitely take the advice to try prenatal vitamins, it doesn't work for everyone but its worked for a lot of women since it has sooo many vitamins all in one capsule.|`|8qeDEWWJaa	About a year. Take prenatal vitamins it will help your hair grow faster!|`|HRvPoQzKaa	12 months. But it depends.    Hair grows 1/2 a month.

To prevent cartilage damage, wait @ least another month or 2 before you change the jewelry.|`|DEnMQW5Uaa	I wouldnt change it.     If it still hurt when you sleep on it, dont change it.      once it doesnt hurt like if you touch it, flick it, you can change it.|`|lrzv2a5naa	6-8 weeks i think so yeah you should be fine|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	If it still hurts, no.

It usually takes 6-12 months to heal, but hey, everybody's body is different.|`|nPfxPidTaa	"Hello, I love you" lol      and yes!! 2 months is enough|`|A9DUUVlvaa	you might want to wait just just since you did it yourself thus it would be safer to wait the full 3 months and because hoops can get caught in things|`|Lrr1gSFcaa	No. I did this too soon and got an abscess on mine. Took mine a year to heal.
9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Well, it won`t paralyze your face. People split their tongues in half, face still works. Cutting a persons tongue out used to be a punishment, face still worked. There are no nerves in the tongue that will paralyze your face.    As for the slutty thing, it's the person who is slutty, not the piercing. Getting a tongue piercing will not turn you into a ****.    It's certainly not unique. It's one of the most popular piercings. (sorry, but I hate misconceptions about piercings)    It can cause tooth damage and gun erosion. Even if it's done perfectly. Please consider that.     If you want a piercing that is more unique (or at least less popular) and won't damage your teeth, go for a vertical labret. It might be easier to convince your mom.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Well, it won`t paralyze your face. People split their tongues in half, face still works.

You may see that other people like having them, but they are the worst piercing to get. The daily amount of infection and bacteria you take in is impressive, and that all attracts to your tongue.

I thought I was going to get away with it. I didn't talk much so they woudln't notice. But they found out. I got an infection. I didn't get punished, the infection was enough punishement.    and honey it is not unique. What's so unique about it when EVERYONE HAS IT?    Get a tattoo instead.|`|0fe649625e33ad80a6e3582e8d51f5d2aa	umm....im sorry but i agree with your mom... even though im around your age... u should get it atleast when your 18...|`|IA5SuFkdaa	your too young just wait|`|5cBmCVw3aa	wow u want to get it and your 14? I did mine when I was 16 and my dad went with me.|`|Gd2zv86haa	Don't.    She's right. It's unattractive and trashy.|`|aCd49st4aa	wait longer then ask|`|XuKj2TLwaa	Umm i wouldn't get a tongue piercing if your only 14!!! and even if ur above that age!!! I WOULDNT DO IT!!!!!!   But if u really want to...... Just tell her the good sides to it|`|ioBUzPVraa	dont get it unless you're a whore, listen to your mother she has a point. duh.  its not unique, it shows youre 14 and stupid|`|5d69096a97f9015e41817b901338a7cbaa	It is in no way shape or form unique.  There are millions of girls with them, so if you're getting it to be unique try something else.  Otherwise, try getting her really drunk maybe.   You can't talk reason with parents.  They don't have to answer to logic.|`|qoDw7i5qaa	14 is too young...But i'd say do all your chores and EVERYTHING your mom says, get good grades...then probably a maybe.    Even after that, i wouldn't be suprised if she says no.  But worth a shot.|`|4j7qchZyaa	okay i say 14 is a bit too young buts its not body  so what u do is................DONT tell her   just get it done but make sure u have somebody's ma or some cort of adult to make sure u going to be okay she'll deal with it eventually|`|hf7YRrRZaa	LET ME THINK NOOOOOOO|`|0le6RYndaa	"It's for whores, it's slutty, it can paralyze your face, get it when your 25"    Your mom is right, except about the "get it when you're 25."    They are disgusting.  I've known people who have had them at one point in their life and hated them over time.  If you ever decide to take it out, (which I bet you will) then you will have a nasty looking hole.|`|2D7oE7ARaa	You did the right thing by doing the research and knowing the pros / cons of the tongue piercing. It may paralyse your tongue which is a scary thought. My suggestion is wait until you are older and speak to your mum again. Or get to an age, when you can make decision without your parents' permission. Also, if you do wait longer, just have a bit more patience, you may change your mind.|`|5BsbPF7jaa	I believe if you want it, you should get.  I personalty don't really like them, but im not going to   judge someone who has one.  HOWEVERR....  Some states have laws against under age oral piercings even if you have a parent to sign.   And 14 is still pretty young i would wait a couple years and see if you really want it.   also tongue piercings are sometimes associated with sexual acts and   as a 14 year old you really dont want that label.|`|w0ZI33E4aa	lol tongue piercings are not unique. everyone and there mothers have them. but your 14 your body is not done growing. i would wait at least til your 16 or 17. because if my daughter was barley 14 and wanting her tongue pierced id look at her like shes crazy|`|lAIWFB8faa	Sorry, your mom is correct. Most of the rest of these people on here are correct. I think any piercing is a big turn off. Not that it matters to you. This culture these days with everyone wanting to stand out and be different, make a statement, give in to peer pressure etc. It's just ridiculous. You have your whole life ahead of you don't screw it up and do stupid things that a lot of people in your future will not want to tolerate. I cannot offer advice to get her to say yes because she is absolutely right in her thinking.|`|v5BKRI6Taa	i was once 14, and could've DIED when my dad flat out said no when i wanted my tounge piericed, i begged, i pleaded... all to no avail, i turned 18 and did it anyways....   now, i'm a mother of two girls.  looking back at my way of thinking at 14.... no, there is absoulutly NO GOOD REASON for a 14 year old having a toung ring. period.  that goes for me at that age too.|`|AAZTO16baa	why would u want once there a total turn off and its ugly and it is for whores mainly|`|dGYSLZqjaa	i want one also but i hate needles...i dont think its slutty or anything.And the whole paralysis thing-just tell her it's a risk you're willing to take.|`|2dC1lSLeaa	You don't care that it could paralyze you and scream that you put out? I agree with your mother. She may seem like she doesn't know what she's talking about, but she really does.|`|b8WLu1kbaa	Don't get one at all but if you really want it give your mother the puppy dog face or ask your dad|`|9TE9lOKBaa	Your mother's word is final. You're only fourteen.|`|p12HPmnVaa	Tell hur you'll do it whether she likes it or not, or just get it pierced and don't tell her or, beggg like ****** crazzzzzzzzzzzzzzyyyyyyyyyyy
6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Take a warm/hot washcloth a put in on the blemish for a few minutes, then apply hydrogen peroxide with a cotton swab ....leave it there for about 20-25 seconds. Repeat 2x a day. The hot cloth will bring the pus/dead skin cells to the surface and the peroxide will keep it sanitized and dry it up quickly. DO NOT SQUEEZE IT, though, if a blemish is large it will leave a scar if squeezed....You will see an improvement in 2 days. You see 'it' more than other people see 'it', so don't be so self conscious....|`|fybaEVq8aa	use proactive,i have pimples too when i used the proactive they're gone|`|Gd2zv86haa	put a band aid on it.    you "cut yourself shaving" if anyone asks

V81YH3n9aa	spray your hair as your curling it with hairspray and again all over once your done. if you're planning on sleeping on it, then you should try sleeping on a silk/satin pillowcase. it will still be gone down from the body it had the night before, but this should help! :).  also, try separating the curls in the morning if they're extremely flat, that may also help ...|`|1PGmB4JNaa	well ofcourse they're gonna be flat when you wake up      LOL just redo it|`|Wj5wwIz6aa	well i don't have any websites. Anyway my sister and mom have curled their hair alot of times and stuff. try doing after u wake up and then make fix it up a little then next thing u know you'll be beautiful!!|`|SUeAdvqzaa	well im not sure but i think satin pillowcases supposedly help keep a hairstyle shape.

Turned out she was a skincare expert who's been all over the world to different skincare product conventions. She said never use Clinique, its the devil of the skincare world, its like paint stripper. If its blackheads and spots youre trying to get rid of, she reccommends using grapeseed oil and salt. Make the mix up yourself. You can find grapeseed oil at the cooking oil section in the supermarket. Salt is cylindrical so it will roll neatly into your pores and back out again, pulling oil and dirt out with it. Whereas if you buy a face scrub, the grains are not cylindrical and will scratch your face and clog your pores, doing you more damage than you started off with.|`|853cc6887209cde2bce97ac152f218d0aa	well from the picture it doest look that bad but i guess if u wanna make super clear i guess u can use murad =)|`|ziphn7Xmaa	Drink lots of water, use a face wash that doesn't strip your skin.

Then start using deep conditioning treatments and stay away from straighteners/curlers.  Lots of conditioners help make hair feel less damaged....but really, nothing is going to make the split become one strand again.....|`|kknSPYxKaa	Herbal Essences is bound to have something that mends split ends.  I think it is called Long term relationship.  Just get the creme, it should repair your split ends really fast.  -$3 a bottle.|`|zdMlBTATaa	scissors..|`|5FiL3yl4aa	GETTING IT CUT!  literally, just get it cut, and you wont have split ends anymore.|`|V81YH3n9aa	get yourself a good trim! ask your hairdresser to cut only up to where your split ends start. and use a shampoo with lots of moisture in it. Leave in conditioners are also a help.|`|ovJPm6hDaa	a hair cut.|`|vJwVRrEJaa	Look - i've always asked that very same question too but here's the answer -  if you already have split ends and want to get rid of them, YOU HAVE TO CUT IT!!!  I know, there's like billions of products out there which "claim" to say that they can "treat" your split ends and some even say that they can "MEND YOUR SPLIT ENDS TOGETHER and make everything better again - IT'S ALL A BIG FAT LIE!!! those products just make your hair look like it has no more split ends but really you actually still have them! And while you keep using the product and chose to NOT cut your hair, your hair gets more split ends...     This is what you do if you want to get rid of your split ends, although i know the feeling of it not wanting to be done, but still -    1. Cut any dry and slit ends. If you really have too much and don't want to end up cutting out all your hair, then cut most of it.  2.CARE FOR YOUR HAIR!! After you've trimmed your hair, use natural products which you know can protect your hair and doesn't have nasty chemicals in them.     (DO NOT USE PANTENE. Believe me, I was there when my hair was a disaster and Pantene just makes your hair look good TEMPORARILY! Also, Pantene makes your hair shiny buy coating your hair, so if you already have bad and damaged hair, don't use pantene. Although some people do and have beautiful hair but that's because they NATURALLY have really good hair so i guess their hair can cope with it.)     I hope i helped - im going though the same situation as you and plus my hairs damaged and EXTREMELY DRY , even got the point where straightening won't work!   D=

What you would do is cut most of the hair off with scissors until it's about half an inch long, then go at it with the shaver. This is the kind of shaver I am talking about: http://www.lakewoodconferences.com/direc...    Electric shavers don't cut you at all and only leave a rash the very first time you shave.|`|HiuZs5G5aa	hey, false comment, im a guy and i really don't care if its hairy or not down there. you are sterotyping!|`|dXDroPtfaa	Geesh!  I'm thirteen as well..And I shave down thur and get none of that stuff! Except for the itchness(And that isn't a lot either..)

If they do care so much then you have a whole different issue on your hands.|`|XSwl1kjUaa	Look I have the same problem. Your skin gets irritated. Let the hair grow out and wax it. Trust me it looks a lot better and it doesn't itch. Hope this helps! :)|`|wfT5ol2gaa	Okay, I'm not exactly sure what to do, but maybe try creams that get rid of hairs, without shaving. Maybe you can find one made for 'down there' or one that doesn't irritate your skin. and I also wanted to respond to someone saying your not supposed to shave there because you can. its just not as comfortable as when you get waxed. (and don't wax, your still 13, I'm 13 to and I shave down there usually only in the spring and summer, just for when I wear shorts and swimsuits.)

Gauging will be a permanent thing.  If you are talking earlobes, that will be very ugly when you grow up and decide to take it out.  Get a few piercings.  The tongue is trashy though, don't do that.  Maybe get a stud in your nose.  Get your Marilyn pierced.  And maybe a few extra in your ears.|`|HTkGvWYAaa	snake/angel bites would look nice  an eyebrow would look good  maybe nose (if it wasn't so common)  cartaliges  hip peircings look good on some people    gages are cool, but if you go too big you can't go back, so choose wisely  and if you have multiple ear peircings it might not work for YOU  and i have gages in my first ear peircings but i have double peircings that i want to stay normal, so i'm only gaging the first|`|iRqhkfJtaa	y r u asking total randoms?!?!??!  thats wierd of u  but if YOU want to get a piercing or gauges or watever  YOU sould want to do it not other ppl|`|5SATUntkaa	wow you look like this chick i know hey name is brandey :) and yea definatily|`|MfCxMOPCaa	Yup.

I would redecorate my room :) Not really fancy, but add a throw rug, comfortable chair, cool posters, more pillows. Have fun :)|`|NU2TfQCXaa	I'd say spend at least 200 maximum. But I'm a guy, and clothes are nice, I'm just not a big spender on that and saving is something I do because I'm going to college next year.    I'm 17 btw.|`|9FhAZC30aa	donate to sick kids hostpital or save|`|K1Dw3QfCaa	save it all,u will want to buy a car soon and will need the money

Dxc87EsSaa	i have really frizzy hair too and my mom lets me straighten it but in the morning i just don't have time! i usually put it in braids or you could sleep with braids and wake up with crimped non-frizzy hair! there's also bows and headbands that distract people from your frizz.(:|`|N0hlErEyaa	bed head and moose r great|`|I0zwugQUaa	wear a hat|`|NDvFr6gfaa	use olive oil spray|`|VSqk5zpnaa	I used frizz-ease before or whatever it is called. It isn't a shower thing.  You use it whenever and it will make your hair have zero frizz. I don't know how to explain it. It is sorta like a lotion type deal you put in your hair and when it dries or whatever it is not frizzy anymore (this is me trying to remember something 4 years back).|`|5FiL3yl4aa	when you get out of the shower you could try just combing thro it a ton,  and like standing in front of a fan!  haha then it would be like a hair dryer,  and you would be keeping it strait by combing it :)    it mite work, i just thought of it haha|`|RAOxqaD4aa	There is this stuff called Frize-eze and it doesn't damage your hair moisturizes it.|`|yE4dpN2Caa	try putting your hair in a high pony tail when its wet, you may think it'll make your hair boofy but when you brush it again when its dry it goes flat.|`|FkQhzG1Waa	i swear by biosilk cure serum. wash yur hair and out this on it after. actually, yr hair doesnt have to be wet. but this stuff eliminates friiz and makes you hair staright and shiny.
rE9J1DqTaa	Umm she probably dyed it black.    Also permanent hair dye doesn't wash out all it does is fade but the color always stay in.|`|AA12148328	The only way to get dyed black hair back to blond is either through a expert in hair stripping , or let it grow out .|`|YKydXFJ5aa	Maybe she died her hair black...?    =p|`|3UDw1yXbaa	If it is a temporary color, it will wash off in one thorough shower. However, permanent hair dyes do not wash out. They will fade because the conditioners in the dye are washed out. It is easy to go from blonde to black but not from black to blonde.
XWk7TDYTaa	it doesnt make your hair grow faster, but its supposed to stop it from breaking so you can grow it longer.
GQwpTBNyaa	Sorry, I dont think so.  Would make your face look fat.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	No it would not...round faces look rounder with fringes...especially ones that go straight across.|`|5R0MdDENaa	nah round faces dont usually work with fringes....but a picture would help.    try a bob with side bangs...super cute!|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	You've already got a fringe - & your current hairstyle looks great anyway.

zEES49hhaa	It's a hugh commitment to have healthy skin if your not born with it.  Water is the best thing you can do for your skin.  Lot's of fruits and veggies help alot too!  How soon are you meeting him?  You'd be surprised how much water can change for the good, not just acne.  As far as chemical treatments, I never had any that helped me when I was a teen, and I even went to a dermatologist.  I do know that when I started working out I sweated out toxins and that helped clear up my skin.  If you have the time these will be permanent fixes, and you'll feel great.  (Can I just say....you'll know when it's love and sometimes excitement over something new seems like love but when the newness wears off your left with nothing but regret.  Be careful, your one of a kind and special and just make sure you get what you deserve, and that's the best!!)      Addition:  So sorry if I sound like a mom but please make sure someone knows where you're going when you do meet him......not saying he's a weirdo but (I'm sure you would be able to tell) there are alot of weirdo's out there|`|qXWYvhU4aa	first off, if you've never met him then i wouldn't be so sure you love him but i understand wanting to look pretty for him. sooo...    1) drink lots of water, it definitely helps  2) eat antioxidant rich foods such as salmon and blueberries  3) try to go without make-up, or use a skin clearing make-up like neutrogena, for a while  4) make sure you wash, tone, and moisturize your face every morning and night!|`|XKrn4m9Caa	Drink ALOT. (water)  Use the neautrigina wave it works wonders|`|O3i7zJB2aa	benzoyl peroxide, you can get it at the chemist|`|V9W6fMuVaa	Drink lots of water. LOTS.  Continue to wash your face.  Take care of your skin according to what kind of skin you have (oily, normal, dry etc.)  Use a good treatment for pimples, Benzaclin is really good!    Well, good luck!|`|Wr23i5psaa	Ahhh! That's sweet. It happened to me before :)    I would say go to your dermatologist or family doctor. He'll give you the cream perfect for your skin    Clean And Clear is pretty good. Check the other products for acne.    Procativ maybe ca work    Do masks, scrubs  and facials twice a month : it helps a lot    drink water and healthy (FRUITS)    wash your face and don't touch it !!|`|IurrHmvMaa	omg ive asked like, the same Q and know excatly what u mean........ id say to use neutrogina.........i cant give much info ive got same prob- sry and good luck!!|`|xR68iQA9aa	i would say drink alooooooot of water!  yeah if you dont get enough sleep that would probably effect it too.    if its still bad when you go to meet him wear makeup!
YGvKisOoaa	my one friend doesnt have a tattoo but she puts a little design on her hand that is so cute and she does it like every day so its like a temp tattoo. but its a heart, but it doesnt connect at the bottom. instead, one of the lines towards the bottom extends more and does like a half swirl. super hard to explain, but if you understand, its extremely cute.|`|8THz1sp9aa	I'm really not liking the 'pieces of heart' idea. Really think about all you've been through. Sit down and talk about memories.     You could all get matching flowers, skeleton keys, bows, full hearts, skulls, stars, etc(whatever comes to mind when you think about eachother)    good luck :)

bVRgrvDbaa	You're a girl! Girl rappers don't wear the huge shirts and all the bling!   If you can get someone to braid your hair in cornrows OR flat iron it to be Completely straight! Wear a hat! {A popular baseball team near you. example, NY yankees, dodgers, a's - all popular!} You can wrap a bandanna on your head & put the hat over  it too!

Put that on sideways. Then put a white tee shirt on(can be tight or baggy, doesn't matter much) on, under a zippered top of a matching sweatsuit. Make sure that the sweatsuit is WAY over-sized. Put on the bottom part of the suit(make sure that the pants hang below your ankles), and get some sneakers on. Get some huge sunglasses, and if your ears are peirced, put one small gold hoop in. get lots of gold chain necklaces, and put them on, and get a larger one with a large gold pendant, like a dollar sign, or one that says something, like 'Soulja boii' or something. Get lots of gold rings, make sure that they are big and chunkey. Have a couple that have big fake jewels/gems. Sharpie on some tattoos, make sure that they are kinda realsitic, and have them say stuff like 'StreetFreak' or something like that. Hope I helped!|`|Ttp7dVFqaa	Wear lots of bling, trousers around your ankles, extremely big t-shirt, timberland shoes.|`|Ijej3WJsaa	draw black teardrops on the outside of your eyes.|`|4bkMsT9caa	wow this is for school??

vCSQnIlRaa	If they started bleeding and what not put your 2's back in and let them heal. Then slowly stretch them with teflon tape wrapped around your plug. You could also try to find a 1 gauge plugs so you don't have to jump as far. They are hard to find but worth it. Try www.bodyartforms.com. When I went from 2 to 0 and then 0 to 00 I slipped 14 gauge cbrs next to my plug and slowly stretched it that way. However I don't know if that's a good idea so I don't recommend it.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Tapers aren't the best thing to use once you get to the larger sizes. The jump form 2 to 0 is 2mm. You can either try getting 1 gauge tapers and jewelry or tape up to a 0.     For instructions on taping:  http://www.articlefit.com/Guide-to-Stret...|`|AA11490319	Honestly, I'd leave the 2's in for a while longer. What the pain is showing you is that your holes haven't properly healed. The larger the hole the longer it takes to heal.  I'd leave the 2's in for at least another month before trying to go down to a 0. If it still hurts when you go down in a month, go to your doctor to see if the hole isn't healing properly.    --Veronika|`|W70UXr42aa	i say suck it up and bear the pain|`|xzNr2RmIaa	I say just suck it up if you want them at 0's.    2 to 0 is a bigger jump than most, so it will hurt a little bit.    PS for future reference it's called stretching. Gauge is the size of the jewelry.
wSYhEREjaa	don't play with it or anything. go to the person who pierced it for you and they can get it out for you    ?|`|UYnZtJ2daa	If you're not sure, go to a piercer. They can show you the proper way of doing it and can do it without irritating as much as you probably will.    Usually, you just have to pull those straight out. I don't wear the bones because I don't want to force some ball down my nose piercing.|`|94jDTdDzaa	I don't have mine pierced, u should have never gotten yours pirced!|`|5BsbPF7jaa	i have the screw in kind so i dont really know for sure, but i couldnt get mine out once and i just went to the tattoo place i got it done at and they took it out and change the jewerly for me. For me it was free because i went to where i got it done, so i would just go back to where you got it done. Most likly the backing is just stuck and they have tools to unscrew it that works alot better than fingers ha     good luck :)|`|5yOAjvyQaa	ihave my nose pierced! its a straight  one, i just pulled it straight out.  Didnt hurt or anything!
67fc0c30125bac036c6df15bb7b4e5c3aa	Yes of course you can. If you have very sensitive burning type skin (like me) put some sunscreen on, tan for a little while then when you think that you feeel youself starting to burn put on more sunscreen.|`|nHi1mioBaa	Definitely,you still tan if you use SPF 100  the purpose of sunscreen is just for protect you skin from damaging|`|R3AN5WO0aa	yea, sunscreen is so you dont get sunburned.  but if you want a good tan, buy tanning sunscreen lotion.|`|M8H5UYvVaa	yea even if you use sun screen you still get a tan it just protects your skin from UV rays.|`|KkOzs2Czaa	i do!!!!!!!!!!!|`|wPczZoBOaa	yes! you want to put sunscreen on or else you'll burn. if you put SPF 15-30 on, you'll be fine.
xM5bwK50aa	It's really pretty, but I don't think of it as a prom dress- it looks more like something you'd wear out on a normal date. But if that's your style, go with it :)|`|CVQa88Ujaa	The dress is cute from the top when you go to the bottom I don't like that polyester really shows.  I don't like the choice of shoes with this dress.  I think the dress would be great if it wasn't a polyester dress.  there are a lot of dresses made of polyester but if you zoom in at the bottom and you will see the polyester flowing I don't like that|`|IPRVpsnAaa	I like it, but if I were u id go with a shorter dress.|`|xsiPET9Zaa	GORGEOUS!|`|SHdrYV0Naa	honestly the dress is plain but cute, hello girl this is your prom go for something flirty and sexy something like wow, those shoes are killer but are you really gonna be able to dance and be on your feet in them?|`|IIxAnsWdaa	cute|`|5nG2Bk2Eaa	okay they are both gorgeous and go really well together very well. i would have chose black to|`|R1oSxvyXaa	i absolutely LOVE the shoes!|`|p1ZMXLpBaa	Its very pretty, definitely chic.  I might go with a shorter dress, but i don't know, or a longer one if you can pull it off.    The shoes are gorgeous i absolutely adore Christian Louboutin!!   But over all I think its very classy and beautiful!|`|koX1ymC0aa	my OPINION is it's a little casual for prom
EXdiDbTTaa	The second one fersure,  the first one is really ugly. no offense (:|`|4o158mQUaa	Both very pretty!!!!!!!!!!!! But the first one looks nice and put together more. But the next girl is also very good looking just not as confident looking. So I gotta say first one. Also if there is a fight between these two on looks. Just tell em that they both are pretty and get uglier while arguing.|`|9qb8DCHbaa	second one.|`|AA10366051	number 2 only cuz of her hair and eyes,  but they are both pretty :]|`|P94EeBvmaa	2nd|`|iRCBiPgZaa	2nd|`|JZnSPgAOaa	I Think They are both really pretty, but  i prefer the first one because her boobs arent flopped out like the second one. that's slutty.|`|mMvEEZ3oaa	first, the second one just looks like a slut|`|JWZEuuhTaa	I think the second on is way cute. Ithink you should chose her.|`|z2EPIm1Qaa	firrst, (:|`|umJrcAyLaa	both but the guy is ugly|`|nrqWwQBXaa	the first one?|`|jSd6qCwHaa	they are both pretty in different ways|`|lf17zI7Aaa	They are both REALLY beautiful in there own ways.  1 is clearly older tho but still SOO pretty and  2 looks like the girl from the secret life|`|0fe649625e33ad80a6e3582e8d51f5d2aa	ummm idk why ur asking this...but i think the top ones prettier...|`|n0Ny0ZwEaa	the second one is pretty but she needs to pull up her shirt.|`|20h3lauTaa	BOTh|`|2wOmBTPyaa	They are both very pretty and actually look a bit similar.

WKc89tOpaa	Well, your makeup doesn't always have to match your outfit, as somebody else said. It's supposed to make your facial features pop, especially eyes. It all depends on your eye color for your eye makeup. I don't really like black with brown at all, but if it compliments your eyes then go for it (;|`|Z1X4Nr91aa	absolutely not.  don't worry about it.  brown eyeliner and shadow wont be a clash.  brown and black look almost the same on eyes(:  don't worry and have fun. you'll look great!|`|w0ZI33E4aa	brown and black are not flattering colors together. if you wanna look good try a color that will bring out your eyes. like blue/purple for brown eyes etc.|`|0zFETWiFaa	no itll look good|`|SOTftMa1aa	no|`|MTjyPMzHaa	It all sounds a bit DARK. maybe you should try some sparkly blue eye shadow or teal eyliner to be a bit brighter. Also try some cute colorfull shoes!|`|V9W6fMuVaa	No, it's look fine! Makeup is NOT supposed to match your outfits! It's supposed to be colors that compliment your skin.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	no  try black all the way  if you don't wanna look goth then wear sparkly silver eye shadow, black eyeliner, black mascara.     =P|`|FTBiFqlXaa	nope :D
FTBiFqlXaa	Coach is so in now that it pays to be original. I dont really like the ones that say the brand.
2oN7WrVKaa	Well, while you kiss just press your lips against eachothers gently.  Almost like brushing them across.  He will probably start moving his lips first, you just have to move with him.  It sounds really confusing right now, but once it happens you will just know.  It all clicks.    TIPS:  If you want to make the kiss more intamite run your hands through his hair, or down his back, or around his neck.  Lick, gently bite, or suck on his lower lip.    Heres a video that might help, its a little goofy:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej0p72KvA...    Good luck!!  :))  Youll love it.|`|00nXfQBHaa	just start slow. dont shove your tounge in his mouth. don't just circle your tounge around. play with his. write letters with your tounge or draw picture shapes in his mouth with it. suck on his tounge lightly. lightly suck on his upper lip while he on your bottom or nibble his lip.       those are just a few of my lil tequniques haha|`|nqkXE1cUaa	While a single kiss shared with someone you like or love can be intense or electrifying, an extended kissing session (referred to in America as "making out", "getting off" in Britain, and "meeting" in Ireland) can take a little more variety, coordination, and finesse.

As time progresses, you can introduce more passionate kisses, but they can only be sustained for so long. Always return to a slow, comfortable pace.     2.        Make eye contact and smile. Pause every once in a while to meet your eyes with theirs and connect emotionally. This is also a good time to gently lean your forehead against theirs and put your hand on their face. Doing so reinforces an affectionate bond and can last anywhere from a few seconds to an hour. If your partner seems put off, they may be nervous, unsure of how to handle emotional intimacy or they may not feel emotionally attached. If you're with someone you love, this is the best time to tell them that you love them.     3. Kiss the face and neck. Vary the kissing routine by moving away from their lips occasionally. Again, move slowly. If you move too quickly, they might not know what you're doing and next thing you know, your lips are crashing into their nose. Kiss the corner of their mouth gently, and make your away along their jawline. You can move up to their temple and forehead, or down to their neck. If you want to kiss their ear, don't peck - the kissing noise is quite loud and can leave a ringing in their ear!     4. Hug. Right after a forehead or neck kiss is a great time to wrap your arms around your partner and give them a warm, affectionate embrace. Like eye contact, hugging is an emotionally bonding act. Give both of your lips a rest, take a deep breath and gently caress their back with the palm of your hand.     5. Stroke their hair. If your partner is a guy, run your fingers through his hair along the scalp from front to back, all the way down to their neck. If your partner is a lady, you can run your fingers down her hair, letting the strands run through your fingers. Keep in mind, however, that some hairstyles are not conducive to this. If they have their hair tied up or it's quite curly, your fingers might get trapped. Instead, run the tips of your fingers slowly along the top and around their ear, as if you're tucking a stray strand behind their ear.     6.        Talk. A little verbal communication will keep things interesting. It's not a good time to start a deep conversation. Just a small phrase in a soft voice will work (especially when accompanied by eye contact and a reassuring smile):                ? "Are you comfortable?"          ? "This is amazing."          ? "Wow."     7. Lighten things up. This isn't the movies, where it's all perfect and passionate. You're both human and there will be awkward moments here and there, no matter how many instructions you read. If anything awkward does happen, be quick to laugh with your partner and mend it with a hug or a kiss. A little bit of tickling here and there can also lighten the mood and make your time together not only intimate but also fun.      [edit] Video               [edit] Tips        * While making out, it is better to "break" rather than "hold" the kiss. Kiss, then back out only a little bit, barely breaking the kiss. Then, move forward again. You should not simply hold a kiss with your partner and do what is called "tongue wrestling."      * Close your eyes while kissing. It's fine to peek, but for most people it's creepy to make out with someone who has their eyes wide open the whole time.      * Before you make out, make sure you know how far you're willing to let things go. If things get a little too heavy, be prepared to tell your partner that you're not ready to take it all the way. If you're ready and willing but are not sure if your partner is, read How to Know When Someone is Not Ready to Have Sex and respect their wishes.      [edit] Warnings        * Don't be too forceful (kissing hard) unless you know they like it.      * If you just plan to make out, never make out after heavy alcohol consumption as it could lead into something else, th|`|yo0qnedIaa	Well its kind of something you just have to learn.  But uhmm well let them make the first move, that way you know they want to kiss you.  Don't slober all over their face.  KEEP YOUR EYES SHUT !

3UDw1yXbaa	You can redo the colors yourself. I always recommend Manic Panic. But there is also JaZZing by Clairol, Beyond the Zone and N Rage all at Sally Beauty Supply. Hot Topic has Raw and Color Fiend. Raw works really well but it costs way more than it's worth. Manic Panic works just as well but is only $8.49.    As for colors, I'd say Manic Panic's Pillarbox Red and Ultra Violet.    When you apply the dyes, add heat to make the color stay longer.|`|y3H4YG7Haa	Manic Panic hair dye first of all!  Second, try a cool red and a nifty blue together!|`|81ocas2Baa	purple and light pink (and no, it wont look too girly if you're worried about that)  or purple and blue would look good too.
ovJPm6hDaa	maybe try clipping it up in like a poof?  or could you cut it and make striaght bangs?    or can u possibly briad it like this::     http://img2.timeinc.net/instyle/images/2...    the same thing happened to my friend last year! she just had to come up with different ways to wear them till she could get to a hair dresser!     good luck!!!|`|CfUuDEW9aa	why did you let her cut it?|`|I2gat01haa	use a razor to make it look more natural and make it more even.|`|CdBxhRcVaa	whats a fringe?  anyways, a ponytail with bobbypins to hold up loose pieces|`|FqIcBTo2aa	Wear a hat or a headband.|`|QUR4uBnZaa	How is ur fringe at the moment, to the side, straight? The best thing to do is to hold the fringe and very lightly cut into it up ways just a few here and there, this will encourage layers and will thin it out a bit.|`|rTwsdq6kaa	is fringe a britsh word for hair? anyways just wear like one of those winter caps some girls wear. if it looks good on them it will prob look good on you|`|HEXiXALyaa	Cut it straight across, then next time you go to a hairstylist have them cut it for you.

Take your fringe, and pull it atop your head. Clip it there and make it look as good as possible.|`|dZxjXHA2aa	Your hair will eventually grow out, but if you cant stand how it looks, try pulling it back into a clip like a messy, wild bun. Dont think this upsweep has to put an end to your style, dress up your tail with barrettes, scarves, flowers, and fancy hair ties.  Sometimes a little bit of illusion is all you need for masking some horrible hair. Invest in some scarves, fancy barrettes and bobby pin, head bands, bandannas, and hats to spice up and camouflage your hair style. Wish you never went for those bangs? Pull them back and pretend it never happened with a trendy scarf or headband. Sometimes a few strategically placed bobby pins can make all the difference. Spend some time in the mirror, trying out various accessories and styles until you get something youre happy with.
zrKxEvVGaa	It's OK just don't shave it because it will grow back longer and thicker.  girls with hairy are sexy too, it's natural for some woman to be hairy.|`|M2EKtjIbaa	Well, I wouldn't exactly recommend trimming the hair on your arm...but I think it would be fine. Did you know you can wax your arm hair? One time my mom was waxing me and she accidentally got some on my arm, and when she pulled it off it didn't hurt...but that would probably be really noticeable. IDK.|`|W50zzBQoaa	haha nothing. it'll be shorter. dont do it too much itll look stubby and weird... and dont SHAVE them cause itll grow back thicker and longer|`|kknSPYxKaa	Nothing.|`|wsQwfKn4aa	I've tried this, and I wouldn't recommend it. It makes it stick up and it looks more noticeable. When it's longer, it lays flat.    Unless the color is dark (in which case, bleach it) just leave the hair.|`|4TzQ9dlfaa	it will be shorter.  but dot shave, thats BE-YOND nasteyyyy.,haha  but its all gooood
JkoywYrPaa	*Risks*  They take longer to heal so you need to keep that in mind (6 months the very least.)  They require a needle to piece so if you are scared of needles...uh....  Because of the needle, you want to make sure of choosing a reputable place with licenses and clean facilities  They require a strict cleaning regimen or else infection is a good possibility  They are more prone to 'catching' on things like hairbrushes or whatnot... also if you have a job that requires answering the phone or you just talk on the phone... that can hurt for a little while.  You cannot sleep on that side on your ear for at least a couple weeks.    *Location of the piercing*  Basically, anything goes! I placed mine slightly below where my glasses hits the top of my ear. A really nice looking place is right at the top of the ear where it curves... whether you do a ring or a small stud, they both look nested inside your ear and don't look funny.  But, all in all, they are sooo worth it. I absolutely loved my first one and decided to get the other one done! =)|`|4j6vNSFkaa	i did mine and all you really have to do is find the thinnest part of your ear, numb it with some ice, sterilize the needle (i put the needle over a flame for mine) and then just pierce it. i wouldn't suggest piercing it with an earring.  it doesn't really hurt that bad.|`|0zFETWiFaa	look up pictures of people's pierced ears to see the location, and base it of off that. and the risks, few its just on ur ear
vCSQnIlRaa	Don't be afraid. Out of 27 piercings it was my least painful. The healing is worse then the piercing. I believe the healings the worst part with every piercing and tattoo I have ever gotten though. The tongue does suck more then others. It's a slight bit harder to eat while it's sore and swollen. Slow and steady does it though. I have never personally swallowed any part of the barbell. I had a friend that was eating and believed she swallowed her ball. Trust me though you can't choke on a ball. It's to small. I'm not going to say it isn't possible to swallow the whole barbell but it's highly unlikely.(If you think about it, because of the size of the barbell it would just pass through, or at the worst get wedged in your throat but guess what it's to thin to fully close your air ways) When you have it you become quite aware of it at all times without actually thinking about it. 95% of the time I can feel even when the ball is loose.  You won't have a problem with your teeth as long as you change your barbell after the initial healing to something with acrylic balls. Unless you have really crappy teeth acrylic balls will break before your teeth. If I could only have one piercing it would be my tongue. I love it.|`|QaVLgTQCaa	Why would you chock on it? lol >_> and what about your teeth?? I've heard it could change ur voice|`|Lg3SNqW2aa	If you want to get it done, go for it. Don't be scared, they numb your tongue before they pierce it and they also check to make sure there are no veins running through the bit of your tongue they're goine to pierce :) They're professionals and know what they're doing and I don't think you'd have to worry about choking on it :p    I guess everyones different but I dont think it hurt at all, it's just a tad annoying and sore for a few days after. With the right after care and rinsing twice daily with salt water you'd be fine in no time ;)|`|AA10997370	well....it does hurt, and it will bleed, but as long as it's done properly, you dont need to worry about choking on it, or anything like that|`|5CI2YHoqaa	I had my tongue pierced for 3 years and it was so sensitive i had to take it out in the end . After i had a cup of tea or anything on it, i would feel it for hours and hours after, it was never right until i took it out. Well that's my experience other's might be different but i wouldn't recommend it.|`|NKE6Apz9aa	i really want my tongue pierced too but i know someone that got it and ended up cracking all her teeth. but i still think you should do it.|`|HHyny0JSaa	It really doesn't hurt to get it done. Your tongue will swell for a couple of days and you'll have trouble eating and speaking. But thats about it. There's really no choking hazard for them unless you get a barbel with a detachable hoop. You do have to be careful though. I've had mine done for 12 years now and I still bite it from time to time. Yes you can chip your teeth on them.|`|MVdbt4Esaa	alot of my friends have their tongue pierced  they said it didn't hurt nearly as much as everyone expects it to  you won't choke or swallow it thats very rare  the tattoo place or whoever does it is very careful when they tighten the balls and make sure its safe and tight.. as should you if u ever change it   it doesnt get in the way of talking or eating.. only for the first few days of having it    don't be afraid of it ! :)|`|4r0Cyih5aa	Baby thats the worst thing you can do to your body. It hurts like hell and if they hit the wrong spot you can be paralyzed. Just ask my sister Sally D.|`|HUrYSp4oaa	my daughter has had hers for 3 yrs she is terrified of the dentist but was ok with this and she said it didnt hurt. it hasnt given her any problem.|`|3iJ6CmAjaa	It is not a problem as long as you are careful not to get it infected.|`|BQwybwqHaa	well i'm not gonna lie but it does hurt when getting it pierced. not for long, but it does.  you can cause damage to your teeth by accidentally biting on the metal ball or knocking it against your teeth.  you may swallow a few of the balls but i have never heard of anyone choking on it!  they are not very hygienic as you cant clean your tongue properly  and eventually they do grow out. also your tongue will be sore and swollen for a couple of weeks after and will never heal 100% as your tongue is moist, and also you will always accidentally catch it!|`|1ndsZlU6aa	I got mine done when i was 16. It wasn't sore when they pierced it, cos they numbed my tongue first. When the feeling came back into my tongue, it began to get more and more sore. My tongue swelled up, but not any more than it should have. It was painful to eat, manageable but i had to eat really slowly. I also got a minor infection. But most of the pain and swelling had gone after 3 days, and soon after that i was able to put the smaller bar in (they pierce your tongue with quite a long bar to allow room for swelling).  I managed to chip 2 of my teeth accidentally by chomping down on one of the balls on the bar, but i wasnt too bothered cos it was 2 of my back teeth and it cant be seen! I dont think its likely that you'd chip any of your front ones.  You won't choke, as long as you keep the balls secure on the bar you'll  be fine. However they do loosen when youre eating, and i also swallowed about 5 metal balls!  HOWEVER, overall id say its worth it. I ended up taking it out cos i had a bf that didnt like it.... can still get a bar through it tho!   Go for it, its not too bad, the few days of pain and some minor chips on your teeth is definitely worth it! lol|`|QZ1gWFGBaa	Allot of places now will numb your tongue so you don't have to worry about any pain until a few hours afterwards until the numbness wears off   they place a larger bar in your tongue until the swelling goes down then you can change it to a shorter one   so don't worry about it falling out it wont   you will need to check that the screw ball is tight every two or three days   tongue piercings don't take that long to heal usually about 2 months   use ice and ice cream/lollies to sooth the pain   you will be fine  you need to be 16 without an adult   it should cost you about 20-25 pounds|`|ll46NOpjaa	I had my tongue done a few years ago. I expected it to be extremely painful but it was actually very quick and just felt like pressure in the middle of my tongue. The next few days were rough because because the bottom side of my tongue was VERY sore. It took a few weeks for all of the soreness to go away.    As soon as you get it pierced suck on ice chips and take an anti-inflamitory (ibuprophen) if you can. I had to take tylenol which still helped with the pain. Make sure to rinse with Listerine after eating, drinking or smoking. From personal experience the Citrus burns the least.     Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|vr185cTSaa	LOL ITS HARD TO CHOKE ON A TONGUE RING LOL I HAD MINE FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW AND I HAVENT DONE ANYTHING BUT BIT IT TIME TO TIME IT DOESNT HURT WHEN U GET IT DONE U MAY FOR GET U HAVE IT AFTER U GET USE TO IT BUT AS LONG AS U KEEP IT TIGHT U WONT SWALLOW IT OR CHOKE ON IT|`|U7vLYGodaa	it doesnt hurt, your tongue is two seperate muscles wrapped in skin, the piercing goes jusst through the skin. .|`|uBSRpJkaaa	It Gives You Bad Breath :)    x
3yacqUltaa	Most likely fake. This is very cheap for tiffany, and it is just a charm, so even if it was real this would be useless without a bracelet.   Good luck!|`|nIflCWKOaa	To that stupid little girl, NOT everything on ebay is fake. They have many quality items in fact, a lot of places are so cheap because they have warehouses.. in other countries, and if you think how cheap it is not to manufacture something in america.. :/ It's fine, if its way cheaper buy it, if it's like 50 more to go to the store.. just go to the store :/|`|4769b530e02572d6a0c84645a6d398cfaa	FAKE. Don't buy stuff like that from ebay, it could be a scam. Its better to just go to a jewelry store like Friedmans, Kay, or Jareds...they have the real deal. Or you could always go to Tiffany's official site. It may cost more but it would probably make her feel she wasnt worth it if you bought her a fake and she found out...|`|0AQF8pnKaa	its real. but contact the seller, and DO NOT place a bid until they contact you back.  btw, that's just a charm. does she have a bracelet to go along with it? you might want to do a little more research|`|QNhyowIKaa	it could be real, considering that its a charm, which you might wanna make sure she has something to put that on..|`|WqI4rCrhaa	I dont think it's real buddy.  Browse Tiffany's online website and see if they even sell this charm.  There's no reason anyone will privately sell a real piece of tiffany's jewelry for less than Tiffany's  will unless it's used, and you dont want to buy your gf used jewelry.  :-)   The reason girls love Tiffany's is b/c Tiffany's jewelry carries a certain status.  It's an experience and a right of passage for a man to walk into that gallery and buy something for a girl he cares about.
SNCeFeY1aa	something fun and shimmery, ruffles or rips are cool, bright colors, heels, dark jeans and a bright top if you want the attention drawn to your top or a black top and like, bright colored, (blue or pink or yellow look good with black) jeans, thick dangly bracelets, gold or silver hoops  good luck:}|`|0rfrYC4Xaa	Cock tail dress :DD|`|Ijej3WJsaa	a cute tunic and jeans.  if you live somewhere warm (like me) you could wear a tunic dress and tights.    i wouldn't wear anything too expensive because last year someone spilled beer on my white ed hardy shirt and i couldn't get it out. that's when i stopped buying expensive clothes lol. but try forever 21.

Good Luck though. :)|`|lGclixPuaa	yes you have a very moel face and u look skinny|`|FhOL7UUZaa	You are extremely cute, which can't hurt your chances.  But when it comes to high fashion and runway modeling...5'6'' is almost always considered too short. I can think of only one model who made it at that height (Kate Moss).  So you may want to aim for a more commercial type modeling, still photo modeling, or even acting.  Also it takes a lot more than being very skinny to make it as a model. Do you have grace, originality, take directions and criticism well, endurance, determination, style, etc? Some of these things can be learned, but others may not.  If it still sounds appealing, go for it.  Also, you should never have to pay a lot out of pocket to join a modeling agency or to be considered for it. If they ask for money upfront, you are being scammed.
wzCqpgnJaa	None of the above  It's a proved fact that shaving does not cause hair to grow in thicker It's a myth....  Your hair grows from the inside out so shaving doesn't affect the growth or texture  Same for hair cutting they recommend you to trim your hair once a month. But it wont make your hair grow faster it just helps take the damaged hair off so it breaks less    Go to Reuters.com  they will also tell you the same thing|`|1eiPSIydaa	It's a myth that hair grows back thicker after shaving.  It may FEEL thicker but that's because the hairs have been blunted so they become coarser to the touch.  When hair begins to regrow it will also feel coarse because it is shorter.    Think about it:  What could the action of shaving do to the hair follicles to make them suddenly start producing thicker hair?  Shaving takes place on top of the skin whilst the follicles are within the skin.  How would the follicle 'know' the hair has been shaved further up the shaft?|`|AeOMHUwFaa	The face, upper lip and jawline.

109a6dfea08822c4b720a3d5f9fa6b9eaa	Neil,    Palmer's Cocoa Butter is one of my favorites. Get the original formula in the white, brown and orange container. You can find it at pharmacies, discount department stores and supermarkets. Apply it on SLIGHTLY DAMP skin just after you come out of the shower. This will seal in the moisture that your skin loses every time it becomes wet.    Mineral oil is also inexpensive and effective. It should be applied to WET skin upon exiting the shower or bath. This method is less time consuming than lotion application because you don't even have to dry before applying it and you really can just slop it on. Baby oil is mineral oil with scent. They offer the traditional baby powder scent, lavender and a few others. The lavender is subtle. You do not need to buy Johnson brand. Target has one of equal quality. Walgreen's is fine but the container does not dispense as well...    In general, make sure that you are not using water that is too hot and that you are not using harsh soaps. One needs very little soap. Dove is excellent. I like the original formula but there are plenty to choose from. Tone is also moisturizing. I am currently trying out Olay bar soap and it meets my rigid standards. Ivory soap is a real joke. The adds always say how "pure" it is but they fail to mention that they refer to pure detergent. Stay away from it. I also find Lever 2000 very drying despite their appealing advertising.    Don't forget to exfoliate regularly to get rid of dead, dry skin. two of the most effective methods are: 1. An oil/salt scrub (Exercise caution; this makes for extremely slippery showers.). The best place to purchase it is in the toiletry section of T.J. Max,  Marshalls, or the like. They have expensive brands which are discounted to about $5. I prefer the store-bought to ones I've made at home.  When you use this method of exfoliation you do not need lotion or oil afterward.                                              2. A depilitory, Nair and Veet work well, which ever costs less per ounce. Obviously, you would have to enjoy feeling smooth because you will be losing all of your body hair along with the dry skin cells...It's up to you.    Be sure you are getting enough healthy oils in your diet. If you don't know much about that, research it on the Internet.     In the winter, you should be running a humidifier in your house or better yet a vaporizer (They are no longer as intense as they used to be, nor  dangerous.) Vicks makes an excellent 1 1/2 gallon model priced at about $18. I use several in my house. Anyone who tells you that you should not be using a vaporizer unless you are sick, is clueless. Not using it is what makes you sick. If you have any doubts about a healthy level of humidity in your household air, you can purchase a small, very inexpensive gauge. I believe they are under $5 at Walmart or the like.     I think I have covered the main points in managing dry skin. I hope you find them helpful.

t92F9YwTaa	Yeah, I think that its fine for young teens/preteens to start wearing make-up and plucking/waxing a little bit.     Okay, go to a really nice place to get her eyebrows waxed for a foundation, so that she can just start plucking after that. NEVER shave your eyebrows, it will just make them grow back faster and thicker.    How to tell the 'rents: Don't. Just show. If her birthday is coming up, then give her make-up for her birthday.   Or, buy a set of make-up, one that has the whole thing, eyeliner, nail polish, tweezers, etc., and say that one of your friends gave it to you, but you didn't really like the colors or whatever, and give it to your cousin.    Or just start up the conversation in front of her parents and drop REALLY BIG hints like 'I wonder when my mom and dad will let me wear eyeliner.' *blink blink* 'I don't know dearest cousin of mine.' *blink blink* Just talk makeup, and as often as possible. Sooner or later they will notice, and bring it up sometime. That's how I got a new bike! ^_^|`|vr185cTSaa	TWELVE IS A LIL YOUNG TO WHERE MAKE UP BUT SHE SHOULD START SHAVING IF THATS WAT SHE WANTS TO DO I STARTED ABOUT THAT AGE AND GETTING HER EYEBROWS SHAPED IS NOT A BIG DEAL IS SHE GET THEM ARCHED SHE MAY LOOK A LIL OLDER THO|`|Qvk8JpPBaa	no offence but it sounds like ur cuz seriously needs a makover if she's getting whiskers at 12 then she needs to pluck those babies along with her eyebrows + wear a little bit of makeup my advice skip eyeliner u end up poking yourself in the eye. just use some volumizing mascara|`|qrHUoUVQaa	She should because if she doesn't feel comfortable in herself then she might have later problems I think all of that is fine, just ask the girl if she wants to do all that then tell the parents that she likes wearing or doing that and she would look super cute.|`|4KOuL7mZaa	ok she definitely would not want to SHAVE her eyebrows becuz the hair will grow faster and bulkier. and if she wants 2 wear eyeliner than she needs to wear the whole thing. the foundation the blush the eyeshadow and the mascara. now breaking it to her mom will be easier becuz if her mom wants her to change than maybe she can teach her daughter to put on makeup. but breaking it to her dad will be harder. have her parents talk it over. im sure everything will be just fine.|`|ANf5FzTXaa	She's still young. In our country the young girls don't allow to wear a make-up. The reason is they have a young skin and that can cause an allergy especially on their face.|`|9qb8DCHbaa	no one should EVER shave their eyebrows. period.|`|pXnoIJHzaa	first off ~ braking it to the parents is always hard, she should just come out and say that she wants to start wearing makeup. tell them that she feels like she looks like a boy and isnt comfortable with her self image. second ~ if she has a unibrow she should wax it, not shave, or tweeze. she could also get them threaded. third ~ i dont know what whiskers are, if its a mustache bleach it. fourth ~ to start where a light coat of black eyeliner or a darker coat of brown. dont go all color crazy if your just starting to wear. fifth ~ to get the parents to let her, you might want to start with just a thin coat of powder to cover the acne, and natural eyeshadows|`|SNCeFeY1aa	all of thats fine for a twelve year old.

cR8UZdi1aa	Well, for starters if you keep asking people what they think like this question, they're going to tell you.|`|tlj3c50Haa	Well... there are two main types of people looking down on them.    There are the people who look down on anyone who doesn't wear what is 'in' or the same as them, which I'm guessing is simply to make themselves feel better by putting others down. As long as they keep putting other peoples' style down, they can feel like they're better than everyone else.    Then there are those that look down on mainly 'emo' and 'scene' people, because of the fact that they claim to be dressing 'unique', 'dark' and 'weird', when in reality they are just following a trend. I know I get irritated by scene kids, because they ALL say that they are unique, when they all look and act exactly the same.   Also a lot of 'goth' people get it from real goths or people who know about goth, because they aren't actually goth. (You know... Hot Topic and mainstream metal music... those types) This tends to annoy people who are into the subculture.    Basically I don't care what someone looks/dresses like, as long as they don't think they're something they aren't. :)|`|aQQ1VoIoaa	Because most people are uncomfortable around other people who don't look/dress/talk like themselves. I'm not really any, uh, "type" I guess, just me, but some of my best friends have been the goth emo type. People are dumb sometimes :)|`|pv8RjqzOaa	People always look down on stupid people. Because they are stupid, see? You are correct when you say they dont mind there own business but why should they? Bashing emos is funny and improves the basher's life at the emo's expense.    There are more important things in life than harassing stupid kids however. I have never done it but i dont think its a big deal.|`|X9PIqr05aa	idk  they like the typical "clean cut" guys and "girly girls" that all look the same   im definatly different but it annoys me when people automatilcaly judge me   i hate posers that try to be "scene" or "emo" or hxc  get a life and stop trying to copy others  srlsy no one likes pathetic idiots that cant express themselves and have to copy other people

URBAN DECAY:  http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...|`|ae3ecab489f9cbbdd2b51fb0492f64d3aa	I use to be a model and we learned all kinds of different make-up techniques but the one thing that I learned about everyday make-up was this; You want to apply make-up to enhance your best features but you don't want to make your best features look cheap. So for everyday make-up if you want to look really good and polished and not cheap you do the following. You want to use a foundation that matches your skin tone and powder. You want a blush that gives you a little color on your cheeks but you don't want to look like a clown. You want to use subtle eye shadow and liner and always brush the eye-shadow up towards the brow. If you have blue eyes then a  combination of gray and blue would look nice. You would use a soft medium gray and take a pointed brush and get some gray shadow on it and line your eyes both top and bottom and a line that is in the crease of your eye lid. then you want to get a little very soft blue on your brush and lightly apply in the middle of the eye lid. Then take a flat brush and sweep upwards from the top lash all the way up to the brow. Use an eye lash curler to curl the lashes and then apply black mascara lightly, let it dry and the apply a second coat. Don't let the lashes slump together. If they do clump then wipe your mascara brush off with a tissue and keep brushing your lashes until the clumps are gone and your lashes look feathery. Apply a light color lipstick and then use a lip linner the exact same color as the lipstick. When you are finished applying all your make-up, look in the mirror and put your hands over your eyes for a few seconds and then take them away and the first thing on your face that pops out at you in the mirror means you have to much in that area so you need to take a little off. The idea of wearing make-up is to enhance your beauty and look like your not wearing make-up. That is for everyday make-up. Models never use everyday make-up when they are working but they do when they are at the mall shopping or going to church or to school. You can get a little more dramatic with night make-up if you are going to a formal dance or a formal dinner. Because I was a model I am always aware of women who know how to apply their make-up and those that don't. A majority of women don't know how to apply make-up. Most of them either don't wear any or wear way to much. A young lady already has the most beautiful skin she is ever going to have so to cover to much of that natural beauty would be a shame. I hope this has been some help to you. Just remember to little is far better than to much.|`|Ll0182h9aa	a good eyeshadow to use is called the wanky moose. it has a funny name but it really works well sweetcheeks.|`|eocYAzeraa	i use Herbal Essence for my hair. they have all different kinds for your hair types.   as for the eyes, i have blue eyes, so depending or the color of blue.  gray blue-purple  dark blue-brown  blue-green  but all look good on blue eyes.  i like using L'Oreal's HIP. i have the rebel shade.|`|aHyhzIGUaa	I also have blue eyes and so what works for me the best is a white sparkley eyeshadow i wear and I think it looks really nice.

AA10167659	when it comes to how to loose weight there's one thing that works for me, eat only veggies and fish for a while and move ( walk, run, dance), if you stay inside too much and don't get fresh air in your lungs and brain it  isn't good either for your mental health nor physical health. If you want your hair to grow faster then the pharmacy can give you vita mines for that, but you need to eat the vitamins for at least three months before you start to see result.

govCVZySaa	I'd suggest that you either cut it shoulder length in front and a shorter and closer cut in back, and then you can either get some colored highlights or bangs.

9Mr14w6Qaa	I think some of the Avon products are good.For a person on a budget they are ideal.They have a lot of varieties of lipsticks eye shadows and blush .A lot of their fragrances are quite subtle.|`|b0cGIroYaa	I don't buy any Avon products anymore...i use to buy all my cosmetics from catalog.my friend sells so much Avon stuff.|`|jXePpBoEaa	I love Avon products. Many of them rival big name-branded cosmetic companies and also the price is reasonable. Many of the products gives off about the same results or better than a pricier one.  ps- I'm thinking of trying out the Avon Advanced Retexturizing Peel cus of the good results I've heard!|`|AA11705009	You get what you pay for...cheap products full of chemicals. I'm allergic to the eye shadows and eye liners...so I don't like it.|`|az0Z0DIjaa	I've never used Avon cosmetics, just some Mary Kay and brands available in Wal-Mart.|`|AA10531094	I love Avon.  A coworker sells Avon and I buy a lot of their products especially jewelry.  Good Luck!|`|vxEDtriRaa	I used to sell it, but because I love it so much I wasn't making any profit. I had to stop selling so I would stop buying!|`|gs8MSMs3aa	i have never used it but i am addicted to marykay if anything. maybe cuz i never tried it tho sorry|`|2teGXshNaa	I don't like it becuase it seems cheap.

qs1NMpXQaa	Yes!! My friend just got hers done! Looks soo cute...my mom says i have to wait till im 16 ( 3 months ) wahoo haha. Some people it looks trashy on if they wear those really really long ones. I dont like those. But the cute ones with a simple rhinestone is adorable!! Make sure you go to a clean place so they have sterile needles. Keep good care of it so it doesnt get infected...and it wont hurt as bad afterward! But deff go for it...if you worried about the pain...its not bad i watched my friend get hers done...she didnt even flinch!! haha|`|wSYhEREjaa	i used to have mine. No it doesn't hurt that bad, just a pinch really. Um make sure you clean it about 2-3 times a day with this stuff.it will probably be in the shop where you get it pierced.  http://www.h2oceanstore.com/h2ocean-pier...    try not to play with it or touch it! or it will get infected    ?|`|qbbNtGVcaa	go for it! i don't have it but they seem cool haha. i hear it doesn't hurt too bad just make sure you clean it!
UxaWvwpDaa	ok. im not a skin care expert, but i have used some of these products and i would say the philosophy completely clear kit($35), or either one of the clinique kits(acne solutions,or step 2,3,4 kit) would work pretty good. hope i helped! :)
6JMjNHf6aa	i think it will help it never hurts to try something new
FkQhzG1Waa	explain what you mean by too loose, and i'll try to help|`|kknSPYxKaa	Girl, you need to start washing your hair more, once a week isn't enough.
AA10641440	Yes, it is good for your hair.  Use it as directed, and with regular hair cuts you will see great improvement. Stay away from the Pantene products!!!!   As far as $$$. I have no idea. Good luck.
I6zQeNGzaa	My hair cannot live without Camellia Oil. Ever since I started using this stuff my hair feels like SILK. Ofcourse, there are alot of other oils I use but none of them compare to this one.

Its for your hair and body (but i just use it for my hair)  it makes your hair super easy to comb when its wet/tangled, and it makes it veryy shiny and straight.
rouEETTBaa	i have very thick hair and it really didn't work for me if you want to make your hair grow longer just take vitamins everyday and wash your hair about every 2 days i did this for about 3 months and my hair grew like 4 inches but you could try it it might work for you|`|2teGXshNaa	no shampoo will make your hair "grow" just make sure that while its growing out, treat it nicely (no excessive blow drying, flat iron, curling iron etc) so that once it does grow out, you'll have beautiful locks!

xmDxtcvaaa	I would go with the Maybelline, Max Factor, and Cover Girl. Neutrogena & Revlon are a little more expensive and I've noticed that they're geared a little bit towards older women. To me, the quality of Rimmel isn't as good as Maybelline, Cover Girl, and Max Factor.     Those three have great colors, a pretty wide variety.     My preference for mascara is either the Volume Couture by Max Factor, or Lash Stilleto/ Volume Express by Maybelline. For foundation, I like the mineral powder by Maybelline. For eye shadows & lip gloss they all have great colors. Blush I like Maybelline.    Since you're strawberry blonde, stay away from blue eye shadows. Avoid pinkish tone foundations, they'll make you look too rosey. For blush, a light natural pink with warm tones is best since you're fair (I'm really fair too and light pink works the best). For eyeshadow, natural colors like champagne are great (I like the shimmery ones).    A little gold colored eye shadow looks good on eyes and even a little on the cheekbones. Good luck and I hope this helped!|`|d28ed6e6ffd2770c91461a1986db486daa	its not the brands, its the colours you use. maxfactor do great mascaras, neutrogena do great face care, rimmel do great eyeliners and revlon...never really tried it.    For any eyeshadows i reccomend MAC.|`|53QQ9KXEaa	I love Neutrogena products... Revlon is pretty good too. Maybelline has really good mascara.|`|QNhyowIKaa	maybelline , covergirl, and max factor|`|p1fGGzsEaa	NOT Maybelline! Excuse my language, but that makeup is literally crap! It just falls all over the place and smudges and clumps. Is it okay if i mix them up? Covergirl is great, Neutrogena works rlly well, and revlon is bomb! Hope it helped!|`|DppfAR0vaa	i will suggest Maybelline, have o look on this web page, is just amazing.  http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=AhJ7io6JLr...    max factor, not bad, but maybelline, is much better  http://au.youtube.com/watch?v=mO49lA-MOV...  and covergirl, really good too   http://au.youtube.com/results?search_typ...|`|ULMvSsycaa	neutrogena, revlon, max factor
0775db8a72ae6b2a6427be855b4c6849aa	I love this color!    Pros:   - Smells amazing  - Doesn't go on green. It actually goes on like just a shimmery goldish color.  - Super shimmery  -Applicator makes it go on very evenly  -Not sticky  -Long lasting    Cons:  - I'd rather have a sponge brush applicator but the brush is managable. It just depends on the person.    But I hoped I helped :) I really suggest it!|`|N2AqltB9aa	Any MAC cosmetic works very well.    The gloss offers a smooth application, and also gives the lips a great shine. The consistency of the gloss is nice and thick and creamy, so it doesn't dry out the lips...But it moisturizes them. It is not too sticky, unlike most lip glosses.    Cons? Psh, I don't think there is really any cons to this.    And I am not too sure about Spring Bean, but Nectar is very popular and is good to use with just about any skin color.    Hope I helped! :)|`|lGclixPuaa	I Can't help you but I noticed your picture. OMG EDWARD ( AND Rob Pattinson) is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo HOT
y8qSK6d1aa	its a reliable site, dont worry...their shipping i dont think is the fastest...but its okay(:|`|BvjPU3wkaa	I've ordered from them a couple of times and have never had a problem.  The last shipment that I received from them was in January.  It took a while to get here (I'm in Canada) but the order was placed over Christmas so I can understand the delay.
mX0qaX3Eaa	Yep. Keep it personal. Think about things you love, styles of art you appreciate, things that remind you of things.    Don't just go for an idea because it's trendy or because you think it looks good at the time. You WILL get bored of it.|`|8THz1sp9aa	Theres plenty of ideas, but the best would be to keep it something meaningful to you. Hardships of your past, or anything from your past really always make for a good custom sleeve. Ask yourself  'does space or the sky really have some sort of meaning to my life?' don't just get anything, really think about it. good luck :)|`|ucQxe2e4aa	i'm getting a food sleeve featuring all my favorite foods. i did go to culinary school and am very passionate about food.. obviously.|`|7u7FSlRZaa	The graffitti one sounds tightt

4d8vzYbqaa	honey masks are amazing! what you do is just apply a layer of honey to your face after you get it damp with a warm, wet, wash cloth. leave the honey on for about 20-30 minutes. then wash it off with warm water. after that, give your face a rinse of cold water to close your pores. then apply a nice face lotion. the honey makes skin incredibly soft, and also reduces redness! if you have spot problems, like pimples, that are red, then apply a dab of honey on the area and cover it up with a bandaid over night! then you just rinse off the honey in the morning =)|`|IrdcAhnFaa	Well I Know that if you mix the honey you have, with some quaker oats(they are pretty cheap), and some warm water to make a paste, you might look like a monster, but it will even out your skin, moisturize it, take some redness away, and maybe get rid of the zits.     If you are willing to spend the extra few dollars, buy some tea tree oil, just a dab of it gets rid of zits overnight!!|`|wJcpjDLUaa	http://beauty.about.com/od/skinflaws/a/f...  there's a bunch of different recipes.

However, such makeup tips on eyes that are already large can led to overkill. Whats a naturally doe-eyed gal to do? All it takes is learning how to use the opposite effects to your advantage.         The main thing to keep in mind when it comes to drawing attention away from large eyes is to stick to dark colors. Dark shades of eye shadow effectively create a closing effect, which makes eyes appear smaller. So the next time you go makeup shopping, be sure to snag a couple of eye shadows in different shades of grays, blacks/charcoals, dark blues and deep purples.         Eyeliner is another helpful tool in creating the illusion of smaller eyes. Carefully lining the entire eye will make them appear to recede, but in a good way. As with eye shadow, go for dark colors when using eyeliner such as dark brown, navy or black, depending on your skin tone. The trick with using eyeliner effectively is to make sure that you dont overdo it. Liquid eyeliner tends to be too heavy in appearance, so stick to pencil eyeliner. You want the lines to be thick but not obvious- eyeliner is supposed to define your eyes, not be the main focus (remember you want to draw attention away from your large peepers). Line both your upper and lower rims, being careful to stay as close to the lash line as possible. Allow your eyeliner to meet at the upper and lower corners, which will create the closing effect. Apply mascara to the bottom lashes as well as the top to finish off the look.         If youre not very savvy when it comes to applying liner, here are three easy steps to followpractice makes perfect!             Start with the lower rim of your eyes, just beneath the lashes. Smudge with a sponge to soften the line.        Now move on to the top lid and draw a steady line from the inner corner of your eye to the outer corner. Make sure to thicken the line gradually as you work your way from the inner corner to the outer corner.        Stand back from the mirror and double check your handiwork. Fix any mistakes with makeup remover or smudge with a sponge to control the thickness of your lines.         When applying liner, make sure that the pencil isnt too soft or too hard. For soft pencils, stick them in a refrigerator for a few minutes. For hard pencils, hold the liner in between your fingers.         The perfect makeup look that allows you to showcase sexy eyes without worrying about their size is the smokey eye look. This popular makeup look involves using dark and neutral colors. Achieving this affect is simple, especially if youre already a pro at applying eyeliner and eye shadow.             Line both the top and bottom rims with black liner. Smudge the liner in the outer corners of your eyes to soften the look.        Apply a thin line of black eye shadow over the eyeliner to emphasize the liner youve used.        Apply a neutral or charcoal shadow all over the top lid. Blend as needed.        Finish off with mascara.|`|A9oStYsCaa	like the joker from the dark knight...

Dd5YdYFFaa	When you wake up run a spoon under cold water and hold it to each eye for a few seconds, it should calm down the bags or puffiness you have under your eyes. Then, add your concealer below the eyes, foundation/blush/etc. Then take a white eye pencil and line your lower waterline with it, and add white shadow to the corners of your eyes, then add your eyeliner, and on the inner waterline, only halfway across, then add mascara and you should be good to go :D|`|m7Y10ojiaa	Use a soft white kohl eyeliner on your inner rims... it will make your eyes look brighter and bigger!|`|nqkXE1cUaa	tart by opening up the eyes with a shimmery eyeshadow in your favorite shade. Swipe the entire lid (upper and lower) but be aware that darker shades can age the eyes. Keep it dark enough to provide a bit of contour but light enough to keep eyes bright.  Step2  Add a youthful pop to your eyes with a quick dot of shimmery gold shadow at the corners to open them from both ends. This step also minimizes heavy undereye circles.  Step3  Lift the eyes for a younger appearance by arching the brows with your brush and/or tweezers. A subtle alteration can create a dramatically younger face. Do be careful not to over-tweeze.  Step4  Highlight your freshly arched brows (which, by the way, bring the eye of the viewer upward and away from crow's feet) with a light application of highlighting cream shadow just below them. Be wary of highlighting powders just under the eyebrow. They can appear too dramatic and unnatural.  Step5  Curl the lashes and add a pop of color with your everyday mascara. This step creates a youthful appearance by opening the eyes even more with very little effort (and it's a very natural looking trick!).  Step6  Line the eyes lightly, being careful not to put much liner near the inner corner. Leave that space for your gold shimmery shadow to keep the eyes fresh looking.  Step7  Add just a touch of concealer. This is where so many women make their crucial mistake. Too much concealer around the eyes sets into aging skin, making fine lines and wrinkles more apparrent. Instead of attempting to cover lines, simply focus on masking dark circles just a bit.  Step8  Use a facial highlighting pen to trace the bridge of the nose and underneath the eyes.  Step9  Consider giving yourself an instant "face lift" with a pulled back hairstyle for special occassions. Works every time!|`|nstz1Lkeaa	put on a light/shimmery eyeshadow to make em not so noticeable.. also u can put on eyeliner under ur eye because it makes them look more just awake in general|`|TyFoi2ONaa	White eyeliner makes you look weird so as an alternative you can take a light metallic eyeshadow and apply it to the inside corners of you eyes. Also take the same eyeshadow and sweep it right underneath your eyebrow.Obviously your gonna wear mascara, so that's basically it.

bAYVSfdJaa	Curved barbell.. but I think a straight one could be appropriate depending on your anatomy.    I imagine it being pretty difficult to change.  It's one of those piercings that's better off being left alone.    Same way you take care of any oral piercing: non alcoholic mouth wash, and maybe a few sea salt rinses.  Avoid alcohol & dairy for the healing process, and remember to brush your teeth regularly as these piercings can get a plaque build up.

As far as moisturizers go they have different types based on your skin type (i.e. dry, oily, combination). Usually they offer a cleanser, toner, and moisturizer in one set. This is usually the best deal.     I prefer this as oppose to using over-the-counter stuff which usually has harsh chemicals in it. Check it out...

oHO0XOQVaa	Goodwill or any other kind of second hand shop. Look up some thrift store places in your phonebook and ask if they happen to have anything.  Good style.|`|HQ4PsETWaa	Antique shops, flee markets, garage sales, yard sales, etc...

UY9N3VUXaa	what you have right now (if read by someone who speaks french they will understand what it means, doesnt have to be a litteral translation) translates pretty much into what you want, "the truth about diamonds" , however, if its for a tattoo you might want to consider shortening it.     la vrit des diamants, for instance. "the truth of diamonds"    if this tattoo is in respect of the diamond crisis in Africa, add some images to the text, like a couple little diamonds with maybe some red blood dots.    if its directly related to "the truth about diamonds" by nicole richie, maybe consider adding a few key "image icons" from the book, so when people look at it they will know the difference of meaning.|`|kvLWTTlhaa	That's more like 'the truth on the subject of diamonds'.  In this case, 'au sujet de' could be replaced by 'sur', for something more along the lines of 'the truth about diamonds'.    You've also got some funky capitalization going on !    Hope it helps =]|`|eEznnpnVaa	"Sur", when used to mean "about" as a preposition, means "concerning" or "regarding" [rather than it's literal definition of the position "on top" of something]. So, MY guess [taken 4 courses in French] would be "La vrit sur des diamants". However, I think "au sujet des..." would also be technically  correct, just not colloquial/normal speech.     You really would need to ask a native speaker to find the most commonly used way of saying it.      Is this a famous quote or something? I don't really understand the meaning.|`|7u7FSlRZaa	Whats the point of that?
RZ72YJGCaa	:o    Yes.It would look so 80's.  And I think your legs are not fat.    :)|`|ucZOCMyAaa	it looks great.

(NOT SCHOOL)|`|4j6vNSFkaa	i love it|`|jeDtvychaa	in my opinion, i think a classic shirt with a hoodie will look great. i think the leg warmers will also look good with a plaid mini skirt.    i personally love converse all star 'chuck taylors' and i think i could go well with the outfit.

Zmc9RRGZaa	you could but u must be specefic and tell them exactly what to do or else they will go off and do there own thing|`|AA10641440	Yes, but take a picture. Have the stylist repeat back to you exactly what you have asked for, to insure no mistakes are made.|`|UHpqcG9Vaa	mhmmm no. i tried before, but they serouisly cut it shorter than how you ask them. i suggest going to a salon, they are hair stylist. supercuts only cut hair.

oX9hnJV1aa	I think you have great vision regarding the  expansion of your tattoo.  One thing I would offer for your consideration though.......  The shading on your skull.... remember what it looked like when it was fresh... kinda an angry red glow to the black? Welllllllllll.... Skin Candy has developed what they call their "Roan Black Cherry Inks", they come in three shades. They are all "black" with strong black cherry overtones. The three shades are Light, Medium and Dark. I ordered a set.... we experimented on ourselves in our shop and like the results. Not as dramatic as some of the advertisements would make ya expect.. but definitely noticable. I think that these inks may make you very happy. Check em out on Skin Candys web site.  Best of Luck!|`|8THz1sp9aa	If those colors make you happy, then it shouldn't matter what we think it should look like.|`|6L9jJnchaa	Why are you asking US?  It's your body and you're going to be stuck with it, lol.|`|H3PcFertaa	You should go to your tattoo/artist with your color ideas, and discus this.  He/she will know how the inks that they have will translate to the colors that you are thinking. And they should know about longevity of the inks. This may effect your color choices.  Your doing fine with your visualization, just convey this and see what will come of your consultation.  luck~|`|HvHBF8glaa	If that makes you happy than do it!
tVluPTPraa	its always been good for me...|`|IkdB22IXaa	You just need to be careful that they dont rip your skin completely off.
AA11156937	I used the Conair Ion Shine hot rollers ... They made it in several shapes depending on what you prefer.  It gives you the soft curls ... I got the big one which I wish I got the small and big rollers.|`|Xc9MJMMcaa	if you buy a 1 and a half inch barrel hot tools curling iron, itll work just the same.. but as for rollers, if you want looser, miley cyrus, curls, you should leave them in shorter than if you want tight curls.. you have to test them and see how they feel, all rollers are different.. as for brands, all are the same, just make sure the heat is high.
Ug59D75laa	Youtube helps a ton!    Seventeen.com has a section for hairstyles based on different face types, {including round}, so I'd check that out.    If you have a nice body, flaunt it in a dress that hugs your curves but that's not skin tight*.    Soft waves are glam for a party.    &hygiene is verrrrry important, so make sure you're hygenic!    Good luck!|`|5ieWhvYCaa	You can't.|`|lGclixPuaa	Just have confidence, stand up straight, and you'll look prettier already.|`|au9MvNQDaa	use two shades of blusher - the lighter one above your cheekbone and the darker right below it - also use bronzer around the border of your face - this will make it look more shadowed and smaller.|`|8d6BxvGmaa	for the acne, i use clean and clear and it works. proactive doesnt, my friend tried proactive and she said that it does nothing|`|Ds3G8yVxaa	home remedies work best is what i think try to unclog your pores my pinching it (without nails) until all the yuck gets out then wet it with warm then cool (not cold) water on a face cloth. Then put toothpaste over any pimples or pores you just unclogged. sweep light blush under your cheek bone and then put a whisk of darker (not the darkest color you have btw) dab some tan eye Shadow right under your eyes. Put a nice light coat of mascara on. lip gloss and put some nice color of bush on your cheeks.
IrY6w2X2aa	babe fake tan is a no go route for straight boys because no matter what people say, they always notice youve been at the bottled tan! whether its the smell or the patches! ha but yeh go on sunbed for like maybe three 3minute sessions? dont expect to go brown because you wont. all it will do is prepare your skin so that it is ready when u are in the sun on holiday and so won't burn. u won't get a tan unless you wear suntan cream though! trust me, you will just crisp up!  have fun on holiday in the sun! -jealous!|`|AA12054246	sack the fake tan and sunbeds , wear a high Factor sun cream in the sun you will still get a lovely golden glow . you dont want to end up like that dickinson bloke do you ? keep it natural xx|`|xdF08Uqfaa	you sound ginger as well.sorry mate.|`|Xef2mbGcaa	Sun bed.|`|lGclixPuaa	fake tans and sunbeads can give you skin cancer.

Especially on a man. My boyfriend is pale and redhead and I love it. Be proud of your natural colouring. Besides fake tan  never looks like a natural tan and it smells funny too. Sunbeds may make you look tanned now but they give you skin cancer and age you badly. You need to think about what you will look like in the future, you can easily prevent wrinkles and damage but you cant get rid of it without surgery. Be proud to be pale and interesting.x

VTjrLpebaa	Start taking vitamin E and C for your skin. Get a face lotion with vitamin e, try St. Ives. Dont use too much, just in the dry spots at night after you rinse your makeup off before bed. Mineral make is great you can get a clear powder foundation. Be sure to rinse it off before bed though. Try an exfoliating face wash, St. Ives again is good. Im in Washington and go to Walmart for these items. The face lotion here is around $6, mineral powder foundation $10 and the face wash about $4.

The store-bought portion of this regime is the Juice Beauty and Burt's Bees, but they are also organic, so that's a plus.     First off: a good exfoliator is sugar and olive oil. Use 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of sugar. Make sure your face is damp, and you've used warm water to open your pores. For a face wash, try Burt's Bees Soap Bark and Chamomile Deep Cleansing Cream. So you don't block any pores, and make your mild acne worse, use an oil-free moisturizer. Juice Beauty has an oil-free moisturizer.     A good mask, once a week: Mix in bowl 1 egg, 1 tsp honey, 1/2 tsp olive oil and few drops of rose water. Use this as a mask for dry skin. Once applied keep it for sometime, later rinse it off with warm water. Dab it dry.    Please keep in mind that this is what has worked for me. I'm not sure if it will work for you, but I've kept in mind what you've previously stated about your skin's condition. :D     Tell me how it goes? :):) Hope it works for you.     PS: I live in Canada too. Stupid cold weather ruining our skin and hair. Hehe. You can get Burt's Bees and Juice Beauty from any pharmacy. Juice Beauty is also sold in Sephora.     Friend2012|`|fSGimEl8aa	I  have dry skin too with little or no oil on it so I feel your pain. However I have a darker complexion because I frequent the tanning bed. I use proactive solution even though I don't have acne and it works great, I don't think it dries my skin out even more at all. Since you don't have much acne I would start with a tinted moisturzizer on top of your every day moisturizer instead of foundation because foundation can be very heavy and hard to match to your skin tone. Remember to only apply makeup if you just washed cleansed and moisturized your skin. If you have some acne areas use concealer on those spots with a finishing powder one shade lighter than your skin on top so you don't draw more attention to the zit. I use stilla sheer color tinted moisturizer you can get it at sephora for around thirty five dollars but if you see looking to pay less try clinique almost makeup tinted moisturizer I think its nineteen. These both work great and give your whole face a natural glow. I personnaly barely ever use concealer because I am blessed with clear skin but clinique and almay have nice ones that don't get flaky and dry looking. Over the tinted moisturizer try some finishing powder.  I use bare minerals multi tasking minerals and clear radiance to set the tinted moisturizer. I think these are both around twenty five or thirty. Then I use a bit of light bronzer with golden undertones on my cheeks, nose, forehead, and chin, all the areas the sun would naturally hit. I love bare minerals warmth or clinique true bronze pressed powder. For you since you are light skinned try a bronzer with peach undertones so you do not look orange and never over do the bronzer or you will look like your face is a different color than your body. The clinique one is like twenty two and the bare minerals one twenty five or thirty. I finish with blush, usually bare minerals blush in laughter which is around twenty. I know some of these products are expensive but they last a while and the quality is much better than most drug store brands. also remember the trick to great natural face makeup is the right tools so invest in a nice pair of brushes from bare minerals clinique or sephora. Also on natural days I apply only the tinted moisturizer with a bit of almond oil on my cheeks and forehead for a dewy glow. Good luck! I hope these products work for you.|`|r3kLPnisaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out several products.This is a good review website at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and look around at the reviews.

My layers are down to my shoulders and maybe that's where you should get them|`|fzVsRMZbaa	1. get hair evened out so it doesnt look screwed up  2. get bangs they look good on pretty much everyone    but, if u don't like the way ur bangs turn out u can always pin them back or do a punk poof with them!!

Try target they have decent priced accessories that aren't too girly and go good with plenty of outfits and purse styles. You should also check out the purse section at your local kohl's they have a wide variety of wallets and purses for any pesronality.|`|pSEWvpzVaa	only one shop have for you and good price http://onetwostyle.com|`|4wo71PYHaa	Ross and Marshalls- you can find a variety of very cute but inexpensive not only wallets but also purses to match|`|Ch8LYGK6aa	forever 21 & charlotte russe|`|syxkw9sBaa	definitely t.j. maxx. they have a lot of designer, good quality ones for waaay cheap too!  mine is from american eagle though.  its grey and pink plaid, idk if thats too girly for you but its cute!
Xc9MJMMcaa	its called a flip..    http://z.about.com/d/mensfashion/1/0/K/d...|`|6b74f55f93bab6c956e62ad06a7d48b9aa	Haha, I used to do that.  But I stuck mine straight up, and I mean straight up.  It use to be the style and it sort of still is, just not straight up, but just so they are sticking up.|`|KQjBLyU3aa	I have no pictures, sorry. But I've seen a few guys with that hairstyle too.|`|gk872x0oaa	Oh jeez, my teachers hair is like that.    I think its really cute,  but i like hair with no gel, & have it really soft.    :)
jMffH1kzaa	will you shave my head? lol just ask her if she wants to hang out some time and see if she approves of your idea...maybe she thinks your cuter with hair? if she does, then ask her if she has any experience...some people have no idea how to!|`|KpWfkp7faa	be like 'hey, if you go out with me, i'll let you shave my my hair if you want'|`|AA12365169	Wow that does sound weird, lol. Well it really depends if you guys talk a lot or not. I think you should tell her your friends dared you to ask to cut your hair.
R3AN5WO0aa	sterilize the needle.  hold it over a flame and make sure its new and clean  (dont use a safety pin!)  a sewing needle works, or a tac but make sure its clean or itll get infected  numb it with ice on both sides for a LONGG time  and when u think ur ready just pop it through  you hear a pop from each layer u pierce through.    make sure you have a new clean earring to put in after  (buy good quality)    its really not painful and clean it with hydrogen peroxide and turn and twist it evry now and then|`|c31y45LQaa	i wouldn't. I know people that tried doing by them selves and like 9 out of 10 had infections...|`|rYX6Owfraa	my only tip is that you dont do it.  it will definitely get infected!!  get get it done a professional piercer. its only like $20|`|kPMQt25Daa	OMG NO NO NO!!!! u need to go get it done by a piercer!!! if u accidently pierce 1 of ur nerves then ur ear can go like all floppy n drupe down if u hit the wrong 1!!!|`|bAYVSfdJaa	Don't.  Do you really want your ear collapse?  Just shell out the $50 and get someone who knows what they're doing to do it.    Oh, and if it's a case of mommy or daddy saying 'no', wait until you're 18 - it won't kill you.|`|EcAYjUUNaa	go to a professional...you could get a really bad infection|`|InfvT0fiaa	okay well my friend did that  and one. she tweeked out because she was inflicting her own pain  and piercing herself.. so! now her piercing is all crooked and not  even in the spot she wanted it...  but two. she was absolutely broke and i guess if you really wanted  it THAT bad... (with risk of infection of course) then go on right ahead  however, if you want it done right without worry  i suggest going to a piercer|`|JLkUUFV3aa	amanda r u kidding me?  dude I agree with the other posters ur gonna get infected if u do it urself  plus I mean u have enough piercings    what would mason & trace think if ur ear like collapsed on itself?|`|MHTIe6hTaa	well first of all MAKE SURE you clean the needle really really good before piercing your ear.    you can burn it and then clean it off with alcohol  okk then after that clean the part of your ear that your  going to pierce with alcohold and if you want you can  numb it with some ice or apply some canker sore medicine  on there which will numb it fersure! but if you do apply the  canker sore med on it just leave it till it's numb then clean it  off and pierce it.    well good luck.  and make sure to keep cleaning your ear after it's pierced  so you wont end up with any infections.|`|HHyny0JSaa	Yeah... go to a piercer|`|7u7FSlRZaa	your an idiot|`|gzaVGE4Qaa	You can buy sterilized piercing needles from certain websites. They come packaged individually and then you throw them out (have fun sticking a needle through yourself, my ex boyfriend used to do it all the time). But you should go to a professional, it's worth the money.|`|N7OQhGDsaa	i did my upper ear piercing by myself like 5 months ago and its perfectly fine.  and i did it with one of those earrings they put in guns..  it didnt hurt and it healed extremely well.  just make sure you clean what ever it is that you are using to pierce yourself.    but its your choice if you want it done by a pro or done by yourself.  and if you do decide to go pro make sure the place doesnt use a gun.    have fun :)
rOCM4AXIaa	Don't dye your hair anymore anyways.  Guys aren't supposed to really dye their hair.    That picture is bad because you already look like a ghost .|`|wTMMG0enaa	i like your hair the way it is, but if you want it to be brown get like a light brown, or trying dying it then getting it frosted.|`|gFn45aNdaa	dont go to dark...if u keep it like a medium brown it will look fine.|`|4tHZunfUaa	just not too dark =)
8I4pHKmbaa	I dont trust all brands but you can make your own masks. My favorite is a green tea mask. To make it You just use green tea and mix it with flour and honey. Use enough flour to make it thick. You can find a lot of other recipes on the internet.   Hope this helps
c0uwtsJ5aa	Go to the websites of the stores you normally shop at and make a wishlist.   Or go to polyvore and make an outfit.  Thats what i do cause im going through the same thing as you|`|yFUGp3r3aa	omg i have the same exact problem.   just shop online and if you see something that you REALLY want... try saving up for it yourself!! (which is what I do... it usually takes so long that by the time i have come up with enough money I don't even really want the thing anymore LOL)|`|3rrJRHrdaa	Let me guess you voted for Obama? don't expect to go shopping for A WHILEEEE.      EDIT: Try going to a cheaper store than Hollister! I'm not saying Goodwill but something that's not $60 a shirt.|`|rWwqBau7aa	Haha. Why don't you just mix and match your new clothes and your old clothes to make a newer outfit? lol.|`|eykNXMzOaa	Go to Platos closet or good will. Designer clothes for cheap! i am talking about 10 dollars for abercrombie. Why give up your love for fashion?|`|GykCnbR7aa	maybe u can go shopping a little more often or go on polvore and make outfits   do u have a job?try to get one that u could do on the weekends and after school i know it might not be alot but each month u could buy a few things its more clothes then no clothes or when u find change save because i save all my change and i got over 50 dollars of it that will help u won't it?yes and i hope u get to go shopping more often now     EDIT:  and when stores have a sell buy the stuff on sale and if u parents allow u sell stuff u don't need on ebay|`|SihCInb9aa	find another hobby..|`|R3aVIRmUaa	thinking about people who can't go shopping|`|8a7c02df359d96db8ffa457a92b75e50aa	then go shopping.
O2gelOWBaa	You don't "need" to dress more anything; dress in clothes you feel comforatable in. Try dressing more girlier if you /want/, but just make sure you feel comforatable in doing it!      Edit: Sperry's are awesome. xD|`|yo0qnedIaa	Nawww. You sound normal.  (:  Dress how you feel comfortable and how you like.|`|P5mXlubvaa	Just dress however you want.  Life isn't a fashion show :)|`|SihCInb9aa	no.   just dress how you want.|`|ygELhfO6aa	Dress how you want to dress! Be yourself. Don't succumb to peer pressure. Why does it matter whether you dress girly or not?|`|UHh6Su6yaa	If you would like to dress girlier, then GO AHEAD!!! there are so many shops which sell girly clothes, like abercrombie, hollister, urban outfitters etc. But if not, then just be yourself. i also absolutely adore converse, i think they are awesome. Are you asking this question because you are thought of as emo at school? because if you are then just tell people to just shut up and mind their own business. but if you are asking this because of what you yourself thinks, then that means you are worried that you are going to be rejected in some way, or that you just think that you dress not girly enough. no one cares if you dress girly or not, they care about the person inside of you :)|`|w3Xdf9uhaa	I would just be myself!!! you sound like a really interesting person... if you wanted to, you could like wear an interesting dress or something to an occasion|`|bwQSkPgNaa	Should you dress girlier??? Only if you want to, i dress the same way!  I |`|VYwmCGlaaa	no you do not. be yourself, that's what's so great about clothing, you get to express YOURSELF. be YOU, theres nothing else better|`|1jlEwpu3aa	no, be your own person. I like the emo style, dont be another conformist. But you dont have to be emo all the time. mixing in aero or ae here and there should be fine.    You dont have to dress girlier|`|DtbJysjyaa	where do you live?  are you very popular in ur school?  how much do you care what other people in ur school think about you?    not that it matters...    answer those to ur self  if you really care what everyone thinks then try a designer shirt or two (or more)  if you don't then don't     either way only do what you feel comfy in|`|wm9BA5ozaa	Why would you need to dress girlier? Do what you want.
4jbFXoYfaa	second one no doubt about it|`|feb7143192e9c7ccb1a8b16f5fcd9677aa	the second one|`|D9D8Ezybaa	second one by far, and yes u can still wear it|`|ZJCoUMijaa	2nd one is better than the 1st but I try to avoid big brand names on all my clothes because it makes you look like a walking billboard.|`|i1T8yKhpaa	2nd|`|DIBzlY6Faa	Definetly the second one it looks cooler and I would want that one over the first one, but it's all up to you.|`|CVQa88Ujaa	2|`|sOTRIqLCaa	2nd the ffirst is ugly|`|BOQxPnjCaa	the second darker grey  the light grey looks more  childesh && not to in|`|4j6vNSFkaa	2nd one!|`|b9MSOr6laa	THE SECOND ONE!|`|U8R2o1P3aa	The second one is hott!  Buy it! its sexy lol  The second one isss by farr better. Go for it!  ;)|`|lK6FzBAuaa	NUMBERO UNO!|`|UECCsRKvaa	I LOVE the second one! That one definitely looks better!|`|E5YBzBkJaa	second:)|`|AA11208621	i like the second one .|`|XH0qPf33aa	the second one|`|lNDKI4Yfaa	What does being preppy have anything to do with which one looks better? Ugh.    And the less logo, the better. I like the wash and fit of the second one but you'd be better off with the first one because it's simple and classic.|`|bH2wgn7aaa	yea the second one is better =)|`|HAWwbpjraa	i like the 2nd one. :D|`|wm9BA5ozaa	I like the second. I don't think it looks preppy|`|ORluWHGAaa	Oh the second one is so much better.  Good choice. =]|`|nuISzHFRaa	The second one. Hate the first one.|`|PeAqoy1vaa	the second one, definitely|`|VYwmCGlaaa	boorrriingg. those are nothing exciting or interesting. but the 2nd one & yes of course you can wear it.|`|syxkw9sBaa	second probably.. even though the first one has a pop of color.  i like maroon better personally :)|`|150e076f660112479385c22c1c1c2b2eaa	2nd|`|3Kv3vlebaa	second one. Yeah of course you can wear it if you're not preppy. It's just a stereotype that preps wear ae and abercrombie, etc..  wear what you like.|`|64b5ddb91a78f9cb5f26f04d8b418497aa	most definitely the second :)|`|JbUfC9d0aa	I'm no boy, but maybe the second one! Looks preppy, but makes you stylish!|`|yU2WHyvgaa	i like the first 1|`|9QL9Wpo8aa	go for the secound one|`|g8J8GHe9aa	second is way nicer   and the gray is better  |`|SFFTnmsXaa	i DEFENATLY like the second....      i am an american eagle addict!!! literally|`|0c8b5589d3a30a3b9cd46d4620faeb5caa	the second ones more interesting to look at (:|`|lOguMWVGaa	the second one
pBvMaOfdaa	I used to have the EXACT SAME problem as you. I think everyone's skin is different, so it's actually impossible to say which product is the best.     The best way is to get rid of your acne naturally because chemicals will leave your skin clear for a while, but will soon come back. What you should do is drink more water, eat A LOT of fruits and vegetables, and exercise. I'm sure you've heard this before, but trust me, once you start following the rules you WILL notice a difference ! My acne is all gone now, and I only have a few unnoticable acne scars.    Also, get try regular (not acne) face washes. For me, Clinique  2 helped my acne a lot, even though it is not designed fto cure acne. You should try that; there are 1,2,3, and 4. 1 is for normal skin, 2 is for dry and oily combination skin, 3 is for oily combination skin, and 4 is for very oily skin. You should really try it !    Good luck and hope your acne gets better !|`|pXnoIJHzaa	ProActiv works very very very well. You may not want to use it so get a sirum that dries out pimples, you can put nongel like toothpaste on it to dry them up|`|nHi1mioBaa	Yes Acne Free is what i used and it completly cleared out my acne.I always had like 2 or 3 pimples,and lots of red bumps,but it works    In this case,you only have it on one place,so dont use anything too strong ( things like acnefree and proactive have really strong chemical in it ).......use only a acne treatment cream or gel at night after wash face and before go to bed.    Dont touch it,dont pop it.Drink alot of water.Not enough water seem to be your problem so try to drink lottttss of water and eat fresh food please.    pick me at best answer plz :)|`|aiBzKyjlaa	go to a dermatologist or ask if your doctor can prescribe Differn, its a topical cream that you apply nightly to help tighten your pores and clear acne. Also, Benzaclin is another cream that you can use in the morning to dry out your acne.|`|EcAYjUUNaa	that sounds similiar to what i have ...try to use things that has salicyic acid and benzyol peroxide...hope this helps :)|`|gFn45aNdaa	ok i know this may sound a little gross and weird. I used to have the same problem and i did this...and my face is never been clearer.    dissolve about a tablespoon of active dry yeast in a halfcup of warm water...stir it up and drink it down as quickly as possible...this is going to clean out all the toxins in ur body. trust me...it really works...it tastes bad but its just once and it's great.|`|yBrKP2sFaa	Proactiv works really good, they have alot of products but it's not like I'm a company trying to con you into by using celebertys haha. Then again your problem could be that your drinking to much soda and or eating things that have artificial sweeteners etc because that could cause acne. Stress is another factor.|`|3gX59LH4aa	I like the Murad acne complex line. Whatever you decide, you should pick one brand, and use only their products (everyone designs their stuff to work the best together). Make sure you use a cleanser, treatment, and moisturizer. Also, it will take time (maybe a couple months) to tell if your skin responds to it. P.S. good choice skipping proactiv. I've always heard benzoyl peroxide is very bad for you, so try to find something that doesn't use that.|`|lw8n5BFeaa	Burts bees peachface scrub or something, lol I'm to lazy to get the bottle    It's all natural ingrediants, It doesent smell like crap (sorta like peaches ^.^) and if you spend a good five minutes rubbing it in, by the next day all the redness should be gone; works for me, I would suggest you try it (:|`|N7AzaX62aa	AcneFree and Proactiv are both expensive over-the-counter skin care options. Have you every considered natural treatment methods like the ones described at Acne Free in 3 Days?    You might also refer to some of the acne treatment articles over at WebMd.

y8LVlmlJaa	LOreal Carbon Black!|`|yE4dpN2Caa	Clinique's high impact Mascara|`|az0Z0DIjaa	I like Maybelline Great Lash. It's basic, cheap and you can buy it at Wal-Mart.|`|YYfUzxNzaa	You should use a light brown.  Layer it.    To get it even popper, try light pink eye shadow.|`|wTMMG0enaa	well i like using the bare naturale mascara, the mascara wand is really easy on my lashes, it's soft and the mascara is easy to remove. I also like the eyelights mascara by covergirl.|`|ptGhiqe3aa	i have blue green eyes as well,  there are two kinds of mascara that i really love!    first, the double extend by loreal, it is a two part system, a white layer, then a black layer. it creates tubes around your lashes, like little baby hair extensions!    the second is, lash blast luxe. its like the original lash blast, (in the big orange tube) only now, they have got little shimmers in the black so that you get some color and extra shine!    oh, and i usually use a brown-black or light black colored mascara because i am more on the fair side and dark eyes look raccoon-ish on me.    hope i helped!|`|e3US61FDaa	Bad Gal lash.|`|AA11040177	I like Lancombe'   They are a bit one the expensive side, but really make a difference inthe length of your lashes........$24.00|`|MzqQd6tXaa	Covergirl exact eyelights. you can get it for your eye colour|`|xQwmHlU6aa	I love loreal telescopic its awesome and it doesn't make clumps on your lashes. Also maybelline (I don't know the name but its the one with the green and pink tube) is really good to lengthen your lashes. These are the best ones I have tried so far and they're fabulous! Bestest ever.....Ever!  I hope this helps and hopefully you'll love them as much as I do!    Ps. EVER! Lmao|`|yENww2b0aa	loreal telescopic for defo!!!!

yFUGp3r3aa	omg ure like the same as me. I have a problem with hollister/abercrombie/ae etc. or anything of that style lol    since i am bored i will just give you a bunch of random things that are cute and could possibly match together. also u may hate everything because i'm not sure what kind of stuff you like... I am said to be a bit wild when it comes to fashion lol but GOOD wild! always think of wearing things with a flattering silhouette. for example, try a short, chunky grey sweater dress with a stylish plaid scarf, and ankle length leggings with dark fringe boots. keep the colors simple, too! I try to do  mostly one color, a little bit of another color, and a super small amount of the 3rd color. try to keep only one pattern per outfit, too.  good luck!    http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/cat...  thats a dress  http://www.jcrew.com/browse/multi_produc...  bag  http://www.jcrew.com/AST/Browse/WomenBro...  necklace  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...

3d3JW4Wuaa	You should get human hair weaves and if you want them to stay in get them braided in.     If you take care of the human hair weaves they should last much longer than 3months.

zmjAccMFaa	Okay well I will tell you quickly what the piercings are.  In the center is called a labret http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/co...    Lip is just to either side of the lip (right or left) http://bp0.blogger.com/_GiMaIGztpbg/Rw9y...    There are more technically terms for each but I am not going to go into them and your piercer would understand if you just pointed to it.    They are all about the same on pain, even though it is very little to begin with.    The best way to decide what to get is to find out what would look the best on you.|`|HnTpvVEEaa	lol my bro. has 5 lip rings so basicly one on every side of his lip. i just asked him which one was the least painful and he said they all felt the same sorry. but i used to have the middle done and i did it myself with a safety pin and suprisingly didnt hurt that bad! so relax it doesnt hurt to bad and just pick the side you like best=] i personally like the middle. good luck!|`|Yue2YKTnaa	its a needle   what do you expect ?  it'll hurt|`|5z5nagElaa	Anywhere will hurt, but the sides I think are less painful|`|FDBJs1lOaa	There is not a least painful spot when dealing with the bottom part of the lip. If you were asking whether or not top or bottom lip was least painful, it would definitely be the bottom, so you're good there. I suggest you get it on whatever side you prefer because after all, pain subsided, you're going to be the one with the cute new piercing!  good luck :)

FNzninfGaa	My boyfriend's hair is naturally wavy, and he usually just gets it buzzed to about half an inch then lets it grow until his bangs start to get in his eyes. If you don't want to mess with your hair every day like us ladies do, I'd suggest something similar.|`|vV65XhJlaa	shaggy cut.

GoodLuck!|`|AA11156937	If you don't have the CHI straightener, maybe you should get that instead since it's a lot less than GHD and it works the same.  I have my CHI 3 years a ago and I still love them.|`|sOYUCM1vaa	I think you'll find, that $240.00 is probably what you'll get them for. Even on e-bay. They are ridiculously expensive, but honey....they do the job! Honestly once you use them, you'll be lost without them and in the long run, considering if you were anything like me and spent a fortune on products trying in vain to create the flat, sleek look. You'll spend more in 6 months on products than you would on your own pair of GHD's.

fa641908cae350e97f3d9f50335dc90eaa	Aloe vera is a beautiful common houseplant that has been used for centuries in folk remedies. The soothing gel found inside of the leaves helps to soothe burns and bug bites and moisturizes the skin without an oily build-up. If you are wondering how your can transform your houseplant into aloe vera gel like that found in your local supermarket, the process is simple and easy. It will reduce redness of your pimples :)|`|9uorn5Qyaa	Yes, you can use it. It might actually help you acne, afterall, it is a plant. I have acne also, and when I put it on it sometimes makes it better.|`|PTP8ptDbaa	no not gel try aloe vera cream!|`|jQAFL9phaa	no you can use it on your face. unless the certain brand you are using says you shouldn't. but most aloe-vera can be used on the face

eIzj5Zg0aa	That's super wierd? before blaming jewelery, look into all your shower products. using any funky soaps? Do your fingers usally get pruny? it might be a lose of circulation. Do you wear any other type of tight ring? This might be your skin's reaction to a chemical in the water. So if i were you talk to your family members, maybe your not the only one?     Good luckk! hope it's nothing dangerous|`|SHdrYV0Naa	Hm that's weird, how long has this been happening for like a month or just a couple days?  Have you talked to any of your friends as maybe they can also help.  Does your fingers hurt?  Maybe your best bet is to ask your family doctor.
yTfnJmAraa	If you're darker skinned that maybe why. Usually lighter skinned people will have blue discoloration.|`|4KOuL7mZaa	it probably is. if you don't like them than take some liquid foundation and a brush and just lightly put the foundation over the dark circle. it will cover them up. or if that doesn't work than just get some better sleep. =]|`|D35S61Dnaa	?? are you talking about dark eye bags?
CEEnPCYZaa	Match the color with your dress or out fit. Navy blue is SOOO pretty! Go to a fabric store and maybe buy a cutout or a base for a mask. Buy matching silk or satin ar anything that feels silky in a solid color no patterns! But silver and matching color sequins for glitter to highlight your cheekbones or your eyes by reflecting light off of the sequins. buy feathers and place them in good spots.! hope I helped!!!|`|EcAYjUUNaa	you should putlike sequins and feathers oon it...it would look soo cute :)|`|BC9nPXG7aa	feathers, glitter, stick with the same pattern and see if they all match up together|`|DHdK3vVoaa	Oooh, this sounds like so much fun! :)    If you happen to live near a craft store in your area, I would buy the following:    **A mask...most of them are plastic, but it beats making a real one out of paper mache :P  **Hot glue (you don't have to wait as long for everything to dry), although it does require you buying the apparatus and the hot glue sticks  **A bird (one of those ready-made ones), preferably with a clip  **A couple of tiny flowers in complimentary colors  **Feathers in complimentary colors  **A packet of plastic gemstones  **Ribbons  **Glitter glue, just to etch lines on the mask    I would pretty much center everything around the bird.  Hopefully it's not too big and you just clip it to the end of the mask.  Then simply glue away!  But of course you should be careful to balance both sides of the mask or it'll be too heavy for your face :P    Have fun with it!
b9MSOr6laa	no. i think sneakers and skinny jeans look terrible but that's my opinion.|`|CEEnPCYZaa	definetly!!

Add a graphic belt and some layered colorful necklaces and you're good to go.|`|wm4R4q3zaa	it would look alrite;; but it would of been better if u got higtops! they look cuter with skinny jeans|`|ST8SqDZzaa	lol, that's so ghetto|`|ptBKd1WAaa	i dont think you should wear them with skinny jeans because they look big in the back!!!!just from my opion!|`|vjGEXzmTaa	please dont,|`|5KfzuUA6aa	it looks nice i wear dat all the time |`|QCzVBHwNaa	it depends what kind of sneakers because if you wear skippies (like i do) it wont look "ghetto"  like someVVVVV said below.|`|fpyLWbVxaa	yeah it's okay|`|AA10233645	yeah but chucks or converse are beter sneakers to wear with that|`|R6Z8onywaa	i think those are more sweatpants sneakers there really, not show-offy sneakers with skinnies, sneakers dont looke the best with skinnies|`|4j6vNSFkaa	it will look alright. but chuckes look good with skinny jeans.|`|c0eddd97ccdd030d66f6488679dbb208aa	noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!...  i hate it when ppl do that u look supa skinny then u have monstrous shoes|`|YYfUzxNzaa	Wear sneakers.|`|lNDKI4Yfaa	In this case... just do whatever makes you feel confident.|`|gs8MSMs3aa	it works definalty.  if i were you i would go for it

TNTFomKeaa	Don't worry. It will grow back the same as it was before, not thicker or darker. How long it will take to grow back depends on your hair growth. You could probably use your eyebrows as a guide.  Have you considered going to a salon? They would be able to wax it for you which would be less painful and longer lasting. I also find that waxing makes the hair grow back finer in the future.|`|P94EeBvmaa	ew|`|FF4J59pMaa	They come back darker and thicker. Now that you plucked I think you should just get it waxed. You can also have laser hair removal done.I have to do the same thing but for me it is on my neck. Yeah it sounds disgusting but when I was little I wanted to be like my daddy so I decided to shave. BIG mistake! Now I get hairs on my neck and oh my gosh they are so annoying. I get it waxed every once in awhile and pluck when they start coming out. Hope this answers you question.|`|faf627e55a95a22d42d6bbdbbb2c5170aa	Time for you to start shaving.    Yes, it's a moustache -- some girls develop a moustache, just like boys do.    Most guys are OK about girls with, for example, a slight moustache.    If you do decide you have to do something, then there isn't a simple answer and there's a lot of misleading "information" around.    Facial (and also body) hair on women comes about in the same way as on men because of    1) your body being sensitized, before you were even born, to testosterone -- doesn't happen to all girls, but does to many    2) your body producing high levels of testosterone    The growth rate and coarseness of the hair depends on just how much testosterone is circulating in your bloodstream.    Steer clear of bleaching -- when someone sees you against the light you'll look as if you have a glowing moustache. Believe me, it shows up far, far worse.    As far as removing it is concerned it's worth remembering that    * Waxing, plucking, threading, epilating all pull the hair out by the roots and where the growth is hormonally-driven can actually stimulate a dormant follicle into producing more hair quicker. They also distort the root if done repeatedly, leading to hair growing at strange angles. And you've got to let the hair grow to quite a length before you can repeat the exercise. It can also damage the skin and discolor it. Long-term use of waxing also causes bad wrinkles.    * Chemical depilatories strong enough to remove the hair are very likely to burn the skin, cause swelling and cause long-term discoloration of the skin.    * Laser is also liable to cause burning and discoloration and in any case only works effectively on a dark hair/light skin combinantion.    * Electrolysis is very liable to cause scarring and discoloration of the skin.    Which, like it or not, leaves shaving which does not damage the skin and does not cause the hair to grow more or coarser or faster. Best done with a men's-style electric razor, the best of which, for girls and women, are probably those from the men's range of Philips/Norelco razors (Philishave outside the US). Most girls and women who try a men's Philips/Norelco wonder why nobody ever told them about it before.
WMNbGsoWaa	It could just be when you are at school you are working, so your body is producing oil. Like if you were at an amusement park for a day, except school isn't as fun. You should put mostierizer on your skin whenever you get out of the shower, might help it not become so rough.   Keep wearing vaseline for your lips, I'm not really sure what could be wrong there.

I personally think you can.      Tips to prevent cold sores:  Avoid chocolate, stress, nuts, gelatine and other high arginine foods.  Take occasional Lysine.    Tips on dealing with a cold sore:  Take about 1000mgs of Lysine daily.    Immediately stop the above foods.  Throw out your toothbrush and start a new one.  Repeat after a week.  Dap tea tree oil on the sores.  Do not do this if the sore is inside your mouth only if it is outside.  Thursday's Plantation is a very good brand.    The best defense is a good offence.  As soon as the tingle starts change the toothbrush, stop the foods and start the Lysine and Tea Tree routine.  Really helps a lot|`|scMKVhiZaa	swoosh salt water in your mouth|`|spSKaJHaaa	i just thought first off that i would tell you some news because i learned something the other day at school Cold sores are caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1, a highly contagious virus that, once contracted, will stay in your nervous system forever,  (Herpes type 1 is not to be confused with herpes type 2, of the genital variety). Because of this, once you've had cold sores you can't stop recurrences for good.    but the good news is there is ways to get rid of them fast !  because hurpies is a bactereal deacese you can get rid of them with Pretty much anything anti bacterial like creams and even mouth wash :P hot soapy watter or anything works Newsprint cream works great also ! good luck :)|`|B97ayTJ3aa	I know, codlsores suck. I use Lysine too but I will take abour 6-8 of them as soon as i feel one coming on, also zovirax straight away.

Good luck|`|XEixfw02aa	For the last thing, herpes cannot travel through mouth. But for the cold sores the best thing you can do, and this may seem painful.. But you need to put salt on it..    It burns a little but the next day it will be gone for sure. You dont want to pop them because they will keep growing back and back... I learned that the hard way haha.|`|5ICkD8iJaa	abreva works really well. for me it dries it right up before it comes out.|`|mp8XgvFDaa	my friend had a tiny cold sore last night and it was about the size of an earring like you said.   she took some chapstick and put it on her lips for about an hour every 20 minutes while her mom was at the store getting her the chapstick to treat coldsores.    right before she went to bed she put on a VERY thick layer of cold sore chapstick stuff & by the time she woke up it was completely gone.|`|812acd570608b909be2a850fb734a285aa	Try Abreva. It's an OTC cream that comes in a tiny tube. It stops cold sores "in their tracks" as you wish would happen.    Also, it's a lot better to keep sores moisturized. The nail polish remover will irritate your skin and inflammation leads to complications. I stressed my skin when I had my first cold sore - now I have a small scar that slightly covers the outline of my lip. I wish I had known then to leave the sore alone. But seriously, if you hydrate it (try aloe vera), it should heal faster because the skin is healthier.    I don't think your boyfriend is causing your outbreaks. Usually if there's a drastic change in temperature or your body chemistry you are prone to an outbreak.|`|yTlZPmdjaa	Try & hold a pc. of Ice on it ! OR eat Yogurt ! -  You can also go to a GNC Store & they sell pills to take  to get rid of them !   GOOD LUCK !
oAyI70W5aa	electrolysis by far :)  this is what i got off a website:    Laser Hair Removal  Lasers work best on dark hair, light skin because the laser targets melanin which is found in dark hair. There are some lasers that now successfully remove blonde hairs, but from what I've read, they've not yet perfected them. If you have dark skin, beware also, because the laser will target the melanin in your skin as well, which can cause pigmentation problems.    The pain factor I've found lasers aren't as painful as waxing, but are more painful than depilatory creams or tweezing. I am going through laser hair removal on my legs right now (read all about it here) and it's working great. A pulsed light from the laser can feel like a rubber band snapping your skin. I recommend taking a couple Advil an hour before.    How much time, how much money? The good news is a laser session on the upper lip and chin is fast compared to the legs and bikini. Each session will take about 10 minutes. You'll need 5-6 treatments spaced four weeks apart. The bad news is laser hair removal is not affordable for everyone. Depending on where you live, each session can cost $150-$200.    To shave or not to shave? As for your concern about shaving, you may have to shave the area for a particular machine to work. But the good news is that all the hair falls out within 10-14 days. I have fast-growing leg hair, so when I get laser hair removal the hair grows in immediately per its usual tricks, but then it magically falls out (with a bit of exfoliating help on my part) within that magical 14-day period. Depending on how fast your hair grows, you might have a bit of coarseness for a few days, but it should all fall out.    And just so you know, shaving never makes hair grow back thicker. Virgin, never shaved hairs have fine, soft ends. Shaved ends are coarser. This is why the hair that grows back after you shave seems to be thicker.    Are results guaranteed? Results, unfortunately, are never guaranteed with laser hair removal. You can expect an 80% reduction in hair growth, but some people see more, some less. I have had great success with lasers, while a friend of mine turned to electrolysis because all his back hair grew back after his laser treatments.    Find a reputable aesthetician Beware the cheap places that offer discounts. You want to make sure you are going to a credible, licensed aesthetician who is most likely using the best, most up-to-date machines available. City Search has a salon section where users rate salons in cities.    Electrolysis  Electrolysis is a more guaranteed form of hair removal and works on dark AND light hair.    How it works The aesthetician inserts a sterile needle into every hair follicle. A low-level electrical current kills the follicle. Because electrolysis focuses on one hair at a time, it can be a tedious process, which makes it ideal for small areas like the brows, upper lip and chin.    The pain factor The pain from electrolysis is greater than laser and it may feel like 20 pricks to your one for laser hair removal. Cost is about $60 for a typical 30-minute session, but the con is you need about 15-30 visits to see the best results (ouch!)    Are results guaranteed? Yes. Unlike laser and pulsed lights, electrolysis kills every follicle the aesthetician treats.           answermineplease  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...
XEixfw02aa	Either go get some facewash, which is what most people do. Or if it is really serious your doctor can prescribe some antibacterial lotion to sooze the pores.

By the way "EMO" stands for emotional and yes they wear eyeliner and it as become a style but it started as meaning emotional and depressed and the people who are like this don't choose to be at all buy unfortuantly are i have many friendz who are and wish they could control there emotions well i hope this helps :-) o and yes skinny jeans should look good on you|`|e880bf3780c6ebc1868c580fec232f00aa	West 49  or something    why would you wanna look lyk a depressed weirdo that not alot of boys like..

sHUnctqIaa	Mascara throw out after 6 months, I toss mine after 3 if I somehow don't use it by then, as it can get dry.     Powder blush toss after a year, liquid or cream blush toss after 9 months and mineral powder blush you can hold onto for about 18 months.     Eyeliner sticks or pencils need to go after 6 months, powder can last up to a year, liquid needs to go after 6.     Anything that is liquid can go rancid as well as get contaminated with Bacteria. Anything that you put near you eye needs to be kept clean and replaced often, as eye's can be sensitive and infections can be painful and lead to vision problems.     For foundation and concealer, I toss liquids after 6 months, If it's powder I will keep it a little longer, but again most people will have used it all by then.|`|eocYAzeraa	mascara- 3 months  blush, powder, eye shadow-1 year  eyeliner-6 months|`|CPZe3g74aa	every 6 months|`|uy6sBhipaa	You should 'run out' before you have to 'throw out.' Actually, every three of four days you should change one of the 3 to a tone lighter or darker and see who notices. You should even chart it for your own info. It will also teach you how to accent your eye color and focus attention to where you want it to be.  8~)|`|MiyuKZ7vaa	never keep eye makeup for more then 3 months.  the ingredients start to turn(mold because of the air) and may cause infection  for blush, foundation... i believe if its a good make; it can last until you finish it.   watch out of expiry dates|`|mhyL7Qw3aa	Mascara is only good for two to four months. A good way to find out if your mascara is old is if it dries out and the smell changes.  Blush lasts two years before it is considered old but I would recommend changing it
lPCjNkEnaa	Shea, 16.     I wear makeup because I feel insecure about the flaws in my face and it helps hide them. It's also kind of fun to put on.|`|wzM5WB8Xaa	Shannon, 25    I wear make-up because I feel that it makes me look better and more presentable. Also, I have found that when I don't, a lot of my coworkers and friends tend to ask me if I'm sick or tired, so I guess it's to avoid people thinking that there is something wrong with me and bugging me about it.|`|9UgGwvtlaa	EASY    makeup is an art!! whether its dramatic  or the pin up look or smoky eye..makeup enhances ur already beautiful features!!

I think makeup allows you to have different looks and styles and gives your face a new look. There is so much make up out there to choose from and it can make you real pretty or just update your look  : )|`|rHAiO9Ghaa	Phoebe, 19.    I see make up as an art, and I wear it and encourage other people to wear it not as a mask, but as a confidence boost. Most woman, when wearing makeup feel more confident in there self and feel beautiful. Where some women have that confidence without makeup, but someone dont and I think make-up answers there problems partially.|`|kfrWN7wQaa	I wear makeup to express myself. It shouldn't be about impressing people and it shouldn't be because you feel you aren't pretty without it. Makeup is fun. Its like painting a picture of how you feel that day. Light and carefree, or beautiful and sexy, dark and mysterious, or classic and polished. It makes you feel good.|`|H82ghmAvaa	My name is Ann, and I'm 19.    I wear makeup because it makes me feel good about myself, and less self conscious.

I also really like to experiment with different looks and colour combinations.  Hope this helps, good luck with your project!!|`|aHyhzIGUaa	My name is Courtney and I am 12.

Flrnnme1aa	I recommend posting this on a tutorial depending on the extent of the bags and you can line with light shimmery colors but again without seeing you I can not give you a real answer.    Ask:    Sara Victor Tutorial on youtube she is in my opinion the best one I have viewed.    She is more talented than  Makeupgeek or Panacea|`|M8iaO8hjaa	Why would you have luggage hanging from your eyes? That'd really weigh 'em down!|`|6mBrJ2EGaa	NO!|`|mEibZRVfaa	it looks better if u remove ya eye bags den puttin eye makeup on|`|pFS2LZGKaa	you'll look extra tired, you should use a light color eyeliner and a concealer to hide your bags|`|P2jGH61kaa	No. If you have bags under you're eyes you should try concealer  to cover up the bags then you should apply eyeliner after wards.

iQPGdEdiaa	just keep it clean you dont need to take it out unless it gets bad my piercings have been affected alot of times and i never took them out i just make sure they were clean untill they got better eventually your piercings will get better.|`|dHkvVlONaa	The only thing you can do is keep it clean and keep doing the sea salt soaks and hope for the best.    You could also go to where ever you got it pierced and see what they say.    But if it is infected, do not take it out because then you will just trap the infection inside.    The best thing you could do at this point, is go to a piercer.|`|hLu2j6IMaa	Keep doing what ur doing. It you don't see results within a couple days, go see the Dr. and get some pills for infection. It should clear it up.|`|WR9NuZFiaa	Don't use Listerine. Listerine is very harsh on piercings. My advise is to make sure its clean at least 4 times a day and after you eat,smoke. Try picking up a bottle of H2ocean mouth wash. It's specifically made for mouth piercings and is very effective and safe. You can find it in most tattoo and piercings places, and i think hot topic and stores like it sell them.|`|DtP7rwenaa	There's no reason to take it out.Keep sea salt water but also apply some antibacterial cream from a pharmacy 4-5 times a day and you'll be fine!Take care.=]

When you go to your hair stylist tell them you want one of those two used on your hair.

jo7knixpaa	I have an inverted bob and absolutely love it!  I don't have to worry about doing the back of my hair, because it's short and basically does what its supposed to!  Its very versatile too - you can poof it up, and make it fancy, or straighten it and it still looks good!    Here's a few links to Victoria Beckham style (that's kind of what I tried to base my hair off of) -  you can also Google "Victoria Beckham hair" and you'll get plenty of pictures!    http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u284/...    http://discoveringhair.com/blog/posh_for...|`|4bH6L9JSaa	it wudnt let me open up the hairstyle u luv. but i like the one which is similar to the one u got now. its cute :)|`|7nrhPCf0aa	fix the 2nd link|`|9AUmp5jWaa	The second link doesn't work.|`|byHh0A3Eaa	no please for the love of god no, short hair is only for old women|`|AA12234326	you would look sensational sweetheart.That is one of the sexiest cuts ever fashioned.Go to youtube.com and search bob cut for nataly or nomad cut there are hundreds of videos to watch the cut being done.Good luck.

cR8UZdi1aa	First wipe at least about 4 lbs of that make up. Then stop trying to be all sexy myspace tacky, & then stop trying to ask people "am I pretty" in different ways like this, THEN it'll look much better!|`|AA10513992	More natural would look nicer, there is too much air brushing/blurring and I think the lighting is a little milky/washed out, could do with maybe more contrast. You look like you'd be pretty enough without any editing, but if you do want to edit then just take out small imperfections like if you have a blemish, or 5 pimples.. just heal brush those and leave the fine lines and pores etc alone. You have a nice facial structure, try to keep the editing minimal =)|`|3OTE1t5eaa	It looks like it would have been fine the way is was but currently it's just wayyyy to overedited. Remember less is more :)|`|wh3VE5pQaa	it looks like you crossed the line when you messed around with it  doesn't look real|`|pFS2LZGKaa	You don't look human|`|AA12370001	its edited too much.  Its obvious its fake.|`|iuQ2DBoyaa	it is interesting! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Ugh, it looks so fake.. I get that people want to enhance their photos but why even bother taking them if you're going to try to make yourself look perfect? Nobody is perfect.|`|K2Hbl6Xmaa	It already looks crap cos it looks fake. It stands out as a crap editing job|`|PGRacfmdaa	...lol|`|wv5PiHxcaa	well i can tell that you've blurred a lot of your face and the eyes look way too edited.  It doesn't look natural at all.  The only thing you can do is upload a new pic of this and keep it the way it is.  plus why would you want to edit yourself?  you are a beautiful person.|`|nwe4mWBaaa	I agree with the first person who answered.|`|7TuMvfraaa	it looks way too fake and plastic|`|2DK4QoV9aa	too much makeup she should take annother pic it really does look fake|`|DySUxIn4aa	It already looks fake enough.|`|teETSGmNaa	fakeeeeee|`|7nrhPCf0aa	the person in it is creepy|`|tbdyeIagaa	go back to the original  if the original's bad take another pic|`|YQQoHI5Haa	There's nothing wrong with it's. It your picture, you can do whatever you want with it. The only thing is, it doesn't look real at all. It looks really cool but it doesn't look real, and I think that's maybe why someone would say there's something wrong with it. I like it though :) I edit a lot of my pictures, nothing wrong with it:)|`|xdyM3IVmaa	Major problems: it's REALLY dark. There's no contrast whatsoever... and you airbrushed it far too much. Just looks tacky. Cleaning up a couple blemishes or bringing out eyes is one thing... but going overboard like that just doesn't look good at all.     You don't want to edit it any more. lol.   Go back to the original and tone down the airbrush/blur and lighten up the image a bit and play with the contrast.|`|HDq1K2szaa	It looks very photoshopped..too much softened and yet your makeup looks hard compared to the rest. Your face is also a different colour then your neck. If you just had the original picture we could then compare, and I'm guessing it looks better than the one you have.|`|r2GizSVgaa	You edited it way too much and it looks fake. Take another pic or just erase what you did with the current one.|`|KgwHBGg3aa	it looks like you added some makeup and that looks reaally fake ..the original prolly looks much better..if you want to edit pics and still look natural try   http://www.picnik.com/|`|hPoXUHGhaa	i think it looks cute, it does look very edited though,  i would say go back to the original and keep editing it and messing round and save multiple copys.  then choose your fav :), or put a question on yahoo asnwers asking which is better.|`|Ppz64oxQaa	Nothing, it's gorgeous.
ALh5R37jaa	that dress is absolutely adorable, i love it.  The only exception is that prom dresses are usually long and formal looking, this dress is more like a sweet 16 dress than a prom dress, but other then that, i think it's very pretty :)|`|KFwXBXv7aa	really pretty|`|qog0Yd72aa	Woah,  i LOVE it!!!  itss sooo cuteee!!!  I love how sparkly and girliee it is!!!  adorablee!!  have fun at prom!!  |`|1pUIwBM1aa	The style is nice but it looks a little cheesey.|`|rEBdSRrHaa	It is really pretty!    (:|`|pC2jGRKraa	Sorry to dampen your enthusiasm, but I have to say that sophisticated and that dress do not really come up in the same book, let alone sentence. When I look at the dress, the model, the hair, I automatically think 1980s, and thats well...bad.    Also for that price, its kinda taking the piss, you can get a lot more dress for that kinda money. Go look in the big department stores, like Debenhams or John Lewis. You also should try some charity shops, and pick up a beautiful designer dress there.|`|yuHV59Yhaa	Ooo it's cute!|`|TGIWInvDaa	Aww, its really beautiful =]     you'll look really pretty =]|`|7KDL9Wo3aa	It's cute!

MePCnsaYaa	If you dye it your natural colour, it will be fine, but you may need two lotts because the brown will fade and the highlights will show through.  You can go back to your hairdressers and get a solid colour dye or if you can remember your shade (it will be a number like 5 or 6 or something with a letter) then you could do the cheaper option of buying a DIY dye kit.|`|TBRMH4hbaa	Buy a shade lighter then the color brown you want to dye it, and dye it twice.|`|tmckNa4baa	wat highlights did u get 5 weeks ago? It depends if it would go to ginger depending on ur highlights.|`|ErvhPYlbaa	If you're going from a light blonde to a neutral dark color, it will most likely have a nasty green tinge to it.  Make sure you're adding something with a warm (reddish) base... but don't use red... that'd go bright pink.  Use a brown with warmth in it!
oUV9ZUsEaa	why are you're eyebrow hairs shorter than the rest of your hair? it's just how the body works. some hair grows slower and thinner.|`|AA11156937	Well mine is longer in the neck area.   Unless you are talking about baby hair.
875db9dbe2ce224475dab7f10775abccaa	yeah. Be sure to unplug anything that isn't in use. Phone chargers, hair dryers, etc.|`|wqchA8B7aa	Depends. If it's a transformer, then yes. If it's a light, then no.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	yes it does
fdd6a2ecb553199d0f61700e6c821243aa	Michael Kors all the way.  Dooney and B is like the new  Louis Vuitt.  All their stuff is crappy and has monograms all over it which is so 2005. Plus there are so many fakes being circulated so everyone automatically  assumes that you have a fake. Michael Kors is classy and well built.|`|q7i9QZg5aa	Michael Kors! Ill pick one up out of the "feel" test only. Compared to DB bags they have a much more expensive feel to them. They are also more on the cutting edge of style compared to DB bags. I love the Kors bags as they scream luxury style yet in a sophisticated way.|`|pWxh08O9aa	I love them both!
sHUnctqIaa	If your going to an experienced professional then your already going to be in better shape than your at home waxing experience.   For the least painful experience, make sure the hair is no longer than an inch and no shorter than 1/4 inch. About 30 minutes before your appointment, take an advil or Tylenol to help with the pain. There are 2 wonderful products you may also want to look into. One is called no scream cream and can be found in most waxing spa's, you apply it about 30 minutes before your appointment and it numbs the area. You may also want to look into Tend skin or No Bump which are products you use before and after your wax to prevent in-grown hairs. The best part about waxing is that the more you have it done the easier it will be, and quite honestly it doesn't hurt as much as people say. Just breath and relax :)|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	it does nor hurt that much as they say ,|`|U7oJrc3faa	It doesn't hurt that bad, lol.|`|KgwHBGg3aa	YESSS it hurts i say just do it yrself buy the sally hansen wax strips and cut them into smaller pieces|`|DtP7rwenaa	LOL good luck my friend..I did the whole area once with wax and since then I do it only with razor !!!!..However..If you are going to do it..Wait at least a week after your period [it's less painful]..and trim it a bit.lol.|`|MX3wOs1vaa	Make sure you trim the hair.  The longer the hair is, the more painful it is.  Do not wax it yourself, get it done.  THe reason being is because your hair grows in different directions (upwards, downwards etc).  You have to be able to apply the wax in the direction of the hair growth and then pull against the hair growth.  You cannot possibly see all the way down there unless you have the longest neck on the planet LOL.  If you start waxing it yourself and apply wax the wrong way, etc. you can start to get ingrown hairs which are so nasty and can hurt.  Good luck!|`|ygTr3fvVaa	First time waxing can be a little bit painful. Make sure the person who's doing it is experienced, you wouldn't want her to burn you with the hot wax.
fMLBPUVeaa	ooh, walmart has the cheapest i've seen, but out of your choices i'd say rite aid or k mart. good luck!!|`|AA11156937	Wal-mart|`|pVUhlg4iaa	drug stores like walgreens and cvs have sales like if they put all products from a certain brand u can get a good deal on lots of stuff|`|BnofXJbOaa	Check out Rite-Aid, they have awesome cosmetics. K-mart is exceptional as well, you could try there. Walgreens, definitely.|`|62b4d7610d61a9537e22693aedeb72b9aa	wal mart for sure.  drug stores tend to up the price just a few bucks.|`|GOsRusM9aa	Probably Wal-Mart.|`|FqiX1Gnmaa	i would have to say walmart even though its not on ur list  cvs
jSjb5DUeaa	lol. is it? i don't know. never saw it before. u could be the 1st one. try it, and if it doesn't look good just go back to shaving :)|`|ciKgkwLtaa	yeah it'd look rad.  :)|`|QvUpUNzDaa	yea.  it may just be harder.  alot of straightning unless u wanna spend 300+ on getting a straightning perm or w/e.|`|4YZBPfhRaa	haha! do it, you'd be sooo much cooler.|`|BZewDqNMaa	First of all you don't have to be one thing becasue your black and not another because your black. So you shouldnt even be questioning if the color of your skin will have affect on what hair style you get. But to answer your question I will have to say no! Not because black and emo don't mix but because emo hair is just terrible all around. If you want to try something new and unique there are plenty of other hair styles out there. Be one of a kind! I hate it when people think they are rebellious and differant because they are emo or scene! WAKE UP PEOPLE almost everyone these days have emo hair and outfits!|`|qUiXiZ6aaa	i will have to say HELL NO. black guys, emo hair, big fashion no no no no NO boo-boo!!! plus you will have to straighten your hair and once you straighten you hair it will NEVER be the same AGAIN!!! DON'T PUT STUFF IN YOUR HAIR BOO-BOO!!|`|N1LYWbHFaa	ooh you should do it
uiGVViTJaa	I completely agree with you. It's absolutely ridiculous how all of these teenagers wear t-shirts with "ABERCROMBIE" written all over it, claiming it's "cute." personally, i don't see what's so cute about writing. these people are obviously just trying to fit in...it's sad, actually. i hate when people say "I'm not trying to fit in, it's good quality!" what a load of bull. tackiness and conformity are among my pet peeves.|`|RicENLBsaa	i do and most of the time it is almost the exact same thing.|`|KQjBLyU3aa	I totally agree! I don't get why so many people love wearing overpriced clothes that are just shirts with gigantic logos printed across. Is it the quality or something? I have no idea.|`|Ww2KnsvKaa	I dont think its tacky. I love american eagle, hollister and aeropostale and i like that they display the names and different sayings on them. I think its stylish and its whats in.|`|jcVJM8FNaa	I agree! That's why I love Hollister and Abercrombie...their way of endorsing the product, WHILE people are wearing it is pretty "genius" lol.|`|dTFafcweaa	I like wearing hollister it describes who I am|`|ZQWEgFZ2aa	It's true that they have their logo on everything. The only way of advertising their stuff is having people wear them and a logo on everything. If you've noticed they don't have ads or commercials. They're relying on their employees and customers to get the brand out there and it's working because a lot of people wear Hollister.
yzxxYlPyaa	I think you are obsessed with shaving your head. Just do it and stop talking about it please !!!|`|O24FewSQaa	that is a realllllllly weird thing to do. i know if any guy ever asked me that he would never have a chance with me again because that would be such a turn off and I would think he was a crepper. and honestly, then I would go make fun of you with my friend - which is probably the same thing she would do.

SHE JUST HAS LOW SELF ESTEEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|uKpWUPEUaa	well on some people it works but you'd probably like it more if you changed it up a little  I don't really know what to suggest without a picture but yea  alot of people are doing the side bang thing  I have that and my hair is brushed back so I don't really have a part in my hair|`|CJ3OsEO9aa	It's not exactly ugly.  It just sounds pretty boring. (not trying to offend)  i can't really say though. it might really suit you.  if i was you i would get some layers cut into my hair and maybe some form of bangs? and get a few highlights put in.  that would look super:p|`|nuISzHFRaa	It is not ugly, however parting down the middle just cuts your face in half, like drawing a line straight down the middle, I would part it off to the side just slightly. Or you could even part it like this:    http://blstb.msn.com/i/C3/B792C566F1BB11...    it is parted off to the side, so it gives her hair more of a stylish look without having to get a special cut|`|xRd6Nxdvaa	umm if you think its boring then maybe you should try something new.  out with the old sistah!!!  oh and i wouldnt have put pics up either because im scared also!  DaNiElLe!|`|v2rhWswRaa	not nessicarly ugly, but boring for sure. i would say get some layers added to it, it will really give your hair movement and a little more personality. I used to have hair like yours and it made a big difference.|`|rLvJpWivaa	Maybe you could get some layers cut in for volume & face framing.  That would really give you some style & a different look.  You can get ideas from hair style magazines or even just any magazine.  It isn't that your hair is boring, but it sounds as though you are ready for a change.  If you have a natural wave in your hair, a cut would really encourage that wave even further.  Some salons have computer imaging where they superimpose your face on different hairstyles.  This would give you a lot of ideas without cutting a thing.  Or you could take a little photo of your head-shot & put it on different hairdos for ideas.

4kk0HaAZaa	I'm glad to read that you aren't going to a UV-tanning booth. You may think it's the quick fix to snag a golden glow, but the risk of cancer and premature aging is not worth it.     The safe alternative, of course, is self-tanning. But as demonstrated by Anne Hathaway in Bride Wars, too much isn't a good thing. I spoke with Mystic Tan creator, Ricky Croft, to get some tips for applying self-tanner AND below I have given you the link to our page of consumer reviews of self-tanning products.  Here are Ricky's tips:    ? Gradually build up to the golden shade you desire. Start a few weeks prior to the big event, and then assess your color after a few applications. Once you get to the level you want, maintain it for the days leading up to the big day with follow-up applications every other day. This method lends itself to a less drastic, more even glow.    ? Be sure to apply a petroleum-based product to cuticles and nail beds before applying any self-tanner. This will help you avoid orange cuticles or ruining your manicure.     ? Shave the night before. Exfoliate in the shower prior to use--but don't apply lotion: skin must be clean!    ? Use sparingly around rough and dry areas such as knees, elbows and ankles as these areas tend to darken more quickly.    and, here's the link:    http://www.dailymakeover.com/products?sh...    Hope I helped!  Rachel Hayes, Editorial Director of Daily Makeover
AA10261043	Try Roc Deep wrinkle night cream.  After about a month of using it, my Mom and sister asked what I was using because my skin looked so youthful.  My sister said that she was happy I found something because I was starting to look wrinkley!   Needless to say, they both ran out and bought some.     I'm 41 and I stopped tanning beds about 2 years ago.  Anyways, I've been useing it for about 5 months, and I'm hooked!!   When I zoom in on pictures of myself, I'm amazed at the difference.   I tried Retin A before this for about 7 months, and I really didn't notice a difference...it actually made the fine lines under my eyes more prominent!  I've also tried Neutrogena, at the advice of my derm, and I didn't care for that either.    Try it for a month, you won't be dissappointed!|`|vxEDtriRaa	Hmmm, I don't know what ingredients are in it to be honest, but I have used Oil of Olay since I was twelve. I'm 32 now. I just recently switched from the original to the "age defying" and it seems to be doing it's job.
ZyQFd6NVaa	The Perfect Blowout: After washing your hair, rinse it with cool water to add shine and reduce frizz. Do this before you blow-dry to get your best perfectly smooth look!    Apply a quarter-size amount of thick anti-frizz serum to towel-dried hair to keep your strands smooth. Rub the serum over your hands, then run your fingers through your hair from roots to ends.    Blow-dry hair on high heat starting with a three-inch-wide section in front. Use a round brush with holes in it so the heat can reach all your strands. Aim the dryer directly at the round brush, first from above and then from below.    Roll each section under a Velcro roller after blow-drying it (while it's still warm). As you dry the rest of your hair, this will prevent it from getting messy and blown around. Velcro rollers also add body and bounce.    Remove the rollers when all your hair is totally cooled. Finish by evenly misting your entire head with an aerosol hairspray from 10 inches away. This seals the hair shaft, so it stays smooth and frizz-free the entire day.|`|PyUDK9IGaa	baldcap?|`|F5R3TJEQaa	frizz it|`|8ph53q0Qaa	who cares
JyAUAbsjaa	sure, go for it. The good news is if you don't like them, they will always grow back....|`|KcRCQst5aa	i look exactly like that. don't. i tried and it doesn't look good.
sHUnctqIaa	Witch Hazel or Hammamilis is an effective anti-bacterial toner for acne. It's good in that it will kill surface bacteria and speed up healing. It's not a cure or treatment for acne, but rather is meant to be used as part of your skin care routine. I use it after I cleanse my face and during extractions as well.

Vpk1nP7gaa	nah..those are made in Indonesia|`|BhEVhdvDaa	I looked at the first four and saw a trend going there...I really like number 3 but they are wayyy to expensive for just one shirt? Forget it! You're paying for the label....so stupid and wasteful! They're just plain jane, nothing special about them worthy of $60!
ALh5R37jaa	that's definitely not real, they don't use normal t-shirts before making it into their brand.  sorry|`|fvuEtkROaa	If you like it, wear it.  The tag is not that important.|`|KgwHBGg3aa	why would you buy anything form yr friends in the first place she prolly sewed it on herself|`|nJeLOoUIaa	uh i dont think they make fake thingss  just ask your friend if it bothers you that much.|`|zV3W4wanaa	who cares if abercrombie and fitch is fake? its not even a high quality store.

BTW your really pretty :)|`|nwe4mWBaaa	Yeah.|`|1pUIwBM1aa	I've come to the realization that ANYONE looks good with a lip piercing, so go for it.|`|6nW0eSQ7aa	yes definatly on your left =]|`|EgbIYBehaa	Sure why not. it would suit the whole emo kid thing ya got going on there!  Good luck x|`|AZRj3vaLaa	i think you would look good with a nose ring!!! do you have one already? but i dont know about a lip ring...|`|7PbJWEo1aa	You're pretty enough already without shoving a piece of metal through your face.    Think of employers in the future and how it will look when you are older.     Plus it makes your teeth move!|`|OFCCgLdKaa	You don't suit the red hair, that'd look better dark brown. As for the piercing, I'm not really one for piercings altogether so I don't know.|`|czAbrzcUaa	Yeah, you'd suit a lip ring (: Don't have a stud though, it looks a bit chavvy..  I like your hair by the way!|`|s0XR8cxLaa	hellz yea no doubt|`|DtP7rwenaa	hehe Cute face.I think you 'll look better with an eyebrow piercing:)|`|GKJEgidzaa	Yes, why not, you already look like a scene sheep, why not make the cliche complete.

Piercings are often used to draw attention away from defects, you don't have any defects to draw attention from.Maybe go for something subtle like a Monroe.|`|f733aad13bfa9c4b491711f02da899a3aa	I don't know what it is called but the little stud in the top lip would look nice in my opinion. It is cute and girly, I think that labret and bottom lip piercings are more masculine. I don't' know about moving your teeth but I have heard they can wear on the enamel of your teeth. Don't worry about future employment, piercings leave small pin hole scars, they are more temporary than tattoos so not much of an effect on your future.|`|XENlOwiVaa	I don't like lip jewelry too much.  I always have the feeling that its dirty.  You know, saliva and food in the pierced hole.    I see you more with a pixie haircut, a tatoo wrapping from the middle of your shoulders on your back, splitting and wrapping around down both your upper outer thighs, ending just inside your thigh by your knees.  Something like druid artwork.    Then to show off the tatoo, any combination of the following:    low cut in the back (see-thru panel) top  a shirt with a see-through left side  skirt with side slit  midrif shirt with netting around the abdomen  ...    anything that shows off the tatoo    Can you tell, I like tatoos.  But I don't like lip jewelry much.    Where large tatoos are alive with any movement, lip jewelry never really seems to fit into someone's persona.    Very pretty by the way.|`|OfUje9r8aa	yeah u would uv got that look bout u!|`|3y8YIs3raa	yeah go for it good luck :]|`|7cQwvbPBaa	yea u would totally suit it    ps lv the hair its ace|`|Lg3SNqW2aa	Make sure you really want one before you do it, I've had serveral piercings in the last 5 years and I don't wear hardly any of them anymore, they get a little tiring and you're left with holes/scars on your skin where it was actually pierced that take a long, long time to fully heal and fade.    Are you willing to wear a whole lot of foundation to hide the scars or have a holey face?   On the plus side, I'd say it's worth it!

There are a lot of different types of goth now, anyway. Look around and find one you like. The thing about goth is, it's rather anti-mainstream, so a 'cool' goth is sort of an oxymoron. :P    Edit: May I just point out that dressing all in black is not a requirement. The music you listen to is more important than what you look like, really.|`|W1vdfn1yaa	goths suck

dHkvVlONaa	I did my own lip piercing (snakebites) and they healed up fine.    I suppose that is because leading up to the big day, I did tons of research on the web.  I mean like, at least 100 hours of doing everything from watching vids of lip piercings on youtube, to reading peoples stories about their lip piercing experiences.    A site that really helped me was www.bmezine.com  They have tons of stories of DIY and Pro done piercings.  Just read up on those, see what worked for them, and what didn't work.  Learn from their mistakes.    Also, use proper equipment.  You can buy clamps and hollow needles from this site-  painfulpleasures.com just click on the blue retail button towards the top.  This site is pretty cheap, and has fast shipping too. I use it all the time.    Good luck :)    *edit- and mine swelled just a little bit, but went down after about a day.|`|W1vdfn1yaa	clean it  it swells even if its done by a pro|`|pl96lkzIaa	Don't do it.  It's really risky and you could end up with permanent scaring.  There's no way to get your lip pierced and not have your parents see it, because you can't take the ring out until it heals.  It's just not worth the risk of doing it yourself, and your parents will find out.  My advice is to wait until you're old enough to get it done without their permission.

I also suggest going to The Bay in a larger city, such as Toronto or Vancouver, since they tend to have the better things in those areas. Try The Bay Yorkdale or the Eaton Center.    You could also try out BCBG Max Azria at Yorkdale mall, they have beautiful dresses too, although more pricey.     Best of luck!|`|lGclixPuaa	Macy's. Bloomingdale's. Victoria's Secret.

Be proud of your curves!|`|J78SRCe5aa	Your waist and hip measurements answer the question. Curviness is usually in bone structure. And a lot of model's just happen to have.. um, non-curvy bone structure. As far as I know, weight doesn't change your body structure.    PS: Just because you're curvy doesn't mean you're a monster.|`|Iclu3QNEaa	Yupp, and also, post a picture of yourself, can't really tell unless I see a picture.|`|B06MKPbfaa	i m  sure you weight fine curvy is just how your build  losing weight won't make the curves smaller women are supposed to have curves. your not supposed to have a models body there not healthy looking they look more like they a child's body there pretty but  normal people don't look like that.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I don't know how you can look like a monster with a figure like that. That sounds like the type of body most men love    Also, you have to remember that 36" hips look different on someone who is 6' vs someone who is 5'6". And most models' hips are 33-35", not 36"|`|H8sJnsxJaa	most high fashion models are more around the 5'10 range and 4 inches is a HUGE deal. Also, the biggest factor is fat to muscle ratio. If someone is made up of more lean tissue than fat, they might look far thinner than you although you could weigh less. also, what about your actual frame? High fashion models have very small  bones and long, waif-like limbs. If a person has thicker legs, thighs, calves, arms, etc then this makes for a huge difference. Lastly, bust size! a large Bust size and chest measurement on a smaller frame makes a huge difference. The "ideal" runway model measurements are 33-23-34 and around 5'10 but up to 6ft.. This is an hourglass figure, despite the extreme thinness. If your chest is closer to your waist size, then you are more of a pear shape, another factor that would make you look curvier. But listen, as someone who has  done high fashion runway modeling in her teenage years (I'm now retired at the ripe age of 20 because most of us cannot naturally maintain that shape  after teenage years) let me tell you that we are genetic freak of natures, and not the ideal. The days of the traditional sexy model like Cindy Crawford are long gone because the attention is supposed to be on the clothes and  not us. That's why models are now referred to as walking hangers. We're interchangeable and faceless. You sound like you have a great figure and I wouldn't sweat it! Why do you think pornstars (supposedly the male fantasy) look so different than fashion models?|`|htBxuF28aa	beacuse your short with wide hips   n you can be hot and curvy u just gotta be really toned    im curvy but toned i love it i wouldnt swap my figure to be a model ...ever  c36-w20-hip31
