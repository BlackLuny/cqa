6u2YkXjlaa	I think it is attacked to try and pull the real focus of where steroids are really being used because it's always the government funded sports that have the highest drug use (over pro wrestling) but pro wrestling always is looked down on when they have a minimal amount of usage|`|7qczKTv3aa	Pro Wrestling is attacked more than baseball? Baseball players were required to testify in front of the United States Congress about their suspected steroid use. Some players are potentially facing jail time (for perjury when questioned in front of grand jury about these allegations).     BTW...where are your stats from??? The Mitchell Report cited only 120 cases of players LINKED to steroids and/or Human Growth Hormones.  Not all of these players tested positive or admitting to using steroids.    Your stats seem to be unbelievably inaccurate.  Please start listing sources or something.|`|lCzBONU1aa	I personally have no ethical problem with bodybuilders, gym enthusiasts, or wrestlers using steroids.  If a fat woman can go to the doctor and get on phintermine, which has pretty rough side effects, to improve the way she looks, why shouldn't a man be able to use testosterone to bulk up for show?  It's the same thing.    Can someone please tell me the difference between a woman getting breast implants before a beauty contest and a man bulking up with testosterone before a body building contest?  The only difference I can think of is the risk for cosmetic surgery is much higher!    I know it's a different argument when people who play competitive sports use them and get the advantage against opponents who are unable to take them.  As far as that goes, I think we should have steroid leagues and non steroid leagues.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	they aren't the only ones doing illegal drugs such as steroids. but it is pretty obvious, and look at all the fan favorites that keep dying from it.|`|rH3ylNuYaa	were is the proof about the NFL and baseball statistics? and a 128   Im pretty sure about 90 percent of all wrestlers use steroids , that's what konnan estimated throughout his career, even rey mysterio tested positive and I can break him in half  , look at all the deaths in wrestling compared to baseball and nfl , I think 6000 and 9000 is a insane number when all those football players and baseball players are alive and the wrestlers are dying.|`|858d08a7d3404cbc470e941ed130ef5aaa	Jim Hellwig (Ultimate Warrior) testified under oath that 90% of the WWF locker room used steroids.  Long term steroid use was listed as a contributing cause of death of Curt Hennig, Eddie Guerrero and Davey Boy Smith.  When Benoit died he had enough testosterone in his body to give a blue whale abs.  It came out in court that McMahon himself used them for years.  Lex Luger was arrested in 2003 with a huge stockpile of drugs which included steroids that were illegal even with a prescription.  A few years ago Kurt Angle was revealed as using steroids meant to be used for livestock(!)      Anyway I don't have all day to list this stuff, but you get the idea.  It's not exactly unfair that wrestling gets fingered as having a problem.  Although certainly plenty of other people use roids as well.
akpe0bTBaa	I totally agree how can you spend 20 million pounds on a player and play him in so little games. Also how can rafa the gaffer say he wants more control in transfers when he blows money like this. Selling him on deadline day means no time to buy a replacemnt so if torres gets injured we have no one apart from gerrard who can put the ball in the net.      Lets Hope torres stays fit.    YNWA|`|jiFHJ6daaa	should leave useless things|`|LdJFFvSVaa	What a loan, great piece of business for Spurs! LMAO!
5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	wait tilll "the problem" answers this... he thinks keane was sh!t.... He is happier that you have no backup rather than keane.... cant understand it.... oh well... watch the goals come a flying for Spurs|`|cOPCNP7Laa	I don't think he was as great as you said.    I do think he should have stayed at Liverpool but ONLY due to lack of other options in attack should Torres be injured, carded, or unavailable, etc|`|p8lB73rdaa	Didn't want him in the first place but he was never given a chance and I'm disgusted with the way he was treated .   We play spurs on the last day of the season.  I hope the decision to sell him doesn't come back to haunt us !|`|bh8krNd6aa	i don't think so because Keane is the good player of Liverpool .....|`|nJ5kceMBaa	I disagree completely. Serious question: Can you name one benefit of having Robbie Keane in the Liverpool team? I can't. He was absolutely awful. Take his name and his transfer fee away, and you would be wondering what the hell he was doing in the squad.
GcviIy5uaa	fa ridere i polli|`|nJ5kceMBaa	I've seen a decent amount of him, and he seems like another version of Cristiano Ronaldo - arrogant, bad attitude, and full of pointless tricks and flicks that get him nowhere. But he's highly rated by most.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Whats your Source???? No where in England has confirmed it...      Edit... ok its been confirmed...

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	For sure that match was pretty unimpressive, but i think JBL did his best to work a decent match and carry Cena who still remains a limited and predictable wrestler.If Cena could vary his moveset and work a more interesting or impressive style, his matches would be way more entertaining.The worst match i've seen recently was Khali vs The Highlanders back in February 2007 on Raw in a quick squash unimpressive match that was a complete waste of time.|`|rH3ylNuYaa	I know WWE has horrible matches , but don't talk about WCW like that they had great matches , if I was to chose between WWE now or matches from WCW I would definately pick WCW back with DDP, Booker T, Big poppa pump, and the whole NWO thing was great, but WCW died thanks to TBS's new owner who hated wrestling and decided to sell it and Vince jumped on the deal and Vince keeps bragging on how he won, it was all the owner of TBS's fault that Vince won.|`|n55Vb81Faa	CHAVO GUERRERO VS KANE WM 24 Was worse than Cena vs jbl|`|r2MfXmkqaa	nah, mark henry vs. kane|`|MttuYrrTaa	Yea it was kinda stupid but thats all business.

21J0IIZbaa	Durant will be a superstar in the NBA for many years.|`|AA11488609	Sell.  Durant is LeBron James without court vision and no strength whatsoever.  The dude needs to gain 20 pounds to be a formidable SF all around or he'll continue to be pushed around by every forward and even most NBA guards.  Most point guards can post up and push this guy around like a twig,  I can see Steve Nash and Chris Paul banging his little body in the post and get an easy shot at the hoop..  Even Andray Blatche can post up this guy with success.    If Durant went for another two years at Texas, he would've been forced to put on the pounds, and he should be a force.  Otherwise, he's another Tayshaun Prince, with all of his abilities put into offense rather than Defense.|`|OsWlVzrHaa	In a few years hell yeah i buy it hes a beast. he needs to go to a better team or make his better though, thats what bron bron and kobe do.|`|AQmcZ0gYaa	Sell, great player, but the future, no i dont think so|`|pHacyTFhaa	Kevin Durant has shown that he's an amazing ball-player.  At the very least he'll be like Carmelo Anthony, a scorer, at best, he can improve his game to someone who can really be a floor leader and take over games.  I'd buy.|`|7t7XzXsVaa	sell he's in a sucky team which is why he averages great points
126986d456c7650b3fab46b5cfe905a1aa	I'll tell you what, every team needs a hustle guy, and I think we have one of the top 2 or 3 in Ariza. But hustle guys are role players and he plays his role very well. But as far as being 2nd best, no way. I think everyone would agree it's either Bynum or Gasol who's second best, I personally think it's Bynum. After Bynum I think it's Fisher then Gasol. After that, Odom and Ariza, Farmar, Vujacic and Radmonavic.    BUT in terms of importance Ariza is huge. Everyone talks about "if we had Bynum we'd've beat Boston in the Finals" well don't forget, Ariza wasn't at 100%. If we had his energy and defense and rebounding, we might've pulled it off without Bynum. You can't take away his importance to this team.    To answer your question, You're probably not the only person, but I hope not too many people think that, yet at the same time, I hope everyone realizes how important he is to this team.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	hes the 4th best.     1.kobe    2.pau    3.bynum    4.ariza.    but ariza is awesome with his determination.|`|21J0IIZbaa	He is an important part of the Lakers quest to the title.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Last time I saw Ariza play he was on my favorite team and what I can remember is he was super athletic, but lacked a jump shot and he was a very good defender, but sporadic @ times. We traded him for Steve Francis, which was foolish considering Francis did nothing here and Ariza would have been a nice component to the bench in Mike D's system.|`|pHacyTFhaa	Yes.      And as a note, he can sort of shoot, but he's not reliable enough to be called a shooter.  He can shoot decently enough from midrange to sort of keep the defense honest, he defends fairly well, he is a decent rebounder, and he's a hustle guy.  In terms of talent I'd place him below Gasol, Odom, and Bynum, he probably "contributes" more than say Odom, but still.  We'll see if he gets better.|`|4IDgCFWdaa	He's not that great at creating offense. He can't take anyone off the dribble. (or at least he never seems to try) He always needs someone to help him get open to be effective. But other than that he's a great player. But definitely not the second or even third best player on the Lakers.|`|DkwgogXZaa	he' s a great player....but come on better than Pau or Bynum?|`|uxregJ0faa	Yea only you. What happened to Pau?Or Bynum. Open your eyes. Yea hes good. Hopefully he will get even better|`|GswnLKtQaa	Ariza has alot of potential to be a very good NBA player (future all star). but the Lakers is filled with talented players like Pau, Drew and Odom.    He's the second best defender! behind Kobe.|`|kYBlgFQAaa	Probably not.  Some Lakers fans aren't too sharp, so I doubt you're the only one.  How is Pau Gasol not the second best player?  Didn't you pay attention to the Lakers marked improvement upon his arrival from Memphis?  I don't think that was a coincidence.|`|u94OIhfBaa	He's really good...But Prolly 4th...First Kobe, Second, Bynum, 3rd, gasul, and 4th Ariza.....|`|2kgTdNRQaa	It looks like he's working on being the best, sometime soon.  But as long as Kobe is there, Ariza won't have a chance at playing key roles that Kobe does.|`|xeEOTsyYaa	His mother might.|`|25ymUKdraa	i agree with you on everything he does... shoot, Plady D, hustle, boards.. but number 2?? hmmm?? ill put him as  number 3|`|i5MInqeMaa	Yes i think you are.  Might be 2 or 3 others.

21J0IIZbaa	Knicks would love this trade.  The Rockets receive no talent or future in this trade.  The Knicks needs to keep Wilson Chandler.  Bosh and James might be on the Knicks in 2010 as free agents.|`|126986d456c7650b3fab46b5cfe905a1aa	I'll tell you what. I like this trade for New York. Bosh and James have played well together in the Olympics so there should be little cohesion time. Plus you have 2 excellent point guards in Duhon and Robinson to facilitate the offense. Not only that but you have David Lee which can be a very potent combo with Bosh or a very good backup. That front court would rival the Lakers Bynum and Gasol and probably be even better since Gasol doesn't really want to be inside. Lastly you have a good spot up 3 point shooter in Quentin Richardson.    The question is, who should coach this team, 'cause D'Antoni wouldn't know what to do with all these players. So the trade looks great on paper, but you'd have to also get a coach that can make this work.    Remember, there's only one ball, so only one player can score per possession, so the games will have to be won on the defensive end. Bosh and Lebron are proven defenders. Can the rest of the team step up? Duhon especially. You get a little runt like Tony Parker or Chris Paul who'll get inside the key and get Bosh and Lee in foul trouble, and you're left with basically Lebron again. So they'd need a perimeter defender and a defensive minded coach, and this team is beyond solid.    Also, gotta get some bench players to keep these stars' minutes down.|`|GswnLKtQaa	Just wait till 2010....|`|3teWTOPqaa	Good trade for the Knicks, but it will never happen.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	The Knicks like it, but the Raptors, Rockets and Cavs don't.|`|baf28a9e3a2f15cb8180363b8783c2edaa	It depends if players on the Cavs like naked men in the backseat of their charter bus.  with guns.|`|7X1H2AfWaa	i would say raptors get advantage because knicks lose too much.

In baseball, the "Shot Heard 'Round the World" is the term given to the walk-off home run hit by New York Giants outfielder Bobby Thomson off Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca at the Polo Grounds to win the National League pennant at 3:58 p.m. EST on October 3, 1951. As a result of the "shot" (baseball slang for "home run" or any hard-hit ball), the Giants won the game 5-4, defeating the Dodgers in their pennant playoff series, two games to one. It is also referred as the most famous case of sign-stealing in baseball.    The phrase shot heard 'round the world is from a classic poem by Ralph Waldo Emerson, originally used to refer to the first clash of the American Revolutionary War and since used to apply to other dramatic moments, military and otherwise. In the case of Thomson's home run, it was particularly apt as U.S. servicemen fighting in the Korean War listened to the radio broadcast of the game.|`|Zg8s0Ma9aa	Jackie Robinson's game where he broke the color barrier.

xhHfXuKFaa	wait until the end of the season.if kobe can step up after bynum got injured and lead L.A. to the best record he will win it.|`|pHacyTFhaa	I think the answer is obviously LeBron, he's been doing more for his team, and the Cavs are an elite team this year, so you can't use the whole "Well, the Lakers have a better winning record" excuse.|`|uxregJ0faa	Who Koby?|`|GswnLKtQaa	Coby Carl?    D-wade for defensive MVP    1st in scoring  1st in guard FG%  10th assist  leads guards in blocks  3rd in steals|`|126986d456c7650b3fab46b5cfe905a1aa	Right now Lebron BY FAR is the MVP this year. I'm a BIG Lakers fan, but I'd be beyond exceptionally biased, if I tried to give it to Kobe over Lebron. BUT!!! In light of Mr. Bynum going down for 6 weeks. If Kobe can step up and keep the Lakers on top of the West and in the running for home court over the East, then we'd have to revisit the issue. I think clearly right now it's hands down between those two. But I wouldn't count out Chris Paul just yet, as he's doing amazing things in New Orleans, and Dwight Howard will have to get some consideration if Orlando can stay one of the elite teams in the NBA.    Right now my MVP favorites are (in order)    1. Lebron James  2. Kobe Bryant  3. Dwight Howard  3. Chris Paul    I just noticed that all those guys have 2 first names. HAHA!!! Lebron for now, with Kobe gaining. Dwight and Paul still with a chance.|`|kYBlgFQAaa	I think most people have already conceded the award to Lebron.  The Lakers and Cavs have similar records.  However, Lebron is putting up more impressive individual stats.  Partly due to Kobe's reduced minutes.  I think a lot of people still consider the Cavs a one man team, evidenced by him being the only Cav selected for the All-Star Game.  I don't think that is really the case, but that is the perception.|`|xeEOTsyYaa	LeBron will win it.|`|meNI6vuyaa	I think Chris Bosh deserves the MVP award...|`|GwawzO5Faa	LeBron. Why? The numbers don't lie. His stats are better than Kobe's across the board. In addition to that the Cavaliers are 22-0 at home.

AA12055870	For me at Parkhead it has been Scott Brown. Wrongly took a lot of criticism last season, but it can be seen that he is quality through and through.    As to other teams, Wilkie at Dundee Utd along with Flood (albeit now at Parkhead), and Berra at Hearts, Fletcher at Hibs, and being a football fan, I think John Fleck looks like a breath of fresh air for Rangers even though Boyd has scored 20+ already.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Christophe Berra has had a great season but that's him gone now, so i'll go with Steven Davis or Scott Brown, both these players give 100% + more every game.

Don't watch other teams apart from on TV so being honest I could not make a true judgement on anyone apart from Rangers players.    Don't know if your answer was in my direction, Ally.  As I said, unless the Celtic game is on when Rangers don't have a game, and I actually watch the Celtic game in question, I don't see a lot of Brown or any other Celtic player for that matter.  Highlights of matches can be very deceptive.  I watched him yesterday and have not changed my opinion.  Hot-headed, doesn't score enough, torlerated only because he cost so much and the fact that he chose to join Celtic rather than Rangers.  He may be playing much better than last season but lets face it that would not be difficult.  That's my honest opinion of the player.|`|9MtS42oWaa	Scott Brown has been the best player in Scotland by a country mile. In my opinion anyone who watches all the games and doesn't see it.

They need to turn it back into the WWF.|`|2FKHNIB2aa	Yeah that probably would help but viewership would also go down and that worse then not selling PPV's. so no i don't think they need an off season.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Sure would help the wrestlers;  but the key word is "money."It wouldn't help the money, and WWE is Entertainment therefore its more about the money then anything.|`|Nmjjqoybaa	but vince still needs to pay the wrestlers monthly .. he needs to pay every crew memeber and etc .. so if there is no show he will lose money
nJ5kceMBaa	Kuyt might be given a game or two up front, especially since Benayoun has been doing so well lately. Benayoun might get a game on the right wing with Kuyt partnering Torres up top in a couple of the games at home to weaker sides. But most of the time I guess we'll stick to 4-2-3-1.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Have they even got 2 strikers now???|`|456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	It doesn't look that way and we have paid the price.  Why pack the midfield against the smaller sides?  Especially at home?  We should be playing with two strikers.    It doesn't work.  With one striker, you have seen so many times how the ball get crossed into the penalty area and there is no one there to take advantage.    No one can argue that we have and DO struggle to score at home.|`|L1QTSErIaa	Benitez will never play two strikers as long as Gerrard plays. And rightly so. Gerrard is the driving force in the middle of the park. With a lone striker, Gerrard is able to pick the right passes or go for goal. With two strikers, Gerrard will find it harder to find the right target.   Thats one reason why Keane, Kuyt or Babbel are played at the flanks. So that there more free spaces in the middle for Gerrard to play.   Besides, Liverpool always had played a lone out and out striker. Since the days of Ian Rush, John Aldridge, Robbie Fowler and Micheal Owen. Liverpool FC traditionally gives more priority to the midfield area so as to feed the lone striker. This is what you call a 'pressing game'.|`|SiOjEH00aa	the only player benitez would break his formation for would have to be a top class player.  it can only really be done if some rich arabs take over liverpool and buy david villa or someone.|`|jiFHJ6daaa	torres is enough alone there............|`|LdJFFvSVaa	Should play Torres and Carragher for a laugh|`|fEWhwumZaa	If we get anyone decent to partner Torres maybe.  He plays perfectly fine by himself though.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	I'm going to agree with you there. I guess they could go with Kuyt, but as you said he's much more suited for out on the wing, same with Babel. I also think Torres plays best by himself, with free roam of the area, as he does better then anyone. The only other striker who plays by himself that can compare to Torres is Eto'o. I'd take Torres over him any day.
0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Not that I can recall. They don't even start taking it serious till mid-way 4th quarter.

BiMkowVMaa	Those are completely different players. With completely different personalities. Completely different games.    Nate Robinson will always be what he is... a gunner and a selfish player who is too short and undisciplined to play focused defense.|`|GswnLKtQaa	Nate size is his biggest downfall. Nate is more athletic and plays with heart. but he's small to be like starks for what I remember a very good on ball lock down defender. offesively he can get better...|`|GwawzO5Faa	He's not a true point guard. Nate is more of a shooting guard by nature.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Too short.|`|FEViNlQMaa	Genes are different|`|z7jseZAeaa	Starks wasn't even that good. Check out his career stats, for starters. Even when he averaged about 19 points per game 1 season, his FG% was awful, like always. I don't know why you say he could pass or rebound either. He was a shooting guard. He played with passion and played decent defensively (like guarded well), but that doesn't mean he was a good player. The guy was an overrated 3 point shooting brick layer. If anything, Nate Robinson is better. He just doesn't get nearly as much playing time as Starks did.
HLzS2z9laa	nowhere, just because he dunked around Mj doesnt mean ish, i can dunk on Jordan too, he's not a shot blocker or nothin|`|GswnLKtQaa	I like starks 360 lay-up over rodman better. so i rank it  2 all time starks highlight play.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	top 500|`|7SCOqUa8aa	to clarify, it wasnt on jordan.. jordan merely came from the weak side and jumped at the last second.. i would say it was partially on jordan but its not like jordan was the one guarding him.. and it was an all time great dunk.. amazing play..|`|fHxpycJSaa	I was watching it live and it was spectacular. However, he didn't really dunk it on Jordan. Jordan wasn't guarding him. He was a help defender.

I think that Jordan is better because of the era he played vs better players compared to current players and the NBA had more viewers from all around the world.So i think Jordan is better than LeBron,who is great but he needs ring one or two or even more that he will get,then you can ask again and he will be really good and maybe better than Jordan as the best all time players iun the nba.|`|A7OCbBJNaa	Kobe "The Rapist" Bryant.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Michael Jordan...|`|AA11488609	Ask after LeBron retires.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Michael Jordan, LeBron is not even in the conversation, neither is Kobe, and people need to stop asking this.|`|WtcTBlccaa	we don't know yet
1E3MzC3Baa	Dunking in general is overrated. Its sad that many young kids practice dunking so much and forget about the little things that would actually make them excellent players.   That being said, however, there are situations where a dunk is worth more than the two points its scored. A particularly amazing dunk in the right situation can fire up the team and the crowd and give that team a burst of energy that a simple layup cannot produce.   There are situations where dunking makes sense, but I agree that people in general get hyped too much over dunking even when it is a pretty useless dunk.|`|AA11989758	Becuz` its fun to watch.You Celtic bandwogoners get excited over a dunk too.|`|126986d456c7650b3fab46b5cfe905a1aa	Actually, a dunk is worth more than two points. I remember a while ago, the Lakers, particularly Kobe, were playing terrible. Someone poked the ball away from a defender, and led Kobe out on an uncontested monster dunk! The emotion from the dunk snapped Kobe out of his funk, energized the Lakers, energized the fans, and the Lakers went on to a victory pulling away. Basketball is more than just bouncing ball and throwing it in a basket. It's about emotion, and a dunk or a blocked shot can often change the flow of a game and energize you to play at that elite level needed to win games.    Stu Jackson (Lakers' commentator) often says that it does no good to block a shot into the 15th row. That it's better to control it and get the ball to your teammates. I disagree. I think the emotion of the game is so important that a blocked shot out of bounds can help you pick up your defense (which is 95% attitude) and can get the adrenaline flowing that gives you that extra edge that you need. Sure in the score book it goes down as one block, or two points (for a dunk) but the ebb and flow of the game can be changed and that's just as important if not more so than just two points.    So a dunk is more than just two points, and a block is more than just a block.|`|GswnLKtQaa	If it was Ariza/Kobe/Odom doing those poster dunks and windmills i'll be off my feet...simply fun to watch.|`|xeEOTsyYaa	Most Lakers fans know nothing about basketball, so probably not.|`|WtcTBlccaa	lakers fans like what they are told to like the nba likes when the lakers win cause l.a is were the money is sometimes i think basketball is staged worse than wwe with the refs announcers its all bs|`|3teWTOPqaa	lol this question makes me laugh so hard.     A dunk is a great play, we cheer because it's a great play, basketball fans cheer because it's a great play.    EDIT: Do Cavs fans know the chalk throw is worth ZERO points? Then why do they cheer so hard?|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Laker fans know  the game. I think you are watching with a jaundiced eye.  You see - and hear - what you want. I have been watching the Lakers since about 1960!|`|BiMkowVMaa	Sorry dude, thats every team. I've been to a couple of pro games in different states and it happens the same everywhere.    They damn near blowout the P.A. system and the FAN meter when LeBron and Wade dunk. Dwight Howard brings out both with the dunk and the block shot.|`|3f5vlE0Aaa	yeah.|`|wKGZ0h8Paa	I just want to correct you a little.  A dunk is not the same as all field goal.  There is a 3-points field goal.  That's worth more then a dunk.
fpbLkbJzaa	Hmm - difficult to judge, Terry, as to who's pulling which strings  these days when bean counters and foreign investors are involved.  Clubs 'worth' say half a billion bondoolas can't place their destiny in the hands of a 'Manager' who in turn is subject to prima donnas, unsettled players, injury lists, suspensions, huge numbers of impatient paying customers who believe they could do the job better - and the wiles of agents expert at feeding rumours and counter-rumours.  (Not forgetting the gutter press forever stirring things up regardless of truth.)   I'm no expert on L'Pool matters but Benitez doesn't seem to have reacted too well to the inevitable pressures and some of his tactical changes have been weird to say the least.  Keane's transfer back to Spurs - presumably at a nasty loss to Pool illustrates things are far from settled at Pool and I imagine there'll be ongoing animosity over the blame.  Echoes of Mourhino ?  I'm far from sure Benitez will emege as the Boss in the same way Rednose and Mr Wenger are 'pivotal' to their clubs.  He stil hasn't signed his contract and possibly is calling the tune just now (on a bolshie, unsettled palyer) - but will he if Pool don't win a major trophy ?   The transfer deadline has been extended due to weather conditions (subject to e-mails) and we won't know the fall-out for a while (many a slip, etc).  I certainly agree your comment re Heskey - a bargain compared with Keane's alleged 'value'.|`|IXDiEX8eaa	They can wait for the next transfer season to come and this time surely,Torres would not be injured.I hope he is fit always.|`|m7tjMSDCaa	i have faith in rafa! we have other people anyway....kuyt...babel...others|`|jiFHJ6daaa	http://www.premiershiplatest.com/news/02...    sorry buddy|`|nJ5kceMBaa	I am 100% with Rafa on this one. I'm relieved that this isn't going to be one of those things where we end up pointlessly hanging on to him for a couple of seasons, then loan him out before selling for about 1/5 of what we signed him for. I'm glad it's done and dusted and we've got rid.      FQ: Dirk Kuyt, Ryan Babel, Krisztian Nemeth, David N'Gog, David Amoo, Dani Pacheco, Nathan Eccleston.      Edit: No, you're right - Kuyt and Babel aren't prolific, Nemeth would have to be recalled from loan (and recover from facial injury), N'Gog hasn't been impressive, and Amoo, Pacheco & Eccleston are all really young and inexperienced. But hey, you have to deal with these things. Answer me this - was Keane contributing anything that these players couldn't?|`|t2nObP1aaa	boss of what, fat spanish waiter society|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Proved he's off his rocker...|`|duJgBxUoaa	Surely he has a plan?|`|GjpWEu6Raa	i heard it was parry who brought keane in the first place    and did you know that in nearly 200 games for tottenham keane was a 2-1 goals to games ratio somnething like 196 games and 107 goals    and at liverpool he scored 7 in 23 appperances almost 3-1     so he was not doing that bad when you see it in those terms better than others liverpool have got     he needed time and benitez never gave it to him whether it was because he was a parry signing and not his we will never know ..!    well at least some thing good came out of keane going back to spurs    YOU MADE 5 MILLION ON THE DEAL|`|IlDD3qumaa	Its just another publicity stunt.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	yes Rafa is the boss of the waiters and sold a player that could not make the grade         FA) they will get Robbie Keane back to replace Torres if he gets injured|`|pescodEvaa	Another baffling decision by Benitez. He luckily got us to 1st in the league by the start of the New Year, and since then surprise, surprise, He has re-introduced his ridiculous policy of rotating our players, and even worse playing them out of position.

The sooner Benitez goes the better. This must be the most obscure decision he has ever made, now we only have one striker who is good enough to play in any form of European competition in our squad, so basically, Fernando - our season now bares upon your shoulders.

It's just that I always expect so much from an Elimination Chamber match.  And not all the people, on Raw's side, I believe, are up to par!

LzkujA3Faa	Wasn't it a shocker, mate! Even Punter admitted he was just sitting back, expecting them to call either Pup or Mitch. Even i feel Mitch should have won it. He has done a tremendous job in the absence of Brett and deserved some recognition. Katich too had been a consistent opener for us.    I think Clarke and Mitch should have tied. Mitch had really emerged as a great bowler for us and i am really shocked he didn't even win a single award. Anyway it would have been a pleasant surprise for Ricky. But at least they made the right decision in the case of Hughes and Kilinger.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I think Mitch should have got it, but Clarke was also in with a chance.

f1UYyl3Qaa	I started last year when i was 15, as a freshmen in high school. After the Season, i knew i wanted to be a professional tennis player. I had some natural talent too, i ended up winning conference. I havent even been playing a year yet, but im working on becoming a pro.     The Thing is, you have to be more dedicated than you think. You need to play everyday, you need to practice everyday. You need to research form, tactics. You need to train your body, train your mental aspects of the game. You need to improve hand eye coordination, reaction time, footwork....    In the summer i played every day for 2 and a half hours on avg. Still, i did not improve as much as i hoped, and if i waste this summer like i did last summer, then i will surely not become pro. The thing is, i just spent the summer playing, not practicing to get better. Make sure you focus on getting better.     I Saved up my money for a tennis ball machine and bought one. In the summer i plan using this everyday. Still, i dont know if this is enough to become pro.     But i will try no matter what, and if i cant get pro, then maybe my son will, maybe i will become a tennis coach, and maybe i can coach a pro. But Pro or not, Tennis will be in life, and i will try as hard as i can to achieve my goal, as you should too.    However, i dont see this happening for you, because you cacn only play 2 or 3 times a week. You'll need to play everyday if you want to go pro from 15. If its within 10 miles bike there, bike there, if not, try to practice without one. But still, dont give up, you may end up a coach or something.|`|e88d2d2d98ed34d4a785a69b0406b4acaa	if you're serious about tennis, the first thing you need is a coach who will help you achieve your goals. Tennis is a sport that is played by many but mastered by few. If you don't have a sharp coach you can develop some really bad habits that will eventually hold you back. Also, 90% of every tennis match is played in the MIND, so you absolutely need to understand how to play the percentages and how to approach each point/situation. This is not something that you can figure out yourself, but something that a good coach can teach. It's like trying to be a chess master, but not learning about strategy and trying to figure it out on your own.    You can spend a million hours doing tennis "workouts," but without guidance, frankly it will be nothing but wasted time.    that being said, the answer to your question is to play EVERYONE you can, all the time. Play the old guys/gals that hang out at the courts. Play the young hotshots. Sign up for as many tourneys as possible. Learn from every loss and get better. Play. play. play.|`|GCUyyvwiaa	Well the odds are kind of against you...most if not all upcoming pros play every single day for many hours.  The best thing I can tell you to do is get back in lessons, play for your school tennis team, read up on nutrition and fitness, and as lame as it may sound... NEVER GIVE UP! :] oh yeah and believe in yourself too haha!|`|qIYez6SMaa	you need to practice and also play in USTA tournaments.    i thought i wanted to go pro, too. i spent a year down at Bolletteri's last year. but now im back home and going to private school, because i realized that i needed an education. however, tennis will always be a big part of my life. i'm still practicing 3 times a week and playing tournaments on weekends.     i've improved a lot by playing in tournaments. they really boost ur game. the more experience playing matches, the better.|`|SDfvVhocaa	Well your 15, so you have plenty of time to practice, and if you don't have a tennis court near you, play tennis in your backyard against a wall it's almost like playing a real person, but as far as playing as a pro my fist step would be to get in a local tournament were you can be spotted by a scout as long as your good, then the scout will take it from there.|`|8sfybuGZaa	Well the odds are kind of against you|`|nqOqaNIEaa	ur not goin pro
e88d2d2d98ed34d4a785a69b0406b4acaa	sorry to say this, but if you don't notice the difference in strings then it doesn't matter to you.    what I mean is, the better the player, the more important small details will be in his/her play. For example, Serena could beat me using a $39 racket from KMart, even if I had a $300 racket with the "best" strings available. But, Serena couldn't beat Venus with a KMart racket, because she'd need every possible advantage to be effective at that level.    the rule of thumb for sports equipment, including tennis, is to try the equipment (strings, tension, different racket etc.) and see how you like it. If you notice it helps your particular game, meaning it compliments your racket head speed, your spin, your etc, then you should use it. The stupidest thing is for you to pick a set of strings, string tension, racket, etc just because one of the pros, your best friend, the rival that always beats you, etc, uses that equipment.    that's one of the coolest things about tennis. for every player, there is a different style, technique, speed, etc.    Try a variety of strings and see what you like (and don't like) about them. Probably one will enhance your game more than others.    enjoy!|`|hCLmczgMaa	im not an expert on what strings to use, but yes strings do matter. With different tensions you can feel that when you hit a shot something just isnt right. Im not sure at one tensions one needs depending on the amount of spin they put on the ball, but yes strings matter.|`|Wjp0niEhaa	Can you tell a difference when you drive with bald tires?   Its the same idea.  Of course there are plenty of women who won't know the difference between used tires and top of the line Michelin racing tires!  If you drive like a granny on the tennis courts, you won't notice a difference between strings.  But if you drive the ball, and play at a decent level, you should be able to tell the difference between Natural Gut, and a cheap synthetic gut.  Great tires can be wasted on a old, cheap car, with bad shocks though.  So the car/ racquet also makes a huge difference.  Tension also makes a difference pending on how much power/ control you want.  Tennis elbow sufferers should string their racquets on the lower end, which also helps the durability of the strings.|`|8sfybuGZaa	not huge but yes|`|RC3WoqFkaa	strings matter. some strings don't go along with a person's playing style so they don't like the string. brand doesn't matter, but type does. higher tension= control. lower tension= power|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	Strings are as big as a difference as rackets in my opinion. You dont need the best possible string for you, so just find a description of a string that fits you, and buy that one.

4maLlESdaa	Since you're in a pool, I'm guessing you're using fairly a short kayak, and I'm guessing you're having a lot of trouble making it go straight. To help with that, sit up straight and keep your eyes focused on a distant target. The bow of a very short boat tends to "wag" back and forth with every stroke, so if you're focused on the bow, you'll have a hard time controlling the boat. Reach forward when you take a stroke. The paddle should go in near your toes. Take short strokes; the paddle should not travel past your hip, and you may want to even think about taking it out around your knees at first. Keep the paddle blade that's in the water close to the boat by holding the paddle as vertically as possible (unless you want to turn, then hold it more horizontally). Do all of this slowly until you get better. Going quickly makes it harder to coordinate all these things, and once the kayak goes out of control, it's hard to get back to going in a straight line. And have fun!|`|AA11045576	Read a manual about kayaks and the strokes and braces. Learn a safe way to enter a kayak from poolside. Be sure you use a paddle sized for you. Many beginners never learn to paddle forward in an efficient way. They use their arms to stroke.  Watch others. Use your trunk torsions to pull the paddle through the water..better yet, pull the kayak to the planted paddle with the torso torsion. Lift/stop the stroke at your hip. Learn: stop/brake stroke, forward and back strokes, right and left hand sweep strokes and draw strokes. Practice their forms poolside.  Learn the high and low brace, again, practice it poolside. Few kayak paddlers ever learn all these elementary strokes. The pool is the best place to learn rolls...take advantage of it. Use nose clips if chlorine bothers you. Arm chair exercise...draw diagrams of each maneuver.|`|wqgBi10Gaa	there are some youtube videos that demo the different techniques.|`|eo3EHDVIaa	Just make the same mistakes on both side sand you will go straight. Any idiot can paddle a 'Yak|`|AxqpE3nOaa	Quite honestly, you are in a kayak; which, unless you are in class 3 or 4 rapids and above, do not require a lot of technique, just practice.  Just make sure that you are using equal pressure on both side, it may seem weird but try to put a little bit more strength into your non-dominant side.  When all else fails, solo canoeing is about 150% better than kayaking.
11yX7qRVaa	Yes. A good pair of tactical boots are worth it. Make sure they're waterproof, and try them on. Make sure they fit good and snug and are comfortable. Stay away from any pair that feels uncomfortable or like it needs "Broken in."    You Can tuck your pants cuff in. It will keep you drier and protect your legs in the short term, but I always pull my cuffs out after a while anyway.    Finally, the top Eyelets for the laces are usually holes, not hooks. Put the laces in backwards when you tie the knot so you can tuck it inside the boot too. This keeps it from coming loose.

Even with new intensity & merciless Age of Orton, Undertaker is just another piece of work.  Randy may win a few battles, but the war would be won in Death Valley!!!    WIth Orton & SHane, it depends on Shane's frame of mind at the time of the match.  Many may forget, but Shane can take some punishment & still stay in a match, & this from someone who is not a pure wrestler.  Years ago it may have been, but the Last Man Standing match against the Big Show, the WM match against his father Vince are testaments to what Shane-O Mac can do.  But, the ultimate testimony was the No Holds barred Match few years back against Kurt Angle.  Kurt used everything in his arsenal, the ankle lock, four angle slams through plexiglass signs, multiple German suplexes, you name it, but Shane stayed in the fight the whole way, busted open & all, even catching Angle in his own Angle-slam.  Finally, it took for Kurt to get a platform, set it up on the top rope & Angle-Slam Shane off of the top turnbuckle in order to get the win.  If it takes that kind of effort to put Shane down, Randy does not have it in him.  Orton is great I admit, but he gets frustrated to fast in long matches & he relys to heavily on the RKO - which while it is a great finisher, can be too easily countered.|`|rQ9Fl0jlaa	the undertaker.  obvious choice.|`|BAurzDXtaa	The Undertaker will defeat Orton next week on Raw    Shane will be in a blind rage at No Way Out trying to avenge his father and Orton will capitalize on this and get the victory via RKO.|`|NRs72Afxaa	Most likely it'll be a no contest with interference from Shane and The Legacy but if the match is clean then Orton would go over which would build him up strong again.     If Undertaker won cleanly then their Ortan is worthless and will be hard for me to take him as a world champion.    Ortan will win at No Way Out.
Vbfq5YUTaa	I Respect All Wrestlers    BQ:Kelly Kelly    EDIT:Because how she is when she is not on RAW  she is from what i've heard a real B*tch and she refused to sign some stuff for fans then said lets get out of here thats not what a Performer does to there fans|`|iOICjcZcaa	Wrestler:     Triple H. I won't say that his ENTIRE career was a success because of Stephanie, but it definately helped. Before Stephanie McMahon, Triple H had won seven titles. Now he's at twelve and could very well surpass Ric Flair's sixteen world title record holder.     I think now that he knows he's got WWE security for life, he's taking full advantage of it. He hasn't lost a match clean since No Mercy 2007. Ever since then, the only times that he's lost were if someone cheated or if he were in a match with at least two opponents.    He doesn't put any effort into his matches anymore. He comes in and basically does the same thing every match.  1. He takes down his opponent.  2. Somehow he get countered and put in a submission hold.  3. He remains in the submission hold for a good percentage of the match.  4. He SOMEHOW powers out and is completely unharmed.  5. Punch, Irish Whip into turnbuckle, Spinebuster, Pedigree. 1-2-3.    It's the same thing. Sometimes, he Irish Whips them out of the ring. The only time he really seems to go all out is for PPV's. I won't lie. He is an AWESOME wrestler. He does great in his PPV matches, but honestly now he's just not really putting anyone over.    In 2006, The Great Khali was debuting. Taker put him over in their match when Khali beat him with a three count completely clean. Then  last Smackdown, Triple H beat Khali with ONE Pedigree. Pathetic.        Diva:    Maria. She came in the Diva Search and didn't even win. Since her debut, she's done almost nothing but Bra and panties matches. She's a Playboy covergirl which honestly is probably the only reason she's still here.     She spents 90% of her match jumping around yelling "Are you ready yet?" while in reality she has absolutely no idea what she's doing. The only thing I've seen her do is the Bronco Buster. It's a STUPID move that doesn't even inflict significant damage.|`|Tsv6zyawaa	I hate John Cena, JBL, Klly, and Maria. They all can't wrestle and are so BORING! Kelly kelly is like a twig barnie Doll.

5rHtkOdKaa	Someone can feed you swing advice forever if you wanted.  It's useless if you don't go out and tirelessly practice.  That's truly the best way to improve.    It's impossible to give you swing advice if i've ever seen you swing before.  You don't want to fix something that you aren't even doing incorrectly.  Regardless of your swing, I can promise you that you need to keep your head down on every shot.      As for your golf coach noticing you...work on your game and you will be rewarded.  I'm a junior in high school and i've been playing out of the  1 spot since my freshman year.  It all comes down to dedication and perseverance.|`|mboOgC3Faa	keep your composure, my hs golf couch told us taht if you hit a bad shot in front of the couch dont feel down cause they know taht everyone hits bad shots and they dont want someone just slaming there clubs|`|CBVlu3Gvaa	I'd suggest a lot of practice......you can't do what you don't have it in you to do.

Make sure you follow through your shot and finish high. Around the green try to get your chip shots inside a imaginary hoola hoop, and on your putting just try to get it close and maybe some will fall. But most of all TRUST YOUR SWING!!!|`|5knGTf5paa	go to the driving range and hit bucket after bucket of balls until you feel that you are comfortable enough to do it infront of the coach. just keep your eye on the ball and dont try to kill the ball either just hit it.|`|4b3332df8190c2f3c7712f9c840cba13aa	Don't get too nervous. If you start to become nervous your muscles will tense up and you'll hit poor shots. Stay as relaxed as possible, and do what you normally do. If you're not playing good at the moment I would suggest to go take a lesson and practice a lot.

DhEZj9cKaa	You spin and then spin a little bit more|`|DD5Gsqx4aa	1) Look down at your skis and see if they are twin tips. Twin tips will help your progression so much more. If you don't own them I recommend checking them out at www.lineskis.com/home.  2) Approach the jump and watch a few other people go off it, to get a feel for the distance people get and how fast they are hitting it, because you want to be comfortable with the speed.  3) Make sure that nobody else is attempting to have a go and start to approach the jump at a decently fast speed, as you will need enough air and distance to stomp the 360.   4) Pop off the lip of the jump so you can get your air, and before you initiate a spinning motion make sure your tails have left the jump (or if you are starting switch then make sure your tips have left the jump).   5)Immediately turn you head, not a sharp jerk, just a turn, in the direction you want to spin.  5) The rest of your body will naturally follow, but you may not have enough air time to complete the spin, so to overcome this obstacle, you throw the arms and shoulders in the direction your head is facing to start rotating.   6) Make sure you are looking at where you want to land throughout the entire jump, so you have a definite point where you will come out of the air.  7) You can, if you like, (assuming you are hitting the jump forwards), let your tails just touch the landing ramp right before your tips do, to "feel the landing."  8) Do your ride-away immediately so nobody comes after you and lands on you, and move on to the next jump, trying the same trick but spinning the opposite way.|`|K2ANu4LNaa	it wouldn't hurt to get some twin tips especially when you start spinning past 360. You can still learn to spin without them however. practice having even weight on each ski and knees slightly bent. then give a slightly pop as you go off the lip of the jump when your in the air wait for a moment for your tails to clear the lip of the jump then twist your head and look the way you want to spin. look for the jump then keep looking for the landing. as you spin your head you will feel the rest of your body following try to spin your shoulders and hips at the same time. but the spin will start in your head. do not try to spin just with your skis cause u will fail. if you are landing backseat try spinning later and if you are landing forwards then spin sooner. the most important aspect is the flow of your spin throughout your body. some people find it easier to bring their legs up into a grab. idk what ever works.    keep it real|`|WBzoocIhaa	Punch your arms though to give you the spin right when you jump (pop) from the lip, tuck your legs slightly to spin cleaner, look for your landing, bring your legs down and stomp    You really got to punch though if your do 3s of little kickers.  And more than likely your gonna fall.|`|k1C70y8raa	simply put, when you hit the jump pop off your toes, throw your arms and make sure you turn your head. leading the rotation with your head makes your body follow. and once you have started the spin pull your arms to your chest to accelerate. leaning back while leaving the jump will make it near impossible to spin a 3 as a beginner. hope this helps. keep shreddin

MC2L5nRAaa	Everyone can make excuses why the losing team didnt win the game, I am a Patriots fan and I do agree in the first half the penalties killed the Cards drives, but in the second half, the Steelers had alot of penalties and the yardage difference was only about 30 yards at the end of the game from penalties. When it comes down to it, the best team is the last one to score, and in this game it was the Steelers, it could have gone either way in my opinion and the Cards have alot to look forward to in the coming season.|`|hfEGHKePaa	No. Steelers did not cheat.    Suck up the loss and move on.|`|IGCZq7BXaa	ya that was bs cardinals had it|`|YzWkNRFZaa	Every gay fan is sooooooooo jelous of the steelers    LETS GO STEELERS!!!!!!!!!!!|`|eOQ8rGqCaa	If the refs made bad calls how were the Steelers cheating? I am sick of all the loser Cards fans hating the team when they sucked, then right when they get good jumping on their bandwagon and now they are complaining about the game. Sometimes that happens where calls just don't go your way. You become very bias when you look at stuff like that, trust me I'm an Eagles fan and I thought the Cards cheated but I got over it and realized that there is a penalty on every play in the NFL that isn't called. Beleive me, the Cards had their chance to win, and they had just as many calls go their way. You need to chill out, why don't you go to Roger goodel and ask for a penalty called Super Roughing the holder than and make it 50 yards.|`|X8NGHSP8aa	How about all of the holding and grabbing the face mask of James Harrison that weren't called. No wonder he went off in the fourth quarter. LaMarr Woodley was held all day long, not one holding call on Levi Brown. What a joke. It is always assumed that when a penalty is called or a play reviewed that it should always go against the Steelers. The officials don't win or lose a game. You ask any coach and they will tell you that good teams overcome adversity. Give the Steelers some credit. Roethlisberger drove his team down for the winning TD in the fourth quarter six times this years. How is that cheating. If that were Tom Brady people here would be talking about how great he is. I got news for all you haters, Big Ben is on the par with Peyton and Brady. He has shown that despite not having a great offensive line he is a clutch player. He has two SB rings, just as many as Brady had at his age, and one more than Manning has in total. Man take of the blinders and if you truly are a football fan you have to admit that the Steelers and Big Ben are for real.|`|eC9RmuAyaa	There were 18 penalties called total, 11 on the Cards & 7 on the Steelers. Many were not called, as the Cards O line looked like a bunch of octopuses holding onto Steeler LB's all night long. Running into the holder is most certainly a penalty, you just don't see it often because most rushers have the sense to not run him over. Fitz most certainly did run out of bounds & return to the field to make the tackle, another penalty not called. The refs let the players play in the most important game of the year, as it should be. Warner's fumble was reviewed by the NFL & was most certainly a fumble, according to the league office.|`|Af9bkdkvaa	Back in the 70s the steelers pioneered the use of steroids and I think in recent years there still are a few that are users.  In the past two superbowls they have been in there have been some of the most questionable calls I have ever seen, especially in the seahawks game|`|Bww3poJNaa	I agree with you!!!|`|f7qVtYfaaa	indeed there were some curious calls . but i think you always focus on that sort of thing when it is such a disappointing loss .had the cards prevailed you would barely note those odd calls.it only makes it worse when the nfl officials review their performance and defend it without admitting that there were a fewe dubious calls.|`|4DGcBxhRaa	yes there was a couple of bad calls against the Cards.    But seriously the Cards lost because they were a weaker team that got close to winning. But like most people you have to blame it on the refs of course instead of enjoying the great game it was.|`|jjzK1pOaaa	i know the refs definitely wanted the steelers to win...roughing the holder aint even a real penalty...its complete bull...pittsburg was getting away with holds the whole game and the cardinals were getting cheap calls away...just like SBXL when worthlessburger "scored" we all know that the "refs" wanted the steelers to win...there is nothing we can do...STEELERS SUCK!!!|`|5Q4ASbbQaa	I've seen some B.S. Penalties from the refs. It's the Steelers vs. the Cardinals. They wanted the most storied team to win that night and Goodell got his wish. The Cardinals had almost twice as many penalties than the Steelers. The last touchdown probably was landed on one foot but nobody reviewed it. At this point I didn't want to think it until the last play of the game. Isn't that How The Patriots beat the Raiders in the AFC game? How do they do a complete overturn against Warner? When it was clearly going forward. Still you can't deny the Steeler fans who have a huge fanbase.|`|OFi3jBSHaa	I didn't see a hold on Warner.    I saw Fitzgerald run out of bounds, come back in, then make the tackle. Not allowed. He never got clipped (block from behind below the waist).    You can disagree but you obviously don't know the fumble/pass rule.    Roughing the holder's ridiculous? It's a rule. It's in the rulebook. When does that rule not get enforced? When does any rule not get inforced?|`|xcxtNao0aa	Waaa! Waaa! Waaaa!!!!!  Cry baby!!!!|`|qfVE2KFtaa	I'm not a Steelers fan,but the Cards had every chance to win and didn't and plus it's nothing you can do now.|`|XsCFpnGxaa	Get over it the steelers just played better than the cardinals, your just a cry baby lol|`|O2lKh3V2aa	Hey, shut up... guess who called everything against the eagles and nothing against the cardinals in the semis?? thats right, shut up|`|7V79OMMHaa	It's crazy. Also don't forget to blame Baltimore for releasing Jame Harrison in the first place. Then he wouldn't even be in the Super Bowl to return that 100 yard TD pick!      Stay Cool
asxE8gCAaa	i would go with  1 even though i really don't like reebok when it comes to soccer cleats they are better in quality then the adidas adipure and predators. someone on my high school team has the predators and they suck!    if it were up to me i would go for adidas f50.9 they are much better don't get cheep cleats|`|3UrzyjY9aa	i thinks the best soccer cleats are the f50, total 90 laser and the predator. the total 90 laser are kind of the two combine, if your feets are kind of wide you should get the f50 or the total 90 but if your feets are not wide you should get the predators they are the best boots and the one with most technology... beckham uses predtaor and he is the best free kicker and kaka used to but now use adipure but thats probably because adidas is paying a lot money for him to that.|`|bk2T70k6aa	dude i got some advice for you, ive played soccer my whole life and out of all those shoes i would go with number 2. ive had those cleats and they are a really nice pair of cleats, you cant go wrong with them. oh and the fact that its a sweet color haha|`|zZrbR7b0aa	definitely the predators.Reeboks tend to be on the heavy side and slow you down.adipure the bottoms fall out very easy and the laces are long so you have to wrap them around your cleats alot which makes you unbalanced.I have the predators you like and i have had them for around 3 years.They are also very comfortable and if you have injuries they are really good on the support, and the only bad thing that happened was i broke the strap that ties around the laces.that was my fault to i stretched it out to far.hope i can help!!!
XrCc85kNaa	lol...just ignore those trolls...|`|i5MInqeMaa	Well it depends.  Kobe's situation was different.  and i am a laker hater, but actually more of hater of kobe fans than kobe himself.  Kobe needed to score that many points just to keep his team in the game.  Kobe had 30 plus points at half and they were up less than 10 at the half.  KObe's teamates folded up like cheap lawn chair and couldn't make anyshots aside from gasol.  so kobe had to keep scoring just so his team can maintain a lead.  From the look of it the cavs are doing fine and lebron's teamates are not missing as bad kobe's teamates were.  It's possible that lebron might be ballhogging.  Kobe wasn't ballhogging yesterday, but lebron might be cause he wants to challenge koeb's score yesterday and lebron is selfish like that at times.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	LJ does not want to back down i knew it that is how he is does like it when people big shot him watch him score a lot of points that is all he is trying to do right now|`|Mn97YDIyaa	He's not trying to copy Kobe. It's anybody and everybody's job to get the ball and score when they get hot, and right now, Lebron is on a tear. He should get the ball. He has two assists in the first quarter. Kobe had three the whole game.    Thumbs me down all you want Kobe jockers.|`|IZ3tNmpyaa	How can LBJ be the "True King of the NBA"  if he doesnt have a ring to show for? Kobe won his first ring in his 4th year playing in the League. Wade got his much earlier than that.. What Championship ring has LBJ won so far? he cant even lead team USA to victory during the World Championships. Even top NBA coaches concede that without Kobe team USA may have lost to Spain in the Olympics Finals.. LBJ is a phenomenally talented player..But he is not the True King of the NBA.    Gators National Champion- Very Well Said... Thumbs Up|`|rGatOVJVaa	the raptors are leaving him open so he could take some wide open shots, his team mates are finding him so he could bury them. 2 assists in a quarter is good at this rate he might get 8 assists at the end of the game.|`|KhBmlaefaa	LeBron is a ballhog too. It's okay though because he's King of the NBA. He can do what he likes. Ben Wallace doesn't count as a real player. He's just there so it's really 5 on 4 when he's out there.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	James > Bryant|`|jjzK1pOaaa	lebron already has more rebounds and assists than kobe and the game aint half way over...lebron aint a PG either hes a F...LeBron > Kobe|`|ugRb61Y3aa	HA! I'm watching the same game, RIGHT NOW!|`|lMDy8W0Raa	He can try to copy Kobe but he wont be able to score 20 free throws without missing. And if he really wants to copy Kobe he should try to score 81 vs. the Raptors.    Go Lebrick, I wanna see it.
wp6qFB9Qaa	Nope, the Lakers need Walton more than any players out of the team... Why? cause he knows how to the triangle offense, it's not all about the stats, it's about the impact that they provide. Mihm's contract is a waste and I think that they should keep Vlad, he's just too good of a shooter to let go. Sasha, is a really good player. He just doesn't get the opportunities to play, he played good when Farmar got hurt so u really can't say that he's not good. Yeah, I think that they should let Sue go and make space for this kid Joe Crawford. I think that he can make an impact and really has a good potential that they need in the SG position considering that kobe only has 5 more years left.    Actually DJ might be a good alternative cause he's strong and can grab rebounds, he just never gets the playing time that he needs to make an impact. I think that signing Walton a 40 million deal is a lil premature, yes he had good numbers (11 ppg, 5 rpg, 4 apg, and 2 spg) but that's without Ariza and Gasol. U can't really trade any of these guys that u said cause either they play a big part in the lakers or their contract is too big for their value. I think that if they're gonna trade someone, it must be Odom, cause he only has this season till free agency, then at the end of the season, if he really loves LA, then sign with the Lakers...|`|N2177Ameaa	True say, they're just taking up locker room space.|`|WZvny7mMaa	I think they should just get rid of Sun Yue and Vladimir Radmanonic. Yue is never playing and all Vlad does is shoot threes. They are both useless.|`|CAgxexWkaa	they should|`|gdaimMuoaa	well they should just give up sue yu and vlad..vlad is just good for threes but we have other people on the team who can shoot as good as him but dont give up sasha because he is really good to back up kobe, and luke is a playmaker he makes things happen when he is in the      and he is good on defense which is what the lakers need because defense is one of the things the lakers need to correct to win the nba final

SMILE :D    be nice to everyone...every judge likes a suck up haha    be veryy peppy!!!    hope this helped ya!!....  pick me for bestest pleasee!!!!    lylas cause us cheerleaders gotta stick together....!  lemme know if u make it please|`|23qMl5LXaa	Run, tumble in the yard, eat right, practice sharp movements, ask some friends to help you do some flyering or if you want to be a base, then base. Suck on a lemon just before you go out for the try-outs. This will make your facial expressions much better. Go into a gymnastics place and maybe work with an instructor on some tumbling. Do back bends, handsprings, back walkovers, front walkovers, cartwheels, round offs, maybe even a full or two. Good Luck! I appoligize if you don't understand some of the termenology. Google the words you don't know.|`|MRijAWJRaa	keep your moves sharp and shout all your cheers. good luck!|`|GCOv4cVraa	Make sure you stretch before your routine so your moves look better and practice exactly what you're going to do a lot so you remember it.. and just relax (: good luck!|`|mjjD6mCWaa	Lets see... just do good. hahaha  kidding. Be as confident as possible but try not to be cocky. If you know you can do it and put off the vibe of a cheerleader then you will make it!|`|LUg9dgb5aa	Really?  Nice, i am a cheerleader @ my school too.  I go to an artsy school, so cheerleaders there  arent ANYTHING like the cheerleaders on BRING IT ON,  lmfao. But, anyways back to topic.   My tips are, DONT BE NERVOUS. Dont show any  sign of nervousness, even if you are. I mean, just smile,  & have a great time. Cause its super fun. Make sure you  pay close attention cause usually at the tryouts they teach  you a dance/cheer and then you have to show it to them  again by yourself or with a group or whatever.   ( Or it may be different at your school, but still. )  Hah, BE SUPER HAPPY. You have to be like really  TEEN SPIRIT-Y. Haha, its true. I mean, you cant be all like,  sad and be like oh lets go team. You have to be like,   LETS GO TEAM! Hahaa. just be happy, and enjoy yourself!  Good luck, and i hope you make the team. (:|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yeah, don't get into it... you'll be better in Wrestling ;) just kidding.. just smile alot and bounce your head around like one of those Hawaiian girls that sit on the dash board of cars.|`|I1tnVvVGaa	start stretching now....it'll help in the long run!|`|42cQpxviaa	Cheerleading is awesome! I am one, lol. Here are some tips of mine.    1. Find a friend to practice with. you'll probably have one or two clinics where you learn how to do cheers, and then the actual try-outs. after the clinics, go home and practice, practice, practice! In cheerleading, that's all that will make you better.    2. Practice in the mirror. do some drills on yourself with just simple motions - like a high V, a low V, big T, little T, daggers, buckets, candle sticks, diagonals, and so on. If you don't know what these things look like, search for pictures of them or ask the coaches. they'll probably tell you during your clinics/tryouts though.    3. Remember, Cheerleading should look sharp, tight and precise. Always keep your limbs locked and stiff when you do moves, and your clasps should be close to your body and come a couple inches below your chin.    4. A very important thing you must not forget: BIG VOICE! In cheer, it's not about sounding good or having a sing-song voice. Your voice needs to be LOUD and SHARP. Articulate when you say your cheers.    5. A Cheerleader is basically a role model and a leader of spirit. So you should always, especially to the coaches, represent yourself in a good manner. Be peppy and energetic.     And like I said, just practicing wll make you so much better. :) good luck!|`|8Eq5Pb0Gaa	Just have fun!!|`|dkTAZmKSaa	stretch like crazy. its good to have some dance experience and tumbling like the person said under me smile a lot and Look like you know what your doing even if you don't know what your doing and really have fun with the sport oh yea make sure your toe touch is perfect and that your motions are tight.

YmV3TNTpaa	You shouldn't support a team because of a player (Henry, Cisse, Zaki..). And of course you shouldn't hate a club for a single player (Ronaldo)    You said that the team you support in Egypt is Zamalek. By analogy, Manchester United would be their equivalent in the EPL. If Zamalek is Al Ahly's historical rival and if they won 5 African Champions Leagues, Man U is also trying to reach Liverpool's record of titles, and they're also very good in European competitions.    btw Wigan dont suck. And now they signed Mido (which can be an extra motivation for you)    Oh and dont worry about Cristiano. He's leaving soon|`|XGOXmiEiaa	Support Wigan, they don't suck, and they have Zaki AND Mido.

QtjnmEzoaa	I've noticed that the true, long-time Steelers fans I know are just quietly enjoying the victory. It's the ENORMOUS bandwagon that can't seem to shut their mouths, which makes the entire fanbase look bad. Don't worry, they'll go back to supporting the Patriots or Cowboys and telling us all that they'll be going to the Superbowl in due time.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Most of them are OK ,Their are a few that make them look bad.|`|r61bHJ0iaa	I have every right in the world to brag!  My Steelers won the Super Bowl and I'm happy as hell!!!! If your team won, you would be happy as hell too.  I went to the parade today and it was the coolest thing I've done in a long time!  It's wonderful to see my city and hometown team coming together for something like this!  I am a long time, hardcore STEELERS fan, and win or lose, I will bleed Black and Gold forever!|`|KTp27Fokaa	I know if the Broncos won another Super Bowl, I wouldn't be bragging that much.    They are lucky their team made such a great achievement. Their team has made the Super Bowl 2 times recently, and their fans are beginning to give the team a bad name.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	as much as it pains me to type "I wanted the Cards to win" THIS is why I was hoping the Cardinals would win......|`|mqQUqXxNaa	Let them brag, the Steelers is the only good thing about Pittsburgh...|`|RZIV15e3aa	I would rather hear Steeler fans brag than a group of sorry cardinal fans. Eagles are the best and us Eagles fans will be able to brag next season and will be bragging next year about our Super Bowl win. Go Eagles.|`|mOaxBZ2Raa	Where are all the other fans at???  I mostly see bragging Steeler fans/bandwagoners or crying Cardinal bandwagoners......|`|zzO6Qalsaa	actually was one of the best Superbowl's,I have ever watched.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	The REAL Steelers fans are not bragging.    We are hearing from all the bandwagon Steelers fans. The same people that were probably Giants fans last year.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	yes I agree the pitt fans are sore winners ,  . They beat the overrated cardinals, wow such a hard task hehehe|`|wYdHeAE9aa	really don't care at this point|`|IGCZq7BXaa	take that 100 yrd int away and cardinals would of won. it's just the cardinals need better defense|`|3yvuMkzTaa	Are you sick of hearing Cards fan cry about the refs???  You beg for stars every question!!!!|`|Q6qBxKbAaa	You can't stop them from be happy when their team won the Super Bowl. But they can be heartbreaking if the Cardinals won the Super Bowl or if Steelers make to the Super Bowl 44 again. Whoever the team is, if the Steelers lose then they will be heartbreaking. But I notice many Steelers fans are happy and bragging. There nothing I can do.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	I'm curious what team do you like?|`|7V79OMMHaa	I agree, but the Cardinals whining about bad officiating doesn't make them want to stop. I read some of these Cardinals Q&A's after the NFC championship game and they are talking about how the better team won. I had no choice but to agree even though I wanted Philly to win the game and I'm not even an Eagles fan. The Cardinals fans were stating that the better team won, but now that the Better team won the Super Bowl and keep whining they can't handle it.      Stay Cool|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Can the other fans keep their mouths shut and stop being sore losers?    Seriously though, I'm a Steelers fan, but I promise you I've never bragged about the Steelers. Quit the stereotype.|`|Fen6g3f9aa	Big Deal, The same thing would happen if  Dallas won the Super Bowl, only it would be worse with all there fair weather fans that come out of the wood work when they win. Atleast Steeler fans stand behind their team no matter what.     Let the Steeler fans have their glory, how would you feel if you had to root for the Pirates all summer.|`|ZPJyVOpTaa	Yea there bragging, but how can you not after your team just won the Super Bowl. Im sure it will go away soon, but the SB was only a few days ago and it hasn't quite sunk into the fans yet. As a Giants fan, i certainly was bragging to the people who gave the Giants no chance to make the playoffs, let alone get to and win the Super Bowl. You bet i bragged, but it only lasted about a week and then it started getting old about bragging about a team. Im sure its going to get old in a few days. Cant blame them for bragging being that it happens every year. But i hear where your coming from, it deff gets old and annoying, but theres is nothing, you or anybody else can do about it until next SB.
WnQ3fhVhaa	I would look on the USA hockey and Hockey Canada web sites. They should have sections on women's hockey as well as background. I know the USA hockey one does. I am not sure about the exact history of how it became an Olympic sport. But maybe check with the IIHF site on that. I am sure it has a list as to how to get a sport qualified as an Olympic one .  I do know the USA hockey site also has the latest stats on how women's hockey is the fastest growing of all categories right now .|`|1035b561c3cc75bd52fa0a1ec4ef8d3caa	Yes The USA woman's team and the Canadian's women team are the best in the world.    The canadian's hockey team in the last olympics dominated every team but fell to Team USA. They also had the most goals (est. 100 goals within 12 games)     Team USA who is a team to beat practices with NHL players same with Team canada so they have great hitting, speed and shooting as well as a physical mind set.     Although there isn't a WNHL, women's olympic hockey is no joke and is one of the few sports that North America dominates in. They are seen as the Yankees and Red Sox of hockey.     Not real info i guess sorry lad..
1035b561c3cc75bd52fa0a1ec4ef8d3caa	There isn't a true limit but a team sets their own weight limits.    But you will mostly hear that a player ways 215 to 226.    A goalie can't be fat because they expect the goalie to skate and to make sure that doesn't happen, the NHL set a rule that  goalie pads only go up to a certain size, and as of 2005 they made the pads smaller so there will be more goals.    Sorry edit: They would also be a health risk if they were over-weight so coaches and managers really take fitness seriously    Also NHL goalie pads are limited to 38-inches (76 centimetres) in length. If a goaltender's pads are found to exceed the limit, his team will be fined $25,000|`|axxQzOCHaa	That would be a crease violation if I ever saw one.   Besides your pads would be oversized and illegal.|`|d9329ea0bdca3de02039a3f70fc57a5faa	Ya, no weight limit. Doesn't help to be insanely fat and be a goalie cause you gotta be able to stay on your skates, and your knees are gonna give out if you're like 500 pounds and on skates.|`|HJuOSvmdaa	you could be 500 pounds and be goalie...as long as you don't just break the ice underneath you|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	It was too long to post I guess....LOL|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	He wouldn't be that great because of mobility.  In order to cover the entire net he'd have to be 6' tall by 4' wide below the neck, that's impossible for a human I think.  Why?  If he were standing on skates he'd be extremely vulnerable to shots along the ice.  So, then he'd have to lie down and obviously his head and neck area aren't going to be 4' wide.  Whatever room he leaves he's not going to be able to move to cover.|`|h0ooA4nBaa	gotta watch the five hole|`|m6lDXAmoaa	Great article Bob|`|fdtB4XHtaa	no human is 6 feet wide. extremely stupid question

Watch a ton of skate videos anything you want, and just think in your head how when your gonna go back your gonna try all this stuff and not be scared, telling yourself "I know I can do that."

I'm gonna say the Mossberg.|`|tFrN4du1aa	I'm willing to bet you already have a gun that will kill a turkey.  Use your money to buy some good camo and a couple of calls.  I killed a turkey last year with a 20 guage, he didn't know the difference. 20 guage is underestimated in its lethal ability.  If you can kill at 40 yds with a 12 ga you can do it at 35 with a 20.  They are lighter too. Now to the meat of the problem, if you want or need a new gun (like I usually think I do) I'd get a semi auto so the turkey doesn't hear you jacking shells in case you miss.  synthetic is tough and doesn't glare for their beady little eyes to see.  also consider buying a regular run of the mill shotgun and buying a stock from cabela's for 60 bucks.   good luck,  I can't wait to get out myself..|`|OAEuYZkZaa	I'll bet you a cup of coffee that you can buy a plain jane Mossberg Model 500 and then add a separately purchased sling and other bells and whistles cheaper than you can buy the combo.

3yvuMkzTaa	Totally useless!!!! I agree with Art Rooney Sr. Who said if they want to cheer for us, sit in the stands & cheer with the real fans!!!!  Pittsburgh Steelers!!!!|`|c6q3EERdaa	Cheerleaders add to the fun of a football game. The Rams (my team) do have cheerleaders.|`|XLXncQu9aa	I think so.  Not only does it provide some eye candy for many of the guy fans, it can be a morale booster for the team.  Also I think it provides more revenue for the NFL and their teams.  Its just a part of tradition which I don't mind too much.  Overall, I'm ok with it.  Its what makes the NFL great at least that aspect of it.|`|efdf492fe9cb67c309332e436d4aadc8aa	Yes, my team has the Raiderettes, and they're good for the fans at the game since they're something to watch while the game waits for commercials, timeouts, etc.  They dont have to be overly sexualized, though, they can just be pretty girls dancing.  Hell, most of the Raiderettes are pretty busted.    I can understand, though, that outdoor northern teams like Pittsburgh dont have cheerleaders since it'd be unfair to ask skinny girls to stand out in the snow for 2 1/2 hours in short shorts...|`|Lsb9T2KDaa	Must have - the Steelers need to get some|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Must have.

My team is the San Diego Chargers and they do have cheerleaders.|`|m4yyCDNCaa	No. When it boils down to it no one is paying money to go see the cheerleaders. Morale boost? Not really. Most fans are excited and cheering on their own without needing the encouragement of girls with pompoms. Guys will probably feel differently, but to me, they're pointless.

Z8UV6S3baa	So, all of these are pretty equivalent firearms. They each have pluses and minuses. Obviously, you should shoot the one that fits you best, but perhaps this will help:    1) Walther P99 - I have one of these in 9mm. Walther was one of the first that offered backstraps you could change out for fit. A nice feature and definately helps to get a nice fit. Personally, I shoot with the largest backstrap. Inherent accuracy of the gun is very good - Walther is famous for their barrels. The negative on this gun is that it has a long creepy trigger which stacks up in a wierd way at the end and has a relatively high double action pull weight. It takes a long time to get used to shooting fast with it, or in some cases shooting well with it at all.    2) Springfield XD, ergonomics on this one are love it or leave it. You'll either pick it up and know it fits or know it doesn't. They have built up a good reputation, a more normal trigger (Glock style) to learn and if necessary will transfer to other firearms later. My one gripe is that in general I haven't found the inherent accuracy of them that spectacular. However it is by far the cheapest and well liked by many.    3) The P/A30 is an excellent firearm, but typically is running several hundred dollars more expensive than the Taurus or the Springfield. Still the fit and finish are excellent and they are as rugged and accurate as you will find in this catagory. Personally, I don't like the feel of them that much, and they have a tall profile, meaning the barrel to and distance is long so the felt "jumpiness" of the gun is a bit more than some of the others.    4) The Taurus Pro - when these first came out Taurus had some manufacturing issues that came up in test units and such with different customers. However, in the last few years everything I have read on them has been reasonably positive. To me they are a very middle of the road gun, ergonomics are good enough, trigger is ok, etc. They may feel much better to you, but for me this gun is very much a value proposition piece as opposed to something I would love to be shooting.    Thinkingblade|`|d938becd9c20c43cfbbbca1473443b4aaa	I believe...being female...you would like the p99 the most, simply because it is high capacity shoots just as good (if not better) then all the others in your list and it will be super comfortable for smaller hands...Taurus is crap, XDs are awsome but a heavey spring that might be more difficult to pull back the slide, and H&Ks can be uncomfortable in the hands.|`|lmWqwpygaa	The XD is an excellent pistol except it is just too heavy. I have one in 40 cal.   The P99 and P30  are a little pricey....but they are high quality guns.    The 24/7 Pro, I believe is a better choice for several reasons.  1. Price is least-- and its just as good as the others just without the reputation. The Pro is the latest generation of a line of poly frame pistols that Taurus has been making for years. Once they got all the bugs worked out... they added the suffix- "Pro".  2. The 24/7 is lighter.  3. You can get the 24/7 in Titanium for about $100 more, a 24/7 Pro in Titanium weights just 23 oz.    You should consider 9mm. Its much cheaper to shoot, and the 9mm rates only about 3% less (91% to 94%) than the 40 cal in actual stopping power. Even though on paper the 40 looks more powerful- ballistics charts. But these are just mathematical calculations and not actual bullet through meat tests. Does the 40 have more power than a 9?- Yes..but not much.|`|dncp7sE6aa	I agree with the .40, any carry caliber should start with .4.  Also I would go with the XD, I have carried the service size and the subcompact. Loved them both and were great shooters. Good magazine capacity. And with the money you will save versus getting the H&K, treat yourself to some night sights.|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	If you are comfortable with the recoil I'd go for the .40 S&W.  In terms of a particular pistol, I believe the Springfield XD is a very solid choice. I've seen numerous mixed reviews on the Taurus and in a defensive pistol I'd rather see something a bit higher end.  The H&K is reportedly an excellent pistol but again I've no personal experience with it.    Striker fired pistols are my choice for most folks for a defensive pistol.  The consistent shot to shot trigger pull is normally easier to master than conventional double action autos and less prone to accidental discharge than single action action autos.    I've fired about half a dozen XPs and have two shooting buddies that have them and they like them a lot.    Good Luck!|`|xvy9xWvGaa	If you can handle the .40 S&W go with that.  The only draw back is that the ammo is generally more expensive than 9mm.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	KM,    If you are an experienced shooter, I'd say just pick the pistol that feels best in your hand and budget.    If you are a new shooter, you need a good .22 LR revolver to learn to handle a firearm safely, and to learn marksmanship without breaking the bank.  You can buy 500 rounds of .22 LR ammo cheaper than the cost of 50 rounds of most centerfire cartridges.  The .22 has negligible recoil and a mild report.    I suggest the revolver because it is simpler for a novice to learn.  There are no manual safeties to remember.  There are no magazines to get lost or damaged.  And good quality revolvers generally have better sights and triggers than comparable quality/price semi-autos.    I can and often do go on with a long list of advantages revolvers have over pistols for the novice, but I'll let someone else do it this time.    After you've learned the basics of handgunning with a .22 LR revolver you will have a better idea of what capabilities you want in a handgun.    Congratulations on deciding NOT to be a victim.    Doc
xP08melDaa	Well, you can get them online at these stores (And trust me its not a scam, I've gotten nice shoes from here)    -Eastbay.com
CFm0u13Paa	Stick with .38 Special +P ammo in your snubbie. The 357 loads gain very little velocity over the +P loads in such a short barrel and all the extra "power" in the .357 load becomes a hellish amount of muzzle blast and flash. Since most firefights occur in low light there is no sense in having your own muzzle blast blind you and render you defenseless.    Most major ammo manufacturers make a .38 load that is optimized for short barrels. You'll find it much easier to shoot than the .357 loads which are designed for much longer barrels.|`|XNpnK4vpaa	The pistol is optimized for close-range encounters.  Seven yards or less would be a reasonable practice distance.    For giggles, you can try longer distances, in increments of 5 feet.  But at 75 feet, few pistoleros are able to keep all their shots inside a 4" diameter circle.    Yeah, I tried shooting a snub-nosed revolver at targets 100 yards away.  It was a hit or miss situation, with most of the shots being misses.  Bullets would easily disperse and impact 6 feet away from the point of aim.  It was an educational experience.    The .357 Magnum generates a lot of recoil when fired from a snub-nosed revolver.  I traded a .357 Ruger SP101 in for the .38 Special version.  I've no regrets about it.|`|9pXKZ5udaa	two inch barrel you better be only 5 foot away from target. at that range a sword or club is just as effective.|`|U0qmWhDlaa	Best range to practice at ... 7 yards... that said I have a S&W 686 snub nose and with the right ammo can routinely keep 5 out of 6 on a paper plate at 100 yards....    Don't underestimate the inherant accuracy of a snbby wheelgun|`|AA12034449	We spend a lot of time with CCW students ... any defensive calibers should be practiced with at distances from contact to "across the room" ranges or about 7 yards.    If you have a place to practice... work on shooting on the move to...left and right. Standing still in a gunfight will get you shot... a simple sidestep is pretty effective way to make the other guy miss.    With a little practice your snub is capable of pretty good groups out to 25 yards... 5 rounds- less than 8 inches -center mass is doable with snub nosed pistols shot from stable rested positions.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	If you are a good enough pistolero and practice a lot, you can keep a cylinder full of shots on the chest area of a B-27 silhouette target out to 100 yards or more.  But best accuracy is under 50 yards.    I know most folks will think that snubby revolvers are only good at powder burn range, but it ain't necessarily so.  Some pocket sized revolvers try to act like target guns, but they lack the sight radius to be used at long range in anything short of an emergency.    I suggest that you do most of your practice at ranges from 7 to 50 yards, with a little long range fun shooting thrown in for good measure.  Being able to make close-in shots is vital, but sometimes you have to engage targets a bit further out.    Enjoy your new Taurus, you've picked a pretty fair little pocket revolver.  BTW, even if you carry it in your pocket, use a holster.  I couldn't count the number of pants pockets the front sight of a revolver ruined over the last 30 years.  Get yourself a pocket holster and save lots of mending.    Doc|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	The inaccuracy of short barreled revolvers and pistols has more to do with the short sight plane than the short barrel. If you put a 2" barreled gun in a vise and the same 6" barreled gun in a vise, they are likely to shoot the same size groups.|`|d938becd9c20c43cfbbbca1473443b4aaa	around 20ft...the gun is a close range self defense pistol...only met for piont blank range|`|Z8UV6S3baa	Bob is exactly right. A decent shooter can easily tear the center out of a typical 50 foot target with that pistol at 30 - 35 feet. 2" is enough barrel to stabilize the 125 grain .357 round so it won't tumble or key hole at any realistic pistol distances.    Therefore it is all about you. Most people attribute to the pistol a widening of their group which really is about them being lazy about their sight picture and letting the shorter sight radius cause them to have less precision in their alignment of the sights as well as their front sight alignment to target.    I personally have spent some time shooting snubbies just this last weekend and consistently could create a 6 shot group with at least 4 rounds touching at 25 feet on a new gun with disciplined shooting. In fact, I rarely shoot anything much closer than 25 feet unless I am running a specific speed drill or something. Now, I am a USPSA C class shooter, so experienced, but far from world class by any means.    So, start with the expectation that you should be able to group like you do with your .45's. The gun will do it if you can.    Thinkingblade

The Phillies already have Jayson Werth, Shane and Ibanez as their outfielders....  They would be overpaid for a backup if we get Manny....    Besides....we shouldn't waste all of our money on Manny...  If we do indeed decide to spend...we should go after more pitchers...  We already have a very good offense...|`|bXn6WGaXaa	No. The guy is a phenomenal bat, but is carrying way too much baggage.|`|8sfybuGZaa	No, I think it would be stupid and a waste of money.|`|gVYfFSpRaa	No, I think it would be stupid and a waste of money.  The Phillies already have 3 good outfielders and a decent hitting line-up.  Manny is an adequate outfielder, no better than Victorino, Ibanez, or Werth, and his bat isn't as valuable with the good-hitting line-up they already have.  I think he would hurt team chemistry too.|`|Mf6cyniKaa	no. because i like the phillies and they have enough talent already. i also hate manny so if they got manny i would like the phillies less|`|c3tADklmaa	Your nutzz!!!! The payroll skyrocketed, they've got Werth, Ibanez, and Victorino starting. Who should be left out? Werth? Hellz no! The only good thing here is the relationship between Manny and Chuck.|`|brd6l4MAaa	No. The team already has phenomenal chemistry and even though Manny appears to have good relationships with a lot of his fellow players, he also has a tendency to be disruptive. It hasn't been that long since some similar types of disruptions had been cleansed from the dugout. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.|`|jiPuVLvWaa	No. I prefer the Phillies without massive tools on their team.    Chase Utley, Cole Hamels, Jim Thome = Good  Scott Rolen, Curt Schilling, Manny = Bad|`|sCCUesFWaa	From an offensive stand point it makes sense, but from a business point of view it doesn't. We are having problems giving Howard what he is worth, and Manny wants way more than Howard.     Let's not forget Manny just turned down a one year deal rumored to be worth 25 million. He is looking for a long term deal. One of the threads on this said it best in that "our team is too cheap to keep good players".|`|ut3u2e65aa	Turning down that offer was stupid. That was the last offer the Dodgers were throwing out to him. That's probably the last offer he'll get this offseason.|`|cGOBkGwwaa	no i hate manny he's such a cocky trouble maker.

The Phillies are already world champions without him!|`|Mxzz2my7aa	no|`|9XCL2ElKaa	where would they put him. they have victorino and wertz. and just signed ibanez. plus, they're going after nomar as a righty bat off the bench.|`|ubGNtkHQaa	No Money left|`|gwUq6HMUaa	I don't think they have enough money...|`|2V3JZ3Wbaa	You can see already what other teams think about him anyway.

They signed Raul Ibanez and didn't even go after Pat Burrell. They won't want to spend the $ on him.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	If there smart and want to lock up the division then thed get him.

tFrN4du1aa	Yes the little buggers eat apples.   The best method for hunting tree rats would be to go deer hunting, as I've noticed they aren't scared by 30-06 rifles.  However when I go out with my son actually looking for them with a 22 they are scarce!  I'll sit in an orchard by the house waiting for deer and they run right up to me.  I'll watch them grab apples all day.  I did shoot one a couple of years ago with my 300 savage, he learned his lesson.  They eat pinecones, corn, acorns, you name it. You might get one to sound off by rubbing a couple of quarters together to mimic another squirrel eating.|`|bGlZ8I2iaa	Squirrels are fuzzy tailed rats and will eat most anything they can find to chew up and swallow! There is a reason folks call them tree rats. I regularly shoot them off the compost heap, the cattle feeders and the protein tubs. Last weekend, one got in the feed room and chewed holes in four or five sacks of range cubes...fatal mistake...he's in the freezer now...Hunt for them where ever the food source is at that time. If the pecans are ready, hunt the pecan bottoms. If the peaches are ripe, the peach orchard. If natural food sources are scarce (winter time or drought conditions) look to livestock feeding places or bird feeders.  They have preferences, but are highly adaptable and will eat what is available to them.|`|M5XjqI40aa	They like corn. You can use the same as you use for baiting deer.|`|AA12034449	mostly nuts, seed,grain. and fruit if its around. Squirrels eat a bug now and again too|`|h2KkiKK3aa	well, they eat apples up north here in canada because they have stored a bundle in my old shed here.  squirrels literally eat everything that's edible, from bark to seeds, from eggs to bugs, they eat everything.  but their favorites are apples, acorns and evergreen cones.|`|AA12069128	They may eat apples but here is a list of more common foods. I've found that they really like acorns and beechnuts whenever I have hunted them.  The Eastern Gray Squirrel consumes a variety of foods such as inner tree bark, various seeds and acorns, walnuts, and other nuts found in the forests.|`|9pXKZ5udaa	mostly nuts and seeds.....apples if nothing else around....also corn (which is seed)|`|7royFhIgaa	Primarily nuts and seeds and as well  fruit.|`|WBGnXsr7aa	corn, acorns|`|HMgDJ8EEaa	Sunflower seeds.....we through out some bird seed for the birds and it had sunflower seeds in it and they ate the sunflower seeds.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	down here in south Georgia, they eat pecans, acorns, sunflower seeds, apples, pears, wild pears, corn, wild berries, pine cones- and when they are still green too, and they 'steal' from momma's bird feeder lol    they also love chewing on Christmas decorations too lol  and if you have any burlap bags around, you better expect a few holes in em too     they also love to chew on boxes- practically anything they can get into their mouths, they'll chew up and eat    true story: we had a HUGE cardboard box in a storage area and them critters managed to get in the storage area and they chewed a hole in the box just big enough for em to fit in and by the time winter was over with, the box was over half full of acorns-- no lie either!   them critters are very forgetful too lol

ePvvGUu3aa	He would actually make an impact on the show even if people don't want to admit it. Rob Van Dam's name sells for itself. Fans will straight ahead disagree and say he would be worthless because of this "PG era", but I would have to strongly disagree with that. Rob Van Dam is an already established top mid card - main event carder. His history alone in the business is something that would help. Here are a couple things how he would make an impact:    1 - He would bring in his refreshing wrestling style in the ring with some of the good talents in ECW. People don't realize that they do put on some solid matches. He even would be able to make others look good and put some of them over. He is one of those who would be able to carry that brand.    2 - As I mentioned, his name sells for itself. Most of his fans will start to view ECW now if he were to return. This would be a super positive for the WWE, especially because he would be a profit in the WWE as well.     Those are two main facts why he would be an impact and because he is the whole damn show.|`|h9PVRHPWaa	It would give ECW the highlight of the week.|`|4V6V9uN8aa	None, actually.  RVD would be the main star on the show, but who would there be for him to face?  WWE would have to move him immediately to Raw or Smackdown.  How much longer they will even bother with ECW is my question...  Every time someone is doing good on the show, they move him to Raw or Smackdown..|`|VF2D3yTgaa	It would give ECW the highlight of the week.|`|B8cf1k5Oaa	Uhmmmm Rvd Would Have Made Ecw A Lil Better Than Now Like Ecw Would Probally Have Taken A diffrent Turn Like Maybe There Be More Hardcore And Like Better Matches But If He Was Still Here He's Probally Been Drafted To Anotha Show|`|tl1HTJRwaa	With the current state of ECW he would have none his talent would go to waste. i mean he could feud with what 2 or 3 people? (Swagger, Henry & Finlay)
8qtm4qkUaa	do you have a better way of ranking players for seedings and a place in season finales like the Masters Cup? It won't work to have something subjective - everyone has their own opinion.    The players accept the rankings and they work for what they are meant to do - which is to determine seedings and order of entry into tournaments.    Sure, anomalies can get thrown up especially when there are no obvious number one players based on results. Eg Jankovic being  1 female player until the Australian Open this year. But Serena has put that right and returned to  1. As they say, the cream rises to the top.    It's also possible though for champions to be  1 for only a brief period. EG Pat Rafter a decade ago. Pete Sampras mightn't have liked it (because he never showed Rafter any respect and was always a sore loser when Pat beat him), but Rafter's 2 US Opens and other results on the hardcourts, and getting to 2 Wimbledon finals in a row, meant that he was rightly judged to have been  1 when at his peak. It was an all too brief peak, but he deserved it at the time.    In conclusion, then, I think the rankings are not 'just a statistic' because they represent player results on the court not just sentiment.|`|8sfybuGZaa	statistic|`|hCLmczgMaa	They are all based on statistics, but usually have something to do with champions. Roger Federer is a champion so he was number 1 for a long run.     But there are such flaws like davydenko. Now i cheer for him and whatnot but he is not champion and some havent really heard of him. he doesnt make it far in any grandslams but kept up at top 5 because he just played soooo many more tournaments. He's not bad but he played a crazy amount of tournaments. I wouldnt consider him a champion.|`|CAgxexWkaa	statistic|`|gP7IB2XCaa	yes-i kinda get what you mean. but-serena is  1, but venus would have ben higherup, if she had made it farther in the tournament...  then-you  talked about federer. i honestly believe that roger is the best player in the world with his game and skill, but nadal deserves it.|`|3jBUJxOdaa	Rankings speak for the accomplishments of players within a given time (1 year). Yes, it has its flaw, but it's still is by far the best and most reliable indicator of who is Number 1 or Number 2 or basically who is who.|`|u3FqxhY8aa	I think usually they are pretty accurate, of course there are always flaws to things..they are accurate because even though people were saying Andy Murray should be number one, he shouldn't he did well for 7 months and he still has a lot to learn.  They show who has done the best for the past entire year.  On the other hand it could just be a statistic, Jelena who still has not won a slam yet has been number one I feel like for her it is just a statistic, until she proves herself from her talent (which we all know that she still has) rather than her endurance she doesn't truly have the number 1 spot.  That will always belong to the Williams sisters as long as they are around.  They aren't accurate in the fact that a single bad day of tennis against any player can result in a big drop in the rankings for you, yet one great day of tennis against some players doesn't get you very far.  Not sure that I made myself clear there but what I am trying to say is that in the grand slams where there are so many points offered, just one single completely uncharacteristical (is that a word?) error can destroy your ranking.  They tend to be accurate though, Rafa is definetly the number 1 player right now, though there is something about the women's game in general despite what I said earlier in this that tells me none of them deserve to be number 1 right now...either they don't play enough and you don't get the feeling from these players that they are truly putting their entire heart into the game, or they aren't true champions and don't deserve the top spot..  David Nalbandian is a flaw in the system personally, he makes it to the second or third round of just about EVERY grandslam during the year nowaday, but at the end of the season when everyone is exhausted David talks advantage of this time and he beats people and wins tournaments.  It doesn't feel like he ever strives to be beyond what his skill level is right now, Rafa once said "Nalbandian can do it, if he wants to" as much as I dislike David it certainly seems he was a wasted talent that doesn't have much right to hang onto the top 10 or 20 for that matter.

uopnVOGIaa	I have both an FS Pro bodysuit and a Blue Seventy bodysuit. Both with zippers that don't come down. They stay up there and may slip a little but they wont just zip down.    On that note, you have to check that the zipper is done up perfectly. Get a team mate to do this, and after they have zipped it up, get them to run their finger up the zipper making sure all the teeth are in place and none are poking out. If the zipper isn't perfectly in line and some teeth are not tucked in, it could potentially blow the whole zipper open. Ive seen a mate of mine do this off the start of a 50 fly.    Good Luck|`|ic5ClGRvaa	the bodysuits always have zippers there no way to really get it on. actually thats not true if you got a high neck body suit it will come with a zipper but if it's a low neck suite it own't come with a zpper.

If high school is his goal, tell him to get a teaching credential and work his way up in a high school system from Frosh ball to Varsity.    If he wants to go college, it really helps to have played in college. He would want to try to get on as a graduate assistant. There would be no pay, but the school puts you through their grad degree program while you are an assistant coach. Most graduate assistants can get retained by the school at which they trained. This is also the best way to get into the pros if you didn't play college or pro ball.|`|bJB9lY4eaa	Actually, in college you can declare coaching as a minor and take classes in coaching and learning to be a good coach. and unless he plays collegiate football it would be really hard to advance past the stage in which he plays, high school players would coach high school football. usually you need expierience to get noticed, not all the time but usually.

085ceb5bb7c326a63e32a1f2eb169f02aa	The answer is no jewelry.  No bracelets or as stated above, no tape over your bracelet or earrings.    If you tape over it, most referees will not ask if you have jewelry on under that tape.  However, why do you want to wear it?  It is against the rules and if you get caught, your team will be charged with a team delay.  If they already have a team delay warning, your team will lose a point.  Just because you are wearing a bracelet.  It is not worth it.|`|FGZR9RwDaa	nope, you have to take it off|`|mY1R6erBaa	No they will ask you to take it off and deppends you may get a penallty really the only jewlery you can tape is earrings and hair clips i hope i helped.|`|wJGQtHuhaa	No the ref. will ask u to remove it. No bracelets, ties, elastics, or rubbers on wrists. Because if the ball hits the bracelet it pushes t into your skin and get hurt. But you can band aid some studs in your ears :]|`|2C8Kjj78aa	You can't tape over a bracelet -- you have to take it off.  This is both for your safety and the safety of others on the court with you.      Those who are saying you can tape over earrings are incorrect under USA Volleyball rules.  My line when I'm reffing and I see tape on a player's ears is to say, "You can wear tape on your ears if you'd like, but the earrings underneath have to come off."      The only allowable jewelry is a flat band, like a wedding ring, worn on the hand.      Here is the applicable rule:    4.5 FORBIDDEN OBJECTS  4.5.1 It is forbidden to wear objects which may cause injury,  or give an artificial advantage to the player.  USAV 4.5.1: It is forbidden to wear hats or jewelry. An  exception will be made for religious or medical medallions  and, for adult competition, a flat band ring worn  on the finger. If worn, medallions shall be removed from  chains and taped or sewn under the uniform. If a ring,  other than a flat band, cannot be removed, it shall be  taped in such a manner as not to create a safety hazard.  Braces, prosthetic limbs or headgear that may  cause an injury or give an artificial advantage to the  player must not be worn. If a brace, prosthetic limb  or headgear is used, padding or covering may be  necessary.  4.5.2 Players may wear glasses or lenses at their own risk.|`|dvqQ5CXwaa	As a coach and a ref. For a junior club player, the only jewelry you are allowed is a religious medal either taped to  your chest or sewn to the inside of your uniform. AS far as ear rings/or nose rings studs that are taped in. The rules forbid them, some regions will allow them for local tournaments, other wise you can wear a plastic spacer.    USAV 4.5.1: It is forbidden to wear hats or jewelry. An  exception will be made for religious or medical medallions  and, for adult competition, a flat band ring worn  on the finger. If worn, medallions shall be removed from  chains and taped or sewn under the uniform. If a ring,  other than a flat band, cannot be removed, it shall be  taped in such a manner as not to create a safety hazard.  Braces, prosthetic limbs or headgear that may  cause an injury or give an artificial advantage to the  player must not be worn. If a brace, prosthetic limb  or headgear is used, padding or covering may be  necessary.|`|zvq3uiB6aa	Hmm... I would try using pre-wrap, and ask the ref ahead of time. If they say no, just cut it off and retie it later.|`|jS4UoChZaa	well if you tape the blaclet they cant see it so you will be fine.... but i woldnt use pre wrap cause it comes off easy..  use the athletic tape so the refs cant tell|`|sGSv8Nzjaa	No its so not okay   don't risk yourself getting caught|`|H8r7G1R5aa	No, you can't tape it, you have to take it off.|`|hW36lgZyaa	You have to take it off, but if your bracelet is a religion thing than you can tape it.
NRs72Afxaa	Name of Company: Tna    Person: Vince Russo    Reason for wanting him fired: When I first watched Tna back in January 2006 I was hooked into it.

That rely on a marketing, and a better Tv network this october.but it would give a "beth of fresh air" and give younger minds with imaginations a chance to see what they could Develop.

I think Edge should go back to earning his title shots rather than sucking up to the GM or his wife should we say. Plus for me the whole Edge and Vickie is getting Stale    Improvements  It would bring some refreshment to Smackdown, the show has improved alot since the draft, but i think just having a new GM will make it go that further, I am a fan of Edge, but seeing him not being involved with the titles everytime he's around would be a nice change. I know he had a break, but that was because he was not there. I would like to see him in action, but not in title matches all the time and while we still have vickie thats whats gonna keep happening.|`|6f41c712d34a30397cc9d83fa0a8d496aa	WWE: Stephany McMahon.

Never have to hear "HE'S taking a WHIZZ." from Cole again.|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Name of Company: WWE    Person Fired: Vince    Reason for wanting him fired: For turning WWE PG and ruining all the good crap that made me like WWE in the first place.    How this improves the show: It'll allow me to turn it back to the way it was during the WWF era    =At least the attitude era was actually good and got you wanting to watch it. WWE now is just boring and half the time when its on im not even paying attention to it cuz I already know whats gonna heppen.    PG sucks and if you like it then you dont know what actually is good entertainment.|`|B8cf1k5Oaa	Wwe creative Writters-Cause These Rivalarys Are Leaving Me Pissed Like Hbk/Jbl Wtf was tht and just all thes horendous storylines its pissing me offf    Tna-Announcing Team Don West And tht other guy I forget his name lmao but yea they suck at commenting like they need to fire them and get new ones|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Name of Company: World Wrestling Entertainment    Talent Fired: Triple H (Paul Levesque)    Reason for Dismissal: He Buries Young Talent , Won't Put anyone Over Cleanly , Is Married to The Bosses Daughter , & Uses That and his Backstage Pull to Garner Victories and World Championship Title Reigns.  Is also looking to be THAT GUY to Dethrone Ric Flair of his Record 16 World Titles.    How Dismissal will Improve Company: Younger Talent with ACTUALLY get a Chance to Shine & Move up the Ranks of WWE.    We are Sorry to Inform you of This Dismissal Triple H (Paul Levesque).

The only thing the guy does is cut a good promo. He is a bully to stars backstage, and not that good in the ring. He takes up space in the main event scene that could easily go to someone more deserving.|`|ePvvGUu3aa	Name of company: WWE (Brand: ECW)    Person fired: Boogeyman    Reasons for wanting him fired: He is long overdue and honestly all his matches are just squash matches. His gimmick might be over with the fans right now, but all reality he isn't contributing to the show by squashing everyone. In my opinion, he doesn't have that "it" factor and he's just one dimensional where as he can't play a different role. In a business perspective, I would need to get rid of him to make room for someone more profitable or at least who I can build to be more profitable. Fan's perspective, he isn't eye catching at all.    How this improve the show: This would improve the show because it would make room for an extra talent or two. Wrestlers won't end up being squashed on the time in ECW. Instead of getting squashed, they can work on their wrestling ability and showcase their talent. Thus building up to bigger stars or however high the WWE wants to put them in.|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	Name of Company:WWE  Person fired:The Miz  Reason for wanting him fired:He is stopping John Morrison from getting into the mainevent roster  How this will improve show:WWE will save some money during the recession by firing someone who has no talent and will get a wrestler that could be pushed for a mainevent status in John Morrison|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	wwe  vince mcmahon  because he is an idiot that gets too involved with the wrestlers  just keep the mcmahons off the air|`|h9PVRHPWaa	WWE/ecw brand  Hornswaggle  He watered down finlay one of my favs  It would allow finlay to go back to being a BA heel that loves to fight.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Company: WWE     Person fired: Khali     let's be real here, he sucks as a wrestler hasn't added anythign special to the WWE except that rivarly with Taker even then he sucked. He's wasting space withhis kiss cam, and any user here that can think for themselves will realise it there's younger talnet that should be getting put out there more than him.     Improvements: The talent will be better without having t job to a talentless giant, may hopefully  reduce jobbing a bit|`|wr8TZED8aa	WWE: Stephania McMahon.    She keeps c0ck blocking my C-AWrgasm by limiting more and more things since she's in charge of create-a-wrestler relations with WWE video games. Yes, i'm aware this is a very selfish thought.

fHJqqMzLaa	Hi,  I have been diving since 1984 and teaching diving since 1985.  I have been involved in the diving industry as a manager of a dive store (currently at http://www.visibilityunlimited.com) for 18 years now and   I hear this question often.  Once you are certified, you are certified.  The certification is a lifetime certification for all of the agencies.  It is suggested that after a prolonged period of inactivity (scuba) that you take a refresher course but it is not mandatory; it just helps get the cobwebs out.  The only agency that used to require a recertification was YMCA but that changed years ago.|`|LlYAO0Zpaa	Once your certified your always certified however it is also advisable to do a refresher course before you go diving which is done in one lesson to go back through the basics.    You will also find if you have not dived for a year that all good dive centers will insist you do a dive with them in a safe environment before they take you out anywhere to ensure you are safe and up to speed.
zVecr1F0aa	For me, its split. On one hand, LeBron James has just been completely dominant this year and has really elevated the Cavaliers to another level and is obviously the best player in the NBA currently. However on the other hand, no person is more important to their team than Dwight Howard. Without him, I'm not sure the Magic are even in the playoffs, but with him, they're in the top 3 in the eastern conference. If I had to pick one, I would pick Howard, simply because of his value to his team.|`|D2CC2t0kaa	Dwayne Wade:    - Team in contention  - Stats  - Team Record WITHOUT him (shows his value)   - Consider what he has done with this team with the current roster  - Rookie coach and PG and still puttin up ridiculous stats  - Like an assistant coach|`|N2177Ameaa	Probably Chris Paul, Dwayne Wade, or Lebron James.|`|gmvusL2gaa	Lebron. Without him, the Cavs would be a losing team. I don't think you can say that about a player on any of the other elite teams in the league.|`|reIMLCKkaa	Kobe, When his Center went down he took over the team and scored 61 the night they found out. He is a true baller. He has had a few triple doubles this season and can play any role needed. The leader when Bynum is out or the assist man when Bynum scored 42. He leads his team in assists and scoring. He handles the ball and hits clutch shoots when needed and is the most deadly player in the final 4 mins|`|X7Yt4qo3aa	Dwight Howard or Kevin DUrant.

Yeah the ECW title is within his reach looking at the recent title holder list.    Edit: yeah couldn`t agree more man.|`|NRs72Afxaa	I quite reading spoilers after BFG and it felt soo good. I actually enjoy a wrestling show. I wish users from wrestling fourms(wrestlezone and WNW) would quite reading them and they won't be so grumpy.

Did You know you are doing the right thing.

WA- I think so but I think it will be very short lived and perhaps this is WWE's way of rewarding Tommy for his loyalty.|`|XRf5JWbxaa	And as if you're not chatting right at this moment?

6W68Qftdaa	In the early days of formula1 a normal racer might be able to build his own car or buy an old one from another team and race it in F1.  However, due to rising costs, changing rules, and increased competition due to the increased profile of the sport, by the 70's or so this wasn't possible.  More recently, in the past 15-20 years are so, costs have continued to run out of control as the FIAs cost cutting measures have for the most part, failed.  This has driven smaller teams from the sport; 20 years ago there were close to 30 cars qualifying for each race, now there are maybe 20?  Of course, there are still equal, if not more drivers coming up the junior ranks and gunning for those few seats.     Additionally, since costs have been so high, many drivers are expected to bring money (their own money or a personal sponsor) to race.  Even assuming most race seats at the F1 level are paid, most in the lower levels are not!  The reality is it probably takes millions of dollars just to progress your career to the level right below F1 to get noticed.  If you don't have that funding, you probably won't even have the opportunity to prove yourself.          Finally, the current economy is not helping teams and drivers get sponsorship, which is causing more and more teams and drivers to pack it in at all levels of the sport.|`|d720cd234b26aec0b10b06cc2d725085aa	Mainly because it is. You have to have some ability, money behind you and the ability to apply yourself. Even this won't be any guarantee of getting into the sport.|`|DHGC7BXQaa	Because you need to be able to spell it first.....;)|`|z6TaVFjOaa	Being an F1 racing driver is a very small profession. Last year there were just 22 of them at most, now there's even fewer. If you include test drivers, there might be another 15 or so. It's a *very* small pond!|`|Bvv5c9qraa	bcos f1 is  for talented drivers unlike that p1$$ water racing Series called indy|`|x277rQvqaa	Because these days you have to have the support of a major team. And that support is very hard to get; there's a lot of competition for it.
3cQx8ZFSaa	there both great but im going with Hulk Hogan|`|h9PVRHPWaa	Going to have to go with taker. He has stayed loyal to the company longer than anyone. And maintained main event status the entire time.|`|BAurzDXtaa	The Undertaker because over the years he has incorporated new moves into his repertoire to keep his character fresh.|`|Tsv6zyawaa	Hulk Hogen is good. but, to me Undertaker is even better!|`|VF2D3yTgaa	hard one but i think 70s hogen was better|`|5864fJdSaa	No doubt, The Undertaker. Sure, Hogan was a wrestling and American Icon, but The Undertaker is truly legendary, No one can deny that!|`|fuLVjGB3aa	Ha Taker  three things!

Thumbs down here  >>>>>>> \/  >>>>>>> \/  >>>>>>> \/  >>>>>>> \/|`|wKnjGSU1aa	Even though most people might not agree with me, I won't count Aguirre, but I would try to bring in Raul Arias. He has long experience in the Primera Division De Mexico, he knows the style of play from the Mexican players. His teams are always very well balanced, he's not defensive or offensive, he's balanced, and if people realize, that's where football really matters the most. He's had Campeones De Goleo, he's had the best Defense. He's had San Luis superlideres, back when he was with Necaxa for the 1st time, he had them real good. He's a very well-balanced coach and works all the lines good. He's done those things with the players that either America or Necaxa didn't want, can you imagine what he would do with a team full of the best players of a country, I think he would do real well. I think he deserves it.|`|aGpr0Qg5aa	Jorge Campos as coach!?? wtf he still has a lonnggg way to go, but is possible for the future...but for now Efrain Flores would be the one|`|JiKNOtvdaa	I'd say Javier Aguirre would do a fantastic job with Mexico|`|kPbou3Vdaa	El "Pelado" Diaz|`|XSBNv0iOaa	Javier Aguirre  Hugo Sanchez  Manuel Lapuente  Ricardo Lavople    One of these guys.|`|4AfL5ecuaa	That's being said, I think they should look into guys that have been in the system for a while and know how mexican football works. I think jesus ramirez should have remain the coach and not been sven. He's mexican, coached the u 17 wc team and is an amazing coach and leader. Also I have always like the ricardo la volpe. He can be  contraversial but he wins games and keeps the team competitive. Jorge campos I think should be next in line for a position. He's worked with the national team b4 and knows more than sven despite campos never coaching a nt level|`|QcEcylBvaa	I think picking "Ojitos" Meza or "Piojo" Herrera will be a mistake. I think the Mexico NT job is too big and too much pressure for them. Their style of soccer will fail. I also think you made a waste of 5 points on this because it's obvious mostly everyone will say Aguirre on this one. I think it should be "Chepo" de la Torre.|`|y2pLd9MXaa	i would'nt like to see aguirre as coach if he coach that's probely means memo ochoa as starting goalie since he now sucks cause of being overrated i am a america fan but ochoa sucks balls since clausura 07 when we lost the final to pachuca and two goals that he could have stop and vs usa in 08 two goals he could have stop the one altidore headed he could have stop it but due too his now slow reflexes he couldn't LaVolpe should be coach aguirre should coach indios and save them from desenso and go to liguilla and lose but gain more respect for indios and then he could be coach|`|d006c09fcf96a47861ea8ba43ac7673faa	CHELIS FROM PUEBLA....

RqP8j5DMaa	You'll definitely want to find a pair of gloves that are very waterproof, cause wet hands suck big time, personally I like wearing mitt's with glove liner's for their warmth and ease of getting on and taking off. Try to go for something with gore-tex or similar material. I have Grenade P.S.M mitts and they have been perfect, they also come with liners. Burton gore-tex, Grenade, or Celtek gloves should make anyone happy, just find the right fit and something that flexes really good when you try it on, cause once it gets colder out, some gloves will stiffen up and be very hard to move in.|`|SohrsIBoaa	after riding 4 seasons with these gloves. i will never recommend any other. my hands NEVER get wet, and they are so tight on you, you have so much motion. easy to take on and off, and the warmest of them all. highest water proof rate possible.     http://www.dogfunk.com/dogfunk/CTK0043/C...    may i also recommend a airblaster ninja suit. best first layer to wear ever. if you have  the money that is.|`|Pkx3V92faa	Yeaaaa sorry to say but everyone here is right. It's def important to have warm hands lol, because having cold hands sucksssss! I usually buy gloves with some grip, a strong material and inner linings. Thats all i really look for when i need to find another pair of gloves. I've got so many, i've dropped them in the parking lot, lost them in my house somewhere, let people borrow them, left them at the shop, left them in the lodge, all kinds of ****. Most of the time i'm buying gloves it's because i need a pair because i lost the pair i forgot mine. I have my favorites i like to wear, then a mass pile in my closet and in the back of my car. haha.|`|IA054Pqcaa	Dude, gloves don't really matter THAT much    the expensive ones will be more flexible but for sooo much more it doesn't matter.|`|LIKkt8djaa	heh gloves don't matter that much? sorry but that's dead wrong, it's pretty easy to tear gloves when you're riding so quality of material is quite important. Also you'll want to make sure you have a rather high waterproof rating, 10k is usually the recommended number to not go below, and from the looks of it the dakine vectra look to be better material and goretex.
Qz3sii2caa	Because they asked him to?     Thanks to Janet and Justin, there will never be a "sexy" entertainer performing for SB halftime. I'm sure if Bruce got his t!ts out, no one would care.

It would be just as bad as using the Jonas Brothers or Miley Cyrus.      Bruce Springsteen was big at his time and has made a lot of money.  At 60 years old, he still has the energy to perform like he did when he was younger.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|ZPJyVOpTaa	I agree with going with classical rock, being that not many people like rap or hip hop. But there are better classical artist out there and there is modern rock artist out there that would have been better Bruce Springsteen. Nothing against him, but this is the biggest stage in sports and the most watched program that night and they could have made a better choice.

1Z0Lmrk1aa	Listen I saw all the hate myself and its the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. Kobe could have saved Obama last night, dropped 61 pts and these idiots would still fault him for something. There so blinded by there ignorance I bet they didn't even realize they were witnessing history last night.                I say its stats that define a athlete. If you get the numbers your going to get recognition on some level. But the ultimate measure of success comes from winning rings, that's what fans remember.    And I agree with Gator fan above, there will always be hate. You just can't let the idiots bother you too much and just accept that your going to run into it.|`|YQLNqgnWaa	agreed|`|b39550fe67f9ceab91e70c5b6b0ff30baa	luck|`|qaz33UnNaa	when people say lebron is better than kobe, i interpretate it as he can beat him one on one because lebrons D is better easily. when you measure success for a team based on one year, i think of it as how far you came from last year. if its over ten years, it is how many playoff appearances/wins you have. lebron is a better passer than kobe and rebounds the ball better. yes i know kobe can't do that and that is why he plays guard. if he was as good as lebron he would be playing like a guard at the SF position. LeBron is younger and has more potential than kobe because LeBron has yet to reach his prime and if he has, he will play like that until he is 30 atleast.|`|i5MInqeMaa	Honestly it all opinion, it's not an exact science.  Many say championships as the leader of your team is how you measure greatness like bill russell or some say eye popping domination on the court like Wilt chamberlain.  You take this section to seriously.  This love hate will go on forever so why get all angry over haters.|`|N2177Ameaa	You gotta point there...I'm not hating on Lebron cause he's extremely talented, but people gotta give Kobe some slack. Kobe is very successful and talented and he, in my opinion is better than James.|`|X7Yt4qo3aa	FINALLY! Kobe is a lot better than LeBron! James is not as productive as Kobe. LeBron is the same every night. 28 points, 7 rebounds, 5 assists. Kobe will have 30 points 10 rebounds and 6 assists, but the next day he has 20 points, 15 rebounds, and 12 assists!
qaz33UnNaa	ok if he gets fouled and makes it an assist if he doesn't no assist but 2 FTs. when you do a putback dunk, like if you grab it come down and then go back up and dunk it rebound and points. if you just slam it im not sure i would think so but idk|`|X7Yt4qo3aa	1) Yes, it is Reb. and 2 pt.  2) Yes, assist plus points for teammate  3) No, foul shots or fouls don't count
Pc0QjrQ4aa	Let me try to explain this from a real-world, business perspective.    -New York has has more viewers, population, etc. than any other US city.  The hockey club is incredibly strong as it relates to ratings.  -Ratings determine what a network can charge for advertising.  -NBC/Universal and the NHL want advertising dollars.  -New York is a competitive hockey club currently in the playoff mix.  -Actually, the accusation most leveled at NBC has been this notion that they love a certain pivot who plays for Pittsburgh currently in his 4th season (along with a forward who plays for Washington who is also in his 4th season).|`|d9329ea0bdca3de02039a3f70fc57a5faa	NBC loves the Rangers.There are more Rangers fans then Devils fans and Sharks Fans. NHL needs more viewers, BINGO! LETS SEE THE RANGERS!!|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	It's the demand! Why blame NBC for making a conscious business decision? That is like knocking a national TV network for airing a game between the Red Sox and the Yankees even though they aren't in 1st place for not showing a Tampa Bay and KC game even though they were in 1st!!!!     Fact of the matter is that NY and Philly are big markets, thus lots of viewers while SJ and NJ are not, thus less viewers......but let's show it to appease a few of their fans....doesn't make sense...or cents.|`|rFd5E06baa	Hahha|`|1ApbWVhsaa	New York/Philly is a HUGE rivalry..Two of the biggest markets in the States..Not a shock there..the Devils have trouble selling out there own arena and San Jose is a West Coast team.|`|AKHywxwlaa	New York/Philly is a HUGE rivalry..Two of the biggest markets in the States..Not a shock there..the Devils have trouble selling out there own arena and San Jose is a West Coast team.|`|3buQDaRDaa	Actually the Pens are in every broadcast. I'm sick of watching the overrated Crosby. They should only show the original six and currently good non-original six teams like SJ or Washington.    I have no problem with the Flyers and the Rangers. If the Sharks weren't playing the Devils (if they were playing the Hawks, the Wings, Boston or even the Rangers), the game would be on.

HCr21bCMaa	Honestly its what ever makes the ball go in the basket for you. If you watch the NBA everyone has a different shot, there is Reggie Miller who had one of the ugliest shots known to man but he was one of the best shooters of all time; and then you have someone like Ray Allen who is fundamentally sound in his shooting and he is also one of the best shooters of all time. It just depends on you and what feels comfortable. I shoot with my middle finger and use the index and ring for support and guidance, but when you are practicing make sure that you use the threads of the ball as much as possible.|`|D2CC2t0kaa	No just the index and middle.|`|xP08melDaa	What kind of advice is that?

S0u3HKzhaa	I really don't think it would.I know a lot of people dislike Hogan,but he really did pave the way for a lot of wrestlers to come.He did a lot for professional wrestling.He was the insperation to a whole generation.If it was not for Hogan,a lot of current wrestlers would have never wrestled.For Hogan is what got them into wrestling.Same with the fans.Hulk Hogan drew them into the sport,that is me included.Hulk Hogan did a lot for the sport.Realisticly when people think of professional wrestling one of the first things or well wrestler that comes to mind is Hulk Hogan.He was considered the one of the best.I honestly don't see there being another person in wrestling who will be as well know as Hogan was/is.But I think weather anyone's feelings for Hogan he really made pro wrestling big.    Note-  I'm not saying he is the most well known wrestler.I'm not saying he is the only wrestler who did a lot for their generation,or wrestling.Beacuse that is not true.A lot of other wrestlers have done a lot for wrestling like: Bret Hart,Ric Flair,The Rock,Stone Cold,The Undertaker,Shawn Micheals etc.|`|17f313c0636520ec01d8f896d35ffb85aa	yes because right now the undertaker is carrying it on his knees and not giving him enough credit. and the rock and stone cold did the same. hulk hogan was not that great|`|AA10819407	Ah, there were some old school wrestlers that made it possible for       Hulk Hogan to be able to wrestle....  Andre The Giant    Man Mountain Mike  http://www.obsessedwithwrestling.com/pro...    Jake The Snake    The Bushwhackers    Gorgeous George....The list goes on  The ones now, are the "Hollywood Wrestlers"|`|lWoxFHhFaa	No there is no doubt in my mind that wrestling entertainment wouldnt be where it is today. But there are others you can say the same thing about ppl like the nature boy ric flair. He definitely helped but he was by no means alone|`|sPiwb8Hraa	No. Hogan popularized the sport. But you know why he quit and did a lot of denouncing. He didn't like where what he made went, which is all theatrical entertainment now.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	Yes it would be around with the AWA - NWA- UWF- Midsouth- Power pro GWF and the people who was coming up for those groups vince did not have a enff spots for them so they lose their Jobs that was the sad part of it Know one talks about!|`|6f41c712d34a30397cc9d83fa0a8d496aa	Huh? are you okay because hulk hogan has not done much for wwe so i dont think so if you say HBK ill understand that one because HBK has doen so much to wwe.    HBK= ROLE MODEL|`|Tsv6zyawaa	Well, it depends on what he has done for the bussiness. And, yes, maybe WWE wouldn't be the same. A little bit only though.    He was one of the people who helped WWE (or WWF) become a little famous. I mean he's known everywhere. In hollywood too, where that must've gotten lots of fans.     His publicity helped, yes.|`|BAurzDXtaa	No love him or hate him there's no denying that Hulk Hogan is one of the main reason why wrestling took off in the 80's and 90's. Him and Vince McMahon are responsible for merchandising in the wrestling business. If they hadn't been as successful as they were pro wrestling would not be anything like it is today.|`|SsB7aRExaa	It was in the gutter before Hogan, it has continued to be in the gutter, it will always be in the gutter.    Hogan was merely another disposable character, one in a long string of egotistical people with great physical skills and little or no acting ability.  If it hadn't been Hogan, it would have been someone else.  The wrestling industry creates them as it needs them, and disposes of them when they are no longer useful.|`|FNwxcBPpaa	I honestly believe Hogan made wrestling what it is today!!  He's the reason I started watching.|`|RQBolYlXaa	no it wouldn't like hogan or hate him the fact is he made wrestling wot it is today|`|k8fMMxKdaa	yes
oa06BWJnaa	Wushu is a word with geographic meaning; what I mean by this is that wushu in America is not wushu in China (by the way wushu is Chinese). In China the words Kung Fu mean "learned skill" or "dedicated." Which is to say that any person who works hard and achieves something has "Kung Fu." For instance in China a hair stylist, a tailor, a plumber, and an electrician all have Kung Fu because they worked hard for a long time to become skillful in those areas. Conversely, in America, Kung Fu means Chinese Martial Arts. You will see schools with titles like Wing Chun Kung Fu, or Shaolin Kung Fu, and while this is technically correct in Chinese it is really just the western interpretation of that word. So where does Wu Shu come in? WU Shu is China's word for Martial Arts specifically, so in China if you said you practice Shaolin Kung Fu they would think that you are learning how to behave like a Shaolinian person, but if you said that you were learning Shaolin Wu Shu they would know that you are a fighting monk. So to answer your question literally I would tell you that any Chinese martial art is Wushu. However, like Kung Fu, Wu Shu has a different meaning in America as well: Wushu tends to refer to the northern Chinese martial arts styles that involve fluid motion, wide stances and movements, and often lower center of gravity. In regards to this interpretation I can recommend several martial arts styles:    Choy LI Fut  Ba Gua (or sometimes written Pa Kua)  Tai Chi (look for Chen style, its the fast kind)  Shaolin  Hung Gar  Northern Mantis    I would highly recommend Ba Gua, Hung gar, and Tai Chi, these are styles that are great for exercise, performance, and self defense.  Happy Training!|`|cILeS32iaa	Great explanation Cunamo !    Just that I always thought Wushu was a modern term to push Wushu as a modern sport in China as well as outside China. Wushu for me are the ones that you see with fancy moves. Not that they are not good just that they have turned into something for competition and for performance.    Kung Fu for me is a more traditional term which also somehow used more often by traditional Chinese martial arts. Kung Fu generally even for a Chinese means martial arts. Just that if you separate the word Kung Fu and analise their basic meaning in Chinese language it is the meaning of dedication and effort put to a certain thing so the word Kung Fu is used in other areas.    Just my opinion.    http://wing-chun-martial-arts.blogspot.c...|`|hlqj0pvxaa	Excellent answer by Cunamo.    Edit:    Chen J - the term "kung fu" has nothing to do with martial arts.     If your martial art skill is good, it means you have skills. The term kung fu means you have skills but it can be for anything.     There are alot of people here, on Yahoo Answers, who have excellent kung fu of NOT knowing anything about martial arts. That means their skills in knowing absolutely NOTHING about martial arts is very good.     I can cook really well. I have cooking kung fu.     This is how this word is used.     Being that you stated -     "Kung Fu for me is a more traditional term which also somehow used more often by traditional Chinese martial arts" -     it means you do not have kung fu (skills)    The Chinese use the term Kung Fu for martial arts now because this is what the world thinks it is, so they don't want to confuse it more than it already is.

AOPuoo16aa	Your best bet would be to call the range and ask or look online and see if they have a website. At my local range it is $20 for the rifle range and $16 for the pistol range. You get three free targets with the range fees. As for gun rental it is $15 for a 22cal rifle or 9mm pistol plus the price of ammunition. If the range is busy they will limit you to one hour if not you can shoot as long as you want.

39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	IMO the best small game air rifle in your price range is the .177 caliber RWS 34.  http://www.pyramydair.com/p/rws-34-air-r...  I prefer the original with its wood stock and post globe front sight over the Panther with its synthetic stock and fiber optic sights...    The .177 & .22 are the same rifle with the same powerplant. The 34 is "around" a 15fpe rifle...The .177 gives you around 900fps-925fps with pellets in the 7.9gr to 8.3gr range....The .22 caliber RWS 34 gives a MV of 675fps to 700fps with pellets in the 14.0gr to 14.5gr range...Those are actual, real world, Chronograph numbers, not claims....Manufacturer "claims" and real world results are seldom one and the same...    I prefer the nice flat trajectory of pellets in the 900fps range..    Example  RWS 34 + RWS Superdome(8.3gr) pellets - Using a VZR(Vital Zone Radius) of 1/2in  Sighted-in at 42 yards - You are 1/2in low at 8 yards - dead on at 14 - 1/2in high at 28 yards - then 1/2in low again at 48 yards...This is a very flat trajectory and makes for very little hold over/under all the way out to the limits(small game hunting) of your rifle(around 50 yards, with the right pellet).    If you want the .22 caliber RWS 34 you're going to have to do a lot more shooting to learn the hold over/under...You can't afford to be off by an inch or two when your target(head) is only 1.5inches...The .22 will add an extra 5 yards or so to the range of your rifle, since the added mass of .22 pellets carry better than the higher velocity .177|`|EGe0k8P6aa	In the 150-250 dollar range you've got a couple choices for the title of "best" hunting airgun in several categories: spring-piston, multi-pump pneumatic, or pre-charged pneumatic.     In the spring piston category, you could easily get a RWS 34 Panther in .177 or .22 caliber (.22 will probably work better for larger small game animals and should deliver around 20 ft-lbs of muzzle energy). There are also a number of Gamo rifles like the Big Cat 1200 that are available, but they're limited to .177 caliber and don't have the reputation for quality that RWS has.     In the multi-pump pneumatic you've got the choice of a Benjamin 392, Daisy 22SG, Benjamin 397, and Crosman 2100. Of those the Benjamin 392 is probably the best gun in this category in terms of power at around 14 ft-lbs of energy. Next would be the Daisy 22 SG and the Benjamin 397 at 11 ft-lbs, and finally the Crosman 2100 at just over 9 ft-lbs of muzzle energy.     In the PCP category you only have one real choice, the Benjamin Discovery which barely makes your price range. It comes in .177 and .22 caliber. The .22 caliber delivers around 20+ ft-lbs of muzzle energy and will shoot 3/8ths inch groups at 20-30 yards.    From the perspective of power, you should pick the gun you think you can shoot best and which you'll be most comfortable with. If you want the most power, go with the Benjamin Discovery or the RWS Panther in .22 caliber (with the Discovery being the leader there). If you prefer a specific power-plant, go with the most powerful/best quality gun in that category you can afford. From the perspective of accuracy, you'll probably be best served by the Panther or Discovery.|`|AA10240928	There's a bunch of air rifles in your price range that will push a .177 pellet to 1000 fps.  Just check out cabelas.com.  These should do the trick.    The one that caught my eye was the new Gamo Hunter Extreme that pushes a .22 PBA pellet to 1200 fps.  That's pretty good for a mass produced air gun.|`|N2UpXutyaa	In texas, air guns are illegal to hunt with, so id assume other states are the same. just goto your states parks and wildlife website to get regulations|`|4mb6xaxBaa	my 2 top picks would be benjamin 392 from mac1airgun.com or rws 34 in 22 from adventuresinairguns.com. good quality, customer service, and accurate. i prefer 22 cal for rabbit and squirrel hunting!|`|kQSSz2X2aa	Please don't hunt with an air gun.

AA11694178	If you have the clearance around your drill press, you can do light grinding with it.  Thbe bearings of a drill press are not designed to handle lateral force so you would not want to use it constantly for grinding but it is possible in a poinch ot use it in this manner.  There are grinding stones made for use in a drill press.  Select one of the proper grit and carefully feed teh area to be ground into the spinning grinding wheel.  You will need to set the speed of the press to the proper speed specified for the stone.  The main concern is that you will be grinding at 90 deg. to the normal grinding position and you will have your piece unsupported.  Of course, you can make a jig to provide some support if you need it.

It was a big shift.    Basically everyone put in $5 (we started cheap...we're up to $10 this year) and I put it in a CD at the bank to earn interest. Final winnings are split up as such 1st Place - 70%, 2nd Place - 20%, 3rd Place - 10%.    After that we did the offline draft which was probably one of the best times ever. Getting a bunch of friends together for a draft is a great time and really makes for a great afternoon.    Then we played the season and at the end of the year I simply typed up everyone roster as of the last day of the season and saved it in on my computer.    Each person is allowed to keep one position player and one pitcher for the next season.    We are doing an offline draft again at the end of March (just before the season starts) and everyone's keepers will be inserted into the final two rounds of the draft. No one has to select who they are keeping until three days before the draft...just in case someone gets hurt in spring training it's not fair to stick them with an injury case.    Our league has 18 total players per team. As such:  C, 1B, 2B, 3B, SS, OF, OF, OF, UTILITY and SP, SP, SP, RP, RP, P, BENCH, BENCH, BENCH. This keeps from the league getting too deep and people having hords of guys on their bench that never get used and it makes for better management and strategy in the draft and during the season.    We play head-to-head format with 9 offensive categories and 9 pitching categories.     Things get more complicated if you have people join the league. Not so much if people leave the league, but when people join. If people leave you just take all of their players and stick them in free agency, problem solved.    We have two people joining so they are going to flip a coin to see who picks first between them and they will get to do a two round mini-draft where they each draft a pitcher and position player prior to the actual draft to serve as their keepers.     Then we'll draw for draft order and pick the remaining sixteen players to fill-out our rosters for the new season. We draft snake format, just like a Yahoo auto draft and I never activate the league until I have everyone's money, otherwise there are always people who won't pay. Also if you're the guy in charge of the money...make sure you're very good about paying everybody out right after the season...you don't want to prove that you can't be trusted.    Well I suppose that's my suggestion. It's a lot of fun if you're the commissioner, but it's also a little bit of work maintaining the rosters after the season and whatnot. It's also important to check with the league when you set up scoring and stuff to make sure everyone is cool with the options you've chosen.    Also if you're the commish...set up a draft time as soon as possible so everyone can attend or at least be online to submit their picks via instant messenger or something. I set up my draft back in October that way everyone knew and could be sure to have the day off.    Hope that advice helps and have fun. If you have anymore questions or anything just email me at tkatt00@hotmail.com...make sure I can tell what it is or I won't open it.|`|5f734617832929d95ea7673ab5186885aa	Keeper league:     -Keep 3 players in the first season,work it up to 6-8 keepers the following couple of seasons   - Re-draft next season (less rounds every following season)|`|RDcce9Fmaa	keeper leagues have advantage of keeping owners interested    from yr to yr  --  if u have 14 players would recommend keeping    5 / 6 players per year  --  remaining players go back in the pool    --  draft for the next year in reverse order of standings  --  this    gives weaker teams the chance to rebuild  --  the secret of    success in keeper leagues is to keep all teams competitive    with an equal chance to win  --  your league will die if the same    few dominate !!!!|`|AA11526106	The hard part is keeping everyone year after year.  Very few people want to come into a keeper league after it has been going, because they either get the team/players that someone else wanted to leave or what players are left in the pool.  The key is to get a group of people that almost all of them will be playing year after year.      As far as drafting goes, it won't really reduce the draft time.  The rules have you select a few of the players that you want to keep going into the next season (You don't keep your whole team, all the players that aren't keepers go into the pool for the following year's draft).  The number of players to keep is up to the league, but you don't want to make it too many players because a bad initial draft will leave owners pretty helpless in the future seasons (and make them less likely to stay in your league year after year).  The flip side is that you don't want to make the number so small that owners aren't rewarded for selecting young stars.    My suggestion would be that you set it somewhere between 3-6 keepers per team.|`|OBke2ynzaa	Another thing you need to consider is how long a keeper's contract can be for.    In my league, we are allowed to have up to 3 keepers per year.  Also, we are only allowed to have a guy for up to 3 seasons.      We also have an auction draft instead of a snake draft.  We take turns placing a guy up for auction, with highest bidder wins.  We start with $100 to build are entire team with, so you have to budget.     The one other interesting thing that we do with keepers, since the players have a salary, a player's contract increases 10% every year.  So if you pay $20 for Jeter, then to keep him the next season, you would have to pay him $22.  And then $24 if you wanted to keep him a third year (round up to nearest $).      Only keeping a guy for 3 years allows other managers to have a chance to grab him up in his contract year, so kinda like a Free Agency.

No pretendo hacer polemica de que el TKD no sirve, por que si es un deporte duro que es muy eficaz para aprender a defenderte, pero esto le aclaro a cualquier practicante de TKD que mencione que el Karate no sirve,el Tae es un sistema HIBRIDO, del Karate y de tae kyon nacio el Tae.    Ademas la historia comprueba que en la segunda guerra mundial los japoneses en luchas de hombre a hombre con los americanos fueron superiores en los combates, antes de la guerra mundial ya existia el KARATE. La preparacion que tenian los americanos en luchas de cuerpo a cuerpo segun el programa de discovery que vi era BOXEO y LUCHA OLIMPICA, sin mencionar que los americanos median por lo menos 1.90 mts y fueron asesinados por japoneses, practicantes de Karate.    Por ello me da risa cuando leo que el Kung Fu y el Karate no sirven, si de ahi han salido muchos sistemas que al combinarlos con otros se convierten en sistemas hibridos de peleas.|`|197c1c0bc2281acec15f3c8c50501c6daa	Lo que ha pasado de moda no es el Karate en si mismo, sino los contenidos y la metodologia de ense?anza.    podria decirse que la mayoria de los maestros no saben realmente lo que ense?an, o al menos, no todo lo que deberan.   En primer lugar, debido a la "simplificacin" que sufri el karate durante la era meiji para hacerlo adsequible a todas las personas, ni?os, etc se eliminaron del sistema las tecnicas y practicas mas peligrosas. Esto ha provocado que se ense?en por sistema bunkai completamente intiles en una situacion real, ademas que haya gran cantidad de movimientos en los kata cuya funcion es desconocida para la mayora de los profesores.   Por otro lado el "endiosamiento" y a mi entender, excesivo respeto, que se tiene a los maestros hace que no se cuestione el sistema y por tanto se dificulta enormemente su solucion. (somos mas papistas que el papa)     Otro aspecto es la invasion de los estilos basados en la "efectividad" ademas de otros factores como por ejemplo las peliculas de accin etc.  han dejado al karate en desventaja, debido sobre todo a su rigidez y a su falta de pragmatismo en sus aplicaciones.    desde mi punto de vista, tanto el karate como el taekwondo, son estilos que han evolucionado de una forma muy superficial, condicionados por la competicin deportiva.  lo que con el paso de los a?os ha hecho que pierdan su funcion practica y efectiva, convirtiendose en una especie de toreo de salon, bueno para la salud y para eliminar el stress pero, completamente alejado de sus raices.     quedan ya pocos maestros que ense?en algo que merezca la pena. es una lastima.|`|Gkzw9rlSaa	es un hecho que el deporte evoluciona, pero el arte marcial es difcil que pase de moda es un verdadero arte la esencia el color la majestuosidad es un arte|`|7e463cff6db43b45830125e83a97a14eaa	estas equivocada! en mi pais hay mas escuelas de karate de lo que te imaginas. en mi opinion el tkd es demasiado comercial  y el karate es mas arte marcial que deporte. pueda ser que el hecho de ser deporte olimpico le ayude a resaltar sobre las demas pero eso no significa que sea mejor que el karate.     pero no te preocupes, para las olimpiadas de china del a?o que viene tendras karate hasta por las narices...|`|sXKSUdJnaa	no yo creo que no ha pasado de moda lom que pasa eske al teakwondo tiene mas promocion eso es todo!|`|c278b712ce63d95a527817b15a9cd740aa	dudo mucho que el karate haya pasado de moda, lo que pasa que el taekwondo, al ser un deporte olmpico, tiene ms publicidad. Pero el karate est ampliamente difundido y con un gran nmero de practicantes en todo el mundo.|`|bwR2Z2Dzaa	yo pienso que si, las modas las pone una pelicula, un atleta, los que realmente les guste se quedaran,  te digo, porque a mi me intereso el karate por la pelicula de karate kit, lo malo que mi mama de nino nunca me dejo practicarlo, hoy me gusta mas la lucha olimpica y el judo, pero si se nota en las practicas,, ana guevara estaba en la cuspide y la gimnacia se puso de moda, hoy le hacen mucha publicidad al box, y te aseguro que ahorita los gimnacios de box estan aumentando su popularidan...   a y el taekwondo no me parese tan popular, pero si hacen una pelicula y pegue de taekwando te aseguro que aumentara la popularidad|`|c3a9d55959c0012feec0e6fc3c0bfee8aa	El Karate no ha pasado de moda porque es la base de muchos artes marciales contemporaneos, por lo que he investigado el Karate, asi como el Kun-fu y el Taekwondo, son artes marciales muy a?ejas. y como te vuelvo a repetir la base de nuevas variaciones que se comvirtieron en artes marciales nuevas. un ejemplo el jeekune-do.|`|rgZmZRZ6aa	el Karate al igual que Taekwondo son artes marciales que han nacido en Oriente.La diferencia es que Karate ha llegado a occidente hace mucho tiempo, mientras que Taekwondo recin ha llegado hace muy poco.Y como toda cosa nueva resulta innovadora y todos quieren probar.Nada pasa de moda en cuanto a las artes marciales, solo que se las deja de nombrar, como por ejemplo el KUNG FU.  ya nadie nombre el Kung Fu mas que por Bruce Lee.Es as, llegaran nuevas artes marciales y cambiaran las ideas de las personas pero aquellos que llevamos practicando las distintas artes marciales no las cambiaremos y pasaremos esta tradicin a nuestros hijos.|`|f581b29c6b9ca76223c18643d1ff8bf2aa	Porque es de lo que ms hay escuelas, por ejemplo, en mi zona me quedan caminando: 1 escuela de kempo, 1 de ninjutsu y 4 de taekwondo (dos distintas sobre el eje 7) entonces creo que desde ah comienza todo, pues quienes comienzan en las artes marciales, sin conocer sistemas o alguien que los oriente, generalmente se van por el mas cercano a su casa.    Por otro lado, es deporte olmpico. Quiz suene tonto, pero a ?que padre no le gusta divagar con eso? esto en gran medida, impulsa que los padres inscriban a sus hijos peque?os.    En cuanto al karate, ya no hay tantas escuelas como antes (o quiz si las haba pero ya ganaron los del taekwondo) y hoy en da es mas dificil encontrar una "manejando por la calle" en comparacin a una de taekwondo.    Al menos esa es mi teora del porqu el nmero de practicantes.    ?Saludos!|`|NxLWsSj8aa	el karate nunca va a pasar de moda porque aunque ultimamente otras artes tienen mas popularidad muchas personas lo siguen practicando hoy en dia ademas de ser de las primeras artes marciales en ser conocidas en el continente por lo que la gente ya la ubica|`|JJihCXWtaa	las artes marciales no pasan de moda, si no, por que crees que tienen mas de tres mil a?os?, lo que sucede es que como lo dicen los demas, el TKD tiene mas difucion, por aquello de las olimpiadas, pero ya se estan haciendo arreglos para que el karate sea tambien deporte olimpico, yo llevo cerca de 25 a?os practicandolo, y te lo puedo asegurar.ademas siempre a aquellos que conocen que estan practicando artes marciales, les dicen "karatecas" no importa la diciplina que sean (TKD, judo, full,) , o conoces a alguno que a dicho '"mira ese es taekuandoin" en lugar de " mira ese es karateka"|`|VU6UOmzNaa	Como han contestad varios, lo que en realidad ocurre es que el TaeKwon Do ha tenido mucha mayor promocin, en los ltimos a?os, que el Karate.

En mi modesta opinin, lo que le a pasado a las artes marciales convencionales como el Karate o el Judo es que estn incompletas, me explico; el Karate a puesto nfasis en las pegadas de manos y piernas y el Judo en las proyecciones y las inmovilizaciones y han sido superadas por artes como el Ai ki do o el Ju jic so que son artes mas completas, cuando planteo que son mas completas me refiero a que utilizan tanto pegadas de piernas y brazos como proyecciones, inmovilizaciones o luxaciones. Dejo como referencia una de las artes marciales mas mortferas e efectiva que conozco, no es muy conocida ya que es un arte marcial, no un deporte, me refiero al Kei Sao que significa Purificacin del espritu mas conocida en occidente como (Kung Fu) pero por nada me refiero al Kung Fu que puedas ver en pelculas o en alguna seudo escuela, esta arte esta en otro nivel.|`|l6akhtDCaa	No se trata de haber pasado de modo es que de un tiempo a esta parte fueron apareciendo otros tipos de artes marciales con mas de lo que luce que el karate.Ademas existen pocos que ense?en el karate tradicional como se debe.-|`|mRtxqWr2aa	porque son mas comerciales      Las artes marciales no se estudian para ganar peleas,  ni para que las mujeres digan "que guapo estas, que fuerte eres, te mando un besito",  es un error hacerlo con esas intenciones las artes marciales se estudian con el  proposito de que nos ayuden a tener sano el cuerpo y el alma y asi ser capaces de vivir sana  y vigorosamente  pero si alguien quiere tratarnos mal haciendo uso de la fuerza, debemos defenderno|`|PFnlBEspaa	No ha pasado de moda, sl oque parece que ahora han salido muchas artes marciales que antes no eran tan conocidas|`|c556be65cdfd19a55c0aba0a562c4e85aa	el TaeKwon_Do es mas superior en tecnica y poder, pero  cualquier arte macial es veneficiario para las personar si uno las save , llaque uno logra un muy buen estado ficico equilibrio y frecxibilidad que si practicaras cualquier deporte pero te lleva mucho tiempo de practica y esfuerso.|`|u0tWZMJlaa	La esencia de un arte marcial es la que cuenta, no la moda, pero, por ejemplo en Mxico, las medallas olmpicas vienen del taekwondo, que hacen, sobre explotan el taekwondo, es un problema, pero no debes guiarte por las modas, el karate como mtodo de defensa es fantstico, el TKD como exhibicin es espectacular|`|twP5G2g1aa	Hola al igual que muchos que han cotestado el karate no pasa de moda lo que pasa es que no es tan redituable es dificil explicarlo pero lo que sucede actualmente no es muy distinto a lo sucedido en otras epocas siempre hay una tecnica nueva siempre haay alguien que quiere ganar dinero facil sorprendiendo la mayoria de las artes maciales son victimas del marketing muchos abusan y defraudan pero tambien gracias a estos piratas los buenos maestros son buscados y los estilos de combate se preservan todo depende del nivel de compromiso que tenga el aprendiz para consigo mismo y su ryu es una simbiosis los verdaderos maestros hay que buscalos entre los charlatanes y mercadologos para mucho es su sustento su chamba para los menos es el camino en la vida ejemplo:  En cierta oportunidad Musashi estaba en Akashi, provincia de Harima, cortando una madera para confeccionar un arco, cuando se present un samurai llamado Muso Gonnosuke Katsuyoshi para desafiarlo. Este era un samurai experto en las escuelas de Kenjiutsu Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ryu y Jikishinkage Ryu, su habilidad era tal, que nunca haba sido derrotado anteriormente, hasta que se encontr con Musashi. Gonnosuke estaba armado con un Odachi (sable largo) y en las solapas de su Haori (especie de saco grande que se pona sobre el kimono), llevaba escrito: "Heiho Tenka Ichi" (el mejor artista marcial de la tierra). Estaba rodeado por seis seguidores y comenz a alardear sobre que nadie era su igual. Le dijo: "hace a?os, en mis viajes, he visto las tcnicas de su padre, Munisai, pero todava no he visto las suyas". Musashi, que comenzaba a irritarse, le responde: "si usted vio las tcnicas de mi padre, las mas no son diferentes". Presumiendo ante sus estudiantes Gonnosuke presion an mas diciendo: "mis tcnicas no son para mostrrselas a cualquiera". Musashi le espet: "no importa como usted me ataque, yo lo detendr, sa es mi tcnica, haga lo que quiera y como quiera". Tomando una espada de madera de ms de 1,20 metros de largo, Gonnosuke inici sin ninguna formalidad un ataque feroz, pero Musashi camin directamente hacia l y lo golpe ligeramente entre los ojos con la vara como si fuese una espada. Gonnosuke se march raudamente.  Como se puede ver siempre hay alguien que le gusta vender lo importante es perdurar y dejar marca en la roca con compromiso de vida de otra manera sin importar toda la publicidad solamente seran pisadas en la arena
AA10405966	This article gives a good explaination of what occurred to get them tossed:  http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=...    Basically the umpire made an obstruction call against Ledezma, later he made comments to the umpire and he was ejected.  Leyland argued this call and he too was ejected.|`|065b430f4b4b9a58a8c14fa3b764d8c1aa	I didn't see the game, but with both of them ejected, it means that after a warning had been issued to both dugouts, the pitcher again seemed to intentionally throw too far inside and/or hit a batter.  Under those circumstances, both the pitcher and the manager are tossed.  It can't be argued.    A warning is issued by the umpire in chief of the game if he feels that a pitcher has deliberately hit a batter or deliberately thrown too far inside to a batter.  That pitcher is warned, and both dugouts are also warned.|`|ujoL8xjYaa	With runners on the corners, Torii Hunter grounded back to reliever Wil Ledezma. Ledezma trapped Michael Cuddyer off third, but was called for obstruction during the ensuing rundown, allowing the run to score.   After Jason Kubel followed with a two-run single to make it 8-3, Ledezma yelled at plate umpire Paul Nauert and was ejected. Leyland also was thrown out after Ledezma's ejection.|`|AA12041984	Basically they both said the "magic" word to get thrown out|`|AA10752797	ezgoin92 has the right answer.

AA11684735	Not in the least. Everyone wheres long shorts now and there are many in the NBA with a great deal of heart. Look at Allen  Iverson, he is all heart the way he drives the lane. Another example is Richard Hamilton. He wears long shorts and has a great deal of heart. Your argument is invalid...sorry.|`|ishPf2Glaa	Nope, sorry. There are numerous players in the league right now that are more focussed on community than the greats of the late 80s and early 90s ever were, yet the shorts are quite a bit longer.    The game has changed, the aura surrounding the game has changed. Hiphop is a real element in professional sports anymore, at least in basketball and football it is... I played basketball for about 15 years, and hated every time i wore those shorty shorts.... i always wore the long ones, but it was more about being comfortable and focussing 100% On my game...    Sorry, i gotta say that in my opinion, it does not hold validity...|`|fw7RSjUIaa	Watching Larry Bird and John Stockton play in daisy dukes almost made me puke in my mouth.  If I had a teenage daughter, I wouldnt let her leave the house with shorts that short.|`|wuv98xrvaa	No, the size of a player's heart can't be measured by the size of his shorts. The old players were great, but their shorts had nothing to do with their skill and attitude. Look at LeBron James, just watch him play and how he speaks about his teammates and winning. Kobe does amazing things too, but LeBron is an all around player and can leave any given game with 30-40 or more points and roughly 10 assists. He's bringing the Cav's to their first ever NBA Championship game versus the Spurs in only his fourth year in the NBA. Michael Jordan got to wear both sizes and was great with either size. The shorts have changed with time, not the players.        Watch LeBron in Game 1 tonight at 9 ET on abc!!! You'll see what I mean.
fmTqxRvSaa	Great question.    I think he would do a great job. He definitely knows personnel and basketball.    The most important factor is his desire to win so I think he would do a good job of putting a championship calibur team every year on the court.    I think Kobe might like that..|`|PRuFQMFsaa	it's fine with me... as long as he doesn't trade kobe bryant, that would totally stupidddddddddd!!!|`|0pyisSWTaa	in the Lakers' current state, i'd take Jack Nicholson over who we have now...    but yeah, Magic would do a great job|`|BIBkoAegaa	I am not so sure that HE wants to get into the everyday routine of being a General Manager. I think they need to bring in someone who has experience in evaluating talent and that has a good sense of the salary cap to assist in bringing the team back to a competitive-level.    I think Magic would be a great marketing advantage for recruiting players and building a fan base, but not so sure about the nuts and bolts of the daily routine of running a huge organization.|`|GdvzZRFMaa	That would be a plus for them but I would love to see Jerry West back with them in some capacity.|`|Qbnzb8R7aa	he and Kobe get along fairly well from what I remember, so that might work.      as long as he's not as bad at it as he was at being a talk show host|`|q6UlwHKtaa	i think good for them. he is an all time great. he will be good for them|`|ishPf2Glaa	It would be nice to see his face in the Laker organization again, as it brought alot of heart and love to the team.

Hopefully he would know how to set his foot down with some..... innapropraite antics...... that are being displayed on the team.
dXpxKVRfaa	No. It was a terrible decision. They should have went to the corner for at least the first 2 plays if not a third too. If that didn't work, take the 3. Points are points.     Terrible decision to throw that quick slant.|`|fjNxzd6Baa	I can blame the interception on Warner, but the return for a touchdown is on the whole team on the field on that play. Somebody had to be able to push him out of bounds at least.|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	Obviously it played a major role.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	The play hurt, but it didn't cost them the game because they recovered the lead in the 4th quarter.    It was a bad pass, but I've got to put some blame on Olsen for the play call. They should have run the ball, and kicked the FG if the TD didn't happen, but if they insist on passing the fade to Fitzgerald in the corner of the endzone is money. Throwing a slant there is a recipe for a pick 6.    BAD PLAY CALL|`|u1tusTZ0aa	no because he never should have thrown it. There was 3 defenders right there and it was first down. I'd rather he took the sack than threw that pass. Otherwise he had a great game but I can't feel bad for him.    That and the Arizona D could have won the game but they didn't so it isn't really Warner's fault.|`|kNCfeSkZaa	No, the defenses' inability to put Rothlesberger on the ground with 2:34 left in the game is what cost them the game.|`|gU4VdD6Oaa	No. There's no feeling bad in football.    I feel great for Warner that he had an incredible season and is now talked about as a possible Hall of Famer. Quite an accomplishment for a guy who was bagging groceries a decade ago.|`|2TUKo7ryaa	yes they should of ran the ball in|`|Vp3Lxg4taa	The Cards had the lead in the 4th Q with 2 minutes left, how did the final Steeler score become Kurt's fault?|`|ULw1777caa	Yes, it did.  That proved to be the difference.|`|XLXncQu9aa	I do think that the 1st half interception was a play that caused the Steelers in the 2nd half with the momentum they needed to win, however it wasn't the play that cost them the game.  As you saw last night like we all did, the Cardinals played a lot better offensively to get back in the game and actually take the lead.  What costs the Cardinals the game was the drive before the 2:00 minute warning when the Steelers made the final score to seal the deal.  What I am getting at is that the Cardinals offense on that drive gave up the yardage that allowed the Steelers to get in the end-zone and when.  So to me that was the moment that caused the Cardinals to lose.  One could also say that the Warner fumbler caused the loss, but realistically I don't think the Cardinals would have won had the fumble not be caused.
98bupiDFaa	If he wasn't already giving 100% of himself before that speech...then why is he playing football at that level?

I think he was just trying to get his teammates fired up more than anything.
JKbvnwcDaa	If they are in the right situation with experienced coordinators.|`|UxooffHZaa	Definitely. But, it can be over done. Morris really has nowhere near the resume or interest Tomlin had coming into the Steelers. I trust the Rooney's to pick a good young coach. Most NFL teams, I don't trust to pick good coaches. Look at how Norv Turner is still coaching, even with proven failure.    When the Steelers pick a young coach, you can guarantee it's the right pick. They don't pick young just for the sake of picking young.|`|AA11828439	Nope, it only proves that Tomlin got it done. Every person should be judged on their abilities, not the abilities of others.|`|oYsSL991aa	No.  Tomlin inherited a good team from cowher.    Young head coaches rarely do good with bad teams (The only exceoption is the guy from Miami)    Jon Harbaugh inhereted a good team that just had one bad season with injuries and Mike Smith got lucky with Matt Ryan|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	I absolutely HATEEEEEEEEEEE the Pittsburgh Steelers more then anyone on this website but I do like Mike Tomlin and respect him a great deal.  I must say though, Carl Smith that works at Johnnies Pizza could have won a ring last night with the way that game was officiated.|`|xGofrX5Iaa	With the help of 7 refs I could have gotten it done.
cOPCNP7Laa	That is a shallow evaluation of the team. The reason they underperformed in past years is due to the simple fact that they concentrated on the Champion's League, as evidenced by their great record in that competition.    This has been admitted by Galliani and Ancelotti with no remorse. This season they are still in the title race and can well still surpass Inter to win the Scudetto and coincidentally the Scudetto has been signified as THE target to achieve for the team this season.    Yes of course, their player policy THEN might play a role, but Maldini being 40 (thank you very much) still plays better than Materazzi or a bunch of Juve defenders such as Grygera.|`|zakIuo91aa	Hell ya, man .

ENBhz7Asaa	My OU Sooners by far.  The Oregon game was horrible.  Not only did the refs miss the fact that an Oregon player touched the onside kick before going 10 yards, but they also missed that an OU player actually recovered the ball anyway.  On top of that, the refs upstairs in the booth missed it.  Also, the Texas Tech game in '05 was taken from OU because of 2 missed calls in which the refs in the booth didn't overturn the bad calls by the refs on the field.  Let's also not forget about the roughing the quarterback calls against OU in '08's texass game.  At least those bad calls didn't keep OU from winning that game.  The Oregon and Tech games were taken from OU by corrupt refs with agendas that I don't even understand.|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	Yes, I agree that the Sooners have gotten the short end of the stick way too often.

Lpmd9M8Iaa	1. Practice with the cue ball on an otherwise empty pool table. Place it a comfortable distance from a bumper and strike it just to the right of the center point. Experiment with the motion until you know how much right English to put on the ball to get the result you want.     2. Add an object ball. Using right English, shoot the cue ball into the object ball, then watch where the cue ball travels.     3. Test your ability to read English by trying to send the cue ball to a specific location after it strikes the object ball.     4. Continue to practice until you're comfortable reading how much English you need to put on the cue ball in order to place it where you want it. Learning this skill will greatly increase your ability to line up the next shot.     5. Play a pool game using your new right English skills to control the movements of the cue ball. Perfect your new right hand English skills while you play.

So its not that she started late its just that she has hung around a LONG LONG time... but GOOD LUCK to you anway.... I would not tell your parents you want to go to the Olympics because they may think that is unreasonable but work hard and SHOW them that you are serious and want to be a good gymnast.
PXkvDyYwaa	What brand of tube is it? I know Bontrager and a couple others had some problems with thin spots with tubes and they would explode right around the pressure you are saying.    The other thing could be the tire lever is "pinching" the tube when you put it in. If you can muscle it on by hand, it works better.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	When you install the tube, make sure that you put enough air in the tube to inflate it a little before you put it inside the tire. If there is no air in the tube, it is very easy to pinch it between the tire bead and the rim. Tubes cannot hold pressure, the only reason for them to pop is improper installation.|`|0oD59Xrbaa	Is it exploding or just leaking right away?  It could be a number of things.  Some of the most common might be that you are wiggling the valve too much causing a tear in the valve stem. There may also be something stuck in the tire. A fold in the tube could also cause problems since the tube is the wrong size for the tire you are using.|`|9FidnEvAaa	Ordinary  700c or road bike tubes can handle up to 110 lbs psi, so check tubes manufacturers psi recommendation usually written on the box of the tube or in the tube itself. It might be different from the other brand.    80 psi is only minimum to other brands, try to use IRC, Tioga tubes.|`|CttL3LmBaa	Could be a pinch flat, they happen fast.  Could be some foreign material in your tire. Carefully check the inside of the tire.    Check the tube.  If it just lets go with the pressure in a large leak, look at the tube.  If you see 2 holes -- pinch flat.  Pinch flats happen when you mount the tire and you literally pinch the tube in the bead of the tire.|`|wPFvyDLEaa	also it helps if you put a little baby powder on the tube that stops friction. May not be the problem, but it has worked for me in the past.|`|mKAGg4otaa	try going a bit less (maybe like 77 psi) or get a different brand of tubes

Note: do NOT shovel snow near your ramp.. if you miss your ramp you go into the grass, you are rudely ejected from your craft.    Secondly, pack the snow as hard as possible, this can be best achieved by stomping or using the shovels.

Because he's not lost with Chivas since he came back, he's been consistent, Chivas have not lost since the Interliga with Michel in the porteria. So to me, as of now, yeah, Michel is the best.    But, when you look at overall, I do think that Guillermo Ochoa is the best Mexican Goalkeeper as of latest times. I don't think it's Sanchez, I think it's Ochoa. But yeah, as of right now, I think it's Michel, but as of latest times, I think it's Ochoa.|`|HZ8KkQKWaa	NEVER....he is good but not that good|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	I heard that too on the radio, and did you hear the other guy get his panties in a bunch saying "Memo Ochoa is mejor que el, no no puedes decir eso Jorge"     Put it this way, there is some great competition in the Mexican porteria, and the top 4 in NO ORDER is Ochoa, Michel, Corona, and Sanchez.

wYGeg0QRaa	Burton my wife was getting her choice of irons as a present. She plays to a 12 hdcp. and would be lower if she could putt. She had her mind set on a set of x22's to replace her x18's. I told her not to get ahead of herself and weigh all options. After looking at everything she settled on Rhapsody irons from Ping and she wasn't even thinking Ping when we started looking. She absolutely loves what these clubs do for her game. After relating this story to a friend he checked out the Raptures and is absolutely delighted with the clubs. If the clubs have a weakness it may be the wide soles off of tight lies so if you play regularly at courses with real tightly mown fairways you may want to look at the G10's instead another good one from Ping. Rhapsody irons are the ladies model of the Raptures.|`|Wa7wktLkaa	i personally do not like them, but boy are the easy to hit. the wide soles are unbelievable they're like hitting a hybrid. they are the most forgiving club on the market imo. not for me though. i prefer forged or blades.|`|RDbEA4zbaa	I like that the swingweight(inside emblem)is directly behind the face with the Pings and can be changed to your swingweight preference by Ping.   www.ebayoyo.com

BXuT6VTBaa	Hey, I was like you, back before well last year. any way. there was this girl on my squad, she was pretty, but she couldn't fly if her life depended on it. I was an excellant flyer, and also a great tumbler. My coach had said that perhaps I might be too big. (that could be your problem.) so I went to a gym, and became the skinniest girl on my squad. Only then did I realize, that coaches may pay attention to how you do in practice, but you have to confront them with the idea of flying. As it so happens that the girl on my squad i mentioned earlier was smaller than me, and my best friend as well. I wanted the spot though. So after practice I approached my coach and calmly explained to her all of the reasons I sould be a flyer and how hard I had been working.   She let me fly, but my best friend was very upset. It was easy to make up with her though, because we were truely best friends and no matter how mad we were, we couldn't stay mad at each other for very long.   Over the summer though I grew, so no I'm basing, and I love it more than you can imagine. Often bases don't get the credit that they deserve. In honest truth. I think basing ws harder than flying had ever been. Doing back flips out of a basket toss was so easy compared to making sure that the stunt and the flyer went up perfect risking your lif to dive and save them.  But if you really wan't to be a flyer, the best thing I can say is (a) learn to tumble (b) become extremely flexible and stay very small, and in the end, the hard work pays off.

5d93WhEIaa	The harder you throw the ball the more revs you create, thus you will still go brooklyn.  Depending on the lane condition you bowl on the usual stop you hit may just be find.  It sounds like the ball you have hooks more than the last one.  If you were looking at the 3rd arrow try to move left with your feet and hit the middle arrow.  Looking further down the lane, moving left, breaking your wrist, throwing the ball softer, and shining/polishing the ball, all will help the ball travel further down the lane before it starts to hook back.  Practice all of these things before tourny and see what feels best.  I would take the old ball.  Finally bowling great is 90% confidence!!!  If all else fails throw fast and hard and pray : )  any questions just email me. The key to bowling w/ 3 fingers is not trying to hook the ball into your thumb falls out...after it passes your ankle.  It takes some work so I why for now I would just stick to what you know and remeber lane conditions change all the time move left if your high and right if your light
9GzkVwfGaa	Paul Maurice|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	It was discussed earlier (Joe's Question)     Next coach fired? Not a whole lot of guys on the hotseat really! Therrien but they just re-upped his contract in the summer and if they were going to do it then it would have already happened probably.     Scott Gordon? Tony Granato (injuries have been a part of that though)? John Anderson? Barry Trotz?     Interesting because usually you could name 4 or 5 guys on thin ice but it's not the case right now.       Regardless of his situation, I will say Therrien.|`|DvBPLP4saa	I don't think Hartsburg should have been the one getting fired.    Maybe Bryan Murray should do the world a favor a just fire himself.

Someone drop the axe on him now, PLEASE, before he destroys the Sens even more.      BONUS: If the Pens continue on a downward spiral then I'll say Michel Therrien. (Though, I do not want the Pens to continue going downhill I do want Therrien to hit the road. A trained monkey could have coached the load of talent the Pens had last season.

ZbNXVQu7aa	If Bynum misses the entire postseason, it's within the realm of possibility that the Lakers don't even make the Western Conference Finals, especially if this injury costs the Lakers the  1 seed.    I can actually envision the Spurs (and/or Hornets) leaping past the Lakers in the conference standings because of an unfortunate injury to Bynum, and if the Lakers fall to the  3 seed, that means they won't even have home court in the second round because there's no way the Spurs or Hornets will lose in the first round.  Without home court, the Lakers won't beat the Spurs or Hornets in a 7-game series.  With home court, the Bynum-less Lakers have (at best) a 50/50 shot of beating the Hornets, but the Lakers still won't beat the Spurs in an odd year without him.    That's a long explanation for a short answer, I know, but now you know what's going through my mind when I say the Lakers won't even get to the NBA Finals without Bynum.|`|P93I8CHtaa	no they wont|`|e8998d8c8bdf12a545b0dfe2fd77052caa	They have a very solid team, with a very good bench. It's too early to predict if they will go all the way  By the way I just the Knicks-Lakers game, and Kobe dropped in a mere 61 points. He and Gasol looked awesome.  Have a good day!|`|IJ7vle8Vaa	Denver Nuggets win it all...    just kidding i think one of the east teams will win it|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	It can happen again.|`|Or43gwRjaa	Its all about what Kobe Bryant Shows up for the Finals. Has he matured?|`|dCiVtR37aa	yes they will fall short b/c they probably will have to face the cavs|`|qOWJQ7hRaa	hopefully not.|`|w0u9K3hOaa	Yes|`|25ymUKdraa	anything can happen in the finals|`|i5MInqeMaa	Lakers have to prove that they have learned from their beating last year in the post season.|`|XrCc85kNaa	No...  The Lakers will win it all!!!!!!!|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	i think the Celtics are the best team right now. the Lakers are not even in the Top 5 anymore. they have become irrelevant.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	They won't make the finals without Bynum.|`|xHc3KGDmaa	yes I think the Celtics will win again|`|mFSfXig1aa	NO Lakers will defenatlywin this year. The Lakers might be is the same situation as last year were Bynum was gone BUT the lakers have more experience this year and they will know how to play in the playoffs. Since its not the first year that they might not have Bynum they already have expericenc and they will get the championship this season.|`|hzttr76Maa	The Lakers still have a chance to top the West, and I think they eventually will. But considering the loss of Bynum, they have one less interior body to guard the post. The team now was similar to last year's team. We just have to wait and see.|`|keUqPWVuaa	The Lakers aren't even going to get to the Final, it's an odd year, everyone keeps forgetting odd years are San Antonio years the Spurs are going to win the title this year.|`|tY3rZSsiaa	if they can even make it there in the first place.  in the playoffs, anything can happen.  theres a lot of playoff experienced teams in hte west, you never know what will happen from now till then, whether it be trades or injuries or a team getting chemistry and heating up.|`|AsvVWfiHaa	let's be honest about this....their finish WILL depend on the health of Andrew Bynum. Bynum, is the single biggest difference between this year's Lakers and last year's losers to Boston...and it's plain that the Lakers are clearly a much better team with Bynum on the floor.   over the last few games, Bynum has doubled his points per game output, including a 42 pts and 15 reb performance against the Clippers. his production continued to increase, becoming more and more important to the success of the Lakers...not to mention his size and toughness gives the Lakers a totally different presence in the paint. they would simply be a much tougher team and therefore a more formidable opponent to the Celtics.   the only way I can see the Lakers winning it all without Bynum is for Lamar Odum to step up to the next level and finally be the player that he was expected to be....but it won't happen.
rNUyV1EYaa	The Steelers won fair and square. BUT:    There were many questionable calls on the Cardinals. And they should have at least reviewed the last play; even though there were only 5 seconds left at the time.    Regardless, the Cardinals had a chance to win. It's easy to blame the officials, but if they held on for a 23-20 win, none of this talk would be occuring.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Yes.|`|wYdHeAE9aa	Won fairly and lost unfairly. (calls on Cards were okay, no calls on steelers not ok)|`|MaizmvvMaa	Yes    NFL vice president of officiating Mike Pereira confirmed that Kurt Warner fumbled on the Cardinals' last play of the Super Bowl.  Announcer Al Michaels claimed there was a quick booth review at the end and Pereira confirmed that as well. Neither Warner nor head coach Ken Whisenhunt believed there was a review and both were quite miffed about it after the game. The odds of a Hail Mary touchdown were incredibility slim, but Pereira's confirmation about the review and the fumble at least offer some closure to an epic game.|`|JmKPNP3Qaa	yes and all the cardinal fan have to suck it up and deal with it!|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i think it was a missed call along with the missed prop call and the missed call on harrisons punches thrown. pierra always backs up the muffed calls as correct so i am not surprised he has come out with that claim. did it change who won or lost? that i don't know.|`|gYFA9TKSaa	NO|`|zy9XbvSraa	I think it was played fairly but they should have reviewed that fumble!|`|u7GBP579aa	yes, it was played fairly. I thought that the refs did a terrific job of catching all the foul play and penalties. The only penalty I noticed though is that when Santonio Holmes scored that last score, during his celebration he used the ball as a prop and that is a penalty. Which would have caused the steelers to kickoff from there 20 yard line which would have given the cards great field position that last drive. The game could have ended differently if that was called|`|Jp2415Whaa	Yes and No.  Yes: Steelers had good gameplay and ultimately Cardinals' constant holding penalties gave them the game.    No: Sorry to ruin your moment Steeler fans, but I know you all have eyes, and all of you know there were a few calls that just flew by the dumb zebras.  Now, I cant tell you that with those calls called it woulda been AZ bowl, but who is anyone to assume, "Oh who cares about that call, chances of anything being done if it's called are low." Thing is there is a chance.  That is all.|`|pWvGbTdcaa	Yes, this game will always be remembered for being a great SB, with a great ending.|`|AvGd8FAEaa	No way worst example of officiating ever. when the ref called that phony "unnecessary roughness on the holder" call? after one of the cards players stumbled over the ball handler after tripping, i was disgusted. also when the refs turned a blind eye after james harrison beat up a cards player in the second half. The officials handed the trophy to the Steelers before the game even started
JHcqLEJUaa	Team sports help in many aspects of peoples lives.  The game promotes healthy exercise, promotes teamwork.  It can be a lifelong sport too.  Many people start as kids and end up teaching their own children or even grandchildren.  The number of injuries for simple activities like bike riding and playing on a trampoline are far higher than hockey.(link below)  I would find out who the coach is and ask him/her to call your parents and talk with them.|`|rvE7gyuUaa	You have taken the first step to convincing them by gather information to support your argument.  I would establish a time when you can all sit down without distractions.  Be very honest about your feelings because if you parents care enough to stop you from playing, they care about your feelings too.  Tell them you have some reasons and you would appreciate if they listen and hear you out.  Start with the physical and emotional benefit of exercising, discipline, and teamwork.  Discuss the fact that hockey is one of the safest team sports.  Finally, convince them hockey will make you more responsible.  Good luck.|`|264GS7s7aa	tell them how much you love it.|`|BhXMno7faa	It is very rare that someone gets hurt playing hockey. You have all the equipment that will make it so you don't get hurt.|`|9i4Rxqknaa	You wear a lot of equipment to keep you from getting hurt in hockey. You can still get banged up a little from time to time, but rarely are there serious injuries. You can get just as hurt tripping over your own two feet while walking down the street as you can from playing hockey.

It is an official site though - not one of those that anybody can enter whatever information they want into.      Another thumbs down.  Ha ha...      http://www.brisnet.com/cgi-bin/gen_stati...|`|QgZvtSz1aa	If your horses tattoos are legible (on the inside of the upper lip), call the Jockey Club (they'll be registered there) and they will give you everything known about the horse. There will be a fee on it though, $20-30, but I had it done on a mare I bought and they gave me loads of information from races, purse money, any time she was bred, pedigree, children, brothers/sisters and their records, breeders/owners/trainers, etc. Thats the best way to go because on the website, you might not find everything if no one put the information in! Good Luck!
1XEUETPKaa	I would probably want to start of maybe in Portugal or the Dutch league, then get scouted into La Liga in Spain or Serie A in Italy, and eventually end my career in the English Premier League.     The Portuguese and Dutch leagues are easier to get into and from then on get scouted into higher and more competitive leagues:    like Huntelaar from Ajax Amsterdam [Dutch League] went to Real Madrid [La Liga in Spain]    Nani and CR came from Sporting Lisbon and Deco came from FC Porto, both in the Portuguese League. Now Nani and CR play for Manchester United, and Deco played for Barcelona and now Chelsea.     It seems to be the most reasonable route to success.|`|iAuQGNKnaa	start in Turkey(cuz I'm Turkish), get real good and go to a good country in Europe (England, Germany, Italy, Spain, etc.)|`|AA11510511	I would choose to play for the English Premiere League.

fgqghe4yaa	Neither of them are good trades.  Granger will be nursing a knee injury that may by day-to-day when he comes back.  Granger and Jackson isn't enough to give up CP3 and Smith and Scola are great for rebounds and blocks.  Pick up Tyson Chandler 1 week before he is ready.  You might want to take a look at Hawes because if Brad Miller (he most likely will) gets traded Hawes's fantasy value will shoot up.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	No way - Danny Granger has an injured knee and you would be taking a big risk to trade for him.|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	i think you would be crazy to make either trade...give up CP3...are you kidding me!!|`|1326cb00e49de27af7fc131cb4f406dfaa	I think the only transaction you make the rest of the way is you drop telfar and pick up fernandez.  guy is a stud.  telfar cant do the things rudy can

L77OlY1naa	Pedro is much better...As far as Ollie we will see when we play the Nats or the Marlins dude cannot pitch in worthless games..Pedro is still up for grabs.Ollie is 12 years younger then Pedro lets just have 6 starters this year one can get the boot to the bullpen mmm..... Niese|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	No i didnt want him, I rather of had Lowe or Sheets but the deed it done.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	He had no decisions in half his starts (showing that he got in trouble and pulled quite a bit,  and bailed out by the bats)  and could barely manage double digit wins on a good team (oh,  and barely .500 as well).   Add to this a ton of walks (a pathetic WHIP in general actually) and you get a pitcher that is disaster waiting to happen.    I wouldnt have spent money on him at all.|`|3PUjsooKaa	Eh, it's okay. I would've liked to see a combo of Ben Sheets and either Dunn or Abreu, but on the other hand I want to see Daniel Murphy get a lot of playing time. I wish they could've found a suitor for Castillo, then they could've either signed Hudson or put Murphy at 2nd and sign an OF. But, we'll have to make do with Ollie. Repeat of 2004? I don't know, when Rick Peterson left Ollie looked a lot more comfortable...|`|FfIqGrdkaa	the way i see it, Perez had an ERA under 1 last year agaisnt the Phillies, they took out Burrell and added Ibunez(another lefty) he may be worth it just for the 3 starts he makes a agaisnt the Phillies next year.

L77OlY1naa	A no hitter is very exciting when a No hitter  goes into the 8th Inning it doesn't matter what team you like or hate you root for that guy to do it.All it makes me think about is the movie a perfect game and knowing there is so much going through his head.Coming from a Met fan I have never witnessed a no-hitter for my team but I love to watch them         A cycle is truly only important to the fans of that team.    A No-Hitter is a part of history a cycle truly isn't|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	I liked watching Jose hit for the cycle but a no hiter is what I dream of !|`|u1T5TQP7aa	no-hitter by far!!! i didn't even need to contemplate this|`|hR87A418aa	no hitter is way better its amazing to watch 2 -3 hours of 1 guy not letting 9 guys get a hit thats just crazy|`|YRkjw7kDaa	Bubbles I think you reversed it...there was a few cycles last yr...Beltre hit for the cycle and he sucks|`|V430UrvFaa	The media makes it that if there is a no hitter, there will be much more media attention, hitting for the cycle seems to be forgotten. No hitters are very rare today, since hitting has taken over a great part of the game.|`|0E8SPyyXaa	Throwing a no hitter is|`|AVeKMM5Taa	a no-no becuase every one will talk about it|`|ivbnPxSKaa	depends to what team you throw the no hitter agaisnt and what pitchers you hit your cycle off of|`|sHXazyDWaa	No-no. You have to face at least 27 batters and not a single one to get on base via a hit, while when hitting for the cycle, you need to put 4 batted balls in the perfect location, for a no-no, you'll need to put 100 pitches where you wan them to go. Hitting for the cycle is more common, it usually happens 3-6 times a year today while you usually get 1 or 2 no-nos a year.|`|cBJfldtEaa	Cycle is harder  No hitter is more fun to watch|`|5xIroQjMaa	No hitter is more impressive from an occurence standpoint, though it's not as wide a margin as people think. Since 1875, only 256 no-hitters have ever been thrown, while in that same period of time, there have been 284 players hitting for the cycle, so it's a slightly more common occurence.     However, there has only been three players to hit for the cycle 3 times (Babe Herman, Bob Musial, John Reilly). 21 players have done it 2 times. So while the cycle does happen more often, it's harder to repeat itself, as there are no Nolan Ryan's of the cycle.    Now, the real kicker is to compare the position player to pitcher ratio. When you realize that there are far more hitters than pitchers, then the cycle truly becomes a rarity, statistically speaking. And looking at it in that sense, then the cycle is far more impressive.|`|c03fc4c1b513dca7edce30261069af11aa	The No-No is tougher|`|klOl7Q6Laa	no hitter by far|`|00aaPLCjaa	i say and think it is the a no hitter and hitting of the cycle those both really cool but my answer is no hitter|`|stnNJQ8yaa	Objectively speaking, hitting for the cycle is probably more difficult.  Any time you throw a no-no, you're bound to have gotten bunch of help defensively from the rest of your team.  When hitting for the cycle, it's just you, and you can't reach base by an error, because it's not considered a hit.      Impressiveness, however, has to go to the no-no, and even more so, to the perfect game.  It's just exciting to watch and is much more pressure filled.  When batting for the cycle, you just swing the bat and hope for the best.  Whe you're in the midst of a no-hitter, you have lots of time to think and get inside your own head.    So that's it.  Cycle is harder, no-no is more impressive|`|V25THlPKaa	The cycle is an incredible feat but there's a tremendous amont of luck involved.      The no-hitter shows the dominance of a pitcher -- for one game anyway.|`|PkCqIfMFaa	Throwing a no-hitter is just amazing being able to not have one ball fall onto the field that allows a runner to reach base is just absolutely amazing. You are constantly at the end of your seat during a baseball game! It's great because you are just waiting and waiting for that one wrong pitch. (of course there are walks but still!)|`|tvuhGTD9aa	The no-hitter. That's a complete game, complete team effort, with a dash of helpful luck tossed in.    Cycles have never impressed me all that much. Sure, it's nice, getting four hits, three for extra bases, certainly it's doing things well for the night -- but, really, so what? Other than the curiosity of having one of each type of hit, there's little different from any other four hit / some for extras game. It's the sort of accomplishment that gets added to the record book but only the diehard baseball geeks will remember, outside of it being done by a home team player.    No-hitters get remembered far more readily.|`|jOEuk9U2aa	No-Hitter!!!!!!!|`|FPjIOlSAaa	cycle it only happens once in a couple years but a no hitter happens like 3-4 times a year|`|EDsIBCfiaa	no hitter DUH|`|5yZICXImaa	Definitely No-Hitter.

There is nothing wrong with admitting one's fear. I mean, Liverpool fans have PREMIERPHOBIA.

All i said is I don't like the whole "men + men = zizi in @ss"!! If you do then ok, I think it's morally wrong (as regards to my likings and standards) and gross.

7ACBEowxaa	well, you make a great point, i dont know why vince always.....wait i think i do get why vince makes taker face big guys, cause if taker faced guys who were smaller base, it would look like a squash match. so taker faces guys who are just as big, or even bigger than him, to see if he will overcome the odds, which he always does, but if he went and faced kozlov,  streak vs streak match, that would be pretty good, but kozlov, lets face it, his streak will never be matched as it was with goldberg, and many guys can make a debut and have an unbeaten winning streak for a while. most of them do, its just that kozlov's head is just as big as his body, and vince likes it, and kozlov is also a great MMA style fighter,     but if taker faces HBK, a guy who calls himself Mr. Wrestlemania, a legend also, up their in the ranks of taker,  it has never happened, many of the  fans want it to happen, but it is almost certain, that no matter who faces taker at WM, nobody will break his record.|`|rJMZdp04aa	Your Prophecy Shall come to Pass.

a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	I'm not sure. It's very close. This one might have been more entertaining at times, and Harrison's play was even more impressive to me than Tyree's, but I think you have to consider the situation last year with the Patriots being undefeated.    What I can say without a doubt is that, as good as Super Bowl 34 and Super Bowl 25 were, 42 and 43 were even better. Best two Super Bowls I've ever seen.|`|7Z25Rmxoaa	No. last years game was a clean game, not that many penalties|`|vFasAFBUaa	Last year was better, biggest upset in the history of Super Bowls|`|06TvcksDaa	Both great games, I am inclined as an Ohio State (Santonio Holmes) and Steelers fan to go with 43.   It is like all my football interests came together into one game.  As far as without bias, I think it does go to 42, though.|`|6ldgFxhxaa	No way. There was over 100 yards of penalties just on the cardinals there is no debate.|`|qAqsz3bBaa	last years i think was a lot better.|`|2pxGPcxaaa	giants shocked the world. steelers didnt shock anybody.|`|OpOqqlGXaa	I'm a Patriots fan and even I think 42 was far superior. 43 definitely had it's share of great plays, but I think the lack of a major storyline heading into this game is what made it less interesting than 42. Great game, but not better than Giants vs. Patriots...|`|od3cDlqSaa	Not at alllll. last years superbowl was intense|`|TsRgRLuiaa	last years superbowl was way better......it was better to watch because no one ever thought the giants would ever win lol

iw3v5bgIaa	If I remember correctly, Dominic Hasek started at about 13 yrs. old and became one of the most successful (if not unorthodox) goalies in the NHL.    If you want to play ice hockey, learn to skate well (forward, backwards, even sideways) without a stick before complicating matters (and possibly frustrating you) by integrating passing, shooting and puck handling into your game.    My advise is to get the skating down before investing in equipment.    If you are ready for equipment, check out the site below for equipment deals, discounts, close outs, new product lines and training aids to DVDs at great prices:    http://www.squidoo.com/sports-hockey-equ...|`|S6yubRpNaa	hockey is a very difficult and dangerous sport to play. my advice is to really think about if you want to play or not. equipment is expensive, and so is playing. hockey is one of the most expensive sports.    if you really want to play, keep skating to keep yourself conditioned. but hockey isnt just skating. and the fact that you dont own a stick or a puck isnt a good start. buy yourself a stick and a puck and practice handling the puck. while skating, practice crossing over, skating backwards, and stopping.|`|axxQzOCHaa	It's never too late.   Get in touch with your local rink and see about a learn-to-play / in-house league.   For used gear, try Play it Again Sports (known as Sports Recuperation in Quebec)  or Craig's List ( www.craigslist.org ) and search for the Montreal site, once there, put in hockey in your for sale / wanted query.

mUG8XtNpaa	Nothing was different about the way Harrison played last night than the way he's played all year. He's part of a defense that's taught to hit hard, make big plays and create turnovers. He got a little physical, but for god's sakes, disgruntled fans who are crying over the outcome of the game will look for anything to use against Pittsburgh and try to turn the outcome around in their minds.|`|e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	Brawls happen. Not saying it's right, but they happen. But that makes him anything but a chicken. I'm sure if the guy was his size or bigger he'd have still got into a fight. But they were punished accordingly with a 15 yard penalty. But still, Steelers won.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	No, he is a heck of a player. But that was a cheap shot. Even John Madden said he should have been ejected for that.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	check this out...... 56 helped him score a TD that he shouldnt have scored too.  BLANTANT block in the back at 18 seconds, top of your screen    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcSvDCGAd...|`|aGNjZmyJaa	James Harrison- Defensive player of the year.      Oh no, Chad C has started his whining rants.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	he was playing agressive mean football. which is exactly wht football is meant for no matter wht size u are.  he still shoulda been ejected for the punching an hitting after the play but theres no such thing as picking on a smaller player in football|`|pWvGbTdcaa	No, but he shouldn't of done that. He's not a chicken when he goes against o-lineman all the time.|`|8h3tSUYuaa	Should of been suspended.|`|RK9bJPOmaa	He is more den a chicken. He is a punk for doing that.  He should have been suspended and kicked out of the Super Bowl.|`|OUKKNF1eaa	defensive player of the year!|`|o7E9LxV8aa	i agree|`|M5ykrN4Laa	Yes i believe he should got ejected huge interceptin return or not, if your going to act like a frikin *** hole thene yes he is a little *****|`|kV53Roz1aa	With all the scuffles that occurred during the game I don't think we saw the full story on what happened with the Harrison "fight."    I was raised a Steeler's fan and I don't think what happened was right but I also know from playing football for a long time that it's easy to lose your head in the heat of a game.    And no, he should not have been kicked out.  The refs made their bed when they allowed the participants of all the scuffles to continue playing... they couldn't kick someone out at that point.|`|WTQtchbvaa	First of all watch a video of it. The guy punch Harrison in the nuts. I thought it was a personal foul and agreed that he should have been suspended, but when I watched the video, He jabbed at the guys shoulder pad once and held him down, when the guy tried to get back up, he pancaked him. Many of you probably didn't see this but even Peter King mentioned that in the beginning of the second Q, a Cardinal threw a haymaker and wasn't even called for a penalty (probably because nobody saw it).
usltkMnwaa	They got in over their heads and too big for their britches. I didn't even know Arizona still had a team. haha!|`|2ZAzoKfraa	For the first time in a verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry long time, Cardinal fans have something to be proud of.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Yes..  They should be mad at the refs!!!!!|`|xHc3KGDmaa	they should be upset they did not win but proud of the fine season they had|`|J8uhpecYaa	Yes. They would've won if they hadn't thrown that interception that was returned for a touchdown in the second quarter. However, unlike the Seattle Seahawks three years ago, they can't blame the refs.|`|Jp2415Whaa	When you say fair weather fans, what exactly are you trying to prove?  I guarantee you're not from AZ, therefore you have no clue how it is to be in a state with just one football team that has failed for SO long.  Don't give em that bs.  They've stayed in AZ for a long time and finally their team does good, who gives a crap if they're "fare" weather fans...? They've finally got a team that can do some good.|`|4d40c0ff93b1f383704442cd34eff5a1aa	Not at all!! They fought a hard fight and with them even being in the Super Bowl is a great feat! I mean - who can be upset about a 100 yard interception that resulted in a Steeler's touchdown? They still made it into the record book...
mUG8XtNpaa	Dallas fans were even more pissed off last night. Most of them wanted Arizona to win, simply because:    A) Dallas had more success offensively against Arizona than they did Pittsburgh, and:    B) They didn't want Pittsburgh breaking the tie they had with Dallas for the most Super Bowl wins ever.    Well, that's life!|`|Ohlnx99Caa	Actually, people ordained the Patriots as the best team before the season. After they lost Tom Brady in the first week, the Cowboys took over. If you look it up, the Patriots were favored by Las Vegas to win the Super Bowl. They are actually the favorite again to win Super Bowl XLIV.|`|hHI0Vktxaa	I think more people ordained the Patriots the best team in the NFL in the beginning of the season, and they went 1-1 (Lost to Pittsburgh 33-10 and crushed Arizona 47-7)|`|XnbcCgboaa	Phili beat them both and beat the Giants twice, and raped the Cowboys.|`|sS5abD8Vaa	Dallas still has a football team?...I thought they went down to the arena league|`|e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	And we all know that the Cowgirls will be favored once again next year to be in the Super Bowl. I'm just glad that these games are settled on the field and not with a BCS type of system like they use in I-A college ball. I love I-A college ball but the NFL's playoff system is definately the right idea (it works for I-AA afterall).|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Dallas sucks, Dallas is a joke, Dallas is embarrasing.

HgdQMWuDaa	screen printed numbers are flat and wear off after excessive washing.... over the course of a few years they'll fall off a little bit at a time.  it depends upon the longevity of which you wish to own the jersey. yes it is more expensive to have stitched numbers but a stitched jersey will last a lot longer.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	I belong to a jersey site an ive collected for years.  If you wanna get into jerseys its www.nextleveltalk.com, im tonyromo if you join.  Anyway, there is nothing wrong with screen printed names an numbrs.  Matter of fact, if I were you Id get one of those before you get a "stitched one" on Ebay.  The jerseys that are on Ebay that are stitched are absolute garbage an they are fake NFL knockoffs from China.  If you want a quality jersey and have the money, you can get one from some of the guys on nextlevel and a AUTHENTIC one.  Heck a guy had a Authentic Marshall Faulk on there the other day for $50, stitched on field and NOT a cheap knockoff.  Just becareful about what you buy on Ebay, its a joke.  The screen printed ones are better then teh fake knockoff stitched ones.|`|u7GBP579aa	no, they are not better than stitched. Stitched is authentic it is the closes thing to what the players wear. The screen printed are cheaper, not bad but not anywhere near what the players wear|`|zIQ9DuYyaa	Screen printed names come off too easily.|`|2Hf3WFcgaa	I think you'd be better off buying a browns jersey but that's just my opinion also i think stitched is better but again that's my opinion!|`|OuRnSBU6aa	Screen printed Jerseys are the regular jerseys that you would find in a Modells, Dickies, or any sport shop.

PNu9c7UZaa	I cover professional wrestling I work for a few websites (write articles, post news, and interview superstars from WWE, TNA, and alot of Indy promotions.  I have meet all these superstars except 2...Kendrick and Ezekiel. Edge (Adam Copeland) and Christian (Jason Reso) are very nice espically Edge, despite being a heel on TV outside of TV he is very nice, he will always sign autographs and talk to the fans.  Carlito and Primo  are nice to Carlito is always one of the 1st superstars to volunteer for charity's and children hospitals. Ryder and Hawkins are jerks. That is why you don't see them on TV much anymore because they are assholes.  Miz and Morrison, I did an interview with them for an article I had to post online John Morrison (John Hennigan) could have been better, he is very down to earth, loves the fans, and answered every question in detail that I asked him.  The Miz (Mike Mizanin) on the other hand...he was an asswhipe.  He didn't take the interview seriously and he thinks he is a real big shot. Just like on TV he is really full of himself. Every year TAPS (The Atlantic Paranormal  Society) has an ECW star on their live Halloween show as a promotional thing the Miz was the star this past year.  The producers of SciFi kept bitching about how much of a jerk he was.  I don't know if anyone say the episode, he was very rude, and didn't represent the WWE very well on the show.|`|hL3eS2zKaa	I mett Jeff and Matt in before in Philly.

Guys like Miz and Morrison are just put together to see what they can get out of them, entertainment wise...some of these tag teams dont even travel together.. and then there are guys who work for different companies like TNA or NJPW and stay in contact 24/7...I hope i answered your question..|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I've met Rated RKO. Both Edge and Randy are very nice. I didn't get to meet Christian YET.. I'm working on it :) I'm hoping he will be in some meet and greets once he gets back!     Jeff and Matt were beyond nice! I was so nervous. They made me feel so comfortable. Matt was at the head of the table and he stuck his arm out and asked how i was and all that good stuff. I was shocked, but I wasn't because I know they are both nice lol. Jeff was also nice. He was mobbed with fans though. I want to meet him again and actually talk a little.     Carlito was freakin awesome. I never met Primo (he wasn't in the business at the time). He had a nice convo with me. He was very cool. No pun intended lmao.    I went to meet Miz and Morrison but never got in. They cut the line. I heard they wanted to leave early.|`|NXktxy8jaa	Edge And Christian - Yes  Carlito And Primo - Yes  Zack Ryder And Kurt Hawkins - Medium  Jeff And Matt - Yes  Brian Kendrick And Ezekiel - No  Miz And Morrison - Yes|`|7f2GSDmqaa	cool|`|02XHxknUaa	ok|`|vaVkveEkaa	Edge and Christian- Very Friendly  Carlito and Primo- Carlito's nice, but I don't know yet about Primo  ZR and CH- Idiots, they ended their angle with Edge because of their backstage problems.  The Hardyz- Great people, I used to (Now I've got FaceBook) chat with both on MySpace  Brian Kendrick and Ezekiel- Not cool at all, all Kendrick cares about is himself, just like on TV.  Miz and Morrison- Morrison's really nice, and respects the fans, while Miz on the other hand, I heard is an @-hole.    OTHERS...  Priceless: Rhodes and DiBiase are both nice, and Rhodes is actually really friendly  Rated RKO- Edge is the fan's hero, while Orton is OK, but sometimes, his anger gets the best of him...|`|SsodRf4kaa	They are all nice in real life. I mean have you seen how Hawkins and Ryder visit children and give handshakes etc. I passed Stone Cold before when I was an infant. I did not realize it. I wish I still had the photo.
NZKramllaa	Lmao.....was Christian in that dream also lol......    No I don't think so now, I think they want to give each superstar their Own HOF year.....So they don't have to share them and It will be more memorable.    BQ: Maybe or this year wouldn't hurt.....Stonecold and The Rock have a lot of history together and transcended WWE together...So it would only be appropriate to Induct both of them In the Same year.|`|uEfoR5BLaa	If Austin is then Rock should be too.|`|MJbfCODqaa	That would be cool but...|`|855bpb3Caa	I don't think he will be inducted this year, but i think he will be inducted in perhaps a couple of years time. There's a chance he could get inducted this year but i think it's unlikely.|`|ZICvolQNaa	I hope the Rock makes the HOF.  Why did you dream about this thats weird|`|sUmlxkQlaa	Doubt it.  He won't go in the same year of Austin.  That would be like inducting Aundre and Hulk the same year.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	it won't be this year. the big name this year is stone cold. i have a feeling it will be a few more years before the rock gets in.|`|rJMZdp04aa	No.  He'll be the Headliner of his Own Class.  SCSA is the Headliner this Year , The Rock will headline his Own Year.    This Year - 0%      BQ - Not Next Year Either.  Maybe 2012 or Later.|`|smcDn76jaa	I don't think he will be inducted this year. I have a feeling the WWE has one big name go in every year so he will probably next year.    BQ- I believe they should wait until next year unless HBK or Taker retire that year.|`|dGYR81enaa	Nah maybe next year!

Joke  4 & 6 reminds me of my friend who knows very little about cricket but yet talks about it all the time...lol.|`|bKp4er2Saa	Hehe well maybe if I knew what cricket was!!! (I know it's a sport but I don't know what it's about or how it works etc)|`|8T0Z0Y17aa	Some of them are really bad!    I like number 3 - I can think of a few people that that applies to!|`|GZvkcnv4aa	3 and 7 are alright but as for the others....it's almost funny how bad they are|`|Eq6LEVq0aa	Joke number 7 has to be the best one, number 2 is sorta not funny but good.    AND i find it funny that you find number 5 your favorite joke, because that one's pretty lame :P|`|kecdkv6jaa	haha, i've a few of them but there are a few new ones i haven't heard!  I like this alians description of cricket    ""I went to a large green field shaped like a meteorite crater. Around the edges, several thousand worshippers gathered. Then two priests walk to the centre of the field to a rectangular area and hammer six spears into the ground, three at each end. Then eleven more priests walk out, clad in white robes. Then two high priests wielding clubs walk to the centre and one of the other priests starts throwing a red orb at the ones with the clubs." "Gee," replied the other alien, "what happens next?" "Then it begins to rain."|`|XrCc85kNaa	It sucked!!!|`|cb9KqrUyaa	Sick,corny and twisted,just like you my friend..Pmsl    Number 6 just goes to show how stupid some yanks really are..Lol|`|AA11088802	2nd n 4th one is really good|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Number 3. As George said, I can think of a few that applies to! lol|`|5GUjFJjkaa	No7.|`|LzkujA3Faa	Haha! They are excelent, fantastic......Well, just so that i don't hurt your sentiments:P.    I liked the sixth one. Lol. Stupid Yanks! I liked the pun on the 5th one too.|`|130aad9e2b5a3b99346ce0725f94e57caa	no. 7 was outstanding..|`|JC9wAaOsaa	I like number 7...     couple of lames ones lol, but overall pretty good|`|GGuXJJeAaa	Laughing out Loud at number 3    No 4 haha ahhhmericans..    thanks for the laughs Kooks|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	Sorry to say but most of them were lame jokes excluding the seventh one.It was probably the best among the other jokes.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	OK, what about this one.    A school teacher told his class they had to write an essay on a game of cricket, and that no one was allowed to leave school until the essy was completed.  5 minutes later, Little Johnny got up from his desk and handed in his essay and was allowed to go home.  His essay read" Rain stopped play"    I can hear everyone groan
Eq6LEVq0aa	Well after hearing Sanath Jayasuriya commentate i think anyone has a chance, Jayasuriya should certainly stick to PLAYING cricket that's for sure.    Kumar Sangakarra as commentator, I'd love to listen to him, he's got a lot of knowledge about cricket and he's an intelligent speaker.    Coach....hmm...probably Graeme Smith, Graeme works really closely with Mickey Arthur and i think that'll rub off on him. Graeme is devoted to the game and i think he'd make a great coach. But honestly i have no idea about who may be coach.|`|8FUAMccRaa	Commentator-Andrew Symonds  Coach-Sachin Tendulkar|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	Commenntator  M.S.Dhoni,Rohit Sharma  R.Ponting,A.Gilchrist  Collingwood  G.Smith  M.Jayawardane  S.Akthar    Coach  R.Dravid,Zaheer Khan  M.Hussey,S.Clark  A.Cook,Sidebottom  A.Prince,M.Boucher|`|kecdkv6jaa	Commentator ----- AB Devilliers...dunno why he just seems like that kinda guy...also he has some sort of good voice because he has his own song!    Coach ----- i can see Simon Katich coaching NSW and maybe even Australia down the track!!|`|im8xN545aa	Strauss would make a good commentator, he's done it before for TMS in the past and wasn't too bad at it. Actually he'd probably make a good coach to.|`|wNxh1OU3aa	Andrew Symonds.   Channel 9 and Australians seem to love a larrikin.|`|rrDs6Dw4aa	Like Ange said, I would like to see Tendulkar as coach!|`|cb9KqrUyaa	Well we have just had Gilly step into the booth during our recent matches,i am waiting to hear Haydos behind the mic too.    I think Clarkie would do a great job,he knows how to talk.    And being a coach-Hmm maybe we might see Mike Hussey or Andrew Symonds out thier coaching some time.But i would like to see Sachin as coach of India one day TBH.|`|LzkujA3Faa	Gilly, i think, would do a great job commentating. He has already done a decent job behind the mic in the T20 matches. He is also quite animated when he talks. He has a lisp, but that doesn't matter. That makes his talk all the more pleasing!    I would love to hear Paul Collingwood commentating too. He got a nice deep voice.    Coach? Hmmm......How about Ricky Ponting? He has captained Australia through the good times as well as bad and his experience as a captain who has won the world cup twice, will be really beneficial to the team.    I  would have liked Warnie to coach us sometime to. He is a really astute and clever man who can bring the best out of the young guys.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Graeme Smith  Daniel Vettori  Michael Clarke  Any Englishman, they all have good voices|`|AA11088802	i think : commentator will be g smith/ ponting/ M hussey  Coach: Gibbs/ sachin/ M hussey|`|t7uuzjfHaa	Commentator  Brett Lee,(Dravid,Sangakkara,Ganguly) -- clarity of thought  and  good communicators,seem to enjoy post match conferences,  Shoaib Akhtar    Coach  Brett Lee,I think,it seems he  is good at man management,and a   friendly and approachable person|`|nwZD5mzRaa	Commentator - Kumara Sangakarra & Rahul Dravid.     Coach - Sachin Tendulkar|`|130aad9e2b5a3b99346ce0725f94e57caa	M. Clarke will definitely be a commentator for his ability to talk when its needed the most and otherwise as well. M. Hussey would be a coach and Ponting as well for his habit to repeat the shot in air after he has played it actually. Haddin can become a coach if he is not able to keep his position in the national side for long albeit of a club team.|`|8T0Z0Y17aa	I can see Strauss as a coach in the future    As for commentary, so many ex players go on to do it now, a lot of the current crop will probably go into the box. To name one, I think Flintoff might not be a bad bet - I remember him doing a little on Sky when he was injured.|`|Leoc8rlGaa	I think James Anderson will make an excellent commentator, as he is so outspoken, and is rarely out of the spotlight. He hogs every interview that England have, and it is sometimes difficult to shut him up.    As for a coach, well, either Ian Bell or Steve Harmison would be ideal. Theyboth spend a lot of time watching other players, so should have picked up plenty of tips. That, added together with their own extensice skills and hard-work ethic, should be enough.

BAurzDXtaa	I'm going to say Owen Hart because he would do anything to please the fans which is what ultimately cost him his life.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	It's hard to say, but I'll take Bret on this one. He had legions of fans in his day, and one thing I really respect about him, is after his falling out with WWE, he never sold his soul and kept his promise that he would never again partake in a WWE angle or storyline. Bret is a man of his word.|`|rRIYB9WNaa	Bret Hart.    He didn't injure a single wrestler for 20 years.  He didn't want the fans worried.|`|sUmlxkQlaa	Owen was VERY fan friendly.  Couldn't have been better to the fans.  Bret is more quiet and introverted than his younger brother.  I really couldn't tell you who cared more but they both really cared a lot.|`|xVENFaOfaa	While they both cared, Bret Hart showed it by his dedication to his training, script, fellow wrestlers, and of course the fans.  He was in great shape for each show, paid attention to his technical skills, taking pictures with fans, signing autographs, etc.    He still cares about his fellow wrestlers as he advocates for better wellness policies and assistance with managing the money and the fame.  He still cares about the fans through his radio, web and book work.|`|8h5dqzf6aa	owen  he did anything for the fans which cost him his life.|`|J2bLQcHNaa	Owen that guy was awesome|`|ZDEJCCiFaa	Shawn Michaels

In the wwe the dudleys were way more better,|`|3nN1vTTuaa	its alright, like they said its your opinion, it was just my opinion that the dudleys work in the wwe merited them more respect in tna, than they are getting.
WK6vrkdKaa	I dont think it can happen because WWE and TNA are rivals and rivals dont team together to make a super show or something or that sort..good idea though..|`|F3VjJAdiaa	It really is a great idea to do, say, one ppv a year together. but they will never do it. Unless times get tough for both companies.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Hopefully one day, and one other thing, just becuase WWE get loads of ratings doesn't mean they are the best, just that more people watch that show. Loads of people watched High School Musical not the best muscial out there though is it?|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Will never happen|`|7rpILeYtaa	i doubt it.  not unless Vince McMahon buys TNA, and keeps it as a separate company that sometimes 'invades' the other shows|`|CK0RLmlfaa	no because alot of people cant stand mr. mcmahon...................(cough cough kurt angle cough cough)|`|4tvI9WYjaa	we don't want to kill wrestle mania|`|CzTXKJoNaa	Maybe one day, but right now, TNA is NOTHING to WWE. Nothing. 1.1 ratings versus 3.5s?!|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Only if Vince buys TNA and does another invasion storyline.
8DIkez2uaa	No chance in hell. Haven't you realized that Taker has always been on top, and is one of the few that doesn't need the title to be good. Plus, they aren't gonna have him in the title match again, because we all know the title would change, and that's boring. With Batista it worked because there was rumors that he'd end it, and they made it look like it during SD. But not again, and they deffinately won't have him face Edge again.    Taker will not fight Kozlov though. Trust me. That would be so predictable and not epic enough for the biggest WM Ever. HBK will face Taker, trust me.|`|AA11482019	No.  Undertaker will face Kozlov and Edge will take on Triple H.|`|KIOR56r6aa	no, he already defeated Edge at WM 24...|`|oAjbBLDpaa	No, he shouldn't be fighting anyone 2 times at Wrestlemania with the exception of Kane and much less the same guy twice in a row. Undertaker no longer needs gold to solidify himself. His character has already defined himself as a force to be reckoned with even with the short and few title reigns he has had.|`|4JDM901Waa	no, because undertaker already beat edge @ WM 25;)|`|sc3e8KgVaa	I love Taker so much and would hate to see him leave this brand, but I think that he will face HBK in his home town of Texas and retire. I dont want this to happen in any way shape or form... Well the retirement I mean.    However if i could choose, It would be to wrestle HBK, not retire and go on for 1 more championship run then retire at the next Wrestlmania beating Kane|`|AA11480859	i hope not, the last match wasn't that great|`|1x7Eonykaa	no. but i would prefer that to taker vs koslov|`|A8oU68uBaa	Since The Undertaker won the World Heavyweight Championship last year, yes, he will win the title at WM 25 this year.
CzTXKJoNaa	Why tonight? On RAW? Why? He hasn't even SIGNED with the Dubble Dubble E.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	i hadn't thought of it, i was thinking he would be back at a ppv?|`|T13xM9iJaa	Well it would be cool if he did|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I had a dream last night that he did return tonight on Raw...It's weird that you are asking. Maybe, he will!! :)    In my dream, he was the first thing you saw at 9pm. His song was playing loud and clear as soon as the pyro stopped!! :)|`|CK0RLmlfaa	NO if he wouldnt return at rr then why in the world would he return at raw??|`|skIPrlaVaa	maybe because wwe will not let him return to smackdown because smackdown is tape and people will see the spoiler and they will not be surprise when he return. so they might as well let him make his return to a live show that is not tape|`|sc3e8KgVaa	Omg!!! NO HES NOT! THAT WAS NOT CAGE THAT WAS FUed by Cena in the commercial!!!! Sheesh! It was Justin Credible.|`|PyJ3PMRnaa	Nope.|`|P3g2Gz2Yaa	ahh no he will return on smackdown hopefully soon|`|dGYR81enaa	YES! i sure hope so but why would he??|`|B9h6VhQOaa	that would be cool but i want him to be on SD because there are more interesting storylines that could happen there
0ytjj1EGaa	YES    In Fact He Was The 2nd Capitan After Oliver Kahn      And He Was Named to Be Capitain After Kahns RETIREMENT    ==============    But His injury Destroyed it|`|7t7XzXsVaa	maybe|`|YmV3TNTpaa	Absolutely. He's been my favorite right winger since he was in Monaco. A complete right back with stamina, speed and quality crosses with both feet. He had good discipline and was respected by the players and the fans. Plus he's been playing for the club for almost 9 years. He would have been the perfect captain.    Too bad. Achilles tendon injuries are never easy to deal with|`|HKVFVS4qaa	No.        Edit: I think van Bommel was a good choice. Either him, Ribery, or Schweini*.    *-But only Schweini because I am a big fan of his, not necessarily that he is the most experienced player there.|`|df578e7cb5897f4763eb259bceabb3d1aa	over van Bommel? i don't see that ever happening.
fNb989b1aa	its all your opinion... you gotta feel a connection with your deck. Personally I LOVE girl skateboards, they are light and durable. but get something that will fit you. if you are more to the bigger side you should go with a 8" deck if you are lighter you should go with a 7.5" or higher. but like i said you gotta ride and see how you like each company. There are so many good companies out there like Enjoi, Girl, Alien WS, etc etc.....|`|tV0PSGxFaa	plan B or bams new board|`|7XXTxFUmaa	Habitat, Flip, and Element are good for flip tricks.  idk about vert but no one does that anymore any way.  smaller boards are better for street skating.  Longer boards are better for vert.|`|0hVsZuEraa	Habitat, Plan B, Zoo York, Girl, Enjoi, Alien Workshop, or just a Blank Deck. Never get an Element, they are light but break easy if u have not heard yet.|`|fPL7Ftjtaa	foundation i'm getting one of theirs  red barrings flip wheels venter trucks|`|18K7ucsEaa	Girl makes really strong boards...they are 9 layers instead of 8.

Op1WIwyPaa	Go to your local surf shop.    The Surfboard Man  http://www.thesurfboardman.com
DjjCvjlnaa	It was a big catch. I mean that catch changed everything. I think it got lost in the mix. Its not like the refs helped him make that catch. I think they just let it go|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Oh, please. Seriously, this is getting old.    There were a lot of questionable calls, and they affected both teams. There were a lot of no-calls that affected both teams. If you watched PTI, you ALSO heard that Wilbon didn't actually even SEE the celebration. A lot of people didn't.|`|RK9bJPOmaa	Ya ur rite. they should have threw a flag.  If they throw a flag when T.O. does something liek that, den they should do that for Holmes.  It would have made a HUGEEEE difference.  They could have retured the ball for longer distance.  Den Warner and Fitzgerald could have scored a TD, instead of warner wastin all that time settin up for a hail merry.  I say the ref's rigged that game, they was callin tooo much stuff on cards, and not steelers.|`|dnwJmNkdaa	maybe the 15 yds makes a diff but I don't think so.  I do think  it was a lead changing superbowl touchdown with less than 2 on the clock.... let the guy celebrate.    However I think Harrison should've been thrown out of the game for punching a down player|`|CVShpEgqaa	Stop overthinking everything. Who actually sits around and reanalyzes the game. The Steelers won. Get over it.|`|bnm9BfxDaa	this super bowl sucked and the refs ruined it. what about te last play? no one even bothered to review it. that play could have gotten the cardinals on the 29 yard line. and they should have because it was SO obvious that kurt warners hand was going forward. and early on in the game big ben made an intentional grounding mistake and no one saw it. not to mention the stupid roughing the passer call. ther was no roughing at all. big ben got hit about half a second after releasing the ball. it was one of the worse super bowls in history because of the refs|`|r4J2sPHzaa	um he didn't use the ball like it was a bottle of hot sauce he used it like it was baby powder like labron james and kevin Garnett does and i did think that was crazy but hay i guess if he didn't throw it in the stand or on the field its not a problem.|`|Qfb5TwMQaa	no it was a prop like lebron james he was using this|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	OK, this one has some merit. The fact of the matter is though, officials don't see everything. There were a couple of holds I noticed that the officials missed on both sides. This one I didn't even see.    It's one thing to blame officials for bad calls, but non-calls like this one, I'd give the benefit of the doubt that they simply didn't see it. It happens all the time.|`|xvO3p83zaa	I have no idea.    I was screaming for a flag as soon as NBC showed a replay of the celebration.    Whether you agree with the rule or not is irrelevant. Fact is, the NFL has been flagging these kinds of celebrations ever since implementing the rule two years ago that states you can't use the ball as a prop. Sunday night, they completely blew it at a crucial point in the game.    I'm sure the Cards could have used those extra 15 yards on the kickoff.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	yes, i asked this same questain earlier after hearing it on 1st & 10 nice jobs by the reffs paying attention, this would have made such a difference|`|XrCc85kNaa	The refs are all over this SB!!!!!!|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Probably got lost in the mix. I didn't see it personally; so I'm taking your word for it.    As for Steelers bias, MOST of the penalties called on the Cardinals were correct. And some just make me wonder.....|`|8aFOSlHWaa	yeah i think it should have been if Wes Welker cant make a snow angel then Santonio Holmes should not be able to do that|`|f7qVtYfaaa	yeah it was a missed call , odd too in that they focused on making that call this season|`|YUjVFkocaa	Steelers bias, definitely.    I hate both teams equally, but the rules ARE the rules, and if he broke them (which he clearly did), he should have been penalized.  Just because the stakes are high doesn't mean they can charge penalties for other stuff, and suddenly allow them excessive celebration that wasn't allowed before.  The refs blew the game.  I DOUBT the Cardinals would have been able to score a TD anyway... but it would have certainly changed the outcome in some way, and we can never know now, can we?    On the other hand, there were questionable calls all around- admittedly more were against the Cards, but the Steelers had penalties as well.|`|aGNjZmyJaa	Holmes- SB MVP|`|JMPB5OO0aa	It's one of those things.  If you were the ref in that situation would you have really threw a flag?  If he went overboard I could see the call but I think he was in a grey area.  The call would of been justified but you would have to be a huge jerk to call it.|`|pWvGbTdcaa	I think the celebration didn't get noticed, because of the refs reviewing the play. Yes, it should of been a penalty, and it would change a lot of things. Like, how the Cards would of played on offense, or how the Steelers would have played on defense, but it wasn't called.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	i cant stand the steelers but cmon...scoring a game winning td in the super bowl? of course hes gunna want to celebrate thats wht everything in football is about an he did it. hes gunna be a lil excited|`|q4BGlZy3aa	I think the refs were helping out the steelers, but I think a Superbowl winning TD get get a little extra celebration, but that last fumble call needed reviewing|`|Jp2415Whaa	Welcome to a Steeler bowl.  Here you can use the ball as a prop to copy LeBron James and get away with it.  WAIT THOUGH! only if you're a Steeler......Peace, enjoy your tainted title.  (second one [I remember Seahawks game too])|`|OuRnSBU6aa	I had a huge problem with the refs but really....    It's the superbowl and he just caught a touchdown. For anyone who watches sports you would know that it was just a little mimic of Lebron James. It wasn't anything to call a flag for. You can't blame him.|`|M5ykrN4Laa	Not trying to be rude or anything but forget it. The fifteen yards wouldn't have made a difference, it WAS a fumble no forward arm motion or anything.And Btw i was goin for the cardinals. LARRY FITZGERALD=PIMP|`|eqDXoCeTaa	The refs did miss that one.  He used the ball like it was a bottle of hot sauce.|`|OS7cZUAraa	**** happens w/ objective penalties    and you're probably just pissed off that the eagle suck

UaETEoCraa	You should find a boxing gym and learn how to box first. You can get a passbook from your trainer and then you can get into sanctioned fights. You can just get a passbook from http://www.usaboxing.org/content/index/4... and looking up what is closest to you but be warned if you do not learn boxing first you WILL be used as a punching bag for another fighter to beef up his record.   For now find one of the guys in the boxing program to spar with you and try to learn. You do not need the amateur status to spar with a boxer.|`|hIOkdSEFaa	well if you have the time you could go to a local boxing gym and train but since you are in the navy you might have to get permisson from the navy to do so .....but all you have to do is sign up at a local gym they will train you and get you some bouts or you can come to my gym ill train you and make you a champ.....champs aint born we make them
B8xXBR5Uaa	That would be great.Its also understandable because WWE is become way too predictable and with a lot of greats on the same show would be great.But the only thing i would be worried about is how long that can last?   And i would pay to see a Y2J vs Edge Match!!|`|dGYR81enaa	I agree mate! a Edge Jericho ladder match would be amazing! but i think that if there was only one championship it would be more excited and valuable because there would be 1 dominant superstar and people like Cena wouldn't hog the title all the time!|`|3b4c1d3bd81f17c846a0c8e8d5992d5daa	It use to be that way and I liked it a lot better.     Better storylines, more action. Not to mention that having TWO championship titles is just ridiculous.|`|WQhV4Amgaa	well that is a good imaginative idea but i still don't think so. it would hassle the wrestlers too much with showing up 2 times a week wrestling 2 times a week ect.|`|r2MfXmkqaa	no, just cancel ECW and split half of ECW into SmackDown half into RAW. Delete the Diva's title and make the Women's Title interpromotional and the ECW title be switched in for the Cruiserweight title.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	So you take all the wrestlers you would call world title contenders, that's well over 10, have them all compete twice a week for two titles then make sure absolutly no one can break into that group because there just isn't room and that improves the WWE? How? by making the glass celling reinforced so no one can break into the main events?  CM Punk Jeff Hardy and many young stars would never see a world title!    It makes no sense and would kill the WWE, the writing would be worse because there is no way to make that work.    Bad Idea!|`|02XHxknUaa	A LOT BETTER I WAS THINKING THAT TO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|CK0RLmlfaa	but it would be chaos yea it would be good matches but alot of the younger guys wouldnt get to fight|`|9Us6XYg8aa	A                                                    L                                          O                                    T                                                        B                                    E                                T                                    T                              E                                    R                                  !|`|AA11482019	It would be better. I've been against  the brand extension from the beginning.|`|CzTXKJoNaa	No, because RAW and Smackdown are best the way they are, and have their own feel. This ain't the Attitude Era anymore. RAW is the more out and out entertainment show, whilst SD is more wrestling oriented. ECW doesn't really count any more as the ECW roster primarily are on SD/RAW.

That's what I mean.    Hope I helped.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	it probably gives the wrestlers more time off with their family|`|QJwaagGWaa	Because it cost too much money to tape a show, so that is why Vince caves a lot ofmoney by Taping Smackdown and ECW.

mUG8XtNpaa	Larry Fitzgerald is better. He catches the ball at its highest point. He has bigger, stronger hands and with his second touchdown of last night, displayed speed many thought he didn't possess. Holmes wasn't as good as he was opportunistic - most of the passes (save the last one) were gift-wrapped for him to catch. Fitzgerald works for every damn ball he catches, I don't think there's a WR in the NFL better than him.|`|b4bca8c21af83ca96ef687dca4ae6b00aa	Fitzgerald|`|OuRnSBU6aa	Larry Fitz no doubt about it. Holmes is a great player, but Larry is just straight up better.|`|AvGd8FAEaa	definitely Fitzgerald|`|VjmTK6uZaa	larry, he is also so much faster.|`|OUKKNF1eaa	fitzgerald is better....       edit: holmes is better than rice though,  hows that chad c happy?|`|Fysq3Kb2aa	It has to be Fitz, but Santonio sure played an amazing Super Bowl.|`|o7E9LxV8aa	Fitzgerald is better|`|r4J2sPHzaa	fitzgerald is better|`|RK9bJPOmaa	Larry Fitzgerald in the 4th quarter itself he had more den 100 yards.  He can ctah the ball better, and run better. Holmes is no where close to him.|`|AA10939368	Currently Larry Fitzgerald is the better wide receiver.  I believe he has more all around athletic ability.  Both are tremendous and difficult to defend.|`|q06g4hHKaa	Larry|`|bJ61uKFEaa	Is this a serious question?  i dont think i even have to say it, everyone else already did|`|TuOp3hNPaa	fitzgerald|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Holmes is now better then Rice.  Theres a Steeler fan on here that will come up with that.  Just wait an see|`|15wwA3jjaa	Well given the fact that Holmes lit up an overrated defense that couldn't cover an old man with a walker even if they were told that he would get the ball every play, as opposed to Larry Fitzgerald who made the  1 defense in the league look like a high school team when it mattered the most.  I'm gonna have to go with Fitz on this one... by a mile.|`|39ixfEIraa	wat kind of question is that??? Fitz had about as much yards in the post season as Holmes had in the reg season!!! holmes was only good cuz cards D-Fense is full of crack head thugs|`|hHI0Vktxaa	Fitz by far|`|43daa72d6abd58775d0e46a24824eddeaa	your right. larry is better....but the question you need to be asking is larry better than andre' johnson.....i'm fixin' to post the question now|`|pWvGbTdcaa	Fitzgerald definitely is the better player, but Santonio is a up and comer for sure.
09YK9Zboaa	Yes Kane has earned it he has given his entire life to this company he should be in the Chamber its a shame but he deserves it more then Mike Knox|`|dGYR81enaa	Kane is a great powerful wrestler and a great character and the fact that he has been at that company for over 13 years and been world champion once in 1997 for ONE day is a disgrace! so yep i think he's due!|`|3nN1vTTuaa	i believe kane definately deserves this match.|`|WK6vrkdKaa	Yeah because Kane deserves to be the World Heavyweight champion or WWE champion more than anyone because he doesnt complain backstage when he has to put over someone younger than him and he is the WWE most underrated wrestlers ever..|`|NCqsnlClaa	no he had too many opportunities|`|B8xXBR5Uaa	lol im probably one of the few people still hoping that Kane would be in the top,but,they DO need people that are fresh...i never considered Mike Knox fresh though....|`|f3AdydqAaa	Yes, he has been here for too long and does appsolutley deserve to be in the World Heavyweight Title chamber match. He is great and shouln't be out of it. Mike Knox shouldn't be in it, its outrages what has happen to WWE?!|`|7f2GSDmqaa	No, because he wont win anyways. Whats the point of him being in it? Like the first user said, Kane has had many opportunities in the past anyways. Let some new blood in there.|`|CK0RLmlfaa	no he should be the champ!

9G0kQAoEaa	Ya five million profit it hardly a bad deal|`|Hzzdalavaa	Good deal for Spurs.|`|Vv465eJMaa	Very bad deal for Spurs.Keane has lost a lot of pace,and is not quite as deadly in front of goal.Remember he was substituted a lot at spurs.He scored 3 times in 18 games after CC victory.  He is not the player he was 12 months ago.We have paid too much for a has been|`|kxMQXhuAaa	He's a decent player but he wasn't worth anything like 20m in the first place.Liverpool were silly paying that sort of money for him.    I thought Spurs got him back for 12m?.|`|ePim7L2zaa	i take it you are a man u chited fan?|`|BdR6eQWOaa	Waste of Money|`|Rtzx1xKYaa	Yea cause his price got lowered due to performance this season.|`|072ce7ec5571ee7df347254907087ec6aa	They should never have sold him in the first place. Another example of Juande Ramos's management.  It seems to me Harry Redknapp(rightly in my opinion),in buying back all the players Spurs sold,is attempting not only to repair the damage done by Ramos,but more importantly to keep Spurs in the Premiership.  Don't get me wrong,Ramos is a good manager.His credentials speak for themselves.However,I believe he simply did not understand the English game,the English people and the English mentality.Besides which there was a language problem.  In a way,Ramos was,I think,"the thinking man's Jacques Santini"!  ...But to answer your question,yes,I agree. I think it was a good deal to buy Robbie Keane back.|`|TvMiwKjEaa	Not a good deal. If you'd have kept him in the first place then you might not be battling relegation like you are now. Is fighting relegation really worth that extra 5million when you've spent like 50million?|`|A3Gdiv52aa	Great deal for Tottenham because they sold Keane when he wanted to leave, then bought him back when he will love to play for the Spurs and they gained a 5 million pound profit which is quite a lot.|`|HEEXkiihaa	definitely good deal...spurs got 5 million for a loan to pool for 6 months and keane hardly broke a sweat.|`|2sIwoqRGaa	It was 12million plus extras based on performance which at Spurs isn't going to count for much :P    I'm actually a Chelsea fan and hate saying this but Keane is a good player and it's Liverpool's loss for not trying to accommodate him properly. When 'Pool and Chels lined up at the weekend I was happy Keane wasn't playing.    I think Spurs have got a very good deal and if they can just get a bit of muscle in that team (Palacios?) they will be fine and with Harry they'll challenge European places next season.|`|ujRVh1e4aa	Tottenham were very smart in this situation because they knew Keane was falling out of favor with Rafa Benitez. It was a good deal because they basically made a 5 million pound profit which they could use on young talent or other players to help.|`|nGpBuI9Oaa	12million actually|`|WzSwdv3zaa	they bought keane for 18 million and sold for 12 million      but it was a bad deal for both teams really|`|9b46fa1bcd4de3f2eed9af5a9e409c3eaa	for someone.how much of this money will go out of football.|`|OW2etH4Waa	we could of bought him for 10p lol|`|3zbGNp4maa	But Tottenham buy a rotten Keane.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	ahem, no|`|XU1KaWXwaa	i dont think any liverpool fans care about robbie now, everyone makes mistakes...|`|Gr99OjQuaa	hes out of form, probably lost confidence, doesnt have berba and will have to learn to play with a new partner, tottenham are struggling so theres pressure.. the whole situation is pretty bad in my opinion|`|i2ZAVM2aaa	It's a good deal for Keane, He'll get 2 Signing on Fee's|`|JdlkhEayaa	Well it certainly can't be a bad deal for Spurs. 5m profit in just a few months and getting back a player that WILL score for them.  Like me, I think most Liverpool supporters feel a bit sorry and embarrassed the way he was treated here at Liverpool.  I sincerely hope he has a good and successful second spell at Tottenham.  Good luck Robbie!!!|`|Hiasgb75aa	It was actually 12 million and yes its a great deal
8skV9ze9aa	Dontrelle is a different case than the other two. The league just adjusted to him and he couldn't adjust back. Using stats like BABIP (batting average for balls in play) and HR/FB (average home runs per fly ball), both measures of how lucky a pitcher was, you can tell he was playing way, way over his head in '05. (check source link and see the differences between '05 and every other year) He did go wild in '08 but that was after a steadier decline, and he was never really that good.    Ankiel and Hill, though, were great in their single years of success in their youth. The original Ankiel/Hill was Steve Blass, though he had several years of success prior. Few pitchers have returned from Steve Blass syndrome, and I don't think Hill will either. Still, it's been only one year, so it's way too early to write him off.|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	Hill needs to find his stuff...Willis, at least, has the bat to consider a move if he wants...    Seriously though, I have no idea what's wrong with Hill.  I think he'll be the indicator whether or not Leo Mazzone has any magic left in the tank.    Willis strikes me as a typical product of the Cub farm system (remember that's where he started)....He's another guy (like Patterson and Pie) who came in with a world of raw talent, but is seemingly unable to develop in the majors.  It's clear that the league finally caught up to his quirky delivery and above-average stuff.  The next step is up to him and his coaches.|`|OnGQOVlaaa	Rich Hill will be back to his previous form soon enough.   Dontrelle on the other hand has never been a consistent pitcher.... he has his moments....|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	haha hat be cool but its so rare to happen. Could u imagine ?

The bottom line is that pitchers don't pitch to pitchers like they would hitters. Plus, it's not like Rick Ankiel was the greatest pitcher. D-Train was in the Cy Young race just a few years ago! There are a lot of bad pitchers who can hit, and there are a lot of good ones. For example, Micah Owings had a walk-off for the D-Backs last season. Jason Marquis hit a grand slam! On the other hand, CC Sabathia, Carlos Zambrano, and Johan Santana can swing the stick. Felix Hernandez hit a grand slam off of Johan! In the end, it's not just bad pitchers that are good hitters. And bad pitchers can get better.

GBbzQ68haa	Ok so for some people girls lacrosse is easy to learn and for others it really isn't! It depends on hand-eye coordination, skill level, and how athletic you are! First you need to learn how to scoop with the stick! For most parts of them game the ball is on the ground! To scoop you need to get low, bend your knees and run through the ball! DO NOT SHOVEL IT UP! It takes a lot of practice too! Don't get frustrated just keep trying! The next part is catching! The sport of lacrosse is a fast moving, fun game! It involves a lot of passing and catching! To catch point to the person that is throwing to you with the head of your stick and bring it back with the ball. Pretend the ball is an egg... handle it gently and keep your focus! ALWAYS KEEP YOUR EYE ON THE BALL! Then to throw... bring the stick back (but not too far or the "egg" will fall out) then pull forward and in the end when the ball comes out you need to follow through and the head of your stick needs to be pointing at your target! I hope I helped! Just e-mail me at beachbum3995@aol.com
GC37jW6Gaa	As soon as you feel you are ready. I know plenty of people in my league who have gone into it not knowing anything about hockey at the beginning of the season and we are now at the half-way point and they have improved greatly and are loving it. They are between the ages of 12-14. It kinda depends on your confidence, age and a fear of getting hit.But don't go out into an elite league when you are just starting. You will bet your but whipped.  Good Luck!|`|axxQzOCHaa	As soon as possible. Do know that you will probably have to upgrade your gear though.|`|264GS7s7aa	as soon as you're comfortable with yourself|`|7q2dkax3aa	No, i don't think you should because ice hockey get very "political" with who is playing. I have been playing my whole life and i play alot but i hate it when i see kids sitting on the bench not playing when they have the ability to play.The choice is yours so i can't force feed an answer to you but thats what i think.If you chose to play then you might want to play in a league where you are one of the better players so it stays fun.And always rember this you can play hockey for fun or you can play hockey to win; I always thought it was fun to win :)|`|9i4Rxqknaa	Once you feel comfortable skating, go for it! You'll probably learn more and get better when you start playing anyways.|`|iw3v5bgIaa	If I remember correctly, Dominic Hasek started at about 13 yrs. old and became one of the most successful (if not unorthodox) goalies in the NHL.    If you want to play ice hockey, learn to skate well (forward, backwards, even sideways) without a stick before complicating matters (and possibly frustrating you) by integrating passing, shooting and puck handling into your game.    My advise is to get the skating down before investing in equipment.    If you are ready for equipment, check out the site below for equipment deals, discounts, close outs, new product lines and training aids to DVDs at great prices:    http://www.squidoo.com/sports-hockey-equ...|`|9vLzGwVqaa	Whenever you want!
TdE0J2xVaa	Got to admit it's not a bad lineup.  The problem I see with the Lakers is no deep bench.|`|AsvVWfiHaa	because you have to save some of your best fire for the 2nd unit...or to come off the bench. you don't throw your best 5 players up front, because you need someone to hold things down when your starters have to rest.|`|e244f73e4196f993f5f933b295465ca5aa	They do not do that lineup because if they did, they would have no sixth man off the bench to bring some energy and the Lakers would probably lose more games.|`|qpfodNuhaa	whatever kobe says goes so he could have the  1 choice in this situation|`|oGbAnqyhaa	Because the Fakers managment is filled with clueless assholes.     This should be the Fakers starting lineup    PG- Sun Yue- The best player on the Fakers  SG- Luke Walton  SF- Josh Powell  PF- DJ Mbenga  C- Chris Mihm    That starting lineup has a chance at making the playoffs. Unlike the Kobitch lead starting lineup    KOBRICK 'MAD COW' CRYANT SUCKS  MAGIC JOHNSON SUCKS  KAREEM ABDUL JABBAR SUCKS  ELGIN BAYLOR SUCKS  JERRY WEST SUCKS  WILT CHAMBERLAIN SUCKS  JAMES WORTHY SUCKS  SHAQUILLE ONEAL SUCKS  GEORGE MIKAN SUCKS  MICHAEL COOPER SUCKS  BYRON SCOTT SUCKS  AC GREEN SUCKS  GAIL GOODRICH SUCKS  NICK VAN EXEL SUCKS  EDDIE JONES SUCKS  KARL MALONE SUCKS  GARY PAYTON SUCKS  ANDREW BYNUM SUCKS  PAU GASOFT SUCKS      In 1971 Elgin Baylor retired due to a FAKE knee injury because he was tired of Bill Russell and Sam Jones whipping him and his good buddy Jerry West in the Finals.

l4WEwTWwaa	The real question is what didn't he do? He did something very few fighters today do, fight all the best possible competition. He fought the likes of Sonny Liston, George Foreman, Joe Frazier, Earnie Shavers, and even a few tough B fighters like Oscar Bonavena and Jerry Quarry. Some of those major wins were when he was clearly past his prime too. When he fought George Foreman at 24, he was 32 and had lost a tremendous amount of speed. But he still went 8 rounds with him taking some of the hardest shots ever in boxing and handed Foreman his first and only knockout loss. Next at 38 and showing signs of Parkinson's disease he fought Earnie Shavers, a man ranked as the hardest hitting boxer ever. He went the distance with him and outboxed him the entire fight despite more heavy shots. He proved himself time and time again more than any other fighter in history. Not only that but his skill was tremendous. He had welterweight speed at Heavyweight which is something I have never seen in a heavyweight again, good power the likes of which knocked out some of the toughest fighters in history, and a chin unmatched by any other. Aside from physical attributes he was very smart as a fighter. He knew how to frustrate an opponent and use his strengths and weaknesses against him and was just a genius. What did he do to make history? Everything. He beat everyone there and never took it easy on himself, won the title three times when there was only one major title, showed amazing skill and genius, and rewrote what it meant to be a living legend. Easily in the top five greatest heavyweights ever.|`|UaETEoCraa	He was a very successful boxer. Ali was the first heavy weight to move like a lightweight. Before him the heavyweights were all huge with massive muscles so nobody thought he would stand a chance to the large heavy weights, but he did time and time again. The way he would fight with his hands at his side moving around and throwing devastating punches out of nowhere made him something special to watch.|`|hIOkdSEFaa	we was the only light heavy weight gold metalest to turn pro as a heavy  weight and unify the heavy weight championship|`|S0GrfU1saa	well he was the first black american  to win a olimpic gold medal in boxing  in Rome; And when he  arrived in the state with his gold vmedal on his neck  a bounch  of white guys they pulled the medal and the true in the river|`|CDeZOLmgaa	He stood up the US Government and white America in a time when Martin Luthur King and Malcom X were both assassinated. He was the main figure of the rebellious movement.    He was the first heavyweight to fight like a Middleweight, he upset the most feared man in boxing at the time Sonny Liston, He gave up millions of dollars, the prime of his career to stand up for what he though was right, faced a 5 year prison sentence and a 10'000 dollar fine which was huge back then, he went broke standing up for what he belived and saying right out that the Vietnam war was wrong. and that it was a rich political war.    They offered him a chance to serve in the army and all he would have to do is what Joe Louis did and box in exhibition bouts for the troops, but he refused lost 3 years of his prime but still came back years later to again defeat the baddest man on the planet George Foreman in a fight people thought he would be killed.    He was the first athlete to make a show out of professional sports, when you see Mayweather, Mayorga, Tyson ext ext going off and talking trash.... Ali started that.    He predicted rounds in which he would knock out his opponent and then followed through on it.     When he lost his speed and reflexes he started to beat his opponents mentally and use his ring experience to win fights instead of relying on his natural ability,.    He fought the later part of his career while already suffering from Parkinsons syndrome and was still competing at the top level of the sport.    He lit the Olympic Torch in 94, pretty good for a guy who was once called a racist Muslim radical and an anti patriot who was hated by whites and blacks alike.    He talked the leader of Vietnam into releasing prisoners of war and became the most recognized person in the world.    And since he has been 12 years old he said he would be the greatest of all time.    So yea, all that stuff    oh yea he became the first 3 time heavyweight champion, a record that stuck until Evander Holyfield did it in 96|`|8xyFCsMRaa	of all the accolades the people here say about ali, his most notable contribution in boxing is that he was able to rewrite the heavyweight division.  he was a heavyweight that moved like a middleweight and that was unheard of in that era.    float like a butterfly and sting like a bee.    he was a boxer at heart more than anything else.|`|6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	He refused to sign up for the draft. That and he was Heavyweight Boxing champion of the world and all.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	i could write you a book but bottom line he gave boxing new life he came in at the right time and cleaned up the heavyweight division then he retired he became champ in the way he reached out to help us and around the wold|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	alot!!!!! he was a repeat champ, who fought a lot of tough fights when he was past his prime.  2. he was an international star and a civil rights activist.

rNUyV1EYaa	Even though Santonio Holmes was the MVP, I have to say the best player on the field was Larry Fitzgerald.    Two fourth quarter touchdown catches gave the Cards the lead (well, that and the safety).    But I will never forget saying aloud to everybody "The Cardinals scored too fast". With 2:37 left I had a feeling the Steelers would pull it off.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	fitzgerald.  most talent|`|QtjnmEzoaa	Darnell Dockett  2 sacks  Stuffed the Steelers running game  Big influence in the safety|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	heck you could have had Marino, Barry Sanders, Rice, Cris Carter, Jay Novacek, Larry Allen, Orlando Pace on that Cards team an it wouldnt have mattered.  Ill say Warner though to answer your question|`|2ZAzoKfraa	Kurt Warner, admittedly. After the first few possessions, he started tearing the league's  1 defense apart.|`|RK9bJPOmaa	i would say Larry Fitzgerald.  Even though it took him till the 4th uarter to get the ball.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Ben Roethlisberger. He escaped pressure and stepped up to make big throws in even bigger situations.|`|VjmTK6uZaa	The cardinals QB|`|4d8923629944072027bbc12052c6a2e3aa	LOL I didn't even watch, hell I didn't even know who was playing HHAHA|`|yIY9PAjTaa	For me, I don't think there was one set player who stood out.  -Harrison's 100 yard touchdown was unbelievable. That not only put the Steelers ahead, but set a Superbowl record.  -Holmes catch in the 4th quarter was miraculous. That catch was the defining moment of that game.  -Larry Fitzgerald had some very impressive plays. If the Cardinals had scored after Santonio's catch, it would have been because of Fitzgerald.  -Warner did good, but I felt that his performance in the second half was much better than his performance in the first half.|`|Jp2415Whaa	The man who ripped up the Steelers D.

NDoyhCZYaa	Okay, here's what helped me the most:    1.) Focus on doing it step by step, pop real hard and flick off the curve outwards, not downwards.    2.) ALWAYS practice it moving. Kickflips are useless if you learn them stationary, and practicing them while moving after mastering them stationary is basically relearning them.    3.) Master high as Hell ollies before you continue to the kickflip.    4.) Most important tip of all... keep your back straight! Keep aligned with the board, don't go too far back, don't go too far forward. This will cause outward flipping and far-out kicking.    5.) Practice. This is a hard trick, if you're a quick learner like me and a few others are then you could get it down in a matter of a month or maybe even a couple weeks. Start practicing them slow, then go a little faster, and faster, then start hauling @$$ and doing them.    Good luck.|`|ik8Y15FCaa	learning kickflips a couple years back  they suck  i hated learning them but i had to  just so i could use it in a game of skate  usually when i do tricks i forget the freakin pop  and then everything just slides really slowly  when i udually do the pop it ends up somewhere over there  if you get the pop, stance, and everything else good  i learned a secret to theese little brats  you have to lean foreward  if you dont its gonna shoot somewhere  or end up landing it but really sketchy  if you want a nice clean looking flip i suggest leaning forwars a little  when i say lean   im saying shoulders past board|`|7XXTxFUmaa	slam your foot down harder or flick faster. practice in the grass so its harder to fall and you wont move.|`|KbuOMIPxaa	First its cool ur a Girl skater I'm a girl skater to and I just mastered the kickflip like last week   basicly u gotta get pretty good a ollies xD some people can do kickflip really low but that's no use    Do an ollie and as your sliding your front foot up flick it off to the left(if you ride regular) and off to the right (if u ride goofy) keep your eye on the board and as soon as u see the griptape land it  it takes a while to figure out how hard to flick it  your board might fly off if u don't do it properly,maybe try flicking it  slightly more down or forward  Move when your doing a kickflip even if its not that fast    Never leave the flick to late and bend your knees high    make sure u have mastered the ollie first  If u can't do an ollie moving maybe you should try that first its quite easily  keep on practicing even pros like tony hawk can't get his kickflips right every time

lNPvwtSvaa	He is definatley a legend. Being from Pittsburgh myself, Angle is a hero here. When he was with WWE and it came to Pittsburgh he was cheered like crazy and even as a heel he would acknowledge the fans and hoe great Pittsburgh was. He will go down as one of the greatest wrestlers of all time.|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Kurt Angle is a legend and anyone who says otherwise obviously is an idiot|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	kurt angle is a little overrated but i guess he is a legend.  I agree the old john cena when he use to rap was the best i hate the champ cena
63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	I agree. I wish they gave Rey a push. And yes he is way more talented than Cena. I mean the guy has incredible moves. At this moment, he will not headline wrestlemania. But I think he will next year maybe because he starting to get a push now. He is in the elimination chamber match. rey is going to build his way up to the top, where he should be. And notice how many people like Rey and he has completely no haters of him. He attracted many of the wwe fans that we have today.|`|5nd1YeI4aa	hopefully he was great as world champ|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Not unless he turns heel|`|uEfoR5BLaa	Hopefully|`|rRIYB9WNaa	Everyone pray to god he will.|`|5vXgcAbCaa	I hope so. He has the biggest fan base in WWE. Nobody hates Rey Mysterio. He is most talented and is just too good to leave out of another Wrestlmania main event. I want to see him go in as champion this time though.|`|pmjOiQFvaa	unlikely look at the length of his previous world title reign anyway it wasnt very wrong but it can be justifyed by the wwe for the fact that rey aynt reli a big guy so the world "heavyweight" belt around a lightweight wouldnt look genuine would it. but you never knww well he may win the ECW title if he gets drafted there. but i dont see him headlining wrestlemania maybe in a special match with a celebrety or a good showing in MITB das about it.

smcDn76jaa	It was a huge phenomenon during the 80's but I have to say during the Attitude Era it was bigger. I would hate to continue praising the Attitude Era because it has brain washed some fans, but  have to admit it was legendary. This was when wrestling had more fans than ever and all in such a short period of time. The Golden Age had more loyal fans and better matches, but this one goes to the Attitude Era.|`|CzTXKJoNaa	Wrestling was NOT that big in Attitude. It was all about brawling, and gimmick matches.|`|m4wFJPAOaa	They were greater. But before them these wrestlers were good too.  The Anderson's Ollie Gene and Lars. Mr Wrestling, Jerry Brisco.

c17x6L4baa	I have seen a lot of posts favorable to the Cards today.  They have nothing to be ashamed of in being that close to winning the SB.  Sometimes the calls don't fall on the right side.  Great end to the season.   Hoping they can build on it and that Warner decides to play for a couple of years and Boldin and the team can reach an agreement that makes him happy.  Go Cards!|`|XrCc85kNaa	Are you some sort of stupid azz preacher or something?|`|Jp2415Whaa	I'm more than proud how we proved we deserved to be in SBXLIII.

Kurt Warner. This guy is a really good player, does a lot of charity work, always positive, and true to his religion.    I hope he plays a few more years. I want him to get another Super Bowl ring before he retires.    Your Cards had a great season and you should be proud of what they did this season. I think they will be around for a while. They will win the division for the next few years. They just need some key defensive players from the draft and then they are good to go.|`|EvDoLydgaa	those officials suck and are idiotss|`|KuYmwZwbaa	I still love my cardinals and am proud of every minute of how that game was played.

Edgerrin James is a borderline Hall of Fame candidate, at best.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	If he accomplished that by age 27, definitely a Hall of Famer.    If not, he has more work to do.|`|XHharKJgaa	A possible NFL Hall of Famer, but it'll take a number of tries and years if he ever does make it in.

What possible reason is there to believe that they won't trip over their own feet, as usual, and blow the chance to get Lebron?  Lebron is using the threat of his leaving to get inside the head of the Cleveland GM.  He will be the star of the Cavalier franchise for the next 10 years and Cleveland will do all it can to keep him there.  He is already on every commercial that Peyton Manning is not in and has no reason to put up with the Post, News, Times, Newsday, Bergen Record, etc. that hounds every move of any athlete in New York.|`|khbLZQHIaa	Where have you been?

Rafa really is baffling me at the moment, i just can't believe that he decided to get rid of Keane before he got a replacement in he obviously knew months ago that he was going to sell him so surely he should have been able to find a suitable replacement, it'll be interesting if Torres gets injured to see if they can cope as well as Everton without any strikers!

3ZrTiVFCaa	Ricardo Quaresma - He is a top Winger i think he will bring spark back to chelsea after the losses to Man Utd & Liverpool (sorry for menching that).  I think he will proppaly replace Malouda even tho i think he is a good player with is speed.  I always use to buy Quaresma on football manager games|`|ojHN65J0aa	Unlike Anelka?  Are your mentally handicapped?      Top scorer in the premier league rings any bells?|`|Rtzx1xKYaa	Chelsea would become my third favorite EPL team.|`|gazpAVKfaa	Quaresma is a poor man's Ronaldo.     Can't even knock Ronnie or Simao off the National squad, also he was crap at Euro's.|`|ineX6nyEaa	Ya I don't know what you mean when you are talking about anelka??   But Queresma is exactly what we need, a good winger that will change things up a bit and add a little spice. We have a lot of quality players i think a move was in order to change things up a bit and get everyone's *** in gear.|`|gpNIG15eaa	Currently as Joe Cole is injured,Quaresma will currently play in the right wing,with Malouda on the left.But when Joe Cole returns,Quaresma will play on the left,with Cole on the right.Whether he'll settle permanently into the Chelsea squad,I don't know.There was so much hype about Deco when he arrived in the summer.But now Deco has faded and lost his place in the first team.Quaresma was also brought to Inter Mian to boost the wings,but Jose Mourinho started to lose faith in his wingers,including Figo,and even played Zanetti and Chivu on the wings.Likewise anything could happen to Quaresma.We have to watch him in action for the next two months,then we can decide.|`|Rds4eGIyaa	Quaresma is definitely a poor mans Ronaldo. He actually reminds me of Ronaldo as a teenager - all flash and tricks with no end product. For me, simply Ronaldo has evolved and Quaresma hasn't. I just think he has a terrible attitude and likes to be a big fish in a little pond in the Portuguese league and can't cut it at the big clubs like Barcelona and Inter when he isn't selected for every game. But we'll  just have to wait and see if he can make it at another of Europe's elite clubs and judge him after a few months. This is a good move by Chelsea though because if things work out, then great, and if not well they haven't lost anything.|`|96xuUq6maa	i think quaresma will do well. he has been known to not perform as well on the big stages. such as barcelona and inter milan. but i believe at the moment he is in a bit of a slump and by the end of the season he will be a better player. although i am not a big fan of chelsea i am happy he is here. he will get more game time and hopefully improve as a player. i dont know if he'll stay at the end of the season but i must say he is more likely to stay at inter because of his contract. although he is not a crowd favourite at inter, he is a loyal player and he is bound by his contract.  yehh i also think he'll replace malouda.  buhh lets just hope he does well :]|`|Hiasgb75aa	Anelka is better than Kalou. Anelka is your top scorer. Malouda is crap, but as a left footed winger he should at least be on the subs bench|`|df578e7cb5897f4763eb259bceabb3d1aa	hopefully not as a united fan.|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	Unlike Anelka? Is 14 EPL goals not enough, and most of those from him leading the line on his own?    Surely though he'll turn out better than Malouda.

a1D8qfO4aa	Well depends i'm 5'6 also and i ride a lot of park like everyday and i use 161cm cause its easier to do tricks off jumps and rails. So if your buying armada thats a park ski so i would go shorter if you are going to be in the park. These are also good for powder cause they are really soft. So it really depends what you are doing park go shorter then70c 175cm. If you are carving don't take these skis and if your powder i would reccomend 170 but 175 i think is to long for anything.|`|k1C70y8raa	everyone is complicating this, listen bro you need smaller ski's. freestyle ski's aren't supposed to be that much bigger unless your skiin pow.  and in that case go for some sugar daddys.  but you nee 160-170 TOPS|`|isA4wtnMaa	Both those skis sound too long.  However, the length of the skis depends on your weight and ability as well.  If you're a heavy super G or GS racer these would be perfect.  Although, I doubt that the Armada ARV are a downhill racing ski.  For recreational skis, look for something that is around height of the middle of your nose.  Consider asking the guys in the ski store to help you if you're unsure.  They should have a chart (or have already memorized) exactly what size of ski your height, weight and ability are suitable for.  Good luck!|`|UZ8IcCwtaa	I am coincidentally 5'6" also and i have size 166 cm skis but they are just a little to big for me so im guessing a 156 or 161 would be good it can make all the difference if your skis are a little to big or to small. Sorry, i just noticed they come in only 165,171, or 185. Depending on how long you are going to keep them would be a good factor in choosing. If you are going to keep them until for a couple or 3 years you should get the 171Cm and if are just getting them for this year or just next year get 165. And if you have stopped growing get 165 too. Having skis that are too long will give you a deficiency in the park. If you get the 165 now you will have a perfect size ski and get great use out of the skis. Even though these skis are awesome anyway.|`|woze19rIaa	175 if you are intermediate skier, and 185 if you are a more serious/ advanced skier or racer.  The wide skiers are good on wide turns.    Adam.

T13xM9iJaa	He would be in a match with Shane at No Way Out and go on to headline WM25 and this is why I think that.    This plan was set up by Randy and Stephanie and this is how    I mean look at it Stephanie wants all the power and is a 4th generation diva so what dose she do ask Randy to take out her dad and in return she will not only join Legacy but give Randy equal power as GM. So now that Vince is out of the picture, Shane is next. What is gonna happened is that over the next few week leading up No Way Out they are going to be hyping this storyline. Then at No Way Out Steph is gonna make some match like a no DQ match or something like that during the match both Randy and Shane are gonna be going back and forth then Shane is just weak and can't go on that is when Randy will punt Shane. Then being that Steph is ringside she run in to check on Shane then she get up with a VERY angry face then turn around and starts to smile and shake hands with Randy. Revealing that she and Randy where working together all along.    Also history shows that Stephanie has turn on her family to gain more power.|`|dGYR81enaa	YOU RETARD! couldn't you have just asked the question??|`|Jy7t6grDaa	no he goes to headline WM25, and gonna hazard to say he brings back the title with him|`|rrcnjnDWaa	ur gay    BUT I AM.....

4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	This question was asked yesterday actually.  The answer according to golf digest is yes.  The epoxy and grips are in danger of cracking.  This causes damage to the hosel and the grip.  Like the previous poster said...not worth damaging them, and possible injury.|`|Wa7wktLkaa	yes, hot tempratures damage the grips and loosen the glue in the hosel, and cold temps, crack and stress fracture the steel of the shaft.|`|85b3669c8137ae8287c1eb465c62d3f3aa	yes it is damaging them...the epoxy in the hosel will come loose eventually and the heads will fly off when you hit them    ............FORE!!!|`|ajkMt6gRaa	More important question is ... how often do you play and practice.  I know guys who take clubs in the car because they use them a lot.  Storing clubs at a course can help alleviate some of the hot and cold aspect.  In texas for instance ... a car is like a pressure cooker.      treat your clubs like you would treat a child.  also - if you don't leave your clubs in the car, they are less likely to be stolen.

Last season the team i support Derby County FC got relegated with the lowest points total in Premier League history, so as you can imagine it was very embarrassing for the players and the fans. But eventually the fans got over it and looked forward to the next season in the Championship. Although we haven't had that good of a season so far in the Championship we had a good run in the Carling cup reaching the semi finals before losing to Manchester United 4- 3 on aggregate over two legs (matches).    Obviously everyone wants their team to be in the Premier League, but the Championship isn't such a bad league. As others have said the Championship is a very competitive league because the teams there aren't miles apart in class from each other, and any team can beat any team on their given day in the Championship.|`|avhgLEu8aa	It's never happened to my team, but it has happened to my local team.

Or you could always practice :)|`|KnSv7wPjaa	Well, I think that you should practice or make an agreement with your parents so you quit, or, just deal with it.

I really enjoy softball but it is kind of hard. it also depends how old you are too. like when your under 4th grade the coach pitches the ball and there are no balls or strikes. when you get into high school you are expected to know how to hit the ball into the out field, have a good arm for throwing, you should be able to run fast too. But batting is the hardest. its all about hand-eye cordination and waiting till the ball reaches the bat and then swing. and once you have hit the ball never throw it always place it down the run cause it could hit the upm or somebody and you will get a strike out just for doing that but all in all softball is a very fun sport! Hope you like it!|`|AA11237372	Take up boxing and punch yer dad in the mouth!|`|z7JsVzcnaa	That's horrible that your parents make you play a sport then make fun of you for it.

It will rank right up there in the top 5 for sure.  I have been watching Super Bowls for the last 30 years, and this one is right up there.  I enjoy these so much more than the blow out games.  (Except when the Cowboys are the ones doing the blowing out)|`|f8NsMbqEaa	Great game, glad it wasn't one of those blow out type boring games, it was intense till the last few seconds, granted I would have liked to have seen the Cardinals win but nonetheless it was an AWESOME game..

I'll take my star back, thanks.|`|eOQ8rGqCaa	Yes it was one of the greatest Superbowl's of all time and i get real mad when all these Cardinals fans are freaking out cause they lost the game...they arn't even real fans way to hate your team then jump on their bandwagon when they finally get good...the cards deserve better than the fans of Arizona (I do acknowlegde the few real fans of Arizona who are the class acts and are taking the loss well u guys are great fans!!)|`|m4wFJPAOaa	Yep amazing when ya cheat|`|cqps4ujeaa	No, but I think it would rate in the top 5.  It was a little bit worse than last years because you have an underdog facing a juggernaut dynasty.  However, nothing will ever top the AFL prevailing over the NFL and the guarantee in Superbowl III.    Still, it was pretty good.|`|YSoBO3tpaa	i didn't get to watch   ="(|`|gdW8rZt8aa	I do think it was an awsome SuperBowl, but my favorite has to be SuperBowl XL, because it was the last one that Bettis played in.

The cards deserved the win but I will take the 6 pack. LOL Great job STEELERS!!!!!!|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	I think it's one of the best I've ever seen. Whether it was better than last year's, I'm not so sure, but it's much closer than I expected. James Harrison's play at the end of the first half was the best play I've ever seen in the Super Bowl.|`|BFLLJc7eaa	umm..shut up the people who said cheat...its was a fair game... it was a good game.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	It was a great game all around. We saw the power of the defenses in the first half, and the power of the offenses in the second half. The game was everything I could've hoped for. Hard hits, amazing catches, epic comebacks.. it's an NFL fan's dream to see a game unfold the way it did last night, especially on the grandest stage of all.|`|932b9cfe7a05bb25d03a132b597eff85aa	How can a superbowl be the "best ever"  when the game was rigged?  A source from Fox Sports out here said eeach ref was paid an additional $50,000 to steer the game in the stealers favor.  I'm sure this will come out in a few years kind of like the NBA scandal.|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	I think everyone thinks this was one of the best Super Bowls ever. I know I sure do. I am still in awe of that finish. But I can understand the Cardinals being disappointed. The end of both halves being so heartbreaking. And it did seem like the calls were one sided. So don't be surprised if a few Cardinal fans vent at you. It's too bad somebody had to lose that game.
o9DZledyaa	there are several balls used in every nfl football game, not just the superbowl. There are also special balls for kicking and punting. I'm sure some players can purchase certain balls that they scored with, some are probably sent to canton, ohio where the hall of fame is. Some are probably kept by the teams.|`|huHOpRLLaa	why do you care?  lol   but dont they use the same one the whole game  i donno.|`|wysPLMBnaa	2 they switch at halftime... and the mvp or a good player gets 1 of the balls and the coach gets the other one|`|uYFB0PZ9aa	I think just one, but don't take my answer!!!|`|wMHw20WPaa	most likely 2

Doritos ads were great too.|`|myZB9DV3aa	Cardinals. And my favorite commercial was probably either PEPSUBER!!!!! or the Swedish Buddweiser commercial with Connon|`|MMUOu6kEaa	STEELERS! I knew they were going to do greatt!!! they were AMAZINGGG!!!!    100 yard running touchdown = HISTORY BY THE STEELERS    loved the snow globe doritos commericial   and the one about the two horses that fall in love! haha    the budweiser ones were cute with the horses
AA10848322	Being an umpire for those type games, would suggest you remove your aid or turn it off/down.  Batting and running are short distant features of softball.   If you watch you coaches, you'll know what is going on.  Makes no sense to play in discomfort.  Softball is a game to be enjoyed.  Check with you doctor to see what recommendations he/she has for you.   I am sure your coaches will appreciate the fact you will have to count on them even more now.  Enjoy!|`|L77OlY1naa	This should help!!!! Good Luck

4V6V9uN8aa	The biggest acquisitions WWE got from WCW were (Rest their souls) Chris Benoit & Eddie Guerrero.  With Benoit, I know what many will think when they read this & I know the first thing negative that comes to mind, I agree with the thoughts.  But, aside from the man, I respected Chris Benoit the wrestler & his career to the fullest.  He was a born & bred wrestler, someone who was the embodiment of the sport.  He always gave his all, in victory or defeat, he never was one for the politics of the sport or one of those to complain.  The ppv before he left WCW, Chris was to be awarded the WCW championship in a match over Sid Vicious.  He turned it down & still left for WWE because of his self-respect & not wanting a tainted title (the match was not scripted to end the way it did & it ended with Sid's leg under the ropes..).  Coming to WWE, Chris continued his stellar career, earning his push all the way to the top at WM20.    With Eddie Guerrero, Eddie came from a family with a legendary name, respect & status in the sport.  He chose to go his own path & while honoring the Guerrero name, not use it to make his way to the top.  Keeping close to Chavo, he earned his way in WCW, ECW, & WWE while not leaving his nephew behind.  This is something that would have slowed anyone else's career, but not Latino Heat.  Look at Booker T for example.  He was doing good with Stevie Ray (Harlem heat), yet in leaving his brother behind & going solo, he took off but his brother fell & is no longer even in the sport.  Eddie brought unorthodox skill, fiery passion, & unheard of intelligence to WWE (his "Lying, Cheating, Stealing" routine was sensational & entertaining..). Even as a heel, Eddie's star shone through.  In the "Who's your Papi?" storyline with Rey Mysterio, Eddie's heel was being cheered on more than Rey's face, & it was Rey's SON that people wanted Eddie to win..(how crazy is that..?)..    Eddie & Chris are gone physically, but they are always here with us..|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	Booker T|`|444pPdy5aa	Ric Flair    Chris Benoit    Stone Cold Steve Austin    Booker T|`|sUmlxkQlaa	Austin|`|H3nbC71eaa	Definitely Stonecold Steve Austin.

DCNL73ZJaa	Hey, I also had a hard time getting my parents to let me be a goalie they would always say stuff like: you'll get hurt, you only like it for the gear, or you like it now but will you later on when your team loses and its all your fault. I think that you just need to prove to them that girls can play, that you won`t give up, and that you think that you would be good at it. Maybe to prove to your dad that you can be good you should borrow a goalie friend`s gear to at least show him that you can auctualy stand with pads on, (when I first tried to skate with pads on you can say that i got laughed at a lot)If your dad thinks that girls can`t play he is way off girls are just as good as guys. You should tell him that saying stuff like that is just like being racist which is one of the worst things that you can be. If you think that your dad just doesn`t want you to get hurt then you should tell him that if the pads are good (which pretty much all of them are) and that it would be hard to get seriously hurt. As for cheap pads you can go on to goaliemonkey.com, but don`t go to cheap because remember that if you get hurt you will not only have to pay for the pads but also for a better set of pads. Or teams will usually have starter pads. I hope that you get to play I`m sure you will have fun, stop the puck, be a wall, whatever, good luck    Whoa I didn`t think I wrote that much|`|WnQ3fhVhaa	I am not in Montreal or Canada. But I can offer you this advice. See if your local rink has a G O A L program or something similar . It is basically a program some rinks offer to try hockey for free or very reduced prices. They even give you the gear for each session. Down here it is a four week program . One day a week. Then if you are doing well and really like it , your parents can see that and then they usually can get you put into a program there and get discounts towards equipment . I am a woman player. you can always stress how great exercise it is and the friends you will make will always be a positive . As others have said you can look to used gear and team gear sell offs after their seasons. It is expensive. maybe sign a contract with your parents to stick with it for however amount of time and you will do these chores to offset the expense . As for Dad maybe show him any of the Olympic teams Canadian and USA . Not to mention the NWHL that is up there . It could also get you a college scholarship when that time comes as well. Good luck. Never give up until you get what you want|`|e49064124148a09ea71e47cc14257a0aaa	Only  big girls play hockey, especially goalie!|`|BhXMno7faa	any girl can play hockey they need to show the coach that they can play|`|da62458ece1b3065043627f06d56a105aa	Growing up in a family full of hockey players, I never had to convince my parents to let me play, so I can't really help you there.    Pads- Most programs provide them for beginning goalies. Also, local sporting goods stores. DO NOT GO TO CHAIN STORES(*****, Sports Authority, etc.) FOR USED EQUIPMENT. If you have a local Play It Again sports, go there!     Leagues- the fact that you are near Montreal is HUGE plus. Go to the local rink and ask the manager, Also, search "Girls Hockey in Lakeshore area" or something along those lines, and you should get some hits.    Talk to your dad more. Here are some facts to use-  ~ Girls hockey has become increasingly popular since 1996.  ~ Many Girls play on all girls teams, and these teams are just as competitive as boys select teams.  ~ Girls hockey while not as physical as mens, is still very skills oriented.    Good Luck, and I hope you get the chance to play. I don't know what I'd do if I wasn't playing hockey.|`|9i4Rxqknaa	You can get used equipment, someone mentioned Play It Again Sports, which is a really good store for everything. They also have new stuff too, which you could get later on if your parents see how committed you are. Figure out some way to show them your commitment level. Maybe help more around the house or get a part-time job to earn some of your own money to help pay. If they see you going out of your way to achieve this, they'll realize how much you want it.    And girl's can definitely play hockey. We may not be allowed to check, but we can and do get physical. Also, I think girl's have to learn to be a little more skilled with their puck handling since they can't rely on checking to take the puck away from opponents. Maybe find a girl's game in the area or find one on youtube and show your dad. Hopefully he'll see girl's can play!|`|ZNFjSlKvaa	Go for it, I convinced my parents. It took a good 2 years but they came around.  Go to play it again sports, check out the used pads. Good deals. Some league's even have goalie gear for the starters to use. Or do you know any goalies or any players overall. Ask them if they have any old gear they don't use. I got my first year gear from my cousin and used that until I proved I was committed and totally into hockey. good luck, and trust me you wont have any issues finding leagues where you live. Go to the local rink and ask around or im sure you will see girls hanging out. Google it.|`|C2urTrMtaa	Im a girl and this has been such a dream of mine for so many years. I just dont think im cut out for the team im going to be on. But you should deffinatly look into it and the team you might be on and go to some practices and games and see how you would cope with the sport and if you would get along with everyone.    And also goalie is a very big responsiblity for your team, if you loose, they MIGHT blame it on you. Think that through.      good luck =]

xGLyp2TOaa	The limit is not passing out.  Most track and field athletes do not want to train between 85 to 95 percent.  This is usually refered to as "dead zone" training.  meaning your body gets no benefit from the current workout you are doing.    Putting your body to the point of exhaustion is ok if done with supervised training that will benefit the athlete.  You shouldnt be doing it if you dont know what specifically the training your doing will improve.  This just is wasting enegry for no return and could also lead to senseless injuries.  Lastly you should be giving your proper recovery days and training.    My best advice would to be seek professional input and not just go doing random workouts on your own.|`|BBsR8hwLaa	The limit is feeling your bowels come loose, throwing up stomach fluids, and seeing the world pulse in front of you all the while feeling lactic acid burn in your throat.

Gaborik and Hossa have made it very clear they would like to play together next year.  Where that is going to be is yet to be seen.  Now that Henrik Zetterberg got his long contract, it freed up more space in the Red Wings cap than they originally would have had.  Therefore I would not rule out the Wings trying to keep Hossa and possibly bringing in Gaborik, however they would then most likely have to part ways with Johan Franzen or Jiri Hudler.

The Steelers won, so you might as well get over it.|`|3f8b99665e458abd271e7f591d9a76a7aa	AHH stop complaining u lost i won so go wipe your snout and tears with your designer clothes crybaby|`|P1mf9Zzeaa	I agree.  There was a vast gap between the number of penalties called against the cardinals versus those called against the steelers.  That roughing the passer call was a complete joke.  I can't believe that they didn't take the time to make sure that that was a fumble on the last play.  It may have been a fumble, but it was very, very hard to tell in just the 20 seconds they took to look at it.  There's more, but I'm not going to get into it.  That last drive was amazing and they did make the plays that needed to be made.  The Steelers still should have won the game, but the reffing was a bit disproportionate.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	It comes down to this: Steelers fans will "see" a play that in their minds, should be a penalty, when Cardinals fans look at the same play and say, "so, where's the foul"?     And vice versa.    Fans see what they want to see, instead of what actually occured. I'm not saying you shouldn't - if my team was in the big game, I'd be furious and spur-of-the-moment, pissed off at the refs. But then I go back, see that what I thought was a penalty, really was not, I admit to making myself look foolish.    Really, take a couple days, go back and see that the flag that didn't occur in fact didn't DESERVE to be called, and you'll be fine.|`|WTQtchbvaa	Not really. What did the Steelers do before or after the game that was classless? I know Harrison's mini "fight" was classless but you ignore the fact that the guy hit him in the nuts, is that not classless? The Steelers had the game won and threw it away twice before regaining it. The refs were hand picked by the NFL, the best officiating crew throughout the season is the one that officiates the game. Stop CRYING, you played a good game but the BETTER TEAM WON. Why dont you show some class and admit that the 12-4 team with the toughest schedule beat the 9-7 team with probably the weakest schedule in NFL history. You got 6 free wins from rams, seahawks, and 49ers, you got blown out by the eagles, vikings, and patriots. You couldnt have possibly been the better team. Please, lets be REALISTIC|`|gfB5VNXTaa	I did see some missed calls, but the refs made some bad calls too.  Like running over the holder?  The guy was sprinting to block the ball and the 250 lbs. man could not stop himself.  They have to realize that and cut some slack.|`|gUMucKOkaa	I am a Cardinal fan but I guess that I did not see what you did. You don't mention specific calls but I saw a TD called back against Pittsburgh and a safety because of a penalty called against Pittsburg that allowed us to take the lead.     Frankly, I am embarrassed by some of the whining I have read from some of my fellow Cardinal fans.     Hopefully, we can play in the Super bowl again next year.|`|myZB9DV3aa	there were SOME missed calls. But trust me, if your a Cards fan, then imagine your pain, then multiply it by 10. THAT's how bad we Seahawks fans felt in Superbowl XL. This superbowl was a LOT more fair than Superbowl XL.  The officiating was decent, but the last play WAS INDEED A FUMBLe, WARNER HAD NO CONTROL WHATSOEVER on the last play.    I rooted for the Cardinals, because we (seahawks) are division brothers, but yeah, the game was a little unfair, BUT NOTHING COMPARED TO SUPERBOWL XL. I mean, honestly, tell me, when you watched Superbowl XL did you not think it was rigged????     It just seems like the refs hate the NFC west, and keep robbing us.|`|bCmqScVlaa	Oh God, here we go again.  How many whining Card fans can be on Yahoo?  Talk about classless!!!!!  Even some of your own are getting embarrassed over all your whining.  Give it up already.|`|vFasAFBUaa	Yes
0880ac45fbb6456e1e6cd4a33571a64faa	Cards fans can't accept the fact that they were outplayed and are looking for a convenient excuse to explain why they lost.   Naturally they are going to say it's the ref's fault their team lost.     Like the person above me said, they probably weren't even Cardinal fans until a couple of weeks ago.|`|4uSRVZNNaa	thank you. I couldn't agree more.  they sound like all the whiney seachickens fans from 3 years ago.  most of them weren't even cards fans until 2 weeks ago.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	LOL.|`|sl8ffVHVaa	Could not have said it any better myself.     GO STEELERS!!!!!!|`|gdW8rZt8aa	I totally agree with you!|`|KhBmlaefaa	I agree. Holmes clearly made the catch and had feet in bounds touching the ground. And Warner indeed fumbled. They need to get over it and move on.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Cardinals fans aren't necessarily crying over the fact that they lost.. but they (as well as everyone) knows that with Warner possibly retiring, and a very mediocre Matt Leinart taking over, it's possible the Cardinals won't see another Super Bowl appearance for a very long time..|`|2pxGPcxaaa	james harrison is still a butthole.|`|7Z25Rmxoaa	cardinals lost because loser John McCain was rooting for them and jinxed em|`|SJEXY7Ufaa	well said!  STEELERS RULE|`|8Bu8pZbraa	James Harrison SHOULD HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT OF THE GAME FOR WHAT HE DID, PUNCHING THE GUY WHILE HE WAS DOWN. IT WAS DESPICABLE AND INDICATIVE OF THE STEELERS AS A TEAM. But since the refs were fans of the steelers, all they did was a personal foul. Disgusting    Think about it. If Richard Seymour did the same thing, you would be saying it too.|`|myZB9DV3aa	Okay, from what i hear, you are a fcuking retarded asswipe. The steelers are nowhere near the best team ever, and don't give sum **** about 6 SUPERBOWLS, actually 5 superbowls, SUPERBOWL XL was the most rigged game in the history of sports, so honestly, looking at stats, the Seahawks won.Mccain better than obama? quit smoking crack you queer. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA OBLITERATED THE SENIOR CITIZEN IN A LANDSLIDE ELECTION VICTORY|`|LVjM9k8yaa	To some degree I agree. I do think Harrison should have been ejected but the whiny, conspiracy loving Cardinal fans are making idiots of themselves. One last time, his toes were down, he did break the plane and it was a fumble!    Steelers fans though need to be classy winners though and continue to allow the desert people to make idiots of themselves. I'm not a Steeler or Cardinal fan, I just like watching the reactions of both sides.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|7czpjXQSaa	You know you need to sit down and shut up, afore somebody and I aint sayin, come out an beat your A55|`|GNaj2fudaa	Yes the steelers are the best team ever(:    & i agree all these cardinals fans need to get over the fact that we beat em and that touchdown was ligit.|`|M5JwVDQZaa	GO STEELERS!!! THEY R THE BEST TEAM EVER!!!!|`|aOx2hovgaa	i agree...GOOD JOB STEELERS!!!!|`|fcc5487b88b4303d263e3ddb1df9a865aa	haha to the cards-all your s**t talkin and we still got you! as for harrison,that man ran a 100 yd td-in my opinion he should be able to hit someone just because that was AWESOME!!!!(longest td in superbowl history!)plus we have 6 rings here in the burgh now(another historical moment in superbowl history,we are the first to have 6!)im sure the cards are butthurt but thats what you get for talkin s**t about the  1 defense in the league! STEELERS BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|su5FwuuDaa	Typical Steelers fans or any great dynasty fans being cocky.     It still doesn't change the fact that Harrison played dirty for a play and should have been ejected and the refs were totally for the Steelers.|`|nr6KBe8Naa	GO STEELERS!!!!!!!! 6 TIME SUPERBOWL CHAMPS!! WE ARE PROUD SIX-BURGH FANS!!! WOOOOO!!!!     Obama wanted Steelers and Mccain wanted Cardinals but i like Mccain better than Obama!!     we have a LOT in common    i completely agree with you on EVERYTHING!
8Bu8pZbraa	Oh my god no. The patriots are the only team that can beat the steelers in the playoffs consistently. Hell, if Tom Brady never got injured there was a slight chance they could go undefeated again.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Yes.|`|7V79OMMHaa	Actually the Pats loss to the Jets had more to do with them not getting into the playoffs.    To answer your question though I don't know. We will just have ot wait next season and see how things play out.      Stay Cool|`|bvHg5aixaa	ya beacuse the patriots are old|`|dL82oSHTaa	If Brady was playing pitts. would not have made the supper bowl.  Look what Peyton Manning did to them this year.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Look at what the Patriots did last year to Pittsburgh. The Steelers literally just blitzed every play, and whoever agreed to terms with that gameplan against Tom Brady made the biggest mistake of their life.    Warner last night.. he was a wimp. He looked like Brady Quinn or Matt Cassel, averaging maybe 5-6 yards per throw. That's NOT how Arizona won games earlier in the playoffs or in the regular season, and when you have to resort to catch-up late in the game, it'll cost.|`|kV53Roz1aa	Sorry, but it's bogus to think that automatically NE is in the SB if they have Brady... let alone win the SB.    And I remember my boys blitzing Brady to perfection when we stopped that 20+ game winning streak.|`|Bgpk4npBaa	no|`|vFasAFBUaa	Patriots would have won the Super Bowl no question|`|8gj20XXsaa	Giants would have won if plax was back, i hate the pats, sorry i am a giants fan, but my ego prevents me from saying anything nice about the patriots.|`|30LMCJrAaa	The Steelers wouldn't have been in the SuperBowl.    It's not an automatic that New England would have won the SuperBowl...the Giants beat them last time...

If you go for it 100%, you will be fine.|`|Fj8TLt5Taa	If you are a decent runner, and you can at least beat some people out on the track, you should join the track team. Because if you work hard and become dedicated to the sport you will begin to master technique and form, thus enabling you to become a winner in the races. Another thing, ask your coach if you can try the triple jump. It is possible to do very well in that event, even if you aren't the best runner.|`|9kuz5To4aa	Be a long distance runner.

Q6qBxKbAaa	Good and great game. I thought Steelers was about to lose too but their defense and offense it make me shock how strong they are. It was good Super Bowl game, I lived ever see my life. It was good match up.|`|gdW8rZt8aa	Great game! I am happy they came back!|`|qAqsz3bBaa	great game. close to the wire.|`|Jf8LiEw2aa	It was a great game, and fun to watch.. In the end, I was disappointed that the Video Replay Assistant didn't give the Cardinals the one more play they deserved, but it was very exciting, and hopefully the competitiveness of the last 2 years becomes a trend...|`|OnGQOVlaaa	Probably one of the best games, but not better than last years superbowl.  Cards had ittt!!!! damn Holmes....|`|SrmxaoNzaa	If your talking about the "lets see how bad the refs can **** up the super bowl" them it was the best since the ****** the seahawks out of their title.  Before you blast me about being a cardinals fan or seahawks fan that is not the true im a panther's fan so if anything i should be going go steelers but not when the refs have robbed two very good teams and given the stealers it.      i quess i can start with the int return a steeer playervwas holding and tugging on warner's jersey which is a 5 yd penalty now im not 100% sure on it but from my angle it looked like that plus there was block in the back plus he was down therefor it should not have been a touchdown    also the constant roughting the whatever the **** it was penalty's.  i know im not the only one who has never heard of roughing the holder plus all the roughing the passer penalties on arizona that were not there was several that pitt should of had called on them. they let a 27 yr old guy barely get tapped and its a penalty but a 37 yr old guy gets hit late its no big deal no i tell you what it is its bullshit    the santonio holmes td grab or whatever you call it he was not in one of his feet one on the other and unless his foot is 3 or 4 inches longer than the other there was no way he touched. also after the catch he was not penalized for using the ball as a prop which is an automatic penalty but it was not called    now finally the one every steeler fan will say im crazy for but that fumble was not a fumble warner's incomplete pass earlier that they ruled a fumble was less evedent but this was a lot more clear plus they didnt even review it     overall if they got the penalty from holmes using the ball as a prop they would have started at the arizona 38 with two timeouts left and if everything happened like it did last night and they kept the ball cause it was not a fumble tack on the penalty on a steeler that was 15 yrds they would have been on the pitt 14 yd line with like 5 secs left with a legit shot to more than likely throw a high ball to fitz for the win     I also like how the steelers were all emotional about the win like they earned it they didnt earn it it was handed to them on a silver platter     also i almost forgot how about the asshole of the year who punched francisa or whatever his name is he should have been ejected    all this game proved was that the refs were protecting their investment at the nearest casino|`|lGclixPuaa	dissappointing

M0eyMvqlaa	Don't pay attention to those racist pricks. Continue to do your thing man and make them respect you by showing your talents on the field. I'm African American and I know how you must feel, they only expect us to play Basketball and Football. Just do your thing and leave all of that aside. Peace!|`|c3tADklmaa	If your schooling them in baseball, who's laughing. You have to act tough, this is racism and it happens everywhere anytime.|`|AlZPIAtmaa	Maybe it's your grammar that's upsetting to them.  Have you tried communicating with them like an educated human being?      You're only a JV player?  Maybe you're just not good enough and that's troubling to the others.  You're bringing them all down man.    Stop pointing fingers at everyone else and accept that maybe YOU are the problem not because you're black but because you're a whiny baby.  Do your job.  Do it well.|`|sHXazyDWaa	Screw them. Do somthing that will really make THEM look like crap and then they most likely ill shut up.|`|FsnxfhEuaa	Tell Them, Don't Judge Someone By their Race.

NBA  Player, Take a look at him, He's a different Race, Look How Much People Love Him! Over 80% of the world Likes him.

BQB8MoZoaa	Your list is reasonable as each fighter you've listed has a prodigious trait of being either egotistical (Tito, Karo), moody (Danzig), over-the-top (Guida), or arrogant (Koscheck), among others. Actually, Tito displays all of these traits.    Despite these traits, I have to say that I still like them all. I like them for their individual characteristics for among their bad traits they still have good traits.    Mac Danzig and Clay Guida aren't really that bad. Yes, Danzig is a curmudgeon, but he's a good fighter and does seem like a good guy once you got to know him. Clay just gets really emotional and starts acting like an animal, but that's just his way.    Karo put me off when he argued with Nate Diaz on TUF and said the lame cliche later on, "Does he know who I am?" Talk about ego. Geeez.    Koscheck is getting much better. He just loves fighting, dedicates himself to giving us good fights and actually seems like a decent guy.    Your other list is also good. Rich Franklin is also may favorite fighter. He's humble and classy.    A fighter who deserves more hatred or dislike is Rob Emerson who used to be in a gang of rich thugs who together with his crew beat up innocent people. He's a real douchebag.    Another moron is War Machine. He constantly posts idiotic and pathetic posts on his My Space page. He got kicked out of the UFC for stating that Evan Tanner deliberately killed himself because he had no money or a future -- which is totally and unforgivably incorrect and disrespectul.|`|mIEiQcyMaa	I don't like Guida, Koscheck, or Parisian either.  But I'll watch them fight.  I feel the same way about Penn, like his fights, don't like when he opens his mouth.  I will not watch Lesnar, he's not very entertaining.  And he has a tattoo on his chest that looks like a dong.    Speaking of Dong, I like the Stun Gun.  I also really like St. Pierre, and Franklin (he really doesn't do anything to offend anyone, does he?)|`|b0faTDlJaa	I agree with on all xcept for 1 from each group. 1st is Clay, He looks like a little happy hyper cave man. He doesnt talk shiz and is usually humble.2nd is Nate, i dont hate the guy i just dont like him and FYI every1 hates Tito lol|`|AA11517536	Wow, and I thought I was the only person on earth who hated Clay Guida.  Glad I'm not alone.|`|ywCTRpCiaa	I absolutely agree with "netpred".  Everything he said is the absolute truth, and Fedor is awesome.  Also, I really admire George St. Pierre for his good sportsmanship.|`|Vrd8gB61aa	Tito Ortiz is cocky forget him. Mac Danzig is decent, Clay Guida just needs to cut his hair and he is a very textbook fighter. Koscheck is good.  Karo parisian not so much|`|V2nAiEHkaa	I can't stand  Lyoto Machida-too evasive (ran away from tito) however i was impressed when he fought silva so maybe he's got that out of his system.  Brock Lesnar-He sucks ok, he's the kimbo of UFC.  Karo Parysyan- he's just not that good, totally overrated, attitude sucks.  Nate Diaz-******* smartass, describes opponents as mother fuckers.  Chris Leben-druggy  Matt Serra- voice gets on my nerves  Anderson Silva- not so much him, just the people who think he's never lost before.  Rashad Evans-Way overrated, tito owned his ***.  Michael Bisping-almost as overrated as rashad, has yet to beat anyone notable.  Babalu-prick and a half  B.J. Penn- totally disrespected GSP and got owned.  FAVORITES  Randy, Ken Shamrock, Tito Oritz, Chuck Liddell, Forrest Griffin, Rich Franklin, Evan Tanner, Matt Hughes, Josh Kosceck, Sean Sherk, Kenny Florian.|`|325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	You like the class guys, and I can't blame you.    I wish the UFC kept a shorter leash on its fighter's behavior.  I think the old way of thinking is that if you have a bunch of cussing, arrogant bar brawlers in the octagon, it somehow makes the sport more "mainstream."  This is about the biggest insult to the intelligence of an audience that has ever been delivered by a promotional organization in the history of sport.      MMA has evolved.  It's athletes have evolved.  Long gone are the days when a tank abbot can step into the octagon with real fighters and walk out with more than a very occasional victory.      I'd love to see more class fighters and organizations hit MMA.  I'd love to see fighters fined when they step up to the mic in the ring and drop the f-bomb.  I'd love to see all the WWE style comments shunned by fans and promoters alike.      We need more GSPs in the cage today.  That guy is a gentleman and a true martial artist.|`|TH1fT6rdaa	I understand why you dislike Ortiz, Koscheck, and Parysian, but why Guida?  I think he talks too much after his fights, but he fights hard and never talks trash to anybody.  He's not the most skilled, but he makes up for that with his intense training.    Also, why do you like Nate Diaz?  I think he is the biggest d-bag in MMA.  He and his brother Nick are complete jerks.  In his win against Kurt Pellingro, Diaz was getting dominated and pulled out a lucky leg triangle.  As soon as he sunk it in, he flipped off the crowd and got pissed when the UFC censored it on the replay.  He also said after his split decision win over Josh Neer that nobody in the UFC knows how to strike well.  And during his fight against Guida, he flexed after each round.  What's with that?    Also, Brock Lesnar is one of the most arrogant @$$holes I can think off.    Chris Leben was a jerk during The Ultimate Fighter, but he's matured now and I like him.  I thought Danzig was misunderstood during the show.  He was there to fight and didn't want to mess around with pranks and stuff.  The other fighters constantly instigated him, which would piss me off too.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	I don't care for many of them, Rich Franklin is awesome though. I like his fighting style, it's more focused and basic than a lot of the other's.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	deigo sanchez|`|qHMBkLx2aa	Tito is only a douchebag because he knows how to market himself and he does it well. I don't agree with some of his antics but they do make him stand out.     Karo Parisian is by far my least favorite fighter. He should have lost the fight last Saturday. Stupid judges.     Add Brock Lesnar to the list of fighters that I can't stand. I hate his arrogance and disrespect to the sport and fighters.    I'd add GSP, Anderson SIlva, and Fedor Emelianenko to the list. All three are amazingly talented fighters and they are still very humble to the sport and very very respectable to their opponents.|`|BNqbOfBsaa	I am not the biggest Tito fan but I respect him a lot because he put people in the seats and he was part of the biggest PPV UFC event. If not for guys like him the UFC would not be where its at. As a matter of fact there was a time when he carried the UFC on his back! He hyped up the fights alot himself... which again most people including ME did not like! lol. But overall sometimes you need people like him. Plus he was trying to help out his fellow fighters by trying to get them better contracts. Whats wrong with that? some guys only get paid $15 k for a fight! before taxes!     Guida I do not like either. Not sure why.     Koscheck I dislike for being narrow minded, and having a huge ego.     Parisian is just fool of himself. He should be fighting in a lower weight class with his beer belly.          Machida is my favorite from the guys you mentioned. He just seems like a nice guy so its hard to dislike him. Plus I don't think many people appreciate how good he really is.|`|616f37abb5f6bb497fbb33bae765a7e2aa	So you hate Tito Ortiz,Mac Danzig,Clay Guida,Josh Koscheck,Karo Parisian, but yet like Nate Diaz and Chris Leben.     Tito is just a trash talker who likes to hype his fights. Which you would probably do the same thing if you were getting a percentage of the ppv buys for your fights.    Karo Parisian I totally agree with you. His whole I'm Armenian crap make me laugh.

126986d456c7650b3fab46b5cfe905a1aa	I believe they would've because notice the common factor there...Kobe. Last year Denver wasn't going to beat us and Utah wouldn't have beat us with either Gasol or Bynum, because neither had an answer for Kobe. San Antonio would've been a bit more difficult because Andrew can't guard Tim. BUT! In order for Tim to beat Andrew he has to play outside, so the Lakers probably would've played Odom on Tim, which would've neutralized the Spurs' advantage. By allowing Bynum to stay in the paint, it takes away from Parker's driving. And Kobe/Ariza on Ginobli means the Lakers would've still pulled it out against the Spurs.    I think with Bynum instead of Gasol in the Finals, the Lakers would've actually had a better chance at beating the Celtics. Again, Bynum wouldn't guard Garnett, he'd've guarded Perkins, and Odom would've guarded Garnett.    The Lakers were beaten inside by Boston. Gasol just can't provide that toughness that we need, that Bynum could. And I don't know what you're talking about as far as Bynum not being developed. Bynum was having a phenomenal year last year, by far the best of his young career. He was scoring points and pulling down rebounds, he did a tremendous job offensively and defensively last year before he got hurt.     Check out these stats from last year:  Bynum: 13.1 ppg, 10.2 rpg, 63.6% FG%, 2.1 bpg  Gasol: 18.8 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 58.9% FG%, 1.6 bpg, 3.5 apg    So you can see that Bynum was just as effective as Gasol last year if not more so. (Gasol's stats are from since he joined the Lakers last year.)|`|3teWTOPqaa	Well last season Lakers were leading the West prior to the Gasol trade, so I say we have a Finals chance, but Andrew was not as developed last season, and I doubt he could have ran the triangle with Kobe as well as Gasol did last season.    Spurs might have beaten us last year if we never had Gasol, as hard as people have been on him about being soft in the finals, he actually did a decent job covering Duncan for us.|`|wKGZ0h8Paa	No.  Gasol provided points that Bynum wouldn't have.|`|xeEOTsyYaa	The Spurs would have beat them.    I don't think Bynum could have guarded Duncan as well as Gasol did.|`|GswnLKtQaa	I remember the Lakers have the best record in the west before they got gasol and bynum and odom were playing really well. I think they can.|`|d7ccOZbdaa	i dont think so|`|PbrGLvonaa	no... Lakers went to the finals arguably because of Gasol's skills... Gasol maybe softer than Bynum but Gasol has better skills... plus Gasol can flop since he's European|`|vFbzBo4eaa	They would just dream abour the finals.|`|UadP6GO8aa	No. Simply because Bynum isn't a big offensive threat and doesn't have the skills that Gasol has. Gasol may be a little soft, but he played a huge role in the Lakers Final appearence last year. No disrespect, but Bynum is overrated big time.|`|AA11488609	No, they would have lost in the playoffs, probably in the 2nd round or conference finals depending on who they would have played and where they would have been seeded.
SiOjEH00aa	yup, but it will depend on torres's fitness, and if rafa has bought cover in for torres, and if so, who.    also, looks like we've kept agger, all that rubbish about him leaving earlier in janurary!|`|456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	To be honest no because one league game will not and does not change your season.  If you look the the season so far in overall, we have struggled and even recently we haven't been playing well.  So I don't feel we have turned a corner.  In fact things are about to get much tougher now with Manchester United in front because we are now chasing them instead of having the luxury of sitting at the top with a healthy gap.  I think it will be a good experience for mounting a more serious challenge next season though.    Manchester United are great at grinding out the results as it is something they have been doing for donkey years now.|`|AA12066574	I'm sure that Reds fans are encouraged to see Torres getting on the score sheet, but the reality is that ManUre have several players who can carry their team when they heat up (Ronaldo, Rooney, Tevez, etc.). If the Reds can't keep Torres healthy, it will be a long and frustrating second half.|`|uXXbegw5aa	I agree.  I think that we played well in the Chelsea match and in the end I think we deserved the win.  I do think we have turned a corner ;)  Torres seems to be back to match fitness aswell so this could be vital for us :)|`|Gr99OjQuaa	youre right about man u not being able to scrap wins, but, they're getting healthy and will start to click - they always seem unstoppable in the second half of the season.    the difference will also be that united scraps away wins, 3pts, liverpool goes on and draws 1 point. hence why united is in first and liverpool is chasing.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	No, you won't play against 10 men and have a biased ref every game.|`|bNykcEVXaa	LMAO .....

Just wondering....    So I think the bad run MIGHT be over but you cannot yet account for any of the above loool

Y1uvSgg7aa	what is wrong with the aussie selectors? they have rocks in their heads for sure. imo, replace warner with hughes, ponting should definitely have been replaced by carseldine. if there was ever a straight swap, that would be one. the selectors have tried the young guns tactic all summer and where has it got them? i think that maybe they should've woken up and picked form players, such as carseldine, hodge (i know injured) noffke (also injured again now). btw, tait needs to go. bring back hilfy.|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	If i were a selector, i woulda replaced Dave Hussey and given Carseldine, Hughes or Katich a go.

I remember Adam taking two wickets in one over... As for Callum hmmm yeah without looking at stats I have no idea.     I dont mind this team at all, certainly has the firepower there but do we have the brains?... Lots of young players with very little experiance, this is where M Clark needs to step up, being young (age wise) with a wealth of experiance, this will work in our favor!..     Tait needs to get rid of his leg side wides, have a look at last match, 11 wides compared to NZ's 2, different of 9?, dont forget the runs that were scored off the extra deliveries. Was this the difference?? who knows. One thing I do know, dont bowl them and it cant be included.|`|caAuJJwGaa	Callum Ferguson has been a good contributor to the improvement of SA cricket this year.  He has played some important (and aggressive) innings in the SA middle order in 20/20 and ODD matches.  I've been pushing for him to get a go for a while now so I'm thrilled he is getting an opportunity.  Hopefully he carries the same game plan into the international arena and does not fall into the conservative push and prod approach the Aussies are coming unstuck with at the moment.    One other point - why not Lee Carseldine?  Sure, he is the wrong side of 30, but he has made 4 or 5 domestic 20/20 50's this season, has made a couple of ODD centuries with a strike rate of 100 or better, and one of his 50's came in the biggest match of the year: the KFC Big Bash semi which determined which team went to India.  He is the form player in Australia in domestic limited overs cricket, and should be given a chance to shine.  He can open or bat 3, and would also make a very good 6 in the closing or consolidation role after another Aussie top order collapse.  He should definitely be in the frame for the T20 world championship.
LzkujA3Faa	Andrew Symonds is not insane!!!!!    Why do the bloody officials at the CA make him look like one? IMO, they have no right to talk anything against Symonds. If they had taken a strong action in favour of Symonds in the infamous Monkey Gate incident, instead of paying their loyalties to the big brother BCCI, then things would have been different.    Do they think that keeping him away from cricket, locking him away in some rehabilitation centre, like some bloody drug addict or psychopath, is going to do him any good? I have never found him emotionaly or mentally unstable when he was playing for his team. Why do his off field antics get blown out of all proportion?     I read that Ricky had strongly endorsed for Symond's inclusion but CA has rejected that too. How can you expect a captain to win matches for his team when he is not given the team he wants?    I just can't hide my disgust at all who say that  Symonds is a disgrace for our team! Just lay off him and let him do what he is so good at,that is,playing cricket!|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I don't care what those jerks at CA say, I still hold them responsible for Symonds present state of mind. Sure he was a bit wild, but the fact is, he was publicly humiliated by CA turning their backs on him to appease India after the Bhaji racial abuse thing. That would blow anyone's mind I think. I have seen people commit suicide over less  then that.They could fix it all right now by owning up to being wrong & publicly apologising to Roy.We are too short on experienced players now to go dropping them|`|AA11088802	oh man ! that will another blow to aus cricket|`|5GUjFJjkaa	Bingalee has a point re CA but I doubt that this alone has contributed to his odd behaviour.

Billy's mom has affair with psychologist.|`|yeb7fyHsaa	They make Andrew Symonds sound like a psychopath!     He's not! What do they think he'll do after witnessing a loss against South Africa? Create the next V-tech massacre? Become the next Hannibal? Become the antichrist?    They need to relax and let him play the game. He's good at the game and is 'mentally stable' enough to make runs, bowl well, field well, and still not do anything too crazy.     I'm hoping this doesn't spell the end to Andrew Symonds' career, just for insulting McCullum. I'm sure he's not the only one who did that. He's probably the only one 'smart' enough to do it on radio.     Give him a psychologist and let him play!    EDIT* Damo! nice answer m8!|`|KXLs6K2yaa	Andrew symonds is a disgrace. Mouthing off about another player is just wrong. I can only imagine what he had said to that indian player. Its no wonder insults were thrown    Its not about winning. I think the australian team is far beyond winning. Its more about sportsmanship since they lack it. I dont know where you get off for sticking up for him but your attitude says it all. Imagine if a kiwi player had mouthed off about ponting. How would you react? Hypocrites|`|Eq6LEVq0aa	I think cricket Australia are right to do that, i think it's better if they let Symonds undergo rehab and let him get back into the right frame of mind before actually exposing him to International cricket again.    I agree with Mark Waugh, it's a bit of a gamble taking Symonds to South Africa, that series isn't going to be a walk in the park, they need in form players who are capable of handling the pressure.|`|AcbPUQY5aa	Symonds has sacked himself.Poor form and boorish behaviour means its time for Australian cricket to move on without him.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	Boy, and I thought that the NZ cricket team had problems.|`|1ayvDGcLaa	Symonds is a maverick and that is fine by me as long as he delivers.  Right now he is a liability to the team. I think there are enough people making excuses for him.  It would be good for him to remember that neither CA nor Australia called him a  monkey.  So will he kindly take it out on others and not his supporters?|`|gfxXikenaa	"Are we just about to loose another great to Australian Cricket?..."  its spelled "LOSE" not loose!    anyway   yes Symonds is doing his best to be taken out of cricket by testing CA's patience.|`|caAuJJwGaa	I have never liked Andrew Symonds the person.  Everything that has happened in the last 18 months has only strengthened my opinion of him.    Even so, I am sympathetic to what has happened to him post "monkeygate".  Binga is right, CA turned a blind eye and did nothing publicly to support the player.  Even if they didn't believe there was any substance to the allegations, they could have handled the matter much better.  While we don't know what went on behind closed doors with Symonds, if their public bumbling of the whole thing was anything to go by it is safe to assume the administrators did little to heal the wounds caused by the very public media storm.    CA just expected that to be put aside and for the man to continue to go out and a) perform at a high level b) carry himself as an up-standing ambassador for Australian cricket (in spite of a string of infractions long before this) and c) generate massive revenues for the Board from ticket sales & marketing (CA's main motivation)    Symonds for his part has shown is displeasure for the administrators by publicly "acting out" his frustrations.  He has had spats in bars, "gone fishing", and then, as a representative of Aussie cricket, went on air sh*tfaced and rubbished other cricketers.  I'm not saying these have all been deliberate acts, but I don't think Symonds would be feeling sorry for the distress they have brought to the administration.    The problem he has is he is alienating the captain and the rest of the team in the process.  Right now, he is a locker room cancer, and from that respect, I don't care how much people may think he can contribute to the success of the team - he should not be there.    CA has made a rod for its own back with its handling of monkeygate.  It has alienated the player and knows it is at the root of his drinking/psychological problems, so it feels obliged now to bring him in for the cold.  Unfortunately for CA nothing can be done to undo the sins of the past.|`|0nXh4l8Baa	It entirely depends on Roy. If he has the character and mental strength to bounce back, he will. If not, you could shout from the rooftops that CA is to blame, but it begs the question- what is the age of the person you are talking about. Is it a juvenile delinquent who is so dependant on guardians to make or break his life? Roy is an extremely talented cricketer, but with zero maturity and an extremely thick head. How many times has he been covered up by CA for his shenanigans? This is aimed at those who blame others for his fate. Has he had a completely clean slate before the india thing? Read up on his past and it SHOULD come to you as a surprise that he actually had a CLEAN record with CA before the McCullum spraying. If anything, CA should be accused of covering up for Roy to such an extent that he has taken it as a personal licence to do and say whatever he wishes, knowing fully well that his position in the team will not be touched, nor will his dollars from the IPL.  Like some others, I am not a supporter of Symonds, the person, though i immensely respect his cricketing abilities. But australia has been known to keep values above all for some time and i am not ready to change that so soon in my mind.  About loosing a great, I think he is no great if he is not mentally strong. He will prove himself one when he comes back and shows the discipline we all need to see from him.|`|b9C8CKo1aa	Yes...Australias loss IPL's Gain....
JC9wAaOsaa	Definitely needs a rest, hectic schedule, trying to captain an inexperienced Australian side would have to take its toll eventually.     I can only speak from my personal views, I play a lot of golf and there is such a thing as too much. You get into a 'stuck' mental attitude, you play day after day and you notice nothing is improving. We schedule into the year a period of three - five weeks of No playing at all. This period just allows the mind to clear out and the body to rest. After the break you come back refreshed and start seeing sub-par rounds again.     I think the rest period will do Ricky the world of good, spending time with family and not having the pressure of everyone on his back will work wonders...|`|Eq6LEVq0aa	Australia being 1 down in this series against New Zealand, i don't think it's right to rest Ponting in the 2nd and 3rd ODI, these are crucial matches in the series. It won't give a lot of confidence to the Australians if they lose this series against New Zealand, and at the moment confidence seems to be the main ingredient missing in this new side.    I agree that Ponting may need to be rested sometime before South Africa, but not right now.|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	If Ponting needs rest,this is the time since it is not smooth going for him.This appears to have been done in consulltation with CA in the interest of the team.  Waugh is a cool customer unlike Ponting.What he says may be right for him not for Ponting.  When Ponting himself had said something similar about IPLWaugh need not have told about IPL involvement..|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	he is right|`|af5d52fd49c3606b73f3d910229c8a9daa	Why do cricketers need to rest?

That is wrong.|`|DfwE83Nbaa	Ponting needs a rest to clear his head from series of misfortunes lately.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Yes.|`|LzkujA3Faa	I think Steve is being a bit unfair to Ricky. it's been a long stint for ricky since the series against india. He has got his own injury problems plus the pressure of capatining an inexperienced side. So as Damo said, it can take its emotional and physical toil.     Australia has a long and hectic schedule coming up too. After the South African tour, we are expected to play Pakistan, then we will fly to England for a monstrous program of nearly four months that starts with the Twenty20 World Cup, the Ashes series, seven ODIs against England and one ODI against Scotland.    So if Ricky is to have a break, it would be against NZ. I don't think it has anything to do with his involvement in IPL.|`|AA11088802	it good to rest b4 a tough tour... and waugh said it rite about ipl|`|fsLMFIpgaa	I think he is & I also Q Ponting's motive. But having said that, I would just like to see Clarke pull off a win or two & show the posturing, procrastinating Ponting up.Even if the Kiwis win, it will be pleasant to watch a match without him. Good luck to both teams.|`|5GUjFJjkaa	I wish none of our players would take part in the IPL.  Ponting has been forced to have a "much needed break" because the selectors want to check out Clarke's captaincy skills. Not that bad an idea I guess. I'm a Ponting fan hope he is still around for the 2011 WC.|`|0QBKiP2naa	Hopefully this will fix our captaincy cos Ponting is a useless PATHETIC captain.

As for the Superbowl, it was a disappointment, since the commercials really sucked this year.|`|RoUFSloWaa	Its Superbowl  and that was the best Steeler game i have seen|`|nATkIg5zaa	Why?? there was some awesome plays like harrison 100 yd run back and  that td catch my fitzgerald and holmes. and the commericals were hilarious not to mention halftime perfomrnace by    bruce springsteen|`|zFpHpqiLaa	it was a good superbowl i was surprised cardinals kept it so close and i thought we were guna lose but then my man holmes caught that pass from roethlisbergr but this superbowl was good cuz we dint expect the cardinals to go so far dats y it was so interesting and then we scored wit like 35 seconds to go i was nervous as **** b4 dat and dats also wot made it great so i cant understand why the **** u thought it stunk|`|jpiFhg1Jaa	Great game...very exciting to watch.|`|ro5xcSt8aa	it waz very interesting and one of the most fought put games till the end|`|3s59vsLNaa	It was a pretty good game.  The game had all the ups and downs that helped create the suspense that I enjoy, which is important when it is between two teams that many probably have very little interest in.      However, the officiating seemed to be a bit one-sided.  For instance, the roughing the passer call on Ben, if were one, should have been equally called for Warner.  The play in the end, which I thought looked like a forward pass (the arm looking as if it were going forward and the ball actually going forward), wasn't reviewed (I mean, the play with Holmes was obvious that he got his feet in, but they reviewed it for what? To be sure.).  Plus, not like there's a script (?), it would have made for greater suspense and a better ending if one last hail marry would have been thrown in hopes for a touchdown...    Besides all that and other things that can probably be called into question, the game was good.  This is coming from someone who cared less on what team won (no money involved, etc.), just wanted a fun game to go along with my chicken wings and beer; but a little more fairness would have been appreciated.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Yep, it stunk.  But, it gave me a good excuse for a Miller Lite, wings, and tomato pizza so I'm happy.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	best super bowl game ever.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	I thought the SuperBOWL. was super|`|gjteVB2Daa	Harrison should be barred from ever playing again after he was thrown out for unnecessary roughness when he kept punching the other team members.|`|OXNiEDROaa	I read thru it and look up when the commercials come on...so I didn't even know who won until today!  lol|`|rzkFHAEJaa	good game|`|01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	better than expected...i didn't expect zona to take the lead in the 4th|`|kAnmzvnSaa	superbowel? i must have missed that.......    But I did see the Super Bowl! =].  FANTASTiC|`|eqDXoCeTaa	One of the best Super Bowls I've ever watched.  I wanted the Cardinals to win, but the game was still awesome.|`|EvDoLydgaa	this SB sucked|`|snUDfcfgaa	It was so great I almost crapped my pants!|`|lXE75yQjaa	Brown liquid, babby!|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	You are not a true football fan if you think that super bowl stunk. Oh, and learn some spelling, its super BOWL.
2zk5K9Njaa	A big man who can score is not the answer.  I would prefer a defensive big like Camby or a potential All-Star to pair with Rose like Monta Ellis.  Sam Smith pointed out a great trade with Golden State on Bulls.com.  You should check it out.  As for right now we need to convince BG7 to be a sixth man(he can be one of the best 6th men of all time) and have a constant rotation.  The three win streak is awsome though.|`|UcHqXPpvaa	http://games.espn.go.com/nba/features/tr...    It might have to wait until Chris Kaman is back healthy, but according to the Clippers that shouldn't be too much longer.    It seems like all three teams win to me:    Minnesota: Loses Miller, who has been disappointing this season, and another unneeded player and gets a true point guard in return. This would allow Foye to move to the sg spot permanently and play to his best ability. Hinrich is a top notch pg whose presence will help every player on the floor.    Clippers: Solidify their starting pf and c instead of juggling three and risk making them unhappy. In return, they get a solid g/f swingman, just like they've been looking for, as well as a young and promising f/c to come off the bench and potentially be molded into a replacement for the aging Marcus Camby. Miller's contract also expires in 2010, so if he doesn't work out, then the Clippers can make a play in free agency.    Chicago: They lose the somewhat expendable Hinrich, clearing up some of the guard glut, and one of the young guys of their sometimes inconsistent front line, and gain exactly what they lack: a true center who can both block shots and anchor the defense, as well as score in the post. This trade allows them to let the younger guys come along and develop. They can then devote more playing time to Thabo Sefalosha and Tyrus Thomas and have them develop into solid contributors to the team.    It seems like a win-win-win trade to me, what do you think?|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Thanks for Chris Duhon man. I understand you could not keep him cause you wanted to try on Thabo Sefolosha more. Which is understandable cause he looks like a pretty good player. But, Duhon is working wonders here.|`|khbLZQHIaa	You're going to need a big man who can score.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	whoa you guys make the wrong move all the time not all the time but most of the time|`|98wFqBwSaa	CB4 or Stoudemire and get rid of all the white boys.|`|0E8SPyyXaa	Maybe Brad Miller  http://games.espn.go.com/nba/features/tr...  Or Jermaine Oneal  http://games.espn.go.com/nba/features/tr...|`|1238d8d31da2946a8a5f08dd1fdb4bcbaa	they need size.the team is too heavy on small guards and have no decent big men.I would like to see Brook Lopez from the Nets come over,he has great potential.maybe they should go for a player like Chris Kaman(when he gets off the injury list),they have three great big men on the Clippers roster and nobody is gonna want to be on the bench or they can wait for the 2010 free agent sweepstakes and try to get a excellent big man like Bosh|`|u5ZjG99Kaa	BULLS BABY DROSEEEEEEE=god. i dont follow them though. i live in chicago bulls for life yeeaaaa|`|6fT50f7uaa	Bulls havent been anything since jordan left.

FHjZuEhQaa	he has a good line    jamal Brown is going to the pro bowl    Carl Nicks is a starting Rookie    center sucks but he never runs up the middle anyway    Jari Evans is getting a lot of attention from other teams intrested in him    and Jon Stinchcombe is decent          N doubt he is a good thing to have  because it takes the other teams attention off of Brees.

If they can look past the house that Carroll bought his parents. If it's good for Pete Rose it should be good enough for Reggie Bush.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|3a0c551af182343c97509a84971a0d28aa	At this point in Young Mr. Bush's football career, I think its a bit too early to tell.  He really hasn't shown us much since coming to the NFL from USC, but that doesn't mean he doesn't have it in him.  I think as he matures, he could possibly be a great back, but he'd better start producing yardage really soon because the longevity of a RB in the NFL is fleeting. They get maybe 8 good years and then its down hill from there.  He needs to stop all that juking and dancing and just run. He tries too hard to be what he was at USC and the NFL is a very different game then college.  He's gotta learn how to hit the holes, run behind his blockers, wait for blocks...He hasn't learned that art yet.     GO CHARGERS 2009!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|kV53Roz1aa	Maybe when he learns to run north and south instead of east and west...    I think he's got the talent to be an HOFer... but he breaks to the outside to much looking for a homerun and in the NFL there's just too many defensive folks who have speed to catch him out there.  This isn't college ball anymore.|`|7sVg9NPxaa	No. He said the tickets cost too much.|`|fxqA5EMvaa	simply, no..never he never had a chance|`|XLXncQu9aa	Hall of fame?  That is a complete joke.  Reggie Bush isn't anywhere near MVP status, and I'm supposed to believe he would make the hall of fame?  Sorry the NFL is about what you are doing right now, not what you  did, or how much hype you can bring.  He had one great season and that was it.  Bush is a has been.  He was better during his times of college.  He has not lived up to the hype, and the way he continues to be injured he won't.  I think he should hang it up after a few more years.  Once your in, your in the NFL, but I'd rather retire early than be a laughing stock in the NFL.  He is not going to the NFL, and he won't as long as he continues to play like he has.|`|O2jH0yVFaa	If he has a magnus opus season and then starts to run like a gazelle in the African grasslands then yes. If he continues what he is doing but he wont but he'll probably get into the USC Athletics Hall of Fame.|`|RY5nmWlgaa	heII 2 da no.|`|AA11828439	Not without better stats|`|XaFYUMRSaa	College HOF maybe !

yjwQG6tXaa	The 49ers do not need another QB. Shaun Hill has proven that he is the QB for the rest of his contract. Also, Mark Sanchez is gonna be the 2nd or 3rd pick, and the 49ers have the 10th pick. The 49ers need to work a little on the OL, because they gave up way too many sacks last season, and should also focus on the pass defense.    If Kurt Warner were to retire, then I would say "yah" the 49ers have a legit chance to make the playoffs next season. Matt Leinart has shown us he is no condition to return to the field yet.    Even if Hasselbeck were healthy, the Seahawks would not have enough offensive talent to support him.

Legend won a Battle Royal, also involving Rene Dupree, Steve Corino and other wrestlers. Moore and Legend then faced off in the main event of WSW Inception, and Moore won the championship, becoming the inaugural champion. On November 22, 2008, Moore won the FCW Germany Heavyweight Championship after he defeated Mot Van Kunder; however, he lost it immediately afterwards to Rico Bushido, who used a title shot that he had. On December 13, 2008, Moore lost against the champion KC McKnight, in a MAPW Heavyweight Championship match.|`|17f313c0636520ec01d8f896d35ffb85aa	yes he has been released and no he dose not still wrestle

7t7XzXsVaa	In soccer maybe not in overall|`|DuS8wvaFaa	I AGREE|`|v9cORzzfaa	He hasn't exactly been chased by any good teams. I mean, from Galaxy to Munich?    When he gets an offer from a Premier League team.... he can be classified as good.    America's best player (even though he's a goal keeper) Tim Howard.    EDIT: Even Australia has AT LEAST 5 players that are better than your best player. If you don't believe me, youtube Tim Cahill, Harry Kewell, Mark Viduka, Lucas Neill and Josh Kennedy.    If you are still a stubborn American, Just remember, Australia made it out of the group stage World Cup 2006 with Japan, Croatia and Brazil in our group. Voted the hardest group in the competition, and we narrowly lost to Italy in the finals, the "champions" after losing to a 93rd minute penalty from an obvious dive.    The USA couldn't even make it out of a group with Ghana and Czech Republic. Yeah sure, you had Italy... but you should have beaten the other 2 without trying.|`|AA11264943	Yes, he is the best player the US has ever produced.  If you look back, he is better than Eric Wynalda, Tab Ramos, Claudio Reyna or Brian McBride ever were.      Other top players include Clint Dempsey, DaMarcus Beasley and Michael Bradley, Brad Friedel, Steve Cherundolo,  Carlos Bocanegra, Oguchi Onyewu and Tim Howard, but I would still take Donovan over them.    The future is pretty bright though, with the likes of young players like Freddy Adu, Jozy Altidore, Maurice Edu and Sacha Klejistan.    I think Sacha has the ability to overtake Donovan as our top player by 2010.    James|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	disagree...      KOBE|`|Nz8alTBXaa	Landon Donovan sux @s$ tim Howard sux @s$ evveryone else couldnt even be called soccer players so yes the US sux @s$ so thats why gaydon Donovan isnt the best soccer player in the US because... See you guys even call it soccer its called FOOTBALL only chicks play soccer so yes I just called you chicks! Mexico owning US 11/2/09 0-3 go play soccer chicks!|`|mf2TpQwDaa	Landon Donovan is probably the best   because he hase excielent ball control,speed, juke, and is a really awsome player|`|1fwo8HqMaa	definitely.    but I also think very highly of     dempsey  bocanegra  howard  cherundolo
chCcWbnBaa	HBK just because all the **** hes been through , and then taker beats HBK so every one wins .  and that nacho thing is bullshit i would have climbed over the rail and be like gimme my nachos and then get beat down by sissy *** security|`|UzEAVZ6Aaa	Dude! I would totally love it if a WWE Superstar stole my nachos.  But see that ain't gunna happen since I spent $40 bucks + service fees + parking just to get into the building.  Then of course there is the souvenir stand: t-shirts, posters, programs, a giant foam finger, arm bands and a Rey Mysterio mask, all of which had to be bought because I don't want to see Vince in the poor house.  By the time I got around to getting any food, all I could afford was the hot dog wrapper on the men's rest room floor.  But it was all worth just to see the Khali Kiss Cam!     Title Run:  HBK.  I never buy it when Take loses the belt.  Come on, he's the Deadman and I am supposed to buy that Edge out smarted him. Please.  At least with HBK an old injury could be called in as an excuse or a vintage McMahon screw job!|`|F3VjJAdiaa	funny, but that looked like a set up!     Undertaker, bring back Paul Bearer and the urn, have Kane help him along the way. And win the belt one last time.|`|h9PVRHPWaa	Well the good thing about a fat thief is their getaways are very slow.    Personally I prefer taker.|`|K52jiCEqaa	taker|`|9Us6XYg8aa	That was funny.

I would like both of them to run for a title competition!|`|haiqb4A6aa	you are an ***|`|2KIRdfIcaa	HBK. He hasn't won a world title since 2002 and it only lasted for a month.    Taker on the other hand won his fifth world title reign (I think) at last year's Wrestlemania.

I'll do the next 5 years...    - HBK  - Undertaker  - Jim Duggan  - HHH  - Finlay  - Big Show  - Kane  - Tommy Dreamer    I'm sure there are a few others; I just can't think of them all right now!|`|QJwaagGWaa	Finlay  Tommy Dreamer(sadly)  Possibly HHH  HBK  Undertaker  Rey Mysterio  .............

YRkjw7kDaa	what the ***...you tag him because its not a force play...on a grounder to 1st all you have to do is tag the base and usually 1b is cutoff for throws from rf to home|`|gVYfFSpRaa	Yes, yes, and yes.    1B can be a cutoff if the RF is throwing home, but it doesn't happen that often.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	1.Yes  2.Yes  3.NO|`|POriIGJtaa	because it ISN'T a forced play?  correct    him or the bag either one    yes|`|AA12374240	you have to tag him to get him out. as long as the first baseman is in possession of the ball, it doesn't matter what body part touches first base as long as he touches it before the runner.  first basemen can be cut off guys if the play is from right field. there's a famous play where derek jeter cut the ball off from right, flicked it to posada for the tag out. that should have been the first baseman but jeter's a savant where the game is concerned.|`|FPjIOlSAaa	yes and yes but not sure about last|`|P1bO87l1aa	If the runner is on first and you are trying to hold him on.  If the pitcher throws to first you have to tag him.  on a ground ball the first baseman does not have to tag the runner just the base.  If the runner is going to second he must be tagged unless he is forced to second by the batter.      It depends on the situation but the first baseman can be the cutoff man but not very often.
L77OlY1naa	Stop being greedy...J/k I think Gonzo or Edmounds would be GREAT fit|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	It would only help. Id do it he adds nice offence and thats what the sox need to compete with the yankees and rays|`|8jViRw5qaa	Dunn asks for a lot of money. We have Jason Bay and Kevin Youklis who play in the positions that he plays. But if they trade Big Papi then, they should pick him up and put him at DH.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Well, he would be a good bench player, if Lowell gets hurt, but it's not like it will make a big difference if the don't sign him...|`|4uSRVZNNaa	a great power bat to replace manny's?  that would help.  that would provide great insurance against lowell going down.  and you know that drew will go down with an injury at some point as well.  also great protection for papi in the batting order.   for those who are confused: youk moves to third and dunn plays first or plays OF if drew goes down.  yeah he strikes out a lot but he's almost a lock for 40+ hrs.  an alternative considering they lost out on signing tex.|`|V430UrvFaa	I would only trust Dunn at DH, first base and left field, they always need speed in center and right field, but Jason Bay is their left fielder and with David Ortiz and Youk at their positions, Dunn will not be on the Red Sox.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Since Dunn is a power hitting OF with no defense and Lowell is a light-hitting 3B with great defense, I fail to see what Dunn would bring to the Sox. And even if you shifted Dunn to the IF, it would be 1B, not 3B. And even though he's the world''s biggest Putz, Youkilis is a better answer there than Dunn ever could be.     Now, if you got Dunn to replace the aging, ailing, and very much failing Ortiz, that would be a different story entirely.|`|8skV9ze9aa	The only positions where Dunn wouldn't kill the team due to poor defense are 1B, DH, and LF. The Red Sox have a crowded OF as it is with 4 starter-quality players. They have Youk to play 1B, Lowell at 3B, and Ortiz at DH. Long term, there's prospect Lars Anderson to play 1B. There is literally no room for Dunn as a starter, and it would be ridiculous to bench him or any of the players at those positions. All the Red Sox need is a catcher and they'll be in business. See: Texas Rangers and their 3 potential future All-Star catchers.|`|FPjIOlSAaa	wouldnt make sense for team|`|7e779664f2fa69c81d06551c999ec10baa	If the Sox could get him for a 1 year deal at 8 million or less I would say yes.  He would be able to get at bats in the OF, 1B and DH.  This would help keep Papi and Lowell healthy over the long season and also be an excellent short term fill in if/when injuries occur. He would bring exactly what the Sox covet offensively;  Power and OBP.  He would be an excellent insurance policy.|`|frDcAqyWaa	if Dunn can sign fr short term and less that 10 mil its a good move.  Dunno what Papi will do, Dunno what Lowell will do, Don't want Lowerie to be the everyday 3b and Lugo to be the SS all the time.  Dunn Strikes out a lot but in that ball park I think its a nice fit... its that much shorter down the lines.  Its a long season you can never have too few players...     One more thing about that, its definitely going to be a seller's market for bats at the trade deadline and even next hot stove season.|`|AYiVipawaa	Dunn's good at hr, but his batting avr is too low. He would be good, but I don't know how much he costs. If Lowell does get hurt, a left fielder can't replace him. The Sox need Fielder, though for his power.

In my opinion...|`|T13xM9iJaa	Well I think that he was just saying that he had nothing to do with the accidents that was happening to jeff Hardy and it was true|`|rdRWT0yraa	i think he's kind of trying but not really that much because he's won pretty much all his singles titles as a heel and might be worried about the crowd's reaction to him as a face again after all he's done as a heel|`|63ce14dc7c788e16d783f90000ca7bc5aa	I think that he is because he was acting innocent as you said by saying that he was not the attacker of Jeff Hardy. Plus he looks like he is about to fight Big Show, a heel. If he goes face again, I think that wwe's ratings would increase by a lot! And smackdown fans will attend more shows and get more viewers because this man hasn't been a face like since when? 2004? That is a long time of being a heel. I think that it would be great to have the face Edge.|`|JRGttmejaa	yes i did see that     i hope he does turn face     hes funny face     plus if he does that could be a sign that cage is returning
3teWTOPqaa	Everyone have to pick up the slack if the Lakers want to keep their current pace, but yeah Kobe especially.|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	Lakers "fans" will become die-hard Clippers fans. at least their center Marcus Camby is healthy!! watch, Chris Kaman jerseys will sell out soon. lmfao.|`|kKbqdlbnaa	I'm sure Kobe will pick up his performance, there's no doubt about that, but the question is at whose expense? If Kobe is going out there and taking about 30 shots then that eats into the amount of shots that Ariza or Odom would take, which will affect their production.

k7hBT7MGaa	No, these don't really classify you according to the type of running someone should be doing.  Although they have an effect, the type of running someone should be doing is more determined by other physiological factors, such as types of muscle fiber (fast twitch vs. slow twitch).      These terms refer to the type of shoes runners with different pronation characteristics should wear.     Pronation is one of the ways the body deals with forces from the foot coming in contact with the ground.  It is a shock absorbing mechanism.  Typically, the foot reaches a point where most of the pressure between the ground and the foot is near the outside of the heel.  As the foot pushes, the foot rolls inside, and the point of pressure moves forward and inside.      Pronation in some runners is excessive.  The foot rolls too much. Usually, runners doing this have low arches or "flat feet."  The low arch absorbs shock very well.  However, pushing against the ground with the foot is what drives a runner forward.  So, this "overpronation" can be a hindrance to the  runner.    Other runners  have feet that don't pronate enough.  Usually, these runners with "underpronation" have high, rigid arches.  This type of arch is better at transmitting forces that drive a runner forward, but doesn't absorb shock well.    Someone with in-between pronation, or "normal pronation" is regarded as having the best combination of shock absorption and cushioning.    The terms used come from marketing the shoe types these runners need.    An overpronator should run in stiff shoes.  These limit pronation, helping the runner to push against the running surface more effectively.  These are called "motion control" shoes.      An underpronator should run in shoes with more cushioning.  These are called "cushioning" shoes.  Some shoe stores market these as "neutral" shoes. [1, for one.]  I don't know why these are called "neutral" shoes.     A normal pronator, or runner who neither overpronates nor underpronates should run in shoes that have a combination of stiffness and cushioning.  These are marketed as "stability" shoes.     Nature, being what it is, many runners will find they do not fall neatly into one of the three categories. Often, they will fall in between two of them. Some runners might be extreme underpronators or extreme overpronators.     Although I earlier said that arch type doesn't classify someone as a short or long distance runner, Dr. Tim Noakes says that the high arched foot is the ideal type for a sprinter. [2]|`|AA11425571	Stability or neutral refers to your arch which is useful in buying a running shoe. If you go to a running specialty store they can determine your foot type and pick a good shoe for you. Here you can find a local store:  http://www.runnersworld.com/store/search...

Xkm4PstOaa	I think it would be cool!  In my opinion, though, I believe that Trish Stratus was always overrated...she did, however, improve immensly and at the end of her career she's rightfully one of the cleanest, toughest female wrestlers ever in the WWE.    I, however, don't agree with your opinion on Michelle Mccool.  It's just another case of the WWE shoving, yet another, blonde bombshell down out throats!  It was first Sable, then, yes I'm going to say it, Trish Stratus!  Now it seems to be Michelle's turn.  You don't like her now, but give her some time and you will be loving her in the future!    So to answer your question: Yes I would like a match with Trish as Wrestlemania.  Maybe Trish v. Beth v. Nattie.    Edit:  Thanks for responding.  I completely understand and respect your point.  Hopefully Mccool starts getting some competition; because this Maria/Eve crap ain't cutting it!

eDCyle05aa	Jumping rope would increase both endurance and speed. You should also run at least 3 times per week. Drink a lot of milk because it has a lot of protein and calcium. Also drink a lot of water to keep hydrated. Eat a lot of fruit and vegetables and as much protein as you want.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	If your goal is to improve your running performance, then the center of your workout routine should be running. However, anything that keeps your heart rate up for at least 20 minutes is a cardio workout, to some degree, and can help your running performance because it will improve cardio-pulmonary efficiency.    I recommend eating some carbohydrates after any workout to replenish the glycogen in your muscles; that way you have energy for the next workout. "Good" carbs are whole-grains such as oats and brown rice. Protein is also critically important to maintaining your tissues and helping them regenerate after exercise. A quality whey protein shake is a good supplement to most diets, especially for athletes.

v0MlomPoaa	The series is played over six days, featuring six games per team (two versus each opponent). The tournament's winner is the team with the most wins after all of the games are played.     If two teams are tied for the best record after the 6-game round-robin, they play one game for the championship.    The last time this happened was in 2003, when Dominican team defeated the Puerto Rican team, after both finished with 5-1 records.    Not sure what happens if three teams go 4-2 or if all four go 3-3.  It has never happened before.|`|gfGtx1m6aa	the one who got the better record after 6 games if theres a tie between 2 ball clubs they play a tie breaker.|`|L6MDegYpaa	licey all the way
XBHQcxDcaa	okay....let me tell you here that for the 600.00 dollar price tag on this thing you can get a much higher quality bike.    The thing that makes this so expensive is because it has a 3 speed internal hub and its "stylish."    The Cons:   It's made of Hi-Tin Steel, which is the lowest grade steel there is and it's is really weak so they have to use alot of it to make it strong...which makes the bike heavier. Being Steel it is also prone to rust.    Also, it only has a one peice crank. Which any one who knows bikes will tell you is crap. You want to get a 3 piece crank because they are stronger and give you less problems. Generally the bottom bracket on 3 peice cranks contain sealed bearings which means you get a better ride and longer lasting crank.       Those are the most obvious ones. The other ones prob. won't matter to you.     May I recommend a bike that gives you far more for the same price?    Check out: http://www.giant-bicycles.com/en-US/bike...    This is a Suede GX and one of the most comfortable cruisers on the market because of the foot forward pedaling technology.     The things this bike has that your choice does not:    - Aluminium frame - lighter and won't rust.  -Suspention - Front fork - and - seat post - to make your ride even more comfortable  -Three piece crank  -A hand brake AND a coaster brake  -An adjustable stem    Things the GIANT has that your choices also have:  -Rear racks  -Fenders  -3 speed internal hub      The photo doesn't do this bike justice you have to see it in person, it has beautiful pearly pinstriping.    So there is more to look at when buying a bike than what is pleasing to the eye.    Do yourself a favor and look around a little bit and don't buy a bike when you could get a MUCH better bike at the same or lower price.     Happy Riding!|`|RamplKUPaa	go for the Blanc et Noir!  it looks sick that is comming from a fellow surfer    =]

I'm not sure your coach would allow it, at least not without some supporting information (which a Google search will quickly turn up). But you could easily start practicing barefoot on trails or the beach (if you live near one.) Why should you need specialized equipment for something your body was designed to do?! Yes, it's going to hurt at first. That's because the muscles in your feet are atrophied from years of wearing shoes, which force you to walk in an unnatural way. Yes, your skin has to build up a bit of toughness before it's comfortable. Once I got used to it, however, I never went back.

oWYs6Btgaa	First of all to the smart alec who thinks this forum is about critiquing other people's posts- spend more time reading the question and answering it and less time taking inventory of other people's mistakes.    To answer your question old man,    1. There were several key plays that kept drives alive due to the unfortunate penalties that were called on Arizona. The interception at the end of the 1st half was a back-breaker on a play that should have never been called. I don't care if it's Pop Warner, HS, College or the NFL- you never, ever call a slant play over the middle on 2 down, inside the 5 yard line with 19 seconds to go in the half, let alone against the Steelers' top ranked defensive unit. That was gift wrapped from the time it left Warner's fingertips.   The touchdown that Warner threw to Fitzgerald with 2:39 on the clock. That quick strike allowed too much time for the Pittsburgh offense.  2. The timely errors made by the Arizona Cards on both sides of the ball. Four major personal fouls are unacceptable.  3. The pass play called at the end of the first half by the Cards and the decision not to call a defensive time out by the Cards with under 2 minutes left to get them to thwart the Steelers drive and end the game.  4. I would have called a time out as the Defensive Coordinator to rally my guys to stop Pittsburgh's last drive  5. As a player- not make so many mental mistakes, taking stupid penalties that shifted momentum away my team.|`|UztfjBOFaa	1. Santonio Holmes catch to bring the Steelers up 27 to 23  2. Cardinals interception throw goaline to goaline for the touchdown in the last seconds of the half.  3. The 'fumble' with 5 sec. to go.  4. I would hav to told Kurt Warner should throw it to Larry Fitzgerald.  5. I would hav taken over the situation|`|KhBmlaefaa	1. Santonio Holmes endzone catch.  2. None  3. None  4. Nothing  5. Nothing|`|7RziqsDcaa	1. a) 100-yard interception for a TD.  b) Larry Fitzgerald touchdown.  c) Santonio Holmes last-minute touchdown.    2. Penalties, playing it safe (on the Steelers part).    3. I don't criticize professionals.    4. Take a bigger risk. Trust my players.    5. Take a bigger risk. Trust my coach.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Top plays of the game - OLB James Harrison's 100 yard INT return for touchdown, Santonio Holmes 6 yard TD catch in the northeast part of the endzone late in the game, and the holding call in the end zone that resulted in a safety, that negated the first down Pittsburgh attained on the play.    Significant errors - The interception Warner threw prior to halftime. That's an instant 14-point swing.     Questionable calls - The personal foul called on Dansby for the "hit" on Ben and Fitzgerald's first TD catch (nose of the ball hit the ground)    Something you may have done differently as a coach - If I was Arizona's coach, play more aggressively. If I was Pitt's coach, focus on working the clock more instead of trying to have Ben dance around and make a throw that just wasn't there    Something you may have done differently as a player - Absolutely nothing, make choices and don't look back.|`|Oes7TRNVaa	Ur not going to get anywhere cheating.

Didn't review the last play of the game, did not call the excessive celebration penalty on Holmes, really bad roughing the passer call on Dansby in the 1st half.     4) No.  I think the game was well-coached all-around.     5) Hard to say. Nothing stands out.|`|RY5nmWlgaa	Top plays of the game: James Harrison's 100 yard Interception return, Larry Fitzgerald's 65 yard touchdown catch, Sanonio Holmes' game winning TD catch    Significant Errors: Kurt Warner's Interception thrown to James Harrison which resulted in a Pittsburgh Touchdown, the number of penalties comitted by both teams.    Officiating calls: The last Cardinals play of the game, where Kurt Warner threw an incomplete pass that was ruled as a fumble that clinched the game for the Steelers.    Something differently I would have done as a coach: kept blitzing Roethlisberger on the last drive; it had been working, but they backed off.    Something differently I would have done as a player: If I were Rodgers-Cromartie, I would have kept my eye on the ball and intercepted Ben Roethlisberger's pass in the first quarter instead of dropping it.|`|7czpjXQSaa	Every body who anybody, knows that the Cards throws the ball to Fitz and Anquon early ans often, ain't nobody on steelers got a chance.|`|DvKpx0Reaa	"...old man?"  what "old man" has a school essay about the SUPERBOWL?

mRJk26MTaa	Make sure they are still round and not damaged. If they are damaged or have debris on them, you will scratch the internals of the air gun, and they will not shoot straight.    An idea is to have a sort of BB catcher. Have a sheet or blanket hanging up somewhere, and make it so when you shoot at it, the BB's roll down the sheet and go to some kind of container like a bucket or box. Then just get the BB's out of the container, clean them, and shoot them again.|`|AA10816337	Yes, as long as there isn't any mud or other stuff on the bb.

PoVvFeodaa	They usually group runners into heats according to there seed times. If your seed time is faster than most people than you'll probably be in the first couple of heats. Also, whoever is the fastest in each heat usually gets the middle lane. For example, if you're the fastest runner in your heat  and there are 8 runners, you'll probably be in the 4th or 5th lane. This makes it so that statistically, the heat should finish the race in a flying-v shape.|`|Lol0iLfgaa	Basically, who has the fastest time coming into a race.

LGVrhTFTaa	Upton has the most value of the remaining 5 due to his 2b eligibility.  I've seen him ranked consistently in the top 13-18 overall ballplayers,,,  and I check alot of websites' rankings.Holliday ranks anywhere from 11  to 34 (Not even experts are sure how he will do in that hitters' graveyard in Oakland!)..Markakis is ranked from 36 to 58.Kemp 38 to 140.Soto is in the 70 to 90 range,and Youk 49 to 68...And personally I think Upton has the most upside of the group.And I like the addition of Burrell,and a maturing E.Longoria batting behind him the EnTiRe season; it's a no brainer for me.    ~g0()d LuCk!~|`|gUMucKOkaa	Pronk, Upton did not play 2B at all in 2008 so I would not think that he would be 2B eligible.

If you considered Youkilis' power, you'd realize you've filled your 1B and 3B slots with Pujols and Wright, lightening your need for Youkilis in your lineup, and as one of your 3 keepers at that. Holliday will rejuvenate that Oakland lineup, I don't see his production dropping because of the move, he's a top OF, and one you need in your lineup. He's similar to Wright in production, as a multi-tool player. Upton would be my only consideration if you decide not to keep Holliday, as he can play your fantasy 2B or OF slot, and brings a lot of speed in a stronger Tampa Bay lineup.

I would recommedn taking 2 different weight gain shakes (protein shakes) with differnet concentrations of essential amino acids.      Aside from that, all you can do is hope you're genetics are right, and your body is capable of gaining 20 pounds of muscle ina  year.  Most peopole can't gain more than 10-15 of pure muscle in a year without steroids.|`|4jbFXoYfaa	i think u should try whey i think that is the brand the strawberry one is really good.

xKjecOTYaa	I can't give you an honest opinion just by your height and weight. Linebackers are getting hit EVERY play (pulling guard, fullback). I would have to see how aggressive you are. Are you a hitter, or do you wait to get hit? Lots of people think they can play real football just because they are fast, or catch the ball good. When you put on the pads and start hitting, lots of people quit within the first two or three days. Getting drilled in the chest, or knocked off of your feet doesn't sound to bad, until it happens to you, and it WILL happen, trust me!!     You can do, or be whatever you want to do, but you have to have the determination and have LOTS of heart. When your buddies are playing video games, you should be working out or running.     Oh yeah... one more thing. I'll tell you just like my coaches used to tell me. "Pain does not exist, it's all in your mind".|`|kxMDFPnbaa	right now if i were a coach i would probably put you on the D-line...you have great height to knock passes down over the middle and if your on the end you can speed around the outside lineman for an easy sack|`|7sVg9NPxaa	You have the size and weight. You say you have good speed. You could be a good linebacker.    At your age I'd checked with your family doctor about the weights. You don't want screw up your growth plates and in a few years not be able to play anything.|`|xP08melDaa	Well, you have the size, and the weight just gotta start practicing and you can be pretty successful...  maybe get a bit faster and run and you'll be gud

IoVfE1Hbaa	Santonio Holmes does the right things at the right time. When we want the Steelers to get a touchdown, he answers our pleads. What I like most about him is that he is able to do it in different ways every time! I watch him, and he's got something new up his sleeve. Holmes does great in the Playoffs, and when Pittsburgh needs a win, he goes all out. He deserves the MVP.|`|xP08melDaa	He's descent... but hes really fast and hes got his punt/kick-recieving moves which make him very versatile cuz he can go deep and burn you or tghey can throw screens to him and he will take them for a big gain.  Overall on an 100 point scale i give him a 91/100|`|QtjnmEzoaa	He reminds me very much of Lynn Swann. He ranges from irrelevant to fairly good during the regular season, but is fantastic bordering on irreplacable in the playoffs. 1 touchdown in each of their post season games this year? Yeah, I'd call that good.|`|60534ad637bb9eeb3a3f4a6859dbba83aa	He's just a decent receiver with astonishing speed|`|mUG8XtNpaa	He was good last night. That is all that matters.|`|RY5nmWlgaa	No. He sucks. He was the Super Bowl MVP, for cryin' out loud!|`|7czpjXQSaa	He just be lucky he be wearing Antwan Randel El's old jersey, pants and shoes.|`|UefCjbvOaa	Hes two in one. One of the best KR and PR and one of the best WR. Hes the MVP of the game for a reason: HE HAS MAD LEGS AND HANDS. thats all i can say. everytime i watch a steeler game he does something different. A TD kick return or a 40 yard catch. Hes one of a kind.
01b9743a0b503849c2b30b5f6efcca49aa	it's gonna take a while for brand to back back into shape. if you need to win now go for it, if not you can wait it out...brook lopez is a having a great season|`|dKh3vqq9aa	yes|`|UjPKMEzTaa	hell yea..........Brook Lopez is a beast

I wear a pair of Vera Wang tights [regular ones] then Vera Wang leggings over them. They are really long and quite thick. I love them! They are really durable.  Vera Wang is your best bet because her clothes are warm and good quality. Also, the leggings are the only ones that I have found go over the top of my boots.    Hope this helps ! ^-^
0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	look at the Steelers fans, its hilarious.  All they can say is "get over it", "quit crying", "let it go", maybe "your a sore loser".  I mean MILLIONS of people across the world have watched them get 2 championships handed to them.  Their image took a huge hit last night.  When your on the world stage an you win in that fashion, your credibility as a true champion is really diminished.  If im wrong then why does Yahoo have it on their front page an why is it being discussed on every sports station on tv?  Ill definetly be telling my nephew about this when he is old enough to understand and im sure millions of other dads will tell their sons about this too.  Besides, this is the age of the internet, they can just look up what happened online an there you go!  Ill even go as far as saying Pittsburgh is the better team!  They just didnt WIN that game last night though. Not a chance.  It was handed to them. One example?  Here you go..............at 18 seconds, look at  56 and watch that block in the back, top of your screen.  Wasnt called as you know.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcSvDCGAd...|`|tOIhNyCJaa	&fmt=18|`|7czpjXQSaa	Did you see the game  did you see the game  I'm aksin you a question  did you see the game.

Boo Hoo!!!|`|jlk4HF6Xaa	nope|`|vFasAFBUaa	could've but they didn't|`|kxMDFPnbaa	i think they would of been the favorite going in to the super bowl if they had some more defence... they came back form the biggest deficet in superbowl history only to watch thier defence let the steelers score in the finals minute of the game.|`|Lg6nA574aa	I say that the Steelers had the luckiest win in history! Ys i agree to u but Steelers had still won though.|`|zf71VGW2aa	most experts agree it was a fumble..but i guess u all know more than men who have studied the game for years? get over it already!|`|KhBmlaefaa	First of all it wasn't a pass. So let's get that straight. It was reviewed upstairs and they concluded it was not sufficient doubt to send it down to the field review. And I agree, however to make you people happy I would have wished they had anyways.    And no I don't think they would have pulled it off. They got beat the whole game. They made a run but it wasn't enough. The better team won.|`|xP08melDaa	THATS A GOOD QUESTION... I don't think Holmes should've been called for the flag, but I do think that Warner's "fumble" should have been an incomplete pass.  Then they coul've thrown up the HAIL MARY and maybe-who knows.... Fitzgerald could've come up with it.... (He's such a beast!!!)|`|RY5nmWlgaa	They're the Arizona Cardinals: the team that can grasp defeat from the jaws of victory. If they had been up 50 with 1 minute left in the 4th quarter, they'd find a way to lose.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Probably not. On the play where the fumble occured, none of the Steelers DB's were actually playing for a hail mary pass, most of them expected a 25-30 yard completion in the middle of the field + a timeout. With basically 9 Steelers in the end zone had the call been ruled incomplete, and about 26 hands diving for the ball, anything could happen but I doubt it would've been caught cleanly by anybody.|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	i thought they were gonna make it
sPiwb8Hraa	I'm a Steelers fan and I saw no problem with it.|`|kxMDFPnbaa	there was no problem it was just greedy steeler fans.it was a wonderful catch by Fitzgerald..|`|zf71VGW2aa	im a steeler fan and it wasd a td.
mUG8XtNpaa	People seem to think Holmes was making fun of Lebron James when in actuality, he was in a way saluting him - they're both natives to Ohio (Lebron in Cleveland, Santonio in Ohio State).    But in general, refs are party-poopers.|`|WTQtchbvaa	A few years ago, I actually watched the bengals to see Chad Johnson celebrate after a TD. Celebrations after the TD are fun and entertaining, 2 major reasons why people watch football in the first place. The NFL could have made a lot of money of of celebrations, just like LeBron is doing with his ritual.     The reason they are becoming a concern is because kids started dancing after TD's in Pee Wee football. Parents started complaining to the league and players began being called for unsportsmanlike conduct and fined.|`|FcRsyDf4aa	some players have been throwing up gang symbols, and the NFL does not want that to be a part of its good image|`|J3kfQtViaa	Celebrating anything in any sports game is not sportsmanlike.  And people do not watch football to see that kind of stuff.  I want to see players who set examples on and off the field.|`|OFi3jBSHaa	Because most "celebrations" aren't celebrations. They're attempts to be the center of attention.    They're boring.|`|xP08melDaa	LMAO the officials are crazy nowadays... Let the guyz have some fun they deserve it, but sometimes you gotta throw a flag when it gets outta hand (like when Randy Moss started pulling down his pants to the crowd after catching a touchdown)-He was playing on the Vikings at that time...|`|QtjnmEzoaa	They're getting really picky about excessive celebration which I think is an atrocious rule. When you get the potential game winning touchdown in a Superbowl, you should be able to celebrate as much as your little heart desires.    I can't believe he did the LeBron though... that should be trademarked.|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	i have been wondering that to|`|fxxLgQrdaa	aw man they cant its not hurting any1|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Years ago they were allowed to celebrate touchdowns. But there were problems. Delaying of the game was one of them, disrespecting the other team and fans was another, and the inability sometimes to get people back out there to kick the extra point without chaos was another. Those are just three reasons. The complaints are that people do not want to see this practise happen again so they want players penalized.|`|7czpjXQSaa	They afraid some brotha gonna be doin somthin NASTY and offend a buncha white women in Kansas

Even though im a Giants fan, im not just saying it was the best because im a fan, i was glued to my seat the whole game and it was a hard hitting defensive game and that's whats football is all about and i dont care what anyone else says.|`|60534ad637bb9eeb3a3f4a6859dbba83aa	Haha this was a horrible Super Bowl  All those penalty flags really detracted from the experience.

NEtVRjplaa	Id like to think that a Basketball coach shares many aspects and characteristics with other team coaches. For example, it is important for all coaches to have a strategy or protocol that will enable a team to win games. Secondly, a coach that knows discipline and fairness is a must have. And finally, a coach needs to have basketball, football, baseball etc. I.Q. They need to know how to play the game and how the game works inside out.    A basketball coach also has individual duties from any other sport. They need to know who to put on the court, who is best at guarding opponents, opponents weaknesses, their own team weaknesses and how to correct them if possible. They need to recognize problems and work to fix them. If the problem is not fixable, they have to create problems for the opposing team or make changes to the roster.    A player who has intensity, positive attitude, good work ethic, and skills but lacks b-ball knowledge and I.Q is a good investment. A coach would have almost no reason to help develop such a player. I wouldnt say that a player with potential should be worked with only in the preseason.. But it would be wise to let him/her play in regular season games so they can get first hand experience (b-ball I.Q. can be developed much more effectively this way) and teach them throughout the year. Since basketball is a fast-paced game, it allows undeveloped players to learn quickly.     Hope this helped.

The Cardinals really tried hard and I hoped they win, but I happy for the Steelers too. They did a great job.|`|uOVsCWdNaa	It was awesome! I knew at the beginning of the season that the Steelers would make it to the Super Bowl and win! I was on my feet for a lot of the game- extremely exciting!|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	It was a very good game, although it's hard to say it was the best ever. It certainly had drama!
m7BFxtBkaa	It was probably all paid for by the tickets bought by the fans bro|`|vjgsbhP3aa	cost who?
chCcWbnBaa	apparently there were refs on internship on the Field that day , and also the review booth needs to be fired its a critical call they said **** it on plain and simple threes no other way to explain it , i dont care who says what they didn't review that damn fumble if they did they play that transpired after the fact wouldn't have been . simply because you cant ******* run a play during a damn review, Yes there was questionable calls during the game but i believe the cardinals got the most of them. if you look at the average penalty yards the cards received during the whole course of the season and compare it to the bowl you see that the penalty yards were more than doubled .  so all in all there is already an uproar about the game , and a defensive player of the year doesnt do that to another player he doesnt deserve it and the Steelers Can go **** themselves|`|tMrIScCTaa	i think it was rigged.  Thats why I always play the spread.  i win everytime.|`|m7BFxtBkaa	Two words: James Harrison|`|OWfU0OdLaa	I like to watch two football teams play in the SB. Not refs vs the other team. For the second time, the refs won the SB for the steelers|`|jSBtdhf0aa	no i like to see a few scraps.|`|gjteVB2Daa	I think Harris acted the fool and was very unsportsman like when he beat up on the opponents.  I also do not appreciate the players "showing off" when they make a play.  After all that is what they are being paid millions to do.  No. 10 was forever beating on his chest like a real clown whenever he saw the cameras on him.  What a  jerk in my estimation.  He ruined his team's image for me.    Also, I thought it was great to honor the crew of the plane that landed in the water and saved all passengers and crew aboard.  The songs were wonderful, too.l|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	As so often happens in big games where emotions run high, some players on both teams got a little chippy, which led to some personal fouls. Once that happens, the refs get a little overzealous, which leads to questionable calls, such as the roughing the passer call on the Cardinals and the unnecessary roughness call on Ike Taylor along the Cardinals sideline. Neither one would have been called during the regular season. Overall though, I think both teams demonstrated good sportsmanship.|`|M2QklN0Iaa	i didn't like when big ben threw the game winning td, i was going for cardinals|`|UQLNP6iyaa	Harrison should have been in the locker room early for beating that guy down. That was just foul behavior and I hope the NFL fines him for it.    Other than that, I wasn't impressed by the half time pensioner's crotch-first slide into the cameraman. If I wanted to see a close-up of nuts well past their sell-by date, I'd go to the dollar store.
a6EndAPiaa	You have 4 downs to gain 10 yards.  If you fail to gain 10 yards after 4 plays the ball goes to the other team.  So if after 3 plays you have not gained 10 yards you have an option:  1) try to gain the last x yards  2) Punt the ball to the other team  3) attempt a field goal    If you do not gain the yards the ball goes to the other team wherever you are on the field  If you punt the ball you *usually* force the other team about 40 yards further away.  If you miss the field goal the other team gets the ball at the spot of the kick.    Does that help?  If not add more questions and I will *try* to clarify.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	You have 4 downs (plays) to acquire 10 yards. If you do, you get a new set of downs.    You don't have to punt the ball. However, if you run a regular play on 4th down and do not get to the yard you need to, then you will turn the ball over at the spot the ball was down. Therefore, it is a much smarter play to punt the ball and make the other team gain possession much further back.
0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	here let me add to this haha.  We shall be told "get over it", "quit crying", "let it go" "your a sore loser" though.  Isnt it funny how if any other team woudl do this, it would be all over the place an people would be in here hating?  its the Steelers though an there isnt a word an your called a "crier" if you bring it up.  The same people that hate Barry Bonds an say he ISNT the home run king love the Steelers.  Yea that makes alottttttttttt of sense to me.     http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/83228...|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	I trust the steelers on this game. They didn't cheat.  Im not saying they never did because im sure  every single nfl team has cheated at least one time.    But this game. I trust Roethlisberger.    No they didn't cheat|`|aaKYVMk2aa	BE SMARTER AT :     www.idontwanttobeanidiot.com|`|0VBdup3Caa	Yeah i wouldnt doubt it yesturday made it real clear...|`|bCmqScVlaa	Oh yes, back in the 70's the only NFL team that ever used steroids was a Steeler.  No one else in the NFL back in the 70's ever used them.  They were all clean.  Is that right?    No one cheated.  They play the game.  They abide by whatever calls the refs make.  The biggest score at the end of the game wins.  Really quite simple.  They are not magicians, just good football players.  You have to admit that they made some really good plays yesterday.  No one could watch that game and say anything else unless they were dellusional.|`|IGbEZZlraa	I guarentee that every team has players on steroids! That is just a fact of life in professional sports.  So if you are going to accuse the Steelers of cheating because of that, then you have to accuse every other team in the league as well. The only difference it that they didn't get caught.  You also have to keep in mind the fact that steroids were legal in the 70s. Therefore there was no cheating.     In the case of the Cards and the Seahawks, in any case where a high profile team plays the underdog in a big game such as the super bowl people accuse the better team of cheating when they win. But yet if the team that got there just by pure luck wins, there could not of possibly been cheating involved.     Steelers won because they worked hard and are a great team. Not saying that the Cards or Seahawks didn't work hard, its just that in the end, they couldn't defeat the Great Pittsburgh Steelers!|`|s9Pwnb87aa	They must have because you said so. You are somethin. Not sure what, but I gotta feeling you are a jealous Cowboy fan. Yep the Steelers got six, Cowboys only got five now Pittsburgh is "America's Team". This question makes you really look bad.|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	look they won fair and square ok|`|c10ef01b69aef7e9d5c69d840692c1d8aa	well all you steelers fan should be happy. i would to if i paid taxes that went toward the refs makn those amazing calls. arizona is the winner no doubt about that. but besides the fact that a team cheated and only won by 4 points is even way more pathetic. and last but not least nobody cares about them havn 6 super bowl wins cause half dont even count.  no1 will ever forget cowboys and 49ers because they were the best teams ever, u think that rothesbitch will ever be compared to steve young or joe montana or holmes be compard to jerry rice. steelers are bullshit fitzgerald and warner can beat em on there own. *** u steeler fans|`|M9emH8aTaa	Yes, the fact that they used steroids in the 70s made them cheaters. Just because it may have been deemed legal still didn't make it right, period.  Sixburgh? Yeah.... right. You can put an asterisk next to at least 4 of those trophies, maybe even the fifth one with the way there were so many penalties against Seattle in that game.|`|jSBtdhf0aa	sounds like the republicans complaining and crying about obama winning,, well the best team won get over it. obama did win with a bigger spread though, the same appliws obama was better.|`|812c201aa2d8bada53eda66d1dab2600aa	Read the articles closely...|`|uOVsCWdNaa	Blah blah blah get over it! The best team won. It is over. Whine about it when they win again next year.
UQLNP6iyaa	They were the USAF Thunderbirds and the jets were F16's. You could tell because the F16 has only one engine. The Blue Angels fly F18's with two engines, it definitely was not them.|`|a6EndAPiaa	I just went back and looked it was single engine jets.  That rules out: F-15's, F14's, and F/A 18's.    I think that only leaves F-16's.      --- Edit oops Paul beat me too it!  LOL|`|f7qVtYfaaa	i think they were the new york jets with lord favre in command . but then again i could be wrong.|`|I5x1Tupfaa	I'm pretty sure they were the Blue Angels, from the Navy.|`|AA10776364	Not sure, but it looked like the Blue Angels.  It was F-18s regardless.|`|Wkjt373paa	They were The Thunderbirds!!|`|KZsdVGJzaa	i believe they were f16's|`|VbLQ0tdkaa	ur a *****
c767faeb6ae25829f84d589c038c29b0aa	Sounds like you're a feminist. Football was made for men. And is still geared towards men. Don't worry, things are changing & one day the sport will be banned or changed so much nobody will recognize it. And i'm sure you are looking forward to that day. I disagree with the feminist view of America. Women are not victims of society in my humble opinion. Especially not in todays world. If you don't like the Super Bowl don't watch it. Nobodies busting your chops about Soap Operas & how they affect society & push the values of useless gossip & underhanded attacks on others. Football is out there up front & in your face. Just remember men have always usually fought others by a fair duel or one on one fight. Women fight people behind their back & with deception. So like i said how do you think that affects society & gender relations?|`|e5D9UvnMaa	Yes I make it.  Watch the ALL NFL games live on your Pc with

dGBVHli7aa	Quaresma is a player scarce.  Watch all the performance which he did with FC Inter Milan in the first part of the Italian Championship!|`|jiFHJ6daaa	chelsea should go for a striker|`|duJgBxUoaa	haha..NO :)|`|GuXKPVgjaa	No. Joe is a FAR better player.  Quaresma is the biggest diver in the game!    He is very bad for the Premiership! He ruins games.|`|C6d5yElWaa	No - he reminds me a bit of Robbie Keane. Only performs well with a smaller club. Keane flopped horribly at Inter and Liverpool just as Quaresma has done at Barcelona and Inter.    I highly doubt he'll do anything at Chelsea but if he's going to succeed at any big club then it's at Chelsea where there's no competition for wingers|`|huto12P3aa	He'll be the new malouda....completely pointless player|`|583630813856412488308836bad3d46caa	To tell u the truth some players make it and become amazing players in Italy and are Garbage in England (Shevchenko, Crespo, ect), And a player who does good in the EPL might not make it in Italy!    So since they are such different kind of leagues, Quaresma might play good in the EPL even if he was not good at Inter Milan! He is almost like Ronaldo so u never know right!     Even if he is somewhat a 'youtube' player some "Youtube"players are really good, at least entertain us which is why watch football right!|`|PsCS0GK3aa	he will fit right in at chelsea... completely useless.|`|ISCUKFNlaa	dont rate him, have you seen him at inter this season|`|Hiasgb75aa	He might have the natural talent, but he doesn't have the technique or genius that Zola possessed.     At least he is better than Kalou anyway.|`|ojHN65J0aa	Scolari felt it necessary to leave him out of his Portugal World Cup squad but in a time of need he ten decides to call on him.     What does that tell you?    I haven't seen much of him and as of now I know little about the player. But, I think Scolari's strength is his man management. Look what he did with Anelka.     Ricardo has been under Scolari before and if he comes to Chelsea with any desire at all, im sure he will flourish. He provides the talent that the team lacks, the talent to play the style of football Scolari wants.     Lets just wait and see.|`|Ctfd1TNOaa	hi i'm italian  i want to know what English think about Quaresma at Chelsea  according to me he isn't a good player now|`|F6NrHeQ7aa	Well obviously, Chelsea getting a class player on loan cannot be bad in an way. He has disappointed many when he was at Barca and Inter.     He hasn't been much good at Inter so that may be the reason why Jose Mourinho left him out of his CL squad. In short, he has been a flop. However, he was going no where in the Serie A so the EPL is a good challenge for him. I am interested in what he can do. He seems to be a bit week and showboats a little much than he should but he is a quality player.     Seeing that he was coached by Scolari in the Euro may be good though. He may be able to bring the best out of him. He is surely better than Kalou and Malouda s you said.    After going down to Liverpool, Chelsea does need to mix things up a bit to get back into the race.    Things are pretty bad at the Bridge though. Cech is much worse than he was, Drogba has no form, Anelka is just not top class, Essien is out for some time...etc.    I hope Quaresma and Chelsea the best as he can become a crucial player for them.

l0iCqzlQaa	agree LETS GO.|`|0VBdup3Caa	LMAO! no its not Tom Bardy fault its the patriots fault because when bardy went down the whole team thought its over. and by the time they realized matt was the real deal it was too late. and tom brady is way over rated !!!!!! give rex grossman the pats o-line and he will be just a good.|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	YES, the pats are going ALL THE WAY BABY next year. The steelers are also enjoying the refs d**k because after all, the refs did them a BIG favor **** the steelers, NEW ENGLAND ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    To the guy below me, im mad that the cards didnt win because they deserve it. Im not saying the steelers are not a good team, im saying that I hate the fans, they can be just as arrogant as boston fans. I just think the cards deserve it more and my emotions spill out, its what fans do!|`|chCcWbnBaa	Considering that your offensive coordinator is Now the broncos head coach im not sure but i used to hate the patriots until last nights superbowl i hope Any team wipes their *** with the terrible Towel and show them how to win a game without refs|`|x97ktCqwaa	LOL  Tom Brady...LOL  Whatever!|`|nATkIg5zaa	Umm new england wasnt in the superbowl explain that?  your patriots will be terrible next yeaaaaar. yeahh steelers!!!!!!!! number 1 D next year too. stop being so jealous i mean i know the 'lers are awesome but come on there|`|RoUFSloWaa	Im not afraid and the Steelers are not afraid of a one-legged quartarback    Plus we finished the job and we just doubled your superbowl total|`|ro5xcSt8aa	ITs not like youre playing in the game  get a life a stop hate'in|`|168376eac06601810588385007074bfcaa	Just didn't know if you noticed your spelling error:  Are the Steelers enjoying "there" Super Bowl win now?      It should be "their" in this case and not "there".     Was proud to see you used the "other"  - they're -  correctly !!!  Good work.  Hope your team wins!  I don't care about sports at all, but hope your team wins.  Good luck !|`|bjR2uWAWaa	I do believe the Steelers whipped up on the Pats this year in the regular season!  6 rings, 6 rings, oh yeah, 6 rings. How many do the Pats have???|`|zFpHpqiLaa	ah i see another ungrateful pats fan cant handle dat u were **** dis season and miami finished above u oh damn wot a shame we ruled the nfl dis season and we will rule it every other season u just can't handle defeat|`|7nC7nvFsaa	You're absolutely right! Let's look at the facts. Two of the Patriots' championship seasons happened after New England beat Pittsburgh in the playoffs. In both of Pittsburghs' recent superbowl runs, they didn't have to deal with the Patriots. That is an enormously important fact that should not be forgotten. The only reason the Steelers were able to go all the way is because the Most Valueable Player in the NFL was out with injury! That would be like if the Chicago Bulls lost Michael Jordan for the season in the '90's. Whoever wins the NBA title would be completely irrelevant. You would have to put an asterisk next to their championship which is what should happen to the Steelers. This year proved how weak the NFL is. When Brady comes back, New England will add another Lombardi trophy to the case!|`|XctMTPisaa	Any knowledgeable football guy knows Brady is the best player in the league. Pittsburgh barely won this super bowl on a miracle catch against Arizona???c'mon. Pittsburgh wants no part of NE in the playoffs.  You will never see new england have 100 yards in penalties in a playoff game.  The miracle play happened last year for the giants.  Next year, the patriots got the trophy!!|`|lhtYxY7gaa	Wow, you're just jealous because the Steelers won!  Get over yourself and your arrogant team :p|`|sMssDP1Xaa	How many Super Bowls have the Patriots won?  When they surpass the Steelers in Lombardi trophies, then you might be able to talk dynasty.  Until then, no.|`|cDKkKEgvaa	It's soooo funny how you think you know everything      The 49ers used to have a dynasty too.............look at em now!!|`|D6yvUKm3aa	they won't|`|uOVsCWdNaa	Umm.. lets not forget that the Patriots lost the Super Bowl last year. The Steelers would have stomped them into the ground anyway.   The Patriots are yucky to me.  Go Steelers! Polamalu is so hott by the way :)

thcr8Y5vaa	Uconn...|`|VHphDgrhaa	huskies they are clearly better than the cardinals.    i think Uconn will win!|`|avm08Amnaa	louisville will win,there at home and they are on a roll|`|mHqVnPWJaa	i bet you are betting on this game (centsports?) if you are add me as a friend.    im a DIEHARD uconn fan and i live in connecticut. i see all the weaknesses of this team and i am usualy dead on when betting for or against them. tonight you have to pick uconn!!! they even have a 2.5 spread in their favor)     UCONN WILL WIN THIS GAME! TRUST ME|`|ttg83T5Naa	Louisville is too deep for UConn, so they will pull away late in the second half, especially if Thabeet gets into foul trouble.  Louisville has 3 centers that could start on any top 25 team, not to mention 4 guards who are all potential starters.  Combine that with top pro-picks Terrance Williams and Earl Clark, and it's a no-brainer.  Louisville 76, UConn 69.|`|cHdgobQHaa	The Cards will come out on top. Never underestimate the powers of the Louisville defense. As long as T-Will is playing his best, then Louisville wins for sure. However, we are the Heart-Attack Cards so this game will go down to the buzzer... I say 84-81 GO CARDS!
utTFiz3gaa	It has happened in my lifetime (i'm 16 years old) but at the time (i was 7 and a half when they won the WS in 2002) i was still getting into baseball so i didn't really passionately follow a team. I got introduced to baseball in 2001 and my first WS was the Yanks vs D-backs..    But in 02 i was not an angel fan so i completely missed that magical year where they won the wild card, won the ALDS won the ALCS AND won the WS (it was truly a magical season because before that they haven't even won the division since god knows when.. and all those post season wins were wrapped up in one season) Repeating sounds so hard.... now i feel like every time the angels go into the playoffs they are gonna get kicked out in the first round so i am still waiting to witness my team's WS win :)|`|jOEuk9U2aa	Boston Red Sox!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5yZICXImaa	Being a young Jays fan too I have yet to see the Jays win a W.S. yet. Only If I were alive to see the biggest Homerun in Joe Carters life but unfortunetly I too and am left without a W.S.|`|12JCF1Wkaa	I can only hope that our Mets get to the play offs this year and prove to many they are a great baseball team, and once we get to the play offs and win our division I know we can put the last two seasons behind us and actually win the world series. I love being in first place most of the season but most important I want to beat the stinking Phillies out of title that was originally ours for the last two seasons. So I'm not going to say we are going to the world series this year but just to get to the playoffs and take our division would be a great improvement.|`|AA10349169	I saw them lose  And it was down right terrible|`|V430UrvFaa	I was really happy when the Marlins beat the Yankees in the 2003 world series, but I really don't know when it will happen maybe after they get their stadium and increase payroll, but anything can happen.|`|c03fc4c1b513dca7edce30261069af11aa	I have almost the same answer as minor league fan,we here in River City have been spoiled but then again this is Baseball Heaven. I thought that the 60's we had a chance to Win 2-3 in a row, same thing in the 80's now its the 00's and I think there's a theme here|`|NvRHYkuiaa	Atlanta Braves 1995  I was 4 years old    2012 is when I think they could win again|`|0EmjQjf7aa	I LOVE BOSTON RED SOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|CPxLHfKoaa	In 1993 when i was 7 i watched the Toronto Blue Jays win the world seies and as the bottom of the 9th came into show in game 6 against the Philadelphia Phillies as Joe Carter got up to bat with a 2-2 count and hit a walk-off homerun to win. Carter joined Bill Mazeroski as the only two players to win a World Series with a home run in the bottom of the 9th inning of the deciding game. When he hit it i got up and just cheered so loud. It is intense to have your favorite team to win the world series but even more intense to watch your team win with history.|`|jKOB7n35aa	Yes, I was disappointed after 2005 and 2008. Still hoping on 2009.|`|6tGYe5roaa	I am a Yankee fan. The last time my team won the World Series, it was their third year in a row. So naturally I thought that they could do it again (and I will say they came pretty close). Also I was younger then, at that time I thought my team would win the World Series every year.    If the Yanks were to win it all again, I would be happy with them at the moment. Then looking onto next season, I would hope that they could repeat but realistically speaking, I know how difficult that is.|`|frDcAqyWaa	I knew my Red Sox wouldn't repeat in 05 (they messed up all the pitching... idiots, and they got rid of the loosey goosey that was goin on in the dugout.)  and 08 wasn't their year, I knew it about half way in...     Its tough to repeat.  the Yankees generally speaking get their grouped Ws wins when the talent in the league isn't that strong, either b/c of expansion or Lou Gorman was a hack or the black sox scandal or Harry Frazee sold the Red sox to the yankees or KC made lobsided trades with them or there wasn't a draft...     as long as there isn't anymore expansion the Yankees will continue to buy teams that underachieve so don't worry about them, the Steinbrenners don't know squat about baseball and they run the show, everyone is subservient to the boss in that organization.     I saw the Mets win the WS and it broke my heart man.|`|C1tlS1GTaa	Back in 95 when the Braves won I was only 2 years old so I can't say I really remember or celebrated it. But I know it happened and I'm glad it did.    I feel the braves have a good shot at being competitive this year and you never anyteam can really put there hat in the race for a championship this year or any other year in my mind.    I also think that if your team wins a championship or course any true fan would think that they have at least some sort of a shot at repeating.|`|yg3Pveakaa	Not only the yankees but the red sox have done it a couple of time now..Go Red SOx|`|P1bO87l1aa	in my life time the Cardinals have won 8 pennants (64, 67, 68, 82, 85, 87, 04, 06) and 4 World Championships (64, 67, 82, 06) .  in the 60's I was younger and though they could win it every year.  As I have gotten older I realize it is very hard to repeat. i still root for my team.  I have every year since 1957 though good and bad years but I never expect a repeat.|`|2n6HSiF0aa	i was 10 years when my team, the white sox, won the world series in 2005. i actually did think that they could win the next year, until about june or july. i predict they're gonna win in 2016 when chicago(hopefully) gets the olympics.|`|AYiVipawaa	You don't think about, really. I'm a Red Sox fan, and when we won in 04, I was really happy, but I never thought of 05. Of course I wanted them to win in 05, but I wasn't too disappointed when they didn't.|`|L77OlY1naa	I felt like we were gonna again in 1987 and again in 88.But it's so impossible anymore.Nobody stays with a team long enough.Way too much money involved now|`|R0sfdiNeaa	I have seen the Reds win 3 world series in 1990, 1976, and 1975.  Can't wait to see it happen in the near future again.|`|gVYfFSpRaa	Well, 2008 was the only time they won it during my lifetime, but no, I don't think it's realistic for the Phillies to repeat.|`|c3tADklmaa	It was like yesterday! lol, well I don't think the Phillies will have a shot on a repeating is luck. They got there by momentum and outpitching the Rays. You got close 2006, but it's a feeling undescribable.|`|xIfvXy4waa	I was to little, just 6 but I remember thinking why is this such a big deal? My dad went to the 7th game and I thought it was the coolest thing. In 2002 I still could care less about baseball but I was hoping for another ring.|`|RJghPceKaa	i feel your pain, except im a jets, isles and knicks fan too|`|AA12374240	after the 98 season, i was sure the yankees would repeat in 99 because they seemed so unbeatable then. when they lost in the final game of 01, i knew we were done.

jHJ0W9QNaa	how was that NOT a penalty? Holmes was CLEARLY using the ball as a prop... that was supposed to be 15 yards!! TOTAL BS... also, James Harrison is a thug. did you see how he got that "unsportsmanlike conduct" call? he RAMMED the Cardinals kicker three times!! he should've been ejected!!    also, during that 100-yard interception, i saw several Steelers HOLDING Kurt Warner, which would've erased James Harrison's touchdown. and lastly, i saw a few "roughing the passer" fouls on Kurt Warner that were IGNORED.    PS: i thought that was an AMAZING game... except for the last two minutes when Warner choked sooooo badly. Larry Fitzgerald bailed him out|`|eqDXoCeTaa	The only really bad call all game I saw was roughing the passer.  That shouldn't have been called against AZ.|`|0VBdup3Caa	only 2? what about the other 10 or so?|`|ro5xcSt8aa	the refs gave the game to the arizonia and the steelers still WON!  Its over it dont matter.  AND it doesnt affect you|`|EvDoLydgaa	yes and the unecessary roughness against Ben and the Holder?    and the "TD" in that 100 yards return INT|`|jpiFhg1Jaa	What is the name of the river you are crying again?|`|njLVIp55aa	Holmes didnt have both feet down...his back foot was up against his other foot and not on the ground...thats 1....roughing the passer call was BS thats 2....warners throw not being reviewed thats 3...the guy took his helmet off thats 4...using the ball as a prop thats 5....on the run back b4 the half an AZ player was blocked in the back right in front of the ref and somehow it was missed...i could go on and on how it was a horribly bad job officiating...but its over and done with and teh Cardinals showed everyone they did deserve to be there...They picked apart the  1 defense in the league.....|`|AA11620976	I counted at least  5 major ones  1) Roughing the passer  2) Running over the holder  3) Not ejecting Harrison  immediately.If was ejected immediatley then the Cards last drive might have played out differently   4) The aforementioned Holmes celebration  5) The Warner forward pass/fumble   that should have at the very least been reviewed|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	wow, most of these responses are from idiots. Kick out harrison from the superbowl for blocking a player to the ground? HAHA. Most of these are judgement calls anyways and up to the refs.

It was not a well called game. It was bad on both sides of the ball, particularly the penalty calling. I don't know if it would have changed the outcome but anything is possible.|`|WtcTBlccaa	prop prob lol.na i agree 100 percent every play was reviewed last night but the most important was not what the hell his arm was going forward|`|AA12103453	Al Micheals and John Madden SAID the play was reviewed in the booth. As you saw on replays being shown there were good angles of it, so no reason for it to take long to review. People complain it didn't take long enough, but really it took all the longer it should. Anyway yeah the refs missed the celebration. I missed it too until review, but you'd think ONE REF would have noticed him.    Add:They CALLED A PERSONAL FOUL FOR TAKING OFF THE HELMET. It's called UNSPORTSMANLIKE CONDUCT. It happened AFTER the fumble and recovery, Pittsburgh Ball. The Steelers were backed up 15 yards, but they were kneeling down so who cares? Now don't you feel silly calling that a bad call?|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	I agree|`|Roes9U61aa	Kurt Warner's fumble was reviewed, all plays inside the 2min. are automatically reviewed. the celebration penalty may have helped the Cards, unfortunately it wasn't called and we will never see if it would have made a difference.|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	you can celebrate all you want in the endzone, you just cant have multiple players coming in as if it was choreograph...DUH most player use the ball as a prop..ex  the spike..    ur not even complaining ur searching for excuses..if you knew anything about football you would be mad that your team for not playing defense..don't forget you were ahead with 1 min and some change and the team went 80 yards..WHERES THE D?

8zgFyfibaa	It would be great (aot of chivestias and haters are gonna talk shet).    But, el pelado diaz is almost on his ways out. Aguirre is a good coach and I thinl he can make america a top contender for the clausura.     but I would rather have him coach for la seleccion mexicana.|`|XSBNv0iOaa	"WTF"  "WHAT HAS THE WORLD COME TOO"  thats how I would Respond  If such Nonsense ever Occured.|`|DO7nz8aRaa	thank god finally no argentinos|`|d006c09fcf96a47861ea8ba43ac7673faa	That well bee very goo.. i mean Aguirre is a World Class Coach, but WE as America fans must believe and suppor in his work and in the players to get us back on top|`|gcniNCn2aa	NO WEY!!!!!

Aguirre has been in Europe so long that he forgot about Mexican Futbol (well a little bit). El Pelado needs time and support from fans and directivos.

But, no don't go after nash. Maybe someone like Jameer Nelson of the Orlando Magic.|`|AA10305521	no one is going to accept that trade. fisher is doing well, not extremely well but, the team is very good they have scorers like kobe, gasol and bynum. they have rebounders like gasol and bynum. thats all they need. fisher cant shoot the ball that well, but he has been shooting the ball well the last week and a half|`|vDIQ5RrQaa	get rid of fisher and keep jordan farmar, hes the future|`|vltWIUh9aa	not really fishers doin fine for now and i think farmar is their backup. plus they have kobe gasol and bynum.... as long as some1 can pass it do those guys theyl be fine|`|PpFtN6P8aa	who cares?

9iB1AiQlaa	When you got Gregg Popovich, Tim Duncan, Manu Ginobili, Tony Parker, Michael Finley and Bruce Bowen, you should never count the Spurs out. They are a veteran team that knows the formula to win it all.|`|iNcdGwmiaa	Would you do me a favor? Instead of "how every year ppl count the Spurs out..." how about "how every year STUPID ppl count the Spurs out'? Spurs are like a bad skin rash just itching to break out. You would think that 'regular' people would know that by now. They are always and annoyingly in the mix.|`|rTbKXMMpaa	Incredibly. It's not that their being counted out. They just don't have the respect the rest of these guys do. I guess because they don't play fancy basketball. They get right to business. But watch it again. I bet you anyhting the spurs will be there in the west finals again.|`|RBdy17Ahaa	This is an odd year and if history repeats itself The Spurs will become the new champions|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Who's counting the Spurs out?|`|wsZz2ptmaa	I agree im not a spurs fan and i thnk that they r 1 of 2 that might win the championship, along wit the cavs...  Long Live Sactown|`|xhHfXuKFaa	they didn't prove any one wrong last year. remember they got whooped by the lakers?|`|kYBlgFQAaa	I think the Spurs probably prefer it that way.  It gives them the extra incentive (as if they need it) to prove people wrong.  The Sprurs aren't getting any younger, but Duncan, Manu, and Parker still have a lot of game.  The Lakers are the obvious favorite (in the West), but the Spurs have the ability and experience necessary to take them out.|`|3teWTOPqaa	no one is counting them out, especially after Bynum went down. But still, even without Bynum, the Lakers are still the best team in the West.
QQqen0tDaa	For the most part, Cardinals fans aren't football fans. Prior to a month ago, you couldn't find a Cardinals fan in Phoenix; they all jumped on the bandwagon after they won the first playoff game. Now you have these so-called fans who don't really understand football.                  Were there bad calls? Of course! On BOTH sides, but because the Steelers won the only ones whining are the Cardinals fans. Nobody is talking about how Fitzgerald ran out of bounds, then came back in to tackle Harrison.  How about when the Steelers were robbed of 7 in what should have been their first touchdown? I could keep going on, but there's no point in it.            Steelers fans have history; they're loyal. Never would you hear a Steeler fan say that they have "two or three" teams that they support, like I've heard from the mouths of several so-called Cards fans.  Cardinals fans hate us because they don't understand that kind of devotion. They think its "insane" that we're so supportive of our team.       I feel bad for the Cardinals; these fans are horrible.  I'd never cheer for the Cards, but as a team I don't dislike them.  They're a respectable team with a lot of talent. Too bad their so-called fans have to taint them.|`|cu02Y4cPaa	i looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... the steelers  thats my aunts team|`|rzkFHAEJaa	They won, because most of their poor sportsmanship went unnoticed. But they caught that  92 beatin on that cardinal he had just knocked down and he got a personal foul. I woundn't be suprized if he had kicked him too. If that's what it took for the steelers to win. They really are the STEALERS! CHOKE ON THAT!!!!|`|0VBdup3Caa	no one is "hattin" on the steelers they are hating on the refs lol and comeon be honest you cant tell me you dont think that game was lobsided and if you dont you clearly dont kno anything bout the game of football.|`|njLVIp55aa	its not hatin dude...its called pittsburgh didnt deserve to win...refs blew WAY to many calls and James Harrison is a POS for what he did towards the end of the game....Pittsburgh has een getting BS calls like that all year long...just like in the Ravens game before the half when they called roughing the kicker and NOBODY touched the fruitcake!! bunch of BS they were even in the superbowl!!!|`|cA3DDRGraa	Nobody is hating on the Steelers. They are just very aggressive and sneaky in the way they do their violations. They start fights because they are poor sports, that's all...    gram|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	Because all of the team are bad sports and their fans are ********, and did you see harrison beating that guy down, that was UNCALLED FOR. You cant tell me that is classy or else you are a r-tard. He should have been kicked out the game! Tomlin didnt do anything about it because he is low class like the rest of the team. Oh, and holmes, give the mvp to the refs, the REAL heros of steeler nation!|`|ec57eb059c56bfa71fae01e203b46ab4aa	every team fan base that plays the steelers hate on them!|`|XabVARMFaa	they just won. thats all. they didn't deserve to win. they were not the better team. thats why we cardinal fans are mad.the steelers where a soso team. i don't know many GOOD teams that let a team score 16 points in less then 10 minutes.|`|C2CCbTRKaa	IF YOU PUT THE SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT,THE STEELER FANS WOULD BE ACTING THE SAME WAY.THAT,S JUST THE WAY IT IS.WHEN YOU LOSE YOUR PISSED,AND YOU WANT TO USE EVERY EXCUSE TO SAY WHY YOU LOST.THAT,S THE NATURE OF THE GAME.|`|ed4b3bfc71d682a8400249ad88179c61aa	look on tv dumb fu cks steelers are champions we dont care bout ur opinion show me one call on arizona that shouldnt have been they played sorry they were behind and got frustrated STEELERS SIX TIME SUPERBOWL KEEP HATIN IT ONLY MAKES THEM BETTER PARADE TOMMOROW AT 12 CARDINALS PARADE WHEREEVER NEAREST TISSUE STORE IS LOL|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	Cards should of been penalized more. harrison was held entire game.|`|AA11620976	With the exception of the James "the Punk " Harrison nobody is hating on the Steelers.  The hating is being directed at what is becoming a -too-damned - obvious -to -ignore - any- longer- corrupt- NFL and the refs that it employs to do it's bidding.  Many of us have long suspected that the NFL like the NBA was not exactly on the up and up when it came to the honesty of their games and last night's corrupt Super Bowl  only  added fuel to those suspicions .|`|76f8cea41f4939e17e6dabe3557f7e33aa	The Steelers made the plays when they had to execute.  The Card fans feel King Roger needed a East Coast team to win the Super Bowl to keep up revenue in the NFL, when was the last time a team not on in the East won?  The Colts and look what happen them with all those calls from the Refs every since. If you examined all the calls (and non calls) by refs and one could be a believer in a conspiracy theory.  I though I saw at least 3 holds and one clip in that interception return.  I saw Ben intentional grounding, yet the refs call a personal foul on the Cards, just more fuel for a conspiracy.  While Ben was running around I saw what I though was several holds not called.  It comes down to this in my opinion: The team that gets away with cheating the most wins.  The same in the NBA  One unhappy Card fan.
cDKkKEgvaa	I don't think it was the refs fault but this was a bad year for refs.........it all started with Ed Hochuli so people are quick to blame refs now|`|OJ79IraJaa	They had a 3 pt lead, with less than 3 mins left.  The Cards lost because their D failed to stop them.|`|rzkFHAEJaa	NOT SO MUCH THE REFS, as for the poor sportsmanship I SAW, the so called great defense pull.|`|uOVsCWdNaa	These guys have to think of some reason that the Cards lost. The bottom line is that the Steelers played hard and won. That is all there is to it.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	I very much agree sir!|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	They blew 2 calls in the BIGGEST game of the year...and LAST...    Get a grip...The refs NEED to get it right in the Super Bowl...|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	I don't.  Refs don't score or defend.  Refs are human and just like the players they to make mistakes.  But isn't that part of the game, the human element, people get hurt, slip and fall, jump offsides, hold.  Even the ball suggests it is not a perfect game.  The ball takes funny bounces, gets slippery, can get knocked loose if hit just right.  But, in spite of all that, we love the game.  Its too easy to say the "Fix is in", as a means to avoid paying respect to the winning team.  I am neither a Steelers or Cards fan, but I like the way the Steelers play and I like the guts and poise that the Cards showed in the play offs.  Yes, its a game, but it is entertainment and the NFL put a great product on the field yesterday.  In the world today, its about time we got our monies worth.|`|nATkIg5zaa	There was a few bad calls but none that really effected the game|`|AA10568019	I'm not a Cardinals fan, and I'm not a Steelers fan, but I believe the Cardinals would've won if the refs had called the game correctly.  That happens sometimes in a close game.  If you don't want to hear about it then don't read (or ask) the questions.|`|B5DDAvQtaa	Arizona lost because they couldn't make the plays. Scoring on that final drive before half. Tackling Harrison before he got to the end zone.     We as Cardinals fans should be grateful they at least gave us that holding call in the end zone. That was a stretch. I really didn't think it was a hold. To tell you the truth they made way too many mistakes to have it be that close in the end.|`|tRGcmZDMaa	There were missed calls on both sides.  But refs don't play the game and the better team won.      People just like to complain and hate whenever their team loses.|`|zAkeKg5Qaa	No..both teams were subjected to the same lousy calls. I was not thrilled with the Refs, but they were bad to both teams.|`|nfCH7nkTaa	it would have been closer if there were no refs, how can you say that the fumble call at the end wasn't blown, and harrison should have been ejected when he got flagged for the unnecessary roughness, and holmes used the ball as a prop, thats 15 yards, one sided calls by the refs|`|t81MEJ82aa	I'm not a Cards or Steelers fan or hater. But the game was poorly officiated and favored the Steelers. Sure in any given games there are blown calls, but this was a game that it seemed like favoritism was shown, and for the 2nd time in recent years the Steelers benefitted. It's possible for a game to be great and yet poorly officiated. So because the game was great it's ok to excuse the officiating? WTF kind of logic is that. If the game was poorly officiated and one team was favored, is it not a reasonable conclusion to assume that these poor calls increased a team's chance to win. If it were 56-10 then who cares but the game came down to the last play.    Stop being a meathead and living by sports cliches.|`|C2CCbTRKaa	IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE CARDINALS STUPID MISTAKES.THEY WERE SHOOTING THEIR SELF IN THE FOOT A LOT.I CAN,T BLAME THE CALLS ON THE REFS.I THINK ALL THE CALLS WERE LEGITIMATE.
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	For sure back in the Attitude Era when she was in the original D-Generation X faction.Chyna worked an excellent style of technical powerhouse wrestling and could put on an entertaining match.    http://video.aol.com/video-detail/my-chy...|`|3icTrKLLaa	I thought in her last couple of years she was hot.    When she came in at the beginning though....that was gross.|`|VBfhoqS3aa	Shes hot now.|`|hl9nqKQ2aa	watch 'one night in chyna' lol|`|JiCfYfLraa	im a girl and im saying she was hot thats why she posed in playboy because they thought she was hot.|`|475ca662f051679937b7c94c642a9d64aa	I did think Chyna was hot|`|6f41c712d34a30397cc9d83fa0a8d496aa	Well im a girl and im not biasexual and ill say shes hot..  she also represents girls the right way.|`|94MdbPG7aa	She was alright|`|mDuiiVN7aa	I believed she was a dude, until I have heard that Triple h. was dating her!|`|2KIRdfIcaa	Her muscles were a turn-off, but I liked her face :)|`|NG5mOGsUaa	Definitely not, good wrestler sure but hot? no way|`|xaSEuGBGaa	I will admit that I thought she was attractive there at the end of her run, and her Playboy photos were hot too. Then I saw her and XPacs little video and realized she has a penis. I also realized just how much Playboy airbrushes their photos.    Shes not so sexy to me anymore.      .|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Kind of,I think she looked better near the end of her career though.And she has been looking better recently.|`|tuULGJS6aa	I don't. A woman full of steroids with muscles bigger than most men isn't attractive to many people.|`|MxhZgjXWaa	UUGGLLYYYYYYYY!!!|`|6pIspe7iaa	i have to admitt. her playboy shot was red hotttt|`|KH9bbeCNaa	obviously Triple H did|`|0KN8bX3Daa	Yeah at one point she was but now she is ugly.|`|7Lfa3y8Raa	She is too big for me. Gail Kim is much better.|`|AtJXqxN2aa	Me....I don't know what is was but damn she turned me on.
3teWTOPqaa	Yeah, I think this year it's him just making a commitment on defense, I mean he always had the athletic ability, the speed, strength, and hops to be a great defender, but he has been inconsistent in the past, whereas this year, he is making a constant effort to defend.    The best on ball defender is Ron Artest    The best at denying and making things difficult is Bruce Bowen    Prince and Battier all try to out hustle the offense player.|`|VHphDgrhaa	no he is not good but he isn't bad he be average!|`|g7qtpkiuaa	yes
4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	JBL is thinking business for HBK. He wants HBK to be successful on a massive pay cheque. Hear me out. WrestleMania is coming up. What if JBL wanted HBK to face Taker at WM25. If HBK broke the streak of 16-0, imagine the cash that would come JBL's way all because HBK beat Taker at WM. I think it's building towards that.    Tonight will only be start of that particular storyline!|`|InX5Pfl5aa	It will probably end up being HBK getting a spot then giving it up to JBL.|`|O6VTWYDtaa	.._,,-~~-,,  ..,- ; ; ;_,,---,,_ ; ;-,.._,,,---,,_  ., ; ; ;,- , , , , , -, ; ;-,,,,---~~~--,,,_..,,-~ ; ; ; ;__;-,  .| ; ; ;, , , , _,,-~ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ~-,,_ ,,-~ , , , ;,   ., ; ; -, ,-~ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;-, , , , , , ; |  , ; ;, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;-, , ,- ;,-  .,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;- ;,,-..  .., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;__ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; -,..  ,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,-: : -, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; _ ; ; ; ; ;,..  .., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;| : : : : : :| ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,-: -, ; ; ;,.  ., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; -,_: : _,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; | : : : : : :| ; ; ; |  , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;  ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;-,,_ : :,- ; ; ; ;|  ..,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,-~ , , , , ,,,-~~-, , , , _ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;|..  ,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;, , , , , , , ,( : : : : :) , , , ,-, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;|  .,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;, , , , , , , , ,~---~ , , , , , , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,..........   ; _, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ~-,,,,--~~~-,,_ , ,_,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,......  -~,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; | ; ; | . . . . . . ,; , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,_ ; -,......  ., ; ;,-, ; ;, ; ; ;, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; , ; ;, . . . . ., ;, ; ; ; ;, ; ; ;,-, ; ;, ~-- ........  ,-~ ,--~ , ,- , ,,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; , ; ; ~-,,,- ; , ; ; ; ; , ;,- ; , ,-,......  .,- ; ; ; ; ;  ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; -,,_ ; ; ; _,- ; ; ; ; ; ;- ; ; ;  ; ;-,..  .,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;-,.  - ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; |, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; -,.  , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;|..-,_ ; ; ; , ; ; ; ; ; ,..   ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; | ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,.,-~ ; ; ; ; ; ,..  ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;~-,,,,,--~~~-,, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,..,-~ ; ; ; ; ; ; ,-  ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,-..  ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,., ; ; ; ; _,,-  , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,.~~  -, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;_,,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,-.  ~-,,_ ; ; ; ; _,,,-~ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,-..  ..| ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,,- LOL  .., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,-  .. .....| ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;|  , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ~-,,___ ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,  ., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,-.-, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,  .., - ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,-.-, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,..  ., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,,-., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,.  , ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,--, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; |.  ., ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,,-, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; |  .| ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;,  .| ; ; ; ; ; ; ,..,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,.  .| ; ; ; ; ; ;,.,- ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,-  .,_ , ; , ;,., ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ,-  ,,,,,|.| ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; --,,  ...-, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;~,,  -,, ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ;~-,,  ..-, ; ; ; ; ; ,,_ ; ;-,-,  .., ; ; ; ; ; ; -,__,\--\.........................  -, ; ; ;,,-~ \ , ,|, |  ~-_ , , ,,,_/--  .~-~............|`|oAjbBLDpaa	HBK will probably be in his own qualifying match that he will win but JBL will tell HBK to give up that spot to him.|`|5vXgcAbCaa	watch and see. geez, people are so impatient these days|`|2TyQZffuaa	Yeah, Michaels would probably give up his spot to JBL and then interfere somehow and superkick him|`|6f41c712d34a30397cc9d83fa0a8d496aa	Well im a huge hbk fan he is my role model and the storyline i think would go this way HBK wins the match to qualify for the tittle and jbl will tell him to give it to him.

UQLNP6iyaa	I've heard it too. If it's true it means Brady's rehab has improved and he'll be ready to practice after spring. It would make sense. Pioli has the links to start that kind of conversation, will be familiar with what the Patriots will want to trade Cassel and he will have been involved in the decision to franchise him in the first place.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	he isnt being a dealt, its just a rumor it could happen you know how many rumors are out there? it would be funny to see what Pioli would give the pats for a 1 yr deal for cassel|`|0VBdup3Caa	they hit matt cassel with the franchice card no way hes getting traded.|`|nfCH7nkTaa	I've heard it too, but I don't understand why it would happen, thigpen is a perfectly capable qb and the patriots still aren't sure of brady's health|`|wxXguyK3aa	The Patriots better get something good in return.  Cassel is a great QB.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Well, it won't be happening before next season...Not until the Patriots know how Tom Brady is...Cassel will be franchised for next season...The Patriots aren't stupid...They're not gonna ASSUME Brady is 100% until they see him in training camp...|`|okV8A1Ayaa	No he is not, it is called speculation.  If you believed everything you hear.  The chiefs would already have shanahan as a coach.|`|400417428a6511713d8a632d1228c71faa	Why would the patriots deal him to the team that injured tom brady?|`|c03a1e29209b69a15065f8edab5c54daaa	Its all complete speculation right now, but if the Chiefs dangle that  3 pick in the draft out there for him it could become a reality.  That trade helps both teams.    The Chiefs could get a better QB than they would be able to draft in Cassel and they would get him for less money than they would have to pay a  3 pick.    The Pats would get two 1st round picks and could trade down the  3 pick for even more.

THATS 6 WOO HOO|`|0VBdup3Caa	not a cards fan or pat fan but you say no proof? lmso wait till the ref retire and say how they have to rigg the games. look at the ref that said the commisioner told him to rigg the 2002 NBA finals.. just wait the pats didnt get caught right away it took time i mean they won 3 championships before they got caught but just wait the proof will come out soon. just still celebrate cause even though they refs gunna admit they had to rigg it they cant take away the championship.        Saints 2010 champs baby!! lol probley not but i can hope right lol.
hl9nqKQ2aa	Well rounded and balanced routine - but i personally believe it can turn someone into a good footballer, but there are many many other factors to consider/account for.  Age of the player/willingness to learn(its all good doing those exercises but unless your pushing urself mentally and physically it will not matter)/God-given talents (having a 'football brain', good genetics and fantastic co-ordination) of course staying injury free is absolutely key especiallyy in those crucial years on development (13-19years old i believe)    But hey if you have those things too - then good luck to you, you deserve all the riches and acclamation that is potentially at the end of the long winding road!
cu02Y4cPaa	i realy don t like superbowl commercials|`|0VBdup3Caa	i think they have so many rules about what can go on tv and what cant there are no more actually "Good" commersials. but the best this year was probley the dennies commercial cause we alll get free grand slams!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :))|`|ro5xcSt8aa	the coke commercial that they remade using troy polomalu|`|GPZUrQoTaa	I liked the new job commercials. The one went on about, if you scream, noone respects you, you cry all the time, and you daydream of hitting small animals...you may need a new job! =D|`|gW0nD5cEaa	The only one I can think of is the Clydesdale that 'fetched' the tree branch after the Dalmatian fetched a stick.    I also liked the E Trade baby with a black baby friend. I got a kick out of the Potato Heads, I had not seen Mr. Potato Head in 40 years, but I did not think the commercial was great, I can't even remember what it was for.     I didn't seem to me there were a lot of memorable commercials last night. A lot of car-related ones. Some weren't original to the Superbowl, like the travel company one with William Shatner. That's been on for weeks.    I also liked the one with Alec Baldwin where he turned out to be an alien who programmed TV or something. That was funny.
xhHfXuKFaa	don't worry to much. they made the finals last year without him....|`|H7AcXAyaaa	They are stuffed without Bynum.|`|rTbKXMMpaa	I think they need a trade. They did make it last year without bynum but they've been playing so long this year with Bynum. So I wonder how big of an affect that might have. And if Shaq wants to come to L.A, and your down a star centre for 8-12 weeks, do I need to say it. Bring him back.
lHDff8Braa	No.  It was a fumble.  The motion of the arm does not make it an incomplete pass.  He also has to be in control of the ball.  The ball was clearly coming loose as his arm was going forward.  That's a fumble.|`|a6EndAPiaa	Nope it was not necessary.  Empty hand moving forward = fumble 100% of the time.    I am sure the replay official saw that and quickly determined that it was not necessary to conduct an *official* replay.|`|jwQPWl5Haa	"outraged"? are you kidding me? It was a fumble and I can make a case for a fumble earlier in the third quarter as well.    However, as heard on Mike & Mike in the morning on espn radio an official did review it and it was confirmed to be a fumble. Play was not stopped because it was determined quickly that it was clearly a fumble and no further review was necessary.     Now, put your pacifier back in and get over it!|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Well, not outraged...because neither are my team...but I do think the Cardinals got screwed out of a couple O plays...The play at the end should have been ruled incomplete, and Santonio Holmes should have been flagged 15 yards for excessive celebration on a TD...|`|Roes9U61aa	No I;m not outraged. every play with in the last 2 mins. are reviewed in the booth, they reviewed it a determined it was a fumble.|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	STEELERS = SUPERBOWL CHAMPIONS    the end|`|Yh63ysrzaa	No, as a huge Steelers fan I can honestly say, it wasn't anything but a fumble.  GO STEELERS!|`|8DOpnIK0aa	/yawn|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Yup, but the squealers always get all the brakes and then are piss poor winners as well as losers which they are in all reality.. In my book cards won.|`|43f9Ctozaa	I think you should review everything that is questionable. It is the Super Bowl and isn't that the reason for replay in the first place, to get the calls right.|`|8395da10127cb75a6ae0139eed63b0a4aa	it was bull****, and i think that with all the blown calls this year in the NFL, im not surprised. they should have challenged it, they didn't give them enough time. I guess they wanted to show "The Office" that badly which in retrospect was hilarious last night. NFL, look into your internal issues, because i would have loved to have seen Warner bomb it for a last second miracle. Sucks don't it|`|e24jota5aa	Of course it was an incomplete pass, you Steeler fans are looking through it with your Myron Cope glasses. There was no way the NFL was going to send everybody back to the sidelines and then assess their 15 yard penalty on the Steelers for removing their helmets and give the Cardinals another play, the confetti was already falling and the stage was being wheeled out. Any other game and that gets a proper review and its overturned. Watch again, his hand has the ball and its moving forward...incomplete.
a6EndAPiaa	Harrison's play was more impressive    However, Harrison's unsportsmanlike penalty was so stupid of a play that he should not get the award.    And since Fitzgerald played for the loosing team I am going to say that they gave the award to the right person Holmes!|`|jzKJDrEWaa	it's tough but ima go with fitz|`|xPXUzZiJaa	i think both did excellent plays but i think that harrison did the bes play of the two so he should get the award. go steelers!|`|nDzenpkwaa	i think harrison return is way better!!! Holmes's catch with 30 sec left was a better play than Fitzgerald made...|`|C2CCbTRKaa	I LIKE THE PLAY BY FITZGERALD IT WAS ALL SKILL.THE ONE BY HARRISON SHOULD OF NEVER OF HAPPENED.YOU MEAN TO TELL ME NO ONE COULD TACKLE HIM.HE WASN,T THE FASTEST GUY ON THE FIELD,SOMEBODY SHOULD OF HAD HIM.|`|XzisJYoAaa	fitz made 2  and i guarentee if there would have been one last play he would have caught a hail mary|`|wbIEau0qaa	fitzgerald out ran everyone|`|acf69de26db5a8a4dd0df221ecbd9869aa	Hands down.....Harrison.  Linebackers aren't meant to run 100 yards.  LOL  Way to go Steelers!|`|9iB1AiQlaa	Fitzgerald|`|43f9Ctozaa	It was Harrison. The game was lost at that moment. If he didn't run that pick back it is still a three point game going into halftime and the Card would have gotten the ball to start the second half.|`|AA11097612	If you are comparing Fitz's pass catch against Harrison's interception return for a touchdown I would have to say Fitz.  It was precision and speed as Larry Fitzgerald blew by the Steeler secondart on that great catch and run.    If you are comparing it to Harrison's pummeling of the Cardinal player I would have to go with Harrison since Fitz's catch and run wasn't the knock out punch. :-)|`|XabVARMFaa	fitz. but you know its going to lopsided. pittsburg fans are going to pick harrison.|`|9UQMluK2aa	HARRISON!!!!! He rocks, Fitzgerald barely made any catches last night except that one run which wasnt even very far. Definatly not even close to the 100 yards Harrison ran! STEELERS ROCK!!!|`|WZXboi4Xaa	harrison would have got it if he would have just kept his cool i think that personal foul hurt him. I am just glad my team one. go steelers!
HOB1EhA0aa	I have a hard time seeing both of them in a giants jersey. Crede sucks they should stick with pablo sandoval at 3rd and somehow get dunn to play first.

j9GokH9Qaa	Of course... The Rock is one of my all time favorite wrestler.. and I would do anything to see him have one more match... against Stone Cold would be great or even Shawn Michaels.. they never had a match.. and they have unfinished buisness since 1999 where there was a match between The Rock and Triple H for the WWE title and HBK was the guest referee.. HBK superkicked him at the end.. and after that match HBK didnt show up for 4 years..|`|rRIYB9WNaa	Totally!|`|9Us6XYg8aa	vs cena at WM25    that would make all the kids happy.    oh ya they don't know who the rock is.|`|chCcWbnBaa	Remember the hall of fame where he talked to stone cold about another match , lets hope for the best|`|FsnxfhEuaa	If He was to come back, I would LOVE!, LOVE To See The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin, in an AMBULANCE Match, BTW, If you don't know what an Ambulance Match is, Look at the Meaning down Here :             The Ambulance Match is one of the rarest in World Wrestling Entertainment history. Very few times have two Superstars competed in such a competition. The rules are simple, as there is only one -- the winner is the first Superstar to place his opponent into a ringside ambulance and close the door. Everything else is legal. As a result of this, Ambulance Matches often find themselves flowing outside of the ring. In addition, the ambulance is very often used as a weapon and/or launching pad.|`|Og4Ab2dSaa	what?|`|nep4Jl8naa	haha yeah that would be cool but against cena    RKO is right kids dont know the rock, they just no him as they guy from the disney movies i still cant belive the peoples champ would go and do disney movies|`|UzEAVZ6Aaa	Battle of the Rocks    The Rock vs. Don The Rock Muraco!      Yeah boy!|`|ZtZqtYA8aa	yes|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	Yes vs Stone cold in the last man standing!
ucot94w3aa	Riding with the board flat is pretty tough, even for riders with experience.  You always want to try to keep some pressure (even very, very light) on either your toe or heel edge.  This is what gives you control.  However, on long, flat stretches sometimes you want to ride flat so you can make it to the next slope.  In this case, just take a stance directly over your board with your knees slightly bent.  This is an "athletic stance" that gives you the most balance and allows you to redistribute your weight quickly if you need to make an adjustment (to keep you going straight).|`|N3qc36Ataa	The speed will come easier as you become more confident, which will come with experience.  Safety gear -helmet, impact shorts, wrist guards, etc.- can help with your confidence, too.   Try to plan a gentle turn as you cross the flat.  Turning will have the board on edge, reducing the amount of area making contact with the snow, thus reducing friction.  Friction is what slows you down.|`|mperjS8caa	either put pressure on yout toe or heel edge.  if your on the flats, bend your knees and put pressure on one of your edges.  when you start going fast, you need to put pressure on your heel edge only.  the heel efge will keeep you on control, and slow you down only a little.  this is what everybody does, and before you know it, you wil be across the flats!|`|Lngb8ryFaa	get enough speecd to make it thru the fast parts and bent your knees..almost to the point of sitting, it'll keep you going fast but it will laso add stability so you wont fall|`|jTaW3goeaa	keep light pressure on your heelside edge when riding straight , enough that it keeps you in control but not enough that you start carving and slowing yourself down.  You always have to be in control of the board or the board is going to control you.
bab67bc9b7fdc1b9aa5749db28df2419aa	His right hand clearly hits the Cardinal squarely on the right shoulder.  Not the back.  Yes, please go back and watch closely.  Right hand hits the right shoulder.     Seriously, quit your whining if you don't understand the rules.    They didn't call the "blatant block in the back" because he didn't block him in the back.  Can you follow that logic?    Oh, and another thing, don't you love how the refs didn't flag Fitzgerald for leaving the field of play and then coming back on to make a tackle?  Fitz ran all the way down the field on the sideline, out of bounds.  Then he came back on the field to attempt the tackle.  COMPLETELY ILLEGAL!!!  (Steeler fans will remember that being called against Troy Edwards in the 2001 AFC Championship Game.  He left the field of play, came back in and made the tackle on a punt.  He was called.  The Steelers had to rekick.  Troy Brown returned the next punt for a TD)  Yet not called.  How come you aren't bitching about that?|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Here you go bro, at 18 seconds it occurs.  Watch  56 at the top of your screen.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcSvDCGAd...     Harrison could bring a loaded machine gun onto the field, point it at Warner.  That wouldnt be a penalty either.  Im 32, been watching the NFL for 25 years.  In my opinion, that is a illegal block in the back as well as the other posters who commented on that youtube video (except Steeler fans of course)|`|WTQtchbvaa	Actually Chad C, I like your tape, it has a perfect angle. That was not a block in the BACK. Last time I checked knocking someone over by pushing them from the side is not a block in the back. I have played football for 6 years at TE, WR, and DE so I have blocked as well as been blocked in the back. If you watch the video, the receipient of the block didnt even complain. The whole world saw that play 100,000 times, if it was such a controversial call, them we would have heard about it from a legitimate source.|`|86vG0vKfaa	That's my take on the whole game for the most part the Cardinals were getting BS from all sides.|`|N447Emwdaa	Did you actually watch the play?  Apparently not.  Not only did the guy supposedly getting "blocked in the back" turn his shoulder at the last second before being hit, he was also previously pushed away and blocked by Woodley 10 yards earlier on in the play.  It impossible to illegally block someone in thew back if they are coming INTO the play from the front or the side.  The fact the player being blocked turns away from the blocker doesn't suddnely make it a penalty and this is actually covered in the RULEBOOK.     Here is an idea for you, learn the rules first before complaining about the call and then whinning about wild conspiracy theories because the game didn't end up like you hoped it would.|`|lHkgWF2Aaa	not a block in the back AT ALL. COMPLETELY LEGAL.    but how bout fitz running down the field, OUT OF BOUNDS, and then finally coming back in to make the tackle!
65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	The key is    Are they comfortable on your feet?  Are they made to run in?    Personal comfort is the most important thing in a running shoe.    Everyone on Yahoo! seems to dislike Nike shoes, whether its for comfort reasons or durability or whatever.  I've owned 4 pair of them, and loved every pair!  I put 300 miles+ on each pair before retiring them, and even then they were still good shoes just for walking around in (after a good washing, of course).  The only problem I've ever had with Nike shoes is the price!    You really need to go somewhere and try on running shoes, even if you plan to buy them online.  It'd suck to buy a pair of shoes that you hadn't tested and find them to be uncomfortable.|`|FIG58FVpaa	They'll be fine, too. (I just answered your shirt question with the same answer...) ;)    Everyone who runs a lot will have their own favorite brand, though. Mine happens to be New Balance.|`|Lol0iLfgaa	Honestly, I'm not a big fan of Nike running shoes.  Their track spikes and racing flats are great, but they don't make the best shoes for just running/jogging.      With that said, you probably picked out one of the best training shoes Nike offers.  I actually know someone with those.  They like them.  I'd say go for it.  If you don't like them, you can always buy a pair of ASICS :)|`|J5nnqrx0aa	ohh yeahh.  those are good shoes!  personally though, I never buy nike shoes because they really hurt my feet whenever I run...if you have the same problem, I would suggest switching over to adidas.  hope that this helped!|`|eDCyle05aa	I am with Michael J, I do not like Nike running shoes, I got a pair of them once and i didn't like them at all. I have been getting Brooks because they are the most confortable ones that I've gotten. Asics are really good too.
