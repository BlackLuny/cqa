Edit: Woah, how could I forget about Mario Kart DS. Great game.|`|BpUTyfDxaa	My favorite DS games  1 Mario Kart Ds can be played on line with other people. Very fun to play against friends.  2 Super Mario 64|`|1rZbmyYfaa	Professor Layton and the curious village    http://professorlaytonds.com/|`|dvkWQvfDaa	Chrono Trigger DS    Chrono trigger was the best RPG game made for Super Nintendo. Today it is considered a masterpiece, one of the best RPGs ever, and it's on the top 100 games in the history of videogames.    What is so awesome about this game? Gameplay is like a final fantasy game (it was developed by Square after all). The storyline is excellent! Not only that, but it has over 12 different endings, plus various ways to get them all. The replayability value of the game is very high, as you'll want to beat the game in every possible way, getting a different ending each time.    It is a MUST for every owner of a nintendo DS.    Other games I suggest:    Jump! Ultimate Stars  Trauma Center: Under the Knife (1 and 2)|`|KIXlDnCIaa	If you like text-based games then Hotel Dusk: Room 215 is an amazing, mystery solving game! The Phoenix Wright series is fantastic, starting with the first game Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney.    The World Ends With You is a very strange and unique, yet very enjoyable RPG!    And Kirby Power Paintbrush is so damn addictive and has tons of replay value! (I know the thought of playing as a lil, pink puffball probably puts you off but trust me it's so fun!)    If you need more info on these games (or any other game) just type the name of it into the search engine of this website for reviews and stuff! http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.u...    Hope i helped!! =D|`|9BZSxKBXaa	i would go with zelda if your into those kind of games i prefer that game because when you beat it you can still go around killing people and have fun.......i love that game|`|Ndtu3m3jaa	OK, my top three that you don't have there would be:  1)Advanced Wars Dark Conflict (Turn Based Strategy)  2)Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings (Real Time Strategy)  3)Pokemon Diamond/Pearl/Platinum (RPG)  Those 3 are all great games that will take longer than a day. I personally like FFXII because it has a great storyline, fantastic soundtrack and it is a RTS (Its got no multiplayer though).|`|PQGYUm6Eaa	Ok... Here is something you could get.  -You could get Action Replay for the Nintendo DS. With the Action Replay you could get codes and have lots of fun with. For example: Have you been dieing to get rid of those weeds in Animal crossing, Get any item in the game(Even the ones that are really rare) Ever wanted to make your house into a mansion and even better Pay off your debt to Tom Nook!  -Well Action replay can do that.    - A game you could get is Super Mario 64. Personally, This is my favorite DS game b/c it is a re-make of the older version of the game.    -Another game you could get is Call of Duty: World at War. Yeah sure its a shooter on DS, but I read the comments on Gamestop.com and people really like this game and that they recommend the game to their friends and other people
BpUTyfDxaa	I do believe that it does. I was playing with my brother split screen and i used a class that had camouflage and he couldn't see me.|`|1rZbmyYfaa	I think so

AA10248312	"How to Reassess Your Chess" and "The Amateur's Mind" are both excellent books by Jeremy Silman.    However, there's no such thing as the "best" chess learning book.    "Win at Chess" is a good all-in-one book by Ron Curry (it's "a comprehensive guide to winning chess for the intermediate player"). Excellent book, sets out a good thought process for before and after each of your moves.    Yasser Seirawan's series is excellent.  The Books should be studied in the following order:    1) Play Winning Chess  2) Winning Chess Endings  3) Winning Chess Tactics  4) Winning Chess Strategies  5) Winning Chess Combinations  6) Winning Chess Brilliancies  7) Winning Chess Openings    "How to Play Good Opening Moves" (by IGM Edmar Mednis) is an excellent book.  I'd recommend it for a 1400.  At that level, you don't need to be studying openings yet. Class players (i.e. rated below Expert) make too many tactical errors during games for the opening to have any significance.  but this book will teach  you to make logical moves during the opening so that you'll arrive at the middlegame in good shape.  But don't waste your time studying and memorizing openings at this point. Just learn the principles of openings, and you'll be fine.   Focus on tactics and endgames.    Jeremy Siliman also has an Endgame Course book that is excellent. Bruce Pandolfini's Endgame Course book is not bad either.    You can also check out Susan Polgar's "A World Champion's Guide To Chess" and "Chess Tactics for Champions".    John Nunn has a lot of excellent books out, including "Learn Chess Tactics".  Nice insights in this one.    Also, if you don't have "Logical Chess, Move by Move" by Irving Chernev, get it.  It takes you through over 30 GM-level games, and explains the reason behind every move.|`|VDiLab9caa	Reassess your chess is a good book for a 1400 rated player.  The author is SIliman|`|RcL7HhLKaa	Why don't you search it on the internet and purchase that book online or you can find it in your local library!|`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	The best chess book is the one you read.    Seriously.  You got plenty of good recommendations but it is now up to you to read them.

rbYJro0Iaa	1. Coconut trees have to be planted within at least nine shovel spaces from the ocean. I wouldn't plant it to close to the water, though. I've planted about 8 and only about 5 survived.    2. Balloons appear randomly every day and you can shoot them down with the slingshot. I've shot down 3 in one day!    3. Special items appear randomly. I've had at least one each week.|`|bKwQyCEHaa	1. make sure you water the coconut trees    2. you can find a balloon present  any time any where in your town and shoot it down with a sling shot    3. special items appear randomly
I8b66BvSaa	if you want to do it without cheating and therefore feel like you have actuallyearned the money get a job as a blasksmith, and get alot of money. if you keep doing missons you will get the bartender job which when you get too a high level pays alot more money and faster than the blacksmith job. Then but the inn/pub, and make sure to buy the biggest and most expensive shops and businesses possible. The game may want you to believe buying small shops first is the best way but you make hardly any money at all even with a few. The you get money every five minutes and also while your console is turned off.|`|q6uyloYdaa	Buy stores (start small with the carts) and jack up the prices as much as possible. Once you own a store you earn money every 5 minutes while you're playing and every hour while you're not. If you REALLY need money fast, buy some stores and then exit the game. Change the date on your Xbox to a year ahead and sign in the game again. It will think you haven't played in a year and will give you a bunch of money. Then you can turn the calendar back and it won't take your money away. It's kind of cheating, but it works (:

C6Job2RLaa	Hi there, respect in Imob isn't as interesting as it looks. It is the way the creators of the game can earn money. You can not earn respect points but you will have to buy these. You can do this by clicking the app store icon on your Iphone / Ipod Touch and then search for IMOB. It will present you the respect point options you can buy. When you have bought these, you can use the THE DON icon at the bottom of the screen (in IMOB) to buy health, instant energy or 1 henchman (mob). Hope this helps.

And Scorpion because he can rip out spines.
sJcDstkMaa	Go for any of the sub machine guns. Once you practice for a while u can get good at any gun. Just find the perks that work best for you. Most beginners like to use stopping power and deep impact it helps get kills quick and save ammo. and i always go for all of the marksman challenges, because most people dont get used to the guns untill after the first marksmen   hope this helps good luck|`|8T2R2bqyaa	mp40 for me basically any of the submachine guns and your level 27 so you just got the type 100 two levels ago try that one out if want to get the marksman III challenge done which is worth 1000 experience|`|a8M1uetWaa	use the mp40 it will make you get many kills also use the trench gun for close shotting it will also get many kills Im on level 4 of prestige already so trust it will work.|`|8XOoNpU7aa	Mp40, Type 100, Thompson, STG-44 there the best guns to use to level up  Use the automatic guns  And also stopping power and deep impact or steady aim

LdjNYhLlaa	:o you didn't like Call of Duty 4!? well i guess that's you but i loved it :)    Anyway you should DEFIANTLY get Assassins creed! its really fun to play and you play as such a cool assassin.    and no its not short at all. It will keep you busy for long hours especially the boss Assassinations.  second: It is a bit repeative, but only at very rare times i thought it was great. ( and its got to be better than a game with too many cut-scenes)    Metal gear solid i just didn't like that much. Its too much like halo. And it did feel like i was watching a movie. But yea you shouldn't get it especially if you didnt play the other ones.|`|PlSSKLd7aa	Metal Gear Solid is one of the best games out now period.  Don't spend your time with AC get MGS4!!!!  I'm playing it now and it's amazing.|`|q6uyloYdaa	Metal Gear Solid 4 is a great game, but if you've never played a MGS game before you might be pretty confused. It does have a lot of cutscenes, but the gameplay is great.  Assassin's Creed is a good game too, but it does get repetetive. You can run around cities and do whatever you want GTA-style to spice things up, but each level is essentially the same formula. It is really fun though (until it gets boring).
OlKipHQzaa	How could you not like it people would kil  for that game.|`|q6uyloYdaa	If you bought it new, unfortunately it's yours. You could trade it in but you'll only get like $10 or so. If you bought it used, you could probably still return it, but if you don't like it they usually won't take it after 7 days. It depends on the employee.|`|2bfdxef1aa	I think sooo but im not sure. Last time i did that they gave me store value but that sucked!! I dont think u should trade it in tho. I have the same game and its way to fun!!!
71tSa5ESaa	At Game you would get about 110 for the console, although I don't know why you would want to trade the Xbox in.|`|AA12121752	Sell it on ebay    Use a fair buy it now if you want - or sell individually for more|`|xVMQx7dtaa	ll buy it if your looking to sell for about 150 or less|`|5bb39309a59ee6724b63ca6cd4cb0048aa	There's only one way to find out - take it there and get an offer. When they make it, ask "Is that the best you can do?"|`|47u7xXkzaa	take it into a shop that excepts trade-ins for them to decide depending on the condition of the console and the condition of the games.|`|xnK1roCRaa	not alot   u get ripped off to the max  =/  you can give me cod5 and fifa 09 if u like tho :D lol
00bwUS9haa	try mix them up,   like a water move, psychic, thunder etc.     try maybe psychic, (mew should learn it) and like thunder and blizzard (if their on pokemon yellow) ice beam mega punch r good too.|`|mqzLOJUDaa	Explosion is the most powerful :)  But i think that guy above me is right. Teach him:  Blizzard  Thunder  Psychic  Soft-Boiled  And you are the champion.  Good luck
nbLsSKhTaa	I think that the R4 is about 20.00 plus the price of a MicroSD card. It is illegal based on where you live. There legal in the USA thats all i know. However, just check with the retailer. I heard that a shop in Great Brittan was raided with DS flash carts so, just make sure before you buy. Be aware that using the R4 to play downloaded DS games WITHOUT OWNING THE ORIGINAL GAME is illegal no matter where you live. But homebrew is totally legal. have fun!|`|qYrT6Znfaa	they are somewhat illegal. like if nintendo knows u used one they can refuse to fix your ds if it breaks etc. and there is a cheap r4 called "Games & Music" i got mine at wallmart but i think they sell at EB games and Gamestop or u could just go on google and search it, go to the website and buy it online =P hope i helped|`|QXnSpaAoaa	Ofcourse its illegal, to sell those products, but you won't get in trouble for having one i got 1, you can get them for like 8 bucks right here:    http://www.dealextreme.com/    But i got mines for FREE by using this site to get it for me:    http://prizerebelsignup.blogspot.com/|`|ZiMkydtHaa	they only illegal once the rom (game) is added   you can get them for http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sk...  works out about 9 with a 2gb card thats the dstt one   or the r4 http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sk...  works out about 6 thats with no card

VHBa9EHRaa	Armor on a mount makes it feel more epic, like you're prepared for battle! The armor itself doesnt really have a purpose. Also, there has to be a way to show the difference in the mounts. If they all looked the same it would be boring and confusing.|`|q6uyloYdaa	It's just for looks. The armor doesn't actually do anything.|`|hEeeUetyaa	i dont know|`|gmGy02Nbaa	Would you want to be running around naked?
KIXlDnCIaa	Not so much as a cheat, and you might already know this but, every day in your town there is a certain rock that when hit will spill out money (you'll need a shovel). The trick is to dig three holes in a horizontal line one space away from the rock, this way when you hit the rock with your shovel you won't be sent flying back, making it much easier, meaning more money! Just keep hitting it as fast as you can until it stops spewing money. It won't get you much (about 8000 each time) but it does help. Note that it will be a different rock each day. Also, I don't think there are any proper cheats for animal crossing, if you really want that gorgeous set you're gonna have to work for it...sorry!    Hope I helped! =D|`|kr3PzD5baa	look up cheat engine 5.4, its a good way to cheat/hack money based games.

Vliaa3QUaa	Oh man...it's been a while since I've played this. As I remember, though, there's a few that occur that you have to play for play progression, but then you can go play at the dome whenever you want. I think there's someone in the dome you speak with to start a blitz game (maybe in the locker room?)
pKlKJR4qaa	Its completely random! Thats why they're called random events..   To maybe increase the chance, although you may just get another random event do what you think a macroer would do. Random events were made to stop macroers. So maybe do something like fishing in a fishing spot then running to a bank then repeating that over and over and over and over and over and over and over... till you get it.|`|1Iyh30duaa	No sorry. It's completely random.|`|nJMqX53Naa	No, actually, I don't believe burying bones will help. I got freaky forester when I was just standing around.|`|xuIcsOXcaa	There is one way and its by burying bones and saying RANDOM! at the same time your burying them that works like 85% of the time but you have to wait 30 mins before doing agian or else it wont work.      P.S please put as best answer|`|JoMDzj32aa	This event has no trigger.
2088750e2e24db94af84bd0688460755aa	Silent Hill 2 is considered the fan favorite, so you could start with that one if you want, especially since its story isn't related to any of the other games (though there are a few character connections in Silent Hill 4: The Room).  The only games that have connecting storylines are the prequel (Silent Hill: 0rigins), the original (Silent Hill) and Silent Hill 3.  However if you want to start playing them in order, I'd suggest the following:    - Silent Hill 0rigins  - Silent Hill  - Silent Hill 2  - Silent Hill 3  - Silent Hill: The Room  - Silent Hill Homecoming    That way, you get to see how and why the town got to be the way it is and watch its evil spread.  It's quite the experience.|`|ec96a7005525b280dafea257208badeeaa	would you watch the 2nd movie before you seen the first. one didn't think so. go with the first one if you like it, then do the rest.

When inside go to the red mat on the ground with a lil envelope icon on it. When the pelican comes rushing over to you, talk to her and give her the letter (there should be an option that says 'give letter' or something on the lines of that).  Great game btw!    Hope I helped! =D|`|yY5LdTVvaa	For the letter you go to the town hall and give it to the person that collects the mail.|`|wG8z5cUgaa	Okay I know this is confusing at first. You don't actually hand the letter you just wrote to the person in your town. Go to your town hall (the building with the clock tower out front where you first started the game) you can also locate it by opening your map (press the plus on your wii remote) and clicking town hall in the list menu to see where it is in your town. When you walk in you will see the white pellican (Pelly) who first greeted you. There will also be two windows. One will have a green mat and one a red mat. Go to the red mat and talk to Pelly. Then say "send mail" and once you do, drag the letter you just wrote into the box that pops up. HOPE I HELPED! happy gaming :)

42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Wired is better...and yes, I know of a few people calling me a hypocrite right now (I use a wireless mouse).    Wireless for an actual internet connection is also impossible to secure...even with encryption. Think about it like your neighbour screaming his name and credit card info at the top of his voice in the middle of a crowd. Even if he's speaking in a language no one in the crowd speaks, does NOT mean that the information is safe! It's the same thing with a wireless router...it is continuously broadcasting it's "name" and password, and the hardware connected wirelessly is also doing the same.     Talk to your folks (if you're a minor) about running a connection down to the living room...and if you offer to pay the guy to do it. ;)    Good Luck!    EDIT: In the case of Blaster's G class router, his signal is "stealable" up to 250 metres away with little lag!|`|SEwqwjPkaa	I'm not 100% familar with the PS network first-hand, however, many of my friends and family are.  From what been told, a wireless gaming connection on the PS network is nearly as unreliable as a wireless connection on XBOX Live (which I use).  That said, we all know that wired connections are much more reliable.  I'd say if you're going to relocate your console from time to time, a wireless connection may do the trick for you.  I mean without it...you can't connect from that room right?  The other option would be to run Cat-5 throughout your home or at the very least, into the room where you may move the console.  I ran cabling to 5 of the rooms in my home and have been very happy with the results.  Having a cat-5 jack in each room is very very convenient and has many applications.    However, consider this as well...if you're not already setup for wireless in your home you'll need to get a wireless router/access point, and then a wireless adpt. for your console.  So, additional expenses may curve your choice.  Up to you I guess.    Hope this helps!    Peace!  The Reverend|`|gYFtQyyQaa	I would go wireless because it is a lot better. And you could use it from any place in your house/apartment. I use a linksys router. It is the wireless-G with speedbooster. It only costs like 40 dollars at walmart.|`|hYa4jH4Saa	wired because the connection is way better but in your case i would go wireless because you will be able to go any where in the house with the wireless
zZ3BmCXoaa	Almost always it means that they lost it in the river.  Talk to the neighbor 2 or 3 times and they should mention that they could have dropped it while swimming or fishing in the river.  After they say this, go fishing in the river.  It may be near their house or really far from it, but it will be in the river and nowhere else.  The key will look like a fish underwater, but when you catch it, it will be a key (like how you can catch a boot or a tire).  It might take a few tries (you might catch some regular fish first) but it should show up.      If you don't get the key back for the neighbor, they'll get back into their house on their own in a few days.    Good luck.

I got a 20$ game for 3 bucks used on amazon.    gamestop- most games will only be 5 dollars difference new/used.    criagslist - find all locals selling items near you, downside is people can be very shifty.

de14HtA9aa	I don't think your too late in playing it online.  It's still very popular if that's what your asking.  Heck the game still sells for 75 euros where I live.  As for it having trophies I think it does have trophies but without ever having played the game on online before and just by going by what I heard others say about the game than there is trophies just not sure what they are is all.|`|raEUval8aa	No, it is not too late, lots of people still play it.    And it does not have trophies.|`|hYa4jH4Saa	no it is not to late because i play it a lot on live and there are people who still dont own the game cod5|`|71tSa5ESaa	It is never to late to play CoD4.

I always play online. kadilicious--look for me!
nJMqX53Naa	Depends on the game. If the game is really popular, or it has multiplayer, someone would have created a trainer or hacking program for it. Google is your friend!|`|ggIQMx4Oaa	Download cheat engine works on every flash game!|`|5f6145c96b6493110059fdfb779a23d4aa	No not unless the programmer for the game added a way to duplicate you money.

Load a save you have before you spoke to Mercator for the first time. Are you playing on the PC or X360?

You can store your saved games, demos, music, and etc on it.     You will be able to access these files on another Xbox 360 if you take out the hard drive from the top of your current system and put it in the other Xbox 360.

nB2CuLIqaa	Yes if your laptop is receiving wireless internet.|`|IX76wkOsaa	yea but u have to set the internet on ur laptop let other devices connect to the internet with it
xVMQx7dtaa	It depends how strong your connection is. When the connection is weak the this is more likely to happen bt when it is strong this is less likely to happen.    This is for when it says in a game, if that what your on about. Just move your ps3 closer to the router if this is the problem.
JoJxR165aa	I doubt it the 720 is coming up in a year or two so they'll probably just wait till the 720 comes out to do anything else to the 360.|`|gbQ9URBJaa	if you are willing to get an arcade(which only comes with a memory card instead of a hard drive), I think you can find one for around $200.  You just have to look around, Future Shop usually has the lowest prices on electronics.
nHNCslRZaa	You have to beat certain objectives in the Franchise for them to unlock. Check the game room/objectives to see what. It's usually like, "Make 7 goals with one player in one game" or something like that.
giuenAt4aa	have him go to gamestop or any video game store, they probably have them.    or you can order one from amazon.com. i absolutely trust that site so if your father cannot find one, try buying one online.|`|zeJGV78gaa	Just have him buy you a Wii. If not, they should be sold in most game stores like Game Stop. Check in the "Used" or "Previously Owned"  section. I don't know if they sell the cords by themselves though.|`|bhObOxP6aa	you can order one on ebay for pretty cheap. This is what I did and it works like new. I would suggest this.|`|AA11035428	Try a GameStop or EB Games store.(Maybe even Funcoland but I think they were bought by GameStop and renamed.) Not sure of the cost. Good luck!

Halos like a cartoon.|`|48HZRYrsaa	I haven't played COD5, but go with that. You can finally play with friends online.|`|AA11192442	It depends if you want realism, or arcade action.     With Halo 3, it takes forever to kill someone with their energy shields, and the ability to jump high in the air. If you want a lot of action, and be able to survive a lot of firefights, this is more for you.    COD5 is realistic, with one hit kills, quick deaths, and a lot of respawning. If you're looking to become a more precise FPS person with more strategy, than COD5.|`|Wd2HKjhUaa	Cod5 has a much longer campaign if that it your primary concern. I also am of the opinion its a better game all the way around, more interesting action, weapons, better game play.|`|b3HZlvknaa	CoD 5 much better community and it's addicting. You get rewards when you level up which I like the most. Plus, if you liked the Call of Duty Series it'll be way much better.

NQ5MYRauaa	Of course it is? Come on, who even listens to game ratings these days... I've been pwning gta since I was like what, 8 years old?|`|h9aNv6PDaa	My personal opinion is that you should be allowed to buy and play the game.|`|vvbhO88maa	I think it's all right my parents would let me. They even let my little brother play it when he was five. I do know some parents don't like letting their kids play those types of games. My sister won't let my nephews play it. She says the game's a bad influence. Bad influence my @ss.|`|OwMcAay7aa	of course. its just a game. but you cant buy it on your own. they dont sell it to minors.|`|UKHytwvoaa	Play in you own room, lock the door, and play. Make sure your mom's out|`|b3HZlvknaa	Well, if you know and are exposed to this stuff well yes you can get it but if you're buying at GameStop  all the games are used so it's not recommended plus retailers like Wal-Mart are better because they have lower prices plus you can just buy it and no questions asked.|`|80MQUUgIaa	u should be able to play when ur bro isnt in the room|`|vWHOyPxRaa	yeah i'm 12 and i play it.If ur smart enough not to copy their actions u should be able to play.|`|ZWiWobaNaa	I don't see a problem as long as you're mature enough to realize that it's just a game and that the majority of the events that happen in GTA are against the law (obviously). I would say that you should not play it when your younger brother is around, and then it would be okay. I would understand your mother's concern because young children are impressionable, and sometimes although they don't always know right from wrong (furthermore, it's a bit too violent for a 9-year-old). But I'd say you should purchase it and just play it when your brother is not around.|`|565dkeVvaa	Yeah.    I mean you are in The "T" rating.|`|DF1y56x7aa	it depends, if your kid is the type that copies everything off of what they see then no,but if you have a somewhat smart kid that knows right from wrong then it should be ok..

0e42679b888b24ee0235f6a4387c3d39aa	I have no idea really. I think it's because he's in an unknown label. He has skills but you need the material to get famous, he doesn't have the connections, sure Wayne, Cassidy and other famous rappers are collabing with him and making very good songs with him, for example a millie and body bags. They still aren't getting those songs on the radio, the a millie version you hear is the Wayne only version mostly. It's just the Way it is unless he blows up and brings himself to fame with a rocket song which would also bring militia his label to fame.      P.S if you want anyother answers other than me I think you should go put this on the music section with a song of his for the people who don't know him, maybe a link from youtube might work. Anyway good luck and trust me the section you put this question in, nobody answers anything this is probably the least active place in all of yahoo.

MuzBXhxnaa	Anti-form drains all of your drive gages no matter what form you pick as a base. If your turning into it a lot use final form a bit to reset the hidden stats for anti.    Also if you enter a tournament like cerberus and exit it right away it will fill your drive gage to max instantly.    Another tip is while your in any of your drive forms, while the gage is dropping, hop on a save point and exit to the world map. This will also max out your drive bar.|`|AAoQzU7oaa	its probably a glitch cause theres not a chance its a normal thing|`|vtJDHJDYaa	If you turn into Anti-Sora, your Drive Gauge will drop to 0 once the form runs out (or you leave the area; unless the new area you're entering is one where Donald and Goofy are walking around).|`|OwMcAay7aa	its normal. its one of the bad qualities that antiform has.|`|EbazBkpgaa	it's normal that happens randomly or when you use a form too many times you only revert back once your drive bar is empty.     an easy way to fill your drive is to go to the underworld tournament. talk to Panic and enter any tournament  once you enter the first battle your drive bar will be completely filled pause  and  quit when you leave your bar is still full

5NLiaNanaa	Well the wii doesn't have many violent games out at the moment and Madworld looks good but Cod5 looks much better if you like shooters (and maybe Nazi Zombies) But Madworld looks more like a beat em up game so it really depends what you like|`|OwMcAay7aa	it looks pretty cool. but go with your own preference. do you like more realistic games (aside from the natzi zombie in cod5) or intense action games?

But nah i dont think it will come out for 360. Sony people are being idiots and already giving you guys killzone 2. Yeah but if they want to mess themselves up they can do that. But i dont think they're gonna let you guys have god of war 3 because of killzone. So i wouldnt really get your hopes up. I thought they would make fable 2 for ps3 but yeah that was a disappointment to me because I bought a ps3 because i would get more for my money.|`|OwMcAay7aa	unfortunately, no. its an exclusive game of sony. people got lucky that Square enix decided to make ff 13 for both consoles (ps3 and 360)

If you want to play Saints Row, for example, then you're not going to want a Wii.|`|ccd5f847fa5b89bb6eab82cc7fdbbf02aa	With its extensive digital media features, a superior online service, and an excellent game library, the Xbox 360 remains the game console to beat.     http://www.reviewcentre.com/review371315...  Price: $197.99|`|n3D7Lccwaa	Do you have friends?  Real Friends, or internet friends?  A: Real Friends. Get the Wii  A: Internet friends. Get the 360  A: No friends. Get the PS3    I'd go for the xbox though, esspecially for Duty. At least hen you can play with your friends. My 2 friends that have PS3 are regreting it because everyone else has 360, and they miss out on all the fun.    Wii is just terrible, unless your old, a girl, or terrible at games.|`|xObWhqePaa	XBOX 360!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|2cvFO3v2aa	xbox 360. it is the best system. and you can get it for the amount of money you have. and if you get the arcade package, you'll probly have enough money left over for a game and more.|`|lX4k5ub4aa	Xbox 360, nintendo DS, Psp, or maybe a wii the best is WII|`|DILfadXCaa	you should get a wii. you get get one for that much.  you could get an Xbox but they break down.

Well here are some fast information:    1. PS3 is too expensive for you since it costs around 260+ and that is with only 1 game included so that wouldn't be any much of a help in my opinion.    2. Xbox360 costs around 125-200 depending which version you are going to get plus the games cost around 30-40 each (i am always talking about the new ones) so you will be able to grab some too :)    3&4. PSP, to tell you the truth since we are comparing the major game consoles i would exclude the PSP and the Nintendo DS lite from the list.    5. Wii costs around 176 includes the sport packages (with around 5 mini games on it) and everything for you to set it up and start playing. On top of that the games cost around (usually no more than) 30 (new ones always). So you will be able to grab some extra games here too!      If you were asking me i would go for the Wii since it is a way new style for everyone and it is fun! For you though that you like Call of Duty i might suggest you to go for the Xbox360 ;)      Hope i helped a bit!|`|soh8C7X7aa	Depends on you style.    PS3: For more Serious gamers who are really into the fps's such (IE. Call of Duty) Downside: WAY too expensive and not as good as it is hyped up to be    Xbox 360 (I own one): I like it better, since my friends come over and we play, and I really find it fun and easy to understand. Downside: P2P Internet    PSP: It is pretty much like a mini PS3    DS Lite: My bro has it, and it kinda sucks.|`|UKHytwvoaa	PSP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

FTjgKbJQaa	The game GTA San Andreas is based on the gangsta rap group, N.W.A.  Eazy-E as Lance "Ryder" Wilson,  Ice Cube as Sean "Sweet" Johnson  MC Ren as Melvin "Big Smoke" Harris   Officer Frank Tenpenny as the 187 undercover cop...  The story of San Andreas is slightly the same as what happened to N.W.A. so to answer your question Grove Street Members are Kelly Park Compton Crips    - Grove Street is pretty much West-side Compton - Kelly Park Compton  I could be wrong but I have a few evidence    I forgot to add - NWA members - Eazy-E, Ice cube, MC Ren are members of the crips|`|DfPyyDssaa	Ballas=Crips  GSF=Bloods.|`|COFPXYvZaa	it really depends on the person's perspective. someone might see GSF as the bloods, someone else might see GSF as the crips, etc etc. rockstar didn't want to explicitly connect the in-game gangs to the real-life gangs (hence the colors green and purple/black instead of red and blue) and wanted the individual player to make their own inferences. no particular answer is correct.

Dso7k3sjaa	Yea, the first person is right.  (Thumbs-up!)  Plus, sometimes the clothing is simply poorly made as well.  It happens.

n3D7Lccwaa	COD. I'm not a big fan of GTA. I rented it, played it for three day's, and was completely fulfilled. In my opinion all GTA is, is a bad third person shooter, and a bad driving game. Just because the 2 are mixed together, doesn't make it good.    COD on the other hand, I have played religiously every chance I get for years!!! I just couldn't imagine playing that much GTA. COD has the best gameplay and replay out there. For a while, every person on my friends list was playing GTA, now, there are NONE. I wonder why? Perhaps because it gets VERY BORING!!!    TheDeal666    The online sux and the 1player is redundant at best.|`|9vS6bUdsaa	GTA 4|`|xObWhqePaa	well if your playing offline you want to get gta4 its more fun ofline but if you play online get cod 5 because the online gameplay is amazing.|`|uYRnGq9Kaa	GTA 4 as a game is pretty cool.  COD 5 online is also really fun and cool.    If you like sandbox games, i advise GTA 4.    But COD 5 is probably best pick if you're going online. However if you're not online in COD5, then GTA 4 is better.|`|I3muPKNwaa	That depends what kind of gameplay are you looking for I have both COD5 is FPS and the online  (especially for somebody as bad at FPS games as me) can be frustrating but the campaign is good. GTA is fun but the missions can be repetitvie like those god damn chase missions but they're both good games. My opinion if you want a good Free Roam RPG-type shooter get GTA and if you want a good just plain FPS get COD|`|sezT4kCkaa	COD 5 is a horrible game just some cheap knock off of Modern Warfare. If you want to buy a COD game just wait until Infinity Ward makes their next COD|`|mubKp51Iaa	Call of Duty it has a better online then gta has and has a better story than gta
KJY5pU8Waa	go to www.cheatplanet.com it will show u any cheat codes if there is any on any game
rC0h264Taa	Vice City is actually better in my opinion.   Here I have my reasons:  1. You can escape from missions in Vice City  2. There are cooler cars  3. GTA Vice City is simply better than Liberty City...|`|AA10911952	I think Vice City Stories is better as it is closer (tech wise) to San Andreas, whereas Liberty City Stories feels like an expansion pack.    If you're talking about the PS2 versions there is no multiplayer options    The PSP versions both have ad-hoc multiplayer, but no online multiplayer.|`|UKHytwvoaa	I prefer liberty city stories because it's newer and the world is bigger than vice city.|`|u8hRANujaa	I genuinely prefer liberty city stories but most magazines and web-sites out there claim vice-city stories. I've played both and found liberty city stories to be more enjoyable and slightly easier whereas vice-city stories is much more of a challenge although a slightly better plot. Graphics/ loading times are the same really so either one you get you can't go wrong. You cant go online on either. My vote goes to the L.C.S though

Ks84gB0waa	Yes you will. They have a completely different storyline.   Personally, I thought that in Tomb Raider Legend the puzzles were a bit too easy, but the whole platforming bit was much better. I also find the overall game difficulty of Underworld harder, with more challenging puzzles and combat. The combat in Underworld probably isn't as good as Legend though. Overall I'd probably say that Legend is a better game than Underworld, but it's a bit short. Considering Legend is older than Underworld though, that would mean it's cheaper, so by this point it's probably well worth the choice. If I were you, I'd by Tomb Raider Legend.|`|lEdW7RANaa	that is how its supposed to go tomb raider legend and then tomb raider underworld    legend is about finding her mom  underworld is actually finding her

dvkWQvfDaa	Counter Strike 1.6 is the most online played shooter.    A shooter I really enjoy is S4 League. It is a third person shooter (like gears of war), but mixed with RPG features. You get online and play with friends or anyone you find online (there are lots of people online). So you get lots of frags, earn experience and level up, earn money, buy more weapons, buy new skills, new clothing, become able to use new levels and fight new enemies, among other stuff. They are also working on an Arcade mode, so you'll be able to play against Bosses, alone or with friends.    My favorite game EVER is chrono trigger. seriously, it's a masterpiece. however i don't think there's a PC version of it. there's a DS version, PSX version and SNES version. you can always get a snes rom, though. it's only 10 mb and it's the greatest game ever.    The game I'm currently playing is Gears of War (for PC), and I'm looking forward to buy Mirror's Edge.|`|3kyJzANIaa	go torrent fallout 3 OR play this    http://www.rasterwerks.com/    its an online shooter where you can play online with people on your browser but these are all beta tests but wait for the full version to come out.

I selected "No" and it started a new game of GTA IV instead.<br>  <br>  I'm not 100% sure what will happen if you want to go back to an old save, but when I first started the game after downloading the DLC, it brought me back to my last auto-save (from May) and I was able to load other saves from there.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps. Even I think it's a little confusing...

The demon's real easy.|`|O68trVREaa	Train until you're a level 50, I really recommend training your prayer to at least the level where you can use protect from melee and training until you're at least a level 55. Use the anti-dragon shield instead of the rune sq shield as the anti-dragon shield will protect you from the dragon's breath (that can hit 65!).    The dark wizard is 43 and the demon & dragon are 82 and 83. The dark wizard is easy to beat, the demon and the dragon are a lot harder.|`|gYX3MqZzaa	Ever heard of the anti dragon shield? get it, grab a bunch of cooked swordies, and you'll be fine.  oops!

h9aNv6PDaa	I really don't think there is an answer to that at this moment
yR74PnPTaa	Well in all honesty everything is about how you use it, you can have the strongest cards there are, use them wrong and you'll never win against anyone worth playing.  The answers above me listed some of the obvious answers (Exodia, 5GD, etc.) but again it's all about use.<br>  <br>  Also for clarification purposes Victory Dragon doesn't reduce life points to 0 upon a life point attack, if you are dueling in a tournament and Victory Dragon makes the attack that sends your opponent to 0 lifepoints you win the match (which is a set of duels) as opposed to just the duel.<br>  <br>  There are many monsters with this effect [also known as "Match Winners"] but Victory Dragon is the only one legal in tournament play, however it's effect is virtually useless as a player can surrender at any time [Say just before it reduces you to 0] and lose only the duel, not the match.|`|QK50ERDJaa	The answer to this question can be answered in two parts. First off, the most powerful monster CARDS is the entire set of Exodia. it consists of 5 sepearte cards, gather them all into your hand and you automatically win the duel. The second answer to this question is very simple. There is no other strongest monster. Every other monster in this game is easy prey to any type of counter attack. But if i would say any specific creature, it would have to be Uria, lord of searing flames. Because all you have to do is get enough continuous trap cards in your graveyard (4 or more) and you have one of the most powerful cards in your deck in the entire game! Sure he's basically a rip-off of the Egyptian god card Slifer the Sky Dragon ( Real name is Osiris the Heaven Dragon), but still. if you get ten continuous traps in your graveyard, THATS OVER TEN THOUSAND ATTACK POINTS! So thats all for today. Uria and Exodia are among the strongest monsters in the entire game of Duel Monsters. Hands down.|`|wr5upsNKaa	well in my pick its Victory Dragon cause if attacks your life points directly it sends them to 0|`|wr9lPEtVaa	It depends.<br>  <br>  Competitively - (Advanced Format) I would say Judgement Dragon.<br>  Attack Wise - Five-Headed Dragon<br>  <br>  But my favourite/powerfullest card is Red Dragon Archfiend.
e6YcsNQCaa	... Not a very good team.. they should be at least level like 70.... I think... I dont really like that 5 year old's game anymore.... Mine were like lvl 100, and i got through it like 6 times with no rest stops...|`|AlK42wXDaa	You should level all of your pokemon to lv50. then, evolve your sneezal by giving it some kind of claw, then level it up at night.if your 'hippo' is a hipopotas, then evolve it by leveling up. You should get rid of mesprit 'cause it's not very good and replace it with a misdreavus found in the pokemon tower at night. then evolve it into a mismagius by a dusk stone Mismagius and roserade have excelent stats, but I think you've evolve your roserade to early. You should have wait till lv50 when it learns aromatherapy|`|Dc8ZVP6yaa	Well First off i would suggest getting your starter.  And putting it in your party as starters level up faster and usually have stronger attacks. And learn some of the types that are strong against other attack example.  Fire Stronger than Grass  Water Stronger than Fire  Grass Stronger than Water  Water Stronger than Rock etc.   Hope i Have helped :)|`|UWdanSdraa	Level up all of them from 50-60!   :OO  1. Staraptor  2. Your starter? It's always a good choice.  3. Sneasal  4. Roserade  5. Gastrodon   6. Palkia     Remember to get some Revives, Hyper Potions, Super Potions etc.

i7ZArzliaa	A good way I use to see a lot of different combos for any Tekken character is watching Youtube.  Seriously, what better way than to learn from players around the world and mix in with your own style?    Also, I suggest you to take a look at the Tekken Zaibatsu forum and searchable database (see link in the source below). It is one of the best online resources in English and covers anything Tekken related. I would recommend looking in each of the character forums; there are hundreds of juggles and strategies (offense/defense) for all the characters.    Anyway, hope this helps! Happy gaming!  (??)    Cheers,  Chris.

Amazing graphics, brilliant gameplay, and, in my opinion, great controls.  Sure, it's sluggish compared to call of duty, but the guys carrying round armor, ammo, grenades and a massive gun; of course he's gonna move slowly.  It wouldn't be realistic if he could do a 360 degree turn in half a second, he's lugging all of his equipment around.  The run mechanism is also brilliant, it adds a feel of urgency and makes you feel that you can get out of trouble if you need to.  It's annoying if you can't sprint in a game (halo 3), it should be implemented into every fps.<br>  <br>  It will be the best game ever made.|`|HS8lX9Wxaa	<a href="http://nobsgamers.com/news/killzone-2-first-impressions/" rel="nofollow">http://nobsgamers.com/news/killzone-2-fi...</a>
f0egZ7Sdaa	The developers can really do whatever they want with a game. When a game is sent to the "Ratings Board", they (the ratings board) are not aware of cheat codes, thus giving it the "E" rating.    If you have proof of these cheat codes (ie: some kind of on-line document), I would take your proof and write a letter/email to the developers of Dogz Pack and Catz Clan.

Have you caught Cresselia?<br>  If not give yourself the aim to catch them all!<br>  You can also trade pokemon world wide in Jubilife city,<br>  Battle against others registered friends,<br>  Hand around in the underground and what i do <br>  is put the pokemon I get on Pokemon Battle Revolution so I <br>  can battle against loads of people on the game and through Wi-Fi.<br>  Always look out for more games because they can expand you original!<br>  Hope this helps!|`|59AZ4GKVaa	Hello fellow Pokemon trainer, here I am to resolve your question & hopefully get my points in return. After you caught Giratina, go out & search for the rest of the missing Pokemon that you don't have. If you do finish your Pokedex, then go play in the Casino for a few coins. Or you could go into the UnderGround for some rare items like Secret Base accesories or Dolls. Or if you really like to, which it's up to you, you could get ready for Platinum by catching some Pokemon & saving them & then trade them once you get Platinum (optional). Well, hope this helps you on your quest. Good luck & good bye !!

5ec6e061a24d9c036d2640ab0485b48baa	There are lessons, tips, links to examples, etc. for making fruit canes (from polymer clay) on this page at my polymer clay "encyclopedia":  http://glassattic.com/polymer/miniatures...  ...this page also has miniature 3D foods, including fruits, but I've put the fruit "canes" here too...click on FRUITS, under "Foods" but notice which are canes and which are 3-dimensional    These pages have much more info/lessons/etc though on making all kinds of canes from polymer clay, as well as just the basics of how to do things like make the canes smaller ("reduce" them), slice them evenly, etc.:    http://glassattic.com/polymer/canes--ins...  ...If you want to make canes of *other* fruits, you can either use the same kinds of kaleidoscopic symmetry techniques as used for most citrus/etc. canes (click on the TRIANGULAR, KALEIDOSCOPE category near the middle of the list on that page)... or you can make canes with images of the *exterior* of the fruits/foods/anything by checking out the "PICTURE" canes (near the bottom of the list), though many of those aren't as easy for beginners.    http://glassattic.com/polymer/canes--red...   http://glassattic.com/polymer/faces_cane...  and maybe:  http://glassattic.com/polymer/canes-what...      Re using polymer clay canes on fingernails though, do keep in mind that polymer clay is oil-based not water-based, so it can eat into some other kinds of plastic over time (if the clay is raw, or if it hasn't been totally-thoughly cured).  So anything *directly* touching polymer clay (like fingernails, false fingernails, or clear finishes) should not be petroleum-scolvent based (i.e., clean up with paint thinner) or be certain kinds of stiff plastic.   The clear fingernail polish intended for use on fake fingernails is fine as are other water-based things such as polyurethanes, acrylic mediums, etc.    Fake fingernails themselves are plastic so it might be good to paint them first with that specific fingernail polish to seal them from the clay since I'm not sure exactly which type of plastic they are.    Also, if you want to place the cane slices on the fingernails after they're already cured, you might want to bake them on a slightly curved surface so that they'll have a slight curve and fit better (a slightly curved piece of paper or cardstock or even a glass jar, etc....remove after cooling).    Here are some other pages at my site that you might want to check out for doing this kind of polymer clay thing in particular:  ...clear finishes (okay ones, and not okay ones)  http://glassattic.com/polymer/finishes.h...  ........you won't be completely "covering" anything with clay, but the principles would still apply for the various materials that come in contact with polymer clay  http://glassattic.com/polymer/covering.h...   http://glassattic.com/polymer/storage.ht...    HTH,    Diane B.|`|2bc760aca1235845cc56ee2f6d0c17d5aa	You might find info here       http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php...    cane tutorials here       http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php...|`|Dq4VswJ6aa	Idk, but the nails are pretty cool!

2fbde007751b53153f91de150f61ac5caa	You can begin anywhere because each Final Fantasy is it's own game.      Actually there are almost 30 Final Fantasy games, but there are only 13 main games, there rest are mostly spin-offs.      The only games that actually have a continuing story are Final Fantasy games that have the same number in the title (such as Final Fantasy VII and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII).    Aside from the few games like that, most of them have nothing to do with one another.      As for the movie (Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children), it's a sequel to the game Final Fantasy VII.|`|BEe6jwNXaa	I haven't played any of the games beyond 8, but to the best of my knowledge none of them are directly related to a previous one in the series.  They typically have similar themes but it shouldn't be a necessity to have played any of the others in order to play FF13.  However, it might be a little difficult getting into it if you've never played a role playing game, but everyone has to start somewhere.    I don't think the movie doesn't fit into any of the games directly.  It just has the type of story line that you would see in the games.    Have fun!|`|QmrXzP5daa	.

Fishing is a good way, too. Fish lobsters and sell them.     If you are a member:    Search Google for some type of runescape money-making guide.|`|9ocKwWvFaa	Stop playing runescape. I promise. Trust me, this happens all the time: One bad thing happens to you (E. G. you die, you get temporarily banned) and you see all the bad things about it.

They barely have 5 million at best. The very best.     I suppose to answer your question, however, go buy gold.

f0egZ7Sdaa	The Wii is geared more towards the casual gamer. Modern Warfare 2 is more on the "hard-core" side and not the audience that Nintendo is wanting to reach.|`|dvkWQvfDaa	Wii has some awesome games, just it is being treated as a children's console.    Watch trailers/videos for the following:    Disaster: Day of Crisis (easily the best survival/adventure wii game)  Monster Hunter 3 (great game, soon to be launched)  Oneechanbara Revolution  Sengoku Basara 2 Heroes  Fire Emblem (the wii one, not sure what it's called)  Super Smash Bros Brawl (you GOTTA have heard about this game)  Dead Rising: Chop Til You Drop  Mad World  No More Heroes (I heard they're making NMH2)  Zelda: Twilight Princess  Dokapon Kingdom (you may not like it at first, but it's the best party game for the wii)    I got a list of at least 40 wii games that i MUST buy, just I don't have it yet. Basically most great wii games are japanese, and may take a while before they are launched on Europe and The Americas. I must say, though, 2009 is a great year for the wii. Many great games coming out.          "u cant really make any good games for it when it has bad graphics"  ^go back to your cave, casual gamer!  seriously, I would rather play Chrono Trigger than another crappy Halo game. It is not graphics that make a game, but gameplay and storyline: something that most of today's games lack.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    Please, check this site. It includes a detailed review on why the Wii is such a great console. Don't listen to those fanboys/casual players that believe graphics make good games.|`|OwMcAay7aa	idk. nintendo is focusing on family games right now. who knows, maybe they'll make some good games this year.|`|NrUbnJ21aa	u cant really make any good games for it when it has bad graphics
42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	Presumably it's a game?<br>  <br>  In which case...probably, yes. If it was released prior to 2003, you may have to install extra patches and such to make it able to do so.<br>  <br>  That being said...just because it is patched doesn't mean it will run. Your hardware could be too advanced for the program.

Uc7BNCxRaa	The method depends upon the hardware and operating system you are using.  Here is some general information.    PC Users    PC client users can safely back up macro files while not logged on to the character. (The files seemed to be saved from memory to files when zoning and when logging off, and perhaps at other times.) The default location for files containing the macros for PC clients is at:    C:\Program Files\PlayOnline\SquareEnix\FINAL FANTASY XI\USER\{ID}\mcr*.dat    NOTE:  You can also backup the other files in the user directory and save your sort order for the AH and your MH (as an example).    PS2 Users    PS2 users can use PlayOnline storage in their PS2 browser to store up to 4 sets of 20 book macros each (Slot A, Slot B, Slot C, Slot D), each slot is marked with the name of the character, date the macro set was saved to storage, and the time it was saved to storage. They can be switched at the Character Select screen when logging on.    To save or restore macros in this way (stored on the PS2), follow the instructions above for saving/restoring from the PlayOnline servers but choose one of the slots on your PS2 when prompted. Macros are stored on the PS2 and can not be loaded from another console.    NEW METHOD:  Saving the macro to the server / also allows for transferring macros between machines (even different hardware).    SE recently allowed players to store configuration data on FFXI servers, in addition to your game machine's own hard disk drive. Up to four slots are available on your hard disk for this purpose, while one slot is available on the server. One slot stores one character's worth of configuration data.    At the character selection screen, highlight a character and press the following buttons/keys and choose the slot in which you want to save the configuration information for the highlighted character.        PlayStation 2: L1 button + L3 button       XBOX 360: LB + left stick button       PC/Keyboard: Shift + Alt + Ctrl + B     Loading Macros from the Server    Bring up the configuration file load screen by pressing the following buttons/keys at the character selection screen, and choose the slot from which you wish to load.        PlayStation 2: R1 button + R3 button       XBOX 360: RB + right stick button       PC/Keyboard: Shift + Alt + Ctrl + R     Deleting Macros from the Server    Bring up the configuration file deletion screen by pressing the following buttons/keys at the character selection screen. Confirm deletion to restore default settings for the currently highlighted character.        PlayStation 2: R1 button + L2 button + R3 button + L3 button       XBOX 360: R2 + L2 + right stick button + left stick button       PC/Keyboard: Shift + Alt + Ctrl + D

sPJdAw8Uaa	Well it depends, are you looking for a computer game or console game.    If you want a computer game, i suggest that you go with the Sims or Roller Coaster Tycoon. Ive heard that games like Runescape and WoW are okay but that depends on if you like that kind of games.    For consoles i would say halo3 for xbox 360 and all the mario games on the wii.    Hope this helps :)

Something like this:<br>  <br>  When you were 16 (however old she is now):<br>  Your favorite snack was: Oreos<br>  Favorite drink: Milk<br>  Favorite color: Red<br>  Your favorite sheets/comforter/blanket, for your bed were:<br>  You had a crush on:<br>  Best vacation:<br>  Favorite place to go with my friends:<br>  <br>  You get the idea...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|gx3TOrdeaa	<a href="http://gettinginfo.us.to" rel="nofollow">http://gettinginfo.us.to</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|GlaARFZcaa	Check out this website - there are tons of great scrapbook ideas that are all free including some really creative layout ideas.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.favecrafts.com/Scrapbooking" rel="nofollow">http://www.favecrafts.com/Scrapbooking</a>
QEkznIewaa	4hours+6hours=10hours. 10hours divided by 2=5hours. 5hours divided by 2people=2 1/2 hours. All you have to do is take an average of Sally's and John's working times and divide it by 2 because the 2 of them would be working on the house tog. The answer is 2 1/2 hours.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	4hrs, Sally can do it faster so John's off down the pub. <br>  <br>  1/4+1/6=1/time     in reality if they work together.|`|154dzJ1Faa	you need to do your own math homework and not ask us here.|`|wGEYqauWaa	That's a trick question.  Everyone knows that tog (who, inexplicably, refuses to capitalize the first letter of his name) is allergic to house paint and therefore never paints houses.  Also, if Sally and then John painted the house, why would it need yet another coat of paint?  That just doesn't make any sense.<br>  <br>  I think they should spring for siding and then they'd never have to paint the house again.  That's really the most sensible way to go.|`|gDuDNeRcaa	in reality, it depends on how many breaks they have...how long their breaks are. is it a nice hot sunny day while they're doing this? because then they might wanna throw back some ice cold beers while doing this project...which can cause them to take much longer. and how many times are they gonna paint this fricken house anyway?! shes already painted it once, and he's already painted it once..geesh.|`|IdtzdpqGaa	you have to ask the contractor since they will pay him to paint the house.|`|Yql4JTKPaa	whats a tog?|`|RqEauWlOaa	Well, assuming that "tog" means together, Sally is 2 hours faster than John, and together it would be 5 hours. You cut each time in half because there are two people, and you add them to see the total. <br>  <br>  answer above is, i believe, correct.<br>  <br>  Why would the same house need to be painted twice? :P<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10032861	3hour 9 minutes 33 (or so) seconds|`|9b0a04d9a5a6e39d0997d773f7b49e09aa	obviously sally isnt doing a proper job, she is rushing, so get rid of her and let john do it alone
1T35X8dEaa	Visage Drops are Very very very rare <br>  <br>  Several dragons are known to drop the visage<br>  <br>  KBD (in wild near Lava maze)<br>  Black dragons (lava maze, taverly dungeon, Evil Chicken Lair)<br>  <br>  Metal dragons are also known to drop the visage<br>  Iron, steel dragons are located in Brimhaven dungeon<br>  <br>  <br>  Also Skeletal Wyverns drop visage located in the Asgarnian Ice Caves <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  bronze and iron dragons DO NOT drop visage<br>  <br>  Now remember it is a rare drop, but anything is possible.

AA11850311	those 2 games will work together.  Are you putting in the Pets disk and clicking on the Pets icon?  That should start the game playing.
XrGFZ2LJaa	Ok, first of all, there are a lot of sources on the internet that are merely rumours. If you want true clarification or information about Rome: Total War being available for the Mac, visit the authentic webpage designed by the developers, Creative Assembly. <a href="http://www.totalwar.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.totalwar.com.</a> Only there can you get the official details. Don't even listen to other sites.<br>  <br>  Secondly, there's been no evidence at all to suggest Empire: Total War will be introduced to the Mac. The publishers of Empire: Total War, SEGA, have mentioned nothing whatsoever and their "search for a game" database clearly displays "PC" only. <a href="http://www.sega-australia.com/games/?g=238&t=Australian" rel="nofollow">http://www.sega-australia.com/games/?g=2...</a><br>  <br>  Thirdly and finally, if we assume Rome: Total War is coming out for the Mac (which I doubt it is), it's taken 7 years to do so. In comparison, you might be waiting until 2016 for Empire: Total War to be released on the Mac.
fpGroPpzaa	You will get the next one, in the next two to three weeks. They usually come after the first week of the month.
R7mriGWkaa	i think its like you do shift ctnrl c or somethin and then a  line pops out and you type FamilyFunds.........................i think..!
OcImKw3Yaa	Dang, you should have got nx just a little bit earlier.  PACs were only around 1.4k nx each and sell for 8 mil, now that the event is over it's a little more expensive.  Go with 60% glove att scrolls for around 1.5k nx and sell them at 5 mil each.
i8rnA65Faa	No. If you enert it and take it back after you have installed it to the harddrive it will not work.<br>  <br>  This is because microsoft have made it so it needs the disc in the drive to start it up (for verification issues so none can get a free game)|`|vrBVvAQmaa	Yes, this should work, but i'm not 100% certain
BcamNpPIaa	Only have 2<br>  <br>  2-11   2,7,8,9,10<br>  2-17   2,3,7,8,9
Dso7k3sjaa	Yes, you can find it here:    http://www.simbology.com/smf/    Before you get it there are a few threads that you should read so you make sure you get the correct version that's made to work with the games you have installed and so you know what the 'flavor paks' are that you can add to go along with the hack.    So, I recommend reading this thread first:    http://www.simbology.com/smf/index.php/t...    Basically, it explains that the stuff packs can change the game coding, so if you have say, The Sims 2 Double Deluxe but nothing else, then even though the latest released ep is Nightlife, because you have Celebrations also, then you need the version made to work with OFB.  That's why I tell people to read that thread.    Then, after you are sure which version you need to download, then you should read this thread next.  It has three posts on it and the first and second posts are the most important to read.  Especially the second post which talks about the 'flavor paks' because it explains that some of the 'flavor paks' are not compatible with other ones.  So you will have to choose which ones you want to use (if any) and then make sure they do not conflict with each other before you put them into your game.  Otherwise, it can mess things up.  Okay, here's the thread I'm talking about:    http://www.simbology.com/smf/index.php/t...    Oh, and if you do decide that you want to add one or more of the 'flavor paks' and you download the file that says it has them for the version you want, make sure you put it on your desktop and open it before you put it into your game because ALL of the 'flavor paks' are in that one download.  So, you need to open it and delete the ones that you are not going to use and then move it into your downloads folder.    Now here is the actual link to get the hack and the 'flavor pak' that goes with it:    http://www.simbology.com/mods/index.php?...    One more thing.  In case you don't know how to open zip folders and where to put them after you get them open, then you can read this link to learn:    http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...|`|d0526f170117e8427de48cedf6a58cfbaa	You could always try the new sims site.  It looks like it covers sims 1, sims 2 & sims 3 although it does look fairly new
ZHhi8vSjaa	you need a wireless connection and for your code go to the heart then the key at the bottom of the screen

hw2WqNtdaa	final fantasy XI|`|h9aNv6PDaa	Well, to mention a few;  Age of Conan  The Lord of the Rings: Online  Warhammer Online : Age of Reckoning    You may also find some interesting free MMORPGs at:  http://www.onrpg.com/MMO/Free-MMORPG|`|dvkWQvfDaa	S4 League (it is a third-person shooter, but you gain new weapons, money, skills and stuff just like in a mmorpg, and you gain experience and level up by killing others). The English version of this is still being developed, but you can play it on team deathmatch and capture the flag (touchdown) mode. they will be releasing story/arcade mode soon, plus new weapons and levels.    Ragnarok Online (pretty much my favorite mmorpg ever. anime-style animations/characters and lots of classes to choose from, plus lots of customization options).|`|PbESq4Cyaa	Outside.|`|vRImZ32Maa	Guild Wars, Age of Conan (In my opinion don't get Age of Conan)   Everquest.|`|ba3adde12f054008eb9115531e07a39eaa	runescape|`|4L5ZIT5paa	Everquest 2|`|5f9hg9craa	Guild Wars. You only pay for the game and you have it for life. Basically, you have to have skills to play the game if you don't, don't play it at all. It is also a good movie when you play out the missions.|`|yCjTBYAEaa	Lucas Arts is launching a new mmorpg called Star Wars: The Old Republic.  I don't know the release date, though.|`|ZlcYSRviaa	Warhammer. the pvp is awesome, even for lvl 1s!|`|W5bH7DGyaa	there is one other that i know of. its called runescape. its probably not as good as WoW but its like the same style.|`|jc8GEmOEaa	Have you heard of runescape? Its fun and just like wow but less good grafects. If its a bad community runescape has a report abuse button, and has security for your game bank.    Try it! But if you want ot go to different palces and get more things on it the you would get members and only have to pay $5 a month.    If I were you lvl up your guy first and then get members!  Hope I helped!|`|OwMcAay7aa	depends, free or purchase-able. if free, go here.  http://www.freemmogamer.com/2008/09/best...  shows you the best free mmorpg. if you dont want a free mmorpg then i have no idea. the only game i bought and that is online is Left 4 Dead.|`|565dkeVvaa	Fusionfall.com|`|OsbbyOJBaa	Everquest|`|P2HDZDHgaa	If you like PVP and Open PVP Warhammer is the way to go. I love there ORVR system.     Theres tons of quest to do if you don't want to PVP. But PVPing from lvl 1 all the way up to 40 is definately a worthwhile option. You gain XP from killing other players and doing the scenarios in the game.    Theres tons of classes and they're broken down to two armies. Order and Destruction.    And on my server the community is great.     But bottom line is what kind of MMO are you looking for? :)
2FiUJtj0aa	If you kill Derrick:    - Francis gives you the perk to evade any wanted level you have if you call him.    If you kill Francis:    - Derrick gives you two (2) more missions if decide to kill Francis. These will also count to completing Francis's 100% mission completion in your stats.|`|s5Oa83sYaa	i killed francis  but you get nothing from him
SkpRC2Nmaa	Check if the site bellow helps you    www.gmodservers.com
uXLDyIXmaa	instead of asking here why don't you just go and check! you will have to go anyway.    and yes,i presume they would be stocking such a large selling game.    its great!!!
28v01QBZaa	You should occasionally, as his love meter will go down incrementally over time.  You won't have to give him something every day like you probably are now though :)  Hope this helps!|`|EVjoCpjEaa	You don't HAVE to.. but if you completely ignore him, his dialogue will change and he'll be unhappy.    If you want to get pregnant though, you MUST keep his heart red for a whole season after marriage.|`|RSi9sLhGaa	Not really love points don't change if you don't litter of kill an animal how ever don't try to ignore him or he will move out and do give him gift some times so his friendship points wont drop.
47SIvMjlaa	I will buy them from you for $7.00 each, been looking for some of these games.  If you dont mind id like to buy   Goldeneye Rogue Agent  and the 3 hitmans  X2:Wolverine's Revenge|`|4b00d9a31d6a0bab2ccf1a1493eca11faa	OOOOOHHHHHHHHH, the some other games will fetch big money.  Big, big money.  I would barter with them.|`|OwMcAay7aa	they would give you very little for each. $5-$10 for each.|`|BMxTXMLraa	they gave me 2$ for the same games xD|`|dA0mJPryaa	2 or 3 apiece. those stores gyp u. :(|`|LVbF00iAaa	those r really old. u prob wont get any more than 50 bucks total|`|o3oRKKJ7aa	Probably $2 each max. If anything i would sell them at a garage sale. EB games/gamestop gives you no money what so ever.
AA10169442	No, unless you want to play old games from the 90's, that's not enough.
47SIvMjlaa	You just buy a [Scarecrow for pests] and set it up in your garden
teVegMHkaa	ju$t drive it there!!  simple..............
47SIvMjlaa	You do not have to buy it.  They are all related but not the same story line.  My personal Favorite is Final Fantasy Tactics Advanced.    I just got it online for free.  1st you must download the program that plays the game  which is right here.  http://www.emulator-zone.com/doc.php/gba...  (scroll to the bottom of the page to download it)[download the 1.8.0 beta 3]  and now you need the game:  http://www.animedownloadz.com/downloads4...    download these and you save yourself $10.  Once you download the 1st one, extract the files from it.  Than open the Visual boy advanced beta and than go to   file  open  and now find the 2nd thing you downloaded  and open that file.    Now you have the game!
XiZWW4Fqaa	I'd recommend going to the Hastings closest to you and buying their CD Scratch remover of CD Skip Fixer. Both are relatively inexpensive, and will last you for years. Both have worked well on any games that had scratches and wouldn't run.|`|uVUN4xT8aa	windex
47SIvMjlaa	there is a button at the bottom  a zoom option button|`|O5OVMi3caa	hold down space bar and use the mouse wheel.
FgEtzCqFaa	After the scenes, find Flounder easily by locking onto things. After the  tutorial, the search, the fight and the scene, you have to find to King  Palace.    Go to the Undersea Valley. Follow the Trident markers and you will end  up at a place called Calm Depths. Hold down right on the analog to get  to the Undersea Cave. Go up to the Undersea Gorge. Then you will finally  see a whole that says "Triton's Palace". Go straight to Triton's Throne.    After the scene, go to the Undersea Gorge and Ariel will show you her  Grotto. Go to it to trigger a cutscene. Leave and hear of Ursula's  Genious plan. Go to Undersea Cave, and then get to Calm Depths. Notice  the dolphin. Get sucked into the Undersea Valley, and gra onto the  dolphin. He'll take you to a sunken ship. Go into the ship and a shark  will attack you ::has a Deep Blue Sea flashback::. I hate sharks, guys,  they are spooky.    Go to the outside of the ship and you can fight the shark. Go back out  to Undersea Gorge. Hit the jet and you will smash up the treasure chest.  Now, go into Ariel's Grotto, about 5 feet away. Go to the Trident.    After the scene, go to King Triton's palace. Go to his Throne. After the  scene, you will see that Ursula now has his Trident. There's a save  point behind his throne inside of a clam. Go to the Undersea Gorge.  Beside Ariel's Groto is the hole you popped out of. Go down in that  hole. Then go to Sunken Ship. Examine part of the boat outside of the  big ship, and Sebastian will get to see the enterance of Ursula's Lair.  Go to the place marked DEN OF TIDES in the Sunken Ship Area.    Go to Cavern Nook if you need to save. A Save point is inside a clam.  Note, you should get you items ready, and use a tent, because this is  where the boss's start to get hard in the game, so to speak. Now leave  and go to the place called  Tidal Abyssys. Then after you fight, go to Ursula's Lair to fight...    |Ursula Form 1|  EXP - 1000  Tech Points - N/A  Form 1 isn't very hard. You do not need to hit her at all at first. At  the bottom, the cauldron is reacting and doing all sorts of things. For  example, if the pot is...    Red - Use Blizzard on the cauldron  Blue - Use Fire on the Cauldron    Repeat this process a few times, and it will stun Ursula. Then, you  should go and hit her. Repeat this process 3 or 4 times to kill her.  To regain MP, you need to fight the Eels. Sometimes, yellow sparks come  out of the cauldron, and she will sometimes make the cauldron do a wind  attack that can be easily avoided if you stay away from the cauldron.  They recover soon after you kill her.    Then, go to Tidal Abyssys, and then go to Den of Tides. Go from here to  Sunken Ship, and then go from Sunken Ship to Calm Depths. Swim up the  Current with Mermaid Kick. Now you will go to an area called ???, and  fight...    |Ursula Form 2|  EXP - NOT SURE  Tech Points - NOT SURE  Ursula is huge, hard, and really ugly. Keep on the move constantly for  the lightning, and don't get in front of her face or she will bite you.  This takes off a LOT of energy. I found it easy to sneak behind her neck  and whack her from there. But, she will eventually turn around, and she  will sometimes use a attack and she will suck you into her mouth. Use  Mermaid kick to get out of the suction waves. Just be patient and kill  her. She will also yell, "Now I'm angry. Time to teach you some  respect!" when she says this get away from her as FAR AS YOU CAN. You  may notice it is very hard to get behind her neck with mermaid kick, and  taking it off will make her easier.      After you beat her, you will go to the palace, and Triton will tell you  that the keyhole is in Ariel's Grotto. Go there to complete Atlantica.  Then you will get the crab claw and your on your way to...
R73aJ9qtaa	1. Leveling is much faster, and even quick if you do recruit a friend.  You level 2-3 times running and instance.  You can also grant levels to whoever recruited you as well as summon them every hr.    2. Gold is easy to get, especially if you go with gathering professions (Skinning/Mining/Herbalism and such).    3. Wait until you are at least 68 (this is the level you can start questing in WOTLK areas).    4. It is more fun, because the end game stuff is 10 man able, and the heroics are also not as much of a pain to do.  As well as       BONUS: If you want to skip leveling from 1-55 and already have at least one level 55, but don't like that class;  Then just create a DK as they are WAY op, and if specced can solo anything.|`|yuF2K1rLaa	play runescape  end of story.|`|AA11402799	1) They lowered the EXP from 1-60. should take no times  2) i had about 500g at 70 and when i finished questing and hit 80 i have about 4890. so no gold is easy to get.  3)Only bad part about not having WOtLK is when you see a DK or something from WOtLK its shows up as a little box to your. so you dont really NEED it.  4)I played wow for 4years and i got bored of it, then WAR came out and i played WAR for a month and went back to wow and sence LK came out it has gotten a lot more fun.  4.1) I love doing the new endgame, NAXX is more fun than it was pre-bc. i havent really done any pvp, but the instances r fun also|`|bF57L1jQaa	1) It will still take quite some time. However recent patches have increased quest exp so leveling is faster than it used to be. On top of that I recommend you try the RAF (Recruit a Friend) option. Basically you and your recruited friend (or he can recruit you) will get 3x the experience if you play together. This can make 1-60 extremely fast.    2) Gold is still a pain to get. Nothing has changed if you really think about it. Everything drops more gold now but everything costs more as well. It's about as same as before except that the economy is inflated so it may look daunting at first to think about getting 10,000 gold but it's really no different then it used to be 2 years ago.    3) I would definitely recommend waiting until you hit the late 60's or 70 to buy WOTLK. As you said you might stop playing by then so why waste the money?    4) The game is as fun as it used to be but it really all depends on you. If you've enjoyed the content before you'll probably enjoy the new content as well.    5) End game is the same old stuff you've seen.
G13qFTa1aa	Just go to setting and then to network setting and follow steps depending on your connection type if you have trouble connection then go to system under settings and go to restore default settings then you can set it up from there|`|2x41IPGcaa	plug and play|`|32dPb4rPaa	all you nead is wierless internet|`|te20MS4haa	Just follow the instructions on the screen I am a technophobe and I managed to set ours up!

XiZWW4Fqaa	You need to first talk to Moriarty in Megaton to get the map marker. If you don't want to pay him, hack his computer for the info. If you can't hack the computer, his password should be in the drawers right next to the terminal. Once you've done that, you should get a map marker. You need to follow that map marker very closely, as the only way to get the GNR building is through the subway. There are also signs along the way to help you. Also, you may want to stock up on weapons and get some experience fighting enemies before. I ran into lots of mutants on my way and died several times.|`|CKRfaRYvaa	There are two main ways.  The longer and more dangerous path is to go overland until you find Friendship North Metro Station.  Enter this station and follow it to the other end.    The shorter and (slightly) less dangerous path is to use the linked Underground Metro Tunnels.  First, find and enter the Farragut West Metro Station.  Once you get to the station in the center of this tunnel, you want to follow the Red Line, heading toward the Tenleytown Station.  This should take you GNR.  As you follow the tunnels you will occasionally see 'GNR outpost' graffiti to mark the way.      Hint:  When in doubt, follow the flaming barrels.  They usually mark the correct path.

gERaZGZeaa	Final Fantasy has gameplay?  I thought it was just "walk here, engage in boring turn-based battle where you press one button and watch a minute long animation".    Resident Evil is far more creative and fun.  Resident Evil 4 had a midget dressed as Napoleon who had built a giant stone robotic statue of himself.  You can't get much better than that.|`|PEGZmw73aa	I love both, don't make me decide...|`|zMZPH5Taaa	See, thats a very hard question to answer, because the games are totally different, and not even in the same category.  I love both of the series.  The classic Resident Evil 1-3.  The rest of them not so much, but the classic Playstation games.     I grew up playing Resident Evil games, when I was a kid.  I would rate Resident Evil 2 top 5 of my games list.    But Final Fantasy is also really good.  I grew up playing the Final Fantasy 7 to 10.  Final Fantasy 7 is also in my top 5 games list.  Both  games are different, because you have a RPG game, and than a zombie shoot em up game.    I would say both are really good games, and that you cant really pick a favorite, because those are classics.|`|q1Fav370aa	Wow how can I even compare the two, they are totally different. Graphically, the new games are on par, old games can't be compared simply because they are too different like comparing anime to Pixar CG. Gameplay can't be compared. Resident Evil new games play perfectly, Final Fantasy plays well but then again it's an RPG so compared to RPGs it couldn't play much better. Older RE games played awful, like controlling a tank, old FF games played like regular Turn based RPGs, so pretty well. The new RE game is coming out in march and FF sometime in 2010 if were lucky. I can't choose which is better because I got into both series around the same time many years ago, and I love them both.|`|JNmL9xfiaa	Hailey,  Both games are stupid!

EVjoCpjEaa	Every day you should pick up/put down your dog. It would probably help to leave the dog outdoors if it's not raining/snowing too.    You can only give gifts to Chen on his day off: Friday, but even if you just talk to him at the store everyday, you should still get the horse by Fall, Year 1.  Gifts that Chen likes: http://www.fogu.com/hm7/villagers/chen.p...
cLW7vFUGaa	Plant any pack of red flowers (Tulip, Hibiscus, Cosmos, Rose, Anemone...). On a SUNNY day when they are FULLY grown, there is a random chance that a bee will be flying above one of the blooms. Harvest it right when the bee is hovering over it and you'll get Honey (of whatever color the flower is) instead of the actual flower. (You might also get something called "Royal Jelly," but it's usually honey.) The best seasons to do it is probably either Spring or Summer, because there are more sunny days, but other seasons work too. (I think I got mine from an Anemone flower in Winter.) And if you plant them and they reach harvesting growth on a day WITHOUT bees, it would be best NOT to harvest them - just water and leave them until tomorrow for another chance.    Good luck! You WILL achieve your dream! xD
IUQjiNRmaa	If the dog forgot it's name start the game over by pressing A,B,Y,X,L,R  all at the same time at the beginning of the game.    Tips:    Don't be too close to the mic.    Pronounce the name clearly. Don't say the name in a high voice and then a low voice. That will only confuse the dog. Pick a tone and keep on repeating it.    Be patient.    Hope this helps?|`|nHPhIgn9aa	say his name very very clearly about every 6-7 seconds

In this case you'll get 4 or 5 armor out of it depending on which way they round.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Yes. The only time the attribute requirement applies to anything other than the line it is on is in the case of the + Energy on staves, which is tied in with the damage attribute requirement.

SEwqwjPkaa	Again bro...I don't have a Wii but I can tell you that on XBL, there are several who have reached the 10th level of prestige.  I personally would never take it to that level as I just hate starting over...and besides, I'm not that super great so it would take me months to get there.  Heck, if I'm lucky I'll get 2 hours to game each week.  The kids are constantly on that thing.  Boo Hoo for me right!?    Later...have fun!  Peace!

yVWKiTwTaa	no, you need an ethernet cable. and yes you plug it into either your modem or a router.    not sure about different types, never played online until i got ps3 and an ethernet cable was supplied with the system. however i do know that a standard phone line cant transmit data back and forth fast enough and can cause damage to the system itself. also if your internet connection is a dial up i dont think this will be fast enough, however not 100% sure for ps2. your modem needs a source though so it has to stay connected to where ever it gets the feed from. now you need to plug an ethernet cable into the out port on the modem and into the in port on the ps2. also this will only work on the slim model ps2 as they are already internet ready. that old box models need some other equipment before you can connect.|`|X25iYK97aa	never worked for me|`|P7jyZp6faa	You need to have internet working correctly first, and then if you have a big PS2, buy a Network Adapter and plug an Ethernet cable into it. If you have a slim PS2, it will already have an Ethernet cable on it (I'm not sure if wireless internet works are not, but I'd say no).
f80e40c6be11ef18f0153889d9336d4daa	The base ticket is going to cost you $149 for 2 days, to upgrade to the Park Hopper it is $50.  So you are paying an extra $25 per day for this ability.  In comparison to your entire trip this is probably a minimal cost.  In the end you will probably regret missing 2 of the parks.    As for getting between the parks, it is no Disneyland where you have another entire theme park across the Esplanade.      All Parks have buses that go between them, and depending on how you time the bus and how crowded it is, it could be anywhere from about 20-60 minutes to go between the parks.    Other methods for going between specific parks  Magic Kingdom to EPCOT    - You can take the Monorail from EPCOT to TTC(Ticket and Transportation Center).  From there you can transfer to the MK Monorail, or take the Ferry.  To go from the Magic Kingdom to EPCOT you would just reverse this.  This may take you between 15-30 minutes to get between these parks.    Disney Hollywood Stuidos to EPCOT  - From DHS you can also take a Ferry to the International Gateway of EPCOT Center.  The ferry only runs about every 20 minutes, and makes 3 stops at other resorts.  It is a nice ride but can take quite a while to go between the two parks by this method.|`|ZWaRNMzVaa	Its close!  If u stay @ a hotel or some other places there are busstops and u can g2 1 park 2 another fast............|`|DnyyyGeEaa	dont get a park hopper pass you will spend ALL your time at one park I promise. It takes days to get through the whole thing!|`|ajnGHNr8aa	I have never used the Park Hopper but have talked with those who have. The parks are all within 3-5 miles of each other so yes, you can see them all. The Park Hopper will allow you to see most of the 4 theme parks, but you wont see most of each one. The best bang for your buck! If you are staying at a Disney resort you can use their transportation, but I have found it better to use my own vehicle (if you are renting one that is). The transportation makes multiple stops before getting to the parks and most parks don't have busses that run between each park. This will take up to an hour at least a day from your short visit.  Not sure of the difference between DL & DWMK but if you skip the small kids stuff you can do it in 5-6 hours.|`|6VFaNmcQaa	Yes they are worth it. There are busses and monorails to get from park to park. Animal Kingdom doesn't take a whole day.|`|UMg1CL7baa	i think you would want it. the parks are a good 2-5 miles apart, i only was in disney for 3 days and i did all the parks, i its worth the money.|`|UyHLTE8kaa	a 2-day park hopper pass is $74.50 for a person ages 10 and up. I've been to disney world every year since the year 2000 and have never used a park hopper because we stay for a week. But for a shorter time period at disney, i think a park hopper would be a good idea. The four parks are a few miles apart from each other and disney also has the disney transportation system. When you go to Magic Kingdom its faster to take the monorail except the boat, that way you won't be wasting time. If you get a park hopper you must go to hollywood studios at night and then go see fantasmic.|`|fc7bkaEzaa	If your going for 2 days then I would get park hopper. You will definitely want to go to all the parks. It's possible to go to all 4 parks in 2 days, however, you probably won't see everything in the parks. If you don't get the park hopper you can only go to 1 park a day, which means you won't see 2 of the other parks. Get it, it's so worth it! Have fun!!!|`|5AI4xIB3aa	YES YES YES!!!!!!!!!! You will be going to plenty parks in one day, its a big discount. One for the rides, one for that dinner, one for that show, it adds up. Get it, its completely worth it. I get it every time.|`|WfqJK9cDaa	Here is a break down for ya:  1) Magic Kingdom: Amazing park, this is where all the fairy tale and adventure rides are. It is the best park in disney world.     2) Epcot: Very nice park, it is science related. It also has a 'pavillion' representing major countries in the world which are very fun to visit.     3) MGM Studios: The second best park there. It is a very techno park. So you'll find a mix of really cool rides and shows. DO NOT miss the show at this park, it is famous worldwide. Its called mickey's philhar magic.     4)Animal Kingdom: Name gives it away. Very nature related. Most rides are animal related. Good park again. Many wet rides.     I would HONESTLY recommend getting a hopper pass. There is no way you will enjoy all four parks in time. It is manageable in 2 days. There are monorails connecting 2 parks. And the other 2 are very nearby. It does not take long to get to the park as they are about 5 minutes drive from each other. Parking space is HUGE, but there are parking trams to get you to the entrance. Do not buy a 1 day pass, waste of your money, and you will not enjoy it. Go for the hopper.|`|S3sB1LA7aa	If you've already gone to Disney Land, maybe you should skip Magic Kingdom- the only really great rides there are Pirates of the Caribbean, Space Mountain, Buzz Lightyear's ride, and Philharmagic. Buzz Lightyear will be closed March 2 - 6.  Space Mountain will close April 19th.  You probably don't want to waste one of your tickets just to see two or three rides or attractions.  I've heard that Pirates and Space Mountain in Disney Land are better.    EPCOT is definitely a "whole-day" park, and so is Hollywood Studios.  Those two are also the closest for park-hopping- they are only about 1.5 miles apart, you can actually jog from one to another in 15 minutes (if you are fit).  You go out the back entrance of EPCOT, (between England and France) walk thru the Boardwalk area, and around behind it there is a path that leads right to Hollywood Studios.     But, if you haven't been to either one, you should plan for a whole day at each and save the park-hopper money.    BTW, parking in the Boardwalk lot is a good way to save parking fees for EPCOT or Studios- Just tell then that you are meeting friends at the hotel for breakfast at the Flying Fish cafe'.  Then you can go into Boardwalk and walk to your park.    Animal Kingdom is pretty far away from the other parks.  Unless you are dead-set on riding Everest, the Safari ride, or the River Rapids, I'd skip it.

However to appeal to the younger crowd, which I think should be done as well as the older folks who love classical music, there needs to be other music mixed in. For example Dance Dance Revolution has a couple of Beethoven songs as well as other classical music but mixed with a pop beat. People love them if, they are mixed with something the younger crowd can relate with.|`|5kkS93b9aa	wow dude you look pissed off|`|0pgfscoVaa	I actually thought of that myself a time or 2 it sounds pretty coool to me!|`|0HFvogmbaa	I think it would be a good game to make for the Nintendo Wii.

But unfortunately there's probably not a big enough market for that.
qdPCIprFaa	Any computer is usually good for not graphically intense games. Especially with one GB of RAM. see the game's minimum requirements and, if you have enough RAM, you're in good shape.    Now as for graphically intense games, in case you get one, you're probably in good shape also, but you need to pay more attention to the system requirements, because they need more RAM.    The other elements, such as sound cards and Hard Drive space, are less important, but don't feel too safe. If you buy too many games, you can overfill the Hard Drive.    Also, keep in mind that, this game may not be graphically intense, but neither is Backyard Skateboarding, which requires too much RAM for my computer. Of course, my PC has only 128 MB of RAM, but, 256 is a little much for one game.
Dso7k3sjaa	Actually, that's not true at all.  The sims 2 requires a good graphics card, that's why so many people can't get it to play right on a laptop.  It has to have a card that is capable of using DirectX 9.0c or DirectX 10 features.  It has to be able to pass the 3d testing and the card must also be able to use the Transform & Lighting features from DirectX.    A lot of gamers that consider themselves to be "hardcore" gamers, assume that because it's "the sims" that it doesn't have very high requirements when in reality it does.  Crysis does have very high requirements, but the sims 2 (and the sims 3 will as well) actually requires a better graphics cards then many 'hardcore' games such as WoW, GTA, etc.    Here is a listing of which video cards actually work with the sims 2 games and which ones don't:    http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...    That's the main reason EA made games such as The Sims Life Stories, The Sims Castaways and The Sims Pet Stories.  So people who are trying to play sims games on a laptop with a crappy integrated video chip would still be able to play a "sims" type of game.    Hi Melethana!  Thanks for adding the link to the requirements for the sims 3.  I didn't want to bother, lol!  But yes, I have heard that the requirements for the sims 3 are a little bit higher than they were even for the last few sims 2 eps.  It's just that people think of the sims games as being games that are "worthless" and figure they can be played on anything.  If only that were true, huh?  Then we wouldn't have to answer so many questions of:  Why won't it play on my laptop?  hahahaha!|`|AA11850311	Sims2Player gave you very good information about how graphically demanding Sims2 is, but Sims3 will be even more demanding.  Here are the MINIMUM requirements for Sims3  http://thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/newsIt...    Hi Sims2Player!!!|`|ELovXY9Paa	LOL  no.  Crysis is graphically intensive.  COD4 is moderately graphically intensive.  The sims 3?  No.  It will be about on the same level as Spore in terms of graphic power.  With the more casual games like The Sims, EA tries to make them as graphically UN-intensive as possible, so that more casual gamers can play without breaking the bank on a new video card and processor.  You can count on it, it will not have high system requirements.
LsIMKcHcaa	The link doesn't show which graphics card you have. But usually any PC these days has a minimum of 128mb of video card memory. I think you'll be fine.|`|2f47a7fb887504f90dec5b605dd5f63baa	it lists these 2 cards, either one could be in your pc, you didn't specify:  Integrated:   Intel?  GMA X4500HD     Discrete Graphics options from ATI:   256MB ATI RadeonTM  HD 3450 (DVI, VGA, HDMI)    they should both work but the ati one is a lot better, the gma 4500 is integrated which is not great

If you didn't remove the wrapping from them, you'll get full price for returning them. (I do believe that there's a certain amount of time that you get for returning a new game. Possibly 10-15 days) However, if you did remove the wrapper, you're only going to get a fraction of what you paid for the games.    If you did remove the wrap, then try selling the games to either your friends or on Ebay. At least then you won't feel like you got ripped off.|`|Rqi31r1Vaa	im pretty sure u can trade the games in but make sure it worth it because eb is a rip off sum times..ps.. how did u loose ur 360!?|`|i6MGxHezaa	only if you have the recipt, otherwise, you can only exchange for the same game.|`|giQXgwRCaa	You probably could trade them in for either full price or very near full price, but I'm not sure.

(i dont know the website)|`|VCET6rgPaa	Answer:  Amazon, GameStop or Ebay.    Details:  The 60GB PS3 systems are no longer being produced, so you can't walk into a store and just pick one up. There are some that are new (as in have not been used) available on Amazon.com, but these are $990.00 and up, so it's doubtful that you're looking for that. Amazon has used 60GB PS3 systems starting at $369.00. I have provided a link to 60GB PS3s at Amazon below.    As far as video game stores are concerned, GameStop deals with used gaming systems, as well as new ones, and they have refurbished 60GB PlayStation 3 consoles available on their website. I have provided a link to the 60 GB PS3 page at GameStop below, as well.    You can also find 60GB PS3 systems available on eBay. If you decide to go this route, read all of the details of the item you're bidding on and ask questions about anything that you find unsettling. I, personally, don't often buy things from eBay, because I'm afraid of getting a poor deal and not really having any recourse. At least when I'm dealing with a company that I've heard of, I feel like I have some ability to lodge a complaint. However, if you wish to check out eBay as well, I have provided a link below that will take you to their 60GB PS3 listings.

zMZPH5Taaa	Sorry but no. The only cheat to get money is the $1000 dollar cheat code.  I looked for that too, but only got that one.  Its a pain, aint it.    But no, there is no other code to get money except for the one you already have.  Hope this helped|`|3jGGzCUJaa	Its not a cheat so much but what you do is go to a car theft point then shoot a cop or gang member & they will come at you then you just shoot drive the car into the blue light get paid 500 dollars & wait for the next then save your gave every so often & when the cops or gangs get to crazy you can just reload & have your rating gone for free while safely back at your house. I recommend the one closes to your hideout by the gargage & tunnel. Once you have stolen any car you can keep stealing it over & over & at least one of the car theft sites wants a cop car & an ambalunce so you can shoot someone to or steal either & drive them right in get 500 & thats that. Before you know it you'll have tons of case with little hassel. If you steal all the cars first then do it you can jack any car you had on any of the 4 lists you see & just drive it in. killing cops or gang members though bring guaranteed cars to you so you could sit in the truck yard & shot the bad guy then get in & either drive it in or if its already in the blue light just getting in it will pay you lOL.        You use to be able to steal an armor car & just keep blowning it up to get 4-7k then pay 500 dollars to get it back at your garage again & keep doing it but its not as reliable as what i mentioned above. Plus you have to use grenades or pipe bombs which arent cheap you can only carry a limit. It takes usually 2 or 3 to blown one up which added with the 500 or so makes it not as effective as the other plus some times you can blown it up & it be empty then what.|`|DTOBAdIKaa	i dont own it but i looked on the net and all i got was this code?       2274666399      Hope this helped      Plz pick best answer

BpUTyfDxaa	The only reason that you cannot get the demo is because you set your account to say that you are under 18 years old. It is a demo therefore it is free and an account under 18 years old cannot download free M content. Sorry I know it sucks.  You could make a fake account(not recommended). Microsoft is picky about stuff like that.

Or you could use the cheat way but it's a bit long...  Press Ctrl+Alt+C  in the box at the top type BoolProp TestingCheatsEnabled true  make sure don and darren on the lot aswell as your woman sim, right click on her choose spawn>sim modder.    A baby should appear standing up on the floor nearby, click it and choose relationships>mutual with other>then the name of the sim you dont want her to love anymore>likes.    This will make them best friends but they do not have a crush on or love each other.    EDIT: To turn off cheat mode again press Ctrl+Alt+C and type the same code in the box but with false at the end instead of true.

Thumbs-up to that person!  :-)    eta -- I only wanted to add that you do have to have Nightlife installed to be able to get the sim modder though.

However, COD4 is not available for the PS2, so you're pretty much out of luck.  Trust me, you don't want the DS version.  Sorry about that, I hope you find another game you'll like.

TLgiTFh4aa	I'm afraid that your graphics card IS pretty bad, although it should handle KOTOR 2, to be fair.  You may not have enough RAM (you need at least a gig), Try cleaning up your registry, and de-frag your hard drive, that should give you a few more FPS.  You may find this link useful, too.  http://www.tweakguides.com/  There is an article about how to improve the performance of KOTOR in there somewhere, as well.

xDoemlGYaa	PS3 it can do so many things BETTER!  (Xbox screams you are old and poor)   you need to have the best stuff  Number 1|`|NrTYEpnSaa	these consoles obviously have their benefits and their downfalls.     My personal favorite is the PS3.    The PS3 comes with a Blu-ray player, the only next gen console to have one, plus the online multiplayer is free, and it is by far the most reliable console out there at the moment. On the negative side, the chip used in the PS3 is so complex that programmers have to work extra hard to get the games to work on the PS3 that some developers just wont put the money into it. If you give the PS3 a chance, i think it will dominate.     The XBOX 360 has a wide range of really good games and the online multiplayer is awesome, but then you have to pay for it, amongst having to 60 pounds to go wireless as well. There is also the problem with the red ring of death, which is very frequent, i work in a game store and we get no less than 5 back a week with the red ring. the 360 also has a tendency to scratch your games if the console is moved or knocked whilst being on. Other than that it is an awesome console.    The wii is by far the most interactive and popular console. One of its main redeeming features is its motion control, it is a whole new way to play your games, plus the console is very family orientated. It also has a backwards compatibility feature enabling you to play gamecube games as welll as wii games. On the downside, the graphics are nowhere near as good as the other 2 consoles, and you don't get all of the huge game titles like fallout etc.     It really does depend what you want out of your console, my vote is PS3. If you need any more advice id be glad to help.    Hope this helps :D|`|Ehq45ORRaa	I have all three so i may be able to help  Remember that everybody's answers are just opinions, but my friends have a lot of these systems as well    Ps3-  graphics are top notch, incredible, better than most 360 games.  ps3  has some cool sony-only games like haze and some others, but if you want to play some halo, this system won't support it.  Overall i would say ps3 is a great system, very similar to xbox 360.  I haven't found a down side to it yet and i love it.  It also has blue ray built in it, and online is free!! (for the most part).  But the cost is still through the roof to buy the system    Xbox 360-  This is the most popular system because of the "somewhat" inexpensive cost and a wide variety of games.  i have over 30 games for this system and still play a lot of them.  although 360s online play cost more, i like the setup better than ps3.  there is a major downside though.  there has been a lot of talk and possible law suits to microsoft because they knew that the 360 could break games when played.  which is true, my 360 broke one of my games.  overall i would say the 360 is a good system, but brakes down a lot, i had the red ring of death like 15 times on mine.  (the red ring of death means the system has an internal problem and won't run).  the customer support is not so great either.  But the wide variety of games certainly passes the wii and ps3, but the ps3 will start releasing more games, it is still a pretty new system.    Nintendo Wii- This is a great system, not meant for hardcore gamers, but for people who want to have fun.  The wii is the only system of its kind, most of the controls are done with motion sensors in the controller.  A lot of people claim to loose weight when playing wii, and with the new "Wii Fit," which features a board to stand on and is used for exercise, this game can actually get you in shape.  One downside is that the wii lacks the overall graphics of other systems, your mii (a character created for use in many wii games, which is very low quality in graphics) is used for many games on the wii. to be honest i got bored of the wii after about 4 months of playing it.  it is very inexpensive though.    Overall i play my xbox 360 over everything else.  the wide variety of games and the amount of friends that play it are what make it so popular.  Trust me, if you have friends who play video games, most of them play them on xbox 360.|`|MxO1u44Gaa	i own a wii.. its great for family events and small gatherings not much else.   i had a 360 and sold it for my ps3... in my opinion th best gaming decision i have made in my life.   i had the pc hd graphics booster for 360 and ps3 graphics still win hands down on the same tv. the gaming experience is also much more fluid and joystick control is so much better than xbox joystick.   ps network isnt as good as xbox live but u can afford to buy another brand new game on ps3 for the price you pay for live and ps network is not bad at all just not as good as a microsoft product online.   live isnt worth 40 pounds more than ps network although admittedly a little better.   ps3 is the game console to own as the only reason pepole would still choose to buy a 360 at the shop instead of a ps3 is that they didnt have the money.   Hope this helps!!|`|3eQhA8nraa	really condensed here    wii is the best party system (great if you have a lot of friends over, as well as if you aren't really into gaming. its a great stepping stone to the single player consoles. ie. the 360 and ps3    360 is the best console exclusive system (has the best online experience, and best console exclusive titles. plus chances are most of your friends have one)    ps3 is the best multimedia system (blu ray dvd player, enough said)    if your talking specs wise the ps3, hands down. as a matter of fact if you have a 1080p tv and no blu ray player this is the console for you. this is because all of the ps3 good exclusive titles will come out this year or the next. hopefully. if your not willing to take the risk buy a 360. don't get the arcade, because if you want to get online, your going to spend a $100 to get online anyways (upgrading to pro specs)|`|Wvuj8VIHaa	|---  |-----------2 Points--------|||"|""\__  |__________________|||_|___|)  !(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|1XCFEmp4aa	OPINION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|TSbeWR3saa	xbox360 has good games and good graphics|`|7A192nWMaa	I personally like the xbox 360|`|eWfBYZA8aa	PS3:if you want free online and the bluray  Xbox360:(elite is best)if you want lots of exclusive games,more people to play with online and more down-loadable content.I think xboxes are also cheaper now.

PQy6if0Waa	Well if I remember from the old days, it meant they attacked another player out in the Wilderness. Anyone who struck first got a skull on their head, and if they died while they were marked, they lost everything in their inventory instead of keeping their 3 most valuable things.    I forget how long it takes to disappear.  That's how it was back then, I haven't played it for like 2 years, and I know things have changed.|`|eaFqyJpIaa	it means you don't keep anything because you attacked someone but it should go away after a while
eeTJ60s0aa	Levels 50-70    If you're between the levels of 50-70, new fish like lobsters and swordfish can be cooked without too much burning. These few fast methods should make sure you reach level 70 in a minimal amount of time.    1) Roasting Lobsters    LobsterCooked lobsterLobsters are a good fish for cooking. They give 120 XP each, and can be bought and sold at basically the same price. There are two ways to obtain these fish.    A) Get the fish yourself. The fish can be fished in a variety of locations. They can be caught from these locations:    (i) Catherby. This is beyond the White Wolf Mountain and is the most common place to catch lobsters for members. Bank or cook your fish to the west.  Catherby fishing area    (ii) Musa Point. You need 30gp to get on the Island. However if you have a Ring Of Charos (a), you can get to Musa Point for free. You could Falador teleport if you wish to bank your fish quickly.  The Musa point docks    (iii) The Fishing Guild. This require level 68 Fishing to enter, or 65 with a Fishing Potion. The "F" and "Y" docks are the fishing spots. There is a range here, but it is recommended that you bank your fish first, then cook them.  The fishing guild    B) Buy the fish yourself. This is much faster although you will lose money in the process. Lobsters can be bought raw in World 1 for 230 GP each (1/6/07) and sold cooked for 200-220gp each. See the World One Trading guide for a detailed explanation.    Overall, you need 5,303 Lobsters to get to level 70 Cooking. Making that number closer to 6,000 would be a much safer bet incase you burn lots of Lobsters. Those can be all bought for around 1.3M (1/5/07), or fished for free. Another thing to note is this; if you have completed the Family Crest quest and chose the Cooking Gauntlets, you will not burn lobsters at level 68 cooking.    XP per cooked lobster: 120 XP  XP needed for level 70 (from 50): 636,294 XP  Lobsters for level 70 cooking (from 50): 6000  XP earned per hour: 140,000 XP    2) Making Wine    Jug of wineDespite wine has already been mentioned several times, it is still a very good method for XP, and it will continue to be until level 70! This section will tell you how many you need and the XP given. Also a small note on powercooking is given. The usual ingredients are needed, grapes and a jug of water. Incase you don't already know, this is how to obtain them.    Grapes - Found in the Cooks' Guild or the Phoenix Gang hideout. They can also be bought from the Culinaromancer's Chest for 1 gp each.  Jug of water - Jugs can be bought from the Culinaromancer's Chest for 1 gp each. They can also be bought from General Stores. Fill it up at a fountain or sink.    Once you have those, follow this to make wine fast:       1. Fill jugs with water, and withdraw 14 from your bank.     2. After obtaining grapes, withdraw 14 from your bank.     3. Move one of the jugs of water or grapes to the bottom of your inventory, next to the opposite ingredient.     4. Use the grapes with your jug of water until there are no more left.     5. Put everything in your bank.     6. Wait 15 seconds for the wine to ferment, and voila, 200 cooking XP!     7. Repeat.    That method for making the wine is fastest and will maximize XP. You need to make around 3,250 wines to get to level 70. The exact number is 3,182, but sometimes you may make one or two bad wines. That's 3,250 grapes and jugs of water overall.    XP per jug of wine: 200 XP  XP needed for level 70 (from level 50): 636,294 XP  Amount of wine needed for level 70 (from level 50): 3,250  XP earned per hour making wine: 375,000 XP    Levels 70-85    You are up there with the best chefs in RuneScape, and that is something to be proud of. These next few tips for raising your level will help you reach 85.    1) Roasting Lobsters    LobsterCooked lobsterLobsters are now a very good way to raise you level for one main reason. That reason being if you have the Cooking Gauntlets from the Family Crest quest, you will not burn any lobsters now. In fact, you will stop burning them at level 68 with the gloves! This means now you will have an exact number to cook. Use the tips above for methods to obtain the fish. But first, you need to know how many lobsters you need to cook to reach level 85. The number is 21,009. If you have cooking gauntlets, there is no need to get extra lobsters because you won't burn anything!    XP per cooked lobster: 120 XP  XP needed for level 85 (from 70): 2,520,967 XP  Lobsters for level 85 cooking with cooking gauntlets from 70 (without Gauntlets): 21,009 (21,400)  XP earned per hour: 140,000 XP    2) Making Wine    Jug of wineWine is, still, extremely good experience, even at levels like 70! All it requires are grapes and a jug of water, which can both be bought extremely cheaply. This is how to get the ingredients:    Grapes - Found in the Cooks' Guild or the Phoenix Gang hideout. They can also be bought from the Culinaromancer's Chest for 1 gp each.  Jug of water - Jugs ca|`|w9J25hq9aa	Buy raw lobsters or sharks then cook them, Then sell the cooked ones for more raw ones.

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	WOW a complex model with VERY nice paint work.    When I have a model with gloss parts and matte parts, here's how I tend to do it...    I ALWAYS put a gloss coat down prior to applying decals (I do mostly aircraft and armor) so the decals don't get that "silver" background.  After the decals are on and set... I mask off anything that needs to remain gloss (struts, lenses, windows/canopies, etc) and spray the model with Dull-coat.    Again, that's a very nicely done model.
qv5YTx5kaa	The Xbox has actually been shown to be graphically superior to the PS3 in a lot of comparisons, plus the Xbox has a much better and more reliable online service.

Final Fantasy XIII, Resident Evil 5 and Street Fighter IV, along with many xbox-exclusive games and exclusive downloadbale content (AKA Fallout 3) should be enough to trade.    2. The xbox actually has better graphics. And even then, it's only slightly. It's almost uncomparible. Both consoles have next-gen graphics.    3. With the NXE, xbox RROD rates are reduced and the sound of the xbox itself is significantly reduced.     4. Your friends are right. Online is amazing on 360, it'll blow you away.    5. As far as I can see the PS3 has 3 exclusive games this year, none of which look particularly AMAZING. It's all about cross-platform devs now-a-days.|`|LIJ3AseEaa	I have both. It really just depends on the gamer you are. From what I've noticed is that PS3 tends to be more solo involved as many people do not have it. But you are correct ps3 has better graphics as it operates80 i. While the 360 is more friendly so to say which lots of interactive gamers. It only operates on a 720 level of graphics. That being said 360 is coming out with bluray capabilities so that might be something to look into if you trade it. But at the same time be cautious, you friend may have an older 360 which tends to have hard drive failures. I would say if he doesn't have a warranty don't do it because it will break on you. Besides 360's are cheap (relatively) costing only 299 and you get a lot of accesseries with it.|`|4qPzdCSXaa	if you don't have much money to throw around i would stick with the ps3. it is easily the most powerful of the consoles and microsoft will be coming out with newer updated consoles just to keep up like they have with the 360 elite.they already have plans to do so, whist the ps3 is around for the foreseeable. have both consoles and was devout 360 follower, but have had to bow down to the ps3's Superiority. just have a look at a trailer for the exclusive kill zone, it blows any game out the water

mTNz8GHGaa	In a way, you do have to repeat everything every time you save, but in a way, you don't.  If you learn the Song of Soaring, you can use it to travel instantly to owl statues throughout Termina.  You can travel to any statue you've previously activated (by hitting it with your sword.)  The perched owl will open its wings as proof of this activation.  And you only need to activate the statues once per game.    Owl statues usually have jars, bushes, or snowballs around them that contain arrows, bombs, magic jars, and fairies.  Certain ones will also contain items specific to that area, like Deku sticks.     To learn the Song of Soaring, follow these steps:    1) Rescue the old witch in the forest and take the boat cruise she offers.  If you want to speed up the process of rescuing her, simply buy a red potion from Kotake before entering the Woods of Mystery.    2)  Assuming you've already learned the Sonata of Awakening from the monkey, you can skip all the in-palace stuff. Get out of the boat and hop east onto the first lily pad. Then hop onto the lily pad to the right, then onto the ledge at the end. Use the Deku Flower there and fly onto the higher ledge, then go up to enter the Southern Swamp.      3) Southern Swamp    Back in this area, go up and defeat the Dragonflies that will appear, then use the Deku Flower and fly to the following red platform. Use the Deku Flower there to fly to the next platform, then use that Deku Flower to fly onto the fallen tree. From there, walk onto the next platform and use the Deku Flower there to fly left onto the next ledge.    Upon landing, the owl from the previous Zelda game will appear. It'll tell you about the owl statues, then ask you to learn the song on the stone it is sitting on. After it flies away, check out the stone to learn the Song of Soaring. After that, use the Deku Flower and fly to the ledge on the other side of the waterfall. There, go into the cave to enter the Woodfall area.    Once you're in the Woodfall area, make your way to the wooden platform in the middle.  Hit the owl statue with your sword to activate it.  Now you can save and go back to Day 1 if you want.  Just use the Song of Soaring to go back to the owl statue any time you want.

Well first of all you can try if the option INVITE/LOCATION works, sometimes it does show you members nearby (in your state / country)   so you can easily add these as friends.    Another way is to share your friendsnumber with others, you can find your number by clicking on INVITE followed by FRIEND CODE. This will reveal your code also.    Post this in the following database:  http://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?...    and on forums:  http://imobonline.freeforums.org/  and the forum you can access from the Imob menu item.

qIVRM8Liaa	First you need to set up an internet connection with your wii. You can do this very easily if your connection is wireless. All you need to do is to change the connection setings on the wii. A new channel called wii store should then open up.    Next you need to enter your wii points (if you have any) or buy them using a credit card.    After that you need to search the game you want to download and buy it using the wii points.
QYvM7Lrjaa	Heya,    Yeah i remember that part was really tricky the first time :/  So here you go mate:    Step 1: Unzip Your Game Save File.     You can get game save for different sources. It can be the game you have saved to emergency purposes.    Make Sure You Have Your Game Save File in your computer already. If the Game Save is in ZIP format, you need to unzip the file.    After unzip, you will see a folder looks like:    "ULJM05006_DATA" (this is just a sample only, the actual name could be different).    Step 2: Connect Your PSP To Your PC.    Once properly connected, you need to use File Explorer to go into the PSP folder of your PSP. Just like exploring any folders in your PC. At the top level, you should see these folders:    MP_ROOT, PSP    You need to go into "PSP" folder. In there, you will see these folders:    GAME, MUSIC, PHOTO, SAVEDATA    Go into "SAVEDATA"    Step 3: Copy The Game Save Into The "SAVEDATA" Folder of Your PSP.     You will have to copy your game save into this folder. Go back to where you have unzipped the game save. In this example, the sub-folder name is ULJM05006_DATA". Highlight the whole sub-folder and copy" and paste inside the SAVEDATA folder.    You need to be careful not to over-write any sub-folders inside the SAVEDATA folder. For example, you you already have "ULJS00002" and you game save name is the same, make sure you do not over-write it. Rename the original sub-folder first before you copy over.

They are:    moveObjects on ;  boolProp snapobjectstogrid false; and,  boolProp allow45DegreeAngleOfRotation true    If you turn on all three of those cheats, you can pretty much decorate any way you want.  There are also some hacks which I really like because they allow me to decorate with more clutter.  This is one of the hacks I like to use:    http://www.modthesims2.com/download.php?...    That hack allows you to place more "stuff" on things like the dressers, the coffee tables, etc.  But make sure you actually read everything the creator says about the hack because you have to pick one version and it needs to be the version that will work with your latest released game (the one you have to use to play).    Anyway, another one of my favorite hacks is:    http://linna.modthesims2.com/download.ph...    It makes it so when you put a dishwasher or a trash compactor into one of the counters, it doesn't show through the counter.  I just hate how that looks!     And then there is a hack that makes it so you can put things on a corner counter and your sims will still be able to use the item.  Like, you can put a microwave or a phone on a corner counter and your sim will be able to use it.  Without the hack, your sim cannot use anything that you put into the corners, so you can only put decorative items in the corners.  Which seems pretty unrealistic to me.  Here's a link to that hack:    http://www.modthesims2.com/download.php?...    With any hack, make sure you read everything that the creator of the hack says about it, so you understand where you are supposed to put it, how it works and if you need to get a certain version of it for your games.    Oh, and just in case you want to see a listing of every cheat that came with each ep, you can check out this site:    http://www.snootysims.com/cheatsindex.ph...    There is a lot of other great information on that site too, besides just the cheats.

GccD0Dcraa	Of course you can. The drum set relies on touch pads inside each "drum".  Any object can activate these pads. You could play the them with wooden spoons and it would make no difference!|`|qIVRM8Liaa	Yes i do it all of the time.|`|DkjWkPQuaa	yes, of course, because the drum stick that Rock Band comes with are real after all

P.S. there are tricks to lvling and skilling up in Cabal. what lvl are you now?

SkpRC2Nmaa	Try to reinstall the game
GccD0Dcraa	Ooooh. I would say SSBB, but you have that already. If you like shooting games, the Link's Crossbow Trainer pack with the Wii Zapper is great practice for your other games. I know this doesn't fit the categories that you gave but Winter Sports '08 for Wii is good too. For DS, I recommend Lego Indiana Jones: The Orignal Adventures. Hope this helps.|`|ENX0ouynaa	i recommend for ds final fantasy its pretty good or you can get zelda

2Ruxn2NQaa	i would recommend metal gear solid 4 because it got game of the year on like 4 sites and its totally awesome. Also i heard little big planet is good. Finally, resistance 2 fall of man. If you already have these however, I would recommend CoD WaW as the game to get (great online and nazi zombies is soooo fun)|`|AXn3rjEWaa	gta pwns saints row  i dont like world at war...ehh boring  nfl 09 will be pretty amazing  def jam is stupid  street fighter is cool if your into that sort of thing(i was never good at it)  socom will also be amazing  mlb 09 will again be amazing  not sure what nfs is  gran turismo is sweet if your into that sort of thing.      but i suggest you buy metal gear solid 4 because it won game of the year for 2008 and its just a really good game|`|Sp3In8Ksaa	1. ok  2. good  3. Im not into sports game so idk  4. ok  5. ok  6. eh  7. same as  3  8. trash  9. good    I would go with Call of Duty WAW    oh and chill the hell out with the caps lock|`|012c00f3aed6127a6a10506a53fbc105aa	Call of Duty: WaW - You can play this game with your friends even online or offline, and it's a great gaming experience.     Also, I recommend that you buy Little Big Planet. It's a platforming game that is extremely fun and innovative. You can play the regular story mode, and afterwards you can go online and explore all the user created levels. This is one game that will ALWAYS keep your occupied and entertained.|`|u2Afg0IFaa	I would say  2, 3, or  7. It depends I don't know what you would like.|`|4qPzdCSXaa	if you have played any of the metal gears, i suggest you get metal gear solid 4, guns of the patriots. you should be able to pick it up fairly cheap as its been out a while and it blows all of the games on your list out of the water|`|Upy4Dap8aa	call of duty waw because after u beat it theres a nazi zombie level!!!!
HyjZLzOiaa	I assume that the game is written in C/C++ so you would have to start learning that language.. and I mean from the basics.    http://www.cppgameprogramming.com is not a bad start.    http://www.planetsourcecode.com is also good for studying code snippets.    I'm sure there are plenty forums out there which specifically specialize in game programming... Google is your best friend!|`|eeTJ60s0aa	You can't just jump in and make a game like GunZ, that game requires a team of at least 10 people, all with their own specific skills.    I recommend you start with GameMaker (see if you can get GameMaker Pro) from YoYo games. This program not only teaches you the basics, it's possible to make very good games. You won't be able to make them multiplayer OR as big/in-depth as GunZ, but you CAN make a mario clone within a week. It requires a lot of effort, and reading up on a lot of tutorials. I recommend using YouTube to get down to the basics.    If you don't want to use GameMaker then Flash is the only other option for a beginner, also you'd have to teach yourself a lot of the basics, which can seem like "master" level, it's best to use YouTube as a guiding point for this also.    Flash costs money.|`|mtFPjUNLaa	you are going to need thousands of dollars worth or programs like PhotoShop, 3D Studio Max, might need to use Flash. You need a Multimedia Degree to do it if you want to make any money of it. If you dont than you probably could use flash. i've used PhotoShop and 3D Studio Max. very complicated programs.    Here is a link to download free trials of the programs:  3Ds Max:http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/mfo...  PhotoShop:http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/p...    Hope I helped ^_^
ez4A5sb3aa	Right-click with your mouse in the direction you want to walk.
fVZysX9jaa	Well first you need to make the spade to help him make the fire, and to get the parts for the spade you need to go see Dr. Weeder and help her with her 2nd quest (the one with the plant nutrients/pesticide AKA the tube with green liquid) then receive from her its two parts, the handle and the head. Go to the crafting rock and check all the ? mark templates for one that uses these two parts, and that's where you make the spade. You will also need 2 rocks, and 1 thing of sticks. To find the rocks you can go around the island click on your sim, and there should be "dig". Dig until you have 2 rocks, if you can't find rocks, go around the islands and dig in different places, once you find them, go to chef's fire and create it for him, but I would suggest that you save b4 you create the fire just in case it doesn't work.  Hope I helped and good luck!!
ELovXY9Paa	So far, EA has not announced any such features.  It would be awesome, but it would completely change the way the game is played, and I personally don't think EA will release such a severe alteration to the game.|`|199dc9ef4dc2861a490ec578e623403caa	you can see there creations if you subscribe to their account but u cannot play with them
PQy6if0Waa	http://www.callofduty.com/    Click on the Right blade, showing Call of Duty: World at War    At the top, there should be a 'Member Log-in'    Click it, and register an account there.    Once it's active, click on 'My Account' where you originally were supposed to sign in. (Where it shows your name at the top)    And then on that page, look down in that big box. There should be tabs all on it, and click on the one called 'Linking'.    Enter information there.

euo8aFXiaa	If you put the cheat in before you enter the house it will work. do the ctrl, shift, c  on the neighbor hood screen, then put in the cheat, also if you want more people to come to your house in the neighbor hood screen do the cheat box and put in intprop maxnumofvisitingsims      you just put in what ever   you want. I put in 30 its a nice   lol. Also if you put in the boolprop cheat in the hood, when you go to make a sims hold down    shift  and  n   that unlocks the hidden sim stuff like clothes and skins. Check out modthesims2.com  its a great site. Have fun simming|`|ZMsMo8Uoaa	you have to leave your lot and come back and then it will let you drag the notches up for the skills. Actually you don't have to come back, you can drag them up on the next lot.
PQy6if0Waa	He requires at least Good Karma.    Reducing Karma is bad, so doing bad things reflect on what kind of character you are.    GAINING Karma makes you a good person, so yeah, if you want him, better get to doing good things from now on.    Some good ways include giving vagabonds that sit outside Megaton and Rivet City some purified water, that'll give you around +50 a pop. And if you have the Megaton house, asking your robotic butler for something to drink will give you a bottle of purified water. I think he gives you three per in-game weeks.

aBHY2iXraa	One day the longshots will come in, you wont have all the chances covered and you will have to pay-up big. Make sure you can borrow enough money to cover potential losses or you'll find yourself covered in blood and lying in a ditch.|`|7TQ5qGWcaa	Before becoming a bookie, you need to develop a strategy, here we can help you . Visit our bookie directories and or check out our online bookie links for comprehensive bookmaking information.|`|eNHGiEvGaa	The above link is crap, with lots of ads and virtually no information.    Now, I'm not an expert, and can only offer very little common sense advice, but I'll give you what I've got.    If you can balance your books, you can't lose (unless you "lose" by failing to collect from a losing bettor, or by getting busted).  If you can an equal amount of action on both sides of a bet, in terms of money multiplied by the payoff, then your players are essentially betting against each other, and you're collecting free money for sitting in the middle (through a 10% vig charged to the winners in some cases, or through the structure of the payoff odds).    If you're using someone else's point spreads and odds, such as those from a paper, and you find that the books aren't balancing, then you've got to consider why, and decide what to do about it.  I'll just use the example of betting with a point spread on an NBA game.  Celtics vs. Kings, giving 17 points to the dogs the Kings.  You pay 9:10 on winning bets, collecting your 10% vig (which amounts to 5% of all action, both sides considered).    If you've got a small number of bettors, or if some of your bettors gamble for disproportionately high stakes, then random variance will cause your books to be unbalanced.  The only thing you can do about this is to increase the number of bettors, or insure yourself by holding a big bankroll to cover you in bad situations.    If, on the otherhand, you see that the local betting trends favor one or several teams over others, then you may have to adjust your betting lines to get more action on the other side.    The tricky question is this:  Do you believe the betting line your using reflects the *actual* odds of the game?  That is, if you were betting on the game, would you consider the betting line to offer no edge to either side?  If that's the case, then you have a compromise to consider.  By not moving the line, and allowing your books to be imbalanced, you actually have a higher winning expectation.  But you also have a higher exposure to losing money to bad luck/variance.  Moving the line reduces your exposure, it's safer, but it's also less profitable in the long run.    A big bankroll gives you more freedom.  It allows you to survive more exposure.  Choose according to what you know about local gamblers, your real estimate of the odds, and how much you risk if the books are imbalanced and the local favorite wins.|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	you making money, know it's illegal AND take action on your own high school....impressive....the next natural progression is fix a coupla games and do some loansharking for your degenerate rich classmates...probably gotta branch out with meth to the winners so you control all the discretionary cash floating around campus........one last thing...this is a business...don't gamble yourself or take drugs!
gQhKpI3gaa	they are called interactive fiction games or text adventure games.    http://jerz.setonhill.edu/if/index.html    or wikipedia  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_advent...    I am sure if you google or look up wikipedia based on this you can probably find your childhood game, although it probably won't be as fun as it was when you were a child... things never are.

The site below doesn't mention a release of Godzilla toys in the late '70s known as "Godzilla's Gang." They were distributed by Mattel and created by Popey. I still have several of the figures hanging out in storage somewhere.     Weird thing, only Godzilla is from, well, Godzilla. His "gang" all came from Ultraman. Still, they're cool and were poseable...and only cost $1 at the time.

AA12113863	To do that, you would have to do some very complex game editing and stuff. So far, nobody has done it. However, you can rename your neighborhood and get a cut scene that way!    If you name your neighborhood a certain name, it will have a cut scene for it. Name it any of these names, and it will have a cut scence:  Pleasantview, Strangetown, Veronaville, Riverblossom Hills, Desiderata Valley, Sedona, Europa, Lakeview and Meadow Hills.    Beware, most of those names will give you a cutscene that will go through mountains and the floor! The cutscene is accustom to other terrains, most likely. The reason why those names work is that EAxis attatched cutscenes to specific names. People have speculated that the unused names that have cutscenes were going to be other premade neighborhoods, but never made it into the game.

That aside, I like the Lincoln Repeater, good fire rate, good damage and uses .44 ammo which is only used in the scoped .44 magnum and black hawk so its fairly plentiful and versatile.|`|JCupeVkJaa	The Lincoln Repeater is extremely good. Also the Terrible Shotgun can be deadly, but seems to work better without using VATS.

Adding a Rock-type will make that even worse, since they're usually weak to Ground and Fighting as well.  With that many overlapping weaknesses to common types, you may want to rethink your team.    http://pokemon.marriland.com/diamond_pea... may help - it shows the weaknesses and resistences.    If you still want a sixth Pokemon for that group, I'd suggest Swampert, Whiscash, Quagsire, or Gastrodon. Water/Ground is only weak to grass, and they should all learn a Rock move, as well as Water to help cover your Ground and Rock problems.|`|M4L3QY3gaa	Tyranitar.

AUCcZ8lQaa	It is an 'on rails shooter'.  It is first person while playing the game, then pulls back for the quick cutscense.  I wouldn't consider it a fps though because you can't move around.  the 'on rails' part means you are stuck going where the game wants you to go, but you do play in the first person perspective.    Any game where you see the viewpoint of the character you are playing is first person.|`|hgamJ1JBaa	First Person|`|cTYBqxajaa	House of the Dead is a Rail Shooter meaning that the waypoints were set by the developers and that there is not way of exploring (like a train stuck on a rail).
