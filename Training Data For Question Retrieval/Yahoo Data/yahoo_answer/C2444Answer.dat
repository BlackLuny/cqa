58e95a5bcb9b3b1cb28831601a8bb259aa	True. Thinking that you are 100% in control of your life is just foolish. Different people are born into different socioeconomic status so they don't have same opportunities. There are many things that you just can't control.|`|A65C8cmeaa	I believe life is what you make it, if you didn't achieve your goals its your own fault no one Else's, people need to take responsibility for there own mistakes and not play the blame game, sometimes its no ones fault and its just the circumstances.|`|6g7gmxzWaa	I actually don't believe that because for example if you go to the grocery store and then someone pushes you and something falls, it's their fault, too.

You are never too young or old to be responsible for yourself.|`|MyVtwtOnaa	true..i would say my mother had a hand in it as well.
NYU37jfGaa	I would imagine literature, maths, french, history, drawing and sewing would all be taught in a girls school, but i am doubtful about cotillion.  They might have had ballroom dancing classes though.  Geography and science are other subjects that would probably be taught, and in a girls school cookery as well, though it was usually refered to as Domestic Science in those days.<br>  <br>  Swearing was not as common in the 1940s as it is now, that is it was not considered polite to swear in company, and men for instance were gnerally careful not to swear in front of women.  Children would be strongly discouraged from swearing.<br>  <br>  A 1940s teenager in America would probably go to the cinema at least once a week, most people did in those days.  They had continuous performances, that is you could go in any time and stay as long as you liked.  Usually there would be the main feature, a supporting film, a newsreel, and a cartoon. She might go out dancing, dance band music was very popular, and owing to the shortage of male musicians, there were some all-girl dance bands in the war.  Also owing to the shortage of male partners, girls sometimes danced with other girls.<br>  <br>  At home she would listen to the radio, which was very popular.  Radio personalities in those days were big stars just like TV personalities are nowadays.  She would listen to music and comedy shows and soap operas and plays and the news, and there would be broadcasts of sporting events too, if she is a girl who is keen on sport.  If she is a well off girl she might have her own record player and lsiten to the latest records by her favourite singers and dance bands.  And she will probably read a lot, with no computers, ipods, etc, people tended to read more than they do now.  Her friends would come around and they would listen to music togher, practice the latest dances, maybe experiment with makeup and hairstyles etc.  <br>  <br>  Rationing affected everybody.  Certain foods were in short supply, including sugar, coffee, butter, certain types of meat, and canned goods as well as things like gasoline, tires, and stockings.  Unable to find stockings, women began wearing leg makeup instead.  And since the stockings of the 1940s had seams down the back, women's magazines ran guides on how to draw a realistic-looking line down the calf.<br>  <br>  Civilians got stamps every month that gave them the right to buy different products.  "My mother and all the neighbors would get together around the dining-room table, and they'd be changing a sugar coupon for a bread or a meat coupon.  It was like a giant Monopoly game" said Sheril Cunning, who was a child during the war.<br>  <br>  Because of the gasoline shortage, your heroine would be more likely to walk to school or take the bus, rather than being driven, even if she was from a wealthy family.  Or she might have a bike, people rode them more in those days than they do now.  In fact, people were generally a great deal less dependent on cars to get them around than they are nowadays.<br>  <br>  If her father is wealthy he might be some kind of businessman, own factories or something, or perhaps be on Wall Street or something like that.  Or he might be a succesful lawyer or doctor, or something creative like a writer or artist or architect.  Depending on his age, he might be away in the army.<br>  <br>  There were drugs in those days, but it would be difficult for a teenager to get hold of them, I don't think teenagers generally had as much money as they do nowadays, and they were more closely watched by the adults around them.|`|UhAHaOWFaa	There were bad/unruly teenagers but it was very rare because punishments were harsh.<br>  <br>  An 18 year old commiting murder in the 1940's would be locked up for life or even face the death penalty for the crime.|`|0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	I would imagine there was a lot of swearing because this was the time of World War II.

If someone dies, either his/her life has come to an end or his/her body are now changed into something else, the molecules of that person will be part of a tree or an animal perhaps.<br>  If a relationship ends, it ends for the people involved or it changes their lives from being a couple to being single.<br>  Even if the universe stops existing as we know it, it will not be gone, it will have changed into something else. So its hard to answer.|`|loBIruvbaa	well most things, but like the numbering system it doesn't stop.

PFncnta2aa	INCEST BABY.|`|OdoLSDlXaa	If you integrate scientific theory and the Bible story, we could say that adam and eve were the first cro-magnon people.  They were likely related.  When Adam saw Eve for the first time he said, "Why this is bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh." <br>  Their children may have married relatives or non cro-magnon people like Neanderthals.  All the non cromagnon people eventually died out or were wiped out.  So what is left is the great greats as you said.  If you look back far enough, we are all related.  Both the Bible and Darwin say that.|`|JAZnQJPHaa	These were only the people who believe in the Abrahamic faiths, as set out in the Old testament, and even Kain fled and met other people he wasn't related to. It's just a creation "story", like many myths and ledgends of many cultures. For the rest of us, evolution of our species requires more than just two individuals to create a viable breeding population.|`|fqE8NfEFaa	There was no first man or woman, who told you that, God? I doubt it.<br>  <br>  <br>  We are related to everything|`|hmrtS8GIaa	there is two easy answers here.<br>  <br>  1) we are all inbred<br>  <br>  2) the story of the first man and woman is false<br>  <br>  come to your own conclusion|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	Since you seem to be referring to the Biblical account of creation, let's look a litter further at that.<br>  <br>  Take a peek at Genesis 1:14.  Cain says, "Today you are driving me from the land, and I will be hidden from your presence; I will be a restless wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me."<br>  <br>  Now think about that for a moment. If the only people on the planet were Cain, Abel (now dead), Adam, and Eve, who is Cain referring to... who is this 'whoever' that might find him? Why would God have to mark Cain so that people knew who he was? Surely his own parents aren't going to get confused about the issue.<br>  <br>  What most scholars take from this exchange is that even at the time of Cain and Abel there are already many, many people spread so much throughout the lands that they could be strangers to each other. We know that Adam and Eve were FIRST, but it never really says that they were the LAST to be created. For all we know, God may have made thousands and thousands of people, just as he made many, many animals and plants instead of just two of each kind.<br>  <br>  There are also Biblical scholars who argue that back in those days incest was not quite so uncommon nor deleterious as it sometimes is today. Keep in mind that everyone on Earth gets killed during Noah's time and his daughters are explicitly described as bearing Noah's children to help repopulate the planet. So it goes.<br>  <br>  And of course other accounts of how we got here have different spins on the question.  The evolutionary account, for example, would hold that there wasn't really a single first man and first woman, but rather many groups of men and women who changed over time.|`|RFGGBtp5aa	i thought people grew from trees?

9GHhc9SBaa	Explain a little more what you have to do :) Like a montage could be a video montage or like collection of pictures...? I really wanna help out but I need more info :D<br>  <br>  Okay: when I hear pride I automatically think of Snow White's Wicked stepmother. I see her purple makeup, her tall stance and that crazy look.<br>  My second interpretation of it would be the lion with an emphasis on it's mane. I see a growling beast shaking it's beautiful fur as if showing it off.<br>  Now what I like to do is a complete mix up of all my ideas so what I WANT to see when I hear the word pride is an extremely vain woman, very tall with thin limbs (SW's stepmother image). She's dressed in a long purple dress and looks at herself with pride in the mirror. She's so proud that she looks at the reflection with disdain because it's only a copy of her flawless beauty. Then I see her put on a coat with a hood (reference to the lion's mane), she walks around with slow threatening steps, you can almost imagine a small growl deep in her throat. Then she could see something she didn't like (a stain, another pretty woman,...) and she shrieks as loud as she can (back on the beast image), she yells and yells until her image just shatters like a mirror (I'm just grasping now, I'm out of ideas)...<br>  Okay well that's my interpretation of it, hope at least a part of it helps ^^<br>  Cheers!|`|wwzoqIvVaa	Being prideful has to do with the ego.

Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him; 19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats? 20 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man. 21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, 22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: 23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.<br>  Mark 7:5-23 (KJV)

Second, if she is performing her job correctly and her supervisor is happy with her job performance, then the rest is just crap. But I have a feeling that the hostility is being caused by this person not doing her job and putting extra strain on her co-workers because of it. I have seen it too many times, the "cute young thing" busy flirting and not paying attention to her work and sorry but that's what she's there for - to produce quality work. Women are not naturally hostile to each other, in fact good friendships usually spring up between women who work together. So there is some other underlying problem that you aren't seeing.

He drove British forces out of Toulon. He won several victories against the Austrians, and the overthrew directory and set up the Consulate.

In 1805, France prepared to invade England. <br>  Battle of Trafalgar- British admiral Horatio Nelson smashed a French fleet.

mzNLfY4Caa	Well!! I would start with watercolor! Draw something botanical. Like flowers plants, and draw that in watercolor. I have been obsessed with watercolor these past two days, and I am just recommending it to the whole world. The fortunate thing is that 4-6th grade works well with the medium. If you would like to do themes. I would say ocean- fossils- botanical- So far i've come up with science-like themes. Like if you do ocean - you could do a seahorse for a g. If you do fossils you could do some sort of bone for a letter, and you do botanical, you can morph any plant to any letter. <br>  <br>  Have fun! I would have LOVED for my school to sign up for that - take advantage and hope someone wins!

Commercial stuff to stay drunk.  Very outer fringe work for his time.<br>  Doyle was well traveled and educated.  He was part of the English aristocracy and had access to many areas of interest  like Scotland Yard as well as the newspapers as a writer.<br>  He was analytical and methodical.  Some of Holmes moodiness is compared with Poe because of the drug use.<br>  Doyle live a long interesting life while Poe died broke and in misery.<br>  Both self inflicted.|`|6mSEY6fZaa	Something to note would be that Poe is considered the inventor of detective stories/fiction.

From what i've seen you can have one or another, or you can combine both it mostly depends on what the team really needs.<br>  <br>  also for website you could check out, i think 3d total would be really great(obviously for 3d stuff), as well as finding some concepts. for concept art go to conceptart.org and join their forums and ask for as much help as possible<br>  <br>  i hope that helps

I didnt read the thers.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also if you think this is going to be boring then any book you read is going to be boring.  I love read books when taking the train to work everyday.  you get to use you imagination.|`|ac2x3YbLaa	Animal Farm and The Lord of the Flies.<br>  <br>  Actually, none of them are all bad, but of the ones listed, given that you don't seem to be interested in any of them, those two have a bit more action while being very short, especially compared to the Yearling or Tale of Two Cities.<br>  <br>  Raven|`|KCpGsN2faa	A Tale of Two Cities or To Kill a Mockingbird are not "lame". A Tale of Two Cities has everything in it; revenge, murder, love, drama, etc. To Kill a Mockingbird is great because it helps you better understand racism back in the day when it was really bad.|`|mTRnOIodaa	I've read Lord of the Flies and To Kill a Mockingbird, Lord of The Flies was very good but To Kill a Mockingbird was one of the worst books I have ever read! I have also heard that Animal Farm is a good book hope this helps :)|`|79YQAbSRaa	I didn't think any of the ones on your list were lame or boring :) but I'm a serious bookworm.<br>  <br>  Definitely Lord of the Flies, and either Animal Farm or To Kill a Mockingbird.|`|oL9HDPveaa	To Kill A Mockingbird, A Separate Peace, or Animal Farm. Pick two of those, All three are really good. Especially the first and third.|`|SFhITXHMaa	How are they lame?  I'd say Animal Farm.  Orwell's awesome.|`|IDHxfPKIaa	Oh, man... some of those are really good! To Kill a Mockingbird is a GREAT book, and it would probably be the most interesting for you. A Tale of Two Cities and Jane Eyre are two of my favorites, but the language is a bit older (Victorian England, and so on) and therefore you might have a harder time reading it if you're not used to the era. I haven't read the others, though I should get around to it, but they're also said to be pretty good. A Separate Peace always sounded really cool. <br>  <br>  Don't worry about what you've heard about books to read for school; sometimes they're boring, but a lot of the time they're much more interesting than you could have imagined. Just start reading, immerse yourself in the story, and any one of these books will be a great choice.|`|P3HzBRglaa	It really depends on the kind of books you like to read,<br>  but I would have to pick To Kill a Mocking bird out of all of these.<br>  It's the least of all those evils.<br>  It's still kinda boring, but less so than the others.<br>  AVOID LORD OF THE FLIES AT ALL COSTS!<br>  (Don't forget, this is PURELY my opinion.)<br>  <br>  Happy Reading! :)|`|W7ZUz9araa	a tale of two citites is way to hard so dont<br>  i would suggest how to kill a mockingbird|`|t8W2wf52aa	Since your a girl, I think you would like Jane Eyre, or To Kill a Mockingbird.

Rm9mII46aa	Good effort here, though there are some problems that stand out<br>  <br>  Your line breaks aren't working very well - you might want to take a look at them again. The first two lines, for example, would have much more impact as a single line - "Make me look away."<br>  <br>  The imagery is vague, and the reader has difficulty following. "Smoke writes Sorrow's song" doesn't come across. And why is "Sorrow's" capitalized? There's opportunity here for more vivid imagery...|`|oKsKKxeaaa	...And when our year has ended<br>  And I have gone away<br>  You'll often speak about me<br>  And this is what you'll say<br>  <br>  We sang in the sunshine<br>  You know, we laughed every da-a-y<br>  We sang in the sunshine<br>  Then she went on her way<br>  _______________________<br>  <br>  ...timeless lyrics from an old song and this wonderful poem you have penned reminded me of this mindset....only yours is much more poignant|`|wWL934E8aa	It reads wonderfully as you have written it, both silently and out loud.<br>  <br>  'Smoke writes Sorrow's song,<br>  plummeting...'<br>  <br>  Yes, I see/feel that line<br>  <br>  You have painted an excellent picture of the dreams.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	I love "Masochist hands,<br>  murderer's hands,<br>  small, strong, tainted,<br>  crimson gloves from shattered hearts."<br>  <br>  Don't touch me with those hands ...|`|8c8ca69ba60952337e6a67121fe756c9aa	Another's dreams are so hard to see, but there is no looking away. <br>  <br>  I wonder if the last line would work better as "fearing I'll hope" instead of "lest I hope."? The repeating of lest and the alliteration just seems a little too much for me, but it is just a suggestion.

It depends if you would like to draw very abstract and artsy things all over the shoe so you could a use a lot of color, or you can stick to a color scheme. I would like to draw a person on the shoe doing some sort of movement or "intellectual" pose. haha, but if you want to do more symbols on the shoe, here are some ideas of gay pride-<a href="http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art32097.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art3...</a> have fun!

mzNLfY4Caa	OH! They are not bad at all. I notice that everyone always puts their personal touch to it, and originality is the best. If you are drawing in black and white (pencil) I would just draw the starfruit, and have a leafy background. The starfruit creates such a beautiful shape that is very pleasing to the eye. If you decide to do it in color, I would say the kiwi, just because the green and the yellow look really nice together. The mango would also look good, but I feel like mangos just look like blobs. Kiwis have a shape and a pattern with the seeds and that is what would make the picture a whole lot interesting. Sorry, I wrote a lot.<br>  Basically my answer is:<br>  If in pencil: Starfruit<br>  If in color: Kiwi cut in half|`|dfjIBHe3aa	I would still treat the space the fruit is in as more important than the fruit itself.  If you can I would put both the Mango and the kiwi in it and possibly a bowl or something.

But i would say the best one is two halves of the kiwi. The star fruit is next best, then the mango, then the whole kiwi. As for the color of the skin on the kiwi, I'd say color the skin lightly with brown (i assume you're using colored pencils?) , then color a little bit harder with green, and then color over a little harder with brown. That should give it a brown skin with a slight green tint.|`|pUpJvJssaa	I liked the star fruit but I think the first Kiwi is the best.

I once saw a movie about that.<br>  -many women integrated the work force during WW II. After the war, some were widows and just kept their jobs. Others refused to quit their jobs and be confined to housekeeper's duties. These women were the first to initiate the women's lib movement. I know of this because my own grand-mother was one such widow.

6mSEY6fZaa	Jack Finch:<br>  Jack Finch is Atticus' brother who has no family but owns a female cat named Rose Alymer. He also studied medicine, and at times gives his service to Jem and Scout. He comes during Christmas time and is well-liked by both of Atticus' children. He teaches Scout and Jem to shoot the air-rifles their father bought them as Christmas presents. He realizes that Scout is using foul language and warns her that he will lick (spank) her if she doesn't stop. During Christmas at the Finch Landing, Francis (Alexandra's grandson) provokes Scout and she beats him up. After Jack hears about it, he spanks her. Later, at home, Scout tells him of what Francis called Atticus, and Jack apologizes. He is a doctor, and, like Atticus, moved away from the Finches' Landing, showing that he too is free from southern bondage. After Jack Finch punishes Scout for her bad language, Scout tells him the reason she used the foul language and he immediately wants to punish Francis. Scout admires his talent for telling a story to distract her whenever he treats her various bumps and bruises.<br>  <br>  Francis Hancock:<br>  Francis Hancock is Scout and Jem's cousin, the grandson of Atticus' sister Alexandra. (his father was Alexandra's son, Henry) When he visits during Christmas time, he upsets Scout by calling Atticus a "Ni**er-Lover." Scout is angry enough at this that she beats Francis up and swears at him, and is later punished by Uncle Jack for this.

3nUIQ3Chaa	I think you have to consult with the family of the person first.<br>  <br>  =]|`|yuuvBSKsaa	This is not a hard problem.   Because there's a good chance the family wouldn't mind if you bought the headstone, so long as you portray it as 'paying your respects'  rather than charity. <br>  <br>  Talk to the funeral home, work out all the details for the cost and configuration of the headstone your 'contributors' can afford. <br>  <br>  Find out which family member arranged the funeral <br>  & get  the 'document' the needs the signature.<br>  <br>  Go to the family member that arranged the funeral and say:<br>  "Some of ?Joe's? friends would like to pay their respects by purchasing his headstone.  We were thinking something like  ...<br>  Is that OK or is there something you'd like too add?<br>  <br>  If they like what you show them - then "Great Sign this & we'll let you know when they place it.<br>  <br>  Now if you encounter vast apathy, and you feel strongly.  It's easier to get forgiveness than permission.<br>  <br>  Which means while it's not strictly legal to place a headstone without family approval, you would be hard pressed to find a law officer who cared when the family did not.|`|QYPrM3GPaa	The best thing you can do is ask the family what THEY want to do about it.  They may not want outsiders like friends to do that for a family member - they may feel it is an intrusion.  So don't just go and do it without their knowledge and consent.  Family matters are always very private, and friends can often find themselves left out in the cold when it comes to these sensitive issues. Since the land that the grave is on, is probably private land, you have to ask permission of the landowner to begin with or you could be charged with desecrating a grave which can be a serious criminal offense.  You cannot just go to a cemetery and do anything you feel like there, regardless of your love and affection for the deceased. <br>  <br>  Here is another thing to consider - the person is dead and gone and I guarantee you they could care less whether or not there is a headstone on the grave. So cemeteries an graves are not for the dead, they are for the living - but there is more than what your rights are - it is the right of the family members to determine what is best for their kin and how they want the world to remember them - this is one of the most important and sacred rights of families and no one, not even friends, have a right to interfere with that.  It would be a very grave (no pun intended here) mistake to do anything to a grave of another without the advice, consent and wishes of the immediate family.  Respecting their wishes about the matter is the best thing you can do.<br>  <br>  You may find it may not just be a matter of not being able to afford a gravestone, it might be a matter of preference on their part - respect all their wishes and do not do something which you think is honorable, but which the family objects.  To violate family wishes is to get into something you do not want to be a part of.|`|8ekoa6szaa	It is NOT illegal and anybody who wants to pay for it can do it.  But it would be proper for you to ASK the family first if they object and, if they do, that should end the discussion.

I teach art and drawing is one of the things I do best.  But still, I always know that I can always get better.  So I have to practice as often as I can.  I love to show people that don't feel they have the talent the "blind Contour" approach.  It's when you only look at your subject but never pick up your pencil (or else you'd lose your place) and never look at your paper until your done.

It's when you look at your paper "only" when you have a question- like "am I still drawing on my paper?"These exercises losen you up and show you how well you really can draw when your not putting any pressure on yourself.<br>  I hope this helps- good luck!
w0M3GY6Yaa	Uh..... purleeez.... Couldn’t  u have written anything better. <br>  I mean I'm a Muslim and this story is kind of *ouch*, if u get what I mean.

Like I said, I’m a Muslim, and as this idea of “The Bible lies on this account” would not bode-well us and so it definitely would not work with the Christians. <br>  Apart from the main plot of the story, there is a lot of repetition and that’s not the way a story gains success. So, if u were still to carry on and ridicule the obvious facts, I would recommend u to add to the story something more than just repeating it over and over again!<br>  Im not a religious fanatic, yet I would suggest that u try ur hand at something good and worth reading and I’m sure u’ll do well.

yuuvBSKsaa	This is a bit like saying "Walking is painful, how do I cut off my legs?"<br>  <br>  Don't cut off your legs, take the rock out of your shoe.<br>  <br>  See Nature has gone to a greate deal of trouble to create that organ of memory know as your brain & it's just plain stupid to interfere with it's functionallity when all you are looking for is pain relief.<br>  <br>  Memory works like this.   The mind asscoiates a degree of emotional intensity to a sense data pattern based on the pleasure or pain that occured when the paterned was sensed.<br>  <br>  Pretty simple really, if the big dog bites you, the pain attaches fear to the image a big dog,  Actually the fear can be attached to any sense, e.g the smell,  sound, or the touch of the big dog. <br>  <br>  The fear can also be attahed to completly irrelevant senses, e.g. if you were bit on a rainy day,  you might begin to fear the rain.<br>  <br>  Fear causes you to avoid the sense data associated with pain.  Conversely desire causes you to persue sense data associated with pleasure.  E.g. if if was pleasureable to eat a chocolet chip cookie, then the smell will make you look for them.<br>  <br>  Now in general this is a good thing.  Avoid the pain, persue the pleasure, but sometimes the wrong thing gets associated.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's not all big dogs, just that one.  Maybe the rain had nothing to do with the pain.  Maybe the intensity of a given event is causing you to keep it fresh through repetition, when the probabiltiy of recurance is nil.<br>  <br>  See, the pain of a memory is in what emotion you associate with a given sense input & in how strong you allow that association to become. <br>  <br>  It's quite hard to erase a memory, but it quite easy to change or minimize the emotion you associate with it.<br>  <br>  Fat people associate cheesecake with the pleasure of eating it.  Thin people associate cheesecake with the social pain of being fat.<br>  <br>  So let's say a rival publicly insults the color of your eyes.  Now do you associate the pain of the attack to the color of your eyes or the face of your rival?  Do you replay the event endlessly or let it fade.<br>  <br>  See, if you buy into the rivals attack, you will feel pain every time you look in the mirror.  Ah, but if you associate the event's pain with the stupidity of your rival, your reflection causes you no pain at all.<br>  <br>  If you associate their attack with a loss of social staus,  their face engenders fear of such loss.  But if you think the attack made your rival look petty, their face may be associated with pity.<br>  <br>  Do not delete your memories, change your associations.|`|04bSzgxgaa	can we delete our bad memories? Can we turn them into positives?<br>  bad memories are what we make of them. They may be bad but, hopefully are in the past and can be used to measure what is now good in our lives. Feeling the pain is indeed hurtful but working through coping skills means it only hurts really bad the first time. Of course then there is the thing that who says its wrong to experience the emotion of sadness now and again?|`|I6dcRgD6aa	You don't want to delete them you just want to take the charge out of them. I use a method called EFT. Look it up under Gary Craig's site. You can also look it up on youtube.com & find out how to do this. I was in horrible pain & used it to get off of pain pills a year ago. I know so much about psychology so I am able to know what to say easily with this. I work over the phone with people & it it amazing. I actually have friends who are professional therapists who use this with their patients & say they get better results than anything else they use. It is like accunputure it that it works with the energy meridians of your body. We keep things on a cellular level. So if I have a horrible fear of my son traveling. I won't forget he is going away & what happened that makes me so fearful. I will use this method & tell him whatever I am concerned about but this time I am not afraid & can feel he is going to have a great trip. I can feel the way I do when he is not traveling for example. No anxiety....You can use this on grief, abuse, well, look it up & if you decide to e-mail me about it please remind me of your question.|`|AA12079397	If you are busy with your present memories then you can easily drive the past.|`|aOtiIgYSaa	talk to someone you trust...you can never forget memories, they are a part of you xx|`|lemCTR2Waa	Consult your doctor.

You can bring yourself to a point where bringing them up is no longer painful.  <br>  <br>  Though not tried personally,  I've heard a lot about 'Regression Therapy' as an effective tool...to come to terms with your past sans bitterness.<br>  <br>  Yes,  read somewhere about pills too.

This technique was developed by L Ron Hubbard and is defined and explained in detail in the book "Dianetics: Modern Science of Mental Health" by L Ron Hubbard. The technique is nothing short of brilliant and makes a huge improvement in your happiness, health and overall well-being! The book is available at every library in the world or can be bought at a bookstore.|`|ghMJyzsOaa	One can not delete memories, we can only shape the way we think and feel about what we have experienced. It is the power of thought and feeling, that we associate with the memory that makes it seem bad or good. The memory no matter how harsh it seems, can be reduced in its severity, by shifting our perception of it, to thoughts and feelings that make us feel better about the memory. You will need to train your self to be consciously aware of when those bad memories emerge and gently choose to see it in a different light.<br>  <br>  For example, someone once use to bully me when I was younger, and called me all kinds of names because I dared to be different. Initially, those words would linger in my mind and cause me to think and feel about myself in a very negative way over a prolonged period of time. I actually breathed life into those words, by looking at the way I conducted myself and if you look hard enough you will always find justification, which gives it even more power. <br>  I'm worthless, I'll never achieve, I lack ability I'm useless, No one likes me and I don't like my self.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am now worth much more than worthless. I am a unique spiritual being on a journey of exploration to again connect with myself. <br>  <br>  Everyday is an opportunity to achieve physically and spiritually.<br>  I have a wonderful ability to express my thoughts and feelings. I am only useless if I do nothing, but we are all doing something, we are all living, playing a part in a grand design. I love myself and because I love myself other are attracted to my self directed energy. <br>  <br>  Create positive thoughts, they can be applied to even those memories that are extremely painful, Only you can achieve this, you certainly have the power within yourself.|`|fqE8NfEFaa	Accept them, realize them, contemplate them. but more importantly understand that they are in the past, what is done is done.

QgE85Qynaa	What you have described is more or less what has been happening in Palestine (though to the best of my knowledge, nukes were never used or even developed at the time you describe- you might be confused with Israel's use of white phosphorus gas on civilian areas).<br>  <br>  As tragically ironic as it all is, Israel's technique of expelling Palestinians and replacing them with Israelis is horrifically similar to the Nazi's expulsion of Jews- replacing them with Germans. Indeed, the entire "Ghetto" system is being repeated on a much larger scale with the Israeli partition wall, particularly in the Palestinian-Christian dominated Bethlehem.|`|VNDZ04FGaa	I do not know where you received your information, but it is wrong.  <br>  <br>  The Nazis were a power hungry thugs who ruled by dictate under the control of 1 man, Adolf Hitler.  After the Nazis took power dissent was not tolerated and all opposition to his rule was eliminated.  The jews were the convenient scape goats to blame all the problems on and were easy to eliminate.  No one offered any help to them, not even the United States.  Who cares about a bunch of dirty Jews, no one.  <br>  <br>  The state of Israel was formed from the British protectorate of Palestine.  It is the only Jeffersonian Democracy in the Middle East Region.  Every one at the age of 18 must serve in the military and serve jury duty, no exceptions.  All citizens, jew, muslim or christian has the right to vote.  The President is chosen by direct democracy, but the Prime Minister is chosen by the Parliament.  The Arab leaders of the region do not like Israel because it shows them to be who they really are,  Nazi loving thugs who want to enslave their own people.  They have kept the trouble going by blaming the jews for all the trouble.<br>  <br>  The West Bank region was taken from the state of Jordanian as a buffer zone after the Yom kipur and the 6 Day wars.  The Golan Heights was taken from the Syrians at the same time to keep the Syrians from firing on Jeruslem with artillery.  The Gaza strip was taken from Eygpt along with the Siani to proct Israel from another midnight attack.<br>  <br>  The Palestians are bedouins who had no loyalty to any country,  At the foundation of Israel the Arab League (Eygypt, Jordan, Syria, Saudia Arabia, Lebenon, and Yemen)  promised the "Palestians" that if they would help in the war they would be given the conqured terriorty as their homeland.  The Arab League lost and the "Palestians" became "Refugees" that no one wanted.<br>  <br>  If you want to be angry with anyone, then be angry with all the members of the Arab League and their Tyranical rulers who are trying to stamp out the only voice of freedom in the Middle East.|`|45UxRjQtaa	I wouldn't go that far, but what is happeningg is their is a group of uncontrolledd idiots in Palestine that think they can do what ever they want, so they kill 2 people in Israel, and Israel goes ok wanna play it that game you kill 2 people and will blow up one of your schools were you must be training terrorists because there is a school full of arab kids, they all MUST be shoe bombers?<br>  <br>  Israel really needs to control themselves as i have lost family over there and it is getting a Little ridiculous how they are free to do what ever they want but their not terrorists?<br>  <br>  I just don't agree with the worlds hatred toward Palestine.|`|5890d2376c393292b88b2d9e0c4d40ebaa	nukes? what are you nuts?|`|eebe66a3a4bd4b0bbf8c0da45b2f62abaa	I don't recall the Jews launching rockets at German civilians from behind the Warsaw Ghetto walls...<br>  <br>  I also don't recall the Nazis withdrawing in spite of overwhelming military successes.<br>  <br>  BTW:  When did anyone use nukes?<br>  <br>  Did you know that there are 1.3 Million Arabs living in Israel?  And, they have full voting rights and representatives in the Israeli legislature?  I don't recall the Jews having that in Germany under the Nazis.|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	No.<br>  <br>  Your understanding of what happened in Lodz is very good.  Your understanding of the current situation is clearly inadequate at the least, and incorrect and horribly biased at the worst.  And comparing what the Nazi's did to the Jews with the current situation is obscene.
AA11114869	At least one movie on Nietzsche has been produced, - and quite recently...<br>  <br>  A movie adaptation of Dr. Yalom's book, WHEN NIETZSCHE WEPT, was released in 2007.<br>  It received mixed reviews and, as for my self, I was more than a little  disappointed with the movie; just about every element of the production was overplayed, - the most evident being the ridiculously strong accents used mercilessly from  beginning to end.<br>  Though it tries, - the movie does not do Nietzsche any justice; perhaps because the movie just simply tried too hard to do just that.<br>  <br>  The real question, then, - still remains:<br>  "Will a good movie on Nietzsche ever be made?"<br>  -|`|AA11564934	If jennifer Aniston got totally naked in it, it'd be the biggest hit of the decade.|`|AA11635601	If I had to choose between watching a movie on nietzsche or watching workmen clean out a sewer for six hours I'd have to flip a coin.|`|2z1h5mfOaa	As a generalisation, he was quite nihilistic and sarcastic about society, e.g. "The advantage of a bad memory is that one enjoys several times the same good things for the first time."

If the problem persists, then there may be a problem with your tuners and/or bridge. They also sell string stretchers online and possibly at your local music store. Every now and then you may find the nut is binding the string which is easily fixed with a file or sandpaper.<br>  <br>  The G string is notorious for going out of tune the easiest. I can honestly say that once I had a Floyd Rose locking tremolo on my guitar, I never really had that problem anymore unless I didn't stretch it out first or the string was bad.|`|LFC1AcmGaa	Mine goes out on my Gibson SG too XD...yeah just get it changed.|`|1j7QLM7Saa	well, in the heat strings untune themselves, but most likely its not tight enough, or.... u need a new string

ky3B42f6aa	It could be either Polish or Russian -- or even Ukrainian.<br>  It all depends on the original spelling.  But my gut instinct for languages tells me that it is Polish.  One reason being that there is a Captain Gustofski mentioned in Swedish documents. And, as you well know, Sweden is directly north of Poland, separated only by the Baltic Sea.<br>  <br>  "Gustof" is a first name all around this area, spelled usually "Gustav" in Swedish.  But other variants abound.  The worst maritime disaster in the history of the world was when the ship called the "Wilhelm Gustloff" was torpedoed by a Russian submarine at the end of WW II, drowning over 9.000 people -- 5,000 of which were children. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|0HAn67yZaa	it's polish, polish names always end in "ski"|`|7ONKVbbiaa	your comment hits the nail on the head, that many names will NOT be limited to a single country. (Something I rant about, often). <br>  What I did find, on familysearch.org, that no one of the name has died in the US in the last 50 or so yrs (the time frame since the social security death index starts). On the other hand, I found Jacob Gustofski, was a miner, who died in an accident in 1892, in Pennsylvania. So, at least one man of the name did come to the US, perhaps had daughters only, who died under a married name. That is just a guess. <br>  And you might be asking about someone from another country. <br>  In general.. an ski ending suggests maybe Polish, but can also be Russian. If you were looking for your ancestor, and it happened to be Jacob, the correct answer will be, wherever Jacob was born. IF (and big if) he immigrated to the US after 1880, he won't be in that census..and he died before the 1900 census. If he did leave any children in 1900 census.. THAT record would usually name the place of birth for the parent. If he was naturalized before his death, that would be another place to search. <br>  You can edit your question, if you like.. to narrow down if you are working for a certain person/ ancestor and with that, we might be able to figure out a record online to find the right answer.

TAIlyvgyaa	I don't think of Edward Cullen.<br>  <br>  Ever.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I think most people with a decent level of exposure to literature can agree that Meyer's characters are very poorly written. What irritates me is not so much the quality of the character, but how young girls swoon over him as some kind of fantasy man. Honestly, Meyer should be ashamed for putting this kind of character in front of impressionable young girls. Since Bella is an empty Mary Sue that any reader can step into and say "That's me!," girls get swept up in the fantasy that there's this "perfect" man out there who will love them unconditionally and save them every time they stumble over a crack in the sidewalk -- and that's a powerful idea to put in front of these young ladies who can relate to feeling awkward or "not pretty" or whatever, as they make the transition into young adulthood. <br>  <br>  The problem is, they're too young to have any concept of what a real relationship is. They think they want one like Edward and Bella have, but Edward and Bella have a relationship based on control and obsession. That's not love. Not even close. Not to mention, any way you slice it, Edward is a stalker. He's a 100-year-old vampire who watches a 17-year-old girl while she sleeps. In real life, you'd be calling the cops on him.<br>  <br>  I don't care if Meyer wants to change the attributes of vampires. If she wants to make them glisten in the sun or call them "vegetarians" when they only eat animals instead of humans, well, fine. But at least make the premise realistic. No one has yet given me a good reason why a 100-year-old vampire, who's been all around the world, would be the least bit interested in a 17-year-old girl who's clumsy, plain, and by her own admission, nothing special. Is it just because her blood smells yummy? Give me a break!|`|oL9HDPveaa	Maddie--while reading a book, people are supposed to be enjoying the plot, the elements, anything but obssessing over one character. That one character alone would provide for an awful book. A good book is made up of many different parts. <br>  <br>  As for Edward Cullen, I don't see why anyone would want to be with him. He is not, by any means, perfect. And even if he were...who wants someone perfect as a boyfriend? You could never live up to them and you'd never have any fun.|`|yLkU8crqaa	Edward Cullen, the greatest creeper ever to creep this mostly creep populated world. Not only is he a creeper, he is a womanizer. He gets so protective, I was afraid he would go insane if she got a paper cut.|`|hCqJMe9xaa	If Edward Cullen was a real person he would be the sexiest person ALIVE! And everyone would fall for him just like they fall for Rob because he played Edward. tehehe. I'd go out with him, and since he would be a vampire makes it all the more sexier.|`|PzaJO1Ekaa	jack the ripper could learn a few tricks from this guy. this is the ultimate stalker.|`|ac2x3YbLaa	Eddie needs to grow up.<br>  <br>  He is 100 years old and still drooling over high school girls for god's sake.  He stalks the bimbo, and actually turns the twit...  Which, although they give "turning her" a nifty name, means he killed her.  Oh joy.. she gets to be an undead abomination forever.<br>  <br>  To be perfectly honest, I found the whole vampire bit in the Twilight series to be disgusting.  Vampires are supposed to be scary.  They are predators that feed on humans, not pathetically wimpy little smucks that wander around being Emo.<br>  <br>  They don't "sparkle" in sunlight, they aren't that nice and they don't often go around protecting stupidly ignorant little girls who can't do anything for themselves.<br>  <br>  They are wolves, hunters, and humans are merely another food source, even Anne Rice knew that.  For a wolf to take an interest in a human as anything more than dinner, they have to be something special and once they enter the predator's world, it's a violent place and they have to be able to stand on their own two feet, which bella couldn't do with crutches.<br>  <br>  Eddie, as written by Meyers, is nothing but a fan girl's fantasy, a romantic dream.<br>  <br>  Harlequin should have been her publisher, at least then we would have known before we picked it up and read the first chapter that it was nothing but rose coloured glasses of a love story.|`|O97uZDN5aa	Yeah edward is the most uninteresting character i have ever read about. He is emotionally abusive and the only good thing about him is his looks, which cancel out all his flaws (in Bella's eyes). it's sad that girls my age think that edward is "romantic".|`|P9S5wlLyaa	Poorly developed character in a poorly developed series of books.

Or maybe your favourite movie just change details and make it your own.|`|AA11798922	Start with "It was a dark and stormy night" and end with "and they all lived happily ever after."  Now you need a Hero, an anti-hero(or problem), and somebody to rescue.  In your opening set up Hero and situation with a little back story to develop character and make your reader care about your story.  Spend about half your book building to the climax.  This is where you add the plot twist.  But don't bring it out of thin air, the plot twist needs to hinted at from the beginning.  After the plot twist your hero still needs to save the day by the skin of teeth, while not seeming too implausible.  Now you tie up any important loose ends while leaving some room for a sequel.  <br>  <br>  I am thinking Christian Bale for the Hero, Meghan Fox as a damsel in distress, and Jack Nicholson or Kevin Spacey for the Evil business man.

You can even do sections of the body. Like have different sections of different people making one. You can even have different skin tones, and have the person doing different body movements in each part of the body. I'm sure you can squeeze that on the paper. =]

From the moment the door of the room at the top of the stairs is opened for her by sympathetic and sensitive housekeeper, Mrs Pilton, imaginative and lonely Sabrina conjurs up an entire history revolving around the room's previous inhabitant, Hilary Shenstone. The Shenstones own Nuns Farthing and the youngest son, Hilary is off in India carrying on in his father's dangerous tradition of intrepid Englishman working for the Home Office. As Sabrina thumbs through Hilary's library at home, we glimpse a bit of the adventure of Hilary's life as his plane goes down miles away from Nuns Farthing. Instantaneously, thoughts of his childhood mysteriously and irrationally capture his mind, and Hilary finds this inexplicable longing compells him to make the long journey home. After much soul-seeking and understanding, Hilary reconciles with his old life and moves towards his new one back at the home of his childhood. When he arrives, Mrs. Pilton recognizes him on sight and sends him with her blessings up to his old room where she knows Sabrina innocently awaits. And as Hilary first lays eyes on the lovely fresh-faced girl, he realizes why he was driven to make this homecoming---this is the girl he is destined for, the ONE he has been waiting for up until now to make his wife. Sabrina already half in love with him from her own imaginings, cannot help but fall for him, head over heels. Magical halycon days lie ahead for a couple star crossed in their love for one another . . .except for one slight detail . . . Hilary died in the plane in India.<br>  Sound intriguing? It is. Written in a sweet yet unsentimental way that is perfect for all age groups, the story moves along swiftly, keeping the reader wondering 'what is to become of the two lovers?' living on different planes. The likeable characters epitomize the era between the World Wars; the politeness and sensibilities portrayed enhance Sabina's wistful frustrations and emphasize Hilary's desperate need to make this one last connection work. <br>  This bittersweet love story is recommended to all who love spending a rainy afternoon watching romantic black&white films while fantasizing about that perfect lover.

AA11114869	All one has to do is imagine what contemporary societies would now be like if the 'integrated circuit' (aka:  'computer chip") had never been invented, - and the mind reels at all of the ramifications, both detrimental and beneficial...<br>  -|`|tsjLHXzUaa	It would be much like life at the end of the 19th century.|`|h2HxsSJ5aa	There would be limited electrical power and steam propulsion with airships along with telephony and telegraphy, and primitive internal combustion engines.  Concerning the First World War, that's interesting because one issue was that the weapons technology was ahead of the military strategy, so one way to look at it is that whereas World War I would have happened because it was about European powers squaring up against each other and spoiling for a fight, the nature of the war could have been different.  The chief differences might be thought to be the absence of heavier-than-air aircraft, the lack of tanks, no gas attacks and, perhaps most importantly, no machine guns.  However, machine guns did exist.  The Maxim Gun was invented in 1862 and was used in warfare, notably the Boer wars, and it's the Boer wars that are probably the most relevant to this subject.  The Second Boer War occurred right at the end of the nineteenth century, so it's a good example.  It was between the British Empire and South Africa, and interestingly, it involved the first concentration camps.  I'm afraid i don't know much about the Boer Wars, because they are the first historical event i heard about through personal hearsay and so i don't have a good feel for them.  They are basically my grandmother's first memories.<br>  <br>  Air raids were carried out using airships at the beginning of the First World War, so it would have been possible to carry out air raids in some form.  Part of the problem with considering this issue is that the effect of war is to accelerate technological change.  Why would both sides persist with primitive machine guns when it would be possible to develop more efficient weapons and the impetus to do so was there?<br>  <br>  Anyway, the Second World War occurred as a direct result of the First.  The punitive Treaty of Versailles led to economic collapse in Germany which in turn led to the rise of Nazism.  If Germany hadn't lost so badly, this might not have happened, and less efficient weapons technology could have meant that.  However, political attitudes of the time would entail that sort of behaviour.  Note, however, that concentration camps and air raids, two major features of World War II, are compatible with nineteenth century technology, and whereas chemical warfare may not have existed, that would also have meant that weapons of mass destruction were more acceptable.  Clearly, we're not talking about nuclear weapons but biological warfare could still occur because it used to be waged in the form of plague victims being used in trebuchets in the Middle Ages.<br>  <br>  However, a Second World War waged with older technology would have meant no cold war and no arms race, and consequently things would be very different in that way.<br>  <br>  There is another aspect to this, however.  The Holocaust was so extreme that it meant that various things became much less acceptable, including racism and prejudice against the disabled.  Without the efficiency of the technology used in the later concentration camps, and possibly the complete absence of Fascism as an ideology, there would have been no Holocaust.  Without that, ironically, such policies as open racism and the sterilisation of the mentally ill and physically disabled, might have seemed more acceptable and been widely practiced.  Therefore, there might have been no civil rights movement and institutional racism would have remained the norm.<br>  <br>  Therefore, life today would be very different.  There would have been a first world war and possibly a second, then possibly later wars pursued by means of biological weapons of mass destruction.  Segregation would still exist in the US, the British would still be an imperial power and it would be acceptable public policy to sterilise and possibly even abort and euthanatise the disabled and people with learning disabilities.  On the positive side, there would have been no cold war, but bear in mind that that would probably also mean that the Soviet Union, China and the Warsaw Pact countries would still be Stalinist.|`|8ekoa6szaa	You can not only forget the internet, you can forget things that you take for granted like air conditioning, washers and dryers, telephones (never mind cell phones!), medicines like insulin and penicillin.

draNVjbkaa	If you're pursuing acting just to get famous, then you're already in the wrong business.<br>  <br>  But to help you:<br>  READ:<br>  "ACTING IS EVERYTHING (GOLD EDITION)"-JUDY KERR<br>  <br>  "SO YOU WANT TO BE IN SHOW BUSINESS?"- STEVEN R. STEVENS<br>  <br>  "ACTING TRUTHS AND LIES" (purchased at www.info4actors.com)<br>  <br>  TRAINING<br>  I think the first three classes that you should take before even engaging in a scene study/acting class are: Cold Reading, Commercials, and Improv.<br>  <br>  Why a cold reading class? How do you get the role? By auditioning! Auditioning and acting are two DIFFERENT worlds! In L.A. especially, the majority of your auditions are cold reads. You're lucky if you can get the sides the night before. Cold reading teaches you how to make sense of the script within a short period of time and also with in a limited space (you don't physicalize as much on auditions as you do when actually do the scene). After you get the part, you can always get an acting coach.<br>  <br>  Why commercials? Because those are the money jobs. Build your foundation with commercials so you can afford the best training and materials needed for a successful acting career. Commercials also don't require you to bust out your Meisner or Strasberg techniques. The commercial cds and clients just want to see real people.<br>  <br>  Improv is a must period. It teaches you how to not be self conscious, to use your imagination, and to make bold and quick choices. It also goes great with commercial auditions for a lot of them are improv.<br>  <br>  Here are some of the best schools in Southern California:<br>  <br>  Cold Reading (Ranked from Top to Bottom)<br>  -Margie Haber<br>  -Brian Reise<br>  <br>  Commercials (Ranked from Top to Bottom)<br>  -Hey, I Saw Your Commercial!<br>  -Stuart K. Robinson<br>  -Carolyne Barry<br>  <br>  Improv (All three are great)<br>  -Groundlings<br>  -Second City<br>  -Upright Citizens Brigade<br>  <br>  Scene Study/Acting (It varies. Some schools are not for everyone. Chubbuck and Howard Fine are not for people who aren't fan of Strasberg or Uta Hagen. Playhouse West and Joanne Baron/DW Brown are more Meisner oriented)<br>  <br>  -Beverly Hills Playhouse<br>  -Howard Fine<br>  -Stella Adler<br>  -Ivanna Chubbuck<br>  -Joanne Baron/D.W. Brown<br>  -Tom Todoroff<br>  -Playhouse West<br>  <br>  Stay away from those OVERPRICED "Acting/Modeling Schools" like JRP, John Casablancas, and Barbizon. There are BETTER and more AFFORDABLE schools. Of course you can have those three scammy schools on your resume and get LAUGHED OUT of LA and any other MAJOR market.<br>  <br>  <br>  To get an agent, you need to get GREAT headshots, a good resume, and training from the best. These are enough to get you a commercial agent at least. Getting a GOOD theatrical agent (Film/tv) takes longer. Most good theatrical agents won't see you unless you're SAG, have a polished resume, and a demo reel. Commercial agents are more lenient about that. What the best Commercial agents want to see on your resume are good commercial classes, improv, and cold reading.<br>  <br>  You can get an agent multiple ways. Here are a few common ways:<br>  -Attend a showcase and impress them<br>  -Mail in an unsealed manilla envelope with a CONCISE coverletter and headshot with the resume stapled on the back. If you have a demoreel include that too.<br>  -Get a referral from a friend who is with the agency that you're interested in<br>  <br>  DON'T<br>  -Email them unless they tell you to. IT'S UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Call unless they tell you to. ALSO UNPROFESSIONAL!<br>  -Walk in and ask for a meeting. UNPROFESSIONAL THREE!<br>  -Sign with them if they ask for upfront money, make you take new photos with THEIR photographer, or take THEIR classes. Agent's ONLY make money when you do.

ip5EWw7uaa	The classic response was: 'we've got to show 'em we are not afraid' (them being the enemy). Churchill's line was 'Britain can take it'. Of course this was all propaganda - many people were terrified and many never recovered from the ordeal. The problem was that you had no choice - and it is surprising how most people took it in their strides. The government's mass observation programme provides a fascinating insight into how people were really reacting.<br>  <br>  In London the authorities were worried that people might take to the tubes and never come out - which is why they were not used as shelters in the beginning.

j5Apt8hWaa	All the Olympus DSLR's are excellent cameras for the advanced amateur photographer.<br>  <br>  The new 4/3rds cameras were never meant to be a professional camera.  The sensor is too small and the number of available lenses do not support the shooting requirements of  working pros.  I have seen the adverts showing that the water resistant Olympus E-3 (they call it splash and dustproof) and I am sure that there are a few pros who might find that aspect endearing, but it all comes down to the size of the sensor and available lenses, when pros choose a new DSLR<br>  <br>  For pro cameras look to the Nikon and Canon systems.  Their sensors are larger (full frame on the pro models) and support not only over 60 current lenses available for both brands, but a host of good used lenses going back over twenty years for Canon's and over fifty for Nikon's|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	I agree with both the previous answers... but want to add this.  Professional quality can be defined in a couple of ways...  did you mean the quality in how the pictures are?  Or the quality of the camera itself?  <br>  <br>  Yes you can get professional quality pictures from an e410<br>  <br>  Most professional camera do use metal bodies.<br>  <br>  Another factor that was overlooked is what the camera will be used for. That will determine if the camera is out of it's league|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	The images from the E410 would be the same quality, or even better, than those made with a Nikon or Canon with the same megapixel count.  Some reponders to quesitons on camera in Yahoo have strong prejudices.  Being truthful, Olympus has long been known as having the best lenses in the SLR marketplace.  <br>  <br>  I would have to say that if you took pictures in a professional manner with the 410 and someone took the same pictures with a Nikon or Canon of the same mp count, that there would be no one who could really tell the difference in the pictures.  <br>  <br>  The whole argument that Fhotoace uses about the 4/3 aspect ratio is bogus also.  Pro photographers don't live with their Nikons and Canon alone, they also have medium format and/or large format cameras.  <br>  <br>  Medium format is available in 6x6 (aspect ratio 1:1), 6x7 (aspect ration of 6:7), 645 (aspect ratio of 6:4.5) and even larger 6:8 and larger still.  None of those are 3:2 which is what the 35mm format is.

iNqOsh1Naa	There are in fact direct references in the novel to Jake's impotence, caused by his war wounds. The most obvious one I can think of is his conversation with Georgette, the prostitute, but there are others as well. One is an aside to the reader, and there are one or two references in conversations with Brett. Another slightly more oblique reference is the scene where the bulls are brought in in Pamplona and calmed by the steers (gelded bulls). In fact, all of the bullfighting action directly parallels the actions of the characters.|`|AA10084471	What I don't find in the book is Fiesta.<br>  <br>  Yes, emasculation, a war injury.  But it is the way of the book to not be direct about that, and so you won't find a specific direct reference to it in the text.<br>  <br>  P.S. -- Cool.  I had no idea that the title Hemingway originally considered was Fiesta, and that the word was used in some non-US editions.   Here in the US the book was published simply as The Sun Also Rises.

She has two songs from her Silver Sea Album,  that might provide you with some stuff and not exactly mainstream. One is "You Brought Me Up" and the other is Five Fathoms Deep My Father Lies. You might try a song in another language, like Spanish. There is this really ethereal one called "Aire" (air) from Mecano, a Spanish pop band from the 80's. Ana Torroja, the lead singer has a unique voice. You might try Lagrimas Negras (black tears) from a flamenco singer known as El Cigala.  All of them talk about losses of one kind or another. Maybe Joanne Shenandoah's Mother Earth Speaks, will drive home the message that if we do not do something soon, we will lose our planet. I guess that loss would be catastrophic, and it is quite in touch with environmental issues, so prevalent nowadays.|`|c4r6jwLjaa	Let It Be by Carol Woods<br>  <br>  That is one powerful song|`|X4xUHPPYaa	dreaming with a broken heart by john mayer. i did a dance to this not too long ago and it was really pretty|`|AA12367393	widows in paradise...youll love it|`|0jKspgbVaa	Dearly Departed by Devotchka is beautiful and has exactly the right lyrics for what you're looking for<br>  Spiegel im Spiegel by Arvo Part actually has no lyrics but is so heartwrenchingly sad and beautiful it doesn't really need any<br>  Amen Omen by Ben Harper <br>  The Scientist by Coldplay is kind of overdone, but everyone loves it for a reason<br>  I Don't think I'll Ever Get Over You by Colin James Hay is a slower, acoustic vibe but the lyrics are really clear|`|encz34GYaa	Bye Bye - Mariah Carey|`|2V7HRd7Vaa	signs by bloc party<br>  guarantee it. message me and tell me if it works out for you!<br>  good luck! :]

zZxX5PXBaa	'White slavery' is a term that usually refers to the trade in European women to non-European cultures. So the reference is specifically to younger women taken into sexual servitude.<br>  <br>  There are records of people being taken into the Arab world that go back many centuries. In Victorian England the fear of white slavery was often exploited by newspapers and moralists. In modern times it's an aspect of trafficking, and while women are traded from and to pretty much every country, it remains (at least in folk mythology) a common view that white girls from western Europe and from North America are particularly desired by customers in the Middle and Far East.<br>  <br>  Humiliating people by taking their women and abusing them sexually is as old as human history. Given the way that Europe and the US has behaved towards the rest of the world, it's hardly surprising that people from other cultures would take pleasure in abusing women from Europe and the US.|`|ky3B42f6aa	Most of the Irish immigrants -- and the Polish -- had very low social standing, primarily because they were Catholics.  Also, their educational level was rather poor -- though not their fault.  With regard to the Irish, the common Irish child was not even allowed to go to a decent school (law by the British).  No wonder they represented an "ignorant class".<br>  <br>  All these "inferior" immigrants were slaves to the capitalistic barons of America.... doomed to work themselves to death for a pittance in coal mines, sweat-shops, and dirty factories.  <br>  <br>  Where you got the erroneous information about being slaves to the Muslims, I dunno.  There is a historical fact that many poor Irish souls in Baltimore [West Cork] were stolen away by Barbary pirates in 1631.<br>  <br>  Most people NEVER heard of any of this, so it could hardly be "shrugged off", as you claim.  Most people in America NEVER even heard of Baltimore, [West Cork≤≤], Ireland, either.

6rmLrZoEaa	Well, through books 1-4 we found out that 'A' is Mona, Hanna's supposed BFF. She hated all of the girls and wanted to get back at them. She found Allison's old diary in the trash when the new family moved into Allison's old house, and Mona learned all of their secrets. But she died at the end of Book 4, and now there's supposedly a new 'A'. <br>  <br>  I just got Wicked, the 5th book, but haven't had any time to read it, only skim through it and their definitely is a new 'A'. I know that their are three more books left in the series and then it will be over. The next book 'Killer' will be out June 30th, 2009. And from Shepard's past book releases, I'm guessing the 7th book will be out in December. <br>  <br>  Hope it helped!|`|wbeFJUbbaa	It tells you in the 4th book of the Pretty Little Liars Series.

After Ali died and Maya moved in mona found ali's old dairy in the trash pile outside and she knew about the jenna thing cuz the day it happened her and jenna were friends and she went there to surprise her but saw ali.<br>  (btw in the 4th book it tells you that ali and jenna set the firework thing up!!!)<br>  <br>  I HOPE THIS HELPED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Athens taxed them heavily, diminished their liberties and self governance, and repeatedly refused to aid them as was originally promised. Membership in the league was essentially compulsory, and refusal had dire consequences. Athens destroyed Melos for refusing to join. All adult males were killed, and the rest of the population was enslaved. This tyranny led in large part to the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War.

As a rookie, almost all of what you will learn at the beginning is best worked out on a drum pad because it makes almost no noise compared with a drum set. As a result, you won't disturb as many people, will have more places where you can practice and will therefore practice more.<br>  <br>  And make no mistake -- you will need to practice a minimum of 30 minutes every day without fail, including some days when you may practice for 2 hours or more.

Believing that someday things would be better could have helped.  Remembering their origins, their roots, could have been a source of strength.<br>  <br>      I am sure we will see some negative answers that will be in poor taste, but for once can we all just offer some respect and treat this question about dignity with......dignity?<br>  <br>          And don't forget that slavery is far from wiped out in today's world.

j5Apt8hWaa	If you are well versed in navigating Canon DSLR's, then stick with Canon.  The XSi is just the next generation of the XT Rebels, so it has features that are technologically more advanced than the predecessors.  If you are not attached at the hip to Canon, then take a look at the other provider of cameras and lenses to the pros, Nikon.  Go into a camera store and hold both in your hands and see which you like the best and then use their menus and see which is easiest for you to navigate and make common adjustments.<br>  <br>  <br>  That said, it is obvious that is will be your first fully adjustable camera, so you may want to consider buying the least expensive camera body and using your budget to purchase additional lenses.  In the end it is your lenses that describe your camera system and the fact that you will be upgrading camera bodies every three to five years, makes buying the latest and greatest body before you learn how to use a camera, a waste of money that could be spent on a second lens, good tripod, filters and even six to ten memory cards.|`|eFPnPZXIaa	You don't need a good camera to be good at photography.|`|jGOhUSBDaa	nikon d60's rawk|`|162603d72ddcf3279ac7690bc9b8ba0daa	You might want to visit a camera store and handle models from different names.

0LgpcOBDaa	Read the post called - I am about to start a photography business but I need equipments and Prices?<br>  <br>  Most cities and counties require a business license if your going to have a walk in place of business. If you work from home you may be able to side step this to a degree.<br>  <br>  As a walk in place of business you will need insurance, liability insurance in case a trip, fall or lights hit a customer. You will also want property insurance against theft, fire and a host of other things that could happen.<br>  <br>  A register business name to go along with the business license. If someone took you name, your dead in the water. Get the name registered with the county at a minimum, but I would go for the whole state at least.<br>  <br>  I assume you have equipment..? If not, you better have a pile of $$ or a rich uncle in the oil business to get some. Rent for your place and utilities..? Have at least 6 months worth in reserve, a year is better.<br>  <br>  I had a small walk in business for 10 years. It was not photo related but it was a freekin' nightmare all the small things that add up fast.<br>  <br>  Don't forget taxes. Business are taxed, sometimes monthly. You have to register all your equipment with the county tax assessors and pay a portion of their worth. The more ya have, the higher your tax is. However, when acquiring new equipment you also have deductions and deprecations you can now use.<br>  <br>  Travel, if business related can be deducted as well.<br>  <br>  There is more, a whole lot more.. You have to set down and THINK about it. Think of ANY business, the corner hardware  store, but substitute your business there but think of all the 'stuff' they need to BE a business (not the stock stuff). Phone. Lighting. Heating. Cooling. Advertising. Credit card service. Your inventory, and on and on..<br>  <br>  Good luck..

Opening a physical location will also require you to secure either financing or investment capitol, which will require you to provide a strong business plan, proof of insurance, credible references, and proof of your professional certification.<br>  <br>  What you will need, in terms of facility and equipment requirements, will depend greatly on what type(s) of photography you plan to offer. Your needs will be different depending on your discipline(s) of choice: portraiture, commercial, industrial, etc.<br>  <br>  This is a huge commitment and investment... consult your local business development institution for expert guidance.
ZB9zkbxxaa	Charles IV of Spain and His Family is an oil on canvas painting by the Spanish artist Francisco Goya, completed between 1800-1801. The work was modeled on Velázquez's Las Meninas when setting the royal subjects in a naturalistic, and plausible setting.<br>  <br>  As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work are apparently paying a visit to the artist's studio, while the artist himself can be seen to the left looking outwards towards the viewer. In both the artists is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. However, the atmospheric and warm perspective of the palace interior of Velázquez's work is replaced in the Goya by a sense of, in the words of Gassier, "imminent suffocation" as the royal family are presented by Goya on a "stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim smile, points and says: 'Look at them and judge for yourself!'"

34sidlx2aa	A good photo should be able to stand on its own with or without a title.   A bad photo is not going to be improved with a well thought out title.  <br>  <br>  However sometimes a title can add a depth to a picture that is not apparent from the image alone.  A very subtle image may gain depth from a good title.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	I do prefer simplicity and strong images, however I feel the wordy titles come from the frustrations of those not able to create the image they are envisioning to express their feelings.|`|0LgpcOBDaa	Shouldn't the image itself do the talking ?<br>  <br>  And often it does.

No, he didn't 'need' them, but a lot of his work "had" them. Moonrise over Hernandez is a classic example. Even though it is a very straight forward and factual name, it still has romance and a sense of poetry in it, AND, when spoken every one knows immediately which picture is being referred to. <br>  <br>  If Ansel Adams called it - Untitled - #4 or something, I don't think it would have cut it... Just as - Moon and Half Dome - If never seen, the name alone invokes curiosity and a wish to see it.<br>  <br>  As once said, it's all in the name..

QYPrM3GPaa	Perfectionism is a compulsion and an addiction.  It is a compulsion because you don't know why you need things to be that way and it is an addiction because you don't know how to get out of it.<br>  <br>  And if you don't think not walking into your living room for two months because a set of ornaments were different, I hope you think that one out again.  It was a major thing you did avoiding the living room over something which you know is basically meaningless.  <br>  <br>  I am telling you this because I myself am a compulsive addict about perfection, something which has plagued me most of my life - it brings me more grief than pleasure and no, nothing is 100% in this world, even my very own best - sometimes falls far short of my expectations and others.  I am EXACTLY like you are!  If I know the slightest thing is wrong or out of order, I am bugged to death by it.  It is the first thing I look at walking into a space.  If I know there is one little detail out of whack, I never stop glancing at it - until I DO something about it.  Or I get rid of it, out of site, out of mind.  It is what makes me such a good scientist - and I track every last detail no matter how small or big, I am excellent at organizing, classifying and detailing data.<br>  <br>  However, young lady, there comes a time in life when you have to be less harsh upon yourself and others - life does not evolve around perfection - life is flavored by differences, not by sameness.  Nature has a tendency to order things into groups (like rock and stone sizes in a stream bed), like the grains of sand on a beach all being about the same - but there is also unpredictable variability in nature, like the shapes of clouds, the way the winds can blow, the distribution and types of trees or plants and animals - order can be good up to a point, but then it can become very boring indeed.  It can turn everything into sameness.  It can ignore important differences which are needed in life.<br>  <br>  If everything were so neatly ordered, how then would life be if you and every other human - did exactly the same job, wore exactly the same clothing, liked only one color, ate only one kind of food, preferred only one kind of movie or passtime, etc etc - See?  Variety is the spice of life.  Diversity is the enrichment.  Being different is honorable and serves purposes. Nothing is perfect, even statistics says so - the highest level of probability of anything occurring by random measure is 99.37%, never 100%.  And THE most important law of the universe is the law of constant change - nothing remains static or the same, everything is always changing from something to something else.<br>  <br>  No one knows these things better than those of us, like you and I, who are bugged by all this random changing and diversity.  Nothing stands out in our minds more glaringly.  I know the compulsive feeling to put things in order, the cans of soup in my kitchen cupboard, the linen in my closets, the shoes in my shoe bin, the fact my shirts have to be smartly pressed and wrinkleless, every button the same...on and on, right?<br>  <br>  The only thing you can do, is to force yourself to accept a certain amount of messes in your life and learn to like them.  Don't wash the dishes on time always, don't order the cans in your cupboard, leave little messes for yourself - don't always pick up your socks off the floor.  Tell yourself you are being too predictable because if you continue on with this compulsion, others will be able to predict what you will think and how you will react, and that is a form of manipulation! Learn to be less predictable, more spontaneous, less reliable at times and more diversified.  This is something you will have to work on all your life because people like you and I, we never stop being compulsive about it really - it is in our nature to try to organize.<br>  <br>  One further thing - It can be unhealthy not just for your own self but for those who love you, to deal with compulsive perfectionism.  You can get ulcers this way, gray hair early, and give the same to everyone else  when you nag them to death about trivial details and short comings.  That is the worst part of compulsive perfectionism, the propensity to nag everyone to death about your perceived ideas of what THEIR failures are.  This, does not make you friends, and maybe that is exactly, what your friend was trying to get you to understand.  Sometimes, it is just plain better to see defects as good rather than bad, shut up and quick bugging others about perceived differences, lighten up and just let life be what it is, disorganized or not.<br>  <br>  Finally, nothing in life you do will ever be perfect always, and it is a waste of time, effort, energy, money and your health, to try to make them so.  Learn to be more tolerant, less critical, less demanding, less perfectionistic - take it from me, the big perfectionist!  I know what I am talking about, and I bet you do too! :)|`|1tccQF3gaa	on a scale from 'perfect' at one end of perfection itself to 'perfect' at the other end of perfection - I'd say try to limit it at about a third of the way there|`|2z1h5mfOaa	Most people have some level of obsession about things, or how/what we or other people do, and it's difficult to draw the line of what is normal.  In the first place, you need to be comfortable with yourself, so don't worry at this point unless there is some doubt in your mind.  The following is not a criticism, but from what you have described I would say that some people may indeed find it difficult to see you push yourself to be 100% perfect, because it does affect their relationship with you.  There is a very fine line between demanding perfection just from yourself, and this flowing over to expecting it from other people, and they may feel threatened because your feelings will be reflected in your opinions and expectations, and people may feel they can't live up to these, or they start to feel uncomfortable with it.  <br>  I'm just trying to reflect how or why people may react like your friend.  You should be the final judge on what you feel is O.K. for you.     <br>  Good luck!|`|EHozsofQaa	No, extreme perfectionism isn't normal. You should try to purposely leave things imperfect around you in your bedroom for instance, so you can get used to it, a little like a therapy. Perfectionism will just drive you miserable if you don't try to change. My mother in law is like that, and she's never happy about anything is this isn't perfect. So she spends 3 hours every day cleaning around the house and doesn't get to do the things she actually enjoys doing out of lack of time.|`|b6d230127e0ccf1489634c5dcf3bacdfaa	First you need to ask yourself what "normal" is and if it's something you desire.|`|9PA4f19gaa	I too do similar things.  My girlfriend likes to hang her pictures on the wall like a collage. She says its contemporary.  But, all I see is a mess on the wall.  I don't even look at the pictures because of how messy the wall looks.  I like my pictures geometrically centered on a piece of wall, like between furniture and wall edge or over a piece of furniture. <br>  Over time I have learned to overlook other peoples imperfections and imperfect habits as not many people I have known strive so much for perfection.<br>  This friend is not a true friend if they are trying to change who you are.<br>  Some people lack the hunger for perfection and if you don't avoid these kinds of people they will bring you down, take you out of the race if you will in your strive to reach it. <br>  In the end we should all do what makes us happy.   Lack of happiness is a lack of peace with one's self.  I'm at peace with my perfectionism and so should you be.|`|AA11564934	Oh please, normal?

Instead, check around your local colleges & universities & find a writing group which will offer critiques, feedback & inspiration.|`|kAqjxDHaaa	Nice. Like you said, it's a rough draft, so there are a few mistakes, but the outline is good. I'm already getting a  feel for these people, even though I hardly 'know' them. The formation of thoughts is good. It's slightly jumbled when the main character is embarrassed or completely blown away, which is good. It is pretty darn clear the rest of the time, which is also good.<br>    The story telling isn't bad, either. It takes you there. The only thing is I can't 'see' where 'there' is, so maybe a few more setting details would make it clearer.<br>    I would read this story, if it keeps upon the path and doesn't stray into the realm of boredom.

I used the scripture from Genesis (located just after the table of contents) because I loved the phrase "the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil." Isn't this exactly what Bella ends up with? A working knowledge of what good is, and what evil is. The nice thing about the apple is it has so many symbolic roots. You've got the apple in Snow White, one bite and you're frozen forever in a state of not-quite-death... Then you have Paris and the golden apple in Greek mythology—look how much trouble that started. Apples are quite the versatile fruit. In the end, I love the beautiful simplicity of the picture. To me it says: choice.<br>  <br>  Here's what she says about the New Moon cover:<br>  That is a ruffled tulip. As for the meaning... If you've read the Twilight FAQ, you know that the apple cover had a lot of meaning for me, and I was an active part of the covering process. However, that experience is more the exception than the rule in the publishing world. Something to keep in mind if you intend to embark on a career as a writer: lots of things you might expect to be under your control are not. Covers, for example. Those are mostly up to the publisher and the marketing and sales departments. So I don't know what the tulip means—I didn't have anything to do with this one.<br>  <br>  She doesn't say anything about the Eclipse cover.|`|3WCXGRaGaa	She has waht each mean on her website... the frist one is more of a bible idea of it throw... for the frist book. teh apple of the forbidden fruite adam adn eve take a bite out of and ya. just look it up on teh site... it explaines it all.|`|uth8Ztbdaa	Book covers always have something to do with "the story inside the book."|`|LykjWv6faa	Nope, just eye candy for teeny bops.

uJBnZWtcaa	Acting is "pretend".  Become the character and then the lines will seem more natural to you.  I once did a scene for a friend's Film Production class.  I'm a really mellow, easy-going, patient person but the character I had to play was high-strung, critical, really witchy and intense.  I had to start getting into character 2 hours before rehersal and filming. Afterwards, it would take me a few hours to get out of character again.  I didn't think I could remember the lines because I'd never say anything like that in real life but once I became her, it was easy.<br>  <br>  Also, have someone "run" the lines with you.  They read the other parts while you play yours.  Not only will this help you learn your lines but it's a great way to learn the cadence of the play - how fast and how slow it goes.  It helps you learn when to come in (start talking) because you get to listen for the "signal" words the other players will be speaking.  And the more you read the play, the more real it will become for you.<br>  <br>  Relax.  Stress is a memory killer.  Even the great actors often don't say their lines exactly as written.  Learn to take slow, deep breaths and blow them out very, very slowly.|`|XZ4RcUHWaa	Just practice.  Always say them out loud.

Early last year I started looking into what Kabbalah really was and I come to find out that so many myths surround Authentic Kabbalah which has nothing to do with red strings, holy water, religion, mysticism, magic, etc. <br>  <br>  Also anybody can study the wisdom (also can be called a science) regardless of age, gender, nationality, culture, race, religion, etc.. I can say that what I have found in Authentic Kabbalah has a struck a chord within me but only you yourself can choose what is "a sound path of truth" for your life. Check out the links below and I wish you well on your path...Peace. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah-video-clips/kabbalah-revealed-a-basic-overview" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHMQgqiHCls" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHMQgqiHC...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2umf7LXLuyk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2umf7LXLu...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHqLrW4TOfA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHqLrW4TO...</a>|`|Wb7n512Waa	The above answer by Mr. Unstoppable has some good links.<br>  If you have a question about the purpose of your life then Kabbalah is a perfect place to begin discovering answers and changing your perspective of the world. The human society is ready for this because we have developed into an interconnected global society. We cannot continue to live our lives as though exploiting others for our own good is not hurting all of us. Look at the financial crisis and the problems we face in this world regarding hunger, disease and mental problems, environmental degradation, education problems, children on drugs, families scattering and divorce are just a few things that result from our inner nature to serve our self at the expense of others. Recognizing the harm that is caused by our selfish nature is a step in the right direction. <br>  <br>  <br>  We cannot wait for political leaders and governments to get us out of this mess but rather we are all responsible and each person is obligated to turn this world around by using our egos only for positive reasons of giving and adding to others fulfilment. We are meant to experience a wholesome and positive connection with others which reveals a grand reality in the love that is between all of us. Kabbalah gives us a method to do this. No one will be left out of the abundance and infinite possibilities of good will open to all of us: as individuals and a whole. It is worthwhile! Go for it!!! <br>  <br>  a video about the Results of studying Kabbalah:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTzYDiZKET4&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTzYDiZKE...</a><br>  <br>  a video animation showing how we are all connected:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpZf-ybCzoQ&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpZf-ybCz...</a><br>  <br>  link to webpage of authentic Kabbalah for our generation:<br>  <a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/</a>|`|t27SvIPbaa	You cannot find truth, for to be with truth you have to disregard what is false, and there truth will be.<br>  <br>  Truth is not the word, it is not a concept, it is not your truth or my truth, the Christian truth, the Muslim truth or the Kabbalah truth.  Truth like love has no nationality or culture,  but to love and to see truth there must be no hate, no jealousy, no division and no anger.<br>  <br>  If someone claims that their path leads to truth you can bed that it does not, because there is no path to truth andyouu will only be following someone els's path.  You have to make your own path and as soon as you do the path is destroyed for no two people can follow the path.<br>  <br>  Truth comes into being when your mind and heart are purged of all sense of striving and you are no longer trying to become somebody.<br>  <br>  Comfort is one thing, and truth another, they lead away from each other.<br>  <br>  Can a mind so conditioned know what truth is?<br>  <br>  The ultimate thing, which is truth, is not to be achieved through time.  It can never be achieved, it is there, or it is not there.<br>  <br>  <br>  The how implies that somebody will tell you what to do.<br>  <br>  If you follow another, intelligence is denied.  The following of another, however noble, denies your own perception, denies your own observation – you are merely following somebody who will tell you what to do, what to think.  If you do that, then intelligence doeas not exist, because in that there is no observation and therfore no intelligence.  Intelligence demands doubting, questioning, not being impressed by others, by their enthuiasm, by there energy.<br>  <br>  <br>  To observe and understand the self, I don’t have to read Freud or Jung or go to some so called specialist.  All I have to do is look, as it is all there in front of me.  Authority arrises only when I am confused, when I am in disorder.  It is like the person who says they are looking for their glasses, when all along they had got them on their head.<br>  Counselling creates among people the impression that they need authority to correct the disorder.  When we reject authority we have much more energy.<br>  <br>  The things you believe in are the baggage you carry with you in your life.<br>  <br>  The wise believes in nothing other than the sacredness of all things.  They live in spontaneity of energy and defend nothing or judge anything.<br>  <br>  If you had no fear at all would you have any belief?<br>  <br>  What is important is not what you believe but only why you believe at all.<br>  <br>  If your action is based on fear and reward, is it righteous?  If you behave rightly according to some ideological concept or principle, can that action be regarded as virtuous?<br>  <br>  Belief can never lead to reality; belief is the result of conditioning, or the outcome of fear, or the result of an outer or inner authority which gives comfort.<br>  <br>  Belief is one thing seeing is another?<br>  <br>  It is not a question of whether there is reincarnation, but that there is incarnation now.<br>  <br>  To find out who is speaking the truth, do not seek but question.<br>  <br>  We believe because we are afraid, fear not only in the daily grind of life, the fear of not becoming of not achieving psychically, not having power, position, prestige, fame –all this causes a great deal of fear and one puts up with fear, and that inward fear of belief has become so important.<br>  <br>  To experience, to realize that which is beyond time, we must obviously understand the process of time.  The mind is the result of time; it is based on the memories of yesterday.  And it is possible to be free from the multiplication of yesterdays that is the process of time.  Surly this is a very serious problem; it is not a matter of belief or disbelief.  Believing and disbelieving is a process of ignorance, where’s understanding the time – binding quality of thought brings freedom in which alone there can be discovery.  Most of want to believe because it is much more convenient; it gives us a sense of security, a sense of belonging to a group.  Surly this very belief separates us, you believe in one thing and I believe in another.  So belief acts as a barrier, it is a process of disintegration.<br>  <br>  If you hold firmly to some set of beliefs or other, you look at everything through that particular prejudice or tradition; you don’t have any contact with reality.<br>  <br>  We demand a belief when we want to escape from a fact into an unreality.

b8uYVhVMaa	The vast majority of Nat Geo photography is done by freelancers who either submit or are commissioned.<br>  To get noticed you need to be excellent at the type of photography they like and you need to submit images to the picture editor.<br>  99.9% of submissions get rejected.<br>  <br>  Set your sites lower and work towards that.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	National Geographic does not have too many staffers.  Most of the photography you see is assigned to working pros with special skills that will produce images that will fit the specific  photo needs of an article.<br>  <br>  To become ANY successful photographer you need at least three things.<br>  <br>  1) a complete understanding of how to make perfect exposures and images that are composed so well that the photo editor for whatever magazine you to work for, does not have to crop out have the items in the shot and do this on demand using any camera that is necessary to get the shot (this includes view cameras and miniature cameras like 35 mm SLR's and the new DSLR's)<br>  2) years and years of experience and a lot of tear-sheets showing your success as a working pro.<br>  3) a very large camera system.  If you look at any of the recent National Geographic magazines, you will see that the photographers use a large variety of lenses from fish-eye to extreme telephoto as well as macro lenses.  It is not unusual for any magazine photographer to have over $20,000 in just cameras and lenses in his/her kit.  Add flash units, light modifiers, stands and sand bags, add another $1,500 to $2,000<br>  <br>  As magazines go, they pay top dollar to the photographer while on assignment as well as all expenses.  But you cannot live one working for them alone.  Most photographers are lucky to shoot one or two assignments in a lifetime for them ... others shoot two or three assignments a year ... not nearly enough to support a family, provide all your own benefits and retirement, let alone upgrade your $8,000 camera bodies every 18-24 months.<br>  <br>  Like mentioned above.  You are asking us how to become one of the cream of the crop editorial and scientific photographers in the world today.  This is something that might come to you, only if you have all the skills and experience necessary to join that group.<br>  <br>  Knowing the managing editor or photo editor would be a big plus, but would not guarantee you would ever work on assignment for them|`|0LgpcOBDaa	I have to agree with the other 2 posts here.

xjBFwsVMaa	Get your friends together and do a music video to a song that's less that four minutes such as: (have them lip synching hehe)<br>  Paparazzi- Lady Gaga<br>  Idea for video: Someone has to dress up like Lady Gaga and someone has to be the boy she likes... and  he has to like be coming out of a door and she hiding around the corner then is secretly watching him when it says promise I'll be kind you could have her go up to him and touch his arm and flirty with him. Then cut til he's on stage putting on a "performance" and have the Lady Gaga back there waiting on him all smiley and when it says eyeliner and cigerettes have her putting on eyeliner looking into a mirror back stage. Then have him grab her hand and twirl her when it says yellow dance. Then have her all sad still talkin to him then have them go somewhere that looks like a studio and have them dancing together.<br>  <br>  Don't Mess with my Man- Nivea n Jagged Edge<br>  Idea-  Have to have a guy at the beginning probably in a leather jacket with sunglasses sitting on a bench  then getting up walking towards the camera til Nivea starts singing then you cut to the girl who is gonna play your Nivea. Have her "singin" to other girls by some lockers or something. Have the guy walk over and when she says he's mine. Have her grab his hand and kiss him on the cheek. Then to one girl in particular have her get in her face and tell the "So I thought I had to let you know<br>  Find someone that you can call your own<br>  Cause now youre walkin in the danger zone<br>  And if I touch you Ill be wrong"<br>  Have the other girl rolling her eyes her arms across her chest watching the other girl.  <br>  Have the girl standing there in front of her man just behind her.<br>  "If you mess with my man, ima be the one to break it to ya<br>  Got my girls, got my man, so find your own and leave mine alone<br>  Dont mess with my man, ima be the one to break it to ya<br>  Heres a little advice for you, find your own man"<br>  At this time have a group of guys be staring at the girl and then the guy turns around and sees. Have the one guy try to go up to the main girl and grab her butt and have the boyfriend push him back then start crackin his knuckles.<br>  "It was hard to find a girl thats really down for me<br>  Seems like a lot of ****** tryin me<br>  Cause they tryna take my baby, oh what the hell<br>  So now you really better check yourself<br>  Messin with my girl is bad for your health and<br>  So you know you will be dealt with<br>  Better find your own girl"<br>  Am sure you can take it from there on this one.<br>  <br>  The Last Night- Skillet (I know this is kind of odd... but I really like this song lol)<br>  Ideas: You're going to have to make this kind of at night or somewhere its dark. The main star of course is the guy but there is also a girl. Have the girl come to the guy and have her grab his arms and she turns hers around and looks at all the scars. She's crying and singing this and then he does the "I know its a lie" thing<br>  Have him lead her to a bench and look him in the eyes  and then wrap her in his arms and kiss her forhead. <br>  Have it cut to a scene where there's a picture of parents (not necessarily hers) or you could have some people pretending to be her parents patting her head  and then letting her go back up stairs.<br>  Having them walking in a park while he's singing then sleep his arm around her. Then back to her hand leading her to his apartment or house. Think you can take it from here.<br>  <br>  Invisible- Jennifer Hudson<br>  Idea: Have a guy in his bedroom and the girl looking into it from a window or the doorway. Have her shake her head and grab it then walkk away. Walking through the house then have a zoom of a clock. Then have her in a different outfit busting out of the house and getting in a car. Then drive to a friend then go to like a mall or something walking down the middle of the mall "shopping" for boys and for new outfits. Then have her meet a new guy and flirt.<br>  (just the main ideas)<br>  <br>  Mile in these Shoes- Jennifer Lopez  (I think this would be an excellent idea for a high school cause I know how rumors spread.)<br>  Idea: Have a bunch of girls whispering to each other in the hallway then have the main chick walk by lip synching have her have attitude and literally flick them off and walk by like she's on a runway. Have her have high heels on with straps. Then have her acting out the parts. Then have her strut into a dance floor with nice shows and then dance with several guys. Then have a bunch of girls talking rolling their eyes and stuff again while the main person shines like a star.  Then have a close up of her shoes. Then have her do a stomp dance. Just make sure the lyrics match the stuff...

K5IOSGXAaa	Absolutely. God created the animals before He created man. They have a very special place in His heart and I fully believe they have souls. That is why it is so sad and criminal that people abuse them, it's disgusting and I believe it is a sin against God.|`|tsjLHXzUaa	There is no legitimate reason to believe that animals do or dont any more so or less so than a human being.<br>  <br>  The way I see it, if we humans do then so do animals. To suggest some arbitrary difference is naive, arrogant, self-righteous, and a completely unfounded assumption.<br>  <br>  Of course that bars the possibility that particular religious dogmas are accurate.  But which religious views are more right than others is an entirely different debate, isnt it?<br>  <br>  Aside from a long-term memory, vocal cords, and maybe a high developed set of reasoning skills, I see no real difference between my cat and myself.  I treat her like my daughter and a member of the family.<br>  <br>  She, among other animal-people, have impressed me greatly with shows of intellect that are on par with human beings. Memory, emotion, anticipation, planning. I have objectively observed and documented these demonstrations for myself.<br>  <br>  Is a human child or someone with the IQ of a gnat any less human? Any less possessing of a soul?  Life is life.<br>  <br>  I suppose some could argue a Buddhist position and claim all life, even plants, have souls.  But I dont think I could include plant life or rocks and minerals. Brains are brains, and for me that is a good distinction... it is where personality, memory and all things distinctly "you" are stored away.<br>  <br>  Whats the difference between an animals brains, a retarded childs brains, my own brain, and the brains of our distant evolutionary cousins? Development, thats all. And as far as I can tell, there is no threshold over which one acquires a soul or loses it.<br>  <br>  (wouldnt that be something if you could lose a soul simply by losing brain capacity, because you ride the threshold and continue to sway from one side to the other?)<br>  <br>  Until science (or my own personal spiritual pursuits) can show a threshold, I wont assume there is one. But then, that is like asking science to show a soul. The only threshold claims that are made are by particular religions, and they dont all agree.<br>  <br>  Im inclined to believe that I have a soul. And since I don't blindly subscribe to any religious views and have an empathy for all life, particularly the ones who feel and think, I cant disregard the possibility that animals have souls, too.<br>  <br>  Regardless if animals do or dont... regardless if we humans do or dont... regardless of anyones beliefs or religions... don't you think it unethical to act on the assumption that anyone, any animal, doesn't have a soul? Regardless of belief, any uncertainty whatsoever ethically obligates me to default to, "yes, they do"|`|lVAe2SLXaa	In order to answer that, one must have proof that the thing you refer to as a "Soul" is actual and factual. To date there has never been any scientific evidence to support claims to the positive.|`|UDEMDcGuaa	I believe that animals have as much value and feeling and deserve to be treated with respect and care  as much as humans, whether either has immortal souls  that float away after death to play harps on clouds is unlikely to me|`|6e902ba5b8bd99003ad43ac387de6637aa	Of course they do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.socyberty.com/Philosophy/Do-Animals-Have-Souls.267989" rel="nofollow">http://www.socyberty.com/Philosophy/Do-A...</a>|`|fqE8NfEFaa	Every living creature has a soul, an essence.|`|2nsUmrV5aa	most definitely.|`|31gN5L58aa	yaaaaaaa|`|mmnkMU5paa	Yes, every living being has a soul, including plants, which have vegetative souls.  The word "soul" in English is a translation of "animus", in Latin, or "psuche" (psyche) in ancient Greek.  The meaning of the term is "principle of life in any organized living body which has the capacity for life."<br>  <br>  The term didn't have a peculiarly "spiritual or religious" meaning when firt coined as "psyche" by the ancient Greeks.  The "psyche" term was derived from the Greek term "Katapsyxis" which means "to refrigerate" or "to blow upon" or "to cool", probably because most animals breathe.  The other original option was "zein" which means "to boil" and may be why the Greeks called warm blooded animals "zoon".<br>  <br>  The earliest Greek thinkers chose strictly material elements as the fundamental causes of "psyche" or "soul" (in English), some choosing air, others, water, and still others, fire.  But whatever they chose, the term "psuche/psyche" simply meant "the principle or cause" of anything, whatever, being a living body.<br>  <br>  In the first formal treatise written on "the psyche" or "soul", by Aristotle, he compares different kinds of "souls" to each other, like geometrical objects.  The souls of plants have a triangle of powers, which are (1) nutrition, (2) growth to a variable limit and (3) reproduction.  The souls of sentient or sensitive animals have the same 3 vegetative powers as plants, in addition to the 4rth power of sensation, and its corollary powers of desire and movement.<br>  <br>  Human souls he compared to a pentagram of powers, having all the powers again (vegetative and sensitive), of plants and sentient animals plus a fifth intellectual power and its corollaries (will, knowledge, understanding and, perhaps, wisdom).  Thus homo sapiens, in Latin or, in English, a homid animal with the capacity for wisdom.<br>  <br>  In short, "soul", in English, or "psyche" in Greek simply meant the life principle of living organized bodies.  It was Descartes who started the trend towards thinking that only "thinking animals", or men, had souls, tending to confuse thought (a power) with "psyche/soul", which had previously meant "life principle".<br>  <br>  Kevin|`|tACp8AI5aa	Of course they do, silly =)<br>  Everything that in this world have soul... <br>  Animals, humans, plants, objects, everything have soul on them..........<br>  Because if humans, animals, plants, objects , etc don't have a soul, they might die within some second, same goes to animal...<br>  <br>  If they r soul less, they might be die within second or minutes<br>  <br>  Anything can't live without a soul...|`|1TPGdaXJaa	I believe so. They are like humans in the sense that they are alive, and some seem to show emotion as well as other signs of intelligence. In fact, I don't know what someone would say to back the idea that animals do not have souls.|`|AA11564934	nothing has a soul, it's a fairy tale.|`|yuuvBSKsaa	I suppose that depends on what you think a soul is.<br>  <br>  Do animals have an emotional/logical control system controlling their actions - sure.<br>  <br>  Anyone with more than one pet knows they have different personalities.<br>  <br>  But the Religious sense of soul?  I.e. a mind that survives the death of the body?   Well that's a premise without support for humans or animals.<br>  <br>  Some of your personality is passed down through time both biologically & in the people you have influenced,  So we do have aspects of our soul which endure regardless.  And to some degree animals share this, so by the modest definition, Animals would have a soul.<br>  <br>  But the eternal endurance of a specific self & set of memories - probably not for them or us.|`|A01w1dHqaa	Many are realizing we are not our bodies, but mind or Spirit. Spirit is the activating force behind the physical world including animals.|`|AA10729675	Yes, they do.|`|aZXnW6AUaa	yes
mmnkMU5paa	You seem to be confusing a principle with powers.  The human soul is the principle of life in a human body.  The powers of this kind of soul (interior life principle; cause of life) are nutrition, growth to a limit, reproduction (vegetative powers), sensation-desire-motion (sensitive powers) and intellection (reasoning and judgment).<br>  <br>  I think you asked a question on "soul" recently.  It wasn't originally a peculiarly "religious or spiritual" term or concept (expressed by a term) to the ancient Greeks.<br>  <br>  Kevin|`|dbgQgYscaa	The human soul has a completely evolved consciousness. The souls of everyone and everything are one with God and so are God, but only human souls can know that because of their full and complete consciousness. Lower forms of life have to keep evolving consciousness and can't know God because of their incompleteness.|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	It is the seat of all mental processes, including all emotion. We are spiritual beings who live in a body (temporarily) and possess a soul.|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	It's a secret; I can't tell.|`|htYDgKIbaa	The soul has no principles it is something pure. It is the electricity in our body it is that controls us, that sees through us.

0qYY7cdzaa	I think you may be confused about the f3.5-5.6 indicated on your lens. This sounds like the maximum aperture designation for a zoom lens. For instance, a lens may have 35-105mm f3.5-5.7 printed on it - that means the lens has a maximum aperture of f3.5 when at 35mm and when zoomed to 105 it drops to a maximum of f5.6.<br>  Changing the aperture will change the depth of field, and changing the focal length (zooming) will change the depth of field with a lens like my example. The higher the f number the more depth of field.<br>  I believe it's mentioned here <a href="http://www.photoxels.com/tutorial_aperture.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.photoxels.com/tutorial_apertu...</a> .|`|2TLXfQKDaa	If you change your aperture to f8 your shutter is only going to adjust if you're in aperture priority mode.  In manual mode it will stay at whatever it's set to until you adjust it.<br>  <br>  Depending on your distance to the subject, and the distance between the subject and the background, f8 will give you a shallow to really shallow depth of field.   Lower apertures = shallow depth of field, high aperture numbers = long, deep, large depth of field.  Depending on your composition you can achieve a shallow depth of field with an aperture of f16.  It falls on your foreground to subject, and subject to background.  That's a rooty poot basic run down.|`|7uCfW237aa	f3.5-f5.6 refers to the MAXIMUM APERTURE as you zoom from 18 to 55.<br>  This is because the design of the lens means that less light gets in when the lens is zoomed to the long end...<br>  <br>  The minimum aperture is a different story. Maybe it is f/22-32...<br>  <br>  So at 18mm your aperture is 3.5-22, and at telephoto your aperture is 5.6-32<br>  <br>  hope this helps!

c058a8802f5627063b81819d961b2c72aa	Whats even MORE embarrassing is the adulation that the public puts on the actors. (Celebrities ?? BULLSH!T !!!)<br>  My GOD, I don't see why the public goes NUTS when those loser's do anything.<br>  <br>  (Adrena, I don't agree with you about "Slumdog", but "The Wrestler" was also a fine movie.) <br>  <br>  I think these awards are a waste of time, but just another way for the TV companies to CLEAN UP.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	They were entertaining. They're awards for entertainters.

I think that I might have watched a total of about 40 minutes of it off and on. I use to really enjoy watching the Oscars when I was younger, especially when Billy Crystal was the host. I just think that it's not as appealing anymore for number of reasons. I just don't enjoy watching people stroll the red carpet, I could care less about what they are wearing, or as the phrase has been "Who" there's wearing. Most of the movies that were nominated I haven't even seen and I didn't like the idea of 5 people onstage to present the nominees in certain categories. I mean, I know that they are trying to do different things to make it interesting, but I wasn't impressed with the very little that I saw. I don't have all night to sit and watch a show that could actually be done in 30 minutes. It took them almost 30 minutes, just to give out 2 awards. Way too long. All I need is a great opening. Go go through each category present the nominees, announce the winner and move on to the next presenter. There are too many videos and clips, too many attempted jokes, and just too much wasting of time with nonsense. I think that it has lost it's magic and that it could be much better.

aHvJcb0uaa	the twilight saga is the best isn't it?!!??! i love it! i think if alice never turned up to the house edward would of been killed by the volturi and bella would try to move on and maybe accept jacob as more than a friend. but she would find it very hard, for example, if she was kissing jacob she would keep seeing edwards face in her head. she would definitely take time to accept jacob as more than a friend. i liked jacob in book one and 2, but i hated him in eclipse!! especially when bella told him to kiss her!!!! ugh, i wanted to kill him. but in breaking dawn i really liked him. the dumb blonde jokes to rosalie were funny too. LONG LIVE THE TWILIGHT SAGA!!!!!|`|9Duha1k4aa	im not going to read your essay, but if alice hadnt come to Bella's house after she jumped off a cliff, then she would marry Jacob and they would live happily ever after ... end of story. forever. edward would stay as a distant, unrealistic dream with imperfections. everyone is happy.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	I think it's time to put the book down.

After reading Eclipse, I prefer Jacob to Edward. I know the Edward fans will hate me, but I wish he hadn't come back in New Moon. I used to like Edward, but he can get round Bella so easily, as she is so in love with him. But Jacob has to work for her to like him. I would've liked it if it had ended up that she choose Jacob over Edward.

CJqK40uFaa	i think that TI is actually trying to do a good thing. if you watch the show, he talks about how he learned his lesson and is trying to keep other young men from doing the wrong thing. He also explained WHY he bought the guns (he didnt feel safe after someone killed his best friend), and although it was STUPID AS HELL IMO i see his reasoning, but i dont condone it, BUT if he goes to jail, that right there is telling kids that these kinds of actions have repercussions. i think he should get jail time, but not 30 years. thats too far. <br>  <br>  I think Jay-Z is a good role model cuz he is showing that with good business acumen you can be REALLY successful. alot of rappers started out selling drugs, cuz i guess that was the only way to make it out thier neighborhoods before they started rapping, but they dont do it anymore, and most rappers now try to tell kids about the bad outcomes of drugs, and you see it in the media. plus i think rappers are good role models, at least SOME of them, like Nelly, Ludacris, Jay-Z, TI, etc, because once they got rich they started foundations to help thier communities and to help kids in poor areas from where they grew up and thats good that they do that instead of wasting all that money or chains and rims. <br>  <br>  thats just my opinion. good question
qgs155HNaa	The first competition in Greek theater performance was in 534 B.C. at the City Dionysia, and is associated with the name Thespis.  He is universally credited with being the first Greek dramatist.  But Solon is said to have attended one of his plays (and not to have liked it).  Since Solon died ca. 560 B.C., Thespis must have been putting on plays by then (unless the story is an invention, which it may well have been).

Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing — not even a smear of blood — to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy? <br>  This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know... <br>  <br>  Exotic and gritty, exhilarating and utterly gripping, Cassandra Clare's ferociously entertaining fantasy takes readers on a wild ride that they will never want to end.

NYU37jfGaa	It really started with Napoleon Bonaparte.  In 1798 he led an expedition to Egypt, its ultimate strategic aim to secure an laternative route to India, which was at that time under British control.  Only a month after the force's arrival they suffered a massive defeat, and the 4,000 strong French army was cut off from home in a 3-year exile. as well as military forces, the army was accompanied by  a Commission of scientists and artists, and they made the best of the situation, setting out to explore, measure, draw and describe everything in their path.  As they progressed upstream, fighting disease and an often hostile population, one wonderful discovery followed another in an overwhelming succession of monuments, statues, and mystery, for the hieroglphys had not yet been translated.<br>  <br>  The most important discovery made by the French scientists was the Rosetta Stone, in 1799.  This fragment proved to be a bilingual decree - written in Egyptian (both hierogphys and demotic script) and Greek - issued in 196 BC by the Egyptian priesthood in honour of Ptolemy V.  This led to the eventual succesful translation of the hieroglyphic script, and meant that Egyptian history could be studied much more effectively.|`|AA11203798	egyptology really developed during the victorian era as a result of the rich going on their world culture tours.A few eccentrics started collecting Egyptian stuff, this led to more interest and more archaeology.

7uCfW237aa	There is no clear answer unless some staff are on here.<br>  From experience you can take most cameras into stadiums with no problem and i have seen many photos taken by amateurs with compact cameras and DSLRs up from in the stands. <br>  <br>  The website has this to say in its FAQ:<br>  <br>  "Restrictions on items in the ground… What can I and can’t I take into the ground?<br>  There is a restriction on various items which stewards will not allow into the stadium. Cameras generally are fine EXCEPT for professional ones. You will not be able to take into the ground: - glasses - bottles – drink cans – gas canisters – fireworks – flag poles – darts – knives – tools – umbrellas" <br>  <br>  This seems very vague and i can only assume it refers to the widely used "professional lens" rule. This is a general rule used by many venues which says a lens greater than 3 inches is a professional camera. In basic terms that means a kit lens and maybe a small telephoto are fine, but a larger zoom such as 70-300 or a professional telephoto would probably be noticed.<br>  <br>  Thats just a guess, i suggest you call them up and ask them exactly what they would call a "professional camera"

yUHh1Q8Qaa	I'm not going to answer what sounds like a homework question, but I think I can get you started:<br>  <br>  Descartes was interested in devising a method of scientific inquiry that would yield 100% true results.  He would not be satisfied with scientific practice today where we routinely accept 95% accuracy.  He modeled his project on geometry.  He wanted to find one thing that could not fail to be true and then build his system on it in the confidence that any truth generated from this first principle would also be 100% true.  <br>  <br>  Here's the clue: geometry is true even in an empty universe.  even if there were no triangles or squares the Pythagorean theorem is still true.  So what advantage would Descartes' certainty have in investigating real world relationships that are dependent on other objects and relationships?|`|OdoLSDlXaa	He argued that there could be an evil genius distorting and tricking our senses.  He later concluded that God would not allow such an evil genius the power to do that to us.  So that takes away the original reason to doubt the senses.  <br>  <br>  A basic criticism is that we have to give up 100% certainty and look at what is probable and likely.  Science is based upon premises that the physical world is real and the senses can be relied upon.  That is not certainty, but as a likely premise it has held up well for thousands of  years.|`|mmnkMU5paa	Of course the senses correct each other.  For example, by sight and feel sugar and salt appear to be identical.  The sense of taste corrects the confusion, caused by similar visible and tactile impressions which are almost identical for salt and sugar.<br>  <br>  The best modern criticism of Descartes's thesis that we should separate ourselves from the "prejudices of the senses" is that when such things are actually done, by sensory deprivation experiments, human beings actually begin to hallucinate sensory input.<br>  <br>  The best ancient criticism comes from Aristotle who argues that the senses are never wrong about their "proper objects", unless the sensory organs are damaged, but it is our minds which often misinterpret sensory input.<br>  <br>  That ancient thesis is well supported by modern physiologists who  have proved how various sensory organs react to specific wavelengths of light (sight), specific chemicals to which our various tastebuds react (taste), or which stimulate nerve endings in our noses (smell), the structure of the ear which reacts to various decibal wavelengths of "compressions and rarefactions" in the air (hearing) and various pressure, temperature and pain receptors in our skins (touch).<br>  <br>  Modern physiology is all on the side of Aristotle and against Descartes's so-called "errors of sense".<br>  <br>  Kevin

Read up on scientific data.. not fairy tales.|`|AA11728349	In my opinion, It was shown to me way back in 1978, at Texas A&M, that 7000 years ago, our Planet was much closer to Orion's belt. which is a planetary system much, much older, than ours. At that time it could be believed, that visitors from there came here, to mine our natural resources. Space ships need non ferrous metals such as gold to insulate their crafts from the harsh conditions of space. We got that stuff in spades. It could be believed that they could have test tubed some workers,and put in some faulty DNA, that caused the "workers" to have a short life span of say 50-65 years, with in that time the Earth would be pulling away from Orion's belt, and it was not profitable to transport the load such a long distance. So, it would make sense, that the "visitors", stop by and check on us from time to time, to see how their little experiment in the human race is coming along, and to see how much of their gold is left. I'm not an Atheist. I truly believe we have a higher power, because something had to make the Visitors, right? We are Sharing our God with the whole solar system. Wouldn't it be a hoot that when the visitors come back, they handed the president a Bible? Well, that's just me talking again.
BKrqlGz4aa	There are only two books in the Darth Bane series as of right now.  Book One is titled "Darth Bane:  Path Of Destruction", Book Two is titled "Darth Bane:  The Rule Of Two".<br>  <br>  I have heard a few rumors of a third book in the series coming out sometime but nothing concrete as of yet.  It's kind of ironic but book one was wildly popular but even though I liked it I wasn't really "rah, rah" about it.  It was so popular that it pushed back the release of a highly anticipated book about Darth Plageious The Wise (Palpatine's Sith Master) for a second Darth Bane book.  Book two wasn't as popular as book one but I thought it was a lot better.  <br>  <br>  In the future when you're looking for Star Wars books check out www.delreybooks.com.  DelRey is the official publisher of all Star Wars books and they have a very in depth time line at their site.  Also, as "SWdarklighter" said, there are time lines in the fronts of many of the paperback versions of the Star Wars books.  These time lines will keep you one step ahead of your Star Wars loving hubby ... lol ...<br>  <br>  On a personal note, I do not support the wars that Mr. Bush got us into but that in no way shape or form means that I don't support the troops.  Your husband and thousands of others are out there every day risking their lives to keep me and my family safe and that is a debt that I could never repay.  I would like to also thank you for your service.  The old saying "War is hell on the home front too" has never been more true than it is today.  I have a lot of friends serving some make it some don't.  If you want to know how close to home this has hit me I present Jason Dunham.  I was his little league coach ... what a brilliant mind that was snuffed out well before it's time.<br>  <br>  Please make sure he knows that we are all have his back.

Hope that helps :]|`|a9wRfuuSaa	The first book in this series is Darth Bane: Path of Destruction. The second is Rule of Two. Currently there are only two books in this series, but I a sure there will be more. Both are available in paperback right now.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend the Republic Commando books (Hard Contact, Triple Zero, True Colors and Order 66). The first three are currently available in paperback.This is one of my favorite series.<br>  <br>  If you ever get confused by the books - and there is plenty to get confused over - just look in the front of any of the books. There is a timeline that shows where in the timeline the books take place as well as the series orders for the books. To get the most complete list, look for a newer book, such as a hardcover book.

rI6xYwhcaa	I have been there. You feel guilty because  you were never like this in High School ( or homeschool).<br>  <br>  <br>  For one, get out of depression. Eat well, exersize, get OFF THE COMPUTER, read, think. I mean that. Computer is another way to numb the mind. You may not see it, but you are depressed. You feel like  your dead inside. You cant believe this is happening to you because you worked so hard for better.<br>  <br>  Find an advisor who is willing to keep track of  you. It may be that you dont actually like what  you are studying, nevertheless, you need to get through college to do anything productive.  When I failed, I was lucky enough to find a class focused specifically on academic achievement. It met each week and they literally asked you to write about school and how  you feel. They reached out to you.  We had to write down all the clases we missed each wk too. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Strong warning:<br>  <br>  Colleges don't play. They  are business out to get your money, and will drop you like a hot potato if you dont keep up the decent grades(it makes them look bad).<br>  <br>   If your GPA is below a 2.0 for about two semesters (this is the usual at college) they will END YOUR EDUCATION at that instituion. I know enough college dropouts to see this. It's bewildering because they felt the college was for them. It ain't.  <br>  <br>  A drop out in a class is much better than being kicked out of school because you were too pridefull to admit you were failing. <br>  <br>  You should know your GPA and whether or not you or on probation at all times.|`|AA12299134	I don't know exactly about starting over, but you can do things to make changes now.  Start with your belief system.  Look at the things you think and believe about your life, and I could probably guarantee that some of them aren't good.  I know this because there are things 'messing up' in your life as you put it.  <br>  <br>  Change these beliefs to something more positive, and begin thinking them as conscious thoughts.  I am also guessing that deep down, you have a belief that you DON'T DESERVE TO BE HAPPY, so definitely change this one.  Once you begin thinking these new thoughts, your mind will begin to absorb the new messages you are sending it, and will recycle them as feelings and behaviour.  <br>  <br>  This will boost your confidence, and you will also feel inspired to take positive action to change your life and seek out the people who can help you.  These might come to you in unexpected ways.  The change won't be instant, but with some gentle persistence you can make positive improvements happen quite quickly.  Good luck to you.

Its true what they say, you can be who you want to be, its kind of like starting over.  But I didn't want to fool myself, I knew I couldn't change too much.  Because the other me still exists back home.  One thing I noticed was that I didn't have a pre-determined personality here, like I did back home.  I had more freedom to express myself without being judged.  I was a more positive and outgoing person in my new home.  It was hard at first because I didn't know anyone, but I got to meet some really cool people and made life long friends.  I was happier and I was experiencing new and different things.  And when I came home to visit, I brought that positive energy with me.  <br>  <br>  In the end I moved back home.  But I never forgot my new friends and the new city I came to know.  They helped shape the new me.  I still go there to visit but this is my home.  My family and child hood friends are here.  I came back with more confidence, and all the things that used to bother me don't bother me anymore.

There were several incidents in which internees were shot to death by guards if they were close to the perimeter fences.  Many suffered and died from lack of medical care.  I can't find any sources specifically referencing the amount of dead associated with the camps.<br>  <br>  Although not expressly designed for extermination, the conditions in several Japanese-American internment camps were often primitive at best.  Many had no plumbing, heating, or other amenities that most of the internees likely had in their own homes.  Others had better conditions, and even had schools, post offices, or were otherwise operated like small communities.

iT9S20zvaa	If this involves insulting the reader, I would definitely say no.  Can you find a better way to make your point?<br>  <br>  The one thing you need to do is make sure you do not belittle the reader.  When taking a stance/proving a point, you must be careful to remain informative and persuasive but never insult someone.  Most likely, this is a bad idea.   I've read some things where the author blatantly slammed the opposing party/reader, and that sort of persuasiveness does not work.  It only makes the reader less receptive to your point and will probably ruin your essay.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If the subject is something the reader may be unfamiliar with, then yes, I would suggest providing the appropriate data.  This will also aid in getting your point across, though I would not call it playing on a reader's ignorance.  It's more along the lines of informing a reader of any needed information so that they can better understand where you're coming from.  As long as you don't make the reader feel inferior, bombard them with facts that are unnecessary, etc., this will probably be fine.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes it is necessary to give some facts just because so few people would normally know anything about a certain topic.  Also, make sure the information is relevant enough so that it will help the reader understand the subject as well as your point.  If the information will not support your point, then don't use it.|`|nJS2gYM9aa	Maybe.<br>  <br>  If your readers are ignorant enough that they don't know that you're playing on their ignorance, then I don't see a problem with it. :)|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	No. Playing to someone's ignorance would make them LESS likely to be persuaded to your point of view.

AA11130249	You are working bigger than I work.  Coiling would be a possibility.<br>  <br>  I would probably start by rolling out some slabs of clay about 1/2 to 3/8 inch thick.  Maybe set up the clay ext-ruder to extrude some coils. I would choose big  hole or maybe do some with a ribbon<br>  <br>  I hope you have done some other work with clay and know some of these basics<br>  <br>  To join clay if it is soft enough it can be pressed together and worked.<br>  <br>  When the clay drys some you need to score and slip the clay - ruff up both surfaces and add some slime made from the clay you are using.<br>  <br>  Clay shrinks as it dries. It also becomes stiffer. You will be doing a dance letting the clay dry for stronger and spraying with water to balance being able to manipulate the clay.<br>  <br>  You want to try for an even thickness. Avoid trapping air if you are going to have the piece fired in the kiln.<br>  <br>  I also wrap pieces with plastic bags and plastic wrap to control moisture loss.  Near the end if it dries too fast there will be a lot of cracks<br>  <br>  You can see some of my pieces at my blog.  I marked it for adult content.

N86vHKxtaa	Weapons on both sides during the civil war were effectively the same although the north's larger manufacturing base usually meant they had access to a larger quantity.<br>  <br>  At Vicksburg, one important "weapon" was the union fleet under Admiral David Porter.  The ability to get supplies and units past the fortifications by running the river was a crucial advantage for the union.  After the successful siege and surrender of the city, the Confederacy was effectively cut in two.  General Grant's decision to parole nearly 20,000 prisoners of war was a mistake as many fought again soon after.<br>  <br>  It is a remarkable coincidence that Vicksburg surrendered on the same day as the union army defeated General Robert E.

There was no fixed team number and anyone could change places withe the goalie.  Also you could handle the ball if you preferred.  Then a number of footballers met at Cambridge University (think in the 1850s) to set out some rules.  Present day rules were set out by the association of teams (thus association football). Rugby University players refused to agree so we got Rugby.  The word soccer has a strange origin.  Apparently the Cambridge students used their own terms for some things like 'brekker' for breakfast.  So they took 'soc' out of association football and nicknamed it 'soccer'.  That's how soccer began.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	Many different cultures developed similar games simultaneously, or at least without influence from eachother. For instance Mayans (ancient Mexicans) played a game very similar to football but played on curved sides. It's likely that football was developed from a game played in Europe without influence from China and the similarities are coincidental.

JRI5oPISaa	Nerves are always a threat on stage, but as a sometimes musician I've found the best couple of ways to get around the fear are...<br>  <br>  --Know your material VERY well.  Usually what is causing the fear is the thought of going wrong.  But if you've gone over things a thousand times, you're pretty much on autopilot with the best performance patterns burned into your brain.<br>  <br>  ---Rehearse with simulated distractions.  Grab some friends or family and have them stare at you, talk, etc., while you present your act.  Or play the TV at speaking volume while you rehearse.  Then things the crowd says or does won't be as likely to get you off track.<br>  <br>  --Make a joke.  This might not be doable in a play where you must stay on script... but when the audience laughs, it often sweeps the nervousness away.  Then you can get down to the meat of your routine.<br>  <br>  Lastly, don't forget to visualize yourself being successful!  Imagine completing your part as you've practiced it, and earning the audience's applause at the end for a job well done.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|nHIgou9laa	Honestly Stage fright goes away along with practice and more experience performing in front of people. It's not a big deal. Try practicing your part in front of your family or close friends.  Do it over & over, until you have nothing to worry about you'll be smooth sailing unless you are just a complete wreck. But seriously its practice makes perfect. I use to have stage fright and now I can perform in front of anyone, anytime, anyplace.|`|7JTku3qpaa	well ive acted for years and all i can say is there is nothing more annoying to other actors then an actor with stage fright. its completely unnerving to those around you and until you face this fear and get it under control you shouldnt be on stage. it stresses everyone around you out. maybe acting isnt your thing. when i go onstage .. being afraid is the least of my worries.. acting isnt for everyone. sorry.|`|1dnHHDQmaa	when i get stage fright, i just look at my best friend. looking at her makes me not think of anyone else being there. so at your next performance, just try looking at someone you trust or like, then you don't even realize that anyone else is there! hope i helped! :) :)|`|AA12038658	This is a classic- you picture all of the people in the audience naked or in their underwear.|`|PkXJRfaBaa	Just imagine you're in rehearsals again, imagine that the audience is not there. I used to have a similar problem and when I realized that I was better in rehearsal than on the night, I just thought "Imagine they're not there!"<br>  Which play are you doing? Is there an aside speech? This can be quite terrifying, especially if it's Shakespearean English. Again, either pretend they're not there or... imagine them in their underwear!|`|Cpp1LddVaa	For the  most  part, overcoming stage fright is a practicing curve.<br>  <br>  One of the best things you can do at home is to practice your lines -- whether alone or with a helper -- in a place where you have the  TV or  radio blaring the whole time.  Fighting the distraction will be tough but it will improve your focus and concentration -- two keys to overcoming stage fright since ignoring all those folks in audience land is a big part of it.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes  (I don't believe in broken legs).|`|Vgk8VnXwaa	You don't avoid it, you control it.  Just keep on keeping on, doing as much acting/public speaking as you can.  Prepare even more.  Memorize your lines from the end first.(Memorize last line first, second to last line second, etc.)  That way, as the play progresses, you will be reciting lines that become even more and more familiar.  Good luck.|`|2r1WN0Hgaa	I know that this might sound a bit stupid but what i do is I pretend that I'm the best. Which I know is not true, but just get in double character. One of you is the character that you're playing and the other is the best actress/actor in the world. And for some very strange reason it comforts me. It really does. It's stupid but all of sudden I get this confidence wave and it shows. People told me. I don't know if it will work for you but just try it. And keep telling yourself that you're the best and there ain't no one else better than you to the stage where you're actually believing the lies. lol. it works for me.

ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>

Get your reference to a xerox machine, copy it, and then get a carbon paper (or something similar to that) and then trace your reference. Take each line into account, and while you trace it, memorize/think, "why is the artist put this kind of line here?" even better if you can mix and match several part (eyes, nose, hair) from different artist that you think best.<br>  <br>  If you're starting to get serious, get several books "How to draw manga", some of them are expensive, and not worth it, but some of them are cheap and quite worth it. Go to the amazon, check out their prices.<br>  <br>  Last, if you're REALLY serious, then take an art class. No, I'm serious, whoever said that manga artist didn't learn anatomy must be an idiot. If I remember it right, everyone of them usually use photo as reference, either it for background or for the character itself, of course to fit in the story, they need to do some exaggerate and simplify stuff. But it all goes down to the same basic principle, no matter if you're going to fine art, drawing cartoon, drawing anime or manga.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and I hope you don't lose your hobby because of this.
j0zDQQG2aa	The law of attraction I think is supposed to be some kind of cosmic law that states that expecting positive things and thinking about it will lead to it occurring more, the same as with negative things.<br>  The trouble is that it is not proved and there is barely any evidence to back it up.<br>  Not only that, but the books are often a scam.<br>  <br>  I see positive and negative thought as useful as each other.  I call it realism.<br>  However, positive thought can be beneficial if it boost our confidence, and act in a good way through the placebo affect; but too much will distort out perception, make us take too great risks and so on.<br>  Negative thought will make us cautious, understanding of people's problems; but too much leads to depression and paranoia.<br>  <br>  It is all about balance.<br>  <br>  BUT - It is still worth while to strive for something positive at all times.<br>  <br>  CREED|`|c03b5354b83affe60fb59f4c39c3c193aa	I've never read it, but a lot of New Age thought can't be taken seriously.  In my opinion, it really depends on the person.  Some people really feel great when they think positively. <br>  My theory is: pessimism can be used to your advantage.  I constantly expect the worst that could happen from every situation.  When one expects the worst, they will very rarely be upset with the outcome, because the outcome will usually be better than what one expected - no matter how bad it comes out.  Therefore, all of your suffering is over with before the outcome of the situation.|`|Kr2TIUsAaa	Positive-thinking creates a placebo effect on a human.

These monks focused love into the garden.  Consiquently this garden grew twice as vibrant and its produce was twice the size.|`|d265DZbHaa	It is all to do with focus. Positivity (which is more than just positive thought) sets up an awareness of all the things which will bring success.<br>  <br>  There are those who think it is some sort of ethereal energy however I apply Occam's razer - it still works|`|kO5YwDlBaa	the way u think certainly influences results. therefore, positive thinking is definitely the way forward.|`|0dnfyDWqaa	positive thinking is a bunch of crap...basically it's just lying to yourself to make you feel better. <br>  give yourself the cold bitter truth|`|xXhkRq0Caa	All I know is that when I am around negative thinking people it just drains my energy. You suggest something to get them out of their funk and all they can say is I can't because I'm too tired, my boss hates me, nobody cares about me, she/he is so jealous of me, I can't eat this because it makes me sick etc. etc. etc. That is just plain exhausting! But when you are surrounded by people that are positive and even though they may be going through rough times, they make you want to think about a better tomorrow or better yet how you can contribute to a better tomorrow. Now that is energizing!|`|AA11564934	some positive thinking is obviously better for your well-being than negative thinking.<br>  <br>  But "The Secret" is total crap.

Sometimes, it isn't easy with all the stress going on, but I don't want to get depressed with my negative thoughts  Well, shoot, positive thinking hasn't brought me wealth dogone it. That hasn't entered into my positive thinking.  I am losing my investments with the economy like it is, but if I start thinking negative about it, it would drive me nuts and I don't want to go there. so what happens, happens.  I do the best I can and let the cookies crumble where they do, and bake fresh when I can,  if that's what I need to do and if that makes sense.  I just am who I am.  No books are going to change that.
3L4citcnaa	Aww. It's very cute. I get warm fuzzies just from reading it.<br>  The idea is also very clever.<br>  But if you want to write in a slightly more serious structure, try elongating it and adding in rhetorical devices, rather than just abstract pretty fluff. I'm not being negative, I really liked it! But if I were to turn something like this into my professor, she would laugh and ask where the real one was.

oVxr5B3Eaa	These happen ALL the time in books. I remember in harry potter goblet of fire there was big controversy over what order victims reappeared in. It was incorrect in the original, but fixed in later versions when people picked up on it. <br>  To write a book with a lot of detail, you have to make TONS of notes or you forget a lot of things like that when writing it. This is what editors are here for and why there are more than one edition to many books. I'm sure it will be fixed later on.<br>  <br>  EDIT: haha, about the harry potter thing, yeah, i could see that, but that was the only one i could think of (i know there are more). Take the OC. Kaitlyn is 11 in season 1 and 15 in season 3. Which makes no sense since each season is a year.

The rush of positive feeling when you inflict pain on yourself is your body's natural reaction to physical pain.  The same thing happens when you exercise - your muscles ache, and therefore your brain releases endorphins to null the pain as a sort of natural pain reliever.  When you cut yourself, the brain is trying to calm the physical pain - and those same endorphins also calm your mental pain.<br>  So, we have two relieving things happening - the sharp physical pain gets your mind off of your mental pain, and the chemicals released in your system improves your mood.<br>  A lot of people go through a self-mutilation stage as a stage of growth.  I recommend some other way of getting those chemicals flowing, however - strenuous, aerobic exercise will do the same thing and sometimes make you feel even better.|`|zlQo7WMoaa	Isn't that self-harming?

To do this shows you are the only one who can control this action - which is a both a good and bad thing.  Good that you are in sole control - bad that you choose to exploit your control this way.  To change you would have to realize that you are in control of more aspects of your life - you just have to realize that (if you truly want to change this behavior).|`|2Z7u3Fksaa	It takes your mind of everything<br>  I used to be a cutter and trust me i HATE emos and I wasn't depressed<br>  You like to cut because it feels as if the pain on the inside is rushing out of your body

mzNLfY4Caa	Oh you want to blow it up, I was going to say if you're really having a hard time drawing it, just trace it. But that wouldn't really work if you're putting it on a wall. I have to say, Bam logo is very symetrical and it's hard to draw. Ask your school if you can borrow a projector, then print the logo onto a overhead projector clear sheets. This is what I do when I need to paint a large drawing, and it is seriously the easiest way ever. all you do is position the drawing and trace it.

The Russians and the Russian winter stopped the blitzkrieg there.<br>  The Germans then used the blitzkrieg in the spring of '42 to advance to the Caucasus and the Volga River ( Stalingrad) but the Germans were stopped there and had to go on the defensive for the rest of the war.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	1.

In each case, civilian resistance remained firm.  War production actually increased!|`|N86vHKxtaa	In London, the civilian population made it a point of honor to defy the German blitz by continuing to live as normally as they could.  Churchill recognized that this spirit was a crucial element to winning the war and went out often to show the people they were withstanding the worst the Germans could throw at them.  There are fascinating photos of Londoners living in the subway stations during the bombings and of sending their children away to safer cities.<br>  <br>  Later in the war, the Germans experienced much the same thing during the Allied bombing campaign.  Both sides thought they could crush the spirit of the other by massive bombing campaigns and both were proved wrong.  In some ways, the spirit created by the blitz might have prolonged the war!
AA11898755	I pay 50%. Its well worth it to me to have access to their clientele, mailing list, security and benefits of a high profile, well respected gallery. They pay for insurance, shipping, invitations, announcements, receptions and some advertising. If I want something in a high-end magazine I split the cost with them. I take six students, this is my core "if the market goes to hell I still eat" income. How many galleries are you selling through? Are they actually doing YOU any good or are you in effect enabling them to do nothing for you by accepting bad representation to avoid paying someone who could actually offer you more? A good gallery, good representation increases your prices, increases your exposure and makes you more money. If youre paying them a high percentage and making a good living aren't they saving and making  you more than youre paying them? Don't give up. This is that period where old bast++ds (c'est moi?! mon dieu, NON!!) tell you "we ALL have to pay our dues." If you can manage to manipulate and direct your career through this period of, frankly, reality then you can make the long haul through your entire career. Degrees in art are more common than flea droppings in a dog pound - even MFA's are in the range of 5,000 degrees for every 385 jobs. Good artists are a buck fifty a metric ton. The thing that makes one artist last and another give up is not talent...its tenacity. You're doing all the right stuff...if there's more you can do...a business plan, increasing your aggressive outreach to new AND BETTER galleries in different regions, examining your technique and aesthetic...too mushy? too docile? too hostile, too cluttered, too simple? shows are better solo than group - one artists work can make anothers look weak,...all of this will always be a part of your life. Do it now and do it daily. 'd like to see what you do. Time and tenacity will build you a market.

Hopefully you are in a large metropolitan area. Even better if you are in California, the North East, or in any major city! <br>  <br>  Anyway, what you really need to do is meet the artists you want to become. Join community organizations, find local studio spots in your area, visit local schools and ask if you could talk to some of the graduates getting their MFA's, go to gallery talks and museum talks and branch out and talk to people. This will give you a better sense of the art community you are dealing with and will get your face out there. I would not, however, pass out cards...I'm sure you already know, but never give a card until asked....and just try to get to know people...not sell to them right away. If anything they will help you make better art.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Henry, in which he told of a little girl whose mother had died. When the father would come home from work, he would fix their meal, then he would sit down with his paper and pipe, put his feet up on the mantle, and read. The little girl would come and say, "Father, would you play with me?" And he would say, "No, I'm too tired, I'm too busy. Go out in the street and play." This went on for so long that finally the little girl grew up on the streets, and became what we would call a "streetwalker," a prostitute. Eventually she died, and when, in the story, her soul appeared at the gates of heaven, Peter said to Jesus, "Here's this prostitute. Shall we send her to hell?" Jesus said, "No, no; let her in. But go find the man who refused to play with his little girl, and send him to hell."|`|IfPWWh2zaa	tru

Additionally and complimentary to Containment was the Domino Theory which postulated that the fall of South Vietnam to the Communist North Vietnamese foreces would lead directly to the encouragement of Communist rebels in the area, and would be followed, therefore, by the fall of all of Southeast Asia, and then India, the Philippenes Islands, and eventually a greater threat to Australia.  To combat this feared eventuality, the US joined with many other Asian nations to create SEATO (the Southeast Asian version of NATO) and to commit advisors and massive amounts of supplies to prop up the South Vietnamese government.  LBJ used the Tonkin Gulf Incident to increase his power and to commit large numbers of US ground troops to save a failing situation in Vietnam and to escalate that commitment.  Up unti, the point of the commitment of large scale ground forces, the US could have withdrawan their support of the Southern Government at most any time with only minimal domestic and international political fallout, but once the Marines were in Vietnam in significant numbers, then the US international prestige was on the line, and the US suffered a serious humiliation when it finally had to pull out in 1972-1973.

qyoXSdPCaa	SLAVE, SLAVERY <br>  <br>   A person bound in servitude to another human being as an instrument of labor; one who has lost his liberty and has no rights.<br>   An ancient practice <Gen. 9:25>, slavery existed in several different forms in biblical times. Household or domestic slavery was its most common form; this is illustrated by HAGAR, who lived in the home of Abraham and Sarai <Gen. 16:1> and by Jesus in His parables <Matt. 13:24-30; 21:33-44>. State slavery, another common form, is illustrated by the Israelites' experience under their Egyptian taskmasters <Ex. 5:6-19; 13:3>, and later by Solomon, who enslaved some of the Canaanite peoples <1 Kin. 9:20-21>. Temple slavery is illustrated by the practice of Moses and Joshua, who assigned certain people as slaves to the Levites for Temple service <Num. 31:25-47; Josh. 9:21-27>.<br>   One could purchase slaves, as in the case of Joseph. He was sold into slavery by his brothers for 20 shekels of silver <Gen. 37:28>. Israelites could also buy foreign slaves <Lev. 25:44>. People captured in war frequently became slaves <Gen. 14:21; Num. 31:9>. Occasionally those who wanted slaves might kidnap them, but this practice was forbidden by the Jewish law <Ex. 21:16; 1 Tim. 1:10>.<br>   People could become slaves in several ways. The poor who were unable to pay their debts could offer themselves as slaves <Ex. 21:2-6; Neh. 5:1-5>. A thief who could not repay what he had stolen could also be sold as a slave. Children born of slave parents became "house-born slaves" <Gen. 15:3; 17:12-13>. Sometimes children would be taken as slaves in payment for debts <2 Kin. 4:1-7>.<br>   Treatment of slaves generally depended on the character of the master <Gen. 24; 39:1-6>. But a set of regulations governed the treatment of domestic slaves <Ex. 21; Deut. 15>. Repeatedly, Israel was instructed by the law not to rule over a fellow Israelite harshly <Lev. 25:39; Deut. 15:14>. If a master beat a slave or harmed him, the law provided that the slave could go free <Ex. 21:26-27>; and the killing of a slave called for a penalty <Ex. 21:20>.<br>   Slaves were allowed to secure their freedom. Under the Jewish law, no Hebrew was to be the permanent slave of another Hebrew. After six years of service, a slave was to be released <Ex. 21:2; Deut. 15:12>. In the Year of JUBILEE, no matter how long a slave had served, he was to be released <Lev. 25:37-43>. If a slave desired to continue with his master, he would have a mark made in the ear; this mark would signify that he had chosen to remain a slave <Ex. 21:5-6>. A slave could also buy his freedom, or another person could buy his freedom for him <Lev. 25:47-49>.<br>   Among the Romans in New Testament times, freedom for a slave could be arranged if ownership was transferred to a god. The slave could then receive his freedom in return for contracting his services. He would continue with his master, but now as a free man.<br>   The Bible contains warnings about the practice of slavery. The prophet Amos spoke woe to Gaza and Tyre for their practices of slave-trading entire populations <Amos 1:6-9>. The Book of Revelation declares that disaster awaits those who sell slaves <Rev. 18:13>. As for Christians, the apostle Paul advised slaves to obey their masters <Eph. 6:5; Col. 3:22; Titus 2:9>. Paul appealed to Philemon to receive back Onesimus, a runaway slave who was now a Christian and therefore a brother <Philem. 1:16>. Elsewhere Paul counseled believing slaves to seek freedom if they could <1 Cor. 7:21>. Since slave practices were part of the culture in biblical times, the Bible contains no direct call to abolish slavery. But the implications of the gospel, especially the ethic of love, stand in opposition to slavery.<br>   Both slave and free are called upon to receive the gospel of Jesus Christ. In Christ, social distinctions such as slavery no longer apply <Gal. 3:28; Col. 3:11>; in Christ all are brothers and sisters. The excitement of such new relationships is expressed by Paul: "Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ" <Gal. 4:7>.<br>   In a spiritual sense, people apart from Christ are slaves to sin. To commit sin is to demonstrate that sin has control of one's life <John 8:34>. Christ can set us free from this kind of slavery <John 8:36>-- to be obedient to Christ and to do righteousness <Rom. 6:16-18>.<br>   Paul spoke of himself as a "servant," a word sometimes rendered as "bondservant" but frequently also as "slave" <Rom. 1:1; Titus 1:1>. Christians, especially ministers, are not hired servants but slaves committed to service to Jesus. A slave does not manage his own life. The person who calls himself a slave of Christ acknowledges that the Savior has power over him.<br>  (from Nelson's Illustrated Bible Dictionary)<br>  (Copyright (C) 1986, Thomas Nelson Publishers)|`|3L4citcnaa	You're going to have to be much more specific.

rtsfPQqMaa	I’m a little confused by the discussion- but NO Palestine was never a true country:<br>  <br>  The term "Palestine" is believed to be derived from the Philistines, an Aegean people who, in the 12th Century B.C.E., settled along the Mediterranean coastal plain of what are now Israel and the Gaza Strip. In the second century C.E., after crushing the last Jewish revolt, the Romans first applied the name Palaestina to Judea (the southern portion of what is now called the West Bank) in an attempt to minimize Jewish identification with the land of Israel. The Arabic word "Filastin" is derived from this Latin name.3<br>  <br>  The Hebrews entered the Land of Israel about 1300 B.C.E., living under a tribal confederation until being united under the first monarch, King Saul. The second king, David, established Jerusalem as the capital around 1000 B.C.E. David's son, Solomon built the Temple soon thereafter and consolidated the military, administrative and religious functions of the kingdom. The nation was divided under Solomon's son, with the northern kingdom (Israel) lasting until 722 B.C.E., when the Assyrians destroyed it, and the southern kingdom (Judah) surviving until the Babylonian conquest in 586 B.C.E. The Jewish people enjoyed brief periods of sovereignty afterward before most Jews were finally driven from their homeland in 135 C.E. <br>  <br>  Jewish independence in the Land of Israel lasted for more than 400 years. This is much longer than Americans have enjoyed independence in what has become known as the United States.4 In fact, if not for foreign conquerors, Israel would be 3,000 years old today.<br>  <br>  Palestine was never an exclusively Arab country, although Arabic gradually became the language of most the population after the Muslim invasions of the seventh century. No independent Arab or Palestinian state ever existed in Palestine. When the distinguished Arab-American historian, Princeton University Prof. Philip Hitti, testified against partition before the Anglo-American Committee in 1946, he said: "There is no such thing as 'Palestine' in history, absolutely not."5<br>  <br>  Prior to partition, Palestinian Arabs did not view themselves as having a separate identity. When the First Congress of Muslim-Christian Associations met in Jerusalem in February 1919 to choose Palestinian representatives for the Paris Peace Conference, the following resolution was adopted:<br>  <br>  We consider Palestine as part of Arab Syria, as it has never been separated from it at any time. We are connected with it by national, religious, linguistic, natural, economic and geographical bonds.6<br>  <br>  In 1937, a local Arab leader, Auni Bey Abdul-Hadi, told the Peel Commission, which ultimately suggested the partition of Palestine: "There is no such country [as Palestine]! 'Palestine' is a term the Zionists invented! There is no Palestine in the Bible. Our country was for centuries part of Syria."7<br>  <br>  The representative of the Arab Higher Committee to the United Nations submitted a statement to the General Assembly in May 1947 that said "Palestine was part of the Province of Syria" and that, "politically, the Arabs of Palestine were not independent in the sense of forming a separate political entity." A few years later, Ahmed Shuqeiri, later the chairman of the PLO, told the Security Council: "It is common knowledge that Palestine is nothing but southern Syria."8<br>  <br>  Palestinian Arab nationalism is largely a post-World War I phenomenon that did not become a significant political movement until after the 1967 Six-Day War and Israel's capture of the West Bank.<br>  <br>  Now, on my Grandfather’s Nationalization papers (came to the US in 1939, he was listed as country of origin being Palestine).  There is recognition of the territory as being a separate State, however has never been officially mandated.<br>  <br>  It is also OUTRAGOUS that you were given detention for raising a valid question for debate.  As someone who teaches history, your teacher should know that subject is always up for discussion. The problem arises when there is uncritical acceptance of anything that is written or taught. I did so research into Palestine for this and found that whether or not Palestine was a true country is widely debated and confused, partly because the territory has gone through so many mandates and political/social changes since 1918.<br>  <br>  With that said you should not be punished for raising a question that I think you are correct about.  Also, No teacher is infallible the way that no text book history is absolutely correct.|`|H2v3QFWRaa	i'm not sure about any of this but maybe this will help.

There has never been any such nation/State. From the Ancient Persians through the British Empire, any semblance of government there has always been colonial governance. <br>  Modern "Palestinians" are almost all Jordanian and Egyptian exiles plus a generation or two of their descendants.<br>  No one had land "stolen" from them to form Israel. It was a modern incarnation of a "no man's land" at the time Israel was formed. Bordering nations (Syria, Jordan, Lebanon) disputed the territory in OPPOSITE fashion of the usual border conflict.

lPxVt2XYaa	There were several major flaws with the Bolsheviks.<br>  Politically they were wedded to an ideology that believed in dictatorship = "the dictatorship of the proletariat".  They never set out what they meant by communism, except that it would involve a "withering away of the state" - something that in 70 years they conspicuously failed to achieve.<br>  Economically they were naive.  By taking ownership of the means of production - all of them, including small businesses, shops and farms, they ensured that there was no competition for goods or services, therefore there was no need to improve products, not was there any incentive to innovate and try new methods.<br>  Socially they were also naive, using Marx's crude method of dividing people into classes where as the difference between a skilled machine operator and a labourer is as marked as that between a doctor and a lawyer.  They also expected people to be altruistic and work for the betterment of mankind, with very little reward.<br>  But their biggest failing was that they did not reform the party after achieving power in 1917.  The party was formed in illegal opposition - sometimes it acted in a terroristic manner, robbing banks, assassinations, blackmail etc.  To ensure that the party did not all get arrested when one was captured, they operated a cell system, where one member only knew the people in their cell.  This worked well in Tsarist times, but in government it allowed a manipulative Stalin to bully, to collect information and eventually to dominate the party.<br>  See:<br>  The October Revolution - Roy Medvedev<br>  A History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union - Leonard Shapiro|`|N86vHKxtaa	Bolshevik translates as larger or greater.

cFiOTJ7jaa	I've just read both the poems for the first time (and just for you! How nice...), so I'll give you what I see as the main similarities and contrasts. Hopefully they're the kind of thing you're looking for.<br>  <br>  <br>  The most important or significant thing that the poems have in common is surely this: they are both about GENDER.<br>  <br>  Both poems are written from a female perspective, and both are about a male-dominated world. (We might say that they are about "women in a man's world".) 'Cousin Kate', for example, is about a 'cottage maiden' who is mistreated by a 'great Lord'. She is 'lured' by the Lord into degrading herself, and her life is ruined by the selfish man. Once the man has cast her aside, he then does the same thing to her cousin, except this time he makes it permanent by marrying. Cousin Kate is described as 'bound' by the man's ring - its as if the ring is not only bound round Kate's finger, but round her whole body: she's trapped in the marriage.<br>  'Still I Rise' is similar. It too is from a female perspective, although this time it's less obvious. We are told, however, that the she dances 'like I've got diamonds/At the meeting of my thighs', which is a reference to her vagina (it's quite an obvious image - thighs simply 'meeting'). She also mentions her 'sassiness', 'haughtiness', and 'sexiness', which are qualities traditionally associated with women (particularly 'sassiness', which means "saucy"). The 'you' that she it talking to in the poem, then, can be assumed to be male. And, like the 'cottage maiden' in the other poem, she too has been mistreated by a man (or men). Thus she writes about his/their 'bitter twisted lies' and the fact that he/they 'trod me in the very dirt'. So both poems are about women being mistreated by men.<br>  <br>  Both poems also, however, take the same stance towards this male-dominated world: both women have strong, angry voices, and stand defiant against men who they hate. In 'Cousin Kate', the speaker says that she would 'spit into his face' and turn down his marriage proposal. And in 'Still I Rise', the speaker repeats again and again that no matter what men do to her, she will always get up again, she will rise, she will rise. She will not be 'broken', she will not bow her head or lower her eyes.<br>  <br>  <br>  The poems most obviously differ, however, in this way: 'Cousin Kate' is solely about gender, but 'Still I Rise' is also about slavery and race.<br>  <br>  'Cousin Kate' is all about the power possessed by men and the powerlessness of women. The 'cottage maiden' and Kate are under the power of the Lord, and have no power of their own entirely because they are women. They live in a society - a patriarchal society - where men are totally in control and they are nothing more than the 'playthings' for the men. At the end of the poem, the 'cottage maiden' treasures her baby, and she treasures her baby because it is MALE - this is her only pleasure in life, knowing that her baby won't be a mere 'plaything' but will have a powerful place in the world because it will be a man. 'Cousin Kate' doesn't have a baby boy, and so we are told that Kate's father will be disappointed. Male babies are more valued than female babies.<br>  'Still I Rise', however, is not only about gender but about race and slavery. 'I am the dream and the hope of the slave' she says, and so we know that the speaker is a black slave (this idea is supported by our knowledge of the poet who is also a black American woman). The 'you' that she talks to in the poem, then, can also be thought of as white people, or slave owners, or colonists who took control of Africa for its 'oil wells' and 'gold mines' and 'diamonds'. This idea, however, has important gender implications, and so even though the poem is also about race and slavery, it is always about gender too... and I'll need to explain why.<br>  When Britain (and other countries) had an empire and colonised Africa, the colonisers were always thought of as male and Africa was thought of as female. So when Britain took control of Africa, this was though of in gendered and sexual terms: Britain was penetrating, violating, and raping Africa, entering its virginal, mysterious, dark and bushy territory and taking everything that was valuable - gold, diamonds, oil. And this is why the image of the speaker dancing 'like I've got diamonds/At the meeting of my thighs' is so effective - she is a woman with a precious vagina between her legs which men want to and do take violently, but she is also Africa itself, which masculine colonists want to penetrate and take those precious diamonds from. <br>  <br>  So while the poems differ in that 'Still I Rise' is also about race and slavery, BOTH poems are about gender. Both poems are about the mistreatment of women in a man's world.

Of course not!<br>  <br>  I would come clean with her and just say that in this economy, you feel that the benefits you have given her are being taken advantage. That's not fair to you. <br>  <br>  You need to stand up for yourself and re-negotiate her contract. Give the opportunity to either pay for two kids and stick to the rules or find a new sitter. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't worry about WHY they are at day care IF THEY ARE PAYING. You should have requested that she pay for that day care spot when she told you that she was pregnant. That's what most day cares around here do. <br>  <br>  A healthy way to get control is to 1) get advice of fellow providers and 2) be straightforward with her. <br>  <br>  This is YOUR business, and it's time to regain control.|`|9PA4f19gaa	She should pay for your time like everyone else.  Business is business.  Her personal problems and or lifestye should not effect how you handle business with her.  This is the root of your problem.  Also it sounds a like you might be feeling taken advantage of by her.  If this is true you will feel much better if you explain to her your viewpoint of the situation.

Jacobs point of view was an important part of the story. Seriously all you girls need to stop obsessing over "omg edwards way better than jacob."

It was interesting to see in his head for a change.<br>  Some parts were kind of boring, But like i mentioned, It was interesting to see what he was thinking.|`|xw6XRcN7aa	I think it should be Bella's point of view too. I mean, we all know that Jacob loved Bella and all, but  I really wanted to know what happened with her, i mean she was practically being eaten alive, inside out.....|`|2dYbeBmeaa	Definetly, i am a team Jacob and it was very interesting to see more of the book in his POV.|`|cek7fcU4aa	It was frustrating---she should have done EDWARD instead-grrrr! I liked the names of the chapters tho!!!|`|If2ww2i9aa	Yes i think it should have been included because bella wouldnt have been able to tell us what was happening while she was giving birth.lol.<br>  I love both Jacob and Edward:)<br>  And i agree that people who hate twilight should just not answer the quetstions.lol.|`|ZgNPIlWFaa	i know your going to hate me but i liked that she gave jacob's POV because if it was bella's all we would read was how weak she was and how sitting on the Cullen's couch was. but with jake we understood how weak she was so i am glad S.

What class are ou taking where you have to read the Hrolf Kraki Saga?<br>  2. Just guessing here, but I think that they might be similar stories, showing evidence that the cultures intermixed (Like how the Epic of Gilgamesh is similar to the story of Noah's Ark).  Especially since Viking raiders invaded and plundered Northern England and Scotland in the 900's-1000's.
R5UIMBvcaa	Hrolf Kraki actually appears in Beowulf!  He's Hrothgar's nephew Hrothulf, who is sitting, rather ominously, next to Unferth at the feast the evening before the attack of Grendel's mother. <br>  <br>  In Beowulf, Hrothulf seems to be seen as a future usurper, who acts as a foil to Beowulf by making Beowulf's refusal of the Geatish throne the first time it's offered to him seem all the nobler.   Remember this passage:  After the Lay of Finn, in which one of the major characters is the nameless queen who is caught in a family tragedy when war breaks out between her husband's people and those of her brother, Wealtheow, Hrothgar's queen, carries a goblet to certain honored guests.  She reminds Hrothulf of how she and Hrothgar took him in when he was an orphan child and says that she knows that, should Hrothgar die before their sons are grown, she can count on Hrothulf to protect their rights.  But Hrothulf is sitting next to Unferth, who is known to have killed his brothers, and we know from other Norse sources that Hrothulf later became Kng of the Danes. One modern commentary on Beowulf even says that the orignal audience would have known that Hrothulf usurped the throne after Hrothgar's death, but no contemporary source says any such thing--merely that he became King.  Maybe the simple knowledge that he did would have made the passage seem ominous and chilling.<br>  <br>  This incident is only one of several refernces in Beowulf to Norse mythology and legend.  Earlier that same day, when the Danes and their Geatish guests are riding back from the mere where Grendel's bloody footprints lead, someone sings about Sigmund's slaying of a dragon and of an adventure involving Sigmund and his nephew "Fitela."  These are characters who, several centuries later, appear in the Volsunga Saga, where it's Sigmund's son Sigurd who kills a dragon.  And of course .the Lay of Finn tells another part of the story preserved in another, fragmentary, Old English poem, The Fight at Finnsburg.<br>  <br>  Is this enough evidence of connections between the Anglo-Saxon adn Scandinavian cultures?  Although the Anglo-Saxon/Old English langauge is not descended form Old Norse, as the modern Scandinavian languages are, the Germanic languages were still all fairly closely related in the period when these stories supposedly took place--around the time fo the Fall of Rome.  And keep in mind tht the Angles and Jutes migrated to Britain from what is now Denmark.  The area was actually called Angeln until the mass emigration to Britain left it nearly uninhabited and open to settlement by the Danes.

You would never find the meaning of existence by that standard.<br>  <br>  I said this for 6 months till I got to the top of the Philosophy ladder here: ethical behavior, character and integrity, are the means to be happy, and as long as you practice any virtue that gains you those things you can't miss the meaning--or miss finding happiness.

A knowledge of truth is happiness since Man, as a rational being, naturally desires after knowledge, as Aristotle has it in the very beginning of this Metaphysics. Now since happiness consists in the attainment of that quality to which every agent moves according to the highest faculty of his nature, for Man the highest happiness possible must consist in knowledge, and this must be the knowledge of its highest object possible, which is God, since Man is a rational creature which means that Man acts as Man when he acts according to the reason for the rational faculty is that whereby Man is distinguished as Man.|`|y8bFwXZEaa	If that is happiness, how would you know you've attained it since it is made of something you are not capable of comprehending?<br>  <br>  Happines is simply the state of being happy--for whatever reason, but usually it is attained by practicing virtues.

Happiness, being something we value, will come when we practice any virtue that gets it for us.<br>  <br>  But actions that compromise our character and integrity won't do it.

I guess you don't believe there is no truth, but you hear lots of people say it, so you want to find out how true it is.<br>  <br>  Truth is the recognition of reality, nothing more, nothing less. 12 jurors are asked to "recognize" the truth in either what the defense says or in what the prosecutor says.<br>  <br>  A man jumps from a ledge recognizing the reality that being squashed on the sidewalk will kill him.<br>  <br>  Race car drivers build "cages" in their cars and wear fire-proof clothing recognizing the reality that these things help save lives.<br>  <br>  See what I mean?

u1XplU3Xaa	Well I don't believe a person can be perfect because everyone has faults. Yet if you ask someone to do you a favor I think that could be perfection. E.g. If you ask someone to bake you a cake and it is perfectly good and better than you expected than that could be perfection. But that is not necessarily true and is just my opinion.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.<br>  <br>  Lubbyluu x|`|t5mX3rwLaa	I believe perfection is a subjective issue, what may be considered perfection for one, might not be so for another, like when you meet someone and you say, you′re perfect for me, it doesn't mean she would be for any other guy. I do consider some things that have happened to me to have been perfect at the time.|`|PxVDtnSzaa	Perfection is God, good true and beautiful. We were created in his image and strive to be like Him, but we are fallen (separated from God) and thus need salvation. Justly, we should be condemned for our sin. We, as in, humanity. (Sin = separation from God) We will suffer eternal separation from God (Hell) if we do not accept the salvation that was extended to us by Christ, who was wholly man and wholly God. By "taking on the sin of the world" in the perfect sacrifice, Christ gave us the ability to be joined with God again. In the end, this life will pass and we will "begin" our new lives in eternity. Whether that eternity is spent in separation or communion with God is our choice.<br>  <br>  And shoot, my choice is most definitely the latter.<br>  <br>  And that is my worldview, my reason for living. <br>  <br>  Perfection is God.|`|zJ8ZpZZIaa	There is no such thing as literal perfection (at least in my opinion). No matter how "well off" someone is, there is always some type of setback or grievance.|`|9PA4f19gaa	God is perfection.

If you make perfection about your own subjective preferences you've already flawed the system because everyone has a different idea about what "perfection" really means.<br>  <br>  Thus perfection must be "objective" and free from the whims of silly misguided human beings.<br>  <br>  Personally, I realize that the only way things can exist is exactly as they are. So I like to think of "perfection" as something necessary for existence. Therefore, everything is perfect, because there's only one way it all can be and if perfection is even possible it must relate to things as they are.|`|d265DZbHaa	Perfection is a con; a joke dumped on the unaware.

LeFkaKhOaa	The Vampire Diaries-L.J. Smith. VERY GOOD!!!!! I know you don't want to read about vamps, but you need to read this one!!!!!!!!!! The first book is The Awakening and The Struggle (Two books are combined in one. This was a 4 book series, but they condensed it into 2 and republished it) Recently, Nightfall, a 3rd book, has come out.<br>  <br>  The House of Night series-P.C Cast + Kristen Cast. EXTREMELY GOOD!!!! It gets better each book!! First book: Marked. This has alot of cussing and dirty talk, so only read this if you are very mature.<br>  <br>  Uglies series- Scott Westerfeld. An amazing sci fi. Truly amazing. First book: Uglies.<br>  <br>  Midnighters-Scott Westerfeld. I didn't really think it would be good, but I was out of books for the moment so I checked it out, and it was really good! Better than I thought. Scott Westerfeld is an awsome writer.<br>  <br>  Maximum Ride-James Patterson. Really good!!! Prepare to soar, literally! First book: Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment.<br>  <br>  Skinned- Robin Wasserman. Another cool sci fi. <br>  <br>  Warriors series-Erin Hunter. If you are a cat lover, or enjoy animal stories, then you would probably like this one. There are three separate series in this, so be sure to get the very first one. It is Into the Wild.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped! Most of these are becoming movies, too! You should also just browse Barnes & Nobles, too.

fWxtrZ2Faa	Well, the books by Paulo Coelho got me interested in philosophy in the first place, so I definitely recommend them. Also the books by Richard Bach, especially Illusions: the adventures of a reluctant Messiah. These are strange books, they often have very occult themes and ideas, but are still very interesting if you're open to new ideas. Or try books by Hermann Hesse or Kahlil Gibran, although they may seem a bit heavy.<br>  <br>  Also, for non-fiction, try Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor E. Frankl, it's about him while he was in a Nazi concentration camp, a really excellent book.<br>  <br>  Also, many, many books offer insight into philosophy, To Kill A Mockingbird for instance, a really, really great book from which you can learn a lot but it doesn't directly have anything to with philosophy.|`|y8bFwXZEaa	Albert Camus and Ayn Rand are two modern favorties. Rand's "Atlas Shrugged" is the only known novel written from the principles of the epistemologies of the characters. As the famous train tunnel accident takes place, 10 characters in 10 passenger cars are picked out for their epistemologies and their deaths in the tunnel are explained in these terms. But the protagonists are written from this point of view, also.<br>  In "Anthem" Rand lays out her beginning framework for "rational egoism." <a href="http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/texts/anthem/complete.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.noblesoul.com/orc/texts/anthe...</a> It has been called the most beautiful prose poem ever written.<br>  Atlas Shrugged, which will star Angelina Jolie (and maybe Brad, too) is the one book you either hate or love.

YlRMabZ4aa	A German shepherd seems fine, but if you want something else here are a few breeds to look into.<br>  <br>  A Newfoundland could work, do not look like shepherds(more like hairy mastiffs after all they are a mastiff) and may be on the lazy side, but they are extremely loyal. Borboels are another good breed, they are a large mastiff that originated in South Africa, but like the newf they lack the pointy ears and the kind of tail your looking for. Then there are the shepherd breeds. Anatolian has the tail, but not the ears and are almost always tan(im assuming you want something dark). Then there is the Belgian shepherd, and tervuren shepherd that have similar appearances to the German shepard but with more hair. Akita's in a way also look like shepherds, although they come in more colors and tend to have a curled tail. Good luck there are a lot of breeds out there to choose from. Another breed to consider would be the Irish wolf hound and great dane, both are tall dogs and supposed to be very loyal. Another thing to consider is having a mix, so it can have the shepherd-like appearance your looking for, and other qualities that you want in the dog.|`|ac2x3YbLaa	If you're looking for an imposing dog, but a loyal and faithful dog, you can't go wrong with an Irish Wolf Hound.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/images15/IrishWolfhoundFrankBrendan.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/images15/Iri...</a><br>  <br>  That picture gives you a rough Idea about how big they are, this next link covers the care and feeding of one.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/irishwolfhound.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/irishwolfhou...</a><br>  <br>  Raven|`|hGVkInSnaa	Chows are pretty bad ***.

46IiIKyXaa	You have to scan the negatives on a scanner or find a digital imaging place to do it for you. A good quality scanner will run you a the least $300 so if you are only using it once , have a pro do it. I would contact your wedding photographer, they should be able to help you or refer someone who can. Make sure you have the photos put on archival discs because after a few years the average disc will not hold up and you could lose some of your photos, even archival can lose data eventually so store them properly and check them every few years.

I seem to remember that Carlos Santana had an instrumental piece: Snows of the Kilimanjaro from his Bebop album, which is really nice and very unusual. For something airy and ethereal you could look up "Aire" (air) from a group called Mecano which started out in the 80's in Spain and became one of the most famous and best beloved. The girl's voice is simply eerie and beautiful, her name is Ana Torroja, and she still sings. <br>  "Tu Chica Ye-ye" (Your ye-ye girl), from another Spanish band called Ole Ole and the vocalist was Martha Sanchez. Vangelis, from his China Album has a violin solo which is quite impressive. An impressive vocal solo is found on the Dark Side of the Moon from Pink Floyd. Native American powow chants are quite impressive, I mean, if you are into something different. You can listen to the Native American channel on accuradio.com, or some celtic for some catchy Irish traditional music. I found Joanne Shenandoah's "Mother Earth Speaks" particularly poignant, it drove the message home with a simple melody that revolves around the way we mistreat our planet, so the environmental angle can also be explored. It is available on YouTube for you to listen to. I also found some Indian music from Bollywood productions which are full of rythms. Maybe Ladysmith Black Mambazo can provide some more inspiration because they hardly use instruments other than their own voices. Anuna has some real interesting choral stuff and Andreas Vollenweider also has some cool stuff worth listening to. Meave, an Irish singer has some very nice melodies in her Silver Sea Album, I especially like You Brought Me up, beause the melody is simple, beautiful, it tells a story and provides plenty of opportunities to bring drama into the dance. Enya has some impressive melodies like Adiemus. Check out some Putumayo samplers and you will find many exotic rythms. Any Cirque de Soleil music is sure to call your attention. Tubular Bells by Mike Oldfield is very interesting, although some people might find it disturbing because it is from the movie, the Exorcist. I also listened to Skorpokon, from the Transformers Movie Soundtrack, and although it repeats itself some, it does build up towards a climax. There is a smashing pumpkins song there too, but the name escapes me.

Q4MqzxX7aa	Edward. He's got the best power.<br>  <br>  I think if my self esteem was as low as Bella's I would top myself.|`|TAIlyvgyaa	Whoever dies first.<br>  <br>  That way my nightmare would be over at the first opportunity.|`|ftI1Hny8aa	Probably Alice, I mean come on she gets to be cute and bubbly and be married to Jasper. Plus seeing the future would be cool. I'd like to be Renesmee too so I could be with Jacob, but no man is worth going through life with the name Renesmee.|`|2QiLmXfhaa	Bella. Gosh I'd make the most of having Edward Cullen in love with me! Lol. <br>  Its also awesome how she becomes a vampire so she gets to be both.

You can read every ones mind which has to be fun, you have a cool hair colour and i love his personality. Well, most of it. If I was Edward, I would be less commanding and dominating and be more easy-going. <br>  <br>  If you can't change genders I would pick Alice. The versions would be cool and you have a brilliant boyfriend. Its always good to be happy and her pixie-like nature rocks. She also has great fashion sense and is easy to get along with.|`|W9FnwTqfaa	Bella, because she gets everything.<br>  <br>  She has a lifetime- no more than that, to master any skill she wants.<br>  Bella is my favorite character.<br>  She gets cool friends, a daughter, a husband, and gets to stay young!

gGZz2EGyaa	Charles famously engaged in a struggle for power with the Parliament of England. He was an advocate of the Divine Right of Kings which was the belief that kings received their power from God. This Divine right of Kings could not be taken away even if he was stripped of his power. Many subjects of England feared that he was attempting to gain absolute power. Many of his actions, particularly the levying of taxes without Parliament's consent, caused widespread opposition<br>  <br>  <br>  He remained defiant by attempting to forge an alliance with Scotland and escaping to the Isle of Wight. This provoked a Second Civil War (1648–49) and a second defeat for Charles, who was subsequently captured, tried, convicted, and executed for high treason. The monarchy was then abolished and a republic called the Commonwealth of England, also referred to as the Cromwellian Interregnum, was declared. <br>  <br>  Tried not to make it too long but that's the reason he was beheaded.|`|EBqFpZbjaa	Charles Stewart was beheaded because he was a traitor and had conducted war against his own people.<br>  <br>  POWER TO THE PEOPLE|`|gUCjkj9oaa	so that he couldnt be king anymore.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	At the end of the First Civil War (1646) Charles surrendered to the Scots, who handed him over to Parliament. Negotiations for a political settlement were spun out by Charles, who was secretly trying to forge new alliances. This led to an outbreak of a Second Civil War in 1647 (NOT 1648). After Parliament had won this war, Cromwell, by now the most powerful man in the country, blamed Charles for the war. He therefore had him tried as a war criminal and executed. (January 1649)<br>   It should be pointed out the trial was of, at best, dubious legality - Cromwell pressurised  and intimidated the judges (which were hard to find for such a trial in the first place) into both a guilty verdict and a death sentence.|`|cwJrCcguaa	Because he was Royalty.<br>  <br>  Hanging etc. was only for us lower classes.|`|p1gzHgAraa	why cant you just google that info? your on the computer so look it up.

byjniI5raa	Singapore-born inventor Craven Walker was having a pint in post W.W.II England. The pub's decor included a fascinating lamp, which Craven Walker described as a "contraption made out of a cocktail shaker, old tins and things." It was to become the starting point and inspiration for Craven Walker's design.<br>  <br>  The liquid-filled inventor proceeded to purchase the equally liquid-filled lamp, whose creator (Mr. Dunnett) Walker later discovered had died. Walker became determined to make a better version of the novelty item and spent the next decade and a half doing so (inbetween running an international house-swap agency and making films about nudism.) Walker worked on improving the lamp with his company the Crestworth Company of Dorset, England.<br>  <br>  Initially local retail merchants thought his lamps were ugly and disgusting. Luckily, for Craven Walker the "Psychedelic Movement" and the "Love Generation" came to dominate 60's merchandising in Great Britain and sales of the lava lamp soared. It was the perfect light for modern times, Walker declared. "If you buy my lamp, you won't need to buy drugs."<br>  <br>  Craven Walker perfected a secret Lava recipe of oil, wax and other solids. The original model had a large gold base with tiny holes to simulate starlight, and a 52 oz. globe that contained red or white Lava and yellow or blue liquid. He marketed the lamp in Europe under the name of Astro Lamp. Two American entrepreneurs saw the lava lamp displayed at a German trade show and bought the rights to manufacture the lava lamp in North America under the name Lava Lite lamp.<br>  <br>  Before selling his company, sales of the lamps had exceeded seven million units. Today with over 400,000 lava lamps made each year, the Lava Lamp is enjoying a comeback. Craven Walker's originally company, the Crestworth Company, changed names to Mathmos in 1995 (a reference to the bubbling force in Barbarella.) They still manufacture the Astro, Astro Baby, and more Lava Lamps in their original home of Poole, Dorset, UK.<br>  <br>  <br>  How the Basic Lava Lamp Works - Parts<br>  Base: Holds a 40 watt frosted appliance light bulb inside a reflecting cone. This cone rests on a second cone, which houses the light bulb socket and electrical cord connection. The electrical cord has a small in-line switch on it and a standard US 120v plug.<br>  Lamp: A glass container containing two fluids, called water and lava, both trade secrets. A metal cap seals the top of the lamp. There is a small amount of air at the very top of the lamp. Loose at the bottom of the lamp is a small coil of wire called the element.<br>  <br>  Top Cap: A small plastic cover over the top of the lamp which serves to both hide the lamp's inner cap and the waterline.<br>  <br>  <br>  When turned off and cold, the lava is a hard lump at the bottom of the glass container and can barely be seen. <br>  The turned on light bulb heats both the element and the lava. <br>  Lava expands with heat, becomes less dense than the water, and rises to the top. Away from the heat, the lava cools and becomes denser than the water and falls. <br>  The lava at the bottom reheats and begins to rise all over again and as long as the lamp is on, the lava keeps flowing in pleasing up-and-down waves. <br>  Initially lamps require a warm-up period of about 30 minutes to melt the lava before going into full motion.<br>  Today's modern lava lamp use Borosilicate glass that can withstand quick extremes in temperature.
k5f1lDmXaa	These are my favorite books ever - i've read the first five and can't wait for Ghost Hunter to come out. I know the first three have been made into audio books, read by Ian Mc Kellen, and 20th Century Fox have apparently started to produce a feature film series. I hope Chronicles of ancient darkness become more popular, because they are such amazing books and Michelle Paver put so much effort into making them as historically accurate as possible - she even traveled around the world meeting tribes and wild animals to learn their behavior first-hand.|`|l4seJCEXaa	no plans i think...THEY FRIGGIN ROCK!!! i read them all in dutch and they rocked and then i read the first one in english and its soooooo much better|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I don't believe there are films - but I wouldn't be surprised if there will be at some point.<br>  <br>  I agree, they are excellent books. My 9 year old came back from school one day (Michelle Paver came and gave a talk to them) and said "you have to read this", and he was right.|`|lHLbefqsaa	I got bored of the books after Spirit Walker =/<br>  I haven't heard anything about them being made into films.
