20090202104527AAmDgZ0	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	New Blackberry 8320 or 8110?	Hey all. Im buying a new phone today. I love Blackberry and Nokia and its a personal choice to never use anything other than that ...      Currently i have a Nokia 6600 Fold (Foreign) and i love it!!! The only reason why im getting a new phone is because i need something for when i need my emails a bit quicker and more internet reliability. Not to mention the AT&T support on an actual AT&T device would be great cause i have no device support nor help line when something goes wrong, since again- my Nokia is foreign.      So its come down to the BB 8320 and 8110!! I've had many blackberries before, but i really dont know on this one. What do yall think? The size difference and battery life are the only real difference since Update 4.5 pretty much balances them out. So i need help ...

IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO READ MY STORY, JUST SKIP TO THE BOTTOM AND WHAT IS IN CAP LOCKS, IS THE QUESTION, SIMPLIFIED.         Here is the story for the first question. OK so i got an iPod touch for christmas and i love it! But since all my family is in California my mom and dad decided we open our presents there. So when we got there, on christmas day, we all opened our gifts. Now i was so eager and impatient that i decided to use my uncles computer to put songs on my ipod. So thats what i did... NOW when I got home, I decided to put more songs on it from my computer. When i plugged in my ipod iTunes said that all my music that had been imported from the other itunes library had to be erased if i wanted to put songs on it from another itunes library.       SO IS THERE ANYWAY, THAT I CAN SOMEHOW SAVE THE MUSIC FROM MY IPOD, GET SONGS FROM ANOTHER ITUNES LIBRARY, AND THEN WHEN IM DONE, PUT IN MY OLD SONGS AS WELL? LIKE CAN I SOMEHOW MOVE THE SONGS INTO THE LIBRARY SO I CAN STILL HAVE MY OLD SONGS?

20061217184739AAAiLSf	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	How can I get the main screen to work on my LG VX8300?	I dropped it into a sink full of water and retrieved it immediately; I dried it off and removed the battery and dried it off as well (there were a few drops of water on it, nothing major). Now the main screen is just blank white. The phone works fine otherwise; I can make and receive calls as normal, and the front screen works fine, too. Is there anything I can do? Will I need to take the phone back to Verizon to be fixed? Will I have to get a new phone entirely?
