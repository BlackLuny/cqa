20090308030441AA5kVwa	News & Events;Current Events	What forces regiment do you find the most overrated?	Remember my father harp on about the French Foreign Legion to all who would listen - well...as a Frenchman he would, wouldn't he (despite the majority of the regiment being German nowadays). Remember the early years of the Thatcher government, with the sexy antics of the SAS at embassies and in countries around the world getting front page privilege wherever they went. Of course, twenty or so years on, ex-fighters have jumped on the author bandwagon, with readers eventually lapping up the latest Andy McNab et al books before bragging about their 'period in the SAS' in order to get free booze or a shag for the night. Then of course there are various American 'fighting machines' who claim to kick ANY butt available...so why are there still wars (with Ulster in the current news again for death of two soldiers in Antrim).    Realise some dear will squeal that the questioner 'knows nowt' about how armies operate, but wonder when governments (and the populist press) will admit that some wars are not that easy to win...if at all.

I see the Government (UK) is considering dropping the speed limit on single carriageway country roads from 60 to 50 mph.  Is this just another means to extract money, by way of speeding fines, from the already over-taxed motorist?  Is this reduction justified?  Always supposing the traffic (congestion) conditions will actually allow anybody to go above 50 these days!!!

No link - I'm just curious  from reading on here and in the press , there seems to be a growing outrage on any money spent on things that appear surperfluous.      Be that anything considered cultural in terms of buildings, heritage, performances/events or even things that make areas look better.      As someone who grow up in the 80's all the 'nice' things in my local ares were annihilated and left to rot. These things were never regained even in times of plenty that followed. They were replaced with other lovely things but some stuff was lost forever......      Do you think it important or not? Where would you draw the line?

The downturn seems to have affected Ireland worse than Britain as yet -and as Ireland's peace, stability and economic fortunes are only a decade old - could it be that in times of trouble - those evil voices of violence find a way to get heard?  Especially as those who carry out the actualities of violence tend to be young and therefore are likely to have been children during the Troubles and not seen and witnessed it to the same extent as people 30 and over.      Fingers crossed enough people make a stand against it and it doesn't all spiral again.

An Ethiopian,got paramilitary training in the Al-Qaeda training camp Al Farouq.Arrested at the Karachi airport - while attempting to fly to the UK - by Pakistani authorities as a suspected terrorist.On November 7, 2005, Mohamed was charged with conspiracy. Allegations that Mohamed was trained in Kabul to build dirty bombs.   Evidence collated suggests   a. The detainee is associated with al Qaida or the Taliban.         1. The detainee lived in the United States from 1992 to 1994, and in London, United Kingdom, until he departed for Pakistan in 2001.      2. The detainee arrived in Islamabad, Pakistan, in June 2001, and travelled to the al Faruq training camp in Afghanistan, to receive paramilitary training.      3. At the al Faruq camp, the detainee received 40 days of training in light arms handling, explosives, and principles of topography.      4. The detainee was taught to falsify documents, and received instruction from a senior al Qaida operative on how to encode telephone numbers before passing them to another individual.      5. The detainee proposed, to senior al-Qaida leaders, the idea of attacking subway trains in the United States.      6. The detainee was extracted from Afghanistan to Karachi, Pakistan, where he received explosives and remote-controlled-detonator training from an al Qaida operative.      7. The detainee met with an al Qaida operative and was directed to travel to the United States to assist in terrorist operations.      8. The detainee attempted to leave Pakistan for the United States but was detained and interrogated by Pakistani authorities, revealing his membership in al Qaida, the identities of Mujahidins he knew, and his plan to use a "dirty bomb" to carry out a terrorist attack in the United States.

BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- While violence decreases across Iraq, women in the war-ravaged country face worsening hardships as warfare has thrust them into the role of family breadwinners, an aid group's survey said.   Many women have been widowed and have had to run their families because their husbands "had been killed, disappeared, abducted or suffered from mental or physical abuse," the survey says.As a result, many have been unable to earn a decent living. While there are no precise numbers, there are now an estimated 740,000 widows in Iraq, Oxfam says.   "Women are the forgotten victims of Iraq," said Oxfam International Executive Director Jeremy Hobbs, in quotes included in the survey. "A whole generation of Iraqis are at risk. Mothers are being forced to make tough choices, such as whether to pay for their children to go to school and receive health care, or to pay for private power and water services. These are choices no mother should have to make. And they are not only threatening individual families, they are also threatening the future of Iraq itself," Hobbs said.       http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/03/0...    An Iraqi woman who sells incense and candles to support her children says, "to work is to preserve your honor."
