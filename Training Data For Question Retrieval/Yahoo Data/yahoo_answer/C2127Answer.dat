A percentage is displayed showing answers voted best divided by total answers. The higher the percentage the more trustworthy the answer. As you accumulate points you move to higher levels. The level allows you to do more on the site such as being allowed to answer more questions per day. There are no prizes for points. Yahoo may decide from time to time to give gifts based on level but there is no guarantee. Gifts were given the the first anniversary and there have been free light bulbs and shopping bags.

Starting at level 2, you can thumb up/down questions. It's also your standing in "Yahoo Answers society". There are many ways on how to get and lose points. First of all, by logging in, you get 1 point (only works once a day). This may not sound like much, but these points will build up in time. Also, by voting for a best answer on a question that is open for voting, you can get a point for each vote. Also, write good answers, as each "thumbs-up" on a best answer also brings one point. This works until you get 50 "thumbs-up" ratings on your answer. Any more will not be counted. This leads to answering questions. Each answer you give earns you two points. If your answer gets picked as the best answer, you get 10 points! Now for the deductions. Asking a question deducts five points. Deleting an answer takes back the two points you earned by deducting two points. If you choose a best answer for your question, you get three points back. Also avoid getting reported, or you'll lose 10 points per violation.<br>  <br>  There are set point values to go up and down levels. The levels and their point values are as follows:<br>  <br>  Level 2 - 250 points<br>  Level 3 - 1,000 points<br>  Level 4 - 2,500 points<br>  Level 5 - 5,000 points<br>  Level 6 - 10,000 points<br>  Level 7 - 25,000 points<br>  <br>  These are the privileges you get for leveling up with points.<br>  <br>  Level 1 - 20 votes, 05 questions, 20 answers, no ratings<br>  Level 2 - 40 votes, 10 questions, 40 answers, ratings allowed<br>  Level 3 - 60 votes, 15 questions, 60 answers, ratings allowed<br>  Level 4 - 80 votes, 20 questions, 80 answers, ratings allowed<br>  Level 5 - 80 votes, ∞ questions, ∞ answers, ratings allowed<br>  Level 6 - 100 votes, ∞ questions, ∞ answers, ratings allowed<br>  Level 7 - 100 votes, ∞ questions, ∞ answers, ratings allowed<br>  <br>  So be careful for those deductions, and work towards those points!<br>  <br>  Good Luck,<br>  Blaziken|`|zruhNGKbaa	Points are intended to give the community an indication of the degree to which you participate in the forum.

Then after 2 minutes, add your links in the additional details area.<br>  <br>  If it's not because of links, then your question is blocked because of it's wording that seems suspicious.<br>  <br>  Yahoo! is trying to fight spam posts this way.<br>  <br>  (\_(\<br>  (=' :') --<I ?

I used to have about 87, but I removed a lot of them because their accounts have been suspended.
6qsTmMQaaa	Unfortunately, I don't really think there is any way to get people to choose the best answer to their questions. That is somewhat like asking how we can stop people from answering with a short answer, and then saying "Answer mine please" and posting a link afterwards (it's a dumb analogy, I know, but hey...it's the best I can do).<br>  <br>  Here are my theories as to why people DO NOT pick the best answer:<br>  1) They completely forget to pick the best answer<br>  2) They don't know how to pick the best answer<br>  3) They don't know *what* the best answer is, so they leave it voting.<br>  4) They don't log on in the four or eight days that their questions remains open.<br>  <br>  About a month and a half ago, I answered a question in which the asker wanted to know how Yahoo! could get people to realize that they DON'T need to be a Level 2 to vote for best answer. My suggestion was that they could put a summary of Yahoo! Answers in the welcome e-mail EVERYONE who has ever signed up for Yahoo! Answers has received. I suppose that a guide to choosing a best answer could be there. However, I don't think it would work too well, as there is a mandatory tutorial when you sign up for Yahoo! Mail, yet people still ask questions about Yahoo! Mail. So, although it would be GREAT to have an e-mail that told users how to pick the best answer, I don't think it would be effective.<br>  <br>  This is just my opinion though.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	I agree!<br>  I mean, I put a lot of effort into everything I answer. Usually. <br>  But I think that sometimes people get really overwhelmed with choosing a best answer, since there can sometimes be SO MANY good ones. Other times, however, a ton of dumb people answer so you don't feel like choosing one. <br>  <br>  But I always choose one! <br>  <br>  Yahoo emails you to "remind" you to choose a best answer...but really there's not too much you can do, except vote for you own best answer.|`|tbeO3Lataa	I agree too. The only time I ever vote for my answer as the best answer is when I know I deserved it (I spent a lot of time on it, etc.), and I never let my questions go to voting. It bugs me when people do because, a) like you said, people can vote for their answers when they didn't deserve it and b) it is nice to know the asker found your answer helpful!<br>  <br>  I think people should get more points for choosing a best answer. Maybe they should get all the points of asking the question back. I also think when your question went into voting, the asker should get no points for it being resolved. These would help.<br>  <br>  Kudos on becoming a TC by the way!|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	Well... I think that they should take away three points for letting your question go to voting. I mean, when you forget about your question and it accidentally goes to voting... you still get three points for 'picking' best answer. So! I think that would be a good idea. :D|`|H0sPCJQPaa	It's their opinion on what helped them or not.<br>  Don't worry about it your already a TC.<br>  And your like brand NEW!<br>  <br>  <br>  Congrats tho<br>  <br>  :)?|`|DNygQdmVaa	I agree. but I dont think there is anything we can do about it.|`|ElaYOsT8aa	The best answer chosen by the asker and by voters should be different. Sometimes what sounds like a good answer really isn't, as discovered only by the person who tries it out. Perhaps it can be arranged so that there can be up to two best answers, one chosen by voters and by the asker. But one answer can be chosen as the best answer in both categories. And the value in winning the categories is different and adjusted accordingly.|`|vNwgUggyaa	I agree with what you said, I also hate when the best answer ends up being someone saying "The guy above me is right. do what he said' I dunno what we could do though. sorry. hopeully ill get best answer for that...

Less activity in the category is the only way to lose the badge.  <br>  Many TC's have posted on the suggestion board, requesting the option to hide the TC badge, or not to have the badge at all, but so far the requests have fallen on deaf ears.

They then pick, as the best answer, the one that most closely agrees with that predetermined opinion. <br>  It doesn't matter an iota whether there are better or even more correct answers, their choice was made before they asked the question, they're just looking for confirmation.

After 4 hours, go back and look at your question again and you will see blue boxes under each answer that you can click to vote for best answer. Click on the answer that helped you the most and give 1 to 5 stars, according to how helpful you found the answer to be and add a thumbs up if you want to award an extra point.

After 4 days the question will go to the community to vote for best answer.<br>  <br>  After a question, yours or anyone else's, has gone to community vote anyone who opens the question will be able to see the blue ‘Vote for Best Answer’ box beneath each answer.  You can cast your vote along with everyone else’s but you can’t add thumbs up, stars, or comments.  If one answer gets the most votes then that person will be awarded the 10 points.  Unfortunately, this voting process often ends in a tie and no one is awarded the points, which is why it is best to always vote for the Best Answer to your own questions before the 4 days have passed.<br>  <br>  If you have any other questions about YA you can find the answers here:<br>  <a href="http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers/">http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...</a><br>  If you don’t see your specific question, just type it into the search box and it will take you to an answer.|`|xmiBdGr8aa	First you need to click your question on your home page click on the answer you want to be the best answer.|`|eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	To select best answer for your own questions.<br>  =================================<br>  You need to wait for 4 hours after you submit the question and then go back to the question, you will have a blue tab under each answer, "select as best answer", click the tab on the answer you consider to be the best.

Pick a question, click on the question to open it. Select the answer you think is best. Click on "Vote as Best Answer". You have gained 1 point|`|6qsTmMQaaa	To pick a best answer yourself, you have to wait four hours before the bubbles appear. The bubbles read, "Choose as Best Answer," and they appear under each answer. You click the bubble beneath the answer you like best, and then it will take you to a page, where you need to rate the response, and then leave a message to the asker. Then, you scroll down a little and click SUBMIT. The answerer will receive ten points, and you will receive three.<br>  <br>  To put your question to vote, you can either wait for the time to expire and then vote for the best answer, or you can go to the pencil beneath your question. If you click on the pencil, three or four tabs (depending on whether you extended the expiration date or not) will pop down, and one of them will read "PUT THIS QUESTION TO VOTE." Then the question will be put to vote, and you and the Yahoo! Answers community will vote for the best answer. You will still receive three points when the question is resolved.

To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on “Edit My Info”. If you haven’t created your avatar, at the top of the page, under “Nickname” is a line that says “Use my 360 nickname”.

hfGE5jieaa	Also, don't you hate it when a question such as "Coke or Pepsi?" gets 200+ answers? I mean, seriously people. Nobody cares about your personal soft drink preference, nor are they going to scroll through all of them. I even doubt the asker does themselves.<br>  <br>  I also believe that by answering "idk", they are really doing it for the two points. I'd rather answer a more meaningful question (e.g. yours) than voice my personal preference, or answer that "I don't know."<br>  <br>  Who really cares?<br>  <br>  But, you know what the funny thing is?<br>  <br>  I was just about to ask this question myself, regardless of the inadequate answers that I would most likely receive.<br>  <br>  By the way, I'm starring this question.<br>  (:|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Why not.  They get the two points and no one bothers to report them for the violation of cheating.|`|2nPwq257aa	I believe it has to do with the levels and rating system.<br>  It seems like it takes forever to at least get to the point where you can vote thumbs up or thumbs down on an answer.<br>  This system discourages a point/level system based on actually giving a  <br>  concrete answer because it has the game element of levels.<br>  I also don't understand why one would lose points simply by asking a question.<br>  As silly as it is, I'm eager to get to the level where I can at best give a thumbs down to ridiculous answers.<br>  It's just a computer and most people are coward morons that would NEVER be that rude to your face anyway...eh.<br>  I just view it as a time killer and it doesn't bother me as much.<br>  I do, however, wish the system could be overhauled so it can become a more productive place.|`|nAcNtV3vaa	people are just messed up, that is all.
lDe628oPaa	Sorry if it's too vague for me, but are you saying that you use Photofiltre as a photo editing program?  I have not heard of it.<br>  <br>  Best way to get these dots would be to start out with the image (a square or whatever) in a solid background color.  Try to see if your photo editing program will let you overlay a grid on top of it temporarily.  If you did this as a filter or layer, you could actually put the grid on it and then delete the layer later.  Then add another layer and using the paintbrush tool and a different color to make a small dot at every intersection on the grid.  Delete aforementioned grid, or deselect viewing the grid if you did not apply it as a layer.  Now you have a solid background with different dots on top.

You might just wanna skimmer threw the rules and see why it was a violation here is the link :<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_...">http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_...</a><br>  If you don't see it in here then it might be a troll the reported it, or it could have been done in mistake. If you think it was wrong reply to yahoo(you should have gotten in a email about the violation) saying why you think it was a mistake or not against the rule. Putting the question in your details would be extremly helpful.<br>  But it might not have been a violation, you might have mistakeinly deleted it,  it got no answers after four days, it got thrown into vote and the most people voted for 'no best answer' or best answer got reported.<br>  Hope I helped!|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	We can't see deleted questions, so we don't know which one it is. And without knowing that, we can't guess why it happened. There are many reasons. For example:<br>  > no answer after 4 days<br>  > answered, voters chose 'No Best Answer'<br>  > Best Answer reported as violation<br>  > Question reported as violation<br>  <br>  The #1 reason for violations is chatting.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	There are several reason questions are removed:<br>  <br>  1. It is a violation of the rules - you will get an e-mail when that happens. If you get one, post it here in a question and the users can tell you the problem. There is no statute of limitations on breaking the YA rules.<br>  <br>  2. There were zero answers when the time expired - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  3. The BA was reported as a violation - no e-mail sent.<br>  <br>  4.
