The Camaro SS with the 400HP V8 like the one in the movie will cost around $34,000.    The cost to get the black stripes painted would be another $1000.    So it should cost around $35,000 with the cost of the car. Just get the car on yellow.|`|0af9add9f485957fd5ddd542dd0b65e0aa	Probably similar to Ford Mustang and Dodge Challenger prices considering they are similar. Use engine size as a reference.

IIBI9Evjaa	This GM vehicle has a resistor inside the window motor, with time the resistor goes bad and it doesn't let the electricity flow to the motor. you can take the door cover out and replace the motor assembly or just open the motor you have and remove the resistor, it will work like a charm. This is a common problem for all GM products.|`|cc2b0d76cac98fbf61e197db52fde3caaa	The motor is getting overheated and stopping, about the only thing you can try is taking the door panels off and getting some lithium grease and a brush and greasing the window channels inside the door to see if it will make the window roll easier, if this doesn't work your looking at a new window motor.|`|a400efb33672011549b47bbb0d18ccc7aa	Ohh I love the body style of Firebirds  =]~  Power window motor...

Yes, there is a motor in power windows that can run out of "charge". My uncle did a repair over the summer on his jetta when his motor got fried. You can purchase a new motor at an auto zone or something of the sort and do it yourself. I would look at a how-to article for more information.|`|AwmUZtQBaa	either its gettin' jammed or the motor is going out.

I was stationed in Germany with the Air Force and I had a 1984 Trans Am.  It had a recall on it for seat belts and I told GM that I was in Germany and there was no local dealer.  They sent me a letter back to take it to OPAl I did and they took care of the car. 
80b8b140492c3473ea609c52fc59199aaa	With out more information it's hard to be exact, such as yr and make of car etc...however try to observe your driving habits.  If you are using 2 feet to drive with..as in one on brake and one on gas..well then there you have it.  Many are guilty of "riding the brake"...even I have done it.  you say you live on a mountain, it's very possible you are riding the brake and don't know it.    other things could be a sticking caliper...which if both sides is wearing then I don't think it's that.    Bout all I can say bout it.|`|y1Om8Oe9aa	Caliper pistons or guides (floating type) will create the same problem not releasing pressure properly.  A rubber hose to caliper can collapse internally and cause excessive pressure as well, although not as common, I've seen this a few times.    Also, Bad master cylinder or M/C to brake pedal plunger rod   out of adjustment could cause this as well, or antilock brake component or  Proportioning valve.    Here is the simple test.  Jack the wheels off the ground and pump up the brakes by repeatedly applying the brake pedal.    Now spin the wheels.  if they stick, pump up the brake pressure again and crack the bleeder valve loose on the caliper.  If the pressure releases immediately, the problem is not the caliper.  It is the rubber hose or other above mentioned component.  If it stays tight and doesn't spin freely, it is definitely the caliper.    On antilock systems, if you collapse the caliper pistons and allow the fluid to backflush into the system, it could plug screens filtering dirt in antilock system.  You should always clamp the hose (most models) and expell the fluid out the bleeder valve when compressing the piston(s), rather than backflushing.  Then, add fluid at reservoir and bleed the system at caliper/cylinder bleeder valve(s).|`|AA10525736	It could be a couple of things.  A sticking brake caliper will make your brakes wear out much faster.  If that is the case then you would smell your brakes often and your front wheels would be really hot.  Also a collapsing brake line will do the same thing.  Some vehicles are harder on brakes than others.  Research your car on some forums and see if it is prone to bad brakes|`|j6IxZhNlaa	hi are the brakes your garage putting on good quality because they sound like a budget type if there dead in 7000miles,and of coarse a good quality brake disc will help too.no not the brake lines|`|4nD0NJReaa	Try another brand of brake components|`|84AVcZ9laa	I drive motor route for a news paper I stop or slow down at least 200 times a knight I am replacing pads about every 3 months how far up in the mountains do you live? you can get ceramic pads they coast more but should come with a warranty.your MEC should know if your calipers are sticking and from what you are saying he doesn't think they are .Same car for three years? just the front .If you trust your mec then he should work with you to find the problem if not take it to another shop get a second opinion|`|gAaw4S0Laa	brakes should last longer than this ! unless the pads are faulty or damaged or fitted incorrectly ? it also depends whether they are disc or drum brake pads ? if they are disc brake pads you could need to replace the disc's as they may have been pitted or scratched but they probably will be now as you said the pads had worn away to bear metal, this could also be true for drum !,it could be the calliper pistons if on front? damaged, or sticking on as with any mechanic it is a process of elimination and without looking at it myself it is very difficult diagnose the exact problem what make & Model of car is it ?|`|kgk3Yz9Naa	nowt wrong with women drivers....lol...  its possible you callipers may be sticking causing the brakes to wear quicker...the bust on the wheels,that's whats left of the brake pads...you can get a harder compound brake pad that will last longer,but costs a little more.|`|AT0e3xwAaa	Living in the mountains will have a detrimental effect on brakes but it should not be anywhere near that bad. You may have weight issues (too much junk in the trunk) or pull too heavy of a trailer(if that applies) or that last result would be some serious problem with your braking system. You may want to have it checked out. After the mechanic is done, take it to get a second opinion. It never hurts for information purposes. Please make sure you do not leave out any information to the mechanic as this will help him/her assess your problem better.    Not commenting on women drivers here but if you could use lower gears and slower speeds on the downhill drive, That will increase brake life a good bit.|`|QyDevKnUaa	ask your mechanic to look at your calipers or drums(which ever ones are messing up) and see if the master cylinder is worn. if the brakes where installed wrong the first time and you had constant braking(rubbing) it will cause early wear and if the cylinders are getting stuck in the brake possition that would cause it too.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	wel yes they should last longer than that.. and who put them on  an dwhat work was done before .. so if you just had pads put on but they didnt turn or replace rotors then that was problem if they used chaep pads another problem and if you drive with foot on brake pedal any at all then thats another in the mountains another... but either way brakes should last more than a year and if your driving til you hear them grind your not keeping a eye on the brakes or the car should have got like 10,000 or better and it could have been the shop that done the work and you know to replace brake pads alone anyone can do at home its pretty easy once know how to you can do most any car and rotors wel they need to be turn every time but its not a have to thing but its better it will help save the brakes some what but either way alot wil depend on your driving habits not saying anything about your a women or not  these links wil tel you how you can do it at home my wife does her own really not any harder than fixing a flat and take about as long type of pads wil also cheaper the pad the shorter the life but still 7000 it should have been a bit longer

But yes, you're on the right track, it's about driveshaft length.|`|SdYOAb62aa	It has to do simply with being front wheel drive... Other things can decrease it, but no matter what a fwd car is always going to have a bit of torque steer.  It is caused by the front tires trying to both accelerate AND turn at the same time.  That means each thing only has so much friction to use for traction.  When you get torque steer is when accelerating uses more of the "friction circle" and turning has to lose some, so you slide out as your tires break traction.<br>  <br>  Basically the cause is trying to drive too fast. Haha.

Most likely.  If you agreed to pay $100,000 for a 1978 Chevy Chevette, you got a bad deal.  The insurance company is only "on the hook" for the actual cash value.      They don't owe loan payoff, they don't owe replacement cost, they don't owe any taxes, negative equity, late fees, interest payments, none of that.     So, if you owe less on the vehicle than it's worth, you'll have some money in your pocket.  If you owe MORE on the vehicle than it's worth, you'll have to write a few checks to get out of the loan.      As far as action, your best bet is to get a clear idea of your car worth - like at www.kbb.com, private party sale value.

575cb6b1cf5b6852adb2d2d72dec74dcaa	Well the way I figure it, to the environmentalist, the population and population growth, nor aging population are not part of the environment.  And to economists and our government, oil and home heating fuels are not part of the cost of living.  Even the most fuel efficient hybrid is still going to be manufactured using petroleum products.  Those electric cars still use petroleum by-products, even aftermarket.    John Stossel from 20/20 gave his close but no cigar report last night.  He did however point out last night who the biggest profiteer is where oil is concerned and it is our own government.  Do you think for one second that the government is going to really cut off its own nose to spite its face, with GWB's call for a 20 percent reduction in oil usage?  It was afterall this government that said it was okay to push the limits of safety and fuel efficient cars to the speed limit of 70 mph.  It cost more, even for a fuel efficient car, to accelerate to the speed of 70mph than it does to 55mph.    Kind of makes you think that the countries leaders while Nixon was in office were genius compared to the ones we have now.  They were the folks that got the speed limit lowered 55pmh.  And the idea behind that was to save on fuel consumption across the whole country.      You want to regulate something worthwhile.

AA10171141	Just go to Youtube and search on "Derailed Snow Plow" and you will see some videos of trains pushing snow removal equipment that have been derailed, so yes it can happen.  After the snow builds up into drifts, it can be surprisingly heavy and dense.    I've seen articles in Trains magazine about trains that have derailed in very snowy conditions, but usually it doesn't happen - the train is way too heavy to be affected by your average snow drift, but if the snow is heavy and icy enough, it's been known to happen.    Another thing that can easily derail trains in bad weather is when the rails go over a road crossing and cars shove snow into the grooves where the train wheel's flanges go.  After a while, this snow gets packed into ice, and an empty rail car can ride up over the ice and go off the rails (and maybe even turn over).  The train crew can stop this from happening by first having the locomotive go over the crossing by itself.  It's heavy enough to break up the ice without derailing (you hope), and after the ice is broken, the cars can be moved across it.    The same situation can happen if the rails become submerged below water for some reason, and the water freezes.  Again, running the engine over it first will fix this, but if it's at all possible, it's best to have the rails cleared up by a track maintenance crew before proceeding.|`|WsKUEgQraa	Not just fallen snow.I have run through 6 to 8 foot drifts with no problem.Now if it sat there a few days and had to to freeze and compact i wouldn't want to try it.|`|yGf4eB6laa	No. But I've got my train stuck in snow a few times this winter.|`|Zwg6T2wvaa	no|`|XwXuJIF8aa	not falling snow. but when it gets compacted in a switch and ices over it could derail a train.|`|t1zlbOURaa	Probably if there's enough of it.

I guess my answer would be anything is possible but in over 35 years of railroading, I have never heard of it.

Your engine is an interference engine, so if the timing belt breaks it will not only leave you stranded and late for wherever you were going, but it will also ruin your valves.  Fixing those means pulling off the cylinder head, and very few shops can complete the job in one day.    Some cars go 100k, even 200k without changing the timing belt.

All you have heard and seen there may or may not do any good, mostly no good. Popping or banging it out from the inside might be best (if accessible) but even then it could look uglier than before due to unevenness and bang marks in the surface. That is why professional shops not only bang it out but then use filler to smooth the surface before repainting the entire part or section of the vehicle.
aCVk8KcHaa	yes sir they are.the a/c system is set up where when the head pressure in the system is too high,the fan will enguage,and if your light is flashing,it's probably low on freon... or could be the fan switch itself. the faulty fan switch will not let the fan come on at the proper temp.and will cause overheating..check coolant level. and hook up pressure guages on a/c and see if the system is not low.. and if it is. evacuate and charge,and install proper amount of freon. too much freon is worse as not enough.don't let anyone over charge teh system... too much freon will not make it cooler,it will shut the system off...safety switches will do that for you.|`|d222e4bdafa2c384627fb0a3b6346096aa	Could be head gasket trouble|`|2LMLIMKUaa	could be the thermostat.    for the ac once you get the engine overheating thing fixed put r134a into the ac thing in the engine and it should give you fresh air|`|4986938808d6bea59d799599fa211c5baa	well generally toyota owners don't admit a problem but I would start by looking at the thermostat and at what kind of condition the antifreeze is in.

oCwi3aU7aa	First check for spark this is done by removing the spark plugs and leaving them attached to their wires.  amke sure you remember where they go.  Lay them across something metal on the front of your car, not painted or it wont work.  You can do them one at a time if you dont have enough space for all of them.  Dont hold them or they will shock you.  now have some one turn over the car a few times and see if they spark.  If they do you are okay there.<br>  <br>  Next check for fuel with the plugs out and removed from the wires so they dont spark turn the engine a few more times you should be able to smell gas from the spake plug holes.  If you cant do this see if you can remove the fuel rail with the injectors still mounted in it and turn the engine a few times they will spray gas if they are working so lay them on a rag and keep all electrical components away from them, especially the spark plugs or you will have a fire on your hands.  If you have fuel and spark, you have only one option left for the cause of the problem.<br>  <br>  The timing order if you were messing with the spark plugs or the wires before this problem happened you probably put them back in the wrong holes and the plugs are firing at the wrong time.  You will need a repair manual for your car to find the correct firing order for your spark plugs.  If you can follow the diagram and put the wires back on the plugs in the correct order your problem will be solved.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|zOIgzIy4aa	maybe it,s not fuel but spark. did you check to see if your getting spark at the plugs. if no spark then it could be the coil or module.|`|spBnMPzFaa	check air filter, unlikely<br>  no spark,<br>  check battery voltage, alternator, starter, <br>  borrow a code reader from autozone|`|bvCkplELaa	Why would you change the filter and fuel pump without properly figuring out the problem initially.

If you still have the smell after you do that, you may have a electrical short under the dash causing wires to melt. This would also cause the cold air coming through the vents if you air mixture door motor has lost power. In that case, I would have it checked immediately by a professional! Hope this helps!

eiPLF3jwaa	Whichever you like better...    Personally?  I'd go for the Subaru WRX... it's a freaking rally car!!!  Turbo motor, AWD, and box-solid reliability....    The Civic Si...?  well, it's box solid, but it's just a slightly souped up Civic LX....      The WRX is faster, more powerful and far more stable in bad weather....  and it will probably outlast that Civic...    I drove a Subaru for YEARS - to about 320,000 miles - and didn't have much trouble with it at all....    There are lots of Subarus out there that last that long - and longer.... probably not nearly as many Civics....|`|izN5uiq1aa	i personaly think you should chose the wrx cuz they look so much better and they arnt hondas.But then again hondas will last long  Hope this helps|`|D7ULWxx5aa	The WRX is a boxer four cylander turbo... lots more torque and power.

6Yv3j9LUaa	For better sound quality you need o get subs that fit the enclosure box, if the space for each sub is to smaller you wont be getting the best of it.  Also match the input power of the subs with the output power of the amp. If the amps is bridgeable @ 2ohms then connect 2 subs in parallel and into one bridged channel to maximize the power.|`|6XwpCbIkaa	no it would probably sound horrible.  they would be way too under powered. take your 4 channel amp and bridge two of the outputs together(if you have 4 individual sub outputs) and turn two channels into 1 and then only hook up two of your 12 inch subs(might sound a lot more complicated than it really is). you'll send 500 watts to two each sub instead of only 250 watts to 4 subs. what you suggested wouldn't be enough power to rumble the hair on your head let alone make some good sound.|`|AA10394818	if it's a 4 channel amp it should have 4 slots for each speaker but depending on the max watts on the 12s your not going to get a lot. that's only 250 watts to each 12. so you'd be better off with a 2 less 12's or a bigger 4 channel amp. i have a 4000 watt amp for sale right now,
eEjVxo9Paa	I've seen a lot of sub/amp combinations and i think an Audiobahn sub like this one here is the BEST bang for the buck: http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/...  Now an amp is where you wanna make the real investment, cause about a year ago i bought a Audiobahn sub called the Alum12q for about $150, and it hits SUPER hard. 1000watts rms and it means it.  The thing is, I don't think the amp i bought (the Audiobahn 8002T) really puts out the 800 watts rms at 2 ohms that it says. Because when i put my sub (which is in a 1.75 cubic foot ported box). to my friends kicker 1000/1 amp, it sounds so much better and was MUCH louder, showing the subs real potential. So im recommending the sub shown in the link because its way better then the one i have now, and i actually plan on getting one. OR the Alpine type-X which is also a very good sub but costs about 3 times as much as the Audiobahn. And as for the amp the Kicker  shown here http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/...  , or the Rockford fosgate shown here  http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/...  it all boils down to reading reviews and listening to sub. amp combinations in person. With these amps you cannot go wrong. and the audiobahn is a unbelieveable sub for the price!|`|AA10394818	ebay is your friend but there is too cheap on ebay. i have a 4000 watt amp that is killer. its for sale.|`|c2682a0b67677c165d7c5c468a290a78aa	Many places such as bestbuy and various other audio stores offer amp/sub combinations such as rockford fosgate and sony.

Surprise, surprise!|`|a25000586cdd2e8a5d23cfaceef58707aa	honestly, this is really good for the country.  In the short term of things, people are going to struggle, but the more these companies work together to jack up prices (and yes, there is proof of this IE; chevron, texaco, mobil internal documents saying they are shutting down refineries to increase the demand.), the more american companies look at ways to get around the use of oil. These companies dont understand that they are destroying themselves in the long run for a fast buck today.  in the 3-4 years of rapidly increasing prices, we now have cars that get 60 mpg, we now have companies like tesla, that are working to mass produce affordable electric vehicles, we now have companies designing engines that can shut down cylinders when your car gets up to speed.... the high gas prices are doing great things to motivate people to get off oil. Things like ethanol arent the answer.. all ethanol production is going to do, is put more 'oil' fuel in the market.. the more fuel we have, the less demand is, prices drop (well thats how it should work), companies make less efficient vehicles because gas is cheap.  When we talk about electric vehicles, then the topic moves to increases in demand for electricity, but electricity isnt like oil. Any person can readily make their own electricity.   The more demand grows for solar panels, the cheaper they become to manufacture, the cheaper they are to buy and use.  So yes, gas prices are high right now, and they are making people struggle, but this is great for us in the long run....|`|575cb6b1cf5b6852adb2d2d72dec74dcaa	The government will not help, while they post record profits from oils higher prices than oil companies do.  That is right they do not make taxes collected on oil readily available to the public, without someone searching for the answers.

To calculate it one would drive a set distance and calculate how much fuel was used then divide the fuel used by the miles driven to get MPG. A simple way to do so for a regular person would be to put a specific amount of fuel in your car 10-20 gallons then monitor your mileage with an odometer or tripometer. When you get dangerously low you can see how far your fuel took you and divide.     The best thing about the above process is it will include a mixture of highway and city driving for a true MPG average based on your driving style and routes.    Hybrids recover more energy (via braking) in the city then on the highway skewing the numbers but on the highway they pollute less as they gas engine is essentially dormant at constant speed vs in a city where the engine is used in acceleration and deceleration (recovery).|`|AA11658197	Typically highway mileage is more important because it's the best that car can get but with hybrids not using any gas in town that weight may soon shift.

I don't know where you are but in Australia they have the RAC (Royal automobile club) and NRMA (National Road and Motoring Association).|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	No British car is reliable past, present, future.|`|798804a2107bbaa5ae18a49d8b25c933aa	I have several technician friends who work on Jags, they rave about the quality and reliability of the newer JAgs.

Good Luck - Boat Safe!|`|dKBE7Cf0aa	First thing to do would be remove the old one and check to see what size it is (120-140-160) Take the model and serial number from the engine and buy a new one from your local dealer.You will also need to buy a new gasket to install the new one.I don't know who told you that you don't need to replace thermostats on 2 stroke engines but nothing could be more wrong.Hope this helps and good luck.|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	first you could take yours out and take it with you to buy an exact copy.   now if the dealer that you deal with likes you he may sell you one of each of them and let you  return the one that you don't use and refund the price of the unused one
V2nLbZZ5aa	Hmm, what tune is it whistling?    Seriously, it sounds like you have a window gasket that is either damaged, loose or deformed.  Is it specific to a location inside the cab, like behind you or to your left? I am assuming you hear it inside the cab and not from the outside, since you would have to be running really fast to know it was whistling outside.    Look at all your windows and make sure the rubber gaskets are intact and look the same. This could be caused by a gap in the gasket that is worse when the weather is cold, since the rubber gets harder and creates the "lips" necessary to cause the whistle.    If the sound is coming from under the hood, you have a completely different problem, and the only thing that a whistle sound needs is a small aperture and moving air.  You will have to inspect the front end of the car for holes in the fender or fascia and try plugging them (Duct Tape strikes again).    Does the sound vary with your speed or does it sound exactly the same (monotone) when it appears?  This might clue you in that it is not a moving part that is causing the problem.

TsJoADGPaa	Have someone pull on the lever while you either lift up on the hood or push down on it. This should get it to open.    Just don't pull too hard on the lever or you might break the cable.    Once open, spray in some white lithium grease into all the moving parts of the latch and let it soak in for a few minutes.     After lubrication, try operating the latch without closing the hood to see if it works properly. If it does, close the hood and test again. It should work like new.    If it doesn't, you may need to replace or reposition the latch.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	those latches are adjustable. try adjusting the latch and if you have those little knobs on each side by the fenders try adjusting them up a little tighter.|`|ybh71Dh9aa	get a friend to hold the release handle inside the car while you pound on the hood|`|8468bdfd89a4b2535048ee892787ee1aaa	I would recommend going to a reputable auto body shop for an estimate and repair.

v8TWvtQgaa	Can't understand why chev m said it will never bolt up..  Pont firebirds up till 82 used a pont. engine and MANY people have put chevy engines in those firebirds.     No adapter kit needed     In fact all you need is a set of engine mounts from say a 76, 77, 78 pont firebird. Can buy new at a parts store for less than $30     Put those mounts on your truck's chassis (may have to drill a couple of 3/8" holes so mounts will bolt in place)     You'll need to move the wires and fuel lines around.  IIRC the pont had a driver's side mounted fuel pump, starter, etc. Where the chevy is pass. side mounted.     The pont 400 transmission is same in lenght as a chevy 400 trans  and the 78-87 trucks came with a th-400 option.     So you have holes drilled in chassis for the crossmember. Just slide the crossmember back and bolt up to those holes.     Now if it's a chevy th-400 trans you will need to get a B.O.P trans to chevy engine adapter plate $40-90 depending where you buy from.  speedwaymotors.com has the best prices that I have found    You'll need to get a driveshaft.. You can look in the junkyards for a chevy truck that came with th-400, and sag it's driveshaft. Will bolt right up to your combo..     If you can't find one then you may have to get a driveline shop to make you up one $100-200|`|6CyScIKBaa	a pontiac motor will never bolt up  and why do this the pontiac 400 was good for spinning timming chain same as the 389|`|d26cf5d0bc2ff44ed0bd39e786f279e6aa	You might try the Advance Adapters website, but since you are going from GM to GM I bet if you look hard enough in salvage yards you can make this a bolt-in project.  I put a 455 Olds in a 67' Chevy C10, had to remove the carrier bearing and have a driveshaft made but your truck should have a single shaft.  Also had to build my own transmission mount/crossmember but it was just a matter of using the Oldsmobile mount and relocating the Chevy crossmember back to accomodate the Turbo 400 transmission, then welding brackets to the mount so it would bolt in.  Engine mounts may be a problem, but as long as you keep the frame brackets from the Pontiac you can drill the front crossmember to bolt them in.  Hope it works out for you!|`|AA10401102	I have seen Chevy's with Pontiac engines before.If you keep the Pontiac transmission you got the battle half won.If the TH400 is Chevy,they used to make adapter plates for it.It's been years since I've been working on cars.Hope this points you to better sources,wish I could be more help.
77e6c94fab8905f50f23a8a7e5cf5f40aa	I would start by looking at Hemming motor news. It will give you a good base line for what the car would be worth. I would also check with the corvette club in your area. They know vettes and know your market and can give you some idea as to what it would be worth. with it not being stock as the hood has been modified as well as the final drive, exhaust and what not, this can effect the over all resell value of the car. Many purists would put a lower value on the car as it's been changed. However an enthusiast may snatch it up for a higher value. I know I have not been much help but I would defiantly talk with people in the corvette club in your area as well as check with Hemming on this.|`|jsQhnXTiaa	With all numbers matching engine and transmission and the fact that it is a 66 and has a 427 and if its in pretty good condition.

You could be looking between 40k-80k depending on condition and where you are selling it.|`|Zyi5DRwgaa	A lot depends on finding a buyer that wants what you have. Apparently, it doesn't have the original engine so you don't have a 'numbers matching' car which could easily be worth $50,000+.  Also, you've swapped hoods so for purists who want an all original car, you've lost a lot of value.  It's definitely worth more the the $5,000. he paid for it.  Do an online search for corvettes for sale in your part of the country.  That should give you an idea of what it's worth.|`|DAeZSElcaa	Well i have a 79 stingray with a built 350 motor putting out around   450 hp. I have checked everywhere and the value ranges from 10,000 for a not so nice one to upwards of 25,000 to 30,000. Mine is nice, so its prolly up in the 20 thousands. Stingrays are very desireable cars and not the easiest to come by. Try looking at similar cars in your local craigslist listings. that should give you a good idea of the going price in your area.

gEw83TRTaa	First  -   it PORSCHE and LAMBORGHINI    second - you actually aspire to be a street racer?  get some sense, get to a track, and learn to drive properly, in a venue designed for it.  Don't be another idiot on the streets who thinks he is the next Vin Diesel.  Ya, I know - all you guys are amazing drivers.  Nick Hogan though so too.  Join the SCCA (www.scca.org) and LEARN some real skills and how to apply them.  My experience is that most "amazing" street racers get their asses handed to them on a real track, against a real driver.    Third - Its unlikely you will end up with either>  Research cars that are realistic in your budget.    Lastly, for the grain of substance to the question - the only real answer is "It Depends".  Are we talking about a Porsche Boxster or a GT4?  Are we talking about an older Lambo Countache, or a Reventon.      Thats like asking if a Ford is faster than a Chevy.|`|1SnI86BIaa	you dont street race with a lambo...|`|5kVyZyGGaa	If your asking whats better a porshe or a lambo i would have to say the porche, its faster cheaper and lighter and way better looking.|`|38IZfJqiaa	neither, if your talking street racing, and not track racing you don't want either of those cars. Those are track cars. Street racing cars are cars that do best on a straight road, 0-60.     For Example a Dodge SRT-4 beats most cars between the lights, on a straight away. But on a long distance race or on a track the porsche would beat the SRT-4 everyday.|`|GFFcTpntaa	If you dont know much about cars, how are you going to be a street racer?

If you got your car back. what is the order for. that does not sound right. Is their more to the story? And the part about the DMV being the lien holder does not sound right either. If you make payments on the car, the bank is the lien holder. If you don't make payments, their is no lien holder. Can you Explain more on the lien thing.
ZTMjXz1saa	No gear out = less drag = accelerate faster = climb faster.    Once an airliner lifts off the runway, there's no chance at setting it back down again, on that same runway, without making a lap in the traffic pattern.  The planes are too heavy and going too fast at that point.    For airliners, it's positive rate -> gear up.  Smaller light aircraft can get away with leaving the gear down a little longer, just in case they need to set it right back down again.|`|P1Sl55Coaa	Sure.  It doesn't make sense until you know what we are doing.  There is a speed called V1 which is the takeoff decision speed.  After that speed, you cannot stop on the available runway, so keeping the gear down would not help you.  Also, it's safer to take it in the air, even if something goes wrong.  There are very few things that would not allow you to climb to a safe altitude, and the aircraft is designed to do just that, even if an engine fails.  In fact, if you have ever been on a weight restricted flight, where they had to take off passengers or bags to make the takeoff weight, it may have been because we couldn't fit the takeoff distance needed into the runway available.  So, if you have an engine failure, or something else big happen before V1, you stop, and will have enough runway to stop.  So, once you take off, the gear comes up because you are not going to land again until you come around and get the whole runway.  Also, the gear causes drag, and the aircraft climbs better with it up.  That's why it retracts in the first place.  Hope that helps you.|`|647d90c817d50303cceb01679642cbd4aa	landing gear up right after take off will decrease drag allowing airplane to gain more lift. plus high speeds will rip landing gear off!|`|AGQI3NuXaa	Faster/ Safer Climb. I think the rule of thumb ( in general) is that after you run out of runway you could land back on in emergency, gear up|`|Znzx92mEaa	Drag slows the aircraft and needs more power and fuel to climb out. Bottom line is money. Plus on landing they can't put the gear down until the airspeed is in the white arc. To much drag upsets the aircraft.|`|0a074f0922445a5ad119c19217e3133baa	The airfoil needs to be cleaned up.  There are maximum speeds for flap positions and gear down.  An aircraft taking off with full throttle that has lifted off the runway will  rapidly exceed maximum speed for the gear to be down.  They are of no use once you are airborne with no runway in front of you, so get them up to reduce drag as soon as practical.|`|WrXY4Wm9aa	Single engine climb performance for an engine failure after V1 is predicated upon gear up at the first sign of a positive rate of climb.  If you leave the gear down after the engine failure, you might not clear the obstacle(s) in front of you.|`|AA12349768	so the stowaway in the wheel well won't fall out!|`|m0ne2nUMaa	This allows them to climb better after takeoff in case of an engine failure. Statistics show it is better to climb to a safe altitude and deal with the problem than to be in a big hurry to get back and make mistakes while doing so. Of course all this goes out the window if you have a double engine failure.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	They are retracted per the checklist to "clean up" the aircraft.

If they both quit, ala` USAir, you want have runway left anyway.|`|hktfe1UGaa	Quick answer, it helps them pick up speed, less drag.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	The take off is so long youcannot just drop down to land and the drag is substantial in fuel economy.

efa550f6673c521a6c47e67cc5153a8eaa	let's check your logic for a second.... the car has made it to 200,000 miles using 10w 30 oil, it works fine on it, why would you want to change now? the recommended oil in that engine is 10w 30, you could run different oil weights depending on temperature, if it is cold where you live you can, and would be better off too run 5w 30 instead. the w stands for winter, so when the oil is cold 10w 30 thins out to a 10 weight when cold, 5w30 thins out to a 5 weight when cold, once it warms up it becomes a 30 weight. the thicker the oil the less it will flow and if you go too thick it may not flow through the very small orifices in you engine and something could starve for oil, thinner is better. i would not recommend using a synthetic oil now, it has smaller molecules and is more prone to leakage, it may find it's way past the piston rings and burn easier as well as past any seals and leak easier. the engine has made it to 200,000 miles being maintained as it has, why change now? you must be doing something right.    the material in your converter being broken causes a restricted exhaust, this causes poor performance and if restricted enough could possibly cause warped heads or a blown head gasket as well as many other problems.|`|qsP6Umcpaa	just use highmilage oil its better and its like synthetic and also dunt change ur oil every 3 thousand miles go for at least 2500 miles and change it its better for the engine and better for your performance     have 6 Chevy work trucks that are above 200 thousand miles     and 20 of them that are just about in mid 30 to 80 i use synthetic for all of them     all work trucks are change with 5w30    also go with what the temperture around your town or state is if ur in alska use 20 50 but in the south use 10 30 and if ur in north use 5 30|`|RaobKLK5aa	I WOULD GO SYNTHETIC ,BUT NOT THICKER.YOU DON'T NEED TO GO THICKER...................I WOULD GET THAT CONVERTER REPLACED ,IT WILL CAUSE DAMAGE IF YOU LET IT GET CLOGGED INSIDE|`|vMxyoFUdaa	Just like everyone else has mentioned about turning to higher and thicker mileage oils, it is recommended. Another thing i recommend if your running with regular non-synthetic oil its not a bad thing if you stay there, only if your engine has always used non-synthetic oil and switching to a full synthetic oil will then start to build engine oil sludge. Then you'll find high mileage + engine sludge will retire the engine.  Another quick recommendation, just get a new torque converter for your truck, they're not very expensive. A few hundred bucks at most. Do some research.|`|ncwQ6IYlaa	The cracked converter wont "mess up your engine" un less it plugs your exhaust. if the engine is not using excess oil (say qt per 1000) i would not go to heavier oil.  sometimes heavy oil increases consumption. it is an "old wives tale" that engines like heavy oil - they don't. they like oil that is light and easy to circulate to all parts. heavy oils increase temps and can cause heat failures.   a synthetic will probably offer longer oil change interval - if that is what you want. your engine was designed in the "dino days" and probably wont care about synthetic.|`|bvCkplELaa	1. Autozone 10w30 oil as reccommended.  2. Yes it can, try finding a shop that will weld in a universal converter, it's much cheaper than using factory parts for that.
lM9NvSwnaa	Motorcycles do not have lights that need to be reset, like cars do.  Motorcycles have warning lights.  If the oil light is on, then check the level of oil-first.  If the level is okay, then time to start diagnosing WHY the warning light is on.  The light comes on when the system senses low oil pressure.  This could be due to low oil, a clogged screen and or clogged filter, and a bad or failing oil pump.  It could also be caused by a faulty sensor.  Get out a Clymer or Hayes manual for the bike and get out and ohm meter.  Test the sensor.  If it checks out, then time to see why the oil pressure is low.  Do an oiland filter change.  Did that improve it?  If not, then I would pull the outter case off the engine and look at the oil pump itself.  Many times these are under the left side lower outter case cover.  If the pumps looks good, no excessive play or ground down teeth on the gear, then the problem is with a clogged screen in the bottom of the engine.   9 times out of 10 this is caused by owners using cheap oil filters and then not changing the filter with every oil change.      The issue must be found and resolved.  The light usually does not come on for no reason.  Worst case scenerio, you ignore it and you blow your engine because it was starving for oil.|`|AA10582974	For future reference, always give year, make engine size and model   when asking questions. We need all of the info to give an informed answer.    Honda scooters have a tiny slot to insert a screw driver (or any thin blade device - pick, knife, etc.) that will roll the trip wheel back to zero.    It's use is to inform you the oil should be changed in accordance to the recommended mileage interval as printed in the owners manual.  It's a good habit to get into, to check the oil level once a week.  When my motorcycle was my only means of transportation, I checked the oil level daily.    http://www.powersportspro.com/  Go to - Honda - Motor scooter - CH125 A (84) - Instruments   19 is the reset. It will not be easily visible and can be located anywhere on that front panel.|`|yZEgR6Yoaa	Motorcycles dont have oil change lights?  Do you mean your low oil light is on?

FgRUdQOBaa	When you get a coherent easy to understand answer would you PLEASE have 10,000 copies printed and distributed to yardmasters and dispatchers all over the country.   We (engineers) have told them in a thousand ways and times, "we cant pull that" but they never believe us, causing chaos time and time again.   Perhpas you will have better luck.         (jk, it is a complicated subject as the previous answers already stated, almost unlimited variables involved)|`|902bf06cc6e416f1757072330cfc5b9daa	The SP, under good ol' Phil Anschutz and D&RGW tutelage, determined the answer to this very question, mathematically, in a three step operation:    1.  Determined maximum amount of tonnage a single engine (or a multiple unit consist) can possibly make wiggle.    2.  Add seven more cars.    3.  And away ya go.....    But, its about tonnage, not numbers of cars, and what the draw bar will withstand.  With conventional draft gear the max safe level of force is 240,000 psi.    Here is a handy little equation called the "Rolling Train Resistance Formula" to determine the force involved.  It is as follows:    The force is equal to twenty lbs for each trailing ton, times the percentage of the grade, + 5, or [(20 x T) x %g] + 5 = f.  To determine "starting" force levels, the formula is the same, except the multiplier is 30 instead of twenty.    Of course a single unit cannot generate these high forces and as has already been said, the variables are too many to pluck a meaningful number out of the air.|`|AA10164889	Railroad locomotives range in power from industrial switchers with 200 horsepower or less up to the most powerful steam locomotives, which had up to 6,000 horsepower and diesel locomotives up to 9,000 horsepower.    On level track, the smallest industrial switcher was limited to 2 cars, whereas the UP Big Boy could pull 130 refrigerator cars loaded with fruit.  A modern diesel locomotive could pull a similar train, and they are usually grouped into 2-3 units or more.  At that much horsepower, the factor that limits the number of cars is the strength of the couplers, rather than the power of the locomotive.    Further factors include the terrain and the ruling grade, the weather, and the load-bearing capacity of the track.  So there is no clear-cut answer.  Sorry.|`|WKcC0Qayaa	From:  http://books.google.com/books?id=ygKio-K...    starting rolling resistance is around 3 to 4 lbs per ton (gross weight of the freight car).    Let's say we have 100 ton box cars.    Let's say we have a GE Evo ES44AC built to CSX specs (they are heavier) which has a maximum starting tractive effort of 198,000 lbs  see pg 12 of:  http://www.getransportation.com/na/en/do...    Dividing 198,000 lbs /  4 lbs per ton = 49500 tons    Dividing 49500 / 100 = 495 box cars.    Of course, it could not keep them moving.    For that, we need to go to it continuous tractive effort spec of 166,000 lbs.  And as other mentioned, a gust of wind or the slightest incline would stop the train.    Using basic high school physics, you can calculate the effects of grades on the above.|`|3Y2jRkxcaa	It depends on the horsepower of the engine.

KMeqvCCOaa	Arbitrators do charge a fee... to the manufacturer.    Look up Magnuson-Moss warranty act on Google.  It's the consumer protection act that congress passed back in the mid 70's which gave consumers recourse to the manufacturers against defects in materials or workmanship.  It defines warranties and gives some guidelines about "lifetime" warranties and "limited lifetime" warranties and implied warranties.      Wikipedia has a decent summary of it, if you're not into reading legalese.    You can retain a lawyer service, usually at no cost to you, but be aware that if you sign any paperwork AT ALL, you are legally bound to sue or pay the legal fees.  That means that if the factory rep wants to offer you some help, you won't be able to accept it without having to pay the legal fees to the blood-sucking lawyers that leech money from automotive manufacturers, causing all of us to have to pay more for our cars.    Most states have Better Business Bureau arbitrators that can make decisions that are binding on the manufacturer but not on the consumer.  That means if they tell the manufacturer to buy your car back, they have to, but if they don't, you still have recourse to sue.  That does not mean you'll win your lawsuit, but you still have that right.    What ever you do, I'd recommend using the soft sell technique.  Tell the factory rep about how loyal a customer you are, how many of your friends and family have bought their vehicles, and how you're sure you'll have many more years of buying their cars.... if they take care of you.  Making threats like "i'm going to call my lawyer" will usually make the District Service Manager stop talking to you, as most company policies state that if you retain a lawyer, he's supposed to talk to your lawyer, not you.

The people who have a lot of money in their bikes-like the 2 you mention usually keep them as "trailer queens" but there will always be someone who will be out bar hopping on his/hers and try and take someone on.

a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	That's all nonsense.    In ancient times hard tires lasted longer but had less grip than softer tires.  For the last half-century or so technology has largely taken over and terms like harder or softer rubber don't have any real meaning.  Today the tires that have the highest traction ratings more often than not also tend to have the longest mileage warranties.    Also tires themselves have become so diversified; passenger all-season, touring, performance all-season, high peformance all-season, high performance summer, ultra high performance summer, max performance summer, all-terrain, SUV, etc, etc, etc, that any discussion of soft or hard is meaningless.|`|N6zo8Zo3aa	there is a tread wear rating on tire labels at the store if you compare them you might get some insight .I don't know which is which but i would guess a tire with a soft compound would not last as long and have a lesser tread wear rating|`|bb934e69e05c392a2b53f8c500208562aa	usually if your looking for softer tires for grip you would look for the wider tires with a higher speed velocity rating. many brands have these|`|XsZsk55Jaa	Every major manufacturer makes many different types of tires, hard soft, and everything in between.

5nSMfLd8aa	when cruising, yes it does save you fuel.     because when your manually trying to maintain a certain speed, your foot can't stay "perfectly" steady. there will always be some movement. this movement wastes gas because your constantly changing throttle position.     with cruise control, a computer keeps the throttle steady, so no fuel is wasted as if you had a foot that was constantly moving. even if you did have a steady foot, it would never beat the cruise control.    also when accelerating with cruise control, its a very smooth, controlled acceleration. so it will save you fuel there too.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	It's okay.

When your engine gets hot, the thermostat opens up and allows coolant to flow through the block cooling it off.    It only takes about 10-20 min. to get hot, if it's not getting any coolant.  Your car has a safety feature that won't let it start back up until it cools off.  This protects your engine from blowing a head gasket.    You can get a new thermostat at your local Auto Zone or O'reilly Auto Parts for about $15.00.  They will even explain to you how to change it, which is fairly easy.    You'll still need to buy a thermostat gasket and a couple of gallons of antifreeze.    I hope this helps.  Good luck!|`|cst2MA8uaa	Sounds like either the head gasket or your  fuel injectors.

AA10906914	You don't say what the ohms of the subs are. If you connect each sub to each channel on the amp, then it's 4 ohm per channel IF the subs are 4 ohm each.    If you wired the sub parallel like this - http://i81.photobucket.com/albums/j230/s...    Thgen you coulc be overloading the amp with 2 ohm if it's not 2 ohm stable and you have the amp bridged.    More info here http://spkrbox1.spaces.live.com|`|rcgVQVg6aa	you are describing "Parallel" wiring.  If each of your speakers are 4 ohms, then you are currently running at 2 ohms.      Make sure your amplifier can handle this.  The average 2 and 4 channel amplifiers run at 4 ohms safely (Your setup will fry these amps), while many "Bass" amps run at 2 ohms or even 1 ohm in some situations.    If you do have a 4 ohm amp, simply change the wiring to series (Posi to negative sub-to-sub, and one posi to amp on one sub, one neg to amp on opposite sub)  This will give you 8 ohms considering you have two 4 ohm single coil subs.  8 ohms will only draw half of the power from a 4 ohm amp, but will have the benefit of running "cool" in many situations.
i1ayj8enaa	I think these are the subs that you are talking about. http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...    Best buy has the description screwed up. They are a dual 4 ohm voice coil. You would need to find an amp that is around 600 watts RMS at either 1 or 4 ohms. This would work pretty well. http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/... It's only 400 watts @ 4 ohms. If you could find a dual 2 ohm version of this sub, it would work better.     A brief explanation of "Ohms" as it pertains to car audio.     A speaker nominal impedance (ohms) will help to determine the wiring of the speaker and how the amplifier reacts to the load. There are 2 basic wiring techniques. Series and parallel. In series wiring, you double the impedance. In parallel, you cut the impedance in half. When you are wiring multiple voice coils together, to form one circuit, you need to use a combination of the 2 to come up with a final ohm load that will make the amplifier react the way that you want it to. Let me give a quick example. Say you have 2 dual 4 ohm subs. you need to wire them to an amp that is not 1 ohm stable. First, you would wire the coils together in series, doubling the impedance, essentially giving you 2 8 ohm speakers. Then you would have to wire the speakers together in parallel to cut the resistance to 4 ohms.     If you ever wonder about the possible wiring option for a speaker system, you could always use an online calculator. This one is pretty good. http://www.the12volt.com/caraudio/woofer...|`|AA10906914	Think of water through a garden hose. If you kink the hose, you resist the flow of water.     Ohms is inversely proportional to the example above in terms of resistance to an amp.    The lower the ohms, the more of a load (kink) it is to an amp.     How you load an amp determines the amount of power out.    There is a trade off though, the lower the impedance (ohms) the more power is pushed as well as higher distortion and more heat is generated. The excessive heat will shorten the life of the amp.    For best overall performance, it's far better to get a higher powered amp and load it with 4 ohms than a lower powered amp and force it to push more power with a lower impedance (2 or less ohms) load.

What are Ohms?    Ohms is a measure of resistance. You don't think of it, but substances conduct or resist electricity on a scale. Rubber isn't very conducive, copper is. This is why some premium cable are made out of silver and such - these substances conduct electricity better than others.    When the electricity passes into the speaker, some of it is 'resisted.' The ohms rating of the speaker is how much is resisted, and an indication of how much energy it takes to drive it - the higher the ohms rating, the more difficult it is to drive.    An amplifier amplifies the electricial signal, causing the speaker to vibrate with greater force, otherwise the impulse would be barely audible. How much the amp drives is measured in watts. When an amp manufacturer gives it's wattage rating, it's always at a specific Ohm resistance. 100 watts @ 4 ohms, for example. When the resistance is 4 ohms, this amp will produce 100 watts. If that resistance changes, the amp will produce a different amount of watts.    This is the core concept to understand. We're used to things that have a strength independant of their surroundings. A flashlight produces light independant of how bright or dark it is. Since electricity usually travels in a loop, from a negative terminal to a positive one (which is why you have to hook up both halves of a battery) the elements in the loop affect the output. Alternating Current makes things even more complex, but I'm not going to address that here. These calculations are based on DC, but serve as good averages for AC as well.

The car probably is not a Charger R/T, because the companies that build these cars would not heavily modify a genuine R/T due to its rarity.

If you did have a car and you did have insurance on it and then rent one then do not get the Extra coverage. Your insurance does cover the cars you drive temporarily. As you already know, if you did get into a accident and it was your fault, open your wallet wide, to pay for Both cars. plus the ticket in court.|`|77NzfiVkaa	I'm pretty sure that isn't legal.

I am in the same boat.  I rent a car a few times a year and don't have insurance either.    The $10 a day stuff from Enterprise the other guy was talking about is only bare bones insurance and does not cover much.  Most rental co.s charge $30 bucks a day for full coverage.  That works out to 11K a year for insurance!!  That is outrageous.  They must be making huge profits on this.    I know when I use my credit card, that some insurance (collision, I think) is provided.  But it is not nearly enough coverage.    I would like to hear some property and casualty professionals chime in on this question.    Anybody know a company who offers reasonable car insurance rates to non-vehicle owners?    Alton.......You don't seem to understand.  Thisi s about people who do not own cars.  You can not get a quote comparison on a car that does not exist.|`|84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	When you sign the collision damage waiver, you sign that you are providing financial responsibility for the vehicle.  Why are you worried about a ticket?  Somebody steals the rental car, you get a bill for the full value of the vehicle, due immediately.  Somebody torches the vehicle, you get a bill for the full value of the vehicle, due immediately.  You have an at-fault accident, with damages that can be repaired, you get a bill for the damage, PLUS a bill for every single day the car is out of service.  Are you independently wealthy?  Can you reach into your pocket for that kind of money?  You risk the money, and likely a drop in your credit rating so low you couldn't get financing for a pack of gum for long enough to take it from the shelf to the cashier.  By the way, the rental company does not sell you insurance.   Rental agents are not licence insurance brokers.  They charge a fee that adds you temporarily to their policy.  I know you didn't want the logic, but, from the logical point of view, it is illogical, not to mention fiscally dangerous, to even consider the question.    If you don't want their coverage, try to find a non-owned vehicle coverage from a licence broker or agent.  Relying on credit card coverage is hit-and-miss.  Most credit car coverage excludes liability, most, if not all, credit card coverage also excludes loss of use coverage.  Credit card coverage is underwritten by insurance companies, and each and every provider of a Visa or Mastercard can change underwriting companies at any time, so the booklet you receive with your card can be out of date.    By the way, if you ever rent a car in Manitoba, it will have a base policy with $200,000 liability and $500 deductible all-perils insurance.  That is minimum coverage on every registered car in Manitoba.  Manitoba is a special case, but I carry a lot more insurance on my own vehicles, and buy a special policy for any car I rent anywhere in Canada or the US.|`|AA10254694	Check with your credit card company may provide insurance when you rent a car.  http://www.netquote.com/auto-insurance/u...

Collection agency charges and you will have to fight to get these removed.|`|LyauFqaaaa	there is 2 options with a rental car. i know when i rent a car from enterprise it's 10 dollars extra a day for insurance. other option is your personal insurance so you have to have coverage. if that was the case we all wouldnt need to have car insurance regardless of a rental or our own personal vehicle.|`|aBs579jdaa	For auto insurance the obvious way to get a good quote is do a rate comparison on car policies. Make sure that you pick similar policies with the same limits, car make, zip code, etc so that all things are a good comparison.    What I most often recommend is an internet comparison quote at http://www.InsureAutoNow.info since they have big name insurers and can give many prices on car insurance polices.

So what else can have the same effect on the distributor and coil? Corrosion in the distributor! That distributor is prone to corrosion because the screen on the base plate vent holes becomes plugged and causes the distributor to retain condensation.     Remove the ignition control module in the distributor and examine the male prongs on the back of it and examine the distributor pick up plug which the prongs plug in to. Bet you a ham sandwich that you will find a considerable amount of corrosion there. Clean that corrosion up and make sure there is a clean solid connection there.

This means bent valves.  Possible broken camshaft.  If any of the valves were open, (And SOME WERE!), the piston/s came up and hit them. They're bent, and ain't cheap! The valve guides are messed too!    Could have a cracked cylinder head. Magnafluxing and Red dye check will tell you. I suggest an entire Long Block.

84150d8c6cd9fc2e974272b0e0ddc3c3aa	SEF 27 is legal liability coverage for damage to non-owned vehicles.  This information is from an Alberta government website.    Why has your insurance broker not explained the coverages, which should all be listed by name in your policy, not just number?  As a retired Manitoba broker, I can tell you I never let a policy holder leave without having an explanation of the basics of his policy.  I can also tell you it went in one ear ona out the other for many people.  More than once the signature on the application was used to protect brokers from accusations that limits or charges for optional coverages were never explained.  This is the problem with on-line coverages.  9 times out of 10 the person on the phone is not licenced at all, which is why you are occasionally referred, right at the end, to a licenced broker, or, more often, the person is only a level 1 broker, working in a boiler room with several level one brokers, under the supervision of a level 2 or 3 broker.|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	CDI is a direct writing company, which means they sell insurance over the phone or via the web directly to the public. The chances of a CDI representative being a part of Yahoo Answers is pretty much zero. Since the majority of us who answer here are brokers, and would not have access to CDI wordings, the only way you're going to get an answer is to call CDI and ask them. While this should have been explained to you when you purchased the policy direct writers are not really service oriented. Their goal is to write as many policies as possible as quickly as possible, so unless you ask the person you talk to on the phone isn't really going to volunteer much information as they have to move on to the next call. An insurance broker is all about service. When you walk into their office (imagine that! a real office!) it's their opportunity to shine and the way they do this is to make sure you walk out with as much knowledge as possible. So on your next renewal remember: it's not always about price.

AA10565336	Your real clue is that it is harder to start when it is warm.  If the starter is not spinning slow when it's warm then the other thing would be the Carburetor.  A good rebuild will fix your problem almost guaranteed.    Be sure the rod that operates the butterfly valve has not worn the carburetor body hole out of round or over-sized.  That will create a vacuum leak and make the adjustments impossible to make accurately.  If that problem exists a line bore and shims is about the only answer.    BTW, an 86 is barely broke in, I have a 65 pickup that will pull most of the new ones backwards.      Good luck on your fix.|`|8pKyzuy3aa	damn. '86? That's older then me. I would get a new car.

Be prepared to get in the passenger side on the floor and lay down to get at good look at it. Take a flashlight too.

Rather look at buying the same car if available in USA since exactly the same models are now released in India expect being right hand drive.|`|TG3RcPmLaa	you are absolutely right, In Indian roads automatic transmission is better because of the heavy traffic on the congested roads. it help us to avoid continuous gear shifting.

If it's newer you'll have the headache of computers and sensors.|`|GrgNm1Ofaa	My first and strongest suggestion is to go to the bookstore and read/buy a few small block chevy books.  I'm taking a wild guess but do you mean an LS engine from a corvette in an older model sivlerado?  If you do this you could run into a huge money pit and lots of problems.    I suggest buying a carbureted crate engine unless money isn't an option.  You could also build your own engine with a lot more power than any corvette engine but this would also require a lot of reading and know how.  It shouldn't be a hard swap in terms of fitment because most trucks were fitted with a small block and a 700r4 or the electric 4L60E.  This of course depending on your year and model.  It wouldn't be hard until you bring in the electric side of it - fuel injection and electric tranny.  A carbureted engine and mechanical parts are your best bet for price/performance.

If you have the 420a Neon motor, I've seen plenty of leaking head gaskets with oil dripping down the back of the head and burning on the exhaust system, but no anti-freeze leaking into the cylinders and burning white smoke out of the exhaust.   If you own a GTS or GSX with a turbo, you may have a bad turbo and the oil is burning because of a bad turbo seal. Remove the air intake on the turbo and see if you have any play in the impeller shaft. Move the shaft up and down/left and right with your fingers to check for movement.   If your oil is going down, not your anti-freeze level, You are burning oil, not antifreeze.|`|d9d7dbffacb9c5256ef7afd69e6023b6aa	If a head gasket is leaking between a cylinder and an oil passage, then it would have a lot of pulsating blow-by gases coming out of the crankcase. It probably would blow the PCV valve out of the cam cover.     If a head gasket is leaking between an cylinder and the cooling jacket, it will blow coolant out of the radiator or overflow jug while running, and suck water into a cylinder after it cools down. This can bend a connecting rod. If a head gasket gets a leak between the cooling jacket and an oil passage, it will get water in the oil, and maybe oil in the water..    The "old standard" way of telling what is bad is to see what the smoke does when accelerating or decelerating.    If it smokes when accelerating hard, but not when decelerating the rings are worn.     If it doesn't smoke on acceleration, but does when decelerating from a high speed, the valve stems or valve stem seals are worn (or gone).    If it smokes whenever it feels like it, then you have more than one problem.|`|WPYjdsA4aa	run a compression check on each cyl    the one thats really low is the one leaking  http://www.autozone.com/shopping/repairG...    here is how to repair it if it is

RpmZKQIQaa	High performance engines have a much lower life expectancy than lower performance engines.    Something like a cbr600 would be high mileage at 40k miles. Something along the lines of a touring bike. Say, a Honda goldwing should make it to 70-80k before it could really be considered high.    Don't worry too too much about mileage for a first bike. You'll probably only have it for a year or so anyway. The main thing you need to look for right now is light weight and lowish power. The Kawasaki ninja 250 and 500 are great starters and are pretty reliable. For something like this, try to find them under 25k miles or so. You shouldn't have any trouble finding them under that.|`|XBUeYE41aa	BMW club has lots of bike over 100,000 miles- considered well broken in.

The bike will keep going up to about 80K, but by 30K, it's about half used up.    For dirt bikes, 15K is about half used up.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Depends on bike/previous owner and their use/misuse of the machine.  I do not consider any bike that only gets 5-7000 a year on it high miles.  What I mean is a 10 year old bike with 50-70000 is not high mileage.  Since most owners don't put more than that on their bikes, that is about average.  Sure you can have folks like me that put 10,000 or more miles a year every year on a bike.    It is more important to see the service records and make sure oil and filter where changed every 2-3000 miles.  Make sure the machine was not abused-most sport bikes are, most cruisers are not.  Make sure all maintenance was done on the machine at the proper intervals.    Take any used bike to a repair shop to let someone go over it.  They will look for things like worn bearings in steering, in swingarms, in wheels etc.  They will listen to the engine for sounds of damage internal.  They will examine the outside for signs of leaks.  They will evaluate based on year the amount of wear and tear observed.|`|6S6LUjQvaa	it really depends on what kind of bike it is some are high at 50,000 Ware others are not until 130,000  do some Research on what bike it is that you look at and ask a dealer of the life expectancy of that make and model
SOfbIOzUaa	I have bought at least half a dozen vehicles that had salvage titles and were rebuilt and issued rebuilt titles. Just 6 weeks ago I bought a '96 Accord LX Wagon with stick shift for $5000.  I liked the car that much that I was willing to pay that amount for it. I had it checked out by another mechanic and nothing could be found wrong with it. It only had 42,000 original miles [certifiable] and it runs great and I'm getting 30mpg with it.     If you aren't confident on what to do, then have another mechanic check it out for you. I would make sure it had a wheel alignment. When you test drive it listen for any unusual noises like a wobbling sound for instance that could indicate a bent axle or rim or other damaged parts that were not replaced or fixed. Make sure all the castle nuts have cotter pins through them. etc.    If it is a 2001 model then it does not take that much damage to cause the vehicle to be totaled. The big question is, "Is it worth the asking price to you to have it?" Only you can make that decision.|`|PE1k59pcaa	STAY AWAY FROM IT ! it will be a nightmare to register you have to go through all kinds of stuff with the state.also if it has a salvage title that means insurance company totaled it because of its damage.they dont put salvage tilles on that little bit of damage, he's not telling you the truth.this model year also had a lot of transmission problems  honda tech.9yrs. mech.27yrs seen it all dont get involved !!!
q4nrL1C6aa	You have water in your brake lines.  Drain the old brake fluid, replace with new.  You might even use some good brake fluid to flush out the system if you don't want to do a complete rebuild of the caliper.    Brake fluid should be replaced every two years at a minimum, or 25k miles, whichever comes first.  Your master cylinder cover will tell you which brake fluid to get (Dot 3, Dot 4, Dot 5, etc.).  Be very careful and make sure you don't get any brake fluid on painted surfaces, rubber or chrome.    When water accumulates in your brake lines, it expands quickly under heat.  The expanding liquid (and subsequent gases i.e. steam) create pressure equal to pulling the brake lever, causing the brakes to engage.    Edit - There is also a possibility that you need to rebuild your caliper because the seal around the pistons that returns it to it's normal position may be worn and unable to function properly.  It's cheap and easy to do, email me if you need more info.|`|E0j6mhqhaa	I doubt your master cylinder is too full because it would have to be plumb full with no air space.  That full and you would have brake fluid spilled all over the tank, fender, etc.    Sounds to me the front brake cylinder is locked up and not functioning at all.  Moisture has a tendency to accumulate in brake fluid and being heavier than the fluid, it settles to the lowest point, the brake cylinder.  There it corrodes the metal, locking the piston in place.    Sounds like you need to remove the brake cylinder from the wheel but before you disconnect the brake line, hold it over a pan and use the brake lever to pump the piston out of the cylinder.  Otherwise you'll have one heck of a time getting it out.  Clean the cylinder out with sandpaper.  The aluminum will clog up a brake cylinder hone. Chances are there will be one fairly small corroded spot at the bottom, so don't worry about sanding the entire cylinder.  You may also consider getting a new piston seal.  While like an "O" ring, they are actually square edged, not something you pick up at the hardware store.|`|AA11652304	The master cylinder is too full or the check valve is blocked|`|6S6LUjQvaa	check for any grease on the disc and or pads.grease will lock up any kind of brake fast.|`|BTB7x9jraa	if the master cylinder is overfull heat can cause a little pressure similar to applying brakes.However is rare.check the brake caliper piston o-ring.Old o rings will not allow the caliper piston to retract when the pressure is reduced.Clean and replace o-rings and add small film of o-ring lubricant to aid in piston movement.|`|EFQmk31Uaa	Mine did the same thing, it usually does happen when the master cylinder is too full.  You may need to make a cover for it, some bikes are just finicky like that.
