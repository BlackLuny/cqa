3tuwWidiaa	You're correct that animals consume a great deal of resources and that they cause significant environment concerns.<br>  <br>  However, if no one ate meat, then we'd stop farming animals.  In other words, there would be fewer animals on the planet than there are now.  The only animals that would exist would be those in the wild.  Given that, at least in "civilized" (forgive the term) countries, almost all of our food meat (beef, pork, chicken, etc.) comes from farms, the net effect on wild animals would be not significant.  I could also go into fishing, but we'll leave that for now.<br>  <br>  For those vegetarians out there that do so because they want more animals in the world: it's quite the opposite.  Vegetarianism actually decreases the total number of animals in the world.  It's just that we aren't creating them (by breeding on farms) in order to kill them.<br>  <br>  On the flip side, we'd need to grow more fruits, vegetables, grains, nuts, and other such products to compensate for the lost food.|`|eo0DKI0qaa	To control the animal population, the natural predators should be re-introduced|`|AA10287176	Huh? I think you need to take an economics course. You seem to be saying that vegetarianism is bad for the environment because it will lead to more animals being alive and consuming more resources. But this completely ignores the basic idea of supply and demand. As demand for a product (meat) falls, producers (farmers) will cut back on production. Meaning that the more people who become vegetarian, the fewer animals will be bred for meat, and less resources will be devoted to feeding animals.<br>  <br>  Of the three options you give, #1 is probably the best, environmentally speaking, although it would likely be accomplished not by killing more animals but simply by not breeding replacements for the ones which are killed. #2 is not sustainable. #3 sounds good in theory, but counting on people to be moderate has never really been successful. <br>  <br>  Thinking like an economist again, the best route is to provide people with financial incentives to reduce meat consumption. Something like taxing meat and using the money to subsidize more environmentally-friendly and healthier food would help to drive down demand for meat and increase consumption of healthier food. Of course politically the meat industry is too powerful for such a tax to be passed anytime soon.|`|Ges0ZeDjaa	i think being a vegetarian is so stupid....why wouldnt you want to eat meat, its sooo good|`|XK9RLaPeaa	Most of the animals we consume in the US come from factory farms. These animals are bred by the millions. Factory Farming is the number one cause of pollution, therefore contributes tremendously to global warming. Vegetarianism is not bad for the environment. If there were more vegetarians, then the need for factory farming would go down. Without factory farms, the need to produce millions of animals would be gone. So without those millions of animals, our resources would also be saved. Your looking at it like these animals would be here either way, if everyone was a vegetarian or not. But the reality is these millions of cows, chickens, pigs, etc wouldn't be here. It would go down to a natural number and the resources would benefit from it greatly. We breed millions of animals to support peoples desire to consume large, unhealthy, quanities of meat. <br>  <a href="http://www.sustainabletable.org/issues/environment/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sustainabletable.org/issues/e...</a>|`|AA11296044	1. we breed animals for the exclusive purpose of eating them.  All commercial livestock farming is exclusive breading and feeding for human consumtion.   Hunting may help keep animal populations down (in some instances) however commercial farming only seeks to increase animal populations.<br>  <br>  2. We can't continue to eat the same way we are.   <br>  <br>  3.  There is really no reason to control specials, nature takes care of it.  When over populations happens the animals food suppy declines and the weaker animals die.

But burgers are yummy too.<br>  Maybe I'll grill some tomorrow....<br>  <br>  I like to mix in a little dijon mustard. (don't go overboard).

I like to make them and I call them my Cool Blue Red Hot burgers.|`|y9WqNR0Kaa	Basic Ingredients:<br>  Any amount of Ground beef (I prefer 80/20)<br>  Breadcrumbs<br>  1 egg<br>  Then gather whatever else you want to put in it. <br>  I want this particular batch to be spicy and sweet so I will also be adding:<br>  Worcestershire Sauce<br>  Tabasco Sauce<br>  Crushed Red Pepper <br>  You can put almost anything into a burger, from peanut butter to fresh salsa to cheese. Experiment! What do you usually add TO your burger? Throw in some diced onions, peppers, even ketchup! <br>  <br>  STEP 1 - Wash your hands and your countertop and plop a brick of your favorite thawed ground meat down on it. (Ground beef is being used above) <br>  <br>  STEP 2 - Flatten and spread the ground hamburger meat so there is more surface area exposed. <br>  <br>  STEP 3 - Add the egg along with whatever other ingredients you will be using. In the above picture I have added the egg, Tabasco sauce, worcestershire sauce, and a generous amount of crushed red pepper. No bread crumbs yet. <br>  <br>  STEP 4 - Begin mixing all of the ingredients into the meat by folding the hamburger meat over itself and working it together with your hands. Fold and press. <br>  <br>  STEP 5 - Continue kneading the hamburger meat mixture until you are satisfied that the ingredients are evenly distributed. <br>  <br>  STEP 6 - Flatten the hamburger meat mixture against the counter once again. <br>  <br>  STEP 7 - Lightly cover the top of the hamburger meat mixture with breadcrumbs and then mix it into the meat in the same way that you just did the other ingredients. The amount of breadcrumbs will vary from batch to batch depending on the amount of liquid ingredients you add. The idea here is to get the meat to a consistency where it holds together really well but is not overly wet or dry. When you can work a piece into a tight ball and plop it down on the counter without it deforming too much or breaking then you've got the right mix. <br>  <br>  STEP 8 - Work the hamburger meat mixture into a symmetrical 'ball'. <br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 9 - Split the ball up into equal sized portions. These will be your patties so decide how big you want your burgers to be. You can do this by hand or with a large knife. I find the knife is easier to get a good separation with. <br>  <br>  STEP 10 - Take each hamburger meat portion and work it into a tight ball. Cup the meat between your hands and squeeze it as hard as you can to pack it together tightly. <br>  <br>  STEP 11 - Once you have a tight ball of meat in your hand, slowly work it between your palms into a flat, patty shape. If the edges start to split, use the crease in the center of the palm of your hand to 'pinch' and work them back together. I always make more than I am planning on immediately cooking, so the extra hamburgers can fit between sheets of wax paper and then into a freezer bag to be frozen for later.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  STEP 12 - Cook up some of these burgers using your favorite method, and serve on a toasted bun with the condiments of your choice. Mmmmmmm. I generally either use my trusty George Foreman or the outside BBQ. <br>  <br>  <br>  Wow, was that some easy stuff, huh? Go ahead an experiment! Questions? Comments?

Add bacon and cook until the bacon is crispy, about 5 minutes, flipping once. Drain on paper towels. Pour off almost all of the bacon fat from the pan, leaving a very thin layer. <br>  <br>  To make the patties, combine the beef, country ham, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Handling the meat as little as possible to avoid compacting it, mix well. Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and form into patties to fit the buns. <br>  <br>  Using the same grill pan as before, cook the hamburgers over medium-high heat for 3 minutes per side or until cooked medium rare. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, place buns on a rack in the oven. Bake for 3 to 5 minutes. Also, place the plates that the burgers will be served on in the oven to heat. <br>  <br>  To assemble the burgers, spread a generous amount of Pimento Cheese on the cut sides of the buns. On each bun bottom (on top of the Pimento Cheese), place a thin layer of Honey Slaw. Top the slaw with a burger patty, 2 slices of bacon, and crushed potato chips. Add the bun tops. Place the completed hamburgers on a nonstick baking sheet and bake in the oven for 1 minute. Serve burgers on warm plates.|`|lheU07Rcaa	Any dish that is made with ground beef can be made into a hamburger.

They put this through a sort of rendering machine that scrapes and blasts and boils the remaining meat off of the carcass, and combines it with boiled down skin and muscle and all of the bits that are too manky to make into sausages or pies, and then they kinda squish it all together to make "reconstituted meat".

Veg head food is NOT cheap as you need a huge variety of specialty products.  <br>  <br>  Also, you need to do more research than just asking questions here.  Picky eaters cannot be veg heads, so you need a large variety of proteins, veggies, fruits and grains to stay healthy or you can become really sick and anemic.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but milk is NOT pus.  It's what babies grow up on.  It's also not harming the cow to milk it.  Meat is not from rotting animals, either.  Check out a dead deer on the side of the road that was hit by a car.  That's rotting meat.|`|wlEBP4HEaa	It depends what kind of veggie you become. I can because I'm a lacto-ovo veggie. I told my mom that I was starting to become concerned with my health and that I was researching healthy foods and becoming a vegetarian is VERY healthy if done right. Show her how you can get your protein, vitmans, etc. I drink Soy Milk to get a lot of the vitamins I miss from meat. When she asks why you decided to become, tell her that you don't feel joy after eating rotted animals. I always get a kick out of when I go to the grocery store and walk by meat that was the word "fresh" on it.|`|mIebCB7daa	Tell your mom that you don't want to be a murderer and do not enjoy eating flesh. Do not eat pus, er uh I mean milk. You really need to become vegan, being a vegetarian is a waste. If your mom doesn't agree or doesn't let you then I would suggest running away|`|lb8FBhWnaa	You should try garden burgers. They look nasty, but they actually taste amazing. (They are not meat substitutes, they taste like Italian food)<br>  Yummm|`|CmLDcfMfaa	A good site to go to is <a href="http://hacres.com/home/home.asp" rel="nofollow">http://hacres.com/home/home.asp</a>  There are two types of Vegetarians.  Make sure you eat plenty of healthy food, whole grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables, beans, legumes, rice milk if you choose to be a Vegan.  There is some B vitamins that you can only get from Red meat take a very good vitamin supplement to get all of your B’s.  Me, I prefer fish, chicken, and red meat once a week.  You would like to know how to tell your mom?  Do your research get different recipe ideas, have your reasons why you want to do this then present it to your mom.  If you are still growing I would go with Vegetarian and not Vegan and drink your milk, eat yogurt and other calcium foods.  Do you know of anyone that is a Vegetarian?  If so talk to them and ask them what types of foods they eat or any recipe ideas.  I think you’ll get a lot of information from www.hacres.com too.  Best to you.<br>  <br>  Vegan Versus Vegetarian <br>  There are general definitions of each of these two categories of non-meat eaters, and within those two "labels", Vegan and Vegetarian, there are individual differences observed group to group or person to person. <br>  <br>  The Generalized Simple Difference: <br>  <br>  Vegetarians do not eat the flesh of animals (meat or seafood), sometimes this is simply a dietary plan for health and/or environmental concerns, other times it is both a dietary preference and a matter of conscience and respect for all members of the animal kingdom with a demonstrated desire to avoid inflicting pain or suffering on them. <br>  <br>  Vegans extend that to avoid not only the consumption of, but also the use of, any animal or animal-derived products. This includes but is not limited to, for example consumption of: meat from any animal, fish or seafood, eggs, dairy products, honey, and gelatin. Vegans are against the use or exploitation of animals, and animal products such as fur, and leather goods. This is not just a dietary plan, but also a political statement or strong personal practice of ethical interaction with the world, born of conscience about the sanctity of life, and love and respect for animals. Veganism is a way of life based on non-violence and respect for life, both sentient and non-sentient. Motivation and attitude are almost as important as behavior in defining Vegans. <br>  <br>  <br>  Examples of Variations in Vegetarian Practices and Preferences: <br>  <br>  Some Vegetarians will eat animal products that are not of the flesh, such as milk and cheese. Some do and don't eat eggs. Some will eat only non-fertilized eggs. There are Vegetarians who do eat seafood and fish (although others believe they are no longer "vegetarians", according to the basic definition, if any flesh of any animal is eaten). There can be very strong opinions one way or the other about these variations in practices. <br>  <br>  There are sub-classifications used to describe some of these different choices among Vegetarians. For example, lacto-vegetarians consume or use dairy products, and lacto-ovo vegetarians include both dairy and eggs in their diets. <br>  <br>  Reasons for Vegetarians to accept or reject fish and eggs are sometimes given, for example: some types of fish do not have "blood" and are, therefore, not considered meat. Similarly, some say eggs don't contain blood so they are eaten for that reason by some Vegetarians, citing, "An egg will only turn into a chicken when fertilized, otherwise it is not meat, just other proteins produced by the chicken. And, as such, eating them is little to no different from consuming milk from mammals as some vegetarians do". <br>  <br>  Other Vegetarians believe that presence or absence of blood is not a defining factor, and will say things like, "I don't eat anything with a face. Fish have characteristics of a face such as eyes, mouths, teeth, and tongues, so I don't eat fish." But, some of those same Vegetarians may include face-less mollusks in their diets. Others say, "If it is in the Animal Kingdom, I do not eat it." <br>  <br>  Examples of Variations in Vegan Practices: <br>  <br>  There seem to be fewer exceptions among Vegans. Some will wear shoes made with some leather, this may be for health reasons (such as needing orthotic shoes or braces and those without leather are in very short supply), or it may just be a personal preference. Again, other Vegans may say that non-use of leather and other animal products is a defining factor for Vegans, and those who do use leather, for any reason, would then be better labeled as "Strict Vegetarians", and not "Vegans". Similarly, some Vegans drink milk (or other animal-derived protein products) to get medically-required extra protein. They may drink milk for the Vitamin D. Others say there are vitamin D supplements and they can get proteins from vegetable sources, and if they do use those products, regardless of reason, they are no longer considered "Vegan" by the basic definition. <br>  <br>  Some Vegans will not go to movies with dogs or other animals in them, or to a rodeo, circus performance, or sports event using an

aPscVrOoaa	It is gentle on the digestive system, replenishes body fluids, the warm steam can help congestion and mostly its a comfort food.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	It's warm, easily digested, & steamy vapour opens nasal passages.|`|AA10927032	Yes, it is a proven scientific fact that chicken soup does fight off a cold.<br>  And it has other benefits to the sick. The warm temp helps loosen congestion. the fluids do the same. It provides really good nutrition, with the chicken and the noodles and veggies. all the ingredients are cooked well, easy to digest. All things to help you feel better faster.<br>  And it is a comfort food, my generation was brought up on Campbell's soup products, I keep a can of chicken noodle in the pantry, and I consider it to be a major part of my first aid kit.  The other parts are Kleenex, some Eucerin cream in a tub for my nose[put some on at the first sign of a cold, and after every sneeze]and it will keep your nose from being sore]. a bottle of night time Nyquil, and assorted pain remedies, elevated temperature remedies, some Robitussin all for daytime use, and some cough drops, but not for an existing cough[they really don't do a lot for the cough, some sugar to coat the throat, and some menthol to make you think you can breathe better menthol does not open sinus passages]cough, for the dry mouth and throat that can cause a cough. . And if I could fit a bathtub of hot water in the emergency kit, it would be there, too.|`|AA11122479	its not the soup it's drinking/eating a hot liquid. it loosens congestion but when it is a specific soup the nutrients in that help your immune system fight off anything you have as well as has a mental effect. if mom always gave you soup when you were sick it brings back good memories.|`|AA11786341	Dr. Stephen Rennard tested his grandma's recipe and came to the <br>  <br>  conclusion that the soup inhibits inflammation in the nasal cavity.<br>  <br>   Drkoop.com and others say it has amino acids that help.<br>  <br>   Another doc says that it creates mucus that soothes the throat. <br>  <br>  Mmmmm...think of that the next time you're eating chicken soup. <br>  <br>  I've also heard that the starch in the noodles helps in some way.|`|s0wBK9eYaa	"Good broth will resurrect the dead"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.westonaprice.org/foodfeatures/broth.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.westonaprice.org/foodfeatures...</a>|`|930525fae9ce50d25e62f663d2250380aa	Probably because it is well cooked, and the ingredients are soft and also the benefits are in the liquid.  When you are sick, you can loose body fluids in several ways, so it is necessary to supply your body with liquid.   One way is by drinking and eating.  So the soup is partial liquid and it will help.  Also to digest soup is not as difficult as eating, chewing and letting the body digest solids in the stomach and intestines, so when you are sick, you would have something that is easy to digest so that your system does not have to work as it usually does.  Another reason is that soup is usually served warm.  When you are sick, it is easier than eating very cold things and bringing your body temperature down, so warm soup helps you feel comfortable too.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if you have a fever, or a soar throat, ice cream helps to cool down the soar area, or makes it easier to accept.|`|TVrLXAFyaa	as a general thing it's because when you make a soup all the ingredients are cooked in the soup, which then in turn leaves nutrients, protien, fibre, vitamins that are not destroyed by heat left in the soup.<br>  for instance gaspacho which is usually just blended raw soft fruit & vegies. by fruit in this soup in mean tomato, cuecumber that sort of thing not peaches or raspberries. with consommes which are clear soups they have all the goodness cooked into them before clarifying with egg whites & a paysanne cut of veg. does this kind of make sense?|`|iapCopyxaa	it's not the soup it self rather than the condiments and spices

You can fill coolers up with sodas and snacks. Make sure you ask for one with TV's and play comedy dvd's while you drive around to destinations. <br>  <br>  If you want to keep the cost down get some of the party go'ers parents involved and see if you make 2-3 stops and peoples houses.<br>  <br>  Stop 1:  snacks<br>  Stop 2: dinner, pizza or something<br>  Last stop: Her house and ask her mom to decorate and do dessert.<br>  <br>  Keep the last stop somewhat interactive. Boys and Girls that age will want to do things but do not want to look stupid or feel awkward. So get some cupcakes and icing and let everyone decorate. Or have a bunch of ice cream flavors and toppings for everyone to make sundae’s. <br>  <br>  After sundaes: buy a huge Canvas put it in the back yard and buy lots of paint and ask everyone to paint something for her so she can keep it as a memory.

sG5FKmAYaa	Oddly, celery is the saltiest plant we eat as a rule, and is the only veggie we eat regularly that we add salt to.<br>  <br>  Here is what the web says.<br>  <br>  Fruits come in a variety of shapes, sizes, textures and flavours. They range from coconuts, apples, oranges, berries and nuts to things we don't always think of as a fruit: tomatoes, capsicums, olives and legumes. <br>  <br>  But while plants such as saltbush and mangroves may have salty seed pods, fruits are rarely salty.<br>  <br>  An exception is the fruit of Carpobrotus glaucescens, commonly known as pigface, which grows in many coastal areas in eastern Australia, says Dr Brett Summerell director of science and public programs at Sydney's Botanic Garden's Trust.<br>  <br>  A reported source of bush tucker in summer, the flesh of the fruit is said variably to have a taste similar to salty apple, banana, fig or strawberry.<br>  <br>  In general, however, there is little evolutionary benefit of plants producing salty fruits, Summerell says.<br>  <br>  A fruit is the fleshy wall or a hard covering that develops around the ripened ovule of the plant, the seed, after fertilisation. This protective covering is important for seed germination and dispersal.<br>  <br>  "It would not be beneficial for plants to produce salty fruits as the salt levels are likely to inhibit germination. <br>  <br>  "Salt in the pigface fruit is leached before germination as the fruit breaks down," explains Summerell.<br>  <br>  Seeds also rely on a variety of dispersal methods. High on the list is being eaten by animals, broken down in the animal's alimentary canal and deposited in a nutrient rich environment. <br>  <br>  This means fruits with sweet flesh are more likely to make a tasty meal for most animals than something with salt. And even bland or piquant flesh can be broken down to provide a nutrient rich environment, says Summerell. <br>  <br>  As salty fruits don't appear often in nature, luckily for those with a savoury tooth, it's easy to add a touch of salt to your tomato|`|pUMkC2s1aa	Salt can come from the sea. Salt that comes from evaporated seawater is often called solar salt.<br>  Salt can also occur in hard layers beneath the ground.  This is called rock salt.

53giV6PFaa	The word pasta comes from Italian pasta which means basically "paste", but also "dough", "pasta", or "pastry" (as in small cake). Today the word "pasta" is reserved for Italian-style noodles in English-speaking countries, while the word "noodle" has a more general meaning, including many similar Asian products. The word noodle actually is derived from the German Nudel, meaning... pasta. <br>  <br>  Pasta can also denote dishes in which pasta products are the primary ingredient, served with sauce or seasonings.|`|0H63P4jAaa	noodles are long and skinny.|`|4e4dddc4fa525276812e1a5cfcd459c7aa	pasta comes in many different forms: linguini, penny, etc. primarily used in Italian cooking and stuff like that.  noodle are primarily in asian cooking: chinese, japanese, etc.  all i know is that they both taste good:)|`|8lYZROjuaa	There isn't any difference.

HsLx92qFaa	Indigestible carbohydrates in beans cause the gas problems. Because they resist enzymatic breakdown in your stomach, they are subject to anaerobic bacterial degradation in your intestines, which releases gas.<br>  <br>  Fortunately, these problem carbohydrates are water-soluble. Simply soaking them in water overnight and then discarding the soak water will eliminate the gas. Also be sure to thoroughly cook your beans. Baking soda is not a solvent for the carbohydrates, so adding them to beans won't really help. Baking soda does reduce cooking time, because basic conditions alter the cell wall structure of the bean. (But the resulting texture isn't as good.)<br>  <br>  The Mexicans add the herb epazote to beans, and it is reputed to eliminate gas problems.<br>  <br>  The quickest way to cook beans is to soak them overnight to soften then up and then cook them in just enough water to cover. Keep them covered with water during the cooking process. You don't want the liquid to dry out and the beans to scorch. I know from experience that lentils are very quick cooking beans, so if you are in a rush, use those. Also, it is very important that you do not introduce any salt (either as table salt or through other ingredients) into the pot of beans UNTIL they are fully cooked. Adding salt  during the early stages of cooking changes the cell wall structure and dramatically prolongs cooking time.<br>  <br>  Indian millets aren't beans. They belong in the Sorghum genus. They aren't legumes.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	A friend of my mother swears that adding about a tbsp of oil to the pan as you're cooking beans will de-gas them. I haven't tried it yet, but plan on it the next time I cook some beans.<br>  <br>  As for the quickest way to cook beans, that would be by pressure cooker. I prefer the slower method of using a slow cooker. <br>  <br>  Indian millets are just a generic name given to small seeds or grains of various plants.|`|OxxrqzCzaa	The only thing I Can tell you is about pink Goya beans, the Only kind I know how to make:  Drain the can & put in pan, then fill the can to the top with water (run water on low so you don't get bubbles on top) & add to beans in pan.  Then peel 2 or 3 potatoes and cut in cubes & add to beans in pot.  Add a packet of Sazon & sprinkle Adobo (I use Goya for both) in pot, mix, then sprinkle Garlic powder, mix & taste the water to ensure it's well-seasoned.  Cook over medium flame & stir, about 1/2 an hour, taste water while cooking to ensure it's seasoned well & when potatoes are soft it's done.  Tastes Great over white rice with the gravy you cook the beans in on top of the rice & maybe sone corn too!|`|KSK22vHUaa	The way my mother taught me to de-gas beans is to soak them overnight in cold water, drain them well and rinse them, and then fill the pot with cooking water.  The "gas" parts are washed away with the soaking water and rinsing.<br>  <br>  Adding about a teaspoon of baking soda per cup of dry beans will help them cook more quickly.  Otherwise I'd suggest crock-potting them all day so you don't have to worry about it.  Just put them in the crock pot in the morning with half an onion and some water and let it cook all day.  They'll be about right if you cook them on low by dinner time and that way you won't have to worry so much about speed because they'll be ready when you need them ( :|`|I7Ee17s0aa	Soak your beans overnight in water mixed with baking soda to get rid of the excess "gas".

1c3YflwVaa	I come from and asian background, and I used forks and spoons and started using chopsticks when I was about seven years of age.

8lYZROjuaa	It's the L-Tryptophan factor.<br>  Milk contains L-Tryptophan which supposedly helps some people feel a bit sleepy.  THAT is why people drink a bit of milk or warm milk and honey to get back to sleep (the warmness and honey just add to the flavor). <br>  I don't like milk either and refuse to drink it.<br>  Turkey also contains that specific ingredient,hence ppl feel like taking a nap after a turkey dinner.<br>  <br>  What is L-tryptophan?<br>  L-tryptophan is an amino acid that is made from plant or animal sources.<br>  <br>  L-tryptophan has been used in alternative medicine as an aid to treat sleep problems (insomnia), anxiety, depression, premenstrual syndrome, attention deficit disorder, and for smoking cessation and other conditions.<br>  <br>  When we had trouble sleeping, mother would bring a cup of warm milk, something grandma had given her for a good night's sleep.

From this observation, the next step was to place L-tryptophan in a capsule and market it.|`|OYD5QqBfaa	Milk is heavy on your stomach , in return you get the full sleepy feeling. <br>  I also believe that there is something in the milk that creates tiredness.|`|IAfCPyAAaa	maybe it satiates people who want more than water but less than something to eat. milk is like liquid snack, full of hearty goodness.|`|9gIMtB9Iaa	Supposedly milk helps you get sleepy, water just makes you pee the bed.|`|HirdewAnaa	Same reason people wake up and have a cigarette.

hDPQ47Q5aa	I do not thing so<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Tunisian Dawn - This recipe is meant for people who are up late and<br>  want to feel a light buzz with the tiny bits of sun light that just<br>  arose from the east.<br>  <br>  The vase is filled with 3/4 of frozen Coca-Cola and with 1/4 of lemon<br>  juice plus 2 slices of lemon. Fill the bowl with Cola tobacco. Make<br>  6-7 medium - large holes in the foil and light it up.<br>  <br>  The Vine - This is a really strong recipe for the serious hookah<br>  smokers.<br>  <br>  We will take white/red wine and pour it into the vase instead of the<br>  water, it might turn out strong, if you prefer a lighter approach,<br>  choose grapefruit juice of something like.<br>  <br>  In the bowl we will put some grape tobacco and make 10 medium holes on<br>  the foil.<br>  <br>  Lemon Suprise - Prepare a bowl with plenty of fresh lemon tobacco.<br>  Look for a lemon tree in your area and pick one shiny green leaf from<br>  the tree.<br>  <br>  Cut the leaf into tiny tiny pieces, and add them into the tobacco<br>  which is inside the bowl.<br>  <br>  Prepare fresh squeezed lemon juice and pour it into the vase. It is<br>  highly recommended to fill up your vase with some ice, to make it cold<br>  and fresh.<br>  <br>  Make many tiny holes into the foil, and right before lighting up the<br>  charcoal, put up another tiny leaf on the foil and under the charcoal.<br>  The leaf will burn out very quickly, but the freshness and angriness<br>  of the lemon will never cease to surprise you.<br>  <br>  Jamacian - We fill up the vase with some frozen water and we'll throw<br>  inside 10-15 very thin lemon slices. We then mix it up a little.<br>  <br>  Fill the bowl up with a 1/3 of mint tobacco and 2/3's of double apple.<br>  It's very important to mix the tobacco really well inside the bowl.<br>  <br>  Holes for the bowl do the following: 14-15 holes in the center, and<br>  then 1 hole at each direction of the compass (north, east, south and<br>  west).<br>  <br>  Light it up and put some Bob Marley on.<br>  <br>  Fresh Apple - Have you ever gotten stuck without tobacco? If so, this<br>  is the recipe for you.<br>  <br>  Take a normal apple, open it up, and remove all of its inside. After<br>  you are left with the peel, take a toothpick or a sharp item you use<br>  for the foil, and make lots of holes in the peel.<br>  <br>  Put the peel on top of the bowl, instead of the foil, when there is no<br>  tobacco inside. Take a charcoal, light it up and place it on top of<br>  the peel.<br>  <br>  It is highly recommended to put apple juice instead of water if you<br>  have some.<br>  <br>  Minty Lemon - Prepare a preferably large bowl with a 1/3 of mint<br>  tobacco and 2/3's of lemon tobacco.<br>  <br>  The vase should be filled according to these orders: 2/3's of ICY<br>  WATER (mandatory) and a 1/3 of vodka. The vodka can be of any brand,<br>  preferably a highly recognize one, or a lemon flavored vodka. If you<br>  want to really push the limits you can replace the water with some<br>  frozen lemon juice.<br>  <br>  Light it up and smell the aroma.<br>  <br>  Tic Tac Tale - This is for those who have a Tic-Tacs (Mint sweets)<br>  lying around and don't know what to do with it.<br>  <br>  We will fill up the vase with normal water and put a few tic tacs<br>  inside (you can put as many as you want).<br>  <br>  Inside the bowl we will put some mint tobacco. Just light it up and<br>  you know the rest.<br>  <br>  Tropical Getaway - This one is meant for people who wished they were<br>  on an island of some sort, and it requires some preparation.<br>  <br>  Go to the closest supermarket and get a tropical flavored juice (such<br>  as mandarin or pineapple), put the newly purchased bottle inside the<br>  freezer and let it stay there until it freezes.<br>  <br>  After it's frozen, pour the juice into the vase along with some cold<br>  water and ice and mix it all together. Put some fruits tobacco in your<br>  bowl, usually people use 70% fruits tobacco and 30% peach tobacco. It<br>  is highly recommended to roll some foil into tiny balls and place them<br>  inside the bowl to separate the flavors.<br>  <br>  Make dozens of tiny holes, light it up, close your eyes and decide<br>  which island you're on.<br>  <br>  Lemonade Stand - This is a recipe for new smokers and for the more<br>  experienced ones.<br>  <br>  Light Smokers - Take your vase and put some water in it. After it is<br>  filled, squeeze some lemon drops into the vase. Of course the bowl<br>  will be filled with lemon tobacco. Smoke away...<br>  <br>  Heavy Smokers - Inside the vase you can put some lemon vodka if you<br>  have any or water which is also okay. Squeeze an entire lemon or less<br>  into the vase, each person likes it his own way, we recommend half a<br>  lemon or more. As for the bowl, cut the used lemon's peel into tiny<br>  tiny pieces, so you can place them in between the lemon tobacco<br>  inside.<br>  <br>  Now you tell me this is not a Hookah lemonade stand.<br>  <br>  Orange County - Are you having an orange day? if you do check this<br>  out.<br>  <br>  Take some fresh squeezed orange juice and pour it into the vase, you<br>  can also scratch some of the orange's peel and put that into the vase<br>  also. Now all you have to do is to put some orange tobacco inside the<br>  bowl, and look at the orange side of life.<br>  <br>  Tequila Shooter - Put tequila in the vase along with the water. Ad

odoEZC0Haa	Eat a big dinner with lots of protein with will take a longer time to digest. You could also have your dinner later. And you could fill up on (heathy) snacks after dinner.<br>  If you ate again at 10 you probably wouldn't get hungry at 11-1<br>  <br>  They only way i have found that makes hunger go away is to eat.<br>  <br>  And drinking water doesn't help at all. You still feel like eating food.|`|1oiZwj50aa	Drink water..|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Hello Angel.  That's my daughters' name, too.  It could be that your body is craving certain vitamins and minerals or you could just be eating too much and your body is craving the "full" feeling you get when your stomach tells your brain that you are full.<br>  <br>  Try to eat more healthy foods and NEVER do something else while eating.  You need to stare at your plate and eat slowly and conscientiously.  That way your brain will know when you are full.  It takes about 20 minutes for your brain to tell your body to quit eating.  If you're watching television or playing on the computer, your brain doesn't get that signal fast enough.<br>  <br>  Then, when you wake up, down a huge glass of water to fill your belly.|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Hiya Angel, try drinking a tall glass of water before you go to bed. It will fill your belly up, and your brain will think you're full. Great thing is, water has no fat/calories or anything bad, and you'll probably have to go first thing in the morning making it easier to wakeup!<br>  <br>  I heard from a doctor once that most of the time when we're feeling hunger, it's thirst.

8lYZROjuaa	Potatoes and sausage will take the longest, so place them in first and begin the steaming process with your desired herbs.  Depending on the size of the potatoes, steam until almost fork tender, add corn for 8 minutes, then the shell fish for another 8 - 12 minutes.  <br>  I guess the layering would be in the order that you cook the goods. <br>  I would half some lovely red potatoes and top with fresh parsley, then throw some 1 -2 inches sausage slices on top of the potatoes.  steam for 20 minutes (like I said, depends on the size of the potatoes);   Add corn on the cob a few minutes before adding shellfish.  Shellfish should be well seasoned with old bay and cooked 8-12 minutes depending upon the size.  This should be done to near perfection all at the same time. <br>  If not, just explore a little  more the next time you do it.   It all works ojut after a couple of attempts.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	Never had one from Joe's, but I would cook the taters first as they take the longest.  I would think cooking the taters with the Old Bay would make a good broth to cook the rest in.  I don't even know how long to cook shrimp and lobster in a crock pot.  <br>  <br>  Try looking up Ochef.com for ideas.  There are a lot of questions and answers there.

Some ppl CLAIM they don't like anchovies but little do they know... they DO enjoy anchovies mixed into their favorite condiments!|`|lLPIs7WFaa	a pizza without anchovies is like a burger without cheese.   Unthinkable.  unimaginable  not to mention inedible.  I usually order double and sometimes triple anchovies.   I also really like smoked oysters and canadian bacon pizza.|`|PxJXJKCpaa	No, but I love anchovies in Cesaer Dressing and Puttenesca.  They really don't taste like much, but they do add salt to what ever you put them in.|`|eJ7t5Xgyaa	Yes please.   Smoked oysters sounds pretty good too.  That settles it <br>  I am having pizza for dinner.
ygcbrp5Uaa	Beans, red rice, tortillas, meat, salsa, and plenty of fried food are just some of the basics. The four main staples you'll find in any Mexican kitchen are: beans, rice, corn, and cheese. From those, the vast majority of Mexican dishes can be made.<br>  <br>  If you want to gain weight by eating Mexican food though, try eating tamales a few times a week. We don't call them "lard bars" for nothing. (All of us in my family gain weight around X-mas and New Years because of it...) <br>  <br>  Keep in mind though, we eat a lot of the same foods as anyone else including sushi. (Actually, Mexican sushi is wonderful! Completely different take then American and Japanese sushi...)<br>  <br>  By far though, nothing competes with a fast food or junk food diet to gain weight...|`|v1tHjJ3haa	the truth.......tortillas, beans, beef in fresh tortillas with tons of hot sauce, chicken, eggs, pork/ham/chorizo, cheese, milk, sweet breads, rice, tons of coffee and pop, candies, chips, little veggies and fruits, and cream.... not healthy mostly fattening crap also beer and soups......I live in Mexico, that's why I eat healthy now :D<br>      The truth is that ppl don't knokw unless they live here.......poorer ppl who don't live in the city eat healthier, but city ppl, let me tell you, most are overweight and if they aren't ppl look at them like they're gonna die when they look fine ! I am one of those 'sickly' girls who don't eat enough, LOL !|`|PxJXJKCpaa	A true Mexican diet is pretty healthy.  It's the Tex Mex that's full of grease and oils.  That's not the way you should gain weight.  Like you, I am underweight as well.  Menopause killed my need for food so I haven't eaten since last summer.  I'd get sick if I ate beans and tortillas all the time.<br>  <br>  Try this one (cheap and easy)<br>  1 box of rice (uncle bens that you fry first then add water)<br>  1 lb hamburger<br>  frozen veggies<br>  your favorite cheese (whole chunk is better than shredded)<br>  <br>  <br>  Fry up your burger and put in a bowl leaving most of the meat fat in the pan.  Make the rice according to directions.  With 5-8 minutes left on the rice, add the veggies but don't stir in or the rice won't fully cook.  When the rice is done, add the burger to the top and cheese to that.  The box I used today said "let the rice sit for 5 minutes" so the heat from the stove and pan melted the cheese nicely.<br>  <br>  I make a lot of stuff like that for me as you can change it up nicely.  If your still in the market for Mex dishes, burritos can be changed up quite readily.  Shredded chicken with cream sauce is enchilada, smoked shredded pork is Car-nee-tas eated like fajitas.  Fish tacos, bean tacos, shredded beef tacos or burritos (those are great).<br>  <br>  My son in law is Latino and hates Mexican food like the way his parents make it.  Good luck gaining weight.|`|mA3ZAKVfaa	Eat 7 hot dogs per meal for 7 days, then 7 banana's per day on the second week, and the 7 hard boiled eggs a day for the third week,and then repeated and continue till you desire the weight you want, OR if your losing or want to lose more weight, put a teaspoon of Apple Cider Vinegar in a glass of water and drink at each meal and you will lose weight, but always consult with your doctor to make sure you have no reaction s as you may be alleric to some of the things anyone mentions. Just to be safe. Have a very lovely week|`|M9WZ2vtuaa	I was ganna say Tacos and Burritos...|`|rVCb9v8faa	Anything with corn and beans....|`|nSHXjismaa	same here
97d0019793c23cc63e29acb23c85c48baa	You need to 'proof' your yeast...that is prove that it is still alive and working. you should store your yeast tighty sealed in the fridge. To proof it, put the required amt the recipe calls for in the warm water, and I always add the sugar too. Whisk it WELL. you need to get it to start dissolving. Wait 10-15 minutes. It should start foaming, If it doesnt, ites dead and you need to get new yeast and properly store it.<br>  <br>  ALSO never put the salt in with the yeast. Salt kills yeast and will stop bread from rising. Salt gets mixed in with the flour, not the water.<br>  <br>  Remeber- sugar, yeast and water go together. yeast uses the sugar for food.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	I always test mine on my wrist as if I were preparing a baby bottle. It may take a bit longer  to rise if it's a bit too cool, but at least you won't kill the yeast with heat. <br>  <br>  Also, have you checked to see if your yeast is still active/alive? Just put it in the warm liquid from your recipe and add about a teaspoon of sugar. After about 5-10 minutes it should begin to foam a bit if your yeast is still alive. This keeps you from wasting a lot of flour on dead yeast.|`|VIgfOpyaaa	Don′t make it so complicated. Take a teaspoonful of sugar and mix it with your yeast. When the yeast is fluid, it is ok. Your yeast really becomes fluid by the sugar. You must not fear, that your bread becomes sweet. The yeast will feed up the sugar.|`|wFNXdj6gaa	It should feel as warm as a baby's bottle, drip some on the inside of your elbow and it would feel warm but not so hot to hurting<br>  <br>  Exactly what MissDementia said|`|AA11124885	You should be able to tell it's warm, not just barely there.
8WdFnf0Eaa	True vanilla must be harvested by hand.  It is the seed pod of a species of orchid, and is rare, delicate and labor intensive.  True vanilla extract is made from the pods and seeds, but imitation vanilla is made from chemicals, and you can tell the difference if you have any sort of a palate.|`|7xbSG3lQaa	The beans only grow in certain areas of the world and can be difficult to cultivate. Additionally, when certain companies like Coke make vanilla flavored products, the demand for Vanilla goes up and so does the price. <br>  <br>  You can get vanilla extracts of varying quality. The higher end stuff is more expensive. <br>  <br>  Also, there are various methods used to produce Vanilla which can raise the price significantly. Alcohol-free extract uses a different method, for example.|`|zo4gb6qzaa	something like that cant cost 24 dollars maybe 5 or 10!!! and its kinda cause of the season and expenses the tomatos are like 1 dollar a pound!!! lol :) hope i helped|`|3Zad0UuWaa	Because its pure and not mixed with other ingredients yet|`|hLohtlPEaa	I don't know where you live but the tiny bottles of vanilla extract at CVS are reasonable.

I took a whole wheat pita, cut it in half, then quarters. I took the top and bottom apart and made small sandwiches with cream cheese and salsa. This works well with any of the fruity salsas (I used a Mango Pineapple Chipotle). Very refreshing. You could also do cream cheese and spinach, feta cheese and spinach, or just salsa and veggies if you're vegan. <br>  <br>  You could saute some tofu and veggies and have a bit of a stir fry. <br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with a simple PB+J or Grilled Cheese. I've gone back to those comforting childhood foods a lot lately. <br>  <br>  Salads are good, and easy. Just toss in some of your favorite cheese, veggies, croutons, tofu, whatever. <br>  <br>  Hummus and pita chips, veggies, or whatever else you might have makes a good light lunch, but it keeps you satisfied. Have a piece of fruit, too.|`|Ni3hjtlsaa	Whole wheat bread turkey sandwich or a chicken salad and a fruit.<br>  <br>  OR tuna. Tuna is awesome for your body.

AA11119758	They need to know that there is a reason they aren't allowed to drink legally and that is that they are not smart enough to handle it.<br>  You can get all the alcohol you want in prison (where it seems possible you are headed)  depending on what you are willing to do to get it.|`|db32e228f722e24e3c47946a59ae4075aa	Me...<br>  <br>  just avoid it all together and you won't have to worry about it.<br>  <br>  Simple... just avoid it.. it's not good for you.

eL268hETaa	The smart alec answer to your question would be that technically PLAIN flour is unbleached and would be a different colour ;-)<br>  <br>  But I think the only difference in self-rising and regular is added baking powder in one.  The difference is mainly in what it DOES during the baking process, not what it tastes like.<br>  <br>  Raw flour tastes nasty either way, so read the label and make life less complicated.  ;-)|`|0eaFftjyaa	You cant taste the difference but as the man above said they should have a slightly different colour. But is is not worth guessing cause using the wrong one will ruin what ever you are making|`|YoNMn90Maa	Self-raising is finer, in my opinion

71h39Q5faa	My grandmother made the best cakes from scratch.  She introduced me to the pound cake.<br>  <br>  One pound of flour<br>  One pound of sugar<br>  One pound of butter<br>  One pound of eggs<br>  One pound of milk<br>  2 tsps baking powder<br>  1 tsp baking powder<br>  1 tsp salt<br>  1 tsp vanilla<br>  <br>  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.  Grease and flour 2 - 9' pans or 3 loaf pans.<br>  <br>  A pound of eggs is one dozen but I usually only use 8.  You cream the butter and the sugar til creamy.  Add bp, bs and salt to the flour.  Sift flour the flour. (use a strainer) Slowly add 1/4 of the flour, 1/4 of the milk (add vanilla to the milk), one egg at a time, repeat and mix until all ingredients are incorporated.  Bake 45-50 minutes until done.  Prick with a toothpick or knife, cake should spring bake when touched.<br>  <br>  This is a traditional pound cake,  You can change it by adding 1/2 cup of melted semi sweet chocolate morsels, or 2 tsps of lemon flavoring (leave out the vanilla), or 1 tsp of almond flavor (leave in the vanilla), <br>  <br>  So this one recipe is great for so many different cakes.  Once you perfect it you will love it.  Measure carefully because I too have moved from foods to baking and there is a big difference.  No banging, stomping etc or it will fall.  This cake is also great with chocolate frosting.

My story was very similar to yours. I did not drink everyday but when i did drink i drank to get drunk. If there was one beer in the fridge I would not bother for that would be pointless. I did not realize that just because i did not drink every day did not mean that i would not happen in the future for alcoholism is a progressive illness and does not get any easier or sweeter it get's out of control and unbearable. It's sounds like your willing which is the first step to changing your life. I would not suggest trying this on your own. I couldn't. Because t is an illness for which i had no cure. Try looking up some AA meetings. They saved my life. Among with the suggestions and my higher power. <br>  Just remember If not now When. How long will you test the waters just to prove to yourself you are not? you know what i mean? if you have any questions whatsoever e-mail me at cabeenchee@yahoo.com <br>  Oh and just to clear things up AA is in no way shape or form a religions organization.

da580af9e5114d80d24d6e1ac5858417aa	I've personally used "celery seed" as a replacement for celery (when the crops in the U.S. have been damaged by weather, and good quality celery was scarce, not available, or over-the-top expensive).

ephBKMthaa	You already know the answer to your question, she is an alcoholic. <br>  <br>  As for what you can do, I'm sorry to say - probably not much.  Since she's lying to you, you can bet she's lying to herself - that she doesn't have a problem.  And unless she acknowledges that there is a problem, she won't do anything to fix it, anything you do for her will be like spitting in the wind.  <br>  <br>  If you ever catch her sober you could try to talk with her about it. About how it makes you feel towards her, sad and confused.  And tell her, not in a mean way - but an honest loving way, what you see when you look / talk to her when she's drunk.  Ask her why she feels the need to escape behind alcohol?  Remind her that you know she is a good person, but you haven't seen that person in awhile, and that you are afraid for her.  Ask if this is how she wants her grandkids to remember her?  I don't know, you could get through to her, but don't count on it.  <br>  <br>  I also suggest you go to an Al-anon meeting, where you can meet others in similar situations.<br>  <br>  I will pray for you both.  <br>  <br>  Ultimately it is her decision, to drink or not to drink.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|qZ0310yVaa	you have to make her get help before it is to late

Cool and store in a clean air tight jar.<br>  Enjoy Your Vegetarian Kitchen’s amazingly flavorful, crispy, golden vegan tofu cutlets. An entrée guaranteed to please the most discriminating palate.<br>  <br>  Organic Extra Firm Tofu — allow a minimum of at least 1/4 pound or three slices per person. You will need to do the following marinade twice so make sure that you have double the amount of the following on hand:<br>  1/2 Cup Eden Tamari or Shoyu<br>  1/4 Cup Eden Mirin<br>  1 Tbs. Ground Coriander<br>  1 Tbs. Ground Cumin<br>  1 Tbs. Minced Garlic<br>  1 Tbs.

Line baking sheet(s) with parchment and a thick layer of wilted onions and sauce. <br>  Place each block of Extra Firm Tofu on a cutting board and cut it in half diagonally. Set the halves upright so that the hypotenuse of the triangular wedge faces you. Slice thin triangles from the blocks of tofu. You should get 6 thin slices from each half. Allow a minimum of 3 slices per person. Place each slice on the bed of wilted onions in a geometrical pattern. <br>  In a separate small bowl create a duplicate of the marinade without the sesame oil. Using a pastry brush, paint the triangles with the mixture of 1/2 Cup each Tamari or Shoyu, 1/4 Cup Eden Mirin, along with a splash of San-J Szechwan Hot Sauce. Add 1 Tbs. each Ground Coriander, Ground Cumin, 1 Tsp each Granulated Garlic and Ginger; and a splash of Szechwan Hot Sauce to taste. Then paint each with Toasted Sesame Oil. Sprinkle with Szeged Paprika. <br>  Bake at 400° for 30 - 40 minutes until golden and somewhat crispy.

Granulated Garlic<br>  1 tsp Chili Powder<br>  1/4 Cup Shoyu<br>  1/4 Cup Olive Oil<br>  Shredded Jalape?a Soy Cheese <br>  Place each block of extra firm Tofu on a cutting board.<br>  Cut it in half on the diagonal. Set them upright so that the hypotenuse faces you. Using a metal spatula, with a thin blade, carefully cut a wedge shape from the center of each half. The walls should be about 5/8 of an inch thick. Reserve removed wedges and crumble finely into a mixing bowl.(Make one cut along each of the outside walls being very careful not to cut all the way through the block. Using the edge of the spatula cut straight down and then cut parallel to the bottom. Lift the wedge of tofu out and reserve.) Mix 1/4 Cup Hungarian Paprika, 1 tsp Chili Powder, with 3 Tbs.

(Beans are harder to put on the bottom layer without messing up the chips, but don’t look as pretty on the top, so it’s up to you).  Crumble up what’s left of the chips and sprinkle them on top.  You can also put a layer of grated cheese, frozen corn, olives, tomatoes, or fresh avocado.|`|UM2RvgAgaa	Italian Sandwich<br>  <br>  Yield   4 sandwiches<br>  Time  5 minutes<br>  Tools  <br>  <br>      * Knife<br>      * Paper towels<br>  <br>  Ingredients  <br>  <br>      * 4 pieces of focaccia or Italian bread<br>      * 4 t olive oil<br>      * 1 clove garlic<br>      * 1 pound fresh mozzarella<br>      * salt<br>      * pepper<br>      * 2 tomatoes, sliced<br>      * 1 bunch fresh basil OR several T pesto<br>  <br>  Directions  Split the bread in half lengthwise and drizzle each piece with olive oil.

A5gfxSyzaa	If he is eating food he's getting enough protein.  Most people get 2 to 3 times more protein then they need, which adds stress to your kidneys, uses up more minerals and is bad for your bones.  You already said he's eating veggies - is he drinking milk, eating peanut butter, cheese, eggs, oatmeal, wheat bread?  If so he's fine.  You don't want to give him a protein powder or anything because you'll be doing more potential damage then good.  If he learns to eat beans that's great, but you don't have to eat them to get a well rounded diet.  <br>  <br>  Make sure he eats lots of fruits and veggies, limit the sugar and junk food.  Some fat is important for his development so try cooking with olive oil.  Make sure he's getting dairy with some fat in it or things like coconut and avacado.  Fat is important for many reasons including brain development and not enough is more dangerous then too much.|`|AA12334360	The average diet has WAY TOO MUCH protein in it, it really is not a problem if he eats a least some vegetables.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you can read this page about protien from the veggie society, it explains what protien is, how much we need and where we get it from on a veggie diet - well worth 5 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vegsoc.org/info/protein.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegsoc.org/info/protein.html</a>|`|ZKw46efXaa	There are vitamins desgined especially for vegetarians, i take them! <br>  <br>  You can get them on healthy direct website.|`|AA11119758	I think your best bet is soy milk, eggs and dairy. They will provide all the protein, iron and B12 he needs (the only nutrients in meat). Chocolate and vanilla soy milk taste great!|`|5AbCtkWFaa	I'm not a huge bean fan--I have to have something crunchy or carby with them.  If there are Middle Eastern places near you, see if he likes falafel, which is made from ground chickpeas (garbanzo beans) and spices, then fried.  Hummus is a creamy dip made from chickpeas, tahini, and lemon juice; it's awesome!  If he likes stews and soups, hide them in there.  You can make chili with crumbled tempeh or veggie crumbles, both of which are good sources of protein.<br>  <br>  I don't know any vegetarian vitamin brands that might be available in the UK for children, so I can't help you there.  You might also want to find vegetarian cookbooks that are geared toward or have recipes for children.  "How it All Vegan!" by Sarah Kramer and Tanya Barnard has a kids' section and "Vegan Lunchbox" by Jennifer McCann has kid-friendly recipes.<br>  <br>  But as long as he's eating a balanced diet with a variety of foods, protein should not be a problem.|`|646fe42a895447edfec28e3ca8106fa2aa	As a vegetarian he needs to replace the protein and iron that he now isn't getting from meat so specifically he needs pulses and dark green veggies - beans are easy enough to 'hide' in other food so try that trick.<br>  I wanted to go veggie when I was 7 but I didn't eat any veggies and so my parents wouldn't let me.  I improved my diet over a year and ate veggies and then when I was 8 I was allowed to stop eating meat - so maybe threaten him with that?<br>  Being vegetarian is healthier than eating meat (Vegetarians live longer and are less likely to have heart attacks because they aren't eating animal fat)- but only if you ensure that you are eating a well balanced diet.|`|YfxydPF5aa	Have you tried hummus? You might be able to get him to eat it since it doesn't look like beans. Will he eat nuts/nutbutters? Those have a lot of protein.

You are a reckless parent.|`|NxLmvKtJaa	how about Children's Chewable Vitamins?|`|sMTVcfiVaa	Usually, you don't need to worry about protein. Most westerners have a diet that has more protein than their bodies can handle.<br>  <br>  Corn has a lot of protein, and so do all dairy products and eggs.<br>  <br>  You could also sneak them in. Make Mexican dishes with black beans, mix in refried beans into things, make pot pie with beans in it, and of course, tofu and other soy products are, naturally, beans, so that should be easy enough. You don't need to looooove beans to be a veg!|`|S1YGHrRzaa	I do responsibly believe it's stupid to do that. We're not vegetarian animals. We're omnivores. Vegetarian animals have a different digestive tract and their digestive organs are different from ours.<br>  We're meant to eat vegetal and animal (meat too!). It's the way we process it and obtain it that makes it harmful for us. Children especially are in need of a varied diet.<br>  And if you think that vegan diet will make you live longer, let me just say that: deprived of all its pleasures life will not be longer. It will only seem that way...<br>  On the other hand... Why the hell would someone want to live longer?! What's it good for?! Do you really think that life here is so good that it's worth prolonging it at all costs?! Bah!<br>  They say that an old couple dies. They reach Heaven's Door and there's old St. Peter there, welcoming them. He says: "Here, you have this wonderful bungalow on this gorgeous tropical beach. All you need is in the closets and cupboards. You can go swim and fish in the ocean, walk on the shore. There are no sharks, there's never a hurricane and the weather is always perfect. If you ever grow tired of cooking you can eat for free at any of the numerous restaurants on the island. <br>  The old man hits his wife with his elbow and says: "See? If it wasn't for all your healthy eating crap, exercising and dieting, we would have been here more than 10 years ago!"
f6fCixDnaa	I dont think there is a simple easy answer to this question. Occasionally when at work i sometimes buy Mother (its australia-dno if its in US) I drink it slowly over a few hours mainly because it is a large can but also because it has more caffene then one should consume in a day.<br>  <br>  I think its fine to drink energy drinks as long as you dont chug them. The main issue is the high caffene which can be the equivilent of 2 or more coffees in one hit. The sugar is also high making it full of calories.<br>  <br>  You should never have more than 1 per day. Personally i think max of 2 per week. Over consumtion of caffene can create addictions to it, twitches or spasms in the body (such as eye, toe etc spasms), increased heart rate and lack of ability to sleep. (dont consume if you have heart conditions!)<br>  <br>  Just watch how much you consume and make sure you arent reacting badly.|`|Npi4QR7Maa	Rockstar and Redbull are the worst.

5AbCtkWFaa	Wow, where do I start?  You can have pasta with marinara sauce.  You can have stir-fries with tofu or tempeh.  You can grill vegetables and serve with rice.  There are veggie sausages, veggie burgers, veggie dogs, and so on, and you can eat those.  Many ethnic cuisines have numerous vegetarian options.  Indian food is especially good, as they tend to be veg-friendly.  A bowl of cereal and (soy) milk is a meal.<br>  <br>  Check out www.vegweb.com for ideas.|`|Cfja6h4Kaa	Eat plenty of fresh veggies, beans and brown rice, and you shouldn't have to worry too much about the vitamins. The hardest thing when you're a vegetarian is getting all your essential proteins.<br>  <br>  For a great meal, stir fry some veggies in teriaki or ginger sauce, and serve over brown rice.|`|D74Lj3H7aa	Cooked leafy vegetables are the best and taste yummm when sauted|`|S1YGHrRzaa	I think you're mistaking. Examine any traditional cuisine, of any nation around the globe and you won't find ANY that's entirely vegetarian or even vegan. You know why?! Because, though it may come as a surprise to you, homo sapiens was not designed to be a vegetarian. Should it have been so, his digestive system would have been totally different. Our digestive system, and our dentition, as well as that of the primates, needs both animal food as well as vegetal food. Restricting yourself to only one is inviting trouble. On the other hand, it is my strong opinion that the REAL key is MODERATION. Nothing is good in large amounts, food least of all. Too little food will kill you just as surely as too much will! Moderata durant, said the ancient Romans. That is, "Moderate ones last". That is what we all want after all, isn't it?!|`|AA11119758	You can make any of your favorite meals vegetarian by leaving the meat out. You need to eat a varied diet with plenty of beans, low fat dairy, nuts and whole grains for protein and iron and a wide variety of fruits and vegetables for vitamins and minerals. There are plenty of websites to give you lists of foods, recipes and tips if you just take the time to do the research.<br>  If you don't have the time, I guess you aren't very committed to the diet.
