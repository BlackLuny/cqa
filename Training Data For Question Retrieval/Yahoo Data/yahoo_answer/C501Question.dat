20090205084028AAGhaby	Health;Diet & Fitness	Anyone else trying to lose some weight?	So I've recently bought an elliptical cross trainer and so far I manage about 20 mins a day (I've only been at it about 3 or 4 days) before I near have a heart attack. :)    What I'm wondering is, should I maybe try and work out more than once a day? Will 2 sets of 20 mins be as good as 1 set of 40 mins?    Also if anyone has experience with using an elliptical to lose weight....please tell me an inspirational story. I am in bad need of a 'Rocky' moment. How long you reckon it'll be before I start seeing a difference in my body?   Ok, so the last thing I wanted to ask is about simple low calorie meals. I've tried googling that but everything I find seems ridiculously complicated. I'm not a good cook truth be told, cereal being the one thing I've managed to master, so if anyone can give me genuinely easy things to throw together I'd really appreciate it.    Oh and also....what's the latest time one should eat? Some people are saying 5pm others say 8pm so if anyone has a new time to throw into the mix then go for it.      Finally, to all those who take the time to read this and possibly answer thank you for your time, I appreciate all answers, and I especially appreciate them from anyone in the same situation as me. Hopefully we'll all manage to retain the will power we need to get off that excess weight. Best of luck.

20090205084335AAoHyM3	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Skin Conditions	Why do I have these red dots all over my stomach and back?	For the past month especially, my skin has felt extremely itchy, especially when I lay down on a bed. I don't itch it because it does go away. I thought maybe it was just dry skin because it is cold out.      Now, on my stomach (from my belly button all the way up to my chest), sides,and part of my lower back, I have light red patchy dots all over it. The ones on my stomach and sides are not painful. The ones on my back can get itchy. I think these "dots" have just appeared within the last 4 or 5 days. I have not changed anything in detergent or soaps....this has never happened to me before.      I work out 6-7 days a week and I take a hot shower after every work out (I sweat too much and need to take them). Could this be why? I am afraid it might be eczema, but could it just have to do with taking hot showers every day? What should I do? Any help is appreciated, thanks.

I am wondering if anyone can help me out here, because my doctor here in France is an utter moron + can’t give me an answer. So I’d like to hear from anyone who’s gone through the same/similar.   I am on the pill (Adepal) + have taken two packs consecutively (throughout my teenage years I did this many times with no consequences), but I missed on of the pills.   I started bleeding on the Monday + had really bad cramps. On the Saturday I had excruciating cramps + went to the toilet. But before I sat down, a massive clump of mucus fell out of me along with a load of blood. I sat down on the toilet + when I took my Tampax out, a flesh coloured sac came out along with more blood. On the Monday I went to the doctors (very unhelpful) + then went to the clinic for a blood test. Yesterday I got the results back proving negative for pregnancy, which ruled out a miscarriage. But the doctor can’t give me an explanation as to what it was. Before it all happened I’d had sore breasts for about three weeks + also constant heartburn (which I had throughout my pregnancy with my now 6 year old son) + felt as though I was pregnant. I’ve been taking Exacyl ampules to stop the bleeding, but they’ve made me bleed more.   My fiancé + myself have been very upset thinking that it’s a miscarriage + we want to know what it was which the medical ‘profession’ isn’t telling us. If anyone can shed any light I’d be most grateful. Thank you.

20090205090552AAZ2yK3	Health;Diet & Fitness	Can anyone answer this question?	so ive always wondered how and why the body stores extra calories from food. Say for example a person burns 2000 calories a day and that person eats 2500 one day, why dont the calories just carry over to the next day and just never store away? i mean why doesnt the body just use those calories for the next day?   I dont know why the body doesnt do this but my best guess is that the body can only use so many calories at a time and thats why they say its better to eat 5-7 small meals a day so the body only burns what it needs when it needs it and never stores anything from 600-900 calorie meals.

I feel like every bad thing always happens to me. I am so very tired of being alive. I'm young but yet I feel like I am old and my life should end because it's just so exhausting. I am tired of feeling like everything is against me. Things just keep on happening and happening to me, then things seem like they might start to get a little better and something new happens to make them worse again. I am on treatment for depression but it just doesn't seem to be working, no matter what, I just feel like everything is against me, is weighing down on me, like there's nothing I can do to make things better for me. I have no particular plan to kill myself but I do kind of wish I was dead rather than keep having to live this horrible life any more. Is there any way I can improve things or make myself happier?

He is on the pump and the past few months he's gotten this "I don't care attitude". He won't test his blood sugars unless we constantly remind him and a few times he's been telling me that he has bolused for meals and we find out later when his bg's are in the 400's that he hasn't. I try to let him have some freedom with his diabetes such as bolusing himself but I'm beginning to think I'm gonna have to do it every time to make sure it's done. I would like to find an older diabetic to talk with him about complications so he will take it more seriously. What do you think??

Hi      I have been diagnosed with delayed gastric emptying which is secondary to something else that is going on within my body(appantly- according to my doctor). He has told me to go back in a month for another blood test (all of my blood tests show inflammation but the other test that show inflammation cell scan- come back negative).      While I am waiting to figure out what this other thing is, I was just wondering what happens to the gastroparesis. Is it a life long thing? Am I going to continue to lose weight (about a stone and a half so far)? Do I just control it with portion size (the medication didn't agree with me)?      He has basically told me that I have it (I am a student nurse and he knows that I am going to research it) but has not told me anything about the long term.      I was just wondering if there is anyone out there who can help me.      Thank you so much for your help

20090205091234AAi7sHD	Health;Women's Health	How do I prevent my boobs from sagging?	I am lucky in the sense that I have an hourglass figure including very large breasts (F36). I'm only 16 years old but I've often been told that I look a lot older. Now, lately I've notice that my breasts have started to sag. This absolutely terrifies me because if my breasts are starting to sag at this age, I'm thinking, "Damn, what will they be like when I'm 40?".   I like my body a lot and I don't want to change anything about it. I have considered perhaps getting a breast reduction when I'm old enough to do it myself or maybe just an uplift but generally I would really rather not turn to surgery to fix this.      Is there anything that I can do to prevent my boobs from sagging? They aren't sagging too much right now so if I can't fix the damage, oh well, but if I can I would be grateful for any advice on how to do so.      Due to my ethnicity my skin is naturally more greasy but it also doesn't wrinkle much (my parents and grandparents look a lot younger than others their age). I don't know if that helps but I read somewhere that sagging of breasts is something to do with skin elasticity.      Please help. :(

20090205092122AAIVwhK	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Swollen Glands and Inflamed Throat.?	Okay, basically I went to the doctor today and apparently have an inflamed throat and swollen glands. Not that I am in any way new to this 'condition', wrong word but basically my brain is refusing to work in any way today. I am thirteen years old and at two years old I suffered from croup. Out of all the times I've been to the doctor 99.9% I have had these two 'conditions'. At the age of three the croup came back, and this time it was more serious this time, to an extent that I almost had to have a hole cut at the back of my throat so as to allow a breathing tube to be placed there to allow my breathing to function normally. Very luckily I recovered from it before I did get the operation. I am wondering if there could be something to do with the croup that makes me have the two conditions so much. I probably sound like an idiot and I'm probably wrong but y'know :-L, just wondering.    Thanks for listening to the probably most stupid question you have read in your life. xD   ~Kirsten   xxx

I hate working, studying, and education, but ultimately i am intelligent and a high achiever. I am currently at university and love the social side, but thouroughly hate the academic side. i have no motivation to work, even in a subject i enjoy. i just cannot pay more than 5 seconds attention on something im required to do. I have no problems with reading random stuff that interests me, but for some reason i just cannot read stuff im told to. I study philosophy and long ago concluded life is nihilisitic and pointless and that all i can do is try to enjoy myself before i inevitably die. Im not religious or spiritual since neither exist. Is there anything i can do to get motivation or do i possibly have a psychological problem?

It sounds like a clock that is getting faster and faster.      What would you do, if you woke up one night and heard your alarm clock doing that?   You feel a force in your room of pure evil.   Then the clock gets faster and faster and faster, then smoke starts to come out of it.  This is because of the evil warping space and time, and denaturing existence.   Then eventually your clock starts to melt like molten wax and bubbles on the table; the room stinks of burnt plastic.      You try to get away from the clock, but then the door shuts and the room goes pitch black.   Then a black void opens in the ceiling, this pulls you off the floor through some sort of upward gravity, slowly towards the void.   Then you disappear as the whole room bursts in the flames.      The neighbors see your charred remains the next day, as your soul got taken to a place 190 times hotter than hell.      What would you do, if that happened?   What would you do?      Listen to that extract again, close your eyes and imagine it.   What the F would you do?      CREED
20090204214850AAqqZ1A	Health;Mental Health	How do you stop over analyzing life?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

Aparte de los dolores vienen lo que yo llamo Ataques....esos dan dolores que me hacen llorar y pueden durar 48 horas sin alivio ninguno.  Estoy harto de ver medicos que ni siquiera quieren escucharme, claro porque yo soy un nadie que no ha estudiado la medicina asi mis comentarios no tienen valor a esa gente. Entiendo y acepto que hay medicos buenos, pero existen en numeros peque?os al lado de los prepotentes que creen que saben de todo, que malafortunadamente son los unicos que me ha proporcionado la seguridad social.

20090204222930AAV892W	Health;Mental Health	OCD? ORAL FIXATION? Avoidant Personality Disorder?	I know a girl. She is like my sister; I know her like the back of my hand. She is always chewing on stuff like pencils, her lips, plastic, and whatever else she can find. She hates people (like me) and doesn't feel comfortable in close or crowded places. She has problems working under pressure and she like older men. I'm worried about her. She meets most of her boyfriends online. Which is really unsafe. I believe she is an introvert. Everytime I turn around, she is in love with one man or another. How can I help her? What is her problem? What would you do? Do you think she has any of the above and how can I nudge her into a cure for some of these problems.

Thats quite worrying is it?  However 3 days ago, she had spottings.  I want to know if that meant that her egg was ready?   The spottings stopped immediately after one day [ the next day had abit of spottings only, much less then the first day]  I would also like to add that we had sex on the day she had spottings, but im guessing it would not affect the fact that her spottings stopped right? [ the spottings were found BEFORE sex]  Im just quite concerned about the availability of the egg in her body. thanks guys.

20090205094548AAlPoUV	Health;Mental Health	Why do parents make us feel like crap or have a way with guilt?	Im just upset with my father b/c he is making me feel so much guilt b/c the tenant below me is leaving. Im actually relieved they are leaving b/c they are heavy smokers and i live upstairs with two small children.  These people knew this was a smoke free complex but yet continued to smoke. They cut down but they still smoke heavily at night.  Its horrible.  But my father loved the fact they are clean and pay the rent and they have a history of staying for long time.  To make a long story short, we were all getting along until the tenants went on a trip and had their two sisters stay over. They smoked like chimneys and no matter how many times i called them to ask them to smoke outside they kept denying they were smoking. One day i lost my cool and told them off and my mother also called them and told them they woud have to leave if they didnt smoke outside.  When the tenant came back from her trip, she was so angry with me (for telling off her sister about the smoke) that she stopped talking to me and my parents.  Now a month later, they are moving out and i was actually quiete relieved.  But my father is upset with me blaming me for their departure and even made a comment that im the reason why people do not stay longer than two years in this place.  I was very hurt.  I have never bothered anyone untll now b/c of the serious smoking problem. Before that the other tenants left b/c they have families and bought homes.  I tried to explain to my father that people do not plan on living in an apartment forever and that most young people move out eventually.  I think its wrong that he blames me for people wanting to leave.  He's just upset that he has to keep renting out the place and putting money into it all the time.      What do you think i should do?  Ive offered to help out my parents by trying to find good people to live here. Im putting in ads and making calls.  Im even getting a lease kit for them b/c they dont speak good english and just let anyone live here.      What should i do about my father?  I feel so hurt by his nasty comments and i feel very belittled

20070412034256AAZydsP	Health;Dental	Apples & Acid?	When I was in highschool, I ate one apple every day after school during my junior year. This was the first time I ever got any cavitys. Apples are high in acidity. The acid in the apples are what gave me a few tiny cavitys. Sugars are not as bad for your teeth as you may have heard, I ate a lot of sugar as a kid, like cakes, brownies, bito honey, caramel, pecan pies and never had any cavitys. Acid from fruits like apples, oranges, peaches, nectarines, cherries, beverages with citric acids, hard candies like Jolly Ranchers are all fully loaded with acids.  Have you ever used mouth wash that burns your mouth? Well it is also good to use an old milk jug to fill with a bottle of mouth wash and add the other half water to make more of a flouride rinse rather then a concetrated alcohal burn.

20090204214207AAve6Xd	Health;Mental Health	Depression. OCD. I'm not sure anymore?	I have been suffering from, among other things, depression for at least three years. I'm young. I left school because half the time I couldn't make myself go, and when I did, I was a mess and ran off to cry in the bathrooms all the time. I can't face work. I can't face going to driving school. There's too much to fight on the inside - I don't have anything left to face people on the outside.  I don't want to drive, because I get the urge to run the car into a tree, but it's too unfair if someone's in the passenger seat. I'd like to step out in front of a car on a highway and see if I die, but cars obviously have drivers, and I don't want to cause anyone the stress of hitting and killing someone, even accidentally. Same with trains.     I keep going, and I keep myself sane, but I'm losing the will to do so. I've been suicidal. I have OCD and think about death compulsively. I see my doctor once every three weeks because I live so far away. I can't talk to my folks, for some reason they repulse me. It's sad because they've never done anything to elicit that response. Most of the time I'm miserable, tired, irritable, scared, bitter, angry and I know I can behave really neurotically - but I wouldn't do it if it didn't feel necessary. I feel wronged by the world, even though I guess I know I'm not.    These last few days, I've turned a corner. I'm blank, without feeling as relieved as I should. I'm restless, and strung out, like I was coming off of crysal meth or something, but I'm not. I'd rather be miserable and bitter and angry, because when I'm like that, at least I'm feeling something, and if I feel something, I can fight it. This moment, I can't think of anything I ever want to do again, and even existing seems too big an ask. But I don't want to hurt my family, and I know they'd be devastated if I killed myself. It's coming to the point where what's going on inside my head is too much - even though there isn't all that much, because I seem to have blocked it off - and I might just do something stupid. Right now I won't, but tonight, if it's as bad as last night, I don't know.     However killing myself seems all so melodramatic, even though often I don't feel I have any other choice. I'll think "well, it's only life, **** it, what harm can it do? I'll die one day anyway, so I might as well make the most of it for now." and yet for all this bravado, which feels genuine at the time, I can't make myself get up and go live. I doubt the legitimacy of my feelings a lot. I don't know if I'm unhappy or just acting.      Right. Cheers for listening, if you got this far. This isn't a question, I know, and what you say probably won't have any bearing on what I do. I'm just at a loss, and this is the best therapy I can manage right now. Have a good day.

20090205103147AAxEaGH	Health;Women's Health	What would cause me to spot AFTER my period?	Ok, here's the deal...My cycles last anywhere from 33-41 days. Last cycle it was a shorter one, but it was a "normal" period. It lasted the same amount of time as the others do. I have NEVER had any kind of spotting in between periods nor am I on any type of bc or any other meds. My period ended 6 days ago, and I mean completely ended. When I went to the restroom later on last night and wiped, I noticed my normal discharge had a brown tint to it. When I wiped again there was brown "spot" on the toilet paper. Wiped the third time and there was nothing but the normal dishcarge. I know that brown usually signifies old blood, but I was wondering what could've caused this 6 days after my period? As I said before, this hasn't ever happened to me before. I am a healthy 26 yr old. My husband and I did have sex last night, but it wasn't "rough" and it didnt hurt at all. There was plenty of lubrication so it didn't rub me raw or anything like that either. Also, I don't have any infections...I know this for sure. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks

I've always taken good care of my teeth  - the only thing that's changed is I've been drinking filtered water. I drink a lot of water, so this could have an impact if there is no flouride in the filtered water. Why is it supposed to be harmful, or do they just do it for the taste? I know there is a link to infertility and large amounts of flouride though I think infertility could be a good thing in our society. Anyway, could that make a difference, if flouride is filtered out?

20090205103643AA2GgcO	Health;Diet & Fitness	Why am I not losing weight?	I'm almost 16 years old and I weigh around 150 lbs and I'm 5"8. When I was younger I used to be stick thin and now I'm kind of chubby.   I really didn't eat healthy last year and I gained a lot of weight and now I want to lose it. I think I'm going about it the right way but nothings working!    I eat lightly, but regularly, I eat lots of fruits and vegetables, and I try to cut back on the junk food. I also play volleyball in school and out so I have 4-5 practices a week that are at least two hours long, so I get exercise.     How come I don't lose any weight? Am I doing something wrong/should I change something?

20090205111047AAQZGPO	Health;Mental Health	What is wrong with me am i normal?	i am 16 years old.      when i was little around 10 i was cute. people woudl stop and point at me and whisper awww and annoying stuff like that and although it made me uncomfortable i was still ok with my appearance most of the time.      when i turned 12 i becaem extremely unattractive pretty much overnight. and i still am i think that i am the most disgusting person alive. sometimes i feel ok about myself and then i pass a mirror and i want to kill myself and i want to die. i try to avoid any reflections of myself and when i see photographs of myself i sometimes start crying and imagine killing myself. when i am around people i feel very bad for them for having to look at me so i try to cover my face when they speak to me. i also wear hoodies to school and sometimes hats and wear them for as long as i can get away with it. when people look at me i feel ashamed and disgusting i feel this heavy feeling in my chest and i get kind of butterflies but not the same and feel like crying and dying at the same time. the other day in sociology class we were talkign about suicide among the french in the 1800s and how they found that it was more common among protestants than catholics, and she asked us if we knew why but no one did and she said that it was a sin in catholicism but not in protestantism. i dont know why but that made me feel a bit relieved since i am a protestant but i always feel so guilty and i just want to move to the desert without telling anyone and dying out there and when someone finds me, they obviously wont ever find the exact location of where i come from so no one would ever know. ever since i was little i have found the idea of a funeral quite embarrassing for me bcause its like forcing people to all gather around me, it would make everyone uncomfortable. i have read that cutting yourself in the bathtub is like falling asleep but i wouldnt be able to do that i dont think because someone would walk in and see it and it would be awful      anyaway i am sorry this is os long but i am just asking and i am just very lonely and emotional as i have no friends or a social life and people say that i am boring and mock me behind my back

I did have medicaid, but they knock me off when I turn 18. I believe their was a way for me to stay on medicaid by showing proof that I was in school and other documents but I was too lazy to do it. I have been in college for 3 years now and since then I have racked up a hospital bill of 8,000 from going to the emergency room. One bill was for 3500 for a ambulance coming and bringing me to the hospital for breathing problems. My thing is what can I do about this debt and How can I get rid of it. Don't tell me nothing about getting health insurance because I can't afford it nor can my mom. Don't know my dad and living on  campus. My mom have 5 other kids to take care of that's get medicaid so I'm not putting the strain on her to pay my medical bills nor get insurance for me. Trying working and going to school but didn't work because I was failing my classes. Classes or too expensive so I'm not going ot waste my precious time on some stupid mimunal wage job to fail school. I'm not a person who can do too things at once. My question is how can I do something about this debt besides getting a job.   I'm trying to get into medical school and me working and class is not an option unless I drop out of school and get a job, then it could work. If I do both I might as well drop out because my classes takes all my time out  and I would fell them.

After i started taking it (i'm on the 2nd day, so still on the 60mg til tomorrow) i read all the nasty side effects like moon face, weight gain, etc. Is this something I should worry about if i'm only on it for 8 days? Or are these side effects from long term use? Cause I'm really freaking out now and want to stop taking it (even though it has completely cured my sinus headache), but i know i can't as i must be weaned off.      I also have been experiencing a very achy back, achy legs, and arms since i started taking it...is 2 days enough to notice these sorts of things?

Hi everyone, I started felling this lump  probably 2 months ago tisnking it was nothing I ignored it..last month doing my breast exame I felt it again and just so I didnt think I was Imagining things I had my boyfriend AND ex husband feel for it.. (i know wierd ..) but they both felt it it was about the size say a little bigger than a quarter we all dismissed it scine I'm only 32 and maybe I was just wishful thinking it was nothing and would go away , so 3 days ago doing agin the monthly exame I felt it again but it seemed to be harder and a little bit bigger, I figured ok I better at least call DOC and see what see says. they scheduled me the next day the lump is kinda tender but i think only because i kept messing with it checking the area in hopes it would go away .. its not squishy its hard and dosent really have a boundery just kind of an area  when i press onit it dosent feel smooth it feels as if the surface of it on the inside is bumpy as well. yesterday and I went in and immidiately she felt it she didnt think they were cyst and she said possibly mice terminology for a bigger word i think means tumors?? but didnt seem totally convinced and the look on her face was not encouraging along with the fact she ordered BOTH a diagnostic mammogram and an ultrasound for early of next week which is rather fast usually a referal around her takes at least 2 weeks... so I'm nervous and wonder what more clues should i lookk for   to say that this lump may be cancer or just "mice" .any thoughts and advice is greatly appriciated! I cant even function today its all I keep thinking about!

What is it? am i allergic to something? is something biting me? they only appear after i wake up.

20090205103146AAoz0gt	Health;Mental Health	Why do I get these thoughts?	Bit of background information ... I am 17, female, and waiting for CBT for depression, though I'm not sure if this is relevant.      I was travelling down the motorway with my dad yesterday, and I kept imagining myself opening the car door and throwing myself out of the moving car in front of another car. Then I was thinking about what it would be like if I got seriously hurt for life.   I have thought about this several times, usually when travelling in a car.      The thing is, I don't want to kill myself. I just imagine it. It sounds awful, and I know it is disgusting, but I often fantasise about being badly hurt. I know this is very very wrong and that I should be greatful I am healthy, because lots of people suffer with things they don't want every day. But I still can't shake these thoughts off.   It's hard to explain, it's not that I am a self-harmer or anything, I don't like pain, I think I just crave the attention and it is very selfish of me. I haven't brought this up with my parents or doctor because it seems a bit petty.      Any advice on what I should do about this?

20090205105730AAeL2zs	Health;Other - Health	Why do I keep twitching like this?	A few months ago, I noticed that my leg would randomly twitch right before I fell asleep and it would wake me. It didn't happen every night, but frequently enough for me to realize what was going on.       Since, that has pretty much ceased, but seems to have been replaced with other twitches. The one that bugs me the most is the twitch in my middle finger on my right hand. It's really as if my finger is having a mini seizure and it's quite disturbing; not painful, but strange feeling.       My right thigh will also randomly twitch when I'm laying around watching TV or something. This isn't too disturbing. My right eye is disturbing, though. Frequently, it'll twitch non-stop and it drives me crazy.       There are other parts that have twitched as well, but only once or twice; not enough for me to take it into account.       What is causing this? I've noticed that from what I can remember, it's all the right side of my body. Is this something neurological? What would you suggest I do? I've read a little about Myoclonus and Benign Fasciculation Syndrome. I'm not sure that either of those quite fit what I'm feeling. Are there any others that it might be?

(she lies about the most retarted things)   and she said that its because of her acute paranoia. and that me and her family are the only people who know about her acute paranoia.

I live in Melbourne Australia and my doc said I am borderline diabetes and should lose weight (6.1 GI reading).      I contacted a few dieticians and some told me if I see the doc again I can go on a careplan where I get a rebate for seeing them each time up to maximum 5 times. The rebate is pretty good. With the rebate first visit is $15 and subsequent ones only cost $1.15.      I was 80kg when diagnosed borderline diabetes. I think my correct weight for my height of 175cm (5ft 8) and small build is about 68kg. Since the start of the year I've lost 5kg. The doctor said even being 72kg wouldn't be too bad.      The problem is I have to wait until 25 Feb to see the doc again to go on the care plan and take time off work to do it since a nurse has to be there who is only available during working weekdays.      My brother seemed to think I shouldn't bother and the doc said "I'ts not rocket science since everyone knows eating a wholemeal roll is better than a custard tart".      I'm in two minds. Should I cancel or not?

About 6 months ago I gave blood and got back a false positive or w/e that said I was flagged for HIV but got a note with it that said I did not actually have it.

I've never had unprotected sex or been exposed to any blood, although I have performed oral sex on a girl in the last year.  What scares me is that I hear sometimes it doesn't show up for 6 months through tests and last week I had an unexplained fever and a few days ago I developed a rash on my hands, elbows and a little bit on my feet. I went to a health center and they said that its just a viral rash and it will go away. I've also been a bit more achy than normal.

I have read many recommendations of Certain-Dri for hyperhydrosis and i used some and it seems to work pretty well. It burned a little, but people say that's the case if you use it right after bathing (I did) and my skin is pretty sensitive anyways.  But i guess my question stems more from the concerns i have heard about deodorant in general that say chemicals inside deodorant can be bad for you or raise chances for breast cancer in woman (and men in rare cases).  Do stronger deodorants like the "clinical strength" products pose a noteworthy threat to health, or are there certain existing conditions needed to be affected, or is it all just a bunch of bull jive?

I know that it was my roommate that did it.  Anyways, he put it on while my dick was limp, but when I woke up I had morning wood.  Because I got an erection, it made it impossible to get off.  And my erection wont go away because the finger trap is squeezing it so that the blood flow is constricted.  I can't masturbate to get rid of the erection either, because it chafes way too much.  What should I do!?!?

I stopped wetting the bed a bit late on when i was about 11, and would only do it like once a year but this week has made me quite worried as ive already wet the bed twice.       Recently ive started masturbating more regularly again as ive been a good few months without masturbating. Could this be a reason as to whats happened this week? Or is it more likely due to stress?       Or am i likely to have some sort of disease?       Please help me...       PS. Whenever i think about it too much before going to sleep i usually end up wetting the bed.

I was just curious as to what exactly in the soda lowers the density of your bones.  Im not sure if it is the carbonated water.... o the high amount of sugar in it.      I have also been drinking alot of Seltzer.....like club soda because all it is is carbonated soda, lemon flavored. no sugar, no calories. basically water. I figured its a much healthier substitute to drinking soda.  But if it is the Carbonated part of the soda that lowers the density of your bones, then there is no difference.

I went to the doctor and he described it as an anal fissure with a thrombosed hemorrhoid.      After a week of treatment with nefedepine ointment, hot sitz baths and stool softeners.. I was feeling MUCH better. Within 3 weeks it was no longer a problem.       Well, this time around... I had tried to pass somewhat of a large stool [sorry for the t.m.i] and began to have the symptoms again; the swelling between the anus and the vagina, the pain after a bowel movement and the discomfort. It has lasted almost 2 weeks and is not getting better or worse... it seems like it gets a little better and then is painful again after a BM.

Any Ideas?      could that happen even though its been 3 months since the surgery?         eww every here and there i hear it make a little gurgle noise.

It's not a yeast infection if it's only itchy around it, right? I also have odd sores there and on it...it may be from shaving, but idk...?      Also, is it normal for hair to grow between my breasts?

I just purchased a pair of oakley's polarized sunglasses and have found them to give me a slight headache, dizziness, and make some surfaces appear more reflective than normal. I thought polarized lenses reduced light's reflection? Also when closing one eye (looking only through one lens) my vision isn't as distorted. Is it possible Oakley sent a pair with different lenses (one without polarization or one or both lenses with prescription)? By the way, I also wear contact lenses, if this could have something to do with it?

My period was due yesterday and nothing. My husband and I used condoms and spermicide for extra backup. I will be 46 in June. Is this a sign of menopause? I would think chances of being pregnant are pretty slim with both methods being used at all times. Has anyone ever experienced this? My mom was about 46 when she started menopause. Thanks!
