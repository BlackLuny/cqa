DhEZj9cKaa	You should go with Lines|`|DD5Gsqx4aa	Line is the best brand all the way. Just look at all the features provided in the line Invader! 8 different features that make this ski a beast in the park: 4D fibercap, Butter Zones (greatest invention that will improve the way you butter tremendously), Carbon Ollieband (for extra pop onto rails higher than you think you can), Maple Macroblock Core (made of high quality, lightweight, long-lasting, durable wood), a fatty base and edge (to resist impact and add to the already incredible durability of the ski, and tune your ski many more times), center mount (you probably know what it is but just in case: the binding is mounted in the exact center of the ski, and the ski has equal length on both sides so you ride backwards and forwards the same way with the balance you desire), symmetric flex (enhancing the experience of riding backwards making it the same as riding forwards), and finally, symmetric geometry (which means the ski is the same shape in front and behind the boot, and speaking of geometry I have to to my homework and shouldn't even be on here but w/e). Overall this thing is a jib-monster. Take it on any c-rail, s-rail, rainbow rail, kink rail, box, table, kicker, wall ride, or any other feature you can think of. This ski will take a beating. Like literally you can take it to urban rails in parking lots and lank on concrete with the slightest amount of snow and the ski is so durable it wont be damaged. Its like the ski is saying "Jib everything in sight, please!!!" Its so light, too so its good for switch ups on rails and boxes so rather than doing your 180 on and a 360 off, you can do a 360 on, a switch up or two, and then your 360 off. Its also great for nose and tail presses. You name it, any trick and you'll be able to do it quicker because the ski is so much lighter. So definitely check out the invader. The best place to look would be here:  http://www.lineskis.com/product/invader  Good luck...have an epic season...  Also go to lineskis.com/home to check out the other models, like the chronic.   LOOK AT THE LINE CHRONIC AND THE LINE BLEND. BOTH ARE SICK FOR GROOMERS, PARK, AND PIPE.  DO NOT BUY AT RESORT!|`|FOtMIdGUaa	well i have no idea if buying  skis at resourts are cheaper because you go to a different ski resourt than me (probobly) but are you a begginer? have you freestyle skid before just without twins?? if your a total beginer i would buy a pair of good atomics maybe atomic urban punx    http://www.atomicsnow.com/us/home/produc...    but if you have skid park before just with average non twined skis and are confident with most things i'd go for the line invaders and a little higher up on the quality end would be line anthems if i were you i'd buy the line anthems 08 not the 09 there practically the same thing just some minor differences     http://www.lineskis.com/product/anthem  line anthems 09    http://www.lineskis.com/product/invader  line invaders 09    http://www.untracked.com/p2012c51b88lr-F...  line anthem 08|`|UZ8IcCwtaa	Line Invaders because they have butter zones and are simply amazing!
hz9kMoYSaa	Hello.  The factory DH is pretty grippy. However they are quite soft as a result, so they will wear out quite quick.  I would suggest maybe a Maxxis Highroller for the more DH / Trail riding or a Panaracer Cinder or Fire XC if you are after something with a little less drag ( more XC specific).  Give those a look up!|`|zILwtO22aa	I don't know that name, but here are some to compare with..    http://www.bikecare.co.uk/acc/cycle_tyre...    edit, had a look they seem to be OK...so..    http://www.allterraincycles.co.uk/produc...

Usually one person does not consent.     so you can punch someone in the face if they ask you to but if they don't want you to do it then it's a crime.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	I think it is still allowed in the Deep South because of antiquated laws.

jatsxY1Vaa	what do you expect? The team made HISTORY winning that superbowl. jealous....    PS. Besides, the steelers are becoming the new "america's team" Winning 6 superbowls. They have the most dedicated fans in the NFL. You don't have to make it a big deal because your team [cards] lost.|`|VH1ze729aa	Yeah they are idiots...in a way.  It seems somewhat reasonable if the Steelers lost but hey it's Pittsburgh. I guess that's what happens there???|`|6aNFkVSkaa	Actually there was 117 arrests|`|XwAtYZDBaa	No it doesn't.  If you want to see a lack of class see Morgantown after a big win, the city damn near gets destroyed|`|EhTEkynHaa	Go research the number of crimes in any city after winning a major sporting event.    If you're going to flame and bash a city and its people, at least have some good reason to. This is not a first by any means, and it sure as Hell won't be the last.    A "thug" is not someone going out and partying with their friends because they've won a championship. An "idiot" is not someone who is living their lives and celebrating what they support.    In my opinion, "lack of class" involves attacking or bashing others for how they act, and stereotyping the entire city and its people due to what such a small group have done.    Grow up and get over it.|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	See i hate when people act like their better than other people..ive seen riots after tennis games, but we don't  downgrade them as a people.    Im not condoning any behavior but i hate that we sit here and point the finger and act like we are HOLLI-ER than tho. Knowing if our team won the championship and we went to parade, we would be happy and going crazy, ( but not to that effect) and we all know that one apple spoils the whole bunch. So i gather it was 100 or so idiots surrounded by 5000 fans that makes it seem like all of six burgh are idiots and i just don't believe that..    Steeler fans have a history of representing the blue collar worker and i refuse to let a few tarnish that image.    Thank you|`|YupMCYHlaa	This happens every year.  I think these days police over-react, so most of those people arrested are let go almost immediately.  Football fans in general are uncouth and act like idiots. 8^)  It's not just Pittsburgh, it's the same everywhere.|`|r4J2sPHzaa	lol ur team must have never won a championship lol every teams fans celebrate after there team wins a championship when the redsox won it was the same out come its not just steelers fans|`|srIvu5PWaa	no they totally over estimated the number and that's not classless. it's not a stupid sorts championship for you guys down under it's liking winning the cricket championship. I'm from pittsburgh by the way|`|C2CCbTRKaa	IDIOTS,TAKE A PAGE FROM THE GIANT FANS LAST YEAR,NO PROBLEMS.|`|ABoo1doVaa	Let me tell you something about Pittsburgh fans. My mother couldn't tell you the difference between Kurt Warner or Ben Rothlesburger, but she was very upset that Pittsburgh won the championship, simply because she hates Steeler fans. She doesn't hate to many people on this earth, but she can't stand them. There are a lot of cool ones, as a matter of fact quite a few of my friends are Steeler fans, but there is no doubt that there are a ton of obnoxious, classless idiots.     It's ironic, because the Rooneys are probably the classiest owners the league has.
C2CCbTRKaa	YES IT DOES.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	No...it just proves that some people are idiots...    It happens whenever anyone wins a championship...every team has some idiot fans...|`|GsjH7lxjaa	at least they aren't as bad as the raiders fans =)|`|yE7Q8LCkaa	Do questions like this make you realize the lack of intelligence in the world and then make you wonder why you even wasted you time answering the question?|`|ba7bcd7412bbd21d6d0242a98604dfb6aa	Look at the team...it's all you have to do|`|XwAtYZDBaa	No, just because a few were buttholes doesn't mean every Steeler fan is a "thug".|`|jatsxY1Vaa	Wow, you panzys need to get off your computer and stop hating.     THEY SET A NFL RECORD THAT HAS NEVER BEEN BROKEN. ITS HISTORY    I can understand a blowout superbowl for maybe a 3rd superbowl win, then it would be lack of class. BUT how is a 6th superbowl [making history] WITH A FOURTH QUARTER COMEBACK IN LESS THAN 2 MINUTES BAD TO CELEBRATE. any team celebrates, stop hating cause the cards lost. my god|`|3yvuMkzTaa	every team that wins, has fans that riot. It's still wrong though!!!

hWaynBpMaa	God this sounds like a Man Utd supporters forum. it would havee been nice if you had your facts straight. Jo was purchased  before Hughes Arrived, he was Purchased by Gary Cook on behalf of Shinnies people. The Reason Hughes has loaned him to Everton is he needs to get used to the pace of the EPL, remember very few foreign players come in and do well the first season. Henry needed a year before he got a goal, Ronaldo could only make subs bench his first season. only a few like torres who plays at pace anyway have done well first year. but they are injury prone.   Hughes has done what Sven found it hard to do, Ie Beckam with england and Elano with City last season. when they are out of form he does not drop them. Elano had a great start last year but could not syring two passes together later on in the season, but Sven would not drop him. Hughes drops [players that are not performing and Elano is now starting to show the form that made city fands love him. and thats down to Hughes standing up to him and the other trouble makers. Ben Haim was one of them. Ben Haim was Hughes only bad purchase. and thats down to you had to judge the player on his form when he was at Bolton as he did not hardly start for Chelsea. and  all but one of his games for City he was very poor and his mistakes cost us in some crucial games.   Hughes has signed some great players Kompany, Zabaletta, Wright Philips have been outstanding. Bellamy, Dej ong, Bridge and Given will make the side more stable. and with Ireland being rejuvenated under Hughes and even Robinho coming more into line Hughes will have a good second half to the season. We even have Petrov soon to come back as well as Michael Johnson and Hopefully we will finally see the best from sick note Bejonov. with young talent like Evens and Sturidge stepping up and if he can get the fire back into Citys one let down this season Micah Richards. He has not been the same player since he got his new contract and Richard Dunne is making mistakes trying to do the work of two men. Joe Hart needs a bit more time thirty goals this season and all the ones last season, not good. So lets let Hughes build his team and not judge him on our away form. Stoke was not a bad result remember they beat Arsenal and held Liverpool home and away and they only had two attacks on citys goal and never left their goal after they scored. people talking about Mouriniho as a replacement but he wastes money like anything look at the flops he purchased at Chelsea he spent 500 Million on transfers. and look at Inter milan  he spent 20 million on the guy he has loaned to Chelsea. Hughes turned Wales into a good national team and Blackburn with no money he made them top 10 team every season. So lets give him 3 years so long as we are not fighting relegation next year give him the 3 yrs he says it will take to break the top four. look at the top five except four Chelsea all the others their managers built their teams over a period of time. so lets give Hughes the Chance. thanks|`|efGx6z3vaa	No, It si Derby County`s coach in the 2007/08 season|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	My thoughts would be that Hughes has no control over the transfers whatsoever. He couldn't have lost the plot that much from his Blackburn days, remember he did sign Roque Santa Cruz and done a great job with a mediocre team.    Even though im a Liverpool fan im a big admirer of Hughes as a manager and a player but he's been made to look like a fool by the city board.    I hate these f*cking ars*holes who buy clubs and then think they can sign any player they want because he has a name.|`|ceef93d1024d0e6a2e214650ffb17d50aa	I don't think he's the worst manager ever, although i do believe he is way in above his head at City. Face it, he is doing a terrible job. He can't look after the players he's got, he's scared to fine Robinho, he's buying too many players and will drive out his talented English players such as Johnson (who he refused to sell but is refusing to play) and Sturridge.Their youth system will be in tatters by the time he's finished.|`|456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	Not the worst ever but he is terrible.  For me (this will sound quite bias) it is Graeme Souness who singlehandedly destroyed Liverpool Football Club when he was manager.|`|AA12302228	bellamy knifed the great bobby robson in the back|`|exARv7Bmaa	He done OK with Blackburn and would have had them in a much higher spot than they're in now. I don't think he's suited at the Eastlands (who will be ?) and players are obviously going there with a much different attitude than they would going to any other club in the EPL. I still think Hughes has a lot to offer in mangement, but not at Manchester.|`|HxET88bDaa	No don't be silly...he didn't even sign Jo himself...he was signed before Hughes even went there and the same with Ben Haim. Bellemy is a knob but he is still a goal scorer, they were going for marque names like Kaka and Messi but they are not the type of players City needs..|`|mK06dus9aa	No, you are judging too soon. Jo arrived highly rated and has not delivered so far - a loan spell will give him the chance to regain form (possibly) without hurting City. Chelsea got Ben Haim on  a bosman and used him as a gap fill, City used him the same way and would have got him for peanuts. Elano has lost form and Bellamy was signed to give some aggression to the City attack.|`|XGOXmiEiaa	Personnally I think he was the best and the worst manger ever. Well maybe not the best but he was one of the very top at Blackburn. Yes I agree he has been terrible with Man City, even though he has unlimited spending. But you can't forget what he did to Blackburn, he made them a top side. As soon as he left Blackburn, down they go... Bit ironic how that works.. terrible with a rich club, fantastic with a decent team. But then again the last person to get best and worst job ratings within 8 years was....George Bush.....|`|uPLfqQPvaa	sounds bad to me|`|Pfq2zRejaa	yes he will send city down
6QhACK70aa	Adamek a close but clear maybe majority or UD ;)|`|SR5zlAl8aa	pick me for best answer i dont have alot of points no not really|`|DFshzoJkaa	BJ Flores already REFUSED to fight Adamek.  He also REFUSED to fight serious competition in Matt Godfrey and Wayne Braithwaite.    BJ is one of those fighters who's completely happy with fighting obscure guys with losing records.  Obviously, BJ (or his manager) is not confident with his fighting abilities... cuz if he was, he woulda fought those guys last year.   Most fighters would KILL for the chance to fight those guys, just to prove themselves.  But since BJ has been going the distance with bums, then he's probably right in truning down Adamek, Godfrey and Braithwaite.  And I seen BJ's girlfriend.  Shes a HOTTIE!  BJ should give up boxing, get a 9-5 and stay home with her!!!

RqP8j5DMaa	The more money you invest in a board will ultimately determine the quality of board your gonna be getting.  My board was around $480 and lots will consider it a mid-range board.  Once you've been riding for a while and try out different boards, you will gain a set of preferences. Every board has a different feel, you'll want to look at weight, flex pattern, is it a twin tip, or directional or tapered. If you only like riding deep powder or back country you'll want a board with taper. True twin shaped boards are more park and freestyle oriented and make balance and spins much easier. The type of base for example will determine how fast you can go. Different cores, depending on your style of riding. For example if you like riding park, you'll want a nice beefy but flexible core to take rail hits. Softer flex will help with butters and is usually preferred over something very stiff, its nice to have good balance of flex as it also provides pop for ollies and jumps. Also the core can have a negative, zero, or positive core which is the way the board is bent. A board with positive camber or rocker is good for powder, but also helps with butters and landing and makes for a good all around board. A sintered base is more porous and will absorb more wax, and after many days on the hill and repeated waxing's, it will build up to a much faster base and you won't ever get stuck on flat sections of the hill such as long cat tracks, and you usually wont find a sintered base in cheaper snowboards. You definitely get what you pay for. Personally I wouldn't even consider a $50 snowboard. Try and find something around $300+ and you'll have yourself a fairly reliable snowboard. Brands like Capita ,Burton, Rome, Step child, Forum, etc. make very good boards and would make a good investment.|`|939307a82ae025e53a21c0a641378b87aa	-Isolated Flex  -Dampering  -Stiffness  -Durability  -Side-cut  -core    All these things play into it.  A $250 board is still a cheap board.  Once you get better you can pick and choose which board works best.|`|jTaW3goeaa	Personally, I've never seen a good board with a list price of 50 dollars.  The higher quality boards are going to cost more, and there is a difference... I have aprofessional series free ride board, and on the days that its real icy and ungroomed I use my old junk boards and there is a huge difference in how the ride is, and its not just because of the snow conditions I have used the cheaper boards on good days when I had a binding strap break.    And as was already said, 250 bucks is not that much for a board.  My pro board cost 550 bucks, it probably would have been a few hundred more for a Burton.  You as a beginner probably aren't going to feel a huge difference between the more expensive boards and the cheaper boards.  But 250 is  not that much for a board, I wouldn't buy a 50 dollar board, especially if it were coming from Walmart, Target, etc or huge sporting good chains.  You need to go to a ski/snowboard store that specializes in this equipment and buy a good board.|`|wvJmLgKxaa	Don't even bother with a $50, a $250 is not a high end snowboard either. My board costs $500, Shell out for a decent $300 - $400 board and you would be good. You may find boards such as lamar, marrow, ltd, kemper... those are cheaper boards and not decent ones. Look at boards such as  K2  Rome  Ride  DC  Capita  burton|`|mperjS8caa	These are some of the factors that make boards more expensive:    -Lightweight  - Stiffness  - Amount of flex  - Amount of pop  - The core of the board    These are the main factors  Some great boards include forum, ride, and atomic  (burton seem good, but they are actually garbage man)

They also entertain more than other teams. Having what 6 or 7 Fourth quarter combacks inside 3 minutes is amazing and very entertaining no matter who is watching.

The Steelers are not "America's Team" either, because the Steelers are the Steelers, 2009 Super Bowl Champs -- nothing more, and nothing less.    Please!  NO pro football team has any claim to a title that makes them inherrently superior to the rest of the league, much less one that somehow qualifies them to represent an entire nation.|`|KNTofuxMaa	As a Cowboy fan, I say, you can have the name.

A grip with the V's pointing to the chin or to the left of the chin would be considered very weak. Most players start with the V's pointing between the chin and shoulder and adjust from there.

4UilmYwKaa	The best story of the 2008 season has to be the Tampa Bay Rays.    Going from last place to the World Series.

The kid is phenomenal. He's going to be something special for years to come. It's too bad he's playing for the wrong team.|`|nxymxSUFaa	Actually when one looks at the eventual ending to what was an amazing season, one must look at the team that no one gave a snowballs chance in hell of winning it all.  That would be the Philadelphia Phillies world championship.    All season the main stories were concerning the failure of the Yankees, the aging Red Sox and the upstart Tampa Bay Rays.    The focus eventually fell on Manny being Manny and Joe Torre finding a soft place to land in LA.      On the East coast it was, "What is wrong with the Mets"?  The media couldn't write excuses fast enough about how the Mets couldn't do this and couldn't do that!  It was sickening.    Through it all there were the Phillies quietly putting all the pieces together winning the division as the Mets once again went south for the winter, then winning the pennants over Manny being Manny and finally puttting the Rays in their place!    This was by far the best story of the 2008 season.|`|P1bO87l1aa	It has to be the Tampa Bay Rays cinderella story.|`|c03fc4c1b513dca7edce30261069af11aa	My most memorable of 08 was going to a Birds on the Bat game with my 9 year-old son and catching a HR ball with my bare hands. my thumb still hurts,next time I'll have my glove.

Great story in my opinion|`|YG8fQa3naa	It was definitely baseball's former punch line the Tampa Bay Rays making the World Series. For a team that had never won more than 70 games since 2001 and only finished better than last in their division once to win 97 games and win a pennant against a good Red Sox and Yankees team, it's amazing and is obviously the best story of 2008 and I'm looking forward to see what they do in 2009.|`|3cd675f8a0783955763670d5ea211808aa	Without a doubt, it was the thunderous ovation that Willie Randolph received during the pre-game ceremonies before the last game at Yankee Stadium. Even though he spend four and a half years with the other team in New York, he will always be a Yankee. He really brought the house down that night, and it was great when he slid into second when he came out of the dugout.    Willie was unfairly blamed for the Mets' collapse in 2007, when it was actually a bunch of heartless players like Jose Reyes, who sulks when things don't go his way and who basically quit playing that year. I was glad to see the Mets collapse again last year under Manuel. It let everyone see that it was not Willie's fault, and that he was only playing with the hand he was dealt by Omar Minaya, a GM who is in way over his head.|`|c6q3EERdaa	The Rays by far.

Wjp0niEhaa	I think a new book about tennis should have a section about new racquet and string technologies, and how to choose them based on skill level and stroke mechanics.  Many racquets "recommend" NTRP levels for certain racquets, and I disagree with these generalizations. Injury prevention or treatment should also be included.  Tennis elbow, joint problems, etc.  are problems for most recreational tennis players, but there aren't too many books that explore this thoroughly enough.  Alternative medicine like acupuncture is not discussed anywhere in western literature.  Strength training should be outlined as preventive measures against tennis specific injuries.  Supplements like Glucosamine and Chondroitin help joint heath.  And then a shoe discussion would be good.  You might even get a little monetary help from shoe companies to help sell their flagship tennis shoes!  Just my two cents... Good luck!|`|310f7146b3101da08aa2bdb5a60a1829aa	I believe that officials should lower the temperature at which players can still play.  To be playing in such high heat is very very dangerous for their health and i think it crazy to subject players to these dangerous conditions.  A runner's muscles melted from overheating and he never fully recovered.

0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	they sure did, millions of people know it.  The only ones Ive ran into so far that said the game was fairly called were Steelers fans.  Stunner. Its a shame because they do have SOME great fans on here an these idiot ones are ruining it by saying "get over it", "let it go", "quit crying" "your a sore loser".  They will have to defend themselves for years now because people have witnessed how they "won" their last 2.  Thats about the only good thing to come out of this.  I said it yesterday.......its kinda like the Barry Bonds being the home run king thing.  People dont think he is the real HR king.  Well guess what, people dont think Pittsburgh actually has 6 Super Bowls either.  If it was just a few people, why was it front page news on Yahoo, Espn, Foxsports, Cbssportsline etc about the officials.  Remember though, were just "crying".  Just a few million of us "crying" about it.|`|eC9RmuAyaa	The NFL league office said that the play was called correctly, it WAS a fumble.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	It was a fumble.

The refs got it right.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	whaaaaahhhh....it was a fumble...the arm wasn't going forward when the ball came out...

Maybe, you could go through college, study to be a referee for about 20 years, ref about 10 years of NFL, then watch the replay. it was a fumble.

WHY WOULD THE REF'S GIVE THE STEELERS A SAFETY OFF OF A HOLDING CALL WHEN THEY COULD HAVE VERY EASILY LET IT GO?|`|c17x6L4baa	Maybe.  the ball was knocked loose when he was not moving forward  he did have it in his palm when he pushed it forward like a tip-in in basketball  in basketball a tip-in is a basket  he did not have four fingers and a thumb around the ball long pass control  he did put it in exactly the spot he wanted it to go  whether it should have been one or the other, i will not say because of my bias  a complete review should've been done instead of a quick look at the replay  would it have been overturned or found not conclusive enough to over-rule  i don't know.  there were a lot of worse calls and non-calls both ways  it should have gotten a COMPLETE review instead of a cursury look at the tv replay.   i think the steelers got the benefit of a lot more of the screw-ups|`|1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	I thought they reviewed and reversed the call.|`|yE7Q8LCkaa	Why are the cards fans not complaining about the refs going against Pitt on the safety, or the Ben rush for a TD attempt? There is no conspiracy for the town of Pittsburgh people!  Now for the question at hand;  LOOK AT THE NOSE OF THE BALL WHEN THE BALL WAS ENGAGED!  Was the elbow started forward? Yes  The wrist had not yet snapped nor was the hand/wrist moving forward to begin a pass motion (it was still moving backwards in fact) so the ARM was not moving forward when it was dislodged, just the elbow  Also, the 'front' nose of the ball was facing the ground as it does when a QB holds the ball looking for a receiver when the loss of control began = fumble. Had it been facing fwd as it does once the wrist snaps to begin a pass, then it would be ruled an incomplete pass. The review team had 60 seconds to determine if they should review the call: change of possession time and penalty discussion and penalty enforcement. They saw by rule this was clearly a fumble. The replay booth is quick on stopping the game. As was seen by their call to review the Holmes catch.  Now why Pittsburgh didn't challenge Fitzgeralds first TD? I do not know. My TiVO replay shows the ball being dislodged when Larry hit the ground. Watch it yourself and answer the question; why did the ball end up in Fitzgeralds thighs when he landed with the ball near his helmet. Get a good resolution replay and you'll notice the ball is knocked free when he lands (and did not have nor maintain control of the ball). Fitzgerald then grabs the ball which ended up at his thighs as he jumps up to 'celebrate' what should have been an incomplete pass!! (but I won $ on my will Larry score 2 TDs bet so Im sorta happy it wasnt challenged)  One last note. Why was Fitzgerald not penalized as he ran for 45 yards out of bounds to catch Harrison on that 100yd INT return? This non-penalty call was fine by me as he ran into his own teammate (not part of this particular play) while out of bounds. This teammate illegally entered the out of bounds white zone that slowed Larry down. Thats 2 missed penalties called on the Cards which negated each other because they were detrimental to their team for that play (and nobody ever really gets a penalty called for stepping into the white zone unless they interfere with a ref)    so Ariz benefits by the lack of penalties on the INT runback, the review of Ben's TD attempt, the correct call on Kurt's first fumble which was corrected to be an incomplete pass, the safety penalty but the losing team still complains. I'm jaded, so let's hear what non-jaded fans are saying. Is there a referee conspiracy/hoax?       -The Six-burgh Stillers|`|zqPjdhgKaa	If Warner's fumble wasn't a fumble, then Roethlisberger scored a touchdown in the first drive of the game.  I can argue and complain Roethlisberger had the ball in for a touchdown and should have gotten that touchdown.  Only a milimeter of the ball has to touch the line in order for it to be considered a touchdown.  I think that is a possibility.    The play was reviewed upstairs for at least a minute and thirty seconds so it had plenty of time to be reviewed.  It was a fumble.  His arm didn't start going forward until after he was hit and he did not have possession of the ball.  Anyways, even if it was an incomplete pass it is highly unlikely they would have scored a touchdown at around the 50 yard line after the penalty for the helmet incident on the Steelers with 5 seconds left.  Arizona had a chance to stop the Steelers score their game winning touchdown.  You should be blaming their loss on that and not on the refs.  Arizona played a great game and I have high respect for Warner as I am a St. Louisan and St. Louis is my second favorite team, but they lost their own game.|`|aCZ1EeZ9aa	That was no fumble.

739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	The only drivers that count towards your 9  uses are the ones you actually play.  The ones on the bench are really only there if you want to change your mind before the green flag flies.  After qualifying you can only change the drivers around if they are on the bench.  Once the race starts you can't touch any of them at all.  You lay it you play it.     BUT....if one of your drivers are in play or even on the bench and they make the pole you still get credit for the extra 10 points no matter what.  If you need more help shoot me an email and maybe I can help ya.     I think we are on the same leagues....good luck to you!|`|PGlZn1wEaa	Give me a yell if you need some help little lady..

A Driver on the Bench to my knowledge does not get counted in as a contender unless it's 1 of the 4 main drivers.    You get points for where your driver Qualifies and and for he finishes. So a DNF you know is gonna break those points up.     Like you stated 1 Driver - 9 races each. So you gotta keep them scattered about.     2 Drivers From List A  4 Drivers From List B  2 Drivers From List C    Hope this Helped.   The Changed alot from 2008 to 2009. So even though it's my 3rd year... I'm still new to this. Good Luck Lynn!

In the past, there were no dominant players besides him on the team, and I can say if Pau Gasol were traded 3 or 4 years ago to the Lakers, Kobe wouldn't have scored 81 points, 27 40+point games in a season, and 10 50+point games in 2006-07. I mean, he can still average high ppg per game up to 40ppg, but as Pau and Bynum are good scorers in the team, thats going to make i difficult for him, he would like to get more pass more.|`|ExVTrokAaa	when did MJ score 81 pts.

xKXu0Qb2aa	The FUTURE is BACK!      Anyway Chris - I doubt it.  I'd Love to see it happen though.  But Wouldn't that have COMPLETELY destroy the Entire Retirement Storyline from last Year?    I see it being more of a Ric in the Corner of Whoever Y2J faces at 'Mania.  Or Possibly Flair as a Special Guest Referee.  That would probably be the most Likely.    But Ric is Sure to be Involved at the 25th Anniversary somehow.      *EDIT* - Thank You Chris , I Appreciate That.  And Yes , I know it's nice to have me back. (Joke).  I WILL Resume my Mission of Entertaining the Y!A WS Universe.  I'm taking Down the Clown as  1 Comedy User in the WS.  Clown - It is ON! (maybe).      *EDIT* - Yes , Chris , I am a Funny , Funny Man.  BTW - What in the Bluest of Blue Hell's are you doing Jacking My SignOff?  "The Future LEGEND of Pro Wrestling has spoken"?  Now that's just Not Right.  DAMNIT , Now I have to Fight the Clown in Bringing the Funny & I have to Fight YOU for Jacking MY Line.    The Savior has Too many Battles to Fight.......    *EDIT* - Well Chris , it's also One Thing to ACTUALLY be Doing it (as I AM) , and a Complete Other to SAY You're Going to do it in the Future & keep adding Words like Legend & Epitome to Someone ELSE's Line.  That My Pennslyvanian Friend -  is Gimmick Infringement.  And I will NOT Stand For That.    And you go right on ahead & be a "Legend" , I , Shall be an ICON.

Because Sometimes , It's Hell Getting to WrestleMania......|`|8sGbSBOWaa	It could happen, because the WWE never honors its word on anything. I mean retired means retired but it never lasts.  I would have no problem with Flair wrestling for someone else, but he should NOT wrestle again for the WWE.|`|TPSp04gSaa	no|`|rH3ylNuYaa	what the hell I thought that old jealous basturd with more lose skin than a sharpe puppy who got his *** kicked by his daughter's boyfriend retired and now he is coming back.|`|JiCfYfLraa	JERICHO WOULD OWN HIM NOBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT MATCH. but the wwe is pathetic  if that match does happen jericho will lose because flair is a legend and they feel sorry for him. jericho is being dogged out now he is like one of the best wrestlers and is being used like a stepping stone for other superstars. jericho is the first ever undisputed champion and he deserves to win it again. the wwe makes jericho look so weak we all know that if jericho was the REAL jericho like how everybody knows him he would dominate the whole raw roster including john cena.|`|6E16tR6xaa	Mm. No. Or I definately hope not. I know it would be a great match. But if Ric Flair comes back for WM 25 he's pulling a Brett Favre. Why can't Flair just retire? Of course I'm glad to see him on RAW for one week, but wrestling again? No, I can't believe that can happen nor WWE would do that. If there going to have Jericho wrestle a celebrity at least have him wrestle someone whose not an actor or will be 60 later this month. I'm sorry I love the Nature Boy just as much as the next guy, but I do not want to see him wrestle, nor do I think he will.|`|AA10731562	There is a great chance cause yesterday he was calling ric abad stuff. I am pretty sure there is gonna be that match at wrestlemania unless he wins the elimination cahamber match. then he'll be vs. randy.hope i helped!|`|IMQm9JTMaa	I think it's very possible. Because i saw a Mickie Rourke interview and he said that he wouldn't wanna interfear with the WWE's buisness, cause it's not his place to be. So they were trying to cover up quick.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Well Jericho There Is a chance that that match will happen but Don't you think Ric Flair should go back to retirement.The winner of the match could be you or Ric Flair.To live and die is right there is no limited in what age you supposed to wrestle You Have to Wrestle Until you die That is the Purpose For this company,to fight.We all know Ric Flair is famous for many other reason. But I think someone should make a different match instead of a Single Match    Like Hell in a Sell Or Ladder Match or the greatest a Last Man Standing.Yep like these matches are good and very interesting to prevent the crowd from plugging in to SILENT no we want excitement   Entertainment WWE stand for.Too Bad for Mr.McMahon that got kicked in the head.Well Chris These are Some O f my Idea About Our old Pal Flair  he funny thing about this whole fude between Y2J and Flair is that Ric sort of let the cat out of thebag about a week ago. Ths site had an interview up i which he clearly states he'll be preforming at wrestlemania. I figured the WWE wouldn't go through with the whole Y2J/Rourke fude because WWE's official response to the movie was "while they respected his work the film dipects actions taken by past their prime wrestles at independent wrestling promoations. They are not world renouned like WWE" Sounds like a diss to me.    Flair will go through with wrestlemania to secure a spot on the WWE roster for his son Ried and also to get one more time to shine on the big stage..        I really don't care either way about this feud. I kind of figured that although Flair lost the retirement match that he would be back but I didn't think he'd come back so soon(a year later)but since he is getting old, might as well milk him for all he's worth.    Jericho really didn't seem to have anything for him to do at WM anyways, so at least if this happens it will be a hyped feud. The match will probably be as good(or bad depending on who you talk too)as the HBK/Flair match, maybe a little better since Jericho is a good heel, but it won't have the same "sentiments" around it. But I guess there will still be hype since it's Flair's return match. I can only hope Jericho destroys him and countinues down the path his going(as a ruthless heel).     I just find his whole "retirement" angle almost to be worthless if he's coming back and wrestling already. He is old, has had a great run, and should stay out of the ring. Allow him to come back and maybe mentor someone for Jericho to fight against, but don't let him be involved. Either way I don't care about the match since I find Flair boring to watch and listen to.|`|ayFd2u7naa	I think it is still going to be Jericho vs Rourke they just reset the angle and took all the heat off of Rourke for the Oscars watch in about a month you will see! They are going to let Jericho and Ric Flair do all the talking and build up! Plus Ric has said on countless occasions that he does not want to wrestle anymore. He is just there to do all the talking so that Rourke does not stick his foot in his mouth!

Boris Diaw: barely hear of him anymnore, and inconsistent    Yes, it's not hard to beat the Suns when they are offensively oriented.Also, if Kobe was so great, why did it take 7 games to beat a team that doesn't defend (which he didn't even do)? Why even buzzer beaters? If Kobe was so great, he should've handled them easily.|`|PFvIOJ8Kaa	They say he choked in game 7 because in the 2nd half he played less than 5 minutes, and was below 30% FG.

jHqV6yUxaa	These guys are so evenly matched that it is so tough to pick a winner. I can't honestly make up my mind about this fight. You can make strong arguments about each of the two fighters winning this fight, but I don't see any of the two beating or outclassing the other.     My prediction will be Monzon by SD, but my prediction is a little biased.|`|Q1MI6L96aa	Monzon avoided Hagler and for a good reason...you can't outfight age, Hagler by solid decision, going 15 rounds.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Hagler got better with years and experience, Monzon never trained well and smoked and drank, and chased women. (not that that is all bad)  If Monzon could train hard enough to be active the entire 15 rounds he could win a decision, but if Hagler pressured him he would wear down Monzon and win.|`|6QhACK70aa	MONZON UD i think cause of experience  i have make a great question about  8 dream fights why u always avoid answer my questions man?    so u telling me this has to do with cage fighters???  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|I1w0HfQbaa	I think if they fought when Hagler was just about to reach his peak and Monzon was already 35 years of age I say Hagler wins this fight in a changing of the guard. Yes, it is true that Hagler did lose some fights early in his career but having only two defeats out of forty contests is a phenomenal record. Hagler would be ready for Monzon in this fight. Although Hagler is still green he takes Monzon in this fight. This is just like De La Hoya-Chavez I where the young lion takes the old lion.     Monzon wins the early rounds of this fight but Hagler should begin finding his groove by the middle rounds and gradually wears Monzon down as the fight progresses. Hagler takes the final rounds--the championship rounds--and wins and guts out a hard-fought and unanimous decision.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Thumbs up to Peter H but I disagree, I always thought Hagler would have been  too much for Monzon.  It would have been a spectacular fight but Hagler would have been the aggressor from bell to bell for the whole 15 rounds.  Marvin would have edged Monzon, much like he did Duran.    Hagler by decision.|`|dh48AkbCaa	in 1978, i think hagler might have just enough to win a close one.|`|cqRBSDzvaa	Hagler was a beast.I say Hagler knocks him out in 7|`|ElH6jMEXaa	If its 1978, Hagler would have been too green for Monzon - remember Hagler was beaten early in his career, they were tough fights, but against guys not nearly at Monzon's level - even at 35.    Hagler's superior physical gifts would make it competitive, but Monzon takes it by a close but very clear decision.|`|L1QldjDuaa	MARVIN " MARVELOUS " HAGLER WAS THE GREATEST NO DOUBT!!!!|`|sBdOzbx5aa	Hagler would be too much dog.   Straight bum rush him like Hearns,  knock out.|`|7dfrPX7Eaa	in the ages you just mentioned, monzon would have probably won by UD because of experience. but if we talk about them fighting each other in their prime, that would of probably be "fight of the century". it would be back and forth action, non stop, neither fighter going anywhere. a fight between the two greatest middleweights, and two of the toughest son of a b****s in boxing history, who wouldn't watch that?

I Guess WWE feels the need for a role like that since they are trying to push another wrestler similarly to Snitsky. Mike Knox can wrestle, he actually is a talented big guy but WWE doesn't let him show his talent much.

BENGALS - Paul Brown chose this nickname for Cincinnatis 1968 AFL expansion team because there had been earlier football teams in the city called the Bengals. The elder Bengals were members of the AFL in 1937, competed as an independent club in 1938, then played in a new AFL from 1939-41 before the league again folded|`|gzRZlfpLaa	i dont know, why is they?|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Usually team names are picked out of a fan poll-I know that's how the Dolphins got their name.

The rest I don't know.  Good question.|`|WEi0Gr0yaa	Because that's the name of the team but instead of saying the Whole name it's just the "Broncos" or what ever the team is called.

dtZiXpqNaa	lacrosse|`|264GS7s7aa	any sport is very difficult to take up if you have not been very athletic in the past.  I assume you do not want to live in your brother's shadow, so if I were you, I wouldn't want to play a sport he already plays in.  Try a sport that you enjoy and are passionate about.  Sports like tennis, swimming, running and, softball are all good because they are pretty easy to take to.  I would take up your parent's offer for the tennis tutor because not many people have the great opportunity to really excel in the sport.  By getting someone to teach you the sport, you can learn it faster.  Tennis is not gay, it is a great sport and takes a lot of work.  It doesn't require someone to be like, really aggressive with other people so it is great for first-time athlete.|`|SNb7rZEPaa	girls wrestling|`|SDfvVhocaa	No, you do want to play tennis, players like Maria Sharapova that maybe you can relate to, have become some of the world best athletes.

Good Luck|`|zLUQJxJkaa	First of all, learn to type correctly.   You won't learn TKD right away, it takes a long time. Any martial art takes time (a lifetime).  A correct pushup (the normal one, there are some variations) is you have hands shoulder width apart, body straight, toes keeping your lower body up. Go down, pushing your elbows either out away from your ribs or back towards your waist, keeping your body straight. Go down until your nose touches the floor, then go back up. Keep your butt straight with the rest of your body.  Sit ups can be done a couple of different ways too. Feet pointed straight a shoulder width apart, calf to thigh should be a 45 degree angle. Back should be flat, arms across your chest. Pull yourself up until your chin touches your knees and go back down so that the back of your head touches the ground.  Jumping jacks are obvious..
HuHmOIk7aa	Well, I am a cross country runner, and even though we run in the fall it can get very cold! I run in several layers, and the most important thing to wear is under armor or something like it. It helps me a lot, I hope it will for you too!|`|4gZYucHMaa	I don't do fancy smancy outfits either and I'm a beginner runner of 10 months and still going out in -20 celcius weather, no excuses ...I just wear a cotton long sleeve and fleece pants, infact their my husbands comfy pants!    I did invest in a good coat--I got it at Canadian Tire(not sure where you are) but it is fleece lined interior and the outer shell is waterproof, nothing brand name but it's effective!    Then I cover my head with a hat and get out fleece gloves and I'm good to go...most of the stuff is either from the dollar store, walmart.    I don't do the layering thing, I find it awkward and bulky for running and I heat up really quickly....I was out this morning and it was -16 celcius and I was warm within minutes.  I find it quite refreshing!|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Wicker sweaters? That would make running nearly impossible. You mean fleeced-lined sweats. Layer clothes works best...even for cyclists.|`|pzYWa1hJaa	it depends on what you already wear and how cold temperature wise.|`|ErHoyWvZaa	1 good thing you can do is put a scarf over your mouth and nose so the cold air wont hit you  while you run  cold air can make breathing harder|`|haAtwu3iaa	Thick sweat pants, Socks, shirt/hoodie, Running shoes, scarf, hat.  BUNDLE UP!|`|B6qNBC4Daa	put tall socks on your arms and you can roll them down as you get hotter.
1d627596e14caafeacfad98d799d9a7caa	Yeah so what is the question?|`|Gfl447rqaa	ive never made a mistake in my life|`|5MtNumoSaa	I don't think any of the 3 answers you received were "brutal" by any means.  Acyually 2 of them sort of figured out what you meant to say, and the other simply informed you that it is impossible for a relief pitcher to pitch a no hitter.    And while that is the most famopus example of a no hitter in which more than one pitcher was used, there are others.  -   NL -   1991 Braves - Mercker, Wohlers, and Pena - 9/11 (vs. Padres)  2003 Astros - Oswalt,Munro,Saarloos, Lidge,Dorel, Wagner - 6/11 - vs. Yankees (Oswalt left due to injury)  AL -   1967 - Orioles - Barber,Miller - 4/30 - vs. Tigers  1975 A's - Blue, Abbott, Lindblad, Fingers - 9/28 - vs. Angels  1990 Angels - Langston, Witt - 4/11 - vs. Mariners  1991 Orioles - Milacki, Flanagan, Williamson,Olsen        And, actually I did  think I made a mistake once, but it turned out I was mistaken.    Have a good night.

Ar5VHDiBaa	close your eyes & swing|`|d4V3t3Rtaa	Start preparing now. Hit the batting cages; either get someone to throw to you or use a pitching machine (if you need to, start a machine at slower speeds and gradually increase the speed of the machine until you're hitting pitches that are as fast as the pitchers you face). Use a tee and soft toss to build up good swing habits. If you already know your coach, ask him for some drills you can do to improve. It's not going to come all at once, but progress is the key.    Bottom line: Don't be afraid to strike out. As long as you're being aggressive at the plate and swinging at good pitches, good things will happen. It's much worse to strike out without taking the bat off your shoulder.
knzw6u0Qaa	In my opinion, I agree with you as well. Bill Belichick will find a way to get back into the superbowl this year ( They should have gone or atleast should have been in the playoffs). The patriots are a really great team. My prediction is gonna be New England Patroits vs Washington Redskins. Patriots win.    And to all the ppl that say Patriots are cheaters, you are wrong. That year they wanted to murder everyone when they went undeafeated untill the superbowl just to prove they were not cheaters.|`|4X7oL14Haa	Saints and Colts   Saints win 35-28|`|GypHjedtaa	Eagles vs. Pats    Eagles win|`|WUzCpuC5aa	TO EARLY TO TELL|`|X7O0Uxqxaa	Giants beat the Colts 27-24.|`|YTasscmKaa	Its gonna be Jets vs Cardinals.|`|VjAoRpIhaa	panthers against patiots panthers win|`|zy9XbvSraa	wow, the season just ended wait til the off season, the season hasn't even started|`|d9755b1afe952617603d01f2e4c6acb1aa	49ers vs Steelers|`|YCwmCDkUaa	Steelers v Giants|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	someone against the falcons the falcons win it|`|jatsxY1Vaa	Steelers v Patriots|`|fdgslflIaa	Saints defeat Titans 24-20|`|72b1b35e81e7d39e237e18972e90ad30aa	mark my words....cardinals and warner take a page from the buffalo bills and go no huddle next year with that awesome offense.The best defense didn't have a answer for there no huddle..That coaching staff will pick up on that...They will draft more defensive help and this team will start a run at super bowls ala the buffalo bills...    afc...pats colts steelers....chargers..maybe..who else?..nobody|`|qCWin81saa	packers vs dolphins with the packers winning!!!!!!!!!!!|`|KqXra3qFaa	Eagles vs. Cardinals    Eagles win! lol|`|QKfa1tYSaa	Chargers will beat the Panthers 27-23|`|EmDdHBvEaa	saints and ravens|`|3TPrzLQtaa	i think the patriots are garbage without brady...but i think the eagle will make it along with the colts...hard to say that seeing i am a bears fan|`|78rASDJiaa	Hmm about all the teams suck    Giants - They only won the super bowl because of the lucky catch by Tyree  Patriots - Cheaters never prosper.

You could also get yourself an Indo-Board. This is good training for all sorts of board sports and will also increase your leg strength.    Check out http://www.indoboard.com/ ...

FtkoBEVpaa	1.  Sam Bradford, QB, Oklahoma  2.  Bryan Bulaga, OT, Iowa  3.  Everson Griffin, DE, USC  4.  Carlos Dunlap, DE, Florida  5.  Arrelious Benn, WR, Illinois|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Mark Sanchez, QB, USC 63 225lbs.  Unproven was the stigma attached to the Southern California starter by the college football pundits preseason claiming that he was nothing more than a highly recruited benchwarmer. Ditto for Matt Cassel until his number was called this season in New England and similarly with the departure of John David Booty, Sanchez has made the most of his opportunity in working with Coach Pete Carroll. A high football IQ and learning under the tutelage of some of the best instructors that the game has to offer in a pro system make Sanchez worthy of his high ranking. His arm strength is phenomenal and may only be surpassed by his GPS-like accuracy. Both of these attributes have been proven to be top notch as he has displayed in nearly every game this season, so perhaps the only lingering question with him is of course the experience level but also his ability to focus play after play with the horrible half of football in Corvalis still lingering over his head from earlier this fall. Sanchez can stroke the ball with a perfect rotation and has tremendous accuracy for someone taking snaps with the second team for two years until this past fall. His arm strength may be second to Stafford in this class, but he will take the backseat to few at the next level as he can fling it with the best of them. As often happens teams make moves to improve their franchises quickly and Sanchez may not have that type of impact to offer, but with a team looking to gradually advance his position on the depth chart while molding him into an NFL signal caller Sanchez could flourish. With the way the draft stands to date, the needs of most teams in the top eight or nine picks arent really at the quarterback position. Sanchez could make Detroit take a second look at consider him first overall, but with an unproven resume it is more likely that he ends up in the latter half of the top ten and a Bay Area transition seems to fit best as the Niners could groom him for a year behind their current guys on the depth chart and get him ready to take over the reigns in 2010. Perhaps the thing that separates Sanchez in the quarterback class is his ridiculous Rose Bowl performance in shredding a top ten Penn State defense for four straight quarters making them look mediocre. With many of those Penn State player ending up on NFL rosters next fall, maybe scouts will realize that Sanchez is the real deal and certainly has what it takes to hold one of the thirty-two starting positions in the NFL.

bfjs9wSLaa	yup, i HATE him as a baby face, LOVE him as a heel.  He, Orton and Kennedy should ALWAYS be heels, or else they come across as "lazy"|`|pnsp765saa	Yes I would agree, Batista in Legacy would be nearly as good as Evolution|`|ayFd2u7naa	No he is a hack! Plus he is not a second generation superstar so he won't be joining Legacy so stop with all this bs!|`|yKBsB4Dyaa	YESSSSS 100% RIGHT  WOW IMAGINE BAUTISTA HEEL|`|2KIRdfIcaa	YES PLEASE|`|XuX4lavPaa	To many heels in Raw...he's better off a face for now.   Besides, he is not a 2nd or 3rd generation superstar.|`|HsphA384aa	Batista would be better healed but he's a warrior for coming unhealed. He's still NOT better than John Cena!|`|CK0RLmlfaa	o yes hes been good too long and raw needs another heel|`|hL3eS2zKaa	I really want him to return as a heel, a new twist on things. I think he should, but wont join Legacy.|`|3Rdc3SWhaa	id like to see him return as a heel with Evolution|`|rH3ylNuYaa	yea but he cant wrestle.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	I'll be honest the only way i'll remotely like batista is if he retires instead of returns. He is sloppy and dangerous, unless he comes back with a renewed passion for business he should just walk away. i understand the sloppiness is to do with his age and all the rest but there is a point if your not a very good performer to being with that you need to just admit your body can't do what it could before and now your crap.     Legacy is a stable based on 2nd or 3rd generation stars, why add batista?|`|AA11482019	He's cool either way.  Legacy?  When was his dad a wrestler?  Never.|`|JiCfYfLraa	hell yea batista was such a badass as a heel i want him to attack john cena and have a big feud with him. batista was so scary and dominating as a heel remember when he chocked the poison  mist out of tijari GOT DAMN tijiri was shaking and the ambulance had to come.|`|ywU3ZpIgaa	Yes then people would have a reason to boo him he is not that bad a wrestler how can he join the legacy he is not a 2nd gen wrestler
iPWKzzQtaa	He got 17.5M.    He deserves more if you look at his accomplishments over 10 years. The game of baseball is a financial bonanza.     If Selig had clamped down on steroids much earlier...the game of baseball would be nothing like it is today. Baseball benefited from Barry Bonds, McGwire, Sosa, Clemens and if the truth would ever come out...more than half of all players used some kind of PED.    I put that in now, before the other answers come in.|`|c3tADklmaa	India? Bud, lol      $10 million, for his actions. $13 million if he can hit a baseball and field a grounder I would use him to replace a player from the Padres.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	I'd trade him an autographed Pete Rose baseball|`|fQIxah8laa	5 million the maximum.|`|4YdbC6ekaa	He should be in jail, not running baseball.|`|AA10349169	$1,000    Somebody has to do it, might as well give him something    Even though I hate the man|`|AA11565799	He is just the league administrator.  If he does nothing stupid, baseball will thrive.  All he has to do is nothing and get 7 or 8 figures a year.  I think I could do nothing for a whole lot less.  And I'm better looking than Selig.|`|c6q3EERdaa	He certainly didn't deserve the $18 mil he got paid in 07. His salary should be about $10 mil, not about $20 mil.
E9F6qjRWaa	you need to improve you legs, the better push off you have the better handspring you will have|`|OnXtmCoHaa	practice! or do like just a back walk over with putting both your legs over at the same time|`|HMg97Fxjaa	Increase your back flexibility and do a lot of mule kicks (or snap downs) whatever you call them. Also practice handstands and backbend rock ups. Hope I helped :)
KOsGtal8aa	i agree with u. arsenal fans get fed up so easily. i think its coz in a game, we dominate possession, create many chances, have 18 attempts on goal, n the game ends up 0-0. stuff like that fustrates arsenal fans. we even dominate in the games we lost. we should be top of the league if we had decent finishers.|`|JThgHiaoaa	Cause Fulham is better|`|Rtzx1xKYaa	It is because they may be fans, but they are not loyal fans who are behind their teams no matter the result at the final whistle, like this loyalist fan in the world.|`|tfotPdeZaa	haha. i never said i love wenger or arsenal. i was always anti-arsenal =p|`|df578e7cb5897f4763eb259bceabb3d1aa	when the honey moon is over that is the result. no true united fan will ever do such, goes to show why united fans including the team are numeral one.|`|xlyk63xRaa	because its such a big thing, arsenal usually play superb football, when henry left and viera it went abit down hill, and this season it just all went pete tong , im sure its just a one off, but there is still a chance of arsenal climbing a little bit, if they regain form.  most people are just abit shocked, and some supporters like me...are abit relieved that arsenal aint in the race , gives us liverpool fans abit more hope.|`|efGx6z3vaa	I never did, I have been a fan since when  I was 8, all my glory hunting friends joined Chelsea but I stayed|`|AA11740796	arsenal fans are born....i am from manchester.....so united fans are born the same way. is isnt my fault that half the dammed planet supports my team........i wish they wouldnt|`|fLpnC8qtaa	If it's any consolation, it happens at every club :(|`|ceef93d1024d0e6a2e214650ffb17d50aa	Its because they think with their hearts and not their heads. Also it seems to them as if the team has taken steps backwards. The fans who pay to watch are entitles to an opinion. What fan would be happy that a once sucessful team stopped being sucessful, and are on the brink of playing UEFA cup football? I do agree that you should stick by your team during these bad times, but most of the negativity is down to frustration.|`|z6Eqgzpyaa	i think its because his doesn't spend a lot like us (about 200000000 :) hence if you start losing which you usually do at the second half of the season and the title is finally out of reach then then the fans whine about him not spending more and all that
QMveJrziaa	Cena actually gets boo'd alot more than people think, WWE will edit it out, and remove any signs that say anything negative about Cena that will be on tv. I even read that a guy was kicked out of WWE live event for chanting something negative about Cena.|`|h9PVRHPWaa	I`m sure he still gets heat from jealous teenage boys that wouldn`t know a headlock from a wristwatch but I agree its not near as noticable on TV anyway.|`|pnsp765saa	Yeah more kids are watching and attending the show|`|hL3eS2zKaa	Im 12, and I'm not a fan of Cena, Im like meiocre. But I still boo him once in a while. That was editted.|`|bfjs9wSLaa	yeah, i don't know what it is.  I guess he is just wrestling now, not doing his comedy fit for a 10 yr old.|`|CK0RLmlfaa	o yes he is one of the most popular people in all of sports entertainment i mean you can ask people who dont watch wrestling if they know who cena is and they would know|`|HsphA384aa	I think John Cena is the best. Yeah john cena is getting more respect because the world heavyweight championship is more important than the WWE championship.|`|ayFd2u7naa	No he still gets massive heat they just edit it out and put in cheers! Go to a live show and you will see the only people that cheer for him are kids and 12 year old girls!|`|855bpb3Caa	People are right, boos are edited out to make it seem like there are not many people booing Cena, but i do think that Cena does have more respect than he did have, especially for his work ethic and dedication to the WWE and the fans.    Yes, Anti Cena signs have been taken off fans at the arena, but so have other signs that are against other top guys like HHH as well.|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	Well i don't understand why people are booing him all the time when he works so hard to please the fans and is always working to improve his wrestling ability and besides people like carlito and others have said that cena barely rests and always works for the job that he loves. For the man with that kind of passion i just can't understand all this heat. I respect the guy. I understand how cena haters think he wins too much or stuff and sometimes i agree but still we can't blame him for everything and when anybody else gets on a roll and always wins i don't see much people complain.
iv8Saahtaa	I think the Sox desperately need a 2nd baseman not another power hitter as a outfielder/DH. JD is fine where he is at and does great in the field and at the plate. Jermaine Dye and Carlos Quentin were like a 2 man army last year, I'm surprised we made it to the playoffs without CQ and giving up JD would be a huge mistake since our other power hitters are not hot all year long.|`|vLHHXHdCaa	ABREU: AVG.296                           OBP.371                                         HR.20                                             RBI.100                                            SB.22                                              SO.109                                THOME: AVG.245               OBP.362               HR.34               SB.1                 SO.147    Get rid of Thome instead of Dye. Thome is more expensive and isn't getting younger so i say Thome goes and Abreu plays DH|`|Mxzz2my7aa	dyes better then abreu|`|NItOTnkRaa	You give up a lot of power by moving Dye - Abreu is a great on base guy and doubles threat. Not sure who is the better defender though.|`|xw13XqNaaa	DYE|`|mmbKlqLEaa	Well JD would have to be moved for this to happen. Lets say prospects. Abreu would be better for our plan of speed and getting on base. With Abreu you sacrifice power for speed, but The Cell could be VERY friendly to him. I think it would be a good move considering the Sox need to rely on home runs less and get on base and steal more. All around, if we could get rid of Dye to get Abreu and prospects, im for it|`|FYBUbRmTaa	No ....I'm not willing to give up Dye. Dye is underrated, but he is a significant contributer to the team. He was the 05 World Series MVP. He was 1st in team batting avg. in 06 and 08. He consistently drives in runs and hits homeruns. He has good character and the White Sox need a guy like him. I'm biased though because as a White Sox fan I love each and every player on that 05 team....but even when I stop to think about it I can't imagine Abreu being that much more productive in comparison to Dye.

1jmXT4Vvaa	I can't for the life of me remember who, but some one makes a permanent marker looking pen for just such a scratch.  It is just cold bluing in a pen.|`|AA12243350	cold blue will cover a scratch that is just into the bluing, but not into the metal. to cover that so that it will not show at all, you would have to buff the scratch out.  Also, do a test on a part of the firearm that is not easily seen so that you can try to match it as close as possible. On a working firearm (not a show piece etc) a cold blue touch up will be fine. I suggest you order from Brownell's as they have the best products for this type of repair, as well as the technical advice on doing it right.  shoot safe
a6EndAPiaa	The tallent level is already to diluted in my mind so no please no more expansion teams.    LA should probably have a team.  I would not mind seeing a team in Canada (I think Toronto has been discussed).  I think it would be a great idea to put a team in Mexico City.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	No.|`|RZIV15e3aa	NO WAY. There would be WAY too many teams and not enough players. Thats impossible.|`|6iuZEUhzaa	too many teams and players. no nebraska teams dude.|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	Dude, that would be WAY too much spending for EVERY city. But I think that los angles, and oklahoma city deserve a team.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	This isn't even possible.  First of all, not every city has a stadium that could accommidate an NFL team.  Secondly, you cant have that many teams and still keep a 16 game schedule, it would be mayhem.  There also can't really be many more teams as it is and still keep competitive rosters, since there really are only so many football players.  You'd be talking having some players who aren't even good enough to make a team right now having to start somewhere, and the playing field would be imbalanced and the quality of the game would be awful.  I could imagine some top running backs like LT and Adrian Petersen running for like 250 yards a game since there wouldn't be anyone on the opposing defense who could probably catch them.  Totally would water down the league to a point of it not even being enjoyable.    As for cities that may or may not be worthy of a team, I'll list a few and discuss them, see what people think.    Los Angeles -  The Rams and Raiders both moved out, and its kinda weird having a sport with no LA team.  LA fans have been said to not be as passionate about their sports as other cities are, and generally your football fans are your most die-hard fans.  Some say LA would be a good place, I say CA has enough teams, let someone else have one.    Las Vegas - One of the biggest cities in the country to not have any professional sports teams (minor league baseball doesnt count)  I know some leagues are hesitant to allow a franchise in Vegas due to its gambling, but lets be honest here, if players want to gamble, they can do it anywhere.  I wouldn't mind seeing a team in Vegas.    Columbus - One of the larger cities in the US, and they definitely have the die hard fans needed for an NFL franchise, based off the  OSU fans.  The problem here is you already have teams in Cincinnati and Cleveland, and 3 Ohio teams may be too much.    Omaha/Tulsa - One of these cities wouldn't be bad.  Again, based on college football, Nebraska and Oklahoma are both football places, just theres no NFL anywhere around.  These wouldnt be bad choices.    Also, if you look at the link I added, it shows a map with all the NFL cities marked.  The area around Montana, Idaho, the Dakotas, doesn't have a team anywhere near them.  Granted, none of these cities is really known for its football, but locating a team around there wouldn't be bad either.    One other place I wouldn't mind seeing a team, was somewhere like Maine, New Hampshire, or Vermont.  I know all of New England has the Patriots (though, as someone from CT, I cant stand them) but a team up north wouldn't be bad.  Theres just something about a winter game, in freezing weather, maybe some snow, thats just classic football. Its kinda like how everyone knows the Packers have a huge home field advantage in the winter, wouldn't mind seeing a few other places like that.    Granted, most of these would never happen.  The league has enough teams as it is, and would be a lot to bring in more, but if they ever did, those are some of the places I'd like to see a team.|`|iMGSaC0qaa	I don't think every city should have one. I think it would be a DECENT idea at best to have every state have one with the acception of Alaska. but even then 49 teams would be way too many in my eyes. But i could be wrong...    Now... Cities who i think is worthy of one.... Are...  1.) Los Angeles, California (Even though They've lost 2-3 teams already)  2.) Lincoln, Nebraska  3.) Oklahoma City, Oklahoma  4.) Las Vegas, Nevada  5.) Salt Lake City, Utah  6.) Detriot, Michigan (They don't have a pro team. Pop Warner team at best! lol)
NKmeIExLaa	i dont know but they should THEY PLAYED IN THE 2008 SEASON!|`|c6q3EERdaa	They are in different leagues. The only time they could play is during interleague play, which is usually in June and July. I don't know how often they've played each other.|`|PwED69Isaa	Tigers are in the American League Central.  Reds are in the National League Central.    You only play teams from your own league, except for about 5 series a year, where you play interleague play.    Normally, the matchups for interleague play switch off from division to division each year. For instance: The NL West will play the AL East one year, AL Central the next, AL West the next, etc.    This year, the AL Central will play the NL Central in interleague play, but for some reason the Reds and Tigers will not play. The Toronto Blue Jays are playing the Reds for some reason. The Colorado Rockies are playing the Tigers. Not sure why that is happening. Other than those two matchups... it is Central vs Central this year.|`|6iuZEUhzaa	because the tigers are in AL  reds are in NL    sometimes they play, when the AL central (tigers division) plays the NL central (reds division.)    this usually happens every 3 years unless they play in the world series|`|12JCF1Wkaa	when the national league and the American league play for two weeks dont they play the  American teams like every other year so they trade off on teams?|`|Fen6g3f9aa	Beacuse the MLB Schedule Gurus said so.|`|Mxzz2my7aa	y would they|`|NItOTnkRaa	Tigers play in the American League, Reds play in the National League|`|JINK3IHiaa	Tigers - American League  Reds - National League    I'm not sure how the interleague play matches are chosen, but tigers/reds aren't matched up often.|`|Tmr7f3Xgaa	Sometimes they do. I am getting a little sick of the Cards. Lately the Tigers have had to play them every year.
NKmeIExLaa	a mlb team. did u know he declined  25 million dollars to play for the dogers for one year? i would have taken that in a second!|`|eY1Vttiyaa	Hopefully Giants.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I'm a Dodgers fan, and I honestly think, when its all said and done, they will resign him.  I know he declined a $25 mil 1 year deal today, and its been like the 3rd deal he's declined from the Dodgers, but its mainly because he wants multi-years in addition to the money.  The thing is, that no one is stepping up to the plate and putting an offer out there that Manny wants.  Eventually, either one of two things will happen, some team will cave in and give him what he wants, or he'll be forced to take what he can get.      As it stands now, there are a few ways to look at it.  Manny is still one of the best hitters in the game, and no one would argue with that.  The problem is, that he's almost 37 and giving him a 5 year deal at like $25 mil a year means he'll be one of the highest paid players when he reaches 42.  Granted, Barrry "Roid Rage" Bonds was pretty successful at that age, but he had some "outside help"  Without the aid of any foreign substances, how well is Manny's body going to hold up in the next 5 years, and will he decilne.  Granted he's great now, but you have to ask yourself these questions when handing out a long term contract, and thats why no team, not even the free spending Yankees, has offered him a 5 year deal like he wants.  Manny can wait for one, some team may bite based on how good he is now, but think about this, what he wants is more money than he's ever made in his career.  He's looking for a big payday, and there just isn't anyone willing to pay it right now.    So, back to the question as to where he'll end up.  The Dodgers are interested and have stated they will keep trying.  Many other teams have stated they aren't interested.  The Giants may be, but they aren't willing to pay as much as he wants.  The Yankees, Mets, Angels, Cubs, and obviously the Red Sox aren't interested, so the teams who could potentially afford him are getting scarce.  In the end, I think he'll resign with the Dodgers, but I don't think he'll get close to what he actually wanted.|`|Qs02A0Rqaa	He's going to go to either the Giants or the Dodgers.   The Dodgers are nothing without him and the Giants are making some good moves this off season... Only time will tell.|`|NItOTnkRaa	Cleveland Steamers|`|eNBFsJx9aa	I say the Angels|`|4cJuKxJbaa	Im tellin ya them sneaky Royals might step it up...Manny was always complaning about the Media...hell no one in Kansas City even is aware they have a baseball team until the Yankees or Red Sox come into town!|`|xw13XqNaaa	Mets|`|4YdbC6ekaa	Probably the Yankees.  I'm sure they will figure out where to put him.  The Yankees may be the only team that would be willing to give in a two, even three year deal.  They'd be crazy to do it but hell they got the money why not?|`|1Wy0jXzgaa	I hope he'll sign with the Giants. Then the Dodgers will be super pissed, Manny with the Giants after he rejected their 1yr 25 million offer. If he signs with the Giants, They'll kick everyone in the NL West's butts.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	NY Yankees.|`|d9755b1afe952617603d01f2e4c6acb1aa	Giants

AA10698715	I coached gymnastics for several years when i was younger, and a tip i always told my kids was:  For girls, your hips are your center of gravity, so they need to be centered directly above your hands to stay up.  For boys, their shoulders are the center of gravity so they need to keep their shoulders directly above the hands.      The most important thing is PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE  Hope this helps, Good Luck!|`|OnXtmCoHaa	practice doing it up against a wall or have a friend hold your legs until your able to hold it longer with out any help|`|fMWeRrJTaa	keeps your ears by your arms. look the way your front is facing. arch your back a little. squeeze your legs and abs. good luck!!

But, now I realize, hey, everyone makes mistakes. And he's a 23 year old guy, what do you expect?    But that quote does NOT sound like ANYTHING that would come out of Michael Phelps. At all. I hiiiiiggghhhlllyyy DOUBT he said that. Unless you have proof, such as a video of him saying it.|`|mC8iwbVCaa	woohoo , im with youuuu !  he's HOTTT ,  and he smokes weed ,  and he has like 9 medels,  and he's ******** succsessful!  |`|I7rs7VRaaa	People are ridiculous these days.

An Internet troll, or simply troll in Internet slang, is someone who posts controversial, inflammatory, irrelevant or off-topic messages in an online community, such as an online discussion forum or chat room, with the intention of provoking other users into an emotional response[1] or to generally disrupt normal on-topic discussion.[2]
6tGYe5roaa	I get my tickets from my Uncle. His boss has season tickets and anytime he can't give he gives the tickets to my Uncle. Whenever my Uncle can't make it, he gives them to me. So I don't have to pay either way.    But if I did have to pay for tickets, I honestly would not be able to go this year. Maybe only one or two games and they would be in the upper deck.|`|dqxW1W0eaa	I was trimming back on this even when the economy was good,I ain't never been to a pro sporting event,been going to Florida Gators games all my life though..............|`|ubrcIGN3aa	Nope because I can never afford Yankee tickets normally so why should this year be any different. I think the last time I've been to Yankee Stadium was in 2004.|`|c6q3EERdaa	I don't go to that many games in a season to begin with, since I'm a high school student and I'm a Cardinals fan in Michigan. It all depends on when my parents can get away. Usually, it's a weekend or a holiday weekend. I usually only see 2-3 games a year. I'm going to see the July 4th weekend series between the Cards and Reds in Cincy. I'm not really cutting back at all.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	I have cable.|`|YzWkNRFZaa	ill trim back becuz the Citi Field tickets are gonna sky rocket, the economy hasnt effected me at all really|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Yes....and also due to the fact that my team chokes when it counts and I am tired of it.|`|R0sfdiNeaa	no just get cheaper seats|`|AA10554783	NO.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Nope, if anything I'll step it up, as hopefully there'll be some cheaper tickets.|`|12JCF1Wkaa	no, to me a baseball game is cheap depending on where you sit. I don't have to sit on the lower level to have fun at a game, i can sit in upper level and by like the 7th or 8th move to a better seat. Why cut back on something you love and have fun! As if the economy wasnt bad enough and I would not a take anything away from the sport that I love the most. And plus there always Direct Tv that offers every baseball game!|`|uu1IUxAkaa	I haven't gone in years, prices keep getting higher, high prices on drinks and snacks, just to see the local team lose? no thanks. I know if i ever do go i must take 100 dollars in 20's or more if i want to buy something.|`|P1bO87l1aa	I haven't been to a game since 2006.  Now that I am retired and the economy in a shambles I probably will never go to another major league game unless someone gives me tickets.  I'll stick with my minor league games which I find much more exciting.  Player actually hustle the whole game because they never know if there is a major league scout at the game.|`|Mxzz2my7aa	yanks tix r gonna b 2 high anyway cause of all the signings|`|AA10349169	Maybe  I will probally go to two or three|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	unless people start buying Dodge, Jeeps & Chryslers I may not get to very many.... it's already a 3 hour drive to Wrigley|`|utTFiz3gaa	no if i trim back i'll be going to none lol i only go to like 3 or 4 games a year because of school and i don't have enough time :(    hopefully i go to more ^^ and i got nothing wrong with cheap tickets|`|5cd32c72aed07fba8b2aaf0d3c285848aa	no, the prices are the same|`|4cJuKxJbaa	Nope, I will still go to my usual 2-3 games a year & watch DirecTV baseball package of ever game that I am not at! :) Dont know how I would live without my DirecTV|`|7uffHRdkaa	No, not really. I'll still order the MLB.com thing too. If you think about it, since it's $180 for the year, it's a $1 a day. I'm still trying to find out of ADTHE.com offers it though. I won't go to less games though. It's counterbalanced. I live 2 hours from CitiField. Gas prices are low right now. You remember where they were at last season? I usually go to a few games a year. Because I live closer to Philly and love the intensity of the Mets-Phillies games, especially at Citizens Bank, because of the crazy drunk fans, I go to lots of those games too. The Mets are playing in Baltimore this year too, so I plan on making a drive down there, as long as they actually have a parking lot, unlike the pathetic Washington Nationals. I usually don't sit in the most expensive seats. I wisely craftily find my way into a nice seat usually a little later in the game when I know no new people are coming. It used to be the easiest thing in the world to do with the Rays, while living in Florida, before they were good, of course. If you don't have a problem sitting in the cheaper seats though, I doubt the economy will effect you. Unless you're in the pits and literally have no money because you've lost your job. Luckily, as a college student and part-time worker, I really don't get hit with this problem like other's.|`|GyJqMWdUaa	I'm actually going to more games this season.  But I'll spend more time in the cheap seats.|`|28c0495788bedefa03a0bf8e36f5ed48aa	Nope. I only go to a handful of games anyway. A few of those are tailgate parties so there's no need to buy overpriced food and drink inside the stadium.|`|mml9J88caa	No, all the games i go to are usually due to getting free tickets. Which is superrrrrr nice.   Either that or my dad will buy them lol.|`|iGYGJfgsaa	no.because i didnt go last year either.

H7AcXAyaaa	Redshirt is a term used in American college athletics that refers to delaying or suspending an athlete's participation in order to lengthen his or her period of eligibility. Typically, a student's athletic eligibility in a given sport is four seasons, a number derived from the four years of academic classes that are required to obtain a bachelor's degree at an American college or university. However, a student athlete may opt to redshirt for one year which allows the athlete to spread those four years of eligibility over five years. In a redshirt year, a student athlete may attend classes at the college or university and practice with an athletic team, but he or she may not play in games. Using this mechanism, a student athlete has up to five academic years to use the four years of eligibility, thus creating the phenomenon of the "fifth-year senior."    The term is used as a verb, noun, and adjective. For example, a coach may choose to redshirt a player who is then referred to as a redshirt freshman or simply a redshirt.    The term has also been adopted to elementary education where it refers to the practice of delaying a child's entrance into kindergarten by a year to give the child an opportunity for further mental, physical, or socioemotional growth.    The term is also used in American professional football. In this instance, a red jersey is worn by a player - usually the team's starting quarterback - during practice and signifies that the player is not to be tackled or hit during practice to prevent injury to a critical member of the team.|`|3TPrzLQtaa	that means he is actually a sophmore in college but didnt play his freshman year|`|og84wi5saa	A redshirt freshman is when you get held back after your first year in high school or more commonly college for sports. A true freshman is when it is "truely" your first year in college and you weren't held back after your first year in college.
q2TOb6unaa	There's 2 possible things going on here.    1. You have a super stiff, cheap board (such as lamar, ltd etc.), that has no pop. You can't do much if this is the case since it is the board, not you.    2. You aren't loading the tail. Everyone seems to be forgetting how to ollie the proper way these days. You want to bend you knees, shift your weight on and over your back foot then quickly jump with your front leg while transferring your weight back to the center of your board and jumping up with your back foot RIGHT after your front foot. It is hard to explain so here's a video.    http://www.5min.com/Video/How-to-Ollie-i...    Hope this helps.|`|MNws22r5aa	Well for starters,    When you jump you don't want to put a lot of weight on your nose of your board, it will just drag you down.|`|8KyKsOLWaa	A really simple way to jump higher on flatter ground is to start with your knees as bent as possible. It'll give you more of a spring action so you'll be able to jump higher.    If you're struggling with this, you may need to increase your leg strength. Squats are a snowboarders best friend!
AA11610448	usually people have a place where it goes to first and leaves last, so it could take a while to thin your legs without adding muscle.  try exercising in sauna suit bottoms, i don't know if it will work, but it will at least make your legs sweat more than the rest of you.
E6GafIX1aa	The only answer is to continue to practice. Try to zone out when your in the game and forget about the pressure, that may make it easier for you.

NXktxy8jaa	I Don't think they are running out of ideas, they are just creating lousy ones. If anything heres how my storyline would be:    After retaining The World Heavyweight Title At No Way Out, which better not happen by the way, John Cena comes out on RAW and says how hard the match was. He thanks all the wrestlers for a good match. Then Randy Orton comes out with the Legacy. Orton says that there will be a surprise tonight, but it will remain a secret until then. Orton then says that tonight John Cena will be in a 2-On-1 Handicap Match against Cody Rhodes and Ted Dibiase. John Cena accepts. Time passes and the match comes between John Cena and Priceless. Its a good match, and it goes back and forth until Randy Orton comes out. He goes in the ring and starts to beat up Cena along with Priceless and they get disqualified. Orton then says that a new superstar in the WWE has joined The Legacy, and that superstar is, Batista! Batistas music hits, but he enters in a Heel-Like manner. He gets in the ring and Batista Bombs Cena. The next week on RAW Batista comes out and addresses last weeks attack. Batista says that ever since he joined the WWE he has tried hard to please the fans and he has done everything he possibly could to make the fans happy, but he still never got any respect. Then he goes on to say how greedy and spoiled the fans are, and how they cant appreciate anything. He says that he tried and failed to gain respect with them so he is no longer on their side. Then the Legacy Group comes out and they all shake his hand. The fans boo as The Legacy leaves the ring. Because of this, John Cena creates his own alliance known as The Legends. The members of his group are JTG, Shad, and Rey Mysterio. Eventually they all have a Tag Team Match at A Pay-Per-View as the feud continues.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	I'm I getting paid to think of Idea's for the WWE NO I'm not!|`|bfjs9wSLaa	yeah they are, but it's ok, it's not like anyone even watches it anymore.|`|K8dfHCz0aa	interesting. i kinda of argee actually. ya that would be cool if they got in a feud. i dont really like morrison, cause he is cokey, but it would be interesting.|`|hL3eS2zKaa	Wow, ok?

7HMNeRvsaa	I'm sure it all started when Dino Bravo challenged The Ultimate Warrior to a strength competition, then Bravo's manager at the time who was Jimmy Hart said they should get a random audience member to sit on their backs whilst they do press ups. He simply sat on Bravo's back, but when it was the Warriors turn he began doing the Earthquake Splash on his back. This was back in 1989 I think.  Then there was a story line to fuel the feud between him and Hulk Hogan? I can vaguely remember him attacking Hogan on the Brother Love show and by this point he was one of the bigger Heels in the business. This was around 1993-94.    Hope this helps.|`|ayFd2u7naa	It was after a lost match his partner at the time Tsumani turned on him.|`|DfPyyDssaa	Earthquake turned face when Jimmy Hart,his manager,turned on him and Typhoon after Money,inc. won the Tag Titles.|`|bfjs9wSLaa	He lost a match to his partner, I don't remember what happened after that

pHhICD6Baa	Your first read as a safety, free or strong is the guard.    If the guard pass blocks, you drop into coverage, if he run blocks, you provide run support.    If you read the QB, which is wrong, you'll be fooled by a play action and get beat deep.    Every defensive back coach will tell you, safetys read guards, and corners read tackles.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	The Nose Tackle      The Defensive Tackles      The Defensive Ends      The Linebackers      The Cornerbacks      The Strong Safety      The Free Safety      The School Safety  The Free Safety      By Bob Bankard  PhillyBurbs Special Sections    "Help me Obi Wan Kenobi - you're our only hope."    The free safety isn't really free. He has to roam waay back and stay there most of the time, just in case somebody (or a group of somebodies) really screw things up in the front there. As you can see, we've got him 20 yards back in this diagram - that's two first downs, out there. And his job is to make Absolutely Positively sure nobody's getting past him.    Because if they do, the team is absolutely screwed, period.    So he roams around back there, watching the game like you and me, with the difference being that where we would love to tackle some jerk who was making a run at our goal line, he actually can. If somebody runs past the linesmen and the linebackers, the free safety pummels him.    Supposedly.    If somebody jets across the field with their arms out, awaiting an incoming ball, he's right there.    Theoretically.    YOU KNOW HE'S DOING HIS JOB WHEN: No matter what happens, by the time the free safety is involved, things mostly suck. If they suck bad, he may have helped keep it from sucking worse.    YOU KNOW HE'S NOT WHEN: Things have gone from totally sucking to totally screwed.|`|jpiFhg1Jaa	Refuse to take money for your contract...get it?...oh man...that was a doozy!|`|3TPrzLQtaa	...the quaterback|`|78rASDJiaa	Keep your eyes open, your basically a last resort.

t1uKdzmLaa	I believe that the media would have criticized their behaviour more heavily because they are black. The reality is, people of colour are one group that experience marginalization in society because of their race/ethnicity. Therefore, the media would be all over those stories waaaaay more if they were black instead of white.     They would have lost some endorsements and would have to work extra hard in order to win the respect of the public all over again. With the Phelps story, some new outlets view this story as somewhat humourous; that would not be the case if Phelps was black.     The truth is, white people still dominate our society whether some people would like to admit it or not.     Just because Obama is president; doesn't mean that racism within our society has suddenly disappeared.     ...and that is my two cents. :P|`|EiIMUdTYaa	Actually Michael Phelps lost his endorsement from Kelloggs.

iAuQGNKnaa	38 games, about 10-11 months.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	The 200809 Premier League season (known as the Barclays Premier League for sponsorship reasons) is the seventeenth since its establishment in 1992. Manchester United are the defending champions, having won their tenth Premier League title on the final day of the previous season. The campaign  the fixtures for which were announced on 16 June 2008  began on Saturday 16 August 2008,[1] and is scheduled to end on 24 May 2009. A total of 20 teams contest the league, including 17 who competed the previous season and three promoted from the Football League Championship.    Starting with this season, clubs are now allowed to name seven substitutes on the bench instead of five.[2] This season is also different in that there was no New Year's Day game, as is usually traditional. This is because the FA Cup Third Round is traditionally played on the first Saturday in January, which in 2009 fell in the usual spot for New Year's league games.[3]|`|ggFUW3Kvaa	starts in the last week of august and ends in late may i think. and 35 or 40 games are played.

Good luck.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Looks pretty good.|`|kDNE2kw5aa	honestly with this system I would not take pitching until late, unless I can get the few elite ones, closers are by far more valuable than starters....with the exception of the top 2 or 3|`|AA11073512	Closers are definitely was too valuable. I also don't see the purpose of giving a point for an inning pitched. If you made saves worth 2 points each and dropped IP from the scoring, it would make hitters closer in value. My personal opinion though is that a rotisserie league is the way to go. You don't have to worry about assigning points, and hitters and pitchers are as equal as possible.

0qmFWZkTaa	if he anything like me, or any of my friends that play hockey for that matter, he wont really want anything cute.  sorry to tell you that, but its true.  hockey players have weird personalities.  we tend not to appreciate cute, thoughtful things even when we really should.  its just on of those things hardwired into out brains.  as a 19 year old guy that eats, sleeps and breathes hockey (i play 18AA ice, high school roller, coach, and ref) i myself cant really think of any cure/creative way i would want to be asked out.  my best idea is to actually get his equipment before a game and put part of a message in each piece so that way as he gets dressed he finds it as he goes.  yes i know its cheesy but hockey players have emotional deficiencies by nature.  you could also write a message on a puck and somehow arrange it so that he would use it in warm up and hope he sees writing and picks it up to read.  but not shure how the coach would take to that.  good luck  fyi if he ur bf he should be asking you.|`|HJuOSvmdaa	**** no clue.  the puck idea would be good but it would take a lot of pucks|`|2VLZfeHcaa	Shouldn't HE be the one asking YOU to prom?|`|gLOZqqEnaa	Say to him "Drop the gloves, Let's dance"|`|WcCnEtjgaa	Wear hockey gloves and go up to him drop ur gloves like ur gonna fight and say wanna go pretty boy

7100wGi3aa	Jordan does not suck but he is NOT the greatest. Bill Russell is the greatest.    Before anything else i just want to say that rings are the ultimate measure of a player's greatness but MVPs are there to seperate the true superstars from the Robert Horry and Spider Salley players who are just there for the championship ride.     A short comparison between Michael Jordan and Bill Russell:    6 NBA Titles: (Pathetic, Russell has 11)    6 NBA Finals MVPs: (Finals MVP were only given during Russell's last year in 1969 and was given as a consolation prize to the brave but heavily injured Jerry West. This marks as the first and only time that the Finals MVP was given to a player from the losing team. The award came with a Dodge pickup and, annoyingly for West, was colored Celtic green. Had Finals MVP been given much earlier, Russ would have won more. In fact, Jerry West (and his coach/general manager Fred Schaus) who lost 6 Finals encounter with Russ consider him as their most dangerous opponent, thats not counting the 4 Finals trip in which Russ left Bob Petit and the Hawks dazed and confused.)    6 NBA Finals Appearances: (Pathetic, Russell has 12)    He's 6-0 (UNDEFEATED) in the NBA Finals. He also never been in a game 7 in the NBA Finals (that shows DOMINANCE). But Russell, he have a LOSS and several game 7's in the NBA Finals (meaning Jordan was more unstoppable).  -Unstoppable my as$. Again youre missing the big picture. Jordan is NO POSITION to brag since he only made 6 trips to the Finals in his 15 year career (40% chance of going to the Finals, Russ is 91%). Russell is 11 for 12 in 13 years. Russ is a champion from his rookie year to his last. Whose more dominating again?    5 NBA MVPs: (Russell has 5 too and would have been more, if not his role as a player coach blur the impact of his two duties. Its hard to attribute the Celtic's success to Russell as the coach or Russell as the player)     1 NCAA Title (his shot sealed the deal): (Russell has 2, with a 55 game winning streak with an average winning margin of 15 during his senior years. No game winning shots needed. Unlike Jordan who is but a Robert Horry-role player on James Worthy's 1982 NCAA champion UNC team, Russell is the star and leader of his championship team.)    1984 Naismith College Player of the Year: (The award does not exist during Russell's time. Not to mention its worthless. Russ is the 1955 NCAA Most Outstanding Player because he lead his team, the USF Dons to the NCAA championship. James Worthy won a MOP when he lead UNC to the 1982 NCAA championship but Jordan never won a MOP because he couldnt even lead his team to the Final Four. Under Jordan's leadership, UNC tanked in the Final 8 and Sweet16 in '83 and '84 despite being ranked  1 and  2 and under the guidance of a Hall of Fame coach and with help from several NBA bound players.)    2 Olympic Gold Medals (84, 92): (Russell has only one in 1956. Pros were banned from playing the Olympics until iirc FIBA lifted it on 1989 w/c made it possible for the Dream Team, hence Jordan's 2nd gold medal. Had it been lifted earlier, Russell and countless other would have multiple Olympic Gold medals. Nevertheless, the 1956 Olympic basketball team which Russell captained won the gold medal with a margin of victory of 53.5. Its an Olympic record. A winning margin higher than the 1992 Dream team or the 1960 Olympic "superstar team" of Jerry Lucas, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson etc.).    It doesnt matter whether its in college, in the Olympics or in the pros, Bill Russell is simply more dominating, more competitive and flat out greater than Michael Jordan.    ===========================  Well i guess there are plenty of new people in Y/A B-ball section. Thats a good thing.    *cuts and paste stock answer to a stock question*    Russell is the GOAT. 5 MVP's and 11 rings in 13 years.    On Russell having NO "all around skills" . . . .    The first thing that i noticed is that somebody OVERSIMPLIFIED the game of basketball by limiting its skill aspects to simply "offense" and "defense". This is wrong. There are actually four main skill aspects in basketball (and even this is an oversimplification): scoring (shooting, post ups etc.), defense, rebounding, ball movement(passing, dribbling).    Russell is an awesome rebounder averaging 22rpg, a suprisingly good ball handler for a big man since he often runs the ball after rebounding to get a clear pass downcourt and start the fastbreak, and of course a great defender. He is also a great passer; he was even ranked  5 in assists in one time and thats beyond what you would expect from a center. Not most guards could do that. His scoring is alright at 15ppg on 13FGA. Not exactly mind blowing numbers but then EVERYONE on the 60's Celtics doesnt have mind blowing PPG. Red Auerbach runs a structured offense wherein all five guys on the floor have the opportunity to shine and score. The highest scorer on the team averages only 22ppg and there are five to six other guys scoring in double digits. Russell or anyone else on the Celtics need not to fully exert themselves on offense because the scoring is distributed. Russell has the same shooting percentage as the top two scorers (Sam Jones and Havlicek) on the team. Anyway back in college, Russ was scoring 20ppg with a 52FG%.     To wit, Russell is an awesome rebounder, an awesome defender, a great passer and ball handler especially for someone of his size and position, and a decent scorer. . . . . and people still call him as having no all around game? Magic has a career average of less than 20PPG, but no one is using that an excuse to discredit his "all around game".    Anyway, players playing as centers or power forwards - the tall guys usually - are drilled to have specialized skills (like rebounding and low post manouvers). They help th|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	dude look at his achievements and that is why we call him the best of all time and lebron had hyped but has not live up to michael|`|Mn97YDIyaa	He's been in six NBA Finals. He has 6 NBA Finals MVP awards. He has been MVP 5 times. He's been to 14 All-Star Games, with 3 All-Star Game MVPs. He's been the Defensive Player of the Year. He's been on 10 All-NBA First Teams, and 1 All-NBA Second Team. He's been on 9 All-NBA First Defensive Teams. He's a two time Dunk Champion. He was the Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year. He was the 2000 ESPY Athlete of the Century. He won gold twice in the Olympics. He revolutionized the game and made it so much more popular in the 80's. Players look up to him, and try to be like him. Almost every basketball player wishes they could have the success that Jordan is. He averaged 31 points per game throughout his career, and averaged 37 in one season.    I'm not even a Jordan jocker. I barely speak about him. I know that Kobe is amazing, but he's not on Jordan's level, and never will be.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	How many players do you know that have 10 scoring titles, 6 Finals MVPs, & averaged 41.0 ppg during the NBA Finals? Have Kobe ever done any of this?|`|4Vchxp32aa	Because he was better than everybody at basically everything.  What?  If he sucked you off would you be more convinced?|`|taDd2QVeaa	I do not believe you ever watched him play, no way! There is no possible anyone could of watched him play and believe he was not the best NBA player to date. He was clutch, intimidating, 6 rings, 5 mvps, 14 all star appearances, 6 finals mvp, 10 first offensive teams,9 first defensive teams,  rookie of the year, 3 time all star mvp, 2 time slam dunk mvp, 1 NCAA championship, 10 scoring championships.     A scoring average of 34 points in the playoffs. Jordan was the influence of the modern NBA player.     Larry Bird described him as "god disguiseed as Michael Jordan"|`|dtGInk4Faa	Sometimes I wonder how the hell some idiots,like yourself, reason on here! You say Michael isn't the best player to enter the game? Why? Just because you like Kobe. MJ is in the hall of fame, the 50 greatest players of all time, hes won MVP finals 6 of 6 appearances, he has 6 rings and you say hes not the best? You also said most of us aren't old enough to know him when he played. How the hell would you know that? We could be 67 for all you know. You talk like such an idiot not even considering what your saying before you say it.Your just saying things as stupid comebacks. "I bet you're saying the the Bulls will take it this year"?Who the hell told you that you dumb ***? You're just a basketball illiterate who fell in love with Kobe and your kissing his ***. Stop hating and go research before you talk.      Mykill maybe you should conisder the fact that he had other alstars on his team! Bob COusy maybe? And how can you say 6 rings was pathetic? MJ is better than Russell and Kobe no doubt|`|PFvIOJ8Kaa	Because he has 6 Finals MVP's out of his 6 championships. Meaning he was the focal point in every one, he has more finals MVP's out of everybody. Meaning he was the best on the NBA's biggest stage. Next? Oh and last time I checked the 50 greatest players that the NBA assembled on their anniversary all voted Jordan as the best unanimously.     Edit: Ok first of all it's the best players ever to play the game. Secondly, what does make someone the best besides winning the most important award in the NBA 6 times? And my opinion is that I have never seen anybody take over any game like that just because he wanted to win. All the superstars of today love to win, Jordan hated to lose. That's what has made him what he was. Oh and does Robert Horry have any finals MVP's? How many regular season MVP's does he have? Oh and are you an NBA player? Since you've asked so many questions, allow me to kindly ask you one? How is Kobe the best? True Kobe has an 81 point game something Jordan never accomplished. However, what is more important? Scoring the game winning shot in countless playoff games?Winning a Finals MVP? Or scoring 81 points in a regular season game? Lol @ you changing the subject. I unlike you know a little NBA history unlike yourself. And as for the NBA happening today? I know exactly what is going on today. Hornets just lost some key players and Kobe just scored 60+ points? And I'm not a Bulls fan? Just a Jordan fan. *Sigh* Last Edit, Jordan has 2 gold medals has an all star appearance in every one of his seasons, and was a team player once he realized that he couldn't do it all himself. However Kobe is a great player. And Jordan at the moment out strips Kobe in everything.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Foolish little boy.

No one campares other sport athletes to Russell...it's always, " so and so is the Michael Jordan of baseball", or golf, or whatever the sport may be...the Houston Comets won what?...the first four championships in the WNBA, no one called Swoops "Lady Russell"...

And sometimes i will bring a buttload of m&m's because they dont melt in your hand.|`|horxoMs6aa	The foods that you bring on a hake of course depend upon the length and difficulty of the trip.  For a long hike (3 days plus) i like to bring the whole shebang.  At the minimum a pot, water filter, portable hiking stove and lots of water bottles.  The best foods to bring on these kinds of trips are foods that are light to carry but still provide nutrition.  I suggest you go with macaroni and cheese and a type of rice.  oatmeal is a great choice for breakfast as well.  If you are going on a short hike. (day trip or 2 days).  Go light.  Stick with protein bars, trail mix, and other healthy snacks to keep you going.  i suggest peanut butter and jelly if you need to have a healthy sit down meal.  Make sure you take all of your wrappers and bury your leftovers.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	I bring pemmican, jerky,oatmeal, powdered eggs, powdered milk,maple syrup, powdered broth, rice, and bread, that's it and I'm good for a week, now you know this, try out some recipes that include these, most are easy to do in the outdoors.

CttL3LmBaa	This sounds like homework.      Friction is needed between the tire and the road.  But the friction is only wanted at that contact point.  Rotational friction (rolling resistance) in a tire is engineered out as much as possible.    All parts that have bearings are designed to reduce friction. That is almost everything else that twists or turns.  Off the top of my head but not limited to: wheel axles, crank axles, fork steerer, pedals, and rear derailleur pulleys (more expensive derailleurs).  A chain is used because it has less friction than any other type of drive.     Friction is also essential at every fastener contact with its receiver, that is nuts and bolts (spokes into nipples) rely on friction from tightening to stay together.    Hope this gives you direction and helps you think this through.|`|DFug1qB2aa	well there isnt really anything in a bike that increases friction but ur bearings are the main thing that are in ur bike that decrease friction i dont want friction in there thats why they use grease to decrease it!

Long live Wilt!|`|RvI1gGbDaa	They said on ESPN that he had 32.|`|vyYhJ7PFaa	Bernard King recorded eight games of scoring 50 or more points.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	wilt had over 30 games, mostly during the years where he was scoring 50 ppg.|`|AJEDjzC1aa	32 I think    http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/ba...|`|j0YJX8U6aa	32 cus there were no double teams|`|1b3ab1f5bfb9839f6af7c79693195feeaa	32    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nat...|`|7100wGi3aa	Wilt with 32. And what made it even moreamazing is that he had 3-4 guys collapsing and getting rough on him whenever he touches the ball. The owners encourage physical play since it is in their opinion that blood is what bring people to basketball games. Unless your Bill Russell and feeling lucky, Wilt was NEVER played one on one.    Oh the average height of centers during Wilt's time is 6'10.
VBHOiIBlaa	Keep your $$ ....    Best way to do it is find out when an NFL Star is doing an appearance at a convention or card show, and bring a jersey with you. That way you know its signed by them when you do it yourself.    Most are FAKES... they take 1 picture of a star signing something, then just replicate the signature on 100's of other items. Then they give you a CERT OF AUTHENTICITY, which isnt really legal, just a pice of paper from them saying its signed.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	There is no real definite way to tell so I suggest doing what the first guy said.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Sometimes, but a lot are those made by machines that print the signature on the jersey, and many are simply counterfeit.|`|81fcfa4303980d9f2a5f90a29329a6d9aa	There are a lot of authentic jerseys out there...and a lot of fake ones too.  The three major authentication houses for post-signed jerseys are www.psadna.com, www.globalauthentication.net, and www.spenceloa.com.  PSA/DNA offers a service which looks at online jerseys to comment on the autographs.
jMO9kDfWaa	HA HA HA HA HA! LMFAO. I LIKE THE PART WHERE CENA GETS OWNED BY THE GORILLA! but taker in TNA? no f'ing way man, same with Cena. I'm starting to dislike him more and more but he's really popular no matter how much ppl hate him, so him in TNA? dont think so.     I like your imagination though.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	****************************************    is it enough|`|VF2D3yTgaa	that is the worst thing i ever herd|`|QYGGn7lBaa	10 seems good enough for me|`|jDzL2aa0aa	YOU WOULD WATCH TNA AFTER THAT?

VjMpfA2Yaa	David Suazo............HAHAHAHAHAHA!!! jk      aunke I say we have the mexicans necessary in our team I would say, Kaka.|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Roller Coaster is right dudes.    BUT if we really needed a foreign player I would say Luka Modri?|`|HZ8KkQKWaa	Messi the best player in the world....with him Mexico will win always|`|VAMEPo0Waa	Xavi from barcelona|`|XSBNv0iOaa	I go with the "Roller Coaster"  because we have enough Young Talent for the Up coming World Cup 10  But at the Moment I would Naturalizar  Hmmm.........    Wayne Rooney  Carlos Tevez  Alexandro Pato    One of these guys...|`|1GpHnVHwaa	We need a young guy like Messi but wait he is beefing it with Marquez so how about a Foward like Torres|`|JiKNOtvdaa	Why would you want C. Ronaldo playing with Mexico? I'd say that Mexico has had enough naturalizados|`|8zgFyfibaa	I would say we need someone like     Fernando torres-hes a fast foward and if he was a naturalizado then damm we be bas azz phuck.|`|smeaQXafaa	my right nut.  It was born in usa  my left nut was born in mexico  my penis is half and half.  but my right nut could really make an impact on the mexican team so im going to naturalize it mexicano!|`|DO7nz8aRaa	Dider Drogba|`|4a3c4c50a6a9e82506477f10b7f1fbdfaa	how about we clone Andres Guardado instead and make 11 of him?|`|mdEqS1JXaa	i would say leo messi he would really help out not only passing but scoring|`|2P6VDNwSaa	None. Mexico has enough talent to go to the World Cup and beat every team like Spain, Brazil, Los maricones Argentinos, Germany, Italy, and others.|`|VVSWWEpNaa	Landon Donovan. We Need someone who will make us suck even more.     hhaahhahah jk.     Cristiano Ronaldo because he can supply the whole team with hair gel     Really though Eto'o|`|9KbU8jPRaa	Cristiano is not available cause already played with portugal       The player that i would do is la chilindrina alvarez he is what se need right now for againts the USA|`|zPCfcDXNaa	zlatan ibrahimovic.. lol imagine him playingfor mexico|`|athSKc9uaa	Because of the good moment of his career he's going through right now, Hector Mancilla|`|n6514FLVaa	messi for sure best player in the world!|`|atff6gP2aa	ronaldihno|`|EJswTYijaa	Roller Coaster is right but i would like to have a player like Samuel Eto|`|7Xridrxaaa	We need a number 9! Somebody like Zlatan or Torres. Who needs Gaynaldo when we have Guardado
DcVknH1Faa	memo ochoa over rated|`|8zgFyfibaa	Of, course chivas are gonna say   Memo ochoa because they envy him.     I have 2 overrated players.      Carlos ochoa-because when he was gonna sign with chivas. All them chivas were saying that he sucks and he's old. But now all of a sudden he scores and he's a idol.    Omar arellano-he does good in some games and now he's the best foward in mexico lol     Chivas hate on memo oh well remember this    Jelous  One  Still  Envy|`|6adKrscNaa	LEAVE OVER RATED SOCCER PLAYERS ALONE!!!!!!!! YOURE LUCKEY THEY EVEN PERFORMED FOR YOU BASTARDS!!!!!!!|`|3gfiVkkzaa	Fernando Arce!!!!|`|athSKc9uaa	Giovanni Dos Santos.      Tell me ONE NOTABLE thing he's done with the National Team. ONE!!!! At the very least A PASS that ended in a goal?????|`|eqp3aWPYaa	Guardado. He's doing good... at Depor. I have a feeling if he goes to a top club he will flop. Hope I'm wrong though.|`|TInbTr1Laa	I think most players who play in the FMF are way over rated.  Mexican soccer is over rated because of all the media and the fans who blow up the national team and the FMF teams...  I liked a quote that one of the guys in ESPNDEPORTES Futbol Picante  said when discussing why Mexican soccer is over rated "En Mexico Bravo falla 5 goles, mete uno y la gente lo ama! en Espa?a falla cinco veses en un partido y el proximo no juega"|`|EJswTYijaa	el Bofo|`|Yb0182Vxaa	gotta agree with some people G Ochoa is really over rated, I mean America fans hardly ever call him out on his mistakes.  I remember when he cost them the finals and they were like Ochoa is still the best goalie in the history of forever!!!  Other fans at least get frustrated with theirs.  I remember when Sabah missed a penalty for Cruz Azul, he was the most hated player on the team because of that haha, also Carlos Ochoa is not over rated because he is not even rated haha.|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Following your example I would say that azz wipe called Guillermo Franco. He barely plays in Villareal and when he does play he never does anything at all.    I would say Luis Perez. He never does anything spectacular in Monterrey, but yet Coaches always call him up.   WHY?    Venado Medina chivistas consider him a "crack"  El Negr0 Medina WAS waay better than him dudes seriously.|`|HZ8KkQKWaa	Carlos Ochoa..you chivas fans swear like his the best now    If he weren't with chivas you guys would not like him.    The Truth Hurts|`|VAMEPo0Waa	Ochoa|`|39e0b442f9c9982301be5e5712bd8134aa	Zinha might not be the most talented player ever, but a true fact is that there is no Mexican-born player who can play that position as well as he does.    As for over-rated players, how about Oswaldo Snchez? He was a great goalkeeper in the past, but he is no longer in shape.    Also Marquez. He was lucky enough and got his break in Europe; he is not a bad player, but every time I see him play he gets booked or sent-off!!|`|VjMpfA2Yaa	@h32: he hasnt even played a game with NT      ima go out on the extreme and get many thumb downs, but most overrated player tan tan taaaaan....Guillermo Ochoa.    EDIT: whooooaa! Mero Mero, el Negr0 Medina better than Alberto Medina??????? te la jalaste...nel te la arrancaste, le voy mas a Alejandro Vela ke a el Negr0|`|Jqlfj74Oaa	gio but we all kno that..|`|XSBNv0iOaa	I would say   Gerardo Torrado Too.  Because he gets Booked ever damn game.  And doesnt make amazing passes like Bofo or El Temo.  Doesnt Score like Nery   Doesnt take the ball in like gurardo   or Doesnt Defend Like Maruqez.  I like him because of his past.But not now    Also  Giovanni Dos Santos.  Because yeah he Won the World Cup U-17 for us.  But that was against your kind of age 17  year olds.  This is the real world buddy against real Men.  You only did good with Barcelona cause I mean Common there Barcelona.  Now you just Suck      Yeah Nacho I get he's a defensive Mid.  But he doesnt even Dfnd good,because he gets booked most every game.  So I was meaning,If he doesnt Dfnd he doesnt attack or give good passes.  WTF does he do?|`|Cpm25Pekaa	I think I'm the first Americanista to say this but, G.Ochoa is overated.  I would rather have Oswaldo for El TRI.    EDIT: @ E.G - Torrado is a Defensive Mid like Vera, El Temo is a Attacking Mid/Forward, two different positions.  Not everything is about attacking.|`|smeaQXafaa	carlos ochoa is the most overated mexican out there.  He totally sucks nuts!  What are yall talking about ochoa overated.  He is underated.  He should be the best goalie in the world!|`|DO7nz8aRaa	Oswaldo Sanchez alot of people say he was good in his time but he never was|`|qbPbvLuLaa	Zinha|`|7IquwRrjaa	this goes to caroR dont b dumb and say things u dont know bout him for 1 torrado doesnt make the goals he puts the passes 4 the goals 2nd he doesnt play a position to b makin goals and for 3rd his position is to recover balls so obviosuly hes gonna hv a lot of contact so b4 opening ur big mouth actually WATCH cruz azul gm then talk|`|XUSq0gHoaa	Cuatemoc Blanco. I think that's how you spell it.|`|WbUrwR2Haa	Torrado.    Honestly, whats he done besides get himself booked every game?  its not like he scores on a consistent basis or even scores that absolute screamer. Hes not good.|`|2P6VDNwSaa	Jean Beausejour  Americanistas treat him like if he's the next Cuauhtemoc or their "Savor".    I agree with Ticallionstallion, Memo Ochoa is freaking overrated. He's too slow and Televisa overrates him more.|`|g4ukAIecaa	omar arellano i mean really when is he gonna score a goal for the NT|`|VVSWWEpNaa	omar bravo. all his goals are the same and he is a weak midget
q0ZEKr64aa	no confusion here.    i played soccer in 6-8 grade (varsity)  9-10 grade (JV) 11-12 grade (varsity)  4 years college, soccer scholarship.    i actually didn't smoke pot until freshman-college, but knowing >95% of the college athletes, aside from a handful of football players (literally 4-5) EVERYONE i knew smoked pot without exception.    middle class parents get over it.  your martini luncheon attitude is a much greater killer.    one of these days politicians will get it.|`|USfjlrLNaa	IDK who it was, but who would smoke with THAT guy again.....and "yes" i think he will smoke again, but in the privacy of his own place and not in a dorm room in South Carolina.|`|24WKJ6SPaa	i doubt anyone knows the first answer...but for the second answer i would certainly hope not..regardless my stand on pots legality that is not something i want my child who sees him as a role model to see and say...oh...michael does it that must mean its ok for me....no i think there should be repercussions for him given his social status|`|jRtQTN24aa	Smoke again, maybe. You can't be in sports and smoke pot. But you can toot cocaine and be president. Go figure.|`|5fkXGDEAaa	Who cares who and why took the picture.  Michael lives his life and choose to smoke pot.  Everyone's primary right in live is to do whatever you like.  And to answer the second question.....if he likes it so much that he wants to have the feeling again.....he will smoke again to satisvy his senses.
AlZPIAtmaa	They had One of Their Own.      Now there are Softball leagues.    Jennie Finch is a hottie!    How freakin' great would a Lingerie League be?  Now THAT I could get behind!  Pun intended!|`|gVYfFSpRaa	One day, there will be a WMLB.|`|4cJuKxJbaa	Ever seen a league of there own?|`|xw13XqNaaa	I would pay to see them play.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	No.    Hope this helps.|`|7rjWMG8waa	yeah its called softball
5TPaYv3Vaa	heck crap happens but that is all right but i really don't know what the crap is wrong with him|`|KhBmlaefaa	He's hurting from the Recession I guess. Every year is a recession for him out in LA. Who can compete with the Lakers in LA? They should move, if you ask me.
09BGmG76aa	im a Kasey Kahne fan i would like to see him run a bud Light and bud Light Lime paint scheme.|`|pRUx5AXNaa	Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s AMP car is SWEET!!! I would not like Kasey Kahne to change his paint scheme! I love that he is the budweiser car and i love the red and white!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  GO KASEY KAHNE!!|`|GCOrku95aa	I don't mind having Kellogg's as a sponsor, but I would change that dominant bright yellow to red and maybe vice versa|`|b7f2a1f896da50f40a80adc987669ea3aa	The Amp and Nat'l Guard are ok, but I'l like to see Jr in the Mt Dew car permanantly.|`|2kg7nWX5aa	No,I like David Reutimann's paint scheme.|`|nu0kSDqWaa	I would like to see Mark Martin change to something else, but I don't know what. That would be the hard part if I was someone working on sponsorships.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I actually like the AMP car.  It doesn't look typically Hendrick and I like that.<br>  <br>  I was first devastated about Bobby Labonte in the Ask.com 96, but now I love the car and Ask.com seems to be a pretty good sponsor.<br>  <br>  I just wish they would answer the stinkin questions during the race instead of making us look up the answer.  I don't have a computer at home, so I never get the answers!|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I don't think so.<br>  The M&M's sponsor is perfect for him. He's very animated just like his car.<br>  (lol) @ NASCAR trying to make him some dark villain last season though with a bright yellow car with cartoon candy on it.|`|595902780e2c09920890743b229c9c08aa	I dont think I would change a thing on the blue deuce except to quit using those blue wheels.<br>  <br>  Add: Chrome Wheels Rule!|`|FIvA9OVxaa	i like dale jr and no i wouldnt change his paint themes i like both the amp and national gaurd|`|OFFjKX72aa	I'd like to see Mark Martin have the tiger stripes on his Kellogg's car like Terry Labonte had in 2003.|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	I am with you on not liking the AMP car Lenny.  It's not that I hate it, I just think it's kinda boring I like bright and flashy cars.  If it was my choice Junior would be back in the fire engine red Budweiser car.  That car was bad or even Gordon's car I am just lovin his new paint scheme the flames are very cool and that front bumper is nice & looking threw the rearview mirror there is no mistaking Jeffie is a comin!|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Jimmie has only ever driven the Lowe's Chevrolet and it's hard to imagine him in anything else but I would love it if the 48's sponsor was Miller Lite.  I'm from Wisconsin and they're from Wisconsin.  I support their product regularly during races and the blue deuce looks pretty cool.  It would look even better as a Chevy and in victory lane frequently.  That would rule!!!<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|YHYT8qMKaa	No, I think Jeff Gordon's car is great. Red and Black flames work perfectly. And Dupont is a great sponsor.  <br>  <br>  However, I wouldn't mind seeing Jeff drive a different National Guard paint scheme like this one:                                                <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/172/394219225_b8315fb8e6.jpg?v=0" rel="nofollow">http://farm1.static.flickr.com/172/39421...</a>|`|NC2BfEvLaa	No I would leave the #24 alone .I like the new paint job and DUPONT is a great sponsor.|`|MWSv1yfhaa	I would put Kevin back into the GM Goodwrench car.  That car looked great and Kevin looked great in black, grey and red.  I miss that car.....|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	no I would not like to see a change, killer bees have to be black and dewalt  yellow!|`|p8JfOlTzaa	I don't think Mark would give up his car to an idiot|`|VQHGqYXvaa	No i like Tonys new look!!
XPLS5pXKaa	Are you kidding me? I adore Michael Phelps, camera or no camera it still happened. Non stop partying for Michael since Bejing hasn't helped the situation.  Setup nahh.  Still I am a huge fan.|`|yRPYuJhsaa	People smoke each other out all the time!  "A friend with weed is a friend indeed."    Coincidence.|`|R5G9h2ygaa	i dont think the set up was orchestrated from the time he entered the party, i just think one of the people there was so shocked to see the worlds greatest athlete punching a billy that they had to take a photo. If you are a broke college student as if you wouldnt ransom that photo to the highest bidder.  Despite this i am adamant that FINA should let Phelps, and any other swimmer smoke as much weed as they like as the risk to their health, law enforcers, and sponsers is entirely their own. Besides the guy is only 23 and has to live with the burden of being one of the most remarkable people on the planet for ten or so months a year, i couldnt think of anyone more deserving of a bit of a smoke|`|8sfybuGZaa	Definitely.|`|506c8582306a6a4368e60cab5c957b88aa	Definitely. It is sad how people in the public have to deal with paparazzi trying to grab a story at their expense!|`|LQQAQDkIaa	He probably was set up. Those tabloids pay a lot of money for pictures of celebrities, especially if the photos are a bit scandalous. He should see an attorney.  Even so, it does nothing to detract from his amazing Performance in China. he is the MAN!|`|Lsb9T2KDaa	It probably was a set-up but he still is an idiot for not figuring that out at the time
hlqj0pvxaa	Hi - I teach Okinawan Martial Arts - aka - Karate.     As someone before mentioned - if there is a high number of black belts - especially younger kids... stay away.    Look for direct lineage to one of the major branches from Okinawa.     If I knew your location, I could point you in the right direction. I realize many are skeptical about posting their location openly - you can send it to me via email.     There are several others here that can also help you but most are people with no real knowledge of martial arts just giving uneducated opinion.     You should look into Judo, Jujutsu - not the Brazilian kind, but the more complete Classical Japanese. Classical Chinese Arts - not the Internal Arts, as kids should learn External Martial Arts if Chinese becomes the choice.     Good luck.|`|WYVBcYTNaa	Lot of kick and flips|`|Cm3ET5TQaa	first off find out how many black belts the school gives out, because if it is a high number then stay away, that school is a mcdojo.     find out how long the sensei has been teaching and how long he has been a black belt, the longer the better usually.    also asking around at different schools would be helpful|`|eSvi5IDPaa	Put him in Judo.|`|d3zT4NFaaa	Depends what you are looking for:    If you are mainly focusing on fitness: Then any class is as good, kick boxing or a competition based Taekwondo or Karate.    If you are mainly focusing on self defense then you need to go to a NON-competition based school. Go to a traditional martial arts school. You will get proper self defense technique there.    If you are looking to foster discipline, motivation and respect in your daughter, then definately a traditional school with a good instructor. Speak to the instructor and ask him/her what they value in life. Don't go to a place where there are thug-looking people. And find a place where there is a strict code of conduct, like bowing to the instructor and other forms of basic etiquette. You might think that etiquette is silly in this modern age but if a kid can't follow etiquette for its own sake then a kid wont be disciplined in future.    So the best all round martial arts school for self defense, fitness, discipline and good social environment is a traditional respectable school. Don't be afraid to shop around.

qUQnsqnsaa	Here's a few ideas:        1: Show him the WWE Divas, HOT HOT HOT!      2: Tell him to order WWE: No Way Out on PPV and watch the Elimination Chamber!      3: Lock your friend in the Sharpshooter until he agrees!|`|jMO9kDfWaa	Show him ladder matche's! Especially the one where jeff cuts joey mercurys face open, and the ladder matches where there are tag team and MITB. and show him Jeff Hardy cuz he's tha best! Show him the Canadian Destroyer by Petey Williams, look it up on youtube. its the greatest finishing move ever!|`|ARVV7emOaa	you should show him divas hey he is a guy right|`|VF2D3yTgaa	show him in even born pro-mo|`|SsodRf4kaa	He wants to see action so show him the Elimination Chamber at No Way Out!|`|Tsv6zyawaa	Um, personally I think that you should show him the brainbuster and double moonsault. they are good moves.|`|05RmoBJ6aa	You can't force someone to like wrestling though, they have to find out how great wrestling is on their own.    Most people these days start watching wrestling because of the storylines so get them into the WWE or maybe even TNA before you can think of showing him the indies. You can show him the indys though but it'll be a long shot especially since most of their matches are mat-based and/or long-winded.
kY6H6Fvaaa	hes with beth every week|`|h9PVRHPWaa	As has already been stated he has been accompanying Beth. Just speculating but he could have a minor injury or something keeping him from active participation.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	well he was with beth like the tail of beth|`|mBDIniTxaa	Gah,  He appeared last night  and the week before that    He last wrestled two weeks ago on raw and in the rumble        what are you talking about?|`|CK0RLmlfaa	he was there yesterday|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I see him every week with Beth.  I haven't seen him in any matches since the mini royal rumble on raw in which he only lasted like a second, but, lets be honest, he's a joke of a wrestler anyway.  He really has no talent but he's amusing.|`|XuX4lavPaa	Simple.  WWE has no story for him.|`|OfdupsTlaa	Santino is still on Raw he is the "Boyfriend" of Beth Phoenix the "Glamazon"  THey Have named themeselves collectively "Glamourella"     He was with her last night as she beat Candice michelle.

I look for Santino to leave Beth for Rosa eventually|`|Rq2BZ2Zeaa	He was on Raw last night!|`|DaCyp5UHaa	He's just comic relief and they don't need him right now.

iqNcXWsOaa	Never use a HPA tank with a LPA gun. That's why they make the one high and one low! The VS2 is a low pressure set up stay with a low pressure tank.|`|QcmNHRzyaa	just go with HPA|`|RuJYupFWaa	No, it won't mess anything up.    There are 2 output types for hpa tanks - LP (low output) and HP (high output).  LP tanks put out 450 psi while HP tanks put out 850 psi (although now some tanks are right in the middle, like Guerrilla tanks, at 650 psi).      The VS2 has a low operating pressure so you could use LP if you wanted but it doesn't make a difference, really.
tFrN4du1aa	A lady around here does it with her lab.  I think she trained him like any other dog chasing scents.  Get an old rack and cut off a piece, hide it in an old sock and play catch in the yard with it.  The dog might pick up the scent in the winter and retrieve it.  You'll no doubt need lots of treats for this experiment.  Good Luck|`|7royFhIgaa	It is great fun and very resource full as to what animals made it through the hunting season.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	cool, I can;t think of anything wrong with it if that's your question, don't have a dog, so that's out of the question, but it would be cool.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	It is a lot of fun. Rodents and other animals often eat them as a source of calcium. Many individuals find this to be a fun sport. It does no harm to anything. Just make sure that you have permission to be on the property where you are looking.|`|COVwNYGVaa	I have never gone shed hunting. I try to catch bucks on my land before they drop their antlers on my trail camera. It can be valuable though if you have the time.|`|QrjuueMCaa	Heck, after being couped up in my ice shack and not doing much other than that outside, I'm ready to go hunting for just about anything! It is a great way to get out and enjoy the woods once again after a good ol' Wisconsin winter.|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	It depends on how you do it.     Just walking around the woods looking for sheds is fun, but hanging nooses and snags around a feeder (at the right time of year) is more productive.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Great way to get out of the house.  It'll tie you over, at least until turkey season starts.
AkHwZV0yaa	thin shell means it wont hurt as bad when it hits you, they brake easier.their cheap.|`|QcmNHRzyaa	im gonna say that they are cheap paint cause i never heard of them. if they have a thin shell they will break easier. so their is a chance they will break in your marker|`|7VYfti4daa	that they could pop in the barrel go out and buy really nice ones or your gun could break.|`|RuJYupFWaa	Higher grade paint, for tourneys & such, have slightly thinner shells to break easier.  Just one of those little ways to gain the advantage in a tournament, since a thinner shell has less chance of bouncing off a person, and you can't get a person out if the paint doesn't break on contact.    Some guns, like higher end ones, are designed to shoot any paint with ease.  But not all guns can get away with shooting thin shell paint.  They end up breaking inside the gun.    Try the paint, see if it works for you.  If you end up chopping a lot (paint breaking inside the gun), get lower grade paint like recball grade.    However, if you're talking about RPS Flash paintballs, those aren't that great.  The best paint RPS makes is probably Premium or Marbalizers.
4l0yGuE9aa	Most motels are owned by the same people who control our gas prices nowadays. They take the term "supply and demand" very seriously. If you need it ... and they have it ... they are going to stick it to ya. Then when you book the prices over the phone and get a price quote from them they tell you the room will be 19 dollars. You think you are getting   deal and ask did you say 19 dollars? They repeat with "yes" after you ask them if the room is $19 about 5 times. Then when you get there you find out the room is Ninety dollars. Then you have a big argument about the price of the room with some Arab about the difference between $19 and $90.  They will do anything to try to rip off the American public. And yes they jack the prices way up for NASCAR events.    So yes Dale Jr is exactly right about the motels. Now the tracks just have to realize that the economy is bad and they can't charge the same prices as when the economy is in full swing. It's not the driver's fault they charge too much for tickets. If the tracks want to make any kind of money and keep from having larger losses then they need to accept during these economic times that they are better off lowering the prices and  suffering a small loss. If I'm not mistaken that can be written on taxes as a business loss or a depreciation value.     There are companies that are selling their products that are in stock at the same prices they paid for it because that is the only way they can stay in business without going bankrupt. It's either take a loss in profits temporarily and keep production going to keep from laying employees off and closing more shops and losing jobs or just go bankrupt. So The track owners need to adjust to the economic times.    Junior knows exactly what he is talking about. It's not one person makes sacrifices because of the economy. It's everyone needs to sacrifice in order to keep things going.|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	I agree with him 100%, he hit it 100% correct all the way. All of my friends back in the Carolina's would agree with April T, Mr Money Bags Bruton Smith could care less about the middle class, he wants to appeal to the rich crowd. (he needs to go to Formula 1) Maybe some of these hotels will listen to Dale Jr.     Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Duh...  As long as I've been going to races from F1 to NASCAR, and every kind of race in between..  Adding minimum days, so you have to reserve for more days than you need, raising prices for those week ends...  Glad Jr said something, it's about time somebody did, but this is far from recent news..  PS: one area that has improved over the last ten years is in, and around Daytona... Credit where credit is due... I said improved, not completely taken care of, but much better..|`|5LxpvXSmaa	It would be nice if the hotels tracks etc. started to listen to the sports most popular driver out there. if they read his article and  used that as part of the promotion of their hotels they would in turn generate a volume of business  that this economy desperately needs. Way to go Jr.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	He hit the nail on the head that time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|YHYT8qMKaa	I definitely agree. The track promoters need to realize that this sport wouldn't be where it is without the fans. They deserve better. And I like this side of Dale as well. This isn't the first time he has shown this side of him and it won't be the last. Dale is a very good critic.|`|PGlZn1wEaa	This coming from the guy that scammed millions of fans into buying a can of soda pop for $3.00 so they could have their 1mm name put on a car.  No I don't agree with Jr.  If he were such a respected figure that wanted to save fans money and help the growth of our beloved sport he would do a better job working with track owners, hotel owners etc and not against them.   It's all easy to say for a guy worth 100 million from selling T shirts made in China.   How about him not taking sponsorship dollars for one year from Mt Dew?  Now that would help the fans.  He sure could afford it.    Just my two cents of course.  I'm such a non conformist.  lol  Seriously it's just opinion.  From the initial reading I would agree with y'all but I think he could have done it more effective and in the fashion of NASCARS idol.|`|EHtFxGxMaa	It is a great article. However, if the powers that be (are you listening Mr. Helton & Mr. France?) don't react it's the same old same old for us fans.    Maybe we should start a boycott of the races to put a pinch where it counts. In their pockets.    Just a thought.|`|j3QosG68aa	~my god speaks the truth~ bless his money making heart~im going to cry~|`|4a7701071ad590528cb7c90f82d61704aa	Good for Jr, now if he can get this way on the track we'd be in for a show. Tbone, there was no purchase needed to put your name on the Talladega car, you just had to register on the website.|`|Tu9S1WaNaa	I agree totally.  I've been saying the same thing.  $200-$300 a night is way too much.  I can't believe that they would rather have empty rooms, than to charge less.  In a way they are price fixing.  I know of an area where people own some private lodging.  The other people in town, that own lodging , threaten to not refer anyone to them if they go any cheaper.  That is illegal.      The tracks need to have a serious meeting with these people.  It is crazy to pay more than what it costs at beaches.  Greedy .  You can go to Myrtle Beach for a week rather than stay 3 nights for a race, silly.    I don't like what Bruton Smith's son is doing at Charlotte.  It is an insult to the middle class worker.  Taking out seats to make more room for the rich people.(luxury motorhomes)  Humpy Wheeler is the man.  He knows how to put butts in seats, even if it means cutting prices.  They shouldn't have made him retire.  Oh, but Bruton is a rich person, so I guess he doesn't care.    They could afford to cut some prices at the tracks.  They are just going to hurt themselves in the future.|`|mTGEeCHaaa	Of course he's right, but he's a little late.  The prices have been outrageous for years.  With the current economy, everyone's feeling the pinch.  Even the wealthy drivers and promoters.  Kudos to Junior.  That took begoogles to say that.  I wish that he would go one step further and lay the blame where it really belongs:  At NASCAR's and Brian France's doors.  Junior's probably one of the few drivers who could get away with it.|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	He's impressing me more and more (again) ......I like this stand tough side of him.  And if any one of the drivers can make NASCAR and the hotels do something to help out the fans he can.  He's standing up agressively for the fans.  Agressiveness was never his strong suit but I am thinking its starting to be.  Good on him!!!|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Ooooohhh....He [blanked] and [bleeped] in that interview!!!    Woooo-hooooo....Go Jr.   That was SWEET!! And it's been needing to be said for a helluva long time! Good for him.|`|BhXMno7faa	I think that Dale Jr is right because the hotels know that racing fans are going to came and they are going to need a place to sleep so they raise the prices. Ticket prices are raised because people will pay anything to see a NASCAR race live at the track.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	it is ridiculous that they want to increase for the fan  because the races are in town and then charge someone less because the room hasn't been sold.. if i was staying there i would demand a refund for myself and the rest that overpaid...|`|eTaK695Faa	That's the reason he is so popular. He may not be like his daddy behind the wheel, but he is a man of the people like his father was. Way to go little E, to quote a great man "you done good".|`|OdUZRBRtaa	tbone u know u could of did that 4 freeon amp.com  ...... they had a free code|`|vj6YpJn8aa	Man I just got a whole new respect for Jr.  He is sooo right about the hotels.  The hotel I stay at normally goes for $70-$75 per night.  On race weekend it goes for $220 per night and it has gone up every single year.|`|7RUMbREoaa	Hell yeah!!!  Tell 'em,Jr.    He is absolutely right.I have bought hotel packages before and it is ridiculous.I spent $1,800 for a Talladega package for 4 in 2007.That didn't include all of the other expenses that come with going to a race.I have been on two cruises the last two years and only spent about $200 more than that for both of them together(a 4-day cruise and a 5-day cruise,both for two).    It's about time someone spoke up and I hope that quit taking advantage of the fans who love their sport and keep it alive.

I'm an Eagles fan, deal with it!|`|90ZaNZE4aa	Love the Giants  Respect the Colts      Hate   Cowboys  Eagles  Patriots|`|hfEGHKePaa	Hated:  1. Cowboys. Then again, everyone hates them.  2.

Hardcore fan since the franchise was founded in 1995. Will always be a Panther fan!  2. Eagles. I have great respect for this franchise. I don't have respect for the fan base though.  3. Steelers. I just think they are the bar standard for the NFL. They have always played the best football. I won't be swingin' any terrible towels, but I'll always respect and cheer for them.|`|4kdlE54Paa	I only love the 49ers and I don't hate any particular team.  I just hate the arrogant and ignorant bandwagon fans.  I get annoyed with constant BS rants.  The fan base that gets the most annoying are the Cowboys.  Talking football with the bandwagoners from the Cowboys almost feel like you are talking to a 5 year old.  I especially hate when the sware up and down that they are Americas Team.  ESPN did a survey for the most hated team.  32 Teams in the league and 49% of the NFL fan base hated the Coyboys.  So if they are Americas Team, then why are they hated by almost half of the entire fan base?    The Patriots, took the title of annoying fan base in the 2007 season.  Need I say more?  However, the Cowboy fans took it right back.    FYI, I know a lot of true Cowboy fans.  Those guys know football, are realistic, and know what is best for their team.  These guys don't go around ancting like fools.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|pPyaUCLHaa	E-A-G-L-E-S, if the Cards are choke artists, what does that make the Eagles?    I love the Colts.

Because as a Cowboys fan, that is required.|`|RZIV15e3aa	The Eagles don't suck. Your teams suck.

Steelers, always hated em, always will, im a sore loser i hate em more now than ever.  2. Cleveland Browns, mainly cuz they are basically 2 free wins for the steelers every season, i mean they dont even try most of the time.  3. Broncos, John Elways teeth, nuf said stupid *** grin.  4.  Detriot Lions, 0- 16 and they ruined barry sanders, he coulda been the best ever but he played for those losers.  5. Miami Dolphins, i hate mercury morris and how they always pop champaign when the last undefeated team loses, but mainly mercury morris and his stupid mouth.  Close 6th, Green Bay Packers, just cuz how they treated Bret Favre  Love:  1. New York Jets, I just am a NYJ fan an now they got brett who is one of the greatest competitors of all time. nothing to hate  2. Indianapolis Colts, Peyton manning and his commercials, he's hilarious an I root for him cuz of em.  3. Philly Eagles, Cuz of Mcnabb, i hate the city i think they are pricks, i want Mcnabb to win em a super bowl then demand to be traded and give the city the finger in the celebration parade.  4. Baltimore Ravens, i think they are the team that truely shares my hate for the steelers.  5.

Sorry if it offends anyone , but everyone is entitled to their likes and dislikes. It is all good no matter what team people choose to like or dislike.

If the colts are playing the steelers, GO COLTS!!     In general, the good teams are colts, titans, and vikings. Everybody else I don't like. For the super bowl I was going to cheer for the steelers because I just started to like the way they play, but theire attitude on the field stunk so bad I started to cheer for the cardinals. The game was so close, I felt sorry for Kurt Warner. Oh, I'm back to hating the steelers!!!
4kdlE54Paa	Dude, I am not a Cardinals fan and watch footbal religeously every Sunday, Monday, and sometimes Thursday and Saturday.  I have seen questionable calls before, but have never seen so many all in favor of the Steelers.  Come on bro....... The roughing the kicker penalty was a joke.  The roughing the passer was equally bad.  Santonio Holmes did not get the 2nd foot down.  What the heck happened to the 15 yard penalty when Holmes had a TD celebration using the football as a prop?  Why the hell was the Kurt Warner "supposed" fumble not reviewed considering it was within the last 2 minutes?  That was an incomplete pass with the forward motion.    Never in my life have I seen it obviously rigged and in favor of the Steelers.  It appeared way too intentional.  Officiating should NEVER be that bad in a regular season game and especially in the SB.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|OFi3jBSHaa	Kendall C, Proud 49ers Fan! -    There is no review in the last two minutes unless the replay assistant determines it's warranted. He didn't. It wasn't. As for the rest of your ramblings ... . I don't know what game you were watching, DUDE.|`|Af9bkdkvaa	Not a cards fan but they should have reviewed that fumble   and kicked out harrison for that play where he punched a cardinal  the roughing the passer was a little questionable too|`|RZIV15e3aa	CARDINAL FANS ARE BABIES. TOUGHEN UP AND ACT LIKE REAL FANS SISSIES. EAGLES FANS ARE MUCH MORE RESPECTFUL. EAGLES ALL DAY EVERYDAY.|`|ZNFPlUb2aa	I was rooting for the Cards, and your right, the better team won. But in my personal opinion, i thought Kurt Warner's arm was moving forward on that fumble that sealed the Steeler's win, which would make it an incomplete pass, not a fumble (my personal opinion). Then we could've at least aired it out to Fitzgerald for the game winning touchdown. But  the call was that it was a fumle and the Steelers won. I give props to Big Ben for avoiding some sacks.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	Zero, and very few on here so far I'm going over the older questions.|`|E9F6qjRWaa	i was going for AZ, and your right the better team won   now find something better to do with your time|`|yE7Q8LCkaa	148|`|HFrDqvIgaa	Im guessing the only 8 out there.....|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	all of them and rightfully so. The only thing I trust in the NFL is that there is always a fix in place to keep the book keepers in Business. That goes for pretty much all sports too. the NBA is only one step out of Professional wrestling. MLB has been fixed for over a century. Horse racing do you really even have to ask?

QcmNHRzyaa	yes if you want a bigger bore you will need a new barrel|`|QTd8MVDjaa	Why would you want to buy a whole new barrel with a bigger bore size when you can just get different paint? That sounds like a waste of money. You can't just mill the inside of the barrel. That would ruin the inside surface. You'd have to get a whole new barrel.
YrxLbfiIaa	Used or new?....    Used in nice shape - and I mean real nice shape probably $1000 minimum.....    http://www.bushmaster.com/catalog_xm15_P...

oYf3jSq6aa	Either post it in your local newspaper it they allow it and private transfers are legal in your state  Or the best way is to find the most prominent internet forum dedicated to your state and post it in the buy sell trade section    Right now ARs are commanding premium prices and Colts are bringing anywhere from $1500 to $2000    Make any transaction in a very public place but outside of public view and have a partner with you preferably in another car and preferably armed    If you ship make sure payment is in the form of a POSTAL Money Order and it clears before you ship the gun  This is assuming that all of these things are legal in your area|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Vanigon ruined it for me.  I was going to offer $300.  Just to add on to his answer, if you have to ship it, you are better letting someone with a ffl handle the shipping.  It will probably cost $25 or so, but will be well worth it.  It would have to be shipped to someone with a ffl as well.  There are just a lot of rules regarding shipping firearms.  As for the public transfer with an armed guard, good hell, where do you people live.  You can keep it if that's what it's come to in your part of the world.  Here in Montana, that guy would come to your house, you'd invite him in for coffee and cake, shoot the bull for a half hour, he'd leave with the gun, and you with the money.  I'd also look into putting it on consignment at a local sports shop.  It is just easier not having to deal with the hassel.|`|2XusVa4jaa	It all depends on what model, condition it is in, if you still have the box, the wrapper, and the owners manual that came from the factory. These all add to the collector value. The best thing to do is get a copy of THE BLUE BOOK OF GUN VALUES. This book is easy to read and to figure out what it is worth. Selling?  Depending where you live, go to a gun show to display it, or try a local hunting or gun club and offer it for sale. As a last resort, you can go to a gun shop but they will give you 60 to 50% of it's value. Good Luck!|`|xvy9xWvGaa	You should ask at least $1500, if not more.|`|cLm5FqWnaa	go to www.ar15.com and post it in the classifieds. I will give you 300 for the upper.
iTtMQud1aa	Hey Peter i know what your talking about flip turns are hard i was a swimmer and the turns some times took me out of the race this is how i got better,i would swim a bout every 10 yds then do flip and tuck tight with out the wall so i could practice being tight, then if you know some one with a trampoline use it to do flips good luck at your meet p.s. i was a state champ in 50 and 100 free|`|xUBmPeObaa	Try not to go straight.|`|XmMDTqYpaa	freestyle turns- Get in the middle of the pool, and swim towards a wall, do a flipturn, swim a lap, do another flipturn, then swim back to the middle.  Also, if you do flipturns at race pace, you will learn how to do them more efficiently.  It is all about keeping your head tucked and bringing your knees into your chest.<br>  <br>  Breast / fly turns-  fully extend your body before you get to the wall.  Then, when you touch the wall, through your legs up to your chest while also throwing your left elbow back, and shooting your right hand over your head to get into streamline.  <br>  <br>  to get better at turns, it is all about doing a lot of them at racepace.

eOQ8rGqCaa	No doubt I would relocate the Cleveland Browns, they have a terrible history of sucking. Now, I would relocate them to Anchorage Alaska, sounds weird, not really. With 350,000 people living there it is larger than half of the cities other NFL teams play in, even the recent superbowl champs the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Anchorage Alaska Penguins would be a huge hit. Th Penguins mascot will be a beast. Now, there are no other Professional sports teams there, so odds are, there are going to be a lot of people going to these games because there is no other sport to see during the year other then sled racing. The timezone would greatly help the team, because all the other teams would be thrown off, would the Pens be thrown off? NO. They would be used to traveling into different time zones. Anchorage is also a very beautiful city, and the Cleveland Browns will turn around with better coaching, some weaknesses filled, and a new atmosphere.

Show that you have an exciting and happy spirit.    Make sure you know the cheer routine, you know your ready when you know it in your head.    Practice! Practice! Practice! 2-5 times a day till your tryouts.    Always stretch to your best ability and stretch at one position for at least 30 seconds, stop when you reach the point when you feel pain.    If you can do the flips then your fine for that part of the routine.    Lats but not least SMILE SMILE SMILE AND PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE , and remember to try your best.        I think you do have a chance of making the squad because you can do the flips and jumps and you have the spirit for cheering.              Please pick me as best answer                                 ~Tamara~
1uSoU8Lpaa	2 years, 45 million dollars to be playing the greatest sport ever, I'm so there.   Yes, Manny is greedy, arrogant and has crossed from lovable Manny to annoying Manny. He's like a little kid who stomps his feet because he's not getting his way.|`|htpvTMHWaa	2 yrs/45 mil.    Manny Ramirez and his agent are idiots.|`|AJEYXzIUaa	i would do two years , because its two years playing in MLB, i mean what more could you ask for.. i mean 3 i guess|`|7uffHRdkaa	2 year/45 million, because the money isn't guaranteed to be there next season. The market isn't going to improve that quickly. However, from Manny's point of view, with the Yankees having 3 OF's that'll become free agents (Matsui, Damon, Nady), who accumulate up to 32.55 million, he should sign a 1 year/25 million deal and see what the Yankees are willing to do next season. If they don't win the world series, or at least get there, you know they'll try to do it again with signing superstars. He could probably pull off 2 year/45 million from the Yankees next off-season. A 3 year deal just isn't going to happen at this point of the off-season. The Giants aren't serious to the point they'd got for 3 years and the Dodgers would have given him 3 years by now if they thought he was worth it. My honest opinion on him is that he'll just sit out. Or at a long shot, the Mets will sign him and trade Delgado for relievers or prospects to the Angels or Giants to free up some salary, to keep themselves at the same payroll last season and under the luxury tax.|`|eP0KkYR3aa	1 for 25 because the economy mite be better next yr he mite get a two yr next yr. so that would be a 3 yr|`|cWmx0J4jaa	he wants 4yr $100mil|`|c6q3EERdaa	Since Manny is a Scott Boras client and is greedy, he's going to want more. I'd take either deal in a heartbeat. I'd probably take the 1 year for $25 mil and retire - and I'd have plenty of $ to live off of!|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Idc ! Id play 10 years for 1 Mill|`|XrCc85kNaa	damn...I would be happy with 1 million....|`|bXn6WGaXaa	I'd play a year in MLB for my current salary, which is a couple of zeros short of $45 million. Of course, I have nowhere near the talent of even the worst independent league hack, so it's not really an issue. That said, if you're reading this Jim Hendry, my agent is always available. If you're interested in a first baseman with a history of back and knee problems, a tendency to second guess Lou Piniella, and poor eyesight, who is currently rehabbing from a partially torn rotator cuff on his throwing arm, I'm your guy. I have better range than Tommy LaSorda currently has, and I'm pretty sure I could outrun Don Zimmer.|`|8sfybuGZaa	i would take both offers   put a star * if you think manny is retarted  i know i do ******|`|JSryPP8faa	Like last year the Met's will get another last minute deal done. Don't be close-minded, they have the $ and the need.|`|MyuexdrYaa	i would take 2 years 45 million. PLaying all 162 can make you very injure prone. i would take the longer contract so the money is guarenteed.|`|0TAld46gaa	I rather play two yrs for 45million.  if you have a career ending injury on a one yr contract  all you get is 25. Its alot of money but i understand why players want a multi yr deal|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I would, but then again, I'm not Manny.  He's almost 37, and he's looking for one last payday.  I'm in no way defending Manny, but look at it from his perspective.  Obviously teams think he's worth $25 million now.  In 3 years, when he's pushing 40, what's he going to be worth?  Not 25 mil.  If he declines fast, if he loses his power over the next few years, it could be possible that his value could go down to $10 mil, or less, with no bargaining chips for the future.  An injury could even lead him to be worthless.  Look at Bonds' decline, even with the whole steriod thing, and you never know whats going to happen in the next few years with Manny.    What Manny is trying to do, is use his current ability as a bargaining chip for the future, since its the last time he may be able to do so.  He knows if he takes the 1 year deal, that unless he's amazing this year, next year's deal will be less.  Thats a lot of pressure for an aging man.  I don't think he's insane, I do think he's greedy, as are a lot of professional athletes, but think about it this way, if he doesn't get the money who is?  Most likely some old guy who sits in a box and does nothing but watch the games.  Who's more deserving, the player or the owner?  Well, thats for another discussion, but in the end, Manny is just doing whats best for Manny.      The most recent offer was the 1 year $25 mil deal.  I'm sure if Manny walks into Ned Colletti's office tomorrow and says, "Yo, I'll take that old offer, the 2 year $45 mil one", Ned would hand over his pen.  Manny figures these offers will still be out there a week from now, 2 weeks from now, etc, and figures that by saying no, maybe the Dodgers, maybe someone else gives him what he wants, if not, he has to settle for the offers currently out there.  So what does he lose by waiting?  Nothing.  Thats why he's doing it.|`|RF1jX2ZVaa	I got to A ball in the 70's and they paid the top players then about 25-50k. So I play for the league minimum if I could get to the show. The money is nice but to say that you played in the Show, that's something special. Play Ball! Can't wait till season starts.|`|Mxzz2my7aa	of course any of us would and thats cause we dont have the talent of manny rameriez|`|7e779664f2fa69c81d06551c999ec10baa	Yes, but I'm not one of the top three right handed hitters in MLB history.    EDIT:  NOW he has crossed the line, Jenn Brewers Girl?  You must not have been paying attention to his actions in Boston.
iT8CNh6paa	The White Sox|`|PJLmAnTbaa	Actually, there has been a lot of talk of the Mariners clearing space under a self-imposed salary limit to sign him to a one year deal.|`|fQIxah8laa	I think it's possible that he might sign with the White Sox.|`|OfdupsTlaa	Tampa would be a good fit as they need a right fielder.  They signed Pat Burrell but he is going to be the DH.  Only prob is the money,.|`|RkWw38KNaa	Well I here there is a chance that he might sing with the (White) Sox.|`|7uffHRdkaa	At this point of the off-season, he's incapable of getting a 3 year deal. Oliver Perez is the longest contract you'll be see given in February or later, because no other team was in for it on him and the Mets arguably needed him more than Ollie needed them. The Nats got too many OF's. Why sign Abreu if they won't even be competitive? He'll just eat at bats away from young players that can use them. The A's and Braves may be competitive, so I think they're realistic options. It was suprising to have seen the White Sox offer 1 year/8 million for Abreu, but at least he has a bench mark until Spring Training starts in terms of knowing what he can get. Ken Williams may be trying to save the White Sox some money. Abreu wasn't offered aribtration, so he won't cost picks. He could provide similar production to Jermaine Dye, who's due 11.5 million and becomes a free agent after this season. Lots of teams, like the Reds, have been interested in Dye. So you never know there. I think for 1 year/8 million, the Mets may be interested too. One of the teams who may be most interested in him would be the Dodgers if they lose out on Manny. I think he'll try to wait out what's going on with Manny, or see how patient the Dodgers are. Adam Dunn's on the market too, and because of the extra pop he can provide, the Dodgers may be interested. I think Dunn will end up a Nat though, because their GM is in love with acquiring ex-Reds who couldn't get them to win in Cincinatti, like Austin Kearns and Felipe Lopez.|`|1e276cf277894bd2387532152b4db7a6aa	Late word today was that the White Sox had made a good offer for one year.  We will wait and see!  Baseball is around the corner.  Can't wait.|`|L77OlY1naa	The Dodgers with Torre there not gettin Manny|`|sVN6ftSvaa	let me look into my crystal ball|`|iPWKzzQtaa	What's his current weight?    I think he's unwanted. Tampa Bay is a classy organisation as of now, they won't add a suspect player like Abreu who is already out of shape and might be a bad role model for their young players.    The Nats...for a 3 year deal....25-30M. That's all he can get.

I knew they would be good from the start of the Season.|`|F2ygsPEbaa	I agree with all of the comments above.  I think the Spurs' role players are significantly underrated.  Parker took that team on his back last night and it showed.  He has matured from an exciting young player into a true veteran leader.<br>  <br>  It will be interesting to see how the Spurs respond tonight in a home back-to-back.  Portland is coming in after having played in Houston last night.  I agree that the Mavs are heading the wrong direction.|`|AvxMhVGmaa	I was surprised that the Mavs didn't show up for this game. I thought that they would be up for the challenge. But then again, it's Dallas. Or allas cause they have no D. What did impress me was that the Spurs brought their D back, they had a smuthering defense strategy that worked well. I had never seen the Spurs double a player so much in my life as they did to Dirk. But that is what could help these young Spurs learn about Spurs team defense and the rotations. I bet Coach Pop had a good night sleep last night. Thanks Mavs!|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	One word : OVERCONFIDENCE.<br>  <br>  Dallas didn't know that even if Duncan and Ginobili is out, Spurs can still pound Mavericks. They lacked in defense, and a poor performance from Nowitzki cause them to lose the game.<br>  <br>  They underestimated the heart of a champion team.|`|Memcmm9Caa	Parker is very good and they have depth and the mavs had an off night

zKHbK10xaa	Hello, it depends on what country and what football association you are a part of<br>  In Australia with the Football Federation of Australia (FFA) the rule is only proper football boots with studs (not screw in) <br>  it also depends what level you are refereeing (for example if you are refereeing a grade 6 C team i don't think it would matter but if you were doing an adults top division game then it would be important)<br>  I hope this helps
XXm2yCHiaa	He has not left LA Galaxy yet.  He is on loan to AC Milan as the US soccer season is over and he wants to play games to maintain his fitness to be considered for the England football team.    So unless there is any changes, he will be back playing for LA in a few months.|`|x9WmBlu4aa	him and his bint of a wife both media whores didnt get on telly enough in the u s a .had to move so they could get their ugly mugs all over the screen and newspapers again|`|456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	He hasn't left and is on loan to Milan because Fabio Capello said he will not pick Beckham for England unless he is playing regularly.  The football season in the US is over for the time being.|`|pPyaUCLHaa	He probably wanted real competition instead of babies that pissed themselves at the thought of having to play a real football player.|`|EJswTYijaa	Milian Wanted him and who realy cares alll he did in MLS was Sit on bench if You ask Me Blanco Is better|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	He hasn't left, he's just on loan until the start of MLS in March. In Europe the season runs from August to May, the manager of England said he could not consider Beckham unless he proved his fitness and as the MLS season was over, he signed with Milan.  Now Milan want him to stay and he's doing really well there, so he's considering it and buying out his MLS contract. Landon Donovan is doing the same in Germany.       The reason he went to the US in the first place is simple $250 million over 5 years plus endorsements and sponsorship and his wife Victoria (aka Posh Spice) wanted to get into Movies or TV.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	because milan want to buy him|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Because Serie A is better than MLS. And obviously money.     edit: Yeah wat the first answer said they play real football in Europe. :)|`|7HMNeRvsaa	The quality of Soccer is higher in Serie A than it is in the MLS, no offence. I think he wants to push to get back into the England squad for the World Cup and he can't effectively do that if he is playing over in the States. Personally, I think he is past his prime and there are now younger players who are able to come in do just as good as job, if not better than Beckham down the right flank|`|jym7hecUaa	Came to the U.S. for money and fame because he sucked in Real Madrid so he wanted to redeem himself by playing Americans. Unfortunately he sucked here, too. So now he's going to Inter on a loan.|`|BdR6eQWOaa	He didn't really leave, he's just on loan with AC Milan.  He'll be back on March 9th.  LA won't sell him.|`|QXhfiYanaa	He has not left he is on loan.  Its called football not soccer.  He needs to play competitive football to get into the England squad.  The American season is closed.|`|Qd6sTsogaa	He came over for money. He is leaving for money. Get the picture? Also because the Italian league is 100 times better than the MLS so he if plays good in Italy he would have a better chance to start and play for England in the World Cup|`|df578e7cb5897f4763eb259bceabb3d1aa	money.|`|dZ78IohLaa	Money. Also they play real soccer in Europe! I suspect Victoria had something to do with it also, she must have wanted to try and wow America.|`|NXAk99qWaa	Sorry for being cynical about it, but he went to LA Galaxy for the money and the fame (fair play to him). But for a player of Beckham's ability, he really needs to be competing in Europe. Americans aren't well known for "soccer" wheras it Italy Beckham will be playing alongside other world-class players.|`|Lu7qMDpAaa	he didn't leave, he's on loan to another team, they don't really have contracts like other sports in soccer, teams can buy, sell, loan their players out|`|Fex51ntIaa	Because his ego is huge and he wants to make sure he still gets picked for England.|`|PhfrrWhpaa	Because in the States, "football" sucks.|`|AA11740796	what would you do?.......all about money       sad it used to be a game|`|7evWgrZDaa	i think he came for the fame and money and maybe to try to encourage americans to play more football. and maybe his wife wanted to move to america so he joined the team. but its mostly money :)|`|YQLLxGNWaa	he probably realized no one here gives a damn about soccer.|`|hWaynBpMaa	Beckham has not left but he is finding it hard playing in a team that even the clubs owners admit is very substandard. he wants them to put money in to the team and improve it.|`|3sWtGvHPaa	because its crap    yous dont even call it the right name|`|htQX8Ywgaa	Woahh keep your knickers on, he's only on loan at Milan. He hasn't left completely yet.|`|MuLaZcS2aa	He came here originally to raise soccer's profile in the US which worked, but the team he was on suffered a ton from him being on the team because the salary cap made it so the LA Galaxy had to buy sucky players to stay under the cap. He left for AC Milan in the fall because they wanted him and theyre a great team and he plays well with players of his calibre. I think he should stay there and be happy rather than come back to the miserable Galaxy|`|jrETScoHaa	He left cos he wasn't getting in the England squad, and he wants to play in the 2010 world cup, so he was more likely to get picked if he was in Europe.

Maybe you should check out the ghetto near you....|`|AA10950898	In some back street where the crims hang out would be one  place to start asking around.  Otherwise the local gun store.

ZDMgrUcKaa	if you own your own land u dont need to buy a license or permit but u will need a license on public or land u dont own. i would wait the license expires in feb for this year i would buy one in march.|`|Xg1ZR4ptaa	Not sure about ohio, here in texas coyote are vermin so shoot away.|`|AA12274507	Yes you do. And there are seasons for crows and yotes.|`|Ekx7G30jaa	Most, if not all, states require a hunting license.  There may be an additional tag or permit to shoot coyotes.  I would check with the hunting regulations in your state.  <br>  <br>  You're probably going to have to take a Hunter Safety class in order to get your license.  Usually, it's 8 hours and you'll have to pass a written test.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Yes.  You must buy a hunting license to hunt anything in Ohio.  There is a specific season on Crows, as mandated by Federal law, so make sure they are within season.|`|AA11758925	always need permits for everything, now even fishing :(|`|cMsC5a14aa	Yes u need a license in Ohio go to walmart and get u  a game book
Ar5VHDiBaa	Why WOULD they sign Pudge millions of dollars when they have Soto & can get Bako for 2 game used balls & a pack of breath mints.    Marshall is going to be gone soon IF the Peavy talks fire back up.    Eamus Catuli|`|c6q3EERdaa	Probably money related more than anything else. Bako's a good backup, and he's a lefty bat.|`|SMjHwYvcaa	pudge is getting old besides he's washed up|`|YzWkNRFZaa	Cuz Pudge doesnt wanna rot on the cubs bench and the Cubs have enough arms to try for their rotation. as a mets fan, i wish Heilman well and hope he cracks the fifth rotation spot.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	In both cases it is all about money.   Pudge isn't worth millions at his age and Soto is past the point of needing a mentor.     The Cubs didn't want to spend $12 million on Pettitte. I know his base salary is 5.5M, but with incentives it would be close to $12 million.|`|bXn6WGaXaa	Geo Soto! He developed pretty well last year, and all Pudge is good for is showing him where to inject steroids. The Cubs had Bako before, he knows the pitchers in the NL Central, and he knows Larry Rothschild's system. Plus, he's CHEAP!    Why sign Andy Pettite? Sean Marshall already has a pitching coach, and the team has bigger holes to fill, like who's leading off and who's hitting third. D-Lee simply won't cut it in that role anymore.|`|Mxzz2my7aa	pudge is old and of course pettites gonna go to the yanks so u an just forget about him|`|P1bO87l1aa	$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$   That says it all|`|Qx8U9JR2aa	Good question. Bako is very unheard of but it's not because he's a top prospect or anything. The guy is 36. It possibly could be the money.|`|RkWw38KNaa	Good point but they probably want Geovany to devolop to his full potential. Pudge may be a mentor but he want to play. Anyway, do you think that they will pay the amount of money Pudge wants to be a backup.|`|fKAnnQeWaa	Left handed hitter.|`|7rjWMG8waa	Pudge still has some talent to be sitting on the bench. I dont think Geo needs a mentor. The cubs dont need Andy Pettitte. Maybe if he started taking HGH again he will pitch better and the Cubs would want him. He wouldnt be that good of a mentor anywase. They will eventually get Peavy.

YsSwe1Laaa	Speak to your coaches.. Your Rep coaches will be able to advise you and will have access to resources for direct contacts.  Any serious teams in Europe will want recommendations from your coaches anyway, so might as well get them lined out in advance.    If you do not have good French or Italian, it will be difficult for you both on the field and in your general social life in those countries.  Of course there are parts of the Scotland and Wales where your "English" and theirs may be almost entirely impenetrable, too, at least for a couple of months.    If you are looking for a professional try-out (as opposed to an amateur club), you will have to qualify for a work permit, and this is not that easy to do for an American.  If you are planning to enter on a tourist visa, you will have a severe time limit, and unless you wish never to get back into the host country, do not plan on overstaying it.  This all takes a bit of thought and planning.    There are many fine clubs with amateur clubs across UK and Ireland, fielding teams that play an *extremely* high quality of rugby.  A year working your way up through a Club's competitive sides while you study or work part time would be an enhancement to your education and rugby skills, even if you are an U23-level player in the US.    Mark L.|`|E3tWPVEqaa	Put one of your games on Youtube|`|xUrEnxIGaa	Buy yourself an ticket and fly to London or Paris and start knocking on the doors of the best clubs,  work your way down till you get a start.

Y4mz8BShaa	If what is the true FPS?    I'm obligated to strongly recommend you don't buy it. The V2 is no real improvement, they're both terrible. LPEG's are LPEG's, regardless of TM compatibility.    The V2 can be modified internally, but that's just a waste of money. Putting a high quality stereo system in a rusted up van doesn't make it good.    If you're looking on Airsplat, I wouldn't trust the specs more than I would a hamster to save me from a tree falling on me. If they actually put an M110 in there, it's very likely going to die on you.
fuYYRJXtaa	I'd give it to Tim Duncan.  He has 3 rings, and has a great team with great chemistry...    I'm not taking nothing from KG.  But ever since he won that ring, he's been kind of a cocky S.O.B..|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	Kevin Garnett.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	garnett but duncan is second best all time|`|vyYhJ7PFaa	Duncan is better, no contest. The Dunkin' Deacon!|`|WZvny7mMaa	Tim Duncan is better. He has accomplished a lot more in his career than Garnett. Duncan is also more consistent and has better career numbers. Duncan has been to 4 NBA finals and winning 3 Finals MVP's while Garnett has only been to 1 NBA final and no Finals MVP's.|`|sOae9LUzaa	Garnett has been better and is better than Duncan. he's more athletic, more agile, and is tougher at the post (more intensity).    Most people would say Duncan because he has won championships. Duncan wouldn't have stood much of a chance if he was without Manu or Parker (thus, Big 3). So Garnett was better even when he was losing, because he was a 1 man team. If they had switched places, KG would have dominated the Lakers in the early half of this decade.|`|N2177Ameaa	Overall, I gotta say Garnett, but as of now Duncan owns. You see his numbers compared to KGs. Duncan is just plain better. HANDS DOWN!|`|1Y1HtFfQaa	Garnett|`|t1uKdzmLaa	Tim Duncan hands down.  He has done so much for the only team he has been with; the Spurs. he has won more awards and accomplished waaay more in the NBA than Garnett has in his own career. That is my opinion.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	duncan is the most consistent player between the two, actually in the entire league. throughout his entire career he has put up about the same numbers he does now.   on a one on one, KG would probably win bc of his athleticism and ability to drag him out and beat him off the dribble. but if it were just post up against post up duncan will win.|`|JFYAPSU7aa	As of right now, Garnett. He has more physical talent than Duncan. One on one, Duncan would lose to KG.    If you asked me two or three years ago, when Duncan was at his prime leading a Spurs team to championships, Duncan hands down.|`|RvI1gGbDaa	I think Kevin Garnett is better but he didn't have team around him to contend for titles every year like Duncan. He did everything for the T'Wolves and even averaged 6 assists in 1 season. Tim Duncan is great but he's also had a great team around him for his whole career.|`|IHZwUDtqaa	duncan is way better. he has been putting up 20 & 10 for years and has led the spurs to multiple championships and he is still playing well after all of these years.|`|eY1Vttiyaa	Duncan.|`|F4zFMR89aa	Kevin Garnett was alway better in my opinion- If KG had the Spurs back then KG would have 4 or 5  rings by now.|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	tim duncan|`|QBvLgsmNaa	I don't like duncan  garnett's better..|`|0J834CA0aa	KG

QrjuueMCaa	A 'breaking' dog is fairly simple to fix. What I used to do is keep a short leash/thin rope snapped to his collar and keep the other end under my foot. When I would throw the dummy and she tried to break, I would give a sharp "NO" and she wouldn't be able to go anywhere. After repeating this a few dozen times, they usually figure it out. Every once in a while they get sloppy and start breaking again and then you just have to give them a refresher course. If that doesn't work, maybe try a choke collar or maybe a shock collar. I've seen some pretty thick-skulled dogs that wouldn't learn with a baseball bat with a pole-barn spike drove thru it. Good luck to you!!|`|AA10102776	people idea of scold varies.

You guys really need to remember how tough the league is right know! For them to trade 2 of there main players for Bosh and Kapono right now is a huge mistake.And the raptors would never agree to that in the first place.

He stated that they were building the franchise around him and that he was the cornerstone of the Raps.     In fact, the Raps management are gonna do whatever it takes to try to get Bosh to stay after this season closes; especially when there arerumorss blowing up that Bosh wants to leave after this season.|`|oPAi65Q2aa	More likely this:    Bosh, Parker for Warriors' Jackson, Bellinelli, Wright, Maggette, and Randolph|`|GBGcI509aa	Raptors would be on come crack

TUBGXQkAaa	practice juggling all the time. to improve in juggling take the ball in your hand and drop it and kick it up with your foot and catch. repeat that until you can get it almost perfect 10x in a row. if you cheat your not helping yourself. it will be frustrating at first but you will get it. do it with both feet separately. then do the same thing but kick with one foot then other then catch and do that until you can do it 10x in a row. always have a ball at your feet and go to a field and just dribble around.you can also do foundation and toe touches on your own and practice dribbling and doing simple moves like scissors or v cuts. sorry no such thing as last minute conditioning. for trapping- throw the ball high to yourself and settle it with your foot so it lands right in front of you, do it like 15-20x with each foot.|`|LJzHR4zhaa	Just watch few videos on YouTube and try to make few cool moves. Be sure you practice them well before you try them out on the match. Also, don't forget to train for your condition!     Hope this helped :)!|`|Y1Ues6z2aa	remember, the ball doesn't bite :)|`|tBFmUrmmaa	You are best to practice such skills as ball control. With ball control dribbling, juggling and mid-air control becomes easier. Practice trying to take the ball under cice ontrol coming from diffrent angles, and speeds/power.      Conditioning maybe you would be best to practice agility runs to help practice changing speeds and acceleration in beating others to the ball.

Spend at least an hour on the ball juggling,dribbling,turning and shooting every day from now and you will defantly improve your touch before the tryouts.     The only tips I can give you would be dont be nervous, play like you play in your head and im sure if you are a quality player your coach will see that.|`|6y9Bqok9aa	and trapping it for when it gets in the air like with your thighs and chest. my tip is to practice this get a hula hoop and stand in the center of it, and have someone kick the ball towards you, you have to stop it and control it within the hula hoop,if no body is available to kick the ball at you then kick against a wall  (don't kick to hard)

You are blessed with not just 1, but 2 fantastic grandfathers!  There are slip on recoil pads available. Dick' is your best bet out of all you listed. Since these were gifts,and are family heirlooms, I would not alter the condition of them since you may want to pass them down to your kids or your grand kids. You may want to try a recoil pad that you wear on your shoulder so you don't have to alter the stock. Try Cabelas mail order.|`|IVGrDYJ5aa	I am assuming the stocks are a walnut finish therefore I would look for a leather recoil pad that laces and ties around the butt. Not only will it protect form recoil it will give it that classic look too.     Try ***** but your best bet would be a gun store or basspro cabellas

I'm totally against it.|`|RQBolYlXaa	i don't care wot they call it the fact is cena sucks and can't wrestle and wwe should FIRE him|`|WAGAcLPMaa	First you guys hated the FU, then you hated the Throwback, now you hate the Attitude Adjustment. Cena could call it the Super Death Machine 5000 and you'd hate it even more.    Yeah, it's not exactly the best name. Sounds like an old 80s finisher for a teacher gimmick. I don't care though.

No one is ever satisfied.|`|5864fJdSaa	Sounds like something my mom would say for a punishment, not a finisher. Can the WWE get worse then having the  1 guy's finisher called "The Attitude Adjustment"?  The WWE needs to step it up a notch and forget about the kid viewers. Wrestling/ Sports Entertainment (I HATE that word!) is supposed to be extreme and cheesy! with real blood and sloppy punches, its a Monday and Friday night tradition! Its become a American tradition to cheer and boo for the bad guys and good guys while they beat the hell out of each other in the squared circle! The Champion always sets a good example, while the heel is swearing up the floor with screams and yells! Good times, good times!|`|7qeHZe9Yaa	Me,the throwback actually kinda made sense but this new one is not necessary|`|QBvLgsmNaa	oh wow, they're changing it?  nope, FU is definitely better|`|CK0RLmlfaa	thats pitifull|`|Qx8U9JR2aa	That's really stupid. It sounds like a corny super hero finisher. Now, I'm not calling Cena, "Superman", I honestly like him. I really hate this because it's only because of the 6 year olds. This could possibly be the weirdest thing of the PG Era so far.    The STFU is now called the STF, too.

cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	Because that is America's nature when dealing with any transgression involving someone of color. As far as the whole dog thing I truly wonder why it is being compared to infanticide when there are several NFL players who hunt. While I would never participate are cheer on a dog fighting it is no way more cruel than shooting a bear or deer with a high powered rifle. In my opinion that shows most people to be total hypocrites.|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Because being accused of something is differant that being convicted. They should be hard on all the thugs but harder on Vick because what he did was way worse. What he did can't be compared to any other players wrong doings because what he did was far worse than anything anyone has ever done in sports. Comparing someone taking performance enhancing drugs to running a multi state gambling ring where they brutally forced dogs to fight to the death and killed the ones that wouldn't is idiotic. And a mistake is when you do something once maybe twice and realize it was wrong and you learn from it, what vick did was over and over and over again for 6 or 7 years, thats NOT a MISTAKE thats a HOBBY.|`|KNTofuxMaa	There is an old saying... You can't fix stupid. An attic?|`|qq1fSV2daa	i totally agree with you man .. i dont understand it either .. i mean there are guys that you never hear about playing in the NFL that have been accused of much worse crimes then Vick .. and everyone always hates on Vick saying the league is better without him or a rookie (matt ryan) did better in his 1st season but Vick entertained us all every Sunday afternoon and i'll be happy to see him playing again in the NFL regardless of what team he plays for|`|UgnMjtYDaa	I don't think his punishment was too severe but I don't like how all of a sudden a bunch of racist people are claiming he can't play the qb position. Check the stats and watch the highlights. Also did you know that the falcons amongst others were aware of Vick's passion for dog fighting before he even signed with the nfl. I think he will be back soon and everyone will be buying another jersey.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	Michael Vick is, among other things, a sociopath.<br>  <br>  Are you unaware of the fact that there is a proven connection between animal abuse and serial killers?<br>  <br>  The other perpetrators that you allude to are not well accepted in a civilized society.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	The first answer was right on the money...........A rookie outplayed him in his first year. They are so hard on him because he brutalized innocent animals that had no way to protect themselves.|`|gYRfWcleaa	Because he was convicted of a horrible crime. <br>  Playing in the NFL is a privilege. There are many great athletes that never get the chance to shine on a NFL team. He was given a wonderful opportunity and  blew it by being greedy, inhumane and cruel. I have no sympathy for him or anyone else who commits such heinous crimes.|`|jLOCqhckaa	I think it's because he's famous. Why isn't every dog fighter's face plastered on a news paper or being talked about on the news. If it's such a horrible Crime then why aren't they facing the same ridicule Vick has.

He is sick. The only thing that separates him from Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer is that he was caught before graduating to humans.

However, in this world we are all quick to judge another and prop ourselves up on a pedestal thinking we are so much better because we didn't do whatever it was they did. I'm not here to defend Vick, nor am I here to put him down, merely to point out that everyone needs to take a step back and look at their own past from time to time, just because you didn't get caught doesn't mean you never did anything stupid or illegal.|`|8H4loaiVaa	The fact that you asked this question makes me wonder why you are sofa king we todd Ed.<br>  <br>  There are only two types of people that still defend Vick, The racist black person, same person that defended OJ.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	The Kliq really did screw up.  After a century of protecting the business (the illusion that everything we see is completely real) the Kliq destroyed that in one night.  Well, "destroyed" is probably a bit harsh.  Sure, we all "knew" that wrestling is "scripted" (or whatever word we're using this week) but the Kliq proved it.<br>  <br>  For decades, heels and faces stayed separate from each other, especially those feuding with each other.  Separate locker rooms, they didn't talk to each other where a fan might see, except in promos.  Heels and faces didn't socialize in public.  They weren't even allowed to travel together.  Pro wrestlers went to extraordinary lengths to protect kayfabe.  Freddie Blassie even stayed cooped up in his house for several weeks to sell an angle that he'd been blinded by a man he was feuding with.<br>  <br>  The Kliq threw all that away.  Their "goodbye" should have been done in the back, out of sight of the fans.  But the Kliq made a spectacle of it, to stroke their own egos (they knew it would be huge news, even scandalous), to gain notoriety.<br>  <br>  Pro wrestling has to be believable or it becomes a cartoon.  The Kliq showed the world that pro wrestlers are "actors", and the rivalries and feuds are manufactured from the imagination of "writers".<br>  <br>  Had I been in Vince's spot I would have fired Michaels and Triple H right then.  As it turned out, only Triple H was punished.  Hall and Nash had left the WWF, and Michaels was too big a star to punish.  Triple H took the fall for the group, losing his push and spending a year as a jobber, losing to guys far below his talent-level.<br>  <br>  The Kliq didn't care about anybody else, or the WWF, or even the entire wrestling business.  For that one little shot at notoriety they threw everybody in the wrestling business under the bus, completely disregarding a century of tradition, and the hard work of everybody else in the business who went to extraordinary lengths to protect the illusion that everything we see is completely real.<br>  <br>  It's one thing to let the fans speculate, it's another thing entirely to admit "yeah, we've been fooling you all this time; we really ARE only actors".|`|H3nbC71eaa	At the time I saw as something groundbreaking in the WWF. Especially since at that time WWF was very wary of pitting faces vs. faces in matches or heels vs. heels. The matches for the most part had to always be face vs. heel....with a very limited few exceptions.<br>  <br>  So when The Kliq broke kayfabe it was something that really changed things up a bit in the WWF.<br>  <br>  But a wrestler should not break kayfabe on camera or in an arena even if it's not televised. That's part of what makes wrestling, and if the fans aren't really knowing what's going on behind the scenes they won't know what just happened was all about.<br>  <br>  Did McMahon overreact, I don't think so. I mean the only one that was really affected was Triple H, by not being allowed King of the Ring that year, instead given to Stonecold.<br>  <br>  Hall and Nash were out the door anyway, and in the long run even through the way he reacted Triple H still became a star and DX still came along which was very successful for Vince.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day though The Kliq was at fault for what they did.|`|lWoxFHhFaa	At the time no Vince did exactly what needed to be done because at the time Vince had not yet come out and said that certain things are fake and staged.The Kliq screwed up by breaking kayfabe but it ushered in an era of viewer knowledge with the fact that Vince less than a year after came out and said that matches are staged. It helped the WWE because Stone Cold got the King of the Ring that year and his Austin 3:16 speech launched his career. Triple H only suffered for about 18 months. Nash and Hall went out the door and Michaels was the Main Event so not much was done. If it happened now nobody would care|`|UWJinEbIaa	one word:  hypocrite.<br>  <br>  the man who broke kayfabe on a national level got mad that "the boys from the back" broke kayfabe in MSG.|`|ULSUqmeZaa	I guess in that situation, Vince did the right thing. I don't think they screwed up either, they just wanted to have a last moment together in front of the world and Vince understood that. I think he just wished they would've done it a different way. Really, it didn't effect anyone except for Triple H and he took the punishment and things went on.<br>  I think Vince gained a lot of respect for HHH after that though because he gave Triple H an option to leave and go to WCW but he wanted to stay and keep working with Shawn Michaels and the WWF.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	Triple H was the only one to suffer. Seeing as his push was stopped because of it (thus halting his rise to fame), I was pissed off at the reaction.<br>  <br>  They shouldn't have done what they did in the ring, though. They could have waited until they were backstage.|`|WQ14ZZWvaa	I think it was awesome.. Cuz hbk is the s**t.. naww but for real vince really didnt like it though at first. cause the wrestlers broke character..Hbk was the wwe champ at the time so he didnt get introuble at all.. HHH was the only one punished.. Honestly I think vince got over it quick!|`|AA11482019	McMahon and the WWF made way too much of it.|`|NRs72Afxaa	They should of let them wrestle and then they could hug after the match or backstage. Their lucky their still alive.<br>  <br>  When Wcw did that finger poke of doom it quickly went downhill for them.
gm3B6HLNaa	I AGREE 100%!!! I think the team is just trying to tank the rest of the season. I've been a Sabres fan my whole life, and I have to be honest I just don't have it in me any more, I'm on that line where I have to support them (being hometown team and all) and saying to hell with them,mediocre like the BIlls every year I come back to them thinking something is going to change. I love Conley and "IF" he stays healthy it will be great, chances of that happening? As for Kotalik, I can't stand that deal, He's one of the only pieces of talent we had and just like last year we get a 4th line guy who is not worth it. Two things to say to wrap this up LET'S GO BANDITS and GO OILERS!!!!|`|UoUaO52taa	I agree w/LITY though wish we woulda hung on to Kotalik and just used our own pick but not disapointed<br>  <br>  We had no shot at Campbell and trade got us Bernier who turned into a 2nd rounder whio turned into Rivet<br>  <br>  We couldn't trade Drury at the deadline. Why. We were good then. And he simply wanted to go to his hometown team<br>  <br>  MATT: We matched the Rangers offer for Drury. Drury still took NY|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Kotalik had 175 points in 283 games (0.618 pts/game)<br>  Connolly has 132 points in 142 games (0.930 pts/game)<br>  <br>  Buffalo signed the better player, and Connolly's three years younger.<br>  <br>  In the cases of Campbell and Drury, neither player was going to re-sign with Buffalo.  At least with Campbell you got something in return.  regier tried to call Briere and Drury's bluff (both players informed the Sabres before the 2007 trade deadline they would not be resigning) and got nothing as a result.|`|d8ed9e616843c1911be0b6fc7d745d69aa	First off, to respond to a previous responder's comments.  I heard that Drury gave Buffalo a 5 yr/ 25 mil offer at the beginning of 2006-07, and that they refused it.  Also, Drury said that he would have signed in Buffalo if they had matched the Rangers' offer.<br>  <br>  And, I totally agree with you.  Connolly is a complete liability. You never know when he will twist an ankle or (god forbid) get ANOTHER concussion.  This guy has more injuries than a grade-schooler does excuses.  In case you didn't notice, when that one guy (sorry i dont have another tab up) listed the PPG and the games played, Connolly has over 100 less games played than Kotalik over the same amount of time.  He has made almost 9 million over the past 3 years, and he hasnt played in about 150 of the 246 games that have been played.|`|XPFhS1EDaa	Connolly has tons of talent and is a great player when hes not hurt (which i feel will be less often.) The reasons Kotalik, Campbell, and Drury got traded is was because Buffalo is a small market team and they wouldnt have enough money to sign them|`|5p7gpj36aa	Is that where you live? or are you just a big fan of hockey?

Top 21-30: Barbosa, Josh Howard 2nbd rond also had: Kapono, Steve Blake, Mo Williams, Korver, you also have the undrafted Marquis Daniels.<br>  <br>  Overall you see that there were many more serviceable players left in the latter parts for the 2003 draft than the 1996 draft. So there is a big difference, we have yet to see the 2003 class full potential yet so I have to rank the 1996 draft class a bit higher, but I do believe the 2003 draft class is not that shabby.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	1996 was better. There are more solid players in the 1996 draft, more MVPS, more total rings.|`|KYaM65gzaa	1996 but this judgment can be better made once the 2003 guys have ended their primes they still have 8-9 years left of very good basketball who knows wholl win what|`|yWzSiwFtaa	rockets ftw A.I plays SG...but 1996 was better, there was also many other good players not mentioned, and after D-wade lebron carmelo and bosh noone else is really anything|`|4VPrEH8aaa	Definitely 1996|`|GBGcI509aa	Rockets FTW is right.|`|adM9rI7Faa	1996 waz way better it also had ben wallace, big Z of the cavs, shareef abdur raheem, stephon marbury, jermaine oneal, peja, and marcus camby. 1996 was way better. 2003 only had like 6 star players|`|GERlmBIUaa	prob 1996 prob most ppl besides kobe fans (not me) will agree with me but kobe one of the best players...ray allen one of the best pure shooters... best passer in the game steve nash... and prob the best scoring point guard Allen Iverson... best answer plz|`|2YhigCnXaa	as far a character and true leaders Kobe AI class is full of them <br>  <br>  but Wades year is the future an still yet to develop<br>  both are great years but 96 is a different bread<br>  03 is deeper i think|`|RKWTxuz4aa	1996 also had marbury<br>  <br>  so 2003

If you are asking someone/thing more powerful than yourself for help, you might as well ask your sensai or the best person in the room to fight for you. If you are uncertain of the outcome before the fight, do not fight. This is the winning spirit that either dwells within you or does not.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Usually I don't have time to. lol.<br>  <br>  I don't fight in competitions. Those aren't real fights.

I enjoy the rivalry a lot and couldn't imagine being a Yankee fan without having the Red Sox there. It's fun. But I will say that anytime they play each other, the Yankees better beat the Red Sox to a bloody pulp!<br>  <br>  Bonus: February is the worst month. At least November-January I have football.

I don't even know how to describe my feelings about them. Even though it's not as big as the Yankees vs. Red Sox rivalry, I want them to lose every game and I always hope the team they are playing wins. I get really competitive when the A's play them too! <br>  <br>  BQ: It was not very fun and exciting. I had football and basketball too, but nothing can replace my love for baseball. I also play basketball for my school, which took up a big chunk of time and I had lots of homework and school, so it was hard without it, but I tried to have those things occupy my time so I forgot about missing it and not getting so sad.<br>  <br>  Good Question.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	I am a Brewers fan, and my feelings towards our rivals (Cubs) is a dislike/respect/understand them one. Dislike because I just want to beat them and it's always a battle. Respect/understanding because they are a team who just can't seem to get to the end, just like the Crew. They are much like us in the end.<br>  <br>  BQ: Tough, but I am a football fan to. That being said, the offseason from baseball is the worst 4 months of the year. Plus it's Winter to add to the torture. With football you know Winter's on it's way...Baseball brings Spring weather and 162 games of joy.<br>  <br>  "Get up! Get up! Get outta here!

PwED69Isaa	Since I do not get NHL Gamecenter, I can't answer with 100% certainty. However, I can very safely say that you will not be charged when the season is over. I know people that have gotten the MLB version, and the payment goes from the start of the season to the end of the season, not April to April. I don't see how they could legally charge you in the offseason without telling you that they will. Even still, I would email them and ask just to be 100% sure.

Z1Gx19rBaa	try using different foot placement  and stuff|`|MFw1gZjYaa	Maybe your feet change positions in the air or you kick it a bit while taking off. The trick someone gave is that when you ollie, always try to bring your feet up to the same height in the air and center them in the middle of you board for a smoother landing. I ride regular too so your foot position seems fine to me.

This ritual can involve stepping away from the plate, tightening your glove, adjusting your grip on the bat, shaking your arms, legs body, etc., hitting your shoes/the ground with the bat, planting your feet, or adjusting your helmet. You must repeat this ritual of superstition before every pitch, whether the previous pitch was a foul-off, a swing for strike, a strike looking, or a ball.|`|8iQcbgVTaa	golf- even if you have won the match, you always let the other player finish out putting before you celebrate.<br>  <br>  football- both teams get on a knee with their helmets off if a player is injured

The contract last up to the end of next season. Personally, I think he should give it another go after his contract is up since he is rejuvenated and playing exceptionally well it is eerie just when yu written him off. He should end his career where it all began in Orlando. He took them to the NBA Finals once combined w/ the new Superman in DH12 and a former Laker rival of the Kings in Turk they can take the Magic to the Finals again.|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	i dont know but i think he should let dwight howard take over the center spot for the nba

He's still only 19 years old and has showed flashes at times. it'll probably be 3-4 years but he will eventually be an all-star he's very raw..|`|nz220kO4aa	To be honest no. I dont think his game will make him a all-star since he doesnt really do anything that makes you mind blow like many players his size.|`|YQLNqgnWaa	possibly, but i dont think so because he will need to become stronger and more of a force downlow if he wants to be a PF|`|xLCgqot8aa	yea he can he's extremly long and athletic if he keeps on workin on his game he surely can be an all star|`|9Ay4Z85Taa	honestly..

AND HE HAVE BEEN GIVEN LOTS OF OPPORTUNITY IN EVERY BATTING POSITIONS BUT STILL HE FAILED. <br>  MANY PEOPLE MAY CLAIM THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN CHANCE AT HIGHER BATTING ORDER. BUT I WILL DISAGREE WITH THIS BECAUSE HE HAS BEEN GIVEN MANY OPPORTUNITY AT HIGHER ORDER FOR AS EX-IND-PAK-BANG SERIES, IND-PAK-SRI-BANG SERIES, IND-SRI SERIES, 1 OR 2 MATCHES IN IND-ENG AND AGAIN IN IND-SRI. BUT HE CONTINUE TO FAILS AND FAILED VERY MISERABLY. <br>  IF WE RECALL HIS LAST BEST PERFORMACE, THEN THAT IS IN LAST YR BEFORE AT AUS-IND-SRI SERIES. <br>  AND HE HAD ACHIEVE ONLY 2 FIFTY AND NOT EVEN A HUNDRED.<br>  I DON'T ON WHICH REGARD HE IS GETTING SO MUCH OF CHANCES, IS HE TENDULKAR, DRAVID OR GANGULY. <br>  EVEN IF THESE PLAYERS FAILED LIKE ROHIT SHARMA THEN THEY ALSO KEPT OUT OF THE TEAM.<br>  EVEN IF GANGULY, DRAVID, SEHWAG ALSO DON'T GET SO MANY CHANCES LIKE SHARMA WHEN THEY WERE DROPPED FROM THE TEAM.<br>  ITS UNFAIR ANY PLAYER WHO IS PERFORMING WELL AT DOMESTIC LEVEL AND NOT GETTING OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY FOR THE COUNTRY AND WHERE AS ROHIT SHARMA IS GETTING MORE AND MORE OPPORTUNITY EVEN IF HE FAILS MISERABLY.<br>  WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHETHER ROHIT CAN PLAY BETTER ON NEXT MATCH.

I has repeatedly addressed by concerns about his selection in to this fairly good team and have asked many Q's,regarding the performance of this guy, hope the selectors just stop being parcel and start selecting based on performance, this guy like  very weak foot movements and very poor selection of shots, and also do note that the only performance that he carry was a once upon a time performance in T-20 against Australia and his performance in Australia and every performance after that has been failure. In this T-20 match the platform was so laid out to him by Sehwag where, he had no pressure,where he just had to play his shots  right, but he blew it big time for the team, like always!!!!!!!!!!! <br>           Hope they don't select him for any of the matches here on and hope the selectors realize that they have made a big mistake!!!|`|BJNWnzDIaa	Lol at deeps, Rohit hardly scored 3 half centuries in his 2year international career but still he is a class player. Its perplexing to guess what his brain is filled with. Comparing Rohit with Sachin is like saying I bat better than Sachin.<br>  <br>  Whenever I see his name in the squad I just want to hit my head against the wall. But now I found a relief by thinking that Indian team will have  only 10 members. So I advice you the same.|`|QtdO1RlQaa	Until he hits form!<br>  Dude..... Rohit Sharma is OUT OF FORM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  If Sachin is out of form, if Raina is out of form, if Yuvi is out of form, the whole world is present to sympathise with them, but Rohit Sharma, NOBODY??????????????????????????????????...<br>  Enough is enough to all those who've called the selectors to drop Rohit...... <br>  FORM IS TEMPORARY, CLASS IS PERMANENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT: What is funny here is some ppl want Robin Uthappa (who only knows to either SLOG or play the PADDLE SWEEP) to replace Rohit. And the very same after sometime would want Rohit if hes back in form to replace the slogger...... KNOW UR CRICKET before u speak people..... On a given day Uthappa may do better than Rohit but on the long run Rohit is a MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH better bat than Virat Kohli, Robin Uthappa or any other slogger six hitter........<br>  <br>  One more thing..... Rohit Sharma is a stroke maker who are very few nowadays.... And Rohit Sharma will be the one who will hold the innings together without hitting out.... He hasnt been able to so far but im sure that he WILL in the future...<br>  <br>  @OYE: I think ur gonna start bleeding, thats the type of player Rohit is. And pls pls stop saying such things, its like begging a murderer to spare a person's life, he'll make a comeback pls! He will and after that be one of the best in the world! But that one comeback is something we're all waiting for.....<br>  If u can compare Yuvi to Dada why not Sachin to Rohit?  Thanx for ur advise Im not taking it..... I have full faith in Rohit and even if he has to sit out of the Indian side and evn out of the Ranji Mumbai side, I'll be sure he'll make a comeback....<br>  <br>  @EVERYONE: If it werent for Rohit, India wouldnt have made it into the semis of the T20 WC which we later won and we all are so proud of............<br>  <br>  @HANEEF: Have u tried him or something?<br>  <br>  @Ria: Yuvraj? If hes in form, centuries pour in, if hes out of form, some 1-1.5 years waste of time, but its fine because its YUVRAJ.

He should be dropped and other players should be given a chance. Robin Uthappa, too is being denied a chance. He's a good player.<br>  <br>  Edit: @ Deeps - Everyone has different opinions and one should try and respect that. It’s stupidity to compare Sachin or Yuvi with Rohit Sharma. If Sachin, Yuvi etc. were out of form, they are given a chance coz they have proved time and again that they are worthy of being selected in the team. I would’ve given a longer explanation, but I don’t need to, you can just read the answer of rahul s. I agree with him.|`|ZT9I6uJLaa	Ur absolutely rite, i never liked Rohit Sharma frm the onset...........he is a guy battin with the help of luck and stays in the team despite low grade performances due to biased selection........he is technically weak on the leg side.....vry weak !!

He's not your everyday post up guy. He prefers jumpshots. He isn't gonna dominate the paint. THink of the greatest PFs to ever play the game: Duncan, Malone, etc....

bhNT8SQsaa	I'm a righty.<br>  Now depending on your preferences and the prior pitches you've thrown it may differ but for a:<br>  1-2 pitch I'd hate to see a curve inside. Those can get tricky and swinging at anything close means I may swing and miss. So the curve works good here.<br>  <br>  For the 2-2 I would hate to see the changeup. Normally pitchers throw their most comfortable pitch here which is usually a fastball (typically 4 seam fastball).

6dc142d6debf8ac8ecf1a989c32e7a34aa	A while before that match, Shawn Michaels was attacked by several people outside of a bar and suffered severe injuries during the altercation.  There were actual police reports and medical reports that substantiated the attack.  <br>  <br>  The mid-match collapse was a gimmick set into that match shortly after his medical clearance and return to further push the injury and give him more time off.  For awhile, WWE denied that the collapse was fake, but had recently come clean about the whole in-ring incident.<br>  <br>  It was the WWE once again taking advantage of someone's actual injury and turning it into a story to push a character or plotline.

How good is it for Cricket !?<br>  <br>  In my opinion the teams these days are much closer, I doubt any team will dominate the sport until after the World Cup, maybe not even then.<br>  <br>  To answer your question I hope Australia can turn the result their way. They have the personalities to do it. This is the least experienced team since 1988 when we drew with the Windies in South Australia, That was the start of the Aussie's domminance, I hope this is not the end.|`|AA0L7X2Oaa	africa is winning now<br>  <br>  panting becoming only ing after nanga panga with pant gone|`|7dJvSe2Raa	It will be a tough match normally at the Wanderers the ball swings a bit so it may be hard for the batsmen plus the weather here in Joburg has not been great the over head conditions may favour swing bowling further so I think which ever teams batsmen apply themselves best will give them an advantage it may be my bias but I'm leaning towards South Africa.<br>  <br>  I definitely think there will be a result but it has been raining a lot in Joburg almost everyday and big thunder storms too so I hope the match isnt rain effected to much because that is the only way I see a draw.|`|M5qA558gaa	Looks like SA to me though I say it myself. I was in Australia over the holiday season and, as a South African, my life was in danger because of all the matches we were winning. We didn't even have Gibbs. Ozzie needs a new captain. Before they can get anywhere.|`|xabjLTKqaa	I think SA will wrap up the match as Australia is not in a good form and SA is a bit confident of winning the match.|`|rSUSwox2aa	SA

The crowds in the 2004 playoffs broke the existing decibel record at an NHL game held by the old Chicago Stadium (which at one time had 6 of the 7 loudest crowds in NHL history and the 5 loudest crowds in NBA history<br>  <br>  2) Best Jerseys.

Personally for me it is the Bell Centre in Montreal.  The players love it too as every year it wins the players poll as best arena to play in (7 straight years)<br>  <br>  5) Better Team: Right now that would be San Jose.  Although Detroit can take the top spot if they win tonight (Colorado is leading 1-0)<br>  <br>  6) Most History: Montreal has 100 years of it and celebrating strong!<br>  <br>  7) Western Conference Champ: I picked Detroit at the start of the year, and I'll stick with them<br>  <br>  8) Eastern Conference Champ: I picked Montreal at the start of the year, but barring a disaster, it should be Boston<br>  <br>  9) I picked Detroit at the start of the year, but I think Boston can do it now.<br>  <br>  10) I had a Montreal-Detroit final at the start.

Im not arguing Im just saying. The economy will be better (knock on wood) in a few years. It would have to be more than that before the NBA gets rid of a team. WNBA+different story.<br>  BUT just to throw it out there. Charlotte n Thunder.<br>  Also you got the wrong idea.

RS3fjNboaa	That would be ridiculous. They already sold the farm to get Haynesworth, and now you want them to give up two first round picks for Peppers? Haynesworth and Peppers are both very inconsistent players. Why would you want both of them on the same team? The Redskins need to realize that they need to build a team, not buy a team. It hasn't worked for them in the past. Even Jerry Jones isn't as bad about that as Dan Snyder.|`|HvDTEsBRaa	i doubt it because they wasted a lot of money on that fat overrated cow haynseworth.|`|ntLUHiTAaa	no peppers isnt that kind of guy some plays you just see him being one on one blocked and just gives up.|`|MPDgKgIxaa	Would be a great defensive line, and it may happen.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.c...</a><br>  <a href="http://americanfootballpredictions.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...</a>|`|bxnMQQMJaa	The REdskins will go 8-8, with or without Pepers.

Rarely do elite players that get monster paychecks/ trade deals go to Washington and do well.....Dan Snyder is a TOOL. Why can't NFL franchises learn to follow in the Steelers footsteps.

GO STEELERS!!!!|`|doFdrgfKaa	With a moron as their owner, I would not be the least bit surprised if they got Julius Peppers one way or another.  Who knows, dirty rich Dan Snyder who doesn't know how to handle money properly may pay Peppers EVEN MORE than Haynesworth!<br>  <br>  Proud to be a Deadskins hater.|`|A6AJ6nxLaa	the problem with the redskins is that they get all this talent, but cant do anything with it. take Jason Taylor, he was terrible last year, lets face it. sure the skins could probably get peppers, but he wouldnt be very good|`|nfLd3ngraa	I would say this years 1st and next years 2nd if im the Panthers i take that in a heartbeat. Because you don't know if peppers will sign next year.|`|fCx74VHlaa	I highly doubt they could get Julius <br>  because the Panthers just franchised him and <br>  made a contract with him.|`|6ZbAM4Jaaa	Tostado tries not to imagine that...scary stuff|`|YFFhkRSdaa	slim no cap room|`|ZS8eBOfZaa	they wont get him I dont think.  He'll go to the west coast.
WST15Sm5aa	First of all, its your first race. No one expects you to be phenomonal, so don't stress out over it. Second of all, you will have to try to stick with the leaders in the first lap, draft right behind them. In the second lap though, try and establish a good position in 2nd or 3rd. In the last 100 meters, try to use a good strong kick, and sprint as hard as you can then so that you can really race the leaders to the finish.<br>  <br>  And for your other question, yes, it would be unfair to the person who now has your spot, and it might give you a bad reputation for not being able to make up your mind. Just do the relay at the next meet.
MzSVuWCmaa	I have met and got autographs from Mick Foley-nice guy. Hulk Hogan-Talked to no one and his manager pushed everyone through the picture line.

H3nbC71eaa	Jericho is the more talented in the ring, Randy Orton is just ok in the ring...he just has some well known moves in the RKO and that Punt kick...and he's a good seller. But Jericho has a whole lot of talent and ability when it comes to a wrestling match.<br>  <br>  IMO, Jericho is the better heel. yeah he has his share of fans, but he gets a whole lot of boos from the fans...which is what a heel is supposed to get when he does his job. He just knows the things to say or do to just get you to want somebody to beat the hell out of him.<br>  <br>  Orton is a heel that doesn't get a lot of heel heat, he has a lot of cheers in the buildings. He doesn't make the audience really hate him, so he's not as good at getting heat as Jericho is as a heel..<br>  <br>  WWE is pushing Orton as the next superstar wrestler, but I think Jericho is the better talent of the two.|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Y2J is a much better wrestler and on the microphone Orton is mad overrated at certain points. That's just me, feel free to disagree if you want.|`|444pPdy5aa	all-time:Y2J<br>  <br>  currently:Orton|`|NRs72Afxaa	Chris Jericho. The man can wrestle, and can play as a face or heel well.

Y2J would be much more popular if he had a better storyline.|`|BcWs38MWaa	I THINK CENA, UNDERTAKER AND HHH R THE BEST BUT TO ANSWER UR QUESTION...<br>  WELL I DISLIKE BOTH VERY VERY VERY MUCH BUT I HAVE TO ADDMIT RANDYS P|_|NK AZ$ ORTON IS PRETTY GOOD|`|qmFrJdaXaa	c'mom man is common sense that Y2J is better he has more experience and a has more championships in his background|`|DvNZr4TAaa	y2j|`|1JywgkyMaa	i'll give you a hint,he hears voices in his head|`|F3VjJAdiaa	As a wrestler it's Y2J, getting the bigger push is Orton, But i'd rather see Jericho in a wrestling match any day.|`|2FKHNIB2aa	Jericho = First Undisputed Champion, Rock Star, TV Host, New York Times bestselling Author, Film Star, and Years of in ring experience.<br>  <br>  Orton = WWE Superstar<br>  <br>  in short<br>  Jericho = AWESOME<br>  Orton = crap
DUJnkYDzaa	Don't Listen to them they really dated in real life, she cheated on Matt Hardy in real life with Edge, but Matt Hardy made it public so the <br>  WWE relesed him, but he returned on the condition that they could use the whole relationship and cheating thing as a storyline and he agreed. But then Lita retired from wrestling and they split up and then she started dating a guy in her band.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	When he realized that he wasn't prepared for his marriage to end in divorce, which is exactly what would have happened.

BiBzayg6aa	From what they explain in their rules, the price is only determined upon an "encounter" between a buyer and a seller, and not by the player real life performance.<br>  So if you are willing to pay $8 for Pujols , and some one who owns one of his contracts is willing to sell him in this price, than you have a deal.<br>  This is interesting concept for a Fantasy Baseball game, where instead of paying an entry fee, you just buy your desired players, the logical driving force "behind" the market is the "need" of different "users" to place certain fantasy players in their rooster in order to compete and have a chance to grab the big prize ($10k).<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  Hope that helps
1z7M3Tntaa	I'ts fun to wacth dude, is that a crime?|`|fmUGHvgHaa	ok magic is fake but people watch it because its entertainment same us wwe|`|a5hNA3Kxaa	Wrestling is not just about the wrestling. Hence the 'E' which stands for entertainment. There is more to pro wrestling that just the wrestling, there is acting involved too, and there are storyline. So the matches are pre determined.... there are still going out there and preforming in front a live crowd, these guys have to stay in shape and be athletic, they go out there and pull off cool moves. Asking why we watch fake wrestling is like asking why do you watch movies? It is the same exact thing, just like wrestlers, actors have lines to remember and have story lines to follow. Just like wrestling, the storyline is fake. And don't say there different because they are not. We all know that story lines in movies are fake, and that goes for wrestling and if you didn't know that you have to realize a thing or two.|`|8t1Osybyaa	tv show and movies are fake why do people watch them<br>  <br>  for the entertainment|`|b8568740e59872f29e957e1ca020af9caa	If "Seinfeld" and "Friends" are such retarded shows,why do they watch them ?|`|7WmH2Qeqaa	if action movies are fake, then why do you watch it|`|AA11837489	ummm is this a serious question?<br>  W W E let's break it down for the slow people <br>  the 1st W means world<br>  the 2nd W means wrestling<br>  finally the all important E which stands for ENTERTAINMENT<br>  pretty simple word though it is a long world <br>  entertainment you know kinda like u asking this question for your entertainment. self explanitory  entertainment.<br>  have a nice day.|`|nOkYi6WNaa	Movies and tv shows are fake and people watch them. It's the same thing. ENTERTAINMENT!! Only wrestling gives them a more aggressive type of entertainment that you kind of believe is more true because wrestlers are constantly in character.|`|H3nbC71eaa	Because if it wasn't fake then BeeRad wouldn't have the same question to ask over and over in an effort to try to annoy users in the wrestling section to no avail.|`|g3wGxdobaa	wrestling is fake if i hit u in the head with a metal bar or baseball bat you would be knock out. wwe and stuff like that is for entertaainment purposes only. actors fake everything|`|SJJEF5Vyaa	Because we dont like to watch guys on top of eachother in a cage.|`|Voo58gJCaa	how many times are losers going to ask this question?

LEQowzHCaa	No, I wasn't surprised...<br>  <br>  Antoine Vermette gives the Blue Jackets good secondary scoring and he will get some good ice time with Nash and Huselius.<br>  <br>  Olli Jokinen would've looked good on the first line (Nash needed someone to get the puck to him), but they'd have to pay a heavy price...<br>  <br>  Steve Mason has been brilliant so the Jackets really didn't need Leclaire.<br>  <br>  I think this trade will help the Blue Jackets push for a playoff spot but I was really surprised that Antropov wasn't traded....<br>  <br>  I actually heard a rumour like this....<br>  <br>  TO COLUMBUS: Nik Antropov + Anton Stralman<br>  TO TORONTO: Pascal Leclaire + 2nd rounder<br>  <br>  <br>  Overall, Jokinen would've been an excellent fit for the Blue Jackets|`|WshIrCo2aa	Sure Jokinen would've been a better fit, he's a far better player.  But they got Vermette for almost nothing, they didn't need Leclaire anymore, and Jokinen would've cost them a lot more.  Let's not kid ourselves, here.  If the Jackets make the playoffs, they will not contend for the Cup, with or without Jokinen.  There's no reason, then to give up what they would've had to in order to get him for the next month, only to have him become a free agent and eligible to walk at season's end.  <br>  <br>  I really expected them to do more at the deadline, but they really did make a great deal for Vermette.|`|pUus16BYaa	How the hell would they get Jokinen without trading an arm and a leg? Frankly I think they should have taken Antropov from the Leafs. Jokinen would be great to have but we really could only trade LeClaire and are 2nd round pick we might have had to throw in Huselius or another important player just to get him... so not worth it.|`|4uKnRPEjaa	He would have been a better fit but colubus probably didn't want to give what Phoenix was asking. Phoenix probably would have want Vorachek Filatov and a draft pick or something similar|`|1p1Jj7LDaa	I watched Olli play for many years down here in Florida. <br>  <br>  A. The Ballard/Jokinen trade was a great move by Florida.<br>  B. Olli doesn't play 100% and isn't worth it to make a move to get.
cNS1oSCgaa	That's good, but how long can you run in one stretch?  The longer you can make it the more you increase your stamina.  If you do this everyday, you'll see that you will soon be able to run 3.1 miles in 14:00|`|hL3eS2zKaa	Yes, you have a good chance of making it. But work on the running skills, you need some work on endurance from the looks of it.|`|9a3fC9mOaa	3.1 miles in 17 is pretty bad... as for wrestling, it depends what state, in florida the wrestlers don't go anywhere because florida isn't a wrestling state... the midwestern states are the really good schools|`|27Sh9Dyvaa	Yea by 12th grade you might have a Division II scholarship for wrestling Ithaca collage is a pretty good wrestling school and same with Norwich U|`|TYpoaLXnaa	good at division 2

Plus He is 45 years old and never was a good wrestler. I do not see Boogeyman working with Tna or Roh whatsoever. Japan should seem they likely object for him, or just retire and find a new life.|`|AjSQpVqTaa	The boogey man was the best gimic in the wwe and a really great wrestler. I would of liked to see him win the ecw championship from swagger. I don;t think he could have gotten any better single titles than that but it would have been interesting if he won the tag titles with kane or the undertaker.|`|1JywgkyMaa	this is what vince said,boogeyman,your gimmick is too scary for kids,rather than just give you a new gimmick,i'm going to release you for absoloutly no reason what so ever,i wish you the best in future endeavors|`|hL3eS2zKaa	I never really paid attention to him much, to be honest. I only watched a few of his matches. I think that they should keep him and debut him as someone else, we cant see the real him, his true pontential. They shouldve gave him another shot.|`|aRDQQL8Oaa	I believe the reason why he was released that soon (even though its only been like 3 years, not so soon) is because his gimmick does not really fit in with what WWE wants right now, as they are gearing more toward younger people and like kids and stuff.  Evidence of this is the recent rating change from TV-14 to TV-PG on all 3 shows, and a much cleaner show with story lines that do not have a lot of concepts that adults would not want a kid to know.  If they make a switch back, then i believe they might bring him back, or a gimmick like his, but it is a logical idea to let him go, according to what their goal seems to be.

BB6HGbnPaa	That's what a coach is for. It depends on what your running. Short distance you would try to work on your speed and time. While long distance you work on your endurance. I'm not a short distance runner but you can run at least 2 miles if your doing long distance.
DPmSBrqkaa	The Flames have a great chance of going all the way. They made the best moves of the day and are very strong now.<br>  <br>  If the Sharks keep playing the way they have been for the past month, then you have a very good chance of taking over second place in the West, behind Detroit.<br>  <br>  Good luck the rest of way!|`|aef847695705ae92e6fb124df08082f4aa	Well, a Flames fan since the mid-80's, I've learned to approach the Flames playoff expectation a bit cautiously. They SHOULD go far, but they SHOULD have gone far many other times in the past. <br>  <br>  the trades: Jokinen for Lombardi was a good one, I think. Everyone keeps talking about how much potential Lombardi has. I say, he's been with the team since before the 04 Cup run, and that's plenty of time to realize some of his potential. Time for him to move on. Leopold for that other guy (can't remember his name) and a draft pick was alright. They get a depth defenceman who's played on the team before, so I'm alright with it.<br>  <br>  All in all, I think it was a very good and exciting day for the Flames and their fans. Go Flames Go!

rTCYEHQhaa	Do you know the story of Indian Bob Johnson?<br>  <br>  My Dad knew Indian Bob Johnson as an old man.  There are few men in the history of baseball who loved the game more than Johnson.  Johnson played in the minors for 10 seasons before he made a major league roster.  In that time, everyone and their brother told Johnson to give it up. Johnson kept playing, pay check to pay check.  This was back in the days of independent leagues, where players made just barely enough to live off of.  At the age of 27, Connie Mack, hall of fame manager of the Philadelphia Athletics signed Johnson as a cheaper option to traded star Bucketfoot Al Simmons in 1933.  He made an immediate impact in the league, finishing 15th in MVP voting his rookie season.  He would finish top 10 in MVP voting 3 times and was an all star 8 times in his 13 year major league career. He played in the majors until he was 40, when he moved to Tacoma, WA to manage and play for the Tacoma Tigers.  An all-time great man, who loved the game and stuck to it.

I like this idea...|`|paIUgtLRaa	Tony is the most irritating voice and announcer ever. Even worse than Madden, and THAT'S saying something.<br>  <br>  Madden is the second worst. The Pro Bowl could be televised by NBC, Madden wouldn't be there, but all you would need is a audio tape of his past "performances" and you'd be fine. He says the same thing over and over again. He's Mr. Obvious.<br>  <br>  Tirico is good, and Jaws is my favorite. Tirico is a great play-by-play, and Jaws almost always has insightful stuff to say. Not the recycled garbage that spews forth from Madden.<br>  <br>  I like most of the commentators from CBS, and a couple of FOX. Sorry, but their names elude me right now.|`|DSo3cUjeaa	I don't like any of them. Don't have any suggestions for replacements. Dan Marino maybe?<br>  <br>  Also, to those who answered before me, Al Michaels and John Madden are no longer Monday Night announcers. Hopefully Madden doesn't come back either. Al Michaels is good and I would like to see him back in.|`|GmRscBkPaa	OMG Kornheiser must go...So annoying, and does'nt know sh!t about football.  Terico is fine.  Jaws is sometimes a bit windy, but I know he knows his x's and o's, so I dont mind.<br>  <br>  I agree Sunday's line up on NBC is the best.|`|v42nC3F2aa	John Madden is the worst. Listening to him is like listening to a retarded drunk with ADD.|`|u6UMCP8kaa	they all suck <br>  they cant announce they r almost as bad as a dying goose that just gott suck but jaws is the worst|`|zhH36xEHaa	Cant stand any of them, Kornheiser and Wilbon shoulda stuck to P.T.I....<br>  B.Q: AL MICHAELS....the G.O.A.T of football announcers, hell even announcers period.|`|KTp27Fokaa	Wilbon doesn't do MNF...<br>  <br>  I don't really like Kornheiser. I watch the MNF game last year between the 49ers and Cards. Tony said the game was over when the Cards had the ball with 1:30 to go about, but the Niners had 3 timeouts. As we know, the Niners very well could have won that game at the end. Shows his footbal knowledge.|`|9f2391ebf6a1c505bb9421899963d771aa	Tirico sucks, Kornheiser is ok but he would be better as a halftime show guy. Jaworski has too much going on as far as what he is trying to do and explain whenever the game is going on from play to play unless there is a timeout or something. He almost seemingly wants to slow it down to explain every little detail of every single movement on the field for every single play. Madden and Michaels kill me because they want certain teams to be better than what they are (constantly tell everyone SD should be better than what they are).<br>  <br>  I would have Mike Breen (from ESPN's NBA coverage) on play by play, with Tom Jackson on color.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	I don't like JAWS Tony and Wilbon I like but JAWS he is a jackass, I wish he would be replaced by either Emmitt Smith or Steve Young they are better.|`|ntLUHiTAaa	replace Tony with Chris Collinsworth he is a good announcer.|`|yuGhmhGuaa	You Hate somedody announcing football? you need help
c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Good move for Dallas. Yet some part of me wishes my team would go after him. Not sure why.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	I really hope whoever T.O. goes on to play for wins the Super Bowl. If Dallas fans aren't already demoralized about their team's lack of 21st century success, T.O. hoisting the Lombardi would really be a thorn at their sides.|`|exOOXAkBaa	He's going to be a Charger!!!!!!!

XuNbQI0Baa	Andrew Bynum.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	What is so good about Bierdrins? There stats really aren't that different. Sorry I will take Bynum any day of the week.|`|P93I8CHtaa	obviously bynum|`|eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	ight. bynum is only popular because he's playing with gasol and kobe, he would be an average center. biedrins is definitely underrated. 13ppg, 12rpg. biedrins is probably the best center in the nba at ball handling, and he has a amazing post up shot and can shoot with both hands. of course i am going to say biedrins because he is on my favorite team, like laker fans would say bynum, but really try and watch him play, he's a really good center.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Andris Biedrins easily.|`|z5rlyGXNaa	wow not even a question.<br>  Andrew Bynum n o doubt about it|`|zdGI2RVYaa	Are u serious?<br>  LAkers 4 liFE|`|lbQYYHMbaa	oh boy we got ourselves a grade A ?um Juggling Stat Prostitute here.<br>  <br>  He's gunna wait for everybody to say <br>  <br>  <br>  BYNUM<br>  BYNUM<br>  BYNUM<br>  BYNUM<br>  <br>  then say "AHAHHAhaha Dumb hoes, andris beidrins has better rebounds and FG% etc etc"<br>  <br>  But he doesn't see logic<br>  <br>  he doesn't see that the Golden state Warriors have a starting PF that is 6'5", and even if you tell him this, he is too stupid to realize how that will dramatically inflate a guy who is 6'9"s rebounds on the same team.<br>  <br>  he also doesn't realize that Andrew Bynum Shares the ball with KObe Bryant and Pau Gasol, that is going to put a dampering on your stat line no matter who you are.<br>  <br>  Despite this, Bynum plays about a minute and a half minute less but stil racks up more points, more blocks, and way better FT%.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The truth is there is no comparison with Andrew Bynum the NBA's next dominant Center to clash with Dwight Howard, Andris Biedrins would be behind DJ MBENGA if he were on the Lakers roster PERIOD|`|vnYhL5ZXaa	Andris Biedrins<br>  Andris averages more blocks and assists<br>  Last time I checked Andris wasn't the one with a torn right MCL|`|j0YJX8U6aa	lol<br>  <br>  ur kidding<br>  <br>  Bynum is a future All-Star<br>  how dare u compare him to Biedarasdajhfbajhkbfdhagbfga

c17x6L4baa	I'm glad Warner has signed.  That should go a long way toward returning the Cards to the play-offs.  With only about 40 players under contract, a lot of important pieces need to be fit into place.  But,  the big piece is in place.<br>  <br>  The Boldin thing seems to be confusing just about everyone for some reason.  He is under contract through the 2010 season.  They don't have to get him.  They will not lose him.  <br>  <br>  They can renegotiate his contract if they want.  They can trade him to someone to fill a greater need if they want.  They can just keep him at his current pay if they want.|`|mkueXAKoaa	Im glad that Warner made the decision to stay with the Arizona Cardinals. He has said numerous times that he obviously wants to win one more SuperBowl and the Cardinals are his best shot. He was visiting with the 49ers and almost signed with them (which i think would have been a really dumb decision because they arn't even close to being play-off contenders) but im just glad he came to his senses and signed with the Cardinals were he has a legitimate shot to go back to the SuperBowl.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	The NFC West will still be weak unless SEA pulls it together. I think they repeat winning the division.<br>  <br>  Boldin? I think he's gone.<br>  <br>  But the big loser of the day.........Mr.Leinart.

7HRLYfjaaa	baseball players are so overpaid paid i would take the league minimum  if i got a chance to play in the mlb|`|fKAnnQeWaa	Well, there are many things that I would like to do. I'll keep my spending to a private method just so that people don't talk about how I go crazy with cash.<br>  <br>  First off, I would set my parents up with property and a huge house. Give them enough to keep them set for the time. So about 10-15 Million will go off there.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I would pay for my college education. <br>  <br>  Third, I would set up a nice property with 2 cars for myself. One sportscar just for fun and one sedan for professional methods. That's about 2-3 million right there.<br>  <br>  That would leave with about 27 million so I would invest 5 million into a good company. <br>  <br>  That's about 22 million left. <br>  <br>  Save 10 million. Live off the other 12 million.|`|4293a0ff696620f3c5a721afbba4df64aa	Write a two million dollar check to my agent.<br>  <br>  Pu $18 mil on the side so I can fork it over to Uncle Sam at then end of the month (1st quarter 09 taxes).<br>  <br>  As for the other 25 mil? Well ...can't put it in the stock market. Can't invest it with all those Madoff types around. Might try saving it but the bank could fail and the FDIC would only cover me to 100 grand.<br>  <br>  I could try and give it away, but after I get past the two million dollar lifetime exemption, I got to pay an additional 46 cents on every dollar I give as a gift for more taxes.<br>  <br>  I think I'd just buy a lot of land. I understand they aren't making any more ot that.|`|3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	Season Tickets to all the Cleveland Teams games, Season tickets to every Nascar Race.

ehMPOlefaa	The game is still and always will be bigger than any one player.  Or even group of players.  It will survive this so called "era" and regain it's popularity.  Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. - A. Dufrain|`|lQYR7I9Taa	No offense, but a-rod was never considered the "white knight."  With everything that has happened with that guy, I wasn't surprised when I found out that he was taking steroids.  If you want to call anyone a "white knight," maybe look at Jeter or Wright from the Mets.|`|uYleyIDBaa	well steroids will make you stronger of course, but that doesn't automatically make you more skilled baseball.

If you are then this is a mute point. <br>  While all this steroids scandal was going on and everybody knew or atleast had a suspicious that these players were taking steroids baseball was at it's highest peak making money having record attendance. If it wasn't because congress got into this whole steroid mess baseball wouldn't had done anything about it because they didn't care. MLB was only thinking about the money they were making. I'm still going to watch baseball because i love the game. Is this steroid era something shameful to the game? yes but baseball is going to pass through it just like they have in the past with other things and i'm still going to enjoy the game like i have always done since i was a little girl.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Baseball briefly had Hope in 1907, when Sam pitched 1/3 of an inning for the Athletics: <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/h/hopesa01.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.baseball-reference.com/h/hope...</a><br>  <br>  Baseball again had Hope in the 1990s, when John saw action in four seasons for the Pirates: <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/h/hopejo01.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.baseball-reference.com/h/hope...</a><br>  But he was last seen in the minors in 1997, and again baseball was without Hope.<br>  <br>  And baseball saw signs of Hope in recent years, when Travis was in the Mets organization, but he never made it to the show: <a href="http://minors.baseball-reference.com/players.cgi?pid=22073" rel="nofollow">http://minors.baseball-reference.com/pla...</a><br>  <br>  So, alas, right now baseball is indeed without Hope.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "I'll NEVER abandon Hope!

mkueXAKoaa	Another good win by the Knicks, spreading the ball out and getting everyone involved in the game. Hughes was on fire with his three's and jump shots, Galanari had a strong game as well as Lee and Harrington. Im glad Hughes finally got hot because he was really struggling his first couple games, but in his last 3 games he has been the spark that ignited the Knicks to play well.|`|bxnMQQMJaa	good game, good win..........but the Knicks suck, and IF they make the playoffs, they'll get swept in the First round......oh, they aren't going to make the playoffs are they?? The Bobcats beat the Lakers.....|`|zLBDmcsnaa	HAHA word you know it!!! <br>  = ]]] <br>  uhm if anyone has the chance answer my question about the knicks tonight lol|`|vzYJJCdqaa	bueno|`|JD5NQxeNaa	D'lo The Rooster Gallo is what it is!!!! Hell of a game and Hughes is playing like the Golden State, Philadelphia, and Washington Hughes. Not, like the Cleveland or Chicago Hughes. D.Lee is a beast and star in the making as usual and Harrington and Chandler played well. Wilcox was scrappy and Duhon bounced back well except for that missed ft down the stretch. Good collective team effort tonight.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Terrible game for the Knicks.  I mean winning is great, but how do you go from up 16 in the 4th to barely winning.  Don't get me wrong, as a Knicks fan I'm delighted for the win, but they have to do something about these lapses that either let teams get back in the game or let them blow us out.<br>  <br>  It was the same in some of the previous games.  Against the Heat we had the game won then just stopped playing, taking bad shots, not protecting the ball, not playing D, and not only let them back in it, but gave the game away.  The game before against the Sixers was the opposite.  They decide to not play in the first half, get down by 20+ and spend the whole 2nd half fighting back to make it a game.<br>  <br>  Without these total lapses the Knicks could actually be a good team.  I mean seriously, I can think of at least 10 games the Knicks should have won.  Add 10 wins and you're looking at a 4th seed (we just proved tonight we can beat the 4th seeded Hawks) instead of missing the playoffs.  As much as everyone says the Knicks suck, if they can make the playoffs and actually play a full 48, I think they have a chance against anyone, and yes, that includes the Cavs and Celtics.
AA11720887	I think the Dodgers had a shot before Manny signs. But with Manny their shot improves. One of the best catchers in the game. Outstanding young first baseman. Solid up the middle if Furcal can keep away from injuries. Power outfield. Good pitching with a good closer.

khU8m4gxaa	You're assuming he means Eddie, but he never says who. I think the other person who passed away that he speaks of is Owen Hart. Edge, Benoit & Owen are all Canadian & Edge had some of his training under the Harts. He also mentions wrestling in Stampede, which was the promotion ran by Stu Hart. The living person, I'll assume is Christian. They've been good friends since they were kids. He's also close with Rhino, so that another possibility.|`|fmUGHvgHaa	C.C<br>  <br>  Christian Cage|`|XT8eNPhVaa	I think it would be Christan<br>  <br>  Note: That video was pretty cool... Some idiots can finally see how close the people in the industry are with each other and how when the industry loses a guy like Eddie or Benoit it impacts everybody. Also, it just goes to show you how great of a guy Edge is, Ive met him hes a great person and is very passionate about his work, that's why hes such a great heel. But that, that was the real Edge that was Adam Copeland|`|L3MkAG6Qaa	Guys, I don't think it's Christian. This took place in 2007, and Cage was in TNA at the time. I just played it, and he said "this industry."<br>  <br>  So that could mean TNA, and if it does, I see Christian as the most obvious choice.|`|kY6H6Fvaaa	I think Christian|`|1Va3yslbaa	Cage|`|vbxevkodaa	Could be Christian (and is the most likely candidate) however as someone else also pointed out, he is relatively close with Bret Hart (by the way read his new autobiography, its awesome) and Chris Jericho.|`|Ya8Uaf7caa	Christian or Kizarny, they're both good childhood friends of his.|`|gXeDKVLJaa	Ric Flair
f1o6mAe1aa	You need grinds.  It depends on if you do big gaps and jsyk Ollie South isn't considered a trick...anywhere. Honestly unless your local skaters are really awful, you shouldn't even waste your time, these tricks are not tech enough in the first place.  Even though I'm not a big proponent of it, learn a 360 flip. Also learn backside or frontisde flips, big flips, and kickflips in and out of grinds. If you ever do decide to make a video, make sure you do stuff big or do stuff tech, like flipping in and/or out of your grinds, or crook/feeble/smith/overcrook/(nose)blunt... type grinds.<br>  <br>  And I think by fakie 180 shuv you mean bigspin, look it up.  Work on backside and frontside 180's as well, cause those plus kick/heelflips and shuvs are the basis of every street flip trick.|`|MEeDrrMKaa	everytime somebody ask this question, someone always beats me to the punch
RS3fjNboaa	There already is an investigation. The Coast Guard has automatic investigations on boating accidents and such. I doubt there was foul play involved. They just got hit by some unexpected nasty weather in a boat that was too small to be that far out in the gulf.|`|P8CBDLiKaa	Every story I can find says they all put on life vests, but I can't find one story saying the other three took them off and gave up.<br>  <br>  Every story I can find says they all tried to stay together and on the overturned boat, but the heavy seas kept knocking them off the boat and eventually swept them apart.<br>  <br>  So, no, I don't smell anything "fishy,"  it sounds like dozens of other boating accidents in similar situations, and the only unique aspect is that there were some NFL players on board.<br>  <br>  Regarding investigations, there has been an ongoing investigation since they were first reported missing.  Standard procedure.|`|whE5OQ26aa	I would imagine the big NFL guys would've killed the others before anything else.|`|ntLUHiTAaa	no first of all i live in the west coast of florida they were only 20-30 miles of shore when the main current is 70 miles of shore they put their anchor not on a ahhh i forgot but it made the boat flip over witch caused one person to stay on the boat where the others probably swam away to try and get help so just a stupid mistake by them going out 30 miles on a 20 foot boat.|`|bxnMQQMJaa	Yeah, because If I'm in the middle of nowhere, I'm trying to stay together with however I'll with, no matter what.

Go on speculation, or theory's, such as this?|`|KZsdVGJzaa	not sure but it seemed a bit fishy to me too. how is it that he is the only one near the boat. and that the others jus disappeared. when ur in a situation like that aren't u supposed to STICK TOGETHER. this whole story never really made sense to me|`|pZ8evSJ0aa	I dont' know these football players or anything about them. However, I was reading this story this morning and it does not seem right. Why would they take off their life vests after only a short period of time?! They were athletic men who weren't hurtin for money or anything else apparent. They seemed like they were all from wonderful families who loved and cared deeply about them. I hope they can investigate further but i'm not sure how. The one survivor's testimony/quotes are "unreliable" a detective said because of the state of mind and shock that he was in. Sad, twisted story.|`|kuh7CfcSaa	I have not heard anything about them giving up...the stories I read said that they were fighting but got separated.  <br>  <br>  Only one guy knows for sure what happened.  But if he was some mad serial killer that planned the whole thing...wow, he sure went through a lot to accomplish his task.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is anything fishy going on.  I also don't see them taking off their vests and giving up, but I have not read where he said that.<br>  <br>  Just seems like a pure act of nature and a bit of poor decision making.  1st - they should not have been that far out on a small boat.  2nd - once they anchored, why did they not at least check in with the coast guard that they were anchoring and going to ride it out.<br>  <br>  Edit-  Someone else brought up a good point...the worst thing you can do during a storm is anchor. <br>  <br>  The link about them giving up is below.  I think the dude was just halucinating at the time.|`|4e6c861c3ce0eccec44449fb5d6baadeaa	Anytime you have a accident like this your going to have a investigation. Seems easy to act like a detective. Sounds to me like they made some bad decisions.

SpqYjlVpaa	eBay will get you the most exposure of anyplace online. To get the most money for the cards, provide clear scans and detailed descriptions so that bidders know exactly what they are getting. If you do that, you should get fair market value for them. If you have cards that are not valuable individually, I recommend grouping them into lots by year and sport.<br>  <br>  To get an idea of what you can get for the cards, you can look at completed ebay auctions.  I recently put together a web page describing how to do that: <a href="http://www.footballcardgallery.com/prices/" rel="nofollow">http://www.footballcardgallery.com/price...</a><br>  <br>  If the cards are as valuable as he says, it might be worth working with an auction house that specializes in sports memorabilia.  Such places send out glossy catalogs and get more exposure to serious collectors.  Memory Lane, Mastro, and Bill Goodwin come to mind, and there are more out there.|`|EoGTpyTZaa	<a href="http://www.baseball-cards.com/auction/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.baseball-cards.com/auction/in...</a><br>  Also you should try to sell them into smaller groups because people might not buy them if they are worth that much.
tzrLDbHWaa	No, from the MLB rule book..<br>  <br>  Rule 8.01 Comment: Pitchers may disengage the rubber after taking their signs but may not step quickly onto the rubber and pitch. This may be judged a quick pitch by the umpire. When the pitcher disengages the rubber, he must drop his hands to his sides.<br>  Pitchers will not be allowed to disengage the rubber after taking each sign.<br>  (a) The Windup Position. The pitcher shall stand facing the batter, his pivot foot in contact with the pitcher’s plate and the other foot free. From this position any natural movement associated with his delivery of the ball to the batter commits him to the pitch without interruption or alteration. He shall not raise either foot from the ground, except that in his actual delivery of the ball to the batter, he may take one step backward, and one step forward with his free foot.<br>  When a pitcher holds the ball with both hands in front of his body, with his pivot foot in contact with the pitcher’s plate and his other foot free, he will be considered in the Windup Position.<br>  Rule 8.01(a) Comment: In the Windup Position, a pitcher is permitted to have his “free” foot on the rubber, in front of the rubber, behind the rubber or off the side of the rubber.<br>  From the Windup Position, the pitcher may:<br>  (1) deliver the ball to the batter, or<br>  (2) step and throw to a base in an attempt to pick-off a runner, or<br>  (3) disengage the rubber (if he does he must drop his hand to his sides).<br>  In disengaging the rubber the pitcher must step off with his pivot foot and not his free foot first.<br>  He may not go into a set or stretch position—if he does it is a balk.<br>  (b) The Set Position. Set Position shall be indicated by the pitcher when he stands facing the batter with his pivot foot in contact with, and his other foot in front of, the pitcher’s plate, holding the ball in both hands in front of his body and coming to a complete stop. From such Set Position he may deliver the ball to the batter, throw to a base or step backward off the pitcher’s plate with his pivot foot. Before assuming<br>  Rule 8.01<br>  76<br>  Set Position, the pitcher may elect to make any natural preliminary motion such as that known as “the stretch.” But if he so elects, he shall come to Set Position before delivering the ball to the batter. After assuming Set Position, any natural motion associated with his delivery of the ball to the batter commits him to the pitch without alteration or interruption.<br>  Preparatory to coming to a set position, the pitcher shall have one hand on his side; from this position he shall go to his set position as defined in Rule 8.01(b) without interruption and in one continuous motion.<br>  The pitcher, following his stretch, must (a) hold the ball in both hands in front of his body and (b) come to a complete stop. This must be enforced. Umpires should watch this closely. Pitchers are constantly attempting to “beat the rule” in their efforts to hold runners on bases and in cases where the pitcher fails to make a complete “stop” called for in the rules, the umpire should immediately call a “Balk.”<br>  <br>  Edit: How the f**k can I get a thumbs down.  I answered the question and quoted the MLB rule book in case he wasn't sure.|`|UJZZ4bnLaa	only 1 foot  must be on the rubber<br>  <br>  think about it.......  how would it be possible or practical  to pitch from the  stretch if both feet had to be on the rubber??|`|tGHGloS1aa	only 1 foot

Yeah, stats are really nice to look at, but what did all of Drew Brees' stats get him? A seat in front of his giant plasma screen watching a man with mediocre stats win it all. I kind of understand what you mean that you can't judge a QB on wins. For the regular season. In the post season, you can, and Ben has delivered in the post season (8-2).<br>  <br>  You brought up that Rex Grossman won 13 games one season. But that was just ONE season. Since drafting Ben, the Steelers average 11.2 wins a season, with 8-8 being the worst. There was a team that made the playoffs this year at 8-8. That translates into consistency. Out of Ben's 5 seasons, he's made the playoffs 4 times and has only been one and done ONCE; Peyton's been one and done 3 out of the last 4 seasons. The other three times he at least made the Conference Championship and won twice.<br>  <br>  You bring up judging a QB because of winning MVPs and stuff like that. Brett Favre and Peyton Manning are the only players to win MVP 3 times. Ben has the same amount of Super Bowl victories they have combined. And I'm pretty sure you consider them "elite."<br>  <br>  Granted the defense is extremely important, but putting up huge numbers isn't a guarentee for winning. Best example: 2007 New England Patriots. They didn't need to really try and stop teams because the offense would obliterate the other team. But as the year went on, their margin of victories got closer and closer, and their defense got exposed because they were old and had to stay on the field longer than they had towards the beginning of the season.<br>  <br>  Plus for the Steelers, all those close victories helped us out in the end. Ben showed that when it comes to the two-minute drill, he's the f*****g master of it. Also, the O-Line is a huge factor. Look at those times when it would be 1st and Goal on the flipping 1 inch line and they couldn't punch it in on 4 tries and they would turn over on downs. That's O-Line Epic Fail right there. If they could have gotten in the endzone some of those times, there might not have been the need to have those great comebacks this season. But they couldn't and Ben put on his Superman cape and brought the Steelers to victory.<br>  <br>  Ben is elite, the fact that he keeps winning like he does, taking all the beatings he does game in and game out, and coming back from all the concussions he gets, and the fact that he plays behind a terrible O-Line that finally played it's best when it mattered most, makes him even better than most people think. If Brees, Rivers, Peyton, or New England Quarterback had to deal with all of that, they would have put in their retirement papers a long time ago.<br>  <br>  That's my 2 for 2.|`|7RziqsDcaa	No schitt he isn't elite, he's too big. He still gets the job done.|`|SJEXY7Ufaa	I think what you are missing here is confidence....and Big BEN has got more and more as time has gone on! Ben is a gunslinger and you are never out of any game with a gunslinger! give BEN  a good offensive line and he will be the most dangerous QB in the league, with or without a great defense. If Ben stays healthy LOOK-OUT he will be a force to be reckened with|`|BFCdEAOBaa	Here's your counter argument, first remember Big Ben Roethlisberger has only been in the league for a mere 5 seasons. I REPEAT a mere 5 SEASONS! He was named the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year in 2004. He's led the Steelers to 3 AFC championship games and won two in this short time. He became the youngest Super Bowl–winning quarterback in NFL history, in just is second season. In his Fifth season a second superbowl ring. <br>  <br>  Now consider the geographic area that he's been achieving these accomplishments, not in the "sunny south" or the "dry west"or in a dome, it's been in good ole' cold, cloudy, rainy rough & tumble Pittsburgh. Add the fact that does not have superstar receivers like T.O. , Randy Moss, Steve Smith, Jerry Rice, Ocho Cinco, Plaxico Burres etc, and has to play Ray Lewis and the Ravens D twice a year and had the #1 toughest schedule to deal with this season with an, average at best, offensive line. It's amazing that he stayed healthy.<br>  <br>  Now to the other quarterbacks. Remember Tom Brady, Steve McNair, Mike Vick, Bret Farve, Steve Young, Phillip Rivers and other elites didn't even play as rookies! Kurt Warner didn't even make a pro roster out of college.<br>   <br>  Peyton Manning is elite and great, but he's a 10 YEAR VET and didn't win an AFC championship game or superbowl until his 8th season! <br>  And has only appeared in 2 AFC championships to date! <br>  <br>  It takes a team to win games but elite quarterbacks have to first be leaders, be smart , be tough and get the RINGS! Ben has done this at a much faster pace than Troy Aikman, Marino, Elway, Brady, Peyton & Eli, Bradshaw, Montana, Steve Young and all of those heisman QB's that are long forgotten. I'm sure Carson Palmer, Drew Brees, McNabb, Romo, Vince Young, Phillip Rivers, Dante Culpepper, Byron Leftwich and other VETS just wish they had Big Ben's accomplishments. Is he Elite absolutely!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK IN THE '09 SEASON MY FRIEND!|`|GmRscBkPaa	He is elite.  He has the rings, and wins to prove it.  It's still early in his career, but I'm confident history will show his worth.<br>  <br>  The best thing he has is superior size and the ability to stand in the pocket and take a hit.  This gives him a chance to finish the play.<br>  <br>  If he hadn't almost killed himself on that motorcycle, I'm sure we wouldn't even be debating this.  But that did result in a few bad years for him.  He's in his prime now, and expect 1 or 2 more rings before his career is over.  That would put him in elite company for sure!|`|YCwmCDkUaa	There is no reason for a counterargument...<br>  <br>  Big Ben has the wins...Big Ben has the SB rings...<br>  <br>  His numbers speak for themselves.  People who knock him because he has a great defense should look at his passing yards.  True he gets sacked...he holds on to the ball too long.<br>  <br>  People wanted to enshrine Warner into the HOF when he was 1-1 in the SB.  Now he's 1-2...Ben is 2-0 but they wanna bash him.<br>  <br>  Look at the stats and the numbers.  Do I think Ben should be in the HOF?  No, not yet...but he might be there someday.  How many other QB's are 2-0 and aren't mentioned as potential HOFers?|`|plhLIIeAaa	Big Ben will not be an elite quarterback in the NFL. He is good enough to win games, and bad enough to lose games. He had a great defense behind him that really does limit the opposing offense to a few field goals and a touchdown. But Ben cannot find the End Zone with any of his receivers except for maybe Hines Ward. He is a product of the system. When he has a line that can block, receivers that regularly do not drop the ball, and catch it for large gains or a TD, he can be considered a good QB. Elite? No. Good? Soon.|`|BPKxvdRHaa	<a href="http://innnanswers.freeallinsurance.com" rel="nofollow">http://innnanswers.freeallinsurance.com</a><br>  it<br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in websi|`|paIUgtLRaa	As a pure quarterback, he isn't prototypical. He isn't a Peyton Manning or a Tom Brady, but don't mistake it, he is an elite qb in his own way. I won't go down the list, and counter everything.<br>  <br>  As far as his comeback stats. True, they were losing and had to come back, but they still came back didn't they. You can't never count out the Steelers when Ben is playing.<br>  To say that Ben without the defense is nothing, is almost irrelevant. A more accurate argument would be to say that a qb without an offensive line. The defense doesn't dip, dodge, and duke other defenders out of their shoes while evading sacks. Had Ben had a better line, what could have happened then? Maybe all of those close games wouldn't have been so close. Also the fact, that the Steelers don't throw every down. They aren't a passing team. They aren't going to throw for a zillion yards a game, nor are they going to pass it 70% of the time. Comparing stats (apples to apples) is going to have Ben "lose" everytime.<br>  Yeah, the wins stats is sorta misleading. The Bears won in spite of Grossman, not because of him. Grossman made mistakes, lots of them. Roethlisberger isn't so mistake prone. During the middle of the year, he threw a number of int's, but I think it was, was cause he was trying to hard. He was forcing it. Once he relaxed, got into rythym, then he was fine. And that showed during the playoffs. Plays were made when they had to be. An offense with Ben in, is dangerous. Not for the quick score, but the for whole game. Ben without his defense is like saying Brady without his surrounding talent and system. Put him in Detroit, I swear you'd never hear another word about Brady again, unless they were talking about his glory years. Brady was a sixth round pick for a reason. Even the "brilliant" Belicheck missed on him for 5 rounds. It was luck, pure and simple. Brady didn't even go in until Bledsoe got injured. If surrounding talent, and a defense is what made Roethlisberger, then the same could be said about Brady.<br>  <br>  As far as Delhomme and Brees, both are pure passers. Both have very good personal stats, and can quickly and easily win any contest again Ben when comparing personal stats, but in the NFL, the most important stats are winning, and championships. Brady has 3, I will give him those. But Ben has 2, and Peyton only has one. I personally feel that Peyton is the best current QB in the league, and I have been around for a while. But you know what else, not Brady, Brees, Manning (either one), Delhomme, Cutler, Rivers, or Warner can move in the pocket like Ben can. No one can extend plays like he can. As much credit as our defense got, we wouldn't have been in as much games as we were, we wouldn't have won as many games as we did, if it wasn't for Ben either. That's something to think about.
qOxyflwiaa	The acquisition of Cassel and Vrabel gives the Chiefs instant credibility.  GM Scott Pioli scouted both those guys when he was the Pats' player personnel director.  Plus, Cassel and Vrabel know what it takes to win.  Cassel has never played on a winning Super Bowl team, but he has been Tom Brady's backup in New England, and when Brady went down with a knee injury early last season, Cassel was impressive, throwing for 3,693 yards and 21 TDs.  Vrabel, a repeat Pro Bowler, had 62 tackles, four sacks, an interception, and a forced fumble in '08.  It will take Kansas City time to get back into playoff contention, but Pioli got off to a pretty good start.|`|plhLIIeAaa	This is my opinion on the Cassel trade. The Chiefs do not have to pay him 14 mil a year. They will sign him to a contract for far less. Chiefs did get a good deal with this. They keep their 1st round pick this year and next, and the Patriots don't have to pay some fresh rookie who hasn't proven themselves in the NFL.  The Patriots get a 2nd round pick and save 14 million of cap space.<br>  <br>  Vrabel will retire next year after signing a one day deal with the Pats to retire a Patriot.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	No, NE wouldn't have since Cutler was never going to NE in the rumored trade.<br>  <br>  And the trade was fair.<br>  <br>  Cassel is not worth the #3 pick and Vrabel's old. NE needed to dump cap space and got almost a first-round pick out of it.<br>  <br>  Good trade for both sides.|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	I think the Patriots have screwed themselves over and now the Chiefs weep the rewards.|`|GUjr6whNaa	Heres the way I see it<br>  <br>  Good 4 chiefs- Scored a young, decent new QB, and a great (but kinda old) Mike Vrabel <br>  <br>  Bad 4 Chiefs- Lost a high draft pick, have to deal with Cassel's development<br>  <br>  <br>  Good 4 pats- score a high draft pick, no longer have to hold Cassel's hand anymore, Freed up some needed cap space<br>  <br>  Bad 4 Pats- Lost a great defensive player and a decent QB<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Overall I think the Chiefs got the better side of the deal but both sides are pretty equal. I think the Pats could have milked them or another team for a little more but it was good that they were smart enough to even get a trade agreed upon. Now the Chiefs have to keep Matt Cassel going like he was in NE which i dont think is going to be an easy task. Cassel no longer has a Randy Moss or a Wes Welker to throw to anymore. Not to mention is no longer behind one of the best PassProtection lines in the NFL<br>  <br>  lets just say i prolly wont pick Cassel 4 fantasy football this season|`|mkueXAKoaa	I think it was an even deal for both sides. They were paying Cassell starting QB money which now frees up some cap room, and they Vrabel is getting old and the Patriots are trying to go younger. Im guessing with there first round pick they go Corner Back, and with a early 2nd round pick they could get a good Linebacker to fill up Vrabels spot.|`|DSo3cUjeaa	I think the Chiefs got a much better deal. 2 proven players for an unknown 2nd round pick. I'd take that deal every time. Cassel may not be worth 14 million a year but I bet the Chiefs would have paid even more for his services considering who they've had at QB recently.|`|YlBLz9lTaa	good trade for both teams chiefs get a starting QB and a veteran pass rusher and the pats cleared up alot of cap space i dont think belichick wanted to pay two players first round money and 3  2nd picks gives them alota options and apparently vrabel was gonna be cut anyway so they let him leave with some dignity|`|v42nC3F2aa	I think that Matt Cassell is definitely not worth $14 million.|`|wvVGPnoyaa	the trade was great for new england since they got way more then both players combined were worth.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	The Patriots got a fair deal.  I mean a 2nd round pick for a backup QB and an aging LB, sounds like the Pats got a good deal and the Chiefs are taking a risk, but it was only their 2nd round pick, and if either are even decent, its probably worth it.<br>  <br>  For the people who are saying that the Chiefs got 2 proven players, get real.  Vrabel is proven but aging and not the same Mike Vrabel you think of from the SB days.  Cassel hasn't proven a damn thing.  I could go on for ages as to why he's proven nothing, but I'll leave it at this.  He's proven he could do the same job that any QB in the league could easily do, lead a great offense.  In KC he might not even be as good as Tyler Thigpen.|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	I have no idea...It was the most boneheaded trade Belichick has made as the Patriots coach...
IMu3wBu8aa	I've been a fan of both for years. I've pretty much seen and been there for their entire career (even stuff I wasn't around to see yet). So yes, this is huge. I would add Jeff vs Matt close behind them (to the list of most anticipated matches). I've been waiting for that for a long time too. I think Taker and HBK are a bit bigger though. The fact Taker has never fought HBK at Mania is such a huge reason to begin with, let alone all of the other reasons why it's so big. This is going to be historic, and unforgettable. Mania 25 will be sooo huge!!!! Is it April yet?? lmao :)|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	While there's no doubt in my mind that this match has been anticipated by many HBK and Undertaker fans in the past 11 1/2 years (that Hell in a Cell match was on October 5, 1997, and I can thank my Tombstone DVD for learning the exact date), I doubt a certain senile billionaire and the "creative team" that works for him are even capable of planning that far ahead (if not for HBK's back injury and Undertaker's groin injury, I'm pretty sure this would've taken place at WrestleMania 2000).<br>  <br>  Over the course of the past 3 years, I agree that Undertaker vs. HBK is the most anticipated match.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Look at some of the matches that have supposedly been anticipated over the years. Nothing close to what this one is generating.<br>  Both guys are still in their prime and they have been in the WWE for as long as each other. They have also been there longer than the others on the roster. So a lot of folks will be interested in this, even just for the history.<br>  This match will be better than their hell in a cell match, as they are both older and wiser and have more experience under their belts. And they are both fan faves who are genuinely loved by the public. <br>  <br>  I got goosebumps man!!!|`|KlMMOJaLaa	yes. yes. yes!!!|`|vbxevkodaa	Agreed. Taker and Shawn work really well together an have an unrivaled past together. It's history in the making and I for one am pumped to see it. It may be the only reason why I purchase the ppv|`|5zWIRSUkaa	I must Break You|`|Q1MI6L96aa	It could be a springboard for the company...it will be a 60 minute dance that ends there, which has been lacking in WM. I don't like spending good cash on Sunday and see a continuation for free on Monday.|`|ePvvGUu3aa	I agree, but I haven't anticipated this for 3 years. It's been since 1998 of their last match at Royal Rumble 98'. As I am a die hard fan of Shawn Michaels and also a fan of Undertaker, it is hard to be patient to wait for one of your dream matches, especially if it takes 10+ years to happen. This is one of the most anticipated matches arguably in history or at least how I see it. This isn't for only the current fans, but this is for every single fan from the past to present and probably will bring future fans. At the end of the day, we will know and see for ourselves that the wait was worth it.
nwZD5mzRaa	The umpires and match officials have full rights to be angry. Being ignored at the time of an attack is simply disgraceful! The match officials too should be given similar security as the players. They should protest if they aren't treated equally.|`|LzkujA3Faa	I think everyone,both players and umpires, should be given the right to express their opinions and concerns over whether to tour a country or not, especially in such unsafe conditions.<br>  <br>   It is a shock even the umpires are targeted. No one can blame them if they express reluctance to travel to such terror stricken countries.|`|M8XmhqIhaa	Well its bull$hit how umpires and match referees are pushed to one side while everyone focuses on the players. The umpires are under the same risk as the players and deserve the same amount of security. I can understand why Simon Taufel is upset. The players always get a say whether they want to tour a certain country or not, but have we ever heard of the umpire's point of view whether they want to go or not? The umpires have just as much rights as players and they should be allowed to choose wheter they want to tour a certain country or not and they should have the same security as the players.|`|4cd30bf7558366b3b6c31ee6e5edf5d1aa	Yes I think the umpires and officials just go where they are told or they won't get to officiate in games.  The Umpires in my mind are in more danger than players because no matter what decisions they make in matches there are always people who will hate them.  Imagine what some of the hardcore Indian fans would do if they met Steve Bucknor alone in a dark alley.  Or DeSilva who also makes some dubious decisions sometimes.|`|wPlfPc0gaa	Did the officials had a choice?<br>  I don't think they had any. If ICC asks them to go, they had to go.

Broad or Simon, he has a valid grievance: there wasn't anybody around to take care of them.

The terrorists were mainly interested in harming the players........I guess they were lucky in that context!!<br>  Yea, I too agree that umpires should be left with the decision to tour any country...Every Human being should be given the right to chose what they want to do and where they want to go....so...I hope ICC and all the boards will listen to what the umpires have to say after this attack...|`|mZ2Uluioaa	when australian team doesn't visit pakistan , how australian govt allows Taufel to visit pakistan , when australian government themselves are doing discrimination between umpires and players how can you expect Taufel being preferred by pak Authorities~<br>  <br>  it is the juice which counts, the pulp is scrapped always ~<br>  i don't know what Taufel is expecting here, he is addressing it to rocks, he should go and ask their own federals , how the hell did they allow him to travel to pak~|`|RGxMkT0zaa	Saw the Press conference Chris Broad gave.<br>  It is a shame that the likes of Simon T and Chris B do not get support from their country and ICC.<br>  They are equally important.<br>  Let all the anger be directed positively to improve the conditions.|`|rjWRMDYUaa	I think all are become afraid from lahore attack.<br>  Umpires should also be given equal securities as players because they are also human-being.|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	as,.............Chris Broad actually states that PCB manager promised presidential security to the match officials, that certainly didn't happen............so kiwis wont go~|`|cOm8LQ1Daa	Even Chris Broad was angry abt the same thing...read it on the news paper!! Not even a single security person was in the van where umpires were sitting!! The driver of the van was also shot dead....thank god that the umpires escaped!

PCB should 've taken care of them too....<br>  <br>  Even, when the paki umpire (Raza is his name, i guess) was injured by sharpnel, it was Broad who saved him....why isn't media giving importance to it!! Of course, the bus driver needs the attention cos it was for him that Lankan player were saved but Broad too needs a round of applause! He saved the umpire by putting his life in danger! <br>  <br>  And i wouldn't be surprised to see umpires objecting to tour terror struck countries after this incident!

You can't get worst publicity than being winless!|`|YCwmCDkUaa	Yeah, now once the Fakers cut Kobe I won't have to hear about that crap either...|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	This is the best news I heard all day. <br>  <br>  THAT STUPID PUNK TERREL OWENS GETS RELEASED.<br>  <br>  <br>  BQ:He will go sign with the dumbest owner in football AL DAVIS|`|xxtvhn5Naa	Yup, he would be a nice fit for the Raiders, a crybaby and trouble maker.|`|8f264df90f04c294a122ee3032ed2541aa	It's a Mistake for several reasons. With Roy on the other side I think they could have establishedd more balance this coming season,especially with with developing receiverss like Austin and Crayton. <br>  Can't Blame T.O. For all the Problems, the Defense played horrible when they had great opportunities to win when opposing offenses were 3rd and 15+ yards, they let them convert or score TD's in 3 games that would have put them in the playoffs. Can't blame TO for everything, you can try, but you know it's just not true, Media explodes things and make things worse than they are and does more damage that what actually exists.|`|Cn9gUBamaa	Everybody copying the media saying TO is a cancer. Have y'all notice that only the "wanna be stars that only got fame by being on ESPN" dudes are the only ones saying this. NFL Network guys don't say that. Only TD and Coach Mora. Only the star athletes knows about TO. He is not a bad player. TO is a great WR and he want the bad. If you were a great WR and you wasn't getting the ball you would complain too. TO put ROMO on the MAP. And ROMO ain't that good anyway. ROMO got fame because of TO. Did TO lost the game against Seattle? NO. ROMO FUMBLE THE BALL. Who lost the game against the Giants? ROMO. TO did not lose the games. ROMO lost em. Romo is not Tom Brady or Manning. IF you don't like TO then you some corny ish. TO drop balls. SO EVERYBODY DROPS EM. But he catch more didn't he. HE MAKE PLAYS. Y'all Wish y'all had his ability. EVEN AT 35. The MAN IS GREAT.|`|j7i0zPpWaa	YA number 40 already. He is gone, the most productive receiver on the team is gone and who are they going to replace him with? <br>  <br>  He will not go to the raiders because owens wants to play for a team that will get to the super bowl. The raiders are not close with al davis as the guy calling the shots.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	owens is great at doin what he do but he has to learn to keep him mouth shut.<br>  Dallas Cowboys for life mother ******<br>  Playboytrolls#22|`|rM9WzIkHaa	wow another T.O Q im thinking the raiders to or detroit. i would like to see him go to the seahawks though.......i mean because now they have housh that'll be a good combo
InslKYS5aa	What you're talking about is a A.D. Boivin Snow Hawk. They basically look like a motocross bike with a single ski and a narrow track. There is a link to the site below.|`|9Kt7p7Vfaa	It is in fact an A. D. Boivin Snow Hawk. They came out around '02.|`|E7PwbMuXaa	Years ago,  I had one, like this... It was a Chrysler Snow Runner. It had a real narrow track, and, only one ski. It was not related, to the Chrysler Corporation, of automobiles, though. Itr was a company, all by themselves. Another company, that had a snowmobile, with a single ski, up front, was the Ski-Doo Alpine and the Ski-Doo Elan. Although, these models, had the one ski set up, they did have two tracke, in back. So, that is something different, as well. But, I believe, what you saw, was a Chrysler Snow Runner. Not too many of them, left. They don't make them, anymore. I think, they were made, only, till the 1970's.
5M0FBU89aa	Jonathan Broxton was throwing in the triple-digits in high school - brrrr!|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	Most any pitcher in college level will have a fast ball in the 80's.|`|eFQXl7uyaa	A lot of pro pitchers are in the upper 80's. They may actually be able to reach 90 but they are pitching - not throwing. Some HS players can get it up to 90 (I could). Here was one of my first lessons; I can throw 90 but they hit 130... pitching is not about speed, it's about change of speed and putting the hitter in the wrong place at the wrong time. But you will rarely throw the ball by a pro hitter. The real advantage to throwing a 95mph fastball is that the hitter has a small reaction time and that means by the time he realizes you just threw an 82mph change up he is half way to the dugout. If you throw harder you can have more impact on fooling the hitter by reducing the reaction time as you can have a 10mph difference in a fastball and a curve ball and your curve is still 84mph. But throwing hard doesn't make you a pitcher, getting people out does.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	beginning years of mlb like minors they will be hitting 90 and above on average then but there are college guys that can hit that high..
