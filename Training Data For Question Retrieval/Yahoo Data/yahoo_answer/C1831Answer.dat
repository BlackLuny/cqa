9BL6LFJ9aa	First you do not need to tell us max points we already know. If your recovery software was on a partition on the main drive then formatting your operating system partition should not have affected it. If however you only had the one partition containing everything you have screwed up big time. You cannot ge it back. the only hope is to contact Sony, explain what you have done and hope they will send you a recovery CD. Good luck
5fkqsnBJaa	Your computer is badly infected. It is now under the control of criminals, likly in Russia or Ukraine.    Your machine is now a "zombie computer" and has been recruited into a "botnet" ( I suggest that you do a fast "Wickepedia" on both those terms).    The solution is to do a full system scan with both your anti-virus and your anti-spyware apps, but if that does not help, the only solution is to back up all your data, then re-format and re-install your Windows.    Best of luck.|`|bFi2UC07aa	in fact you have a virus which could be a spy ware as well. All you have to do is download AVG anti virus for free and install a anti spyware software like ADware along with a fire wall such as Zone alarm and you are protected.|`|51yEZIvlaa	You need an anti-virus program. The free ones are better than nothing but you get what you pay for. Comodo's free Internet Security suit would be a good solution.

AA11703028	hi mate                   it depends on the dimensions of the acer aspire x3200,however i have looked at the x3200 and to be honest it will be a tight squeeze,and also the x3200 only comes with a 220watt psu and considering the geforce 8500gt requires a 350watt minimum psu this will also be a problem               however as with all problems theres allways a solution,in regards to the geforce 8500gt i would opt for the superior XFX GeForce 9500GT 512MB ( http://www.aria.co.uk/SuperSpecials/Othe... since its small enough for the x3200 case and also has some better specs than the 8500gt                these include a 550mhz core clock and 512mb of ddr2 ram running at 800mhz(or 1600mhz ddr effective),these are excellent specifications and combined with the 128bit memory bus interface this equates to a memory bandwidth 25.6gb/sec which is pretty good for a card in this price range              you should be able to run games like crysis and bioshock on lower detail settings and lower resolutions,and for less than 40 this is a real bargain              any problems let me know                    good luck mate !|`|uQMtGP9Paa	yes it should fit

VDex6EtPaa	You need a router.  A switch or hub won't do.|`|Uu7BeMF2aa	usually your Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides 1 IP to your modem (the public IP) to get to the Internet. If you require more than one piece of equipment like multiple computers or your XBOX, you need to purchase a router.  The router would be connected to your modem, and all your equipment to the router.  Your router would give out IP addresses (private ones) to your equipment which you then can use to go out to the Internet.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	It doesn't work that way.  You need to buy a router.  The modem feeds the router with one IP address.  The router then creates multiple IP addresses (DHCP) to feed to the various connected devices.|`|cnbvCcX5aa	You can also buy a hub or switch, which tend to be cheaper and easier to configure.|`|axokvVDsaa	try to buy a wired router, like this one: http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...

4MYWPD9Yaa	Well, most of the answers you get here will be extremes.    One extreme answer you'll get is "Macs are great. They're totally immune to viruses. Don't worry about anything."    The other extreme answer you'll get is "Macs offer no better security than (Windows) PCs. Windows PCs are just more popular. As soon as Macs get more popular, they'll get viruses, just as (Windows) PCs do."    Neither is correct, and the real truth is somewhere in between.    First of all, people tend to throw around the term "virus" to mean anything bad, but a better term to use would be "malware." Malware refers to anything bad. Viruses are self-replicating and take advantage of flaws in the system. Trojans, on the other hand, rely on social engineering instead, so they actually trick the user into thinking they're legitimate software when they are really malware. Either kind of malware generally works off the assumption that the user is an administrator, so it digs itself deep into the system files so as to be difficult to remove.    Windows can be made secure, but its structure and defaults make this difficult. By default (yes, even in Vista, with its UAC prompts) Windows makes the first user an administrator account, which means it has access to all system files and the registry, which means all malware the user gets infected with also has access to those files and can mess up the entire installation. Now, the logical thing, of course, would be to make a limited user account, but Windows doesn't make it easy to use that on a day-to-day basis, since the "Run as.." feature has only limited functionality. Not only that, but because Windows defaults to administrator access, many legitimate Windows programs require you to be an administrator to run them. That, coupled with a lot of autorun features enabled by default, makes Windows a bad security choice in terms of its structure (has nothing to do with its popularity).    Macs have a better security system, because even so-called "administrator" users operate at a limited user level unless they temporarily escalate privileges after a password authentication for a particular task (using the same "sudo" that is popular in Ubuntu Linux).    That said, using a Mac doesn't make you immune to malware, if you're ignorant about how to protect your computer. Trojans, as I said before, rely on tricking the user into installing them.    Let's say you had $1,000,000 in the bank. The bank is locked up in bulletproof vault, has guards around it 24/7, and implements a sophisticated laser sensor security system to guard against intrusion. Sounds pretty good, huh? Oh, but then a burglar comes up to you and says "Write me a check for $1,000,000. Don't worry. It's all going to charity." You say, "Oh, okay. It's for charity. That sounds good." So you write the check. Does that mean the bank has bad security? No, it means you're stupid and can be easily tricked.    So trojans can thrive in any OS (even Linux) environment if the users are dumb enough to be tricked into installing bad things.    If you want to be safe on a Mac, use strong passwords and install software from only trusted sources. I'd recommend either buying legitimate software from Apple/Adobe/Microsoft or downloading from SourceForge.net. And stop using P2P and torrents to download illegal music, software, and movies.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	No computer is inherently safer from viruses than any other computer.  There are fewer viruses being written for Macs, so your chance of getting a virus - if you practice safe computing - is lower.  If you download "free" songs and movies, click on links you get in emails and go to questionable websites, you can infect a Mac just as fast as you can infect a PC.|`|0hSpsSByaa	They are actually suppose to have far less exposure to viruses than other computers.  You can get antivirus software just like you can for other computers.|`|T42Nt3Lyaa	Macs are relatively safe, far safer than windows virus wise. safest of all are the linux based computers which can not actually get infected by viruses.    It is very rare for a linux computer to run an anti virus.|`|uu1IUxAkaa	you can get McAfee better then Norton with lower price.  they are safe... for now    people are starting to make viruses that are for a mac...|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	In practice, Macs are probably safer than Windows pcs BUT you need to understand why: Macs have about 5% share of the market, Windows about 90% (the rest are Linux on servers, etc). hence Windows is far more attractive to the bad guys.    Macs aren't immune, and will probably soon be proved to be less secure than Windows.  http://www.sophos.com/pressoffice/news/a...  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/26/...  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/21/...    For the time being at least, a reasonable AV program and firewall should keep you safe. There's a couple of free AVs for the Mac, I believe. Either one should be OK, or buy a known name.|`|oHN6jwjoaa	one of my really  good friends has an imac. and he loves it. he said that any mac computer works amazing. and they hold back all virus stuff. so. by his knowledge, they work wonders.    try it out.|`|0VfHTdCSaa	its very safe. get an anti virus thats free and good like avast.|`|xKlNK3kKaa	Macs are not safe at all.  During the last hackathon, the macbook was the first hacked with all default programs.  The windows computer was next, and the linux one won (yeah linus).  To really protect it, install Linux.  To EXTREMELY protect it,  Don't buy it.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	They are no different than PC's with regards to immunity to viruses, they just are not the primary target of virus writers.    You should purchase an Anti-Virus Program and subscribe to regular updates.|`|AA12339318	It's not that Macs are particularly safe from virus attacks.  It is just that the people that write malicious software want to get the most "bang for their buck," meaning that they want their malware to affect the greatest number of machines.  Because their are so many more PCs running than Macs, that makes PCs a bigger, more inviting target.    The thing is, that hackers LOVE challenges.  That means that some folks WILL write malware designed to attack Mac platforms.  So, any Macs out there WITHOUT protections will be just as vulnerable as any one else's PC.    It's kind of like living in a good neighborhood versus living in a bad neighborhood.  A person in a good neighborhood is less LIKELY to be robbed, but they had STILL better lock their doors at night.|`|pwkeo7tTaa	You don't need any programs, just set the Firewall to a stricter level and connect your computer to a router (with a build in firewall). Having good security is more about being a smart user than it is about having a bunch of programs installed on your machine.
2afVnStxaa	Overclocking is the process of running a computer component at a higher clock rate (more clock cycles per second) than it was designed for or was specified by the manufacturer, usually practiced by personal computer enthusiasts seeking an increase in the performance of their computers. Some of them purchase low-end computer components which they then overclock to higher speeds, or overclock high-end components to attain levels of performance beyond the specified values. Others overclock outdated components to keep pace with new system requirements, rather than purchasing new hardware.[1]    Users who overclock their components mainly focus their efforts on processors, video cards, motherboard chipsets, and Random Access Memory (RAM). It is done through manipulating the CPU multiplier and the motherboard's front side bus (FSB) speed until a maximum stable operating frequency is reached, although with the introduction of Intel's new X58 chipset and the Core i7 Processor, the Front Side Bus has been replaced with the QPI (Quick Path Interconnect); often this is called the Baseclock (BCLK). While the idea is simple, variation in the electrical and physical characteristics of computing systems complicates the process. CPU multipliers, bus dividers, voltages, thermal loads, cooling techniques and several other factors can affect it    Go to this link for some results on guides to overclock you system:    http://www.google.com/search?q=Overclock...    Hope this helps. Good luck to you.|`|AA12066574	Overclocking is running the CPU at a faster speed than advertised by the manufacturer. I've never done it, but I know you have to take extra measures to cool the processor. Even then, it likely won't last as long.|`|N37Udp4Iaa	Over clocking makes the processor run at a faster speed. This is dangerous as its more likey to overheat and fail. Settings are changed in the BIOS.    I wouldnt recommend it unless you really know what you are doing.    Chris  www.teech.org|`|cAY3Z9wLaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overclockin...|`|AA10089212	Overclocking is pretty much increasing the frequency of your processor for better performance.  You usually change the freq in the bios  But if you don't know what your doing don't bother you could over cook your processor.  Possibly damage your board if you set it wrong.|`|2d1281aa57d4a1706e1d2a23da968188aa	Overclocking means running components like CPU, RAM, video card etc at speeds higher than the manufacturer's specifications.  It voids any warranties, often requires aftermarket cooling and shortens the lifespan of components.      Overclocking should never be attempted on new hardware until you're experienced at doing it- it's risky.  First-timers should practice on old CPUs/motherboards because it's easy to burn out stuff.|`|FK0tfWlXaa	Overclocking usually involves CPU/Ram/video card ram/ motherboard. Either one of the 4 it helps increase the cpu performance. However when you overclock the motherboard must be able to handle it and give you the option. If you overclock the CPU then you need to get a better cpu cooling so it doesn't get fried. Same goes with the video card there's better cooling for it as well. For ram you can get ones that have a heat sink which allows you to overclock.    hope that answers your question|`|AA12149874	overclocking is to make adjustments to the cpu so it will perform faster that its real speed (by changing fsb,voltage,and other technical things)    it needs time of adjustments because the computer may be not stable on a combination of changes so you have try another.    people can get a Pentium dual-core e5200 @ 2.5GHz to work @ 4.00GHz with overclocking.    but please dont try it if you dont know what you are doing because you can damage the CPU,RAM,or anything else with changing the voltage to make the overclock. and you may void the warranty because of overclocking and if anything happened to the pc then the company or store may consider it out of warranty.

You can drip dry components once you pull them out, but can you tolerate your PC smelling like a deep fryer? Some people say it's pleasant.    Outside of that, there isn't really anything to say. Oil cooling is just one method of keeping your PC cool and has similar issues to water cooling - watching for leaks, checking levels, etc. etc. Other than that, it's really based on what you want to do with the PC.|`|5zSSGKBpaa	Go crazy.|`|1eXxGForaa	If your going to Oil cool it your going to want to used the best hardware available, because once you put it in oil you wont want to upgrade it cuz everything will be covered in Oil.

To turn it off....<br>  Right click on AVG icon in system tray and click Open AVG User Inerface, double click on Link Scanner and uncheck the 3 options at the bottom which say:-<br>  <br>  i) Enable AVG Search Shield (Requires browser restart)<br>  ii) Enable AVG Active Surf Shield<br>  iii) Enable reporting of detected threats to AVG.<br>  <br>  Now try browsing and your DSL should be fine. Still facing a problem? Follow these steps:-<br>  <br>  1) Open Internet Explorer: Goto Tools > Internet Options<br>  2) Click on delete cookies and delete files and click OK<br>  <br>  If you are using IE7, then click on Delet button within the browsing history section under General tab and click on Delete All.<br>  <br>  There you go.

VBngSH9raa	If your Windows based PC is too slow there are a number of techniques you can resort to.    1) Uninstall Applications you don't need  Start > Control Panel > Add/Remove Programs    2) Defrag your harddrives  Start > My Computer > Right Click Drive to Defrag and select Properties > Tools > Defrag Now    3) Disable Start Up programs you don't need.  Start > Run > type in "msconfig" > Click the 'Start-Up' tab > Click 'Disable all' > Click 'Ok' (then make sure you restart)    This is one of the best ways to increase the speed of your PC. If there's software that you need or would like to run on start up every time just go back through and check the programs you'd like. Also don't worry about your Anti-Virus programs, those will automatically start every time no matter what.    4) Download and run Tune-up (comes with 30 day free trial)    5) Make sure you have at least 15 % of all of your harddrives free. As hard drives fill up they take longer to find/read information on them, thus being slower.    6) Make sure you have the proper drivers for your graphic card.    7) Sometimes Vista can have a bit too much eye candy, turning down the graphics of the Windows Task bar and Windows can actually make a difference.    8) If worse comes to worse and none of these work it may be time for you to reformat (wipe everything), and if that doesn't fix everything then it's time for an upgrade.|`|dILqe7nBaa	http://www.microsoft.com/atwork/getstart...|`|ra69rxxgaa	That should help at least a little.

Pxkqq8r2aa	1920x1080 is a non-standard resolution for computer monitors. Are there any known issues with this?<br>  <br>  Wrong.<br>  <br>  There are no issues other than readable font size. To correct this just adjust your DPI setting in control panel. <br>  <br>  I run my HTPC at 1080x1920 on a 32" tv and its readable as long as you're close.

MQKscLn6aa	Yup Definitely possible. But I need to know more before assisting you. Could you please tell me the type of connection you are using. Is it a PPPoE or a static IP address? Do you require a userid and password to login. DOes you ISP need the domain to be a part of the username? Is the port25 blocking deactivated on your account? I would suggest that you ask your ISP these questions and then post your connection details. <br>  <br>  Do not include your username and password  within description. You dont want people using your internet around the world.<br>  <br>  These things are something which anybody would ask you because there are different types of settings for various connections and different ISPs for different countries. <br>  <br>  Looking forward to help you out.

I assume it is WMP12 because it is a different version to what is in Vista.|`|zY1sPEVqaa	Beta is used to show that the product is not yet official, and is undergoing testing. So beta users provide feedbacks, bugs and comments that the beta has to refine the official stuff and prevent such things from happening. Beta can also have limited access to programs, like for Windows 7 Beta, The WMP is still unusable. Hope this helps =)|`|AA10003874	I do not understand this question.

jmgCpVkzaa	Hi BenyB111, well blow me down, I still have the very same laptop at work. (aren't they a tight lot!). Actually its a pretty good performer on our network which is Windows XP Server with SP2 or whatever. I know many more modern hp laptops are falling over around me but the old 600c just keeps on keeping on. First thing to do is upgrade the memory to 1Gb. Its not expensive to do and it will seemingly increase the speed of your old lappy no end once you install XP. It would not hurt to buy and (easily) install a bigger hard disk (mine is a 40Gb). You can buy larger ones now for pennies really.<br>  Do a hard disk format on the old hard disk (if keeping it) to wipe NT. NT is not very friendly with your usb ports anyway and would have been stripped of some windows stuff and crippled by your network people. So out it goes. Grab a legit copy of XP off eBay or whatever and  do a fresh install; you won't regret it. Its 1.6GHz from memory and the graphics shares that main memory so do put the extra ram in ok? Hope that gets you fired up BenyB.<br>  Pip|`|AiTDLfh4aa	format it if you want, get an xp disc insert the disc at boot up, chage the bios settings to boot from cd, the cd will boot, folow the instructions and thats it|`|XkidpdPWaa	Don't listen to the first answer, that's illegal.<br>  Throw that laptop in the bin.

UF8qU5cGaa	No, you can't use the infrared, but you *CAN* connect and sync it with your Mac!<br>  <br>  PocketMac for PSP is a program that will sync your contacts, music & photos from your Mac to your Playstation Portable!  <br>  <br>  PocketMac For PSP takes care of everything for you. Install the software on your Mac, hook up your PSP via USB or via the Memory Stick that comes with your PSP in a reader. <br>  <br>  Configure which options you want enabled (Contacts, Music, Photo, etc.), And start the sync. That's literally it.<br>  <br>  The infrared on your Mac can be used by other applications, even within a virtual machine running VMWare!|`|9tMNpFmEaa	No. Macbooks will only work with Apple products, because everything that is Apple works with them. Nothing else, because that's just impossible.|`|GBXvJ5mjaa	The first post doesn't know what he's talking about I have a logitech remote that works with it wonderfully. But to answer your question, this port is for the remote only. I do not believe you can transfer data between this port and even if you could you would need a program on the mac side and a sync option on the psp side. Which there is neither, the idea for this is actually quite dumb though. IR data transfer it notoriously slow, and usb access is really fast. So just use usb, if you don't have a cord, people now have plenty of these in their junk doors being that it is a standard mini-usb interface, and you can oder one on ebay for like $1.43 after shipping.|`|JhgKvS13aa	hi liam.... lol|`|DU2Mypjiaa	no

1cdsJ3lpaa	Well for a gaming computer your GPU solution should really be your most expensive part but that build seems fine for light gaming. Although having two optical drives seems kinda pointless. <br>  <br>  Hmmm for $1024.69 this sounds like your buying a pre built computer. So I guess your customizing a computer not building one.|`|Y0zwVG1Xaa	First of all I pasted links for your stuff I found on www.newegg.com to make it easier for yourself and others to view specs. I also have the links to issues I found and their solutions. <br>  <br>  You can save money by dropping the CPU down to a dual core since quads are not utilized as of yet. Also your CPU does come with a heat sink and fan. You could get rid of the cooler to save some more money. You would really only need more than what comes with the CPU if you planned on over clocking. If you do plan on overclocking you will need a liquid cooled system and not what you are buying there. The ram you want is not on the qualified vendors list or QVL. The good news is I gave you a link to the same brand and size ram that is on your qvl and it's only a $1.00 more. I also put a link to the mobo website to download the QVL. I suggest a 64bit OS since you are running over 3GB of ram. Otherwise you don't use the other GB. Also your system supports up to 1066MHZ ram if you were interested in going higher. Just look for the serial number in the QVL and then use it to find the ram. Your power supply is ok, but could be a little higher. Your Cpu requires 95Watts and your GPU eats up 450Watts. That puts you at 545Watts and leaves just 55watts to power the case fans, Cd/DVD roms, Case lights, and HDD. It doesn't leave much room for upgrades. I would maybe bump it up to at least 650, but you can get away with what you got. Your Motherboard is micro ATX and your case does support that so its good. The GPU requires a 6-pin and your current PSU has two so that is also good. Everything looks good and will handle the games you want to play. Some side notes. The heat sink that comes with the CPU will have thermal paste on it. When installing it, push the push pins in, in an X pattern. Top left bottom right etc. That way it will seat properly. Start looking for another CD rom. The writers tend to burn out quickly if you are burning with them. Sometimes a non writable Rom is a good $20 investment. Be sure to install the motherboard spacers and don't bolt it directly to the case. Wear an esd bracelet. Radio shack calls it an anti-shock strap.

1Rq2tdcKaa	Try going to "layer", "new", "light". Once you have the light on your composition turn it into a 3D layer (you can do that be going down to the bottom of the After Effects screen, or where ever you have the footage for your composition, and checking the box underneath the picture of a tiny cube).  Push the light back behind the letters using the "Z axis". Once its at the distance behind the letters that you desire, click on the Rotate/Wotate tool (you can push "W" on your keyboard as the shortcut). use the rotation tool on the "Y axis" of the light until it is facing the screen. That should work for you, and you can re-adjust the Z axis position with the selection tool (the picture of the cursor at the top of the window, or by pressing "V" on your keyboard)

Cheap psu's are noisy, run hot, and are rated at 'peak' so they are maxed out at their rating.

ClerfK2Qaa	Hi.<br>  RAQ Report is an Excel-like reporting tool. With the Parameter Template and Parameter Handler Class of RAQ Report, you can realize the function of saving inquiry conditions much faster and easier.<br>  Operation<br>  1. Design a parameter template with three more parameters: Whether to save, saveName, and listSave.<br>  2. Design a parameter table for the parameter handler class. When input parameters needs to be saved, the parameter handler class saves them in the designed parameter table which contains userName, reportName, saveName, argName and saveValue. The SQL statements are as follows:<br>  CREATE TABLE param (  <br>  userName varchar(100) not null , <br>  reportName varchar(100) not null , <br>  saveName varchar(100) not null,<br>  argName varchar(100) not null,<br>  saveValue varchar(200) )<br>  Then, user can visit the parameter template. If he selects saved parameter value for inquiry, it will be fetched from database in parameter handler class. Also, he is allowed to input new parameter for inquiry and choose whether to save the newly inputted parameter.<br>  For more details and graphic illustration, you can refer to my blog at <a href="http://freezea.blogspot.com/." rel="nofollow">http://freezea.blogspot.com/.</a><br>  Good luck.

They Have Firewall. Firewall is the main Guard of your PC and the entire system. Firewall can Block fully,Medium, or can be turned off. Also, usually and most probably when somethings enters your PC the Firewall takes care of it. You can Either Choose to block it or let it pass. So therefore the Only guard you need is already installed in your PC. Now Let the 3rd party or anything that tries to come in, If you need it let it pass if not NEVER. If the case is that it was not detected Completely Turn on the Firewall. If that, There are only safe and selected sites you can enter. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So...Windows Firewall can pretty much make you safe.<br>  Even so, Installing a Firewall wont be much of a problem.<br>  if I were to recommend Use McAfee, AvG, Norton any of those are Good...

dEI55xwhaa	Not really anyway to check the temp in the windows environment because RAM isn't usually fitted with thermal sensors (unless you have some of that high end RAM with those LEDs on top). Your RAM temp should be fine unless you up the voltage out of operating range. Check with the manufacturer's website and support forums, usually tests have been carried out to find out what voltage settings are safe.<br>  <br>  If you are really worried about the RAM, try getting an old fan and tie it to the RAM modules (securely but gently as not to damage them). Even a little bit of air movement is better than the usual stagnant air hanging around RAM.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Your processor temperature should also be checked. Try using Core temp.<br>  source 2.

NZxvybYUaa	Most new NIC's (and many older ones) are auto-sensing, making it unnecessary to use a crossover cable, even if only one is auto-sensing. Just connect a CAT5 cable from one to the other. Run the internet sharing wizard on the desktop, and the laptop will be able to use the internet as long as the desktop is powered on.|`|JxxZpxqmaa	Typical networking uses Cat5 or higher ethernet cables, with an RJ-45 connector (Phone are RJ-11).  If you're doing a straight computer to computer connection, you will need whats known as a crossover cable.  There are also other configuration parameters you will need to adjust in windows.<br>  <br>  Assuming you already have a broadband internet connection, the easiest course of action would be to purchase a wireless router (assuming your laptop has integrated wireless capabilities).  This will provide additional ports to plug your computers in (or wirelessly) and create a home network of devices which can communicate with one another, and share the internet connection.|`|ZIPd99xtaa	Assuming they both have network connectors, that would be the way to go.<br>  Buy a CAT5 crossover cable from your computer store and then with the internet connected, printer turned on and both computers running, connect the cable and run the Network connection wizard on both machines. You must allow file and printer sharing when asked.|`|MKuDawP7aa	You need UTP cable, it's availble everywhere. You also need to buy a hub or switch. You connect the cable to your computer and to the switch then from the switch you go to your laptop. and that's it. configure windows for internetsharing and you're online. You could also buy a wireless set.

Having a good anti-virus is great, and I suggest you download Mozilla Firefox, the second fastest after Google Chrome (though it can be legally tweaked to speed up) and the safest one available. <br>  <br>  After you have Firefox, be sure to go to <a href="http://www.mywot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mywot.com/</a> (Web of Trust). It is really interesting and it is a free service that will help you out.<br>  <br>  There is a small Firefox Add-On that you can download. There is something for Internet Explorer too. Now, in this Firefox Add-On, which displays in the navigation bar, there will be an icon that says how reliable the site can be and it has details on 'Trustworthiness', 'Vendor Reliabilty', 'Privacy' and 'Child Safety'. <br>  <br>  All this information is collected from various votes from people around the world. After a bit experience, you can register yourself free and help them by rating the websites you visit in the given categories. This will help others to be safe too. I recommend this. You'll like it. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	Yes, they do.  However, you can use Firefox with the WOT (Web of Trust) add on and it will warn you if a site is dangerous.|`|UrQmkYDUaa	It siply yes.

Once it has been written to and the session closed (the disc ejected) its content can not be changed.  It is permanent.<br>  <br>  The CD-RW is "Re-Writable" (thus the letters RW).  However, to use the re-writable feature you have to special format the disk, a process which takes about 20 minutes per disk.  Check you CD burning software and it will normally have an option to format a CD-RW.  If the disk is NOT formatted, then it acts just like a CD-R.<br>  <br>  If you already have files on the CD, you should be able to copy them to your computer, format the disc, and then put them back.  But be warned the CD-RW is one of the least reliable ways to store files.  They are infamous for their failure rate and loss of data.

IzCCoKNoaa	The GridView control is quiet a handy control and is the most commonly used control when building an ASP.NET site.

To ensure that you get rid of this virus you should take a power drill (I use a Black & Decker) and bore as many holes as possible into your hard drive.  Then, (since the computer is an extension of our central nervous system) you should place the drill at different latitudes around your cranium.

Same answer as for Excel, right button of mouse on empty part of menu bar area, down to customise, make sure the two standard toolbars, standard and formatting are on 2 rows and full menus are displayed. Bring in drawing toolbar, take it to the top instead of at the bottom. Add extra icons to the toolbars. Change font and size by default. Change margins and orientation of page by default. Change line spacing, change paragraph spacing, change line justification, change indentation, change character spacing - there is no end to what you can do. What you do need to do for yourself is to place your mouse over every single icon, look at your task bar, your status bar, your title bar, your menu bar your tool bars, and get to know your computer.
RyvKws7Laa	(1) Are you ready to learn a new operating system?  Its not a hard operating system, but you need to understand it is a different one from Windows.  You will have to deal with learning new ways to use a computer.  This isn't a good vs bad issue, its just a question you have to answer honestly for yourself (some people are in a point in their life where that's not a good fit).<br>  <br>  (2) Forget all the marketing and hype, at the end of the day a Mac is still a computer.  So it will run into problems eventually.  Its not better or worse than windows, its just a reality of it being a computer, no way around it.  So are you super hands on and able to trouble shoot problems on your own?  If yes, then a Mac is still an okay choice.  If no, then you have to ask yourself, what kind of support network do you have around you for the Mac?  Do friends, family, classmates, co-workers, etc. own Macs?  Is there a store near you that sells Macs and has an on-site Mac certified technician?    <br>  <br>  (3) It is quite easy to install Windows onto a Mac now.  The Mac comes with built in software the help guide the process.  You just need to pay for a licensed copy of Windows.  So you can get your Mac and run both OS X and Windows (just run whichever you need for what you're doing).  That is another option to think about.  But then you might want to be more concerned with how much hard drive space you're getting if you're going to be installing 2 operating systems onto a laptop.  Just throwing it out there.<br>  <br>  (4) You can't go by what people on the Internet say about good vs bad.  Macs and Windows PCs both have pros and cons.  Neither are better or worse overall, they are simply better or worse for YOU.  You need to do a long test drive of a Mac in a store and really get a feel for it.  See if you're comfortable with it.  Don't worry about 20 people saying Macs rule or 20 people saying Macs are terrible.  These are just fanboys that need to get a life.  The computer is for you, so you need to make the honest assessment of yourself and your preference of operating styles.<br>  <br>  ====<br>  <br>  Alienware are solid machines.  They will be roaring fast and likely fairly slick looking.  Some models can be customized to be outperform an equivalent Mac.  But at the end of the day they are going to likely be running Windows (unless you're ready to make the Linux jump).  So despite how good their hardware is, you again have to decide for yourself whether you're currently interested in Windows or not.  I'm not saying its good or bad, but again, a decision you just need to make for yourself.|`|UrHJyqKjaa	Alienware is insanely good laptop brand for gaming, with the best graphics and speed to date. Nice interior and looks cool especially if you're 25 yrs old and below and a hardcore gamer. Pretty heavy and its hardwares (and the laptop itself) are INSANELY expensive.

SJM0rzHtaa	No.  You CANNOT use a Pentium-4 on a P45-chipset motherboard.<br>  <br>  Even though the P45 boards have an LGA775 socket, they do not have the right Voltage Reduction Modules nor the chipset support for old Pentium-4s.  If you put that P4 into a P45 board, it won't even boot.<br>  <br>  Intel phased out chipset support for the P4 a couple years ago.   The only Intel chipsets that work with both P4s and Core 2 CPUs are the 945 (65nm Core 2 Duo only), 965 and 975X chipsets.

8SN0htNnaa	Unfortuatly with your specs I don't think it is do-able. <br>  <br>  You only have a 40gb HDD and to create a Virtual PC you will need to sacrifice 10GB of that just for Vista to install and run cleanly. The lack of free HDD space will then slow down XP from which you will have to run the virtual PC<br>  Your other problem is RAM. Vista Premium needs 2GB alone. So that is simply a no go. Home Basic needs 512mb-1GB add that to the RAM XP is using and there will be hardly any (if any at all) to test vista with.<br>  Basically you can try to install Vista home basic (and miss out on most of the features of vista) and even then it might make the computer unbearably slow!

8SN0htNnaa	200MHz is probably your external clock value (for a newish computer). Which will mean you computer has a 2.0GHz processor. Vista ideally need 2.2GHz. What I cannot tell from the information provided is if your processor is a duel core in which case that should be fine.<br>  I think your main problem is the RAM. To run Vista Home Premium it is recommended that a minimum of 2GB of RAM is installed. You have less than half of this amount! <br>  I simply think that your computer isn't up to running Vista Home Premium. You could try vista basic or move down to XP.|`|k5KuYkkKaa	200MHz?

Tell your teacher he's a jerk for giving you such a misleading task, either do a real password system or none at all, this will just confuse poor students into creating insecure code.<br>  <br>  As for what you are trying to do, right now you are asking for each password in the array. You generally shouldn't use the prompt function as it will obstruct many browsers, instead just provide a password input field and a button to click. If you want to go ahead as you have planned you will need a variable set false that shows no correct answer has been provided, a while loop that keeps going as long as that variable is false, the prompt inside that loop, and a for loop to check if the entered password match any of the given passwords (remember to store the index for reference when a match is found).

BIOS software - The BIOS software is crappy; and depending on the version of your BIOS software and the exact model of your laptop, you may not be able to have sound in Linux. the onboard sound card settings conflict with the ACPI settings in Toshiba's BIOS software. You *may* be able to extract, patch, re-insert your DSDT file on linux to fix this, but again, it depends on the specific model of your laptop (it doesn't work for mine - I have to use USB audio). No BIOS software problems with Windows.<br>  <br>  5. Recovery Disks - I don't use these anymore as they kept crashing my computer. They actually damaged my hard drive when they crashed while creating the primary partition.<br>  <br>  6. Software - You get the recovery disks, so it restores Windows to the factory settings (default) when you restore. But even when you haven't yet installed anything, the bootup is S-L-O-W on Windows. Also you get a lot of 'trial' (junk) software that you have to spend ages uninstalling LOL.<br>  <br>  7. Monitor - spiffy!!<br>  <br>  8. Performance - meh I think its okay but I'm not into doing much with it. I would definitely *not* recommend it if you want it for gaming; I don't think the onboards graphics could survive!! lol<br>  <br>  9. Laptop lid - very sturdy.

syC3uQpjaa	Find an interesting subject to photograph. Your subject should be able to sit still, and it should contain some depth. Your buddy in front of a bare white wall will look as boring in 3-D as he or she does normally. Consider close-ups of detailed things. You will probably want to set your camera to macro mode - the symbol is typically a flower. <br>  Your subject needs to be able to sit still because you will be taking two "as-identical-as-possible" photos: one for the left-eye view and one for the right. A tripod might be nice, but it certainly isn't necessary. Take the first photo, then move the camera about 2 inches (the distance between your eyes) to the right and try to retake the photo to be as identical to the last one as possible. <br>  Copy the two images to your computer. Open in whatever photo editing program you prefer. <br>  Convert the first (left) image to grayscale (yes, you are discarding color information). <br>  Convert the second (right) image to grayscale, then reconvert it back to RGB. It should still appear gray. <br>  Still working on your second image, change your program to a mode that controls color channels. Select just the Red channel (usually designated by an eye icon next to the selected channel.) <br>  Back on the first image, select all ( + ), then copy ( + ) the image. Return to the second image and make sure the color channels are still displayed with only the Red channel selected. Now paste the first image that you copied. Now select the RGB channel. This replaces the Red channel of the second image with the first image. You should now see a grayscale image with red and blue halos. <br>  Move the red layer around with the mouse or arrow keys so that the two line up, minimizing the halos. <br>  Examine the photo while wearing your red-blue glasses (red over the left eye). You can change the natural focal point of the photo by readjusting the red layer's alignment. Eliminate the halos around an object in your photo to make it the focal point. <br>  If it is just not working for you, try looking through the glasses backward (red over the right eye). When you have something you like, crop off the red and blue edges of the photo and save it. A well done 3-D photo should look mostly gray with small shadows of red and blue.|`|e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	2D?

DWU0iCbVaa	Go to Start>>(Right Click)My Computer>>Manage>>Disk Manager>>Locate your new HDD and format it with whatever drive name you want and File System.|`|nGUeZDJcaa	There's quite a few possibilities here.  Your friend told you right, there's no jumper settings for a Sata drive, so as long as your ide drive is jumpered to master or cable select(if cs, make sure its connected to the right connector on the cable) that should be fine.  Here's what I'd try first:<br>  When you boot your machine, hit the key that allows you to enter the bios.  Usually either <del> or <f2>, but there are others, watch the text on the screen when you first power on the system to see how to get in there.  On the first screen you will USUALLY see a list of devices attached to the system, look to see if you have multiple HDD's.  The sata will look something like WDC2500AJ or something like that.  If you see that, the bios is recognising the drive.  <br>  If not:  Check with your system manufacturer to see if a bios update is required for your system to use Sata drives.  Unusual for a newer machine, but a possibility.  Otherwise, the drive MIGHT be DOA.  Does it spin up?  Does it make any unusual clicking noises?<br>  If it IS recognised in the bios:<br>  When you boot into windows, right-click on My Computer<br>  Choose "Manage"<br>  Choose "Disk Management"<br>  Look for the drive, you probably will have to initialize it before Windows can use it, this is often the case.  To do so, simply right click on the drive and hit "Initialize Disk", and Voi-lah!  <br>  <br>  There are other possibilities, but those I think are the most likely.<br>  Good Luck!

($500 minimum required to start this program, so if you .... How much cash do you have to start?* ($500+ required!) ...<br>  www.fatcashdaily.com/<br>  <br>  <br>  Fraudulent Sweepstakes Techniques<br>  One in Five Prizes <br>  <br>  "You're going to get one of these top five prizes, guaranteed!"<br>  <br>  "These are the big awards that we don't even like to give out, we just simply have to do it."<br>  <br>  In a one-in-five scheme, the telemarketer tells you that you have been chosen for one of five "valuable" prizes; however, you are first pressured into buying a promotional product at an inflated price. You are told that the "small amount of money" you are required to send in will pale in comparison to the value of the prize you will win.<br>  <br>  In reality, however, the promotional product along with the prize actually awarded, typically a relatively cheap "gimmie gift", are worth, at most, about 30% of the remitted payment.<br>  <br>  What's to Lose?<br>  <br>  Deceptive prize promotion schemes often result in losses per consumer of anywhere from a few hundred dollars to thousands of dollars and, in some cases, people have lost their entire life savings to such scams.<br>  <br>  One witness at a Senate hearing testified that she lost over $74,000 to fraudulent telemarketers over a one year period. One 80-year-old woman sent in her entire month's income only because the salesman had assured her she had won a large cash award.<br>  <br>  In one case, victims were told that for a one-time fee, they were guaranteed one of the major prizes, a bonus watch, and a three-year membership in a credit card protection plan. The offer was accepted by 18,527 people, all of whom provided their bank account and credit card numbers. Using this information, the company received $1,158,228 from successful debits.<br>  <br>  Out of this, the operation spent a total of $34,523 on credit card protection service for some of the victims, obtained through a legitimate business, which for a $10 fee per person, recorded the victim's credit card numbers and notified the appropriate companies if the cards were lost or stolen, along with an additional $7,750 spent on "bonus" watches.<br>  <br>  Some Purchases Required<br>  <br>  In a flurry of dizzying double-talk they say all of the prizes are large and valuable, but in order to receive your prize they may insist you pay a processing fee for handling, customs duties or taxes, and you must send a check or money order to them by overnight mail.<br>  <br>  They may want to leave you with something you perceive as commercially tangible, after they have taken your money, so in order to claim your valuable "mystery prize", "one-in-five prize" or "award" you are told that you will first have to purchase something. They will sound quite reasonable when they express that:<br>  <br>  "Of course great contests wouldn't be possible, and the company couldn't very well stay in business long, without some sales along the way".<br>  <br>  "You need to buy something to comply with the sweepstakes rules."<br>  <br>  "It's only fair to get something after winning such a great prize. Don't you think?"<br>  <br>  "You'll get a wonderful free bonus if you buy our product."<br>  <br>  Depending on the operations choice it may vary, but will likely include some of the following:<br>  <br>   vitamins <br>   cosmetics <br>   pen and letter opener sets <br>   costume jewelry <br>   cleaning products <br>   promotional items <br>   magazine subscriptions which you may not even receive <br>   small trinkets of minimal value compared to the payments made <br>   "Say No to Drugs" items like hats, pens, Frisbees and lapel buttons <br>   a contribution to bogus charities <br>   other merchandise or services <br>   discount coupons or vouchers <br>  <br>  The impressive-sounding brand names defy after-the-fact comparison shopping, they are so obscure. All of the items are provided to you at what turn out to be grossly-inflated prices. One telemarketer conceded that he sold pen sets, vitamins, and makeup for $299 to $999 when their cost ranged from $10-200.<br>  <br>  Magazines for Life<br>  <br>  You may be told you will win an additional watch or a camera and will also be entered into an "all cash sweepstakes" with a grand prize of $50,000 and an early bird prize of $5,000, but only if you purchase or renew a magazine subscription.<br>  <br>  Callers may offer "free," "prepaid," or "special" deals on magazine subscriptions. The total cost is never mentioned, merely that you will get the magazines for "just pennies per week", But you end up paying hundreds of dollars for subscriptions that normally sell for much less. Some consumers who ordered or renewed multiple subscriptions for more than one year, spent several hundred dollars on a single transaction.<br>  <br>  "We've extended this amazing offer just one more day, and we have to receive your money by midnight tonight.

When one computer sends data no other can send, if it happens, you will have a data collision and, in some cases, the data is lost. As it is possible to check, it is not a smart device. If you have a lot of computers in your network, probably you will not have a good performance<br>  <br>  2- SWITCH: Seems like a hub, but the big difference is that a switch can delivery the data directly to the specified computer. It happens because the switch can create a table with the address of all computers in your network. This table is refreshed time by time. If you change, remove or add a computer, your switch will insert the new address very fast.<br>  <br>  3- ROUTER: Has the same specifications as the switch, but the router is smarter. It can choose not only the target computer, but also the best way to reach it. Usually, router already comes with a firewall. It is really good, because it is not necessary to install one in your computer. It is the best choice for a network, but you need to know how to set it up, otherwise it will be a madness for you.<br>  <br>  Regards!|`|aet0tFi9aa	A device that serves to enhance the connection on the LAN.

VbP8YWonaa	Is your pc a desktop or laptop. In general most Linux distributions will not work with wireless but will work with on connected by cable (NIC CAT5). Reason vendors will not release their wireless chip set codes to open source. So far Raltech is the only one made their source code available for Linux. It requires downloading files and compiling them for wireless drivers. Not an easy task for someone who doesn't know how the use the Linux console environment.There are other ways just as complicated to perform the same thing. If hardwired by cable you need to go to adminstrative menu and find the network item and set it up from there. Most Linux will automaticall a computer connected by cable.

If it was really 193.268, that's not even a valid internet address - they only go up to 255 right now.  If you just mistyped that and it was 192.168.1.1 like in your subject, it's still BS.  There's no way that a router can be trained to "find" a computer faster.  The only thing you could modify in software on the router is broadcast power (which is probably already at 100%) or a packet shaper (which most consumer routers don't have).  <br>  <br>  Everything else you can do to fix this problem costs money, except for maybe hopping on an unprotected neighbor's signal.  That's technically illegal.  Sorry.
Pxkqq8r2aa	dvdfab has a free version called dvdfab hd decrypter. Its one of the best dvd ripping tools around. <br>  <br>  If you're just ripping to your hard drive (ie not burning to dvd) its pretty much perfect for that.<br>  <br>  If you want to make copies of the dvd, use dvdshrink. it *wont* rip the dvd's but it will get them to fit on a standard 4 gig dvd blank. If for some reason you dont like dvdfab free to do the ripping, there are plenty of alternatives such as ripit4me and the venerable dvd decrypter. DVD43 is another good choice. All free. All can be used to rip the dvd to your hd before using dvdshrink to fit it onto a dvd blank.<br>  <br>  IF you are wanting to do file conversions, (WMV, AVI, MP4, etc) substitute dvdshrink for Handbrake or Format Factory. Either of these apps will convert the VOB files on your hard drive from the dvd to pretty much any video file format you want. Both are free.|`|k7YMROOBaa	look on torrent reactor<br>  <br>  thay have adobe flash which is ￡600 new<br>  free there and everything

Each module that you display has it's own privacy control. Select customize profile and your profile will load below. Hover your mouse over the top of each module and a box will appear with icons. Select the one that looks like a lock. You can set privacy on this box only or select apply to all modules to make the whole page private. Hope that helps.

Tick empty temp files when browser closes (this empties the cache, which if not empty, will stop you from going online).<br>  2. Bullet disable phishing filter (optional. Leave it on if you want that type of protection, usually for financial data like internet banking).<br>  Delete Browser History, cookies, add ons,  the whole lot regularly.<br>  Close the browser to set the settings.|`|jw6OjQkEaa	try to reformat ur pc or try to uninstalll ur zango

41423bdda3cea07a45b2f8b805b908d7aa	Don't listen to anyone else. You HAVE to install Windows first, then Linux.<br>  <br>  Windows XP sometimes doesn't recognize linux partitions during setup, but Linux DOES recognize Windows partitions.<br>  <br>  Also Windows XP will erase your Linux bootsector (it's nasty you see) when it see's it. Linux will keep Windows XP boot option intact.<br>  <br>  Thus that's the best way. Also which OS are you installing? If it's Ubuntu it contains a nice tool to create a dual-boot from within Windows. Just stick the CD in whilst running windows and you select how you want to install Ubuntu from 3 different options.<br>  <br>  Best regards.<br>  <br>  Edit: Ubuntu is the best. Do your research on it. More hardware freindly and more usable than any other flavour of Linux.|`|5zSSGKBpaa	You don't have to install windows first but it is easier that way and that is the situation most people actually have.<br>  You computer does not run both OSes at the same time. You can only use one at a time. You will have to stop one OS and reboot into the other.<br>   Before installing I would suggest that you get the live-cds for various linux distros to see which one will work best on YOUR computer hardware. Some versions of linux have problems with some graphics cards (nvidia seems to work best) and wireless cards. The live-cd will not make any changes to your hard drive, and it will run a little slow because it is running from the cd and not the hard drive. Once it is installed it will run like all your other programs. If everything works with the live-cd everything will work when installed. If for example your wireless won't work with the live-cd if you install it it will need to have some work done (look for and install new drivers, edit configuration files, etc). It CAN usually be fixed but it will take a little work and for a person new to linux it can be very frustrating.<br>  When you find one that works and you like I would also suggest that you read the instructions and tutorials from the website of that distro on how to install, setup and use linux. This will make using linux a much more pleasant experience.<br>  If you just go ahead and install linux and try to use it the same way you used windows you are almost guaranteed to be frustrated and unhappy. Linux may sorta kinda look like windows but it is not windows and you have to do things a little differently in linux. I am not saying it is hard to use linux just different. <br>  Good luck|`|Ev6WQRmzaa	Windows|`|rHqe7oMoaa	Windows.

tIDNEwdMaa	A list of common lies and misinformation and plain old stupidity against the Macintosh platform:<br>  <br>  1) Macs are more expensive than PC's<br>    a) Macs have a useful life about twice that of PC's.   A Mac user will be replacing his computer half as often as a PC user.  Do the math.  Macs are cheaper than PC's.<br>    b) How many times have you bought a PC with the idea of going somewhere to buy the hardware necessary to upgrade it?  The only thing I add when I bring a new Mac home is memory, which I get cheaper from someone other than Apple.  Do the math.  Macs are cheaper than PC's.<br>  <br>  2) "Everyone" uses Windows.<br>    a) Gee.  Isn't that nice.<br>    b) If "Everyone" uses Windows, why are we having this conversation?<br>    c) Just because it is "popular" does nor mean it is a good thing.  Hula Hoops, pet rocks, Tomakachi, etc were all popular at one time.  Popular does have a long standing and is not a standard by which to judge the usefulness of a product.<br>  <br>  3) Windows is better for gaming than Macs.<br>    a) True, but if the people who keep saying this truly stood by the logic of what is the better system from games, they would instead say something like, "don't listen to those idiots who say Macs suck at games.  Get yourself a game console like PS2 or Xbox.  A game console is better at games than Windows."  But they aren't saying that are they?  What good is their advice is they can't stand by it themselves?<br>  <br>  4) There isn't enough software for the Mac.<br>  a) With the exception of games (read #3), there is no type of software application available for Windows that is not available for the Mac.  While you may not find a Macintosh version of an application made by the same company for some products, you will still find selects for the same task.<br>  b) Volume?  Yes, there is a large number of selections for Windows than for the Mac, but walk down the aisle and see how much of that selection is crap and/or outdated (and discounted) software.  Take that software out of the pictures and the gap narrows considerably.<br>  <br>  5) There isn't enough hardware for the Mac.<br>  a) Like the software misinformation, hardware selection for the Mac is lesser in number, but not as it is for software.  Hardware is not OS specific.  It is driver controlled.  A couple weeks of coded and testing will create a driver for the Mac OS.  Most companies are willing to take the time and expense of doing this.  Based on my experience, it is the crap hardware that usually does not have Mac drivers.  This is because the manufacturer knows that crap hardware does not have a future among Mac users.  We won't buy it.<br>  <br>  6) Macs are gay!<br>  a) This is so sophomoric, it's hard t respond to.  Why take advice from someone who would think this is an intelligent argument?  'nuff said.<br>  <br>  7) Software written for Windows will not run on a Mac.<br>  a) Software written the Mac will no run in Windows.  I guess by this logic, you can't buy a computer at all.<br>  b) Well, not exactly.  While there is no [legal] way to run the Mac OS in Windows, you can use Boot Camp or Parallels to run Windows on a Mac, which means you can run Windows software on a Mac.  But this is not a good reason to get a Mac, as getting away from Windows is one of the reasons to use a Mac.<br>  <br>  8) Windows 7 is coming out soon and will be better than Vista.<br>  a) Windows 7 is essentially an improved version of Vista.  Microsoft decided to remove the Vista name plate to increase sales.  If it doesn't say Vista, then it isn't Vista.  Buyers will think it is better.<br>  b) Only Windows ME was worse than what it replaced.  While Windows 7 is likely to be better than Vista.  This does not mean that it will be better than Mac OS.  This argument compares Windows to Windows, not Windows to the Mac.  What value does this argument have?<br>  <br>  9) Mac are for multimedia.<br>  a) Yes, there are.<br>  b) Macs are for web browsing, video editing, photo editing, audio editing, word processing, blogging, email, home work, writing, research, and everything else you might want to do with a home computer.<br>  <br>  10) Macs are for idiots.<br>  a) Let me translate:  "Macs are easier to use than PC's, so that must be designed for stupid people, right?"  Tom Hanks, Stephen Speilberg, Buss Aldin, Martha Stewart, the late Bris Yelsin, Malcom Forbes, Jr, Richard Dawkins, Tom Clancy, Scott Adams, Trent Reznor, The Rolling Stones, Bono, Conan O'Brien, Jerry Seinfeld, Rush Limbaugh, Mel Gibson, Clint Eastwood, and Tim Allen, must all be idiots.  But I'm sure that anyone can compile a list of smart people who use Windows.  The intelligence of the user is not correlated with their choice of computer.  This argument is either driving by the low intelligence of the person saying it, or but "sure grapes".<br>  <br>  11) You can't upgrade a Mac.<br>  a) I have no idea where this lie comes from.  Yes, you can upgrade a Mac.  Thing is, why would you need to upgrade your Mac?  With the possible exception of Memory, the Mac come fully loaded.  And for most people, the Mac comes with enough Memo|`|HxHvhZAsaa	neither one is a good choice. mac sucks for games, as i don't think any are designed for macs, and the vaio does not seem to have a graphics card by your info. don't get a computer from a oem unless you want crap quality. go to ibuypower.com or something like that and custom build yours. do some research and figure out what you need and don't need.<br>  <br>  if you stick with only those two options you will find yourself playing nothing at all im sure of it. no gfx card? not a chance, mac? just as bad with a gfx card haha|`|xYgFcEfwaa	oh boy...<br>  read the spec again... ????<br>  if you are a girl then pick the MAC<br>  otherwise that sony is way better than the MAC and it will kill the mac easily and of you into game and the sony is more compatible and you wont have issues and can upgrade later <br>  with MAC you STUCK :)|`|m4nKkFDUaa	Both are very good, but for gaming, the mac is fairly redundant and the vaio isn't the best. I'd look at the Dell XPS range of laptops for gaming if I were you, as they're reliable and some of them were built specifically for gaming.|`|YxL0GyzMaa	PC!!!!!!!!!!!!! PC!!!!!!!!!!!!!

7yZksOlRaa	happens to us all sometimes,if your pc decides to update or do something in the backround,it takes that little bit of power and ram your using for the game,and causes allsorts of errors.as long as the game loads back up i wouldnt worry to mucch,otherwise try updating your driver.hope this helps|`|0BOxZ5Ecaa	you did not say whether it is a laptop or a desktop p/c but i'll try anyway. 1st. most laptops do not have a good enough video card to play sims 2 unless the laptop is less than 1 yr old and at least midrange price wise. i would bet the graphics chip overheated and shut down. 2nd reason laptops don't do games well gaming stresses the hardware and causes it to generate heat that the laptop cooling system can not deal with. if you are using a deaktop computer you might be having the same problems as above due to excess dust or a failing video card or chip. or your hardware is too old to play sims 2. just a few reasons for your system to shutdown.trouble shoot the hardware for the above failings. as far as giving you a definite answer take it to your local computer repair store and explain what is happening they should be able to fix it. you did not give us enough information and in a lot of cases like this it is hard to diagnose a problem without sitting in front of the machine. so in this case the best answer is: take it to a local repair shop not geek squad or best buy their socalled techs don't know much more than the indians dell employs for their tech support.|`|wBnUZxbDaa	well in not sure what is causing this <br>  <br>  my guess is it's some thing wrong in your vga <br>  <br>  try downloading the latest vga drivers. remove the old driver and install the new one <br>  <br>  hope this helps <br>  contact me if you need any help <br>  Kaushalya Damitha

UAycF25eaa	im sorry but i think you have to buy a new battery now cuz usually they only last a while|`|f79a44bda7e4581623ca3e13cb6ad153aa	Laptop batteries don't have a very long life. You can always use the laptop plugged in to power. You don't need a battery to do that.<br>  <br>  Another possibility that you or the other answerers have not considered is that the battery symbol should not be showing if there is external power coming in. It could be that your power brick has died and not your battery.|`|20LnuCejaa	Laptop batteries do have a limited life span.  Depends on how many times they were discharged and how they were treated.  Shock and extreme temperatures also shortens their life, like leaving a laptop in the car during summer or winter.<br>  Once it reaches the end of its life, you can still use the laptop by leaving it plugged in.|`|jmgCpVkzaa	Hi Just Jess, usually the battery symbol showing in the task bar is a sign that you are not connected to ac power. check that your power brick is actually outputting juice. It could be that it is dead or the plug at the back from the power adapter is not fully in or that the plug or jack (inside the notebook itself) is broken. Try testing with another power supply of the correct type if possible or have a knowledgeable person with a multimeter, check at the plug (that goes into the pc) for any voltage. You should get 2 years out of a notebook battery easily and strangely enough I have read that the best way to preserve your notebook battery is to not use it. That would mean that we should use ac whenever possible I guess. Finally, you can use your notebook with a carked battery. It acts to smooth the voltage further from the power brick even when it is past help. Just got to use ac until battery replacement.<br>  Pip|`|sXTjYH7Iaa	Sounds like it.<br>  <br>  Try leaving the computer plugged in but switched off for two hours. Then unplug it and turn it on.

hXHBm1BSaa	Many power supplies do NOT have the switch. Also almost NO desktops or towers have multi-voltage supplies. You will need to fit a new one. Laptops are the only machines which have multi-voltage supplies. It is dangerous to take advice from someone who say  "it is probably ...." to do this will PROBABLY destroy your machine.|`|YTIDE8Evaa	as far as i know there is no more of those old power supplies which had 110 / 240 watt switches . (us - europe etc).<br>  <br>  They should work on both without problems. Try reading the sticker on your power supply if it supports both. if it doesn't go to an electricity shop for a converter.|`|JxxZpxqmaa	The switch on the back is for the AC input voltage, and does not affect the resulting DC current which the power supply produces.  If you were to switch it to run on 230v in the united states, your computer will not boot, and could possibly damage hardware.<br>  <br>  115v for USA, 230v for UK/Europe.<br>  <br>  If it does not have a switch, you might have to read the label on the power supply itself.  While some power supplies can automatically switch voltage, it would be safe to check.|`|d0231dcc170bb0de07aee5020b49aeeaaa	If you do not have a switch then you can not change the voltage, it is as simple as that, you could check the power input label to see if it is a 110-240 volt 50hz-60hz in which case it would work any where, most lap top chargers have this facility.|`|f7b6fb25c4a5d05b13f7d64d5680b899aa	My guess is when you plug it in, it automatically senses the input voltage, and automatically adjusts.<br>  <br>  Or, it is only for use in the US, and other countries that use 120V 60Hz.|`|cYWYARmVaa	if there isnt a switch it most likely takes both euro and american voltages (110-240)<br>  <br>  my old one had a switch but my new one doesnt, go figure :)

I have used geocities ( a yahoo family member) for years and years..its simple to use and free. There is a pay site, do a  search for Blue Voda, it is phenominal. Its like $99 for the first year, but thats all the hosting, domain name etc....then you design the page and input info at your own pace, etc. Here is my aunts site, she used Blue Voda for it and its super sharp looking.

MQKscLn6aa	Yes! Indeed. Your IP address is logged to the server. Each country, each state and each city has a different IP address much similar to the way that we have zipcodes. If you post a nasty message, the moderator can find out everything about you from your IP address. It can tell you where you are accessing the internet from. Using this IP address, if he decides to hack intoyuour system, he can even find out which OS are you using. What are you logged in as within your Windows profile. But this can only be done in a time span of 8 hours because dynamic IP addresses change every 8 hours. If you restart the computer in the meantime, the moderator would not be able to find out about your OS details susing the IP address, he can always determine the point of origin.|`|FIG58FVpaa	I don't think so.

aljvRlLNaa	It doesn't look like it comes with a modem.

You may have to base your choice of modem on what type of connections you have on your computer. Internal modems require a PCI slot. External modems require either a USB (almost every somewhat recent computer has this) or Serial (less common in more recent computers) connection.  The Mobo you are asking about has all 3 types of connections, so you should be safe no matter what you choose.  If you are installing Windows Vista, Make sure your modem is supported under Vista.|`|J5dEB9U2aa	Here is an internal modem card  http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/...

Others who say against this really don't have the right idea. The charging system in a modern laptop is very sophisticated and reduces power gradually as the battery capacity approaches full then merely trickles power once full. This is conditioned charging and simply means you can leave it on all the time. I do and my laptop battery is still good after nearly 3 years. Finally the power adapter is no more dangerous than any other electrical appliance. I personally have never heard of a power brick burning a house down.<br>  Pip

iMhAednhaa	If it were a new laptop i would suggest a few charge-discharge cycles. This helps train the battery for max performance.<br>  <br>  But I you have been using your laptop for longer, I feel it would be better to remove the battery from the laptop and then work on it.<br>  <br>  Do not worry, This is completely safe. What you need to do is, if your battery is 100% charged, keep the AC power plugged in and just remove the battery from the laptop by using the button located under the shell. <br>  <br>  Or a safer option will be to start the laptop on AC power only. Just remove the battery from behind, pug in the AC power and start!<br>  <br>  Make sure you keep that battery in a safe place. If damaged, can cost you thousands and if abused, i.e. physically damaged, eg. if they fall, could leak and render useless. So,just keep them in a cupboard out of children's reach!|`|oW68rhktaa	i was just going to answer the SAME thing... its strange no one answered!!! o_O <br>  what is the conclusion?

Other than that, Avast auto-updates the virus definitions and the program itself. It will protect you in real-time (stops the crap getting on your pc) against viruses, spyware, rootkits, etc. Very good for a freebie as AntiVir doesn't protect you against spyware and AVG doesn't protect you against rootkits.|`|W3LZ87Yuaa	yeah... i think so

How likely he is to get caught depends on where he got the photos. If he was sent them through something like msn by a girl then he will probably not get caught unless there is someone doing undercover work (unlikely) or they come to search his computer for another offense. If however he is getting these images off of child pornography websites then he is very likely to get caught by the police as thes sites are monitored. You should talk to your friend and make him stop this because if he is caught he will be punished to the full extent of the law and they really don't like pedophiles in prison.|`|RdiLWfDdaa	your friend is misguided, and he could us a kick up the ***. but in saying that looking at random pics of underage girls wont attract the attention of govt police enforcers. but if he acts on his feelings i htink u know aht i mean then its safe to say hes gona be doing time and thats where u need to come in and shut him down asap. or he will be behind bars|`|WPT3C7MAaa	He is still committing an offence, even if he is himself a teenager. If he's caught, he's in serious trouble.

f20d38f2d9e2702cb548cbcb14a06eb8aa	Both of the images you use in your examples can be achieved in Photoshop.  Photoshop is professional grade software with a lot to offer and a lot to learn.  <br>  <br>  I have taken 2 classes to learn to use Photoshop - 1 in a classroom & 1 online.  The "blending" as you are calling it is done using layers, each element in the photo is a separate layer.  Text is also added as a layer.  Each layer can be positioned and formated independant of the others. <br>  <br>  I would search for "Free Photoshop lessons" in Google.  The version of Photoshop is not all the important in achieving your goals here.  Focus on Layer use and adding layers.  <br>  <br>  And remember, check your image sizes.  Photos coming directly from digital cameras can be way, way too big (too many pixels) for online usage.  Use on the web = 72 dpi. Items to be printed =300 dpi.|`|Jj457iyJaa	This is the best thing you will do. Just go to the menu bar then see "Help" and know to use the tolls from it.

7IjGzvqTaa	Not sure why you can't talk about this on Yahoo! Answers...<br>  <br>  Anyway, I would suggest BitTorrent.  It's completely free and less likely to stick you with a virus that LimeWire is, though granted, not by much.  I've downloaded several movies and song albums, even computer games through that.  The only problem is that downloads can take a bit of time when very few people seed them.  I'm a patient person, so I'm okay with that, but I don't know what kind of schedule you're on.<br>  <br>  Anyway, that's my two cents.|`|SZ2uy4q0aa	Search for torrents and download with BitTorrent or uTorrent.|`|rSJYV6CHaa	type mu torrent in google and download the software and install it<br>  then go sites like www.isohunt.com,www.priatebay.org,www.ex...

6nmdvdEraa	Can I suggest to you that if you don't have the finances to go full swing at the the moment, that you start off small, as in advertise your service in the local paper, drop letterbox leaflets etc. and do the repairs after work and on weekends. This will give you a chance to get established with a client base and also let you see for sure if this is what you want to do and that you can do it. As for components like mother boards, I think most people expect them to be replaced rather than repaired, so I would not worry about that side of it. Can I also suggest that you make yourself a network expert, especially wireless, there is an ever growing need for this in the domestic and small business market. Once you gain some confidence you can target the small business market, the ones that can't afford or justify an in house IT person. Real estate offices are are good place to start, they will have a small network and a room full of dopey salesmen hitting the enter key til the system freezes..... can't beat regular customers<br>  Good luck.. hope you do it & succeed|`|fV2RBwIJaa	I'm exactly the same, but I started up my own computer repair business. It doesn't matter if you're qualified or not because if you fix the problem and make money everyone's happy. Start advertising your services and if you keep doing a good job word of mouth will get you more and more customers. Keep up the hard work and hopefully you'll be able to get tax registered and continue to grow. Just go for it.|`|esYTfoYraa	I also repair computers so i say go for it!<br>  I had no degree when i started but am mcse now

Open My Computer<br>    Right-click on C:<br>    Click Properties<br>    Click Tools, select Error Check (check all and fix), when finished click defrag & run.<br>  4. Click Start, Run ipconfig -renew (type ipconfig space renew)<br>  5. Restart. Right-click on Taskbar, click Toolbars, select Quick Launch to restore<br>  <br>  All these things should be done regularly. The more frequently they are run, the less time they take.<br>  -Note: Games and videos are mostly graphics. Graphics create large files. If these suggestions don't help, you might need more memory.<br>  <br>  Last, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Does a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>  Learn More: <a href="http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://downloadlk.com/WhyIsMyComputerSlo...</a>|`|FIG58FVpaa	There's really not much you can do to make a slow computer "seem" faster without changing anything.<br>  <br>  Upgrade the computer or live with it.|`|Pxkqq8r2aa	yes nlite is fine to use. its very good software. <br>  <br>  what you're asking is a very complicated question though.

There are some exceptions though. To find out if you can upgrade you'll want to restart the computer. You should see something that tells you to push a certain button to enter Bios. Do that. If you don't see that come up anywhere during boot up then it will probably be either f1, f10 or Delete. Once you get into Bios you will want to check for an option that allows you to disable the on-board video or it may be call integrated video. If there is an option to do that then yes you can upgrade. I would go with the best pci card you can find. It should be cheap. If there are no options for disabling the video than unfortunately your system is not upgradable.

You are better to present the page text for editing, and if you need layouts  use css, and the headers can be edited in a different inpout box. There is absolutely NO need to let anyone alter the actual head layout, this can be preset to read variables back form stored data. All changes should be stored in a database and read back as the page builds for display. Your way you can not control what anyone enters, as it permits people to place links to spyware, viruses, mail bombs and any other junk they want. Also to add scrip[ts that will allow them to trash your site, or even totally hijack it. Nobody builds dynamic sites using hard coderd page editing now. In fact, if this is how you see the answer to your site design, do NOT try to allow remote access until you haver studied a lot more. If you bring a hosting server down, you will not be popular.

zorYTX59aa	You have to be a YouTube "partner", which more-or-less means you are either<br>  a film or video creator/producer/director, an artiste (musician/singer/comedian),<br>  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance <br>  (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission <br>  (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).<br>  <a href="http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject</a><br>  <br>  But that is not enough to become a "partner".

Thus, you would need, for example, something like 800 <br>  subscribers and 20 videos or maybe 500 subs and 30 vids -- as well as a total <br>  view count close to the 1,000,000 mark.<br>  <br>  Once you've finally been "accredited" by the YouTube directors/administrators,<br>  they will give you all the special tools and codes which will enable you to have:<br>  -- a special "banner" for your profile page ?<br>  -- a mini-banner beside each played video <br>  -- your channel-page video on "autoplay"<br>  -- extra channel boxes: bulletins, profile<br>  -- automatic higher quality to your videos<br>  -- videos which are over 11 minutes long<br>  -- more options for your video thumbnails<br>  -- being at the very top of search results<br>  -- unique skins/sizes for the video player<br>  -- the possibility of earning "ad revenue"<br>  -- the light-bulb "watch at night" feature (if you are considered a "broadcaster")<br>  -- a "More From" section which overrides the regular "Related Videos" section<br>  and featuring only your uploaded videos.<br>  <br>  If you wish to know more, go to the top righthand corner of any YouTube page, <br>  click "Help" and then type in the searchbox the word "partner".

IzCCoKNoaa	Extreme Programming is a discipline of software development based on values of simplicity, communication, feedback, and courage. It works by bringing the whole team together in the presence of simple practices, with enough feedback to enable the team to see where they are and to tune the practices to their unique situation.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  In Extreme Programming, every contributor to the project is an integral part of the "Whole Team". The team forms around a business representative called "the Customer", who sits with the team and works with them daily.<br>  <br>  Core Practices: Whole Team <br>  Extreme Programming teams use a simple form of planning and tracking to decide what should be done next and to predict when the project will be done. Focused on business value, the team produces the software in a series of small fully-integrated releases that pass all the tests the Customer has defined.<br>  <br>  Core Practices: Planning Game, Small Releases, Customer Tests <br>  Extreme Programmers work together in pairs and as a group, with simple design and obsessively tested code, improving the design continually to keep it always just right for the current needs.<br>  <br>  Core Practices: Simple Design, Pair Programming, Test-Driven Development, Design Improvement <br>  The Extreme Programming team keeps the system integrated and running all the time. The programmers write all production code in pairs, and all work together all the time. They code in a consistent style so that everyone can understand and improve all the code as needed.<br>  <br>  Core Practices: Continuous Integration, Collective Code Ownership, Coding Standard <br>  The Extreme Programming team shares a common and simple picture of what the system looks like. Everyone works at a pace that can be sustained indefinitely. <br>  <br>  Core Practices: Metaphor, Sustainable Pace <br>  Core Practices<br>  Whole Team<br>  All the contributors to an XP project sit together, members of one team. This team must include a business representative -- the "Customer" -- who provides the requirements, sets the priorities, and steers the project. It's best if the Customer or one of her aides is a real end user who knows the domain and what is needed. The team will of course have programmers. The team may include testers, who help the Customer define the customer acceptance tests. Analysts may serve as helpers to the Customer, helping to define the requirements. There is commonly a coach, who helps the team keep on track, and facilitates the process. There may be a manager, providing resources, handling external communication, coordinating activities. None of these roles is necessarily the exclusive property of just one individual: Everyone on an XP team contributes in any way that they can. The best teams have no specialists, only general contributors with special skills.<br>  <br>  Planning Game<br>  XP planning addresses two key questions in software development: predicting what will be accomplished by the due date, and determining what to do next. The emphasis is on steering the project -- which is quite straightforward -- rather than on exact prediction of what will be needed and how long it will take -- which is quite difficult. There are two key planning steps in XP, addressing these two questions:<br>  <br>  Release Planning is a practice where the Customer presents the desired features to the programmers, and the programmers estimate their difficulty. With the cost estimates in hand, and with knowledge of the importance of the features, the Customer lays out a plan for the project. Initial release plans are necessarily imprecise: neither the priorities nor the estimates are truly solid, and until the team begins to work, we won't know just how fast they will go. Even the first release plan is accurate enough for decision making, however, and XP teams revise the release plan regularly.<br>  <br>  Iteration Planning is the practice whereby the team is given direction every couple of weeks. XP teams build software in two-week "iterations", delivering running useful software at the end of each iteration. During Iteration Planning, the Customer presents the features desired for the next two weeks. The programmers break them down into tasks, and estimate their cost (at a finer level of detail than in Release Planning). Based on the amount of work accomplished in the previous iteration, the team signs up for what will be undertaken in the current iteration.<br>  <br>  These planning steps are very simple, yet they provide very good information and excellent steering control in the hands of the Customer. Every couple of weeks, the amount of progress is entirely visible. There is no "ninety percent done" in XP: a feature story was completed, or it was not. This focus on visibility results in a nice little paradox: on the one hand, with so much visibility, the Customer is in a position to cancel the project if progress is not sufficient. On the other hand, progress is so visible, and the ability to decide what will be done next is so complete, that XP projects tend to|`|pXW69Naqaa	I hope you got it now.|`|4lMivWofaa	Hi mate,<br>  <br>  Can you please be a bit precise in what you want??<br>  Do you wanna write an article on Software development life cycle??

It is an optical illusion of motion due to the phenomenon of persistence of vision, and can be created and demonstrated in a number of ways. The most common method of presenting animation is as a motion picture or video program, although several other forms of presenting animation also exist.<br>  <br>  The Clone Wars is an American 3D CGI animated television series created by Lucasfilm Animation, Lucasfilm Animation Singapore and CGCG Inc.[3] The series debuted on the US-version of Cartoon Network on October 3, 2008.[2] It is set in the fictional Star Wars galaxy, during the same time period as the previous 2003 Star Wars: Clone Wars series. Each episode will have a running time of 22 minutes, to fill a half-hour timeslot. Star Wars creator George Lucas says "there will be at least 100 episodes produced."[4] Dave Filoni is the supervising director of the series.[5] Genndy Tartakovsky, director of the first Clone Wars series, is not involved with the production,[6] but character designer Kilian Plunkett referred to the character designs from the 2D series when designing the characters for the 3D series.[7] There also exists an Online-Comic,[8] depicting story-snippets between the single episodes.<br>  <br>  The first trailer for the series was released on the official Star Wars website on May 8, 2007.[9] The series was launched with a feature film, which was released in theaters on August 15, 2008. It is the second series (after Total Drama Island and 6TEEN) to be originally broadcast on the main Cartoon Network (i.e., outside of Toonami or Adult Swim) with a TV-PG rating.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Production<br>  At April 2005's Star Wars Celebration III, Lucas stated that "we are working on a 3-D continuation of the pilot series that was on the Cartoon Network; we probably won't start that project for another year."[6] In July 2005, pre-production had begun on the series, according to Steve Sansweet, head of Lucasfilm fan relations.[10] Sansweet referred to the series as "the next generation of the Star Wars saga, a cutting edge 30-minute, 3-D computer-animation series based on the Clone Wars that take place between Episode II ... and Episode III." Sansweet described the look of the new series as "a melding of Asian anime with unique 3-D animation styling." Primary production will take place at the Lucasfilm Animation facility in Singapore.[11]<br>  <br>  According to another statement by Sansweet, "Lucasfilm Animation will be hiring a total of about 300 digital artists and others in both California and Singapore locations to produce not only the series, but animated feature films in the years ahead." He said about the series, "to get the series underway, Lucasfilm Animation has hired key production and creative talent to lead the development of its first animation project." Sansweet has said that "a large component of the future of Star Wars and Lucasfilm is CGI animation."<br>  <br>  Lucasfilm Ltd. and Lucasfilm Animation used Autodesk software to animate both the film and the series. The Maya 3D modeling program was used to create the highly detailed worlds, characters and creatures.[12] Animators also reviewed designs from the original 2003 Clone Wars series when creating the animation style for the film and the new series.[13]<br>  <br>  Anthony Daniels, who portrayed C-3PO in all six films as well as the Star Wars Holiday Special, Star Wars: Droids and Star Wars: Clone Wars, confirmed in June 2006 that he had been contracted for the series.[14]<br>  <br>  In a video interview with Rob Coleman from Imagina 2007 divulged that there were 15 episodes in production, one episode was complete, he was going to direct 5 of the first 22 episodes, reaction from licensees was very positive, and that final assembly of shows is done at Skywalker Ranch. this information:[15]<br>  <br>  At Lucas' March 3, 2007 appearance at the 2007 William S. Paley Television Festival,[16] Lucas revealed the series is episodic, and as such will not focus on Anakin Skywalker's story; with episodes dedicated to clone troopers and Kit Fisto. Lucas revealed further information in a fan interview,[4] a new character named Ahsoka Tano, over 100 episodes and a possible appearance by Boba Fett. In an interview in the September 24, 2007 issue of TV Guide, Lucas confirmed that 39 episodes of the series have been completed.[17]<br>  <br>  On April 8, 2007, Ain't It Cool News reported that musician Eric Rigler had recorded music for the series.[18] Rigler disclosed that each planet in the Star Wars galaxy would have its own theme music, based on Bulgarian music and played on Irish pipes.<br>  <br>  Stuart Snyder, who oversees Cartoon Network and other Turner Broadcasting System cable networks, said he became interested in the new Clone Wars series immediately upon starting the job in May 2007.

Then create a new partition 30 gig .<br>  Partition the Hard drive – reasons<br>  ========================<br>  Firstly C drive is compulsory for the Operating System (XP) (Vista), and you install all your programs on C drive.<br>  <br>  D drive is made for YOUR files.<br>  What you do is MOVE my documents to D drive.<br>  <br>  When you download music, videos, pictures from your camera or make any MS Office documents or save emails, you save it on D drive.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is to do with <br>  1. Hard drive failure - usually a failed hard drive will not boot, but can often be seen when hooked up as a slave.<br>  So when you get your new hard drive up and running, you can copy D drive from your old to your new. You haven’t lost anything.<br>  <br>  2. Virus. Normally virus are programmed to infect C drive. If you get a bad virus all that has to be done is format the C drive partition then re install you OS and programs from disks.<br>  You haven’t lost your personal stuff because its on D drive.<br>  <br>  3. Scanning your C drive for virus or spyware. These malware programs live on C drive. It is not necessary to scan D drive. It is a lot quicker to scan a small partition than a large hard drive.<br>  <br>  Now you can see the above is compromised by the fact that programs get updates and lots of programs are installed from the net. Therefore if you had to wipe out C drive it be hard to get it back to how it was.<br>  To remedy this we use Norton Ghost to image C drive and store the Image on D drive.<br>  (Vista requires a version 10 or newer of Ghost).<br>  <br>  If you get a bad virus you just use the Ghost disk to boot up on, then copy the image stored on D drive back over C drive.<br>  It takes less than 30 mins to rebuild C drive.<br>  Also you may have this running on say a 250 gig HDD, and it fails.

iraqmc7qaa	A Dongle is one you plug into the USB port. I think your laptop has wireless inside - that's not called a dongle, it's just a wireless network card. It's cheaper than a dongle...<br>  <br>  If you don't want to use a dongle, then you can easily use a cable. For desktops, it's very easy to get a cheap card and plug it in to the inside of the computer - dongles aren't too cheap. Just work out if you'd rather pay more for wireless, or if you can just run a cable to your router. Either way is good. You could buy one dongle for everyone that needs one, and they take it to whatever machine they'll be using (so for you, just one is fine)<br>  <br>  If you want all the computers connected in a network, then they all need either a dongle, or wireless card, or cable to connect them to the server.

Or a wirless card in laptops today come with an internal card.... but in the case of laptops without you can purcahse a wireless dongle from ￡20 upwards... and donglw will work as long as it supports the security being used (if any) by the router.

jmgCpVkzaa	Hi hanslysg, all batteries have a shelf life and in-use life; can't avoid that.<br>  I second John H. and his recommendation. Definitely store the battery topped up. The battery actually came to you in your brand new laptop with some charge in it. Zeroing out modern NiMh batteries is a risky business and not recommended at all. Throwing it in the fridge (not the freezer!) will help in slowing down the chemical reactions inside the battery. Good Luck1<br>  Pip|`|QPB6e3lVaa	Any battery will self discharge over time and undergo premature battery failure. Batteries stored in a discharged state sometimes are more susceptible to failure, thus a fully charged battery in some cases may last longer and not be as subject to failure. Storing it in a refrigerator (sealed in plastic) also may help. <br>  See <a href="http://www.powerstream.com/Storage.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.powerstream.com/Storage.htm</a> they show the proper way to store all kinds of batteries per the manufacturer's recommendations.

8SN0htNnaa	No! The OS is linked to your current HDD and Motherboard combination. If your computer didn't come with a disk and cd-key there is no way of changing this. <br>  Do you need to install it on the new HDD anyway? It would be much simpler to have the two HDD running together.|`|AA10948208	Get the software called "clone".It will copy everything from the old drive to the new one.|`|pDxFOekIaa	Partition the Hard drive – reasons<br>  ========================<br>  Firstly C drive is compulsory for the Operating System (XP) (Vista), and you install all your programs on C drive.<br>  <br>  D drive is made for YOUR files.<br>  What you do is MOVE my documents to D drive.<br>  <br>  When you download music, videos, pictures from your camera or make any MS Office documents or save emails, you save it on D drive.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is to do with <br>  1. Hard drive failure - usually a failed hard drive will not boot, but can often be seen when hooked up as a slave.<br>  So when you get your new hard drive up and running, you can copy D drive from your old to your new. You haven’t lost anything.<br>  <br>  2. Virus. Normally virus are programmed to infect C drive. If you get a bad virus all that has to be done is format the C drive partition then re install you OS and programs from disks.<br>  You haven’t lost your personal stuff because its on D drive.<br>  <br>  3. Scanning your C drive for virus or spyware. These malware programs live on C drive. It is not necessary to scan D drive. It is a lot quicker to scan a small partition than a large hard drive.<br>  <br>  Now you can see the above is compromised by the fact that programs get updates and lots of programs are installed from the net. Therefore if you had to wipe out C drive it be hard to get it back to how it was.<br>  To remedy this we use Norton Ghost to image C drive and store the Image on D drive.<br>  (Vista requires a version 10 or newer of Ghost).<br>  <br>  If you get a bad virus you just use the Ghost disk to boot up on, then copy the image stored on D drive back over C drive.<br>  It takes less than 30 mins to rebuild C drive.<br>  Also you may have this running on say a 250 gig HDD, and it fails.  You buy a new 400 gig HDD and install both into you computer, the failed one as a slave.<br>  Using the ghost disk to boot up on, you partition the 400 C drive to 30 gig (XP)and the remaining to D drive.  Then you repack C drive from the image.  Then Copy your old D drive files to your new one. In a time of less than 1 hour and it’s all running.

RjwyRrxtaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

4MYWPD9Yaa	Use the Ubuntu CD to reformat the drive as FAT32.<br>  <br>  Vista's installer will then be able to convert it to NTFS so you can install Vista over it.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	If you have 3 Ubuntu options you have totally wrecked the install. This will cause it to run badly. To return to Vista you must boot from the OD cd and at the first option select install, then at the second you must delete ALL the partitions. Then create a new one for the install.|`|JxxZpxqmaa	When you are trying to install Vista, it might be a good idea to repartition the drive.  When the installer comes up with your current partitions, delete them and create one contiguous partition with the max amount of storage you can.  You then should be able to reformat your new partition to NTFS and Vista will install on it.<br>  <br>  Either of the steps above will wipe out all of your data, so be sure to make relevant backups if needed.|`|5zSSGKBpaa	If you installed ubuntu correctly and had a dual boot with vista, then vista will still be there. If during the installation of ubuntu you told it to use the whole disk and did not follow the instructions on how to setup a dual boot then vista is gone.<br>  The first link should help you to get vista back. <br>  You can try to use vista to remove the linux partitions but if vista says that they are unrecognized partitions and cannot remove them you will have to use the ubuntu disk.<br>  Boot with the ubuntu disk and proceed as if you were going to do a ubuntu install. When you get to the partition section tell it to delete all the ubuntu partitions. Be careful not to delete the vista partitions. Then with the unallocated area make one large  partition and make it fat32. When it is done making the fat32 partition cancel out of the ubuntu install.<br>  You should ow have vista back and the ubuntu area will be free space.<br>  Good luck
QPB6e3lVaa	There may not be any more capacity on the CD-RW. Every time you save it, the new version takes up more space on the CD (the old ones cannot be erased, they just no longer can be accessed). If it is an 700MB disk and your file takes up 100MB, you can edit it and save it 6 or 7 times  So, the best way is to save it to a new CD-RW disk or another medium.

It operates at 100 if the wiring tests ok but reverts to 10 automatically if not.<br>  Your Cable service will be nominally a max of 10mbps (in some areas for extra money you can get 20mbps) but usually it operates much lower than that.<br>  Your DSL will be more like 1-5mbps and you will be lucky to get close to that on any given day.<br>  You might find that you can buy better speed if you call your provider.|`|HLiuLaWEaa	Hello!<br>  <br>  First off, the 100 mbps connection is locally, from your computer to your modem / router. It is not your actual speed to the internet. Second off, 50 kbps is about the speed of dial up. Depending on where you live, you could get lower, and in your case it seems that way. There are other options. But you aren't going to get above 56K if you have dial-up. You can get better internet like AT&T DSL, I own it personally and it has never gone down and has download speed up to 6000 Kbps (6 Mbps) That is the same speed of cable (if not faster). And upload speeds of up to 600 Kbps. You can also switch to cable if that option is available. I wouldn't suggest it but, sometimes DSL isn't available, and cable is. Also, there are a lot of DSL companies that you might of never heard of. Don't be afraid to try them out! If you live close to a DSL company and or they say it is available, it probably is!|`|7aHsYbcfaa	First of all, you have to understand there are 2 parts to your connection -- the "Local" connection and the "Internet" connection.  Second, there are MANY other factors that contribute to your download speed.<br>  <br>  Your Local connection is usually 10, 100, or 1000Mbps for a wired connection, or 11Mbps-54Mbps for wireless.  This is the speed your computer can communicate with the router or modem.<br>  <br>  Your Internet connection is what you're paying for from the Internet Service Provider, or ISP.  This is usually 128Kbps - 20Mbps for residential, depending on who you subscribe to.<br>  <br>  As for the download speed, many other factors enter in -- how many people are on that site, the server's speed, the connections between the host server and your computer, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What you should do is run a speed test.  Go to this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest" rel="nofollow">http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest</a><br>  <br>  If your speed is much below what you're paying for, call your ISP and find out what the problem is.|`|sFaLyG0Naa	<a href="http://allforyou.amstrad.at" rel="nofollow">http://allforyou.amstrad.at</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|JERpZebkaa	certifications-<br>  <a href="http://ccsptutorials.com/" rel="nofollow">http://ccsptutorials.com/</a>|`|Vzfr1Cvdaa	It is very simple:<br>  U can use a broadband connection.<br>  There are Data Cards of many Companies giving u a speed upto 2 MBPS.

5pApP11Faa	The modem turns on? I assume you are referring to your tower as the modem? Generally, if the system is having errors posting, then you will hear a series of beeps.. make sure your monitor cable isn't bad or that you are on the correct source on the monitor.. There really isn't an answer to this question b/c is could be so many things.. Best bet is to take it to someone who knows enough about computers to diagnose what is wrong|`|xMqgB2GDaa	Your monitor is using the wrong input selection. It should be VGA or DVI, not RGB...unless you have an unusual setup using those connectors. The problem is with your monitor, not your computer. You may have bumped a button on it. Check your input setting.|`|yqAwWO4uaa	so you are getting power to the devices on the board?  If yes normally when I have this issue, I unplug the power supply from the board OR I jump the CMOS and reset it.  You should be able to find in the manual (online too) the reset jumper setting for your motherboard (CMOS).
SSeWnDPkaa	From experience, if you have the funds, and you are not primarily concerned with extreme gaming (though gaming does occur on Macs) I would suggest getting an apple then a PC that runs windows.  Macs have much better customer service then any leading PC company I have dealt with.  One of the downsides of an Apple is that they are expensive so someone like myself must settle for a PC for now.  As far as Zune or iPod I would imagine Zune will be gone sooner than later so I would say iPod is better.

I think you may have the box 'Sign me in automatically ' ticked on the msn on her machine. untick the box. (this is what others who have answerd this question have suggested - It might not be that though) x    2.If that's not the case, You want to stop msn booting up when she turns her machine on.   search 'config' on your computer   and open up 'msconfig'  click on startup  unclick 'msnmsgr'  and click apply.    3. If either of them dont work then click 'forget me' on the messenger and you will have to type in your email address and password everytime but it will stop it happening.    Hope either of them three help, I would start with the first option though because it might just be as simple as that :)|`|Wg0nXXHwaa	well when the program shows up on your mums computer,  theres 3 options    member me  member password  & sign in automatically  make sure tht box isnt tiked ^  and then youl stop havin tis problem :)|`|pSaUlVa5aa	ok, easy. when you are signed in go to MENU --> TOOLS --> OPTIONS, there click on Sign In and uncheck the box that says something like 'automatically sign in when connected to the internet'.  There are others there that you might want to uncheck, like automatically running live messenger when the computer boots up.  That should take care of it.|`|g7M1DxFCaa	Start MSN on her machine, it'll sign you in.  Sign out, now there's an option to sign back in and some check boxes.  Under the 'Remember me' box there's a link marked 'forget me'.  Use that.  When you sign in with another account you can have the 'remember me' box ticked if you like and it won't keep asking.  This just makes it forget the account details it's currently using.
bnCiNAQdaa	hidserv.dll is used for Human Interface Devices, such as keyboards, mice, etc. that is why the mice wont work.  first try the Windows System File Checker to see if it replaces the missing .dll file. go to Start|Run, enter 'cmd.exe' and then type:      sfc /scannow    search the web for a copy of that .dll file. put it in C:\Windows\system32. then at Start|Run, type "regsvr32 C:\Windows\system32.hidserv.dll" (with no quotes)    if it still fails, some mice have proprietary drivers that you may need to install.  right click on the My Computer icon on your desktop, click 'manage' and look under 'device manger'. (or go to device manger in the control panel) you should see an item with a yellow icon. whichever device/catagory has the icon, look at its properties tab and see what the error message is.

chnP1l27aa	Google AdSense does not issue payments until you've reached $100. However, if you close your account before you ever reach $100 (and the limit you've accumulated at least $10,) Google will issue you a payment.    And no, a fourteen-year-old cannot sign up. You must be eighteen because Google will request tax information for you to receive payment.
AA11459417	I just recently dealt with this company and I can tell you with 100 percent certainty that it's a scam.  Hopefully, you didn't give them your phone number, because if you did, you'll be harassed day and night by their phone calls.  I was one of the lucky ones and found out before I got in too deep that it's a scam.  They contact you and tell you that you have to send money to get a list of potential jobs.  They'll also assign you a mentor who's supposed to help you get started.  But the mentor is actually unavailable whenever you try to contact him/her, and the list of potential jobs they give you is completely bogus.  Like I said, I was lucky that I found out before I sent them any money that it's a scam.  I googled them and found a couple of web sites that were very informative about explaining how they operate.|`|0f53624e253ff98b5745955d48febbc0aa	Looks like a scam. Those pictures beside the testimonials look like stock photos gathered from a library. Don't sign up or become associated with these people. The only picture that looks real is the bottom one, and that's probably a picture of the leader of this scam himself.<br>  <br>  Also, they do not have any contact information except and address which is probably fake. Most importantly, they have no phone number. Plus, their affiliate button doesn't work, meaning they don't have any actual legitimate affiliates. Obvious scam.

RmOKu58Uaa	I had to convince my parents of the same thing; you just need to tell them that there are severe controls on there that you can set. For example, you can set it so that nobody can see anything you do unless they are your friend. Also, you can set it so that your name does not show up when someone searches it (in other words, YOU must be the one to add someone as a friend). And, you could give your parents your password and tell them that they could look at your facebook any time they would like.

AA12351337	Probably not, they (along with Myspace) believe that what Project Playlist was doing was illegal, which I don't think they're really correct.  All Project Playlist did was find music that was already up on the internet for people to listen to and put it on your playlist.  If that site took the song down, it came off your playlist.  You couldn't download it, if you did, then it was illegal.

HWuZd2NMaa	Let me guess:    You have a computer.   You use that computer.  Some other people use that computer.  You and the other(s) user(s) log into the same account when using the computer.  You don't like what the other people do when they use the computer.  You (and probably the other(s))better learn more about computers.    Am I right? I thought so.    Instead of you and the other(s) fighting over Mozilla Firefox (and probably some other programs) on one user account, you can create different user accounts (1 for each different user) and protect them with passwords.    That way, each person can set Mozilla (and the rest of the programs they use) the way they want. No worries. Whatever they do with their accounts won't affect the other users (in most cases).    Extra advice: When having multiple user accounts, it would be a very good idea to have one (or the least amount) of those accounts set up as administrator and the rest as "Limited" accounts. That way, it'll be more difficult to damage Windows (or whichever OS you're using).|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	omsacraS has some really good advice.

Change the resolution of you video driver. by right clicking on the desktop then click properties, then go to the tab at the top that says settings and move the bar at the mid of the page that says screen resolution that you feel comfratable with.  3. using IE if you want to make the writing bigger or smaller on this website, you will need to follow these instructions. Using your mouse, click on view on the toolbar at the top of the screen. From the dropdown list that you can see, move your mouse so that it is over the words Text Size.  4. Assuming you're using Windows XP, you can play around with the "DPI" settings on your computer:  Settings  Control Panel  Display  "Settings" tab  "Advanced" button  "General" Tab  The DPI setting on that dialog will make everything bigger, and might be worth playing around with. "Large Size" is what I recently changed my screen too after I found myself squinting a little too much. The Custom setting will allow to adjust it to even larger sizes.  Another option is to play with the "Appearance" tab on the display settings where you can control specific fonts, but that requires a bit more work as you change each font usage to see which one actually matters.  I've done the DPI change on a couple of installations and it seemed perhaps the most reasonable solution.  Choose the text size you want from the list.

bnCiNAQdaa	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol used by networked devices (clients) to obtain the information necessary for operation in an IP network.   The DHCP server is used to centrally manage multiple network devices. so instead of going into each PC or server and configuring the IP address, netmask, default gateway, etc., the client, if set up to accept DHCP, will get that information automatically.    for home use, most routers can be configured to act as DHCP servers. you set up the router with its IP and network range (192.168.1.1, netmask of 255.255.255.0) and enable the DHCP setting. whenever you attach a PC to your home network, either wired or wireless, the router will assign an IP to that client. so the 1st PC would be 192.168.1.2. if you connect a 2nd PC, it will be 192.168.1.3, and so on.|`|Cfw0OvLwaa	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol that assign  IP address and other IP configuration information to network clients.

See the videos for Learn Your Way Around the Mac at the bottom of the page.<br>  <br>  "Which is better" all depends upon what you want to use it for.  Personally, I have had a Mac for nearly 3 years, and I think I should have bought one a long time ago before that.  Just keep your eye on all the questions that come in to this site at Answers.yahoo.com.  See for yourself how many "Help! I got a virus" and "Help! my computer is running slow!" and "Why won't my Windows start up?" See for yourself how many answers are "Reinstall Windows" and "Reinstall the driver" and "Run this software to clean up your registry..."  I have never had to do any of those things on the Mac.  I can spend all my time actually making my videos and composing music, and writing my scripts and all my daily Internet fun stuff without EVER having to waste time trying to figure out what is wrong with this and that.<br>  <br>  So, after you look at all the questions that come in and all the answers given to fix Windows PC problems, ask yourself, which one would you rather have?|`|jWGzSmypaa	Mac is very stylish, runs averagely well and is very good for creating and editing images and video.<br>  <br>  Pc (Windows Vista or XP) is pretty much, the industry standard.

zorYTX59aa	If your YouTube is getting bombarded with "JavaScript" and <br>  "Flash Player" messages, and people are telling you to get<br>  or install something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.<br>  <br>  You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java", <br>  "Flash" or different web browsers -- and definitely avoid any<br>  software that sales-pimps (disguised as answerers here on <br>  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.<br>  <br>  None of those things will help you, because your computer <br>  and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right? <br>  The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:<br>  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add, <br>  change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.<br>  <br>  I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"<br>  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really<br>  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer<br>  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a <br>  lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why <br>  in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54<br>  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good <br>  for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).<br>  <br>  Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the<br>  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of<br>  their own servers every single day without warning anybody, <br>  in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions, <br>  it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or <br>  "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.<br>  <br>  If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing <br>  you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages, <br>  it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely<br>  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being<br>  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay <br>  there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer <br>  much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of <br>  them. The solution to that is to first exit YouTube, and then <br>  clear your "cache" of all its "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" <br>  and "history". Then reboot.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something<br>  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts <br>  my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on<br>  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever. <br>  (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)<br>  <br>  Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"<br>  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales <br>  pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are <br>  really disguised sales-people and peddlers. Their "answers" <br>  have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may<br>  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer <br>  is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch <br>  or access videos, buy our downloader."<br>  <br>  Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering<br>  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|uSjy3jqbaa	try not using firefox<br>  i find firefox is not the best for about anything especially with vista<br>  safari works well and it wont do things like that to you unless it really is true<br>  <br>  i logged in somewhere one time on firefox and it said "you need to be logged in to view this page"<br>  ...right after i logged in :P<br>  i never use firefox<br>  i think firefox needs updates before i will ever look at it again<br>  stick with things like safari, which even works well for windows :)|`|owxFbRnNaa	javascript is usually turned on by default...so, it might be your flash player is outdated..<br>  <br>  you can try a different browser...<br>  <br>  these will help you...<br>  <br>  1.

8nLuyDmPaa	Either would be a lot better than what you have.<br>  <br>  Things to look at to determine which one would be better for you.<br>  <br>  The HD<br>  Either listed would work.  What is the Speed of the HDs?  It should list something like 10K or 15K.  The faster the spindle speed, the faster the seek time should be.  Also, look at the cache on the Hds.  The more cache the better.<br>  <br>  The RAM<br>  3 GB is just fine if you are running Windows Vista 32 bit.<br>  7 GB will not work with Windows Vista 32 bit, so I am assuming the computer has a 64 bit Windows Vista operating system.  This seems to be a little bit more stable, but drivers are sometimes harder to come by for older peripherals.  7 GB is a ton of RAM, and unless you are doing something other than what you have listed, you will never use all the RAM.|`|Pj2EqQbDaa	No. It is the capacity that they can hold rather than the speed.<br>  Leave the speed alone and get the quad core. <br>  The 7gig ram is the better one because it can handle more application processes at the same time. the speed is time it takes to complete the requests that you do with the program.<br>  <br>  <br>  But at the same time make sure that both of em are compatible with the computer or else you will be in a world of hurt. if they aren't compatible then it wont mattter.|`|R8mm8eHPaa	Quad core will beat a dual core only if you are running many programs simultaneously. Opening multiple sites isnt multitasking but running a game, simultaneously with a download manager, and a photoshop and a browser would be called multitasking.

The hard drive does not matter except in terms of speed. If it is faster, you will obviously see a performance increase as a result of faster read/write speeds. The quad processor can multitask better but is no difference if you are running one application. Same goes for the RAM. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  P.S: How old is your brother?|`|LFJeZH7Saa	Well this is a pretty detailess question (sorry to sound mean). Thing is the quad core should be better when sized up. It has more cache available most likely L3 cache (if I7 or phenom) which will make it run even faster than the dual core. Problem is that the computer with 7 GB of RAM will need a 64 bit operating system or else it wont work well if at all. <br>  <br>  But it all depends on what u r using it for. I would personally go for the quad core, since you could virtual machine like three computers total off of it, but thats me. I have two computer at home, one is an intel core 2 duo with 3 Gb of RAM and the other an AMD pehnome X4 (quad core) with 8 gb of RAM and the quad core definately beets the the dual core, even while running three virtual machines at once :)
VgIBEANxaa	Actually, AMD CPUs do do this, but this is a good thing, not a bad thing.  It does not mean that 64-bit applications require more processing power, it means that what power is required is divided among more cores to speed up your computer.  Also, I do not think it is just 64-bit applications, but any application that is programmed to utilize all the cores in a multi-core processor.  64-bit is a good thing, and programs that utilize all cores is a good thing.|`|XlyLakYAaa	Not true at all.  And in fact, the i7 has 4 cores, not two.<br>  <br>  The i7 is BLAZING fast and is currently the undisputed performace king.|`|LFJeZH7Saa	The core I7 will use as many cores necessary for an application, technically it has five due to hyper threading, now it should only use multiple cores for an application if it has multi thread support.<br>  <br>  The Amd 64 bit archtecture on its proccessors is also a bit different than that of intel so no worries, epecially since a lto of amd 64 use has been buggy due to things like B3 stepping<br>  <br>  THe Core I7 is fine and fast no worries, good investement

Gls9Xs2Baa	It sounds like the power supply to me you can get one from new-egg.com or other on-line computer supply places. It is a little time consuming but easy enough to replace, I recently replaced the one in my computer and HP pavilion A620n. Basically you just need to measure the old power supply and get one the same size so that it fits in the chassis, also check the number of pins for the mother board, you must get one with the same pin count as yours or one with a plug that is reconfigurable. Once you get open the case unplug the power wires from everything and and remove the screws holding it to the case. Then just replace with the new power supply and and plug everything back in. If you have any questions I can help via email.|`|RlPeaD8Qaa	duh its 4 years old??<br>  <br>  get a new comp bud|`|LJaAL3Ccaa	if you havent really cleaned it in 4 years the dust has probably disabled the boards. but this is only a possibility|`|xcKxL7a7aa	Had the same problem with mine, although it was only 1 year old.  Luckily that meant it was still under warranty so it got fixed for free, 1 power supply (and i think the button as well not sure) and 1 motherboard later (Don't ask they just replaced it I guess) now my cd drive wont play. /sigh<br>  <br>  Would probably guess it would be the power supply though, although that's just a guess.<br>  <br>  Edit: Changing the power supply is rather easy if that is the case. Just watch all your wiring.|`|0IavqJmoaa	It may be dieing although that doesn't seem right if its only 4 years old. You should ask dells support center whats wrong with it.|`|68fPlKttaa	the power transformer aka power supply in the tower where the I/O button is near is damaged and you can probably go to a computer store like futureshop or best buy or w/e and buy these for about $125 but i would recommend that you just buy a whole new computer because a whole new one can be as cheap as $500 which is about 1/5 of the price of the power supply and the computer will probably be better than the one you are trying to fix right now

VgIBEANxaa	It is true that higher resolution monitors require more powerful graphics cards to handle displaying the higher resolution, but it is unheard of for the monitor to shut down because of this.  It just puts a higher work load on your computer.  It shouldn't effect the monitor at all.<br>  <br>  If I had a monitor that randomly said "no input found" and went to sleep, the first thing I would do is check the cable and make sure it was securely fastened to the monitor and the computer.  If the cable were to come loose it would do this.  If the cable is perfectly secure and it continues to do this, I would suspect that the monitor is defective.  It might be too late to return it to the store for a refund or replacement since it has been 2 months, but it should still be under warranty.|`|AA11622701	The error message of "No Input" means that the signal between the computer and the monitor has dropped.  It is unlikely that a newer monitor would could this problem because they are designed to run in all the older modes used by your Viewsonic.<br>  <br>  Rather I would suspect a lose connection in the cable.  Check it and the back of the computer to be sure it is tight.<br>  <br>  The second alternative is a bad monitor.  It may be a damaged cable or a short inside.  Test the monitor by trying it on another computer and see if you still have the same trouble.  If you do, return it to Best Buy for a replacement.<br>  <br>  If it works on another computer, then try a different monitor on your computer.  It is possible with the age of the video card that the card itself may be going bad.

eFnUBBxiaa	Social engineering is when a dominant group expands or reproduces its power to control the whole of society by dividing people into groups. This is accomplished by A) confining a group, B) "breeding them out of existence" (eugenics) and/or C) assigning negative stereotypes to them.     Example of A  -Christians confining Jews to the ghetto of Venice starting in the 1500's    Example of B  -Serbian men raping Bosnian women claiming that their genes are so strong that the resulting children will be more Serbian than Bosnian (absurd claim)    Example of C  -Claim by White Southerners in America that Blacks are intellectually inferior (not true) as a means to justify slavery starting during American Colonization.    It can also refer to a more benign force, such as an attempt to create a utopia. The creators select people based on shared beliefs or some physical characteristics or what not and divide themselves off from society at large. They then live by a stricter set of tenets or beliefs believing themselves to be somehow superior to others.|`|UQYurvnYaa	Ever heard of Social Engineering before...?

AA11858293	Normally, you would use the setup disc that came with the printer, but I discovered a way (here on answers someplace) that tells how to do it far more easily.<br>  <br>  First go to your printers folder, and click on the "Add a new printer" button.<br>  This is where we sway from the typical network printer deal. Click on "local printer attached to this computer", just make sure to uncheck the "automatically detect plug and play printers attached to this computer" box.

lJZ6D9dTaa	If you dont want to run a cable and you want to use a wireless adapter you can only do the following:<br>  <br>  1) Buy a wireless game adapter (that will receive the wireless signal and connect o your xbox via ethernet cable)<br>  <br>  2) If you have the xbox360 purchase the wireless adapter.<br>  <br>  These are your only wireless opions. The wireless adapter you have can NOT work on the xbox360 because there arent any drivers that support your xbox360.|`|cLUwf3rraa	Sorry, those are your two only options.

While this is handy, you can really only have two items plugged into it: USB and ethernet (assuming you have a standard modem). At this point, you are faced with an important decision, and as far as your situation is concerned, there are only three things you can do:<br>  <br>  1. Acquire a wireless router (and an ethernet bridge for the xBox)<br>  With a wireless router, you can use your xBox to access your network and music collection wirelessly (if you share the folders on your computer).<br>  <br>  2. Move your modem.<br>  I don't know if you have anything plugged into the modem (I assume you most likely do), but if it can be moved to a different cable/phone plug closer to your xBox, try moving it. But that can create the problem of plugging in your computer.<br>  <br>  and if you are adventurous, 3. Get a switch and wire your house for ethernet.<br>  Basically, a switch is a way to have more ethernet plugs without getting a router. This is the cheapest network solution, but it involves wiring your home for ethernet. I am not educated on drilling holes in walls and stringing long ethernet cables through, so this guy on indestructables will show you how:<br>  <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/How_to_Wire_Your_House_With_Cat_5_or_6_For_Ether/" rel="nofollow">http://www.instructables.com/id/How_to_W...</a><br>  <br>  ________________________ (end of suggestions)<br>  <br>  Whichever option you choose, just do some background research on each. Remember, your xBox if unmodified can do nothing outside of xBox live if left unmodified. If you decide you want to browse the internet, you will need a modification chip or a soft mod. After running either, use the xBox media center and some high definition component cables (if you have a high definition television, and if you don't, its not a good idea to do internet on a standard definition television set because it hurts your eyes on that 480i screen) to use the internet, homebrew, network music, videos, radio, anything!

VgIBEANxaa	They stopped making computers with AGP slots and AGP graphics cards years ago.  Since you bought your PC in 2007, it will have a PCIx16 slot (it's the longest one when you open up your case.)  Just make sure the graphics card you buy is a PCIx16 graphics card, which shouldn't be a problem since just about all graphics cards on the market use this interface now, except some very low end ones that just use PCI.  You may also notice that some cards they are PCIx16 2.0 while some others just say PCIx16.  Don't worry about this.  It's all backwards compatible anyway and PCIx16 2.0 isn't that much of an improvement.  Unless you buy a really high end card, your power supply can probably handle it.  Look under the card's specifications for power requirements.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Don't listen to people that say you will screw up the motherboard or that your computer will not know how much power to use.  You computers BIOS will adjust this automatically.  And yes, drivers are important, but all the graphics cards out there come with appropriate drivers.  It is not an issue.|`|Pj2EqQbDaa	Phuck NO!<br>  <br>  If you just pick any card, then you might as well throw away the laptop/desktop. The motherboard will screw up because it wont know the right electricity to run through the card. the drivers don't matter. The computer will tell you to replace the video cards or it will go into the horizontal (8)reboot cycle. <br>  <br>  I swear to you not to do that.|`|ChBK5Lv9aa	Well, not exactly. Your mobo most likely only has a pci-e x16 1.0, not 2.0. While most cards will not be affected, high end cards like the GTX 200 series, or the 9800GX2. But, for regular cards, like the 9800GT or GTX, you will see no problems. I would recommend getting an 8800GTX since they are pretty cheap right now, and they are pci-e x16 1.0, so you will be getting max speed anyway. Just make sure your PSU is good enough for it.|`|Gls9Xs2Baa	If your upgrading to a graphics card you need to know what type of card your motherboard  supports (AGP, PCI) and the type of connection your monitor supports (digital, or analog) and the resolutions that that your monitor supports should be supported by the card. For example I have a 19" wide screen monitor and it's native resolution is 1440X900. Everything looks best in the native resolution, too high of a resolution and text is too small to read and too low means everything won't fit on the screen. Hope this helps, any questions you can contact me here.|`|vo42ZRPdaa	are you wanting to use it for games? tv? just emails? <br>  the best cards are Nvidea depending on your pc  (not dell nor hp/compaq)<br>  your power supply might need to be beefed up if your board supports the newer better PCI EX x16  you should consider 8800 GTX orGX2, a 260 or 280 or 295<br>  these will range in price from 300-750 CND if you bought a good after market board you may be able to go SLI and really enjoy your gaming / movie watching experience...|`|YESUhp8gaa	as long as it has a driver for the operating system, which should not be a problem for windows XP or Vista OS. <br>  <br>  Using one for a Linux one you will need to check to see if a graphic card driver was made, and with mac you are out of luck.

What you need to be aware of is if you have that monitor activated or not.<br>  <br>  When you mouse over the second monitor it should say “Not Active” and should appear grayed out. If this isn’t the case, right click and de-select the  “attached” option.<br>  <br>  Not doing this could make your mouse seem to disappear or some windows to open on the “other” monitor – not awesome.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  Ron<br>  Windows Outreach Team|`|AA11622701	Because you have a laptop, the PC includes two different video ports.  One is the cable that runs the build in screen.  The other is the port to which you attach the external monitor.  Because there are two physical ports on the laptop, Windows is ALWAYS go to see that there are two monitors.  (All it can see is the "ports", it can not tell if anything is attached.)<br>  <br>  There is no way to stop Windows from seeing two montiors because there really are two "monitors" on the laptop.  The only thing you can do is to make the laptop screen the "primary" and then NOT extend it to the second screen.  There will still be a signal going to the external monitor port, but since it is identical to what is displayed on the build in screen, it uses no more video memory nor slows the computer in any way.

If you're downloading using torrents or slimewire and you're not using anti-virus, you might as well go to the cheapest red light district without condoms and go on a sampling binge. Free anti-virus are Avast!, AVG, and Clam. Kaspersky, Trend Micro, and of course Norton are all very good too (Norton's gotten alot better recently, seriously)<br>  <br>  After updating your virus definitions and doing a FULL scan of your compy, it's time to troubleshoot. First, open Windows Explorer. If it won't work, click Start, Run, CMD, then type Explorer. Now if THAT still won't open the program (or opens IE instead), you'll need more help than I can walk you through. (if you have a GeekSquad tech look at it, make sure they're "CompTIA A+ Certified").<br>  <br>  If Windows Explorer does open (not IE, just Computer, Documents, C: drive, that sort of thing), then click on Organize, then Folder and Search Options. Look for something called File Types. Double click on each item on the list that corresponds with something you're no longer able to open (say JPG or JPEG for pictures, DOC for Word documents, AVI for videos). You can change the setting for what program to use here. Now if it says the right one (for example, WIndows Picture and Fax Viewer for JPG/JPEG, Microsoft Word for DOC) then it's a registry problem. DO NOT mess with the registry if you don't know what you're doing! There IS NO UNDO in the registry, and you could ruin your computer. Have someone who understands PC's look at it instead.|`|tj6Wx6s8aa	On your start menu, there should be an item called Default Programs or something.

Always make sure you update your definitions though. <br>  <br>  Have you looked at your power settings yet? Open Control Panel. If you don't see Power listed there, click on Printers and Other Hardware then look on the left.<br>  <br>  This should open Power Options Properties. where it says Power Schemes, change it to Always On or Presentation. Now look down where it says System Standby and possibly System Hibernates. Both should now say Never. If they don't, you can change them by clicking on them. Then simply click OK. <br>  <br>  If your computer gives you a warning about insufficient rights, you're probably using  a non-administrator logon account. You'll need someone who does have an admin account to change your account to administrator temporarily just so you can change this power setting. <br>  <br>  If your computer gives you an error about how it's running some other program that manages power and not to mess with these settings, then just cancel all of that and look for an icon in your system tray (the area around the clock in the lower right corner) that looks like a plug, a battery, or a lightbulb, right click it, and see if there's anything it says about power configuration (that doesn't lead back to where you just were).<br>  <br>  <br>  AMENDMENT:<br>  Now, if the computer is shutting down WHILE you're typing and clicking and doing things, then maybe the others are right and it's a power supply issue. Vaccum the dust from everywhere. If it still happens, you may need a new power supply. <br>  <br>  ALSO look at the capacitors on your motherboard (the little cylinders all around the biggest set of metal fins). If any of them are bulging like an old Jiffy Pop tin, your motherboard is dead.

OWgRw3SYaa	Not sure what you're trying to do here, so this may not apply, but generally speaking, whenever there's code that does a SELECT MAX()...and increments it programatically, there's a race condition built in there that becomes a problem as soon as the script starts being used in the real world.

If it's not a numeric data type that could be the problem.      FYI: that may have done the trick but his correction to your SQL was entierly unneccessary, and much less efficent, there's no reason to pull all the data in the table with the *.    Your issue must have been how you were trying to return the variable from the sql results.|`|3nXO9cM8aa	Because your syntax is incorrect. :P  Try:    $result = mysql_query("SELECT *, MAX(myfield) FROM stats");   while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) {  echo "$row['MAX(myfield)'];  }    There is no need for many combinations. None will work except the correct one. If your fields are numbers (int, longint etc) the name must not be included by ' '. If the fields are text types (char, varchar, longtext etc etc) you have to inclure your variables inside ' '.    Edit to additional details: I can't understand clearly what you want.

If you're looking to make it better here are some suggestions    1. either extend the gradient on the top and bottom to the whole background or do something else with the background.    2. Move the nav menu further to the left so the pic and the products can be centered on the LIDS and SHades logo.    3. Like the other guy said, make the background on the lids and shades logo match the background of the page.    4. If you want to get really Fancy do something other then tables for browsing the products, maybe look on google for some java script for a scrolling slide show or something.    5. If it's a business class you might want to work on a bit more the "sales pitch" on the site, write a bit more about your products.|`|Xg8Tzjfraa	Since you've obviously just used a premade template, I would suggest spending a LOT of time within the code to change things and make it your own.

Right now, you can tell it stands out too much. Perhaps save it as a transparent gif so you can get the colors to see through.     I like how it's black. Gives it a modern look to it. I wouldn't add any color to it, rather go with other shades of gray.    If you can get any other B&W photos of young people wearin shades, put that in the left side area where the navigation is. Maybe even blend the photos with the navigation. Good luck with your competition.

It is also good because if you plan on sending out more than one of these emails, it will automate the mailing so that you can avoid spam detection rejecting it (it also has a spam detector on it, letting you know anything in your email that may trigger spam filters to reject your email).

Otherwise, you'll have to open your case and see what sort of connectors you have inside. MOST LIKELY, there will be a wide grey ribbon about 40 wires wide connecting to the back of your CD drive. This is an ATA or IDE ribbon. (ATA and IDE mean the same thing, but you may see one or the other, so know both.) If you see a very thin cord connecting to it (usually but not always black), then that's SATA.    Buy an internal DVD drive with the appropriate connection type, install it where the CD drive was and use the same connectors and all should be well... but be sure to follow the directions that come with the drive.

There are lots of free antivirus applications, but I've never seen them directly compared. So I did the hard work for you, installing them each in turn on a test machine with about 16GB of data on it and running a full scan of each (including any options to scan inside compressed files). For each application I ran a complete or scan of the hard drive in the application's most thorough, high-priority mode. Otherwise, all default settings were left unchanged.    Below you'll find my notes about the interface, the software in general, and the time it took to run the system scan (plus how many files it actually scoured). While I can't provide much data on how effective these applications are at actually catching real viruses since I don't have a library of viruses to test, I have noted the virus.gr detection rating for each app, which is a good barometer for this. (I've covered these ratings before.) Finally, I've ranked them from my most favorite to least favorite app below. (Note that I'm only covering antivirus software here, not anti-spyware software like Ad-Aware or Spybot.)    AOL Active Virus Shield - TOP PICK! - virus.gr detection rating: 99.62%; total running time: 31 min, 16 sec; total files scanned: 224,565    The bad news: The software requires an email activation code (which means registering online, and which takes a long time to arrive). I also can't blame anyone for not entirely trusting anything with the AOL logo, but Kaspersky (see full review) actually provides the tech behind the antivirus software here, not AOL itself. It also installs an AOL search toolbar in your browser, ugh. The good news: The software is well designed and very easy to use. A progress bar appears during scans, along with estimated time of completion. Everything here looks on the up and up, and the virus.gr detection rating is exemplary. I'm a little perplexed about the missing 70,000 files that Active Virus Shield didn't scan that the other scanners did. (However this isn't necessarily a sign of bad security, as those files may have been identified as not prone to viruses, or Active Virus Shield may count "files" differently.)    Avast! 4.7 Home Edition - virus.gr detection rating: 87.46%; total running time: 49 min, 7 sec; total files scanned: 292,713    I'm not a huge fan of the Avast! Interface, which looks like a MP3 player and features such odd design choices as a "scan thoroughness" slider that looks like a volume control. How do you know how "thorough" this scan really is? Is 4 out of 6 thorough enough? During a scan there's no progress bar, so you never know if you have 3 or 30 minutes remaining. (Plus it's dog slow.) That sub-90% virus.gr rating is not exactly comforting, either. The software comes with a 60 day trial, after which you must register (for free, requires email address). Overall it's just too hard to navigate, which makes it too easy to misconfigure, but it works well enough. (Second opinion: PC World ranked Avast! last among virus scanners it tested in performance at catching real viruses, a fact which the virus.gr rating bears out.)    Avira AntiVir PersonalEdition Classic - virus.gr detection rating: 94.26%; total running time: 14 min, 23 sec; total files scanned: 182,215    AntiVir is relatively popular and you can see why: It's blazing fast, even though it seems to be less than thorough at scanning all the files on the drive. But Avira has at least one terrible feature: Annoying full-screen pop-ups at random intervals advertising Avira's paid software apps. Configuration is about average, and advanced options are available if you dig for them. Overall detection rates look good, making AntiVir a good third choice if the two above don't work for you.    The apps below are not recommended...    BitDefender 8 Free Edition - virus.gr detection rating: 95.57%; total running time: 26 min, 52 sec; total files scanned: 301,157    This is only an on-demand scanner and doesn't offer "real time" protection, which all four of the other scanners in this roundup offer. A decent interface and comprehensive virus.gr rating (not to mention it scanned more files than anything else I tested) don't make up for that unacceptable drawback. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who needs any level of regular virus protection, even though it's very fast and thorough.    Grisoft AVG Free 7.5 - virus.gr detection rating: 82.82%; total running time: 13 min, 8 sec; total files scanned: 56,391    AVG has a tricky interface, with minimal configurability (for example, you can't specify whether or not AVG should scan within compressed files, and there's no indication of whether or not this happens by default) and no progress bar during scanning. With such a low virus.gr rating I'm not sure I'd trust it as my only line of virus defense. After it finished its scan in only 13 minutes, having scanned a whopping 20% of the files actually on the disk, I was ready to send this one back. (AVG is so popular that I went loo|`|DpMnmrK8aa	Spybot detects all hidden viruses, malware, spyware, adware etc (anything that can be harmful at pc) it doesn't affect any other working programmes and gets rid of all them hidden annoyances that you didnt relise was there.

In order to successfully remove malware infections (viruses, spyware, adware etc) from your PC you need to follow a methodical approach as well as using effective (and free) tools.  Theres a decent guide covering this that you can work through at My Slow PC (http://www.MySlowPC.co.uk/)  click on the Troubleshooting link.  Heres my advice from it:    1.) Turn System Restore OFF so any infection that you remove is not restored.    2.) Scan with a combination of the best detection utilities as youll find different scanners can sometimes pick up different infections.  E.g.       * McAfee Stinger  a free stand-alone utility used to detect and remove specific viruses.     * SpyBot Search & Destroy  a spyware/adware scanner     * Lavasoft Adaware  for spyware/adware    Note  it might be a good idea to disconnect your network connection once youve updated them with the latest virus/spyware definitions.  This is due to the fact that often an infection is trying to spread over your network.    3.) If the above fails or youre not sure if youre still infected, when you start your PC tap the F8 key, select Safe Mode and repeat the scans once youre connected.    I hope the above helps, as mentioned the guide above is a lot more detailed and the My Slow PC site is pretty useful.  Good luck!|`|BQS2bVjOaa	Check out: http://www.pcthreat.com.
