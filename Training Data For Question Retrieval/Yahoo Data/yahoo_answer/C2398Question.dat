And I will make thee beds of roses,   And a thousand fragrant posies,   A cap of flowers and a kirtle   Embroider'd all with leaves of myrtle:      A gown made of the finest wool,   Which from our pretty lambs we pull;   Fair lined slippers for the cold,   With buckles of the purest gold:      A belt of straw and ivy buds,   With coral clasps and amber studs;   And if these pleasures may thee move,   Come live with me and be my love.

20090131185859AArJkCL	Education & Reference;Homework Help	What do you think of my persuasive essay?	I believe that the Safe Haven Law is a great law that protects unwanted kids from becoming street kids, and I think that we shouldn't change it to limit infants only. all children deserve to be safe. There are going to be bad consequences if we don't do anything about the abandoned older kids, and the Safe Haven Law, including kids of all ages should be used in other states too.            Why does it matter if the child is one day old, or twelve years old? They are both kids in need of help. One out of eight kids each year are abandoned by their parents. Who can they turn to? The Safe Haven Law changes that. It provides an unwanted child a safe place to stay. there are apparently problems for the older kids as well as the younger kids and they should have the same options for assistance.                 We have two options, "we could provide a safe haven for unwanted kids and pay the associated costs of realistically accept the consequences if you don't; higher crime and other social ills," says an anonymous source. Others think differently. "Nebraska charges us with high taxes, don't you think that it should go for something good instead of making the rich richer?" comments Pam. Pam is right. Helping abandoned kids is not a waste. It's good investment. All kids, homeless or not, teens or babies, are the future of America and we should help them all.          The Safe Haven Law in Nebraska, which includes kids of all ages, should be approved in all of the states. Who knows how many mothers are so desperate to abandon their kids that they end up killing them? Take for example, Casey Anthony, a mother who was charged guilty of murdering her own daughter. What if the Safe Haven Law in her state had included kids of all ages? Instead of murdering Calee, Ms. Anthony could've dropped her off at a hospital and a life would have been saved. We can't change the past, but we can change the future.               in conclusion, the Safe Haven Law is just right the way it is and it doesn't need to be changed. every child deserves to be safe. Bad consequences will occur if we don't do anything to protect the older abandoned kids. By approving the Safe haven Law that includes kids of all ages, we can save lives. After all, isn't that why the Safe Haven Law was invented?          ( i got a 16/20 for this paper) :-)

Biology, Grade 12       2. Chemistry, Grade 12       3. Physics, Grade 12       4. Advanced Functions, Grade 12 (Math)      **and if possible, which one is the hardest and why? Thanks.

I've also heard that Physics is complicated, and very difficult to understand and that you will fail if you don't understand the Grade 11 physics and moving to the Grade 12 physics in the next semester.

I am 19 years old and I am 6 months pregnant, my daughter is due May 16th. So right now attending college on campus isn't possible. But I want to start asap. I was wondering would it be a good idea to go ahead and try to do my general ed classes through online courses, while I am still pregnant and for a few months or so after my daughter is born? I know I don't want to practice Veterinary Medicine over the internet, as I know I would never take any of my animals to see a Vet that only has an online degree. So, basically I was just wondering if anyone has done something similiar or has knowledge on this. Also, I live in West Virginia at the moment and I'm thinking of attending Lord Fairfax Community College (In Virginia). I have contacted them, but I am still waiting on a response regarding this concern. So any opinions would be most appreciated.

Even after an email stating I would get back to him on my own time he still calls & talks to me like a child using his position at the chamber to try & pressure a sale (like I get the feeling he's trying to say that if I dont buy a membership that he'll spread a negative vibe about my business within). The same with the BBB. They called me out of nowhere & said they had an invitation only offer for me to become a preferred business based on the # of people researching my business. After making it seem like I had done something spectacular & earned a coveted spot they break in with the cost ($500 a year) to accept this invite.

Hi I have a project to do, and I am supposed to ask people questions of what they think about child labor in india. So I have made a few questions that you can answer to help present my presentation. Please help thanks :)      what do you think child labor means?      Do you think child labor is appropriate? Why or why not?      Do you think that it’s okay for child laborers to work if their parents can’t afford to feed or clothe them?      What do you think are the causes of child labor?      How do you think society will be affected when the millions of children who were child laborers become adults and, suddenly, countries are faced with an adult population that is uneducated and possibly crippled from work-related accidents?      Do you think that there is any one solution to child labor or do you think there are several things that we have to do?      What do you think we can do to help end exploitative child labor?

I'm a sophomore in high school and am looking for an alternative to traditional schooling to get an education.      I went to a traditional high school, didn't succeed, then transferred to an alternative high school that I loved, but I didn't succeed there either.      Now I'm enrolled in an "internet high-school" where I thought I would excel in, but am becoming increasingly weary and upset with the way it works and the low-standards of material.      I've thought about getting my GED and attending community college, dropping out and seeking "real world" education (which I don't really plan on doing), and all kinds of hair-brained schemes to get education while still maintaining relative sanity.      What should I do? What CAN I do? Please help if you have any opinion, I promise it won't be overlooked.

20090131180523AARKZGd	Education & Reference;Teaching	Should the Holocaust be taught to all students at Secondary School?	I'm doing a research project on Holocaust Denial/whether or not it should be taught to all students at a Secondary School level, but I'm kind of having trouble getting all my thoughts together in my head.      It's a complicated project - I mean, it's basically two topics in one - and I'm not sure what direction I should go in at the moment.      So I thought getting some people's views on it would be a good place to start.      So, do you think it should be taught to all students at Secondary School? Or younger? Or do you think it's too heavy a subject? Do you think it should be studied in detail, or just touched upon?   Why do you think it's important, or why do you think it's wrong to teach it?      You catch my drift. :)      Oh, and for anyone who doesn't know - Secondary School is ages 11-16. :)

I tried to do that but my school say all the regular classes are "full."     So my counselor says I have to stick it out in AP for one semester...    If I can get through this class then I will graduate, and move to New York for college. However I'm feeling lazier than ever and I got a C in REGULAR American governemnt! This is going to be even harder AND it's in the last semester of senior year.     I already failed one test and didn't do 2 homework assignments because I figured I would be transfering.

20090131172726AA6FiOI	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Filing Late for FAFSA?	This is kinda complicated. I am 21 years old and in college.

I am getting married July 11th, and the FAFSA website says that if you are married "as of the day you file" you qualify as independent. Now, although my school's deadline for FAFSAs is March 2, I read that you can still submit it even until August, you just will get all loans and no grants or work study. So, here's the question. If I file my FAFSA after July 11th, when I am married, can I file as an independent student and use my own tax information, rather than my parents? Thanks!

20090131195102AAbhxdL	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Anyone in school: What sort of small things could students use to stay organized?	My sister has to have hand-outs for a speech she is doing, which is about "The Benefits of Keeping Organized" (She didn't know she had to bring hand-outs, or she would have picked a better topic, haha).      It just has to be a little something that would enhance the meaning of her speech, and preferably something that the students could use.      I was thinking maybe mini-notebooks, but the kids already get planners, and I don't want to give them something they can't use.      Any ideas? Any suggestions from students (or anyone) are greatly appreciated.      She is in high school, and there are 37 students in her class (so maybe something not too expensive).       Thanks!

20090131172209AAoGepa	Education & Reference;Other - Education	How do I get my parents let me transfer?	okay so I'm 15 and I've been asking my parents to let me transfer to another school because this year one of my ex friends told all my other friends that I told her parents that she was drinking a lot and that was how she got caught for it, which I didn't. Now only 2 of my friends still believe me and the others have shunned me. So since I'm turning 16 before next year starts and I'll be able to get my drivers license and drive to school I asked my parents if I could transfer so that I could have a new start for my Junior year and have friends again because having only 2 really sucks. They said no because they say I'm running away from my problems and I'm fine with that, pretty much anything is better then this. How can I convince them to let me transfer? I've gone over my other options like Running Start but I'm not smart enough for that, I'm not dumb I'm in all honors but I tried AP and it was to much. My other plan is to drop out, get my GED, get a job, move out, go to community college for nursing, and then continue on with my life. I've tried getting other friends but my school is so clickish and no one wants to be friends with the girl who tells their parents what they do. If I transfer and this happens again then I'll just deal with it but since I have another option I want to use it. This has been going on since near the beggining of school, it's not going to end. So what do I do?

20090131194529AAVcOKg	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Can I get into these schools?	I am ranked 7th in my class of about 350 people. I am taking the most honors courses in my grade, and my GPA is about a 3.5 (I know, not the most ideal GPA). I have yet to take the SATs because I am only in 10th grade, though I plan on doing very, very well. I am really involved with the violin. I have made all-state two years in a row (I am a sophomore), and I am involved in several different ensembles and orchestras. I plan on using music as a scholarship-booster, and I am most likely going to double major. I am working on finding an internship involving biochemisty, as well as becoming more involved in school and community service. I am on all of the usual school clubs (math team, key club, Tri-M, most likely NHS, etc.), and I do a lot of volunteer work at my church, however, I know competitive schools look for something unique, and I hope that my music will shine through, I think it is the thing that makes me unique and different than all of the other applicants.      I want to major in genetics or biochemistry, and I have looked into these schools:      George Washington University, New York University, Boston University, Oberlin, Villanova, and Northeastern.      Please let me know what my chances are and any other advice you may have. Thanks!

First of all,I think that U.S has one of the best education systems in the world so I want to go to the U.S to pursue my education and luckily my uncle promises to let me stay with him once I get there.The major I have in mind is psychology and I hope I could make a living out of it.   Here's my plan:   Phase 1:   First,I will attend to a community college to get an associate degree then transfer to a 4 year college to get a bachelor degree   Phase 2:   Get a master degree    Phase 3:   Get a doctorate degree      1)How much each degree will cost me (tuition,books...) if i live with my uncle? What is total cost and time ?    2)Should I go straight to a 4 year college or should I go to a community college first ? Will studying at community college first make it easier and cost less when I transfer to 4 year college for a bachelor degree ? Same thing for the master and doctorate,which one is easier to get first ? Any suggestions to help me reduce the cost ?    3)After completing my education,can I stay and work in U.S ?
