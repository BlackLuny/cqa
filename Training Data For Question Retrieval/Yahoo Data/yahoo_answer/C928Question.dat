20090309175822AAYVvM0	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	What do I do if I can't afford to pay car payment?	I bought a new car about two years ago. I had a great job then and could afford the $400 car payment. In October I started nursing school full time. Now I can only work weekends and because of this I only make a little over $400 a month. I can not afford to pay what they want. I can only pay half at a time. Currently, I am 2 months behind and have no money to catch up. My credit is not good enough to refinance so I have no idea what to do. I thought about selling but my credit will not qualify me for  aloan to finish paying the car off. I owe about $14000 *I had a high interest rate* and the car will only seel for around $9000. I am under the understanding that I can not sell the car without having the money to pay off the original loan because I can't hand the title over if I owe money. Is this correct. If anyone knows what I could do I would greatly appreciate the advice. I am willing to do just about anything. I wnat to finish paying off the car without them taking it back because its the right thing to do. But I am not sure how I can manage this. I can not work more as I go toschool mon-fri from 7-5. I work 12 hours shifts on the weekends. Any advice as I said is appreciated.!
20090309180115AAEQqcC	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	A question about mortgage and foreclosure?	I'm only thirteen so i understand if you don't have enough info. I am currently staying with my dad while my mom is in the hospital. My parents are getting divorced, and my mom lost her job in october. They have been separated for 6 yrs, and the house i lived in with my mom and sister is owned by my dad. So, he is having a hard time making payments. He is like 2 or 3 months behind. But, when he tried to make a payment, they wouldn't let him. i think he might sell the house (if my mom can't afford it) and his apartment and move to a smaller one one in the same neighborhood so i can go to school there. why wouldn't they let my dad make a payment?

A battle was brewing of epic per portions ,you see a income tax return check was on the horizon and  the battle lines where clearly being drawn........... ( our favorite time of the year)      On one side is the wife ... for her, this has always been like a second Christmas and she  was looking forward to stimulating the economy , As for myself I feel we should take advantage of the lower prices and invest !          After some mild bickering the wife suggested we divide the check so that each of us would be satisfied..I felt this was totally ridicules and knew it would never work.      I instead suggested we go out back  and settle this with my 19th century dueling pistols , winner take all................... ( I had been drinking )      The wife agreed but complained that she had never fired a pistol before .....Being a good sport I decided to teach her how to duel.        Soon we found our self's standing in the field next to "Rusty " the family scare crow.   I pinned a heart on the effigy to indicate where she would be aiming ..she walked over and placed  a carrot in Rusty's trousers and giggled..............stop messing around I scolded ......this is serious!   she only smiled and faced away from rusty with her pistol pointing straight up in the air.      I told her to take ten paces .......turn and fire ...aim straight for the heart . I stood to the side  then proceeded to count out aloud .ONE.......TWO ..........THREE ...........BLAM! ........a  shot rang out spliting the carrot in two !      "well,   he's not the man his father was that's for sure " she teased !       As I watched her investigate the now mutilated carrot............. I can only wonder which is more concerning ......her poor marksmanship or the fact the daft girlie can't count to ten ?      what would you do with your return?

20090309183950AAT6Izh	Business & Finance;Investing	How much did you make off your timber sale per acre?	I'm doing some basic figuring on a development project that will be payed for with the sale of the timber on the land itself. I'm looking for a basic profit per acre to figure off of.       Now, I've been reading about this long enough to understand that I'm asking "how long is a line". I know that this will be very general and will vary greatly from acre to acre. I'm just looking for averages here, not exacts. I know how to estimate it by the book (getting around $650/acre) , but I know a couple of people that have sold their timber and the numbers just don't add up (They made around $2,000/acre) . This is quite a difference, and I'm sure it's because of the difference in dbh and density.       Which leads me here, for the only way to get around this is to actually ask people who have sold "average" timber what they made per acre. I hope you guys can help, because all I can find elsewhere is the old saying "no acre is the same".  It gets old after three months.      A price per acre (or your total profit if you wish), the year you sold, where you are (southeast, northwest, etc) and the general size of your sale will be greatly appreciated and very relevant. My lot, which has not been found yet, will be 30 acres of natural woodland (no managment at all) in the southeast (mostly pines), mostly pulpwood.      I really appreciate your help, and I hope that you can just get me close so I can have a few numbers to work with. If enough people post, then the averages should be  pretty decent. This information just isn't avaliable through web searches, and I'm hoping that your anwsers will help me as well as many future timber investors decide if it's worth it.

Blah blah, my question to is simply, where in (Fort Lauderdale) Florida, can I get a *noted* degree in programming / graphics design / etc?      I've been looking into ITT Tech, DeVry, etc... but I've heard some bad stories (i.e., their degrees are bogus, laughed at, not considered real, etc). There's no way I'm paying all that tuition for a bologna degree in programming.      So where can I go to get a degree in what I want?      Are those stories about those colleges true?      I'm thinking of going to BCC (Broward Community College), try to get really top-notch grades, then move on to a real university (FSU, UCF, FAU, etc).       I've just been really worried lately that my ignorance in 9th-11th grade really messed me up for my future, and I hope that's not true.       ---      Side note: I've yet to take my SATs yet, is there any kind of time limit I have on taking them?

I started working last year and have been dumping all my savings into an ING savings account leaving another amount of money in my checking account for my everyday expenses, e.g., rent, bills, groceries. I also contribute to my employer's 401k and am taking advantage of the company matching.  Right now, the money in my savings account is getting bigger so I'm thinking I should do something with it however, I know absolutely nothing about finance or investing. What is something I can do with my money? I was once told I could look into a 6 or 9 month CD as an option but just looking at the current rates, they don't appear to be higher than my savings account. Also, I'd prefer to leave some of it readily accessibly for emergency. Any suggestions?

I submitted a large business ad for publication in our local newspaper, formatted exactly as I wanted it, and when it appeared in the paper much of the content had been removed, including the all important address of where the event being advertised was held. The size and price of the ad was discussed and agreed upon when the ad was submitted, and no change in size had occurred when the ad ran. They simply removed most of the copy and charged me the same price. I did get them to agree not to charge me for the ad, but the fact still remains that the financial cost of preparing for the event that no one managed to locate without an address, still cost me. Do I have any other recourse? Are newspapers allowed to do this?

My fiance and I have been together now for 7 years and plan to get married in November of this year.  He did not work through college, while I worked at a part time job during my education.  We have both been job hunting since December when we graduated college. I have had numerous job interviews and started a new job today.  He, on the other hand, has not had any interviews or even any response to anything that he has sent out.  He's been trying extremely hard and has even signed up with an employment agency.  He did receive a call for an interview through their company, but on the way to the interview the company called and told him that the position had been filled that morning.     He's getting very depressed because he wants to be able to provide for me and help pay for the wedding.  It's now to the point that we are having to discuss moving the wedding date (which we really don't want to happen because we're planning to get married on our 8 year anniversary).He's just not having any luck with anything that he is doing and I'm afraid that my success is bringing him down even more.  Does anyone have any advice on how I can console him in this time and maybe how I can help him in his job search?

I submitted a resume for a position that interested me. Plus, the salary was excellent, the location was great, and the company initiatives and culture seemed to fit with me. After 1.5 weeks, I called them to check on the status. The contact name on the posting answered, and the call turned into a 30-minute conversation about my current position, what knowledge I have, and more info about the position posted. Turns out, he was not part of HR, but part of the actual dept.      The guy told me that after talking with me I have impressed him, and he also told me that my resume was impressive (he used this i-word about 4-5 times), and he would be in contact with me the following week.  It's Friday of that "following week" and I've yet to get a call.  He told me that he was "desperate for sets of hands, [they] have so much work to do."  which entails me to believe that they just never got around to it.  He also apologized for "not calling earlier" when I called the 1st time.  Now what do I do?

Question 1    A man aged exactly 30 joins a pension scheme which provides a retirement    benefit of 10 times his annualised salary at the normal retirement age, 55. Thus,    if his annualised salary at the retirement date is Kes 1 million, the retirement    benefit payable is Kes 10 million.    His salary is paid continuously and increases continuously at the rate of 8% p.a.    To fund for the retirement benefit, a constant percentage of his salary is    deducted continuously from his salary and invested immediately in a fund to earn    a rate of 10% p.a. What constant rate of deduction (contribution) is required to    fund the retirement benefit?    You may assume that the man remains in employment until exact age 55 and    that interest is earned continuously.    What amount of money should be held in respect of the manâ€™s retirement benefit    when the man is aged exactly 40?

I own a flat within a block; I have a leasehold agreement as opposed to a freehold. I only have contents insurance as the buildings are insured by the freeholder.      Recently I accidentally dropped something onto my built-in cooker hob and smashed it. I have tried to claim under the accidental damage section of my contents insurance but it has been declined by the insurer on the grounds of a built-in hob is not part of contents as it is not moveable.      Should I approach the freeholder and ask to make a claim under his buildings insurance? If his insurance does not cover for accidental damage then do I have a valid claim under my contents? If not, what should I do?      My point is - how could I have been covered for accidental damage to a fitted appliance when I was not obliged to take out buildings insurance as I am a leaseholder? It seems like an unfair loophole if there is no way of covering accidental damage to fitted appliances if someone is a leaseholder and only needs contents insurance.      Thanks.
