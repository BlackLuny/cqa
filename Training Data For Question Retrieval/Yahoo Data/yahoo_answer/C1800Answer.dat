UWNgB9gAaa	No you don't really have to but when you install the new motherboard and open your windows it will probably give you the blue screen and you have to reinstall the windows .|`|WtwpzZXiaa	no but you may have problems with your drivers booting up to your new motherboard.. you can do a repair install with your OS to have it rededect the new drivers for your motherboard|`|kSyiUxYSaa	You should as a rule but you don't have to. Windows will install all the drivers and stuff for everything and then you can run the mobo setup disk after that.    You'll know if the hd will pick the board up when you turn the computer on for the first time. If it doesn't work then you have to reformat the hd. Simple as that.|`|xMqgB2GDaa	Depends. If you were using the OEM license that came with your HP, the license is hardware bound and if you replace your motherboard, it's considered a "major hardware change" and will not work with your OEM license. If you had your own copy of windows, it should be fine.     I went through the same process with my Gateway going to the 780i board from XFX. I ended up ditching the OS and going with Vista Ultimate 64.|`|UTm9gKqfaa	you don't have to but you must have the support cd of your new motherboard.

Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|uAEZeyAAaa	boot in a safe mode  restore your system to a point when it was working fine.  this will work regardless it is a virus troubling your system or your system files accidentally becoming corrupt|`|g4ubbgmqaa	here is a list of online virus scanners Onecare.Live.com (this is microsoft's)  Housecall.Trendmicro.com Symantec.com  Comodo.com  these are free and will remove  them from your machine|`|AfXrumMTaa	I created a video that shows people how to remove almost any virus, spyware, adware, trojan, worm etc for Free (using free     software).

zorYTX59aa	You have to be a YouTube "partner", which more-or-less means you are either  a film or video creator/producer/director, an artiste (musician/singer/comedian),  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance   (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission   (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).  http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject    But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:  -- You create your own "original" videos  -- You own all the copyrights concerned  -- The content is 100% yours, no income splitting if there's advertising revenue  -- You upload videos on a regular basis  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers  -- You are a resident in one of the 19 countries where YouTube has local sites  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.    Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination   of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied together can easily surpass  10,000 channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, something like 800   subscribers and 20 videos, or possibly 500 subbies along with at least 30 vids.    Once you've finally been "accredited" by the YouTube directors/administrators,  they will give you all the special tools and codes which will enable you to have:  -- a special "banner" for your profile page   -- a banner alongside every played video ?  -- your channel-page video on "autoplay"  -- automatic "high-def" to all your videos  -- extra "profile" and new "bulletin" boxes  -- "special" videos over 10 minutes long  -- custom skins/sizes for the video player  -- the light-bulb "watch at night" feature (for broadcasters)  -- the possibility of sharing in ad revenue  -- being at the very top of search results  -- a "More From" section which overrides the regular "Related Videos" section  and featuring only your uploaded videos.    If you wish to know more, go to the top righthand corner of any YouTube page,   click "Help" and then type in the searchbox the word "partner". Or click below:  http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bi...    I hope you find all my information helpful.|`|B4DFdZ0Maa	You must become a youtube partner:  http://www.youtube.com/partners  This means your videos must have original content, NOT copyrighted... if that's even possible lol.

4MYWPD9Yaa	This is why malware is so rampant. People want "plug and forget" security. Well, security doesn't work that way. If you do stupid things, your computer will get infected. It doesn't matter how Consumer Reports ranks software.    Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)    Notice how  2, 3, and 5 require you to actually do something? Still,  1 and  4 are about as close to "plug and forget" as possible... and certainly more effective than Bitdefender and McAfee.|`|tOCESHLYaa	Yes in the test that Consumer Reports did those two came out on top. But my understanding was there was problems with the way they tested. At least according to the software companies that did not do as good. I've used both of those and did not like either one. I could not get Bitdefender to run right on my computer. Which does not mean anything, sometimes some programs just don't work with other ones. I do know that bitdefender offers a ton of features. Mcafee is offered free from my isp and I won't use it. Not only does it score on the low side in most Anti-virus test. It uses a lot of ram and does slow down a system. Most people I know here also have the same isp and many of them won't use Mcafee. It's free so I know I'm not the only one who have issues with it. If you look around you'll find that there are a lot of tests out there and it seems none of them can agree on which Security Suite is best. I also know many users here who are very happy with Mcafee. Since you can get a free trial of all the Security Suites just try before you buy.

a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	Yea, the first poster is giving you a very common misconception about how processors work.    2.33ghz x 4 does NOT equal 9.32ghz. It equals 2.33ghz. A quad core simply means it can run 4 simultaneous threads at 2.33ghz, no faster.        Anyhow, these days there is more to a CPU's performance than simply clock speed (Ghz).

The "other end" also has to be able to talk back! So it too will need a directional antenna and enough power to reach back to the source!  The antenna needs to be outside and mounted in the clear!

Better yet, get a DVD/RW drive (they're really cheap now).    Some time ago, there was an advantage in separating writers and readers, there being limitations in write/read speeds in cdroms. There seems to be no operational advantage to separate the two now. Such a limitation in write/read speed MAY arise again when the commercial Blu-Ray writers come out, but not with DVD/cdrw.    Simply, the technologies of DVD/CDRW are relatively old, and have thus been made efficient.

Unless you accept very long battery charge times (like, days!) of a trickle charger with smaller solar cells, you're out of luck here!  There is good reason you only find solar chargers for small and less power-hungry devices (like mobile phones) on the market.|`|mDq4Mf9zaa	CHECK OUT CIRCUT CITY OR BEST BUY    anywho ive nevr even heard of a solar charger for my computr now i want one!!!! lolz
m0fU0H7jaa	Yes, this is possible. What you have to do is locate your iTunes Library database file (.xml), most likely under ~user/music/iTunes, and replace all of the entries in it that point to your current hard drive location (ie. ~user/music/iTunes/iTunes Music), and replace it with the new location (ie. MyBook/music/iTunes Library).    You can do this using a text edit program with a find and replace function, or copy and paste the content of the database file into Word and use the find and replace function there. Copy and paste it back in, and boom. Make sure to make a backup of the original...just in case.    From there, you create a new iTunes folder on your external, dump over all of your music to your new drive (just as your previous iTunes playlist was), drop the xml file, and if all goes well, your library will be moved, and even your playcount, ratings and album art will be maintained.    This is the way I did it a couple of years ago with an older version of iTunes, however Apple has a tutorial on their website regarding library changes that may be a bit easier.|`|RAnBl0JFaa	Just transfer the folder or folders containing your mp3's onto your external drive.
E0chY1b5aa	No beep codes or anything?  Better make sure those fans are indeed turning.  Follow all of the cables coming from the power supply (who's fan also needs to be turning BTW) and be sure they are fully seated.  That power supply puts out several voltages just because 12V fans are on does not mean the 5V, etc. stuff is working.  Power supply testers are cheap ($10) and the P/S is usually first to go but poke around in there and give us more info.  POWER-DOWN FIRST AND GROUND YOURSELF BEFORE TOUCHING ANYTHING.

UTnSFN01aa	They are both completely different applications,making them hard to compare.  It depends.  If you are really a person interested in magic, then Marty's would be good for you.  I think that may get old fast and you wouldn't get much entertainment for yourself out of it.  Distant Shore on the other hand is not only cheaper, but offers a more in depth user experience.  I looked at the reviews for both, and Distant Shore appeared higher rated.  There are tons more apps out there better and worse, simpler and more complex.  Just think about which you would USE more.  I hate spending money on my apps, and having them just sit on my iPhone unused.  If I were you I would choose Distant Shore from those.  Good luck.

jzex4ncSaa	At their core, functions make an application easier to develop by allowing you to break it down into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are then, in code, fitted together to perform all your application's tasks. When you create a function, you gain the ability to logically group related statements and to focus on writing your application one function at a time.    Because you can call and execute a function over and over again as needed, functions also enable you to reduce the overall amount of code that you must write. This, in turn, makes your application easier to create and easier to maintain over time. If your application's major functionality is isolated into functions, for example, it is easier to change its features without impacting the rest of the code.    When you find yourself adding code to perform a major operation within the application, particularly one that is executed often, you usually have a good candidate for a function. For example, if you have several locations where you need to perform the same steps to validate user input, enclosing the code in a function allows you to invoke its functionality simply by using the function's name.    I found, professional programmers often try to limit each function they write to performing one single, major operation or task that the application requires. This makes application code more modular and streamlined. It also helps to isolate errors.    When it comes to fixing bugs, functions can be likened to fire doors on a ship or within a building. They isolate problems within a given section of the code. You can locate bugs within a function more easily when program flow executes to specific, reliable points. Functions are those points. If, for example, a programmer adds 100 new lines of code to an application he is working on and suddenly discovers that the program no longer behaves properly, he might have a hard time figuring out where the problem lies. However, if this code is contained within four or five functions, the programmer stands a better chance of locating the bug more quickly because he can comment out functions one by one to determine where the error lies.      good luck  -de|`|edd8219573ea4217ed067b5c9b91f031aa	The previous answers are all accurate.  One thing I would add as a professional programmer is that you also gain the benefits of variable scope when used properly.  This allows you to isolate the changes made to data to within copies of the variables you used to call the function.    It is always tempting to be lax in programming standards when making a simple script (such as VBScript or JavaScript), however, over time that 'simple script' has a tendency to grow and the more modular you make it the first time, the easier it will be to add those inevitable enhancements that users will request as soon as you publish your code... ;)|`|4PkRRHEtaa	So you don't have to rewrite the code again and again, so that you organize the code better, so that once you write it you don't have to worry about how it works -- just call the function with its parameters and let the program handle it.    Honestly, there's a plethora of reasons why functions should be used.|`|44IT2kmNaa	Yes, functions make code more readable and allow you to call them as many times as you need to. Without them, everytime you wanted to do the same thing you would keep having to repeat code.    A final note on functions is that they aide in the debuging process. For example, you can check on the return values of functions as they are called when a program is not behaving in a manner that you expect.|`|AA11611248	Functions are premade mathematical calculations that save you a lot of work programming the same thing on your own.|`|LpCDltJMaa	In general functions are used to make "small inner programs" in your code, let's say you want to make a script that requires you to create a random number between 1 and 200, you either make the code yourself or just use the "Rnd" function, to  1- shorten your time, 2- less effort, 3- easier to read and trace.4- less bugs :) That's for the implicit functions, but for the explicit functions (User-defined functions), they are usually used to create a certain scheme for your program, if the program was to retrieve data from a database, you can use a function that makes this data stored in a local file, so you do not need to use the same code for over and over for different databases for the very same job..    I hope it helps.

If you want free music (and are too lazy to read the answers posted every time this question comes up here, which is a few times a day) then read.    You have some options.    You can buy the music online at legit sites like iTunes.  If you dont have an iPod, you can use any number of free programs to convert the mp4 to mp3.  The problem is that much of the stuff on pay sites is covered by DRM that limits what you can do with it.    You can rip music from CDs  helpful if your local library is stocked, or you have friends that share your tastes but are okay with paying for them.    You can stream music from an internet radio station through your PC, then use a program like Audacity to record that stream as an MP3 or wav file.  You can scan through that recorded stream looking for the songs you want, then copy that part of the stream containing the desired song to an excerpted copy of the larger stream  (audacity handles this as well).    If you must use peer-share, you run the risk of infecting your pc by 1) downloading the client program, because it may have viruses; 2) visiting the webpage that hosts the program, because it may contain malware of its own & 3) downloading the media which (in peer-share) comes from other users.  No Peer-Share system can guarantee the safety or quality of its media.    Id avoid Limewire and its variants.  I tried limewire a few weeks back after years of happy reliance on winmx and emule.

For 2 GB of RAM, the settings should be something like Initial size: 2048 (MB) and Maximum size: 3072 (MB). You could also just change the settings to "System managed size" and let XP pick its own sizes.

If your Mac OS X 10.4 home directory is on an AFP server and you burn a disc (CD or DVD) that gets interrupted, you might not be able to delete the Burn Folder from your home directory afterwards. When you try, an "error -61" alert may appear. (The disc itself might be unusable after an interrupted burn.)

My wife, Linda made a brief appearance in the 200th (Robin Williams) episode of "Law And Order SVU" (the irate customer in the burger joint immediately before the opening credits).  NBC refused me permission to upload a 5-minutes clip because they own "Law And Order SVU".  If I can't upload a video clip of my own wife, I guess you have no chance.

OpduZC3Eaa	Hi! =)  The computer you're looking at here looks to me like a pretty good choice for what you are intending to use it for. It's a really good price for it to! It's something I would buy for myself if I were in your position. Large gig and RAM aren't always needed when you're just looking for the basics and a little bit more. The one you've chosen is the one I think will give you guys the most of what you're looking for.

tOCESHLYaa	The Best Anti-Virus program. That question is asked at least 10 times a day and youll get a bunch of different answers. There is no best Anti-virus program. There are several very good ones. All of these have high detection and good removal rates. avast! Professional Edition, Avira AntiVir Premium, Norton 2009. Not far behind these leaders is Nod32 AVG paid version, and Kaspersky. You would have good protection if you picked any one of these. Its important to find one that runs good on your computer and doesnt have any conflicts with programs or setting on your computer. All of them offer a free trial.  Free Anti-Virus software is also good. But the list is a lot shorter. Only Avast and Avira offer good free protection. Avira free does not offer anti-spyware protection which is no big deal since most users add an anti-spyware program anyway. Some users will tell you that the free programs offer protection that is as good or better than the paid version. They will even give you links to Virus Bulletin tests, AV comparatives tests. The links are useless since neither of these sites test the free versions. The results you see are for the paid versions. How can Avast or Avira sell an anti-virus program if their free version are just as good. AVG free was good 3 years ago but is really lacking. You only have to go to AVG web site where they state the free version is only basic protection. It does not have anti-rootkit protection. Just to name one of things it is missing. If you want top detection go with Norton, Avast Pro, or Avira Premium. If you want good free try Avast or Avira. Good luck with your new Anti-virus program.|`|uAEZeyAAaa	best is kaspersky(better gui and abilities) followed by eset(confusing gui)    best of free antiviruses is avira|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	It's not a program.    Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|j5k0VRbPaa	symantec  endpoint protectio n|`|WgruZkHRaa	Avast and it's free but better if you pay for it|`|7vEVEmWEaa	Well, my first anti-virus program I had was Trend Micro PC-cillin or something like that, and I got a virus with it and had to delete everything on my computer.

Kaspersky  They are probably the two best.|`|UBc84Zqvaa	the fact that everyone who has answered this question has said either "I use Norton..." or "I use McAfee..." should send alarm bells ringing. This is because the spotty, overweight and under occupied "geeks" who spend all their time engineering viruses, including trojans and malicious code, Spyware and Malware, which kill your PC, target the most popular anti-virus software which it is easier to attack. To put it simply- More people using it=more people to infect, despite the cost of getting the software in the first place. I have used BOTH of the above systems and BOTH ended up in me having to do a complete restore on two different machines- (over a period of about 4 years) - and therfore I would strongly advise you download AVG or a similar product (the basic version of which is free and includes AV, A-SW and product updates for FREE, and the pay version is equally good with tech support etc.)... either that or get an Apple Mac lol below is a link to an independent review of the top AV software. peace|`|uuDloQnCaa	Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.    I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then Norton or Mcafee.    Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  Comodo: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Why Avast is better then AVG:    On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from poison webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.    What AVG does not do: http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-vi...|`|DkboZvloaa	The only way to be 100% protected is to disconnect your PC from the internet. There is no "best" anti-virus program. After using PCs for several years I can tell you that different ones work for different setups and needs.    The free anti-virus programs are good for basic protection, but they (as you'd probably expect) lack things like a firewall, root-kit protection, and other advanced features. If you only want virus protection and nothing else Avast, avira, and AVG are all good. I have tried them all and can tell you that they have no impact on your PC performance.    If you want more security you have to pay up. Norton and Mcafee are the most popular. Mcafee IMO is crap, it misses viruses all the time and slows down PCs worse than a virus. Norton has improved with its 2009 versions, but they are slow to load and still slow down your PC in some cases. There are better offerings out there. Oncare is being shut down in June and was never any good anyway, so avoid that. If your going to pay, I'd recommend either NOD32, Kaspersky, Avast premium, avira premium, or Trend Micro. They all offer a trial and great protection, so give them a try and see which one you like best. Don't assume what works for someone else will work for you. Also don't assume that all the posts you read on the internet know what they are talking about. Many people THINK they are fine, but their PC is littered with viruses.|`|PPFonRYdaa	Eset Nod32|`|AvERZv04aa	Norton|`|i4SVk2Cpaa	i would go with norton.|`|c68478bf085bc0e4d6aaf10a27fd367baa	There is not really a best because using multiple anti-virus programs is the way to go.

VdHKQMeXaa	There are a several reasons why your computer is freezing/slow. First question is when the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.  Go to:http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... get one to free scan your pc    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.    3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.  Get the best one from: http://toptenantispywareviews.com to scan your computer.    4. That last area is a hardware driver. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestions and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing/speed up.  Check your drivers. Hope this helps.

G3hWsarzaa	There is a very simple solution to your problem, and it will not mess up your computer. But it might cost you some money.     First, make sure that you know where the product disc of your version of Microsoft office is in case you want to use them later. Your computer should have come with this disc. Then go to the list of programs on the start menu on your computer. When you find all of the different office programs, highlight them and click on uninstall.    After that, go onto ebay.com, amazon.com, or any other website where you can buy computer products. Search for Microsoft office 2003. I'm suggesting that you buy online because it is a lot cheaper to do so. In stores, retail prices can get aroung $150 or more! There will be a couple different variations of it, but don't get confused by flashy names like "premium" or "professional". Just make sure that the version you select features all of the programs you need. Try and find a version that is in new or at least excellent condition. Make sure that you buy american too!     Once you get the product in the mail, check the package to see if it came with a product key. If it doesn't, send it back immediately! Because once you install it, you will be prompted to enter a product key. The prodoct key will unlock the program and enable you to use it. After that, you should be ready to roll.    Good luck with your studies, and good luck with your computer! It sounds like you already know a lot about computers and that you will make a fine Legal Assistant. They are probably teaching you to use all of the 2003 programs because they are a lot easier to use. In my opinion, Office 2007 is a very hard program to use, and is very complicated! If you have any other questions, please e-mail me. my e-mail address is sam5891@juno.com.    I hope I helped!

7852ab4a27573534dd9002f3775fb559aa	I'll give you my best guess based on what you described - I'd need more info to be sure.    First:  Not playing the DCs for a long time is what caused the "time and date" screen to come up.  The DC needs to be played regularly to keep the internal battery charged.  If it looses the charge, it forgets the date and time and needs to have them re-entered on bootup.    Second:  I've never heard of a boot disk messing with the DC in any way. If your DCs were manufactured before OCT 2000, they are able to use a boot disk to load burned games (check the sticker on the bottom).  Most after that date are just not able to play burned games.    So here is my suggestion(s) to solve your problems:    First, power on the DC without any disk in it.  Date/Time should come up, try to set it.  If the first controller in the first port (A) doesn't work, DON'T 'hotswap' the controller.  Power down the DC, swap another controller into port A, power up again.  You can skip the date/time page by (I believe) the start button, so you don't have to mess around figuring the controls to set it.    Second, if that doesn't work, my guess would be dirty contacts in your controller port(s).  This can happen during long storage when dust or whatever gets in there.  Q-tip, rubbing alcohol, gently clean the ports on the console, and also the controller plug.  You may have to rip off some of the cotton on the q-tip to get it to fit in the port.    Hope that takes care of your problem.

ZvkUBNOtaa	An external drive is a good solution for adding more storage, if that's what you're looking for.  They come with 3 types of interface; USB, eSATA, and Firewire (1394a&b).  Any of these function exactly like an internal drive and will show up in 'My Computer' as just another drive with it's own drive letter.  On newer motherboards you can even boot from them by proper configuration of the motherboard settings.    The cheapest and easiest solution is a USB attached drive, basically you just plug it in and the Operating System does the rest.  The problem with a USB attached drive is it is a LOT slower than a SATA drive.  Being as you have a 70 GB drive installed I'm assuming that you have an older computer or a laptop so the speed difference may not be all that important to you.  If you're using the external for data storage, movies, music, etc you're not going to notice any serious disadvantages to a USB drive.  Speeds for USB connected drives run around 480 Mb/s and straight SATA runs at an advertised ideal of 3 Gb/s, which in my experience it never achieves.    You can buy just the external enclosure, they're $15 to $35 or so, and that can be a good idea if you have an old drive laying around you want to get a little more use from.  You have to be careful that the drive and the enclosure use the same connection, SATA, IDE, etc.      You can buy various external drives at any Big Box Electronics store or online.      For more performance you can go with an eSATA connected drive, but unless your motherboard has an eSATA connector on the backplane you'll have to install a card or an adapter to an internal SATA connector, which kind of blows chunks on doing it the easy way.    A Firewire attached drive is a good way to use up that mostly useless Firewire port on a PC if you have one, and the speeds on Firewire connection run marginally faster than USB.  Not enough faster to affect your decision on which to get though, and if you don't use Firewire for anything else it may just be best to avoid it unless the drive comes with both USB and Firewire connectors.    Lastly, the advantages to external drives are that you don't have to open a computer case, they're portable between computers (just plug and unplug), and when or if you get a new computer you have all your data in a nice handy package that takes only seconds to plug in and start using.|`|XYOYml59aa	installing a hard drive on a desktop is really easy. take the case cover off, find a spot in the case that you can put the new hard drive (if you have the option leave a space free between cd and hard drives and everything (for heat)), then you need to put the 4 pin power wire on (the pins are on the hard drive and the pug should have 4 holes in the front), then depending the type of hard drive is in there, you attach the cable that is on the old hard drive to the new one.     Just make sure the computer is unplugged and that the new hard drive is set to slave and the old one is the master (this way you don't have any issues with your operating system) and if there is a problem, switch the order the hard drives are on the cable.    You may also nee to buy a new hard drive cable because they don't always come with 2 attachments for hard drives.|`|ZJCoUMijaa	Yes, if you break open any external enclosure, there's an internal drive inside.  You have to make sure you have the right interface (IDE/SATA) and right size (notebook is 2.5" and desktop is 3.5")|`|sX3paKxBaa	Dude..Thats the POINT!|`|00900ea5d2411190e6c929c6d08dae26aa	Don't even try it.

The only difference is, if you plan on running software or games off of it, it will be slower because it is running off of your USB or Firewire. But externals are a great way to keep files and to run programs.    Free computer help, XP tips, tech news, free software, sign up on the free forums for help! http://www.techslip.net
ZvkUBNOtaa	Disconnect ALL of your USB devices.  In device manager delete every entry that shows a problem.  Do this by selecting them one at a time and right click, then click 'Uninstall'.  Then right click at any entry and select "Scan for Hardware Changes".  That will force a reinstall of the drivers and software for the motherboard's USB bus.  Check to see that there is no BANG (the exclamation point in a yellow circle) or red X on the USB  root hubs and then reconnect your USB devices one by one to see if one of them is causing the problem.  A USB connection that was accidentally grounded could cause this kind of problem, but it could also short out the USB chip on the motherboard, in which case you're done with USB on that board.

They kind of work between French and English for very simple texts, because the 2 languages have a similar syntax. They do not work at all for languages like German or Russian with their plethora of morphemes and their complicated syntax.    Sometimes I put a text in for a laugh. It's often very funny to put something in and then have the result translated back into the original language. Unless somebody went to the trouble to translate an idiomatic expression - and very often no-one did - all you will get is gibberish.

Personally, it's time for a new system or upgrade the motherboard/cpu/ram (cheaper to get a new system and then sell that one).|`|cBspfn7xaa	ya go for 2gb..even it can only hold 1.5gb it'll still get 1.5 out of ur 2gb..|`|qEYYHNyyaa	According to your crucial scan it states you have only 2 slots and they can accept 184 pin DDR 3200 RAM.    But, according to your motherboard specs you have 3 slots supporting 168 pin SDRAM. Confirmed with the picture.    These two types of RAM are not interchangeable or compatible. I would stay with the motherboard specs, you need 168 pin SDRAM, with a max of 1.5 GB

Its very possible that you got an incomplete version of explorer, or the files are corrupted.  I know you said that you don't want to switch to foxfire, and that's fine, but often there are issues with software programs that are "free" and downloading a newer version can help.     It also helps to have multiple browsers just in case this happens. Google also has a browser now as well.|`|a4h65m68aa	Ok, really why don't you switch to Firefox? Why continue to use a browser that is known to give problems? Do you really have a reason other than you are just comfortable with it? Trust me, you will become comfortable with another browser after a little time with it. You can still use IE when a website is not compatible with anything else, but for the majority of the time you spend on the internet, why not just switch to a better browser?     If you still want to be stubborn I would try reinstalling IE.|`|4c01f84c489c38ef4897dc66078e3c31aa	When you get this error try clicking on the button below that for e.g Details or something.

FBQZ06vraa	When something suddenly gets "disabled by administrator," I suspect malware is the cause.  It's time to do some anti-malware scans.    If you have an anti-virus, make sure it has the latest virus definitions and run a scan with it in Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking.  That often prevents malware from protecting itself.  If you dont have one, many people here swear by AVG (its free).     I suggest you also download Ad-Aware 2008 and Spybot S&D (theyre free), install them, update them and run them. If any of the above (or any anti-malware, for that matter) doesnt seem to be able to run properly or get rid of everything it reports finding, try running it again in Safe Mode.     Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.      To get into Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking:    1. Log out and reboot your machine.  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.  3. Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu.  4. Login.  If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password.  5. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.    6. When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.    Note that even if the anti-malware programs get rid of the malware, they may not be able to reverse the effects.  Search the Web for possible fixes.    Update and run everything regularly, not just when you think you already have malware.    Good luck.|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	Try this: http://www.annoyances.org/exec/show/arti...|`|Zm8sQpKLaa	Control Panel    Start Menu and Taskbar Icon

It causes double firewall and routing issues. It will also slow the connection. The correct way is to connect the dsl filter to the line. Then your best performance will be if you buy a proper dsl wireless router/modem to replace the other router. This should connect to the filter, and ALL machines connect to the router either wired or wireless. You then only present one firewall and can easily adjust the ports for anything. You also only have 1 routing delay.

qEYYHNyyaa	Ok my guess is with the power supply and the booster your still not getting enough amps to this card it needs a minimum of 36 amps on the 12+ volt rail. Can you give details about PSU and the booster?    Try hooking the power from booster only, dont split between the separate power supplies. Have the booster run the Vid card only.    Ok do you have the booster plugged into the wall outlet? Did you hook up both 6 pin connectors into vid card?    Thanks for your quick respones, I am currently stumped. The power booster is enough to run the card on its own, I do not know why your system is crashing. Currently searching online for others with similar problems.    Ok a little research has brought up others with very similar problems. The majority of them seem to point to overheating as the primary cause of the sudden system crash. In your question you mentioned getting a BIOS message stating this. Is there any possibility that during installation of your new card that you somehow bumped your CPU heatsink? Maybe dislodging it?     The other cause of system crashes is inadequate power supply. I dont believe this is the problem in your case with your new booster. However there is always the possibility of new hardware arriving DOA, can you test your booster on your old  X1300?    OK is it a socket 775??  I believe this could be it, Stock Heatsink and fan? This is a very common problem with the socket 775 heatsinks. They require ALOT of force to adequately seat them. If they are not your system will quickly overheat.    Nice!! Im glad you got it working one more bit of advice for you. When you remove the heatsink the original thermal pad is usually destroyed. You might consider replacing it soon to get the best connection possible between your heatsink and CPU. good luck  :D

Also see if the settings for the monitor is set correctly in the display options.    Has this just started happening or has something been changed on your pc?    Could the graphic card be overheating, is the card fan if fitted running?    Arnak|`|M1bKnCuRaa	Well, I am not sure but I did have a similar problem once.  It was caused by a certain program and went away after I uninstalled it. If you have recently installed any new software you could check that.  It could also be a problem with the connection to the monitor or with the monitor itself.    You may also have a virus or registry errors, so you could scan your system for those. Ccleaner is a pretty useful utility and is free.|`|AA10970145	It seems one of two... either monitor problem,,,or graphic card problem,,try to uninstall VGA driver then reinstall it,,, if hte problem persist,, try another monitor|`|UTm9gKqfaa	it's time to change your video card.|`|lRpECZLuaa	Boot your PC in Safe Mode and reinstall your graphics card's drivers and then boot normally, it should then work.|`|5UpCEm0faa	Check your screen resolution and colour depth.

ZU5y3OVVaa	The game will not run with the RAM you have. Go to www.cclonline.com to buy cheap memory. If your not sure what type of memory you need or how much your motherboard can support go to www.crucial.com/uk and use the memory config tool.    Your service pack is fine as it is higher than required.    As to wether or not you will have room for Sims 3 if you uninstall Sims 2 depends on how much disk space you have left and how much is required.

First off, I think you're reffering to XP Service Pack 2 and 3.   IF it says you need 2, and you have 3, you're ahead of the game and are fine.    Uninstalling it won't allow you to get more RAM.  Only way to get more is to buy more.   Go to newegg.com and buy a 1GB chip there.  I think you'll get it for $30 or $40.  My guess is you need DDR memory since you computer came with so little.  Open up the computer and look at the chip inside to see which kind it is.  DDR 2 will not work with DDR so be careful of that.  Its not expensive and all you do is just put the new chip in physically and you're good to go.

Two common ways of saying them are saying the individual digits, such as,    one nine two dot one six eight.    The other common way is to say the numbered groups separately, such as:    one ninety two dot one sixty eight dot ten dot one.

An IP address consists of four so-called octets separated by dots. The octet is a binary number of eight digits, which equals the decimal numbers from 0 to 255. To make IP addresses more easy to read and write, they are often expressed as four decimal numbers, each separated by a dot. This format is called "dotted-decimal notation".

zorYTX59aa	It's not that easy becoming a YouTube "partner". Almost all of them are either  a film or video creator/producer/director, an artiste (musician/singer/comedian),  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance   (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission   (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).  http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject    But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:  -- You create your own "original" videos  -- You own all the copyrights concerned  -- The content is 100% yours, no income splitting if there's advertising revenue  -- You upload videos on a regular basis  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers  -- You are a resident in one of the 19 countries where YouTube has local sites  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.    Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination   of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied together can easily surpass  10,000 channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, something like 800   subscribers and 20 videos, or possibly 500 subbies along with at least 30 vids.    Nevermind that your music is out-&-out   "copyright infringement", you only have   50 subs and 600 CVs.    First, multiply all your statistics by ten.  Only when you get finally there, should   you start thinking about YT partnership.    Sorry to burst your bubble.|`|5TSRRBKuaa	To be honest being partnered just depends on getting lots of views and subscribers. It's all up to the people of youtube to decide whether they would like to watch your videos. You're allowed to put music on your videos I would just advise that you list the song name(s) in the description box and give credit to the artist(s) that made the song(s).

Hope this helps.|`|812793fbbb1f4d6a8b07ee04d74ebb7daa	do you have a ATA or sata, driver, you need to know that?|`|4yhGXh8kaa	Well there's not so much a right HDD  (Hard Drive) as just ones that will work.    First off do you want an internal (inside your laptop) replacement, or do u want to buy an external that sits on your desk and plugs into your computer.    Internal: you need an ATA laptop hdd. not to be confused with the desktop versions which won't fit. ATA is the interface, or what kind of pluggin it uses. There are different types of ATA (ATA/33 or ATA/66) which are all compatible to my knowledge, SATA is not ATA however.     So you want a hdd that is ATA/   and not SATA, SCSI.    External: As long as you have a USB port (you do) then any USB external hdd will work, which is almost all of them.     If your buying in a store, bring your laptop, always. If you're buying online link the hdd into answers with the model of your laptop just like this time and ask to be sure.

Microsoft stopped shipping XP on June 30, 2008.

7Z2JWAaoaa	I should be able to help you here, at the moment my main computer that i use for 3d work (animation and 3d art) uses a Q6600, which is an LGA 775 socket processor, so make sure you get a motherboard with that socket type, another thing that you'll want to remember when you are building your computer is that you will want a differnent fan, i recommend an Arctic Cooler Freezer 7. But a very good motherboard manufacturer is Asus, im using a Asus P5N-D, which cost me about $150, its probably gone down in price now, so that will be in your budget.     When you say plug in your xbox 360, do you mean just to use your computer monitor as a screen for the 360? if so then you will need the vga adaptor which can then be plugged in to the back of your monitor, this would take up one vga port and the other dvi port would be used to connect to your graphics card for your computers output.     As far as graphics cards are concerned, sli and crossfire are used on nearly all the ati and nvidia cards so the best thing to do is find a graphics card that is whithin your budget, lets say $200, then if its sli capable, later when the price of the card drops and you have more money you can add it in later. Im going to guess and think you want a graphics card fit for gaming purposes because you mentioned the xbox 360, so for $200 you could buy a Nvidia Geforce 9800GTX+ which is pre overclocked, dont worry its safe and done by the video card manufacturer, it has 512mb of onboard video memory and fast memory and core clock speeds, it will run all games that are out at the moment including crysis and other similar graphics intensive games. Here's a link to it http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as... That costs $165, with delvery this should be around $200.     Here is a review for the card: http://www.hardwarecanucks.com/forum/har...

As for connecting the 360 to it, get an Xbox HDMI cable(overpriced)  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    Assuming you have an HDMI port on your monitor it should work. If you don't but you have a DVI port just get an HDMI adapter.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductLis...

Unsigned ints cannot go below zero, but temperatures can.    C2C should be declared to return an int, and take in an int.  It should contain the VERY FIRST LINE of your question.    You declared an unsigned int Celsius, but then use it before initializing it or even calling your non-existent C2C() function on it.  Again, it should be signed, and it should be assigned the result of C2C(Fahrenheit).    You also forgot the cout     You also only need to declare that you're using the std namespace once.

There is software that can help with this, but for the most part yes.    Now, if you know your way around a computer, you probably know at least a little bit of DOS, and if you know more, you can go and 'recover' some of the files.     One other quick fix is to defragment your computer after you delete all the files.|`|AQgr5lQYaa	There are only two ways to completely, 100% remove a file.    One would be to physically destroy the hard drive, breaking it into bits, and then burning it.    The other way is to low level format the hard drive.    A simple format, such as one that's done when re-loading an operating system, or simply removing the partition, setting it back up, formatting, and reloading the OS won't do it.  A low level format, also known as "writing zeros to the drive" will completely, and ultimately remove everything the hard drive has ever seen.    A typical format only rewrites the first few bytes of a file, making it non-legible to an operating system.  Software is out there and in use that will attempt to put the file back together using what's actually left over.    The low level format is different, as every single bit of the entire hard drive is set to a zero value.  There is no way to recover anything if this has occurred.      The programs, such as "file shredder" and the like will not accomplish this same task, no matter what they try to tell you.|`|bilrFJ1zaa	those files can still be accessed via software available on the market or even people with too much time on their hands.      you can format your computer to give it a 'fresh' feel, leaving it to appear as if there's nothing on there. however, there are two types of formatting, low-level formatting or high-level formatting.    high-level formatting is the common method which is used on a typical windows disc.  this still doesn't completely clean the files and are retained until overwritten by new files.    a low-level formatting software can be obtained for free from manufacturer sites.   you should get the software from the same manufacturer site who created your hard drive (the manufacturer can be found on a label on the hardware itself).|`|cbRhatVSaa	To really permanently delete something you need a special couple thousand dollar hard drive smasher. But that's only if you have really sensitive stuff on it. For the average person reformatting the hard drive should be enough...|`|qEy34ueZaa	It will be out of sight, but still somewhere. One option is to remove and destroy the hard drive. Another is to buy a program to erase all for good.  Note: there is currently a legal process going on in my area, involving a pro-eminent adult, who was found to have loads of child pornography material (erased) in his hard drive, when the PC was sent for repairs (reported by the PC technician). The adult's positian involved contact with kids.|`|wUqeZl3Saa	If you simply delete the stuff, most of it can be recovered with the right software. A lot of years ago, we bought a computer off of a vice principal of an area school and he was very sure he "deleted" everything sensitive. I later recovered the combination to the school's office safe along with several other bits of information that I shouldn't have had. Needless to say, we could have caused quite a bit of trouble for him. A lot of people would love to have this kind of information handed to them.    So the next problem you have is completely cleaning the hard drive. I suggest a complete wipe and overwriting the entire drive with at least zero's.     Some free solutions and more info:  http://www.killdisk.com/    This one I actually read the papers referenced by the web page when they were written.  http://www.heidi.ie/node/6    An article from PC World  http://www.pcworld.com/article/110338/an...    More info from ZDnet (PC Magazine)  http://blogs.zdnet.com/storage/?p=129    The above links will give you more information than I can reasonably type here.    One other option is replace the drive with a new one, and physically destroy the old one. I've done this occasionally to be sure the data was destroyed.    Shadow Wolf|`|IGJGUfjNaa	You have to perform a "secure delete" to remove information permanently. This is the only real way to erase information off of magnetic media. This works by encrypting the data and deleting it many times over until its nothing more than unreadable code. Shredding is another technique but not nearly as effective. Also. The US Dept of Defense endorse "secure delete" as the only way to permanently remove data.

While writing "Prevent Restore" fills out information to the end of each cluster, leaving no chance to restore even just one word!       Then you will be sure that nothing is recoverable !

Uhhhhhhhhhh...... on a budget i suggest you build your own.  That's what i did and i got a computer as good as my moms $1400 one for about $400.  It's honestly not as hard as it sounds.  Just plug everything in.  I suggest newegg.com to get parts.  My case is xion and it looks SICK!!!!!!|`|7Z2JWAaoaa	My advice to you would be buy a book about buolding a computer and then build it. It's half the price and you will end up with a pc exactly to your needs.|`|iKV2fNeTaa	alienware but its very expensive|`|qEYYHNyyaa	If your on a budget doing it yourself would be the best choice.

You can also look it up in wikipedia.|`|l0z5ZBPAaa	build your own    or dell    but mostly build your own    and gaming PC on a budget?

Alienware is overpriced, underperforming Dell crap!|`|bIdS7kuzaa	WidowPC, CybertronPC, Dell XPS, or Alienware are all good choices. However, it doesn't really matter what company you buy the computer from because they all have components from other companies. If you want a really fast gaming computer it's best to built it from scratch. If your on a budget i would just buy a computer from futureshop or something such as Acer or HP becuase nowadays any computer around $1000 is capable of gaming thanks to quad-core processors, etc.|`|hRoFzBOEaa	I have 3 Alienwares that cost me around $23,000 and Well go else where ,save some money, and dont be fooled by a brand name."Like I was".

If in California, you could be affected by the ATT cut.  If not, it could be a Level3 issue, which was occurring earlier today with some Comcast subscribers.    The best thing to do would be to provide a traceroute and see where it either times out or the hops are slow.

ohhtS2BPaa	You will need to know what type of extension the downloaded file has on it first. Assuming you have XP.  1. Open the "My Computer" on go to "Tools/Folder Options  2. Click on the "View" tab and you will see a window below that with the radial buttons and check marks.  3. Uncheck the box that reads "Hide Extensions for known file types" then click on Apply then OK.  4. Go view the file you downloaded on your desktop to see what extension it is using.    attachments can be pictures such as .jpg ot .gif.  It most likely is that the downloaded file is not associated to an application you may have on your PC already, or the you need to load an application that uses such a file.    You may need to go back to step "one" and click on the "file type" tab to associate the file to an application.    This may help you get started with getting your answer.
Z9seMtyhaa	perhaps, you need to download a driver for s-video from your hardware manufacturer, which is also compliant to Vista.  Any windows upgrade will cause driver incompatibility problem.|`|TRLRsNwWaa	Sorry, this is going to take some fiddling.    I had to right-click on the desktop and then left-click on "Properties" and then "settings" tab.    I had to click on the smaller monitor with a "2" in it to change it's properties ("1" is your proper computer monitor).    I had to reduce the screen resolution for "2" to 640 x 480 pixels.    I also had to left-click on "Advanced" then "Monitor" to reduce the refresh rate to 60Hz.    This got my computer picture displayed correctly on my TV finally!    The software for your particualt graphics card might have more settings you can tweak, or possibly a more elegant way of doing it. This method should get you up and running at least though!    Good luck!

F9Dw68KNaa	you could try reinstalling the program and then uninstall it|`|3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	Go to START, SETTINGS, CONTROL PANEL, ADD/REMOVE PROGRAMS, uninstall the program that way, then go to My COMPUTER, C, PROGRAM FILES, and delete any folders related to the program that may have been left behind.

AA11146651	Yes, very annoying!  What worked for us was to open IE to our homepage.  So, at this point there was a lot of desktop background showing.  Then, we dragged the sides and bottom of the window to full size; don't bother using the maximize button, it doesn't work for this purpose.  Then we closed IE7, reopened it and voila!    EDIT TO ANSWER:  Welll, I checked with my husband on this; he said my answer is only a temporary fix, here is the permanent fix:  Go to Start, All Programs, right click on Internet Explorer, select Properties, Shortcut tab.  Click the drop-down arrow next to Run and select Maximized, click Apply.|`|F9Dw68KNaa	open IE7, go to tools and put a check next to full screen|`|AA11214104	FIREFOX!!!

pP8Q4DWvaa	assuming you're also going to use the internet, you need to upgrade, consider a fios connection (verizon) great service. it all depends on compression the service is using, here is a calculator to determine the amount of lines you can have    http://www.erlang.com/calculator/lipb/    use you upstream not down to calculate, i put in your number of 512 and did it at worst case, your maximum lines is 5, so then add web traffic and you are out of bounds.you really want to give your self some headroom, most internet service providers offer a poor upstream, thats why i mentioned verizon fios, lowest package is a 5mbps up/ 2mbps down ($35ish), when computing against yours it allows for 20 lines, so that gives you room for internet use and phone use.    but then again this all depends on what the voip company is compressing at, I took the verizon voicewing test, this is my work internet and it told me I only had room for 2 lines, i'm at about the same speed as you.. link to the test:    https://www22.verizon.com/ForYourHome/VO...    vonage should have one as well, you just need to find it on their site, or call the company you want to have service with and ask them what they recommend, can't hurt :p|`|93c38977c00acf82e3cf6e549af30069aa	get to these links.
9afe3a188a59d0f7b559a228a45b925daa	I saw this question the other day and have worked out a spreadsheet that  should work for you.  It is pretty complex so I'm not sure if I can link it thru Yahoo answers or email it to you if you're interested.  The file size is 71 KB.  Used a lot of Vlookup formulas.  Had a great time solving the problem.  Let me know what you would like to do.|`|f1a2e6fef769da8ffdb1af509b66db3faa	I have helped a few people with excel but I haven't used it in some time.Click on tools and options you'll need to manually select the dates you want to perform these actions then enter them into the program yourself. There is a way of writing a formulation to recognize the random days you are looking for but it requires a lot of reading in the help section of excel.
pP8Q4DWvaa	dont have a toshiba, how i would do this:  okay connect everything, then right click you desktop, select properties, go to settings, set up the setting for s-video out.    oh yeah make sure the tv is set to s-video.    here is how tosibha wants this done:  http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/...  page 64 & 65    solution:  press fn + f5 and select the proper output, tv + lcd
raqMqXajaa	YES. Daily Mail, a news paper in United Kingdom reports    " Laptops are crippling millions with back problems".    it is known to have given Back, neck and repetitive strain injuries to the wrist (by placing the wrist to the edge of the laptop).    Solution: use a desktop or buy a docking station, which connects ur laptop to a monitor (and its totally immobile, irony)     hope this helps :)|`|83b0a2f37010047debb7c085a07c4589aa	if you hunch over them yeah.|`|dWM4EceSaa	simple answer NO !!! they are very good.|`|cDt3oBtHaa	It probably depends on the position you sit when you use them. Maybe it causes people to hunch over and that could cause back problems. My sophomore year in college I would always lay on the living room on my stomach when typing on my laptop and that started to hurt after awhile.|`|EpPpTvKWaa	No, poor posture and ergonomics will give you back problems.  Laptops themselves cannot do that.  Try using your laptop on a desk, table, or other surface where you will be able to work with the laptop in a properly supported position.

fd4d1cab288a24bfdab8fbc929a2ffb4aa	Maybe this won't help, but I am not sure why it is doing this. I have heard many people say that McAfee has messed up their systems.     I have never used it for that reason as well as I don't have alot of money, so I use free  programs and have never had a problem with computer bugs.    Just in case your interested, I use the following security software, all free:    AntiVirus-  AVG Anti Virus    AntiSpyware-  Windows Defender  SpySweeper (oops, I fibbed- that one I paid for! But it's worth it.)  Ad-Aware    Firewall-  I use the Windows Firewall (I know, shame on me!). But I have heard that ZoneAlarm is very good.|`|dBCPAz3Waa	I'm having the same issue, don't know what it is.  I'm still trying to figure it out. It has to do with their latest update because it was fine until that.    Once you hit contact support, or something like that, it lets you on. Now I'm trying to mess around with the add-ons.

Use the arrow keys to highlight "start in safe mode" and hit enter.     safe mode can take a long time to start up. be patient. when the desktop loads, use the system restore function to restore the computer to a point before the error occurred. you'll still probably get a lot of error message, just wade through them and run the restore.     if this does not work, you will have to restore the computer using the restore cd that come with the computer. 
AA12134591	The primary consideration should be... what general use you are going to be calling on this machine to perform and what you are expecting of it.  This will give you a base from which to work in "designing" a system that is going to be efficient and capable.  Next would be, of course, the budget that you have to work with.... and, just how deep you are going to be willing to go in this "investment"....    As your first responder has indicated.... the higher the RAM and HD capability the better.... and, if you want this machine to be Wii ready and capable of various add-ons    Be sure to stay with name brands that have good warranty and service plans... and, you should be a happy camper for the long haul !!

Warranty (e.g. 2 years)    5. Brand (good brand or crappy brand)    The higher the specificationsnumbers, the better and the higher the price. So you have to see the highest specifications your budget can afford.    Consideration for laptops:  1. Screen Size (what screen size would you be comfortable using, e.g. 13'', 15'', 17'', etc)    2. Battery Life (how long can you use the battery before needing to recharge)    3.

Just set the drive you took out to "slave" install it on the open plug on the IDE cable and then plug in the standard, 4-pin power connector.    That is all there is too it. You don't have to convert it or anything.      And it's "Voila!" not "Whalla".

8ca8be7f4582c735baa8ec960d2230c0aa	FIRST run these two on-line scanners in the order that they are listed:      http://support.f-secure.com/enu/home/ols...    And THEN:    http://www.pandasecurity.com/homeusers/s...    After you clean up what they find then UPDATE all of your on-board anti-malware arsenal.    DISCONNECT completely from the net while scanning with your on-board stuff.    Once your computer is squeaky clean, install a good SOFTWARE firewall on it before you re-connect to the net. I recommend Commodo http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/ in addition to the hardware firewall in your router. If you use a router, then you also need to get in there and change the password to it too.    If you don't have a security suite or other security software on your computer then you NEED to.    I suggest:    Spybot Search & Destroy    http://www.safer-networking.org/index2.h...    Ad-Aware    http://www.lavasoft.com/products/ad_awar...    And Avast AV    http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-...      So that will total up to be TWO ANTI-SPYWARE, ONE Anti-VIRUS, and a Software firewall in addition to the hardware firewall in your router if you have one. If you don't have a router with a firewall in it, you SHOULD.    I hope this helps. Good Luck!!!|`|ElvQTpUVaa	Reboot?  Don't you mean reformat?    That's a drastic idea - maybe you should consider installing some security software like Kapsersky or Avast for anti-virus, and Spybot or Adaware 2008 for spyware.    If you want to reformat, reboot with the xp CD in the drive.  If the PC doesn't boot off the CD, try re-starting in safe-mode.|`|iHqcToCaaa	my c0mpu too|`|fGUK6DKLaa	how about u download some anti virus software.|`|xQL7WWwiaa	Ok, here's what you do, go to a friends house with a writable cd and make sure they have internet and cd burner. Download any version of Knoppix and burn the iso image to the disc(look up iso burners). Put it into your cd drive and reboot. Make sure to boot off the cd. When it loads, go to the task bar at the bottom and click on the one right next to the house and type (without quotes) "sudo knoppix-installer". when the program starts, select your hard drive and after that loads, right click on the main partition (should say NTFS some where) and select format. Then commit. Reboot back into Knoppix and repeat the steps untill all partitions are formatted. Now put in your restore disc or WinXP install disc or what ever and go from there. Hope this helps|`|4Pk6VNftaa	You really want to wipe your hard drive and start from scratch.    Be sure to back up any data files - word documents, photos, videos, etc. before you go any further.  Also, make notes of any settings, like for your network, or other devices, so you can re-install them after the install.    Insert the XP CD, and reboot your computer.  Be sure you boot from the CD drive (may need to go into the BIOS to do this.)    Follow the directions on the CD.  When it asks about reformatting your hard drive, be sure to say YES.  Yes, this will wipe your drive out and reformat it.  ALL data and programs and settings will be erased!     When the OS is finished, get your network settings restored, and immediately go to Microsoft's website to download all the updates and security fixes.  DON'T GO ANYWHERE ELSE - you don't want to risk getting your machine infected again.    Once Microsoft is done updating your PC, go download some antivirus software, like Avast (www.avast.org) or AVG.  These are free and do a good job of keeping viruses off your machine.  Now go get some malware cleaning software, like ad-aware or spybot search & destroy.  These are also free, and should be run from time to time to make sure your PC is still clean of junk.    Finally, go download Firefox and only use this for your web browser.  Do not use IE - it has too many security problems.    Now go about re-installing your applications, update your drivers if you need to, and restore your documents.
4Pk6VNftaa	No.  MAC is only used for the lower level of the network stack.  Applications like Amazon and eBay don't deal with MAC addresses.    Even then, if you're behind a router, it won't be your computer's MAC that gets transmitted to your ISP's servers, but the MAC of your router.  From there your request goes through more routers.     Now, these sites CAN find out your IP address, or at least the IP address of your router that your PC is directly connected to.|`|pOrwteQUaa	they can track you by your IP address. So yes they Know some what of where you are.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	If they break down the TCP packets into tiny bits, they can probably find it. But it's meaningless, since it doesn't point to your physical location. Your IP address can get them closer to you than a MAC.    By the way, unless you're attempting to crack their servers, they are NOT looking at your data packets. They get billions of packets per day, and unless they detect you doing something nasty on their network, they are not going to peek into your packets.

Its just really a small file.. u can identify it by its suffix, .torrent - thats like (Internet Explorer.exe. - a suffix.) They are only a few kilobytes big/small but are very useful, if you want to download them, get a program (such as UTorrent) and go to a search engine and type in wat u want to download, personally i would use minitorrent.org, i think that wat its called.. also piratebay, etc..

btEpZn71aa	You should try to provide more context for your question.  I'm going to guess that you mean tabs in a browser or chat window, or something similar.    In that context, having multiple tabs is like having multiple windows open. With tabs, instead of many windows, they are all in one window, accessed by clicking the tabs.  It's a space-saving feature.    If that's not what you're talking about, ignore me.|`|k5KuYkkKaa	Here, you can see for yourself.  http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Tabb...  http://www.quickonlinetips.com/archives/...
m9pXE9Puaa	There is, but you will loose quality     .gif and .jpg shrink the picture down and the quality is lost. A .bmp allows it to be saved with quality but this means that the size of the file is big.    You could open the .gif file in Paint and save it as the format you need through the save as menu.     Your going to loose quality though by doing this. It is always best to save everything in a .bmp format and then save it to another format.|`|kSyiUxYSaa	Rename it for one. For example, right click your image and select rename........change the .gif or .bmp to .jpg or .jpeg    Gifs will end up with a checkerboard pattern around them most of the time when renamed to a .bmp or .jpeg.|`|zWqKuIQuaa	LOL renaming the file will not change the format.  To do this you will need to open it in any image editing software and save it as a bmp or jpg.  There are also free image conversion programs you can download.

f79a44bda7e4581623ca3e13cb6ad153aa	Random files work in any order including sequential. Sequential files are horribly inefficient because they have to spool back to the beginning and search from the start. However, NOBODY uses sequential files any more because magnetic tape has joined paper tape in computing history. Your lecturer needs to update your course curriculum.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	You probably mean a random ACCESS file.  You can access it in ANY order, including sequentially.    There's no such thing as a "sequential file".  If you mean something like a text file, only if you force fixed record lengths (which makes it a random access file).    You can read the entire file into memory at once, then you only have to scan data in memory, which is MUCH faster than scanning the file on disk.  Especially if you split it into an array - then it's almost like a random access file.  It takes almost no time to "access" the nth "record" (element of the array).  (See the second post in http://www.vbforums.com/showthread.php?t...    But you can't randomly access a file that doesn't have fixed record length.  The concept doesn't make sense - random access is calculated by position = (record length * record number).  If the record length is random, the position is too - you have no "place" to go to in the file.

beQolBQJaa	Mcfly, your ISP advertises the internet service using kbps and torrent programs show speed in kB/s, 1 kB/s = 8 kbps. If your measured speed is 740 kbps, the most your torrent client will show is around 90 kB/s and it is quite close to what you said you see (80). I believe you are not missing anything from your actual connection but a lot from your previous one if you actually had 600kB/s downloading (600 kB/s downloading means you had an internet speed close to 5MB before).  Hope it helps!
9gdJNTajaa	Hi there.  Look, if you have a VGA port (d-sub) on the back of the laptop you can use this cable, also microsoft  has a similar cable you could use.  The vga port on the back of your laptop should be blue, just stick one side of the cable into that and the other to the xbox360, also it gives you 2 cables for sound, a red and yellow, i dont know the technical term for the cables but its similar to the ones used in SCART for the back of the tv.  The point im trying to make is how are you going to have sound?  You have to use external speakers and plug in the two cords to the back of the speaker either directly or by converting it to a 3.5 mm jack (simillar to headphones).    Hope this helps ;)

You should not mess with the settings in F10 setup unless you know what you are doing.     It sounds like either your version of windows is corrupt, or your hard drive is failing/has major errors.     I would recommend you send it in for warranty repair, or if it is not under warranty, find someone you know (or a friend knows) that is actually good with computers to help diagnose it.

The quality of the uploaded video combined with individual viewers' bandwidth will determine if the video is displayed at "Higher Quality."    For best video quality, use the following settings:    mpeg4 or wmv  30 FPS  mp3 sound  640 by 480 resolution      --For best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/lyric/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.

RZQnxoF1aa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Download and run spybot|`|IGJGUfjNaa	There a several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.     3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.       4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.  Check your drivers.     5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly    http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...|`|wdVTFULHaa	How much memory do you have?

For example  was using ALT plus 1234. You must hold the ALT key the entire time you are punching the number you want.  Refer to the link for the number list and the corresponding character.    Another way to do this it to go to your start menu, find accessories and then system tools. Open up the Character Map and you can copy and paste the characters you desire.

GNeLxx6Caa	I know is a joke but, in reality this has been an issue for while in the computer world. A program would ask you to press any key and people would go crazy trying to find it among the many keys and key combos in the keyboard. An alternative solution was to ask the user to press the SPACEBAR which also cased many problems because not everybody knew what the spacebar was. Today is different because a lot of people are computer literate and also the study User Interface design has grown. That and we often use GUIs which have label buttons. Another source of confusion in the GUI world in windows is the fact that in order to shut down the computer you first have to click on the START BUTTON. However, windows have been around for so long that it has become tradition and it is understood that the START BUTTON doesn't refer to START something but more about where indexes of programs are usually stored.

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network.

Also there are differences in settings and other functions when using XP v. Vista. If you have XP definitely get SP3.|`|DydFQ0fcaa	Part 1.    You need to start by verifying computer & Workgroup names:  -click "My Computer", "Properties", then click on the "Computer Name" tab  -check the 1. computer name (must be unique across your network), 2. Workgroup (must be identical for all computers). *FYI the computer name and Workgroup are case sensitive*. If you need to change either of these, click "Change" to make the adjustments then a restart is required before the changes take affect.    Part 2.  Now you need to verify the network connections (im going to assume that all of the computers/printer are on a single subnet)    -Go to the control panel, click on "Network Connections". Now you should be able to see the network adapters. Right click on the one in use (either LAN or Wireless) and check the following properties: Verify items under "used by the connection" are there and the box is checked: 1. Client for Microsoft Networks  2. File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks  3. Internet Protocol (TCP/IP).  Now check to make sure NetBIOS is enabled by clicking on "Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) ---> "Properties".  Click the "General" tab then "Advanced". Click on the "WINS" tab. Under NetBIOS setting, click "Enable NetBIOS over TCP/IP". Now you can close the dialog boxes.    Now you need to verify the subnet  -Click Start--->Run, cmd and press "ok". now type this in:  ipconfig /all (there must be a space between ipconfig and /all) and check the subnet mask of each adapter    Next step is to verify the services needed to allow printer sharing  -Start->Run enter services.msc Scroll through service list to find then check  => Computer Browser  => TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper Service  => Event Log    To set a services Startup Type  => Rt click on service then Properties  => Set Startup Type = Automatic    After that's all finished, restart the computer(s) again and check for visibility.
dhXCEumpaa	To my understanding, you have a Wired modem. Now I had the same problem (game and everything) but it was on a wireless. What I did to fix it was getting a direct connection through the modem instead of the router but I also had a laptop at the time, so I can't help you with a PC. If that doesn't work, check your computer's connection on the desktop. An icon should be on the time side of navigator if you have Windows. That is just about all I have to say.

AVDTZ63Oaa	Because it is loading MORE.    Over time many programs that you use put little "helper" wares in to your startup folder or your system services folder. All of these things try to load on startup, even if you have no need for them.    You should use msconfig to remove all but the essential services from your startup folder, and everything non-Microsoft from services.   Start --> Run --type "msconfig" with no quotes..  Be careful not to remove the microsoft services. you can be sure of this by making sure the "Hide all Microsoft Services" button IS CHECKED before you disable everything.

Defragging puts all of the pieces needed to run your program in a close proximity to each other on the hard drive.|`|ntaiKOW8aa	Defrag is short for "Defragging" or "Defragmentation".  Essentially, when you save files on your hard drive, the OS places them in free space on your drive.  However, this free space isn't always continuous/contiguous, meaning that bits and pieces of a file can be placed in different locations on your hard drive, with the result being slower performance (as you can imagine) since any time you access that fragmented file, your hard drive has to do more work to get all of the pieces loaded into memory.    So, Defrag (or defragmenting), is basically just grabbing the pieces of files that are stored separately, and putting them together so that you will get faster performance from your computer.  When you run the Defrag function in Windows, it goes and looks for all such files and reorganizes the drive for optimal performance.    Hopefully that makes sense, let me know if I can clarify anything.|`|bLuFKxQNaa	Defragging puts fragmented files back together contiguously speeding up data access. This means your PC will run faster, with programs and files opening promptly without lags.  How to defrag-  If you are running XP, while using the built in tool, go to Start>Accessories>Systemtools>Diskdefrag... the drive do as the report suggests. Just ensure there is no power cut during the process.    If you are running Windows Vista, its designed to defrag on its own and doesnt show a graphic or fragmentation visuals.      The Windows program has limiations like minimum 15% free space needed for a defrag, requires to be run manually and you have to ensure no other programs are running during the defrag.    I recommend a better defrag program like Diskeeper, which is automatic and once installed do the job in the background without needing any manual intervention. You can go about your normal PC work without any hassles even when it works. It defrags even if you have less than 15% free space and is much faster. You can try the free 30 day trial version.|`|wiJz0FYLaa	Windows often splits up files into fragments when it writes to the drive. This is fragmentation and causes a decrease in performance.     A disk defragmenter collects file fragments from across the the disk and rearranges them contiguously to improve performance by speeding up access to the files. This process is called defragmentation or 'defrag'.    There are many different defraggers available; the best one is Diskeeper 2009. http://www.diskeeper.com   It has automatic defrag mode as well as manual defrag mode. Once you set Diskeeper on automatic defrag, you never again have to defrag your drives manually.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	No, there isn't.  SOMEONE has to pay for it - and that's you, one way or another.    (Some places will give you a free com domain, but then charge you $5/month more for hosting than other companies for the same hosting.  That's $60/year for the domain name - which is outrageous.  Others give you the domain name for free, but you have to sign up for 3 years, you get the domain name free for the first year, and pay around $20-$30/year for the next 2 years.  That's better, but paying $10/year for the domain name is still cheaper, especially if the first year is at a reduced rate to get your business.)|`|2LbTrlQnaa	http://www.officelive.com/

ebuxHnScaa	The header is marked 'SPK1' and is right near the SATA connectors. If you go from the SATA connectors to the edge of the motherboard, it's right there. It's just below the main power connector, next to the words "ATA133" that label the IDE connector. Pin 1 is furthest from the power connector, and pin 1 should get the red wire on your beeper. The black wire should be towards the main power connector.    If you have the manual, see pages 22 and 24.

9GLg9Mb5aa	When swapping out a motherboard, you must change everything. Well not "must" but STRONGLY STRONGLY recommended. How it interacts with your system is completely different. Physically you'll need to reconnect everything to it and depending on what you/it requires, new jumpers might be needed. Follow the manual and make sure to do a clean install of your operating system afterwards. Use the disks/cds that came with the mobo. Hope this helps, good luck!|`|jkG6tbseaa	You should not have to do anything to your bios. As for the OS, it depends on what OS you are loading. I am going to assume that you will be using windows and not a derivative of Linux. If it is XP, you may need to get some drivers for the motherboard and other hardware. If you are using Vista, it should install fine with all the necessary drivers and such. When you put in the disk, you will have to partition your drive. I recommend if you are using only one OS, you make one big main partition that fills up the drive. As for the jacks and pins, you will only just have to reconnect everything to your MB, in this field though, you may have to get some jumpers or different connectors to make it compatible. Hope this helps! If you have any more questions, just post them and I'll take a look.|`|4r904UJWaa	When you install a new motherboard make sure you go to the motherboard manufacturers web site and check the "specs" for that particular motherboard.  These "specs" will tell you what goes where (ie connector cables/wires to things like audio/power start,reset button/ front USB panel and other/s).  To find out what jumper settings you need for the hard drive then go to their web site and there you will find out the jumper settings (ie Master/slave/cable connect).  Are you going to be using a new case because if you aren't then you may have problems connecting all the cable/wires.   So make sure every thing is correct first and avoid problems.  Good luck

You could do worse than download VistaBootPRO which you can get here: http://www.toggle.com/lv/group/view/kl31...    I answered a similar question to this one about someone who couldn't get it working, and as it's quite a lengthy reply, I'll just put a link to that question in here.  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  Sorry for being lazy.  It's a really good and easy to use program, you can get it working regardless of which OS you install first.  Put the installer somewhere easy to find, then install XP.  Now don't panic when the system will only run XP, start XP, log on as the administrator then install and run this program, with the options described in my other post.  Use the download link I provided here, it's free. The link in the old post isn't.    EDIT:  It IS possible to install XP after Vista if you use this program.  I know it is because it's just how I sorted out mine and it's so easy to do.  No messing with BCDedit or command line options either.    EDIT:  Should you have any problems with the XP installer crashing due to not having SATA drivers then here's a link to another post where I describe how to make an installer disk with SATA drivers on it from the original.  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...   I hope you don't mind me posting links to other answers of mine, but this reply would be even longer otherwise.  Hope this helps.|`|ye1tS9a2aa	hold your horses everyone....the question > does dual boot slow down your comp   ANSWER > NO|`|7OIJn625aa	Running two operating systems side by side (techy term "Dual Boot") does not cause any performance loss. Only you should have enough disk space to host the two OSs. Each OS resides in their own space or partitions and each is unaware that the other exists. Needless to say that you can boot into only one of them at a time.  That being said, its not possible to install Windows XP, now that Windows Vista has been already installed. The reason is beacuse Vista uses a higher version boot loader than WinXP. So if you install WinXP now, it'll destroy the boot loader of Windows Vista. Thus you'll not be able to boot into the Vista OS. As a rule of thumb, if you plan to install more than one OS, install the oldest one first and then proceed towards installing the newer one.|`|6kC9me0baa	No, you will not notice any decrease in performance .  Their will however be an added delay when you turn on your computer. The computer will delay long enough for you to select which operating system you want to use. How long this delay is, however, is up to you.|`|AA11703028	hi there           no,dual booting has no effect on the speed of the operating systems installed           when you dual boot a pc or laptop the older of the operating systems needs to be installed first so in your case this means you will need to re-install windows vista and then install windows xp           also when installing windows you should allways choose a "advanced installation" as this allows you to select the destination of your windows installation            allthough dual booting may sound quite difficult its no harder than installing any version of windows on its own,the only things you need to remember are :   1. install the oldest version of windows first   2.allways choose "advanced installation"   3. each os requires its own security software(anti-virus,firewall ect)   4.you may use different file systems however if possible use ntfs on both installations        remember the above and you should not go far wrong,any problems let me know               good luck mate !

It might just be lingering in the search index - rather than actually existing.|`|jwurmVbVaa	its gone. no one will be able to open it. try restarting your computer and searching again. but vista may just keep a record of it.
RyvKws7Laa	The process you're trying to perform is called keying.  So you could do a search for that to maybe find something.    The big bad boy on the Windows side though is really likely Adobe After Effects.  It comes with a pre-built keyer called Keylight and you can install more into it (like Ultramatte, Primatte, etc.).  That is a professional grade option.  Its not cheap though ($1000) and it will take some work to learn how to use it.  There is a fully functional free trial though on the Adobe web site.    There is something like FXhome as well.  I'm not sure how good it is though.    http://fxhome.com/    You can also look up terms such as keyer, green screen keyer, or video compositing.  That might also help you find a good program.  I use Shake on the Mac/Linux, so don't know of any keyers on Windows besides After Effects.
AVDTZ63Oaa	It looks to me liek those clips are actually Captures from a VHS version of Disney's Peter Pan.

Probably Using Pinnacle Studio or something similar.

YVE64dJUaa	no    the number you see is a speed rating it how fast the RAM operates PC2-6400 RAM is also called DDR2-800 as it provides the equivalent of SD-RAM (which is now obsolete) operating at 800Mhz when the memory actually operates at 200Mhz and the bus speed is 400Mhz    more info:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR2_SDRAM    putting RAM that is rated at PC2-5300 will work just at a slower speed,  DDR2 RAM is universal in its fit for motherboards that support it and so the slower RAM will fit, the size of the actual RAM module is no different even for different capacity RAM modules it is the circuitry that is different and the size of the black oblongs on the modules (where the transistors are that make up the memory)    DDR RAM is not compatible with DDR2 and that is why DDR2 RAM has a notch on it to identify it as DDR2 RAM    hope this helps - feel free to email me for more help

Hope this helps.|`|M1bKnCuRaa	LimeWire itself is not illegal but downloading copyrighted files is. LimeWire is probably no less safe than any other peer-to-peer file sharing site.  There is no way to know if a file contains a virus or not, although if the size of an mp3 is only a few kb it likely contains a virus or spyware.    You really should not run your computer without anti-virus protection though.  There are free anti-virus programs such as Avast! or AVG.

The reason for this type of marketing is that it takes advantage of the already existing genuine interest in the 2012 subject related to the Maya Calendar.    Also connected to this are some other viral marketing activities on Twitter, Myspace, YouTube and via other Sony Corp owned websites.    The reason they are saying the world will end in 2012 is simply because that is the storyline of their film!
IuCT3TjGaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.    1. De-Fragmenting  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.   a) Right click of C Disk.   b) Click properties.   c) Click tools tab.   d) Click "Defragment now".   e) Click Defragment.    2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.    3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.   a) Open your Start menu.   b) Click Run   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.   f) Click "OK"    4. Check for Spyware and Adware  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.  Get the best one from: http://toptenantispywareviews.com to scan your pc    5. Clean your Registry  Microsoft Registry Problems = Slow Computer!

What kind of connection do you have and when are you using the internet?    Spyware and viruses can slow your system.  Use an antivirus and a spyware scanner (good spy ware scanners are adaware and spybot, found free on download.com).    Certain connections are slower than others.  The time of day can also play into the slowness.  Peak times are around noon and also after 4.  This can effect your browsing speed.    Try the scan first, and if that doesn't fix it try pushing your browsing time later.|`|4r904UJWaa	You need to tell us some things like how much Ram do you have and what type of processor and at what speed does it go (this will be something like 1.5GHz).

Norton is well known for being a great anti virus but also known as being responsible for slowing other applications (programs) down as it is resource draining.

VeLdDMbgaa	Assuming you are in Windows, the stuff relating to your profile is typically in     C:\Documents and Settings\[YOUR_USER_NAME]\Application Data\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\    This folder contains all kinds of stuff, like the stored form history, cookies, active download info, bookmarks, permissions, how to handle various filetypes on the web, and more. (you need a special editor for sqlite files, and for rdf files, and you'd need the firefox sourcecode to figure out how to read the .dat files).    The specific file for passwords is actually a text file, but the password stored is encrypted.

You may also want to look into getting another fan for the case, since stock fans are okay, but there can be more faster and powerful fans if you look at newegg.com or tigerdirect. Check you manual for case specifications. You may want to take it to a computer shop, and ask them to do some cable management.  Have a nice day  Ken

meysHMilaa	How to remove Antivirus 360 (Uninstall Instructions) What this programs does:    Antivirus 360 is a rogue anti-spyware program that uses false scan results and aggressive advertising in order to promote itself. This rogue is advertised by the Vundo Trojan and is replacing the Antivirus 2009 rogue program that Vundo has been aggressively advertising. If you are infected with the Vundo Trojan you will see a large amount of pop-ups stating that your computer is infected and that you should install Antivirus 360 in order to protect yourself. If you click on the ad, Antivirus 360 will be downloaded to your computer and you will be prompted to install it. Tools Needed for this fix:        * Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware  Press this link http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/malware-...    Or Download and Scan Use SmitFraudFix v2.392 (WinXP, Win2K) Press this link http://siri.geekstogo.com/SmitfraudFix.p...|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|UqJiXYhsaa	If you normally Google the name of the Virus, there's instructions to removing it.

7bd794308643a48ae46003172864a1f5aa	Most routers have a reset button which will reset everything to the default settings including the password.|`|IAeagNVvaa	1If you have forgotten your LinkSys router password, the easiest thing to do is to reset your router to the factory default settings.    To restore the router configuration to factory defaults, hold the reset button on the unit for 30 seconds.   Step2 Once your router is hard reset, you will need to login and reconfigure it again.    To reconfigure your LinkSys, connect a PC to one of it's Ethernet ports, load a web browser, and go to the URL http://192.168.1.1/. This will take you to a popup box which asks you to enter a username and password to login to your router.  LinkSys Default Password    On older LinkSys routers, the default username is blank and the default password is "admin." On newer Linksys routers, both the default username and the default password are set to "admin."    Once you are past the login screen, you are able to reconfigure the LinkSys router.  You want to go to the management tab and change the administrator password to something else to keep others from accessing your router.   Step3After changing the administrator password then you will need to enable WEP or WAP security so your nosy neighbors aren't tapping into your wireless network. I am picking up 4 networks with my pc antenna.    this only works if u have linksys if its cisco do this    Download a program called Putty from the first resource site below. PuTTY is a terminal emulator application which can act as a client for the SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw TCP computing protocols (Putty on Wikipedia).   Step2 Connect one end of the blue serial cable to the Cisco Router and the other to your computer. Open up the Putty program on your computer and select the radio button next to "serial" on the right-hand side of the start window. Click on the "Open" button in the bottom right-hand corner of the Putty start window to open the terminal.   Step3 Power the Cisco Router on. As soon as the router begins loading in the green and black Putty terminal window, press the "Ctrl" and "Break" keys simultaneously until its going into rommon mode.   Step4 Once in rommon mode, you have to change the configuration register number to make the router boot from a blank configuration file. For the 2800 series Cisco Routers, the command "confreq 0x2142", changing the register number to 2142, worked. Search on cisco.com for information on your particular Cisco Router Series.   Step5 Type the restart command in rommon mode, which is "reset". This will boot the router up again. When it is finished, you should be able to type "en" to get into enable mode without a password.   Step6 Once you change the running-config in RAM and save it to the startup-config in NVRAM, remember to change the configuration register number back to its default (usually 0x2102). This is important if you change anything on the running-config. Thanks for reading.|`|epm64G9Yaa	There should be a factory reset button that you need to push with a pin on most router models.  It wont be obvious, and you can find it easily if you have the user manual still.   If you don't, it should be at the bottom of a random pin-sized hole on the router.

Choose safe mode and hit enter. When you log in, log in as administrator if you can.    After that, navigate to the correct folder and try and delete the file. If that fails, press Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager, then click on the Processes tab.    From there, click the Image Name tab to sort by name and look for the file in the process list. if you find it, end the process, then delete the file. If you don't find it, then the next step is time-consuming, but should get you results:    Take the process names, one at a time, and start doing Google searches for them. Any process that get results talking about malware, end the task for that process, and continue down the list. When you've finished with the list, try again to delete the file.

The box will not let me type enough info.|`|HIUavkgNaa	I just spended all night figuring out this problem it happened to me, limewire frozed and when trying to select the file on windows became unresponsive. but after 6 hrs of research and trial error i found out it is actually the easiest thing in the world.   do this: open notepad and save the infected file name and save it, or if it is relatively easy to remember you can skip this step.  then you want to restart your computer on safe mode you have a split second to choose BOOT MODE when your computer is trying to restart and there is a very quick flash of a black screen witha white bar that fills very quick so you must be quik, this will shut down the trojan and allow you to have control over it and not the other way around.  after you logged in on safe mode all you need to do is locate the file you want to delete to do this go to search and type in the exact name of the infected file, locate the file, delete it, empty your trash bin and you are done.   now restart your computer on normal mode and rerun a scan you will not have anymore trojan,  note the file name may still be there but it is now dead you can click on it but it will say that file has been deleted and need to find proper location.|`|InAc3JhUaa	OMg that just happened to me.. my limewire just froze.. i cant do anything with it and 3 files have been affected|`|JnElq85taa	d

It would violate a lot of codes and perhaps laws. You should be fine if you keep everything private and be exceptionally careful about who your friends are. Of course, if you have nothing objectionable for them to see, this is all a moot point.    What businesses can do (through companies like Google) is run incredible searches that pick up any mention of their company, a product, an employee - whatever they want - nearly instantly. If you, say, wrote in a blog mentioning your company, they could read it the next day. I've seen this in action. Be careful, but you should be okay.

It's more of the question of how many "alarm" sounds and how frequent    It wouldn't have anything to do with the password|`|8RummmDaaa	Turn the volume down lol.|`|OHDXO5Dsaa	Was it an alarm or a beep sequence? If it was a beep sequence then you have a hardware issue.  Most likely your memory has gone bad or something.  I have never heard of a computer setting off an alarm like a syren.
wGLviOMPaa	It is certainly possible to break the connector on the end of the charging cord, or (happens more often) break the connector internally on the computer away from it's base, or the motherboard.     Now, if you haven't been abusing the laptop, or dropping it, or smashing the charging connector up against things, it could just be a faulty or loose connection.     If your laptop is in good shape, and you have a warranty on it, I would call them back and (politely) demand a fix for it.     If it's out of warranty, and/or abused, you need to pay to get it repaired, which should actually be pretty cheap in the scheme of things.|`|UqJiXYhsaa	Your laptop charger could stop working for a number of reasons, from the actual tip all the way down to the wire switch. A common reason for malfunctioning chargers are either adapter issues or wire issues (shorts, breaks in wire).    When you plug it in, try wiggling the tip inside the laptop to see if it starts to charge, also try at both ends of the adapter box as well. If it's possible, try and get a good working charger to see if it's the charger or your laptop.    If you got it in June 2008, you may have some warranties on your side. To check your HP warranty, go to the first link below.

If you are looking for free, I highly suggest you check out www.openoffice.org where you can find a free alternative office suite that still opens all of the microsoft (doc xls ppt) formats. I've used it for years and enjoyed it.|`|UqJiXYhsaa	You can download the trial from the link below. It gives you an option to buy. If you are not wanting to spend the money for Office products, I'd recommend OpenOffice.org which is also below. it's a little learning curve and a bit bulkier with resources, but it's by far the best alternative. (It also supports the new Office file formats)|`|XZdcCUN3aa	If your computer has it on it, you do not need a product key?? you have a trial period, then you can down load it from there site YES you pay for it.

Do NOT support piracy and put software programmers out of work. If you want to continue to use Office buy the licence like the rest of us upstanding, honest do-gooders - or go back to writing on stone tablets.    Predictable humour now. Yes (yawn), I can give you one, and you say you'll dearly love me. Nice.    Oh, sorry, product key was that??

MI8cUI5Zaa	If you have a modem then every computer connected to it, either wireless or by a wired connection will have the same "external" ip address. The roouter will then rout trafic going to that one ip address to the  correct pc. each pc will have its own internal ip address.    so if you external ip is 76.45.12.111 and your internal address is 192.168.1.101, when you open up a website on 192.168.1.101 the router tells the website to send information to 76.45.12.111, then the router says to send it to 192.168.1.101  so basically the concept is it routs trafic from one ip to multiple computers.    if you want more than one external ip address you will have to buy a second modem. These modems can be bought at a local walmart or best buy.  just hook up a cable splitter (if you have cable, or a phone line splitter if you have DSL) and hook the two wires into the two modems, then restart each modem, each modem should then have its own individual external IP address and you could hook routers up to your computers or to routers, then hook each computer(or set of comptuers if you have more than 2 computers) to the appropriate routers.    this will be your setup before:                                    | --> internal ip 1  external IP -> router --|  --> internal ip 2    this will be your setup after    external IP1 -> router --> internal IP   external IP2 -> router  --> internal IP       hope this helps. if you need more help contact helpdesk@odpoa.com|`|iGttaIAAaa	I would say that you don't buy IP addresses from your provider, but Internet services. If you would like to connect more that one computer to your internet, you will need to buy a router. To buy router you have two choices, wired router and wireless router depending on what you really need. Before you make your choice on that you need to know that most of the recent wireless router give you the option to hook more than 4 computers using wires.    I hope this will help you figure out what you need.|`|jkG6tbseaa	I assume you have a router with multiple Ethernet ports. When you connect your laptop to the router via Ethernet cable, it will pause for a second while it obtains an IP address, and then viola! You should be able to use the internet. NOTE: Be sure you have a router and not a switch, as a switch will not provide multiple IPs.

But here are some general things that you can check.    It may be that your system (mother) board failed, which could account for  a number of the symptoms you're describing.  Jiggling components while installing the card might have been the last straw.  If there is a problem with the mainboard itself, you're more or less out of luck until you replace it.  But do a couple of things first to see if you can bring your PC back to life.    Check that all cables and components inside the PC are tight.  Press down firmly (but not too firmly!) on the memory chips and CPU.  Check that all the cables, both data and power, are firmly plugged in.    I'm not familiar with this particular mainboard, does it have integrated video?  If so, remove the Nvidia 8600 and any other non-essential cards to see if you can at least get the system to POST.    If you can eventually get into the BIOS, see if you can revert all of the BIOS settings to the factory default.  There's usually a convenient way to do this, but it varies BIOS to BIOS.  Also, most motherboards have a switch or jumper that allows you to reset the BIOS directly.    None of this is really a "solution" but hopefully it will give you food for thought as you continue to work on the problem.|`|eCZ6YW4Paa	User error: replace user.

RyvKws7Laa	There's a slight chance that might work.  I don't know if there's any hardware of significant enough difference to make doing so much of an issue.  OS X should just redetect all the "upgraded" hardware on the first boot up.  I believe the main boards in them would be the same.    I'd make sure to back up all your files though, just incase something does go sideways on you.  But if you both have the same generation ones, he simply go one with a better processor and/or more ram, then I imagine you'll be just fine.|`|7x0aQJI8aa	I would advise strongly against taking apart your MacBook at all, and it takes some work to get the hard drive out.

You could then begin imaging each MacBook with the backup from the other machine.    Best of luck.

RyvKws7Laa	Warranty only covers defective or malfunctioning parts.  If you want to upgrade components you need to pay for those out of pocket.  And I'm not sure if the extended warranty will cover those new parts, you'd have to talk to Future Shop about their agreement.  Though as those parts will likely have a 1yr warranty anyway, their normal warranty and your extended one will likely expire at the same time, so won't make a huge difference.

Some sites also cap their upload speeds (meaning your download speeds) because they pay for bandwidth.     Although there could be something wrong on your end (diagnose with speed test websites) it could just be the sites you are attempting to download from.     The only speed you will get is whatever the slowest part of your connection to the site (or peer) can handle. If somewhere along the way, it bottlenecks, all the bandwidth in the world won't save you.|`|9ff50eac6fa480a892f8f42861f11968aa	40KB and 100KB are not that far off from one another. What type of connection do you have? It does not sound very fast to begin with. The type of file you are downloading, the number of people on your network, the time of day/day of the week, the website you're on, the file size - all of this can influence your download speed.
9FhrFiPbaa	It's possible the keyboard was damaged with the loss of power.  Do you have another usb slot to try?  You can try updating your drivers sure but there is no guarantee that will help either.  If you want to do that try using an automatic driver updater.  It will quickly identify your hardware and locate the proper drive for each device.  You can go to http://www.pcdriverupdate.com and get a free scan.  I recommend scanning your system at least once a month to make sure your driver stay up to date.  This will ensure your computer runs at peak performance and stability as well as maximizing your compatibility with software applications.  Using automatic updates will also prevent the possibility of downloading a virus or other malicious content to your computer.    I hope it helps.

(links on my profile)    Malware Removal Guide For 2009:  http://remove-malware.com/antimalware-to...|`|8ca8be7f4582c735baa8ec960d2230c0aa	Keep your Ad-Aware and Spybot Search & Destroy. They are both very good programs. Avast is the best free AV solution available today, so you want that if you don't have an AV prog or no longer like the one you have. You also need a good software firewall in addition to a hardware one like comes in many routers. If your router has no firewall then replace it with one that does. I your router does have a firewall then change the password. All router ship with the same exact  "factory" password which makes them so easy to get past. This is why it's a good idea to install a second layer of protection in software firewall in addition to the hardware one. Comodo Firewall is a good free one that you can get from here:    http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    That said, there are mal-wares out there that have the ability to infest and disable your on-board anti-malware arsenal rendering them useless.    Therefore, it is a good idea to scan with at least one, preferably two on-line anti-malware scanners to make sure your on-board arsenal is OK before using it to scan your computer. This way you lower the risk of getting "false negatives" from your on-board arsenal.    As another answerer explained, you DO want to re-set System Restore. By getting a clean restore point _after_ you've cleaned up the infestation that now inhabits your computer you won't be able to re-infect it with System Restore.    Here are the two On-Line anti-malware scanners that I have trusted for many years:    http://support.f-secure.com/enu/home/ols...    and    http://www.pandasecurity.com/homeusers/s...    After you've downloaded and SAVE *zip* files of any progs you may want to add for protection run those two on-line scanners IN the order listed. If/when they find something wrong clean it up. Then UPDATE your existing on-board arsenal and KEEP it that way. Run it at LEAST once a week. I run mine on my Windoze computer every time I put it on the net.    If you find a program that you want to try and have or will download and save a zip of it you will want to install that program or programs with NO other progs running in the back ground. It's best to install progs in Safe Mode, but if you can't for whatever reason it can be done by going into MSCONFIG to shut them off. If you need help with this then contact me through here and I'll step you through the procedure.    I hope this helps. Good Luck! :)
zJfknPdjaa	just about anything you get will do that. just make sure you have a dual core processor, 2gb of memory, and at least a 250gb hard drive.|`|hYpCWF5Laa	pc. 100gb of hardrive should be plenty
L8WUF4gaaa	Having a higher rated power won't hurt a thing.  A 750 watt power supply will supply UP TO 750 watts.  But the actual load is dependent upon your components, not the power supply.  If you have a video card that draws 200 watts of power, it will continue to do so no matter how large your power supply.  Look at it this way:    Say your system normally draws 250 watts, total. If you have a 250 watt power supply, it's maxed at 100%.      If you replace the power supply with a 750 watt unit, the new power supply will be utilized at 33%.      This should allow your system to run a bit more stably, since the power supply can better handle power requirement fluctuations in your system.  (for instance, when a hard drive spins up from sleeping, it initially draws more current as it gets going than what it uses steady-state)   And, you'll have capacity for upgrades in the future.|`|jwurmVbVaa	nope. and 750 is a nice Power supply.

If you don't want a pic seen of you then remove your tag (at the bottom of the pic there should be an option to do so)|`|txJRaVQcaa	There's a tab in facebook options when you upload  a photo called "customize".

KFagjt8Jaa	i always wanted to know how to make my eyelashes long without false eyelashes :-)    ok have been having a look at this problem if you click your username at the top and enter your profile    go to Channel Design make sure Featured Video is ticked and choose which video you would like peeps to see  it does not auto run but it is a bigger viewing window|`|zorYTX59aa	You have to be a YouTube "partner", which more-or-less means you are either  a film or video creator/producer/director, an artiste (musician/singer/comedian),  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance   (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission   (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).  http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject    But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:  -- You create your own "original" videos  -- You own all the copyrights concerned  -- The content is 100% yours, no income splitting if there's advertising revenue  -- You upload videos on a regular basis  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers  -- You are a resident in one of the 19 countries where YouTube has local sites  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.    Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination   of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied together can easily surpass  10,000 channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, something like 800   subscribers and 20 videos, or possibly 500 subbies along with at least 30 vids.    Once you've finally been "accredited" by the YouTube directors/administrators,  they will give you all the special tools and codes which will enable you to have:  -- a special "banner" for your profile page   -- a banner alongside every played video   -- your channel-page video on "autoplay" ?  -- automatic "high-def" to all your videos  -- extra "profile" and new "bulletin" boxes  -- "special" videos over 10 minutes long  -- custom skins/sizes for the video player  -- the light-bulb "watch at night" feature (for broadcasters)  -- the possibility of sharing in ad revenue  -- being at the very top of search results  -- a "More From" section which overrides the regular "Related Videos" section  and featuring only your uploaded videos.    If you wish to know more, go to the top righthand corner of any YouTube page,   click "Help" and then type in the searchbox the word "partner". Or click below:  http://www.google.com/support/youtube/bi...    I hope you find all my information helpful.|`|6fbce3ff42dd216a83c3e009ccebb0eeaa	Copy the url of the video you want play..

zJfknPdjaa	ok this is my opinion, so it may not be shared with others, but macs in general make me want to kill something. windows computers don't. also macs will always be more expensive than a comparable windows system.  yes, windows vista may have some problems, but they are nothing like the fury you will feel when you use a mac.|`|foCWBdpuaa	Ok.    Mac laptops last longer, work faster and have a much easier interface.   Window laptops don't last, go slow, and are very difficult to understand.    Mac comes with everything you need. It comes with a great photo app, calender, mail, dictionary, garage band, movie, and text apps.     Windows on the other hand, is just hard to learn. Doesn't really have any highlights. You have to buy all the softwares, and its just a hassle.    If you are basing them on prices, get the mac, because you are paying for quality. It will last and it will please you.

2SSA9e9Naa	Ah, you have a vista system. As far as the recovery drive is concerned that is ok. It is self monitor and will cleanup if it becomes too full.    C Drive, it is not very big in this day and age but it depends on how much you store on your computer. I have a 285 GB with 137 GB free but I store a lot of videos and pictures on my system. I also develop software and have about 6 serious games installed.    You have only used about 50% of C. If you've had your system for over a year I wouldn't be worried. You natural use probably won't use up all of the space.    I would monitor your usage of C and if it gets to less than 10 GB free consider getting a second drive. An external USB drive is a great solution these days.|`|IQZxdghGaa	well, recovery is just like tools to recover your computer to factory state, meaning you can do that and it will delete everything you added to it, files, music, pictures, all that and return it to as if you had just bought it. If you have the instalation disks you should delete it, since installing from disks is much better, it doesnt isntall all that useless trial software. You would have to format the whole thing to delete these partitions though
2SSA9e9Naa	This is the second time you've asked the same question. It was answered here:|`|bnCiNAQdaa	you only have 75 GB set up (partitioned) on your hard drive.  chances are you have much more "unpartitioned" space.  C: is your primary drive, and depending on what you really do, having 40% left may not be enough, unless you do nothing more than web surf.  the Recovery partition (D:) is used when you have to rebuild your PC.  companies do that instead of supplying any OEM/Install discs. you probably only have 6.92 MB out of 9:99GB left. there should be a recovery program built in on the PC, especially if its from HP or Dell.

vL2Ec50Yaa	When you want to purchase memory for your computer, type in the model number in google with the word memory after it (FX6800-01e  memory) and choose a seller to find out what ram comes with the unit and what they have for it.  I did that.    http://www.memoryx.net/gafx4.html    If you get the recommended ram it will not void your warranty.  If you have to take the machine back into Bestbuy... remove the extra ram!    Most machines don't come with stickers on the machines to show that you have opened up the case.  You should be allowed to open up any computer to 1) blow the dust out of it & 2) install additional ram.  Now how would the Geeksquad get into the machine without breaking the seal?|`|QmlkMK9Naa	Opening your computer voids the warranty.

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|jmq2i59Jaa	go to any manufacturer's web site and look there be aware of shipping charges

'If Button1 = true Then' will always evaluate to FALSE in your example because the default value for a boolean variable is FALSE and you haven't retrieved the value of the radio button and placed it into that variable.    Assuming your buttons are called 'radiobutton1', 'radiobutton2', etc., you can reference them and if they are checked directly:  If radioButton1.Checked Then    S = 0  Else if radioButton2.Checked Then    S = 2  End If

The little extra money will be worth it. Also, do you want to use Intel or AMD? Bear in mind that the readings on those are different... a 2.2ghz AMD is different than a 2.2ghz Intel.  You can build a gaming comp for that much easily, with a new monitor included.  I said what processor I recommend, I would also recommend a 9000 series GTX Nvidia card w/ at least 512mb of memory cache.  At least 4GB of RAM, 6 if you plan on running Vista.   If you want, you could also afford a new 19'' LCD monitor. I have a Hanns-G at home and I love it, LG and Sceptre are also amazing looking.  Also would recommend at least 500GB of hard drive space.

4rYDpMAgaa	Hello    There is a 3GB limit with XP 32bit.    Since you are receiving STOP errors, I suspect one of the Memory Modules are either incompatible or defective or the memory slot is defective.    Power off your Laptop.    Remove one 2 Gig module    Power up your Laptop.    Run it for a while and if it works OK, that memory module is OK.    Power down your Laptop and switch memory modules - using the same slot.    Power up your Laptop.    Run it for a while and if it works OK, that memory module is OK.    That module is OK    Power off your Laptop.    Now move the memory module into the other slot.    Power up your Laptop.    Run it for a while and if it works OK, that memory module is OK.    Power off your Laptop    Install both memory modules    Power up your Laptop.    Run it for a while and if it works OK, one of your modules were not connecting properly - you have cleaned the connectors.    It you receive the STOP errors, your the memory modules are not compatible with each other.  sometimes you have to purchase matched pairs to alleviate this problem.    better still, try returning one 2 GB module and get a 1 GB module - this may be better all around.

But, there is no way we can tell you for sure what laptop to buy as not many here are engineers.    My best suggestion to you would be to speak with your adviser at the college you are planning to attend. They will be able to refer you to an instructor who will have much better knowledge of the type of computing power you will need for your major.    Then, once you have the specifications that you will need as far as CPU speed, Memory and Graphical ability, you can then decide on a brand of laptop.    My suggestion there would be to choose a brand that has a local authorized warranty service center.

If you can open the drawer of the drive then its got power if the cable is on properly then its not that. Did you install any new hardware? if all else fails go into the device manager choose to uninstall the device and shut down and restart the computer see if that fixes the issue.

Make sure you have all the correct drivers and updates installed.    A common reason for that happening is that depending on the type of re-install you did, you may have a lot of bloatware that you previously took off. For instance, if you have an HP (might be Compaq if it's 8 years old) and you have the original restore disk, you might have reformatted your PC, but you might also have all kinds of software that run on startup which make your computer run slower. If you've had your PC for a while you may have made changes that stopped those programs from running on startup, or uninstalled them altogether. I would recommend ctrl+alt+del and see what processes are running and eating up your resources. An easy and laymans way of doing that is looking at your system tray in the bottom right to see what's running. A sleek machine will only have between 4-6 programs in that tray, if you have 10+, then that's your culprit.|`|wYN5F717aa	i would get a new one but if you want to save money try scanning your pc for cookies viruses and trojans my old computer was getting slower and slower to i found out it was just being terrized by viruses keyloggers and cookies go to www.download.com scroll down go to top 10 and find ad-adware and scan ur pc.

It works using the Gnutella Network, and it is free for public use. Through the network, you can share any file you wish from your family pictures last Christmas to your band's latest song. It will run on any computer platform from Windows to Linux, and many users say it allows them to post their content without the hassle of a website. The problem with LimeWire, though, is that it is often bundled with other programs, and many users don't realize that it has been installed on their systems. As a result, it can take up a massive amount of computer processing space, and it can also literally eat your network bandwidth for breakfast.     Is LimeWire Dangerous?    If you enjoy file sharing programs, LimeWire isn't a bad idea. If, however, you don't want other individuals to have access to your files, LimeWire is a truly bad idea. Not only will it slow your personal computer down, it will also destroy any meaningful internet experience that you want to have because your bandwidth will constantly be in demand by other LimeWire users downloading the files that you have posted. Some users have reported having the bulk of their allowable bandwidth consumed all day everyday by other LimeWire users.     LimeWire As a Security Risk    Using LimeWire and allowing others to connect to your computer presents a security risk to you. In order to use a filesharing network like LimeWire, you have to disable many of your defenses that protect you from other users. While others are not supposed to be able to see the information you don't post directly, crafty users will have no trouble accessing any material they want on your machine. From personal files to password and credit card information, it's all very available once you become a part of LimeWire. Whether you have a firewall on your computer or not, your security is at risk with a service like LimeWire. Indeed, one of the features LimeWire advertises on their own site is how easy it is to get through the firewalls of other users. More than any other filesharing program, though, LimeWire is particularly dangerous, as there are several security flaws within the network. You don't have to be a hacker to grab someone's financial data from the service, and with the rates of identity theft on the rise, it's best to protect yourself at all costs.     LimeWire and Questionable Content    Another problem with LimeWire is the content on their network. Lots of offensive material can be found through LimeWire which can present a risk if you have children, and if you don't scan the files you download from the filesharing program, you may end up with some very nasty viruses on your computer. LimeWire, and any given filesharing program on the internet today is packed full of spyware that can easily be transmitted to your computer, meaning that you could be in for some very serious issues if you're not paying close attention to what is happening on your computer.     LimeWire Removal    There are several ways to remove LimeWire from your computer. First, you can simply use the LimeWire uninstaller. Unlike many programs out there, it does come with a fairly friendly one. One of the problems  many users report with this, though, is that not all of the files are removed, and as a result, they are still at a security risk from other LimeWire users without ever knowing it. That leaves you with two other good options. First, you can manually uninstall LimeWire from your machine. Keep in mind, though, that missing a few files here and there can still pose a security risk to  your machine. You should also remember that any time you delete program files or work within your registry, you could be in danger of damaging your system. Your system registry is what makes your computer function, and making a mistake of a single keystroke while you're there will drastically change your computer's settings. Your other option is to use a good anti-spyware program to help remove Limewire. ParetoLogic is a great choice. Be sure to keep it updated on a regular basis, and try to run a scan about once a week to keep your computer safe from others. LimeWire certainly has the potential to damage your computer and pose a security risk to you and your personal data. Remove LimeWire today.

8ca8be7f4582c735baa8ec960d2230c0aa	You don't restore XP from the Registry. If you don't know what you're doing, messing in the Registry will cause you to have to re-install XP.    To do a System Restore you click on Start>Control Panel>Switch to Category View (if it's not already done, if it is the back ground will be blue)>then click on Performance and Maintenance>up in the Left corner you'll see where to click on System Restore>select Restore my computer to an earlier time>click on a BOLDED date when your computer worked correctly and allow it to do its thing.    WARNING: If you're doing this to try to get rid of mal-ware and/or virus DON'T!!!!! In that case the procedure is MUCH different.    In the case of a virus, the first thing to do is TURN OFF System Restore by right clicking My Computer>Properties>System Restore Tab>UNcheck the box next to "Turn off System Restore on all drives>exit and Reboot. The reason for this is that System Restore can Restore viral/mal-ware infestations if restored back to a time when the computer was infested.    Then use these on-line scanners to disinfect your system:    http://support.f-secure.com/enu/home/ols...    and     http://www.pandasecurity.com/homeusers/s...    in THAT order.    Then UPdate your on-board AV and other anti-malware programs. DISCONNECT from the net and run those progs while disconnected.    If you do not have AV and/or other anti-malware progs BEFORE running the on-line scanners download zips of:    Avast AV:    http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-...    Spybot Search & Destroy    http://www.safer-networking.org/en/home/...    Ad-Aware    http://www.lavasoft.com/products/ad_awar...    Comodo Firewall    http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Save zips to install withOUT all the programs in your Task Tray running. You'll want to be OFF the Internet while doing this. Once you have all the progs installed run ScanDisk and then Defrag. Connect to the Internet and IMMEDIATELY UPDATE the installed progs. Then KEEP them updated and use them at least weekly (I run scans on my Windows machine every time I put it on the internet).     After the computer is CLEAN go back and turn the System Restore back on. After turning on the System Restore again, it's best to go in and set a new restore point in System Restore basically the same way you Restore to a Previous time.    I hope this helps. Good Luck!|`|wFNXdj6gaa	You need to have exported your registry before virus, if you didn't try system restore, could help.  If you did, find it, and double click and allow it to replace entries, no need to go into registry|`|YVE64dJUaa	if you have a virus then use anti virus    i have avast  http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-...  provides really good protection for free    if you want to clear out the registry then use iobits advanced windows care    www.iobit.com/advancedwindowscareper.h...|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Use Start Run, cmd, enter.  Run Regedit.  Be sure to backup the registry first.  I would run Bitdefender's free online virus scanner and remover first.  Messing around with the registry when you don't know specifically what your doing will trash your software.|`|B2NeUMphaa	go to the run command and type: regedit.  be careful, if you mess a field up you can do much more damage, typically it is not a good idea to restore from the registry directly.
mOAY4FbJaa	You don't necessarily need to reinstall Windows, and in fact that should be your last resort as it will erase everything on your system.    Try some basic steps to repair your system first.  Since your system is not responding in normal mode, try Safe Mode: when restarting your system, begin tapping the F8 as soon as your keyboard lights flash.  You will come to a startup menu; arrow up to Safe Mode and press Enter.  Press Enter again when asked which operating system you want to start.  Choose the Administrator account at the Welcome screen; enter a password if prompted (it's typically the same as whatever password is assigned to your regular account; if you have no password, just press Enter).  Click Yes when asked if you want to continue in Safe Mode, then access the System Restore utility by going to Start-->All Programs-->Accessories-->System Tools-->System Restore.  You can use System Restore to revert to a time when your computer was working properly.  Your system will restart automatically and notify you if the restoration was successful or not.    If your system is unresponsive in even Safe Mode, you have a more serious corruption.  Go back to the F8 menu by restarting, and then choose Safe Mode with Command Prompt.  This will allow you to run System Restore from a text interface.  Type the following at the prompt:    %systemroot%\system32\restore\rstrui.e...    Yahoo! tends to chop that command off, so view the original source if you need to (linked below).  Just follow the System Restore Wizard to revert your computer back to an earlier, working configuration.    Assuming this all works, make sure that you are keeping your virus protection up-to-date.  If you don't have any or have an expired subscription, you can download the free version of AVG, which is a perfectly competent tool.  Make sure also that you have anti-spyware software such as Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, Spyware Terminator, and Ad-Aware Anniversary Edition.  Make sure to NOT enable their real-time shields if you already have such protection (through AVG, for example).  It's never good to run more than one real-time virus monitor at a time, so pick one and stick with it.  As an alternative to AVG, Spyware Terminator can be integrated with the Windows version of the free Clam AV; just turn on the protection and confirm it, and Spyware Terminator will download and install it for you.  With any anti-spyware tools, you must update their definitions and scan with them every week or two to make sure your system is still secure.    But if you are unable to use System Restore to revert your system back to a working configuration, you need to perform a repair installation of Windows.  Reconfigure your computer's BIOS to boot from the CD-ROM drive and insert your Windows disk.  When the prompt "Press any key to boot from CD" appears, quickly press Enter.  Accept the license agreement when it appears, then select to Repair your current installation.  Windows will go through the motions of reinstalling XP but will not delete your files.  Note that if this procedure works, you will need to reinstall all relevant Windows updates for your system; use the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer to help you with this: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/secur... .    If all else fails, at that point you should consider reinstalling Windows.  If there is any data on the hard drive that you need to preserve, you'll need to get some help in doing so as performing a full reinstallation of Windows will erase everything on your hard drive because you must delete the partition on your drive where Windows is installed.  What you'll likely need to do is have the hard drive placed into another working computer so that the data can be accessed and written to CD.  If you don't have anything you need to keep, however, just reboot from the Windows CD and skip the repair process.  You'll then be able to delete the partition and proceed with the installation.    I hope this helps.

For example, my dads blocked the movies websites. In most cases, this happens because you have very stong and high security on your computer. Sometimes when i use that website...the movies havent been updated my the person who downloaded it and it wont let me see it ( and error message comes up )  My dads if a company computer so if you have one of those it wont let you get on the website either.|`|qad8JFKYaa	Looks like they are having DNS issue's.

But if you want to use your mac also as a laptop, the Macbook Pro is GREAT! Just be sure to get the free printer that Apple gives out when you buy a new mac:  http://caantivirusreview.com/mac

If you use Win32 API you can create a GUI application (select a Windows Form project in Visual Studio). The command prompt application is called a console application.    It is slowly going the way of the Dodo but you can also create MFC programs which have more capability than basic Win32 C++ applications but less than C .    C++ is a good foundational language to learn because of it's wide spread uses.|`|jmpHkHnFaa	What is the purpose behind learning c++?

gQhKpI3gaa	i know this isn't a direct answer to your question but I do have 2 serious suggestions.     1 If you are planning on selling it to a informed group of people then you should look up the prices on newegg and mark them down by like 20% or more. Chances are if they know what they are getting they are just looking for something cheaper than the prices of the parts     2 If you are selling this to a uninformed group, buy a new case with lots of LED's or fix up your current one and make it looks new, Mark up the price and make sure they believe this is the most amazing piece of equipment that their grand-kids have ever set their eyes on.    Remember, the more aesthetically pleasing it looks, the better shot you have,  even if they don't look like they know a thing about computers make sure to throw in as many numbers as you can, the more numbers you give them, the more secure they feel in buying your machine, and lastly make sure they think they are getting a amazing deal, maybe go to the alienware page and find the most expensive computer or the one that matches your specs the most and then tell them how much of a savings they are getting.    so to reiterate,     1 New and Shiny   2 Lots of numbers   3 Great Deal    It cant hurt to advertise on sites like craigslist.org because the worst thing that can happen is nobody responds to you, unlike advertising it on ebay and just getting much lower than you expected.      so you can look at the individual prices on newegg to use as a base point if you plan on selling it for more or less.    If you do use this advice and it works or doesn't send me a email or IM and tell me how it went.    Confidence is the key, good luck man.

FTvkahKWaa	Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???

If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.    First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.  http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...    2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:    1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.  5. Click OK.    3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:    1. Open your Start menu.  2. Click Run  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab  5. Uncheck all programs that your are no longer using.  6. Click "OK"|`|IuCT3TjGaa	There are a several reasons why your computer is freezing/slow. First question is when the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.  Go to:http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... get one to free scan your pc    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.    3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.  Get the best one from: http://toptenantispywareviews.com to scan your computer.    4. That last area is a hardware driver. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestions and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing/speed up.  Check your drivers. Hope this helps.  Go to:http://toptenantispywareviews.com/RegCom... learn how to fix it.|`|DjGEJfaPaa	You may have spyware (you need to run anti-spyware in addition to your anti-virus). There are several other things you can do to increase the "speed" of your computer.     1) Clean up the disk. Uninstall unneeded programs (specifically those that run at startup and/or put something in the system tray), run Disk Cleanup, and defragment the drive. This is a good first step that will almost always take a few seconds off boot time and application loads for any computer.    2) Stomp auto-starting programs. Click Start > Run and type "msconfig" at the prompt. Click the Startup tab and look at all that junk that loads when you launch your PC. Do you really need "Adobe Reader Speed Launch"? Probably not. Turn off anything else that looks useless, but be careful not to disable your anti-virus and important system components.    3) Run a full anti-virus and anti-spyware scan. I would recommend AVG Free anti-virus, Malwarebytes and SUPERAntiSpyware remover. These programs are all free.    4) Clean up the registry. CCleaner, available at http://www.ccleaner.com is free and worth running. It will also remove unused files from your system - allowing Windows to run faster and freeing up valuable hard disk space.     Those are the easy and free things you can do. If your computer is still slow you need to move on to the bigger guns.    1) Upgrade RAM. This is the one killer trick that will make almost any computer run faster. With an older PC, you will rarely have enough RAM to run today's memory-hogging operating systems and applications, and adding a high-capacity stick or two of quality RAM will give you a quick speed boost. Adding RAM is fairly simple, even for a novice, and you should be able to do the job in 5 or 10 minutes.You can run a free test at http://www.crucial.com and find out what kind of RAM (memory) your computer needs.    2) Reinstall Windows. If the above tricks haven't helped, it may be time to wipe the slate clean and start again, reformatting your hard drive, reinstalling your applications, and restoring your data files from a backup. You'd be surprised how much more responsive a freshly reinstalled Windows system can be, as you've wiped out years of temp files, garbled registry entries, old versions of software programs that have been upgraded repeatedly, and all sorts of other electronic junk. Reinstalling is easy if you have the "recovery disk" that came with your PC, and only a bit more involved if you're using a retail copy of Windows XP. Just be sure you back up everything you want to take with you before you pull the trigger!     3) Upgrade your hard drive. This is a more complicated solution, but if you're reinstalling Windows (per the prior tip) you might consider upgrading to a bigger and possibly faster hard drive, too. Hard disk storage is a performance bottleneck on every machine, and magnetic disks degrade over time. Some performance issues could be caused by a failing hard drive, even, and upgrading to a new model could really put some zip back in your system. As a bonus, you can use the original hard drive for backups or occasional storage, if you put it in an enclosure.|`|9df38b700dfe10e31013cb976c1a3f45aa	I would contact you internet provider or and do a disk defragment.

wUqeZl3Saa	In order to make an automatic test generator, you would have to prepare the questions and answers in a fairly rigid format. Several of the standardized tests for various things use a test question bank and randomly select questions from the question bank.One such example is the test bank for the private pilot test that contains several hundred questions..    Or another possibility would be to arrange the questions and answers into a fixed size. With a simple randomizing routine, you could create as many unique tests as you wanted. Every student in a class could have a unique test and still have all the same questions.    These types of programs are fairly simple to make for multiple choice or true/false questions. You could even go as far as coding the answers so that grading them would not be a problem. With more work you could add other types of questions    I wouldn't doubt that some teachers may already have programs like this. The real question would be how well it might work for what you want to do. The important part is the data (questions) has to be in a format that a program can easily handle.    Shadow Wolf

The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.    There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.    Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network.

dVK7E5Kiaa	Hi, I suggest you use online faxing solutions. They are a GREEN choice because you don't waste paper and not to mention the headaches of paper jams, ink and paper expenses you have to bear with fax machines.    Also, did you know that a fax machine is the most energy consuming office machine? However, with online faxing you can send AND receive faxes 24/7 without increasing your electricity bill. Plus these services will give you a free local or toll free number among other features offered.    You should take advantage of their 30 day free trial where you can test drive their service and then see if it is what you need.    I made the switch over the online faxing last year and I've save thousands on electricity bills, paper and ink expenses. It is so much easier, if you know how to send an email then you know how to fax online.    Check out the source below, pick the service you want to try and take it for a test with their 30 day free trial! Hope this information helps!|`|WE1a2DUXaa	in your control panel it treats it as another printer!                                      ;-)

As for the going back to school deal, that's hard to judge.  With Jobs ill and their shares down, and the economy the way it is, Apple may not do such promotions this year.  You won't know for sure.      If you want a good deal on a Mac laptop though, go to Amazon or the Apple Refurbish store and pickup a last generation one.  They are being liquidated at good prices.

Disk Suite puts a range of tools at your fingertips to provide optimum system performance and improved stability and security.    Clean and Optimize  With Disk Suite you can safely Cleanup and Optimize your Windows? disks with a few simple mouse clicks. Disks can become bloated with temporary files, log files and other unnecessary data. The Cleanup and Optimize feature lets you safely remove unnecessary files and bloat from your PC without detailed knowledge of the Windows? file system. Removing bloat will not only make your PC perform better, but will also provide you with more free space to store your own files.    Disk Defrag  It's a fact that fragmented drives drain critical system resources, compromise the ability to access your files efficiently and slow down Windows? start-up.    Defragmentation is one of the best methods of boosting system performance by optimizing the way files are arranged on the disk. By reorganizing the files using the disk defrag feature, the process of accessing those files becomes more efficient, creates a greater amount of free space on the hard drive and allows you to use that space more effectively.    The defrag feature provides you with a powerful defragmentation tool that supports both NTFS and FAT file systems. Different levels of defragmentation are provided in case you just need a quick defrag or you want to schedule a complete optimization of your disk.    Backup & Restore  The Backup feature allows you to make copies of your data that can be restored in the event that files become lost, damaged or corrupted. Taking regular backup is one of the most important steps you can take to ensure you dont lose irreplaceable data and files such as photos, documents and other information.    The Backup feature in Disk Suite allows you to tailor the backup to meet your needs by selectively choosing the files to protect. It also allows you to restore files as needed, and verify your backup to ensure valuable data can be recovered as needed.    Diagnostics and Repair  Physical disk and file corruption is one of the main causes of data loss. The Repair feature allows you to actively monitor the health of your disk and file systems and where possible repair corruption and errors. It also allows you to schedule or directly run different types of disk integrity checks and identify future disk corruption so issues can be quickly discovered and resolved.    The repair feature performs integrity checks to check file system structure, surface scans to check for bad sectors and disk errors as well as repair hard drive problems. In addition the repair feature includes hard disk diagnostics and lets you review the information including the S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) status of your hard drive (if supported).    PC Tools Disk Suite Full Version Information  Current Version: 2009 (1.0.0.57)   File Size: 5,852 KB   Operating System: Designed for Windows? Vista? 32-bit, XP and 2000   Release Date: November 17, 2008   Designed to: Manage your disks for optimal performance and security.   Trial Limitations: The trial offers a 45-day unlimited trial of all features.|`|3oN9nkFqaa	If you uninstall plenty of software you downloaded or previously installed, but don't use them much, it might run better.

AA11314954	Your statements    if (current = NULL)    Should be    if (current == NULL)    Notice the double equals sign.  Your compiler should have warned you about doing an assignment inside an if statement.  Single equals sign is assignment.  Double equals is comparison.    What your incorrect statement is doing is assigning the value NULL to the variable current, then returning the NULL value to the if statement.  Since the NULL value equals 0, the if condition is false and the if block is not executed.  On the next iteration of the loop, current is NULL and you dereference a NULL pointer.    There are a few other minor problems, such as having head, tree and root variables.  This is confusing to someone else reading your code, as they all imply the same meaning.|`|2SSA9e9Naa	Looking at it I think C++ is saying it doesn't know what numb and this_number would contain because you are using cin to give them data.    As a simple test replace the cin >>this_number with this_number = 5 and see if that error goes away. If it does, that is the problem.      One thing you should know is cin is going to return ASCII data to you  if you type, for example, 15. If you look at this_number after the cin it will contain the value 4953 in memory, not 15. What you want to do is    unsigned char input[10];  cin >> input;  this_number = ATOI(input);    That will convert it from the ascii characters '1' '5' to the value 15.    Hope that helps.

The purported removal utility is spyware in itself.    Here's what you can do.  Usually, you cannot remove this type of software through Add/Remove Programs.  Instead, if you're running Windows ME/XP/Vista, try running the System Restore utility, which can revert your computer back to a configuration before you first ran into this.  Go to Start-->All Programs-->Accessories-->System Tools-->System Restore and follow the wizard.  Your system will restart automatically and tell you if the restoration was successful.    If for some reason this doesn't work or you get a message that the restoration was not successful, you will probably need to download some additional cleanup utilities.  These are all utilities I use myself and can vouch for as being safe, easy, and effective.  Go to http://www.download.com and look for Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, Spyware Terminator, and Ad-Aware Anniversary Edition.  Do NOT enable their real-time shields, however.  Update the definitions for each program and scan your system with EACH ONE.  Remove anything these utilities identify as harmful, then restart your system and scan with each one again.  When all three programs come up as clean, you should be fine.    If you do not have any real-time virus and spyware protection already, you have a few options after your system is clean.  I have read positive things about the newest version of Norton 360.  If you want some free alternatives, you can download AVG Free Edition or activate Spyware Terminator's real-time shield.  The advantage of Spyware Terminator's real-time protection is that it can be integrated with the Windows version of a free anti-virus program called Clam AV.  If you go this route, Spyware Terminator will download and install it for you; you don't have to do anything special except enable the protection.  Either of these options will give you decent system protection to help prevent reinfection.    Another good proactive measure is to make sure you have all of the Windows updates applicable for your system.  The Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer is a great utility for this: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/secur... .  And make sure your pop-up blocker is turned on in your browser if you have Internet Explorer 6 or above or pretty much any modern browser.  These tips should help get rid of your infection and prevent you from being affected again.    One last thing.  When you are absolutely certain your computer is working again, go into System Restore as outlined above and create a new restore point.  Name it whatever you want.  Now go into Disk Cleanup, which is also in the System Tools folder on the Start Menu.  Select to clean Drive C, then click the More Options tab within the program and delete all prior restore points.  This will erase any saved restore points that might contain the virus/spyware but will retain the restore point you just created.  Again, be sure not to do this until you are 100% certain your system is working as it should and well protected.    I hope this helps.

2LbTrlQnaa	LimeWire - A Needy Friend    LimeWire is a filesharing program. It works using the Gnutella Network, and it is free for public use. Through the network, you can share any file you wish from your family pictures last Christmas to your band's latest song. It will run on any computer platform from Windows to Linux, and many users say it allows them to post their content without the hassle of a website. The problem with LimeWire, though, is that it is often bundled with other programs, and many users don't realize that it has been installed on their systems. As a result, it can take up a massive amount of computer processing space, and it can also literally eat your network bandwidth for breakfast.     Is LimeWire Dangerous?    If you enjoy file sharing programs, LimeWire isn't a bad idea. If, however, you don't want other individuals to have access to your files, LimeWire is a truly bad idea. Not only will it slow your personal computer down, it will also destroy any meaningful internet experience that you want to have because your bandwidth will constantly be in demand by other LimeWire users downloading the files that you have posted. Some users have reported having the bulk of their allowable bandwidth consumed all day everyday by other LimeWire users.     LimeWire As a Security Risk    Using LimeWire and allowing others to connect to your computer presents a security risk to you. In order to use a filesharing network like LimeWire, you have to disable many of your defenses that protect you from other users. While others are not supposed to be able to see the information you don't post directly, crafty users will have no trouble accessing any material they want on your machine. From personal files to password and credit card information, it's all very available once you become a part of LimeWire. Whether you have a firewall on your computer or not, your security is at risk with a service like LimeWire. Indeed, one of the features LimeWire advertises on their own site is how easy it is to get through the firewalls of other users. More than any other filesharing program, though, LimeWire is particularly dangerous, as there are several security flaws within the network. You don't have to be a hacker to grab someone's financial data from the service, and with the rates of identity theft on the rise, it's best to protect yourself at all costs.     LimeWire and Questionable Content    Another problem with LimeWire is the content on their network. Lots of offensive material can be found through LimeWire which can present a risk if you have children, and if you don't scan the files you download from the filesharing program, you may end up with some very nasty viruses on your computer. LimeWire, and any given filesharing program on the internet today is packed full of spyware that can easily be transmitted to your computer, meaning that you could be in for some very serious issues if you're not paying close attention to what is happening on your computer.     LimeWire Removal    There are several ways to remove LimeWire from your computer. First, you can simply use the LimeWire uninstaller. Unlike many programs out there, it does come with a fairly friendly one. One of the problems many users report with this, though, is that not all of the files are removed, and as a result, they are still at a security risk from other LimeWire users without ever knowing it. That leaves you with two other good options. First, you can manually uninstall LimeWire from your machine. Keep in mind, though, that missing a few files here and there can still pose a security risk to your machine. You should also remember that any time you delete program files or work within your registry, you could be in danger of damaging your system. Your system registry is what makes your computer function, and making a mistake of a single keystroke while you're there will drastically change your computer's settings. Your other option is to use a good anti-spyware program to help remove Limewire. ParetoLogic is a great choice. Be sure to keep it updated on a regular basis, and try to run a scan about once a week to keep your computer safe from others. LimeWire certainly has the potential to damage your computer and pose a security risk to you and your personal data. Remove LimeWire today.|`|i0WQzVDZaa	Well you might have a software firewall that is blocking that port. Or a router. I suggest you be happy that it doesn't work because Lime wire is illegal well most of the content that you can download from it. Its also most of the time loaded with viruses and spyware.
3vx1oE7Zaa	Because sometimes quicklooking is just a little TOO quick.
eIg0Rvl1aa	My daughter had the SAME isse:  here is basically what we did to solve it.  Word of advice:  do  backup and also be sure you have a reliable spyware installed.  (edited spelling of reliable!!)    You need to turn off the user account controls.  There is a very lengthy artical here on them:  http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/libra...     But here are the steps:    Open Control Panel.    Under User Account and Family settings click on the "Add or remove user account".    Click on one of the user accounts, for example you can use the Guest account.    Under the user account click on the "Go to the main User Account page" link.    Under "Make changes to your user account" click on the "Change security settings" link.    In the "Turn on User Account Control (UAC) to make your computer more secure" click to unselect the "Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer". Click on the Ok button.    You will be prompted to reboot your computer. Do so when ready.    In order to re-enable UAC just select the above checkbox and reboot.    ~~  Long story short - by turning them off, you are then able to bypass the security that Vista has put in the operating system.  However the draw back to this is without a spyware/malware and antivirus running - you are potentially setting yourself up for disaster - in that the secutiry is then essentially gone.  You also of course will need Admin access on the system.  And... small side note.. if you are on a college campus - you will not get around the issue without disabling the user account controls.    Hope that helps!!|`|AygEpMMaaa	top left corner hit the tab that says file and then hit connect    if that fails there is ares and bearshare that are both free|`|rYxFKDy4aa	delete limewire completly, id say save your songs bu i can guarentee at least one of em is corruptin your pc in some way...at leas use frostwire...try learning how to download torrents and just use torrent sites to get your music...i.e just google ")name of song) torrent..alot better and faster with more ppl to download from|`|YCDS4Am8aa	i have the same exact problem!!!!!!!!!! it is getting me angry it hasnt been working for 2 weeks

714af23aaae71e5eebdb479c36d6cd86aa	When u download a file always scan it with a good antivirus program BEFORE u open it.I recommend ESET NOD32..It's top notch.    Try  http://www.downloads.nl for single mp3's    There's no reason for u not to have an antivirus.If u can't afford to pay for one,then download a free one and install it.    Hundreds of thousands of people use AVG free antivirus.  Download it here:    http://free.avg.com/    Before u do that,use a free online virus scanner like Trend Micro's Housecall.It will scan ur computer online without u having to install a program.It will tell you if ur computer is infected and what to do.It's safe.....it's the same company that hotmail uses to scan all e-mail and attachments for viruses.Then down load AVG free and install it.  update the virus database everyday.    http://housecall.trendmicro.com/    or......    go to ESET NOD 32 website and download and install their antivirus program.U can use it absolutely free for 30 days.Let it scan ur computer,I think u will be surprised at the viruses it finds.Delete them.    http://www.eset.com/    Hope that helps somewhat.    If u don't use an antivirus program it is not a question of IF u will get infected,only a question of WHEN.|`|AygEpMMaaa	just scan whatever u download with ur antivirus first and all will b ok|`|1vZ1n0agaa	no, ive gone to that site and i've done it plenty of times :)    i also use http://www.downloads.nl/local/en/mp3.htm... i dont know how i found it but they have what im looking for like 65% of the time so its all right    if your worried about a virus, it really does depend on what your downloading and ive downloaded literally thousands and ive never gotten a virus. if you're getting programs or something illegally, u should worry    you can get antivirus programs for free, some even come with your cable package. scanning is just when that program goes through your computer to check for a virus|`|BgzVBclBaa	no, i've downloaded a lot from that site!! & i haven't got any virus . if u dont hve an antivirus program, u must get 1 be4 u get surprised with all the lost data .|`|YG3DQLC0aa	hey i have been using kptunes for a while and i never ever caught any virus or spyware. i am happy the way it works and the best thing in kptunes is, there is no popups or an advertisement. they have the largest network and huge database with the best and good quality sound tracks. if you want to download music without catching any viruses then try http://www.kptunes.com where you will always find your favorite music from any artist you like. i used to use free site to download music but i ended up catching viruses so i had to dump my whole pc. i would say kptunes is the best and safest site i have ever seen.|`|BPZ4sGLnaa	Try this is the safest i know of.

7b1Wp6FWaa	Hi,    Since your only requirement is portability I'd say you should get a lighter smaller model then the one you have in mind. It'll also be cheaper. Unless you'd prefer a  larger screen size?    How bout this one?  http://www.dell.com/content/products/pro...    screen size: 12.1"  weight:   thickness:     A customer review says it's perfect for document reading. It's got pretty good reviews overall too.    Hope this helps! :]    [edit]   There's alot of prejudice against dell but the only complain I've got is poor service when it comes to repairs.    As for it running hot, I'm using a fujitsu lifebook and it's mighty hot on my lap too. I use a laptop base with a fan anyway cause I heard it's good to keep your laptop cool.    All in all, read through the customer reviews before buying. Search for it on amazon.com and read the reviews there too, if you think the dell site may be biased in any way.    [edit]  I just checked, amazon doesn't have dell inspiron mini 12 but it has mini 9.|`|lI7fMLy8aa	WOW!!! That's my computer lol. just got it for Christmas. Well I personally love it... It is a great computer in my opinion... granted I'm no computer expert but I'm on it alot writing my book.|`|xHI2QwOtaa	I say get a laptop. But if you do get a laptop DO NOT GET A DELL. They run great as a desktop, but for laptops, they get so hot that it will burn you if it's on your lap. I help maintain all the dells at my school, desktops and laptops. When we put the laptops on our laps, after about fifteen minutes we have to jump up and move the laptop because it burns our laps. And, they run really really slow, and we have xp, not vista. Trust me, if you know whats good for you, get a HP or other brand, not a Dell.

FBQZ06vraa	Not a problem.  We'll fix it by changing your global template.  NOTE:  THIS METHOD WILL NOT AFFECT ANY OTHER CHANGES YOU'VE MADE TO THE TEMPLATE.  Here's how:    In Word versions prior to Word 2007 (Vista):    1. Close all open copies of Word.  2. Open Word.  3. Click on the File->Save As menu item.  4. In the "File of Type" list box, scroll down to Document Templates and select it.  The directory should change and there should be a Normal.dot file in it.  DONT SAVE THE FILE.  Click Cancel instead.  5. Press CTRL/O.  6. Select Normal.dot.  Normal.dot should become your open document.  7. Now delete all the text in the document, including text in any headers and footers.  Pressing CTRL/A followed by the Delete key is the fastest way to do this.  8. Save the file with CTRL/S.  You may get a warning message about the Global template having been changed.  This is OK.  Click Yes.  9. Close Word.    In Word 2007:    1. Close all open copies of Word.  2. Open Word.  3. Click on the round Office button in the upper-left corner of the window.  4. Click Open.  5. Select Templates in the Favorite Links pane.  6. Select Normal.dotm or Normal.dotx. This should become your open document.  7. Now delete all the text in the document, including text in any headers and footers.  Pressing CTRL/A followed by the Delete key is the fastest way to do this.  8. Save the file with CTRL/S.  You may get a warning message about the Global template having been changed.  This is OK.  Click Yes.  9. Close Word.    Word sometimes leaves the last directory used incorrectly set, so the next time you open or save (especially!) a file, be careful that Word's pointed at the right place.    Hope that helps.

wGLviOMPaa	Honestly, if your computer can only hold 192MB of memory, you are throwing good money after bad by adding more RAM to it.     Spend your money on upgrading to a new computer. If you mess up windows, you can always reinstall......If you mess up the BIOS, you are going to a repair shop.|`|ytNlz3b7aa	Your BIOS have nothing to do with Windows or your operating system. It is the basic code burned into your computer's circuit board by the manufacturer.    Usually if you add memory to your computer it will automatically be recognized by your machine. I've never heard of having to update or re-flash the BIOS just for adding more system memory.
XlyLakYAaa	It is very difficult to remove audio tracks on a song that's already been mixed together.  Unfortunately most of those programs are very terrible at making Karaoke tracks.  The only thing they can do is use stereo phasing to remove the center channel of audio where the vocals usually lie.  This often results in a song of very poor quality that still has some vocals in it.    You can think of mixing music like mixing paint.  Once you mix red and blue to make purple, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to get the red separated from the purple.

e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	1. This is happening because your images are two different pixel resolutions. Before combining them, make them the same resolution and look at them at 100% magnification. Reduce the size of the larger image down to match the smaller one. Then combine.    2. To install patterns and brushes, place them in their respective folders within the Photoshop directory and restart Photoshop.    3. I don't have a great suggestion for you there.
e2104bb6f4cd0597228a673340a9a643aa	Video files don't compress very well. I doubt there's any solution that would reduce your file more than 10%. One option is to convert and/or re-render the file at a lower resolution, but it's not a practical solution. Your best option is to set up an account with one of the many free online storage sites, which usually provide at least 1GB of free storage, such as http://www.dropboks.com.|`|eIg0Rvl1aa	I would use winzip.  If it's not already on the computer - then you can download a free version from winzip.com.  It will be the fastest way and safest way in my opinion.    If you already have a zip utility.....then you should be able to right click on the file, you will see "Send To" - choose that and then Compressed (zip) file.     Compressing or zipping (it's the same thing different terminology) the file make no changes to it's integrity or resolution quality.

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.

oJLySPLMaa	Hi,    I assume you are using ActionScript 2, in that case do the following:    Open the document with the real content. Once there insert a Blank Key frame at the very beginning, so it makes space for the preloader frame.    Now open your preloader and copy the keyframe to the blank keyframe of the other document.     The result should be the following:    First Frame = Preloader  Second, Third... Frames = Real Content    Finally in your preloader you must have some code like this:    if ( loaded = total ) {  gotoAndStop (2)  }    Greetings

f9gcRmhGaa	You should keep in mind that those tests are conducted by professionals under optimum conditions. They don't have a hard drive full of applications, anti-virus, firewalls, and who knows what else running in the background, and many of the tests may be skewed in one direction or another due to a bias.    They also don't tell you how many times they ran the same test with some tweak or another to obtain the results published.  You should take all those published benchmarks with a grain of salt, as they are more for marketing and probably don't have your best interests at heart.    If the benchmark is published by your PC manufacture and is way off the mark, call tech support and call them to task on it.  Maybe you got a lemon.  It happens with PCs just like with cars.|`|XlyLakYAaa	Different benchmark settings.  Different "specs" somewhere (software installed on the computer, different motherboards, etc).

2SSA9e9Naa	I'm assuming you want a flowchart that gives you the largest of 3 numbers, A, B, C. Can't really do a flowchart in this response but here is the if statement you would use    if a > b  {      if a > c          a is largest      else            c is largest  }  else  {       if b > c         b is largest       else          c is largest  }    Top decision block would have A > B for true it would go to another  decision block "A > C", if false then it goes to decision block "B > C".    True/False outputs of the second decision blocks would give you the outputs A is largest, C is largest, B is largest, C is largest.    Hope that helps.

ruW3hrGSaa	Here's what I would do to diagnose:  1) Connect directly to your modem  2) Go to: www.speakeasy.net/speedtest  3) Check out those results and take note  4) Unplug power from both Modem and Router  5) Plug in modem and wait for all lights to be solid (at at least Data)  6) Ensure router is connected properly to modem and power on  7) Do the speed test again  8) If the results are the same, then there shouldn't be a problem. If not, then you need to configure your router properly. A crucial factor is manually inputting the DNS IP Address of your ISP. Also, check Wireless settings. Ensure that they are allowing ALL speeds, not just a select few. Your router is only as fast as your connection.

SgQa4zjTaa	Here's a macro that should do it. The macro will insert 16 rows between each row. It will only insert rows starting from where your selected cell is on down. It will not insert rows above the selected cell. It was intentionally set up this way in case you wanted to exclude some rows at the top of your sheet. If you are inserting rows between 1200 rows, it may take a few seconds.    Alt+F11 to open the VB editor  Insert\Module  Paste the code below in the edit window    Back in Excel, select the row where you want to start inserting blank rows and run the macro.    ------------    Sub Insert16()  '  ' Insert16 Macro  ' Macro recorded 2/2/2009  '  Dim r As Integer 'Last row in column  Dim NumRows As Integer 'Number of rows to insert  '  NumRows = 16  '  Application.ScreenUpdating = False  r = Cells(65536, ActiveCell.Column).End(xlUp).Row  For i = r To ActiveCell.Row Step -1  Range(Cells(i + 1, 1), Cells(i, 1).Offset(NumRows, 0)).EntireRow.Insert  Next i  Application.ScreenUpdating = True  '  End Sub|`|ossCVxPqaa	Excel has an easy to find "insert row" function. This works well because generally the user wants to insert a single row only. I do not know of any function that will allow you to insert 16 rows between each of 1200 existing rows - that is 19200 rows. The only way is the hard way. Insert the additional rows one by one - long job!!

The reasons might be:  1. Bugs in browser software. It happens with IE, Opera, and Mozilla depending on which version is used. So update your browser.  2. Corrupt Windows system files.  3. Malware infection. You didn't tell about your deskop security programs. Probably your are outdated or just not effective enough in protecting. You can run a free online virus cleaner to see if there are any infections. Almost all scanners allow to disinfect/remove detected malware.
SaeUxO6Gaa	Probably the most sql-standard friendly way of doing the insert is to just do an exists subquery in your where clause:    insert into collection_page (name, collection_id) values ("news page", 1) where not exists (select * from connection_page where name="news page" and collection_id = "1").    A lot of databases have implemented non-standard syntax to make this rather common operation easier.  For example, mysql has the 'ignore' keyword when inserting which ignores inserts that attempt to create an existing PK.    So assuming your table was keyed on name/id:  insert ignore into collection_table (name,collection_id) values ("name page", 1)    Insert statements will return the number of rows inserted.    Select statements return the table info you qask for... if you want to get the name of an existing id, it's just:  select name from collection_page where id = 1    Not sure if this is what you meant by 'all in one query' - but there isn't a way to conditionally insert AND get the name of the corresponding id in the same statement without wrapping two statements in a stored procedure.

x5fMSOFIaa	Sounds like you are getting your windows profiles mixed up with what is stored in your RAM. For the most part your window profiles stay on your hard drive and do not leave unless they are needed for some purpose. There are a couple things you can do to cut down the size of a windows profile: limit browser caches, lower the amount of space for temporary files, etc.     To lower the amount of RAM that is being used and to increase performance you should shut down any programs that start up when you turn on the computer. Many programs like to launch software updaters and quicklaunch software. Do: Start Menu > Run > MSConfig :: Select the "Startup" tab - Deslect any operations you do not want to launch when you start the computer. Be careful however! Some of these  programs actually help your computer, so to re-enable them, if needed, open up the MSConfig window again and re-checkmark those programs.

If you have an anti-virus, make sure it has the latest virus definitions and run a scan with it in Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking.  That often prevents malware from protecting itself.  If you dont have one, many people here swear by AVG (its free).     I suggest you also download Ad-Aware 2008 and Spybot S&D (theyre free), install them, update them and run them. If any of the above (or any anti-malware, for that matter) doesnt seem to be able to run properly or get rid of everything it reports finding, try running it again in Safe Mode.     Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.      To get into Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking:    1. Log out and reboot your machine.  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.  3. Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu.  4. Login.  If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password.  5. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.    6. When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.    Note that even if the anti-malware programs get rid of the malware, they may not be able to reverse the effects.  Search the Web for possible fixes.    Update and run everything regularly, not just when you think you already have malware.    Good luck.

Open Cell. In the menu on the top left go to Image -> Image size...    Check the Width, Height and Resolution of Cell. Memorize the numbers or write them down.    Do the same in the window with the better quality picture. change the resolution so it's the same and the width and height if the other image is significantly bigger.    If you want you can play with the filters now in the separate files. Add some grain to Good, but also add smoothing filters to Cell.    Now go to Good, click on the layer (bottom right), drag it onto Cell's window and place Good where you want it to be in the image.    Now you have two layers, Good and Cell. Make sure you're on Good's layer (it should be blue) and click on "add layer mask" which is a gray square with a white circle in it, right at the bottom of the layers toolbox.    Go to the paint bucket tool on the left-hand tool menu. (it might be set as "gradient" which will be an icon of a square gradually going from black to white, just right-click to switch to paint bucket) and colour your layer mask all back. Good should disappear. But don't worry, it's still there.    Next go to the eraser tool. Under the File menu you'll have brush options. Select a diffused brush (not a hard circle) at an appropriate pixel size - if you move the cursor over the image you'll see how big the brush is relative to the image and whether you need it bigger or smaller. You want the brush to be about a quarter to a third of the size of Good.    Also on your brush toolbar is opacity. bring this down to 7-15% depending on your patience.    MAKE SURE you are in the layer mask and not on Good (there will be a highlight around the second box in the layer)    Now comes the fun. Start erasing the area where Good disappeared. Erase carefully. It will be like magic eraser, Good will start showing up where you erase. The idea here is not to magic-erase it back to where it was, but just enough so it looks like it's supposed to be there.     You can play with brush shape and opacity to get your effect. If you work carefully you should be pretty happy with the results.

PQJyaFDXaa	First, I'm not convinced that it was ever working properly.  It took a million reseats of the card (para 1) and only worked once.  That means it's not a repeatable test.    Try a different (known good working) monitor if you have one available.  Make sure your original video card, onboard video and/or new video card work with anything.  Then you can test to be sure you're having a proper signal, then return to the suspect monitor.    Otherwise, your best bet is with the onboard video, if it is actually on in the BIOS.  If it was disabled, then it's not a good test.  At the very least, you should see the basic video signal during the power on self test (POST).    Edit:  I reread your first paragraph.  So if what you're saying is that the monitor worked before you added the memory, then take the new memory out, and return to the old memory configuration.  You might also have bad memory preventing the system from loading properly.  Not only return to 1G, but also try to use the same 1G memory card.  Could be the system doesn't support 3G; could be that the new memory is incompatible.

FBQZ06vraa	Deleting the directories the previous Answerer suggests could be disastrous, especially when you have a simple problem like this one.  Try this:    First, make sure youre in Print Layout view.    In Word versions prior to Word 2007 (Vista):    1.Click the View->Print Layout menu item.    In Word 2007:    1.Click on the View tab on the Ribbon.  2.Click the Print button all the way on the left.    If you're already in Print Layout view, I suspect you've accidentally turned off the inter-page display, which also turns off the headers and footers and the top and bottom margins.  Here's how to fix it:    1.Find the solid black line between the pages or at the top of the first page.    2.Click it with the cursor.  (Double-click in Word 2007 (Vista).)    That should bring things back the way you want them.

AA10900831	It has nothing to do with your pc or email program, in most case, it is probably due to email server problem, your email provider need to clean up their server and use the backup copy of the storage to restore all the emails for all users saved on server.  To cover all the emails stored at various time, they have to keep a few copies of backups, so when restore, some of your emails could be duplicated to avoid miss.  It's a good news that you receive multiple copies of same email rather than missing a email or 2, cause that proved they have a good disaster recovery plan when their hardware or software fail.  It should happen only once in a blue moon, and once the email downloaded to your pc, there shouldn't be anything left on the server when you log on through web mail.  Hope this helps.

hdTJ5Lpnaa	Avast 4.8  avira   but use only one anti virus  comodo firewall pro  malwarebytes anti-malware  SUPERAntispyware  ccleaner and mvregclean to clean your computer.  m  with this you get full protection|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Yes, I have had problems with AVG free and have replaced it, it may be free but it has many hiccups (errors).    One of these errors even made the news late last year on CNET, it advised to remove a key component of Windows causing those who did to lose the use of their Windows system.      Virus scanners suggestions:    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not. Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.     If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall (or don't want another Firewall) then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include Email, Malware, Spyware or Adware scanners so complement it by choosing from other suggestions on this page    Email scanner suggestions:    Spamdel: http://www.spamdel.com/    OR    Inbox: http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi...      Anti-Malware/Spyware/Adware scanners suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.      The rule of thumbs for security is to have a multi-layered protection approach !    So do not use more than one virus scanner on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one good cleaner, two or three Anti Adware/Spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each type for security.    You can only use one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one) but, if you have a router, you can also activate its built-in Firewall as they use different methods.      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|WWxGAzYgaa	I had similar problems when they upgraded to the new version.

Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.    I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then Norton or Mcafee.    Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  Comodo: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Why Avast is better then AVG:    On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from poison webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.

Anyway, try this:  on(release){  _root.gotoAndPlay("Scene 1", 1);  }    That might work... but if not do this (and it will work =D)    1. Go to the first frame of "Scene 1" and select it in the timeline.  2. Open the Properties panel and give it a frame name (a red flag will appear over the frame to show that it has a name.  If you add blank frames (not keyframes) after that you will be able to see the name as well.  3. Go back to your button and type:  on(release){  _root.gotoAndPlay("FrameName");  }    Have fun! =]

7vh5fOeRaa	You can't and it wouldn't be worth the cost...    Pentium II computers used a completely different socket type than the current processors, so it is not even possible to fit the current generation of processors into the motherboard of a Pentium II computer (the Pentium II used the Slot 1 connector, the current Pentiums use the LGA 775 socket).  Even if you could physically fit it, the firmware and chipset on that old Pentium II motherboard wouldn't support the newer processor.    The only thing you could do would be to entirely replace the motherboard in that computer... and once you go that far, it wouldn't be worth it to saddle the new motherboard with all the legacy hardware that is in your old computer.  For example, the memory on that old Pentium II would not work on the new motherboard... so you'd have to throw it away and buy new memory.  Odds are you have an older graphics card; your new motherboard would want a PCI-Express card.    By the time you finished replacing everything in the old computer, you'd pretty much have a brand new PC... and if you're going to go that far, it makes more sense to just buy a brand-new computer will all new equipment inside.  It'll probably cost less in the long run and will run MUCH better.    So,  unfortunately, you're kinda stuck with the processor you have.  Any modifications on that end aren't worth your time or the effort for a PC that is so old inside.    By the way... the Pentium II processor ended its run in 1999, so you are currently using a PC that is, at a minimum, 10 years old.  If you save up and upgrade to a new computer, even a modest one, you will be AMAZED at just how much faster the new equipment is...  a full replacement will be well worth it to you!|`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	You can't.    Well, actually you can, but you could only install a a different Pentium II processor and the fastest you will find is 450mhz which would not be a worthy upgrade.    Sorry.    Computer manufacturers come out with new technology all the time.  When they do, they have to design new ways to connect that new technology to the computer.    That is why you cannot upgrade any further than what you pretty much already are at.  Because anything faster uses a different socket.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	If (like me) you have no idea, ask a professional to do it because the processor is the brain of your computer and must be installed exactly right|`|61UL2ub9aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H8vZbW7ZN...

Open the case, locate a free port, insert card, locate red/white wire from sound card, or it may of come with the computer.      Locate CD or DVD drive, and locate the 4 pin interface that matches the one on the wire.  Connect CD/DVD drive to soundcard.

M0HTIeutaa	HA around $1000 for a non gaming pc? thats outrageous     I would say no more than $800 tops     I just built my own pc for a few hundred dollars and it runs great. my recommendation is to look for this in a computer    Intel Core 2 Duo      Around 4GB RAM or more  160GB or larger hard drive    Those are just some bare specs because you didn't say what exactly you are doing so its hard to pinpoint a price and recommendations       The comp I built cost me less than $300 for (Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB RAM, Nvidia GeForce 8600 GT, and that price included case, psu, mobo, (I waited for a lot of good sales and clearence + rebate prices)    If you want more info finding one or maybe even have me custom build you one my email is android6011@gmail.com|`|XlyLakYAaa	Around $1000.|`|2KfQYXaiaa	It really depends what you want out of it.  I can build a basic family computer for $300 from scratch.  A pre-built your looking at over $500 (USD) easy.|`|i0WQzVDZaa	Well it depends on what you want and if you already own a computer and are looking for an upgrade. I wouldn't suggest going to a retail store to get a computer. They are often not very well put together you may get it for a barging but you could run into trouble upgrading it down the road. Often those retail stores are unable to repair your computer on site and if you have to get it repaired they will need to send it away you will be without a computer for weeks. Also I've always had to replace parts like the power supply and system fans in no time from those computers. Goto a local computer store explain to them what you want I think it should cost you around 1000$. It will cost you more then the retail store but at least you can get service if you need it. Oh and talk to some friends if you goto the local shop for one if they got one from them see what the service was like first.  Take a computer geek with you too when you go that way they don't soak you into taking more then you really need.|`|f9gcRmhGaa	I'm guessing you don't know how to build your own PC, otherwise you wouldn't be asking this question...    The cost will depend greatly on what you want to accomplish and what software you need to be installed.  Do you need a new monitor, or can you still use an old one?  Do you require Microsoft Office, if so which combination of programs in the various packages...    When asking such a question you should provide a detailed summary of what you need to do, otherwise its speculation as to what it may cost.    Try this... go to Dell.com and use their "build" assistant to see exactly what you need, then shop around for other PCs with the same specs.  You'll be comparing apples to apples and will be able to make an informed decision.|`|aXBEb3raaa	About $600 for a good one, (if you know where to look)|`|GPUe13xXaa	If you need something for very basic applications such as Microsoft word, excel, quickbooks, etc. and simple internet usage then look into a compaq presario ($300 on sale) from a retailer or hp/compaq.  I read what these other guys are saying, but if you have read half of the questions on here you realize that stuff does happen and you'll be happy when you have at least a basic warranty.    I would not suggest building your own as it doesn't sound like you know what you need.      If you needed something to be more powerful to do the above, plus multimedia, some gaming with lots of storage check out newegg.com for retail machines.  You should be able to get a decent desktop for about $500-600.  A monitor should be cheap around $130 or so.    Good luck!|`|fCOq04lNaa	Really depends on what specs you want for it and whether you're going to build one or buy one off the shelf. If you just want a computer for regular use(word processing, web surfing, etc.) then $400-$500 is reasonable.

AVG paid is good(free is ok but its 6 month behind the paid). Keep the system up-to-date via microsoft.com or the update windows in the start menu.
a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	The problem is in the first line of your question.    "i rarely ever unplug it from the charger"    This is a VERY common problem with laptops. People don't realize how fragile the power jack actually is.     Anytime you move, bump the connector, trip over the cord you are putting stress on the connection which is nothing more than a piece of plastic with some metal contacts.    You will have to pay for someone to replace the power jack on the motherboard. It will not be covered by warranty since it is physical damage.    Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Sounds like a bad power jack, you will need to take it in|`|rSwce38saa	You could have possibly (not your fault, generally) fried the charger.    This can often happen if there are power surges during storms.     If you're still under warranty, just call up the manufacturer and politely ask them to send you another one.    --OR--    The charging port on your computer is fried. In that case, you'd probably need to have the whole computer repaired, because the port is hooked on the motherboard - so a technician will have to replace the whole thing (most likely). That is, if you don't know how to do it yourself.    But I suggest giving a call to the manu. anyway, see what they say.|`|7b1Wp6FWaa	I think the battery or charger or power jack may have overloaded.     Many people have told me this is impossible but it happened to my friend.     She brought it back to the place where she got the laptop.    If it's still under warranty they should fix it for free but try not to say too much about how you left the computer and charger on for too long.     Claim ignorance otherwise the shop may say it's your fault and so the warranty would be void cause technically the warranty's for manufacturing faults.    Hope this helps and all the best! :D|`|1fV8VZjLaa	might have broke the port on the computer or overheated the charger and need a new 1

effa79c5567a10463ae7886adc920f55aa	Scan your removable HD with the free version of http://superantispyware.com  This is a good program for removing WIN32 problems      Step1  Prevent viruses before you are attached. Download a reputable anti-virus to your PC or laptop. Program it to scan for viruses once or twice a day. This is the best way to prevent destructive viruses from creeping onto your computers and your external hard drive.  Step2  Connect your external hard drive to your PC or desktop. Most will plug into an empty USB port on your desktop or laptop computer. The other common way is through another piece of software, but newer computers will be compatible through the USB port.  Step3  Wait for your computer to recognize that your external hard drive has been connected. Most systems will populate a window that will tell you when a new piece of software has been plugged in.  Step4  Run your virus software on your desktop. Make sure you have an anti-virus software that will allow you to run a virus scan manually.  Step5  Open your computer icon on your desktop, and select the external hard drive. Most common anti-virus software will work very compatibly with an external hard drive. Leave the external hard drive plugged in during the entire scanning process. It may take a few minutes, but this is something your computer will do on its own.|`|tYLnug0raa	hey, i have the exact same problem, accept its not on any removable drive...its on my freaking C drive hahaha  ...i have not yet found the soultion but i am working on it and any help would be awsome
5zSSGKBpaa	1. Windows is not really free when you buy it preinstalled on a computer. Microsoft charges the computer vendor for the copy of windows (yes discounted) and the vendor passes on the charge. Some vendors will sell a computer without windows cheaper than the same computer with windows. And of course you get only a rescue cd and the license for that install does NOT allow you to install it on another computer if the computer you bought dies.  2. Then there are all the programs. How much does Office cost? video editing programs, excel, word, etc. Linux has comparable programs that do the same thing for free. All linux programs are free.  3. Linux does not have a problem with viruses and malware.  No anti-virus needed.  4. Linux is more stable. No need to reboot. Linux can easily go 8-10 months without rebooting.  5. Do windows users have problem trying to move their music to other computers and devices? No such problem  in Linux. No such thing as DRM.  If you are happy with windows you definitely should stay with windows. I don't think anyone who is happy with their OS should change.  Freedom of choice.|`|XlyLakYAaa	Actually, some netbooks come with Linux instead of Windows.    But Linux is good for some server applications as well as development applications.|`|pwkeo7tTaa	Some people just happen to like the flexibility and security of Linux.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Yeah, computers come with Windows, but sometimes people want to upgrade, and if they want to do that legally, they have to buy a copy of Windows. Or if you lose your restore discs it's a pain to get another copy of Windows and deal with activation keys and all that "genuine advantage" stuff.    Linux is no-fuss. You answer a few questions and get going. Office suite, music management, and web browser are all installed and ready to use. You don't have to search around the internet for software and wonder if its malware-laden or not. You just use the package manager to search for software, and it gets installed for you (no next-next-next-finish-reboot).    Customization is a lot easier, too.    Why don't you stop trolling and just try Linux for yourself? If you like it, use it. If you don't like it, stick with Windows. That's another great thing about Linux: you can try it out without affecting your hard drive.
YNoTqr0uaa	It sounds like the "Toshiba BIOS glitch of death"!!!!   Is it asking for a password and everything? If it is, contact them and they will pay a tech to flash the BIOS for you, even if it's out of warranty.  If you know the basics of computer design, I can tell you how to flash it.   If you want to do it yourself, Get a small screwdriver set ready and send me an email, and I'll  talk you through it.  I have two toshiba laptops, so  i've done this a few times.
nMYxyrzraa	Check the obvious first: Is your antivirus/firewall(or windows firewall) or antispyware blocking Quicktime? Do you get any error messages? Vista or XP? Did you have the required codec installed for that videostream ?     Try to Reset Internet Explorer Settings:  http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737/e...    Then make sure you have Quicktime turned on> Open Internet Explorer> Tools>Manage add-ons>  Enable or disable add-ons> Make sure QuickTime Object (QTPlugin.ocx) is Enabled    QuickTime uses a plug-in mechanism to display movies from your Web page in the user's browser.  Internet Explorer uses ActiveX which requires special html tag code to "call" the QuickTime browser plug-in.    Try this :  http://www.windowsreference.com/windows-...    Open the Quicktime Player>Edit>Preferences->QuickTime Preferences  Click on the Browser tab>Playback movies automatically should be checked>Next click on the MIME Settings button>  Under Video> make sure QuickTime Movie has a checkmark next to it> Click OK> then OK again     Info: The latest version should be QuickTime v7.60.92.0 Download for the stand alone installer: http://content.info.apple.com/QuickTime/...    Further you could always contact their support section for information and support. They also have a user forum which might be useful.|`|tI0rkxeuaa	Upgrade to IE8 - I run it and everything works really well.    Edit:  IE8 runs Quicktime people, obviously you have it set up wrong.|`|AA10700604	Hello emeraldejade,    If you still haven't been able to view Quicktime movies through IE, I guess that you could simply download the Quicktime movie to your PC and then view it locally through the Quicktime software.    Best of luck.    --Rick|`|2eb3b10f915c12af5f46e8e87c404752aa	Hmmmm, an Apple software won't run on a Microsoft product.Given the 100 questions every day I see here about iTunes and quicktime makes me think,Apple is either incompetent to create just one working software or it's just a lame try to sabotage the competitor platform
UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|XlyLakYAaa	Good for what?  Good for general use, sure.  Good for gaming?  Definitely not (the video card is crap)|`|1fV8VZjLaa	its alright i gguess    has horrible grafix card    no gud games would work|`|jmq2i59Jaa	good for school .but lousy for gaming|`|9vP0elUIaa	yeah, that is a pretty good computer|`|3FXJtjq6aa	vista 64 bit + bad gfx card = bad idea    note that the only reason that vista has actually been in 60% of the magazines is cause it enabled DX10|`|s8KonZc5aa	I really wouldnt recommend a 64-bit OS.  The only real benefit is that you can support more than 4 GB of RAM. For almost all purposes, 4 GB of RAM is plenty.    Besides that, a 64-bit OS is generally not as well supported as the 32-bit, therefore you will have some hardware and software compatibility issues.    Besides that, the laptop looks pretty good. Though the video card could be upgraded a little ( and by little I mean a lot).|`|AA10293734	It is a fine light computer. I would suggest only using it for surfing the web and saving work files though, as it doesn't have a gaming port, serial port, or parallel port, which means things that you can use it for, such as gaming, are limited. But, if you are aiming for saving money and an environmentally friendly computer, that is a good one. It also has average memory, so there is nothing to lose. It is also light and portable, and it has Vista already loaded and ready to go (Which is a big advantage if you need higher tech quality). Go for it, unless you need a heavy-duty laptop.
lmdhY6nraa	It's not a real website / group / organization thing. But a lot of people don't / won't know that. What it actually is is a viral marketing campaign for Roland Emmerich's upcoming film '2012'.    Here's the link to the IMDb site: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190080/  Here's the trailer for it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VXa82Auw...      Want proof?    At the very bottom, click on any of those small links: "Privacy Policy", "Terms of Service", or "California Privacy Rights". There will be a link that takes you to a page run by Sony Pictures saying that the site belongs to them. One more thing, watch the trailer for the movie and notice how the text displayed in the trailer pretty much matches up perfectly with that on the introduction to the website.|`|slPz66EIaa	In Preparation for the New Movie '2012', Subliminal Advertising Hits the Internet, Including New IHC Website  The Institute for Human Continuity now has a web-site up to protect us from the end of times.
