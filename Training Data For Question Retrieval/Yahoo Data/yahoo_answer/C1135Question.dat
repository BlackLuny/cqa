20090203134531AApyhMo	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Used to dress pretty bad, now i dress different but it feels weird?	Beginning of last year I was pretty sloppy, didnt wear deodarant too often, super cheat clothes, old shirts, ripped jeans, ugly shoes etc. Wasnt too kept-up.      So then last christmas I began reforming. I bought some nice clothes, got some nice cologne for my bday, started shaving, got cleaner, etc.      Over the course of the year i've progressed even more. Now, i've got expensive shoes, expensive jeans (which are more in style), my shirts are all pretty much designer, or more expensive ones (not necessarily expensive, but all well known companies and altogether better quality then i used to have), i wear cologne or deodarant, and do my hair everyday into a kind of fauxhawk.      Thats good right, i went from being sloppy to nice and kept up right. But now i feel kinda weird, cause a lot of the people at my school are like i was before, well not completely but old worn in shirts, old shoes, ripped jeans etc. So i kinda went from below them and now i'm above them, like i'm one of the only ppl in class that looks intensly kept up now. Should i tone it down or no?

20080706145920AAcARYw	Beauty & Style;Hair	Camping this weekend with MY hair. =/?	Ok, im going to Girlscout camp I think Saturday or Sunday. Anyway, I have horrible hair and the camp just has a time for you to shower. They only give us maybe 25 minutes, and you have to wait for showers so you dont get much time at all. My hair is sholder length when wet and if I let it air dry it gets extremly frizzy, poofy, wavy, and when we do the camps activitys I will sweat and my hair sticks to the side of my face. Its a mess. Usually I straighten my hair but I cant really do that. So I was thinking of a messy bun. When I do a messy bun I use a curling mousse to make my hair even more curly, but the thing is that we take showers at night. I have to also sleep that night and make sure it is fine and not real frizzy for the next day. Can you please help. Or do you have any other ideas for camp hair?

Its on & off again kind of situation, were kinda like the players of the school.....so were always afraid to commit.   We both got made at eachother over all this & decided to give it up.   But now in two weeks were going out again on a date & its been about a year or so since we've go out together someplace.   Keep in mind we were on & off again....but theres just something about him I can't keep away its the same with him.   But he's changed he's still a sweet talking player, but he wants to really find the one now I believe.   I'm afraid that since we haven't been around eachother while were at dinner there will be an akward silence;; and since I have the potential to be shy, I want him to see the fun & sexy side of me again.   So how guys and girls would you suggest I get his attention again, what can we talk about at dinner, && what are some cute flirty moves I can make that will have him thinking about me after dinner?

20090225014133AAWUAsF	Beauty & Style;Skin & Body;Other - Skin & Body	Splitting my tongue... just F***ing read it?	So I am trying to find a  reputable arist who splits tongue's. But the catch is, I don't want to do mine all the way. I have my tongue pierced and gauged now to a size 2. I want it AT LEAST to a 7/16. But here is the problem. I have had my 2 in for about 8 months now, and I tried 2 months ago to stretch it at a shop.. It would not go through.. My friend who is a reputable piercer was the one trying it and said if he actually pushed harder and forced it through it would have split my tongue and ruined the whole thing. Also told me that my tongue probably not stretch past what I have and I'm stuck at the 2... That's no good enough for me.. I want it bigger.. So I sat and thought for a while how I can do it.. Then I thought about tongue splitting.. I've seen it done through the middle of the tongue before (from a previously pierced tongue) but it always was the whole tongue.. I have searched for quite a while and have not found anything about just splitting the tongue enough just to fit a larger gauge in. SOOO... I am looking for someone (reputable) who is up for the challenge. I am aware that custom jewelry is probably necessary for this procedure. But I'm willing... So my question is, do you know anyone that would be up to talking to me at least about that challenge. I have never found anything like this done before so I know it at least isn't common. But also possible never done before. Though I wont take anyone who is not reputable. My definition of that is simply someone who can show me that they do good work (years of experience and photos/videos to prove it if possible) and care about what they are doing. I don't expect many responses to this at all.. But even if I can get one that helps me in my quest. It's worth it.. thank you for your time either way... But if you read the whole thing and you don't know anyone.. Feel free to make a random smart a** remark... But for F*ck sake it better make me laugh

OH and what should i do for party favors?? i was thinking personalized candy bars, like where the wrapper would be pink and say "happy birthday abby...etc." is that a good idea?      thanks in advance!      xoxox   habby25      PS- i know this is the wrong section, but i thought i would get more answers in this section. :-)
