20090305051834AAV3PB5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	What do you think about the novel Martha Peake?	Has anybody read a gothic novel Martha Peake by Patrick McGrath?   I have just finished it. In the beginning nearly up to 20 pages I was regretting for wasting my money on this book. Since its written in such a difficult language and me, being non-native speaker, could not follow it well. But slowly I started getting interest in it. Now I have a feeling that I have read a novel that is written in significantly different style and its really a very nice book about American revolution written with keeping Martha and Harry at central point.    I will be glad if you share your views with me. Was your experience similar to that of mine?

A Bad Dream      When midnight stalks the darkened hall   with shadowed stealth and stockinged feet,   an apparition slips inside   and stands where death and darkness meet.      A ghoulish prince with hooded veil,   who cloaks intent with slitted eye..   descends the stairs without a sound,   an icy draft when he floats by.      You toss and turn in fitful sleep,   what nightmare this that steal your dreams?   Awake with sweat upon your brow,   and silent terror in your screams.      With widened eyes you search the dark   and fear to look beneath the bed,   for surely nothing lurks but thoughts   of childish stories in your head?

I admit that I love Twilight but I still think people are making too big of a deal out of it, there are other books to read.  I sometimes do want to hate the series because that is all that is on Yahoo answers for questions, and that is the book that all your friends are reading and talking about so you can't talk about other books you have read or other movies you have seen?

20090305061802AAC7nVB	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	Is the LDK Shortest easier to understand than the LDK Short version?	Some people have said that the LDK Short version is still a looot of information and hard to understand. The Shortest is about as condensed as a means for building a self-directed great life can be.   Life Decryption Key-Shortest   By Generalist 02-09       Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.   The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.      This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true.       Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.      Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.      Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is.       The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life.       This formulation serves as a life decryption key.   Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy. It works best when conducted together with other people, who are also trying to have great lives by training their mind-heart-bodies by using the LDK.       Source:    http://www.sgi-usa.org.  Or    http://www.SGI.org      Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key. That term is my attempt to summarize the essence of the philosophy taught by SGI.

Eh-and no one dare try and mention Twilight-neither as a praise nor a mock of it.      Or is it all concluded as a fact that mere words on a paper have no drastic effects that may change one's life--being nothing more than simple words.

I have two and a lot of people like them both.      I'll post both 1 & 2 and you guys vote! :DD      Poem 1:      Her eyes shine   As cold as stone   Her heart burns with a fire.      To see her again    Her best friend   Is her one desire.      She lost her when she was young   Not much older than ten.   She only wants to see   Her sweet mother again.      On longer days in her bedroom   She wishes you could see   All the proof she's gathered for   "Mommy's here with me."      It hard for her to explain   What she goes through everyday.   It's hard for you to notice   That she goes through so much pain.      Her mom was so dear   She loved her so much   Having a friend beside her   is her only crutch.      Until that day on her death bed   she mourned her mother, you see   "There's mom with the angels," She'd say.   "There they are, coming for me."         Poem 2:      Wind in my hair   Song in my soul   My mother's life   Is based on Rock and Roll.      Going to parties   having some drinks   My mom doesn't think   About anything      My mom doesn't see    That I cry at night   Wondering when    She might lose her life      The damage has been done   I've tried what I could   The fight can't be won   It's not understood      She's lost all she has   In a sea of dreams   Trying to become   What's not meant to be.               Please vote!! :DD I'll appreciate each and every one!

20090305072730AAokNtJ	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Please read my poem!?	Alissa Norfolk   Mrs. Nawrocki   English Period B   05 March 2009   “Absence Makes the Heart Grow Fonder”      It was early autumn, September of 2007,   And my life was great, just like heaven.   My grades were great, my family thrived,   With everyone’s health, I knew we’d all survive.   We planned a trip as a family, to visit the king.   I was looking so forward to it, I didn’t know what to bring!   I couldn’t wait to see Elvis’ house; it’s such a sight to see,   And my dad bought a brand new, huge RV!      My Grandmother later got sick; she didn’t feel very well.   I thought, another infection, no need to say ‘farewell’.   My dad brought her do the doctor, afraid of the word “cancer,”   We never saw it coming; I knew that couldn’t be the answer.   But weeks went by, and she got worse and worse,   Then every day a stranger would visit her, she’s was a hospice nurse?   It was like my Grandma lost her love   She was sick, but I knew she would soon leave us and go above.      I remember the day it happened, I was at mass,   My father was late picking me up; I thought I’ll just go to a CCD class.    It was one hour later, and I finally called home,   “I’ll be right there, are you alone”?    My brother arrived a little while later, with tears in his eyes,   As I got into the car, I knew something was wrong when he started to cry.   “Alissa, we have to be strong, and not fight anymore”   Then I started to think, ‘oh my God’ she can’t be gone, I’m only a sophomore!      My grandmother was always my hero, my idol.   But it is okay now, because she is an angel.   With everyday that goes by, I learn that I love her more and more,   But what can I do, she was the glue to our family, our amor.   So when someone tells you “Absence makes the heart grow fonder”   Stay with your loved ones, and be sure to never wander.                                            Please feel free to edit it,   and yes, this is a true story. Any suggestions would be appreciated! :)

Great Mother, Divinity of the Earth      In the beginning, there was Chaos:   Void, Darkness, Masses, and Confusion.   All was silent, bare, and motionless,   Stark Empty, no tree of life with boughs.      No grass grew on the majestic plains;   tress did not wave their leafy branches.   No birds sang songs or flew through the air   In valleys, no flowers grew, no rains      Then came Gaea out of Chaos, pars.   At the dawn of creation, she rose,   Creating the Universe, made whole   seas, air, and the skies: sun, moon, and stars.

Before you start to write your sonnet down,   a little help with rhythm may well aid   One kick, the horse began to trot around   with alternating stress, the tune it played      Impelling us and telling us the gate   The rise and then the fall within the beat   The chorus of the carousel will wait   for us to match the hooves with metered feet      dee DA dee DA indeed, we did agree   Such emphasis would take us round the ring   a lolling rolling rigmarole for me   to syncopate the words until they sing      But unlike on a real horse, I must beg   tis better to bounce on the Inside leg.
20090305084141AARZaCg	Arts & Humanities;Philosophy	What if relativism were true wouldn't that lead to Anrachy ? see Below ?	Let me use this illustration to demonstrate it.      The setting: A thief is casing a jewelry store so he can rob it. He has entered it to check out any visible alarm settings, locks, layout, etc. In the process, he has unexpectedly gotten involved in a discussion with the owner of the jewelry store whose hobby is the study of philosophy and believes that truth and morals are relative.      "So," says the owner, "everything is relative.  That is why I believe that all morals are not absolute and that right and wrong is up to the individual to determine within the confines of society. But there is no absolute right and wrong."   "That is a very interesting perspective," says the thief. "I was brought up believing that there was a God and that there was right and wrong. But I abandoned all of that and I agree with you that there is no absolute right and wrong and that we are free to do what we want."   The thief leaves the store and returns that evening and breaks in. He has disabled all the alarms and locks and is in the process of robbing the store. That is when the owner of the store enters through a side door. The thief pulls out a gun. The owner cannot see the man's face because he is wearing a ski mask.   "Don't shoot me," says the owner. "Please take whatever you want and leave me alone."   "That is exactly what I plan to do," says the thief.   "Wait a minute. I know you. You are the man that was in the store earlier today. I recognize your voice."   "That is very unfortunate for you," says the thief. "Because now you also know what I look like. And since I do not want to go to jail I am forced to kill you."   "You cannot do that," says the owner.   "Why not?"   "Because it is not right," pleads the desperate man.   "But did you not tell me today that there is no right and wrong?"   "Yes, but I have a family, children, that need me, and a wife."   "So? I am sure that you are insured and that they will get a lot of money. But since there is no right and wrong it makes no difference whether or not I kill you. And since if I let you live you will turn me in and I will go to prison. Sorry , but that will not do."   "But it is a crime against society to kill me.  It is wrong because society says so."   "As you can see, I don't recognize society's claim to impose morals on me.  It's all relative.  Remember?"   "Please do not shoot me. I beg you. I promise not to tell anyone what you look like. I swear it!"   "I do not believe you and I cannot take that chance."   "But it is true!" I swear I'll tell no one."   "Sorry, but it cannot be true because there is no absolute truth, no right and wrong, no error, remember? If I let you live and then I left, you will break your so-called promise because it is all relative. There is no way I could trust you.  Our conversation this morning convinced me that you believe everything is relative. Because of that, I cannot believe you will keep your word.  I cannot trust you.    "But it is wrong to kill me.  It isn't right!"   "It is neither right or wrong for me to kill you.  Since truth is relative to the individual, if I kill you, that is my truth.  And, it is obviously true that if I let you live I will go to prison. Sorry, but you have killed yourself."   "No. Please do not shoot me. I beg you."   "Begging makes no difference."   .... Bang....      If relativism is true, then was it wrong to pull the trigger? Perhaps someone might say that it is wrong to take another life needlessly. But why is that wrong, if there is no standard of right or wrong? Others have said that it is a crime against society. But, so what? If what is true for you is simply true, then what is wrong with killing someone to protect yourself after you have robbed him?  If is true for you that to protect yourself you must kill, then who cares what society says?  Why is anyone obligated to conform to social norms?  Doing so is a personal decision.      Though not all relativists will behave in an unethical manner, I see relativism as a contributor to overall anarchy.         Thoughts ? Opinions ?

20090305082325AAVkkpo	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	I would like some feedback on an excerpt of a play/script that i am writing?	this play/script is a spin on a semi famous japanese legend. there were two famous swordsmiths back when samurais existed, one was muramasa and the others name was masamune. muramasas blades were flawless, but he had a bloodlust and a sick and insane mind. it was said that his swords would cause the wielder to go insane and blind with rage, causing people to believe his swords were cursed. masamune on the other hand was calm. tranquil. and everything of a stereotype of discipline. his swords were said to rival that of the muramasa. the legend ended around the late 1500s. i place this story around the 1800s where a man has started murdering with a sword that was made by muramasa. he has killed hundreds. an imperialist samurai named hayate barely survived. he learned about the legend and went to a shrine where the last known masamune blade was kept (since it is said int he legend that the two blades would rival. this is where the excerpt starts as he starts talking to the shrines priest.      ps: for those who dont know, a diasho is a double sword set, a long and a short.      priest: there is no reason i should give you this blade      hayate: if i speak the name of the blade that drew this scar. drew my blood. you would speak very different words.      priest: ...muramasa...since the beginning of time, a legend has been told. a battle between all that is good. tranquil. all that is beautiful against all the darkness. pain. screams of sorrow that is still heard toda--      hayate: stop. i have not come here to listen to your poetry. each word that i speak represents another life taken by the blade of muramasa. i would very well take a stand, but like all the others who had, i would simply be cut down. i need it. to protect      priest: swords are not made to protect. they are meant to take lives.      hayate: i am here for the masamune. weather or not if you give it to me is your choice. but i do promise you, at the end it will be in my possession. it will be used to take a life. but the blood it will draw is very little to nothing compared to the red stained fields and lives already taken by the muramasa. so i stand here now asking you to make a wise choice.      priest: and if i choose to decline?      hayate: you wont. you have burdened yourself with a duty. now it is time for you to fulfill that duty.      priest: ...the masamune itself isnt strong enough to take on the muramasa.      hayate: than give me more.      priest: i will make you a daisho, along with the blade of masamune. even then however, it still will not mean anything. it will still be a simple sharpened steel used to cut through rotting flesh.      hayate: then what must i do?      priest: you must clear your mind. you must cleanse, and shower all the rage caused by the darkness away. this sword will be cut and burnt into your soul. if you are to become one with it, you cannot allow the darkness to consume you as you still draw emotional power from it. you must be in control..      hayate: i have let go of the darkness years ago.      priest: and yet you still have a long way to travel.      hayate: then i will travel with the masamune.      priest: i will see to it..that you do.      hayate: we dont have time.      priest: and yet you will wait a month as i complete the daisho.   --   excerpt 2: it is soon revealed that the person who had muramasas blade was a student of a still living muramasa. the priest was revealed to be masamune, and he was killed by muramasa. here hayate confronts muramasa.

20090305083922AAwbVBh	Arts & Humanities;History	Silent films and the 1900s vs. Present Day?	Hey, my topic for and HOA short paper is silent films and why they don't exist anymore in the 21st century and then to write why you think it's no longer needed or why it's not considered important?   I wrote up a short paragraph but I feel that it is severely lacking... any help in improving it and providing some new information is appreciated...      My paragraph:           Silent films are not in production anymore because sound films were simply better than silent films because of the improved quality and the incorporation of sound. So, just as analog tv is becoming inferior to digital tv silent films later became inferior do to the sound films.  Silent films may no longer exist but they have paved the way for improvement and helped bring films into peoples' homes.  Silent films were a part of America’s history and venture into the technological field of movie making.

You came far to see the wizard,   Followed the yellow brick road,   Traveled through the forest,   That lead to his emerald home.      One of you needs a heart,   One of you needs a brain,   One of you needs courage,   The other wants to leave.      Your heart let you withstand evil,   The monkeys you defeated with wit,   With courage you saved your friend,   And together you defeated the witch.      Your heart,   Your brain,   Your courage,   You had it all along,   Now to send her home.      Eyes made of Tin,   Met eyes of Straw,   Which saw a lion's evil grin,   "What are you waiting for, boys?   Grab her and dig in."

By the side of my bed was a small wooden table with a fluorescent lamp I almost knocked over trying to grab a glass of water. I was recumbent watching the lion king when dorian appeared infront of our wooden framed door with nothing but a pair of silky shorts on and two glasses of wine in his hand. His eyes clinged to mine for a moment as he whisked his way to our bed , his words floating smoothly with the Barry white song he had turned on. He placed the glasses by the table and pulled my body towards his bare chest.          "I love you", he told me and continued singing along to the words of Barry White. His hands fondled my lingerie and reached my ample waist. His kiss pressed gently on my wanting lips. I moved my small arms around his shoulders and raised my leg by his side. He kissed me again only deeper. He caref carried me onto the bed and nibbled on my ear         "I have a surprise for you baby", He whispered while his tongue rolled down my neck.       ? 2009 elsa

This is a painting that was in my home, and as a child I was always amused by the fact that you could see the buttocks of one of the women in the crowd. The painting, as mentioned above, resembles the style of Bruegel the Elder, and could be his, though I'm not quite sure.

Hi i'm doing an art project for my GCSE and one of the artists i am researching is Tracey Emin.  i want to know where i can see some of the works in London, and i think she is represented by the White cube gallery in london, but i'm not sure.

If she does have some works permantly at the white cube gallery, which of the three sites is it (masons yard, hoxton square or the other one - can't remember quite where)and if she doesn't permanently have works at the white cube, is there anywhere else i can see some of her work? thank you.
20090305091255AAsZ9R5	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Can anybody help me find this book?	I read it about 3 years ago.. I know the story, just not the author or title.(the title's maybe something about the number 16 or a phone ringing, but I honestly can't remember.)       There's a French guy called Jean / John Paul, he takes up some work as a steward in a theatre. The balcony there catches fire because he dropped a match or something.. 20 orphaned children die because the balcony collapses on them (the kids were out on a day trip). One of the girls from the fire becomes a "ghost" and calls up boys + men, puts on a really sexy voice to try + get them to come to her house / flat. (In part of the book, the boy is lying awake + hears the phone ring for the 16th time before someone answers it.) Turns out this girl plans to kill the people who go to her place, with syringes or something?        If ANYBODY can help me.. thanks.

But sailors and fighting marines,   Will sail the oceans blue.      The steel was forged from what was left,   Of trade centers demise.   Twenty-four tons of tower steel,   The bow is it's disguise.      What will we call this ship, they said,   That's made from towers tall?   They named it U S S New York,   And said it will not crawl.      Upon her hull, immortal words,   In golden letters set.   Two words are all that's to be said,   Two words, "NEVER FORGET".                  Please people, no thumbs down on any answers.  It doesn't serve any purpose, and is distracting.

Ok, so I have to put together a poetry portfolio for school(I'm 14)      Would you mnd saying which ones are your favorites, and what you would change?   thanks!      1.   Free Verse Poem      If I could be a sight to see,   I would dwell in the city of lights,   And reach up to the bright moonlight,      I would watch young lovers fall in love,   As they steal a kiss under the shadow of my being,       I will watch as the bikers ride by wearing their fashionable hats,   I wonder how one would look on me?      I’ll listen to the music,   Of the grand Carousel,   As it spins round and round,   Filling the air with children’s laughter,       I’ll over see my brilliant city,   And stand tall and proud,      People from far and wide will visit me,   Flashing their cameras and posing next to me,    As if I am the biggest star to see.      When the sun rises out of the Earth,   It will splash me with a warm, orange, hello    As it rises to its place in the sky,   To start a new day,   Mmmm is that baker’s bread I smell!      People will come day after day,   Photographers, tourists, the old lady on the park bench,   They will smile a bright hello,    As they admire my structure,   From far below,      Oh what a site I would be!         2.    Winter Breaks      The sun comes up,   The night is gone,   Trees breathe life,   As the chill loosens its grasp,   Finally! Warmth is the air,      Not so long now, till spring is here,   Winter will enjoy this lengthy break,   It will rest, and not come back,   Till Christmas time is almost,      Flowers will bloom,   The rain will poor,   Green buds will burst forth,   Oh what joy!   Yes, winter is on break.         3.   Gravel   The crunch of a homecoming,   The noise of the night,      The sound of a warm, fall day,   Walking in the forests by night,      A simple, familiar noise,   Of the crinkle of the road less traveled on,   Gravel,    An old time acquaintance.             4.   Strawberries      So sweet and fruitful,   Luscious and red,   So soft and full life   Like a child playing with a red balloon,      The tasty smell,    so pleasing to the noise,    a gentle tingling,   like a feather to the nose,      Popping in color,    as it grows out of dark, green vines   A delight to the eye,      Warm summer days,    A woven basket,   A child’s bonnet,   Small, chubby fingers,   Reach out and pluck,   The delight eye popper,   Oh what childhood joy!          thank you!!

20090305094405AAc3zP4	Arts & Humanities;History	Please help U.S History.?	1. What was the Proclamation of 1763?   (Points: 1)           George III's annual address to the 13 colonies               The peace treaty that ended the French and Indian War              A declaration of the boundary of the 13 coastal colonies              The colonists' first formal complaint to the British government            2. Why did the colonists object to the Sugar Act?   (Points: 1)           They were being taxed without any representation in the British Parliament.              The tax was too high.               The colonists were forced to buy sugar that had special stamps on it.              The colonists wanted the money collected to fund their local governments.            3. What was the Declaratory Act?   (Points: 1)           It forced colonists to accept British soldiers into their homes.              It stated that Britain could still pass laws affecting the colonies.              It closed the Boston Harbor to all trade.              It caused taxes to be collected mostly at ports.            4. Why was the Battle of Saratoga a major turning point during the American Revolution?   (Points: 1)           The battle convinced the French to help the colonies.              The battle ended the activity of British troops in the West.              The battle eliminated the Native American threat.              The battle destroyed the British Navy.            5. Which Enlightenment thinker described how government should correspond to the general will?   (Points: 1)           John Locke              Jean-Jacques Rousseau              Baron de Montesquieu            6. Which was the site of the first battle of the American Revolution?   (Points: 1)           Concord              Boston              Bunker Hill              Saratoga            7. How was the Constitution different from the Articles of Confederation?   (Points: 1)           The Constitution gave the government more taxation powers.              The Constitution outlawed slavery.              The Articles created a much stronger monarchy.              The Articles formed a stronger central government.            8. Which was part of the Great Compromise in the U.S. Constitution?   (Points: 1)           An agreement on how the slave population would be counted              A decision on the structure of the legislature               A compromise on the length of a president's term in office               A decision to limit the Constitution to seven articles            9. Which of the following was not an original feature of the U.S. Constitution?   (Points: 1)           Special rules for women              Three branches of government              Two legislative houses              Rules about slavery            10. Which was a major point made in the Federalist Papers?   (Points: 1)           Strong government is necessary in foreign affairs.              The new government would be too federal.              George Washington should not be made president.              A bicameral legislature would only benefit Southern states.

20090305095813AAudkER	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	The Edward Cullen thing, love...?	Okay, so i watched twilight just to see what the big deal abut this edward cullen thing was about. All these people like ROBERT EDWARD OME, so i started watching and was like he his UGLY, then by the end i felt completely in love. So, i read all teh books, Within a week if i may say, and that jus drew me closer to him. If i'm not readsing the books again, gazing at robert on one of my 36 twilight-related posters, obsessive i know, i'm watching one of his interviews. I don't love robert, he;'s the closest thing i have to Edward. I do have a life, i get out a lot. I am the most popular girl in my yaer, and everyone see's it as a joke, even my best friends. No one understands. I feel i can't get over him. I left it 3 months, or more and still i feel the same. I squeal at the sight of robert, or the name of Edawrd. Everything i talk about is to do with him or twilight. I used to cry a lot every night. Not anymore, that's something i have stopped. Thankfully.       I'm not one of these 'Bite me Edward' people, i just know that no ones perfect enough for me, only Edward. No one else is as perfectly caring and loving and mysterious. Since iwatched it and read the books i hav't fancied anyone. It's scaring me, i can't get over Edward. I know it's impossible but Love is all i can think of, i know it's impossible and un true it's just what my heart is insisting on. Hurting me.   I'm not an emo, AT ALL!!!   I'm not depressing either.   I'm your average, funny, girl. And this is tearing me up. Or my heart up.      My mom knows i 'love' edward, but she doesn't know the seriousnes of it.   I don't want to see a phsyciatrist. I don't want to be considered crazy,   'Cause i'm not.   I'm not a stalker and i am not crazy. I just want to find someone as perfect as Edward. Though, i can't.      Does anyone know how to help me?    Thank you,   I'm not a weirdo xD Lol      xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

OK I'm trying to make and sell a type of book where the pages are laminated and are bound on a wire comb type spiral. I also want a thin cardboard type of front and back cover that is also punched to have the wire comb spiral through it. Is there a machine that I can have at home that can punch and bind the covers and pages? The book will only have 5-10 laminated pages and the front and back cover.       Also, what are those cardboard covers wrapped in? I mean, when I see notebooks or other books that have this cardboard type cover, they are wrapped in a big sticker type thing that is printed on. Can I print on those at home to have a cover for my book?       I know these are really ignorant and stupid sounding questions, but I don't know the terms for any of this stuff or how they are used.

I know i posted this a few days ago, but i re wrote alot :)   Thanks         And tonight, theres no use in waiting on the stars   for they gave up on my wishing long ago   so before the sun begans to set,,   ill cuddle up to nothing more than your memory   Slipping your t shirt over my shoulders,    i catch a reminder of your scent   sending chills throughout my body   and Although your presence isn't here to embrace   I'll forever hold the power of sheer memories.   Closing my eyes   i feel the warmth of your breathe upon my skin   the sensation empowers me   almost overwhelming.   slowly you run your fingers through my hair   kissing me up and down, tracing my every curve   gently nibbling on my ear, I'm left wanting more.   and as we share the warmth between our bodies    you pull me in closer,tighter, with no intensions on letting go.   My vision becomes blurred, and my eyes began to sting.   wipe the tears from my cheeks,   tell me this isnt just my imagination.   I know the drill oh-to-well   i slowly drift into dream,    holding you one last time   but only in my heart,   and I wake up to nothing,    The nothingness of an empty bed.

At Yalta, Roosevelt and Churchill clashed with Stalin over his refusal to allow elections in  (1 point)   Poland.   West Germany.   Greece.   Japan.        After the war, the Soviet Union quickly took control of     the Potsdam Conference.   Germany and Japan.   the United Nations.   several Eastern European countries.       The Soviet Union wanted to rebuild after the war in ways that would   protect its own interests.   establish a politically open world.   provide markets for its products.   prevent the United States from building an empire.        For nearly 50 years, the Cold War was characterized by     small battles worldwide.   the gradual decline of Soviet power.   American and Soviet isolationism.   political conflict and military tensions.         As World War II ended, a major disagreement between the United States and the Soviet Union involved     Soviet domination of Poland.   the division of Latin America.   the role of Britain in postwar Europe.   the wording of the United Nations charter.

I'm currently a freshmen psych major at a community college, but I thought it that doesn't work out I'd really want to get into voice acting (for cartoons, narrating and such). How hard would it be to do this? Would I have to take classes if I want any respect for it? I've been taking music classes, so I can sing if I need to (I know a lot of voice actors need to sing). I would say I have a generally good voice.      Would I have to take acting classes? I really don't like stage acting? PS: also, how difficult would it be to get into radio as a personality? Not necessarily talk radio, just DJing.
20090305094836AA3SDAp	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Honest opinion about my story please?	It's from a chapter in my book... what do you think... You may edit if you wish         I was recumbent watching the Lion King when Dorian walked into our egyptian style room holding two glasses of wine in his hand. He was wearing a pair of silky shorts baring his toned chest and bulging muscles. He placed the glasses on the table and walked towards me smiling. He pulled my body close to him and whispered in my ear. His words floated smoothly with the Barry White song playing in the background.           "I love you", he told me and continued singing along to the song. His hands fondled my lingerie and reached my ample waist. His kiss pressed gently on my wanting lips. I moved my small arms around his shoulders and raised my leg by his side. He kissed me again only deeper. He careully carried me onto the bed and nibbled on my ear.         "I have a surprise for you baby", He told me looking deep into my eyes.         "Oh yeah, what is it?", I replied. I looked around the room only to find there was nothing unusual.        "Close your eyes", he said with a grin on his face that emphasized his dimples.         He moved from the bed and started roaming around our bedroom. His cologne gave me a clue as to where he was. It led me to our closet where I could hear him shuffling and mumbling under his breath.         "Uh huh, I found what I'm looking for", he boasted.
