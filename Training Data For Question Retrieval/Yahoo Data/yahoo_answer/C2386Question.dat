20090129040541AApaDeO	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	University of Exeter or Brunel University?	Hey People!      I am going to graduate from high school in june and have just got accepted in both University of Exeter and Brunel University for Business & Management. I know Exeter U is much better in term of education than Brunel, but I have heard that it is a very small town with not much to do in terms of entertainment (clubs, bars, recreation, shopping...). Brunel is far behind in education rankings and student satisfaction rankings but I heard their is lots to do their. Is Exeter's entertainment facilities that bad that the education should be overlooked? Is Brunel's Business course not as bad as people say it is?      I am totally confused as I will be spending 4 years at my chosen university and I want to have a good education but also some fun. I have never been to any of the universities myself and will not be able to do so (I live in HK, busy with the IB Diploma).      Your experiences and opinions will be appreciated.      Thanks in advance,   Kavi Agarwal

20090129042627AA08L1v	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Business grads, ex-business majors, etc.?	My question is how much (hard) math is really involved in a business degree(major). I am currently in the CSU(cal state) system and was told by many counselors that if I did not like math then business is not the right major for me. I did not find math to be a obstacle until this was brought to my attention. Business requires only two actual math classes to be taken, Statistics or Finite math, and Business calculus. After that, supposedly all of the business classes will have math in it indirectly(there will be math involved) like economics. i am considering changing my major now because i do not like HARD math, I guess my highest math I can handle is algebra 2 but I have been reading ratings of math classes provided and if I pick the right professor I can probably pass. One counselor said no math is involved in econ, one said they dont advise students to take econ until they have finished atleast one math course and I just want the single answer, is business really math intensive? I am fine with addition, subtracting, etc to find certain calculations. My mind is set on business but I was told that there are many business students who graduate with a 2.0 and cant get into any MBA programs so I have a better chance changing my major that has nothing to do with math at all and then applying for an MBA if I still want one. I also have friends that attended and graduated other schools in the UC(university of california) system and said that was no math at all in their program. Can someone tell me their experience with their Business classes?

20090129042337AA7pZkP	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	How do i get over a failing mark?	I'm in college right now. We just got our mid-term exam papers back in a particular subject in school.I didn't do well in that particular exam and i got a failing grade in it. trust me, the grade is very,VERY low. It's even way below the passing mark. there's still the finals period left (after mid-terms period is finals period),and i can still make up for that failing grade in that particular subject,BUT i need a really high grade to compensate for that failing mark in order to pass the subject in the end. I am in graduating class, it is my last year and it is also the last semester. I CAN'T AFFORD TO FAIL ANY SUBJECTS. My father is going to kill me if that happens and i might kill myself too for that matter. I know what to do , i have a lot of work to do, but my problem is i can't get over that failing mark. I am now dwelling on it for hours since i first saw my paper this afternoon. I think i will be worrying about it for days, and i can't have that; i need to get it off my mind in order to be able to concentrate for making up for that failing mark, but i just can't, i've been stressing about it too much , and i think this will go on and on since i am a worrier kind of person...so i need encouragement guys.. any tips?...thanks..

I received enough from the Pell grant to cover my tuition, with money left over for books.  Now, I've already filed my 2008 taxes.  This morning while looking over my school info, I see my 1098 from the school, it shows $1880+ in qualified tuition, box 1.        My question is this: I didn't claim this, because I assumed that I wouldn't get a tax credit, because it was a grant, no tuition paid out of pocket; am I wrong?  Could I have claimed this?  And is it a deduction or a credit?        In short, can I claim this and will it give me a larger tax return??      Thanks all!

20090129052622AAPpjPt	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Meaning of "Homologation" in a telecommunications context?	First, my apologies for making a long question out of my trying to understand the definition of a word.    Online dictionaries aren't entirely clear on the use/meaning of the term "Homologate / Homologation" in the context of telecommunications.  For example, Merriam-Webster online defines homologate as "to approve, to agree".     In Wikipedia, there is a reference to this word being used in a technical context/telecommunications context: "Homologation is widely used in technical areas, such as communications, when products and/or processes have to be certified against the corresponding telecom standard, internal normative, etc."    I have seen homologate / homologation used in many instances where the wikipedia definition is incorrect as well.  For example, I was just reading an article with the following statement:  "As part of an investment estimated to reach USD 15 million, the operator is working to homologate its existing GSM networks and enhance the service offering for all mobile customers."    In this context, the Wikipedia definition is incorrect.  The service provider already has their GSM wireless network in place.  "GSM" is an international standard defined by the ITU, so, if the service provider has a network of GSM equipment, that equipment is already certified against standards.  In the wikipedia context, to homologate that equipment would be redundant.      So, can anyone clarify what homologate truly means in a telecommunications context?    Thanks!

I took aim and threw the dagger, which whistles against the wind and immediately seeps the life out of the poor victim. At the sight of his fallen comrade, the combatant took hold of his spear, however within the second, he too suffered the same fate.

20090129062118AAy8219	Education & Reference;Homework Help	CAROL ANN DUFFY - "IN YOUR MIND"?	The other country, is it anticipated or half-remembered?   Its language is muffled by the rain which falls all afternoon   one autumn in England, and in your mind   you put aside your work and head for the airport   with a credit card and a warm coat you will leave   on the plane. The past fades like newsprint in the sun.   You know people there. Their faces are photographs   on the wrong side of your eyes. A beautiful boy   in the bar on the harbour serves you a drink – what? –   asks you if men could possibly land on the moon.   A moon like an orange drawn by a child. No.   Never. You watch it peel itself into the sea.   Sleep. The rasp of carpentry wakes you. On the wall,   a painting lost for thirty years renders the room yours.   Of course. You go to your job, right at the old hotel, left,   then left again. You love this job. Apt sounds   mark the passing of the hours. Seagulls. Bells. A flute   practising scales. You swap a coin for a fish on the way home.   Then suddenly you are lost but not lost, dawdling   on the blue bridge, watching six swans vanish   under your feet. The certainty of place turns on the lights   all over town, turns up the scent on the air. For a moment   you are there, in the other country, knowing its name.   And then a desk. A newspaper. A window. English rain.

In an English Composition class we were asked to write 5-6 pages of analysis on the rhetorical devices of an article that is only 3 pages long.  I know it is possible to do if you ramble on about the rhetorical devices, but this class is also supposed to have a business focus. In the business world people don't want to hear you ramble on, so why should we have to do that to complete a paper?

It will be very grateful for me if you suggest me some grammatical corrections, better-expressions as well as feedback on my essay.          (Under-age smoking)      Smoking has always been on the list of why people die- figures more than three millions and increasing steadily. In particular, under-age smoking is as six times detrimental as adult-smoking and those who smoke at early age are more likely to suffer from mental disorders as well as physical diseases and it could stay on even when they are older. As a result, it has caused many people -parents, teachers, adolescence experts etc. to express concerns and appropriate strategies are needed.

My husband has spent the last five months in an application process to be hired as a police cadet. The station would fund his police academy training and pay him salary to attend. He made the second highest grade on the written exam and aced the physical agility test. He passed his background investigation too.   He attended public school until the 6th grade and was home schooled through 12th grade. He went to college for a few years, was a lab assistant there, but did not get his degree. He also went on a few mission trips, one of which was 6 weeks long. He was put in charge of his own site in a drug ridden ghetto and had people he was in charge of.   He had his board interview yesterday and it was decided that my husband's homeschooling disqualified him on the basis that he didn't have enough life experience because of it.      Are you kidding me?

Music represent an art and a way to relax when we are tired at night. The music is not my favorite hobby, but i like to listen some groups. In addition, we can  notice the role of music in teenager's life. En effect, the survey of the document was taken recently to determine the role of music in their life,and the survey studied the listening habits of 60.000 teenagers. Then, we can to know where they like to listen music.   For example, 72% of teenagers listen music while they are doing chores. However, for my part, i listen music only when i'm on the bed. Besides, the majority of people's style of music is Hip-Hop/Rap with 23% of teenagers. A lot of type of music exist: we have hip-hop, rap, techno, jazz and others.   Then the music represent an universal language and an universal connection.   For my part, the music is a leisure and my favorit style of music is Rock and Punk. Iisten music when i have a lot of time. When i listen music, i have the sensation to discover a new world. I don't have this sensation in other type of music like country or Rap.   That's why, my least favorite type of music is Rap and R&B because i don't like the style and the lyric.   My father make me discover others artists or band that i know very little of beause they are dead ( like The Beattles).   From my point of view, music is a source of pleasure, it allows you to relax after work. We can forget stress, tensions of daily life.    We are cheered up.
