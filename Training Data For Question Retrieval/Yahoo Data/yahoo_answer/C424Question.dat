If a burglar see only one bell this could mean a house with money and valuables inside and only one door to break into.   If they see two bells this suggests a house divided into flats. Poorer people and they expect to find two more doors behind the first one.      I plan to fit two bells - one with my name the other with a name that does not exist.
