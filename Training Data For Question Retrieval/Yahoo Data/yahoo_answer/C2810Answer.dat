k8HpMaHxaa	Not really, and thats only because I work in a restaurant. Most chefs/cooks wash their hands after everything they have touched, especially something like chicken, or breading, to not only avoid germs, but for cross contamination reasons. After so many years, its second nature. <br>  <br>  But on the flipside, Ive also seen cooks who come in the kitchen, snap on some gloves and go to town on 6 different orders....and not change their gloves at all in between. So they go from slapping a burger on the grill, oiling raw chicken, grabbing a handful of fries, then move to a side salad, and jump back on grill to grab lettuce and tomato for a burger. I find that much more disgusting then someone not using gloves. If you have a customer with an allergy, that could seriously effect them. Cross contamination isnt fun. =/<br>  <br>  In my experience, gloves sometimes tend to give a false sense of cleanliness.|`|kKmuFi4zaa	yes, i care. ALL food should be prepared with plastic gloves.|`|hpxc5szsaa	yes...most likely because u dont know if they just came out of the bathroom and just literally slapped their own *** or somethin,beat off during their break without washing their hands...u never  no wat people do these days...|`|vecYJLyvaa	Of course,thats why I eat at SUBWAY,they continually wear gloves and change them before and after handling the cash register.|`|JxY5WXF2aa	Yes I care that is very unsanitary. I don't want anybody's hands to touch my food but my own.|`|jzBzwBYaaa	ew yes. I don't want other people's germs.|`|NO2Qk86eaa	Absolutely. But I'm kinda weird about germs in the first place. <br>  <br>  You never know what the sandwich maker was doing before you showed up. Maybe picking their nose, scratching their butt, sneezing in their hand. They could've gone to the bathroom and not washed their hands. I'm not going to take that chance.
JfVxCDb7aa	I HAVE<br>  <br>  ON DAYS WHEN MY FEET ARE KILLING<br>  <br>  ME|`|VvbOSbRnaa	Whenever I go to a restaurant, I always tend to sit cross-legged. I find it way more comfortable and most of the time I am wearing sandals and I kick them off all the time!|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I've done that before, like, not for a long time, but like my shoe will slip off or something.  Its not really a big deal.  In fact, one time I went to a Japanese restaurant for a friend's birthday, and they actually made us take our shoes off.|`|AA10804824	My daughter and I both always take our shoes off and sit cross legged in our seats. Always. i can't believe she yelled at you "you only get one warning".|`|Id1ypViXaa	sometimes|`|hpxc5szsaa	yea...should take the socks off to and throw 'em at someones food or face...lol|`|lNsr26oIaa	Your bf's mother was right to take your money elsewhere. That was a really nasty hostess. If it violates health code for you to slip out of your sandals, she should been nicer about it. You weren't inside the restaurant and there was no food around, so I don't get how it violated anything anyway.|`|pQbYaNf2aa	I haven't taken my shoes off in a restaurant but that lady should  not be yelling at anybody specially at customers.<br>  <br>  Maybe she has a foot ocd, I am not making fun of it at all. My hubby is a neatfreak and hates feet being exposed to outside elements like road, ground, public areas etc. he flips out whenever I wear flipflops to walk outside.|`|6PfJXI7iaa	Yes, I have done that before and no I haven't been yelled at.  Never heard such a thing about anyone caring unless of course it was a top of the line restaurant.|`|AA10475412	I did it at a supper club one time. Took off my Birkenstock sandals and walked to the salad bar barefoot. The floor was all carpeted.|`|15ab23bf8c4feba4402c841d7df4951baa	Yes, I do that often.  and have never been yelled at.  It sounds like this lady had a foot fetish in a bad way.|`|INJSpV4haa	That is so frikking bizarre. She was acting like you'd committed some capital crime.<br>  <br>  I do not believe how much anti-barefoot bias and foot-phobia exists in this country. How can people get so hung up about something so harmless? Is it prudishness?<br>  <br>  I think you did the right thing to go across the street to another restaurant. And don't idiots like that keep you from baring your feet.|`|e45f658f9932624abf10e836e95d3bd3aa	I actually do walk into resturaunts barefoot and dine. I have been a full time barefooter for almost 2? years and it helps to know that there are NO health codes in existance by any state health department(see sources). Most people believe the myths that there are and they do not want to get fined by any healh officials and once I show the a copy of a letter that I have from the health department that its O.K. they're cool with it.

The special mayo they put on there is fabulous!  If you ever come to town (for DERBY )  you have to give it a visit.|`|xtBdRAxPaa	I would definitely have to say P.F. Chang's. Their food is delicious and the service is wonderful every time I go there! It's romantic but it's also a good place to take friends and dine.|`|JxY5WXF2aa	Chili's, Ruby Tuesday's, Applebee's...I hear that Golden Corral is pretty good too. Oh and Red Robin they have the best strawberry freckled lemonade. It has real strawberries in it and they keep refilling it. It's really good.|`|NGE7nIhqaa	I like fish&steak places. I'm from the South, and home cooked meals are always tasty to me. Otherwise, I loved my aunt's restaurant, Stella. It was in Memphis, TN until it closed recently.|`|vecYJLyvaa	Komagashi Sushi,thats if you like sushi.|`|fDXOImgsaa	a cheap one

Although there's nothing better than Pizza Hut breadsticks!|`|9WMgb4phaa	Pizza Hut!!!|`|9YLMj9SZaa	Pizza Hut|`|aZ9qBM4Haa	Pizza Hut|`|cMRphaJfaa	Pizza Hut is better|`|5Tshncyfaa	little Caesar's|`|voYyWgb9aa	Pizza Hut is great for offers and great value to be honest.<br>  However, dominoes pizzas look so much more delicious.. lol<br>  I'd go with dominoes, I hate pizza though ;l|`|c174216429125287577e00667da65510aa	I prefer Pizza Hut but Hubbie delivers for Dominos and he prefers them, few arguments at the weekend when he wants to bring pizza home for our junk food night cause we can't agree!|`|gjweuOcVaa	Out of the two, Dominoes by far. Pizza Hut isn't bad though. Papa Johns is AWFUL.

I heard that back in the late 90's, a pizza hut employee was dismembered late one night by an psychotic assistant manager.  The assistant manager supposedly, ground up the unfortunate employee and mixed his body parts with the pizza sauce.  Each time a customer asked for extra sauce, they got extra Pete Finklestein (employee's name).  The head of the Pizza Hut corporation allegedly paid off the police chief and the editor of the local newspaper to bury the story as deeply as Finklestein was buried in the sauce.  So to answer your question, I order from Domino's where no employees have gone missing since the mid 1980's.|`|yuXGsNUCaa	Pizza Hut has better Dinning rooms so we can sit and enjoy our meal with a beer or whatever you want :) Most of the Dominoes are too small so we have to order from them all the time. I like Pizza Hut's thicker Pan Pizza better. It is slightly more expensive than Dominoes though...Pizza Hut also has a lunch all you can eat buffet to. But again only for dinning room, not for ordering.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	dominoes probally, I prefer to make my own pizza from scratch normally. Pizza hut is gross, they spray on extra grease on the topping to make the cheese turn more golden, yuck!!!|`|z1gUsqzHaa	Local pizza parlors for the win!!|`|kKmuFi4zaa	Pizza Hut for sure, it has more flavor. Domino's is bland.|`|VXcp8hvHaa	pizza hut|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	neither|`|YTQGKzuqaa	I like Dominos the best =]|`|a31kUn1Naa	Pizza Hut. And only for the stuffed crust.<br>  <br>  So if stuffed crust did not exist: Neither.|`|Tg6DxG7zaa	Dominoes... well where I live. <br>  Pizza Hut is to greasy and gross. Same goes for Pizza Pizza.<br>  I like dominoes because the crust actually tastes good.|`|Q6euzOmVaa	between the two, Pizza Hut. Papa John's is better.<br>  <br>  Little Caesar's is garbage.|`|dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	Pizza Hut|`|kzWYi5OIaa	Pizza Hut!|`|Hvhynlftaa	Dominoes for me.<br>  <br>  So, sooo chessy, fatty, and yummy.<br>  <br>  My local pizza hut is nasty for some reason...|`|f1b506232ce71c8393c9f65c7c3eecabaa	Dominoes has a really nice crust, and Papa Johns is really great too. It depends on your sense of taste, and what you consider good.|`|7n523JW1aa	Dominoes. At least where I live in L.A. the Pizza hut near me has like no sauce on it at all. It's just bread and cheese. YUCK!|`|qnq5ex89aa	pizza hut by far the dominos in my city sucks theyre always late and it tastes like its been a freezer all day|`|VCa9zIqwaa	I pick Pizza Hut|`|0PNxzRdzaa	Dominos is what I usually get.|`|ofQ1QM1Saa	I don't know... I really like both. :P|`|JWk1lKJgaa	did you know Pizza Hut got started in Kansas, by two guys that never made a pizza before.|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	Domino's. But Pizza Hut does have the good stuffed crust and quepapas.|`|yf0Qm9gMaa	Domino's! X)|`|umEgRb7Vaa	I like Domino's for the toppings but Pizza Hut for the crust.
JfVxCDb7aa	no,<br>  only saw that in a movie<br>  <br>  I would demand a free meal|`|VvbOSbRnaa	Well, I haven't seen a cockroach in any of the restauants I want to (yet!) but I would probably still finish my meal, I would tell the manager and I would still leave a tip. Not the servers fault there was a cockroach. I would probably have my boyfriend kill it!|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Yeah, I did, was at Sbarro's pizza in NYC, across from Madison Square Garden.  We were eating our pizza at a counter they had set up for customers to sit down at.  I didn't complain to management or anything, there was really no point.  It was busy as hell and we needed to get to a hockey game, so would have taken too long.  As for paying for the meal, there you had to pay for it before you got it, so, yeah.  Didn't leave a tip as there were no waitresses.  It's pretty much like fast food pizza place.|`|3UB7mSNwaa	I went into a restaurant and saw cock roaches crawling on the edges of a fish tank.  I was getting take out for the work crew.  I did not eat the food when I got back to work and I never went back there.  If I was at a table and that happened to me I would have complained about the food stopped eating and left without paying anything,|`|R3SZ2hT4aa	yup.i brushed the roach off the table and kept eating.it tasted good,what the heck.|`|hpxc5szsaa	um...squash it...|`|fbk9GpF2aa	Ahh...no.<br>  haha<br>  But I have eaten at a restaurant that had a health score of "ok to operate."<br>  It wasn't that bad actually.. the service sucked but it wasn't dirty and the food wasn't THAT bad. haha
VDpmh2VJaa	Olive garden<br>  we ate at carraba's last weekend.<br>  it was a bit higher in price bread isnt as good as bread sticks..<br>  hubby is addicted to soup and salad all you can eat..<br>  the salads w meals at crrabas are pathetic!!<br>  plus i had the spinach and chicken stuffed cannaloni and it tasted like chucks on frozen chicken in it..UGH!<br>  <br>  Never had anything taste frozen at olive garden.|`|VvbOSbRnaa	Carrabbas. I like how you can choose if you want a garden or ceasar unlike Olive Garden where it comes w/ the garden salad. I do like Olive Garden a lot though, it is a close second. Macaron Grill is my least favorite out of the three. I do like it, just I like the other ones much more! :)|`|gaXUIduMaa	I didnt feel Carrabba's is in the same league as MG and OG so I have already voted it off the island.  .  <br>  Before, Macaroni Grill  was clearly better in that they had some unique dishes where OG was standard fare with a couple special items, but OG has greatly improved on that.  Although I go to both, I prefer Macaroni Grill and here is a rundown.  Experienced, knowlegable, professional staff; OG no way, MG very professional.  OG-Family dining but often noisy.  MG-not as family oriented but more romantic.  Variety  of dishes-edge to MG.  Price-edge to OG.  Desserts-MG by far.  Host/hostess effectiveness and trust (10 minute wait means 10 minute wait)-MG by far, OG has not been right yet.  <br>  BTW, at MG, take a look at the sign inside the restroom door.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Olive Garden doesn't even use olive oil in their dressing!

I vote Carraba's! Their Steak & Chicken marsala's are the best! The chicken marsala definitely out does the one olive garden has. Don't get me wrong tho, I like olive garden as well. My favs. there have always been the smoked mozzarella fonduta & a few of their pasta's, and most of all the Tiramisu. That dessert is to die for! That's just my opinion. I like both, but would prefer carrabba's.|`|eb4ee53aaf11c4714a318417619f8ef5aa	CARRABBA's.  Olive Garden is the biggest rip off going. They totally are not Italian. The food is bland aside from the over-oiled salad. They are as much Italian as Taco Bell is Mexican.|`|kBw3Picuaa	my favorite italian restaurant is olive garden. its so good and has a lot of choices of pasta. and no matter what u get u know its going to taste really good. now i want some olive garden|`|IqyKmYtCaa	i would have to say olive garden! they have a lot of choices and just great food and service<br>  <br>  hope i could help|`|iq75S5oeaa	olive garden and italian restaurant should never be used in the same sentence|`|goLJJ8Ruaa	olive garden
