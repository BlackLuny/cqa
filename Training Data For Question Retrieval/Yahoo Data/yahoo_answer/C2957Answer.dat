The field of Climate Science is still in it's infancy with nothing being seen as certain.<br>  <br>  For example, there have been claims that warming intensifies hurricanes..... however, thoughts have changed on that notion:<br>  <br>  Hurricane expert reconsiders global warming's impact<br>  By ERIC BERGER Copyright 2008 Houston Chronicle<br>  April 12, 2008, 12:00AM<br>  One of the most influential scientists behind the theory that global warming has intensified recent hurricane activity says he will reconsider his stand.<br>  The hurricane expert, Kerry Emanuel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, unveiled a novel technique for predicting future hurricane activity this week. The new work suggests that, even in a dramatically warming world, hurricane frequency and intensity may not substantially rise during the next two centuries.<br>  After the 2005 hurricane season, a series of other papers were published that appeared to show, among other things, that the most intense hurricanes were becoming more frequent.<br>  What has not been as broadly disseminated, say Pielke and some hurricane scientists, is that other research papers have emerged that suggest global warming has yet to leave an imprint on hurricane activity. One of them, published late last year in Nature, found that warming seas may not increase hurricane intensity.<br>  That paper's co-author, Gabriel Vecchi, a research scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said Emanuel's new work highlights the great uncertainty that remains in hurricane science.<br>  "While his results don't rule out the possibility that global warming has contributed to the recent increase in activity in the Atlantic, they suggest that other factors — possibly in addition to global warming — are likely to have been substantial contributors to the observed increase in activity," Vecchi said.<br>  Scientists wrangling with the hurricane-global warming question have faced two primary difficulties. The first is that the hurricane record before 1970 is not entirely reliable, making it nearly impossible to assess with precision whether hurricane activity has increased during the last century.<br>  The second problem comes through the use of computer models to predict hurricane activity. Most climate models, which simulate global atmospheric conditions for centuries to come, cannot detect individual tropical systems.<br>  After the 2005 hurricane season, a series of other papers were published that appeared to show, among other things, that the most intense hurricanes were becoming more frequent.<br>  What has not been as broadly disseminated, say Pielke and some hurricane scientists, is that other research papers have emerged that suggest global warming has yet to leave an imprint on hurricane activity.

The sea has been rising for some 16,000 years, and the rate of rise this centuary is inline with that of the last 2000 years.<br>  <br>  The sea remains alkaline.<br>  <br>  The icecaps have continued to decline as per the last 12,000 years, arctic levels were almost as low as the 1930's levels in 2007 but have recovered very fast since (triggered by changes in trade winds). The antarctic has shown little trend really, though in 2008 it hit an all time high, though the record is very short.<br>  <br>  *Global* ice cover currently is similar to 1980 levels.<br>  <br>  Global temperatures and co2 levels are still within natural levels based on the earths temperature and co2 history (based on many sources, not just the Vostok ice core).<br>  <br>  Hurricane / cyclone frequency or strength has not increased. The cost of hurricane damage and death has increased as the population has increased and more people have built in hurricane / cyclone prone areas, and propertie values have increased.<br>  <br>  No more super El Nino's have occured since 1998 as Al Gore predicted.<br>  <br>  The arctic was not ice free in 2008 as one scientist predicted and many news agencies reported. As the projection was wrong it has now been revised to 2030 until proved wrong again.<br>  <br>  Polar bear numbers continue to rise overall.<br>  <br>  Climate models continue to predict every possible scenario concievable, and the model developers continue to select the model runs that match reality. <br>  <br>  The antarctic had been considered to be cooling until very recently even by many alarmists, this was predicted by climate models. A new study has now shown it was infact warming, this also was predicted by climate models.<br>  <br>  People continue to blame all climate shifts that would occur naturally on man made climate change. Natural climate change as has always occured is innocent until proven guilty. Man made global warming is guilty without evidence.<br>  <br>  The IPCC projections fail to match observed temperatures.<br>  <br>  The mythical co2 heat sink that absorbs 50% of atmospheric co2 still eludes scientists.<br>  <br>  People continue to debate global warming though "there is no debate".<br>  <br>  Scientific agencies continue to request more money to investigate global warming, whilst the science is "settled".<br>  <br>  Ok so I am being a litte sarcastic, but it is impossible to attribute any climate change to man without first fully understanding natural changes (as we are know where near that) and without having climate models that are accurate that pass testing. Until then man is innocent until proven guilty.<br>  <br>  “In climate research and modelling, we should recognize that we are dealing with a coupled non-linear chaotic system, and therefore that long-term prediction of future climate states is not possible.” IPCC 3AR (Section 14.2.2.2, p. 774)<br>  <br>  Even the IPCC dont claim to have found any changes in climate attributable to man made induced warming. Anyone who claims otherwise is an alarmist.<br>  <br>  “The fact that the global mean temperature has increased since the late 19th century and that other trends have been observed does not necessarily mean that an anthropogenic effect on the climate has been identified. Climate has always varied on all time-scales, so the observed change may be natural.” <br>  (Houghton et. al., 2001, IPCC, 2001)|`|OtKCAeQZaa	People do not under stand nor will they. I tell you the truth and when the time comes you will know what you have read here was the truth. The earth is slowing shifting, that is causing this so call global warming. The earth will continue until it does a full shift. Were there shell be a new north pole and south pole. Our world will change as we know it to day for you will witness it unless you live in a danger zone. Remember it will cause the oceans to cover land that has never been covered up yet new ocean bed some cities will be under water. Which country will be in the deep freeze meaning the new north pole or south pole. Ye need not take my word you will see like ever one else. There is much suffering that is coming upon this earth for ever man women and child.. Set your mind to ever thing that will follow this rotation of the earth, and you will know what is to come . Starvation, earth quakes, wars thru out the world, diseases, total collapse of the economy, world in great depression. Death in the billions to ever man women and child. For the lord say that at his coming that he will cleans the earth of its wickedness and that only one quarter of the worlds population will be left when he comes and that is in less then 27 years, There is well over 6 billion people upon this earth will you be part of this quarter of population that will survive to what is coming. For my self I will be here at the second coming of our lord Jesus Christ. For there shell be many that will be with me .Sorry, but its the truth I lie not.. For this must take place for the lord lies not, for what the lord say must come to pass. Many shell parish for they heed not the word of the lord for they prepare not them selves.

But the AGW proponents will point to the one that came true.<br>  <br>  A stopped clock is right twice a day.|`|b0oCFZ5Maa	This can be difficult to answer, because weather naturally has a large variable component over time, and requires a long sampling period to make solid conclusions about. It then becomes difficult to determine whether observed changes are anthropogenic or natural.<br>  <br>  That said, there have been observed changes in climate in the last decades, primarily in polar and sub polar regions. For example:<br>  <br>  -In Antarctica, ice shelves such as the Wilkin's ice shelf last March have disintegrated. <br>  -Permafrost in Alaska is being reduced, which has accelerated coastal erosion and caused villages to face evacuation.<br>  -Also in Alaska, objective temperature measurements show an increase.<br>  -Mountain glaciers are in general retreat worldwide.<br>  -Satellite altimetry demonstrates that sea levels are in fact rising, at about 3 mm per year.<br>  -Oceans have become very slightly more acidic.<br>  <br>  Despite this, it can be tempting to argue that events such as major storms or a particularly hot summer are because of global warming. This may or may not be the case, but we cannot say because of natural variability in climate and weather systems, which can obscure long-term trends. The rate of change may stay constant, accelerate, or (less likely) decease as we move into the future.|`|zince8g1aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_global_warming" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_...</a><br>  <br>  Also worth a read is a Bush-commissioned report on climate impacts observed and expected in the U.S..

AA10058800	Of course it is. It is a hoax presented as a religion.The only difference between global warming and any other major religion is that its god is  the earth. The devil is anybody that doesn't agree with their ideology.<br>  <br>  Everything in every major religion is present in the AGW religion.  You've got the Garden of Eden (i.e., the pristine planet).  You have taking the bite out of the apple, sin, disobeying -- and that is what?  Cutting down trees! It's driving SUVs and so forth.  You've got destruction, destroying the planet which leads to what?  The apocalypse!  You have fear, which is a fundamental part of many religions: scaring you into behaving a certain way or else you are going to hell.  Global warming has fear: "You're going to destroy the planet! Your kids and grandchildren will have nothing. You will burn in hell on the surface of the earth because of global warming."  It's got guilt.  As you know, many major religions get what they want with guilt. They guilt people into behaving: "Do this, do that." This is the same thing: guilt for driving SUVs; guilt for having your air-conditioning on; guilt for having too large a "carbon footprint"; guilt for not buying carbon offsets, all this -- and it has salvation: accepting the blame.<br>  <br>  You are responsible for destroying the planet, but you can be absolved from this "sin" if you agree to higher taxes and roll back your lifestyle -- and let others in positions of government tell you what to do and when to do it and where you can live and can't live and how big your house can be, and all these things.  That's how you absolve yourself of the sin.  You can also go around and buy little cars that won't make a bit of difference in the environment, but you will feel better and you will be absolved of your sin.  You can carry your own little bags to the grocery store rather than using paper bags or plastic bags.  You will not be making one bit of a difference to the earth's climate, but you will feel better because you will be told you are saving the planet and preventing the apocalypse.  You can be told to do any number of these things.  You can change your light bulbs to compact fluorescents. You can use ethanol -- which is causing rising prices and food shortages all over the world -- but you can feel better about that because you are somehow polluting less, and then you can start criticizing people who don't believe this and you can become an evangel! You can become a preacher! You can become a priestess -- and you can condemn the sinners who are not paying attention.  Every aspect of every major religion is right in the middle of global warming.  <br>  <br>  Global warming is nothing more than a disguised liberal plot to advance their politics, and is simply a masked and camouflaged way to get liberals to where they want to be: power over as many aspects of your life as possible.|`|zince8g1aa	Global warming denial is a cult, with the following general code:<br>  <br>  1.

Experimental even.  Asking farmers to stop producing what people eat now and asking them to go out on a limb without government support.  I can see both sides of the argument, but can not see the way forward unless you have money, time and more support.  I want to try it in a small way, but love the food I eat (onions, carrots, swede, turnips, radish, lettuce) I have apple trees and fruit bushes so far.

aWTo9K22aa	Launching nuclear waste into the sun is actually a serious proposal that a lot of people are proponents of. The obvious drawback is, the only way to get it there is to send it up in a rocket, and sometimes, rockets blow up. This means deadly waste would be showered over a huge area of land, a situation much worse than we already have. <br>  <a href="http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/factsheets/doeymp0017.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.ocrwm.doe.gov/factsheets/doey...</a><br>  <br>  Carbon sequestration is another idea a lot of people take seriously, but by the sheer volume of carbon we emit, it would not make sense to put it into space. Indeed, we would be spitting out more carbon via the rocket fuel to lift it out of here than there would actually be in the cargo hold of the rocket--not to mention it would be extraordinarily expensive. <br>  <br>  Carbon sequestration mostly refers to burying it deep under the ocean, inside of old oil wells, underground in the form of charcoal, etc. The problems are mainly that there is no really an efficient way of capturing carbon dioxide, and no really good place to permanently put it where we can be sure that it will not leak. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capt...</a>|`|0TaFg8KGaa	Nuclear waste is an easily handled form of glass that emits radiation for only a few hundred years, not worth the expense to launch out of earth orbit. <br>  <br>  Spent nuclear fuel on the other hand is an extremely heavy (most is the density of lead) many thousands of year lasting hazardous material stored in the same metallic tubes that were used in the reactor.<br>  <br>  In the US, the latter form of nuclear material is found scattered across the country at individual power reactors, stored in dry concrete casks; hundreds of thousands of tons, too.<br>  <br>  Making nuclear waste from spent nuclear fuel is not done in the US, yet, and requires commitments to a closed loop fuel cycle where uranium is treated as a precious commodity and plutonium as a potential fuel source (civilian). Uranium is currently and always has been the cheapest part of running a nuclear power reactor.<br>  <br>  Spent fuel storage costs are traditionally born by the utilities but that is changing as lawsuits are filed against the government for not having ready a national spent fuel storage facility (Yucca Mountain, construction paid for from electricity dollars, research to show its not the best idea, your dollars).|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	I am a retired NASA Eng. and back then it saw costing about $ 20.000 for each lb.The plants are taking care of the CO2 and doing a food job. So there is no such thing as corbin footprint.|`|0KmJwYunaa	It always amazes me at how most people can simply not comprehend the scale of astronomical distances.   The Sun is very very very far away, so far that it takes light from the Sun, 8 minutes to reach us.   Yes, it's our nearest star and yes it's possible to get there but the effort is enormous, why would we put that much effort for waste.   Any such attempt will likely cost us more in energy than any reasonable expectations of benefits.<br>  <br>  Also, most Nuclear reactors are actually designed as part of a weapons program hence generating very radioactive by-products.   There are very few truly civilian nuclear programs and the reactors designed from those programs don't have the same environmental issues.   The CANDU reactor from Canada can actually operate on natural uranium (designed to do so in event of a disruption of enriched uranium supplies due to politics) and the spent fuel being less radioactive than the natural uranium does not require special containment.   The CANDU reactor can also run on the spent fuel rods of other reactor designs, a good indication of how wasteful the other designs really are.   Of course, that's not to say that the CANDU can't produce weapons grade plutonium,  India delayed the construction of their CANDU by insisting on various modifications throughout the construction process, as it turns out, those modifications were to enable the production of weapons grade plutonium hence leading to their atomic bomb.   There isn't any reason why the production of nuclear waste can't be addressed here on Earth provided we can keep the military requirements out of it.<br>  <br>  Besides, why would we want to chunk millions of tons of Earth into the Sun.   It would be a one way trip, and we may need that carbon or uranium in the future.   Carbon is a very useful element and is the basis of life.   It would be better to take the energy involved in blasting it into the Sun and convert it back into something useful such as hydrocarbon fuels or carbon nanotubes.<br>  <br>  If you think that rocketing waste into the Sun is a good idea, then why don't you come to my place, pick up my trash and carry it on foot to a landfill in China.   Don't forget your swimming trunks, the Pacific will be quite the swim.|`|AA11932246	Do you have any idea how much it costs to put stuff into space?<br>  <br>  Several thousand dollars per kilogram of payload (and if the rocket uses RP-1 as it's fuel it'll emit a lot of CO2, of course we don't exactly do many space launches so the environmental effects of space flight are pretty much limited to periodic die offs in the lakes around the shuttle launch pads).<br>  <br>  As for nuclear waste, better to just recycle it so that we get to use that 99% which current reactors don't use before we bury it in a place with nice stable geology.  Given the results of Oklo (natural nuclear reactor a couple of billion years ago) we can probably justify being pretty reckless about where we bury the nuclear waste but there's so little of the stuff that we can afford to go overboard with safety and ensure that the stuff won't be escaping until it has decayed to nothingness (nuclear waste is pretty stable and also becomes less dangerous the longer you leave it).<br>  <br>  Although some components of nuclear waste might be useful, Sr-90 releases a lot of heat and would be a good RTG material, less efficient than Pu-238 but a lot cheaper and with cheaper launchers might replace Pu-238 for outer system space probes.|`|viMAqdxxaa	Hahahaha . Now dumping waste in outer space ???<br>  <br>  Not good enough to contaminate our air , our ocean , the health of our future generation ? Outer space is next ??? How about fill it up with nuclear waste and when future generation has to move to the moon and other planets because the earth is no longer inhabitable , their spaceship will have to get pass a sea of radioactive waste in space .<br>  <br>  How about not producing such nasty waste to start with ? There are heaps of renewable energy available . People use to dump waste in the ocean because they think it's big and it'll be gone and out of sight and be rid of . See how polluted it is now ? Whales in arctic ocean have such high heavy metal level , their carcasses are classified as toxic waste ! Everybody put a grain of sand in the ocean and through many generations , the sea level will rise !|`|w4BuLzhqaa	I honestly think it sounds great, but as far into pollution and such as we are, it may be quite impossible to do this. However, I believe anything is possible. If we could manage to do this, it of course wouldn't reverse the environment, but it would fix it at least in the slightest. And, if we fix the environment, the economy benefits. You should go to the government with this.|`|dtsN7Oqraa	If you believe in global warming then yoiur dum I'm in advanced placement environmental science, I did that lil carbon footprint thing, I got about 80 eaths to support everyone if they were all like me.<br>  <br>  TBH I was haopin for a few thousand, I drive about 3 diff SUV's global warming is BS and your stupid as hell to belive in it|`|FZmu6Pm9aa	It's impractical to do this with radioactive materials since we'd have to launch them out of Earth orbit (very expensive) and there is the risk the launcher would fail as Dawei noted and contaminate a lot of real estate. And people. At some point we may have space elevators or other means to do this cheaply and safely but it's more likely we'll find new uses for what we now consider waste so I'd hesitate to get rid of it for good.<br>  <br>  Carbon sequestration is not complex, they are already seeding the south oceans with iron oxide to stimulate the growth of algae. That algae sucks up a lot of CO2 but I'm not sure this is wise since it might be difficult to reverse and the people doing it are the very same people who squawk if someone dams a river and harms any nearby mice and that's very small-scale compared to this project. <br>  <br>  Essentially all you need to do is harvest the lumber in many of our forests and then store that lumber, ideally in the form of buildings and new products. Require lumber companies that cut the trees to replant and you lose a lot of CO2. Mature trees emit as much as they they take in but growing trees absorb a lot of CO2 and retain it until they rot or are burned. Which is why storing them is essential. Besides, trees are nice and yet lumber is nice, too, why not have both?<br>  <br>  CO2 of course is not a problem, levels have been 10 times higher than they are now during an ice age and it will take us until at least 2250 to even double the current level. A lot longer to go up 10 times as high as it is now. <br>  <br>  This is another doomsday warning, it's gone from from ice age to zero population growth and pollution to Y2K to warming. Pollution is lower than it was in the past and at some point we'll have tiny robots scavenging our landfills for fresh resources which will reduce that problem even more. No doubt we'll find ways to remove as much CO2 as we want but only if we have the wealth and industrial ability to do so, crippling both isn't the way to succeed.<br>  <br>  Even if you die you have a carbon footprint since you are a carbon-based lifeform like nearly everything else on Earth. If you really worry about this then plant or sponsor the planting of some trees, don't buy any carbon credits since all they do is keep underdeveloped areas (and people) poor.|`|npBCankMaa	there is no way to sequester CO2 cost effectively.  To recover the CO2 from a power plant (coal/natural gas/oil), you'd have to double the size because 1/2 the energy generated would be used to capture and pump the CO2 into the ocean.  And all power plants would have to be beside the ocean.<br>  <br>  The cost of the CO2 sequestration system is 50% the cost of the power plant it sits beside.  Net effect all electricity would more than double in cost.

That is why the subject is typically polar bears drowning or other made up stuff like droughts or more severe weather.

I think a good method might be to compare them to the hypocritical, indulgence selling preists whose excesses led to the creation of protestantism, with fun festivities like the 30 year war and 100 year war. The problem is, your classmates likely won't know about these earlier hypocrites, and you'd need to describe the follies of that era, before they'd understand the comparison. On the plus side, the history lesson might impress your teacher.<br>  <br>        The general outline is: Many preists at the time were drunken whoremongers, who sold "indulgences"( carbon credits), which were like a "get out of purgatory free" card, available to those who paid. Knowledge of the bible was restricted to the preists ( similar to the way news media presents no facts, only scare stories about AGW).<br>  They also persecuted those who didn't beleive (witch burnings may have been related to crop failures- little ice age?). The popes (al gore)were wealthier than the devil, and were much involved in politics - selling influence (france created their own pope, because the original sided with others - there was two popes for a long time).<br>  <br>        You can see the similarities that these pompous fanatical hypocrites have to each other. The only problem, as far as satirizing by comparison, is that too much explanation is required. but if you start with an essay about the era, many might be interested?. Really, history is stranger  than fiction - if someone made this stuff up, it'd be too incredible. <br>  <br>       My idea: A pope, flying in by jet to punish carbon users, with burnings at the stake. Non - believers required to wear plastic bags over their heads "to protect the faithful", unless they paid for carbon credits (indulgences). Non believing scientists being tortured by the inquisition until they recant.  Perhaps a "Martin Luther" (renegade preist who founded protestantism) character, who objects to the public being kept ignorant, and propounds a list of objections to the way the church is run. Perhaps compare the disastrous economic effects to the wars, which made europe a hellish wasteland.<br>  <br>       Like I say, too much explanation required to be very funny. But the teachers the one giving out grades. Make sure he's not a "warmist".
