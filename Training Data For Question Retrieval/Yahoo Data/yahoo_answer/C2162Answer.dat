AA11706004	No, the vga port on your laptop is to attach a external monitor or a projector.   It's video out only.|`|qbmkMWqeaa	no, sorry, the vga connector on your laptop is to connect it to a monitor. It's output, not input.        You could try a tv tuner card that has inout connectors...but why?|`|hHQIUrNjaa	sorry, i have ps3 with HDMI and optical out built in. get a ps3 i dont answer 360 ?s

GQ0YxYAOaa	Because people are idiots and don't know that the numerical system was dropped after CoD4 and there will never be a CoD5. Just CoD Modern Warfare 2|`|tcFAk5jFaa	I can say that i say COD 5 instead of WAW because saying world at war everytime is tiresome and redundant.  Saying COD 5 is a bit more interesting of a title and its easier to say over and over again.  At least thats how i think of it.  And btw its the fifth major COD title from treyarch/infinity ward.|`|Jm8au5qfaa	Because it's the fifth major one and many people have bought them ever since COD1.|`|vi76RRLSaa	BEcause Call of Duty 5 is the fifth campaign in the Call of Duty series. Sure, there are expansion packs.. but I'm talking about CAMPAIGN's here... anyways Call of Duty 5 is technically Call of Duty World At War.....    And nobody knew what CoD was until CoD4 was because they just weren't reconized a lot, and didn't have many commercials. Now in my opinion, the older Call of Duties are way better.|`|80vFuZrqaa	i would have to say it is one of the better known games of the nine and since it has just came out after call of duty 4 people assumed that it was the 5th installment. but i prefer to call it cod:waw|`|hHQIUrNjaa	BC there are only 5 CODs the other ones are like COD1 with a few adjustments. COD5 is a whole new thing, thats y.|`|ifNqPNCVaa	Its just a common mistake made by 90% of everyone who plays the latest Call of Duty. I know its annoying but they're stubborn and we'll just have to put up with it.. :(|`|yOX6kpCvaa	Probably because on the major systems like Xbox and Playstation this is the 5th installment of the series. The PC ones were never as renound as these ones. Also, people on Xbox Live/ PS Network are not going to go around saying wanna play Call of Duty: World at War? or Call of Duty: World at War is amazing! It just makes more sense all around if you ask me. Its just like the phrases lol, ttyl all that stuff, its just easier and everyone understands what you are saying so it shouldnt matter. I dont know anyone that would say which one is Call of Duty 5???

There are two main kinds of people when it comes to achievements: people who don't care about them because they only play to have fun, and people who want to unlock them because of the challenge involved in getting them.

I'm sure there are other great ones out there but you'll just have to go and try them out for yourself.|`|CXoYZGRoaa	Left for Dead, Reisedent Evil 5, Gears of War, Gears of War 2, Halo 3. Call of Duty 4|`|Lgf2ARppaa	halo 3 is really good but I like 007 golden eye rouge agent gears of war are really fun to|`|tuy06F5Jaa	If you want to play split screen, there are a couple good fps games that you can buy : Rainbow Six Vegas 1-2, Army of Two, Gears of Wars 1-2, Halo 3 and Ghost Recon : Advance Warfight. But if you have the chance to play over Xbox Live, there's a couple titles that you can consider, im thinking of Call of Duty 4 witch is pretty fun in co-op. Other then that games like  Saints Row 1-2 can also be played co-op online and its pretty sweet since its a game pretty similar to Grand Theft Auto IV.|`|rzziFiusaa	halo 3  gears 2  army of 2  all have excellent splitscreen coop|`|5NRDkqajaa	Left for Dead, Reisedent Evil 5, Gears of War, Gears of War 2.|`|5gnGsqnnaa	Left 4 Dead is awesome, four players vs. 10,000+ zombies = COOL
AA10025824	No, not on your birthday.  Any special like that is only going to apply for the person who's birthday it is.  Disneyland and Free don't mix.|`|kqyANOfsaa	i am pretty sure but i can double check and get back in 5 mins just put my answer has the best answer plz|`|9NpXU7D2aa	NO.   the promotion is only for the birthday person. everyone else must pay regular price to get in.   and you must bring proof that its your b-day that day. (goverment issued ID, passport, or birth certificate)|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Nope.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Really think about it. Why would they let the rest of your family in for free?  That wouldn't make any sense. They give the birthday person a one free day into one park only. The fact that the birthday person isn't going to come alone is the way they are making money.|`|AA10214265	Unfortunately no. The free Birthday admission is only for the person who's birthday it is and is only valid on their birthday. You can't get a ticket for use another day, and you can't get free admission for anyone else in your family.    BUT    If you have an Annual Pass, one of the options instead of free admission (pointless, since you can already get into the park with your Pass) is a set of up to 6 fastpasses for various attractions for your and your group. Another option is a free admission ticket to be used up to one year later, a ticket that has your name printed on it and cannot be transferred to anyone else (they DO check ID at the gate to ensure the ticket matches the person).|`|kjvGggH6aa	Only if they celebrate the same birthday!!!|`|nkU7m16Daa	not unless they share a birthday with you. you have to show proof it's your bday|`|UE1evlTlaa	No, you cannot get the rest of your family in for free on your birthday. BUT, what you can do, is pre purchase your Disneyland tickets for EVERYONE (including yourself) and then instead of getting the free ticket, you have three other options you can do:    1) Get an unlimited Fastpass to use in the park (for you and up to 5 guests!) So, your family could use this with you!    2) Get a Birthday Fun Card to use in the park, which is around $75 in value. You can buy merchandise throughout the park's stores.    OR 3) You can get another Magic Your Way Base Ticket to use any day between this years Bday and next.    I think the FastPass option could be cool to use with your entire family, that way they can all kind of share on your birthday. So, I would go ahead and prepurchase for your entire group (including you) and then do that option.
TY96YpbZaa	No, you can't.|`|kqyANOfsaa	yup|`|a8XqzmhCaa	No you can't, its for people 13 and over, so no they don't allow it.

NWYdIIMHaa	I assume that you are wanting to purchase items to make cards or projects with for that you can go to the links below.    My first choice would be Stampin Up! I've been a customer for over 10 years. I really like their line of products because their color line includes 48 exclusive colors which coordinate beautifully. Their line also includes a neutral palette of colors as well as 6 colors which will only be available until June 30th which are called In Colors.     These colors go across their entire line - card stock, ink, markers, ribbon, and they also carry in their line a good selection of packages of Designer Series Paper which uses their colors and all of which have designs on both sides. They also have what are called Simply Scrappin Kits which include solid card stock, decorative paper which is double sided, and coordinating card stock weight stickers. These Simply Scrappin kits do not have to be used in a scrapbook. They can also be used to make cards.    The second link below will take you to Split Coast Stampers. There you will find all kinds of ideas for cards, different kinds of projects you can make with your card stock and techniques. There are a lot of stamping companies that advertise on their web site as well which carry their own line of card stock, ink, and decorative papers.    If you are looking for finished projects to purchase then you want to go to the 3rd website below.     I hope you found this helpful.|`|CshyPuGAaa	i think it is called crafts.com.  good luck.
154dzJ1Faa	What part of the world are you?  I know many machines were only sold in England, or were made in Japan, or some companies have now been taken over by others.  You may find what you need here: http://www.knittingmachinerepairs.co.uk/  This company is located in Norwich.    The KnitMaster is serviced by Silver Reed, so you might be able to find needles from them (or those may even fit your machine).  Right now, there is only 2 or 3 companies that are still making machines, and some of the old ones are just not going to have any replacement parts.|`|mYfkJFTVaa	I agree with the girl. Good luck      http://www.toboc.com/Exporter.aspx?pid=6...|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	Check ebay, amazon.com or just google your machine to see if you can find anyone who can get you needles. Sometimes you can find someone somewhere who has the same thing shoved in a closet somewhere with perfectly good needles.

vMXk9ohSaa	When my kids had to do this in elementary school, we just used different sized cardboard boxes and other junk from around the house (like an old motherboard from a trash computer) and then duct-taped it together so it was silver colored.  You can also get insulation tape that's a shiny chrome color, too.      Look around the house for objects that can be used - like a piece of spiral wire from an old notebook (antenna) or brass thumbtacks (or colored plastic ones) for buttons.  The "working" parts just means the arms or legs can move.  Hinge the arms to the body with a huge brad between the two parts so they move independently.   Whip out the hot glue and you're SuperMom!
mOTCr8Pxaa	http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-dp/attack...  http://www.serebii.net/pokedex-dp/speed....    Route 222 the fisherman and rich boy on the west end of the route. Be sure to switch out if your pokemon can't take them on aas the pokemons levels are over 50. That's where I train for attack. For speed I usually give it ten carbos and train at the valley windworks and route 212.|`|Pw1y449Daa	Give your weavile a power bracer (16 points at battle park) if your training atack and a power anklet (16 points at battle park) for speed.    Train on Bibarels for attack cuz there really easily to appear and they give 2 evs. And if you want them to always appear, use a PokeRadar. Bibarels can be found almost anywhere. I usually train on Bibarels just south on Solaceon town.    Train on Staravias, Pichus, and Pikachus in the trophy garden for speed. Staravias and Pikachus give 2 evs.    Good luck with your training!|`|w4qS66aqaa	speed - Here are some spots:    Staravias at spring path  Route 205, fisherman Andrew.  He has 6 magikarps. with the power anklet, it's 30 evs per battle and with pokerus+anklet, it's 60.    attack - A good spot is  route 212 (the rainy one). There are both Kriketune and Bibarel that give you 2EV's per kill.|`|dFTr5IPwaa	attack, great place is lake acuity. go there, and use super rod. the only two pokemon you hook are seaking and gyarados, both of which give 2 attack EVs.    speed - route 205, fisherman andrew, as someone else has said.    these are the two places i used, and it took me about 20 minutes to get 252 EVs with pokerus and power anklet etc

If your not totally into first person shooters, than you could try playing something like fable 2 or some other  game.    If you ask me the only good game on wii is Zelda.

RTzJhnBSaa	...Do you mean the old guy? I think you need to find his Wingull.    Or the Captain guy? First, you need to get a number of badges and complete quests until Team Aqua/Magma shows up and then invades the museum. Then you need to beat them. After you've gotten to Lilycove City, it should be open.    Hope this helps! Good luck!
RjGtp41Zaa	Nope. Can't copy paste.
RTzJhnBSaa	I'm also pretty excited! I like playing Sims in my free time. It's amusing to see what they'll do.    I've seen that they've added new careers and updated the graphics by a lot! They've also got an interesting new set of features to customize Sims this time around, such as new varieties of clothes and hairs. And it seems like there's a way to customize colors any way you want, so that's really awesome! You can even give Sims their own personalities like good, evil, lazy, silly, and more! And finally being able to choose different kinds of weights that aren't really thin, middle, or really fat. Now people can be a little chubby or kinda skinny!    The best feature I've seen however is the open neighborhood. You can finally go OUTSIDE your home area and visit other Sims! This is so awesome, since you can have one family of Sims meet others. Great for making certain families you made meet the ones in the game or other families you've made!    As a whole, it's looking really good! I just hope this time you can actually control your pets (whenever the expansion comes out). That, and I'm looking forward to new items. Maybe game consoles instead of just computers? Perhaps new sorts of fun objects other than pool and darts? And different kinds of ornaments other than hanging things up or rugs or statues? I hope so!    What about you? What are you hoping for?|`|Tj1ubrN4aa	You don't have to be stuck in one lot!!! You can walk around the whole lneighborhood with your friends, or whatever! You can see your SIms at jobs, and the sims have realistic Facial features, I'm so excited! It comes out February 20th!|`|hbB9DENFaa	SOOOOOOO Excited ive been waiting like forever for this game!!!!|`|9y1uYUm3aa	i guess so|`|bx63jJVnaa	I'm really excited about it because I like to focus on one family but I want that family to be able to interact with other people not just those that live in their house.  Now that sims can go to other parts of the city and to other people's houses it is going to make it easier for me to be able to stay with one family but use other people I create in the city.  I love that there is a young adult function too since I hated making 20 somethings teens or adults now I can give them their actual age.  I stopped playing the Sims 2 before all the expansions because I hated that I had to get off one family go on another family and that family would be complety different then how it was left off if one of them had visited my familys.  Now the world is seamless and every family will change to reflect your gameplay.|`|tNSkgDMzaa	WOOTT    i guess they will add alot more features like make your own city  you can play in heaven instead of you know you have to start over|`|n9QA4nbIaa	I LOVE SIMMS SOOO MUCH,.  I cant wait and yeah i think it'll be good.|`|GBbzQ68haa	I am super excited! I can't wait! I have a question about it though so check it out if you can! The differences from the 2nd one are: You can walk around the whole neighborhood without that pause while it loads a new lot, everything you do affects the other people in town significantly, in create a character you can choose character traits such as party animal, paranoid etc. and so much better stuff! I hope I helped!

0ct0X9Hkaa	Yes, if this happened to you before and you were able to send it in to microsoft then when they sent it back to you then they should have renewed your warranty which i believe is three years for this specific problem. if the three years is up, or if you opened your xbox in any way than they will not fix it without charging you.|`|8zE2gjReaa	you can send it in to Microsoft and they will send you another one. if you dont know just go to the xbox website and click on support and it will tell you what to do. You might also want to call|`|tNSkgDMzaa	it happened to me on Christmas =[    but if your warranty is good they will fix it or you can trade it back for a new one lol|`|E4lCNXPjaa	Be patient but persistent with the tech support person when you call in. Sometimes they will not acknowledge that you need a repair unless you say that it constantly is giving the three red lights. That's what I did last xbox. Hope that helps!

Uh...I'm not so good w/computer games since mine's really slow and w/e, but I guess anything around World of Warcraft and Runescape to something like Fallout would work for anyone who loves RPGs.    Next, I guess it's safe to suggest Final Fantasy. I'm not too familiar with the series, but I believe that there were a good number of enjoyable installments. I heard that a lot of people like FF:XII, but I think the favorite is FF:VII. (Correct me if I'm wrong please.)    As for the 360, I'd go with Fable 2. It's somewhat like an RPG, but it's a lot like the Sims too. However, it's interesting to say the least. You develop a character in which you want to be a good or evil "hero" (they never refer to you as a "villain") and you go on a long journey in a quest of vengeance (so much for being a "hero", lol) and for freedom. You can also customize your spells, fighting techniques, and weaponry. The part that's similar to Sims (which, in case you don't know, is a computer game in which you create little people {called Sims} that just live out normal lives...except you control everything around them) is the part where you can have relationships with townspeople and you feed your own "hero" certain foods to determine the age and weight of your character. These things are minor and you don't have to worry much about them, but relationships score you certain achievements, so it's a good idea to do at some point in the game. I did the achievements really quick and just kept going with the quest. The game is fun as a whole overall.    Lastly, you might want to check out the Tales series, like Tales of Symphonia. I hear that it's a good series too. Don't know much myself, but my friend loves it.    That's all I've got. If you want, you can just rent the 360 games first to try them and see if you really would like them. And for the PC, call a friend and ask him/her about it. Or, you can just go buy the games. Whatever you feel like. Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|Q2ZCrPGCaa	God Quest - The Chosen Ones    http://godquestonline.com    It's free and fun. Try i out if you want.

Always make sure you know where it is when she comes home from school. If you don't watch where she puts it down then you might not be able to find it later. Have her go to school everyday or her grades can drop. If you're ok with cheating, just go into build mode, click on the sledgehammer tool and delete it. It's totally up to you.|`|4Vrr57qmaa	don't let her miss school, and she has to study.

Sony has officially confirmed that the price of the PSP Core Pack in North America will be $169.99 effective immediately, a $30 drop from the normal $199.99 price that has been the handheld's standing price point. Despite now entering its third year of life, this is the first official price cut on the PSP, not including the Core Pack's release.     Along with the price cut, Sony also announced two new additions to the PSP line of Greatest Hits titles: Daxter and Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror. These games will now be available for a mere $19.99 each.     SCEA president and CEO Jack Tretton said that the price cut and new Greatest Hits titles "reflect our ongoing commitment to supporting and expanding the PSP community." After word of not-so-happy retailers and years of mixed reactions to the handheld and most of its games, Sony must hope that this cut does indeed help expand the PSP user base.

However, unless the game itself has a multi-language option (which most of them don't unfortunately) you won't be able to change the language.     Anyway, you should just wait for Pokemon Platinum to be released in the US on March 22.

Definitely worth the money.      I found the difficulty level just right.  Hard enough that you have to really think about some of the puzzles but not too hard that you want to throw the DS out of the window.

They take 20% if you want cash back, usually its better for store credit and if you have an edge card you get an extra 10% on your trades.

cJuxEFQXaa	They both use the same engine, so both the graphics are pretty much the same. It all depends on your taste. They have different themes: WWII and Modern Warfare.     In my opinin, I would personally buy Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare because there are so many WWII games that they are really starting to wear on me.    Modern Warfare brings a whole new perspective on Modern War FPS games because of the high quality graphics and amazing game play.There are helicoptors, rappelling, you get to control some huge mortars  and miniguns on an aircraft gunship, there's night vision, advanced realistic weapons, grenade launchers, red sights, silencers, and so MUCH MORE!!   They even have a bonus mission at the end called Mile High Club, and plus, there's going to be a SEQUEL to this game, called Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, set to be released in Fall, 2009, so it'd be best to get this game and play it so by the time the sequel comes out, you'll understand the epic story of this AMAZING game!!    The only thing I'll say about Call of Duty:WAW is that it has a more fun multiplayer (though it's very similar to COD4, and that it has a brand-new, unique Nazi Zombie mode, where you fight relentless hordes of Nazi Zombies, gaining points to upgrade your defense and buy new weapons to outlast the zombies for as long as you can.    Verdict: BUY Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare!!!|`|HA8Ehs3Gaa	Get 5. it is more fun|`|A9TbEueYaa	well they're both cool but i like 5 because its more fast paced   and don't know about other people that's just my opinion|`|0F3MreEaaa	ok listen take my advise if your more into world war2 then get 5 but if u want todays fighting guns and ect. then get 4...I like cod4 better i have both but cod4 is better (to me)|`|qbmkMWqeaa	I'm a little bored with the WWII fighting game...so for me CoD 4 was perfect...some real "WOW" moments.

Next time your sims go to this shop they will be able to purchase a cat/dog from the appropriate stand.|`|TofmqjUaaa	Well You should really update to Sims 2... it has A LOT of choices for pets and clothes, furniture, rooms and neighborhoods. Even game graphics. They stopped issuing the Pet Expansions for Sims 1 because it is a VERY old model. If you want to get more out of your Sim game, get Sims 2.

AA10192949	Both are cool enough to satisfy your appetite for cut n clash games.    Ninja Gaiden Black was a revolution when it appeared on the classic XBOX. It took the action/adv gaming to a totally new direction. Brilliant game.    Ninja Gaiden 2 is the predeseccor, equally good in action (and even better in a few aspects) but storyline is not as good as that of Ninja Gaiden Black.    Still both are worthy play.    Hopefully this helps    Cheers!!
rsBEXUkNaa	Hello. Ive been playing WoW for almost 4 years now. i frequently play on private servers. Ive even had my own. You will not get caught. Blizzard really does not go after you. There is almost no way they can tell either. unless you email them saying "Hi blizzard i play on a private server!". its realativly safe to talk about private servers on retail. Ive done it. i suppose if someone reported you it would be possible.. as for the realm list again they cant tell if youve been on a private server... an easy way to get it back to the origanal is just delete it. when you launch world of warcraft it will be replaced with the origanal.  People may tell you "ooh noo youll get baaannn" But you wont. honestly. as for the 10 points thing i have no idea how this works either hahaha. Have fun.
caOfuKl5aa	I would suggest talking to her.  Let her know that you would really like to play games again & ask her what you can do to earn that privilege back.  If you come at her like an adult, she should respect that.  If you let her know that you are willing to work on things (the things you did to make her take them away), she should be willing to let that happen.  Good luck!|`|Xc86jul1aa	BEG!

4N7uERy1aa	you have to load an earlier save cuz its considered a side quest not a main quest. if your done with the game, it wont let you exit out into the wasteland. thats y it helps to save before you finish the game so u can do all the side quests and explore.

I Suggest you take all his games away and sell it on Ebay. What kind of kid ask there mom or dad for a M rated Game? it's like asking for a playboy mag.|`|A9TbEueYaa	well theres nothing bad about playing the game and theres kids playing cod5|`|mExwY8jYaa	I think it would be fine, except for the fact that there is a lot of blood and dismembered body parts (much more blood than Halo). With the sex, I am level 20 and there have only been 3 suggestions of sex/interest. I've read that the screen just goes dark (relating to if you accept the person's offer in Moriority's).|`|jxpV13rTaa	if he has those games i imagine he would be fine. they are all M rated games (17+ to buy) so they are relativley violent. but if you think he can handle halo then fallout shouldnt be a problem at all|`|3Go9k05Zaa	Fallout 3 is no worse, to be honest, than Halo. The biggest worry would be online gameplay where people can say anything. But as a 12-year-old, he has probaably already heard most of that anyway. In Fallout 3, There is a few "Damn"s and S-words, some cursing, but that's not too big of a deal. I would say yes, if he's already played Halo. Plus, F3 is a GREAT game.|`|i4nwHekGaa	he should be fine, my son is|`|katIlecuaa	a 10 year old should be able to play fallout 3, the only games that a child should not play is a ao game... i would sugest even letting him get grand theft auto 4... the games are not bad unless they are rated AO(adults only) M only means 17... or mature|`|LecGV6exaa	first off there is no sex in fallout 3 at all not even sex noise but there is quite a bit of swearing and some pretty gruesome scenes. beyond that there a quite a few areas that made me almost wet myself and I'm 20 so it might freak him out a bit. I personally wouldn't let him play it but then again I don't know the kid or how well adjusted he is/ how well he keeps fiction apart from reality|`|qfbuwityaa	it depends on the child. Some children that age get night mares from stuff like that. and some enjoy it while others try and repeat it. So, it depends on the  game, maturity level of the kid, and the kid ingeneral|`|jjHUXkgTaa	The sex in the game isn't even as graphic as Fable 2 (where you can still hear noises). They just stand next to a bed after the screen fades to black. Honestly, there isn't even that much of an emphasis of sex in Fallout 3.    If they currently own Halo games then I'd say it wouldn't be that bad. There is a decent amount of blood when you target a certain part of an enemy's body in VATS.     Try watching some game-play videos at IGN.com
gKEbUVtfaa	The World Ends with you is the best choice. As long as you know how to watch two screens at once and use the touch screen you'll have no problem.|`|RTzJhnBSaa	The World Ends With You.

tmnSVMQsaa	I would buy call of duty 4. With this computer it wouldl run very smoothly. If you buy one of the very recent games the game such as fallout 3 , world at war, resistance 2 .etc may not run as well considering they are built for computers that require better graphics card and like 3.0ghz processer speed. Call of duty 4 modern warfare is a great game to play online and in story mode.|`|AA12146249	the 128 intergated video will cause alot of problem.about all newer games need min of 256mg.. its not upgradable either.. you can buy what you like. put you won't be playing newer games on anything other then low settings if at all.|`|rfB8G7skaa	Around 30, not much more.
rSh20Vj7aa	okay. look at the location on your map. and walk towards it (i started at Paradise Falls) then when you start getting to a mountainous region, stop and start walking northwest. then when you're directly west of the marker walk straight at it.     The actual entrance isn't south of the marker, it's actually slightly DUE WEST of the marker.     the entrance kind of looks like a small valley. which leads to a cave in the mountain the cave? Oasis.     good luck.|`|4N7uERy1aa	if you go to "dickersons chapel" theres a guy named the "drifter" which you can kill. after you kill him, search his body and he holds the location to Oasis which gets updated on your pip boy. its located far north. also he holds a very rare sniper rifle called "reservists rifle" its awesome.|`|z0S8syYGaa	yah i had the same problem. the path is ridiculously narrow and very hard to spot. I'm pretty sure that it's NW of the actual Oasis location marker on the map.  I just kind of walked along the mountain (about halfway up it) and just kept looking down for an opening.  Hope this helps!
AA12146249	you can spec out a good system from newegg.com with a quad core ,motherboard, 4gb ram, 512 video min 1gb would be better . for under $1000 that would run most games. the thing about custom PC is you can always upgrade pieces later.
tNSkgDMzaa	no  you can wear the pimp cloths the sporty cloths and i think that's it
GBbzQ68haa	It is a great game and all of my younger cousins have it (9 and younger) they all love it and it's rated teen because it has shooting. I think it should be suitable for him and a great thing. It has no blood because it's a star wars game! Most of them are aliens! Bottom line- Lots of shooting, no blood, great game! Hope I helped!|`|86VEYoDsaa	It looks fine to me.|`|Zo7IQX3raa	It's fine. As long as  hes not a crybaby..... (my seven year old brother has it)|`|AoDwbpTxaa	I have it myself, im 12 years old, and its fine. No bad language, the only reason its rated T for teen is because it has shooting.

Im sure he'll love it =]|`|hbB9DENFaa	Ya I Think Its Fine!|`|c8sqeza4aa	The rating boards have no idea how to rate.  Ya, that games fine.|`|yeIgCOZraa	it will be fine.  my 5 year old cousin plays it with me.|`|sRPuT4gcaa	Don't worry...That game is nicer than anything..."star wars"|`|7A4ilxi9aa	More than likely, star wars games are good for anyone that understands shooting people is bad.  That's likely the only objectionable content in the game.  Make sure he knows people aren't really good targets, and he'll be fine.|`|Hz9pKIIkaa	Yea. It sorta Ok. As long as his parents approves of it.  I Got GTA When i was 10.  Way Under Mature.
RTzJhnBSaa	Dunno.    Well, your favorites aren't always super awesome characters, so they're just meant to die to begin with, since the creators need something to drive the main/central characters and the players forward.    Look at it this way: the creators are killing your favorite characters, provoking a need for vengeance to spurt inside you. Suddenly, you start killing every bad guy that gets in your way and blasting through the game!    It's like motivation of some sort. A player wouldn't go that extra mile without the character death, so it's added in to provoke players to go that extra step.    But yeah, it's lame that B. Carmine died...AGAIN. Funny that they brought him back, but still sad that he died. But hey...he's probably got another thousand clones, so it's all good. As for Gaz...well, I can't think of much else other than the motivational thing. But it did work, right?    Anyway, you can just think of the times before they died or just disregard the death. If you like the character and play the game again to see him/her, then he/she's never really dead. The character just...stays in your heart...or something like that. Not sure if that's right, but hey, someone's gotta go...might as well be the funny/bada$$ ones to get people to keep going.|`|CdEpk9Inaa	IDK|`|DFwNXmDBaa	cool|`|Zo7IQX3raa	There EVIL! Lets kill them !:0|`|0c330dc5c7e321c8e8dfd2f50ecea522aa	they don;t hate you LOL but if they have a new chara they have to make room for it so they normally kill off a chara that isn;t really helping out the story. it isn;t you
6CMxmxTFaa	Its a fun game and will be fine for your child. Its has down sides though. Its addicting and can be very hard to pull your son off it. Just make sure you limit some play time and use parental controls you the account manage tab, to set playing time and other setting that will make it more fun and safe for him.|`|L0R92wWeaa	Take it from someone who has played: not to bad of game- actually its an awesome game- but if you want him to have a life-NO! I also started the game at age 13, and I haven't played for months. I love this video game, however, this is the problem. It's a virtual world, with many possibilities. Like seriously, theres continents, you have powers and abilities, and your always searching for the next quest or next dungeon. I have not played past burning crusade, (because I haven't played for months). But  from my experience, this was my life. I wouldn't be so concerned about the alchohol, and blood thing, as I would the obsession.|`|DSOJvIhtaa	Fun game. Play it first for youself. I'd suggest making it a 'reward' system for letting him play now. Kids can easily get addicted and spend way to much time on it. They do have parental settings that you can limit his play time on and filter 'adult' language.|`|ENhiINzuaa	It is a fine game for a 13 year old.|`|JWjq5iaXaa	It's not so violent, but don't let him play that game.. it will get him ADDICTED and he won't stop playing it. If you want him out of the house, don't let him play that game.|`|AoDwbpTxaa	Well, you can "drink" in the game because some shops sell "alchohol", its actually not the biggest of deal, it has pretty much nothing to do with alchohol except some things, but nothing influential. As for the blood, there's barely any of that too. It's a great game and very fun, but, keep in mind that he can easily get addicted.|`|BfZRnkw0aa	If you ask that question on this then oh yeah dont let him play it|`|7L7zpAT6aa	Just say no this could be the defining moment that chooses if your son will have a life or not.|`|Zo7IQX3raa	Get it! My two friends who are boys play it (there 11) and they talk about it NONSTOP! It gets annnoying but it sounds really fun! I would def. get it.|`|0c330dc5c7e321c8e8dfd2f50ecea522aa	it Wll be fien there si vilonce but compared to some console games it isn;t bad about like Final fnasy and tehr is never any blood maybe some liek a red slash but those are few an dfar betweena nd  you don't normal get alchol unless you are one a quest and if his chara drink it all it sasys is hes tispy and teh screen get blurry a bit that is it and that only happens norally in teh brew fest event oncea year but not sure when it is. I would say get the gma elay it abit yurself and decide. It is a good game I don't think he'l get any bad habits from it|`|6MMqlCfuaa	I would flat out say no and encourage him to only play console games.  Reason being World Of Warcraft, Guild Wars, Runescape, etc. are so time consuming and kids his age (I know a few.) Will become highly addicted to those games. reason being they never have an ending, and always get updated and given more challenges, that is how the companies like Blizzard, Jagex, etc. make there money from subscription cost, they keep there customers addicted, I strongly suggest if your son is really wanting to play Video Games, invest in a Wii/Xbox360/ or PS3 if you haven't already. The games on those consoles have endings and more challenging and funner in my opinion.  If you already have one, encourage him to play it instead! There is way more to life then being addicted to an MMORPG for all his Teenage years.     Hope this helped. :]    *~Kyle~*|`|kLXgrjISaa	If your son is asking specifically for the game, im sure he understands the content regarding the game.  If you feel like getting it for him just because you can, id probably vouch against it.    Like what everyone else said, its pretty addicting.  Theres a lot of social interaction, so theres really not a whole lot of protection regarding what older people would say.  The violence is mild compared to what other games can exhibit.    Plus, if its just the language that bothers you, there are some parental controls on it.  Just be sure to monitor the amount of time dedicated to the game, otherwise it may be the last time your son will want to leave the house.|`|iHjt2nWyaa	Get Guild Wars! There's no monthly fees, and it has WAY better graphics! Trust me on this one.|`|hwXxXn3baa	Probably not. There is alcohol, blood, violence, and even sexual gestures. You can de-cloth your character down to their underwear. I play but I'm an adult. It also costs a lot of money and if you don't have the parental controls on, some people talk about some really obscene stuff on there. Good luck with your choice! Try Guild Wars, it is like WoW but is much more suttle|`|Npi4QR7Maa	The game was made for teenagers like that.   Yeah you get to drink, but its no big deal. And the blood is no worse than in the legend of zelda.  The worst things in the game are the people online who sometimes use it for meeting people for virtual sex.   (no nudity, but you can type in anything you want your character to say.)|`|IxNQwrKYaa	World of Warcraft is an adventure game in which you become a hero in a fantasy world. You go from place to place performing quests and gaining experience. As your experience grows, so does your character, which allows your character to learn new skills and abilities. The quests you perform often require you to kill monsters or other characters, and yes, while you are beating them to a pulp, the violence, blood and gore can be graphic. There are also places where a character can buy simulated adult beverages, and it is possible for a character to become stone drunk from too much ale. And while the non-player characters (that is, the characters in the game that are controlled by the game itself) are generally polite and do not use profanity or other objectionable dialogue, this is not always true of the other players. These little details may make the game a little less desirable for parents when selecting it for their children.    On the other hand, there are a lot of good qualities about World of Warcraft that should be considered. A player must first create a character, which encourages creativity and planning ahead. The quests a character must complete to gain experience points requires the player to follow instructions, plan his actions carefully, and sometimes work with others to accomplish a particular task. As a character grows in experience, he learns new skills and abilities which the player must incorporate (or not) into his strategy.    To earn any decent amount of money in the game, which a character often needs to buy helpful weapons, armor and other equipment for his character, the character must learn and work on a profession or two, which will help him learn diligence, persistence and professionalism. As he becomes skilled in his profession(s), he must often learn salesmanship and cooperation to sell his wares and services. The items he makes with his professions can be sold either interactively to other player characters or at the auction house, which requires certain skills.    The game contains many dungeons, which are designed for groups of characters to enter and embark on dungeon-related adventures. This requires teamwork and cooperation as well as careful planning. Whether your son's character is a fighter, a magic user, a healer or whatever, a dungeon will require each character to perform specific functions and perform them well. If everyone works well together, the characters will all gain lots of experience points, score wonderful treasures, and make friends. If the characters do not work well together, things will work out badly for them.    Characters are encouraged to join guilds, which are groups of player characters who help each other out in various ways. Good guilds can enhance a player's gaming experience by giving him a pool of players who may be able to help him with game play or to run through dungeons or whatever. In return, he will be expected to help other guild members. This encourages cooperation and good people skills. A guild member can earn a good or a bad reputation depending on his behavior, so your son will learn to be on his best behavior at all times. If a player shows bad behavior, word gets around among the other players, and pretty soon no one will want to help him.    I don't know your son, so I cannot say for certain whether World of Warcraft will be a good game for him. If your son is generally a good person, knows the difference between reality and fantasy (habitual liars don't know the difference; just FYI), and knows that certain behaviors that may be okay in the game (murder, theft, drunkenness, etc.) are often NOT okay in the World of Reality, this should be a good game for him. If not, he may need to grow up a little first. Wish him good luck for me, and maybe we'll see him online in the future. - LJS|`|g7Y55FJVaa	theres no harm in playing world of warcraft...the blood in it is no different from any other games, as for the language people use theres a filter u can check on that will cut all the inappropriate languages out...world of warcraft can be an addictive game, but can be remedied by the parental filters in the account settings on the website (if u need to use it).|`|o1JGM5SWaa	It's a very good game. I play it a LOT... which is the main problem. The game is very addictive and I think your son should experience more social situations face to face before you allow him to play because I've played with a few people who socialize mainly through WoW and it's very sad. However, if you believe he's ready to interact with other people in this manner, go ahead. As a warning though, some people are pretty inappropriate and some can be rude and abusive.    While there is alcohol and violence in the game, it's not used in a negative way. The quests do involve killing things but in context with the storyline behind the game, its not obscene and there are many quests that ask you to retrieve things and even make peace with people. As for the alcohol, once a year there is a festival called Brewfest which is basically just Oktoberfest. Drinking the alcohol in the game will my the screen blurry, slur your speech and impair your ability to walk in a straight line. I found it amusing at first but trying to play while your character is smashed and you can't see anything can be a tad annoying.    The only reasons I see why someone would not let their child play is due to it being so addictive and that you have to keep paying to play. With the economy being the way it is, computer games may not be everyone's priority but if you begin to play too, that may change. I know keeping WoW for me is very important (it helps me keep in touch with old friends). As for addiction, just restrict how often he can play the game.    It's a great game and sorry for the long post.|`|YsBrTBmIaa	Yes I have played with other 13 year olds just fine in this game.  They usually don't make it to the end-game content where it would really annoy high-end players anyway ;)    Alcohol is based on drinks and stuff that you can drink inside the game , sold by certain vendors.  They don't ADVERTISE to drink or support drugs or alcohol, just makes drinking a little more fun in the game because your character cant run straight lol.    Blood - any 13 year old would want to see blood and I know I did when I was 13.|`|s5qxAWymaa	Long story short, World of Warcraft would be a good game for your son if you let it. There are parental control restrictions that you can put on his playing time, which I would recommend. I would also turn on the chat filters so he isn't exposed to some of the crude things people say online. There is blood and alcohol in the game, but it's not realistic. This is a fun, role-playing game that would be appropriate, in my opinion, for kids ages 10+. Just make sure he stays safe (doesn't give out his personal information) and limit his playing time so it doesn't take away from real life.|`|OWT9CO8oaa	Hey well.. im 14 (Fem) i've been playing WoW for around 2-3 years and in that time i lost alot of friends and my family noticed that I wasn't socializing with them much so I quit about 3 weeks ago. Yea it is a fun game and it did occupy me for those years but when I look back on myself I missed out on alot of things and my relationship with people became so bad that i would only occasionally say 'hi' to people.  I maxed myself out on WoW and ended up having 2 lvl 80's and about 3 lvl 70-75's. I guess the reason I played WoW was to escape the real world issues. No one knows anything about you on WoW so I guess that made me feel alot better, not realising what was happening on the outside.    I still have friends that play WoW and they are CONSTANTLY talking about it which gets on my nerves but then, that's how I used to be.  My mum ended up using the 'no more WoW' as a punishment/bribe if I didn't do something.  I guess the game all in all isn't bad but it's what happens to your social life.  Depends how well you think your son can limit himself.   Personally, I wouldn't get the game for him UNLESS you know he can limit himself and still make time for family and friends.       Good Luck with your decision!|`|HI5ebR0caa	I'm a 13 year old boy and I play it. There is some foul language from the other players, mostly trash talking. Nothing else is really bad. Not bloody battles or nudity. The only other thing is that he will devote a lot of time to it if he likes it enough. The alcohol part is just in drinks and you see the name and a little picture of a bottle. Nothing to be worried about.|`|wC5MrVOSaa	The ESRB rating is true: there are both blood and alcohol in the game.  I play often, and off the top of my head I can't think of anything very violent at all in the game.  There's very, very, very little blood, and most violence is fairly mild.  Your average cartoon with Tom and Jerry would be just as violent.  While PvP (player v. player) content can be very competitive, its not gory in any way.    The alcohol in WoW is worked into a few of the "holidays" such as "Brewfest" which is the WoW version of Oktoberfest.  However, when a character drinks the only things that happen are a blurry screen, and, eventually, trouble walking in a straight line for about 10-20 minutes. On one hand, this doesn't encourage drinking, on the other, it doesn't put a negative spin on drinking, as there's no drunk driving or anything in a virtual world.  If you think that your son has a pretty good grasp of the concept of drinking and it's real life differences, it shouldn't be a problem.    World of Warcraft, and most MMORPGs actually, have a very bad rap for being addictive.  While this can be true to some extent, it really does vary a lot from person to person.  If you have a person that has an addictive personality or a person with a desire to suspend reality by ignoring their circumstances and instead paying attention to a virtual world in which they're in shape, powerful, etc. then the game can become very addictive.    However, if you use the parental controls you can limit how many hours of play time is available per week, and maybe even per day.  I haven't checked out the parental controls since I control my own account, but they are there, and hard to circumvent.    One thing that makes MMORPG games better than conosle games is that there are many situations in the game in which you have to work with other people to get through quests or dungeons, which promotes teamwork and communication, which in my opinion is better than playing by yourself.  While this can never be better than face-to-face communication, teamwork skills are always good to have.    Also, if you yourself play video games it can be a lot of fun to play together.  I got my dad to start playing and now we both put some time aside to play together on Thurs evenings most weeks.  It's nice to do something with him, since now that I'm away from home I don't see him often.      What you should probably do is play the free trial for yourself, and get a glimpse of what the game is like.  This will let you make an informed, first-hand decision about whether or not the content is appropriate.    As for the addictive qualities, either monitor or limit his play time in game by using the parental controls, and, if you think that his social life is taking to hard a hit, talk to him about the fact that Real Life needs to come first.|`|5cjKxcSFaa	Ive been playing WoW for almost 2 years and I love it....im 23 and I have a REAL job , house , girl, friends, and life....occasionally I subsitute going out drinking to stay home and play, but i feel like thats apart of growing up ( strange i know ).  for your child i suggest monitoring his play and setting up a rewards system in order for him to play.  Ive seen many a young child spend his teens in a bedroom with his eyeballs glued to a monitor, but I blame that on bad parenting.  You must not allow your child to substitue sports, school, and real life for the video game.  Make it so that he can only play when he has free time.  Thats it.|`|wSaj838Yaa	I am 14 and I love the game. It is very addicting though. So if you do choose to, he might be addicted.|`|EE7w1Hf3aa	World of Warcraft is an amazingly fun game for boys his age. There is only one big downfall to it... ADDICTION if you do decide to get him the game I would recommend limiting the time he is able to play via the account management parental controls.     Pros:   Extremely fun thing to do.  Great thing to do if you have friends to do it with  Great time filler    Cons:  It is a bit pricey for all the discs and monthly fees  Can completely consume his whole life and when I say this I mean ditching school, staying up late, even trying to play at school, on top of playing litterally every hour he has of free time.(this is why you need to limit the times.)|`|jpuLzHpzaa	It is a very addicting game for most people i play and i was addicted but i broke it now i just play for maybe a few hours a day but some people can't break the addiction but if u set strict rules on playing it ya it is a good game.|`|X2L4LYxqaa	WoW in my opinion is the greatest game ever created and the content is perfectly fine for a 13yr old. With that said you should not get him the game because it is very time consuming, can be addictive and there are events in the game that literally take hours and its not fun to leave a group of people depending on you in the middle of it. He may be able to manage his time playing just fine and not blow off friends because of somethnig goin on in the game but i dont think i would take that chance.|`|sgDAOV3Qaa	Their is really no blood in the game, a few droplets here or their, their are alchohal refrences but only if the player chosses to go on with them.|`|hkMLRSgBaa	Well I'm a father of 3 and have played WOW myself.....I would say it is one of the hardest games to stop playing....It takes hours upon hours to get anywhere in the game.....There is a need for him to play with others to run dungeons so forth...You can meet some really odd people that is for sure.... As far as the teen rating yes it has blood but very tame compared to most game out there.. The drinking is more in fun then lkets get wasted.... If you have ever read a book with Dwarfs in it you know they love their beer as much as they love weapons... I would say it is a toss up if you should let him play or not....I know I won't let my 10 yo play that is for sure ...

uctxzjIIaa	Great Aether's primary hit location is directly in front of him, but it has a fairly limited range, only about 2-3 times the length of his sword. If you want to practice this, try using Zelda/Shiek for a while, as theirs is the same but with infinite range, then move back to Lonk/Toonlink, whose is the same but with a range range limit that is about 50% longer than Ike's.    Assuming you hit anyone with this, it will launch them into the air, and Ike will jump after them with his sword out. If he hits anyone on the way up, they will get knocked up to the original victim(s).    Then Ike will combo everyone he has hit with this, ending with a strong hit that is almost an automatic kill.|`|DfUPSplraa	Well the there is a trick when Ike lifts up his sword his sword goes behind him so if someone is behind you you can get him

It really depends tho on ur playing style. For example with ur deck u have in it dark factory of mass production but u dont run many normal monsters. If u wanna run normal monsters u wnaa lose sme of the effect ones and perhaps run skill drain in the deck as it won't effect u then, but will mess up most current decks. not a bad deck tho and i can c how it can work but a couple of minor ajustments and u should b even better. I would even still drop the mass production card and replace with pot of avarice or swords of revealing light. Oh and drop that call of the mummy, unless u replace all non-zombies with zombies.    P.S if u want help fixing any deck further give me a shout at godsaiyan@yahoo.co.uk and ill help. i run a few advance decks myself and shud get u in the riht direction. i can even give u a deck recipe or 2 if u tell me wot type of deck u may wanna make|`|huJP0fcIaa	great.  mine better =]

dDrTVXTFaa	considering you have only been playing for three months you are doing well, the only thing i would reccomend are structuring your deck, you seem to have a few elemental heroes in so maybe you could think of that, ive previously had one, they are very good. Your traps are good, maybe you could put a draining shield in, there are plenty of elemental heroe cards, use yugico.com and click advanced search and put elemenal hero into the section you want to check and read the effects, there are very good ones, other than the structure you are doing good, keep up the good work|`|zrKuaiDLaa	I think your deck is built on other cards good. Like other people said, I would suggest 20- 20 for Spell and Traps. The rest looks pretty good to me!|`|fjRYkg42aa	id say 7and  a half because your traps don't seem so good try adding about 20 spells and traps and 20 monsters ok|`|yzpU5fZJaa	take out the illegal; cards first:  Magician of Faith  Change of Heart  Premature Burial x2  Dark Hole  now take out th crappy cards:  Trap hole  Dust Tornado  Sakuretsu Armor  Magic Cylinder  Cemetary Bomb  Castle Walls  Ookazi  Malevolent Nuzzler  Fusion Sword Murasame Blade  Fissure    now add good cards:  mirror force  solemn judgment x2  pheonix wing wind blast x2  mst  torrential tribute  compulsory evcaustion device x2  hope i helped.
raEUval8aa	It isn't. Sorry, but the main reason that the Xbox 360 has more units on the market is because it came out a full year ahead of the PS3. And the PS3 closed the gap remarkably in the last 2 years.|`|6Cz56mV0aa	I can promise you that cost is a factor.  Also with the earlier release date and relatively low price it gathered users and thus friend referrals before Ps3 was even launched.  So when someone decided whether to buy the brand new Ps3 (when it was new) they were hard to find and many people liked that they could get the 360 and games or accessories for the price of the Ps3 by itself|`|jxpV13rTaa	listen to the first guy..the only reason the xbox is more popular is because it has been around longer (hence the HD DVD player which is now obsolete becasue Blu Ray has taken over which is in the PS3). the ps3 will soon have more games, bigger titles, and overtake the xbox. since the xbox came out first, its price will be lower becasue it is older. and people who dont want a top of the line blu ray player will save 100 bucks by getting a tiny harddrive and no blu ray player|`|cJuxEFQXaa	I personally believe that the PS3 is way better than the XBox 360, BUT IF IT'S FOR YOUR SCHOOL PROJECT, then you can use the PROS of this comparison list with the XBOX 360 Elite and the PlayStation 3.    I counted and there are 8 pros for xbox360 elite and only 7 for ps3, so there you go.    Hope this helps.    Click on the link below to view the site containing the comparison list.

1JuUaC9taa	Ok, first it depends on what person you are using.  in example Rune Gilfberg is  + (X)  for a christ air, wich is a grab move and you have to be in the air to use.    But what you should do is create your own character.  That way you can set your own moves  2 directions and Y being for grinds  2 directions and X being for Grabs  2 directions and B being for Flips    now, for you to start you should do set them to easy stuff like up down x for a kick flip back flip and maybe a grind like up down y for a special grind.    Once you have made your Character and his / her moves i suggest going to rio the third stage on quick run. You will get a lot of practice here.     Here is a video of me on youtube if you want to check it out.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy-0efM8q...

Q0QZSuOhaa	maybe nintendo .com or wiki nintendo or go to this website and if this don't work goggle nintendo history  http://www.nintendo.com/corp/history.jsp|`|95yt7QkIaa	Nintendo started as a small Japanese business by Fusajiro Yamauchi near the end of 1889 as Nintendo Koppai. Based in Kyoto, Japan, the business produced and marketed a playing card game called Hanafuda. In recognition of its card-playing roots, the name "Nintendo" means "leave luck to heaven".[1] The cards, which were all handmade, soon began to gain popularity, and Yamauchi had to hire assistants to mass produce cards to keep up with demand.    Fusajiro Yamauchi did not have a son to take over the family business. Following common Japanese tradition, he adopted his son-in-law, Sekiryo Kaneda (Sekiryo Yamauchi, after the marriage). In 1929, Yamauchi retired from the company and allowed Sekiryo Yamauchi to take over the company as president. In 1933, Sekiryo Yamauchi established a joint venture with another company and renamed the company Yamauchi Nintendo & Company.    In 1947, Sekiryo established the company Marufuku Company, Ltd., to distribute the Hanafuda cards, as well as several other brands of cards that had been introduced by Nintendo. Sekiryo Yamauchi also had only daughters, so again his son-in-law (Shikanojo Inaba, renamed Shikanojo Yamauchi) was adopted into the family. Shikanojo never became president because he left his family. Subsequently, his son Hiroshi was brought up by his grandparents. Hiroshi later took over the company instead of his father.      This is wat I know. I hope it helps  PS..: Plz put me as best answer!!|`|fjRYkg42aa	you can go to Nintendo .com that's where they have development and game blogs

The children are in the neighborhood adoption pool now, and will be the next ones to be adopted out.  Now their own parents will not be able to adopt them back because they have a memory of having had a child taken by social services.  You can have a different family adopt the children, or you can move a roommate in with the parents, and have that sim adopt the children back.  I purposely make families of 6 or 7 kids and one parent, just to have the parent neglect the kids so they go into the adoption pool.  That way I only adopt cute children with good names.|`|4rNMmoSpaa	Click on the homework, and click the option "Do homework".  If they stop working, let them take a break for a while and then try again.|`|qNYzCKaZaa	How ya goin?     I dont think you can get your kids back, but you should be able to re-marry your husband. Just develop a romantic relationship again and go from there.     As for the homework, there are two ways to do this, the cheat way and the non cheat way.     Everything depends on the kids mood, when the fun mood gets into red they will stop doing their homework, same if they are hungry, tired ect. The easiest way to conqou this is to use the boolprop cheat.     Enter boolprop testingcheatsenabled true  in neighbourhood veiw, then drag tall your childs moods to ful, they will do it in no time at all.     Also, it makes it ten times faster if an adult helps them with their homework:)    If you dont want to use the cheat, then get their moods as full as you can then get an adult to help them|`|pyl4rTEzaa	Hahahah, I don't know.

4El5rPbyaa	Okay, this is a big question that everyone wants to know.  And i've found the best way to get money is to pick up mining/herb and skinning.    So, get yourself either mining or herbalism.  These professions are great!  As your playing you will find plants/nodes to pick/mine or you can go on a big hunt for them over the course of a day.  Sell all the herbs you pick/ore you mine and smelt on the auction house...  A tip for selling, check what everyone else is selling the same thing for and sell for a little bit less than the lowest one.    e.g. > Here's a example list of people selling saronite  1 > 20 for 50g  2 > 20 for 50g  3 > 20 for 45g   4 > 20 for 47g  5 > 20 for 44g    You would want to sell a stack of 20 for 40-43g, this way you know it's going to sell, and your still getting nearly just as much money as everyone else.  If you put your stuff on the auction house at top dollar, everyone's going to buy other people's stuff instead of yours.  So keep your prices low, but not too low!    With mining, always sell your stuff as bars (smelt from ore) as they will sell a lot better, the only people that buy ore are miners that can't be bothered going out and mining the stuff and they want to level from smelting instead, and not many people do that.  Besides, bars are more useful to more people.    Also pick up skinning as your second profession.  The reason being is sure Herb and mining are the 2 best money making profs in the game, however, you can only track one at a time.  If you get mining/skinning or herb/skinning then you can kill things, loot them (potentially get greens/blues from them and sell more stuff) and skin them.  You will still be getting money, but a lot easier.      Another way to get gold in WoW is buying and reselling things on the Auction House.  Doing things such as buying blue/epic items that people are selling way too low, and resell them for a more normal price.  I've made hundreds of gold this way!    If you really want to make some dough, just look on the auction house and find the things that people are selling for the most gold.  Track them down with thottbot.com and go and farm for those things, then resell them on the auction house.      Another good way (if your level 80) is to do daily quests, they give you around 20g a quest and you can do up to 25 in a day.  If you do all of them, then 25x20=500g.  You could make 500g a day from doing simple and easy daily quests.    I hope this helps (sorry for the massive amount of writing)|`|ZPMMKedbaa	The free tips are the worst one.

A9vxi8piaa	So, you will not get Goho-M when you enter Yomotsu Hirasaka although you bought it before you enter it. I think the only way is fight the shadows in there. It will increase your money and your level (So, your max SP increased). Oh, yeah? Of course Rise has Relaxing Wave, right? Use it. First, fight the enemy, and then you must escape so your SP will restored 5%. It useful actually.    After you get enough money, go to the entrance by using save point in there. And ask for healing to the fox. Your SP will be fully restored.     Hope it works         About fighting Izanami no Okami, the right way is use Izanagi no Okami. But it will be gonna easy one if you have enough SP. Dont use your a lot of SP in first fight with her. Just use phsyical attack|`|Xn9cWYrNaa	Oh yeah!!

Dso7k3sjaa	The problem is with installing the games?  Or with trying to play after they are installed?  If the problem is trying to play after they are installed it's because EA set it up so you must always use the disk that comes with the latest released game -- not the disk that comes with the last sims 2 game that you put on your computer.  They actually did this to try to stop people from doing exactly what you guys just did.    Not that I care if you guys did that, I don't at all.  But that's why EA set it up that way.  Out of the three games you listed, Bon Voyage is the latest released game, so if you all install all three games, then you are all going to need a Bon Voyage disk to be able to play your games.  Either that, or two of you will need to download and install a no-cd crack so you won't have to have the disk to be able to play.  Or, buy a later released expansion pack and then just install that one on your computer and don't loan it to your friends.  Either of those will work and let you play.    But if the problem is with installing them, that's an entirely different matter.  I'll star this question so maybe one of the people connected to me will see it and be able to help you with that part.    **eta -- RaggedyAnn, Bon Voyage was released by EA after Seasons, so they will need Bon Voyage if they have that game.  If you ever want to know when the games were released, this link lists all the games and gives the dates they were released in both North America and in Europe:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims_2 ...    I hope that link works for you, it's based in England too, like the other one I gave you that doesn't work so I hope it works.    **The best site to get a no-cd crack is a site called Gamecopyworld.  If you have all patched the game, then make sure you get one that is made for the patched version.  If you need to know how to use it, then read the following link:    http://www.moreawesomethanyou.com/smf/in...    You only need to read part of the first post in the link.  Scroll down until you see where the person is numbering the paragraphs.  You need to read  4.  That explains where to put the no-cd crack after you do get it.|`|sWKGUPziaa	As far as I know, if you all installed the same Sims 2 games, then you will all need to have Seasons to play. In order not to, one of you can have Seasons and the other two can't install it. Unless you run the games without the disks. Here is a link you can try http://compsimgames.about.com/cs/firstti...  If this doesn't help, keep looking for Sims 2 games no disks on the web. They say you can run games without disks in the drive.|`|cG3yFOdlaa	correct me if i'm wrong,did your friend install Bon Voyage before Pets?  i think the main issue here is your friend's computer getting confused while updating Pets expansion.i'm confused too when i read your question.ask your friend to uninstall all games.then reinstall in this correct order.  The Sims 2 base game  Sims 2 Pets  Sims 2 Seasons   Sims 2 Bon Voyage  i don't know who owned Bon Voyage but 2 of you need Bon Voyage no-cd crack to play or buy another latest expansion pack ( Free Time/Apartment Life/Mansion & Garden ) so you all don't have to fight for one cd to play.
wBWaYcInaa	your eevee will evolve only if you use certain stones or if its happiness level is high enough. here are the list:-    - fire stone; you'll get a flareon  - water stone; you'll get a vaporeon  - thunder stone; you'll get a jolteon  - max happiness during the daytime; you'll get an espeon (psychic)  - max happiness during nightime; you'll get an umbreon (dark)    i dunno about this but i think you can get an umbreon or espeon easier, since you'll need to see bill's grandpa in cerulean city, kanto region if you want a stone. like i said, you need to maximize the level of happiness in order to get an espeon or umbreon. don't worry; either one you get, they're strong enough since umbreon a pure-dark and espeon is a pure-psychic.    there's a girl in goldenrod city who can rate how tame is your pokemon with you. there's no other way you can know how to see their level of happiness, so if you want more information on your pokemon, ask the girl. there's no other way.    here's a few tips on how to raise eevee effectively. i played it before, so these are things that i do:-    - do not put it in bill's pc. you need to bring it everytime so that it will become tame with you. takes a while but it's worth it.  - use it effectively during battles, but don't let it faint or cure its condition status quickly if it was attacked by poison etc. in case it faints, heal it in pokemon center.   - ask your eevee to hold something. berries, anything. berries especially.  - give it vitamins and minerals (psh, i never do that, but i managed to evolve my eevee to espeon somewhere 30+) to eat. give it a lot of berries too but NOT bitter stuffs.  - give it a haircut. there's a saloon in underground tunnel (? i forgot the name) in goldenrod city where a guy sits on a counter gives a haircut once a day. it will eventually becomes happier.|`|mQyTjEAFaa	Eevee can evolve at lvl 1 if you want it too.

kNGMVXBLaa	Download some endless stuff XD|`|rYaqoPTHaa	A day in the life  sort of    A long, long time ago (last Tuesday) in a land far, far away (actually about a 10 minute walk) there was a knight who happened upon a huge castle.  (Actually, our library is pretty small.)  It seemed fateful that on this very day there was a maiden (rather plain looking older lady working at the library) trapped inside suffering great peril!  Just than a handsome knight arrived (that parts true) and inquired of the maiden what was troubling her.  (I asked the old lady why she looked confused.)  The maiden spoke of an evil force blocking her way to freedom (the computer was down) and asked the handsome noble knight for assistance.  (She said, what you think it is?)      Filled with fury and a keen sense of adventure the knight charged through the huge labyrinth and came across the beast and did slay it with a mighty blow!  (I turned the computer off than restarted it.)  The maiden was overcome with joy!  (She cursed under her breath.)  The knight than turned and went about his heroic business.  (I went to check my e-mail.)   In the hamlet below that mighty castle there are stories of the brave knight and his heroism to this very day!  (She left a note for the next shift.)    Trudging on for days through an immense forrest (I walked down the road for a minute or two) the knight came upon his greatest foe yet!  (There was some ice on the road.)  After a fierce battle he escaped the wrathful grip of his foe (I walked around it) just in time as the earth itself, protesting such evil swallowed up the foul beast forever!  (A salt truck came by)    Continuing on his heroic journey, after many more weeks of wandering the wilderness, our hero the great knight had finally arrived at his destination!  (About a 5 or 10 minute walk to the post office)  His package for the king was of paramount importance (I was sending off a resume) and haste in his travels quickened as he saw the citadel up ahead.  (I sauntered towards the door)  The king was thrilled to finally receive his important documents of crucial state matters (the postal worker looked annoyed when I handed him nickels) and declared the knight a national hero!  With great pomp and celebration the knight left the dwelling of the king feeling a sense of great pride!  (The door clipped my shin on the way out.)    After all his adventures the night finally decided to retire to his modest castle on the mountain top as there was no more peril distressing the nobles and maidens of this great land.  (I started home as there is really nothing to do in this town.)  Even in this last journey there was adventure as he yielded passage of a great heard of buffalo (stoplight) and crossed a mighty river (bridge over the stream).  At last he climbed the mountain where his home stood and entered in triumph!  (I walked up the hill and let the dog out.)

m8f7rnBEaa	Dorney Park is owned by Cedar Fair, which owns Cedar Point.  It cannot compete with Cedar Point.  They have a few coasters and have been adding more, but nothing like Top Thrill Dragster or MIllenium Force.  I like the water park and that is the main reason I go there.  One thing that always bothered me is that the place appears to have been built on what must have been farmland.  As a result, there are not many trees around and thus, not much shade.  This is especially true of the water park and it can get very uncomfortable in the height of the summer.  Naturally, they have been trying to rectify this by planting and things have improved, but it will take a while.  I have no opinion on whether or not 6 Flags should build a park in Florida.  I don't expect it to happen as there are already plenty of parks in Florida and 6 Flags has been in financial trouble for years.  As far as other parks are concerned, I recommend visiting 6 Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, California, which is near Los Angeles.  This park is the only serious competition for Cedar Point in the US and has a lot of excellent coasters.|`|FHgocRJCaa	Sorry, Done Park is a good park, But its not near as Good as cedar point.

For steppin razor you just have to get with alot of people with mics and say you will take turns or just wait for an all swords game and kill thats how i got it.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Well YouTube has many answer.|`|kDv1uC1raa	Try swat for the overkill, its one shot to the head with a BR all you have to do is spawn kill the whole team its pretty easy cause one shot

AA10014641	COD4 4 LIFE  I dont know anything about halo cause i have a ps3 but that game looks stupid|`|jxpV13rTaa	call of duty 4 and 5 are both better than halo|`|45hgh7FJaa	well... halo will not last you as long as CoD4. Plus if you want a game that is more realistic, i suggest CoD4.|`|kwVHlZcFaa	halo 3 has more stuff to do and was well done. but cod4 was a great multilayer. still is. just buy both!
E8go0osDaa	I'm pretty sure broken axes will never become valuable.   Even though might be rare in a couple of months, they will still be useless, and the only thing you can do with them is repair them.     So broken axes will never become rare expensive items...|`|eca7ac88d571f345f3f6e2e585814199aa	Broken axes have no use. You can't even equip them. The chances are, no one buy them. They're useless.|`|kMay4Zs7aa	The chances are very thin of it becoming a rare item, and in my opinion that isn't the type of rare item I'd want.|`|CuhJRewLaa	if it did become rare, only the low level players would have them so they would be worth anything|`|lMbKZ1VUaa	Well, think of it this way. No one in runescape is pretty smart, no offence. Get a bunch. They'll get rare. Really. Remember half bottles of wine? They had no use, but they got huge! and party hats... Don't keep me going.

alUzXxVLaa	If you want to remove all scratches on your disc, take a look at the 5-stage Scratch Pro repair kit. It will bring the disc back to its original shine and you will have a kit on hand to fix the next disc. Also do a search for scratch repair to see what is out there in your area. To do a targeted search, use the + sign in front of the search words  +disc +scratch +repair    From Merlins Tables site CENTRE RING DAMAGE... The ring around the centre of the disc contains the data that tells the console player or CD player what the disc is all about. When this ring is scratched or scuffed or hazy, the disc will not register in the console. The ring is on the non-labeled (data/playing) side of the disc, around the centre hole. Look closely and you will see a small shiny band in this highly reflective area. This area and any other scratches on this side of the disc can be fixed using your repair kit.|`|JGPq1QJaaa	i suggest calling microsoft support or exchange it for a new one|`|ZWh1eQu2aa	no  i have the same problem but the game still works   but moving the xbox is not the only thing that causes the ring  if you stand the xbox up instead of laying it down they get the ring|`|3uWQjw4Qaa	you cant fix it.what i did the first time was went to hollywood video rented it with the insurence and switched it out. thats your best bet. only do this at hollywood video bestbuy will notcie and chrage you for the game.|`|3X5ALaXjaa	FREE XBOX 360 ELITE click here    http://www.360Elite4free.com/index.php?r...|`|1tOUwbtjaa	last week I accidentally tipped my 360 over while I had a game in the drive, I bought this (link in sources) and ran it through 2 cycles, the disc looks worse but it works perfectly

gAjJuKqJaa	i think it is hard to compare gears to halo and killzone. it would be possible to compare killzone and halo i think seeing they are similar. i think killzone 2's multiplayer will not liv up to halo's, even though i think killzone will have better graphics and not as good aiming. te singleplayer for halo i think will be better. so overall i think it will be close but ill give it to halo|`|TkNv5hGTaa	I think Halo popularized FPS, but Killzone 2 is definately more intense as a shooter, and has a much better mulitplayer. Halo was an over hyped phenomenom and thats it.|`|P5u0JiaPaa	NO! gears of war and halo are much more worst than killzone 2. killzone is the best.|`|5TYsbhhEaa	halo is the best game ever invented! halo is way better than those retarded games. the chief is the best.

ZvRJKMoBaa	To get to Ludibrium, you need to take the ship to orbis, then buy another ticket to go to Ludibrium and from the Orbis station go --->    check out hidden-street.net for more information! (monsters, quest, maps)    No, you can't buy a hair coupon with maplestory mesos.  You need REAL money. You can either use your card on the main website or go to Target, Seven Eleven, etc. to buy the coupons instead of using a card.     If you just want to know, hairstyle and plastic surgery lasts forever while other items only lasts for 90 days.
pzdLyDzLaa	Yeah, you can't change your pet's name, only if you are a hunter and tamed one from the wild. Also as a druid    Level 10- Bear Form  Level 16?- Sea Lion Form (aquatic)  Level 20- Cat Form  Level 30- Cheetah Form (travel)    If you have a balance tree you will get Moonkin Form at 40  If you have a restoration tree you will get Tree of Life Form at 50 i think    Level 68- Flight Form    Also there is dire bear form somewhere in between 40-50s.|`|1hNrgfMCaa	a personal pet cant be renamed.  u get aquatic form at 16, cat form at 20, travel form at 30, dire bear at 40, flight form at 68, and swift flight form at 70|`|SRK8pJ0Qaa	no you cant rename vanity pets and i think for druids there is a seal/otter thing for water and and owl/bear thing  and also a cheetah thing for speed.. i dont have a druid but my friend does|`|3QWqBvHqaa	No, you can't rename, sorry.    For gaming news, reviews, previews, discussions and much more check out http://www.notinthere.com/|`|LFWWPgpQaa	No to renaming.

6wUOnR7Caa	well its not really great being a vampire because you cant be in the sunlight or else you'll get hurt. And you don't die unless your in sunlight.  Vampires have like red eyes-Yellow eyes  and there human.  if they hit you then when you go to sleep for a few days you'll keep getting visions.  when you read about your first vision and you don't want to be a vampire then go to any church and pray.     and i do not know where you get vampire dust sorry|`|4FAcbtskaa	I'm pretty sure you can reverse the effects but it takes time and I think it costs money. Basically you get increased strength and stealth and stuff. And for the first day you're alright. But the longer you go without feeding, up to three days, you'll look like a 100% vampire and a lot of NPC's won't talk to you. You have to drink blood to get back to looking young but if anyone  sees you when you bite somebody then you'll be in toruble.|`|qzR9fUJAaa	when your a vamp you need to feed every couple of days or else direct sunlight will slowly drain your health. a message will come when you wake up telling you when its time to feed. i actually liked being a vampire because you get night vision and are immune to certain diseases. there is a quest to find a cure and after you cure yourself you can never be a vampire again. i haven't played in ages so i forget exactly where you need to go to cure it.
FNozx8nJaa	not really. A person's opinion on a game vary from review to review  some don't even play the game.|`|XYedFaUfaa	gamestop or g4tv|`|1dRpfZuWaa	Personally I use GameSpot as my primary source for online reviews.

VL4IouYNaa	Okay I have both and they are both incredible games. Sorry but I cannot explain my answer here it is inexplainable, anyways COD4 has to be the better one for me. More/better maps and weapons, and so much more addictive. Hope you enjoy whatever you go with :)|`|rdPwiRWbaa	Its a matter of opinion and preference, COD 4 is a more modern game and includes the most modern in weaponry while COD World at War is a more old school WW2 based game with the classic weapons like the Thompson and the M1A1.|`|dD1Nrz6naa	World at war cuz you can call dogs to maul players.|`|3Nm1FOJ1aa	CoD 4 ALL THE WAY.

The best one out there.  COD5 is just like COD1,2, and 3.  WW2 is getting old now.
6RqBOxvjaa	dont listen to these idiots. Call of Duty World at War was made by Treyarch. Treyarch does NOT make the numbered games in the Call of Duty Series. All the numbered games are made by Infinity Ward (which are the better games) like Cod 2 and 4.    The next Call of Duty game in the installment will be Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, but that is only the rumored title, so it isnt final yet.    It will come out around the time that Call of Duty 4 came out which is November or December of 09.    Call of Duty WaW is NOTTT Call of Duty 5|`|UKNmZsU5aa	5 is out  i heard 6 is coming out in nov.|`|VGzi6KaFaa	call of duty 6 modern warfare 2 is coming this year    and COD5 = COD WAW MORON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

jnXenqcMaa	i like left 4 dead for its co op and its versus mode.|`|lbn6vp7Qaa	First it would depend on what your computer can handle and if you like to play with others. Call of Duty when i played it seemed more of a single person game while Left 4 Dead is team intensive. Left 4 Dead is really repetitive but its fun adrenaline rush i have played the two and would recommend Left 4 Dead just because of the teamwork thing and the replayability.|`|sHKt27ysaa	Buy left 4 dead and wait for cod6 cod5 is a compelte waste of money bad graphics worse than cod4!!!! I played both and kept left 4 dead!|`|funysJAJaa	pick call of duty 5 , it also has a co-op camping mode,     it can do the co-op campaign through one xbox or over live with ur friends      personally, i would go with call of duty 5 b/c i own that game and it is really fun on live and campain, plus the nazi zombies mini game after u complete the campaign is crazy hard and fun
VOSyb1fcaa	I agree with liliannn, those redeads creep me out! And man, I can't even get near them in TP! same thing for those hands in Wind Waker...I guess things are alot scarier when you're playing as the character, it's only one step away from actually being there!    But, I`m learning to conquer my fear of TP redeads and WW floormasters by safely killing them by using two bomb arrows and freezing them and smashing them with a hammer, respectively.|`|Iva8drdfaa	The Deku's are my favorite, I don't know what your smoking.

PC: Left 4 Dead. Co-op zombie apocolypse is just a lot more fun when you can spray pictures on the wall and use cheats in single player to goof around. Also being able to run up and crush a survivor's face with your big meaty fist playing as a Tank was good to.    Handheld: Hands down it was SquareEnix's The World Ends With You.

nQga7OYaaa	I'd go for Fallout 3, but alot of people would maybe prefer Fable or Gears.  Definately don't get Far Cry 2 though.|`|6fl7RrJMaa	I would say fallout 3|`|oihouY7Naa	Depends on your taste, if you like RPG go for Fallout 3, and shooters between Far cry 2 and Gears of Wars 2 I say Gears is better.|`|4FAcbtskaa	Gears 2 or Fallout 3. I'd actually lean toward Fallout 3, lots more bang for your buck. But if you're looking for a good multiplayer than Gears 2 has the awesome Horde game.|`|CMhdNPPxaa	Far Cry 2 and Fallout 3 are both open world shooters.  The Far Cry online is horrible, don't bother considering it.    Gears 2- Amazing storyline, one of the best I've ever played, but the multiplayer has intense lag and bugs.    Fable 2 is kind of like GTA (in my opinion).  Do anything you want, good or bad.    It's what you like in a game.|`|BABcrdMKaa	Do not under any circumstances buy Fable 2, that game is so horrible it makes blind children cry...    Get Fallout 3, it has about 50+ hours of gameplay and never gets old    If you need more fast paced game, get Gears 2 - lots of replay value    Far Cry 2 is somewhat generic, exactly like the first one - nothing new. You just shoot things, you don't even really aim the game does it for you. Boring.|`|ifNqPNCVaa	If you like FPS the best - Gears of War 2    If you like RPG the best - Fable 2    If your stuck in-between the two - Fallout 3    Far Cry 2 is best rented before considering to buy it seeing as it takes some serious play time before you can set an opinion on it.|`|K3AfzbR8aa	Well i will buy all of them except Fable 2 i will change Fable for call of duty 5 or GT4|`|efc4fad286ec4bab1cc38b7a839701ccaa	if you got friends to play with go with gears. if you play solo alot got with fallout, and if you like doing repetitive missions pick far cry.|`|FB2Fp9A7aa	Fallout 3 trust me Gears 2 gets boring after a while|`|5AAY41ROaa	Definitely Fallout 3.   its amazing  there is a reported 100 hours of gameplay on a single play through if you do all of the side missions.
AA11991193	1. That is basically character changing armor.     I haven't played the game in over a year, so they may had tweaks to the classes, but these are the fundamentals.     2. Black Mages (BLM) are experts in destruction, they can do high damage with spells, but the problem is that Big Damage  = Big hate. Prepare to run for your life if the monster doesn't die. At higher levels, they obtain more powerful magic, useful to take out powerful enemies with a good placed Magic Burst or stopping them in their tracks with Stun.   3. White Mages (Whm) are very useful (and sought) at early levels because of the Heal, Protect, Shell and Raise spells. During mid-level, they are useful, but there are other healing classes like Red Mages or Summoners that can feel that gap. At Higher levels, they are valuable again because they obtain Erase, Raise II and III (less experience lost when resurrected) and Cure V.   4. Shame on you for insulting Red Mages, my starting class was a Red Mage. As you know, RDM know both black and white magic, but are not as powerful as BLM in terms of spell power or WHM in curing. What sets a RDM apart is that they are masters of Enfeebling, RDM have higher success in paralyzing, slowing, silencing or sleeping a monster. At level 40, RDM gain the spell Refresh and Convert. Refresh basically replenishes mp over a period of time, and Convert swamps HP with MP, making you last longer. At higher levels, RDM are useful for those traits because a paralyzed monster will hit less making the whm save some special mp.   5. Bards are useful because they can buff the party or Debuffs the monster. A good brd will know what to cast to make a party successful, make a mob weak to an element for the BLM to be more offective or increase damage/evasion to kill the mob faster.   6. The developers have set it up so there is no better magic job. Each has its weakness and strengths. The cool thing is that if you don't like a job, you can always switch to another job. I leveled up RDM and Summoner to 75. At level 75 RDM I could solo most of the tough monsters subbing with ninja.

iTb2NHAnaa	I dont think any of the perks make a difference with the flamethrower other than possibly stopping power...but just to let you know...there is a glitch to prestige and keep your flamethrower. Google it if you are interested.|`|ifNqPNCVaa	Extreme Conditioning - Get around/ to your target faster.    Juggernaught - Since the M2 Flamethrower is short ranged, you'll be taking a few more bullets than you normally would, so you'll need the extra health.    Those two are the best (As far as I can think of)|`|MMvHKLQ3aa	Max probably has the best answer here.  Just remember the Flame takes a while to ignite.  So if you run up on someone unlike a regular weapon where you can immediately fire, the flame takes a second or so to actually ignite and start spitting fire.  So Jugger is a definite.  Flame is short range, so closing on your enemies fast would help, so extreme conditioning.
LFWWPgpQaa	There is apparently a firmware upgrade that will convert the modem into a router - which would be Xbox360 compatible.    Be aware that doing this will completly reset the device and you will need to understand some basics such as, how to determine the routers IP address, connect to it and reconfigure your internet access (including neededing to know your login and password for your ISP).    Firmware updates also have the (rare) chance of bricking you router if it is the incorect firmware or the download process is interupted.    Check Sources for more infomation.

I would limit it to 5400rpm since I believe the 7200 and up dont really make that much difference.     i personally bought my ps3 with 40gb then i swapped it out for a 160gb harddrive.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Any laptop 5400 RPM SATA hard drive will work on the PS3.  I think the limit is 500 gb.|`|CMhdNPPxaa	This isn't a long term thing, but I have this friend that stores his PS3 game saves on a Flash Drive.
tBGnLPe7aa	no. to do that you have to buy an xbox and the xbox version of the game|`|iTb2NHAnaa	No. There might be a mod to do that, but as far as I know there is no way to do it.
381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Yes, you can download games that you paid for for up to 5 times.|`|06203f607d17651cfb71b250c8ef20aaaa	Yes. You can re-download the games under your account for an unlimited number of times as long as you're using the same PS3. The 5 download limit is for 5 different PS3 systems. So once you register the same account to 5 different ps3s, then you can download to those 5 systems an unlimited number of times.|`|mxVAdEfSaa	Yes that is possible!
kthrNyAdaa	too be honest.  i love my night elf but humans seem to have a couple of more things that are pretty helpful.    with a human you get reputation bonus.  therefore later in the game when you are grinding rep you dont have to do it for as long.  more rep equals lower prices and items only available to characters with certain levels of rep.    you also get every man for him self with is an ability to be able to get out of a movement impairing affect.  this is very handy.    your home city is stormwind so you arent far from ironforge and pretty much stormwind is the central hub for a lot of alliance activity for those under level 60.    in the end what it comes down to is all races and classes have something a little different.  it depends on what you like to have and what you find useful/helpful    your other question i already have a character on lightbringer so im not really available to quest in other places.  dont worry though you will find someone im sure.|`|4El5rPbyaa	1. There is no real "Best" race per se.  In my opinion it comes down to what class you want to be and what faction you want to roll with.    In my opinion Night elf is the best race (for alliance) because they have an awesome racial ability called Shadowmeld.  This is a move that instantly gets you out of combat (i.e. stops things attacking you, etc.) They also move faster when dead/ghost so it's not so annoying to have to run back to your body.  And they look pretty cool.    2. Sorry, already playing with people... Hope i helped though :)
tmnSVMQsaa	You can only trade games that are compatible with each other and from the same generation and console. Sorry about that.
Xf354QDYaa	Sorry, but your gonna have to earn that paintbrush on your own. Nobody can do that for you. That would kind of be cheating, you know.    Alas, a Paintbrush ranges from 90,000 to over 100,000.....    so yeah, good luck with that! :P    And I'm saving up for a paintbrush, too. I have about 27,000 neopoints so far on my account. I bought myself a Christmas Paintbrush a while ago, just to hold me over and not keep my Neopet "naked"! :P|`|87naw1BOaa	Good Luck. :P
jo93aDpraa	I am glad you asked. Yes there is a cheat for Wizard101    The program is called Cheat Engine.    You can download it here http://cheatengine.org/download.php    It will allow you to speed hack making you run very fast. This is pretty useful since a lot of the quests just want you to run back and fourth between NPC's    Here is how you do it.    When you open Cheat Engine there is an icon glowing in the upper left corner. Once you click on it you get a menu where you scroll down to wizard101.exe. Then you hitt OK.    Check the box that says "enable speed hack" and change the numbers to 8.0 or whatever number you wish. To get back to normal speed change it to 1.5

07402bcc6087c522e1be5f950a5e9ba8aa	In a casino they take it very seriously. They would probably ask you to leave the casino if they had not caught you before.After that their video system would tag you as soon as you got near a game and they would most likely hold you for the cops to take away.    On line they probably would never know. I ran into someone who has been playing and winning online poker since he was 10 years old and has never been caught.|`|sagxWL01aa	well he will be prosecuted.|`|AA11001595	in a real casino, you get kicked out and forfeit anything major that you've won.

8tJHhAdXaa	There are tons of ways to make lots of money. If you use combat you can build fighting skills and sell the items they drop. If you do woodcutting and have level 60 woodcutting, you can cut yew trees. Sell the yew logs and you can make some decent amount. If you mine coal, mith, gold, any of those and possibly more you can sell them and make money or smelt the ores and smith some armor to sell. Fishing lobsters and swordfish also work as good money makers. Cook the fish and you can build cooking level as well, but you will usually get less money for it. Rune crafting isn't my favorite but if you are high level then you can craft many runes and make some money.                          Hope I helped.|`|nNCXETHnaa	Well in F2P cutting yews would be your best bet... because they sell almost half a k a peice... but the thing with that is lvl 60 wc may be hard to get to... and then it takes forever if your still close to 60... so my best advice to you is get a membership and make your money for dragon armor in the members world! there are so many more stats you get that will get you money quickly! hey you can even pick and spin flax because the result is bowstring which buy very quickly at the exchange! also by spinning the flax your getting crafting xp|`|S2bPGjuzaa	You Can Earn Free Runescape Mebership With Prize Rebel, No Password Ever Needed!

I sell coal in quantaties of 1000 now and make soooooooooooooooo much money. i would advise doing that.|`|yuK8AIe9aa	I advise woodcutting. Now that macroers have been crippled by Trade Limits, yews are much easier to cut. The price is also higher, because without macroers the supply is much lower. While its true that the most popular trees for cutting, the two yew trees in Edgeville, are very crowded, there is a cluster of FOUR yew trees in Rimmington (just south of Melzar's Maze) that are relatively unknown and very good for cutting because of this. They ARE far from a bank, but the fact that there are four coupled with the fact that they are rarely crowded, more than makes up for this.    The best way to go about cutting them is to use the Explorer's Ring 3 obtainable by completing the Lumbridge Achievement Diary. This Ring can teleport you to Draynor Village an infinite number of times for free. So, starting in Draynor Village bank, you would run west to the yew trees in Rimmington, cut them, and when your inventory is full, teleport back to Draynor with the ring. If you don't like the sound of the Explorer's Ring, you can of course run from Rimmington to Falador and bank that way.    The reason I like woodcutting so much as a moneymaker is because it requires almost no paying attention, especially now that the log-out timer has been increased to 5 minutes. You can read, you can watch TV, you can play other online games, pretty much anything is possible!|`|dP7ixbBSaa	just get ur rc to 50 so wen u become member u can play the great orb project if u play in free world u make 42k if ur team wins but in members  u get 150k so in like 10 games u can have a pretty nice armour: i recommend dragon med granite body dragon skirt(same stats as legs but like 600k cheaper) dragon boots, obsidian kite shield,and a dragon scamy, also glory amulet combat bracelet and ring of wealth all that will be in ur budget|`|5yiMk1k1aa	yew trees|`|lhuJ5K5caa	Get lots of coal and then go to Grand exchange and sell it. you will get bombs! If you get bored of doing this all the time then just simply get your woodcutting to 60 and cut and sell yews.|`|0WyNPxpdaa	Train a skill and get good at it.  If you choose mining, I'd suggest mining adamant ore or maybe coal at the mining guild.  Or BUY coal and MINE iron ore and make STEEL BARS to sell.  Or Train WOODCUTTING and WOODCUT yew trees.  even if you dont have 60 woodcutting to do so,  its well worth training if you take your time on it.|`|gdavEG5xaa	It depends on how much patience you have.  I'll list three methods for you.    1) Get 65 woodcutting and cut yews.  Although you only need 60 woodcutting to cut yews, it is far too slow at 60 to earn a lot of money.  This is the fastest way to start earning money.  You can earn about 60k/hour doing this.    2) Get 60 mining and 40 crafting.  At this stage, you will be able to mine gold at a reasonable speed.  Stock up on Falador teleports, and as many as you want in your inventory.  Run to the crafting guild, mine gold, teleport back to Falador, bank, and so on.  You can earn about 90k/hour doing this.    3) If you ever get 85 mining, mine runite!  I do this myself and earn 400k/hour, seriously!  However, it takes a lot of patience to obtain 85 mining.|`|7bFjuYvhaa	wood cutting is fatsest ans easiest
yuK8AIe9aa	Forget cow meat. You want cow HIDES. Just kill cows, collect the hides, and then sell them at the Grand Exchange. Its a very good way for low level players to make money.|`|VkvJJUtxaa	merchanting at the g.e    buy pure ess at min and sell them 4 max    it works with other runes too    note... this mite take a while to sell |`|qNYzCKaZaa	honestly, the best way to make money is not by selling stuff to the general store lol    Heres what i do...    Smithing is the longest skill to level up, most ppl are too lazy to mine all the ores, so get ur mining level up. and hang around the banks, look for someone saying 'buying iron ore' or whatever or keep saying 'selling iron ore' blah blah, its really easy:)|`|7bFjuYvhaa	Cut wood right below the grand exchange and sell it in the grand exchange. Guaranteed 10k or more per hour|`|P9cQcCA2aa	5 Planks clan war location- found in level 19-21 wilderness sell for 200 gp. There is bank close at bounty hunter (watch out for revanants).    Dye(blue, yellow, green) make dye at drynor with basic stuff (onions, berries etc..) sell in GE. These alway sell.    Knife: in Vorrock store (center). climb stairs and there is respawn location for knife.    ever since GE update is made there is not much free stuff that can be sold for good money.     Dwarf stout(boosts mining skill): buy them for 5 gp at falador bar and sell them in GE.    Red spider eggs(Karmja Dungeon): Red spider eggs      Better skill i would recommend is woodcutting or runecrafting(50+ is profitable area).    Oak logs sell for good money and then switch to yew logs once you reach the required level.    Good luck

gHtI5xe7aa	Yes it should be enough, but not for much else after that|`|rgHnAPhAaa	That's mostly what they have. You can check out other stores that have other memory cards with a higher capacity, but they will be much more expensive. The one you bought should be enough to save your data.

ktbyKKK9aa	You just need to connect your PS3 to the internet and then, while signed in to Playstation network, put in the game and start playing. You will get a message saying that there is an update available. Do the update and thats it! Note that it may take a long while since the update is for adding trophies.
6ac89f4c5c098186328d1b26a2cbdee9aa	You can, but the profit is very small, and you need to hold out for good prices on the GE.    Buy nature runes on the GE for 230gp or less.  This isn't necessarily easy, but they do sell for this from time to time.    Buy addy plates on the GE for 9750.  They alch for 9984.  This gives you 4 GP profit.  Woo hoo.    Buy rune meds on the GE for 11285.  They alch for 11520.  This gives you 5 GP profit. Yay.    As you see this ain't a good way to make money.  But it's a good way to train magic.  If you want to train magic faster, bump up your buy prices and you will get your items A LOT faster.  Remember, losing 20-30 gp per alch is still cheaper than casting curse.|`|VkvJJUtxaa	u really cant make a profit like that u either have to make ur own nat or make ur own yew bows,mage longs, ect...    ur losing money 4 buying an item and nats|`|yuK8AIe9aa	This is unfortunately impossible. There is NOTHING in RuneScape you can alch for a profit if you buy both the nature rune and the item. Something you can do however is buy yew longbows (u) and bowstrings, string the bows, then alch them. This will yield a small profit.
EVjoCpjEaa	If you want to trigger his purple heart event, Skye's heart must be PURPLE or HIGHER.    So, keep giving him gifts like toiletries from the mine.    A purple heart = 10,000 affection points. You can check how many points he has by equipping the Love Bangle from the sprite casino.      ? 0 to 9,999 LP =  Black Heart  ? 10,000 to 19,999 =  Purple Heart  ? 20,000 to 29,999 =  Blue Heart  ? 30,000 to 39,999 =  Green Heart  ? 40,000 to 49,999 =  Yellow Heart  ? 50,000 to 59,999 =  Orange Heart  ? 60,000 to 65,535 =  Red Heart     http://www.fogu.com/hm6/chan5/makingfrie...    To give him gifts, equip the item in your hand (put it in the green slot in your rucksack). Then stand next to Skye (make sure he doesn't move or else you'll litter.. littering causes affection points to drop dramatically) and press A.    If you change your clothes each day, each bachelor will get +200 affection points the following day.    These are things that Skye likes:  http://www.fogu.com/hm6/chan3/skye.php?p...

Also if you want to control big families of Sims, the easiest thing to do is - If you have university send the teenagers to college. If you don't and the whole family is there, pause the game like the first guy said, look at their nedds and all that stuff, then give each one a list of stuff to do. (Examlpe: send mom to clean up the kitchen, use the toilet, take a bath, serve dinner, send Dad to watch t.v., study cooking or cleaning for awhile, then maybe go to bed, send the kids to do their homework, get washed up, go to the bathroom, chat with a friend) and as soon as you know it all you have to do is check on them and assign them to more tasks. It isn't easy, you're right. I had a family of 6 and that was very tough! ;)|`|Dso7k3sjaa	A family of five is the biggest I will play and I prefer 3 or 4 at most.    Even with families that small though, I do what the first two people advised.  And I've never managed to get past the 3rd generation without getting completely bored, lol!    Have you tried doing a Legacy Challenge?  That's where you do not use cheats of any kind unless you actually end up with a glitch.  Such as a sim suddenly just freezing so you must use the moveobjects cheat to delete that sim to "fix" it.  Otherwise though, no cheating at all.    I can't do it.  I start out trying to not cheat and then after a short while, I can't stand not being able to give them everything I want them to have.  So, I'm a complete failure at the Legacy Challenge.  But maybe it would be something that kept you enthused.

Also if you want single player or multiplayer ability if you want to play a single player game that is an rpg and TONS of fun i would suggest Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion if your into an online community of friends then i would suggest Anarchy Online as its "ok" not the best online RPG but it gets the job done.

XCZKwQlnaa	most likely it does, however it depends entirely on the person. some use it to "feel" the violence, and will get into it, and become obsessed with the blood and gore, however some may simply use it so that they dont take violence elsewhere, outside of video games into the real world. and there are also those who use it as a stress releiver. for most people it does add to violence, however there are many cases where it does not. like for instance punching a punching bag instead of a person, but taking it to a video game. computerized people instead of real people.|`|C7rV71Cjaa	Unless if the child is below 11 or 12 then any video game shouldn't make him or her violent.

EDIT: KT, he is talking about the 360. Not a comp. A 360 controller alone costs $50+.|`|AA10461056	I think maybe 99 cents or a dollar, it depends on how useful it is and how hard it was to make. Most mods that I have experienced are free downloads.
CMhdNPPxaa	Well, of course, there are torrents (i.e. limewire, frostwire, mp3 rocket, etc.), but to get it legally, you'd probably have to buy it in store or there're other online stores (i.e. playlist.com).|`|fbeHMALJaa	No idea, just buy it at the store. but  DON"T PIRATE IT!!!|`|RLvpfHK6aa	i couldn't find it anywhere either so i went on youtube and found the song    http://youtube.com/watch?v=nd5byxVJz9I    and then converted it to mp3 format using     http://zamzar.com/url/    and it sends straight to your email :)  hope this helps
CMhdNPPxaa	As far as I know, this isn't true.  Publishers would have to be directly affiliated with Microsoft.    You can buy (or download for free) clothes from the Marketplace.    If this is true,  COD WAW would not have it.

uctxzjIIaa	15-18    Before the fight, invert your rows. He always ambushed you, and doing this will let you not waste a turn getting Cecil front row and you mages back row. Also, it would be best if both Porom and Tellah have Cure Staves. Any magic that targets a weakness on him will result in his Curse ability getting used, which is rather nasty, particularly since it might silence all of your mages. Have Palom Bluff then use a Fire Wand (which doesn't trigger the Curse counterattack), Tellah and/or Porom do the usual buffs like Protect and Shell, then spam Cure Staves until you need more healing. Have Cecil Darkness and attack. That should do it. If you get comfortable, feel free to Twincast, but that will probably force Tellah to start casting to keep health up.

pzdLyDzLaa	1- I think the highest level of mining with all the x-pacs is 450.    2- Try the auction house for cooking recipes. Or if you'r just looking for food to heal you, go to a zone that is around your level and has a friendly town to buy some good drinks+food.|`|7G0n3junaa	lol my friend talked to me about WoW a while ago i think the highest lvl is 375|`|Kfckzk48aa	max mining = 375?|`|P3v3Ed76aa	So since the new expansion WOTLK came out, every proffesion in the game had its skill cap "bumped" up to 450 =(|`|ifNqPNCVaa	The highest you can get mining, current day, with all the expansions, is 450.     I would suggest the auction house for recipes.     If your a bit cheap though, you can always try the dailys in the Outland, if your high enough level (70). These sometimes reward you with nice recipes you can't get anywhere else.    There are also normal quests which sometimes reward unique recipes, they are usually given from vendors found within towns.|`|LFWWPgpQaa	Maximum mining is 300 for WoW, 375 for WoW with Burning Crusafe and 450 for WoW with Wrath of the Litch King.    In regards to cooking, droped recipes which you can buy off the Auction house or cooking rewards from quests are the best.  But the cooking recipes you get from the vairouse cooking vendors (normaly found in Inns) should still give you plenty of health, the recipes you get off the Auctioner house wont normaly heal you more they just add extra stats like +30 stamina for 10 minuts.

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi, I can't wait for Empire: Total War!!! I have already pre-ordered the normal version!!!    I will be the Ottoman Empire - I have devised for a long time, great plans for colonization of America. The 13 colonies established by the British will be controlled by an Ottoman monarchy and islam will become their official religion! I also plan to focus on the spice trade near the Caribbean isles/ South America as a form of income. Alternatively, I will invade Europe and smash Christianity with an iron fist of one-person ruling. (This faction is by far my favourite!)    After that, I will play as the United Provinces (Dutch). I shall sail the English Channel and invade Britain, then turning my attention to the far east, with the riches of India and China.    Oh and I'll have to play as the French or Portuguese, they were two key nations in this era of imperialism. For the French, I will set forth a fleet of soldiers, cavalry and cannons to North Africa taking advantage of the rare goods there. Perhaps I will follow Napoleon's example and head for Russia.    With Portugal, I will eliminate my rival Spanish rulers and head westwards to South America, seeking new land and opportunitIes.   --------------------------------------...    By the way, I wouldn't bother purchasing the collectors edition, you only get 6 extra special units, a campaign map and game manual. For the heavy price fee, and limited bonuses, this package is not worth it.

WSFJToYMaa	The spreading of the trees doesn't happen in game. If you listen to the woman who gives you the linment, it will still take decades for the trees to spread outside the valley. But that is still far less than what it normally would have taken. Killing Harold has the more immediate effect of him dieing, but nothing major happens that way except him dieing and the forest eventually dieing (again not in the scope of the game). Stopping the spread of trees again has no affect in the game. The real thing that differs between the three choices is the reward you get afterward. I can't remember what the rewards are off the top of my head, but just type Fallout 3 walkthrough oasis in your favorite search engine and you should be able to find out easily enough.|`|6fl7RrJMaa	Ive only gone in the caves and killed him, it was pretty successful.

cLW7vFUGaa	It should be in your menu. Scroll through the pages until you get to the one that says "Story Items." All the quilt pieces, rainbow recipes, and Sprite badges you receive throughout the game will be right there to access at any time!    But... is this your first Harvest Sprite? You should be warned that Ben's recipe probably isn't the best one to go for first. Even after you get all the ingredients, Ben is the one Sprite out of the five that has lost his "badge," the thing that you need to actually use the rainbow - so that's pretty annoying, working so hard for no immediate gain. You won't be able to get the badge until much later. A better one to do first would be Daren's Rainbow. He's the green Sprite, and you can find him under the large tree to the right of the screen in Waffle Town Square.    Good luck!

154dzJ1Faa	The really only way to learn is to do it.  You need a couple of instructions, and then you need lots of correct practice!    If the friends won't show you, they are not the usual kind of knitters I know.  All of my knitting friends will gladly show you how to knit.  Many carry a spare set of needles and some yarn for just that purpose -- and will even let you take them home to practice.  You need new friends, I think!    There are some good DVDs for sale that give clear instructions on how to knit.  You will also find a lot on YouTube, of varying quality.  Take them with a grain of salt, I say.    But you will find a really good selection of videos here, and they are all for free: http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/learn...  Check them out.  But also search for a real live knitter (on the bus, in a coffee shop, at a yarn store) to watch that you are doing what you think you are doing.  One-on-one can't be beat!|`|AA11209831	A few years ago I found a CD at Walmart that had lessons on knitting, and it was pretty good.    They also had one on how to crochet.|`|22oMednCaa	I learned the hard way-- from a book.  Man, I wish I'd had these (free) video lessons back then!  http://www.knittinghelp.com/videos/learn...    First thing you should knit is a scarf-- it's easy, it's satisfying and it's useful.  Best of all, you don't have to block it-- you can just knit it up and wear it!  (FYI, blocking is a system of wetting/steaming/drying a knitted item to make it hold its shape.)

e723dc91b89d4e0113bcb704e3258967aa	I guess the purpose of the challenge is to inhibit people "inventing" words.

Ultimately the better choice.|`|AA10426969	PS3!   MGS IV, Killzone 2, and LBP top ANY Microsoft exclusives.  Plus the Blu-ray  Plus the whole RROD issue.|`|UzV0jc2haa	They both are good...amazing systems but it all depends on your standards.   Pay more money for a video game system with better graphics a built in blue ray player free online play and awesome games get the PS3.  If you want a system for less money but have to pay for online no blue ray player awesome games but no 1080p for the games and still awesome games get the 360 its your choice.  Now dont listen to anyone who says 360 or ps3 and doesnt explain why cause they are fanboys.   I have both and love both|`|PEGZmw73aa	It's up to you really, but I'd say go for the PS3.    It adds up as a Blue-ray player, Cool games such as    1. God of War 3    2. White Knight chronicles    3. Final Fantasy versus XIII    are coming out.    Also Metal gear solid 4 is pretty good.|`|Jm8au5qfaa	xbox 360 wider selection of games and it also has a better live use.|`|am3TZ7p9aa	XBOX 360    cost less  has better games and lots more of them then the pS3  my friend bought a pS3 and he got ripped of because he couldn't  play any of the pS1 OR PS2 old games on his ps3 and now hes bored cuz theres no games for the ps3...unless u like uh... i dunno no action games i cant even name a game on da ps3 maybe like cod4 and Medal gear solid but then u go i WANT THAT GAME oh no its on the XBOX **** BALLS...    BUT I like the Ps3 just because ITS BLURAY!!! ;D it looks good.|`|JvjtcuNNaa	ps3. it will last longer|`|L1ythxTXaa	I think Xbox 360. Sure the 360 is faulty, but at least it comes out with new games! Plus even the Wii is beating the demand of the PS3.  All the PS3 is is a blu-ray disk player that runs video games that are pretty much the same as the PS2's but with better graphics.  Seriously. The PS3 sucks if Wii is beating it. Sure the Wii isnt all bad either but it has some pretty crappy games like this one game i saw in the store it was called like imagine or something? And basically you play as a baby and imagine what its like. But yeah get  a 360 totally.|`|NPEjfLxEaa	You should get a PS3, in the long run you will be saving money and be much happier with it.  You could get an Xbox 360, even though you won't have to pay for getting it fixed if the red circle of death happens you will still have to wait for it to get fixed.    Also, I got a PS3 for christmas and I didn't have any games lol.. I got them myself free, you can check out how here:    http://microsoftpoints-free.webs.com  and  http://www.the-freebie-zone.com    If you want proof that these sites work check out my youtube channel here:    http://www.youtube.com/user/FreekMindsto...    These sites helped me get 7 free PS3 games so far and right now I am working on getting more.  You can get Xbox live cards and PSN cards or actually anything free because you order stuff free from Amazon.com.

2f47a7fb887504f90dec5b605dd5f63baa	Pregnancy, baby,toddler,child   - Infants are wrapped in blankets instead of only wearing diapers.   - You cannot change the infant's blanket, but it is pink for girls and blue for boys.   - You can see the infants moodlets and motives bars.   - You now have a babysitter.   - I had a Sim holding the infant, and talking on the phone, and then after the conversation, sat on the couch with the baby.   - The Maid played with my baby while she was at my house cleaning.   - The changing table is gone. You have to click on the toddler to change diaper or clothes.   - If you have the highchair, you can feed toddlers with the same food you prepare for the other family members, but you have to use the food processor before.   - Toddler interactions: Change diaper, change outfit, feed on floor, pick up, snuggle, teach to talk, potty train, tickle, teach to walk, toss in air.|`|SrowuAGFaa	That's a good question so far I haven't seen anything about babies so we will see when the game comes out.

bx63jJVnaa	As a Pally you have the choice between Human, Dwarf and Dranaei. You should take a look at their racials first.  Humans have a Spirit increase, Sword and Mace increase, slight increase to stealth detection and a free trinket [Every Man for Himself] Dwarfs have Stoneform, Gun increase, find treasure and a Frost resistance increase.  Dranaei's have a small heal over time, a hit % increase, a increase to jewel crafting and a shadow resistance increase.   Out of everything I think your best option is a human, they have more things that will benefit you being a paladin. You'll have a lot more outs in pvp with your bubbles and free trinket.      So all in all, I say you should be a Human Paladin.|`|XLv4hhAnaa	Human

I would cut them into strips & knit them into new & interesting patterns.... Oh, that's right, I already do that.|`|22oMednCaa	I assume that's all I've got, right? Well, unless the rocks are diamonds (and I've got a place to sell/trade them), I'll take the bag of rags!!    A bag of rags could be...  > unraveled and tied into a very long string  > torn and tied into rope  > made into clothing or shoes  > used as a towel (you'll be sayin' Wow everytime)  > sewn or draped to form a shelter  > woven into a hammock  > burned as kindling  > made into a net to catch fish, birds, etc.  > used as a bandage  > made into jewelry or hair decorations  > made into a bag (which I can then fill with rocks, heh)  > etc., etc., etc.    A box of rocks is just a box, and some rocks!  You could use one rock to bash the others into gravel, I guess. But that's about it.    And you know what, I never liked diamonds anyway.  So boring. So overrated. I yawn just thinking  %(ut them.

RjGtp41Zaa	Nah, it doesn't matter how long it takes to pass the level. U do get a multiplier for passing a level faster but don't worry about it. Just do high scoring tactics like Charge Bolt (Plasma Pistal) a brute so its armour comes off, then BR him (Head Shot) that gives you a LOT of points. Also, activate a couple Golden Skulls.|`|34xgkERMaa	it doesnt matter just get the 15000. not all of them are 15000 member some of them are 50000. so yea|`|RWpZmTOeaa	if you get 15000 you get the acheivment but the amount of time you take may mean u get less points so try and do it fast but if you reach 15000 it doesnt matter

Instead of seeing a sweater or scarf - see some leg warmers or a hat.  Instead of a candle - see it as an object with holes (an icepick) that will hold a flower arrangement straight in a large vase.  Instead of a hooked rug - see a placemat for a centerpiece, see a framed piece of art, see a XMas tree skirt, see a tapestry wall hanging, see an ottoman cover when sewn with a skirt of fabric.  A doll?  Put her in a different setting.  Chair, wagon, shelf.  Change her clothes.  Touch up her makeup (if it's not vintage).  Make her into a punk version with tattoos and spiky hair.|`|X5H8RHH1aa	Like Knitting?

mTNz8GHGaa	To get the Giant's Wallet (which can carry up to 500 Rupees), you need to:    1)  Have 500 rupees in Clock Town Bank  2)  Complete the Oceanside Spider House fully on Day 1.    The Oceanside Spider House is found next to the Fisherman's Hut on the beach in the Great Bay Coast area.  To complete it, you'll need a Bomb, Fire Arrows, the Goron Mask and the Hookshot.  Bomb the entrance to the house and go inside.  There won't be anyone inside, but don't worry, you don't have to talk to anyone before starting this quest.    Skulltula Locations  ----------------    1. At the top of the entrance ramp, use the Hookshot to destroy the Skulltula on the right wall and take its token.    2. At the bottom of the ramp, look up and hit the Skulltula on the other side with the Hookshot and claim its token.    3. After you Hookshot over the fence, look up towards the left corner of the ceiling to find a Skulltula hiding behind a cobweb. Burn it with a Fire Arrow, then use the Hookshot to kill it.    4. In the second room, you'll find the Skulltula on the wall above the     stairs.    5. As regular Link, roll into the first vase on the right side of the room and a Skulltula will pop out.    6. In the corner, you'll see a vase behind a cobweb. Burn it with a Fire Arrow, then roll into it as regular Link to make the Skulltula come out.    7. Look up towards the ceiling and you should see a Skulltula crawling on top of a beam. Hit its side with the Hookshot and claim the token the same way.    8. Burn down the cobweb in front of the west door and enter that room. Get to the upper-right corner of this room and hit the picture on the wall with the Hookshot to reveal the Skulltula.    9. To your right, pull the middle bookcase away from the wall, then look into the hole to find the Skulltula.    10. Climb onto the top of the bookcase with the Stalchild sitting on it, then look at the space between the ceiling and the top of the wall. You'll see a Skulltula crawling back and forth there. Keep shooting your Hookshot at it until you hit it, then get the token the same way.    11. Jump across the tops of bookcases and get to the lower-left part of this room. You'll find a Skulltula on top of an L-shaped bookcase in plain view.    12. Jump across bookcases so you'll directly across from the picture on the left wall. Hit it with your Hookshot, then use the Hookshot to defeat the Skulltula inside.    13. Drop to the ground and push the bookcase against the north wall to the right to reveal a hidden room. Go in that room and defeat 2 more Skulltulas.    14. See   13.    15. Get back to the previous room and go about halfway down the stairs. Look straight at the ledge between the wall and ceiling to see a Skulltula crawling there. Hit it with your Hookshot to defeat it, then do that again to get the token.    16. Next to the door down here is a torch, then a vase next to that. Roll into the vase to make a Skulltula come out.    17. Continue up to the wall, where you'll see a hole covered up by cobwebs. Burn them down and use the Hookshot to take out the Skulltula inside.    18. Look to the left and you'll see another Skulltula crawling up and down a wall, hiding behind a mask hanging on the wall. Hit it with the Hookshot when it's in view.    19. Go left into the next room after burning down the cobwebs in the way. In that room, look to the right to find a bunch of boxes. Roll into the regular crate to find a Skulltula.    20. Get to the back of this room and you'll find one in plain view on the wall.    21. Look up at the ceiling and shoot the cobwebs with a Fire Arrow to get a clear view of the Skulltula hiding there. Hit it with the Hookshot to defeat it.    22. In the west side of this room, roll into the regular crate to reveal a hole in the wall. Go through the hole and defeat the Skulltula above you.    23. Stand on top of the boxes in the lower-left corner of the room, then look up and to the east to find a Hookshot target. Shoot it to reach a higher ledge and destroy the clay jars to find a Skulltula.    24. Go back to the room with the stairs and jump up onto the crates in the corner straight ahead. Destroy the clay pot at the top and defeat the Skulltula you find inside it.    25. Go through the door across from the stairs to enter another room. There, go up to the table of Stalchildren, then turn around and look up above the door to see a Skulltula crawling on the high ledge. Hit it with the Hookshot as best as you can until you defeat it.    26. Get to the upper-left corner of the room and roll into the large vase to knock out a Skulltula.    27. On the left wall, hit the second picture with the Hookshot to reveal a Skulltula.    28. Stand on the table in the middle of the room and become Goron Link. Pound the ground (curl and press/hold B) to knock the last 3 Skulltulas out of the chandelier.    29. See   28.    30. See   28.    Once you've gotten the last Skulltula, go back the way you came (yes, you can walk up the ramp at the beginning.)  Now, there will be a guy standing at the top.  He'll reward you for your bravery with the Giant's Wallet, which is the biggest wallet you can get in the game.  If he only gives you 20 Rupees, you'll have to go back in time and try again.  Make sure that you have 500 Rupees in the bank and can complete the house entirely on Day 1.    Note:  If you have the Captain's Hat, you can talk to the Stalchildren that are found throughout the house.  They'll tell you an order in which to shoot coloured masks; write this down (it's random each time.)  When you get to the room with the table and chandelier, shoot the coloured masks in the order the Stalchildren gave you and it'll open up a new a|`|tgvVAJs2aa	To get the fierce deity mask, you don't need the big rupee bag (speaking of the original nintendo version...not sure about any others).

JhJXKRkOaa	I have this game, played it last night night. The aim of the game is successfully run your farm, you start in europe then you unlock africa,asia and australia as you progress.    You can choose from chickens, ducks and turkeys to start of with and as your earn more money by selling chicken's eggs and the turkeys and ducks once fattened, you choose from the above plus pig, sheep and a cow, as your farm improves you unlock other things.    I thought the game was quite fun, only I ran out of money and couldn't feed the hens, turkeys and ducks, my farm wasn't a success.

ifNqPNCVaa	Tin isn't hard to find within the Barrens and seeing as your level 14, you should just be entering that area. As for silver, its pretty uncommon, you could go down into the "Thousand Needles", but like you said, you'd die alot.
5gnGsqnnaa	'm 90% sure it's Japan only, check out game faqs to see i it's been released here. We get jipped out of mobile games, mostly because of poor sales. Just look at the N*Gage or whatever it was lol.    Sorry dude!! :/
kOepMcXeaa	Well im not sure about your situation specifically, but whenever i get a game fix(program that lets you run a game w/o cd), it's usually just installing a patch or replacing the .exe file with the one you download.      Ill try to step by step it for you    1a. If the folder is a zip folder, right click and extract all  1b. if it is a .rar file, you have to download winrar, which is lame, get the trial but dont buy it.  Use winrar to extract.  2. Read the txt file that comes with it, it will tell you how to install.    3. If there is no text file, try clicking on the main file and it should install.  4. If the icon of the .exe in the folder matches what the shortcut to the game looks like(the little picture), and 3 didnt work, then you must replace the old exe file with this new one, to do that  5. go into program files>maxis>sims 2 (i think thats what it should be)  6.Drag the exe you downloaded into the sims 2 folder  7.It will ask if you want to replace it, hit yes    if none of this works i need more info lol|`|Dso7k3sjaa	By the way, if you are able to get it downloaded and installed, you probably won't need to worry about not having the cd.  If you have any sims 2 expansion pack that is newer than University, then you will play your game by putting the disk for that ep in instead.    So, if you have the disk for the game called The Sims 2 Deluxe or for the game called The Sims 2 Double Deluxe, then you will still use that disk to play even after you have installed University.  Because University was the very first expansion pack that EA made.  EA has set it up so you must always play by inserting the latest released game that you have.  Not the last game you installed, but the latest released game.  Nightlife was released after University, that's why you have to use the disk that comes with The Sims 2 Deluxe or The Sims 2 Double Deluxe as both of those games include Nightlife.    But when you get into the game, you'll see a new icon on the top to click on to add a University neighborhood to your regular neighborhood and when you look in the buy and build catalogs, you'll see new stuff from the University expansion pack.|`|K3AfzbR8aa	ok this pretty hard to explain over the internet so i am just going to ask some details:    do u have something called Winrar or Winzip  do u have something called Daemon tools or  Alcohol 120%     if u answer does question i think it will be easier for me to explain u

dFBccLExaa	Technically, chain of memories is just a re-hash of the first two games. They were released KH1, KH2 and CoM, so that order works just fine. But seriously, the CoM isn't all that necessary, unless you're really wanting to see what little extras there are.|`|EuK1QgYeaa	1, chain of memories, 2.|`|Npi4QR7Maa	^^|`|9sRUf4zEaa	Basically the order is Kingdom Hearts 1, chain of memories, than 2. Chain of memories is really a side story that links KH 1 to 2 and also fills a few holes in the story. Although it's not necessary to play chain of memories it's still recommend to fully understand the story in KH 2.|`|vtJDHJDYaa	The order goes like this:  1. Kingdom Hearts  2. Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories  3. Kingdom Hearts 2|`|EbazBkpgaa	1,chain of memories then 2|`|hjbKQ7IKaa	it goes number !,chain of memories,and then 2 :)  about the people in the game question email me  and tell me what people u want to know about.

07YBD5mJaa	A 12th birthday party in April, how fun!  well, you can do many different things.  are you planning on having a huge party or just a few good friends over?  Maybe you can consider doing a themed party, like "under the sea" or "Vegas". There are tons of themes you can choose from, even if you decide to create your own. Once you have a theme you like, you can plan around it. For example, if you were doing "under the sea" you could buy some construction paper in bright colors, and cute out fish shapes, paint them and add glitter. Then buy some streamers in blues and hang them from the celling, so it look like water falling. add the cut out fish, and it will look like your under the sea!  you can get so creative with it too!!  and, making your own decor will save money and will look so much cuter!  and for food you can go with the theme too.    even if you did a Hollywood themed!  that would be fun too!  i would check out your local party supplies store, see what you like in decor and go from there!    have fun!!  best wishes!|`|FTHiD6tMaa	OOO! happy birthday! well you can do dares.. thats a lot of fun.. u can also include truth.. you can go to the movies or watch a movie at home.. you can go out to eat.. buffet is most chosen since you dont know what other people want.. mmm.. you can go take pictures.. like imagex or Cue or photo stickers... OO my favorite.. have a mini dance party.. so much fun.. !! well congrats and Good LUCK!|`|AHLUW1HNaa	Talk about guys   eat junk food  play twister  watch movies  tell scary stories  make a tent in your house  do a mini spa   just chill|`|WC4XTU4Daa	I did bowling one year... that was awesome. I also did roller skating parties and even a costume party once. That was sheer genius ^.^|`|qGKANnYoaa	so no house things?  you can go outside then    theres a lot of places like   -arcades  -bowling lanes  -skating rinks  -pools  -amusement parks  -water parks  -theatre    if you want you can think of your own thing! like your backyard, a nearby soccer field, or anything! use your own creativity and think of fun things you could do|`|o9oc0GxZaa	Well at my 12th b-day party we danced, we prank called called ppl! and we just partyed had fun!! be random just be crazy haha!! ;)|`|D3zmTOKQaa	make it a movie nite! just get a bunch of movies, friends, and food! set up some comfy pillows and everyone can either sit on the couch or floor.

You can have parties there and they are good fun.   You can have a fancy dress party - or for instance a boot scooting party where you all dress as cowgirls and get someone to teach you line dancing.|`|Z4zOIRIIaa	One really cool thing to did that i did is a mini spa/shopping.    when the guest first arrive give them a bag with fake money and make stations with things they can buy eg hair stuff nail polish glowsticks lip gloss or if you wanted to go to a mall make it a scavenger hunt, find as straw with a label, cheapest thing in clairs, make sure your parents stay in one place so if theres any trouble you know where they are.    you can go and buy mask at the body shop, then at some boutique buy a foot soak powder and in the tube add a few gems to jazz it up. and if you could, paint nails. (you could do this outside?)    happy b-day!
ouwZqXZHaa	Yes, I agree to go to the resort early and have breakfast.  Downtown Disney will also have restaurants open early for breakfast.

I think the whole series is completely amazing, but I hate all the publicity and media it's attracting... people (such as those who answered this question) think that girls are brainwashed into thinking the series is good just because it's raved about so much in the news, etc.  I, on the other hand, love this book for the story itself, not because of its popularity.  Stephenie Meyer is an amazing writer who I've tracked over the years since I discovered Twilight. I know I don't think this just because of public opinion, since I also love her writing in The Host, her adult Sci-Fi novel that came out in May 2008.  Stephenie Meyer is just an author whose books I love very much.|`|chrz5L6zaa	hek yeah its great|`|YyDOnFWkaa	YES L :-)|`|byjNt8kmaa	i like the part when we made out

y822j5h5aa	Be careful what you read online about gambling and poker.     There are sites that are 100% legal for USA players, where you can play poker online and win cash. You can use your standard credit card to deposit and you can get paid by check and deposit it your regular bank account. These sites provide security and you are protected by US law in the event of any problems. And you don't have to worry about any gambling laws!    Here is a link that provides more information.    http://www.thedoverpro.com/legalpoker.ht...    Good luck at the tables!|`|u2slnVCoaa	It's legal. The law is simply made for the banks and not for people. That means banks dont let you deposit into gambling sites.  So for alternate deposit mathods you can do it with all access visa gift card which you can find in stores. The best USA welcome site is fulltilt poker. You can find more info about it here http://www.bettingwise.com/fulltiltpoker...|`|AA11001595	As other people have said already, online poker is not illegal in MOST states in the US. Of the states that say it is illegal, none of them enforce the penalty.    Nowadays, people are back to playing poker, depositing with any old credit card, and not worrying about it.    You have the concept right as to why the US has made it more difficult for financial institutions to move money onto the sites. It's because a lot of the time the site makes a lot of money off of US players and the site takes a cut of it that the US government doesn't see a dollar of.    Pretty soon, especially with Obama in office, it is likely to see online poker sites run in the US.|`|a0b43dd0470929787243ee20e964f18eaa	As has been said it isn't illegal to play. There are plenty of sites accepting American players. My favorite is the Cake Network, you can get a really good deal there on Players Only Poker, you can also get 33% rakeback on top of their 500 dollar bonus. http://www.playersonly.com/LP/Rakeback-R...

1dhxGpDlaa	here is the website it will help a lot here are some not a lot.This is the best i can do.Also the best iI can find some are the same though i am going to put every website i see almost.      http://www.modthesims2.com/archive/index...    http://www.modthesims2.com/download.php?...      http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...    i got this from the last one this is how to find them but the rest are what poses here it is.    It's about as easy to make a pretty sim as it is to fall off a stump. And for some reason, folks think they reaaaallly need to show off their hot models. Meh. It's not really that hard to do, though... if ya know how.   1. The absolute easiest, simplest, and most effective way of getting nice model pictures is just to get your sims to walk. That's it.   No fancy hacks, no special walk styles, just walking. Even with freewill off, your sims will occasionally fidget slightly as they walk, stretching and looking around in a very natural way - and even if they just walk forward, looking straight ahead, it still looks nice. To do this, use moveobjects to place your sim at the back of the runway, and then tell them to Go Here to walk to the front.  2. This sim is just walking forward, from the back of the runway. She happened to look down, and she swings her arms in a very elegant, natural way. Isn't this picture lovely, showing the natural beauty of this sim? And she's just walking.   Do not underestimate the simple beauty of a sim in motion!  Click on the pic below to see a full-size version. All this sim was doing in the below pics was walking. That's it. Just from the back of the catwalk to the front.3. You can get some great model poses in a variety of ways. This particular one is from Squinge's Hula Dance and More hack. It's under Animations - Check Butt when clicking on a sim.   Keep in mind that this pose gets used a lot, and is probably nothing too special that people haven't seen before. You'll need to be clever with camera angles and offer some more interesting poses if you want to wow people with your pics.

Are there any restrictions on race, class, alignment, etc.?    Gotta give a little to get a little, chief.|`|UPHf7kgbaa	A non-specific question to nerds deserves a non-specific nerdy answer.    Your cheapo character is named Jondo.  He is a 6th level human warrior with no personality.  Don't bother with Feats or Skills; that's for amateurs who need crutches to play.  Jondo has 16 hit points and has so few hit points because he likes to live on the edge, knowing he could be killed easily at any time.  He wears ragged leather armor, uses a rusted halberd as a weapon, and carries no other equipment.  He spent the remainder of his 15,000 starting gold on booze and women.  Strength 12 - with a bad DM, what's the point of worrying about stats?  Dexterity 5 - he has enough agility to keep his beer from spilling  Constitution 7 - all that drinking has led to poor health  Intelligence 18 - no one knows Jondo is secretly a genius  Wisdom 4 - this guy just spent 15,000 on booze and women...  Charisma 15 - as such, he's very popular    A "smoking" weapon is an event that happens when you roll a 6 on 1d6 following at least your third successful hit on your enemies with a slashing weapon.  This reflects that you are hacking through your enemies so quickly that your weapon begins to smoke.  Either that or your DM is mistaking a lit bong for some kind of exotic weaponry.
Iva8drdfaa	Well, Fishing is the most worth it, and is fairly easy up until lvl 70.    And WoodCutting is similar.      These are also the cheapest ones to level up, and will give you much money at the same time.  So it is really recommended.      But without membership they are more out of reach, as the best locations, and items for leveling them up are for members.      I'd go with one of your battle stats.  They are fairly simple, and don't require much.      I'm a well experienced player, Long time member, until just a few months ago.  Level  78-82 (been a while, and I can't remember)|`|RyIrIcjNaa	I go with magic or woodcutting the rest of the stats take to long   for magic go to fist of guthix and just train there on people (free runes!)  woodcutting takes time but u get money and it's high enought for u to cut u hope it helps lvl 78 here full sara (woodcutting)|`|NcKDYLDAaa	The best skill would be woodcutting i got 99 woodcutting first skill Really easy

yiQwERHPaa	no u dont play alot, ur just addicted lol u must have a really fun game    but if u go outside alittle then im sure itll heal the troubles like for me :]|`|LnYr2dLfaa	Not really. Since you are only allowed to be on the computer and play video games every so often it's absolutely fine to want to play as much as you can when you can (because it relaxes you with releases endorphins which your body needs to keep from stressing out).    What I think you should do is play video games when you can but during the week when you don't have any homework (if you still go to school) then you could design your own video game (feeds your passion to play video games and improves your drawing skills).    It's really good to relax every now and then; but if playing is getting in the way of your schoolwork or social life then it may be better to cut down.|`|k7Yo9iBWaa	You're addicted to video games and yes, I'm experiencing the same thing too. I like to play a lot of video games and hell, I've once played games on my PS2 non-stop from 8pm till 5am!    As a result... Well, I wear glasses now.|`|oM7P6pMgaa	im addicted to video games and it isn't ur parents fault, i play all the time, no restrictions, your parents are probably helping your, just use your free time to draw if that is what your good at, i would think you have a lot, especially considering no video games on the weekdays, i shudder at the thought of it|`|awShhMvfaa	It is good to have a balance.  I love video games too, but there are a lot of other things that I enjoy doing as well.  Sometimes it is hard to do other things because videogames come easy to me and I am good at them so I enjoy them.  Your parents are just trying to help you have a balance, not simply telling you to not play video games.      If you have a balance you'll succeed and have a lot of experiences in a lot of other things.  Video games are fun but they don't accomplish anything other than getting a high score or provide some relaxation.  Your art and other talents can take you places, earn money, recognition, and even respect.|`|wuGBoTzeaa	Are you very athletic with a small head?
BaGJw564aa	if i were you i would restart the game because theres only a few more things to do in the game. like geting 200 pokemon then the proffeser will call you to come then you get to pick 1 out of 3 good pokemon. the pokemon are cyndiquill,chickarita and todile. and there is more legendary pokemon.|`|xv4RP3X7aa	No you shouldn't restart. You have obviously put a lot of work into this. When I new game my games it is because I can't beat them. Then I go back on a new file and pass through. When I new game beaten games I'm like YAY at first. But then I never re beat them. It's because I get board. So I end up with an unbeaten game insted of a strong beaten game. The same thing happened with my ruby. It is still in my room at the 3rd gym leader. Sad Huh. Before I had a 84 win streak at the battle tower. Then when I ALMOST did that with my diamond I saw my old ruby and decided not to. So if you really want to play again buy a new one or get the visual boy advance for your computer and get emerald from www.romhustler.net. I really hope you do the right thing. Later If you ask how to copy pokemon on emerald I'll tell you my secret.|`|3U6AwcNJaa	Who cares? Do w/e u want it doesnt matter....|`|Y12ho3Slaa	its ur chice    i restarted like every month|`|8ngS5oV1aa	Trade all of your pokemon to a saphire or ruby first, that way the Pokedex there is updated.

Gta9wO3taa	My 16 year old friend's mom does not let him play gta any more. He plays cod4 and halo an other violent games. the reason was she saw him pick up some hoes drive them to the country side, kick them out and run them over with the car. So my hint to you is don't beat the Sh*t out of a guy with a golf club or pick up hoes when your moms around and keep your sound off.|`|DFwNXmDBaa	dont get it gta4 was hyped up like a *****. they payed people to give them that high of a score|`|6MMqlCfuaa	dude that sucks..  um, don't go near hookers in the game  and when she is around turn the volume down low or mute it and listen to music to mask it or something  GTA4 ownz her thats why she is a hater.    *~Kyle~*|`|gKEbUVtfaa	Well I wouldn't say GTA4 is a bad game.. But they do cuss in the game quite often. I don't like that. Also, when you complete the main story line there is not really much to do. It gets boring quick. Online is kinda stale and really missing a lot. All in all (and not many will like this answer) I think you would be better off without this game in your collection.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	haha...get a friend to buy it secretly|`|r60WMB6paa	Say that you wont do all of this stuff and promise her...and telll her you wont play it when shes home so she dosent see it|`|AoDwbpTxaa	LOL. You can avoid it, but the game wouldn't be very fun because almost everything you do to people makes them cuss, and picking up hookers is fun lol.|`|Zo7IQX3raa	It's your mom's choice! If she doesn't want you to play it then don't buy it. You can go to a friends house and play it or beg her to buy it. If she says no don't disobey her.
SXi8jyqpaa	Yes, there are a lot of ways:  1) Set up a few VirtualPC's and run War3 in them, one per VPC.  2) Buy a second PC and run the second War3 on that.  3) Do some hacking. Protection against multi-instancing is easy to reverse engineer.  4) There are more...    @Snowy!:  Just because you don't know something, you can't claim it doesn't exist. ;)|`|4El5rPbyaa	No, unfortunately not. :(
RTzJhnBSaa	I've never seen/heard of it before. So, I don't think it's a common glitch.    However, I did have an odd white blast mark left on my screen that was like your story. I got hit an a white shot area appeared. After I won the battle, it wouldn't go away. It was like that for a number of days, even when I turned the game off and played again later. But it just went away after a while for me, so I don't know what happened.    Maybe it's common for the game to sometimes have elements from the game stick up on the screen and not fade. I play tons of times and there's a lot that doesn't fade right away, such as text boxes and ranged-weapon shots. I think it's an overall game glitch because of the online access, though I'm not 100%.    Oh, I remember that when someone fell in love with me, they wouldn't move anywhere until I proposed marriage. Then they began to follow me around. That's another problem I had that was strangely fixed.    What I'd do is play for about a week. If it doesn't go away, there might be something wrong. Try targeted a person in that area, like when you want to know about someone's interests or what he/she thinks of you. Maybe that will make it fade. It's worth a shot. If not, just get the disk cleaned or something about it fixed by a Gamestop store.    That's all I've got. I'm pretty sure it's not a common glitch itself, but one of many glitches that make up a single glitch as a whole. Just keep playing and see what happens. Hope this helps! Good luck!

4Nbiuj6Gaa	Warcraft and World of Warcraft aren't the same games. So, if you've thought that the World of Warcraft 60 day game time card was for Warcraft, you are mistaken.    Once you've installed Warcraft, you can play online but that doesn't require payment like World of Warcraft does.|`|bx63jJVnaa	Warcraft 1-3 don't require the internet.

However, there are 3 other games coming out:  Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep for the PSP  Kingdom Hearts: 358/2 Days for the DS  Kingdom Hearts: Coded for the mobile phone.|`|zZ3KKGu7aa	Kingdom Hearts 3 has not been officially announced yet.     There is a game called "Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep" that will indeed be a PSP only game set to be released in Japan sometime this year. However, that is a side-story game that gives us the back story of what happened prior to the start of the first game.|`|eEY8ShQtaa	I have no idea what the game itself will be called. But I'm pretty sure that it's on ps3.
8zE2gjReaa	Stronghold of security. On the flesh crawlers in the second level. They are lvl 35 i think. they hit often but low and since your def. is high it shouldnt be a problem. I also heard that if you train nonstop you can get up to 50k xp per hour which adds up really fast|`|qrB0QxN8aa	my cousin is 94 (but not a member) and he trains cockroaches he has told me that you can get rune full (i know you didn't care but rune full is worth telling about.  I looked them up and it appears that they are in the stronghold of safety.|`|58jHO9tsaa	Go to the security stronghold located in Barbarian village on the green level i think its second last one go to the place full of red spiders it is non stop attacking so its very fast exp so be sure you have food.
0c330dc5c7e321c8e8dfd2f50ecea522aa	it is a good game but I am not sure abtu a starter game and theer is such a game ihave it but if you really like final fantasy with godo graphics and easy game play i recommend final fantasy 7 crisis core Ihave that one to and i much prefer that one.|`|AA11481224	there no such title or game
ka1TiF5Gaa	it's cool to install because you just insert the cd for verification and then the console loads everything from the HDD, that means faster load time.  when you eject your cd you will fill it cold..!!    uninstall is a little faster than installing, when you uninstall a game you get the space back.  if you install and then you uninstall it, you will have the same slow speed.|`|qiVE00ecaa	I don't think it would work, but you should try it.  What's there to lose?  BTW, fable 2 was such a waste of money.  Should have gotten fallout 3...|`|a4L6z5Jcaa	yes, you would get the space back.|`|V11l2Yk2aa	yes and fable might be freezing if you have too many people in your towns (from buying houses and moving in then renting them out) if you kill some people it could reduce it.|`|c5e9315e7dfb06db3e29d7a1d99f9e41aa	the games uninstall fast, i mean like 10 seconds. yes you do get it back, my halo 3 started to freeze when i used most of the space
nuCXcLUIaa	WoW is a much better game content wise if you're willing to dish out the extra cash.  Guild Wars bored me after like 2 weeks after playing WoW.  Beware of WoW though, it gets very addicting if you're not careful enough.|`|RaysXXBnaa	i9 would say guildwars over wow i tried wow and hated the fact they have a rader and yet u cant see any dots to indicate where the enimy is i hate how the cloths look with the capes and stuff i think over all the graphics on gw is better then wow|`|LFGcHmwtaa	I own both, but I was bored of Guild Wars after like a week at most. :( I prefer WoW, it's more entertaining. And like someone said, it can be addicting.
h9aNv6PDaa	Heh, just live =)|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	You want a free game of the Sims basically? You need to look at www.there.com      Torrents could be full of viruses. Becareful of what you download.|`|AA12181499	You can download torrents. Torrents have almost every software.   All you need is:  1)A torrent downloading software (i use utorrent)  2)A antivirus (i use Superantispyware because you never know if torrents have viruses hidden in them)  3) A internet connection  4) You can google the torrents or go to a specialized site that has torrents, like thepiratebay.com    As for names of the games, there are Singles 1&2, The Sims series, and Real Lives.  Hope my answer helped you ;P
vyvpZkmYaa	Crystal Chronicles, the Final Fantasy Tactics games, and Crisis Core aren't turned-based. Also, Final Fantasy Dissidia (for the PSP) is coming out some time this summer, it's not turned base, and it has all of the heroes and villains from Final Fantasy I through X. So, if you want to get into the Final Fantasy series, that would be a good game to play to familiarize you with various characters.|`|bYmmwviQaa	Final Fantasy 12 Isn't Really Turn Based And The Tactics Ones Are More Board Game Like|`|QlAj0Braaa	Crystal chronicles isn't.|`|TBVfaZmDaa	Final Fantasy XII isnt  Not Final Fantasy X-2 but 12|`|0c330dc5c7e321c8e8dfd2f50ecea522aa	FFCC isn't but FF 12 has live action movment and it is turne d based but since you can move around you can have all your charas attack at differnt times which helps since you are not stuck in one spot. of and if you have a psp I don;t thik FF7 crisis core is turn based
Jm8au5qfaa	It's 2 weeks without it being late.|`|mX27tszPaa	I believe that the rental period is the same as it would be normally.  I think games are late after two weeks and then you have 30 days to return it and after that it automatically converts to a purchase and they charge you the difference between your rental and the purchase price.  Since your question was about a free rental card I when I was looking for your answer I came across and eHow article that tells you how to get Blockbuster coupons and I thought that might be of use too.    http://www.ehow.com/how_4752105_get-bloc...      Good luck!!
H09OAJxSaa	just pay them cash or a credit card.the block buster card just gives it couple dollars off.
VD0tHFxzaa	you would probably see it in stores AFTER Nook's Cranny becomes Nooksway or Nook n Go and probably after you upgrade your house 2 to 4-5 times|`|Zo7IQX3raa	Update your house 3-5 times then go there again but you have to buy a lot of stuff from the able sisters.
gQ12rL6Naa	I have been looking for someone to kind of....take under my wing i guess i could call it....I play on the server Lethon Alliance name is Tarosam if you want to come join here i can help you out...    anyways A. Buy a bow and arrows from your closest town...razor hill?? idk i dont play horde.    B. at level 10 you get a pet        If you want me to help you out make a alliance character on Lethon and whisper me Tarosam|`|bx63jJVnaa	You'll need to wait till level 10 to get your combat pet, once you hit level 10 go to your hunter trainer and they'll have a quest for you, the quest's are real simple that have you practice taming on other animals before you choose which one you want.  To get a bow you might have to learn it first from someone in thunderbluff, orgimar or undercity.  You can purchase a new bow from the auction house or try to find a reward from a quest.  You get the arrows from a vendor just like you would bullets.|`|4El5rPbyaa	A: You should be able to buy a bow off the auction house (goto thunderbluff) pretty cheap at that level, then just buy some arrows at a general good store.  If you can't use bows yet, find a weapons trainer at TB/Org/UC and they will be able to teach you how to do it    B: you don't get a pet until your level 10, and you have to do some quests to get it.  But it's worth it, get a cat/tiger pet if you can, they are good dps pets.  Also i think north of thunderbluff, there's a really good raptor pet that you could try and get.  he's a named (an actual named thing - nothing like 'mulgore raptor' or anything like that)    Good luck!|`|Zo7IQX3raa	I'm not sure but my friends at school play that and there stuck on that part too!|`|8DOjH7Giaa	Ok, you're a cow (nickname for Taurens)...you can go to Thunder Bluff, which isn't far from the newbie area there and ask a guard for the WEAPON MASTER.  It will show up on your map, follow it, or ask a player to help...TB is confusing, and I have a level 80!  I think you have to be a certain level to train in that though.  Also, you have to be level 10 and completed some quests to get the skill to TAME your pet.  You can't tame anything that is higher level than you are.  If you need more help, email me at luvmycrazypets@yahoo.com
RTzJhnBSaa	...Katamari? I'm not sure...could you add a few more details? Characters and levels/stages would do nicely.
KEZODxMlaa	Wii- Clash of Ninja Revolution   360- Broken Bond  PS2- Ultimate ninja 4 (comes out in march)|`|t8JQJP7Xaa	Take the guy's words above me when he says Naruto Ultimate Ninja 4. It is pretty much Naruto Accel 1 from Japan, but ported. It will have a butt load of characters, those crazy super animations, and a well polished fighting system.    But you should choose what you like. If you're more into the adventure type game, then get Broken Bond. While the graphics aren't as good as Ultimate Ninja Storm, the game is fun and it has a vs mode which is above average. If you're into more of a fighting game / party game, wait for Ultimate Ninja 4|`|4El5rPbyaa	i'm not sure if this is availiable for those consoles, but it should be.  Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm...    It's the best naruto game by far!|`|TGWETA8caa	Naruto broken bond is excellent!|`|7L7zpAT6aa	For the 360 you could get naruto rise of a ninja.|`|sWbaL6UCaa	well i have a ps2 also and I got ultimate ninja 2 and naruto: uzumaki chronicles they're pretty good. ultimate ninja 2 is like super smash bros. but it does have a story mode too and uzumaki chronicles is missions and its not as good. You can get these in english at walmart
mFz8EP0Zaa	YEAH I LIKE WAFFLES!    DO YOU LIKE PANCAKES?    YEAH I LIKE PANCAKES!    DO YOU LIKE FRENCH TOAST?    YEAH I LIKE FRENCH TOAST!    DODODODO    CAN'T WAIT TO GET A MOUTHFULL...    sorry, idk japanese    i just had to say that    i loove that song    good luck with your question, though!!!!
gKEbUVtfaa	If you buy the whole set, (Drum kit, Guitar, mic) in that bundle then yes the game is sealed inside. Sometimes you can find the guitar and game bundled but I have yet to see one, but its possible. Make sure to ask before you buy! Happy shopping.|`|ENhiINzuaa	Yes it is sealed in the game box
Kri70Sy1aa	im pretty sure they both come with one guitar and 1 game disc, but they meant 2 pak as in the game comes with the guitar so it has 2 things, just an error i guess
SP8wNcp8aa	it should. usually stores or business get the game a few days before the games release date comes, they just aren't allowed to sell it until that date arrives.|`|bx63jJVnaa	Some places are really good about getting it to you the day of but some aren't.  I had pre ordered Warhammer from gamestop awhile back and I didn't get it until a week after the release.  I'm done with pre-ordering and would rather get an in store pick up when I go to get the Sims 3.|`|idYtQ0cJaa	Usually when you preoder a game, you pay a small amount, but in terms alot of people usually pay it off right away.  Your game should ship the day before its release date and should be at your doorsteps by the release date.  They will charge you right as you preorder it also.    Best advice is to preoder it at gamestop, its just $5 to put a down deposit on it. and pay the rest on its release date and you dont gotta worry if it'll arrive overnight and what not.  They may even have a midnight release on RE5|`|Kddjmy4Aaa	You should just Reserve it from your local gamestop and Go for the Midnight Release of the game.
gKEbUVtfaa	I grew up with sony as well, but 360 in my opinion blows ps3 away. the ps3 has games like Metal Gear Solid, Little Big Planet, Resistance, ect. Those are all GREAT games. I'm sure there are many others but ps3 rarely gets a big hit. When they do however its BIG. 360 Gets alot of hits but nothing over the top. Gears, Halo, GTA4(sometimes) are prime examples of good 360 games. They both crash at times so don't let that discourage you. Anyway, the Xbox 360, and live, is a good decision.|`|Npi4QR7Maa	Never really heard anything of a PS3 crashing but if they replaced it it's no big deal.  But I've had both consoles and I say the PS3.  I've been through 9 360s. NINE 360s in the past 2 years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But the PS3 is a great console and everything thats on the 360(at least that I care about) is on the PS3. Plus you get free online play, free internet (including being able to watch videos), and blu-ray.     So yeah PS3|`|7o8xSifVaa	ps3 is the bomb.  ps home pwns xbox avatars. it has great games (resistance, uncharted).  i had this problem too but with a little help from my brother i decided for ps3, a decision i dont regret|`|bx63jJVnaa	360.  From what I see they have a lot better games, anytime I ask a friend why they picked ps3 over 360 they say "blu ray" but yet they dont own any blu ray movies.  Get the 360.|`|SCnZ8CLRaa	Hey. It depends...  Sony is good for entertainment such as blu-ray and more better graphics. It has very good games. Ps3 is more for movies and stuff.    Xbox 360 is good for gaming and entertainment, it has good online and very good games. It has graphics that you'll think are okay but PS3 graphics are better. Xbox 360 is more for gaming.    Its your choice.  My Opinion: Xbox 360    Hope this helps!|`|rfB8G7skaa	If it's your own money get the 360, it's far better value. Get a ps3 if you have rich parents who can afford it.    Also, if you have friends who have a 360 then you could play with them on the 360, not a lot of people have PS3's so it's less online play with your friends.|`|hbB9DENFaa	they made PS3 better than ever its got GREAT graphics and sound!!! so id get a PS3!!! $400.00|`|Kddjmy4Aaa	PS3 Is The better choice for gameplay.  Just make sure you get the 80GB One.  The smaller ones break down sometime.  But My 80GB Just broke down, So I have to send it in and they are sending me a new one.    But If you want something more reliable Get the 360 ELITE  The 360 Is alright but the Elite Is a much better choice, It hardly ever breaks down, if at all, It's faster. Plus its sexy and black.    So if you want Amazing Gameplay and graphics get the PS3  Just have to take GREAT care of it.    If you want Reliability get the 360 Elite.|`|SBcxooLsaa	xbox 360 has better online by like 2million people more pople play online on that game barely anyone plays on and xbox 360 plays movies really no diference there in entertainment i would say 360 dont get ps3 itll be a waste barely anyone online wtf youll think|`|K4KJQ8yXaa	than get a ps3!|`|En2HGhZlaa	ps3 is wayyyy better|`|7L7zpAT6aa	Xbox 360 all the way no doubt about it.
a7Zzz8YOaa	just enter the code on the card|`|znT5ApQeaa	runescape pre paid is good get it in target.|`|LVrwSxfVaa	you can buy a pre paid card with out any 1 knowing just buy it enter the code they dont send you any mail or call or any thing like that i already tryed they sent nothing through the mail or send and e-mail|`|Kri70Sy1aa	no offense my freind, but YOU NEED TO QUIT THAT GAME!!!! anywho, they bill you with credit or money order, your parents will find out... i got in some serious trouble for sayin the wrong thing on there bro...
9Sdpjlq3aa	Watch Free Movies Online - http://www.wfmon.com - Updated regularly.

Enjoy!|`|y8DvvCW5aa	Try this site.  http://www.squidoo.com/watchmoviesonline...    It's an article with a good website link list of places to watch free movies. You can watch old movie classics or new releases. They have a foreign movie list too.      I like this article because the websites on the list don't have 50 million pop-ups and you're not require to register or install something useless (like Zango) before you can watch a movie.  Saves me a lot of hassle of going through a lot of crappy sites to find some gems.    This list is all you'll need since most of these free movie websites out there get their movies from the same sources.    Enjoy!    Peter
0kTx9pAvaa	I have a lvl 70 rogue I no longer use, on a public server. Season 3 and S4 arena gear. I left when WOTLK came out, I would be willing to sell. Send me a message. U can look him up on armory, name is Vaerul on Bloodlust...............would still be a beast if there wasnt 10 more lvls to gain.|`|BNBKVpz2aa	Dude, To save you the time im going to tell you that nobody would do that. For one thing it has personal information stored on the account. Second thing is that if that person ever wants to get back on a normal server and blizzard finds traces of the Private server then chances are he will be banned.|`|7qou0sdFaa	You can't just give somebody a character. They would have to give you access to their account and all the chars on it, and nobody is going to give a total stranger access to their account, whether they play or not.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	wow. this question reeks of illegalness.    a) private servers are illegal    b)buying/selling/trading of characters is illegal.  and you wouldnt even be able to transfer the char to your account because they have to have the same name on them, along with a bunch of other fun stuff.  and THEN even if they had the same name, you would have to pay to transfer it to the private server, IF it would even let you. cause if blizz finds out its going to anything that resembles a private server, bam, banned!    c) even if it wasnt illegal, why on gods green earth would someone just GIVE you a level 70 to use?     cause seriously, if you cant even play a video game for yourself, then whats the point?
sJHOcmTeaa	Webkinz is a plush animal that you can play online and do fun stuff they say and do all these games and meet other kids with there animal plus you can dress up your little plush animal and in real life you can to and there are diffrences to like one is a regular webkin while the other is a baby one which on this u can not have babys or anything pretty much i would not reccomend this game thing its very boring|`|ZE84xfruaa	It is a stuff animal that you can play with online.
