20090220134315AAm1mrr	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Never argue with a woman?	Never Argue with a Woman      One morning the husband returns after several hours of  fishing and decides to take a nap. Although not familiar   with the lake, the wife decides to take the boat out. She  motors out a short distance, anchors, and reads her book.   Along comes a Game Warden in his boat. He pulls up alongside the woman and says, 'Good morning, Ma'am.   What are you doing?'  'Reading a book,' she replies.  'You're in a Restricted Fishing Area,' he informs her.   'I'm sorry, officer, but I'm not fishing. I'm reading.'  'Yes, but you have all the equipment. For all I know   you could start at any moment. I'll have to take you in > and write you up.'  'For reading a book?' she replies.   'You're in a Restricted Fishing Area,' he  informs her again.  'If you do that, I'll have to charge you with Sexual assault,' says the woman. 'But I haven't even touched you,' says the game warden. 'That's true, but you have all the equipment.   For all I know you could start at any moment.'  'Have a nice day ma'am,' and he left.   MORAL : Never argue with a woman who reads. It's likely she can also think.   Send this to four women who are  thinkers. If you receive this, you know you're  intelligent.

Inside I was dying to give it a try and you begged me so I stayed.  I knew you were different from the way I caved.      2. I don't wanna fall asleep, 'cause I don't know if I'll get up.  I don't wanna cause a scene, but I'm dying without your love.      3. They don't see, you're right where I want you and I think you could be, something that's more than expected.      4. It's something unpredictable, but in the end is right.  I hope you had the time of your life.      5. Say you're sorry, that face of an angel comes out just when you need it to.      6. Why can't I, get through the night, without another fight. I'm tired of the hurting, is it really worth it?      7. I woke up this morning and played our song, then through my tears I sang along      8. I'm walking around and I don't hear a sound, except for the memory of a love that I found.      9. Separate from the world, the constant battle that you hate to fight just blame the limelight.      10. All the colors start to blend.  Your system overloads again.         Hints:    - 3 of them aren't from Disney (1 is completely unrelated to Disney completely)   - 2 artists are used twice

20090220135641AAogR4n	Entertainment & Music;Music;Jazz	Help with Jazz piano auditions?	On Tuesday I will be auditioning for my High school Jazz band. The music director asked me to play piano for the band next year because the current pianist will be graduating at the end of this year. I have never played Jazz before, I've been strictly classical. I'm  late intermediate to early advanced in classical music, I can play  things like Chopin prelude number 4, 15, 20, etc. moonlight sonata, Mendelssohn's gondola songs, and the Rachmaninoff prelude in C.      I am currently working on the scales for jazz piano. I need to audition with F major Blues and B flat major Blues along with a selection from a piece and improvisation in B flat major.      I'm fine with the first two, scales are no problem and the piece is easy. Improvisation is a problem. I have never done any sort of improv before, let alone in a certain key. I'm not very familiar with keys and stuff like that, I just have always played to play.       Any pointers and tips or links to tutorial websites would be so helpful! I'll be practicing on my keyboard unfortunately for the next week, as my piano is being repaired. Figures. :)      Thanks very much!

20090220135532AAKyfbM	Entertainment & Music;Television;Reality Television	Why not more honest "reality shows"? 1/2 the guys on the dating shows have seemed gay to me, why pretend not?	Who devises those shows, anyway?   From the shows that I have seen:   Most of the women seem either loose, desperate, or like gold diggers, & most of the men seem like they're gay, and on the shows to convince people (perhaps themselves, more than anyone else), that they're not. 'Some of the guys shows have been built around, as well.      Do you get the same impressions, when you see them?   What's up with that?      When when they focus the shows on women, they seem to recruit some of the creepiest and/or most violent characters they can find as potential suitors. ...Causing me to wonder: Do they want us to enjoy the shows, or worry about what happens, when they end?      Get a chuckle out of this, and, share your thoughts.      Oh, and to be clear, I'm cool with gay people. I wonder if these shows thinks it's better to make a show where someone seems to be pretending to be someone they're not, for acceptance, and risks emotionally hurting someone who may genuinely grow to care about them, or could it be better, in advancing the process of acceptance of alternative lifestyles, to just have a show where guys date other guys?

Otto's school bus has to break down eventually, after taking Bart, Lisa, and the other kids to school for 20 years; since 1989, Chief Wiggum's police car must get worn from occasionally chasing that ex-con with the Californian accent; Snake, around town all the time and the tires must get worn out, and surely Marge's fairly new SUV, the Canyonaro must have needed an oil change by now, and with the way Homer Simpson drives since he front fender is always bent and he even once crashed into a chestnut tree; surely that must need some serious car maintence by now, and even the super safe driver Ned Flanders must have gotten a problem with the transmission by now after 20 years.      So what's the deal?   Where's the mechanic to fix their cars?   Or does Mr. Burns always have men to fix their cars between episodes, which would explain why Mr. Burns acts so stingy, because he's always paying for their car repairs with hired help?

She is the most beautiful woman in the world, and Macaulay Culkin is nothing really.      I think shes a really sweet person, extremely genuine, very modest and humble. She doesnt think too highly of herself, like many Hollywood actresses do.       But i think there may be a specific reason why she''s going out with him. And that is, POT.      They're pot buddies. They smoke it together, and the green is such an amazing thing. Pot buddies are the closest buddies ever! i used to have that with a girl, and we were great! Pot makes everyone so humble and cheery, it gives even a loser like Culkin the chance to date a beauty like Kunis.       God bless the green!

Also, does anyone know anything about the NEW edition of the manga, like the second printing or something, where it's called Bishoujo Senshi (sp?)

If anyone has read the manga, and watched the naruto shippuuden series, you'll be able to answer, or at least comment, on my freaking question...   Ever since Sasuke has come back into naruto shippuden, they've been cutting out his friggin scenes      which (in the manga) are, by far, way better then these crappy fillers they're subbing him for,..this whole Guren garbage that is soo boring.      They keep on prolonging the story to the point where everyone is sick of waiting for some good action to happen, or for sasuke's whole "gather a group to better enhance my chances of killing itachi" type thing...and for his debut, that's not really his debut anymore, cuz they killed it...again...      So back to my question, i'm wondering why they keep on cutting out all the good scenes, do you think they're going to add them in?   where do you think the story's gonna roll in with the whole itachi thing, cuz if they keep procrastinating, this is gonna be one hell of a long show...

And she uses her great allure to move through life. The Libra lesbian is intelligent, attractive, and quite the people pleaser. Is it any surprise then that she is rarely at a loss for a lover? Ms. Libra is ruled by Venus, the planet of love, art, and beauty. No one has a better aesthetic sense than this woman. She can tell the difference between a real Matisse and a forgery just as easily as she can differentiate between a quality pair of leather pumps and a cheap imitation. If she is lucky and knows herself well, she is already working in a field or living a life where she is surrounded by art and beauty. She likes the good things in life and will probably find a way to make sure you give them to her. And you will be happy to, because you won't be able to stand seeing this woman settle for less than the best. So, clearly this woman has her decadent, pleasure-loving side.

20090220150357AA1mQso	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Noise Song For Friday #94 (You Must See This/Feat. John Lennon & Yoko Ono)?	This is perhaps my noisiest post yet. Could you even call it a song? Of course, it is the first side of John Lennon & Yoko Ono's infamous "Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins". You all most likely know of this or at least the controversial cover, but have you heard the music? It starts innocently enough: whistling and the sound of getting comfortable. But, twenty seconds in, you have been thrust into this onslaught of noise, like a bird singing during a hurricane. This goes on for a while, maybe to the annoyance of some. Random sounds trail: taps, hits, pots and pans? Still a whistle. Then we hear a piano...an encouraging sign of melody and normality? Not even close. What follows are some of the strangest sounds I have ever heard in my life. Yoko's wailing ensues. Slide up. Slide down. Wail. Scream. Howl. Sing? Their assurance of love for each other? Lennon, who has been cast in the shadow somewhat as Yoko is in the spotlight, yells as well. Yells at the top of his lungs. And rapes a poor, poor piano who surely did not give consent for this abuse. Seemingly obscure phrases meld into the chaos and madness. And that's just part one.       http://www.imeem.com/people/_Z0toUe/musi...        http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_Y_5aBLo...       So...?
20090220145840AAE4pU9	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Metallica Fans...... What Album showcased James' best riffs?	I am curious as to which Album you thought James was at the top of his game.      Don't really care what you think about him personally, if they sold out, etc.  Just the Riffs.      And if you could explain why, that would be great.      BQ- What Song do you think is the prime example of it?   BQ2- Which Album showcased his best Vocals?      My Choices:    Album: Black (I surprised myself on this one, but I find it has the most distinctive and memorable of his riffs, even if they are not his most complex.  Step away from your biases and think about it, if you can.  Honestly..which album can most people envison the riffs immediately in their head more easily ?)      BQ- Too many examples to choose.   BQ2- Tie between Black and Ride the Lightning.  Both of those albums truly showed him at his most diverse, IMO.      *Oh, and trolls and idiots? Please feel free to answer too. It makes figuring out who I need to block much easier.

And if you could explain why, that would be great.      BQ-  What Song do you think is the prime example of it?      My Choices:    Album: And Justice for All.     Track: Eye of the Beholder.      *Oh, and trolls and idiots?  Please feel free to answer too.  It makes figuring out who I need to block much easier.

Hello R&P, Friday is FINALLY here lol! I'm exhausted after a week's worth of drama, tests, and homework at school. How are all of you? Any plans for the weekend? :D      Giant Space Platypus asked me to feature this awesome band, with Kim Deal of The Pixies as lead singer: The Breeders. Check it out! :)      'Safari'    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd7ILa_mh...       'Iris'    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6N1UCzv1...       What do you guys think of the band and the songs?      BQ: Favorite Pixies song   BQ2: Favorite song from The Breeders (if you're not familar with them and have only heard them for the first time with the links I provided, pick which song is your favorite of the two)      Oh, and today is none other than Kurt Cobain's birthday (lol The Breeders had Kim from The Pixies in it, and The Pixies were one of his favorite bands. lol). If he was still alive today, he would've turned 42 years old. So in honor of his birthday, R&P, can you dedicate a song to him? Thanks. No hate comments towards him please.      BQ3: Do you think the R&P Pact changed R&P in the slightest bit? The question got deleted last Sunday. Should I reask for the people who weren't able to 'sign'? I'm not looking for critcism towards the 'pact' so save it.      Have a kickass weekend, R&P! :D

Hit Em up was Pac dissing Biggie, Ether was Nas dissing Jay, Officer Ricky was 50 dissing Ross (I know you might think I'm crazy, but that track went hard), Go to Sleep was Em, Obie, and DMX dissing Ja Rule, and Gossip was Wayne dissing 50 (once again, you might think bad of Wayne, but that track went hard) I personally liked Hit Em Up, so that's my favorite. Ether comes close, but here's why. Ether was funny and took serious shots at Jay, but Hit Em Up just striaght up hurt. 2pac was really pissed off and went places most rappers would never go in their diss songs.

We are allowed to choose any topic as long as it has to do with France or French related. So I decided to do my project on Gojira, but then I realised it would be hard to base a 30 minute presentation on one metal band. So I will still be talking about Gojira, only my topic will be the French metal scene in general. And yes, that does include French speaking countries or provinces such as Quebec. So I was wondering if anyone had any info on French metal, or if someone could point me in some direction. Gojira has an interview about the French metal scene, but it's under a minute so I need more.

20090220150607AAPq5m8	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	Does anyone know the title of a certain "Law & Order" episode?	I need to know the title of an episode of Law & Order in which a little boy is killed by a friend, after which event the father (who is a psychologist or psychiatrist) tries to help the child even though he knows the boy has murdered his son. The father tries to reason that the child has a psychological problem. However, late in the episode the father discovers that the child expresses no remorse for what he did whatsoever. So in a dramatic turn of events, the father grabs a gun from the bailiff in the court and shoots the child. The father is then put on trial, but, because he is a psychologist, he knows what to say so as to make the jury rule that he is not guilty on account of a mental blackout.   I absolutely love this episode, but I have not seen it in two years and I wanted to view it with a few of my classmates from my American Government and Sociology classes. If anyone could help, I would greatly appreciate it.

I have, and it's the most retarded thing i've witnessed. This boy in my class does it everyday, and i'm like, "you know you look really gay right now" but he doesn't care. The dance is not fresh and original, the beat sounds very cheap, and the video is more broke down looking than "So cold in the D". I'm a huge rap/hip hop fan, but no wonder people don't take mainstream hip hop seriously. Honestly, it's a shame that this hits airwaves faster than something by Nas or Lupe.

20090220153358AACRmni	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Metallica Fans...... What Album showcased Kirk's best Leads?	I am curious as to which Album you thought Kirk was at the top of his game.      Don't really care what you think about him personally, if they sold out, he loves his Wah to much,Dave was better (which as a Lead Guitarist he actually was NOT) etc. Just the Leads.      And if you could explain why, that would be great.      BQ- What Song do you think is the prime example of it?   BQ2- Best Solo?      My Choices:    Album: tie between Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets.  Really hard to call.      BQ- Fade to Black   BQ2- Master of Puppets         *Oh, and trolls and idiots? Please feel free to answer too. It makes figuring out who I need to block much easier.

We are not going to break up soon, so I don't want angry or sad songs, but the happy love songs kill me because it's not what I am experiencing right now.  Lately about the only song I can listen to is "One step at a time" by Jordin Sparks, because it gives me hope, and helps me remember that "it's gonna happen if it's supposed to happen, and we find the reasons why one step at a time"  Do you know any other good songs for being strong and optimistic?!

20090220155030AAYSuK6	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	This ones for any metal heads?	Why is it that a lot of Metal bands that are really big, don't seem to have that much income? I was watching some documentary's on metal bands like Lamb of god, Job for a cowboy, and Suicide silence. And it was showing all the struggles they had to go through, like riding a bike to practice, or renting out a run down shed to practice in, or some of the members in interviews talking about how theyl never be rich.  Of coerce money isn't everything, and the best part about being in a band is playing the music you love and love doing it, but i was curious about why it takes metal bands so much longer to really take off compared to main stream artists?

If someone could suggest some bands that I should listen to that have rock-solid, thought-provoking, metaphorical lyrics that are accompanied by music that is fresh-without-being-tiresome, I would love to hear about them.      Please don't just post your favourite bands; I'm not going to appreciate the music unless the songs they sing mean something to me. Additionally, I don't care how popular or obscure they are... all I want is for someone with more musical culture to give me some suggestions.      Generally speaking, lyrics about someone pining over another or being angry at the world don't interest me. If it's mainstream thought, I've probably heard too much of it already. I want to appreciate new music *and* new ideas. Suggestions, anyone?

To understand why this is my favorite, you'd have to have it playing over and over again while you were driving through the Rocky Mountains in the summer, with a gameboy color and a stack of Harry Potter and Goosebumps books.      The guitar solos are fantastic without being overdone, the acoustic opening is beautiful, and it reminds me of the British Columbian countryside viewed from the back of a cramped-up minivan.       So, R&P, what's yours?

I started out mocking creationists and other theists in R&S, then the election season came along and I went over to insult Republicans and conservatives in the Politics section, then i was on singles and dating almost exclusively for about a month, then I got bored with that, discovered P&S, THEN i discovered you can just keep clicking the big white "answer" button instead of looking at the individual categories which helped me spread my answers out over all categories, so now i'm kind of balancing between all categories with emphasis on all the aforementioned ones plus diet and fitness.      How has your answering changed over time?

20090220133509AAD99pK	Entertainment & Music;Movies	On Die Hard 2 why did Holly taze Thornburg?	On Die Hard 2 why on earth did Holly have to taze Thornburg for? He'd never even gotten back at her after she punched him at the end of the first Die Hard movie (he did deserve getting punched by Holly at the end of the first Die Hard movie) yet she still had to taze him at the end of Die Hard 2?      Is it just me or was Holly holding some kind of grudge against Thornburg.      Plus I believe Die Hard 2 is sending the wrong message cause Holly tazing Thornburg is making people think it's okay to hurt those who you despise.      I personally had no respect for Holly in Die Hard 2.      How did you feel about Holly tazing Thornburg at the end of Die Hard 2.

20090220134937AAmh9WV	Entertainment & Music;Movies	How many people are going to watch Transformers 2 when it comes out this summer?	I heard the Dinobots are going to be in this one. I'm excited and can't wait til the summer so I can see it. My favorite Dinobot is Swoope. I remember when they had a Transformers episode it had only him and Shockwave throughout the whole episode. Swoope was with the human being teenage kid, they were trapped inside some building and they were trying to get out. It was an old 1980's episode, anyway Swoope is my favorite Autobot which was a Dinobot. If you don't remember who swoope was he was the Pterydactyl of the Dinosaurs(Dinobots). I like him because when the Dinobots come stomping through like a stampede with Grimlock, Snarl, Sludge, and Swoope. Swoope would fly through the air and drop air to ground missles on that...You know what! LOL My favorite decepticon was Starscream. I liked Sixshot too. Sixshot was a transformer that could turn into six different things and he was considered a 1 man Army. He could wipeout a bunch of Autobots all by himself. He was bad a$$! LOL I had him as a kid. Anyway, I drifted into childhood too much. Anyway, who wants to see the Transformers? I hear Swoope and the rest of the Dinobots are in this one. Maybe even Omega Supreme and Devastator if we're lucky. Transformers more than meets the eye! Peace!

She really likes him a lot and they were talking about first kisses and she was like "Mine sucked." and he said that he'll give her a kiss the next time he saw her.

"You can be my hoe." and they haven't seen each other in a long time. She's really scared. But she wants to go to the mall and it'll be with his friend and her friend. So it'll be them and two other people.       How can I help her out? She's afraid he'll try something and she was shaking she's so freaked out...

20090220134002AAjQR70	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you think that I have a chance?	Well, for the past 2 years there's been this girl who gets MVP in basketball and volleyball! And I'm trying to change that! So this year I've really stepped up my game, and I found out that I'm a defence player! And not just any Defeence player, the best on the team! And I'm not bragging or thinking that highly of myself, it's just that whenever I'm out on that courtit seams that the other team doesn't make as many points, but when I'm on the bench they sort of make alot of points! And I'm fast, I'm not tall( one of my flaws) but I am really fast! When somebodys making a fast break and I'm all the way on the other side of the gym, I get there in time to stop them from making that basket. I'll admit I'm not that great on offence, but I do make at least 4 points every game! And I steal the ball ALOT and in one game, half of our points were made because I stole the ball and got it to the person who shot it in!   And besides my defence skill after every game I ALWAYS ask my coach "What can I do to make me a better player?" Or something to that extent like "Did you see anything tonight that you think I need to work on?" Also, I usually help bring the basketballs down from his room, and collect the pennys and put the basketballs back in the bag!   Whereas the other girl who gets MVP thinks she's the star! I'll admit she's good, but her big head gets in the way(too much to go into now)! She never pays attention in practice like she's too good for practice and doesn't need it. And whenever she or her sister get taken out they literally scream at the 5 other players out there to stop making stupid mistakes! And they also ask the coach to be put back in the game, more like demand him to!   So I was just wondering basedon all that information do you think that I could actually be MVP this year?   Oh, and me and the other girl are in the 8th grade!

20090220145930AAL1D67	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you take risks......?	To laugh is to risk appearing the fool.    To weep is to risk appearing sentimental.    To reach out to others is to risk involvement.    To expose feelings is to risk exposing your true self.    To place your ideas, your dreams before a crowd is to risk their loss.    To love is to risk not being loved in return.    To live is to risk dying.    To hope is to risk despair.    To try is to risk failure.       But risks must be taken,    because the greatest hazard in life is to do nothing.       The person who risks nothing,    does nothing, has nothing, and is nothing.       They may avoid suffering and sorrow,    but they cannot learn, feel, change, grow, love, live.       Chained by their attitudes, they are a slave,    they forfeited their freedom.       Only the person who risks can be free            Suggested Category, Pregnancy and Parenting... lol, that's about right

20090220153450AAZnufc	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Blonde Joke! (I thought it was funny!)?	I found this somewhere.      A blonde, wanting to earn some money, decided to hire herself out as a handyman-type and started canvassing a wealthy neighborhood.   She went to the front door of the first house and asked the owner if he had any jobs for her to do.      "Well, you can paint my porch. How much will you charge?"      The blonde said, "How about 50 dollars?"   The man agreed and told her that the paint and ladders that she might need were in the garage.   The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her husband, "Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the house?"      The man replied, "She should. She was standing on the porch."      A short time later, the blonde came to the door to collect her money.      "You're finished already?" he asked.   "Yes," the blonde answered, "and I had paint left over, so I gave it two coats.   "Impressed, the man reached in his pocket for the $50.      "And by the way," the blonde added, "that's not a Porch, it's a Ferrari."          Star if you like!
20090220152432AAx4aGy	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Haha I thought it was funny!?	A woman goes into Wal-Mart to buy a rod and reel.      She doesn't know which one to get so she just grabs one and goes over to the register.      There is a Wal-Mart "associate" standing there with dark shades on.      She says, "Excuse me sir...can you tell me anything about this rod and reel?"      He says, "Ma'am I'm blind but if you will drop it on the counter I can tell you everything you need to know about it from the sound that it makes."      She didn't believe him, but dropped it on the counter anyway.      He said, "That's a 6' graphite rod with a Zebco 202 reel and 10 lb. test line...It's a good all around rod and reel and it's $20.00".      She says, "That's amazing that you can tell all that just by the sound of it dropping on the counter. I think it's what I'm looking for so I'll take it."      He walks behind the counter to the register, and in the meantime the woman breaks wind big-time.      At first she is embarrassed but then realizes that there is no way he could tell it was her...being blind he wouldn't know that she was the only person around. He rings up the sale and says, "That will be $25.50."      She says, "But didn't you say it was $20.00?"      He says, "Yes ma'am, the rod and reel is $20.00, the duck call is $3.00, and the catfish stink bait is $2.00."          Star if you like!

Now after learning about "the kiss" shared between Rys & Zack, Bianca has filed for an annullment. So my question is, why would an annullment be necessary to end that "marriage" when it wasn't recognized in the first place? Maybe I'm missing something. Maybe the "marriage" took place elsewhere?

20090220152454AAIDaIz	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Can you help identify a cartoon TV show?	When I was younger there was a show I watched religiously but never knew what it was called. Now I'm hoping someone might help me identify what the show was.      The show starred a pudgy mustached man and an oddball creature. There were no speaking parts, but lots of grunts and laughs. In each episode, the man would have some task to do that day, and the creature would warn him not to do it. The man doesn't listen and tries to do it anyway, despite any resistance the creature puts up. Eventually the man performs his task, but something bad happens to him because of it. Both the creature and the man end up laughing at the show's end at the man's misfortune.       For example, in one episode the man tried to mow the grass on a peculiar hill. It turns out the hill is a giant bear. In another episode, the man tries to dig a tunnel through a mountain for a train. He ends up tunneling into a nearby bank and finding the money safe, irking the bank guards. In another episode, the man wants to fire an arrow into a bulls eye target. The target turns out to be a man bending over picking flowers.      If anyone can help me figure out what this cartoon might be, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

20090203063550AAB6Cxt	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	For the people in the US?	I am doing some research concerning the media and how it impacts people's lifestyles. I have looked at recent surveys on the Internet but nothing could suffice the hypothesis and the latest survey I viewed was 3-4 years old. I wanted to get a straight and first-hand points of view so I decided that it was best to ask at this site.       Below there are a few questions which I would like to be answered by the people in the US, a average of 4-6 questions will be asked.       1. Age Range: 16-20 20-24 24-28 28+ (please do not display names)   2.Do you watch TV often: Yes/No   3. How many hours on average do watch TV when you come home    from work:    30m-1hr 1hr-1:30 1:30-2hrs 2hrs-2:30 2:30+   4. Do you find ''edible'' foods advertised on TV:    Appealing Silly Tempting Other    5. Have you bought any thing advertised on TV (food and drinks in particular): Yes/No    6. Do you think that the media has an impact in what you eat:    Yes/No      Some questions have been omitted from the original questionnaire to protect private information being posted on the Internet.          Answers would be great.          (After enough data has been collected I will delete this question to protect your information)

20090220155634AAChNby	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Help: Flute Players.?	Flute is not my main instrument, although it used to be. I recently picked it back up for a flute choir we're doing for school. I'm working on tone exercises, and all that stuff.   Here's the problem.   I'm playing bass flute. I normally play bari sax, so I'm used to playing with a lot of air. But they're two completely different instruments.    I can get long tones out, but when it comes to playing the piece (which is relatively fast) I lose some support and its harder to go from high to low. I tend to fall to an overtone.      Any ideas or tips on what I can do to fix this?      Please give a thorough answer. (:   thanks.
