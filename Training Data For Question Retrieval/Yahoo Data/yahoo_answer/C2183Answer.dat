caOfuKl5aa	Right now, they haven't made any announcements that Sims 3 will come to consoles.  If it will, it will be a while, just like we had to wait a while to get the 1st Sims game on a console.  Sorry :-(|`|qtlzdtMVaa	Yes I think so. Since you can play online should think that they would bring out a game for the ps3, well I hope anyway, it'll be awesome =)

It's not exactly "legal" though. Maybe you can contact EA and tell them what happened. The number is also on the back of the CD case..I believe. Good luck!|`|d5foifOgaa	You can only use your serial number that you got on the game that you bought. if you want to play you have to either find the booklet or buy a new game. it sucks doesn't it! im sorry I could not give you some good news.

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi, here's some tips for fighting:<br>  <br>  1. Cavalry are usually a key ingredient in any defensive or offensive battle. You can use their speed to your advantage - often they should be commanded in flanking roles (attacking from the sides). Their experience, armour and effectiveness make them very flexible to fit any task you may have.<br>  <br>  2. Foot soldiers are the heart of your army, and more often than not, they will probably comprise the bulk of your forces. They are obviously suited to melee combat, and are slow moving - so they should aim to create buffers and press against the enemy front line.<br>  <br>  3. Archers and horse archers can be extremely influential in deciding a conflict. Striking with arrows from a distance is probably an intelligent approach - you can cut down the opposition's strong points before they have the time to fully utilise them. Keep your archers/crossbowmen at the rear, protected by a cavalry regiment.<br>  <br>  4. Typically, you should try to surround your foes in some way. If that proves unsuccessful, "divide and conquer". By separating the enemy into small, manageable groups you can quickly eliminate them. When you're outnumbered, you need to react with haste - but don't panic. Deal with one army and focus on defeating them before turning your attention elsewhere. <br>  <br>  5. Your General is the greatest morale booster in a battle. If he dies, much of the contigent will fall into disarray. When this happens, they don't concentrate and begin to become fearful. That is the last thing you need. Instead, inflict the first blow by targeting the opposing General. <br>  <br>  6. Remember these simple facts: Spear formations are fantastic against horses. Cavalry are phenomenal against almost any infantry/ archers. Archers can cause a lot of havoc if they're positioned correctly and are vast in numbers. Siege weapons like the ballista, trebuchet and catapult can knock down castle/settlement walls efficiently. They are also DEADLY in the field of war.
PQy6if0Waa	Once you pick a bobblehead up, it's stat increase is with you permanently, even if you drop the bobblehead and lose it.<br>  <br>  I think you can have both, just good/evil characters will drop their respected item. (finger/ear) Kind of waste of perks if you ask me, don't get any of those two.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	Once you have found the bobble head your stat remains. The stand is just a nice way of showing them off in your house.<br>  <br>  As for the two perks I don't know. Can you even have both or does the option for the other disappear once you have picked one. Maybe you are only offered one depending on your Karma? I don't know, I have only been good so far.|`|I4V4q2FEaa	lol i only have the knowledge to answer your first question. and the answer is no. once you pick up the bobblehead, the stat stays with you forever. And hey if i may make a recommendation, go buy (or rent) The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion if you like this game. Oblivion is SO much better then fallout. I loved them both but Oblivion a little more =) happy gaming!|`|OYHEhFDPaa	if you place the bobbleheads on the cabinet you do not lose your stats but if you were to place them anywhere else you would, you can only choose one of the lawbreaker/ hitman perk.

C7mD5Y3Waa	The graphics looks good on this game. You cannot compare this to PS3 or 360 graphics. The Wii has weaker hardware, so it has graphics of last-gen.

SEwqwjPkaa	I'm guessing by COD5 you mean World At War...right? I'll answer accordingly. I play W@W every day and have managed to work my way up quite quickly. The game-play is essentially the same as COD4 in that most everyone playing W@W got their feet wet in COD4. So, that said, here's some tips I use when playing...<br>  <br>  1. Don't be a runner gunner. It's important to make use of cover when moving around the maps. The larger maps aren't such a hassle but on smaller maps, every move you make can either be heard, or seen by the enemy. I often crouch when moving around the inside of structures, especially ones with wooden flooring. The less sound you make, the better chance you'll have of surviving. Don't run around corners blindly unless you know whether or not there's any enemy there. Go prone when possible as this lowers your profile and when using add-ons like muzzle flash hiders and such, you're virtually invisible. If you're making use of bouncing betties, you're probably not moving around much. If this is the case, you still need to watch your cover. Crouch behind windows and keep your ears open for enemies approaching your position.<br>  <br>  2. I see many players "shoot" enemies when they're only feet away from them. They'll empty an entire clip in a guy and then have to reload to get another shot off. This is stupid. If you're within a short sprint of an enemy, melee his *** with the knife or bayonette. It's the only way to go and 7 times out of 8, he'll never see it coming. Easy one shot kills.<br>  <br>  3. When calling in recon and artillery, hold off on calling in dogs until after your artillery shells have dropped completely. Often, you can save your dog call until you die, then when you respawn, call in the dogs and you'll probably rack up another 7 kills quite quickly. Then, call in another set of dogs, and so on. I often get 40+ kills by doing this on the larger maps.<br>  <br>  4. Use the buddy system. Don't run off by yourself if you don't have to. If there's a buddy close by, use the follow and cover rule. Follow him while covering his back, then switch and let him follow you. If someone's watching your back, you have much better luck concentraing on the guys trying to pick you off from the front.<br>  <br>  5. KNOW YOUR MAPS! This is a big one. The better you know your way around the maps, the bigger the advantage you'll have over the enemies. Many players take the same routes on certain maps repeatedly. For example, on Airfield, everyone goes for the upstairs of the bldg used in the zombie mission...forgot the name of the bldg. It's easy to get 4 or 5 kills by simply watching the upstairs level and waiting for the idiots to pop their head's up. There are obviously other spots on other maps where one could get easy kills but if you know your maps, you'll find these spots and you'll rule the game.<br>  <br>  I have lots more tips but in the end, you'll probably want to Google some more. Youtube is a great source too...I like to watch the more experienced players to see what tatics work for them.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  Peace!<br>  The Reverend|`|vrBVvAQmaa	Boosting, you play domination but only capture the flag and don't kill each other, this way you get a massive points bonus at the end, but the downsides are it can take a while get into a game, and you need a reliable clan to play with which wont start killing each other.

RngUbYHfaa	You can retrieve videos from your xbox, but you would have to connect the 360's video out to a PC video recorder (Like Pinacle's Dazzle) and record it like that.  <br>  <br>  To answer you question succinctly, no.  You really can't just grab the files and tranfer them.
837xgMwLaa	I think ebay will be the only place, short of visiting 2nd hand shops. I don't think there was ever a console that would play both, but I do remember something called a "tristar" that lets you play NES on SNES, I think it was unofficial though, I just did an ebay search & came up with nothing. The easiest way to play the classics is with an emulator using a PC, although there are emulators for PSP, PS2, Dreamcast & even Wii that allow you to play NES & SNES games (roms).

ye9h5jXvaa	Oh dear.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to be mean, but none of that means anything. Being good at Cruel Brawl just means you're good at Cruel Brawl. That's it. There are Cruel Brawl KO world records in the hundreds, by the way, so 20 doesn't look all that special in comparison. Getting the trophies isn't particularly difficult. For instance, I don't consider myself a fantastic Smash Bros player but basically the only trophies I'm missing are the SSE ones because I can't be bothered to collect them all. Getting only half of the trophies doesn't take much effort.<br>  <br>  Beating your friends doesn't mean much, either. Have you ever been to a tournament? If you want to find out how good you actually are, enter a tournament. It's the only way. Otherwise you can make all the claims you like but no one - including you - will ever know how good you really are. Until then, stop bragging and maybe think about playing the game for fun, instead of as a way to stroke your ego.<br>  <br>  I hope you don't get offended by this, but it needed to be said.|`|smRqrUoFaa	4 brawler trophies from tourments at gamestop<br>  ur friends maybe sucks im online hole  new game plya<br>  killed 25 with kirby on cruel brawl (that easy and his not even my main)<br>  1000 trophies i have about 798 of them and there not the same thing <br>  i dont have to be the best i am the best <br>  if u think ur come online and shut the hE33 up and  fight|`|vUvxicTKaa	IM AWSOME WITH KIRBY BUT I CHEAT WITH HIM SO IM A LOSER SO SORRY ITS FUNNY|`|uMe5NfPSaa	i'm better i have had every trophy since i started playing and every character since an hour after i started.|`|AUCcZ8lQaa	You deserve a cookie.

UQKQiv7Xaa	As your two characters' levels get closer to each other, their exp will also decrease if they aren't both fighting (if one is healing). This is why most people try to find people which are as low level as possible (max 19 level difference) in order to get the best exp, or if they don't need a healer, they find someone of the same level to fight with.<br>  Also, of course, as your level gets higher it gets harder to level, so the exp will decrease in that aspect as well.<br>  <br>  The healer/low level character partnered with the high level will always get a lot more exp (especially if partner is aoe, as it is more kills), but I don't know exactly how much it is in comparison. Healers usually look for partners that are at least 10 levels higher than them.<br>  <br>  People buy adv parties because of laziness. It is easier to buy one than to create, fill and get to level 10 yourself.

SdHqyWKHaa	Take a wire coathanger and, using just your hands, pull and bend it into a circle instead of a triangle, leaving the hook at the top for hanging it up with. (You can also start with an old embroidery hoop, if you have one around.) Now you can either leave the metal as-is or wrap it with string or yarn or strips of fabric (you can even cut up some old clothes for the fabric) to cover it. Then, start weaving more yarn or fabric strips across the opening, tying the pieces to each other or to the hoop as desired. You can tie in feathers, bells, small mirrors, beads, or anything else you enjoy.

jjDZJmfpaa	You are not going to like what I am about to write to you.<br>  <br>  The easiest way to put in a zipper in any garment is to do it before you sew the garment especially if the garment is going to have a lining.<br>  <br>  The lining to the dress should not have been attached unless the sleeves were already made for the dress and the sleeves were already in for the lining. From what you described you made it hard for yourself.<br>  <br>  This is what all good seamstresses have to do at one point or another, take it unloose. <br>  <br>  If the zipper is in the back, put those two pieces together and pin the zipper in so it is enclosed. The best way to do this is baste the seam closed, pin the zipper in the opened basted seam and sew the selvage down with the zipper. After wards, pull the basting thread out and press the zipper flat.<br>  <br>  Now put the rest of the dress together and do the same with the lining leaving the opening where the zipper would go in the lining open.<br>  <br>  Now turn the dress inside out and have the right sides of the lining facing you. Match the notches of the dress and the lining. Sew together leaving the neck, zipper, hem, and sleeve openings open.<br>  <br>  When finished, pull the dress through the neck opening and adjust the lining in place. Hand stitch the neck, hem, zipper, and sleeve opening to the lining.|`|y02PZj22aa	The lining is actually a *mirror image* of the dress.  When you put the lining in, you would put the two right sides together, sew together at the neckline,  and turn the resulting lined dress inside out so that the wrong sides are together.  Press the lining into place and stitch the neckline seam "in the ditch" to reinforce the seam and turn the seam to the lining side. You would then hand-sew the lining to the dress at the armscye.  Hem both.  You may also want to hand stitch the lining to the dress at the waistline.  If there is a waistline seam, that would be the place to *loosely* stitch them together; otherwise, use the front and back waistline darts.<br>  <br>  The zipper should be inserted during the construction of the dress.  When the lining is added, you could attach the lining to the zipper, if the dress is fitted, or just leave an opening in the lining (where you turn the seam allowance under and stitch) if the dress is not fitted.  Or, if it's partially fitted such as you'd have with an empire waistline, stitch the lining to the dress at the fitted part and leave it loose at the unfitted part.|`|PmsA0Zfcaa	Not knowing the design of the dress or the sleeve in question, I cannot help you there. But in answer to the zipper question, my experience has been that the zipper is first placed in the dress itself before the lining is put in place. After the lining is inserted and anchored to the dress,  the lining opening around the zipper is folded in and hand stitched along the ribbon of the zipper, thus enclosing the zipper. <br>       Best of luck with your project!|`|KSjmhXdcaa	First of all, I don't believe you are lining the sleeve, right?  So I would attach the lining to the sleeve/dress seam where they are sewn together on the dress (armhole seam).  I believe you would put the zipper in first and then hand sew the lining around it.  I hope this helps!|`|PSPcvN6paa	I can't answer your question very well I'm afraid, as I stick to sewing soft toys, not clothing. But if you ask the ladies over at craftster.org, they should be able to help you, or find you a tutorial.

AA10950966	Yes there is<br>  <br>  The revamped version -- dubbed the "DSi" -- is slightly thinner and has larger screens than the original DS, but its most noticeable change is Nintendo's addition of two cameras: one inside, pointing towards the player, and one outside, positioned rather like a cellphone camera. Inside the case, the console's hardware is upgraded with faster processors and extra memory. It'll also accept a SD memory card for saving pictures or storing music.<br>  <br>  Along with upgraded networking features like better wireless support and a free web browser, the DSi will also be able to go online to a Nintendo store similar to the Wii's Shop Channel. Gamers will be able to use it to purchase games for download to the DSi's internal memory -- much like the bigger consoles can already do, in fact.<br>  <br>  Releasing on April 5 for $170, the new DS will be $40 more expensive than the current DS model, but still matches or beats both its competitors, the Sony PSP, which is also $170, and the iPod Touch, which starts at $230. Regular games for the DSi will still cost around $30; a bit cheaper than most PSP titles, but considerably more expensive than iPod Touch games which, while typically much simpler, seldom venture above the $10 mark.<br>  <br>  Chinatown Wars Screenshots<br>  <br>  So price aside, how does the software selection up? The DSi will be able to play all past DS game, but unlike earlier DS models, it won't be able to play older Game Boy Advance titles. Future games will likely take advantage of the machine's camera, but there's nothing on the market just yet that supports it. The DS has a considerably broader (and arguably better) selection of games than either the PSP or the iPod Touch, and thanks to its enormous install base, its future as a viable gaming platform is unchallenged.<br>  <br>  But will the DSi's media-friendly upgrades make it a legit challenger the PSP or iPod Touch's more advanced capabilities? Don't hold your breath. Either of those machines is still going to be a better bet if you want a one-gadget-fits-all machine that'll let you play music, watch movies, and browse the Internet.<br>  <br>  However, the games-first focus of the DS line has only benefited it. Already home to massive-selling, unique franchises like Brain Age, Pokemon, and Nintendogs, the next few months hold yet more promising releases like Rockstar's all-new Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars. And we're really curious to find out what Nintendo, ever ready to come up with inventive control systems, can do with that camera. If you want in on the action, you're going to need one.|`|RbKZoDUNaa	Yes. It's true. <br>  I dont know much about it, but I read that it would be coming soon in Game Informer magazine yesterday.|`|53nepzDdaa	yeah i heard about it on a website it says it is only a myth but it might just happen. its gunna have a camera for online IM chats n stuff|`|4FvK8XaJaa	Yes, there is a Nintendo DSi.

IxoBFCpTaa	? Online from jamglue but it will cost money
J1elZSMUaa	Oh this is easy. After the second title update I found out how to do this within a week. All you do is get a boltok pistol. Then stand on top of the sheild. Shoot the boltok pistol once and then press X to pick up the sheild and whichever direction on the D pad for what weapon you want at the same time. Plz use this for private games only and not online ranked. It makes the game less fun for everyone else. Thx

8hbm4uiPaa	I'm sorry, it's not very good, at least not in a competitive format. (It's fine for casual play if that is your intent.)<br>  <br>  First, Rupture Spire is inferior to Reflecting Pool, which you should be playing four copies of if you really want to optimize your deck.<br>  <br>  Path to Exile is a format changing card and if you have a way of playing it, you should play four copies or none at all.<br>  <br>  Master of Etherium is another card you either play four copies of or you don't play at all because it either has synergy with your deck or it does not. It obviously does for you, so you should play four copies.<br>  <br>  You should also be playing Etherium Sculpter. It makes all of your spells cheaper, which is really important to Esper decks.<br>  <br>  Tidehollow Strix is pretty good in limited formats, but it's not really that good in constructed, so you should probably cut it. Instead, you should play Bitterblossom. I understand your deck doesn't have a fairy theme and Bitterblossom is not an artifact, but its just THAT good.<br>  <br>  Much like Path of Exile, if you can support Bitterblossom you play it, because it wins games.<br>  <br>  Executioner's Capsule isn't very good. Too many black creatures and multicolor creatures with black in them that will make the capsule a dead card. Instead, you should be playing Courier's Capsule for card the card advantage.<br>  <br>  Agony Warp should be four copies. Countersqual should probably be four copies. Esper Charm isn't as good as the cards it competes with and should probably be cut, even though your deck has an Esper theme.<br>  <br>  Not sure if I would run Cancel. Most of the time you will be playing cards on your turn and won't have three open mana to bother counterspelling your opponents threats.<br>  <br>  I'd cut Jace. He's really not good unless you are planning to mill your opponent. Otherwise, he's a draw one card for three mana, and then he dies to something. Many other draw spells are more efficient.
8f892b4972d7cb015a31e859e2be573caa	I had to do one with 25 straws and 100 metal straight pins! This is EASY if you ask me!!!<br>  <br>  Make a cradle, by creating a cube of cut straws and placing the egg inside. If possible, tape the bottom so the egg doesn't fall through. Next, build support. You need legs and straws taped across the legs to support them. There should be some fallback but not to the point where the egg hits the ground and breaks. <br>  <br>  With any remaining materials, reinforce the sides and ensure that the legs are not going to bend or cause the egg to break. Test your project and make adjustments as necessary.|`|OefuFAAnaa	funny i did the same thing, our teem didnt win but heres wat u got to do you should wrap  the straws around the egg and then strap tape around it! thats what the wining teem did :) good luck! hope u win! and if you have scissors you should cut little pieces of straw and the tape each one about 1\2 an inch apart taped around the egg and with the xtra tape rap it around the egg! good luck again! ;D i know its confusing but if u got 40 straws then put the little pieces around the egg like together, no 1\2 inch k? vertically too and the rap the tape round it

pNpcSmLvaa	Here is a good game that everyone loves and it is funny : ) <br>  <br>  Put a bunch of clothing items in a suitcase - Underwear, Skirts, Boxers, Bras, Tops, Hats etc. <br>  <br>  And then play some music and let them get in a circle and pass the suitcase around like hot potatoe. When the music stops, who ever it lands on opens it up and takes out 1 thing (they are not allowed to look either!) and they gotta put it on : ) <br>  <br>  Do this until everyone has something on.<br>  <br>  If you want someone to "win" the game....<br>  @ the beginning put a peice of paper with say (ex: black bra) on it and put it in a envelope and at the end read it aloud and whoever has it on wins !|`|xoay6iMoaa	careoke is gd with like the sing alongs thn a guess the question so some1 says the answer nd u must guess the question !!|`|yUpHZwTMaa	you should rent a brand new movie or one you all havent seen and make it lke a red carpet movie premiere.... lol
sYiW1oi0aa	Well, it's only going for $8 on GameStop's website.. If it's an LE, in good-to-mint condition and you're trading for store credit instead of cash, you'll probably get about $5 for it.. <br>  <br>  If you still enjoy playing it, I'd suggest hanging onto it at this point but, if it's just collecting dust on the shelf, I'd see if you've got another couple of games you want to bundle with it and take advantage of one of GameStop's bonus offers.. (Extra $10 credit if you trade 3 next-gen games, regardless of title.)  Or, if you trade your game toward Resident Evil 5, Street Fighter IV or Halo Wars, you'll get an extra 20% credit.. (That's an extra buck anyway.)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/gs/specialty/tradeins/offers.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamestop.com/gs/specialty/tra...</a><br>  <br>  Also, if you become an Edge member, you get an extra 10%-20% trade in credit for used games AND an extra 10%-20% discount on buying used games, etc.. <br>  <br>  Have a good one!|`|POg4oHuTaa	Well, the trade-in for the regular edition is supposed to be $1.50, but the limited edition could be a little more. However, I don't know if the place you are at would accept anything extra besides the DVD. It depends on the store you go to, if they would take the whole thing. If they do, it would probably go up about $5.00, maybe a little more.

8Ic3r9i8aa	They arent zombies, they are INFECTED. <br>  Like Resident Evil 5, they arent zombies, they are infected.<br>  The difference between the 2 is that INFECTED are strong, fast, and deadly<br>  while zombies are slow, dead brained, and dont think about anything but brains.|`|XKiMAh39aa	WITCHES ARE NOT ZOMBIES<br>   THEY ARE CALLED INFECTED<br>      AND WITCHES BELONG TO "SPECIAL INFECTED CATEGORY"<br>         LIKE THE HUNTERS,SMOKERS.BOMMERS AND THE BIG BOSS THE TANK<br>  <br>  AND WITCHES CAN'T BE PLAYED IN VS MODE BECAUSE THEY ARE STRICKLY A.I. CONTROLLED ( AND IT REALLY SUCKS IF YOU BECOME A WITCH BECUZ ALL YOU CAN DO IS SIT THERE AND CRY AND W8 FOR THEM 2 DISTURB YOU XD.)|`|9eFqVE5Gaa	yeaaa re edit your question to where it makes a bit of sense and ill totally re answer :)|`|DFXyD8riaa	yeah, all the bad things in that game are.  <br>  <br>  what did you think they were?|`|e7d0014120621cc2da3aff40f27b4308aa	yes, the witches from left 4 dead are zombies|`|Y088seqoaa	say what?|`|7Q7dFghmaa	Eat Funyuns.|`|OgkGsCkvaa	Supposedly, none of them are actually zombies, they are infected.  I saw somewhere online that the box coverart was mistaken when it says zombies.
nHJSRUxUaa	nope.... Effort Values r kinda fixed so. They have a limit.... they cant be higher more than that... and u can check that out by using 1 of any vitamins...... after using it if it sayz it doesnt have any effect the the EVs r totally fulled...... agin if u got Extra EV on useless starts then use those EV lowering berries......|`|xoay6iMoaa	well have u got it to lv 100<br>  <br>  ifso thn breed it again and its proven each time depending on nature they get a little stronger|`|bfsym1dsaa	Nope. Now the most you can do is leveling it to Level 100.
rsqgMKN9aa	Instead of pressing wohoo you have to press try for baby or they will not have a baby.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	You have to get both up to 100 then click on the bed and try for baby with a yahoo. You can also do that with closets and elevators (if you have apartments) tents and hammock (if you have bon voyage) spa, double bed. Just make sure both Sims have a heart next to their picture.|`|CWrDdr89aa	Make sure that your couple have a high enough relationship to 'try for a baby' as well as 'woohoo', and a clue is when they're finished, if a baby lullaby plays, your female is pregnant. Try 'woohooing' in other location (E.G Hot Tub, Clothing Booth etc) and see if the results differ. I've also heard (but I do not know if its true) that if you're controlling the male and make him select the 'try for baby' option, it will increase your chances.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|1ovWmBoyaa	well if there married it should work when there cuddling click on the person and pick Try for Baby.<br>  <br>  and after it should play a lullaby song if shes pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope it helps! (:<br>  <br>  oh and she will throw up cuz morning sickness but not right away. like a day later or something|`|58a280b909e38ffa527544e0e898256eaa	you honestly don,t know how to have kids in the sims do you? find a woman marry her and have kids.|`|EflQo1V8aa	just keep trying. it doesn't always happen right away it takes a few tries. lol|`|SyVst4Qkaa	There should be an option 'try for a baby' you may have to get them to try a few times but she should get pregnant eventually.<br>  I'm not certain but I think Sims have to be living together before you can get this option.<br>  Normal 'woohoo' wont make a Sim pregnant.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|UpopE7fnaa	ask the stalk to bring you a baby|`|ZHbDYF1Kaa	no babies or kids allowed in sims 2<br>  i know its gay but at least u never have to use a condem
lMs7qoQgaa	Fallout 3 is an amazing game but it has a lot and I mean a lot of glitches but it is still a lot of fun, cod4 is a great game and has a really good online Multiplayer but if you are going to get killzone 2 don't get it, killzone would blow it out of the water, and lastly gta 4 is a fun game but at times it gets old, also if you want a fun game for the ps3 get bioshock its tons of fun and well worth the money|`|JdOiTTnfaa	I would get Resistance 2 over SF4.  If you aren't really into fighting games that much, SF4 will get old fast.|`|mWZixK1Oaa	no|`|Del5F0anaa	I got it today,<br>  it is ****,<br>  its so much harder than usual to pull off special moves.<br>  Shame.
J1elZSMUaa	If you want two players on the same xbox, on the main screen where theres like a police car or something in the background and a couple zombies walking around where you are able to pick which game mode you want, have the second player press the start button which should then sign him in. It's that simple.|`|LMaHZxe3aa	As far as I know, the only way to play multiplayer is over Xbox Live via an active subscription.
1G6fvr2gaa	Yes u can download games directly to the memory card. <br>  I have had mine hacked for over 2 years. NOT ONE PROBLEM!|`|X92FdfPeaa	hacking anything gives it a higher chance of it not working anymore or getting messed up. If u must hack it then watch a video on youtube. But if u dont want to mess up you psp, just leave it alone.|`|58a280b909e38ffa527544e0e898256eaa	well in order to hack you have to be good at math and i can safely say that once you hack it you might or might not be able to play it.|`|qX3bl0gnaa	yes.a psp 3000 can be hacked only using the gripshift exploit(google it) as long as ur firmware is not over 5.02.there are so many things that a hacked psp can do u will have to google to find a complete search

And you also have fate: undiscovered realms as well, which is the second one|`|zLcYfde4aa	Oblivion. You have to play it. Great graphics, very long story and weeks worth of gameplay. I played it for 3 weeks without playing anything else and came nowhere near to completing it.|`|UzFWLTquaa	FFXI - Final Fantasy XI, I played it almost every day for 1 and a half years and eventually I just got bored of it but I still love the game.  Its so much fun but keep in mind that it is VERY time consuming.  It is an MMO and can be played on PC, PS2, and XBOX 360.  its $12.00 a month and $1.00 for every additional character besides the first one you make.  If you are familiar with Final Fantasy then you should like XI,  theres missions from I think 4 expansion packs so 4 sets of missions, tons and tons of quests, there are 15 jobs to choose from throughout the game (you can change jobs while still retaining your levels on other jobs whenever you please), you can use subjobs which allow you to have some of the same abilities as your second job choice, you can do group events (most are for aquiring better armor) like Einerjar, Dynamis, Salvage, Sea, Sky, and the new armor group they just added (I forget what its called).  You can have linkshells which are the same as guilds.  There are auction houses for you to buy and sell.  You can synthesize items too, there 9 categories of crafting or synthing like woodworking, goldsmithing, fishing, blacksmithing, cooking, clothcraft, leathercraft, bonecraft, and alchemy.  There are so many elements to the game and its all really really fun.

AA12177717	There are any number of sizes of plastic storage bins that would probably work for your purpose.  The larger Sterilte carry bins will hold the round looms and have a removable tray in the top for scissors, measuring tapes and other small tools.  The large storage boxes are great for keeping your yarn stash--I know I have 20 of them, mostly 56 gallon size--downstairs with my yarn and wool stash in them. Label all storage containers with their contents.

Jvty3alxaa	I'm kinda bias towards the Wii because its my favorite gaming system but to make a good choice you should look at the games you want more of. If you want shooting games buy for the PS2 and as for choosing between the gamecube and the Wii, go for the Wii, it's the same company and the same type of games.  Here are some good games for the PS2:Mercenaries, Star Wars battlefront,Rachet and Clank and Call of Duty  Here are some good games for the Wii (these are often out of stock in stores): Mario Kart, Star Wars Battlefront, Super Smash Bros and Wii Ski (you don't need the balance board).|`|DtkLsetkaa	For Wii get Madden 09 (which i have recently fallen in love with).  No idea what kind of games you are into so that's my only suggestion for now =P
aw9wrKseaa	Cheat Player Invulnerability  While playing in offline mode, pause the game and input UP, UP, UP, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, UP, UP, UP, LEFT, RIGHT. A sound similar to the effect you hear when you pause the game will occur. This code cannot be turned off until you shut off your game system.    Submitted by MAROK  Cheat Slow-Mo Sounds  While playing, pause the game and input UP, UP, UP, LEFT, UP, DOWN, UP, UP, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. The code turns off only when your game system is rebooted and may only be entered in Rise of an Empire mode.  Submitted by MAROK  Cheat: Regerating Ammo  Pause while playing offline and input UP, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. A chirp similar to the one heard when pausing will occur. Your ammo counter will go down, but will refill instantly when reloading.

Submitted by darthranat21  Cheat FX Change  While playing, pause and input UP, DOWN, LEFT, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. (Unverified).    Submitted by gary-spratt  Hint: Jedi Murder  Jedi and Sith enemies are tough to take down, but not impossible. Simply order several AI bots to follow and open fire en masse on one target. The stamina meter of the enemy is still present and enough blaster hits will penetrate the defenses to take them down.    The best jobs for taking down Jedi and Sith are the special limited classes (Clone Commanders, Dark Troopers, Droidekas, Wookies, etc).  Submitted by faididi & simalcrum  Hint: Getting More Power From Scotty  In Space Assault, the shield generator can be restored if the shields are down or if the generator is destroyed. Keeping the shields up prevents any Genesis-like events from taking out your ship's vital systems and letting the other team earn victory points.  Submitted by faididi & simalcrum  Hint: Health To Go  In space battles, the auto-turret computer room is heavily defended. You can move to the corner of the blast wall in the corner and sometimes get healed by the medical droid on the other side. This only works for some ships and if the droid is still working. You can do the same for the ammo droid as well.  Submitted by ih8theism  Hint: Time Bomb Surprise  During a space assault session, a fast method to get rid of enemy fighters is to place a time bomb on the ship just before it takes off. Duck and hide near any one of the ships and wait until an enemy goes for it. Time bombs stick to most surfaces and by the time the starship takes off and leaves the hangar, it's often too late for the player to exit.  Submitted by AlexQ116  Hint: Space Assault Time Bomb Timing  The pilot's time bombs are the most potent explosive for space assault. Use them to destroy the critical systems inside enemy ships:    Shield Generator ... 4 time bombs to destroy.  Autoturret Mainframe ... 2 time bombs to destroy.  Life Support ... 3 time bombs to destroy.  Engine Cooling System ... 3 time bombs to destroy.    Note this assumes the enemy team does not repair the systems being attacked.  Hint: Puking Items  In Jabba's Palace, you can get your soldier to release a stream of item pick-ups by pruposely dying in the rancor's cltuches. Once your character is grabbed, hit pause and choose to respawn. Confirm and watch that stuff fly out.  Submitted by firemonkey00  Hint: Bot Blindspot (Space Assault)  Bots tend to lack the ability to think in Space Assault. If you rely on them heavily, here're some tricks to make them behave in relation to the very important transport in space assault:    Bots that are passengers disembark when the shuttle lands the first time.    Bots that are occupying a weapons position (including the un-bot-friendly tracking missile) disembark each subsequent time to you land.    Bots cannot reenter the shuttle (and subsequently explode it) if you land it on a ramp or on a narrow stretch of floor (as on some stages) since the majority of the shuttle body is floating off the ground.  Submitted by cinderquil  Hint: Legendary Medals  In your profile's options, your career statistics lists the medals and awards for that profile. If you successfully perform a specific task to earn a particular award 64 or more times, you will permanently unlock that battle bonus for that profile.    The easiest way to do this (apart from saving the profile after each battle, win or lose) is to enter the single-player training level and perform those tasks repeatedly. The training stage is one stage you cannot lose in and have infinite respawns. Stop short of taking down the droids with Mace Windu or taking over the final enemy bunker and you have literally all day to complete your tasks.    For the demolition award, it may be easier to play as a Rebel on Hoth and attack the underside neck of Imperial AT-ATs.    Your job's stock weapon will be your default choice when you ch
UysG9U3yaa	i live in florida and before the tampa distribution center opened (or were ever the FL one is) i had the one game plan, at most your three days out of a game.. normally not a problem around a work schedule or something in my opinion it is so worth it.  So many 60 dollar games don't have the play value to make it through a weekend any way and then a day or three break isn't that bad in exchange for almost 60 dollars saved.

Resi 5 is a horror game, and if you are into stuff like left4dead or Doom then i suggest this game.  Killzone 2 however is more of a CoD style game. This game has generated huge amounts of hype of the last few weeks, and seeing as it only goes on the ps3 as it is the only console able to handle it, ps3 sales should go up. Obviously, as this game is generating so much hype, it would definitely have a large online community, and if you are into the multiplayer stuff, then KZ2 is the game for you.   more info on www.gamespot.com

qeu6vWCHaa	It's really not that great. I bought one when I purchased a copy of Gears of War 2. I find the inner lining of the headphones gets quite stuffy if used for more than thirty minutes or so. Also, seeing how I actually was playing CoD5 during that span as well I can tell you first hand how it handled that game.    Whenever there was any sort of action going on (shooting, explosions, etc.), during dialogue everything got screwy. Either the dialogue was drowned out, or the action was really muffled.    The worst thing about the X1's is when you're playing with others. Whenever someone is talking you will have serious difficulties hearing either them, what's happening around you, or sometimes even both.    Oh and last but not least there's a TON of wires, and I do mean a ton. They're long, awkward, numerous, and frustrating. They're very hard to keep sorted. The only perk about having these wires is they are extremely long, allowing you to sit far away from the T.V.      Here's how I would rate them:  Comfort - 2/5  Noise Canceling - 4/5  Voice Clarity/Chat - 2/5  Sound Quality - 3/5  Overall - *3/5*    The only reason it's a 3/5 instead of a 2/5 is they truly are very nice to have if you're gaming late at night, and still want to crank up the T.V.
tR0YwMzMaa	did you buy the game new or used? if it's used it's probably just old and doesn't work. If it's a new game, it could be your system, for example, if your playing on an x box 6 years old, it's probably time to get a new x box. hmmm, this is confusing, lets see, do you have a 3d video card in, i know that i have certain games in which you need a vid card. it's simple if you don't have one, they sell them at your local Gamestop for a mere 10-20$. then simply tput it in your extra memory disc slot and restart the game. i hope this works for you because i know how anxious you are to play.

GDKBqwwJaa	I just got hired at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom and they talked about this. Yes, they are in debt, around 2.3 billion I believe, but they aren't near closing or going out of business. Six Flags recently purchased (in 2007) the property that Discovery Kingdom is on, for $52 million. They wouldn't have done this if they were in danger of closing. This year, Six Flags expects to make a good amount of money becuz as the economy sucks, people won't be going on week long vacations to Hawaii and Europe. Instead, they will go to an amusement park for a day and spend $80 becuz they still want to do something fun and affordable.|`|mTwn8p79aa	There's been no official word except that going bankrupt isn't a possibility.

Ever since I joined Xbox Live I have played with girls online consistently.  Some I know personally, some I don't know at all. I usually only play with couples now. Me and my girlfriend along with my buddy and his girl. It's quite normal now in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Girls actually make up a decent amount of the gamer population.  Girls are even moving into higher positions within the gaming industry. Back in school, I remember being told that if a girl wanted a job in game development, most of the time just being a girl would get them through the door and into an awesome, exciting career.  I have personally seen that to be true.  Of course you have to be talented in the skill they're hiring for but for the most part, game studios WANT girl developers.  It offers a whole other perspective in game development.<br>  <br>  I still find it odd when people online find out they're playing with or against a girl as if girls don't know anything about games. This is 2009.  Nintendo Wii came out and attracted a whole other audience besides males 18-35.. I think in the future, you will see girls in games become less rare than back in the "old days" when games were just for nerdy guys in their basement.

And it'll still kick the holy crap out of most people who play chess, and it can be set to different strengths. And it will allow you to set up positions to play out.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  "William B's" recommendation is excellent.  Winboard is  a great program, and it's also free.  Go for that one as well.|`|BNqbOfBsaa	Fritz is good. So is shredder... you can try chessmaster but the other 2 have much more powerful engines for that type of stuff.

U1lmbP7kaa	I think fallout 3 was praised for it's great graphics, and how easy it was to get hooked on the gameplay. but i do not think people saw it as the next step in already great storylines in games. i agree the game had its drawbacks, but above all it looked cool and it was easy for some newer gamers to get used to.|`|eGsNFUeiaa	I agree.<br>  <br>  The ending was so abrupt. I seriously was disappointed. I wanted the story to finish intelligently, but it didn't :(|`|C1Cobi1taa	i loved oblivion, at least when you finish the main quest you can keep playing the game. lol i was so uspet at the end of fall out 3, i liked watching fallout being played, it's amusing, but really think they could have come up with a better ending|`|jVUEohsNaa	It is a great game.  I love wandering the wastelands.  I think it is the best game I have ever played.  Bioshock was pretty good too!
s2wcWcu1aa	GAT IV - you play this man called niko who caomes from russia to be with his brother and help him out and make a good life and that kind of thing. following the format of all other GTA games, you get involved in crime blablah. if you've played san andreas you will most likely play this game and thisnk "this almost feels like a step back". that said it has some cool new features, like morality choices, which can lead to 2 different endings, so you actually feel like your actions are having an impact on the world and the way you are viewed, unlike the other games in the series :p i think its a pretty good game, and despite what some have said it does have good replay value, and is really just a fun game to play :D it looks pretty snazzy too, and the driving on it is MUCH better than the others.<br>  <br>  fallout 3 - also, a lot like other fallout games. you live in this underground city called the vault, when your a kid your mum dies, and your dad raises you up. then your dad escapes from this underground city, and basically you follow him. and generally be violent.<br>  it is a pretty good game, ive not got huge knowledge of it cause ive only played round a mates house, but i really dont think its as good as GTA. its a bit bland colour wise, sorta groggy and depressing looking if im being honest ??<br>  <br>  lol why not get call of duty? :p haha i joke, anyhow, i'd reccomend GTA 4, hope this helps a bit :)|`|5phKCmnfaa	the first game my ps3 played is gta iv and that is the reason why i bought a ps3 and it was the first game for my friend on his ps3 and the most people in my class got it first for thier ps3,s cuz it,s the best game to start with a ps3 man i m tellin ya gta got the most funable online games and i hope i play with u online ;P|`|A1OQuNcAaa	definitely get fallout 3 if you don't mind having to walk everywhere and love highly interactive story lines but if you like not having to worry about changing the game a whole lot then and enjoy driving then go for gta definately go for both if you can|`|SFNMPdYOaa	Fallout 3|`|47ddda29b6896ce72acab50c6bef43fdaa	GTA4...more replay value and the game is kick ***!|`|jxpV13rTaa	good call on the ps3..it will last you a long time. anyways gta iv is good, but i found that you dont get nearly as much playback time after you beat the game as san andreas..i just ended up getting bored and stopped playing. the graphics on the other hand are unreal and very impressive. fallout 3 is probably one of the best games i have ever played. it has a unique take on an rpg that still keeps the action and excitement of a first person shooter. (you can choose to play in first person or third person, but first person is much better) even after you beat the game, there is sooo much to explore and side missions to complete. there are hundreds of hours of gameplay, so i would stick with fallout 3 over most games.|`|7Ca2ns47aa	Well, personally, I found Fallout 3 very depressing... too depressing for my taste... but still awesome because it's just as open-ended as Oblivion. I'd go for GTA... who doesn't like GTA?!?!|`|gAjtiPXHaa	depends really if you dont mind slaughtering zombies and mutated creatures then Fallout 3 (NOTE fallout 3 is not for the easily scared plz check if you are easily scared or not by watching some type of scary horror movie) <br>  <br>  or in GTA IV you dont mind killing people, stealing cars, or foul language (its not present all the time so its not gonna be like " i want that mutha Fu**er out of my F**ing house")|`|eGsNFUeiaa	GTA 4 (Great multiplayer and great single player) or Metal Gear Solid 4 (excellent single player, great multiplayer)<br>  <br>  DO NOT BUY FALLOUT 3 (It isn't that fun and there isn't much replay value, not to mention its expensive, buggy and no DLC content on the PS3), just rent it.<br>  <br>  Buy GTA 4 for the PS3 because the 360 version controls are a little wonky trying to get used to them. I found driving a car on the PS3 version a lot easier than on the 360.|`|9dmylL0saa	i dont have a ps3 but i do have a 360 with gta4 and i love it cause you can do glitches and other cool stuff when i get the time i will post vids of me playing gta4 doing glitches so you can see on youtube sometime|`|R5jASl9Yaa	gta = fun shooter like the other gtas (all the same in the end)<br>  fallout 3 = gr8 rpg but its got no colour (shity brown all over)

It has a picture of a purple fairy next to it. People there are willing to help you all the time.<br>  If you ask there, one of two things will happen:<br>  1. The other users will help by giving you a link to a shop that you can click on. Here you can buy the item.<br>  or<br>  2. The other users will help by giving you the name of a user that has the item in his or her shop. You copy that name and paste it into the search bar on the left (its quite small, but you will find it). Then you click on that user, click on his shop, and find the item.<br>  <br>  Then you go to "Pet Central", scroll down and on the right you can click on Faerie Quests - then you turn it in!<br>  Good luck!

bacgwHhOaa	Well death knights start at lvl 55, but you get there mount from one of the quests in the quest line in the DK start area, but if you did have the rep you would be able to get a nightstalker, but if i were you I would stick to DK start mount untill 70 do some battle grounds for a day, or proably even less....and get the pvp nightstalker :D, but to make sure i answer your question!!! Yes death knight have specific mounts ( like humans have horses, dwarfs have rams, gnomes have mecostriders, nightelfs have nightsabers) but if you were to grind up your rep with darnassus you would be able to get a nightstalker if you really wanted too! And well that would knock off 1 out of the 5 reps to get the Ambassador title =p.

These are some of my most used classes listed below    (any sniper apart frm the Arisaka) my personal favourite though is the springfield  stopping power  steady aim/deep impact      Gewehr 43  stopping power  steady aim      type100  stopping power  steady aim    the type100 and gewehr 43 are my personal favourites    Type100 is my favourite automatic gun as for there is hardly any recoil unlike the mp40 and thompson and i prefer to aim not spray so its easyer, stg-44 is also another gun with hardly any recoil but ur not 37 yet and i just dont like it as much.    Hope this helps, try some out but most of it is just practice

qeu6vWCHaa	If it's for PvP I would suggest being Undead. Being able to break a fear is a huge deal, since it allows you to save your PvP trinket for something more important like a polymorph, or a stun.    If you're going PvE I would suggest troll. Their racial ability is much more useful in PvE.     If you are all about looking pretty, go Blood Elf.     I personally would never be anything but an Undead Priest for the PvP utility.    Hope that helped you out.

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi. There are three independant Roman families in the game, the house of Brutii, Scipii and Julii.     The main difference between these houses are their geographical location and the senate missions available.     - If you play as the house of Julii, the Senate will demand you face the fearsome warriors of Gaul to Western Europe and Germanic tribes northwards. Your two beginning cities are Arretium and Arminum. The barbaric, un-advanced and small populated towns you will conquer won't provide you with a lot of money, requiring constant upgrading. On the plus side, your foes are often unequipped, poorly disciplined, unorganized and quite frankly, laughable.    - If you play as the house of Scipii, the Senate pitches you the exciting prospect of invading North Africa and extending your rule to the Middle-East. You start with the town of Capua on mainland Italy, and a small coastal settlement, Messana, on Sicily. While opposing Carthage, another contendor for glory in the Mediterranean, you will gain many riches.    - If you play as the house of Brutii, the Senate is interested in the rich culture, architecture, gold and fertile lands in Greece. You will be ordered to attack Eastwards, spreading your influence through the region of Thrace and upper Russia. Your first provinces are Tarentum and Croton. Successfully executing such a plan will result in a full coffer of Denarii in years to come, and a secure foothold into other parts of the world.  --------------------------------------...    Despite common belief, each Roman family has practically the same type of infantry, cavalry, missile and naval units.     They do however, have a small number of unique special units.     - Scipii has access to Mirmillo Gladiators, the reasonably powerful Corvus Quinquireme vessel and the best boat in the game - a Deceres.    - Brutii only has access to Velite Gladiators.    - Julii can build Samnite Gladiators for warfare and also Arcani - brave battlefield opponents capable of hiding admist conflict and springing surprise attacks.      If you need to know more, just post "additional details" and I will get straight back to you.|`|Iva8drdfaa	The biggest difference is where their strength lies, and the enemies they must fight.    The Julii have a military advantage in the game fighting against barbarians.  Though their cavalry is weaker, their infantry can win the fight without issue.  They get a special unit of Gladiators called "Samnite Gladiators"  The Julii will have the least money overall, due to their location, and inability to sufficiently rake in cash, as easily as the others.    The Brutii have a cavalry advantage against the Greeks, who will be their major enemies.  Though their infantry is better than phalanxes, they will have a harder time, unless they can use their mobility as an advantage.  They have special Gladiatrs called the Velite Gladiators.  The Brutii will be raking in the most cash the fastest, as they will take the rich lands of the Greeks.    And the The Scipii have the Naval advantage.  As they have a special ship called the "Korvus Quinquireme", the strongest in the game.  Spending most of their time fighting against Carthage, they will rake in good dough, the second most of the factions, Until they take on Egypt, in which they will be the undisputed richest of the Romans.  Their gladiators are the "Mirmillio Gladiators".          All in all, they all have the same units, aside from their gladiator classes, and the Scipii have one extra ship type.  The differences between them come only from the enemies they face, meaning they all have different strategies to fight.        If you want to know more, you can just message me (just make sure I have the ability to message you back)|`|joyRBLK9aa	well the 3rd one is julii and the differences are just that you fight different faction i know the julii fights barbarians but i forgot what the others fight but you get different missions and fight different guys.  they also have different colours brutii is green scipii is blue and julii is red.

M7G3MZb5aa	Well, i live near atlantic city, and info relevant to AC is always of interest to me, i once stumbled upon a link to the NJ ccc's websight that showed the amount of money claimed for taxes from each casino at each game, it showed the total amoutn of wagers made in each type of game, and the hold percentage for each, the hold percentage is a good way to estimate it and for slot machines in particular with millions and billions of trials, it will be very close to the actual number, it was broken down by coin denominations for the slot mahcine listings.  this is the link.... <a href="http://www.njccc.gov/casinos/financia/mthrev/docs/2008/200811revenue.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.njccc.gov/casinos/financia/mt...</a><br>  <br>  while its is for atlantic city, you can see that in general, there is a trend for slot machines of deifferent denominations, and its likely to be similer at casinos in indiana, and even more similer for casinos owned by the same corperate entity, in atlantic city, harrahs owns one of the casinos in indiana, i forget which one, but its not the grand victoria, cause i played there once, and i dont recal them owning it. pinnacle owns the other one i think, but pinnacle doesnt have any casinos in AC yet, they were suposed to but its not done yet.<br>  <br>  anywho, you shoudl be able to get a rough idea of what your up against, it pretty bad, getting a 88-93% return on investment is a bad idea, you shoudl play blackjack instead, even without counting cards, you will get WAYYY better odds than that, using a basic strateyg card, you will be looking at a 99.3% - 99.6% return on investment, only if you use basic strategy though, if you play like a normal gambler your loss rate will fall to what that link i showed you suggests.<br>  <br>  grand victoria is VERY TINY, if you wnat to have fun, i recomend gogin to any other casino, as there will likely be more to do, its a good casino, if yoru gogin just to gamble, but thats not true for everybody so i figured id just toss it up there, the potowatami, in wisconson was pretty nice, it may be worth the drive, it looks crummy and sleazy on the outside but dont let it fool you.|`|lZ8VBYlgaa	It's posted on every slot machine.

QEkznIewaa	I am not entirely sure what you mean by "ripple stitch" but I am assuming that you mean a stitch something like this <a href="http://www.lionbrand.com/cgi-bin/faq-search.cgi?store=/stores/eyarn&faqKey=355&language=En" rel="nofollow">http://www.lionbrand.com/cgi-bin/faq-sea...</a> or <a href="http://www.lionbrand.com/cgi-bin/faq-search.cgi?store=/stores/eyarn&faqKey=360&language=En" rel="nofollow">http://www.lionbrand.com/cgi-bin/faq-sea...</a> or <a href="http://www.crochetcabana.com/tutorials/ripple.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.crochetcabana.com/tutorials/r...</a> . These patterns are very simple. I hope that this is what you were looking for. Have a Great Day!|`|4IBCRw2waa	I'm not too sure what you mean by ripple pattern.  I have been crocheting for 23 years, however, I sort of make up my own stitches b/c reading patterns is not very easy for me (also my grandma taught me when I was 4 and she didn't read patterns so I didn't feel the need to learn).   I have come up with a lot of unique stitches, but not sure what to call them.<br>  <br>  You could do a double crochet on your first line and when you turn to go back to the other side, only to into the back loop of yarn instead of the front and back loops.  Every time you turn around only go into the back loop, and as you build the blanket will "ripple" ... that is ripple in a row configuration.  If you want a ripple in the border that would be something completely different, yet also doable.<br>  <br>  Just not sure what your meaning of ripple is compared to mine... please feel free to contact me if you have questions, I can attempt to help :)

HaCxF93Maa	A quilt is a good project for the inexperience sewer.  I am a quilter, but don't do regular sewing.  I taught myself to quilt.  For more information on quilting, including several baby quilts, go to <a href="http://www.appliquequiltdesigns.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.appliquequiltdesigns.com</a>|`|y02PZj22aa	Well, it depends on the quilt.  Actually, my first sewing project was a pieced quilt using the 9-patch design.  I was 9 years old at the time, and I just did the piecing, not the quilting, so I suspect that you can do it.  <br>  <br>  Here is a pattern that has good directions that is within the capabilities of a beginner, if you either tie the quilt or have it machine quilted by a professional.  And it's the right size for a baby's crib (40" x 40").  <a href="http://www.claudiasquiltshoppe.com/Absolute6SweetBaby.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.claudiasquiltshoppe.com/Absol...</a><br>  <br>  The directions don't tell you the "how-to" of cutting and piecing or what to do when you are ready to assemble the quilt.  This page has links to that information:  <a href="http://www.victorianaquiltdesigns.net/QuiltingLessons.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.victorianaquiltdesigns.net/Qu...</a><br>  <br>  My daughter, who did not inherit the craft gene, wanted to make a crib quilt for a friend's new baby, so she bought a pre-printed fabric ("cheater's quilt top"), the batting, and the backing and assembled (including folding the backing over the edges and stitching it down for a binding) and tied the quilt.  It took her two afternoons/evenings with help from me.  It looked very nice when she finished.|`|bHUhaTnkaa	Yes!  I started quilting when I was in my late 50's.  I knew nothing about sewing and still only know how to quilt.  I would have no idea how to do any other sewing.  I started by buying a beginners quilting book that started with the very basics.  After I told a friend that I was trying to learn to quilt, she helped me one day a week to learn how to use the machine and basic sewing skills.  I didn't have any idea how to cut material properly.  I was a teach, I knew how to cut paper, but not the correct way to cut material.  I started just following the beginning blocks in my book.<br>  I have to admit that I am not a very good quilter.  But I love it and that if all that is important.  If you want to start with a baby quilt, find  a quilter and ask if she/he has an easy pattern that you could use. Quilter are very helpful people.<br>  Good Luck!|`|jjDZJmfpaa	You can get one block of fabric measured as big as you would like in the store and get a contrasting color of the same measurement. Do the same with the batting. Sandwich them together with quilting pins and use bias tape to finish off the edge. If you would like to get a little decorative you can make prairie points along the edge or use a tracing pencil and trace a decorative pattern on the front of the quilt and sew the batting down using the trace as a guide.<br>  <br>  All of these directions can be found on <a href="http://www.youtube.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com</a> Put prairie points in the search engine and click on the many videos that are available to you for free.|`|PXWVGQyAaa	I would suggest that you buy a baby quilt panel and add a lining and batting for your first quilt. If you are ambitious, you could add a border as well.  I did this for my first grandchild and it turned out great.|`|6N3yjlXhaa	Here is a video that may help you decide - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQSEQRgtGkE&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQSEQRgtG...</a>

AA11614996	Hi: <br>  <br>  The first thing I do : see if the shaft is broke than see if it connected to the main rotor if it loose it  not going to generate any lift all .If there all good the try the controls See if move the main rotor blade up and down. If that don't work ?  Then take it back to where you bought it from; along with the sale receipt and show them the item is defective|`|htVHdCfnaa	If your helicopter is spinning then the rotor on the tail isn't spinning fast enough to compensate for the inertia created by the top rotor.  There should be an adjustment for this speed on the copter or the controller.

Gi0jEqaSaa	FAMAS is good. SCAR is good too. Draganov sniper is really bad! Get the 1 shot kill sniper the white 1! Ak 74u is pree good with a scope, because it has fast shooting rate. In the endit's whatever kind of style u like to play in and what map too.|`|2SzLx5Knaa	A rifle F-36,<br>  those are my favorites.<br>  i always use them.|`|Hn3X6enqaa	I really love the P-90<br>  <br>  The scope is useful for mid-long range combat since it moves so slowly. It can be used for sniping, just be careful when you burst it. The recoil of it is low, the fire rate is high and the damage is about medium (taking about 5-7 shots to kill)<br>  <br>  There are really only 2 drawbacks. The first is that it's expensive and the second is that it only has 100 ammo, meaning that u need to scab another gun after about your 4th kill.
bfsym1dsaa	The Pokemon choices on one's team have a few factors you need to remember: Defense, Heal, Damage, Balance and Offense. Both offense and defense should be covered in both spectrums of Physical and Special.<br>  <br>  When making a team, remember that you MUST, MUST, MUST selectively breed/catch/hatch Pokemon with the correct natures (such as defensive Pokemon should have a nature that benefits one of the defenses, while offensive Pokemon should have a nature that helps with its attack or special attack, depends on the one it uses, or speed.) Without the right nature, you can't be a good Pokemon trainer.<br>  <br>  Second of all, always EV train. To learn more about EVing, I will cover that at the end.<br>  <br>  Third of all, never have redundant moves. For example, here are two Arcanines that you may compare their move sets with:<br>  <br>  * Arcanine 1: Flare Blitz, Fire Blast, Flamethrower, Heat Wave<br>  * Arcanine 2: ExtremeSpeed, Flare Blitz, Thunder Fang, Iron Head<br>  <br>  The first one is obviously, to most players think, OH, a Fire Pokemon with a lot of Fire type moves. Great! Uggh... No. If you look at Arcanine 2, ExtremeSpeed can hit anything that is faster than Arcanine since it always strikes first. Flare Blitz is the standard Fire type move. Thunder Fang can hit Super Effective on Water types, which Arcanine 1 can't do anything to. Iron Head is for Rock types, which again, Arcanine 1 cannot do anything to. With different types of moves, you have better coverage of opponent's Pokemon, hence higher chance of you hitting a Super Effective hit.<br>  <br>  Or you can think of it as: Arcanine 1 can't do anything to Politoed; Politoed uses Surf and kills Arcanine 1. Arcanine 2 uses Thunder Fang, hits Super Effective, kills Politoed. Which Arcanine would you choose? The answer is pretty obvious.<br>  <br>  Now, with that covered, here are in choosing Power of the moves. Remember, the power listed may not be the true power of the move. More often or not, they're not at all. Here are a few things you should learn:<br>  <br>  1) STAB. This stands for Same Type Attack Bonus, which means, if the move used is the same type as the Pokemon, the power of the move is increased to 1.5x of its original. Now take a look at Arcanine's Flare Blitz. As listed, it has 120 Power, but if you factor in STAB, it has 180 Power if hit neutral, and 360 Power if hit Super Effective on something that's 2x weak to it (ex. Roserade, Grass type weak to Fire attacks), or 720 Power if it used used on something that's 4x weak to it (ex. Scizor, both Bug and Steel types are weak to Fire attacks). Now, Thunder Fang has 65 Base Power. If hit on something like Politoed, it will have 130 Power, where Flare Blitz will have 90, since it's Not Very Effective (180 * 0.5 = 90.) In this case, Thunder Fang hits harder on Politoed. However, if you look at something like Chatot (Normal/Flying type), Thunder Fang hits Super Effective (130 Power), but Flare Blitz hits Neutral (120 Power + STAB = 180 Power), so in this case, despite the fact that Flare Blitz is neutral, it hits harder by 50 Power points than Thunder Fang. Get it?<br>  <br>  2) Moves that take 2 turns to charge should never be used, with the exception of Shadow Force on Giratina. Here's why, but first, you must know that there are 2 types of 2-turn-attacks: One of them is you will disappear in turn 1, and will be immune to 99.5% of all attacks, such as Fly. Then second type is where you need 1 turn to recharge, whether if it's before or after the attack, such as Sky Attack or Hyper Beam. Neither of these two types of attacks should ever be used for 2 reasons: One is that your opponent gets a free Recover, or switch, or a buff, such as Sword Dance, which is a free turn of them to get double the attack or something: VERY BAD. Secondly, you cannot switch, that means you'll be prone to whatever that's coming for you. In another way if you want to think about it, Hyper Beam has 150 Power, but takes 2 turns since you need recharge, so 75 Power per turn, plus you'll be immobilized the second turn, can't switch, and no freedom. Tri-Attack has 80 Base Power, so 160 Power in 2 turns, plus you have all the freedom to switch attacks, switch out, or do something else if you need, so don't use moves like Hyper Beam. It's only a freebie of a turn handed to your opponent.<br>  <br>  3) If you're using a physical sweeper, like Weavile, who has terrible Special Attack but great Physical attack, do NOT use its weaker stat by using Special moves. Instead of Dark Pulse, use Night Slash. Instead of Ice Beam or Blizzard, use Ice Punch.<br>  <br>  4) Accuracy of moves are also very important. Apart from moves such as Stun Spore, Sleep Powder, Hypnosis, and Focus Blast, moves with 79% Accuracy or Less should not be used at all, ever. Think about it: If you miss, opponent gets a free turn.<br>  <br>  With those in mind, I hope you have a successful time making your team. Keep in mind that put a Pokemon's best stat to its full potential. For example: Skarmory's 140 Base Defense = Skarmory is a great Physical Wall. Blissey's 135 Base Defense + a max HP of possible at 714 = Best Special Wall in game, so use that. Gengar has super high Speed & Special Attack, so it will be Special Sweeper.<br>  <br>  And for moves on Gengar, you don't need Dark Pulse, because Shadow Ball covers all that Dark Pulse covers, besides Shadow Ball gets STAB and Dark Pulse doesn't. Instead, put something like Thunderbolt or Energy Ball. Good luck!<br>  <br>  If you have questions, you can email or message me in YIM by clicking on my picture and visit my profile.

Train the two pokemon until level 16 then go for the 1st Gym badge. Then when in Eterna forest catch a Murkrow. (They may take a long time to evolve mine is not level 47 and i still haven't got a dusk stone however they are very good and are more useful than a Staraptor). I would then catch Bronzor and Bronzong are very very useful. Have those pokemon until you get to Canalave city then get the Riolu egg and evolve it into a Lucario. Finally once you have got strength get a Gible. So your final team should be: Torterra, Luxray, Honchkrow, Bronzong, Lucario and Garchomp. There moves and natures should be: ( Tbh it really doesn't matter about nature until you go into competitive as they only make little change)<br>  <br>  Torterra:<br>  ~ Earthquake<br>  ~ Wood Hammer<br>  ~ Synthesis<br>  ~ Crunch<br>  <br>  Luxray:<br>  ~ Spark<br>  ~ Crunch<br>  ~ Iron Tail<br>  ~ Discharge (Up to you as i don't really know another move)<br>  <br>  Honchkrow:<br>  ~ Night Slash<br>  ~ Steel Wing<br>  ~ Sucker Punch (Used when you are going up against a pkm with higher speed and you're low on hp)<br>  ~ Wing Attack/ Fly/ Drill Peck<br>  <br>  Bronzong:<br>  ~ Extrasensory<br>  ~ Gyro Ball<br>  ~ Rest/ Hypnosis<br>  ~ Steel Talk/ Stealth Rock<br>  <br>  Lucario: (This moveset means you can have any nature)<br>  ~ Earthquake<br>  ~ Aura Sphere<br>  ~ Dark Pulse/ Dragon Pulse<br>  ~ Extremespeed<br>  <br>  Garchomp: (The moveset i will give you will be very hard and involves breeding)<br>  ~ Outrage (Breed with level 64 Dragonite)<br>  ~ Fire Fang<br>  ~ Earthquake<br>  ~ Swords Dance<br>  <br>  Althought that moveset is pretty much impossible to get until you complete the game so instead i suggest:<br>  <br>  Garchomp:<br>  ~ Dig/ Earthquake (Depends on if you have already used earthquake)<br>  ~ Dragon Claw<br>  ~ Fire Fang<br>  ~ Swords Dance/ Dragon Rush  <br>  <br>  <br>  Well hope you use my information and hope it helps :)|`|xoay6iMoaa	id sai my old team tht was based on the new genaration which was unbeaten until i new gamed though i onli did about 30battles but it was<br>  <br>  <br>  weavile<br>  <br>  garchomp<br>  <br>  electrivire<br>  <br>  gliscor<br>  <br>  bronzong<br>  <br>  umbreon was an acception but tht was mint go for it
meqrA9ZZaa	The deck shuffling problem. Solved as with any other language. First you create an array containing the cards (or numbers representing them), and a variable telling how many cards are left. Then whenever you need to draw a card you pick a random integer number in the range of cards left, thus:<br>  <br>  Math.floor(Math.random()*cardsleft) //return a number in the range 0 to cardsleft-1<br>  <br>  Then you, pick the chosen card, and thereafter swich it with the last of the remaining card in the array.<br>  <br>  Eg:<br>  <br>  A deck of four cards: [0,1,2,3], random pick from 0 to 3 return 0, thus the card in position 0 is put into the hand, and 0 is swiched back in order not to be picked again [3,1,2,0], random pick from 0 to 2 return 2, thus card 2 is put into the hand, it is already in the backmost position of the active part of the array, so it stays [3,1,2,0]. Random pick from 0 to 1 return 0, thus card 3 is put into the hand, and the 3 swich place with the 1 [1,3,2,0]. The last card left is then card 1 in position 0.<br>  <br>  In order to make a new draw you don't even need to reset the array, only the counter.<br>  <br>  Let me have a look at your game once you are done.

5hNAgTpaaa	Well, you really need to say more about your class building bridge assignment, what are the rules of the game; are you allowed to use only balsa wood, are you allowed to use any size of wood sections, could you use strings of any types.

UoxracOPaa	nope stay enhancement|`|Y5NtZBRJaa	You would need a different gear set, but it really depends on your playstyle. It's widely agreed that Enhancement is the best levelling spec for Shamans, if I recall.|`|AA10069380	Enhancement because you get the feral spirit

Vampire genesis sucks. I am going to show you my zombie build and you can change it how you want.<br>  <br>  Monsters:<br>  Red-eyes zombie dragon x3<br>  zombie master x2<br>  IL BLUD x2<br>  Paladin of the cursed dragon x3<br>  Goblin Zombie x2<br>  Mezuki <br>  spirit reader<br>  pyramid turtle x2<br>  Jain, lightsworn paladin x2<br>  <br>  spells:<br>  Zombie world x3<br>  call of the mummy x3<br>  brain control<br>  Book of life x3<br>  Card of safe return<br>  monster reborn<br>  pot of avarice x2<br>  Mst<br>  Scapegoat<br>  Foolish Burial x2<br>  <br>  Traps:<br>  Threatening roar x2<br>  Bottomless trap hole x2<br>  Ultimate Offering<br>  <br>  Like i said this was my deck for my last local tournament and it won.

It really is an amazing deck if you play it, but feel free to make any changes.|`|xB0vOgSwaa	ok...honestly this decks isnt going to stand up to a sneeze...srry but its true...you have just a bunch of zombies in there and no real objective...zombies are ment to revive and swarm the field...look at other zombie decks and look at what kind of cards they use.... im already trying to plan out my deck for when crimson crisis comes out<br>  ...look at my questions for my deck and all the edits ive made to it over time and for my wanting deck
013b2405d7f833bc37fa841a7ed4a361aa	w00t lucky u i get max like 30kbps<br>  <br>  i dont think disabling the virus protection will help jus try turning off firewall and do some offline work while its downloading|`|UoxracOPaa	Disable your firewall and turn off your virus protection, make sure you don't browse the web while downloading just to be safe.
3Iyu7hrcaa	OK, you know Omaha... 2 cards in your hand, 3 on the board.  That doesn't change.<br>  <br>  In Hi-Lo, the pot can be split, High hand gets half, Low hand gets half.<br>  <br>  For a hand to qualify as low, there can be no pairs, and nothing higher than an 8.  Straights and flushes do not apply.  An Ace is low.  So having A-2-3-4-5 is the best low hand, and 4-5-6-7-8 would be the worst hand that still qualifies.<br>  <br>  You can use different cards in your hand to make high and low, it just still has to be 2 from your hand, 3 from the board.<br>  <br>  If you have A-3-Q-K in your hand, and the board says K-4-2-7-K, then you have 3 Kings for your high hand, and A-2-3-4-7 for low.<br>  <br>  Obviously, if there are 3 low cards 8 or lower on the board, then there cannot be a low hand, and the High hand takes it all.
C1NgHyu4aa	Not trying to down your parenting but there's a lot of creepers online.|`|oJORZebKaa	Mine is Ps3 BLOWS C0CK 360 RULES!!!
7OZURudXaa	he probaly just thincks it wont be so hard to twist when you use it. I get it might work if you have fast hands.<br>  <br>  ps. i think the wourld record was 30 secs behind their back, try to beat that!! LOL!|`|2O9gM8KKaa	Well , my advice just leave it the way it is and keep practicing and you'll get better and faster , because when you put jelly in it , it will get like sticky and it'll get stuck how it is .|`|4d20446491a7a798682c4161206db004aa	when it dries out, it is going to get stuck|`|QUFAKk1paa	thats lame. hes trying to get u to mess up ur cube before the championship so he can win it|`|HqwzYYINaa	just buy a cheap one and try it out on it|`|N7PHK12raa	lubricates it but it will eat away at the parts inside, use WD-40 instead|`|kyVP0kC7aa	Don't its bad it will loosen up and destroy RUBIK
4er9SBgWaa	it depends on what your class is.  Mages can do the AoE grind and level ridiculously fast.<br>  Other than that, take risks, attack mobs five levels above you (it is possible) or take on groups if you've built your character well enough.<br>  And do lots and lots and LOTS of questing.<br>  <br>   pax.|`|bYoZU8Pvaa	AOE grind with a mage or pay someone from China to play your account for you.|`|P6q0RUVDaa	umm quest/instances|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	The single fastest and most profitable way to level up is to do instances with a very experienced, powerful group that can burn their way through the instance with minimal death and delay. Other than that, and general questing, just make sure to always log out in an inn or in a major city so you can accumulate the 2x exp bonus.
RQzsmvfiaa	To make a Pandora Battery for PSP:<br>  <a href="http://www.acidmods.com/forum/index.php?topic=8629.0;wap2" rel="nofollow">http://www.acidmods.com/forum/index.php?...</a>|`|viC4LZ8gaa	Well easy but really hard. I got music so it might work. You could try the webstite I wrote. Or you could just download it on to your computer. So then you plug in the psp and then download it on to your psp.
5ag4Og6vaa	Nope and you sure as heck can't say it's weird to the stores over at Little Tokyo (I live in Los Angeles). It gets pretty crowded there during the weekend. I happen to like Tarepanda, Mashi Maru and Badtz Maru. It's just something you end up liking since childhood.|`|4IBCRw2waa	My friends think I am weird for making and selling cloth diapers, but they support me in doing so and often even buy from me.  <br>  <br>  I think it is more important that you are doing things to be financially responsible like holding down a job and selling your items is really great!<br>  <br>  Even if you are "weird" does it matter if you enjoy it?<br>  <br>  I know I am weird, but I am loving (almost) every minute of it :)|`|YiemdmrQaa	ive seen weirder.|`|fgwbylGkaa	I think it's cool. It sounds really interesting. And who cares what your friend thinks?
3dfM9f57aa	You can't play any GBA Games on it only the DS games. I know that totally sucks right? I would've bought it if it weren't for that|`|DU8zxsKRaa	Yes you can play Diamond/Pearl/Platinum.  No on Emerald/Ruby.  <br>  <br>  The DSi will play all DS games.  The only thing that DSi cannot do that DS can is play GBA games (or play games using GBA slot, Guitar Hero: On Tour, Pokemon transfer from GBA games into DS games, etc.). <br>  <br>  The network capabilities will be the same, the gaming will be the same (if not better, with the slightly faster processor in it), with a larger screen.<br>  <br>  Then the DSi can do all of the DSi specific things that a DS cannot do:  SD card, camera, downloadable content, etc.|`|AA11991193	The DSi doesn't have the gba slot, so you can't play any GBA games on it. You can still play all your DS games, like pokemon on it.
lLfHkhF8aa	FREEHAND!!!! Get it, it rocks for its price. I say freehand or Flying squirrel but Duncan sucks for the most part.<br>  <br>  All duncan yoyos should come with a warning label saying <br>  <br>  "Warning: This product contains mass amounts of Suckage, it is an insult to humanity, kill it with fire and holy water" lol<br>  <br>  But freehand or flying squirrel........get the freehand|`|MEVMf1bdaa	i have the Duncan BumbleBee YoYo and it is very good for doing tricks. I would strongly recommend it for its cheap price of $12.99. it is very good value for money.
