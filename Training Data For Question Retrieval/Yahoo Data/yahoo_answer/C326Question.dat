20090310033733AAmgRmE	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Why are Aquarius females so rude?	My mom has an Aquarius Moon (Libra Sun) and if there are any qualities she doesn't posses, they're kindness and ability to put things in perspective. She believes she's always right.      I wouldn't consider what I'm referring to as "blunt." Though she personally is, I mean, she snaps very easily. She has a zero tolerance for much of everything, she doesn't want to hear.       Then Friday night, the people I was with ran into a few friends, one being an Aquarius female. I know her from a former love interest back my Sophomore year of high school. She would send me messages asking questions about the guy and so forth.      I was going to be friendly and say, 'hi,' to her, but she gave me a "dirty look" and quickly looked away. She recognized me. But in general she is quite a *****, so it's not entirely too surprising.       Yet the Aquarius males I've met are extremely kind. It's unbelievable.

The problem is I don't know what the title is and I kept on searching over the net the movies are not the same with what I saw. It was about a Thai queen whose son and husband were murdered and she commanded her people to kill all men in their kingdom and it turned out that it was she who killed her husband and son. I'm not really sure but it was something like that.

I went on the bus on my own to a tattoo/ piercing shop near where i live and it was really clean and the man was nice although they sed i had to be 18 without consent and if i wanted it done he had to ring my parents up to ask if it was fine but i didnt go along because i thought they would be a bit freaked out by it. So i have gotta tell her today or tomorrow that i want it done but its gonna be hard convincing her. I have heard loads of cons that im gonna get blood poisoning and die but i still really want it and i dont know if this information is true. It is quite expensive too and i want it cos i like it not because im following the crowd so what do u think is it worth taking the risk to tell my mum and her going banannas or not. Please help me.      Im not immature, im quite responsible and good      She is gonna be so mad cos she is so strict and protective      It makes me upset too that i cant have it when i have waited since 12.      please dont say anything stupid i want a good answer thanks.

20090310042239AAcakh8	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Have you heard this one?	Creation Theory            In the beginning, God created the Heavens and the Earth and populated   the Earth with broccoli, cauliflower and spinach, green and yellow and red vegetables of all kinds, so Man and Woman would live long and healthy lives.      Then using God's great gifts, Satan created Ben and Jerry's Ice   Cream and Krispy Creme Donuts. And Satan said, "You want chocolate with   that?" And Man said, "Yes!" and Woman said, "and as long as   you're at it, add some sprinkles." And they gained 10 pounds. And Satan   smiled.      And God created the healthful yogurt that Woman might keep the figure   that Man found so fair. And Satan brought forth white flour from the wheat, and sugar from the cane and combined them. And Woman went from size 6 to size 14.      So God said, "Try my fresh green salad." And Satan presented   Thousand-Island Dressing, buttery croutons and garlic toast on the side. And Man and Woman unfastened their belts following the repast.      God then said, "I have sent you heart healthy vegetables and olive   oil in which to cook them." And Satan brought forth deep fried fish and   chicken-fried steak so big it needed its own platter. And Man gained more weight and his cholesterol went through the roof.      God then created a light, fluffy white cake, named it "Angel Food Cake," and said, "It is good." Satan then created chocolate cake   and named it "Devil's Food."      God then brought forth running shoes so that His children might lose   those extra pounds. And Satan gave cable TV with a remote control so Man would not have to toil changing the channels. And Man and Woman laughed and cried before the flickering blue light and gained pounds.      Then God brought forth the potato, naturally low in fat and brimming   with nutrition. And Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy  center into chips and deep-fried them. And Man gained pounds.      God then gave lean beef so that Man might consume fewer calories and   still satisfy his appetite. And Satan created McDonald's and its 99-cent double cheeseburger. Then said, "You want fries with that?" And Man   replied, "Yes! And super size them!" And Satan said, "It is   good." And Man went into cardiac arrest.              God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.              Then Satan created HMOs.

20090310052416AAGNsFk	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Fans of the movie THE FOUNTAIN?	I'm mesmerised by this film ,and everytime I get a new idea about it.Would it be correct to think that the entire movie is actually a memory of a dying man??      Think about it is a story of a work of fiction that is written by a woman who has genuine fears of her death veiled by a kingdom on the verge of collapse.Anyway what is interesting is that all episodes seem to be interrupted memories of Tom in the future such we are told the movie by what he remembers rather than by what really occurs.So how are we to know that it is not a story of a continuous reincarnation of one man through many lives and only his last life is shown as his real existance while the rest are recollections beyond which he could not live.      In the part where he is stabbed by the priest and then in the future he exclaims with pain and then later he tells himself ...'Allright show me'...couldn't it be interpreted as a point at which he died in the past,but lingered on in memory as to what would have happened beyond that point??      In otherwords his journey through different lives is shown but cleverly narrated as a work of fiction in one,as a real existance in another and as a psychedellic existance of the mind or soul in the last.This would explain his caressing of the tree as a memory of him bathing his wife,her echoing words 'finish it' and basically the superimposition of him as the 'First father' instead of the Conquistador at the very end...      Besides his existance in a bubble with only memories of his life and dear wife make it seem more credible that he was a soul on a way to be reborn rather than an some 23 century astronaut ...      The ring he lost in one life and another and found in the end again seems to speak of his final acceptance of moving on and being 'reborn'.It is just a memory...At the very end when he rubs the snow off Izzie's grave he has the ring on but that is most likely her ring that he took off of her when she died.      Anyway all I know is this movie really is a Rubik's cube with mind boggling concepts.What do you think?      What is your view?
20090310044958AAQ8p2i	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	When did hip hop start to suck?	Hip hop and R&B had a time when it was effectively the voice of the oppressed. But as soon as serious money was made from it, the music industry, which likes to manipulate anything, started to screw with a good thing. I do like some hip hop, like K-OS, massive attack, kyprios, LowKey, delhi2dublin, or thievery corporation. I think most mainstream hip hop sucks, but when did this start? I think right around "ice ice baby", or "can't touch this", but it might be earlier.

20090310041849AAJJlEd	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	What do you think of the short story I wrote for year 10 English?	I slowly wake from another painful nights sleep. The dry leaves crunch underneath me as I gradually get up off the hard ground, shaded by the trees above. My eyes adjust to the light, I look around at the familiar surroundings. A long dry and dusty road with no cars, grassy paddocks with no cattle, everything is dry except the few tall gum trees. I sit back down on the hard ground, slowly pulling my old, worn boots on.      I follow a path lining an old barbwire fence. I walk in silence for a while until I reach a small creek. I kneel down by the gentle stream of water. I see a tired old man staring back, his dull lifeless face peering up at me. I cup my hands, dip them down and drink for a while before I get up again.      I make my way down that dusty road. It’s not long until I reach the near by country town. People stare at me but it’s no different to any other day, some nod hello acknowledging my presence, others ignore me, trying not to stare. I soon reach the wooden bench where I sit and spend my lonely days. Watching the people go by, wandering in and out of the small strip of shops.      Something catches my eye, standing out amongst the litter and scrap caught in the gutter. I can already see it’s a scratchy of some sort. Any other person would have seen it as just another piece of rubbish. I bend down to pick it up. It has already been scratched. Mustn’t be a winner, I take a closer look and to my astonishment I see that I have won $25,000. I’ve never won anything before. I quickly pocket it and make my way back along the dusty road.      I slept slightly better last night knowing I’d have a good day just because of a little piece of paper. I make my way back towards the town. I walk for a short distance before I arrive at the bench where I found my fortune. I keep walking, past the shops ‘til I reach the station. The city train is just pulling in. I get on the first carriage. The steady motion of the train lets me drift off into a light sleep. An hour goes by and I wake up three stops before mine.      The train grinds to a halt. I shuffle over towards the door. A mother grips onto her young daughter, who’s glancing up at me. I may be homeless but that doesn’t mean I’m any less of a genuine person. Busy people get off and on the train. I exit the station, walking down the noisy city streets. I pass a busy corner. A homeless man sits and stares blankly into the heards of people rushing by.       I come to the city a lot. It’s an interesting place to be, so different from the country, always loud and busy. I soon find myself outside of a tall grey building. I walk in. I feel the many eyes stare. I walk to the front desk, a neatly dresses lady sits behind it.   “Can I help you, Sir?” she asks   “Could you tell me where the Scratch ‘n’ Win Regional Office is?” I reply   “Thirty third floor, room 1509,” she answers   I wander over to where the elevators are. My stumpy, grubby finger presses the little arrow button. Bing! The left elevators doors open, I walk into the elevator. Everyone else decides to wait for another, they don’t want to be stuck with me. The doors start to shut before a man stops them with his hand. I see him eye my scratchy as he enters.   “Twenty five grand, that’s a lot. Do you know what your gonna do with that money?” he says enthusiastically    “Um, not quite sure yet,” I reply politely   “You could invest that you know, triple it,” he responds   You could say that I’m not good with managing money, I don’t have much of it and I hadn’t really thought of investing it.   “I’m good with that kind of stuff, business and all that,” he rambles on as I ponder his proposal      Two Weeks Later      Looking back now you might say I got greedy. That man in the elevator turned out to be a con artist.   I walk down the little trail to the creek to have a drink.   I found out it was a scam a couple of days later, unfortunately after he’d gotten his hands on my winnings. I managed to save myself $50. And the first thing I bought was a pair of new boots.   I look down into the water. An old man smiles back at me. He looks happy and comfortable with who he is. His familiar face reminds me of the joy of a simple life.      ? copyright 2009 under the author's name

I have written much more than this.      #1   I pointed my weapon towards his view,    My shiny revolver gripped tight.   I told the saddest story of a lonely sole,   Who just wanted to end the pain in the night.      #2   Will I ever amount to anything,   Am I another to be gone by the sound of a bang,   Is there anything in life set out for me,   Or is the writing on the wall not to be seen?      I no longer have this love for you,   I am sure it has ended for you, too.   My dreams have left you in the night,    Because if they hadn't, I would have to end my life.      #3   Ridin' across the west,   Just letting off the stress,   Can't get her off my mind.   But that doesn't matter,   And I won't get any sadder,   'Cause there's still many more roads to wind.      #4   Tell me that I am wrong,   That together we still belong,   That I will always have a place in your heart.      And forget about his lies,   It was just him in disguise,   Trying to tear us apart.      #5   Burn my life into flames,   I cannot compete, I have lost the game.   Leave my past buried in shame,   Because no one will be able to ease the pain.      I have maaaaaany many more poems of equal or greater importance.

Anyhow, I fixed the song using Windows Movie Maker but now I can't put it on a CD because it's in "movie format" How can i transfer it onto iTunes?

20090309160428AAUx6Yz	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Are you tired of Zach from AMC?	I'm so sick and tired of him. I never did like Zach, but now  htae him with a passion. He's so damn controlling and is always hurting Kendall and the people she loves. The thing that gets me the most about him is that no matter how many times he messes up or hurts Kendall everyone still acts like he's the good guy of the show and kendall acts like she loves him even more.      I don't see how people can even look at his face after he shot Josh, especially Erica. She should be the one out for vengeance after what he did to her son. I remember back in '06 she hated him and didn't want him near kendall. Now all of a sudden she's his #1 fan. I wish Zach was the one that died instead of Josh, Babe, and Greenlee.

20090227144939AAxBZ2x	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Question about a beginner piano/keyboard. Please?	Hello everyone!      I got an acoustic guitar as a Christmas present and I'm still a beginner. I've been listening and watching a lot of piano recently and I'm hooked. I really want to get into playing it. And I need some help!      I know that pianos can be pricey, so as a beginner, would you recommend a keyboard instead? And when I decide to, I could get an actual piano? And also, if I were to get a Keyboard, would it be much like a piano? Meaning sound, the way you play, etc.       Note, that I'm a complete beginner. The most I've ever done is mess around with my friend's old piano a long time ago. Also, does anyone have any suggestions of a good keyboard to buy? I've been looking around Guitar Center and this one looks pretty decent...   http://www.guitarcenter.com/Yamaha-YPG-5...       Any other suggestions? Thanks so much in advance, for I really want to get started. Also, my price range is pretty much $500 and below.        Thanks!

It appears in the part of that episode where Hayley's birth mother just overdosed and it's raining and stuff.   It's very difficult to here the words in it but I tried to get them as best I could.

20090227144333AA5V8po	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	The routine of monotonous lunches...?	There's these three construction workers, a Mexican, an Irishman, and a redneck, who are best buddies and every day the three of them sit on the same beam together and have their lunches. Every single day the three of them open their lunchboxes to find the same things- the Mexican has tacos, the Irishman has corned beef and potatoes, and the redneck has a bologna sandwich. Every day the same three things- tacos, corned beef, and a bologna sandwich. It never varies, and it gets to the point the three of them just can't take it anymore.       The Mexican swears, "Madre Dios! If I open this lunchbox tomorrow and there's tacos in here I will kill myself!" The Irishman is just as fed up. He says "I hear you, brother. If I open this lunchbox tomorrow and find corned beef, I swear to the Good Lord I'll jump off this building!" The redneck, not to be outdone, says, "Y'all are right! If I have a bologna sandwich in here tomorrow, sweet Jesus I will end it all." Well, the next day come lunch time they sit down and sure enough- tacos, corned beef, and a bologna sandwich. One after another they jump off the building to their untimely deaths below.       At the funeral the Mexican's widow is inconsolable. She says "I swear, if I knew how much he hated tacos I would have packed him something else! How will I go on now?!" The Irishman's widow is just as badly off, she collapses in the arms of the priest crying, "If only I knew he was so sick of corned beef- I would have made something else. How could this have happened?!" At this, all eyes to to the redneck's wife, who is sitting in a corner, fuming.       "Don't none of y'all look at me! That idiot husband o' mine made his own damn lunches!"

20090225090304AA3FeKL	Entertainment & Music;Music;R&B & Soul	Do compilations between rappers and singers help or hurt the two genres?	Like Nas feat. Amerie, T.I. feat. Justin Timberlake, Jamie Foxx feat. Kanye West, Mary J. Blige feat. Busta Rhymes, Eve feat. Keyshia Cole, Beyonce feat. Jay-Z, Black Eyed Peas feat. Nelly Furtado, Bow Wow feat. Ciara, Snoop Dogg feat. Mariah Carey. I hear a lot of how rap gets trashed for its anger directed toward humanity: killing men and using women. Just wondering if you think putting soulful singing in with the rap lyrics has softened some of the stereotypical sting of the reputation of the rap genre by adding a drop of ice from the R&B genre. Or if you feel women rappers (Queen Latifah, Foxy Brown) have helped add a better face to the genre because it is from a woman's perspective (even if the song is about sex or being hurt by some guy it is about the lady talking about being hurt and leaving the man instead of the man talking about hurting the woman and using her).

20090309163632AAjSsXT	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Now heres your joke of the day!!!?	A woman was in bed with her lover when she heard her husband opening the front door. "Hurry!" she said, "stand in the corner." She quickly rubbed baby oil all over him and then she dusted him with talcum powder. "Don't move until I tell you to," she whispered. "Just pretend you're a statue."      "What's this, honey?" the husband inquired as he entered the room.      "Oh, it's just a statue," she replied nonchalantly. "The Smiths bought one for their bedroom. I liked it so much, I got one for us too." No more was said about the statue, not even later that night when they went to sleep.      Around two in the morning the husband got out of bed, went to the kitchen and returned a while later with a sandwich and a glass of milk.      "Here," he said to the 'statue', "eat something. I stood like an idiot at the Smiths' for three days and nobody offered me as much as a glass of water."      lmao....

This is kind of what I had in mind:      CD 1:   Chattahoochee by Alan Jackson   Good Time by Alan Jackson   Redneck Yacht Club by Craig Morgan   I'm gonna miss her by Brad Paisley      and possibly All summer long by Kid Rock      And for the 2nd CD something like beach boys and jimmy buffet. I know they're not really mellow necessarily but if you get what I'm talkin about. Not necessarily really country, but not rap. Oh and like Bryan Adams' Summer of '69      Thanks y'all. ??

20090309172116AAu5iSp	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	R&P: Are Metalcore and Deathcore On The Verge of Extinction?	Sparked from a few comments I've been hearing, I've been wondering, do you as a listener really think that any band of these two genres sound exactly the same as every other band?      Personally, as a metalcore/deathcore fanatic I have to somewhat disagree. If everything sounded exactly the same I doubt I or anyone else would still be listening to it as well as discovering new bands. And then lets not forgot another important question, what sets bands apart from others in your opinion? For example, Sky Eats Airplane make use of synthesizers and electronics in addition to traditional metalcore sound.      I have composed a small shortlist comprising of three songs of the metal and deathcore persuasion. If you could, give them a listen (at least a minute and ten seconds) and then tell me if you think they sound more or less the same.      To avoid having someone answer my question only to say "Whats the question" or the even more popular "huh?" these are the questions:      Do you think bands of metal and deathcore sound exactly like all of the other respective core bands today?      What do you think sets a metal or deathcore band apart from their predecessors?      Give my list of songs a quick listen and tell me if you believe they sound the same in one way or another.      To be fair, I'm going to use bands that I haven't talked about very much or at all.      ~Metalcore~   A Late Night Serenade (Tight Like A Tiger)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyS_GHM_U...

One was all serious and we didn't know who threw Donatello up in the air, and that just seemed creepy and scary and more to lose like a for real battle!!! And then when I looked on youtube for the only trailer (liek what they'll show at the movies, not the tv spots) it's all cartoony music when Don gets thrown.      So anyway would you rather see a live (I would) i mean it might be kinda dated and not work now, but I'd like to see it. And I'd want Krang (cartoon version, though I know that won't happen b/c of the same reason why Bebop and Rocksteady didn't happen), scary Leatherhead, or the Triceratops dudes. as the villians. Actually loooking at the painting version of book 2 withthe mousers I could watch that to.

To enter, you must tell guards the "password" at the door. To learn the password, you have to pay. Jack wanted to try out the club (he didn't want to pay) so he hid behind a bush and waited...   A woman came. Jack heard the guard say "12". The woman paused, but then answered "6". The guard let her in.    A man came. The guard said "6", the man said "3". The guard let him in. At that point, Jack figured out it was a pattern, and he thought he knew what it was.    Jack lauged at how easy that pattern was. He walked up to the guard. The guard said "10."      What should Jack say? Why? What's the pattern?      *Hint: He said five. He got kicked out...*   Even if you get the right number, i will not choose it as best answer unless you tell me the pattern. Yes, I know the answer.

It was at a time a fun and entertaining show, but I guess I just don't get why the show is a rallying call?  I guess just because they were Lesbians make them role models.

20090309123443AALWwqm	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Insight into this horoscope transit interpretation for the day? please?	doesn't this sound scary?! anyone know if this is a strong influence or long lasting or just undertones for the day???      Square Moon Mars, orb: -1°23'      Thrills are on the agenda! Were you seeking intense emotions? There you are. Nevertheless, amid this idyllic climate, clear-sightedness remains indispensable. A glitch is all it takes to jeopardize your plans, a minor incident, the regrettable consequences of which develop as time goes by. Therefore, it is advisable to anticipate and to avoid traps right from the start. Hold back your impatience because feverishness may block the energies of the day. More than ever, self-control is indispensable. The natal planet involved in the transit is in your 5th House, the House of romantic matters, leisure, entertainment, children or creations (artistic ones or others). Therefore, it is likely that this period coincides with a modification of these areas.

20090309125439AA1hS3G	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Jabob (Taylor Lautner) from twilight gay? (Not intended for Taylor Lautner groupies!)?	Alot of girls cringe at the thought of Taylor Lautner being gay, so superfans will definitely say no and gay guys (even though he's 16, which someone over the age of 18 having a crush on him is pretty creepy) will say yes because they just hope he's gay so they'll get that chance in hell, dating a celebrity. But there is one thing that bugs the crap out of me about Taylor Lautner, even though he's becoming a "man", he comes off extremely eccentric, a bit flamboyant, overconfidence that can be confused for arrogance and he's very well groomed...to the point where he wears blush (even though "TomKat" Cruise admits to wearing it too)...So question is, is he very metrosexual and innocently young or is he not so innocent and closet-bound?...I mean, I'm bi and my girl thinks he's gay, I think he's just a sensitive 16 year old boy blinded and excited by the Hollywood lights...What do you think? And yo don't be iggnorant as hell when you answer this.

All I can remember of this video was that I think it was shown on Night Flight or Night Tracks but certainly not on MTV. The singer was sort of a portly fellow who seemed to talk on pitch rather than sing the song (I think). He had an upper class air about him and the only lyrics I can recall were the phrases "jet set" and something about "stopping to smell the roses". I've seen Ringo Starr's "Stop and Smell the Roses" and Wings "Jet" and those aren't it.

20090309124757AAmDsL1	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Noticed different cultural acceptance for public displays of affection and passionate kissing?	Is this too much Public display affection or just going with the culture?      So my girlfriend is Brazilian and we went to visit her home country of Brazil for the 1st time. She is not modest about public affection, but when we were in Brazil, it was on extra high overdrive! Everywhere we went we were passionately kissing.       Probably the most intense was when we were at the beach, even though there were lots of people around, she started laying on top of me and kissing passionately. I just went with it, and after a while i was instigating as much as she was, as we took turns laying on top of each other, making out like crazy, off and on for hours even though people were all around us! We would on in the water too and embrace and kiss passionately even as people swam around us, nobody seemed to care.       Probably the only time we weren't embracing was when she was doing underwater handstands, as were other people. She loves doing those too, can stay underwater water for a long time, with perfect form, but i digress..      Has anyone noticed some cultures being much more open heavy public affection, and even people doing underwater handstands?

20090309125159AAHeM3J	Entertainment & Music;Movies	The Watchmen: What's with the giant blue penis?	In the movie "The Watchmen", why does Dr. Manhattan spend most of the movie waving his blue penis in the audience's face? Seriously, I'm not a fanboy and I've never read the graphic novel, so I really don't have a clue and want an answer. Is there some underlying significance that is escaping me? Or was it to just satisfy the people with a blue penis fetish? Was he that way in the novel? Did they explain why? I thought the movie was great, and while this didn't detract from that, I really couldn't see anything it added. He wore a speedo in a couple scenes. Would that have not been just as impactful for all his other scenes (and if you haven't seen it yet, there are a ton of them)?      Enquiring minds want to know... What was the real meaning behind that blue penis waving in my face???

20090309131334AAVS53B	Entertainment & Music;Movies	I was just thinking of this small scene in some Disney movie, but I can't remember what movie it's from? HELP!?	This is what I remember: there's a mandolin/lute player at a feast, and he gets a taste of wine, but he isn't supposed to be drinking because he's playing! So he pours the wine into the hole in his instrument and keeps drinking from it, and eventually gets so drunk and passes out. Lol. Anyone know what I'm talking about? I can picture the scene and this man perfectly, but that's all I can remember. It's a cartoon movie, definitely old, I think it's Disney. I was thinking Sleeping Beauty? But that doesn't sound right - some movie like that, though. It's not a big part at all, the man isn't a main character, but the scene is funny! Can ANYONE tell me what movie it's from!?
20090309130332AADFtKy	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	How can I contact Rachel Riley?	I am trying to get in contact with Rachel Riley from Countdown.   My friend has started a comedy podcast, and I am a regular guest. He has several features, one of which is a podsong, in which he records a new original song each week. This week's was about his love of Rachel Riley. I want to try and get in touch in order that she can hear it and we could have a laugh about it.      My problem is that I don't know how to go about getting in contact. Surely it should be through her agent? Although would someone higher up at Channel 4 pass on something like this?      Any information on how I could go about this?
