mIj958p1aa	i've never had this problem when making easy mac. just make sure you stir it long enough so that the cheese powder dissolves.|`|VvbOSbRnaa	Nope, not just you. That is why I can't make it anymore!|`|AA11850523	I grew up Catholic and we were not allowed to eat meat on Fridays<br>  we would usually have mac and cheese and fish sticks at least once a month <br>  <br>  make sure you  thoroughly stir it and you wont have that problem|`|Ip6ecgtUaa	Im sorry but i guess it does happen every once in a while well i dont really care for mac and cheese so its not that hard for me just to not eat it so.|`|c13261f58d48f2f1acf21bbee37c0bbbaa	yes that is why i get the real cheese it cost more but you don't get the powder in the box you get the cheese pack|`|pueeMH6gaa	I really hate it when you look closely and see insect parts mixed in.  Talk about wanting to vomit...|`|AZwEYRXjaa	add some milk to it & it shouldn't do it! :D
tzrLDbHWaa	Yeah, he's a jerk, but a lot of times its warranted.  I mean, like tonight, one of the guys was wiping the sweat off his head with the same towel he used to wipe pans and stuff.  That's totally disgusting and he deserved to be screamed at.  <br>  <br>  Also, he's only a jerk to people when they f**k up.  When you think about it, these are people who are handling your food.  If someone f**ks up your food order you can either lose money for the company or worse yet, you can get someone very sick.  This is also his reputation on the line, so do you really blame him for getting mad when someone makes a bad mistake.|`|uu1IUxAkaa	Change the channel then. He will still get his fat paycheck. rather you watch or not.|`|AA11663627	Yeah, I've been watching this season because I'm an avid Top Chef watcher and people were telling me that Hells Kitchen was better. I've come to disagree with that opinion. I like Top Chef better because it's a show more about the food. Hells Kitchen is only entertaining if you like watching Gordon Ramsey humiliate people. I don't care for it, plus I think the contestants on the show lack a lot of skill compared to the people on Top Chef.|`|pueeMH6gaa	I started to watch it one time and then I said to myself, "what the....this is a show about a bunch of people cooking stuff." Then I immediately changed the channel.|`|ei0Wryytaa	i hate how mean he is to everyone|`|wqL84O8Naa	i saw him call some lady a stupid cow last night and i LMAO|`|rT7BDLpxaa	Gordon Ramsey is a jerk but unfortunately he's the typical manical chef you find in every good restaurant!!!  I've worked in a number of restaurants and have wittnessed this same type of harrassment.  A couple of times the former chef at a Hilton in DC not only yelled and intimidated the staff but also hit them.  For the most part, "top notch" chefs consider themselves God.  <br>  <br>  Incredible isn't it????|`|gwhutbkdaa	Yes, I agree with you.  He is ill-mannered.  Some of the people do give him a piece of their mind.  I would tell him to go to Hell and maybe throw something at him.|`|G0QugnQ8aa	yes I agree that he is a jerk and a horse's ***...used to watch the show until I got fed up with his idiotic, immature tantrums|`|cpuydZvNaa	i no he calls ever1 "you stupid pig"
8ZARrsnXaa	I use to live in Oxnard when I was 18 we would just use to go to the movies.  go bowling idk Thursdays are usually dead even in L.A lol
FZ80qm3Eaa	They have pretty much everything.  There's burgers, chicken, pasta, steak, seafood, etc.  And of course cheesecake.  Their cheesecake is absolutely amazing!  My favorite dish that I've tried is the shepherd's pie.|`|I2wPn0Zlaa	everything basically. anything from chicken, burgers, steak, pasta, seafood, etc. They have 50 diff kinds of cheesecake too! Delicious!|`|QNXKoN05aa	The only thing good there is their cheesecake.|`|BphZi9yDaa	their calamari is yummy! and of course their cheese cake....I've never been disappointed when eating there.|`|cc5247e67285d6d05c4063aafbd8e036aa	It's a great general menu.  Everything is wonderful.  They have a new entree called "Chicken Bellagio" - It is outstanding.  My husband and I both love it.|`|2yOXIkNQaa	everything and cheesecake!|`|CSFO8IIraa	realy yummy food, anything you could think of....salad, soups, sandwiches, etc.<br>  the site has the menu too, go online, and see it|`|YnNhr3eIaa	why dont you go on their website AND LOOK AT THE MENU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|VvbOSbRnaa	Everything!

NDJV0e3Zaa	only if there is also a restaurant, but once they stop serving food, you will be expected to leave within a reasonable amount of time. So get a good fake ID, or drink at home, (much cheaper!!!!)|`|5C7wKDcRaa	21 or over, hon.  Sorry.  They don't want to take any chances.  If they have a separate dining area, you'll be able to get in there, but expect to be carded and kept an eye on.
cxNLOPHNaa	I always see them in large bags, in the snack food aisles of my local Pavilions, Vons, Ralph's, Bristol Farms and Stater Bros supermarkets. I see individual snack size bags in Subway, and Togos. You might also check their website, to see if there are more locations.|`|EQcI4CnVaa	grocery stores or sandwich shops. i've seen them at ralphs or albertsons. Definitely at subway or mustard's deli.|`|5zNwBQZHaa	Just about anywhere that sells potato chips - it's not like they are special, they are made by Frito-Lay.|`|UjC2vaqLaa	you cant|`|AA10412922	Subways and other sandwich places have them

UFk0H0fRaa	I work at Outback Steakhouse on the East Coast, but we're doing a corporate thing at the moment. We rolled out a brand new menu- the biggest thing we've done since we opened 20 years ago. There are over 15 entree's under $14.95. I know the quality and service my restaurant gives... It'd be great for you to go out. We changed the menu for affordability and variety. The economy sucks right now- everyone's money is tight. Maybe a local Outback in CA would be an idea?<br>  <br>  I hope you both have a great night out, where ever you choose to eat!|`|AA10598843	What me and my honey do is go to a nice sushi restaurant usually. Like the poster above said, you have a lot of things to share between yourselves! And they're relatively low in price and the rolls fill you up with all the pieces.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to 1-up that a bit I'd say go to a tapas bar. Again, lots of small dishes! I went to my first tapas bar on VDay and it was really fun. Spanish food is really delicious! The place we went to had prices that were ridiculous, I was somewhat devastated, but he reminded me that the tapas place near him wasn't as expensive. It's a good thing too, because even though the price was steep at the place we went, everything was delicious! <br>  <br>  But seriously, look up some reviews on zagat on the places in your area. That or just on google. You could even ask some coworkers! There are nice restaurants within all price ranges. Good luck!|`|9tRZP9yaaa	Burger king|`|AA10535892	not sure about whats around you but how about something like a thai restaurant where you order a few dishes and place in the middle to share rather than " this is my plate, that is her plate" sometimes it is not about the restaurant it is about the things you do or how you eat.. basically sharing!<br>  try to do something together just the 2 of you at least once every couple of monthsafter all since you are married you should be enjoying each others company.<br>  <br>  have a great night, bon appitit !
v2Afl0Jpaa	They got one of the dumbest advertisements going on including Jack. It's to get more people to notice Jack in the Box. They have never had a serious subject like a coma or a vehicle accident involving a stupid mascot. There for the advertisement is working. More people talking a out it their for more money|`|sidUEhbjaa	They have a commercial where he gets hit by a truck.|`|pueeMH6gaa	He had some jack in the box tacos and went into a coma and choked on his own vomit.  Fortunately, they don't expect him to survive.|`|5C7wKDcRaa	Got hit by a bus and is in a coma.  See the link for more details
a9wRfuuSaa	I have eaten at both the Bellagio and Wynn buffets. I have only gone on their "gourmet" nights, which are rather pricey (about $35/person) but I think they worth that price. They serve the type of food you normally wouldn't see at a buffet or that you might not want to try if you go to a really nice restaurant, but that you will probably be more willing to try on a buffet. I have seen and tried sushi, ceviche, steak tartare, kobe beef, beef wellington, crab legs and many other things that I normally wouldn't get or pay for at a sit down restaurant - and was rather impressed by them. <br>  <br>  If you want to splurge a little and try something a little different then I would definitely recommend trying either buffet. I prefer the Bellagio over the Wynn, but they are equally as good.<br>  <br>  If you enjoy a lot of seafood, then I would also recommend the Seafood Buffet over at the Rio. I think it is also in the $35 range, but it usually gets rave reviews.|`|wqL84O8Naa	The Rio has the largest and BEST buffet....<br>  <br>  the bellegio's is lame and overpriced, haven't eaten at WYnn|`|0woVBgkpaa	There is this pretty old casino named Suncoast. It is pretty good and lots of the locals go there.  There is a buffet there that's pretty cheap. And it's REALLY good. I go there all the time when I'm in Vegas.|`|ITbe6Ykjaa	Bellagio is good but a little expensive. Never been to the Wynn. Paris has a good buffet too.|`|3TQCwtxJaa	I have never been to the Wynn's buffet but ate at the Bellagio a few years ago and really enjoyed it. I thought it was worth the money.|`|wn1KKbXQaa	I've been to the Wynn which was quite good, but my personal favorite is the Paris buffet.

Best restaurant where, in China , US, India or ?<br>  <br>  Always find your best restaurant at the BEST Place in town or hotel. They should be well known for their food.  For me, my best restaurant for best food & variety is our Food Centre or Food Court with 50-100 stores for your taste like Indian, Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Korean, Viet, Indonesian, Italian, Spanish, etc.....etc.   All are best in taste not set-up..

All you have to do is go to their W E B S I T E.   It's, like Starbucks.com, and click on store locations, to be sure.<br>  <br>  There's a HUGE one across the street from the Cathedral in Sevilla, Spain, though I can't for the LIFE of me figure out how they can make it in such countries, where the coffee is ALREADY a hundred times better than what they produce!   People must just be jonesing for some mediocre frappuccinos.|`|AA10598843	I agree with Jane.|`|hO7EaK3Uaa	<a href="http://www.starbucks.fr/en/store_locator.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.starbucks.fr/en/store_locator...</a><br>  There are lots of Starbucks in Paris and other locations.

zNm5OHjAaa	I can beat that...<br>  <br>  I was so busy trying to get a look at a good looking girl, i DID THE SPLITS unintentionally in the middle of Buchanan St!!<br>  <br>  I was walking along, trying to ogle, and slipped on the smooth tiles that surround the subway entrance.<br>  <br>  I was wearing Rupert The Bear style red tartan trousers, so I stuck out like a sore thumb.  My front foot slipped, while by back one stayed in place..I did the splits and believe me, that was the first time in my life i ever managed it and it hurt like hell.<br>  <br>  To make matters worse the girl i was looking at actually stopped and asked if i was ok.  I was so embarrassed I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me.<br>  <br>  I was acting like an idiot, not looking where I was going, dodging in and out of foot traffic, so really I deserved everything I got.<br>  <br>  You, were just out to get coffee.  You have absolutely nothing to be embarrassed about.  You should keep going back.<br>  <br>  To be honest, if you're that worrried about it, then can you live with the thought of the staff knowing (and they will if you've been a regular) that you've now stopped going in there just because you fell???<br>  <br>  If you're serous about not going in just cos your embarrassed, then i suggest giving it one last try just to see how (if at all) people react.  IF they laff, then cool...it was your last trip in there anyway.  If they're nice about it, then you haven't lost a chance to get good coffee fist thing in the morning.|`|cTszXzPjaa	You fool!!! Why do you care what other people think of you? <br>  <br>  Thats society for you.  I like to think of myself as going through life not caring what other people think of me. Go on in to starbucks and hold your head up high (though watch the floor!)<br>  <br>  Balls to what other people think. F*** them.  and if they dont like it, double F*** them|`|XOuMNiVpaa	i feel once at the food court in the mall. i mean classic slapstick...feet and hands in air while my McD sundae flew out my hands. ( i worked at the McD)  you should have filed a report and sued their asses if there was no sign.  damn how petty these other people think it maybe..too late tho. keep enjoying your $10 coffee|`|2MyUret5aa	Well at least you weren't hurt. I slipped and fell and broke my knee cap in 2 places. and I have barely ever been back to that gas station. <br>  <br>  I would just maybe stay out of their until next week and then go back. <br>  <br>  Where every dog could always us a new dog toys:<br>  <br>  www.awesomedogtoysandmore.com|`|Xk8PNjbwaa	The starbucks staff should feel like the silly ones for leaving the floor wet and not drying it, if there wasnt a slipping hazard sign you could sue them.|`|FsXTyGH9aa	honestly go back in there...you shouldnt think much of it..dont be embarresed..imagine if someone else slipped..you wouldnt think they were an idiot you would hope that they are ok and then forget about it|`|ZWsCHjIKaa	your not foolish for sliping! the staff should have asked if you were ok... id go back and say somthing to the manager..|`|zjFMdPOiaa	How RUDE of the people around you to not assist you or even ask if you were OK.  <br>  <br>  It is the other people that were there that should be embarrassed and also ashamed of themselves for not coming to your aid.  Shame on all of them!!!<br>  <br>  Go back with your head held high knowing that you did nothing wrong.  Enjoy your daily cup of coffee and remember if you ever see anyone else take a tumble, be sure to lend a hand.  <br>  <br>  (It will happen to all of us at some time.  I hope that you are OK.)|`|zzkmdusEaa	Haha, it's okay to feel embarassed.<br>  <br>  It could have happened to anybody. Imagine how you are going to look if you DON'T show up there again. At least if you show up again you get your morning coffee like always and won't look like a coward. Again, i'm sure everybody has had this happen to them at one point in their life. Maybe a few people laughed and maybe a few people just hoped you were okay, but you will be able to look back at it a week or so from now and laugh about the whole matter.<br>  <br>  Keep going in for your morning coffee. I can almost guarantee you that the they forgot about it, or don't really even see a big deal about it. It isn't like your going to walk in there one day with signs all over the building with your picture on them saying "This person fell down LOL.".  When you walk in, the people  there won't be like "Look! That guy fell down yesterday!". You know what I would say if someone said that to me? I would say "Who cares? I don't know you.".<br>  <br>  Don't worry, nothing to stress about it. Everybody makes idiots of themselves every once in awhile.|`|QqXpkatHaa	If someone had actually approached you enquiring of your health, would you have felt less daft? The reason why I ask is that the same thing happened to me in a pub a few weeks ago - but a couple helped me to my feet, with the hubby offering to buy me another scotch (wasn't drunk - just tripped on a worn bit of carpet). Can understand your wariness - re-entering the Starbucks, wondering if some of the gawpers are there, staring at you with grins, remembering the day before. If they didn't bother to help me, I would have made my decision to go elsewhere - with a more secure pair of footwear next time.|`|AA11866748	don't worry about it, I agree just keep going back like nothing happend...I work at a retail office and you should see how many people come in here and do weird things, by the time they walk out the door I forget about it, I don't sit and think about it or anything, and they should feel like idoits for not asking if your okay, or helping you up...don't worry about it...just keep going like u would normally...and get your coffee.|`|eqAIXM0Kaa	Suing people for something stupid like that is not the answer. In todays world, people sue restaurants because the obviously hot coffee burnt them when they spilt it. Dont stoop to their level. Don't feel embarrased about falling. Its really no big deal. Im sure noone will remember that you fell. Do YOU remember the face of anyone that embarrassed themselves around you? Most likely not.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	There is really no need for you to feel foolish. You didn't do anything wrong! You slipped by accident and I'm sure although it was very embarrassing at the time no one will even remember you. Please don't let this put you off going back for your morning coffee. Why should you go without? Let us know how you get on and good luck!

Om9CFRpsaa	Yes, absolutely. However,sometimes, restaurants are stricter than bars. Therefore, they can choose to not to serve someone. It's not fair but they have the right to refuse to service.You are still correct that you are allowed to drink.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Yes :) The DC are IS Maryland and one of the US states and therefore you can be 21,just like anywhere else in the US, to drink. I can't believe you asked.|`|UISdsVNJaa	The restaurant got it wrong! You are allowed to drink on your birthday, you are considered to be 21. Technically you could have went out to a bar on the 23rd and not drink until the clock turns midnight when you could go back to the front counter and reshow your id and you would then be allowed to drink.|`|AaXl3vcCaa	he was wrong, in my law class they said legally you turn an age at midnight the night before your birthday not after, which makes sense, but ya he was wrong|`|VFVdrDBQaa	Legally yes.

Fire & Stone - unusual Pizza  http://trustedplaces.com/review/uk/londo...|`|tjNJAn75aa	Covent Garden-Carluccio's (italian) is great    http://www.carluccios.com/    Or in Leicester Square I like Chiquitos (mexican) http://www.chiquito.co.uk/    Or on the corner of leicester square is a nice little italian but I cant remember the name of it.|`|llOBZOQ8aa	don't go to the one near the buskers outside with the tall metal heaters if you only want a drink. i'm not all together sure what the food's like but you can't just get a drink there.  sorry, don't know much more, live in cardiff:)|`|cb73df5e9792cfbcdfe41a093110ec5eaa	mate      check this place out;  guarantee you will love it......    http://www.toptable.co.uk/venues/restaur...|`|Yfp74Xqtaa	Went to Tamarai a couple of weeks ago - it was great! Strikes me more as an evening venue but if you're up for, as they say, food from the Lotus trail, ie SE Asian with some East and maybe a bit of South Asian food, you won't go wrong.  They were having a half off deal when I went and it was definately a bargain. - http://www.toptable.co.uk/venues/restaur...

rtuunGMSaa	Absolutely! <br>  It sounds like this is within walking distance. That's awesome. No commute time, no extra money needed for gas. And, yeah, Free Food. <br>  <br>  McDonalds is the perfect starter job. Don't be put off by the other comments about nasty people. EVERY job has nasty people. THis will be a good experience to learn how to deal with those kind of people. <br>  Good Luck.|`|xhSsby6Taa	i'm pretty sure they do drug test, most respectable places do. i worked at mcdonalds in high school and it was alright as long as you don't mind smelling like a giant french fry. it was actually fun at times because a lot of other kids worked there. if they are actually hiring, go for it. it's kind of hard to find a job in this present economy.|`|AaXl3vcCaa	ya, it was my first job when i was 15! it is not fun or anything and yes people will be rude to you but you make decent money, free/ discounted food and it helps build responsibility to prepare for a career|`|v2Pab3pgaa	Yep - the best starter job ever! Many great ones have served up Big Macs at one time or another! Good Luck!|`|BfKKNqo3aa	when you start out its all about getting the money and building up a CV/resume. personally i hate McDonald's but i would work there if i wanted the cash. i wouldn't say its a great job but its a start and so long as when you stop working there its because i wanted to and didn't get fired or something then having worked there should help you get your next better job.|`|5M0FBU89aa	Sure-<br>  It's not like you're getting married to the place.<br>  <br>  You can always move up at MD or you can get another job - it beats doing nothing.|`|xl5uQj3daa	heck yeah free food!|`|yGu5gdGaaa	Yeah I work there now (i'm 16), and it's not as bad as people make it out to be. Expect rude customers, and get used to being treated like sh** all the time. But other than that, it's OK.|`|u4liwDhAaa	There is nothing wrong with your first job being at McDonald's.  The location for you would be great (you'd be saving money on gas, etc).  Go for it!|`|qxteTM9Kaa	Sure!|`|m936qdlDaa	yea
