20090222152242AAxc60U	Travel;Other - Destinations	Can you help me salvage my gap year?	I'm about halfway through my gap year now and it's all gone disastrously wrong. I worked part time during the summer and ended up staying there until Christmas whilst I was looking for something else (though I didn't earn all that much - it was minimum wage and I had other outgoings).      In January, I went to au pair for a family in Spain, with the intention of being there til the end of June. However, the family were awful so I've had to come home to the UK.      Now, I don't know what to do. I'm starting university in September and I'll be doing French, Spanish and Linguistics. Because of that, I want to do do something to improve my language skills (I'd planned to save money from au pairing to spend some of my summer in France)      As it is, I can't afford to just go back to Spain unless I have an income whilst I'm there. Nobody wants to give me a job here because I've got really good grades and it's clear I'm not going to stay in a dead-end job. My French and Spanish are going backwards...I desperately need to use them more.      I really don't know what to do and I don't want this gap year to be a waste. Please help, any suggestions welcome!      Thanks in advance   xxx

20090222153652AACsKG0	Travel;Africa & Middle East;South Africa	Misunderstandings about apartheid?	I lived in SA until I was about 12 years old (till 1996). It didn't seem to be a violent place where I lived (although the country was supposedly in an uproar). Here's my question: The world seems to think that apartheid was a simple matter of Afrikaners dominating blacks because they derived a sick joy out of it. And I think part of the justification for apartheid was simple racism. But I've come to the conclusion that Afrikaners actually believed their culture faced extinction if they did not take drastic measures to protect it. And furthermore, I think it was about culture as much as it was about race... to the point that if you had money you were viewed as white (contrast the treatment of Japanese and Chinese people in apartheid SA). There was even a commission that decided whether you were white or black based on, among other things, your habits and the "way you carried yourself." This is especially relevant to the Israel-Palestine conflict where people seem to now argue that it's OK to discriminate as long as it's not based on skin color. Jewish South African authors have written whole books trying to clear the majority of Jews living under apartheid from the accusations leveled at them. But then prominent Jewish anti-apartheid activists (meaning not Jews who were trying to make other Jews feel better) in SA denied that they were given support by the Jewish community for protesting apartheid and wrote "Declaration of conscience on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by South Africans of Jewish descent." But I digress. So, was it only about racial domination, or about protecting cultural identity as well? If it was only racism, what are the psychological/political reasons for this racism? Do you believe that as an Afrikaner I am an evil person? Even when you hear I voted for Obama, I recycle, I return my library books on time, I'm pro civil-rights.. etc.? I've come to believe that a lot of **** I get from people is because they view me as an Afrikaner and not as an individual... I don't fit the Afrikaner mold anyway.

20090222110207AAjK40y	Travel;United Kingdom;Other - United Kingdom	Am I still British? I'm confused!?	Okay, so my parents are from Cameroon. They became British citizens so my sister and I were british citizens when we were born in England. (Cause apparently past 1979, you have to be a citizen for it to count that your child was british if they were born there. So if my parents were still cameroonians, we wouldn't be British) And then now we move to America, and my parents become American citizens. So.. am I still British? Or Am I now Cameroonian American? Or am I all three? Cause I thought nationality was where you were born.. and citizenship can be changed.So if thats true I'd be British of Cameroonian descent of American citizenship? If thats not true, am I in any way British now?       Like if nationalities can be changed.. like if I moved to japan and became a citizen I'd be "Japanese"? Idk why but that sounds weird.

20090222155543AAyCeZY	Travel;Air Travel	E tickets & international flight connection question?	I'm interested in buying rather cheap E tickets from China airlines that goes from my location to Taiwan and then to Singapore.      I have a few concerns though, and I hope someone can answer me with. I'm not taking any luggage with me, just a carry on.      Well first off, I've never used e tickets, but I heard they're more convenient, and all you need is your credit card or ID, and you can even skip through checking/check in by checking in online. But here's my question: Don't you still have to go through check in, in order to obtain boarding passes, wouldn't you have to go through check in anyway?      My next question, is after the whole check in procedure, do you have to check in at the connecting airport if you're only bringing a carry on?       Or are you given boarding passes from your start so the moment you've arrived at your connecting airport, you can just find your gate and wait to go?
