Sometimes he feels like a nut ,sometimes he doesn't....<br>   I think the need for partnership with one person ,who shares all with you , who deeply loves you beyond just words, who is that one person who  accepts you with all your faults.  Who whispers just the right words ,and answers your personal love story.  I think that need to not be alone, overrode the anything else and the one for one became the norm, as polygamy fell by the way side.<br>  Polygamy did have its advantages, it helped with that variety need that most men have and it gave the wives help with the day to day chores but that emotional need to belong is much stronger.|`|AA10641825	What changed is that Jesus decided enough is enough.<br>  <br>  But I think maybe Jesus went too far the other way, when he started discussing Holy Castration and stuff like that.<br>  Matthew 19:12<br>  .|`|JkS5JHtWaa	The best thing to do is take that old book of contradictions that is was supposedly written by a perfect god and toss it into the nearest fireplace.

GJS3hTK5aa	Whenever you feel uncomfortable, it means either your body or mind is upset. If it is due to a physical reason, you can find a solution yourself. If you feel lazy or weak, you must start doing some exercise. If your mind is upset, still you will feel uncomfortable. The reason is, your mind is unclean. Check what is bad in your mind and remove it. It can be anger, impatience, jealousy, greed, lust etc. Remove whatever it is and simply fill the vacuum with love. Let your mind be filled with love for your fellow beings and for God; you will feel good.|`|dYQUQGflaa	Most feel uncomfortable at some point, it's not God's fault.

A1yHDCwxaa	Religion is, at it's heart, about dominion (forceful or peaceful). Christians, mostly, engage in peaceful domination these days in the Western world. In Nigeria and surrounding countries still, though, Christians constantly raid Muslim villages. Which brings me to Muslims, who try both means. Some advocate peaceful dominion, while others kill infidels. The same is true of all large religions. They want all the members, because they want control of government, and often times, they think they are right in it. <br>  <br>  This basically means that if there is a chance of eradicating Muslims, Christians will be all over it, and vice-versa. <br>  <br>  Religion seeks to dominate.|`|wTmNCQhcaa	Because religion isn't necessarily peaceful. It modern times people don't like war, so religion has come to reflect the more popular views of society. Religion is merely an extension of mankind.

ridu0Rtwaa	There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!<br>  <br>  He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?<br>  <br>  Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!<br>   <br>  Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!<br>  <br>  At best he was an amalgam of those others!!<br>  <br>  <br>  The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!   He also organized Christianity into the Holly Roman Catholic Church!!  Not in Israel or any of the countries of supposed origin but entirely Italian!!<br>  <br>  Not one word of it is contemporary with the period and was not written until many years after the period the story is set in!!<br>  <br>  What a wonder full disinformation and deception campaign he waged against his Christian enemies - so good in fact that Christians are still following the deception to this day!!!|`|AA10641825	God likes horses.

Also, they have been written by people who have had actual experiences with God. God has actually proven himself to the compiler of the vedas.<br>  <br>  This is a subjective thing, but it does happen. God can prove himself to you. I know Monks who say that God has proven Himself to them. <br>  <br>  I have a way we can test whether or not God exists.<br>  <br>  Atheists always have the same arguement against God - They say there is no proof for God, therefore they do not believe in him. But they have no proof otherwise. How can they accept God's nonexistence without proof? But they cannot accept His existence without proof?<br>  <br>  <br>  Thankfully, there is a test, an experiment we can do to test for God.<br>  <br>  The Vedas claim that if we do certain things (there is a long list of rules and processes to follow), then we will come to understand God.<br>  <br>  We should experiment by following the Vedas instructions for "Understanding" God. We should treat this as a proper experiment and 100% follow the vedas rules. If we only half follow the vedas, or if we decide to miss some of the points, then we are not doing the experiment properly. <br>  <br>  If we treat this as a real experiment, we must follow it exactly. ie. The Vedas say, if you do a, b, c, d, & e, then you will come to understand God, so to do the experiment properly, we must do every piece as described in the Veda.<br>  <br>  So the VEDIC theory is: Follow the Vedas instructions, and you will come to understand God.<br>  <br>  So we must follow the Vedas, and see if its true that we come to understand God.|`|gTS6xTO4aa	there isnt an answer<br>  <br>  because there is no definitive evidence that there is no God<br>  <br>  just as there is also no definitive evidence that God does is exist..|`|fM7yNf8oaa	Tell him he's the one making an extreme claim that something exists and that the burden of proof is on him.|`|8GW80mf1aa	Give them a mountain of evidence.|`|MD1nwIW7aa	Prove to me there is a God|`|CLB32006aa	You could ask him to prove that unicorns don't exist.

His final prayer was one which allowed him to bring down the false gods temple in which he was tied to the pillars of. <br>  It was a final statement that he wanted to stand up for the Lord! In doing this he revealed he was willing to die in the process.<br>  <br>  He was a great leader of his day, a judge and chosen by God before any King of Israel had the throne. He was used as a tool yes. We are all tools , some of us are chosen for great missions, some of us very simple ones.

joEsxwP7aa	I don't know for certain, but I can give some pretty simple explanations:<br>  <br>  1. He wanted to stay away from temptation.<br>  Obviously He faced temptation as much as any other human - He was fully man. But because He was also fully God, he never succumbed to these temptations. However, simply staying away from the temptation to lust would have been appropriate.<br>  <br>  2. The bible says that men are supposed to take the teaching roles in a Church, and so Jesus certainly would have encouraged them to take these roles, and taught them what he could. (This is not saying women are lesser than men - they both have their particular roles.)<br>  <br>  3. He didn't "not want" women around. And frankly, I know some guys who are constantly hanging around with girls, and this makes me more suspicious than guys who stick together more.<br>  <br>  I'm no theological or biblical genius, but I do know that Jesus was not homosexual - how could he have condemned homosexuality (not the people who are homosexual) and have been one himself? This would totally have contradicted all he taught and encouraged.<br>  Hope that helped somewhat. :)|`|jKiCcz20aa	Good links ! thanks<br>  <br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:9<br>  Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders<br>  <br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:13<br>  "Food for the stomach and the stomach for food"—but God will destroy them both. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.<br>  <br>  <br>  . Your questions absurd.|`|PgWkqjeZaa	1) I think Paul in Romans 1 gives a pretty convincing argument for the fact that Christ, being partly man while partly God, could not in fact be gay as this would invalidate his claim to being sinless. <br>  <br>  Romans 1:<br>   27In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.<br>  <br>  So, logic goes:<br>  <br>  Homosexuality = sin, Christ = sinless, therefore, Christ <> homsexual<br>  <br>  If you want to examine Christ's claims to being sinless, well, that's a lot longer conversation...<br>  <br>  2) As far as women went, he acutally spent a lot of time with them. If you read the narratives in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, Jesus spends time talking with anyone in the vincinity. However, in the divine order, God did create Adam, and then Eve, but gave Adam the authority. This echoes through the rest of the books as the relationship model for the church, marriage, and even instruction in the word. <br>  <br>  Grace and peace to you!<br>   - Isaac|`|asb7PCZeaa	It was highly unusual for a 30-something yo man to be unmarried in those times.  Plus he Loved his 12 bachelor friends and they Loved him back.  In the bible, it states one man laid his head upon Jesus's lap whilst he wore only undergarments.  I believe this is an example of the same type of love that exists between Priest and Altar Boy.<br>  <br>  Never, ever, does the bible state that Jesus had intimacy with any woman, however, he was intimate with many men.|`|rIvp1BToaa	in that culture  women  would  not have been able  to travel alone  and would  hardly have been listened  to that was why  all his  apostles  had to   be male.  he  was  not  gay  or sexual  while on earth  as he  is God and knew  his  purpose  here was to die.|`|jyEE16yPaa	All of my close friends are male because they are rational - Im not gay.

Jesus gave the Greatest Honour that could be given to a woman, by his birth which had nothing to do with a man. <br>  <br>  Women are treated better in the Kingdoms of the Christians then in any other system...And there is a snare in the Bible when Paul wrote that women shouldn't speak in a church, but in another scripture he wrote that there is neither male nor female but we are all one in Christ and if you do not know that superceding scripture then you get snared by the lesser script. Remember Jesus taught us how to overcome the lesser scriptures with the ones that supercede them when he was tempted by Satan in the wilderness after being there for 40 days. Every time Satan would use a scripture Jesus would use the superceding scripture. Hope this answered your questions...<br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus had no reason even to think about marriage either whereas he had to be sterile from such an unusual birth, just as mules are sterile...His mission was to be sinless and to Preach the Word, and the Best Example of One recently to do a very good Job of this and rejecting the waste of time that a marriage would cause was Mother Teresa and her work to help the poor and hurting people which she thought to be a greater reward then to bare children with one husband, and the many thousands that have lived as Monks as Jesus did...<br>  <br>  <br>  Mary was praised far above the Apostles by Jesus when he said she has washed his body with tears and with love, while the Apostles were admonished for who would be best, blah..., and she also was the first to see Jesus raised from the dead.|`|AA10641825	He had a girlfriend name of Milly.|`|hiCSVwchaa	The long hair, the flowing robes... totally gay.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Jewish law prohibited women from participating in the religion, even though they ruled in the home.

I think it depends on what you do and how you live your life as opposed to going around making yourself sound good.  How many of these people are telling others how to live and then not doing it themselves?  <br>  If your religion isn't giving you the comfort and support that you would like, have you considered researching other religions?  There are a great majority out there to choose from and maybe you could find something that gives you more comfort.  I'm not trying to tell you that you have to do that, it's just a suggestion.  <br>  Don't worry about looking at porn.  Lots of people do it and personally, I don't think it's that big of a deal (of course, I am a photographer for a porn company, so I may be a bit biased.)  <br>  If you really want to be able to talk about your beliefs and sound better, do some research on your religion and practice what you want to say.  Be prepared for questions and debates and try to figure out the best way to calmly explain what you believe and why.  Don't get frustrated if someone doesn't agree with you and know when to be quiet if they don't want to listen.  If you try to force your beliefs on someone who doesn't want to hear it, it will only push them farther away.  (I'm not saying that's what you do, but it's just a reminder.)  Anyway, I hope this helps and try to not beat yourself up, honey.  You're not a joke.  Blessed be.|`|yDgxAHO9aa	hahaha, I like the porn part. Let me tell you something, just because people give answers doesn't mean they practice them or that they are wise. I could give sermons about a vast majority of topics, and I would sound insanely wise, but doesn't mean I do what I say. Not being a hypocrite, but I just tell myself, even if I don't do it, maybe someone listening to me could put it into better use.<br>  <br>  And yes YOU CAN ruin your chances at salvation. Most important thing is faith, which is why the bible says that faith is extremely important, and at times it even says don't worry about acts, just have faith (which is by the way was said to gentiles who had no idea about Jesus, but the apostles wanted to relieve them by just getting them started at having faith), but it also says that faith without works is nothing.<br>  <br>  quick example: my dad buys me a car, I did nothing to earn that car, my dad just bought if for me. But if I don't fuel that car, make oil changes, and fix that check engine light, the car won't work and I'd loose it.<br>  <br>  So by faith you're automatically given salvation, but you could lose it by not protecting it, as by watching porn, lol (no it probably takes more than that, but remember God will never ask you why you sinned, but he will ask you why didn't you stop). As some put it, it's not faith vs works, it's faith that works<br>  <br>  some verses about works:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  revelation 3:8 I know your works (behold, I have left an open door 6 before you, which no one can close). You have limited strength, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name<br>  <br>   James 1:22-24 Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. 23Anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror 24and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like.<br>  <br>  James 2:19-26 You foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless[a]? 21Was not our ancestor Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar? 22You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete by what he did. 23And the scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,"[b] and he was called God's friend. 24You see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone.<br>  <br>   25In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction? 26As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.<br>  <br>  Did I sound wise enough, I'm not|`|MdyHKQRGaa	The good news is you can always stop being a joke - that is, if you really think you are one.|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	The Bible does warn us about the danger of endlessly ignoring God and leaving Him out of our lives: "A man who remains stiff-necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed—without remedy" (Proverbs 29:1). These are solemn words and you should take them very seriously.<br>  <br>  But the fact that you are concerned about your spiritual situation tells me there's still hope for you. The person in the most danger spiritually is the one who feels no need of God, and is unconcerned about his or her spiritual condition. That person's heart has become so callused and so hardened that they can no longer hear God's voice convicting them of their sin and calling them to repent and turn to Christ.<br>  <br>  The most important thing I can tell you, however, is that God loves us and is ready to forgive anyone who truly repents and trusts Christ as their Lord and Savior. No matter what you've done, God still loves you and wants you to be part of His family forever. Jesus' words are for you: "My Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life" (John 6:40).<br>  <br>  Don't stay on your present road any longer; it will never give you the happiness and peace you seek. Instead, by a simple prayer of faith confess your sins to God and ask Christ to come into your life. Your life can be different—beginning today.<br>  <br>  David<br>  believer_in_jesus37421@yahoo.com|`|e6t9FPUdaa	You will have better answers as your faith matures. And salvation is not a one-time event in your life, but, according to the Bible, is a process that happens throughout a lifetime. And you will let God down, it is called sin. We all sin. I am not telling you not to worry about it, but what you need to do is confess your sins and find the forgiveness that God will grant you. Have faith and the rest will follow.

With the adoption of its constitution in 1956, Pakistan became an Islamic republic. In 1971, a civil war in East Pakistan resulted in the independence of Bangladesh.India and Pakistan has a very diverse mixed population consisting of ALL shades of Indian peoples.Their caste systems tend to favor lighter over darker skin.Being very mixed, you would have to compare heritages if you want to form such a biased opinion since they were all India at one time-exactly like the US during the Civil War-North and South. <br>  <br>  Your question would be like asking how the girls in the US during the Civil War, from the North look different from the girls in the South?

The Holy Spirit cannot live in their hearts due to this sin, and the only spirit that can enter such a heart is an evil spirit.<br>  <br>  Today we have two gospels. One of them prevails in most churches today, and this one the devil has contaminated with his lies. Hence the state of the Christian Church, full of sinners.<br>  <br>  But the true genuine gospel contains the righteousness of God, and when people discover this true original gospel everything changes, and then only will they become holy saints of God.<br>  <br>  This is why Jesus said, 'Many are on the broad way that leads to death, but narrow is the way that leads to life, but few find it.'<br>  <br>  Check my Avatar|`|836c6e132fae41eb80ae1909882962c3aa	andrea_g...Let me see if I can give you an answer that will...fit the bill.<br>  <br>  Every single time I have come here and asked a question concerning people that follow Jesus Christ, there is always too many people that prefer to scoff and become blasphemous of my Lord.  I have no problem with "Debate" or even someone that "does not know" what I'm talking about.  For the most part, many have responded kindly and have added their opinions intelligently.  With some I have not agreed and lately the arrogant ones have taken to being overtly blasphemous.<br>  <br>  SO do I get anry at times......???  You bet I do, I'm human, just like you and everyone else here.  You want to call me a "Fundie" because I beleive the Bible, because I follow Jesus Christ.  Is that the RIGHT thing to do???<br>  <br>  I have no idea of where you live or who you hang out with or what is going on where ever you are, but your generalizing.  If you so choose NOT to follow Jesus Christ in your life......FINE!!  Why is it so offensive to you, if I choose otherwise???<br>  <br>  Not all "Fundimentalist Christians" are saved.  Not all of them are nice people either, just because they know a few verses, does not make them "Born Again Christians".<br>  <br>  Here is what I try and do.  I will abide by the rules of fair play, when fair play is afforded and observed, adhered to.  If on the other hand, you decide to be arrogant, I'll blow you off and say so and why.  If you become "Blasphemous to my Lord" I will then defend Him.  Simple as that.|`|G9gm4nnEaa	Who says they're really Christians?  The fruits of the spirit (basically, the different characteristics represented in the life of someone who is truly applying their 'faith' to their lives) are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control.  Tell me how many of those are missing from a fundamentalist.  Now tell me, do they really look like they fit the bill of a Christian?  Didn't think so.|`|SI46bZ8vaa	because they're not following true christianity|`|VEDZrnpcaa	the god squad are hypocrites.|`|wbVd38d2aa	I have no answer, but I totally agree with you.|`|94618fa9aff7c44a9bbefcc52d8a7de7aa	You think we fundamentals are bad? Try the self righteous politically correct!!! Now that is a nighmare to be afraid of.<br>  I'm a fundamentalist, I'm happy, I have a lot and I know it, I give to the others not take with petty wants, I am not holier than you, non of us are. But we do have a faith in the Christ that saves us, it does not make us holier than anyone else. <br>  You are not looking at the love of true Christians. Perhaps you've had run ins with those who would call themselves Christians but believe me there are literally millions who profess but do not live the life of a Christian. These are what we call "counterfiet Christians". Do not pay any attention to them.<br>  I was told that in a group of one hundred men one man will read the bible and the other ninety-nine will read the man. Are you reading the men and women, or are you reading the bible?<br>  Do not make an assesement of Christianity by the actions of others. Go to the source of our faith and read that. <br>  In there you will find the most perfect love you have ever known and the documents that record all that we know of the Christ Jesus are valid. They are the only true source of the Christ that we have and you should base your opinions and your statements on the source rather than the "human beings" that are trying so hard to live by those standards. <br>  Look darlin; the Christ does bring us inner peace, and more but you have to go to the source and follow that, not another man or women and their faults, that's not what the Christ wanted us to know. Please, go read His teachings and base your actions on that, not on a mere man like me, or my true brothers and sisters in Christ, but on the Christ Himself.<br>  God bless and take care.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	I want you to do me a favor. You say that fundamentalists are always angry and full of hate.  I believe that I am a fundamental Christian. Do you and others actually know what this means?  It means that we believe that Jesus was born of a virgin, died on the cross to save us, and change us, and rose again and is coming back for His own.  The favor I want you to do, is go to my profile and truthfully tell me if I appear angry and hateful. If i do show me where, and I will immediately ask for forgiveness, because my desire is to share the love of Christ with others, in loving and non-judgmental way. Is their contradiction in my words and beliefs? let me know. It never ceases to amaze me when I have asked people to do this in the past, they never do. Why do you think that is?<br>  <br>  EDIT- once again I apologize if I ever misrepresented Jesus by being hurtful- however standing up for truth can be misunderstood as hateful.|`|GJS3hTK5aa	Christianity is not to be understood from the acts of some people who call them Christians. You have to deal with true servants of God, in whose company, you will feel divine happiness and peace of mind. Impatience, anger and inability to tolerate anything is not the quality of a Christian. If a Christian does it, he is not following Christ. Accepting Jesus into heart is not the message of Christianity, but loving others and loving God. Unless a person loves his fellow beings innocently and similarly loves God, he can never become part of Christ. A person who follows Christ shall be a light to others.|`|n37FjTJtaa	it only means one thing... it doesn't. if Christianity is supposed to bring them inner peace, then they must have misunderstood something in Christianity. although, I can't generalize all Christians for the actions of the few fundamentalists.|`|ec02b3b2ac0531db23e2884c415edc09aa	I have an answer for you:<br>  <br>  Just because you go into the Garage...<br>  <br>  Doesn't make you a Car.<br>  <br>  Just because someone goes into a church...<br>  <br>  Doesn't make them a Christian!<br>  <br>  Jesus directed himself to this question also, and the answer when he said..You shall know them, by their fruits (or by what they do)<br>  I would watch their actions..not their words..True Believers are known by their acts!<br>  Blessings to you!|`|stHol8ITaa	Though I'm not a Christian (yet alone a fundamentalist Christian), I think that putting all fundies into a box like this is lame (it's like calling all atheists miserable).

Sounds to me that there is going to have to be a bit more GIVE than TAKE on your end to keep this alive.<br>  <br>  Ask her directly if she would like to maintain an open sexual relationship and still be friends.  This might salvage the friendship.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  You GIVE in this relationship GIVING IN to her at this moment.  You give in by telling her she's been on your mind.  It is documented proof that people searching through clothes in shopping malls will get discouraged in their immediate area and go to another area if they simply get bumped in the butt.  This was an actual experiment performed.<br>  <br>  This is because the store owners pack the clothes in and leave relatively little space to move.  This is done on purpose because slight agitation of consumers will increase sales.  Slightly bumping on the butt will agitate a customer even more.<br>  <br>  She bumped into you, but you're only slightly agitated as a result because the agitation was brought to your attention.  She is feeling constantly agitated by something and sought a level of relief from that agitiation by bumping into you.  Why did she do this?  Because relief felt good to her.  Why were you the subject of her relief?  Because she relates the relationship between you and her to the agitation.  Maybe she didn't get a satisfactory level of closure and opening of "friendship-only" and sought some form of temporary relief as a result.<br>  <br>  I doubt it was vindictive- she is just maximizing her indulgences and hoping to get an indulgent and satisfying response from you.  Let's GIVE her that response but TAKE something immediately afterward.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  Say to her "You've been on my mind recently.."<br>  <br>  * she will feel like she's been vindicated of whatever is agitating her, although you know better.  After that, hit her with the bombshell:<br>  <br>  "You've been on my mind recently and I was just wondering if you would like to keep an open sexual relationship without being tied down to each other."<br>  <br>   I guarantee you she will not see that coming.<br>  <br>  Do this only if you want to continue a sexual relationship without being tied down.

You may not believe that, but that's why others do it.

T5DbLLgQaa	Actually, broadening/improving one's language skills is a very broad concept, it can be done in more than one ways at the same time which is highly recommended. You can NOT become better ONLY in one area e.g. speaking/chatting, you MUST improve your skills in ALL dimensions of the language!<br>  <br>  Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!!

As more jurisdictions become enlightened policies and procedures are changing.  More systems are now starting to segregate transsexual people for their safety.

So there should be some evidences to open window to the minds,but should not compel them to accept.<br>  God's existence is provable.<br>  Since the universe and beings exist, and within them are acts and creation; and since an orderly act cannot occur without an author, a meaningful book cannot be without a scribe, and a skilful embroidery be without an embroiderer; the purposeful acts which fill the universe surely have an author, and the meaningful letters and amazing embroideries which cover the face of the earth and are renewed from season to season have a scribe and an embroiderer.<br>  And since two governors directing the same matter spoils the order in that matter being spoilt; and since from a fly’s wing to the lamps in the heavens there is perfect order, there must be only one governor, one ruler. For the art and wisdom in everything is so wonderful it necessitates that the Maker of one thing is powerful over all things, to the extent that He knows every matter. Since this is so, if He was not One, there would have to be gods to the number of beings. These would be both opposed to and similar to one another, and it would therefore be a hundred thousand times impossible for this wonderful order not to be broken.<br>  Furthermore, since as is self-evidently apparent, at a command the classes of beings are in motion in a fashion a thousand times more well-ordered than an army -each group, from the stars, sun and moon and their motions to the flowers of the almond, displaying the decorations and uniforms the Pre-Eternal All-Powerful One has conferred on it, and the motion He has determined, a thousand times more regularly and perfectly than an army- since this is so, the universe has an Absolute Ruler behind the veil of the Unseen to Whose command its beings look and conform.<br>  www.lightofquran.info/33word.htm|`|PWankIUpaa	He is not Hidden !

He was taught that this life was a time for him to "find bread by the sweat of his own brow".<br>  Jesus Christ is the Bread and the Life. <br>  We were all sent here, like Adam, to do the same.<br>  <br>  It's like making a cake. <br>  We believe we can make a cake because others have said that they have and they have told us how delicious it is.<br>  They share a recipe. <br>  The instructions are there if we want to read them.<br>  Nobody will force us to read them.<br>  Some people like reading the recipe, but never actually apply the knowledge.<br>  Some people look at the ingredients and do not believe that they can make  cake.<br>  Many try to mix the ingredients their own way and then complain that they tried and there was no cake to be made.<br>  <br>  We have been given the material to find God.<br>  We have witnesses that God is real. <br>  We have direct communication to help guide us (prayer).<br>  <br>  It takes lots of effort because the proof is not given until a man has been sufficiently tested. <br>  Why is this? Because if God were to prove himself too early, that man could easily fall away afterward (as his commitment was too weak for the knowledge) and the punishment/consequence for sinning against knowledge is MUCH greater than it is for sinning without knowledge.<br>  Those who murdered Christ are able to obtain some degree of mercy because they knew not what they did. Open rebellion against truth cannot be tolerated.<br>  This is why Jesus said that for a man to deny him was forgivable. For a man to deny the Holy Ghost was not forgivable. The Holy Ghost is the power through which men obtain proof of truth.<br>  <br>  Satan and his followers, in the spirit world before this world, openly rebelled. They knew what they were doing. There was no progression for them and they were cast out of God's presence. They chose to be cast out. The only way a person in this world can be cast out with those same people/souls, is if they were to seek God, find him, obtain proof in this life and then later deny him and fight against him. <br>  <br>  Here are some very vital ingredients to finding God:<br>  <br>  "Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God."<br>  "Pray lest ye enter into temptation."<br>  "If ye seek me, ye shall find me."<br>  "If ye love me, keep my commandments."<br>  <br>  I can tell you from experience that God can be found.|`|udmONXu5aa	No,... you're wrong,...<br>  <br>  Allah never expect everyone to worship Him<br>  but He assure you to ask Him for Help (if you wanna to)<br>  and if you don't want Him to help You,... it doesn't matter Sir,..<br>  <br>  Allah need nothing (because everything belongs to Him)....but human need Him to help,..|`|KNKLAmuNaa	This is one of the main reasons I gave up on God.

He said to the woman, "Did God really say, 'You must not eat from any tree in the garden'?"<br>  <br>      2 The woman said to the serpent, "We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden, 3 but God did say, 'You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden, and you must not touch it, or you will die.' "<br>  <br>      4 "You will not surely die," the serpent said to the woman. 5 "For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."|`|byNiRl0Xaa	it's a test of faith. only those with the strongest faith will believe thus, being the greater followers.|`|bcPQnIwwaa	He didn't hide himself.

g7bQ9zSvaa	Protestants are non-Catholics.  They believe in the bible, and many are founded on the biblical principles further revealed during the Reformation.  A result of the Reformation was making the bible accessible to everyone and not just a select 'holy' few, so most protestants will also believe in a personal relationship with God, rather than having to go through priests or rituals.  As someone who has been part of both Pentecostal and Baptist churches, I don't think there's a major difference between them actually - they just don't know how similar they are.  In truth, amongst both Pentecostal and Baptist churches, there is a lot of variation eg, there are conservative Baptist churches right through to Baptist churches who also believe in gifts of the Spirit, eg speaking in tongues - I find the latter indistinguishable from Pentecostal churches.  Their core beliefs are the same, in God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in being saved by grace and being born again and in the bible.  Both also follow the biblical example of being baptised by immersion in water (this is probably the main part that makes them different to other traditional denominations).  What is supposed to make Pentecostals different (although this is no longer the case as many other churches have experienced some sort of charismatic renewal), is that they believe that the God works now the same way he did in the first century church in the bible, including Spiritual gifts.|`|FwlvvdPhaa	Please! Accept my answer!<br>  <br>  Protestantism originated in the 16th century Protestant Reformation. Protestant doctrine, also known in continental European traditions as Evangelical doctrine, is in opposition to that of Roman Catholicism. It typically holds that Scripture (rather than tradition or ecclesiastic interpretation of Scripture)[1] is the source of revealed truth.<br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 Meaning and origin of the term<br>  2 Fundamental principles<br>  3 Major groupings<br>  4 Denominations<br>  5 Theological tenets of the reformation<br>  6 Christ's presence in the Lord's Supper<br>  7 Catholicism<br>  8 Radical Reformation<br>  9 Movements within Protestantism<br>  9.1 Pietism and Methodism<br>  9.2 Evangelicalism<br>  9.3 Adventism<br>  9.4 Modernism, Sunderianism and Liberalism<br>  9.5 Pentecostalism<br>  9.6 Fundamentalism<br>  9.7 Neo-orthodoxy<br>  9.8 New Evangelicalism<br>  9.9 Paleo-Orthodoxy<br>  9.10 Ecumenism<br>  10 Founders: the first Protestant major reformers and theologians<br>  11 See also<br>  12 References<br>  13 External links<br>  13.1 Supporting<br>  13.2 Critical<br>  13.3 Miscellaneous<br>  [edit]Meaning and origin of the term<br>  <br>  The word Protestant is derived from the Latin protestari [2][3] meaning publicly declare which refers to the letter of protestation by Lutheran princes against the decision of the Diet of Speyer in 1529, which reaffirmed the edict of the Diet of Worms in 1521, banning Luther's documents. Since that time, the term Protestantism has been used in many different senses, often as a general term merely to signify that they are not Roman Catholics.<br>  While churches which historically emerged directly or indirectly from the Protestant Reformation generally constitute traditional Protestantism, in common usage the term is often used to refer to any Christian church other than the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches.[4] This usage is imprecise, however, as there are non-Roman Catholic and non-Eastern Orthodox churches which predate the Reformation (notably Oriental Orthodoxy). Anglicans, although historically influenced by the Protestant Reformation in what is called the English Reformation, differs from many Reformation principles and understands itself to be a middle path—a via media—between Roman Catholic and Protestant doctrines. Other groups, such as the Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses, reject traditional Protestantism as another deviation from Christianity, while perceiving themselves to be restorationists.<br>  [edit]Fundamental principles<br>  <br>  The three fundamental principles of traditional Protestantism are the following:<br>  Supremacy of the Bible<br>  The belief in the Bible as the sole infallible authority.<br>  Justification by Faith Alone<br>  The subjective principle of the Reformation is justification by faith alone, or, rather, by free grace through faith operative in good works. It has reference to the personal appropriation of the Christian salvation, and aims to give all glory to Christ, by declaring that the sinner is justified before God (i.e. is acquitted of guilt, and declared righteous) solely on the ground of the all-sufficient merits of Christ as apprehended by a living faith, in opposition to the theory — then prevalent, and substantially sanctioned by the Council of Trent — which makes faith and good works co-ordinate sources of justification, laying the chief stress upon works. Protestantism does not depreciate good works; but it denies their value as sources or conditions of justification, and insists on them as the necessary fruits of faith, and evidence of justification.[5]<br>  Universal Priesthood of Believers<br>  The universal priesthood of believers implies the right and duty of the Christian laity not only to read the Bible in the vernacular, but also to take part in the government and all the public affairs of the Church. It is opposed to the hierarchical system, which puts the essence and authority of the Church in an exclusive priesthood, and makes ordained priests the necessary mediators between God and the people.[5]<br>  [edit]Major groupings<br>  <br>  Trinitarian Protestant denominations are divided according to the position taken on Baptism:<br>  "Mainline Protestants", a North American phrase, are Christians who trace their tradition's lineage to Lutheranism, or Calvinism. These groups are often considered to be part of the Magisterial Reformation and traditionally have adhered to the central doctrines and principles of the Reformation. Lutheranism, Calvinism, and a Zwinglian theology are typically mainline, and as denominations, "mainline" is typically seen as referring to Methodists, Presbyterians, Free Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Lutherans, all large denominations with significant liberal, conservative, and perhaps even Anglo-Catholic, wings.<br>  Anabaptists were so named from the fact that they re-baptised converts. According to the Edinburg Cyclopedia this name dates as far back as Tertullian, who was born just fifty years after the Apostle John; by about 1600 they were referred to simply as Baptists.

The Protestants and Roman Catholics, the term Protestants referees to those Christians who protested because the Roman Catholics weren't keeping in step with Biblical teaching.<br>  The Roman Catholic Church discouraged people from reading the Bible, they wanted to translate the Holy Scripture to their congregation. Their reasoning was that ordinary people wouldn't be able to understand Holy Scripture.<br>  The Protestants on the other hand encouraged everyone to read the Bible, they believed that by reading the Bible, people would arrive at the truth.<br>  It looks as though nothing has changed, the Protestants still encourage everyone to read the Bible, while the Catholics are still practicing their ritualized form of Christianity.|`|z17o0p9Eaa	Hi, I'm one of them! :o<br>  <br>  Acts 2:38<br>  <br>  -Repentance - Feeling sorry for your sins/asking God for forgiveness<br>  -Baptism fully submerged under water in Jesus Name<br>  -Receive the Holy Ghost (Evidence of speaking in other tongues)<br>  -Living a Holy Life (Modest dress etc...)<br>  -Continuing in the faith helping others...outreach etc...<br>  -Being full of Joy!<br>  <br>  <br>  Also:<br>  Jesus IS the Father<br>  Jesus IS the Son<br>  Jesus IS the Holy Ghost<br>  and all these three are one.<br>  One God.

When it comes to way of worship Protestants do not take the Lord's Supper.<br>  <br>  Protestants are members of  Western Christian churches, whose faith and practice are founded on the principles of the Reformation, especially in the acceptance of the Bible as the sole source of revelation, in justification by faith alone, and in the universal priesthood of all the believers.
uO0knmZOaa	My friend Oyester, the Holy Bible condemns all these sins more than does the Qur'an. In fact, there is no single sin condemned by the Qur'an that has not been (MORE) condemned by the Holy Bible. Just read the following:<br>  <br>  <br>  Rom  1:25-27 “They exchanged the truth of God for a lie and revered and worshiped the creature rather than the creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. Therefore, God handed them over to degrading passions. Their females exchanged natural relations for unnatural (lesbianism), <br>  <br>  and the males likewise gave up natural relations with females and burned with lust for one another (homosexuality). Males did shameful things with males and thus received in their own persons the due penalty for their perversity.” <br>  <br>  <br>  1 Tim 1:9-10 “We know that the law is good, provided that one uses it as law, <br>  with the understanding that law is meant not for a righteous person but for the lawless and unruly, the godless and sinful, the unholy and profane, those who kill their fathers or mothers, murderers, <br>  the unchaste, practicing homosexuals,  kidnapers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is opposed to sound teaching” <br>  1 Cor 6:9, “Do you not know that the unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor boy prostitutes nor sodomites (Gays and Lesbians) <br>  nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God” <br>  <br>  <br>  Leviticus 18:6 reads: "You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female. It is an abomination." A similar verse occurs two chapters later, in Leviticus 20:13: "A man who sleeps with another man is an abomination and should be executed."<br>  Leviticus 20:13 “If a man has sexual intercourse with a male as one has sexual intercourse with a woman, the two of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood guilt is on themselves. “<br>  <br>  Condemnation of Masturbation<br>  Gen 38:9-10 "He spilled his seed on the ground... And the thing which Onan did displeased the Lord: wherefore he slew him also"<br>  <br>  Condemnations of Fornication and Adultry and the Punishments<br>  Mark 7: 21 "For from within, out of the aheart of men, proceed evil thoughts, badulteries, fornications, murders,.." <br>  <br>  1 Cor 10:8 "Neither let us commit afornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand..." <br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 22:22 "If a man is found sleeping with another man's wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die."<br>  <br>  Leviticus 20:10 "If a man commits adultery with another man's wife--with the wife of his neighbor--both the adulterer and the adulteress must be put to death."<br>  <br>  Proverbs 6:32 "But a man who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself."|`|771e401b864ef2c6278719b487b80406aa	Scripture specifically condemns homosexuality.  (the lifestyle choice, not the tendency.... the action.) masturbation is not specifically mentioned, but being self centered, and focused on self gratification, and normally surrounded by lustful imagination, it seems clear that it is not a good thing.|`|g7bQ9zSvaa	There are loads of verses that say homosexuality is sin and they're all over R&S.  With masturbation, I'm not sure where, but there's supposed to be something about not wasting 'seed' in the bible, but my take on it is that when you masturbate, you must be having some sort of sexual thought, and Jesus said that if you look at any woman with in a lustful way (I suppose, barring your wife!), that you have already committed adultery in your heart.  In Jesus, we are under a new covenant so the old testament punishment for adultery doesn't still hold, since no one is more holy and all have sinned (he without sin cast the first stone).  Adultery is wrong because it hurts people and hurts ourselves, not just because God will punish you.  The punishment is dealing with these consequences on this Earth.  I suppose there's the feelings of guilt and shame also.  However, unless you have accepted the sacrifice of Christ in place of us for our sins, the punishment is the same as any other sin (death, not eternal life with God).  Sounds harsh, but if you know God in your life, you'll know how loving he actually is.  Also, there's the day why you have to stand before God and account for what you've done, and I personally wouldn't want to add adultery to the list!|`|CBmizuGwaa	...Christianity says  to follow Gods Word and Gods Word says this... (see the Scriptures below)<br>  <br>  God only has "1" punishment for living in sin; just "1"|`|7FPvEWb4aa	Oyester, take a break from Y!A from time to time.  You're racking up points like a mad person (I'm racking them up too fast myself)....but that's just my opinion.<br>  <br>  Regarding a much more important point...God's opinion.  Your question allows me to express clearly God's opinion because He spoke of 2 of those 3 topics quite clearly.<br>  <br>  Homosexuality and Adultery are clear sins against God and are punishable by eternal death.  The Good News is God won't hold them against you IF you turn from them and believe on the one and only Son of God, Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Heb 13:4 Marriage should be honored by all, and the marriage bed kept pure, for God will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral. <br>  <br>  Eph 5:5 For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. <br>  <br>  1Th 4:3 It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should avoid sexual immorality; <br>  <br>  on and on and on....<br>  <br>  Regarding Masturbation the Bible is silent. Does that mean it is not a sin?  Not exactly. The Bible is silent on speeding as well but speeding over the legal limit would be a sin....it would also be unwise...resulting in possible injury.<br>  <br>  Masturbation usually involves imagination/visualization.  It is often the end result of pornography...either mild (advertisements) or hard core (mags or videos)....and that is where it crosses the line because Jesus said in Matt 5:28  "But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart."<br>  <br>  The older I get the slower I drive.  It's just wise.  And boy have I been given a great deal of slack and grace from the police out there.  If I had a ticket for every time I sped I'd be in jail for life right now.<br>  <br>  The reason (I believe) God didn't put Masturbation in the Bible is because He cut us a little slack.  Every male and most every female has masturbated in their life.  However, just like you and I can overcome our speeding, we can overcome our other sins.  Homosexuality, Adultery, and Masturbation CAN BE OVERCOME....but only be God's Grace.<br>  <br>  iamnotbut....I know I AM.|`|lXH78edZaa	Not allowed ,Gays shall be killed<br>  <br>  Romans 1:26-32 (King James Version)<br>  <br>   26For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:<br>  <br>   27And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.<br>  <br>   28And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;<br>  <br>   29Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,<br>  <br>   30Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,<br>  <br>   31Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:<br>  <br>   32Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.|`|iij80YD4aa	Christianity doesn't condone any sin. Jesus warned that if a person doesn't turn from their sins and be born again, they would have no justification when they stand before the Father to give account of their lives.<br>  Christians are sinners as well, the difference is they are are fully aware of their sins and are in a constant battle against their carnal nature. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God, we can't expect God to bless us if we live according to our carnal desires.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Allowed? Like if you do any of those things, you cannot be a Christian?! No.<br>  <br>  I have found that many people tend to fall into rhetoric when discussing Christianity. Especially those who are Legalists.<br>  <br>  Since I am not one of those legalists, and I try not to fall for the rhetoric, as I read the Bible Jesus said whosoever believes in the one God sent shall not be condemned. Those who believe that God will deliver them from the wages of sin are redeemed by God's word.<br>  <br>  We sin because we are sinners; we have that nature to do wrong and choose evil. I will not be one of those who deny my ability to do wrong. But in Christ I am forgiven, and that is my focus in life.
wY8jE8HEaa	First of all is God present everywhere? <br>  <br>  Almighty God (Allah) is indeed the Creator, of all that exists; He is greater and above all the creations. And so, He cannot be inside what He created and His creatures cannot be inside Him. And He is with us wherever we are, but, His being with us is not in terms of His essence as He is above the heavens, but He is with us by His Knowledge. To know that Allah is with us, gives us a sense of consciousness that our Lord is entirely aware of our deeds and reminds us that we are answerable to Allah for all our actions. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  He is the all-Seer, the all-Knower, the Protector of all that exists and He controls the affairs of the world being above the heavens: <br>  <br>  Do you feel secure that He, WHO IS OVER THE HEAVEN will not cause the earth to sink with you? The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 67, Verse 16. <br>  <br>  So the logic to worship idols because God exists everywhere does not hold true. <br>  <br>  Creating objects of worship besides Allah. <br>  <br>  Allah states, There is nothing like Him (Allah) but He sees and hears all. The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 42, Verse 11 <br>  <br>  and <br>  <br>  There is none comparable to Him. The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 112, Verse 4 <br>  <br>  Allah goes on to inform us that our eyes cannot grasp Him. He said , <br>  <br>  Eyes cannot catch Him but He catches all eyes The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 6, Verse 103 <br>  <br>  Seeing God. <br>  <br>  Allah also makes it clear that worshipping anything besides Allah is to ascribe partners to Him. To elevate them to Allah's status and worship them is in derogation to Him. This is the crime of Shirk, the greatest of all sins. <br>  <br>  Verily, Allah forgives not shirk (to worship/associate others) with Him, but he forgives (anything) less than that to whoever He pleases. And whoever makes shirk with Allah has invented a tremendous sin. The Holy Qur'an, Chapter 4, Verse 48. <br>  <br>  Punishment for Shirk is Hell. <br>  <br>  Know Allah through His attributes|`|49VzNZM1aa	Ok I got your answer.  And is has to do with how complex the universe actually is.  The reason God created it is not to make something complex but to show us who he is.  And maybe you sorta think as God a a person that doesn't exist, but God is not a person.  So finally complexity does not necessarily need a creator, it could be change a cycle or even actuality.

You can give us theories of why God cant exists but their only theories and words. Second, where is proof and evidence God doesnt exist.

They drain the lake but their is no Lock Ness monster. Now does that prove that the Lock Ness monster is fake. No. it only proves that he is not on that specific lake. You cant simply say God doesnt exist because of this and that. Fact is no one can prove God really exist or he doesnt exist.|`|AKJKenFCaa	If your thinking by earth's terms, yeah, he would.

He is outside the space time continuum, so much so that he can experience a parity of duration equivalent of a thousand years buffered to 1 day and 1 day expanded to a thousand years (2 Peter 3:8). We as humans cannot do that. We must experience one day at a time. God's thoughts are not our thoughts (Isaiah 55:8). We are physical. God is spirit (John 4:24). There are spirit beings who have had no parents (Hebrews 7:3). The Father (the Most High God) was not born and has no parents. He will exist eternally into the future (Revelation 11:15). He has existed eternally in the past (Titus 1:2). Our minds are finite and we cannot conceptualize the idea of eternally into the past due to this limitation in our minds. Nevertheless we can acknowledge the fact. We, as humans have to gain power as we grow up because we are physical. However, it is the nature of God (who is spirit) to be all powerful, almighty (Genesis 17:1). His power is also inifinite (having no end). <br>  <br>  Our existence is bounded by the speed of light.  But God IS light! (1 Timothy 6:16).  His Son is the light for this planet (John 8:12, John 9:5, John 12:46).  <br>  <br>  Generally physical things are superior when they are more complex. The Spirit world is the opposite. That which is superior has more simplicity (2 Corinthians 11:3).  Any one who has seen Christ has, in essence, seen the Father (John 14:9).  There was no need for God to be created.  God is self-existent; He is the great I AM (Exodus 3:14).  God has the attributes of power, creativity, and balance. It is through the sacrifice of his Son that we have a chance at salvation (Acts 4:12).   <br>  <br>  "Remember the former things of old: for I [am] God, and [there is] none else; [I am] God, and [there is] none like me, declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times [the things] that are not [yet] done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure: Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executes my counsel from a far country: Yes, I have spoken [it].  I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed [it], I will also do it" (Isaiah 46:9-11).|`|2MfMyh4Maa	Complexity in the natural world might indicate that a creator is needed.

It's simple- languages change slowly over time (Middle English, spoken in the Middle Ages, is virtually incomprehensible to a modern speaker).<br>  <br>  Now if you have different populations of people, separated by large distances with no easy communication, then their languages will change in different ways- until they have nothing in common at all!<br>  <br>  The relatoinships between languages are due to different languages slowly changing from a common ancestor. In fact, historians can track the changes in language in recent history by looking at sources and seeing how the languages change. We can compare documents from the 1300s, 1400s, and so on and watch as the language becomes more and more like our own.<br>  <br>  That's probably what happened.|`|QvY5sROoaa	Genesis chapter 10 states the general picture, including the opposition to those results. Nimrod was in opposition to Jehovah and wanted mankind to stay in the same area so he could rule over them, and he used violence towards that end.<br>  <br>  (Genesis 10:5) 5?From these the population of the isles of the nations was spread about in their lands, each according to its tongue, according to their families, by their nations.<br>  <br>  (Genesis 10:32) 32?These were the families of the sons of Noah according to their family descents, by their nations, and from these the nations were spread about in the earth after the deluge.<br>  <br>  (Genesis 10:8-10) 8?And Cush became father to Nim′rod. He made the start in becoming a mighty one in the earth. 9?He displayed himself a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah. That is why there is a saying: “Just like Nim′rod a mighty hunter in opposition to Jehovah.” 10?And the beginning of his kingdom came to be Ba′bel and E′rech and Ac′cad and Cal′neh, in the land of Shi′nar.<br>  <br>  Genesis chapter 11 is written in parallel to chapter 10, from a different angle. In chapter 11 we see details that was not provided in the general description already given. One thing we see in this chapter are the two "seeds"; the seed of Satan (resister), who resisted Gods'  will:<br>  (Genesis 11:4) 4?They now said: “Come on! Let us build ourselves a city and also a tower with its top in the heavens, and let us make a celebrated name for ourselves, for fear we may be scattered over all the surface of the earth.”<br>  <br>  And then this is why Jehovah confused their language.<br>  <br>  (Genesis 11:6-7) 6?After that Jehovah said: “Look! They are one people and there is one language for them all, and this is what they start to do. Why, now there is nothing that they may have in mind to do that will be unattainable for them. 7?Come now! Let us go down and there confuse their language that they may not listen to one another’s language.”<br>  <br>  Then, beginning in verse 10 we see the situation involving the other seed which came through Shem. The confusion of languages occurred during the life of Peleg.<br>  <br>   Also in regard to this Biblical account of the confusion of the original one language of mankind, the archaeologist Sir Henry Rawlinson said that “if we were to be thus guided by the mere intersection of linguistic paths, and independently of all reference to the scriptural record, we should still be led to fix on the plains of Shinar, as the focus from which the various lines had radiated.

But, you also leave out that each time one of those named in that bible is claimed to have seen that god, that person was conveniently alone, just as Moses was.  My take on Moses, if he also ever lived, is that his people were very tired of all of his promises and they were about ready to hang Moses on a tree.  He wanted to keep his power over the people and knew that he had to do something quickly.  Remember that he had been going up on that mountain for many days, and what was he doing?  He was carving out those stone tablets with what he thought would help him control his people and retain his power.

It is said that he thought that, since God used to speak to him, he might be able to actually see God. The story is in the Quran, where God tells us what happened:<br>  “And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, ‘My Lord, show me (Yourself) that I may look at You.’ (God) said, ‘You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me.’ But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke, he said, ‘Exalted are You! I have repented to You, and I am the first of the believers.’” (Quran 7:143)<br>  God made it clear that no-one, including the great prophet Moses, can bear the sight of the divine, for God is too great to be grasped by human eyes in this life.

Whether a god or anything immaterial for that matter actually exists, who knows, we can not make assertions based on nothing and expect them to have any truth value.<br>  <br>  Edit: When atheists use the word unicorn in an analogy, it is not about a unicorn. It is about how both the concept of a unicorns and the concept of god are the same in the sense that neither have definitive evidence for them and both could be said to be immaterial. <br>  <br>  Saying a best seller book being so shows something is merely an appeal to popularity fallacy. The popularity of something does not raise its truth value a single bit.|`|oDxTEqdraa	Your politeness is refreshing but your logic is, nonetheless, flawed.<br>  <br>  The only reason you believe in a god is because some ancient scribe  you don't even know, co-wrote a book with 40 others over a period of more than 1000 years about an invisible entity nobody has ever seen before.  It's all legend and speculation. <br>  <br>  No one has ever seen a god in over 7000 years of recorded history (and by "recorded" I am not saying it was in literate writing but rather in cuneiform, hieroglyphs and cave paintings.)<br>  <br>  All the old superstitious ancients who "claim" to have seen god have never described him, his voice, his appearance. No one has ever sketched a likeness of god.  There's nothing.<br>  <br>  Then there's god himself, if such a creature existed. By showing up for two seconds, all doubt would be erased. But it never happens because it never will because there is nothing out there. You can't see wind but you can feel it in your hair and hear it. At least it's something.

It should also make you feel a little better in yourself too.<br>  <br>  Of course you are right and you have paid for the right to sit down and you are not obliged to get up and offer your seat to anyone else.<br>  <br>  I am 62 and still give up my seat to anyone who are less able than I am, and have always done so, and am happy to do it.<br>  <br>  The way I looked at it when I was younger, and still do, is that one day I might be grateful that someone cares enough to give up their seat for me in order for me to have a more comfortable and less painful ride.<br>  <br>  Poseidon|`|5rL1rBUaaa	Depending on what type of person who asks you, I think you're right to sit there.<br>  <br>  If it was an old man, or a pregnant woman it'd be completely rude for you not to offer it up.<br>  <br>  "the people should get on at a stop before me if they wanted a seat don't you think" sounds like complete bullshit. Lol.|`|nHokdvx7aa	Of course you should give up your seat to those less able to stand than you are. Personally, I'm happy standing up and often do unless there is a clear seat for me. <br>  If an elderly person, pregnant woman or war veteran gets on the bus it's only right to give up your seat. The world doesn't revolve around you!|`|gHTCdbvWaa	As a person of royalty, one has never been on a bus as who knows were all those commoners and peasant's hath been, but I woul imagine thou would give up a seat for an old man, womenfolk however should not be sitting down anywhere as they hath work to do at home providing food and cleaning for the all knowing men|`|3onySMD6aa	I only give it to the elderly if theres a middle aged man then you should still sit there and because you a woman you shouldnt move.|`|fXPD45Jwaa	if they ask me whether if its possible that they take my seat...<br>  i give it up!<br>  its just a seat after all....<br>  and after a few bus stations i get out of the bus!|`|lHKlFBPCaa	If you don't want to be asked to give up your seat all the time, then why don't you get on the stop before. Or better yet, don't get on the bus at all and save all the rest of us of having to sit near somebody like you.<br>  <br>  I can't believe people are that rude to ignore somebody and be so selfish to refuse to give up their seat.<br>  <br>  I'm 16 (so it's not all of the younger generation, lol) and I always give up my seat, I don't leave it to the point where someone asks me to stand, I offer to stand as soon as I see that all of the seats are full and there is someone less able to stand, standing.<br>  <br>  Once I offered my seat to this elderly women and she didn't want me to give my seat up, so she sat in my seat and said I could squish in next to her, I said no I'm fine with standing honestly, but she insisted I should and we had a nice chat next to eachother on the ride home. <br>  <br>  As I see it, so what that I paid for the ticket. I'm getting the ride into town or wherever I want to go, and so what if I have to stand for 10 minutes. Is it really going to kill you if you stand for that short space of time, and usually one or two people get off at the next stop anyway!<br>  <br>  Even if someone who looked perfectly healthy or if they were young and they asked for my seat, I think I would give it up without any hesitation as for all I know that person could have a problem I don't know about, so I'm not going to refuse to anyone. I'm happy standing. <br>  <br>  You may not agree with me, but I like hearing the comments off the strangers on the bus about how I'm such a polite young girl and I should be proud of myself.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	It's actually more fun to ride a bus while standing. You never know exactly which way the bus is going to bounce and jostle you, so you don't know which way to lean.  It's like an adventure!<br>  Stand up while you are young enough to enjoy the ride.  Someday you'll be old and infirm (if you're lucky enough to live that long!) and you'll wish for some youngster to give you the courtesy of offering her seat.|`|QsCPOHAraa	Yeah, that sounds about consistent with the selfish, inconsiderate young generation of the modern age. All about themselves. "Me first and screw everyone else."<br>  <br>  Don't give up your seat to just anybody of course, but you should give it up for an elderly person or someone with an obvious physical condition that would make standing more difficult for them.<br>  <br>  Or you could just go on with your righteous sense of entitlement and not even respond when somebody interacts with you. Your choice. I know which world I'd rather live in.
8ubAwaGCaa	It is harder to preserve than to destroy.  It is harder to create, or so I assume, than it is to preserve.  Brahma > Vishnu > Siva.<br>  <br>  In Christianity, Jehovah (taken to be Jesus Christ before his birth) was the creator and is the preserver.  While the destruction of the wicked could be attributed to the wicked themselves and to Jesus, Satan is actually the one who is called the Destroyer in Christianity.  This might explain things if some Christians you know are a little less than enthusiastic about Siva.<br>  <br>  Gabriel is the archangel who, apparently, delivers the most important messages.  He heralded the prophetic callings of Zacharias and John the Baptist, asked Mary if she was willing to be the mother of the Son of God, etc.  Of course, other angels have certainly made announcements and worked with prophets.|`|AA10493307	Yes, gods are angels, fallen angels.|`|bkuFxvkcaa	Vishnu Brahma and Shiva are all the same God, Brahman.<br>  <br>  And, No, you should not Compare God to the Angels, Vishnu is not under God he is God.|`|G7uWSutFaa	No, Vishnu was/is not Gabriel.<br>  <br>  You are trying to compare two religions which have dramatically different ideas about God and creation. I am sure that you are imagining that Vishnu, being the God of preservation must come one step down the hierarchy of Brahma the Creator. Hence you are comparing Vishnu to an angel. <br>  <br>  This is not true.<br>  <br>  In Hindu philosophy, God is the only and the ultimate reality, the ultimate truth. Everything else is derived from God. This ultimate reality is called Brahman - not to be confused with Brahma the God of Creation, or Brahmin, the priestly caste. <br>  <br>  Brahman doesn't have a beginning or end - Brahman is eternal. Time doesn't have any meaning for Brahman because Time was created by Brahman. Brahman has no shape or form. Brahman doesn't have any attributes, Brahman is everywhere and in every one. Thus you and I have Brahman within us. We are all divine, only thing is that we don't realy know that. <br>  <br>  It is difficult for us human beings, with our limited intellect, to imagine such a limitless, formless, shapeless, attributeless being. Hence we give form, shape and attributes, and create Gods. Brahma, Vishnu, Siva, are all manifestations of the same God Brahman. So are all the other Gods in the Hindu Pantheon.<br>  <br>  In Hindu philosophy, everything is cyclical. Universes are created, they exist for some time, then they get destroyed. Then after a short while the cycle repeats again. Creation is a contnuous process, so is destruction. You can see the parallels of this cyclical behavior in everything around us.<br>  <br>  To repeat my answer to your question, No, Vishnu is not Gabriel.<br>  <br>  Thanks!!|`|d742c2cef54941ca559ae7ca690b1fd8aa	Not possible bcos If Gabriel might had been Lord Vishnu then all Hindus+Buddhists today might had been Muslims or Christians.<br>  <br>  What Hindus believe about Christian or Muslim religion. From day 1 of universe the 1st religion on earth was Hinduism. Later groups of people were exiled by a particular group following religion. They started living in desert and elsewhere and were detached from main stream. This people later came with new religions like Muslim & Christian religion. Most important factor is that bodies are burnt in Hinduism. Soul goes towards heavens located in direction of Sun and North pole of universe whereas in these religions bodies are burried - a sort of no entry towards Lord Indra's heavens. A 13 year old Hindu Peshwa was killed by a conspiracy so after his death when his funeral was to be arranged no Brahmin came forward for doing this act bcos of untimely death and that too by a human conspiracy it was decided to bury him. His Samadhi still lies here. It is believed that spirit for more or less time resides nearby the Samadhi means a sort of grave or tomb in Hinduism. Even Muslims agree that their Jannat is located in desert part of Afghanistan whereas in Hinduism heavens of Lord Indra are spreaded in vast areas of  north pole of universe starting from Sun & moon and hells speaded in south pole . Hindus believe that Buddhism is a part of Hinduism bcos he was 8th incarnation of Lord Vishnu but apart from that people from other religions are illusionised or on wrong path. However this was the belief of Brahmins in olden times which was a factor that they had not surrendered to Islam or Christianity in olden times thinking that these people are misguided. A group of Brahmins were lured by Christianity but when they heard about last feast of Christ in which they ate fish they set back. It can be true that Muslims or Christians might be on the right path but this thoughts are having a deep impact on subconscious minds of Hindus bcos undoubtly they are the 1st religion of this world and they believe they are more suitable to guide rather than to get guided.<br>  <br>  Aside it is true that heavenly gods dont differentiate humans from their religion they just see the heart of human on which they are working,concentrating etc. and Lord Vishnu himself says u worship through any way if not directly still this wud be considered as an indirect worship towards me & I will be accepting it. Means by chance if there is no other truth than Lord Vishnu still people of other religion need not feel depressed bcos Lord Vishnu says that all sorts of worships comes towards me so they are benefitted.<br>  <br>  So conclusion is God is one, heavenly gods dont differentiate between religions but heavens attained are different. In Hindus also different people attain different heavens. A Sati means devoted wife towards husband goes to Satlok which is above the heavens of Lord Indra. Good people goes to Lord Indra's heaven where sexual enjoyment is prime and all desires are fulfilled. It is a lavish environment and people are engaged in dancing & rejoicing. Followers of Ekadashi vrat gets a sepearte say mini planet to live and all Vibhutis means all people he loved throughout his life is attained by him there - such a story is existent in Hindu history. A Hindu had 1 wife he followed an ekadashi vrat with sincerity so after his death he went to a mini planet but it was rotating with an inclined axis bcos he had attained 26 vibhutis there say 26 girls perhaps to live eternally or very long period but his wife was still alive on earth.After his wife reached the same heaven did that miniplanet started revolving properly. Means in Hindus also different people attain different heavens. It depends upon your acts.

FKxrJxbPaa	Allegedly Septimus was half/half but anyways you're right<br>  <br>  The indigenous peoples of Britain were not Germanic, but of Celtic origins such as the Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Cornish and Manx. However the English have dominated them culturally for centuries so there's been this myth going around that they are indigenous to Britain. Celtic tribes were there LONG before the Angles ever arrived, in fact they were here prior to the arrival of the Romans themselves. In addition to that there is a noticable Norman French influence in the culture, especially in the south, and for roughly four centuries nearly all of England's aristocracy was of French, Scandinavian or German descent. Hell, even the queen today is of German ancestry, and Prince Phillip Mountbatten is half Greek half German.<br>  <br>  <br>  To be fair, however, the English themselves are largely of mixed Anglo-Saxon, Danish, and Jute descent overlaying a Celtic substratum...the Celts were never anihilated just assimilated and thusly many Englishment could possibly claim being "indigenous" despite the fact that most of them are of Germanic stock.<br>  <br>  So in a small sense they were the "original" inhabitants of England but not in the manner in which they often portray themselves to be.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  the Celts are in no way ethnically, culturally or linguistically Germanic at all. They inhabited what we now know as southern Germany at one point, but that was prior to the time when Germanic tribes inhabited that area.|`|9ZQnd2rmaa	The beliefe that all English were anglo Saxon came about through the writings of the monk Gildas, who wrote about great slaughters of natives (which isn't substantiated by the archaeology),and then through pure lack of knowledge and racism in Victorian times (the wealthy classes of England back then wanted to disassociate themselvesfrom the 'uncouth' celts.)<br>   As it happens modern dna testing  shows us that the Saxons certainly didn't wipe out everyone and in fact most English people have some prehistoric  ancestry,which is akin to that of the Welsh and Scots. Put it this way, genetically the similarities between the countries are bigger than the differences.<br>   And as far as celts go-- the 'celts' of the British Isles and Ireland are NOT the ones from central Europe! They are a much older people with many connection with ancient Iberia going back to the neolithic and mesolithic. (Infact the celtic languages probably arrived no later than the bronze age, and certainly not,as once thought, in some iron Age invasion (of which we have no evidence, genetic or finds-wise.)|`|3VXGLhnMaa	The Angles,Jutes and Saxons were all invaders as were the Romans.<br>  The native peoples were driven west wards by these invaders.Then came the Normans.!!|`|R0mZqqfXaa	I am Scottish and from the Celtic heritage.

What else are people meant to do?|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	I think part of the problem is that many people see a white person and immediately think "anglo saxon" before they think "germanic tribe" unless they're standing in Germany. The original germanic tribes included germans, obviously, but also Scaninavians, Frisians, the Franks and a lot of others that either died out or intermarried with other people and lost their individual tribal identity over the years. <br>  <br>  In a way, they are correct in making that assumption, they just have to back date it a bit and refer to the original settlers of that area as members of other original germanic tribes. The Anglo-Saxons are descendents of three of those tribes, the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes. <br>  <br>  So while the original settlers in that area were not Anglo-Saxons but rather other Germanic tribes, the Anglo-Saxons are very distant descendants of those original tribes. They also firmly planted themselves  in the area and are generally credited with creating and then nurturing the early culture of the area - which has, of course, evolved over time.<br>  <br>  Note: Germanic does not refer to an ethnic group, but rather commonalities in culture and language.<br>  <br>  PS - the Celts are Germanic descendants as well...|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	It's in the name<br>  <br>  Anglo Saxon.... first connection with contempry Britain

Sometimes i do wonder whether it's just a made up story. Sometimes i can't help but doubt and question my beliefs. Having said that, my belief system is too strong to convert me away from God. I may not see him but i can feel him. I can feel him in my life, being present, helping me and giving me strength in everything i do. There were times when for months i would not communicate with God properly, when my prayers weren't meaningful and i just saw my relationship with him disappearing and my life felt like it was missing something, i felt unhappy, but he never forgot about me. He stuck around and again when i needed help he was there. Now for easter i'm really mending my relationship with him and i feel closer to him everyday, and i know that i'll be able to celebrate and experience easter properly. Becoming closer to him has made me a happier person and that's how i know he's real, Having this feeling, can't just be made up there something forcing it. <br>  <br>  I could have easily answered you question based on scriptures from the bible, but i think original answers are more meaningful and opinionated, even though i very much respect and am guide by the bible.|`|1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	When you are born again ie become a Christian the Holy Spirit comes and lives inside of you.  When you are baptized in the Holy Spirit the power of God comes upon you and when you speak in tongues you will know that it is the Holy Spirit who gives you the utterances.  When you pray in tongues long enough you will develop the ability to hear God speaking to you.  The Holy Spirit will bear witness with your spirit that you are a child of God.  When you begin to exercise the spiritual gifts that the Holy Spirit has given to you you will experience the power of God in your life.  You can be 100% sure that God is real when you experience God in the spiritual dimension.  God bless you.|`|GJS3hTK5aa	If you don't believe in Jesus and if you think that whatever written about him in bible is wrong, nothing can help you.

Romans 8v9 states:-<br>  “ . . . you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.”<br>  <br>  So, it's vital to receive the Holy Spirit, but he is invisible and we cannot trust our own hearts that we are right with God . . .<br>  <br>  "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?" (Jer. 17v9)<br>  <br>  Jesus warns that many who call Him "Lord" will be told "I never knew you", he's talking about church-goers, not agnostics ! So, God must bare independant witness, the apsotles waited for this, so do I . . .In the new testament IT IS KNOWN PRECISELY WHEN people receive the Holy Spirit, and when they hadn't. The way of salvation hasn't changed.<br>  <br>  At Pentecost, the Holy Spirit began to be given as never before, making people sons of God:-<br>  “ . . . they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. . . having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now SEE and HEAR. . . For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to ALL that are afar off, even AS MANY AS the Lord our God shall call.” (Acts 2v4, 33, 39)<br>  <br>  If you were told that what you could "see and hear" (the speaking in tongues) was the promised Holy Spirit, and that this was to you and all who God would call, wouldn’t you expect to speak in tongues, or be told if this was not the case?<br>  <br>  With the gentiles:-<br>  “ While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.” (Acts 10v44)<br>  <br>  How did he know ?<br>  “For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God.” (v46)<br>  <br>  If it is possible to receive the Spirit and NOT speak in tongues, the apostles were *wrong* to judge that the Spirit had just fallen upon people when they spoke in tongues, logically they could only say that people had *at some unknown time previously* received the Spirit . . . but they didn't.|`|MSHxYrLEaa	i believe black holes exist too<br>  <br>  never seen one of them<br>  <br>  so why do you believe n them? technically you cant see it, because even light gets sucked in, and you need light to see.<br>  <br>  so why believe? because a bunch of scientists said so?|`|sohnrZDcaa	You are absolutely right. It takes a great deal of gullibility (faith) to believe in any religion. Here is an example...<br>  <br>  Regardless of any “free will” the Bible God could have prevented Eve from touching a fruit from the tree of knowledge of GOOD AND EVIL simply because GOD IS LOVE and Eve HAD NO KNOWLEDGE AT ALL of any evil! Eve saw “that the fruit was good to eat” and she ate of it in all her innocence! Eve had no “Guardian Angel” to advice her of anything wrong. She must have thought that God was wrong again like when he created man alone!  She didn’t know that God set her up to fall! <br>  <br>  The Bible writers say that as soon as God created the angels almost half of them were not one bit impressed with God’s Beauty and Holiness and 1/3 of them rebelled against God ON FREE WILL and on the spot! The highest ranking angel ever created was LUCIFER* (*Light Bearer) which is another of God’s goofs! He must have thought highly of Lucifer! If God were my employee I would question his competence! God created Eve only as an afterthought! And so Eve ate from the forbidden fruit tree for about the same reason we eat any fruit! She had no way of knowing that Satan (aka Lucifer, aka The Old Serpent) was EVIL! Any honest Christian with a reasonable IQ can tell you that the Bible God set up Eve to eat the forbidden fruit! NO GUARDIAN ANGEL WAS IN SIGHT TO PROTECT THE BULK OF HUMANITY FROM GOING TO HELL…!!!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers created an original God different from the other primitive Gods. The angels that rebelled against him were not evicted from Heaven! They became known as demons. God is in desperate need of them to justify sending the world that he loves so much to be tormented in Hell for ever and ever! According to the Bible writers the demons and Satan will be evicted from Heaven during the “Tribulation of the last days” (Rev. 12:9-10)! Nothing really makes sense in the Bible unless you have faith* (*plain gullibility) to swallow anything that the preachers tell you! Christianity is a big business banking on people’s gullibility! <br>  <br>  Back in the Garden of Eden God set up a “flaming sword moving back and forth” to protect the “Tree of Life” so no matter how much “free will” Adam and Eve may have had they couldn’t eat of it and live for ever! God also PREVENTED anybody from killing Cain. God could have done something similar to protect Eve and the bulk of the human race from Hell unless he was determined to create human beings only to torture them with fire and sulfur for ever and ever for “his pleasure.” Christianity is as Heathen and barbaric as you can’t possibly imagine!<br>  <br>  God personally intervened and PREVENTED that the Heathen King Abimelech had sex with Abraham’s sister/wife/hooker Sarah so he “wouldn't SIN against God"! God himself NOT A GUARDIAN ANGEL, BUT GOD HIMSELF was present in this King’s Royal Bedroom to PREVENT a questionable sexual activity that he might have enjoyed with Sarah! BTW, Abimelech means “my Dad is the God Moloch” --not related to any Bible God. But neither the Bible God in all his bragging of “omnipresence” nor a Guardian Angel was anywhere to be seen near Eve or the untouchable fruit tree to prevent that the WHOLE HUMAN RACE that God loves so much go to be tormented for ever and ever in a sulfuric burning Lake of Fire! It doesn’t take too many neurons in anybody’s brain to figure out that the Bible writers were a bunch of wanking perverts creating a God so full of Holy Crap! It takes years of Christian schooling to keep Christianity still marketable today! The top Clergy is fully aware of all the Holy Crap that they peddle! They call it “difficult doctrines.”<br>   <br>  Genesis 20:2-6 …and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister."* (*incest [inbreeding] was ALLOWED, COMMANDED and ENFORCED all along by God’s Holy Law [Numbers 36:8]!) Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. But God came to Abimelech IN A DREAM ONE NIGHT* (*only God knows how many nights he was already watching him performing!) and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”* (*It would have been perfectly OK with God if Sarah had no husband! God didn’t question on whether the king was a married man or not! God enjoyed watching King Abimelech perform sexual numbers all along! God declared King Solomon the wisest man “EVER TO SET FOOT ON THIS EARTH”, too maybe because he watched him performing in bed with over 1,000 wives and lovers! By the Time God in the person of the Holy Ghost visit the Blessed Virgin Mary in bed he KNEW A LOT on how to please Earthly women!) Now Abimelech had not gone near her* (*at least that night, but he was aware that God was watching him perform all the time because of his lack of surprise!), so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?* (*God and this Heathen king discuss National Security issues in a dream!!! Too bad CNN or even FOX NEWS for that matter was not there to interview the king!) Did he not say to me, `She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, `He is my brother'?* (*can you imagine this holy man of God Abraham handing over his horny sister/wife Sarah without any objections for the unrestricted sexual pleasure of this Heathen king? BTW, Abraham already pimped his sister the same way before to the king of Egypt and he came out filthy rich out of it!) I HAVE DONE THIS WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND CLEAN HANDS."* (*It is like in the case of EVE, but here Sarah is a “sinful” sexy woman not an honest person like King Abimelech!) Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a CLEAR CONSCIENCE* (*as long as you do it with a clear conscience and clean hands you can’t possibly commit a sexual “sin” against this Bible God!), and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.”* (*Hey, what if God would have applied the same protection on Eve, wouldn’t the world be different today? Christians tell you that this God is very apologetic preventing Sarah from enjoying having sex with King Abimelech because she was going to be one of the ancestors of Jesus Christ! Practically all of Jesus’ ancestors are loaded of sexual escapades! It is all in the Bible scrip!) <br>   <br>  Compare the Bible writer’s sexual tryst story of King Abimelech and the Holy hooker Sarah to the story of King David and Bathsheba… King David and Bathsheba committed adultery of the kinkiest sort! She was a beautiful married woman. After Bathsheba was done having sex with King David she was probably drenched in royal sperm so she took a shower to "purify herself and be clean” (2 Sam 11:4). She became pregnant, too with a baby boy while God was delighted watching them perform in bed! No sin here because God planned for Bathsheba to be the ancestor of Jesus Christ through King David, not through her original husband! King David had to have Bathsheba’s husband killed for fear of reprisals! She was so happy to become King David’s favorite wife that she never grieved the death of her husband. God had their baby boy killed in a long and painful death so everybody in Israel can watch him suffer and learn a lesson!  The baby boy was born in adultery and had to be killed! Pregnancies as result of incest or rape are most sacred to the Christians today, but not so babies born in adultery to this Bible God… God hates them and he uses slow painful death tricks to get rid of children like that! <br>  <br>  Later on, Bathsheba mothered King Solomon another ancestor of Jesus Christ! Like in the case of King Abimelech this wanking God enjoyed watching King David performing in bed all along, but he didn’t do a thing to stop King David from having sex with Bathsheba. God didn’t stop King David from killing her husband, either because God loved King David, “a man patterned after God’s own heart”! So as long as you are a Christian you can get away with murder before God, but be aware of the long arm of the SECULAR LAW that supersedes any Law of God!<br>  <br>  The Bible God didn’t hesitate to stop the Hell bound Pagan King Abimelech from having sex with Sarah so he wouldn’t sin in spite of the fact that Sarah was a horny old lady age 90! Old Christian ladies take a cue that age is not a restriction as far as enjoying good sex goes! Later on God didn’t stop King David from having sex with Bathsheba and killing her husband! In the case of a Heathen King God feels that sex is wrong and it has to be prevented, but with King David sex and murder is OK… it is all within “God’s plan of salvation.”<br>  <br>  In due course God was “pleased” to send his ONLY BEGOTTEN SON to be totally beaten, tenderized and thoroughly marinated in Roman soldier spit so he can be nailed totally naked to the Holy Cross as a “spotless lamb of God taking away the sins of the world”. The Roman soldiers never dressed the genital area of their victims with a white diaper! Now Christians need to snack Jesus spit flavored Meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Holy Communion so they can go to Heaven when they die. Jesus was terrified about dying on the Holy Cross! He was sweating blood praying “to pass the cup!” He must have asked his Sadistic Heavenly Father, “Hey Dad, wouldn’t have been much easier to stop Eve from eating the forbidden fruit?”<br>  <br>  Hardly any Christian reads the Bible objectively… and the few who do don’t last long as Christians unless they have no scruples. Most preachers tell you that the Bible doesn’t mean what it says and that it needs to be read in a “King James Version” or interpreted by specially schooled “men of God” full of the Holy Ghost (and BS)! Isn’t it ridiculous to live in a Country that chose to be a Nation under this peeping-tom GOD? Christianity is about the most dishonest big business in the world!|`|z17o0p9Eaa	Without faith it is impossible to please God.<br>  <br>  Other than that....

But remember that the preacher is often talking about an ideal state for himself and others.

You have heard the eloquent speaker who has just finished say, "Let us cease from abusing each other," and he was very sorry that there should be always so much variance. <br>  <br>  But I think I should tell you a story that would illustrate the cause of this variance. A frog lived in a well. It had lived there for a long time. It was born there and brought up there, and yet was a little, small frog. Of course the evolutionists were not there then to tell us whether the frog lost its eyes or not but, for our story's sake, we must take it for granted that it had its eyes, and that it every day cleansed the water of all the worms and bacilli that lived in it with an energy that would do credit to our modern bacteriologists. In this way it went on and became a little sleek and fat. Well, one day another frog that lived in the sea came and fell into the well. <br>  <br>  "Where are you from?" <br>  <br>  "I am from the sea." <br>  <br>  "The sea! How big is that? Is it as big as my well?" and he took a leap from one side of the well to the other. <br>  <br>  "My friend," said the frog of the sea, "how do you compare the sea with your little well?" <br>  <br>  Then the frog took another leap and asked, "Is your sea so big?" <br>  <br>  <br>  "What nonsense you speak, to compare the sea with your well!" <br>  <br>  "Well, then," said the frog of the well, "nothing can be bigger than my well. There can be nothing bigger than this. This fellow is a liar, so turn him out." <br>  <br>  That has been the difficulty all the while. <br>  <br>  I am a Hindu. I am sitting in my own little well and thinking that the whole world is my little well. The Christians sit in their little well and think the whole world is their well. The Muslims sit in their little well and think that is the whole world.

836c6e132fae41eb80ae1909882962c3aa	I am a "Born Again Christian" and the Bible asks me to call on the Holy Spirit, to bring to light any sin that I have not asked forgiveness for.  The Bible states that the Lord "Convicts" us of our sin and then we can say "Yes Lord, I did that" and then ask for His forgiveness and He will.<br>  <br>  Satan on the other hand,  "Accuses" us of sin and this is his effort to get the Lord to throw us away, which He would never do.  Jesus Christ says "Yes, it true, He did that.  But I died on a Cross to cover that sin with my Blood and if he asks me for forgiveness, I will gladly give it to him".<br>  <br>  There is NO SIN that that the Holy Spirit can't find and bring into the Light.  There is only one "Unforgiveable Sin" and that is to Blaspheme the Holy Spirit.  In that case you defiantly acting against the Holy Spirit and not allowing Him to enter your heart, that is turning down Salvation through the Death of Jesus Christ on the Cross.<br>  <br>  Remember......your sin.....belongs to you and no one else, it is your very own burden to bear.  There is NO sin that God does not know about, but it is up to you to ask forgiveness for that sin.|`|93galWG1aa	If you are unaware it is a sin, it is still a sin, but your accountability is taken into consideration because you aren't aware.<br>  Our own law states that ignorance of the law is no defence.<br>  I believe a sin is a deliberate act on another that causes harm in any way.Or to yourself, so it's not hard to know what sin is if you ponder the action before acting on it.|`|2MfMyh4Maa	Jesus said on the cross, "Father forgive them for they know not what they do".  It is a sin but He forgives us our sins.  When we come to recognize our sins, we have to respond.  To accept His forgiveness and repent or not.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	In Christianity sin is based on intent. That is to say, you must plan to do it. Therefore, awareness is required. If you do not know what you are doing, it doesn't count. I fail to see how this answer does not seem fair to you. Would you feel responsible for breaking a law that you did not know existed? Would you go quietly into punishment for it, never arguing that you were totally unaware? So, if you are acting in good faith, having no ill will, and accidentally kill someone, you are not held responsible for murder (by God, I can't say what your government might say).|`|d9fb1dd645e4f5559a0eee63dd4ba255aa	I can only answer from my personal viewpoint and experience as a Christian.  I believe that I am constantly being forgiven for things I consciously or unconsciously do. It's the miracle of Christianity, that we can be so completely forgiven.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you love God, you loose the desire to do things you know will separate you from him.|`|oDxTEqdraa	Like, if a sin happens and you're alone in the forest and you didn't know it was a sin .... do you make a noise?|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	My belief states it's ok to be wrong, so I'm confident in being an atheist....|`|3IJNTuTnaa	This question is probably too heavy for Yahoo! Answers.  I think there is something to the idea that without intent there is no sin, and yet we still lock up (and in some US states, put to death) people who commit what would be considered grave sins without knowledge of what they are doing.<br>  <br>  And yet what is a sin?  For some people, it is working on the Sabbath.  If those people's religion is right, everyone you know who has ever worked the weekend is going to Hell... if only they knew. If, you know, they had ever heard of the Ten Commandments.  Not that the commandments actually specify which day is holy.  Hmmmmmmm.<br>  <br>  Anyway, though, the idea of sin is pretty complicated.  If you don't know you oughtn't to be punished, though that doesn't seem to be God's M.O. for most of the Bible.  It says the sins of the fathers won't be visited upon the sons, but it turns out that the sons keep getting whacked pretty hard all the time for the sins of the fathers.<br>  <br>  But let's try and separate "sin" from what actually happens in the Bible.  Let's consider it as a pure thing.  If it is (for example) a sin to wear the color red, is someone who wears red a sinner if they do not know?  I think the answer is no. But as the poster notes, are we rewarding ignorance?<br>  <br>  No, I think.  We are not rewarding ignorance. The person wearing the red shirt is not rewarded, he merely fails to be punished unless he is in an episode of Star Trek.<br>  <br>  The trouble with most monotheistic religion is that one is born into a state of sin, which can be washed away with a special water ceremony. But how deeply wrong is it that the single most innocent members of our society are already hell-bound?  C'mon.|`|146MzXiTaa	i'm no atheist. and i'm no christian.  <br>  i think of "god" as an all powerful force and creative energy, not a creator in human form with human emotion...i don't what you'd label me.<br>  <br>  in my opinion, everyone, no matter what you believe, knows when they've sinned.  when we commit a sin that little, tiny, frustratingly annoying (because we know its always right) voice we call our conscience lets us know we've done a bad thing.<br>  <br>  i think a lot of what the church considers sinful isn't sinful unless you make it a habit...

So I'll address both.<br>  <br>  First, you can pray, fast, pay a priest to beseech god for you 24/7 and that still will not stop natural processes.  Old age is unavoidable.  Terminal illnesses are exactly that - terminal.  There comes a point in time when all people die, whether from old age, illness, tragic accident, whatever, and no amount of praying will stop that.  <br>  <br>  If praying and fasting did stave off death, there would be a ton of immortal monks running around.<br>  <br>  For the second - if someone dies while praying and fasting, that's easy - just because you're praying doesn't mean you won't starve to death while fasting.  It's not like the nature stops and says, "Hey, this guy is praying while fasting, so he's excluded from the whole starvation death thingy."  If you go too long without eating, you keel, period.<br>  <br>  Death is a natural, and unstoppable, part of life.

I brought myself (walked) to the hospital and was met by my older sister who I had never met before. I left with her, applied for a job (same one I have now) long story short I received my GED and I am now in school for mortuary science. I am 22. Not all people who drop out of school are doomed to a life of failure. <br>  But saying things like that, especially when people know nothing about certain situations is cruel. There are some people who have valid reasons for not completing high school and for those people there are options. <br>  For those who want to quit because they just don't want to go and are simply too lazy, I recommend they stay and go to school. If they are on their own they certainly will not have enough self control and ambition to study for these exams on their own.

Philip had borrowed money from the Templars and wasn't in a position to pay them back. So, if he managed to get the Order dissolved, he wouldn't be in debt any more. Also, he hoped to get his claws into the treasure that the Templars were believed to have.<br>  In 1312, Pope Clement V dissolved the Templar Order; but he passed most of the Templar possessions on to the Knights Hospitaller. Hard cheese, Philip.<br>  Anyway, that's why Friday 13th is considered unlucky. All other theories are incorrect.|`|pI5jKfmaaa	It is only a phobia.

(meaning Friday), and dekatreís (δεκατρε??) (meaning thirteen), attached to phobía (φοβ?α) (meaning fear). This is a specialized form of triskaidekaphobia, a simple phobia (fear) of the number thirteen, and is also known as friggatriskaidekaphobia. The term triskaidekaphobia was derived in 1911 and first appeared in a mainstream source in 1953.[3]<br>  [edit]History<br>  <br>  According to folklorists, there is no written evidence for a "Friday the 13th" superstition before the 19th century.[4][5][6] The earliest known documented reference in English occurs in an 1869 biography of Gioachino Rossini:<br>  [Rossini] was surrounded to the last by admiring and affectionate friends; and if it be true that, like so many other Italians, he regarded Friday as an unlucky day, and thirteen as an unlucky number, it is remarkable that on Friday, the 13th of November, he died.[7]<br>  However, some folklore is passed on through oral traditions. In addition, "determining the origins of superstitions is an inexact science, at best. In fact, it's mostly guesswork."[8] Consequently, several theories have been proposed about the origin of the Friday the 13th superstition.<br>  One theory states that it is a modern amalgamation of two older superstitions: that thirteen is an unlucky number and that Friday is an unlucky day.<br>  In numerology, the number twelve is considered the number of completeness, as reflected in the twelve months of the year, twelve signs of the zodiac, twelve hours of the clock, twelve tribes of Israel, twelve Apostles of Jesus, twelve gods of Olympus, etc., whereas the number thirteen was considered irregular, transgressing this completeness. There is also a superstition, thought by some to derive from the Last Supper or a Norse myth, that having thirteen people seated at a table will result in the death of one of the diners.[5]<br>  Friday has been considered an unlucky day at least since the 14th century's The Canterbury Tales,[3] and many other professions have regarded Friday as an unlucky day to undertake journeys or begin new projects. Black Friday has been associated with stock market crashes and other disasters since the 1800s.[6][9] It has also been suggested that Friday has been considered an unlucky day because, according to Christian scripture and tradition, Jesus was crucified on a Friday. [10]<br>  On the other hand, another theory by author Charles Panati, one of the leading authorities on the subject of "Origins" maintains that the superstition can be traced back to ancient myth:<br>  The actual origin of the superstition, though, appears also to be a tale in Norse mythology. Friday is named for Frigga, the free-spirited goddess of love and fertility. When Norse and Germanic tribes converted to Christianity, Frigga was banished in shame to a mountaintop and labeled a witch. It was believed that every Friday, the spiteful goddess convened a meeting with eleven other witches, plus the devil - a gathering of thirteen - and plotted ill turns of fate for the coming week. For many centuries in Scandinavia, Friday was known as "Witches' Sabbath."[11]<br>  Another theory about the origin of the superstition traces the event to the arrest of the legendary Knights Templar. According to one expert:<br>  The Knights Templar were a monastic military order founded in Jerusalem in 1118 C.E., whose mission was to protect Christian pilgrims during the Crusades. Over the next two centuries, the Knights Templar became extraordinarily powerful and wealthy. Threatened by that power and eager to acquire their wealth, King Philip secretly ordered the mass arrest of all the Knights Templar in France on Friday, October 13, 1307 - Friday the 13th.[4]<br>  The connection between the superstition and the Knights Templar was popularized in the 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code, however, some experts think that it is relatively recent and is a modern-day invention.[9][3][8] For example, the superstition is rarely found before the 20th century, when it became extremely common. One author, noting that references are all but nonexistent before 1907 but frequently seen thereafter, has argued that its popularity derives from the publication that year of Thomas W. Lawson's popular novel Friday, the Thirteenth,[12] in which an unscrupulous broker takes advantage of the superstition to create a Wall Street panic on a Friday the 13th.[4]<br>  [edit]Social impact<br>  <br>  According to the Stress Management|`|NhqkAvOyaa	Read Friday The 13th-Origins, History and Folklore|`|kuDv4Yjpaa	as far as i know Jesus died on the 13th(good Friday)<br>  jason did too........

rFFYCmOGaa	The rapture doctrine was developed by a John Darby who mined the bible for vague verses and effectively "canonized" the spiritualistic ramblings of a 15 year old girl named Margaret MacDonald who had raised so much interest in a Scottish church pastured by rev Ed Young that his church  began experiencing tremendous growth in attendance.<br>  <br>  People began flocking to his church with hopes of perhaps hearing the girl utter some personal "revelations" since the girl was hailed as a "prophet."<br>  <br>  Darby brought and developed the teaching to the states and many other churches adopted the teachings when several religious writers, following the exegetical methodology of Darby of mining the bible for possible supporting scriptures, further fleshed out the new doctrine.<br>  <br>  CI Scoffield, a biblical theologian then published a study bible that cross referenced the teaching into what turned out to become the best selling study bible of all times, thereby spreading the teaching to the English speaking world at first, then translated into hundreds of languages worldwide.<br>  <br>  Dallas Theological Seminary was the first school which focused on the teaching and has since sent trained missionaries to every corner of the planet and it is no wonder that Hal Lindsey, himself a DTS graduate, became famous and wealthy with his publication of The Late Great Planet Earth during the 1970's.<br>  <br>  Charles Ryrie (another DTS graduate) published his own study bible which developed the rapture doctrine even further and established the idea of history being divinely divided into dispensations along with the literal millennial reign of Christ on earth after the rapture.<br>  <br>  The rapture doctrine is encased within what is currently known as "premilenial dispensationalism" or "premies" for short.<br>  <br>  Tim Lahaye has sparked great interest in the premie doctrine with his supernatural series of books and films.<br>  <br>  The best question one could and should ask anyone who believes the premie doctrine is whether they would have ever come to such conclusions after reading the bible in the absence of having been taught it beforehand.<br>  <br>  Most cannot even fathom it but the evidence of millions who had previously read the bible without having reached such conclusions is overwhelming to say the least.|`|yB0nVXfWaa	We can tell you these things till we're 'blue in the face' but you still won't listen - otherwise why would you have asked already such a 'barbed' question?<br>  <br>  That's why I usually pass over questions like these, when it's pretty evident that the asker just wants more people to agree with his views.  However, I feel sorry for JC Rules and co., being just a few voices up against a barrage of false ideas from the other contributors!<br>  <br>  The Word did say there would come 'scoffers' in the last days! (II Pet.3:3-4).<br>  <br>  Firstly, this idea did not come from either John Darby's private opinions nor Margaret McDonald and her 'visions', it came when Darby recognized what the Word had been saying from the beginning, just as the Anabaptists recognized that the Word had been saying a believer should be baptized as an adult way back in Luther's day.  Luther first rediscovered that 'the just shall live by faith' out of the Word, then the Anabaptists followed, each recovering truths long lost to the church.<br>  <br>  Now, not every 'movement' is the recovery of lost truth from the Word, but it was so, I believe, with Darby.  Proof of that is to be found when you undertake a serious study of the subject in the Bible, for Darby - I repeat - did not get it from M.Mc., but he got it from his study of the Word, just as Luther and the Anabaptists did.<br>  <br>  Now, to argue for the Rapture takes a long time, because, just like the doctrine of the Trinity, you not only have many scriptures that point to this, but you also have to see the truth in the context of 'the whole picture'.  I can give you many scriptures (if you care to look them up and study them), but to put them into a framework to see where they are pointing to takes much longer.<br>  <br>  So, I will content myself with the scriptures which point to the Rapture, since that is what you ask for.  If you want to know more, then ask some more and we will be happy to try to explain further.<br>  <br>  Oh, I can only suppose that many Christians are 'buying into it' because of the pressure of the times and the increasing signs, and they're also realising that the Rapture teaching is not only 'a blessed hope' but it also makes sense in respect of the fulness of the salvation message.<br>  <br>  So, here's the scriptures :<br>  Matt.6:13 - could be : 'do not bring us to the time of trial, but deliver us from the evil'<br>  John 14:1-3 - the Lord's promise to return for his own.<br>  Matt. 25:13 - the wise and foolish virgins<br>  Roms. 1:18; 5:2, 9; 8:11,17-23, 29-30; 13:11-12<br>  I Cor.1:7-8 - why would they 'eagerly wait' for his revelation, if not for deliverance?<br>  I Cor.15:20-24, 51-58 - rapture with resurrection and glorification<br>  Eph.1:10, 13-14,18; 4:30, 5:6-7, 27<br>  Phil. 1:6, 10; 3:20-21<br>  Col. 3:4, 6<br>  I Thess. 1:10; 2:19; 3:13 (cf.Dan.7:13); 4:14(18); 5:9,11,23<br>  II Thess. 2:1<br>  II Tim.4:18<br>  Tit.2:13<br>  Hebr. 6:1-2; 9:28; 10:36-37<br>  Jas.5:7-9<br>  I Pet.1:3,5,13; 4:13; 5:1,4<br>  II Pet.1:19; 2:5-9 (cf. Luke 17:26-29); 3:9-10,12,14.<br>  I Jn. 2:28; 3:2-3<br>  Jude 21,24<br>  Rev.2:25; 3:3,10<br>  <br>  There are other scriptures, but, giving the above, I hope you get the picture.<br>  <br>  Now, most Christians do believe that the Lord is coming for his Church - because that's clear in Scripture - but they insist that the church must go through the Tribulation - ie. a 'post-trib' rapture.<br>  <br>  There are a few problems with this, but at least one obvious practical one.  If, when the Lord returns to earth at the Second Coming proper, he then just shortly before takes up the believers (and then turns right back round again and comes back to earth, I take it), we know that, after putting down all rebellion at Armageddon, next he must judge the nations at the 'sheep and goats' judgment.  Now, if the saints have already gone to him in the post-trib. rapture, where are the sheep now for him to judge with the goats?<br>  <br>  Not only that, since, when the Lord comes for us we will all receive glorified bodies, how will the saints, if they all become glorified at the end, be able to reproduce in the Milennial kingdom? - because the goats will have gone off to perdition.  How will the earth be repopulated, since all the 'human material' has been glorified?  It is impossible - unless there are some saints left on earth who do not get glorified before the Second Coming.<br>  <br>  Of course, you can deny the rapture and the Second Coming altogether, if you wish, but then you must follow the teachings of men and not what the Word actually says.  And, as regards his Second Coming - well, that's just about everywhere in scripture - twice as many prophecies than for his first coming!|`|yzRHAWNhaa	GOD and because it's in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Lu:17:34: I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.<br>  Lu:17:35: Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.<br>  Lu:17:36: Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.<br>  <br>  Take care. ? ? ? ?|`|vAdtlZDpaa	1 - A paster named John Darby who preached a philosphy called Dispensationalism in the mid-1800's, which was later promoted in the "Scofield Reference Bible" (p. 1917)<br>  <br>  2 - No idea, ignorance, I guess|`|QYu8KrXTaa	Hi, I believe this but it doesn't matter much.

It is a mid 19th century invention called Darbyism:<br>  <br>  "Darbyism" is an old-fashioned term for the modern school of Bible prophecy interpretation called "dispensational premillennialism." It comes from the Nineteenth Century English clergyman, John Nelson Darby, who first popularized many of the specific views on Bible prophecy that are now being taught by dispensationalists. The distinguishing and most controversial features in modern dispensational premillennialism are: (1) belief in a secret pre- seven year tribulation rapture of the Church, and (2) insistence on maintaining a careful distinction between God's purpose for national Israel, and God's purpose for the Church, in the divine plan of the ages--a distinction which many old-school Wesleyan theologians believed to be based on a truncated understanding of the unifying message of Scripture, new covenant holiness."'<br>  <br>  Details:<br>  <br>      <a href="http://www.rapturerevival.org/What%20Is%20Darbyism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rapturerevival.org/What%20Is%...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|R9zaR2mQaa	In 1830, in Port Glasgow, Scotland, fifteen year old Margaret MacDonald had a vision concerning the return of Christ.

yQ0OzEbZaa	Respect is something that is earned over duration of time.  It is earned by showing up on time, listening intently, displaying a solid work ethic, and being thorough in all that you do on a daily basis. <br>   Respect is also earned by going above and beyond what is expected of you without expectation of anything in return for doing it. This also means that you shouldn’t stand around bitching, complaining, and making statements such as, “That’s not my job.” It means that occasionally you will have to perform duties that are outside your scope of responsibility. <br>   During this age of the entitlement there is a common - lack respect for others yet expectations of respect from peers.  o_O|`|P2imcPEyaa	Try calling it an internship instead of volunteer experience.

Is it possible for you to just indicate the name of the organization and that you served there as a bookkeeper or accountant?<br>  <br>  It would not be a misrepresentation.  You did the work and you acquired the skills.  As long as you have references from these places who can answer for your contributions, then I think you have all bases covered.<br>  <br>  Your resume will pass under many eyes before it gets to the decision makers.  Don't let the shortsightedness of some HR drone seeing "internship" or "volunteership" on your resume cull you from the field before you even get a chance to play.

Any person who want's to explain belief in God to an atheist can make a compelling argument for God being energy, and compare it to the electron.  We can't tell you where it is, but we are pretty sure we can tell you where it's been.  Or compare the idea of God to the idea of the Big Bang.  Fiat Lux, (let there be light) really is the first thing that happened from a purely scientific stance.  We can still "see" the light (it's not in the visible spectrum, but we can measure the microwaves, etc.  So you could say God is light, God is energy, this super intense stuff upon which all Life, all existence is dependent.  I personally think that this is what Catholics mean by Holy Spirit, the fires from Heaven.<br>  <br>  But what most people really want is to be special, and to think of God in human terms, that God is just a really powerful human.  And that idea doesn't make rational sense, nor should it.  But people feel comfortable with an anthropomorphic God that is like them, just better.

wY8jE8HEaa	The fundamental teachings of Moses, Jesus and Mohammed (pbut) are the same. The first commandment given to Moses (pbuh) was the Shama or Kalima, as Muslims would have it. <br>  <br>  That Shama is: <br>  <br>  De 6:4 “Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is One LORD”<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Same thing was repeated by Jesus (pbuh), when a scribe came to him and asks him which is the first commandment of all? Jesus replied: <br>  <br>  MARK 12:29 And Jesus answered him, the first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is One Lord: <br>  <br>  In the Medina some Christians came to Mohammed (pbuh) and asked him, what is your concept of God? At this moment God sent a revelation: <br>  <br>  112:1 Say: He, God, is One. <br>  <br>  If we read these verses in Hebrew or Arabic, the root word ‘One’ in Hebrew is “Ikhad” and in Arabic it is “Ahad”. Aramaic, Arabic and Hebrew are sister languages. Therefore, Moses said “Ikhad”, Jesus said “Ikhad” and Mohammed said “Ahad”. Meaning “One”. <br>   <br>  If we are to believe in “ONE” God, than why God sent Moses (pbuh) with ‘Judaism’, Jesus (pbuh) with ‘Christianity’ and Mohammed (pbuh) with ‘Islam’? <br>   <br>  Judaism: <br>  If we are to follow the religion known as “Judaism” than this religion is not mentioned anywhere in the Law (Torah) (Old Testament) or Talmud or any other scriptures claimed by Jews to be the word of God. Nor did Moses (pbuh) in their sacred scriptures told his followers that their religion is “Judaism”. Where does this word “Judaism” comes from? Palestine was divided into tribes, one of them known as “Judea”. Therefore, the religion followed by the children of Juda in the land of Judea is known as “Judaism”. <br>   <br>  Christianity: <br>  If we are to follow the religion known as “Christianity” than this religion is not mentioned anywhere in the Bible. Nor did Jesus (pbuh) told his followers that your religion is known as “Christianity”. There are 73 books in the Catholic Bible and 66 Books in the Protestant Bible, But no word such as Christianity is found in them. The word “Christianity” is actually a derivation of people who after the ascension of Jesus (pbuh), accepted him as their Messiah. It was first used in Antioch.  <br>  Acts 11: 25-26 “Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and  when he found  him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year  Barnabas and Saul met with  the church and taught great numbers  of people. The disciples were called Christians first at Antioch. <br>  If Christians believe that Jesus (pbuh) was their Messiah and the Bible is the word of God, than they must realize that no where does God says in the Bible to be Christians or no where does Jesus say in the Bible to be Christians. <br>   <br>  Islam: <br>   <br>  The Arabic word Islam is derived from the root word Salam or Shalom in Hebrew, meaning peace. The word “Islam” means Submission to God. Therefore, Muslims are those who submit themselves to God. This word is not only found in the sacred scripture of Muslims known as Koran, It is also found there in the Bible.  <br>   <br>  JAMES 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  <br>   <br>  PSALMS 66:3 Say unto God, How terrible [art thou in] thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies  submit themselves unto thee. {(The Pagan Arabs were also enemies of God, but later on they submitted themselves to God (Became Muslims)} <br>   <br>  Of course, the word Islam or Muslim is mentioned many times in the Koran. Like in this verse:|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

The reason why each religion contradicts each other is because of competition. Each religion is competing seeing who is the better religion and they like to find areas in the other religions where there is a flaw or where it does not make sense. It all has to do with pride amongst each religion group|`|N8QLKpCMaa	b/c like every one mind does with an other !<br>  <br>  well, all religions are for man good & moral values based, people opt & think they  have best one.<br>  all are for good but every body thinks they have best one.<br>  <br>  People contradict more then religion do. <br>  people must see which religion goes best for human needs & values.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	May be due to complex.

I am one who has found this to be true.|`|qK1iEcVhaa	Actually most religion have the basic belief. Like moral value and being a good person.

1NNf5fNLaa	I can't speak for all the other languages, but Gujarati and Hindi are similar linguistically, but only to an extent. Their writing systems/alphabet are fairly similar, as are a lot of words and syntax. However, I don't think someone who is fluent in Gujarati and has never heard Hindi could understand simply due to the two languages similarities. <br>  <br>  Like the earlier post said, Hindi, at least in North India, is taught widely in schools and required at least to a certain level. Both my parents can speak Hindi, not because they know Gujarati, but because they were actually taught it in school.|`|giknlxZIaa	Yes, most of them know Hindi because of the similarity of these languages with Hindi. There are other reasons too, though:<br>  <br>  1. Hindi has a lot of visibility due to TV and Bollywood movies.<br>  2. In all these regions Hindi is taught in schools.<br>  3. The script of Nepali and Marathi is the same as Hindi. For other languages also, it is similar.

So does most things religious people say that they believe. More evil stuff happens in the name of Religion than politics. In fact if you look close they are the same thing. Scientology isn't more crazy than the rest of them. Buddhism was started as a philosophy more than a religion, but I imagine a flying white elephant penetrating his mother's side while she slept and then Sidhartha Gautama (the original buddha) was conceived like a virgin birth is not much crazier than a person being an immortal alien spiritual being, termed a thetan, that is trapped on planet Earth in a physical (meat) body. The scary part of that is when someone who can believe that decides that a thetan inside their neighbor is evil even though the rest of us can't see him and they need to vanquish him. Who is to decide?<br>   There are some people who can't chew gum and walk at the same time, and still others who already believe there are space transmissions being beamed at them and evil space warlords are after them and will take over their brain if they don't wear their aluminum foil hat. Do you really want to arm someone like that with this kind of information? <br>  I would imagine your real question is why don't I think like you do?

You can NOT become better ONLY in one area e.g. grammar, you MUST improve your skills in ALL dimensions of the language!<br>  <br>  Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!!

IKyITYICaa	Keep practicing.  Eventually you'll be able to watch your breath without interfering with it.  Don't try to force it.  It is the opposite of striving.  When you are relaxed enough, you'll be able to observe your breath without controlling it.  John Kabat-Zinn uses a metaphor for observing the breath. He says it is like approaching a wild animal that is sunning itself out in a field.  Approach it slowly, gently, and with compassion.|`|jTEB2cgsaa	Vipassna is not observing your breath but concentrating on breathing through your Navel!|`|8cb8912fd33cd93322ea14941b07b1f3aa	You don't need to worry. Just be mindful of the experience you are actually having. If, when you attend to the breath, it feels like you "can't let go of conscious control," just notice that. Just experience what that is like.<br>  <br>  The practice of Vipassana mindfulness of the breath is not so much to make the breath a particular way. It is more to connect with the way it actually is. So, if for now you notice a sense of "control" as part of your experience of breathing, just notice that. Just notice what that is like.<br>  <br>  You can invite a kind of relaxation and simply let the breath "breathe itself" and maybe at some point that will be how it is -- "breathing itself" without a conscious control or manipulation. But, again, if that is not what is happening right now, just notice what IS happening and rest your awareness in the way things are.<br>  <br>  Changes will come. And then just notice the change.<br>  .|`|yMVdKHhmaa	if your paying too much attention your not relaxed enough. you just want to be aware of breathing not totally conscious of it. it sounds like your trying too hard and by doing so your limiting yourself by your ego, your mind. <br>  just let go, imagine being in water trying to swim by thrashing about, we can't, we drown. but if we let go and relax we find the water supports us.

HA ha no seriously i think everyone has an psychic ability and intuition about things.. only thing is we have developed verbal language so well that we have shut off that part of the brain.. we dont use so much of our brains... yea my memory might be a part i dont use.. cant remember how much we dont use, but you see animals communicating in the wild natural state without speaking.. they sense things- watch your dog before a storm comes and you will see. I think we are moving into a time though where it is more acceptable to explore this freely without being burnt at the stake or put in psych wards.. scientests are studying the psychic ability all the time- the more open minded you are about it all the more you will see that you have the gift too. One very clear example is that everything on this earth is essentially made up of energy-atoms.. vibrations so it is very possible to prove scientifically that thoughts can travel from one to another- think 'we are on the same wave length' phrase.. there is more to the world than what we have created as mankind and incedently shutout our very natural states.|`|kDz9gcMuaa	No such thing as a special power more of a talent.

The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

How do you identify them? John 13:35 also John 15:18,19.  Acts 5:42|`|r8rykCkGaa	The true church of Christ is the body of Christ, and it's not an organization, but an organism.  It's a living part of Christ that is redeemed and will be with Christ forever.<br>  <br>  To identify them, they are walking by faith and they are seeking to know God's will for their lives and they are taking seriously all the things the Bible teaches.  They pray often and have a real relationship with Jesus Christ, they spend time in the word, fellowship with Christ, tithe, witness and love others as Jesus would love them.|`|e834d8db36b13de567ab48eb9cdaf267aa	To identify it, receive the things a church teaches and search the scriptures daily to see if it is true. (Acts 17:11)<br>  <br>  If the doctrine of a church is scriptural, found in the scriptures, then accept it.  If a doctrine is not found in the scriptures, reject it!<br>  <br>  Ask Bible questions and demand Bible answers (including book, chapter, and verse).<br>  <br>  Look for the church that is identical to the one you can read about in the New Testament. <br>  <br>  In Acts 17:11 there were some who were called "noble" because they received the words Paul preached and then searched the scriptures daily to see if they were true.<br>  <br>  That is the way we should examine religious doctrine today!<br>  <br>  The scriptures are useful for doctrine, correction of error, to check to be sure we are teaching and practicing the correct things, and to instruct others. (2 Timothy 3:16-17)<br>  <br>  Find the church that speaks where the Bible speaks, is silent where the Bible is silent, does Bible things in Bible ways and calls Bible things by Bible names.<br>  <br>  I believe such a church is the Church of Christ.<br>  <br>  We strive to have a "thus saith the Lord" for all we teach and practice as a church.<br>  <br>  I invite you to investigate the church. If the things we teach are found in the scriptures, then accept them. If the things we teach are not scriptural, then reject those things and let us know where we are lacking. That way we can either point to the verses of scripture you may not have previously considered or we can see if we are truly lacking and we can change to return closer to the Bible.<br>  <br>  At the links below are some articles that speak more about the church. I especially invite you to read the article at the first link. It is called "Come and See".<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ is the head of the church. (Ephesians 1:22-23) This being the case, the church of Christ has no regional, national, or worldwide “headquarters” on Earth that oversees the local congregations.<br>  <br>  Instead, each congregation goes directly to the Bible to see what should be taught and practiced. If the Bible is God's word, it should have authority to guide us in all religious matters. (Col. 3:17)<br>  <br>  We only want to be the church you can read about in the Bible in our name, practices, method of worship, organization, doctrine, and unity.<br>  <br>  We invite you to "Come and See".|`|3CXfqxcgaa	People have their beliefs, this what a lot of wars are caused because they think their religion is right.

These scholars and students have also noticed how the very same passages are also starkly different from each other in various details.<br>  <br>  Over the last three hundred years, the world of Biblical scholarship has exercised its collective mind in solving the riddle of why the gospels are so similar and yet so different.  The result of this laborious scholarly enquiry has resulted in the discovery that Matthew and Luke were dependent upon Mark and an additional source, termed “Q”, as the basis for their own gospels.  <br>  <br>  The two source hypothesis is generally accepted as the fundamental solution to the synoptic problem.  It remains the majority position within contemporary New Testament scholarship.<br>  <br>  The late protestant evangelical scholar F. F. Bruce writes:<br>  <br>  “The conclusion usually and I think rightly drawn from their comparative study is that the Gospel of Mark or something very similar like it, served as a source for the Gospels of Matthew and Luke…”|`|g7bQ9zSvaa	All the Christians!

Then in Assyria was found the Church of Antioch of which we also read of in the Book of Acts. Then in Egypt we find the 3rd "altar" being the Church of Alexandria founded by Mark, the writer of the 2nd gospel, today known as the Coptic Orthodox Church.<br>  <br>  3 things to bear in mind, <br>  <br>  The Bible says that the Church must have as its foundation the apostles, which all 3 do.<br>  <br>  They must preach the same faith as was first delivered which all 3 do.<br>  <br>  As Christ is God and Christ is the Head of the Church and the Church is the Body of Christ then God is the Head of the Body. As God is 3 persons in one, being God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit then it is consistent that the Body should also be 3, exactly as Isaiah states here concerning these Churches that were apostolicly founded, before the Church of Rome and all the divisions that sprung from her.|`|771e401b864ef2c6278719b487b80406aa	The true church of the Savior YAHOSHUA follows His rules.

0yTM98Odaa	I know exactly what you mean.  I don't like abortion but there are circumstances when it really is necessary.  Nobody can expect a 9 year old to have babies!  It would have traumatised her more and most likely killed her or at least caused her serious health problems.  I'm disturbed how many people seriously expected her to have the babies.  Also the Catholic church should be ashamed for their stance on this and how they have excommunicated people who did the right thing.  <br>  <br>  Wth don't they excommunicate the real Catholic criminals who should be excommunicated?|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	Since she was the victim of rape of course it is ok for her to have an abortion.  And yes, since she's nine years old, she should anyway.<br>  <br>  She is probably scarred for life from the trauma of all the sexual abuse, and ADDING to the trauma by forcing her to carry that baby to term would be cruel and inhumane.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	This poor girl's step father is the one that needs to be punished to the full extent of the law. 9 years old is very young to have children- however, that does not mean that the babies should have been aborted.

Why should  a poor young girl carry for 9 months the babies that were conceived out of rape? Why allow those 2 babies to survive?  It is the babies fault that she got pregnant right? NO- it is that horrible man. Give him the death sentence, not the babies.

I have seen no commentary on whether she could survive to viability.<br>  <br>  No nine year old is ready to raise children, but Brazil has a functional adoption system, and much like the US, there are waiting lists of parents who want babies because there are not enough babies to fulfill the demand.  So the chances are high these babies would be adopted.<br>  <br>  So yes, if she can survive to viability, I think she should carry them.  If her doctors determine she could not even endure the pregnancy that long, then the unborn children are already condemned and it is morally required to abort to preserve her life.<br>  <br>  In all cases, that which produces or preserves the most human potential is morally binding.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	There's no way a 9-year-old girl could have carried twins to term; at least with an abortion, the girl's life was saved.

If Satan had somehow tricked Christ into sinning, that would've been game over, so yeah, he put the chips on the table, why wouldn't he?<br>  <br>  Plus, God is in control of everything, Satan's temptation of Christ happened either because God directly wanted it to, or permitted it to.<br>  <br>  Great question! It still intrigues me. :D<br>  <br>  OP: Well of course he's clever most of the time, but blinded by hatred in the face of God's son who God loved? There's no way he kept his cool in that moment, I don't think so, nor any other time he went up against God. Yes he planned and plotted and applied logic to his foolish plan, he just didn't apply logic to the part where there's no way he could defeat the Almighty. It's not that hatred blinded him completely, just to the target of his hate.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.

Jesus is not God (noun) but He is the Son of God. If Jesus was God then He couldn't be tempted because the Bible is already clear that God cannot be tempted. Yet, Christ was tempted.<br>  Now some will try to argue that it was the human part of Jesus Christ that was tempted, not the divine part (in an attempt to say He is also God and Man). But it doesn't make sense because if Satan tempt the human part of Christ, the divine part of Christ couldn't be tempted and will be able to see it coming. Trinity doctrine is confusing.|`|QYu8KrXTaa	Satan wanted to destroy God's creation. Hence the attack on the messianic line and ultimately on the Messiah Himself. If Satan could get God in the Flesh to worship Him there would be no Saviour. But Jesus came to redeem a perfected kingdom to Himself not accept a defective sinful kingdom. We need to be thankful Jesus didn't take the easy offer. He went all the way to the cross for the joy of saving those who would believe him and be saved.    If you are seeking the truth read the Gospel of John, The book of Acts and Genesis. To be saved you need to<br>  believe Jesus died on the cross taking the blame and the punishment for your sin and ask Him into your life. Be<br>  willing to turn from sin with His help.

If I were God and someone else wanted me to worship THEM I would laugh in their face!  How could the creator of the whole universe ever be tempted to be untrue to himself in that way?  There simply would BE no tempation.<br>  <br>  Furthermore what did Satan tempt Jesus with?  "All the kingdoms of the world".  Why would this even be a temptation to Jesus?  Because his Father has already promised these things to Jesus. to allow him to rule them as king if he would be obedient to Jehovah and to follow and do the things that God has asked of him.<br>  <br>  Jesus wanted to rule these kingdoms so that he could do good for mankind since he loves mankind so much.  It was a temptation because he would have the reward that God offered him EARLY and not have to endure the things he knew he would have to endure.<br>  <br>  Now, if Jesus were GOD?  How would this be a temptation at all? he would already have authority over all the kingdoms of the world and could do as he wanted with them.  Yes, the Bible does tell us that the "whole world lies in the power of the wicked one" so they were Satan's to give.  But only because Jehovah is a God of true justice and was allowing Satan that authority temporarily to see if he could prove his point about being able to turn all men away from Jehovah.<br>  <br>  So if Jesus were God, there would be no temptation because at a word from his mouth these kingdoms would be his to begin with. Satan wouldn't have been offering him anything.  And if Jesus were God, then there would certainly be no WAY that he was going to worship Satan and Satan would know that.<br>  <br>  However the Bible does tell us that Satan managed to "drag a third of the stars" (the angels) with him in his rebellion.  He managed to tempt the angels into sinning (a large percent of them) when they looked down and decided to co-habit with men. So he must have thought he had a chance of tempting this son of God.<br>  <br>  If Jesus was tempted, and wanted the kingdoms, why didn't he accept Satan's temptation?  Because he knew the consequences.  He knew that he couldn't "rule" the nations by means of Satan's authority without becoming evil himself.  I'm reminded of the part in the movie "the Lord of the Rings" where the elf queen if offered the evil "ring of power" and she sees how it was a temptation to her, but how by taking that "ring" with a desire to become a good and beautiful and benevolent queen, she will instead become something evil and awful.  Granted that is a movie and a fictitious work, and no where on a par with the Bible, but the graphics of that scene where she sees in advance what sort of person she would become if she accepted the "temptation" reminds me of what must have been going through Jesus' mind at that point.  Horrors!<br>  <br>  He knew KNEW that only with God's favor can any good come out of anything.  He knew that if he rejected God and his requirements that he would become evil.  Can ANYONE even imagine GOD becoming evil?  It simply isn't possible.  But a son of God who choses to worship the devil rather than God, that is an EVIL creature indeed.<br>  <br>  Another question regarding the temptation by Satan, why does Satan say to Jesus "If you are a son of God...."  Why didn't Satan just say "If you are God" if that is what Jesus was claiming?<br>  <br>  He indicated in that question by his further quoting of scripture that HAD Jesus done what he was suggesting (throwing himself down off the battlement of the temple) that "he will give his angels a charge" that they would then rescue Jesus so that he wouldn't even "strike [his] foot against a stone".<br>  <br>  WHO would rescue Jesus?  The angels, at WHOSE command? God's.  So if Jesus is God, why does God have to command the angels to rescue him?  Why wouldn't Jesus himself issue that command? Better yet, why would he even need the angels to rescue him? surely he would have the power to rescue himself.<br>  <br>  The logic or illogic of those who believe the trinity is amazing.  They can twist any scripture, ignore any logic, ignore what the Bible says in SO many places and use spurious scriptures and a misunderstanding of the way some translators went from Greek to English and on these thin and weak strands base their whole argument while ignoring the vast body of scriptural and logical evidence to the contrary.
yz6qXwUiaa	Hannah, All I can say is I love the questions you have posted.  They are all so logical, so clear and so convincingly proof that the Trinity doctrine is false.<br>  <br>  It is so amazingly unbelievable to me how many scriptures and how much logic you have to use to convince people who believe the Trinity that it simply isn't true according to the teachings of the Bible and according to simple human logic.<br>  <br>  Yet look at them!  They will argue with the Bible rather than use their own brains to recognize the truth.  No wonder the Bible tells us that "Satan has blinded the minds of the unbelievers so that the that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through."<br>  <br>  Notice even here it never says that Jesus is God, but rather "the image of God".  Like him in many many ways, but an image, a reflection in the mirror is NOT you, but rather your reflection.<br>  <br>  Never the less, to those who have their minds "blinded" they can't see what is right in front of their faces.  It is sad really.|`|Xt9wIj4Iaa	The scripture doesn't say that Satan "tried" to tempt Jesus - it shows that Jesus was tempted.<br>  <br>  The scripture doesn't say that only Jesus' "flesh" was tempted - it makes no mention of his flesh at all.<br>  <br>  As you can see, some of these responses show how trinitarians allow their preconceived notions to alter their view of scipture.

Scrutinized to find no blemish, no unclean spot. Examined to prove what was within. (Love, the Spirit, whatnot) Disciplined in preparation for his sacrifice. <br>  <br>  We know that satan tried to tempt Christ, that is to say satan made arguments that would make ordinary men consider satan's offer, but Christ was always there with a snappy comeback from scripture. He knew exactly why he wouldn't even consider satan's offer because of what the Father taught him. With more than ten different words that could fit best for the Greek word, we can't simply choose one definitively without exploring the other options in context with the surrounding chapter, then book, then the bible as a whole.

The book of Hebrews said that He was tempted in all points, just as we are, yet without sin (Heb. 4:15).<br>  <br>  His resurrection was from flesh to spirit life.  A resurrected son of God cannot sin because they are composed of spirit (I John 3:9).<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AyPF2TFlaa	Hi Hannah, Jesus came as a man and had to endure all things as a man, he was not exempt from anything that men go through, so he had to have been tempted as we all are.<br>  Note he fought off temptation with the word of God!|`|QYu8KrXTaa	Hi, similar ques to the last one so I've copied it. Satan wanted to destroy God's creation. Hence the attack on the messianic line and ultimately on the Messiah Himself. If Satan could get God in the Flesh to worship Him there would be no Saviour. But Jesus came to redeem a perfected kingdom to Himself not accept a defective sinful kingdom. We need to be thankful Jesus didn't take the easy offer. He went all the way to the cross for the joy of saving those who would believe him and be saved. If you are seeking the truth read the Gospel of John, The book of Acts and Genesis. To be saved you need to<br>  believe Jesus died on the cross taking the blame and the punishment for your sin and ask Him into your life. Be<br>  willing to turn from sin with His help. Now live for Him by worshipping God, learning of Him in His Word the<br>  Bible and owning Him before others. May God bless you as you seek the TRUTH. nev|`|hQDapmICaa	YES, tell that to the devil!<br>  <br>  Peace!

Because of Separation of Church and State, this cannot occur because public schools are State funded, while Churches are primarily Privately funded, so Catholic Schools can do as they wish. However, they may try to demand a religious elective class, which many public schools have already adopted along with the extra-curricular "Bible Club". I've been to one of these even though I do not follow the Bible, from an intellectual stand point, you can actually learn a lot about faith and belief systems by these, not a bad thing to understand. Sorry for rattling on, but in any case, since the State funds Public Schools, and Separation of Church and State, the answer is no.|`|WHOOPgWraa	Some Christians can still afford private school and many don't want to change the public education system to a more greater focus on religion but just want overall improvements.|`|18a5331fc23bba2ade711a68568a2f8faa	And like atheists have never tried to influence the education system?|`|q6uyloYdaa	Haven't they already been trying to do that with teaching creationism?|`|vccz6IYHaa	They can't.<br>  The separation of church and state makes that impossible.<br>  They cannot impose religion in a public school,<br>  nor influence people towards any religion.|`|k9tQqJpUaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  Pretty soon, your children will have to learn about Creation in lunch. *Sarcasm* You act like we're a disease.|`|TqYZ0zikaa	I really hope so, that would be awesome if we do:)|`|NWnOTkwCaa	Americans hope so. We are tired of illiterates who can't read, make change, or pay attention.

If the knee-jerk, fundamentalist atheist fanatics on this forum are any indication of what public education is these days -- no understanding literature or art, utterly no clue about history, and a narrow, scleroticized view of science, without any underpinning from philosophy -- then the public schools need a drastic change.
bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	Joyce, I think that any animal that employs what is known as Batesian Mimicry is a very interesting specie. An example is the Burrowing Owl.  This smart little bird will hide in a hole in the ground, for example a hole or tunnel that was dug by a skunk.  While hiding in there he will make a hissing sound that closely resembles a rattlesnake hissing if one of his enemies comes near the hole. An enemy of a burrowing owl would be, for example, a bobcat. The bobcat has a lot of respect for a rattlesnake and the hissing sound emitted by the burrowing owl sounds like a formidable foe of the bobcat. The bobcat avoids sticking his nose into the hole because he fears what he hears. Have your grandson Google, Batesian Mimicry.  He will also learn of butterflies that fold their wings together and fall to the ground when a predator approaches.  With folded wings this butterfly looks like a dried leaf and when it hits the ground, amongst the leaves you can not tell him from all of the leaves laying there. You will find also that animals employing Mullerian Mimicry to be very interesting.|`|GkH5NoFyaa	We have a lot of lizards in our yard.

I hope you find what you are looking for. <br>  <br>  In Christ,<br>  - Isaac

Then they had 9:30 and 10:45 sunday school so that people could go at the time that suited them best.  So, I guess you could have it either way with this church.  They didn't use to do this - it used to be one sunday school time and one church service, but their membership got so big they had to divide up the times.  Or, heck, you could have service, school, and service again if you really wanted to!<br>  <br>  Sorry, I know you said for christians to answer this, but I used to be christian, so that sort'a counts, right?

04ccfd945c1091db3230b206a589f7cfaa	If it goes against what God says to us through the Bible then it is a false spirit. If you have a close relationship with God you are more able to discern between God's voice and the great deceiver.|`|oTehE3LIaa	To test the spirits comes from 1 John 4:1--"Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world."  There are so many out there who claim to have the truth, but are actually speaking lies.  So we need to "test the spirits" to see if they truly are from God or not.  And to do this, we need to see if they line up with Scripture.  We need to ask ourselves--is what this book saying, or fellow teaching, lining up with scripture, or is it non-sense?|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Read the Bible.  Allow the easily understood scriptures, to bring light to the hard to understand scriptures. <br>  <br>  For instance, John 3:16.  Read that.  Now believe it.  <br>  <br>  That simple understanding of an easily understood verse, should make it clear, for instance, that those teaching works for salvation, are wrong.  So "faith without works is dead", must not be referring to salvation from hell, for instance.  Rather, it is referring to getting rewards in heaven, and to helping others.  My faith doesn't help the starving.  It has nothing to do with whether I'm going to heaven or hell, it's not a salvation issue.  But most make it a salvation issue, thus making it contradict John 3:16.<br>  <br>  That's just one example.  You have to rightly divide the scriptures in that way, as you study them.  :)|`|ij5Sv6staa	Follow the guidance of the bible:<br>  <br>  1 John 4:1-3<br>  1Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2This is how you can recognize the Spirit of God: Every spirit that acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, 3but every spirit that does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world. <br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 11:13-15<br>  13For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles of Christ. 14And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light. 15It is not surprising, then, if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness.

FKxrJxbPaa	Depends, some do some dont. <br>  <br>  Usually i could tell between Black Americans and Caribbean people...dunno why tho i just can. Its less of a physical ting and more about mannerisms, expressions, etc. <br>  <br>  Also though it is true that Black Americans are mixed with considerable white ancestry, alot of the same can be said about West Indians, Latin Americans and even some African popualtions. Cabo Verde is a country in Africa with a mainly Mulatto population. <br>  <br>  <br>  Take some actors& rappers and other entertainment and public figures. 50 Cent, Wesley Snipes, and even Clarence Thomas could easily pass for pure African if they wanted to. At the same time Nelson Mandela is rather fairskinned and he's straight from the motherland. Although on average African Americans tend to be a bit lighterskinned than their African counterparts, in reality all Black populations tend to come within the same range of complexions, with africans being more clustered around darker complexions, African Americans and West Indians being roughly intermediate, and Afro-Latinos being lighter. <br>  <br>  <br>  There hasnt been a Black person from anywhere that looked so unique that I would be able to tell where they were from on the spot (except maybe for ethiopians& somalis) So for me, there's no clear cut answer to your question.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Whoppi looks pure black because she is, in fact, 92% black. Of course her black genes are dominant, theyre almost her entire genotype. Being 8% anything doesnt make you mixed lol<br>  <br>  <br>  Mae Jemison had slanted eyes and was caramel skinned...she didnt look "pure black" either lol. But the thing is, we're so accustomed to seeing blacks of many different colours that when we see people like her we dont instantly think she might be mixed with something. Most americans say Obama looks black because we typically consider lightskinned people to look black...but if you went to Latin America, a region with different racial classifications they would say Obama looks mixed.|`|eskZfVBkaa	They don't look too different than Black Caribbeans in England (mostly descended from Jamaica) but i agree that they tend to look different than the majority of Africans.|`|CEChcfKwaa	You really can't compare because not all black Africans look the same either, depending on the region they are from. Black people are diverse. Many Black Americans have white blood because of the rapes of slave women and racial mixing but some are as dark as some of our African brothers and sisters.<br>  <a href="http://rosemarysnews.files.wordpress.com/2008/08/bernie-mackpicby-mark-j-terrill-ap-file.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://rosemarysnews.files.wordpress.com...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kcchiefs.com/media/staff/cedric_smith.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.kcchiefs.com/media/staff/cedr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aolcdn.com/ch_bv/cedric-the-entertainer-335a-081007.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aolcdn.com/ch_bv/cedric-the-e...</a><br>  <a href="http://popwatch.ew.com/photos/uncategorized/2007/08/01/whoopi_l.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://popwatch.ew.com/photos/uncategori...</a><br>  <br>  Add:<br>  I didn't know that about Whoopie but it makes sense. A lot of slaves escaped and were captured by Native American tribes and many willingly went to live with them. <br>  <br>  The slave man York, who was on the Lewis & Clark expedition, eventually was freed and went to live with one of the Native American villiages they had passed through. Apparently they were very impressed with him and many of the women wanted children by him.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Oh definitely.<br>  <br>  We look different then Africans because MANY of us have mixed with whites and sometimes Native Americans, so we have some of their genes. The vast majority of Black Africans are pure Black or near pure Black (less than .5% another race).<br>  <br>  <br>  King of London- the Khoisians are considered a completely different race than black people. The Khoisoids are one of the 5 races of the world.<br>  <br>  (btw: Uganda is not North Africa.)<br>  <br>  Also, the only groups that are mixed are the Horn of Africans and maybe the Coloureds of Southern Africa (Most of them are not mixed, most are just of Malaysian, Khoisian, Indonesian and Malagsy, not mulatto. Mixing is and always has been looked down upon in South African society.|`|BQXg09m9aa	It all depends on their ethnic background. I do not say your typical African American, because black come in all different types of looks, personalities, morals, and etc.<br>  <br>   But, yes, if you have a different background then just West African, then why wouldn't you look different?<br>  <br>  Some black have Native American, some have European, some have BOTH! But, overall they still end up being labeled as "black". I guess because it's more dominant.<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that you have to have A LOT of white, or native, or asian, or whatever in you to show up looking like BOTH, as opposed to just black because, the black gene is dominant.|`|JAZnQJPHaa	I think this question is way to broad and generalised for anyone to give an answer. All cultures and ethnic groups are unique in their own way, there are some physical/genetic  traits which are commonly expressed in different groups of people. The term African-American seems to refer to people who have some African ancestry and whose family has lived in the US for several generations. Over that generational time, people marry others outside of their own cultural ethnicity, so there may me more variations in physical characteristics. I child whose mother say, is from Vietnam, and whose father is African-american, will still be referred to by others as African american. Take Barack Obama and Tiger Woods for example. Both are labelled by others as 'African-American', yet they both have a diverse cultural heritage. As people indigenous to African countries have cultural and social kinship systems different from western countries, you expect less cultural variation in their ethnic origins. <br>  <br>  I still think this question is very difficult, as what you are asking infers notions of race, and as such you need to understand that there is no deficit in a difference of physical appearance. We are all humans being!|`|pZVEBEmLaa	You're right, Africans-Americans do look a bit more modern but that's probably because of all the makeup and stuff and the different weather.|`|MeYILJeSaa	Mmm..well, yeah. I don't think it's just African Americans though. <br>  I think people from different countries look different just because of the way they dress, act, etc.|`|yjctHwzAaa	nope cant tell from those pictures..africans and african americans look exactly the same..and obama has a completely different skin tone than michelle..|`|u2BVwAKNaa	Yup<br>  Why??<br>  <br>  cause the slave owners use to rape the female slaves, so many African Americans have some Caucasian in them|`|n1Ga3kdYaa	obviously. african americans definitely look different than pure africans. we are of mixed heritage.|`|8auEgQf2aa	The ones I see on TV and the ones Ive met dont look like West and Central Africans most the time but I know there are some ie Mary J Blidge looks Nigerian, 50 cent ghanian, Whoppi Golberg and some others have very similar looks to some of the people of west African nation.

Yes he does look mixed but has predominant african features.  His wife and him look completely different but they are both very attractive people.  Yes I think American Blacks look different than say Djimon Honsou or Africans from Africa. This I think has everything to do with them probably being mixed in this country through relationships and rape that happened during slave days.|`|oBesPS6Uaa	----------------------------------------...<br>  STOP<br>  <br>  The proper social/historical definition for African American ancestry group refers to the descendents of Americans slaves and free American blacks who trace their history, heritage, and culture to the United States.

Its common for black immigrants to refer to themselves by their national origin. (i.e. Nigerian, Ethiopian, Senegalese, etc), only if one can trace any part of the family tree to 1865 do they become genuine African American.<br>  <br>  With Love,<br>  <br>  African American Man|`|KEVdZchtaa	Yes, I think they look a little different, maybe because from the slavery days when they were raped they got some white in them.|`|EAyzCH3Kaa	yup|`|8DsbSALzaa	YES|`|Lc5FtItDaa	They aren't black.

When I got to the top of the stairs my Aunt was there asking me if I heard something and I said I think it was chris. We heard it again andwalked towards his bedroom door...it sounded like he was right at the other side of the door crying. we opened up  the door expecting to see Chris standing there and right up until we opened the door we could hear crying. as the door opened we looked acroos the room and he was asleep in his bed. later after doing some background stuff we found out a child had died there and other people who had lived there could hear it also. It was on the news later that year as one of the most haunted homes in the Quad cities area. No joke.

pus08YEOaa	Lent isn't Christian, it's Catholic.<br>  Easter isn't technically Christian. It's an adopted pagan festival of spring and fertility. That's why there are eggs and marshmellow peeps! Easter as you probably know it is a capitalistic thing, just like Santa Claus at Christmas.<br>  Christians celebrate the death (Good Friday) and ressurection of Christ.<br>  Fasting is a purity rite. Not all Christians fast. Lent represents 40 days Jesus spent in the desert rejecting Satan. Most Catholics just give up some vice instead of fasting.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	I think you mean Roman Catholics.

It is only recently in the resurgence of theologically primitive American fundamentalism that we see religion objecting to facts, data and scientific progress.<br>  <br>  There is almost no such conflict in the rest of the developed world (with small exceptions for reproduction in some heavily Catholic nations like Ireland).  It is solely the last desperate death struggle of the cornered rat of American protestant extremism.<br>  <br>  <br>  You are correct in that nothing in this science that is attacked is even TRYING to "disprove" gods, let alone succeeding.  Scientists tend to be a bit more rational and let the universal metaphyscis stay out of their research and just stick to facts.  If fundies were not paranoid, intentionally misinformed, and fond of strawmen, there would be no conflict or debate between the two any more than there is conflict between, say, embryology and musicology.|`|ZSOxZFLbaa	From the people who claim that they have the only religion, and that IT says that we must take the Bible completely literally, and that the worlds was created in 6 days of 24 hours, just like they are today (they refuse to comprehend that the Bible was not WRITTEN in English, therefore there is some room for translation issues) and that was 5700 years ago, and THAT is Science, and should be taught as such in the public schools.<br>  |`|3Ophdo9raa	I guess people question where we came from. Who or what created us? Who made DNA? It's obvious there's something inexpicable out there (or within us) greater than ourselves.

If you stole something or damaged someone's reputation or did other direct harm to them, then restitution is a necessary part of repentence. You can't say "Lord I am truly sorry for stealing that money", and keep the money. Or say "I am sorry I lied about him and got him into trouble", but fail to tell the truth. In such cases you must do your best to undo the harm you have done.

As the environment changes for these species, including the foods they eat and the air they breathe, they develop mutations.  This is why some worms are asexual and require no partner to reproduce, whereas some worms do need such a partner.  The mutations that begin to complicate a species' DNA also contribute to it developing "male" gender identities.  Even you, at the moment of your conception, were "female" until the DNA of your individual make-up allowed the introduction of male homones into your developing zygote.<br>  <br>  Go to the link posted below and take that information to your local public library - tell them you really want to listen to the course.  It's not really a course about evolution (if you want that, the subject matter is very long and you will require a lot of effort and intelligence to accomplish it); it's a course about the advent of evolution and the history of the debate between the pros and cons of the argument.

So, as long as we are speculating, it is possible that the first woman produced the first male asexually.|`|2a83d387aec1bc6928d92060e8ac8eaeaa	Evolution has never involved asexual reproduction on the mammalian level. However, if you are asking how the first male and females organisms came to be, understand that asexual reproduction, or some transitional phase between asexual reproduction, and sexual reproduction could have occurred before the first set of male and female organisms could have formed. Thus it would have been possible for some organisms to reproduce asexually, while also reproducing with others of the opposite sex. <br>  <br>  Evolution is the result of mutations in the gene pool, most of which is useless or deleterious, and few of which is advantageous to survival and reproduction. Those mutations that are beneficial, and survive the naturally culling of nature, reproduces and become more prominent within a population. Evolution does not require that both male and female be genetically identical in order to reproduce. Hence a male, within a particular gene pool, could exemplify a positive genetic trait, while a particular female of that population did not. If they mated, and that advantageous trait of the male happens to be dominant as opposed to recessive, then the offspring will also express that trait. This is, in a nutshell, how evolution works. <br>  |`|O1xSW736aa	Male and female are not separate species.  Many species, particularly bacteria, plants and fungi reproduce asexually.  That means they don't have separate males and females. Some species such as aphids can reproduce both asexually and sexually.

nkMbQFv7aa	It is faith in Jesus Christ that helps you through the Lenten season. Orthodox Christians start 2 weeks prior to the beginning of Lent. The first week which starts after Meat-fare Sunday they abstain from meat and fish and the second week which starts after Cheese-fare Sunday they abstain from all dairy products including the meat and fish from the first week.When Lent starts they are in full fast. No meat,fish,dairy products,olive oil or wine. Jesus gave up his life for us and it is through our faith in him that we should give up something for him. There is a great deal more to this than what I have written but this is just a very very small summery of why we have Lent.|`|evStsOQiaa	God wants you to give up your comedy act for Lent.|`|0PvpGjSqaa	can you give  up your life?|`|lXDAhSL4aa	If your faith is anything other than faith in Jesus Christ, then YES.
JAZnQJPHaa	The oldest anthropomorphic sculptures/ carvings, dating from the Paleolithic, are representations of what are referred to in the literature of "Venus" figures, a mother goddess, an earth goddess. Cave paintings, such as the most famous at Lascaux caverns, depict the animals of the hunt, and one particular incribed figure is often interpreted at a shamanic figure. We have no names for these 'gods', nor any real notion of what indo-european beliefs were in the paleolithic era, however there does seem to be some belief in an afterlife, or a journey beyond death. This has been found in Homo-sapien and Neanderthal burials, where the presence of pollens from flowering plants have been found with burials, (indicating the placing of decorative plants on a deceased persons grave) and in several instances bones of the dead were painted with red ochre. The earth mother/ venus type figure has a widespread distribution in antiquity.|`|hiCSVwchaa	Probably a sun god.|`|PppQI2Uwaa	this may help<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307002213AA5jg7M">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|S7XZ6KCpaa	probably various animistic vague spirits of natural phenomena.|`|98db094f444e5154c3fcacd3e51e23c2aa	probably the childs father.

You didn't create robots, you created a creature that could think for itself.<br>   <br>  You realize that for your creation to function perfectly, thus called perfect in your eyes, they would have to willingly be obedient while still enjoying and acting within the peramiters of freewill.

You have made the perfect environment for them, and given them their every desire, a beautiful earth with abundance of things to explore and enjoy plus you have given then every tree with delicious fruit for them to eat to their hearts content. You have even let them name the animals you created, and  have given them a mate of their own kind to enjoy, love and procreate.<br>  <br>    Do you continue giving them everything they want?  NO, because they are not utilizing their free will!<br>  <br>   You do not know yet if they appreciate all that you have done for them. Everything up until this point has just been given to them.

They have these abilities but have not been used.<br>   <br>  You can only test these qualities if you withhold something that they may long for, to see how they react.

AA11440601	Catholicism includes a rich tradition of both informal (in our own words) and formal prayer just like our Jewish forefathers.<br>  <br>  The Church teaches "the memorization of basic prayers offers an essential support to the life of prayer, but it is important to help learners savor their meaning." In other words, the Church emphasizes that formal prayer should not be mindless lip moving but instead a formal expression of clearly understood and heartfelt sentiments. <br>  <br>  The verse in question reads, in the King James Version, "But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking." <br>  <br>  Jesus is not talking of the repetitious prayer of the Jews in which Jesus would have participated in and who He would not call heathen.<br>  <br>  The important Greek word here for "vain repetitions" is battalogeo, or babbling. The heathens had a magical perception of prayer and thought the more they babbled to their gods, the more that that god would respond. I Kings 18:26 is an example of this: <br>  <br>  "And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered."<br>  <br>  Then, two verses after the warning in Matthew against "vain repetitions," Jesus gave us the "Lord's" prayer, which most Protestant Christians pray with no qualms about praying "in vain." <br>  <br>  The same command in Luke 11:2 reads: "And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father..." -- "when you pray, say..."<br>  <br>  In addition, Christ prayed in repetitions:<br>  + Matthew 26:44: "And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words." <br>  + Mark 14:39 reads: "And again he went away, and prayed, and spake the same words." <br>  <br>  The angels pray repetitiously:<br>  + Revelation 4:8: "...and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come." <br>  <br>  God commanded Moses to tell the Israelites: <br>  <br>  "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart: And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up." (Deuteronomy 6:4-7)<br>  <br>  The Psalms are a collection of prayers and litanies, which were prayed formally in the Jewish synagogues and early Christian churches, are still prayed in synagogues and Catholic churches today -- and were even prayed by Christ from the Cross. <br>  <br>  The liturgy of the synagogue was (and is) filled with repetition and formalized prayer. Christ said "use not vain repetitions, as the heathens do.” Were the Jews heathens? Jesus also prayed in the synagogue in this way.<br>  <br>  They prayed (and still pray) the sh'ma twice a day and, in their liturgy, the Shemoneh Esrei, the Kaddish, the morning blessings, the Aleinu, etc. Check out a Jewish siddur (missal) sometime; does it look more typically Protestant or Catholic?<br>  <br>  Hymns are prayers. Is it "vain" to sing "Amazing Grace" more than once? <br>  <br>  Catholics do not babble but pray from the heart in formal and informal prayer.<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, part four: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt4sect1.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt4s...</a><br>  With love in Christ. |`|bXeHr69Vaa	we were always told that jesus said,  three of the most important things are prayer,fasting and almsgiving, if you pray and pray you will be answered, all prayer is , is communicating with god|`|LQQAQDkIaa	I'm Catholic, and I have seen one Protestant prayer repeated here a hundred times.

They can follow any religion that does not have a god and there are a lot of those!!<br>  <br>  Like BUDDHISM – Religious teaching from Buddha and his followers that by destroying greed, hatred and delusion (the cause of all suffering) man can attain perfect enlightenment!!<br>  <br>  Add christians and muslims together and they amount to just under a third of the world population the majority of the rest is made up of atheists and religions without gods!!

If she was pregnant, I know she would not have an abortion- but if she chose to, she would know that I would not approve- however, not approving does not mean that I would disown her, or love her any less.  Do you realize that all abortions today are safe, even though they are legal.  I have counseled many women that have had abortions that had physical problems. However the highest risk is emotional.  That 18 year old can live for the rest of her life with the guilt and shame, she did not realize that she was going to have. May I ask you a question?  Does "a mass of tissue" have a beating heart at 3 weeks after conception? Of course not, a baby does? <br>  Of course I would want my daughter to be safe, however, if you really realized abortion is not safe.  It can injure the girl/woman to the point they may need other surgery to repair the damage.  Sometimes the women that have had abortions, miscarry later, or cannot even get pregnant when they want too. This question is playing on people's emotions due to the fact we would not want our daughter's hurt- however, that does not negate the fact that abortion is wrong, and there is a baby inside the womb that is developing.  Just because the baby is not fully developed does not make it have no life.<br>  <br>  EDIT- Wolfheart- "Abortion has lowered crime, poverty and unwanted pregnancy. Not mention it gives a woman the right to her own body (yes it is HER body. At this stage the fetus requires to leech off the mother, she shouldn't be required to feed a glorified parasite.)"-  abortion is a crime of the worst kind- it has taken the lives of 4,000 babies a day in america since Roe V Wade.  NO it is not her body- that baby has a heart that is beating.  Just because it could not survive without the mother, does not mean it does not have life.  Let us say that the baby is born and left alone- will it survive then? NO, it would die - so that argument is wrong as well- or we could say, if we chose to let the newborn baby die, it would still be the choice of the mother, because that baby could not survive without someone caring for it.  Sorry- does not compute.|`|lJUyhMceaa	Lets follow your line of reason all the way out.  If being "safe" is the criteria for making murder "legal", then why not legalize child abuse....at least then we can Control it and make it "safe" for them.<br>  <br>  Your comments show that you have no idea what your talking about.  Abortion is not "safe".  Every time one is performed an Innocent baby dies.  That don't sound "safe" to me.<br>  <br>  And statistics show that one out of every three women that have an abortion suffer mental trauma for years, and one in every eight suffers physical trauma for years and one in every 700 suffer life threatening medical complications.<br>  <br>  This doesn't even bring into count the dozens of women who die each year as a result of getting abortions.  And these were abortions of "convenients",  not abortions done because the womans life was in danger.<br>  <br>  This does not sound very "safe" to me.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	I would support my daughter's choice whatever that choice may be...  <br>  <br>  At the same time I am very grateful she can go to a clean, safe and regulated medical facility to have the abortion rather than having it in a back alley under questionable circumstances that could possibly put her health and life in danger due to infection etc....|`|hYzfzu9yaa	Yes.

(59) If one is immersed into the water and comes up again without having accepted anything, and says “I am an anointed one [“Christian” in Greek]”, he has borrowed that name at interest.  But if he receives the spirit of the Pure One, he possesses the gift of the name [Yahuwshúa`].  He who has received a gift does not have to give it back, but of him who has borrowed a loan at interest, it will be reclaimed.  <br>  <br>  Any other name than Yahuwshúa` will not work, and one being immersed into another name has not accepted anything real.<br>  <br>  The Restoration to the Truth in His Image: either through obtaining His names or having them conferred post-resurrection.<br>  <br>  "72. (67) The Truth has not come naked to this world, rather wrapped in symbols and images, since this (world) could not accept it otherwise.  There is a birth from the First [Yahuwchana′n’s Glad Tidings 3: 3] together with an Image born from the First.  It is indeed necessary to be born from the First through the Image.  What is the resurrection? It is fitting that the image should rise up in His likeness.  It is appropriate to enter the bridal chamber with His Image in the Truth.  This is the restoration.  For it is appropriate to be born not only from the Words (names) of the Father and the Son [Ya-hwéh Yahuwshúa`] by the spirit of the Pure One rather than also to be born from those themselves.  But whoever is not procreated of them, if one does not obtain them (the names) for themselves, the name of anointed one will also be removed from him [v. 63]!  But later, these names are to be conferred and one shall accept them [TsphanYa′hu 3: 9, Ychezq?′’l 37: 13] in the aromatic anointing that comes [Yahuw’?′l 2: 28-29], from the power of the gallows-cross.  This power the delegates called:<br>  “The right or the left” [Yshá`Yahuw 30: 21],<br>  since this one is no longer a “Christian”, but an anointed one.  73.

The church teaches that only those that accepted Jesus and the law of God in a special way would be saved but acknowledges that those people that without the knowledge of the Church and Jesus but that practiced the natural law also God will surely have mercy on them too. God above all is Love and Mercy but is infinitely just, i.e., gives to each one what one deserves.|`|NCRfZRopaa	According to some, yes. To other Christians, no. However, most believe it is up to God to decide and not for us mortals.|`|h1eBWehMaa	that is not for us to decide.

Peace&Love be with you...~M~|`|5M0FBU89aa	I don't know anything about witchcraft, but I believe that spirits find you.<br>  <br>  My story:   <br>  A couple years ago, I decided to scattere my Dad's ashes at what I believed was one of his favorite places. <br>  <br>  The previous night, I had his ashes on the table, lit a green candle (his favorite color), had pictures if him on the dining room table and ate a dinner.  My last dinner with my Dad.  I also composed a letter on nice paper and sealed it with sealing wax and put it on the table.<br>  <br>  Next day:<br>  I googled the address, and entered it into my Garmin, and away my wife and I went with Dads ashes in the back seat (it was the 10th birthday, after his death).<br>  <br>  Anyway, The Garmin led us NOT to the place we programmed it to - but the local Golf course (my Dad loved to watch Golf). We thought that was strange, so we called someone near our "target" location, and got directions (it was five miles away).<br>  <br>  So we performed a little ceremony where I read the letter to him, saying I forgive him for the pain he caused in my life. We ate lunch, drove home and didn't think much of it until we got home and I was looking in my Dad's scrapbook, and his College Graduation picture was taken right there at the Clubhouse door where the Garmin unit said "You have arrived".... It was weird.<br>  <br>  Some Other things;<br>  1. it was a *very* old section of a coastal town - no construction was done for at least 30 years.<br>  2. No aerial obstructions.<br>  3. My Garmin maps were up-to-date.<br>  4. My Garmin has never been *that* wrong - it steered me into a parking lot once when it thought it was a street corner, but that's about it.<br>  <br>  So the long and short of it:  <br>  1.  I think they can manipulate elecronic devices.<br>  <br>  2.  They have to be strong spirits not layed to rest that might have either caused great good or pain in the material world and therefore are not allowed to pass on.  This is why your two answerers prolly say "BE CAREFUL".<br>  <br>  3.  You need to have a strong connection with the spirit you are trying to reach.<br>  <br>  4.  You probably need something that is a part of their physical being - a lock of hair, ashes, or something.<br>  <br>  Experts on the meta-physical or non-believers may think this is a load of crap - but it's what I believe. It was a weird experience, and I don't want to do it again.  As far as seances go - I'd only do something like that with someone who knows what they're doing - and even then, I wouldn't do it, unless there was something REALLY compelling that happened with the deceased.|`|d3VV4b6vaa	its a thing called 'automatic writing' (look into it more) where they will write through you. it can be done with a pencil to start with and soon you can use a computer. usually start off with a prayer (of your intentions and who to contact) and shield yourself with a white light. ask whoever a question..and listen.  its hard at first and it might seem like you're making it up, but once your hand starts to 'push' the words out (like the way a ouiji board moves) you will be convinced.|`|ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	First, Ouija Boards. The boards have no power or "spirits." The Planchette has no spirit, but it is an amplifier of a person's talent. However, many people make it an ego game where they pretend a spirits calling by moving the planchette themselves to awe or frighten another.  <br>  <br>  If you do have either of the talents of a clairvoyant you may be able to call spirits with the correct rituals and environment. The calling may take anything from 12 hours to a year. Spirits can be called or summoned, but they cannot be forced to the seance or a ouija board. <br>  <br>  Most of what is written about seances and Ouija on Answers is what I and some of my peers call "look at me" staged magic, not true Magick or Talent.|`|24H5tznkaa	You can try automatic writing. You basically write down a question and then let your hand relax, clear your mind and write whatever comes through. It is an effective way of spirit communication. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't summon a spirit. If you are wishing to speak with someone in particular then request there presence. <br>  <br>  You can call on the Angels to protect the channel (the communication line) from any negative and/lower level entities.<br>  <br>  Some people (like me) have the ability to channel. I can hear them answer me. It's not out loud...more like a thought I can hear but it's not in my voice and it's coming from above and outside of me. <br>  <br>  Here is a very good site with info on automatic writing:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/automatic_writing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.crystalinks.com/automatic_wri...</a><br>  <br>  It is a good way to get started and it tends to open you up to channeling. <br>  <br>  There are negative spirits in the spirit realms but there are also a lot of good, high level being that are there for you. Be sure to request their assistance in protection and communication.|`|b1XStRqtaa	Bad idea.  Can be dangerous.  But if you are bound and determined to do it, you aren't suppose to joke around while doing it.  It's not a game for inebriated people to fool with.  Two people with their fingertips on the planchette and one asking the questions that you already have prepared and jotting down the answers. That is how the instructions are worded.|`|2V4JHa1Saa	evp is a most common way but that is dangerous if you do it to much cause it opens a portal for them to attatch them to you and become posessive and sometimes attach people you are close to just to keep you alone to have you to themselves so please be carefull with anything u plan on doing

Almost every teen experiences this, it is one of the most normal things about being a teenager.  I'm out of high school but I still feel that way when I'm with a certain group of people that I don't have much in common with, although I'm comfortable almost anywhere, now.  When I was a teenager, I had a lot of friends and was popular, but I still felt that way.  I started growing out of it around 18 or 19, when I went out into the real world where you are bogged down with work and bills and don't have so much time to focus on it.  Just be yourself, give it some time and realize you're not the only one!  Girls are just as awkward and they'll still like you!|`|AA11198190	You are both self conscious and lacking in a bit of self esteem.<br>  When you are out and about,just be yourself and don't let these thoughts creep into your mind.The more you are worrying about what other people are thinking the worse you feel.<br>  l think perhaps you are over dramatizing the situation and it may not be as bad as what you think.|`|IDbZ1E6Haa	I used to feel that way too.<br>  It's because you're insecure. If I were you, I'd start, well, thinking more highly of yourself. If they don't like the way you're standing, think to yourself "I don't care. It doesn't matter to me if I look awkward." <br>  Usually, the more awkward you feel, the more awkward you look.|`|ZYCRkgawaa	If you can afford it, contact an acting coach to give you some lessons in positive movement--how to stand, walk, sit. This is all basic stuff that some people do naturally and others don't. OR you can get a book on body language and train yourself from the pictures and descriptions how to be more forceful and have presence,<br>  <br>  Another person that might help is a theater teacher if you are in high school or a speech teacher. These people are likely to know how to change your self image which will improve the way others see you. <br>  <br>  Almost every person in high school is unsure of him or herself. They may hide it but even the most gorgeous person thinks something is wrong with them--maybe something you can see, maybe not. <br>  <br>  Later in life you realize that you only have so much control over your looks and you surrender to it and feel less bad about it.|`|lcjPq1Bpaa	i used to have the same thing, just do this: always be with your friends, if you are not, make sure the people you are with will accept you. also, just don't care. think to yourself ' why would they be so closed minded and so lonely that they would have the time or the ability to call someone out when there is nothing wrong?' also, they probably don't notice you so don't care. have you ever cared or help a grudge on someone who accidentally bumped into you? if 1 person calls you out, then 90% of the people who hear it think it is wrong. ask that person aloud 'why do you care?'. they then cannot say anything that won't make them look like a 10 year old.
3m00lxxuaa	From the way I've been taught on it, it seems like it's relative, meaning it could be anything that is considered unwelcome, and at least continued on, and also reasonable based on the situation I believe. Your boss should have at least brought it up to the other guy, to try to solve the issue. At this point, if it continues and continues to affect you and your work, maybe try the human resources dept.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	It is verbal harassment and intimidation.. but not sexual harassment. He is not trying to come on to you in a sexual way.. he talks about his non existing sex life..He is bothering you and his shouting intimidates you. You should tell your boss exactly what he says.. Your boss should definitely not allow him to treat you in this way, but I agree that it's not sexual harassment, which doesn't mean your boss should get away with letting this continue to happen.. he  has to step in and severely reprimand your co-worker that it will have negative consequences for him if he continues his demeaning behaviour toward you.|`|O4jGlC2caa	It is harassment.

Your boss should still tell this jerk to stop regardless.|`|8ZcGDTzOaa	Why don't you tape him barking and send it to his wife and see if she agrees it is OK behavior.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	it is harassment if he continues to talk to you when you've asked him not to<br>  <br>  your boss should step in here,|`|hLohtlPEaa	Buy a water pistol and shoot him every time he does this.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	He is harassing and abusing you in the workplace, any behavior that makes you uncomfortable is considered harassment. You need to go to HR and file a grievance and give your idiot boss a wake up call by hiring an attorney and sue the boss and your company in court. You will win and you can find an attorney willing to work Pro Bono or gratis.
PgWkqjeZaa	1) Christ has 3 soterial (saving) functions in respect to time.<br>  <br>  a) He saved the believer at the point of re-generation through faith<br>  b) He saves the believer (through the spirit) from sin <br>  c) He will save the believer on the day of the great judgement<br>  <br>  2) Jesus is also the conduit for prayers to the father (John 16:24). God being holy cannot converse with men and thus Jesus mediates in this fashion as well. <br>  <br>  These and other duties are the function of Christ. <br>  <br>  <br>  Now regarding your Heb 9:23 question, that's a much longer story. If you google on dispensationalism, that will give you a long research list. Ultimately, God has a continual, recurring set of judgements whereby faith / substitutionary atonement is the only remediation. Christ is the ultimate and final example of this substitutionary atonement and he now resides in heaven, the final temple. He IS the better sacrifice, and the only sacrifice that is required.<br>  <br>  Make sense?

What else could it be?<br>  <br>  The Bible writers created the story of the God of Israel that is worshipped by Christians mainly in America. This God forced the Jews to eat their own children for dinner NOT AS A PUNISHMENT, but as an option in time of famine. Not even as an option, but as the “WILL OF GOD!” God NEVER objected about slaughtering and cooking children for dinner. God won’t let the Jews eat pigs, but children YES!  <br>  <br>  I dropped out of Christianity and religion after many years serving in the Christian ministry! I can’t possibly stomach the uncivilized Bible tales any more! The Bible was written to control religious people. Any religion back then was as savage as you can’t possibly imagine. The Bible is a hangover from those days... America became officially ONE NATION UNDER GOD and IN GOD WE TRUST under Christian pressure only after the collapse of the US gold monetary standard! <br>  <br>  This Bible God is totally powerless to teach the Jews any lesson without FORCING them to eat their own children for dinner. The Bible writers say that Israel was a “Land Flowing with Milk and Honey” ONLY before Israel invaded Palestine where the former dwellers used to live in plenty! After the Israel invasion the milk and honey suddenly stopped flowing! Now the Bible writers are promising Israel that “the desert shall blossom like a rose!” The perennial carrot at the end of the stick for the dumb jackasses to catch!<br>  <br>  This God’s sadistic pleasures are the kinkiest ones ever to be invented in human history...! No atheistic dictator in the world EVER thought of forcing his people to eat their own children for dinner...! This is so repulsive that no smut publication is putting out anything like that, either, but you can enjoy reading all about it in God’s Holy Word, the Bible! Most Christians are brainwashed to believe that the DEVIL is seeding this story in their Bibles to confuse them and to test their faith! <br>  <br>  Ironically, Christians are banning ALL ABORTIONS so there will be more children for dinner! Spiritually speaking, of course…!<br>  <br>  Leviticus 26:29 - (God is impatiently saying) YOU WILL eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters* (*without warning of any evil! Christians with any measurable IQ know that no matter how pervert it may sound “if God says it I believe it… and that settles it!”)<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 28:53-57 - Because of the suffering that your enemy will inflict on you during the siege* (*that would take place 700 Bible years into the future! In our society anybody knowing of a crime to be committed and not doing anything about it is put in jail for complicity!), YOU WILL EAT THE FRUIT OF THE WOMB, THE FLESH OF THE SONS AND DAUGHTERS the LORD your god has given you* (*GOD WILL NOT DO ANYTHING to protect the innocent children, but his chosen people will enjoy eating them…! God is so good!!!) Even the most gentle and sensitive man* (*not a sinful homosexual or a Godless atheist, but a CHOSEN CHILD OF GOD!) among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his SURVIVING children, and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating…* (*not sharing is “THE SIN”!!!)<br>  <br>  Jeremiah 19:9  I* (*God, NOT SATAN, but GOD!) WILL MAKE THEM EAT THE FLESH OF THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS* (God has to force the Jews do it in the Bible tales! In reality, during the Roman siege of Masada [cir. 35 AD] all the Jews committed suicide before they even thought of eating their own children!)<br>  <br>  The Bible God won’t force the Jews to eat any PIG, but their own children YES! The heck with any God protection plan for your children when you became a Christian! The Bible writers say that when the 666 mark will be instituted Christians won’t be able to buy or sell food without it. Based on Bible precedents, will they eat their own children for dinner? The anti Semitic oriented Clergy is schooled to ignore and deny that God forced anybody to eat innocent children and that the Jews did it only because they were despicable sinners!<br>  <br>  Ezekiel 5:10 - Therefore in your midst fathers WILL EAT THEIR CHILDREN...<br>  <br>  Christians are told that “God so loved the World!” in spite of the fact that GOD NEVER SPOKE A WORD AGAINST EATING CHILDREN…! It took Moses 2 men to carry a single bunch of gigantic size grapes to show Israel how plentiful was the Heathen Land that they were going to invade (Num 13:23)!  Was it God tricking the Jews to leave Egypt? BTW, there is no historical evidence whatsoever that the Jews were ever slaves in Egypt! So the Jews can eat their own children in the Holy Land for God’s kinky pleasure! Actually, for the pleasure of wanking Bible writers and their avid sadomasochistic readers!   <br>  <br>  Lamentations 4:10 - With their own hands COMPASSIONATE WOMEN* (*GODLY WOMEN…! Not lesbians or atheistic ladies, but “MANY” God loving heterosexual Jewish WOMEN) HAVE COOKED THEIR OWN CHILDREN...! (Not in some isolated case in a moment of rage, but with some planning, recipes, and so on!)<br>  <br>  These are not the only few episodes of FACTUAL eating of children in the Bible stories!!! Here is a case in FULL EXPLICIT CONTEXT that is IMPOSSIBLE for the Clergy or anybody to explain away spiritualizing… <br>  <br>  2 Kings 6:26-29 As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried to him, “Help me, my lord the king* (*a God related King)!” The king replied, “If the Lord does not help you, where can I get help for you? Then he asked her, “What's the matter?” She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him today, and tomorrow we'll eat my son.’ So we cooked my son and ate him* (*BTW… it came out delicious!!!). The next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son so we may eat him, but she had hidden him! <br>  <br>  Not sharing is THE SIN! They were all COMPASSIONATE Godly, non-Atheistic, heterosexual Jewish women that HAVE SLAUGHTERED AND COOKED THEIR OWN CHILDREN FOR DINNER... at the tune of “The LORD is my Shepherd I shall not want…” (Psalm 23)  The OT Bible writers are still deceiving Christians TODAY with the “God is LOVE” bit…<br>  <br>  Isaiah 49:15 “Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne? Though she may forget, I* (*God) WILL NOT FORGET YOU!* (*Open for interpretation) <br>  <br>  Eating your children is one of the themes of the Bible along with having the ONLY begotten child of God crucified! The clergy is still marketing Christianity in our advanced society, but only after YEARS OF CHRISTIAN BIBLE SCHOOLING. They better be totally mute about eating your own children for dinner!   <br>  <br>  The Bible writers are delighted to tell everybody that Jesus was whipped, beaten, thoroughly marinated in Roman spit, and nailed to a Holy Cross as a “spotless Lamb of God” so the Christian can snack his ROMAN SPIT FLAVORED MEAT AND DRINK HIS HOLY BLOOD to make it to Heaven! (John 6:53) The idea of eating one’s own children is part of the BIBLE tales so the forever snacking on Jesus in the Holy Communion is not half that bad…! The Bible also promotes the killing of children to get rid of any future enemy!<br>  <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 - O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us- he who seizes your infants and DASHES them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  The Holy Bible writers say that our enemies ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them (Amen?) So abortion is not remotely that bad. In fact, IT IS VERY HUMANE! Notice HUMANE vs GODLY. GODLY requires that the fetus be born into a child before he/she can be dashed to pieces against the rocks as an infant, or eaten for dinner! <br>  <br>  Isaiah 13:16 (KJV) Their little ones also will be DASHED TO PIECES before their eyes; Their houses will be plundered And their wives ravished…. (How many sexually starved women would wish to be ravished? But the children must be DASHED TO PIECES – not aborted!)<br>  <br>  God the Son Jesus Christ is hardly any better than his own Daddy God up in the sky!<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (In his apocalyptic “revelation” Jesus Christ says) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*No abortionist can beat Jesus at killing babies… AMEN? Jesus is the one killing the children in the wrong Churches so he can teach everybody a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS while preachers get rich selling books about Jesus’ love for the little children. In our secular society today Jesus Christ would be in jail for bullying about killing any child to favor a particular religion!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.* (*I’m the BOSS says Jesus! Unlike the Mafia and to the delight of Christianity, Jesus goes public talking like that!)<br>  <br>  Christians don’t know how to deal with plain FACTS either from science or from their own Bible that they hardly read! They still want to rule the world by this Bible God notion!<br>  <br>  Romans 15:4 (Saint Paul says) For EVERYTHING that was written in the past* (*Old Testament) was written to teach us* (*Christians!)<br>  <br>  Even so, over the centuries Christians believe that NOT EVERYTHING written in the Bible is for them, so they are totally ignorant and refuse to accept all of the above!  Christianity is one of the most DISHONEST religions in the world! The original Jewish “sacred books” were used by some Greek Jews to develop Christianity! Soon the Clergy will pressure Obama to preserve the Christian status quo. The Clergy and Churches are tax exempt so they are concerned to make sure the State follows their line on abortion, same sex marriage and so on or else Obama won’t be re-elected! Hopefully Obama would know how to keep religion out of politics!|`|18I6loFTaa	I don't hate those Verses!|`|AA11479772	but it's not|`|SRvCbAWlaa	The bible was written in a time when women were considered to be subservient to men.  Its just one of the many, many examples of why it is ridiculous to read it today aside from it historical value. <br>  <br>  I believe that many of the things in the bible actually did happen, that doesn't mean we should base our life on them.  <br>  <br>  Many women I know are much, much smarter than their husbands.  |`|4b95bb6170d4ed2da19f1be7f5466b46aa	To be a christian, isn't easy.  A verse like this is hard to accept in today's society, however, it doesn't mean the Bible is outdated.  It is the inspired word of God, and how can God's word ever be outdated.  This whole chapter deals with conduct during mass.  If you notice, St. Paul basically tells everyone to "shut up", in order for everyone communicate with God and to allow for the Spirit to move in each person gathered. St. Paul states just before in 1 Cor. 14: 26, "Everything should be done for building up." |`|AA10767560	A lot of people interpret this as that women should not be preachers or ministers.  Not that they should keep completely silent.  There are many things in the Bible that aren't crystal clear and could've been lost in the translation.

Even if one does not accept Christ as a Deity, His influence on behaviour, even in other religions, is enormous. The adage, "What would Christ do?" is prevalent in many people. Please look harder and you will find many,many good people. They are just not as demonstrative as "Name only" Christians. If you actually look for the good in people, you will be amazed at the great number you find. Remember, as we are all human, we are not good all the time. Cherish those occasions that other's good spills out and try to forgive and forget the times when other's good was not apparent. I forget to ask myself the Christ question often and am usually ashamed of myself. As there is a lot of room for improvement in me, so I have to recognize that there is room for improvement in others.|`|1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	To show the qualities of Christ Christians have to be transformed to be like Christ.

430ab7a92c08b372044b762a697eb09aaa	O lugar denominado Purgatório, segundo o catolicismo, n?o é um nível intermediário entre o Céu e o Inferno, mas um local de purifica??o onde ficam as almas das pessoas que morreram em estado de gra?a -isto é, salvas-, mas ainda precisariam se preparar para ter condi??es de ver Deus nos Céus. A sua existência foi teorizada no pontificado do Papa Gregório I, em 593, com base no livro de 2o Macabeus 12.42-46 (livro Apócrifo e que consta na vers?o católica da Bíblia). Em 1439, no Concílio de Floren?a,  a doutrina foi aprovada e confirmada depois, em 1563 no Concílio de Trento.|`|69694aa28968d0770327a953d0a59841aa	O dogma do purgatório invalida o sacrifício de CRISTO na cruz e tb contradiz c/ as escrituras:<br>  JO?O 5<br>  24 Na verdade, na verdade vos digo que quem ouve a minha palavra, e crê naquele que me enviou, tem a vida eterna, e n?o entrará em condena??o, mas passou da morte para a vida.<br>  <br>  LUCAS 23<br>  43 E disse-lhe Jesus: Em verdade te digo que hoje estarás comigo no Paraíso.<br>  <br>  APOCALIPSE 14<br>  13 E ouvi uma voz do céu, que me dizia: Escreve: Bem-aventurados os mortos que desde agora morrem no Senhor.

qV8Vz36Iaa	I would be amazed if the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world did not meet in secret. I would be amazed if they didn't have agreed upon goals and plans to consolidate their power and wealth.<br>  <br>  It is simply not human nature for these most powerful people to play fair with the pleab people and be open and transparent. Human history shows that powerful people conspire to improve their position, as if they are playing a great game. They are in control of major policies and initiatives throughout the world. The politicians are playing a sham role and mass media plays along.<br>  <br>  The world is run in great pyramids with the most powerful and influential people at the top. The entire system can be look at as one giant pyramid. This is being organized by WTO, NATO, World Bank, and WHO. Some countries attempt to opt out: Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, and Iran. You know how these countries are vilified by mass media for opting out of globalization.<br>  <br>  The effect is devastating on most of the world's populations. Starvation could be eliminated with today's technology, but that gets pushed down the priority list as the elite figure out how to optimize their wealth. <br>  <br>  I'm sure that most of us would lose to these people in a game of Monopoly or Risk. They are all powerful.<br>  <br>  Our only chance is to be thinking about what's right for all of us in the long term. If we keep thinking about what's best for only us, then we are bound to be led toward the slaughterhouse.<br>  <br>  The media portrayed reality is a fantasy. Their view of the world is that policy is set though a fair and informed democratic process electing officials. The reality is that politicians are near the top of the pyramid, but they owe their positions to people higher up in the pyramid. The media is under the influence of monied and powerful corporate interests.

k7FD3rt5aa	Yes!<br>  <br>  Jesus is the ONLY name whereby we must be saved.  <Acts 4:12>|`|jpTl3o5naa	Yes , it is extremely important to believe in Jesus, the sacrificial Lamb. It was He who takes away the sins of the world. Although He was God, He came in human flesh to teach the word of God so that people would understand and believe. He performed miracles, not to prove he could, but people needed to see things to believe them. He knew exactly why He had come and when He would die on the cross. He shed His blood for all mankind, so that our sins can be forgiven . He resurrected and showed Himself to the people, so they would finally believe He was the Lamb of God and the Son of God. He had the 5 holes of His wounds still on His body. Four were on His feet and hands, where He was nailed to the cross and then the one that pierced His side that spewed out water. Had these events not taken place, none of us could ever be saved or go to Heaven. Whoever believeth in His name shall have everlasting life. What a sacrifice and the greatest gift of all! Thank you Jesus. +<br>  You can not separate the Trinity. God the Father. God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. They are one. Jesus is God and came in human flesh because that was what the Father said it to do so all could be saved if they choose Him. The Holy Spirit lives in those that believe and acts like our conscience, leading us to the right way. As one in three, and our beliefs in all three, we understand this.|`|771e401b864ef2c6278719b487b80406aa	Salvation is available only through the Savior YAHOSHUA.

5JqCObDSaa	We don't know what love is until we come to know God. God is love. How we learn to Love is when we accept His love for us. Like the song says, "I love Him, I love Him, because He first loved me, and He purchased my salvation on Calvary." I had what I called spiket or faucet love before I gave my life to Christ. I loved when others loved me, and if you didn't love me then I didn't love you if you know what I mean, we turn our love on or off depending on what suits us. That is conditional or worldly love, I am sure we all have some things we truly do hate, but with Christ we learn to love unconditionally by looking beyond ones faults and seeing their need, just like Christ looks beyond our faults and sees our needs and still loves us, but hates the sin. Love can be a deep subject, but we should not hate anyone, but maybe the things they do.|`|bb0487e3f4e58641a40d9c9b91ae1826aa	I don't think hate is the opposite of love, I think love's opposite is indifference.

Besides, the opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.  When you hate someone you at least have strong feelings about them and probably cared about them at one time.

True love is described in 1 Corinthians 13 in God's Word.  Read here to know what is true love.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 13 The Greatest Gift<br>  <br>   1 Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal. 2 And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. 3 And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned,[a] but have not love, it profits me nothing.<br>  4 Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; 5 does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; 6 does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; 7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.<br>  8 Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part. 10 But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away.<br>  11 When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things. 12 For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.<br>  13 And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.|`|hkS2l6wBaa	16"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,[a] that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16<br>  <br>  This is love. Every action or relationship that is built upon this or even has aspects mimicking it, shows that  This is " in love" or a loving relationship.<br>   Hate is not the oppisite  of love. Apathy is. Neither are of God. i think??? we all? experiance these. UmmmmmmThere is desire or need, which are natural, and good. Theanimal insticnt iswhat i am talking about. You know to get ahead... to stay safe, secure a mate etc. i think we mask these needswe have as love;because when you truly are in love youWILL PROVIDE THESE THINGS. ALSO THEY ARE NESSECARY TO SURVIVAL. therefore the word love is very malleable. When you are burned in this little game of survival... or rather things simply dont go your way... you may experiance hate, if only momentarily. Little children love, when they are allowed to. Love is from God, and God talks to all of us. If small children have to learn how to tell the diffrence between love aND HATEi think it makes someones chances of knowing love slimmer.

The "Christian" Catholics believe that Mary is the intercessor between the catholic and God, (This I know because I studied in a Catholic Religious school) obviously ya can pray God directly but when I asked if you can pray directly to Him, then why pray to Mary?......"Because God will be more touched, she is his mother!" (??) "and who can deny something to his own mother?" okay, that's stupid but it's what these catholics believe.<br>  And why the saints? "The saints are holy people, they were consecrated by God, they were without sin,we must admire and try to be like them"       In this group you can find Mary, the apostles, and other devout catholics throughout the history. Also martyrdom is also a cause to become a saint. <br>  Yes you are right! the catholics pray to idols, and they will acount for this before the Lord. And you know what they told me at school!: "Evangelicals say we adore imagens made by men, but this is false, don't they have pictures remembering those who had passed away, family, friends. We all keep pictures of our dear ones, it's just the same with our beloved saints"<br>  Excuse me, but no one put candles, make procetions, recite prayers to simple pictures !!!!!!<br>  <br>  Poor catholics, they'll go to hell, because the system on which they trusted their souls is controlled by Satan and the Pope his antichrist, God calls its church The Great Prostitute and wants his people to get out of it. <br>  Just as the Muslims, poor you, you are very religious but you have been deceived. It was not Gabriel who appeared to Muhammad.<br>  Muslims believe that God sent the angel Gabriel to teach Muhammad the exact words that he should repeat to the people. The words are therefore not his own; they did not come from his own thoughts, but were put into his mouth by the angel. However, the Bible clearly warns about messages delivered by Angels and that they are not necessarily from God. The criteria, which the Quran fails, is as follows: <br>  <br>  "But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed.<br>  Galatians 1:8" <br>  <br>  As the Quran was contradictory to the Gospel, by the Biblical standard appealed to above, Muhammad is not a prophet of God|`|rAnPPRQ2aa	First of all, you would get a lot more answers if you didn't block everyone with whom you disagree. . . .<br>  <br>  Jews do not humiliate Jesus and his mother.  They take a stance of studiously ignoring Christianity.  A stance I wish Muslims would adopt.<br>  <br>  You say Jesus denied and refused to be elevated.  This is incorrect.  There were many instances where Jesus equates himself with God, and in fact said that he and God were One.  Isaiah prophesied that he would be called “Immanuel” which means “God is with us”.  And in deed we do say that of him.<br>  <br>  How dare you quote from the Bible and them make the assertion that the Bible is corrupt?  I can show you plenty of scripture that directly contradicts what you have quoted out of context, but when I do so, you conveniently say that those bits have been corrupted.  There is no evidence to support your corruption theory, except it doesn’t match what your cult leader said.  <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogtownhall.com/2009/01/24/" rel="nofollow">http://calculatedrisk.blogtownhall.com/2...</a>  Christianity is not a cafeteria.  You can’t take what you want and leave the rest.<br>  <br>  The Holy spirit is the spirit of God.  They are one.  Just as my voice on the telephone is just as much me as if I was in person.<br>  <br>  Why do we pray to Jesus?  Because those who were closest to him understood and believed that he was God, regardless of what some Arab 600 years removed from the event claims. <br>  <br>  We pray to the Holy Spirit as the essence of God that dwells within each of us.<br>  <br>  We do not pray to Mary. It is a common Christian practice to ask other people to pray for us.  It is understood that the dead in heaven can hear our prayers.  WE ask Mary to pray for us, because as Jesus’ mother we know she has a special place in heaven. We do not expect Mary to perform miracles or to do anything for us except add her prayers to ours.<br>  <br>  Same with the saints.<br>  <br>  Idols? Pictures?  No, my friend, we do not pray to idols or pictures.  These things are tools to teach and remind us, for us to contemplate and reflect upon, not objects of prayer.<br>  <br>  The Muslim view of Jesus is that of someone who had stories of Jesus related to him years before, and never really understood the whole story.  Some of those stories were from the Gospels.  Others were from fiction, with no canonical recognition.  Muhammad had no way of knowing which was which, and being illiterate was unable to independently pursue a personal study of the life of Jesus.  He remembered those things which impressed him most, rejected those things which did not suit his world view, and years later wove them into the framework of his cult, albeit sometimes badly.  Hardly the kind of thing you would want to base your religion and in fact your immortal soul upon.|`|ISxdNDeGaa	why you post this question here? in ramadan? is the reason behind this that you only wanna read answers that agree with you, and to start ur bashing party?<br>  <br>  anyway....who said that jesus is a prophet ? <br>  Jesus is God and God is Jesus, period<br>  <br>  <br>  mary? saints? oh u forgot that also we pray for the dead.<br>  <br>  idols?LOL  pictures? we don't pray for the "picture", only who praise the pictures  are those who don't fully understand their religion, these are just some material things that help in keeping us more in touch with religion, humans regarding their religion need some material things, do u believe that when u pray, if u prayed while sitting..God won't accept ur prayers? no dear, but all these moves are done so u will actually feel that u are doing something, talking about material things, what were those rivers of wine, that are mentioned in the Quran, all about? <br>  <br>  this is sick..what do u know about Christianity.. idols??? u r really sick<br>  <br>  we believe in God...|`|iMplzgBtaa	Not surprising at all that the apparent Christians all got thumbs down and the Muslims, whom the question is not even pointed at, all got thumbs up.  You obviously don't want an honest answer from a Christian or you wouldn't have been so sarcastic in your question and you wouldn't be mocking and thumbing down all their answers.  You've received truthful answers you just choose not to accept them.  Catholics pray to Mary and asks priests for forgiveness, but they also pray to God.  Non-Catholic Christians do not pray to crosses or other statues we pray to Jesus and God because we know they are both one.

5HcnqxKQaa	Those two answers above me are good. I'd just like to add on a little to the first suggestion that you approach a translation group on translating it for you. Usually, translation groups have their hands full. They'd only consider translating your comic if:<br>  a) they have the time and staff,<br>  b) the scan is of a high resolution, and most importantly,<br>  c) they have to be interested in the comic as well.<br>  <br>  I'm gonna assume the comic you have hasn't been picked up by any English publishers. Now, if you're willing to fork out some cash for someone to do a translation, then try here: <a href="http://brolen9104.wordpress.com/commissionfaq/" rel="nofollow">http://brolen9104.wordpress.com/commissi...</a>|`|yakYuqGXaa	Nope. MOST internet translators don't work anyways. Seriously. There are far too many idioms and multiple meanings in the Japanese language. A letter translated from English to Japanese in Babel Vista is a disaster. It'll probably work for really small or simple sentences, but nothing beyond that really. I mean, try using google translator on a Japanese site. Depending on what's written, it's really hard to even understand the gist of it sometimes.  I'd say that your best bet would be to have a Japanese person you know translate it for you,or to look for an already translated copy.|`|8a6a86c246f925349decf9ddd0a5a907aa	Lol, no.

Remember it is still my home. What you do in your own home is your decision and if this sexual act is what you want there is nothing I can do about it but counsel you to desist. <br>  The politically correct and the liberal clergy are wrong in their assessment or perception of what the Christ was talking about when He told us to love one another. Well we are .... we are to love one another but that does not mean that in our love we must engage in self gratification against "the way" God wants us to live. Nor does it mean that in our love we must be tough enough to send you away from us. Love does not have to condone what is wrong either, I and we don't have to like it but we do have to love regardless of what and whom we like.<br>  We are to go with the peace of the dove but use the wisdom of the serpent in our pilgrimage; never the less ... what you are telling me son is wrong and I would counsel you to re-evaluate your actions.<br>  Now; your mother is having roast for dinner on Saturday night so if you are coming over please respect my home and my values by what God has taught me.

It is billions of years old and there are millions of books and scientific reports that prove this conclusion.<br>  <br>  If you rely on the bible as a source of geological, biological and historical evidence then I can simply point out that the bible is a work of fiction, a book compiled from the plagiarised texts of ancient religions by bronze age sheep herders; translated from Aramaic, Hebrew and Greek texts to Latin and edited by the Catholic Church, translated into English and re-edited by the Church of England as instructed by King James to conform with his views, and interpreted to suit whatever claim is being made regarding its authenticity.|`|2h8tqOeFaa	I have my own personal theory, if you think about it according to the Bible, the Earth is roughly just over 6000 years old and according to Science the Earth is billions of years old.. <br>  <br>  If the Bible is right it does not mean that Science is wrong, or visa versa, let me explain, EG: The Earth is made from physical elements that came to be via natural processes created from or by God, God has existed forever he is eternal.. <br>  <br>  The natural processes have or may not have existed forever, if you were to put a date on a physical element that has existed forever you could probably place it in the billion years mark, because even numbers go on forever and theres no time or age to it, but it would be really old.. <br>  <br>  My point is, even if God created the Earth and the rest of the universe in 6 days this does not mean that the materials that the Earth and the rest of the universe was created from was made within the 6 days too, they could have been made way back or could have been here with God eternally.. <br>  <br>  The materials could physically have come from God himself or the materials could have gone through a process which was different than what the creation of the Universe and the Earth went through.. <br>  <br>  Just think about it a production line makes 1 car in 1 hour or less, but the materials in which the car was created from may have taken much longer to make, for instance the metal takes a long while to be made plus the elements which the metal is made from is as old as the Earth, so how old is the car really?, do you know what i mean?..|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	Yes, there are Christians who believe that the world was created 6000 years ago. I however am not one of those. I am a Christian who believes that we have no idea how old the Earth is. I also believe that the story of creation in Genesis 1 is a story about the Earth being recreated. It didn't start there, it was remade, as it will be remade again..|`|YvvnTrxDaa	I don't agree with your friends.

Adam was created approximately 6000 years ago and the universe is much older.  This is in agreement with what the Bible tells us. <br>  (Genesis 1:1) In [the] beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<br>  The Bible does not say how much time elapsed from this time until God began forming the earth for human habitation as described in the rest of the first chapter of Genesis thus allowing for billions of years for the age of the universe.|`|IFQFt25naa	6000 years, 6000 million years, 6000 billion years, does it really matter?<br>  <br>  It is an interesting subject to discuss.  But the problem is we really do not know and as we (science) learn more we keep changing the age of the earth and the universe.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, no one knows for sure how old the universe around us is, all we really know for sure is that we are here today. (Unless you talk to philosophers then maybe we are really not here, but only an illusion.)<br>  <br>  It is a little like a child that was found abandoned. No one has any idea who the parents are or where the child came from, we think the child is about 2 years old, maybe older, maybe younger.   Ultimately how old/what day or under what circumstances the child was born does not matter (other than to satisfy curiosity); what is important is what happens to the child today and in the future.<br>  <br>  The same is true with the earth, when and how everything started really is not all that important, the fact is we are here.   While trying to unravel the mysteries regarding the origins of the earth and the universe is interesting, it is far more important to worry about what we do with/do to the earth today and what we are going to do in the future.<br>  <br>  Arguing about something that no one will ever be able to prove with 100% certainty is rather pointless.  To be perfectly honest it also often seems rather childish, everyone pointing their fingers at each other saying “I’m right!, Your wrong!”.  Especially since the plain and simple truth is that no one has the definitive answer and everyone is probably mistaken with some of their descriptions and ideas of how and when everything came into existence.<br>  <br>  May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|1e8ca8ab530a9730b725fa637728d753aa	there are two mainstream schools of thought on this issue.<br>  <br>  first, gen 1 - end of book     the creation happened as written, along with the cosmos (verse 1) the angels and such<br>  <br>  the second "main stream thought" is that between verse 1 and verse 2, is the fall of satan, and in his rebellion he destroyed the earth<br>  <br>  if the earth is 6-10 thousand, then it would stand to reason that the universe is the same age.<br>  <br>  the bible tends to indicate that the angels were part of the creation process, (hense school of thought number 2) and that the heavens were created as a dwelling place for the angels.<br>  <br>  with our mars exploration going strong, there seems to be evidence of a massive destruction there, about 70,000 years ago, estimated.<br>  <br>  it will be fun to see if they fnd evidence of a past civilization there.   <br>  <br>  i hope you are looking forward to that also|`|ea338428f11ccb6b0f8f147ef07f64a3aa	Yes - I think there's even a title for it. . .those who believe the total age is 6,000 years, period:  Young Earth Christians.<br>  <br>  edit:  Tuberoot has one interesting, different theory among many.that are out there.  I don't think you can count the individual theories we all have.  To me, I go with the more mixed evolution/creation angle.

When they talk of biblical figures living hundreds of years, something's different. . .|`|AA11220299	All Christians who take a literal interpretation of scripture believe the universe is thousands of years old, not millions or billions. The same Bible that says Adam was created then also teaches that the universe was created at the same time.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	To an eternal being what's a few billion years. The universe is 13.7 billion years old. We've been around for only a tiny fraction of that time.But certainly more than 6000 yrs.<br>  The Bible is the story of the "chosen" people, The Jews. Not the entire human race. Look at it that way and a lot of things start to make sense. Like when Cain left Eden he walked down a road(a road?) and found a city.and other people. Where'd they come from?|`|771e401b864ef2c6278719b487b80406aa	scripture is about this world, rather than the universe, though there is one phrase that says the stars also were created, and some people understand that to mean 'at the same time', though I don't believe the context requires that understanding.|`|51yi7HKsaa	I believe the universe is quite young, 6-8K.

Therefore, even though a person may not write expertly in English, if she understands English well and Hungarian or Turkish is her native language, she could translate a text from English into her mother tongue.

It also says that he, the husband is to love her as Jesus loved the Church, no where does it say anything about obeying anything other then the commandments. The marrage bed is holy, and the husband is to be the Spiritual head of the household only if he is living that type of life. If he is not, then no she should not, the Holy Spirit will lead her to what she should do, and the husband too.

tI1NHwfBaa	If we read the verse you're talking about in context, I think you'll have to agree that the term "childlike" refers to one's faith, not one's intelligence.<br>  <br>  There are many very intelligent atheists.  A good friend of mine is one.  But there are many very stupid atheists, as well, who don't question what they're told in high school science class, and have no natural curiosity that makes them want to seek out a greater understanding of what they've been told.<br>  <br>  In the same way, there are many very intelligent, very well educated Chrsitians.  There are also many who are content to take what they're told and not think about it.<br>  <br>  So you're right, I think, when you say that one group isn't more intelligent than the other.  But I also see atheists who seem to feel that atheism somehow makes them more intelligent, in the same way some Christians think their belief gives them moral superiority.  They're both wrong, and self-deluded.|`|qPzxKhrlaa	No, when I was a Christian I did not believe that atheists on average were more intelligent than Christians. I still don't believe that. I believe that "intelligence" is a very vague term, to begin with. Also, having the "faith of a child" and the "trust of a child" is very different from having the knowledge of a child. (And if you read for context it's pretty clear what those passages are really talking about.)<br>  <br>  I'm no longer a Christian because I realized that I was being intellectually dishonest with myself in order to have the comfort of belief. I don't believe my decision means that I am smarter than anyone else, I'm just really big on self honesty.|`|7cBOKehWaa	Faith =/= Lack of intelligence.<br>  <br>  A lot of you would do well to remember that.|`|wwdllMzYaa	i do agree with stingy on that, your gorgeous<br>  <br>  <br>  and love your mind too <br>  <br>  ;-)|`|eEBuJHUwaa	I know some intelligent Christians and dumb Atheists.

Not all black want to be called the same thing.  Some want to be called blacks or african americans and some older blacks prefer to be called colored or negro. I try not to talk about race unless i feel really comfortable with someone. If i do i try to gauge their comfortability.  I am not sure that calling someone "black is a sterotype">  This isn't the same but hispanics have similar issues in what they want to be called.  For example some mexicans want to be called chicanos and cubans and chileans want to be called hispanics while people from central america want to be called latinos. Anytime you have such a vast group you will have issues.|`|AA11786648	Your black that is NOT an insult. You find it insulting to be called negro so they call you black. Not all the "black" people in the USA like being called African American.  If it is not insulting being called White than neither is it insulting to be called black. Stop being ashamed of yourself. Black is beautiful, It is elegant. It is what people where when they are trying to be classy.  Don't give into the inferiority complex thing. There is NOTHING wrong with being black own it. Unless you are telling us you are from Africa or the child of Africans from Africa recently then you are black. <br>  Think about this your race is not African American in England what do they call you there. Someone of your race. What are you universally known as.  Also not everybody living on the continent of Europe is a black (negro) person so how exactly do you describe them.|`|GTuoRorFaa	As an American American, I am insulted that people call me white. White is an absence of color. Black is all colors mixed together. Simple as that. Blacks have terms for caucasians like cracker, white devil, honkey and others, so it works both ways. If a new word was invented for you, I believe that you would still be insulted. If you don't like it here, why don't you move back to Africa?  You could call yourself an American African then.

Instead, try looking for the truth in the Word of God (the Bible).  <br>  <br>  As for your Wiccan situation.  It's OK to be curious, but don't let your curiosity pull you away from your relationship with God.  <br>  <br>  It looks like you are unsure of your identity as a Christian.  I would like to refer you to Titus 3:3-7.  Check it out.  It's pretty cool because it's the gospel in a nutshell :)<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless!|`|yAvTxh47aa	There are plenty of Christian denominations that aren't the hatefilled spite of anti-gay "Christianity."<br>  <br>  Wanting to be Wiccan for *any* reason other than loving *our* gods is wanting to be Wiccan for the *wrong* reason. Honestly, I can't imagine what websites you're looking at that advocate being Wiccan without the gods being front and center.<br>  <br>  Some of my Christian friends belong to UCC.

I bet you would be surprised how many there felt exactly like you did, but like you were afraid to show it.|`|AA11811976	Listen, you're going to get a world of opinions from one track church pushers to agnostics.  That's what being human is: being an individual with an individual mind.  Why do you think Catholicism branched off into hundreds of protestant and orthodox sects?  Who's to say what exact mode of scripture is "right" or "wrong"?  And even if you say your Methodist for example, if you disagree with 1 Methodist principle...you're not really a Methodist then, hence I believe no one is truly an exact follower of their proclaimed religion.  So why should you feel "bad" for your practices when in some sense we're guilty of hippocritical actions.<br>  <br>  Wiccan is essentially nature worship as I understand it, and was not God creator of all things?  Nature is an incomprehensibly complex system that sustains us entirely, if we choose to rely on it.  Whether you believe in God or not, what is not sacred about that?  Apparently nothing anymore, with the way we treat it.  Should you feel bad about looking into Wiccan?  Entirely up to you, but if you presume God forbids such actions of "false idols" what of Buddhist monks??  They meditate, advocate peace in all forms, and vow to harm none, but they don't pray or read the bible.  If that gets them a straight to hell sentence, then that is a God I do not endorse.  If you study anything with motives to better yourself and/or others, how can you feel bad about that?!<br>  <br>  Well, I will stop rambling.. msg me if you like..?|`|AE6Rap6vaa	First of all...your gut feeling and you spirit is telling you that the wiccan studies dont feel right......THEY ARE REAL AND ITS NOT A JOKE! Iwouldent go dipping around it that stuff If I were you, GOD is telling you NO! That is why you feel bad....you dont feel connected to the church.......SO WHAT! I think you are doing ok....stay away from witchcraft......depend on god to lead you like you are now and dont depend on a church to make you feel good about what you believe....get into your bible on your own time....YOU ARE THE CHURCH....People make a church.....not a building!|`|aYVJTSCWaa	Sitting in a garage doesn't make you a car.<br>  Praying on Holidays doesn't make you a Christian.<br>  <br>  You need to take the time to read the Bible for yourself and study Jesus' teachings and God's plan for us, THEN make your decision.  There are versions of the Bible that are very easy to understand.  <br>  <br>  I am no one to judge homosexuals, but it is strictly forbidden in the Bible.  The Bible is not a cafeteria buffet line.  You can't pick and choose what suits you.  You either take it or leave it.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	Why you are confused is not that hard to figure out.  Someone that truly wants to be a Christian, will not dabble in other "religions".  And when you want to find a "church" that allows things that go against the word of God, you have chosen to not be a true follower of Christ.  You cannot be a Christian and pick and choose what you believe.  Your sin lies in the fact that you are looking for God to fit into your image, instead of allowing Him to make you into His.  You want forgiveness, and that is wonderful. You can find that through Christ- however with forgiveness must come repentance. Not just being sorry for what you are doing, but you must completely turn away from everything that hinders your relationship with Christ- and that is Wicca , and the thought that you will find a church that agrees with homosexuality.  You like Wicca because of how it is centered around nature and the creation.  We can love to look at creation, and appreciate it, but we must not worship the creation, we must only worship the Creator.<br>  And my friend, you will never feel connected to God or others at church, if you only pray and go to church on holidays.|`|UinOWcMUaa	hi ... well.. you know it is natural to think logically about this sort of issue... I know as human's we want equality for all people, but.. I think if we consider ourselves Christians, then we must follow God's rules.. I study God's word alot and many things are hard to grasp, but.. reguardless of how I feel... I know that God's ways are so much better than my own :)<br>  <br>  I can tell you have a good heart, and I sympathize with you, it's just.. if God is our creator, than we must follow His provision's and His ways. They are right.. and they show us the way !! I've studied this issue alot.. and while many support Homosexuality... God does not !!|`|tI1NHwfBaa	The answer to your problem is in your own question ... you said you pray every Christmas, Easter and Thanksgiving, and you don't feel connected.<br>  <br>  How would you feel about your family if you saw them only three times each year?  Would you feel connected to your friends if you only talked to them on holidays?<br>  <br>  Prayer is conversation.  Talk to God!  When you come before God in prayer regularly, you won't be able to help feeling connected.|`|1760OdxNaa	There are plenty of Christian mystics who have found spiritual inspiration and strength from Nature. It's okay to learn about other traditions, Christian or pagan.<br>  <br>  Just may sure you read and read widely! <br>  <br>  I suggest Hildegarde of Bingen or St Francis for starters?|`|jard50Yiaa	A site that may interest you...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.christianforums.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.christianforums.com</a>|`|GJS3hTK5aa	What you lack is clear determination about your life. Please note that life is very short. You get a chance here to obey and love your God who is keenly trying to get you to heaven in your hereafter. He simply does not like evil and any kind of unclean acts and thoughts. But due to our mental and physical weakness, we often fall prey to such unclean thoughts and acts. But, in the first place, you must have firm faith in God and must try your level best to do as he has commanded. You must say no to whatever you consider bad or confusing and keep your mind clear. Submit your life to God and pray everyday to happen only his will in your life. Once you do it, stop worrying about your life since God will never let you commit any kind of such sin, that will cause you to go away from goodness. Remember your God in each moment of your life and live freely.

Yes there are those people in here like you said (Will it ever move beyond "Christians: your God doesn't exist" or "atheists: your going to hell". ) however there are also those trying to get answers.<br>  <br>  And if you want to get more extreme even some of the people that might seem like they are doing those things are actually looking for answers also, they just don't know the right way to ask the question.  I'll give you some examples of these type of questions that are ussually looked at the wrong way.<br>  <br>  How is it possible that anybody past the second grade believes in God?  Yes this is a very slanderous question, however look at it closely and you can see what the person was really trying to ask.  I'll restate this question in a few different ways.   How can a person believe in a God?; What scientific reason is there that a God exsists?  I could go on and on, but as you can see even though the question is asked in a bashing way it's just because the don't understand what it is to be a believer.<br>  <br>  Why are athiests so immoral?  Again this person does not know how to ask a question and again if you look you can see what the real question is here.  If you don't believe in a God; then what stops you from being immoral?<br>  <br>  Now I'm not saying they are all like this, however some of them are.  Now onto my last point some people say athiests shouldn't be on here in the first place however I strongly disagree.  Athiesm in it's simpliest form is a religious belief.  It is the belief that there is no God.  I would guess that the athiests on here are just like the rest of us; trying to find that ultimate truth.|`|8aa2ea728deb10155c8014220bf22a62aa	I have always encouraged my children to exercise their minds and delve into so many spiritual things.

God sends two angels to warn the one godly family of the imminent demise of these cities, only to have the locals try to rape these two angels. Of course this didn't please God very much. However, Lot, the father of this one so-called godly family, does an interesting thing.

wY8jE8HEaa	“Gospel of the Kingdom of God” <br>  <br>  MARK 1:14 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of The Kingdom of God <br>  <br>  From the above Verse, it is clear that Christ, Jesus-The Son of Mary preached the Gospel of The Kingdom of God. This Gospel (The Good News) actually contained the Words of God because of course, it was the Gospel of The Kingdom of God which was preached ONLY by Jesus. There is not even anything as the Gospel of Jesus as noted by Mark 1:1. The words of the Gospel which Jesus (pbuh) preached, were not his words as he says: <br>  <br>  <br>  JOHN 14:24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me. <br>  <br>  Matthew and John were actually the disciples of Jesus (pbuh). But did they really write these Gospels by themselves. Do we have Gospels “BY” Matthew and John? From an account in the Gospel of Matthew, we can clearly see that this Gospel is not written by Matthew himself: <br>  <br>  MATTHEW 9:9 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. <br>  <br>  If Matthew would have been the author of this Gospel, he surely would have written that “.. and he saith unto “ME”… and “I” arose and followed him.” <br>  <br>  Luke and Mark were not even the disciples of Jesus. Luke was a physician and a companion of St Paul and Mark was an interpreter who probably worked with St Peter in Rome. <br>  <br>  The Gospels also differ from each other a lot: <br>  <br>  Was Joseph the Son of Jacob (MATTHEW 1:16) or was he the Son of Heli (LUKE 3:23)? <br>  <br>  Why isn’t the ascension of Jesus (pbuh) to heaven mentioned in Matthew and John? <br>  <br>  These Gospels which were written down 100 Years after Jesus (pbuh) ascension, circulated anonymously, no names were attached to them until almost 200 and the Christian theologians who came up with the idea of having a New Testament was condemned as heretic. <br>  <br>  Do we have that True Gospel which Jesus Christ (pbuh) Preached in Hebrew or Aramaic? <br>  Did Jesus (pbuh) asked Matthew, Mark, Luke and John to write these Gospels? <br>  How can Christians rely on the accounts in these Gospels which are the basic Pillars of their Faith?|`|YQOT68xFaa	The oldest *Catholic* manuscripts are missing that passage, as well as a bunch of other vital passages and verses. These are crap manuscripts to begin with - one was found in a trash can in the basement of the Vatican, and the other was found in this dungeon-y monastery. They are not reliable manuscripts. They are full of all kinds of errors, they contradict one another, and they contain heresy rather than pure doctrine and truth. The oldest and best manuscripts that contain the real Scriptures do contain that passage and the other ones that are missing from the bad manuscripts.<br>  <br>  You should know that most modern English versions come from those crappy manuscripts, whereas the KJV comes from the reliable manuscripts that don't have vital passages missing.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

We know that Eve was the one who gave Adam the apple, and God cursed Eve. So Eve (women in general), regain their value, God gave Mary the honor of appearing to her first, and that way proves to us that women are indeed forgiven.<br>  <br>  2) Most importantly is says "Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons" It was believed at the time that daemons would only inhabit sinners and sinners only. By Jesus appearing to Mary, who had not one, but seven demons, proves to us that he came to the world to save sinners and not good people. This once sinner woman, is now blessed by seeing Jesus even before his own disciples.|`|zp7aW6o7aa	No matter what biblegateway says or doesn't say, is not the question here.

That if thou shalt confess with they mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in thine heart that God hath raised Christ from the dead, thou shalt be saved.<br>  <br>  All else taught, from mans churches and synagogues, such as water baptisms, to all rituals of all religions are abominations and not seen of God, for Christ did away with all of mans beliefs upon his resurrection.  That was Christ's calling and he is the first of his Fathers church, which upon his return shall wed.<br>  <br>  I know as a fact Gods church is invisible and within the heart of his people who he shall call, the New Jerusalem.

AA12133228	Love is one of those words that means so many things - it's not exactly surprising that you *feel* no love for someone who so strongly violates your moral views. However, to pray for someone is a way of loving them in *deed*. <br>  <br>  There are many people who are so lost that they become very difficult to love, especially for people who's view of the world are very different to theirs. If you feel your faith calls for you to pray for them, that is certainly a good thing - for them, and for you. This discipline can be a prayer offering for you, as well as prayer for them to find their way, and prayer for those who they may have harmed through their way of life.<br>  <br>  I do not believe that anyone does anything out of a pure desire to cause pain and nothing else, unless they have a mental disorder. (In which case they need your prayers, and professional help even more) And so I would guess that this person either does not believe they are doing anything wrong, or despite whatever mask they wear to hide it, are consumed by remorse, even as they do what they know they should not.

Up to seven times?" <br>   22Jesus answered, "I tell you, not seven times, but seventy-seven times.[f] <br>  <br>  Grace and peace to you!<br>   - Isaac|`|d21602968207c0c2d97e342c8834fc7aaa	Personally I'd avoid the lady, or show her by example how to be a good person if the opportunity arose.

Whilst you care for this woman's salvation, ultimately, she is in control of her own future and not you. <br>  <br>  So in my opinion, pray she finds peace, forgiveness and salvation ONCE and then leave her be. However, if you see her in trouble or in need of assistance, then you could offer to help her as a good Christian should. <br>  <br>  Remove your gaze from her and concentrate on your own family and those who need your attention.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	More reasons to pray for her since she really needs your prayers.

I just moved into an apartment with one of my best friends. And we have this really mean guy Living next to us. He doesn't like us because He "claims" we make way to much noise which is not true because we are hardly ever at the apartment. so he has told some of the people that live in the same building has us that we are crazy party girls and all we ever do it party and drink all day. which is completely not true. Me and my friend are both aspiring photographers we don't have time to party and drink. not to mention we're both in college. So I've talked to him about the situation and he denies all of it. and yet he continues to spread these mean rumors about us.<br>  <br>  POINT IS..people like to talk. so just tell your cousin to ignore the lady and eventually it will get old. if it's not true then there should be no reason to get mad over it. In this situation I don't really think cops can do anything about it however if she continues to harass your cousin like you say she is doing then yes your cousin could get the cops involved harassing is a category four offense! <br>  <br>  JUST REMEMBER IT HAS TO BE A SERIOUS OFFENSE TALKING TRASH ISN'T REALLY SERIOUS :)<br>  <br>  well i hope i helped!<br>  and tell your cousin to not worry because if she is old she will die eventually (not to be mean to elderly people or anything.)|`|TnIsuYqYaa	Confront the old hag and give her a real mouthful.Make sure she knows that you hate her guts.Dont be nice to her,She was rude first so be rude back,and i mean real rude.If she can dish it out then give it back to her.And because you tried to be nice and she was rude for no reason dont give an inch.Give her a hard time,see how she likes it.I have no problems with any neighbours,because i dont put up with any sh!t.Trust me it works!|`|AuvMZYTSaa	Ignore her.

Sin may seem fun at the moment- but my friend, a moment is not worth the pain that can come from sinning.

Some have linked it to a pole shift; others, to the alignment of the planets, which some think could cause a monumental fluctuation of Earth's gravity, thus bringing about large-scale destruction.<br>  The reality, however, is that it is just a date on an ancient calender, and there is not real proof that links it to an apocalypse.|`|AA10455120	They're different stories, although the second may be a bastardization of the first...<br>  <br>  <br>  Basically, it goes like this:<br>  Once upon a time, long long ago, when the world was new, there was a great flood, and fire from the skies, and almost everyone died.<br>  Many thousands of years later, when the survivors had built great civilizations, and had grown wise, It happened again. Almost all trace of those civilizations was destroyed, and many many people died.<br>  The survivors realized that the Disaster might be part of a repeating cycle, which could therefore be predicted. They began to track the skies, and rebuild civilization. IN time, a great nation called Atlantis (although it was known by different names in different places) came to be. they tracked the skies, and they made plans to survive. And when the Disaster came again, they escaped with vital knowledge, including writing, astrology, medicine, and others. Atlantis itself was utterly destroyed, but survivors settled in other areas, and rebuilt civilization.<br>  <br>  Some of the places they settled are: egypt, south america, india.<br>  <br>  IN those areas, they continued to track the sky, and track the cycle of dasaster and rebirth. <br>  <br>  The maya in particular were the best keepers of time. they had the date of the disaster calculated down to a day.<br>  That day is:<br>  <br>  The winter equinox of the roman year 2012.<br>  12-21-2012<br>  <br>  Those who believe the myths of disaster are doing what they can to prepare, so that they will be survivors instead of dead.<br>  <br>  However, others believe that although there will be environmental disasters, they will usher in a new golden age.|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	Just that Caitlin, a myth.

The trailer shows a monk running to a bell tower on a mountaintop to sound the alarm as a huge wall of water washes over what appear to be the peaks of the Himalayas.<br>  <br>  'Promoting a hoax'<br>  <br>  One barometer of the interest in 2012 may be the "Ask an Astrobiologist" section of NASA's Web site, where senior scientist David Morrison answers questions from the public. On a recent visit, more than half of the inquiries on the most popular list were related to 2012.<br>  <br>  "The purveyors of doom are promoting a hoax," Morrison wrote earlier this month in response to a question from a person who expressed fear about the date.<br>  <br>  A scholar who has studied the Maya for 35 years said there is nothing ominous about 2012, despite the hype surrounding claims to the contrary.<br>  <br>  "I think that the popular books... about what the Maya say is going to happen are really fabricated on the basis of very little evidence," said Anthony Aveni, a professor of astronomy, anthropology and Native American studies at Colgate University.<br>  <br>  Aveni and Stuart are both writing their own books explaining the Mayan calendar and 2012, but Stuart said he's pessimistic that people will be interested in the real story when so many other books are making sensational claims.<br>  <br>  Dozens of titles about 2012 have been published and more are scheduled to go on sale in the coming months. Current offerings include "Apocalypse 2012," in which author Lawrence Joseph outlines "terrible possibilities," such as the potential for natural disaster. <br>  <br>  But Joseph admits he doesn't think the world is going to end.<br>  <br>  "I do, however, believe that 2012 will prove to be... a very dramatic and probably transformative year," Joseph said.<br>  <br>  The author acknowledged he's worried his book's title might scare people, but said he wanted to alert the public about possible dangers ahead.<br>  <br>  He added that his publisher controls the book's title, though he had no issue with the final choice.<br>  <br>  "If it had been called 'Serious Threats 2012' or 'Profound Considerations for 2012,' it would have never gotten published," Joseph said.<br>  <br>  Growing interest<br>  <br>  Another author said the doom and gloom approach is a great misunderstanding of 2012.<br>  <br>  "The trendy doomsday people... should be treated for what they are: under-informed opportunists and alarmists who will move onto other things in 2013," said John Major Jenkins, whose books include "Galactic Alignment" and who describes himself as a self-taught independent Maya scholar.<br>  <br>  Jenkins said that cycle endings were all about transformation and renewal -- not catastrophe -- for the Maya. He also makes the case that the period they chose coincides with an alignment of the December solstice sun with the center of the Milky Way, as viewed from Earth.<br>  <br>  "Two thousand years ago the Maya believed that the world would

No word in that sentence says she's afraid (I said, that sentence, I very well know the first sentence has one).<br>  She doesn't fear them. Point blank. Period. <br>  Homophobia is also quite different from just plain intolerant ignorance. They will be afraid of YOU, not what you are, because they're ignorant. <br>  Also; just because you can't find a phobia does not make it nonexistent. It just means those psychologists or whatever, haven't found it and classified it yet in a majority of people.<br>  So yes, like you said, she just hates gay guys. No reason. Just hates them. She can't hide behind homophobia because I just dissected phobias for you.
L0AZ6tHGaa	I'm an Atheist so I think I can answer this one.<br>  <br>  To understand their hatred for us, you have to understand their mentality. To religious people, their "God" and "God's Word" are the absolute truth. They are right, and therefore everyone else is wrong. So when someone comes around and challenges their claims that their God and their Religion are correct, they immediately get defensive and angry and attack.<br>  <br>  They hate Atheists because we do not believe in the same thing they do. We say what they believe is wrong, fake, a lie, etc. This offends them greatly. It's basically the same fight between Jews and Muslims. They hate each other because they believe different things.<br>  <br>  This is nothing new. It's been a constant struggle since the beginning of civilization. If one group of people do not hold the same beliefs as another group of people, they hate each other, and subsequently fight and destroy each other. Examples of this have gone on throughout history.<br>  <br>  Throughout history, if you were a nonbeliever, you could actually be killed, "in the name of God." Anyone ever hear of the Spanish Inquisition?  Jews, Muslims, Protestants, Atheists, and the like were all murdered or tortured, or both, by Catholics for not holding the same beliefs. This has gone on for centuries and will continue to happen until religion is once and for all completely eradicated.<br>  <br>  In conclusion, religious people hate atheists because they refuse to accept the possibility that they are wrong, and if anyone challenges their beliefs they become defensive and enraged, at times, to the point of murder. Atheists, however, don't care about all that nonsense, which is why we get along with religious people.|`|vccz6IYHaa	Because the religious people do not like their beliefs to be questioned.<br>  They don't like the idea that people don't believe in "god" and they think it is like a "sin" or something.<br>  They are probably just scared that maybe the atheists have it right.<br>  Or they think that if they associate with atheists they will go to "hell"|`|JLayHNZCaa	A lot of people who claim to be religious, must have missed the part about love thy neighbor as thyself?

9jo37B3saa	Thank you for asking a very good question.<br>  <br>  Istakhara is giving your file back to Allah, and asking Allah to choose whatever is best for you. It is not necessary that you will see something in your dream, the most important thing is that the inclination of your heart will be towards whatever Allah chooses for you. <br>  <br>  You can do istakhara for two things,<br>  (a) - whether this boy/girl is good for you.<br>  (b) - Ask Allah to give you best spouse.<br>  <br>  Insha Allah, Allah will make choosing of a good spouse and your marriage with him/her very easy.<br>  <br>  Another indication of judging what is good or bad for you is that you will get something or someone very easily if he/she/it is good for you, otherwise, you will never be able to get something or someone. And you will have to be contended after Istakahara irrespective of its outcome.|`|gDr6c4hraa	wa alykum assalam<br>  Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, and blessings and peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon all his Family and Companions. <br>  <br>  Istikhaara prayer is legislated for a Muslim when he is faced with a permissible matter and he does not know whether it is good for him so that he would proceed with it, or it is bad for him so that he would ask Allaah to remove it away from him. There is no Istikhaara prayer about an obligatory or desirable act, and it is not performed about committing a forbidden act or a dislikeable one<br>  <br>  An-Nawawi holds that "after performing the istikharah, a person must do what he is wholeheartedly inclined to do and feels good about doing and should not insist on doing what he had desired to do before making the istikharah. And if his feelings change, he should leave what he had intended to do, otherwise he is not completely leaving the choice to Allah, and would not be honest in seeking aid from Allah's power and knowledge. Sincerity in seeking Allah's choice, means that one should completely leave what he himself had desired or determined. <br>  <br>  The result of Istikhara is known by being inclined to do something and feeling good about it regardless of whether it matches what we desire or not.<br>  So, if someone feels happy to do something and does not encounter obstacles in doing it, this is an evidence that the good is in envisaging this thing and performing it.<br>  Indeed, the dream is not a condition in the result of Istikhara and there is no proof that the person who does Istikhara sees a dream directing him to the result.<br>  <br>  it is likeable to repeat Istikharah if one does not feel success at first.<br>  <br>  Allah knows best.|`|NlQhkgFCaa	It will tell you if he is the right man for you by you receiving a positive sign in your dream. Furthermore, after having had the dream, if you still want to get married to him is up to you to decide. The dream just lets you know if it will be a good thing or not to marry this man <br>  <br>  May Allah guide you|`|4sc7bMbkaa	it will tell you weather both of you are good for each other or not!!|`|stD14wWaaa	Istikhara is a prayer to be performed if you need Allah to guide you in making a good decision in life. After performing the prayer, you must do what your are most inclined to do or better yet, sleep and you might see the answer in your dream.<br>  <br>  Allah ta'alah knows best.|`|qPSkkPqwaa	Istakhara is not done for haram things, i.e masturbation.<br>  <br>  U just have to repeat the istakhara prayer more than once to be confirm that its positive but thers nothing wrong with going against the istakhara prayer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Allah knows the best and he decides not the prayer. The prayer is just a sign that it is well or not!|`|QcviYozHaa	Peace..<br>  <br>  The istikharaah is there if u are really in need of allah's decision...You should use the istikharaah for whether what ur doing is halal or haraam, and if it is haraam maybe u might not get married, and if it is halal then inshallah...Yes u can use for if u r good for eachother i.e. u love eachother and afterlife... You should pray if for 7 days and after the Esha prayer and before u go to sleep...<br>  <br>  There is 1 istikharaah...and u will find out soon, if u dont get an answer it means something 'negative' meaning u shouldnt get married etc because u are not made for eachother...<br>  <br>  Knowledge is power...<br>  <br>  Peace
ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Usually yes but some places (like SunGlass Hut) do not allow it.  It will be printed on the back of the gift card if they are like that.  Most places do though since they have already gotten their money from it.|`|gspTDufpaa	You should be able to.|`|HZls4dAnaa	well depending on what kind of gift card your talking about. if your talking about something that someone has given you as a gift and loaded their own money on to it then yah of course use as much of the gift cards as you want. remember a gift card is a card that already has preloaded money.<br>  now don't get me wrong the person that said sunglass hut doesn't do it doesn't know what she's talking about. sun glass hut does accept all the gift cards you give them. the "gift card" she's talking about is this appreciation card that rewards you $20 dollars for shopping with them and being on their mailing list. they only can do it for one transaction is because it's one time cash card that doesn't have preloaded money. its sent to everybody who is on sunglasshut's mailing list. plus it will say in the back if you can use it with anyother discounts. so if your gift card is a preloaded money card then yes use as much as you want. but if it s the other girft card that everybody else gets in the mail you can only use one at a time. hope that helps
ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	The chief temple of the goddess Athena built on the acropolis at Athens between 447 and 432 B.C. and considered a supreme example of Doric architecture. The Parthenon contained her world-renowned statue by Phidias, which ranks second only to that of Zeus by the same great artist. This colossal statue was 39 feet high, and was composed of ivory and gold; its majestic beauty formed the chief attraction of the temple. It represented her standing erect, bearing her spear and shield; in her hand she held an image of Nike, and at her feet there lay a serpent.<br>  <br>  The original Partheon was nearly destroyed completely by wars and Christians tearing down what they thought of as a graven image or demon.

mVTGl6HGaa	Warped Tour founder, Kevin Lyman stated that he believes there is an emo backlash saying that he sees "I hate emo" t-shirts and that there was hostility among bands on the tour towards emo groups.[31]<br>  <br>  In 2008, Time Magazine reported that "anti-emo" groups attacked teenagers in Mexico City, Querétaro, and Tijuana.[32][33] One of Mexico's foremost critics of emo was Kristoff, a music presenter on the popular TV channel Telehit.<br>  <br>  Gerard Way, the lead singer of My Chemical Romance stated in an interview "emo is a pile of ****", and that his "band was never emo".[34] Panic at the Disco also stated in an interview with NME: "emo is bullshit."[35] These two bands, however, tend to be classified as emo.<br>  <br>  Fans of emo are criticized[who?] for purported displays of emotion common in the scene. Complaints claimed that emotions were expressed in an histrionic manner.[36]<br>  <br>  Justin Jacobs has criticised emo music of the early 2000s, arguing it became boring and generic.[37]<br>  <br>  Emo music has been blamed for the suicide by hanging of Hannah Bond by both the coroner at the inquest into her death and her mother, Heather Bond, after it was claimed that emo music glamorized suicide and her apparent obsession with My Chemical Romance was said to be linked to her suicide. The inquest heard that she was part of an Internet "emo" cult [38] and her Bebo page contained an image of an 'emo girl' with bloody wrists.[39] It also heard that she had discussed the "glamour" of hanging online[38] and had explained to her parents that her self harming was an "emo initiation ceremony".[39] Heather Bond criticised emo fashion, saying: "There are 'emo' websites that show pink teddies hanging themselves." After the verdict was reported in NME, fans of emo music contacted the magazine to defend against accusations that it promotes self harm and suicide.[40]<br>  <br>  In Russia, a law has been presented at the Duma to regulate emo websites and forbid emo style at schools and government buildings, for fears of emo being a "dangerous teen trend" promoting anti-social behaviour, depression, social withdrawal and even suicide.[41][42]
f1oFH4rCaa	Yes, god loves you because you are his child.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Did you know that Jesus took all your sins away, from the time of your conception to the day you die? He did this when the sins of this world were laid upon Him at the start of His 3 year ministry on this earth, when He was baptized in the Jordan River by John the Baptist (Matt 3:15). It was in this River (called the river of death in Hebrew) where all our sins were laid upon Him by the laying on of hands by this last earthly high priest called John. He then only could walk to the Cross bearing all our sins where He paid for them with His very life in our stead.<br>  Once you come to know and believe in this gospel 100% then all your sins (Mark 7:20-23) will be washed away and then you will become a Spirit filled sinless person doing the righteous works of God.<br>  <br>  Grab for yourself some Free Christian Books which will guide you to become a true child of God.|`|DuyuUJNDaa	I should brush up on your grammar and spelling.

czXaUPIlaa	As with many aspects of Buddhist teaching, Right Action and the Five Precepts have both "outer" and "inner" meanings.<br>  <br>  The "outer" meaning of the precepts and Right Action is much the same - to behave in ways that promote happiness and lessen suffering. If a person simply follows the precepts -  even without understanding - then that person will live a happier life. This is how Right Action manifests in daily life: avoid taken things that are not freely offered; avoid killing and lying; avoid drinking and misconduct undertaken in lust.<br>  <br>  The "inner" meaning of the steps on the Eightfold Path and of the Five Precepts is the same in every case:  "How is it, just now?"<br>  <br>  To attain the inner meaning of these noble teachings, we must look deeply into the impulses and intentions that govern most of our actions. When we do this, we will connect with the profound sense of suffering and dissatisfaction felt by every person.<br>  <br>  As we really "get" the underlying causes of our actions, we also "get" how all human beings experience the same causes and, hence, the same suffering. At this point, our life opens in wisdom and compassion. That's the "inner" meaning of Buddhism.|`|dEdD8g0Qaa	Right action is a whole lot more than just not taking what us not yours.<br>  for monks for example, this covers all 8 recepts. meaning abstinance is also right action. <br>  <br>  in summary. right action is all about the precepts.follow the 5 precepts and youll have right action down. actually mean it, and youll have right effort down aswell.|`|RRJFI9Oqaa	Actions that help us understand mind and matter are right actions.<br>  Taking what is not given is a precept, as you rightly said.<br>  Precepts are actions that Buddhist practitioners avoid.<br>  Right actions are actions that Buddhist practitioners do.|`|6nExSFMZaa	They hit it on and off for a while but eventually had a punch up and went there separate ways.|`|bGUWUgUqaa	The phrase "taking what is not given" teaches Buddhist to be complacent about one's possession.  Some Buddhist also progressively becoming detached to the desire for personal gain (power, fame and/or wealth), via daily routines in studying the scripture, meditation, giving up bad habits, as to raise his moral characters.  The moral character upgrade provides a stronger foundation for greater inner peace.  <br>  <br>  When a Buddhist has less human desire in the mundane world, he conducts himself more righteously.  For example, "Sakyamuni’s cousin Devadutta tried to kill him many times out of jealousy, but the Buddha forgave him out of compassion.  A notorious brigand named Angulimal also tried to kill him but ended up being his student." copied from the story published at: <br>  <a href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/world/on-the-path-to-buddhahood-4982.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/world/on...</a><br>  The Buddha's 'right action' made a happy ending for two different people in this example.  For an average Buddhist, the 'right action' would lead him to resolve conflicts properly.  <br>  <br>  The basic Buddhist practice and belief is discussed in 'Falun Gong'.  Advanced practice is discussed in Zhuan Falun. About 100 million people practice in over 80 countries worldwide, enjoying a bill of good health through meditation and spiritual practice.<br>  <br>  Guided meditation demonstration video, meditation music, and books about Falun Gong are free to download from the URL listed below. If you need any help, contact a local practitioner in your area for free instructions.<br>  <br>  Falun Gong is a unique Buddhist School, found in 1992 by Master Li Hongzhi in China. Falun Gong is an ancient practice for the body, mind, and spirit based upon the universal principles of Truthfulness, Compassion, and Tolerance. Falun Gong consists of five sets of powerful exercises.<br>  <br>  Falun Gong, Tibetans, other Buddhists, and Christians have been persecuted in China. The most offensive human right violation is the organ harvesting from the Falun Gong practitioners in China.<br>  <a href="http://cipfg.org/en/news/petition.html" rel="nofollow">http://cipfg.org/en/news/petition.html</a>
UxooffHZaa	Modern religious art is usually very mediocre. That's because in Renaissance Europe, all of the best artists were creating religious art. Today, even religious artists, make at least as much secular art as religious art. So, you end up with a lot of modern religious crap, or trite work done by religious people who mean well, but really aren't great artists. <br>  My favorite piece of religious art by a modern artist is Andy Warhol's "Last Supper," which hangs in the Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh.
czXaUPIlaa	Atrocious acts are committed by every human being. This is the first truth of Buddhism.<br>  <br>  So if we wish to put an end to atrocity, we don't have to spend a single moment in righteous indignation over events that might be occurring around the globe.<br>  <br>  Instead, we might start much closer to home - with righteous indignation for the many ways in which we produce suffering for ourselves and for those around us.<br>  <br>  We might start examining the sources of our own violence, hatred, greed, deceit, and lust. When we deeply understand these sources, then we can make choices to act differently, out of the intention of helping all beings.<br>  <br>  That's what Buddha did. That is the meaning of his enlightenment.<br>  <br>  And if we wish to live with the wisdom and compassion of the Buddha, that's what we will do ourselves.<br>  ==========<br>  Later: Regarding the relationship between practitioners and the larger world. If someone ordains as a monk or nun, then their relationship to the larger world becomes very constrained. But for lay people, like me, Buddhist practice calls for deep engagement with the world around us. As you probably know, Buddhism recognizes the interdependence of all beings. Thus, we understand that every action affects a host of other beings. This calls for meticulous, aware action, moment to moment. Hard, perhaps, but this is the Buddhist path. <br>  <br>  Actually, it's not just hard, but nearly impossible. But the near-impossibility doesn't mean that we shouldn't do what we can. Each of us, given our talents, resources, and skills, must make our best effort in every moment. If we do this, then our actions are complete.<br>  <br>  Buddhist practitioners often interpret one of the steps of the Eightfold Path - Right Livelihood - as a call to social service. There are many ways of offering this service - as therapists or nurses, of course - but it can actually be offered in any context, even in casual encounters. Buddhists, particularly those trained in the Mahayana tradition, take the "bodhisattva vows" (to save all beings from suffering) quite seriously.<br>  <br>  As for enlightenment - it's not a fixed state. It's not anything that can be described. It's simply the complete turning away from self-absorption and turning toward "how can I help?" in each moment.|`|RwaoY0Zpaa	Being made of stone buddha would do nothing because like all statues buddha cannot speak, hear, talk or even feed himself.therefore I think it is safe to say buddha would do nothing and never will.|`|mjGSAGHyaa	Incinerate yourself in a public square.|`|quN4DCGWaa	Sit in the forest and meditate|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Sorry, but buddha cant to anything.

Is it possible that as you grow older, suffer some set backs, lose people you love, that the efforts you are making now to accomoate your mother will turn out not to have been a waste of time.  Is it possible that even though you feel imprisoned by your mother's wishes, you can forgive her for wanting to give you something that is special to her but not to you?  Love is in the flow of life and relationships.  Its worth is in those periods of doubt, uncertainty and irritation.|`|CUeAWCgZaa	My mom knows I don't believe in God or follow Christianity, but she still made me go to church with her. <br>  So I started working Sunday mornings. <br>  I still go to special services, like Christmas Eve and Easter, because it means a lot to her and I can sacrafice two hours of my time for her.<br>  I think someone before me mentioned talking to your dad about it.

wY8jE8HEaa	“Gospel of the Kingdom of God” <br>  <br>  MARK 1:14 Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of The Kingdom of God <br>  <br>  From the above Verse, it is clear that Christ, Jesus-The Son of Mary preached the Gospel of The Kingdom of God. This Gospel (The Good News) actually contained the Words of God because of course, it was the Gospel of The Kingdom of God which was preached ONLY by Jesus. There is not even anything as the Gospel of Jesus as noted by Mark 1:1. The words of the Gospel which Jesus (pbuh) preached, were not his words as he says: <br>  <br>  <br>  JOHN 14:24 He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me. <br>  <br>  Matthew and John were actually the disciples of Jesus (pbuh). But did they really write these Gospels by themselves. Do we have Gospels “BY” Matthew and John? From an account in the Gospel of Matthew, we can clearly see that this Gospel is not written by Matthew himself: <br>  <br>  MATTHEW 9:9 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him. <br>  <br>  If Matthew would have been the author of this Gospel, he surely would have written that “.. and he saith unto “ME”… and “I” arose and followed him.” <br>  <br>  Luke and Mark were not even the disciples of Jesus. Luke was a physician and a companion of St Paul and Mark was an interpreter who probably worked with St Peter in Rome. <br>  <br>  The Gospels also differ from each other a lot: <br>  <br>  Was Joseph the Son of Jacob (MATTHEW 1:16) or was he the Son of Heli (LUKE 3:23)? <br>  <br>  Why isn’t the ascension of Jesus (pbuh) to heaven mentioned in Matthew and John? <br>  <br>  These Gospels which were written down 100 Years after Jesus (pbuh) ascension, circulated anonymously, no names were attached to them until almost 200 and the Christian theologians who came up with the idea of having a New Testament was condemned as heretic. <br>  <br>  Do we have that True Gospel which Jesus Christ (pbuh) Preached in Hebrew or Aramaic? <br>  Did Jesus (pbuh) asked Matthew, Mark, Luke and John to write these Gospels? <br>  How can Christians rely on the accounts in these Gospels which are the basic Pillars of their Faith?<br>  <br>  <br>  Did Jesus or his Apostles follow a religion called Christianity? Who were the first 'Christians' ? Who founded Christianity and do the teachings of Christianity conform to the teachings of Jesus? <br>  <br>  The teachings of Paul, the true founder of Christianity, cannot be found anywhere in the teachings of Jesus or in those of prophets before him.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	At the end of his Gospel, St. John stated that there was so much more to tell, and that if it were all told, there were not enough books in the world to hold the story. Yes, we see Jesus' birth, then skip to one incident when He was 12, then skip again to the last three years of His life. As biographies go, it's pretty scant. Apparently, He did not start preaching or working any miracles until the wedding feast at age 30, and He was reluctant to start then, but that began His ministry.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	The Bible was obviously not all written by the same author, and it is not chronological. It's a compilation of several writings by several authors. There were many books and writings that people had been reading for years but that were left out of the Bible for one reason or another.

This is why we say Christianity is life, and not just a religion. Meaning you can't be a good christian jut by reading the bible, instead it is a way of life, and for it to be complete it has to be both the Church and the bible. This was also Jesus' command.<br>  <br>  Remember I'm not saying the church as a building, but as a place where the holy spirit is floating, which is why church allows us to receive the holy spirit and god in our hearts, so this and the bible gives us christian lives|`|3KD6RRhPaa	Says someone who knows everything.

These arms are used by the Queen in her official capacity as monarch, and are officially known as her Arms of Dominion. Variants of the Royal Arms are used by other members of the Royal Family; and by the British Government in connection with the administration and government of the country. In Scotland, the Queen has a separate version of the Royal Arms, a variant of which is used by the Scotland Office.<br>  <br>  Before the act of union the Royal arms for scotland were flanked by two Unicorns and the Royal arms of England were flanked by two Lions.<br>  <br>  The Lion is a very old symbol of English Royalty, first used by King of England who reigned 1154–1189. You should note that in the Middle Ages, when lions became a major element in heraldry, few Europeans had any chance to see actual lions. The lions were, for them, nearly as much as legendary animals as were dragons or griffins, also commonly appearing on coats of arms.<br>  <br>  The most consistent depiction is in keeping with their image of "king of the jungle" or "king of the beasts", hence lions are popular symbols of royalty and stateliness and a symbol of bravery.<br>  <br>  A unicorn is depicted as a horse with a goat's cloven hooves and beard, a lion's tail, and a slender, spiral horn on its forehead. Whether because it was an emblem of the Incarnation or of the fearsome animal passions of raw nature, the unicorn was not widely used in early heraldry, but became popular from the 15th century. <br>  <br>  The Imagery and interpretation of the unicorn is vast;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn</a>|`|RjJMV20taa	This surname of QUEEN is a French nickname from the Norman forms of the Old French word CHIENNE (*****). The name was rendered in medieval documents in the Latin form CANIS. It was also a topographic name for someone who lived by an oak tree, from a Norman or Picard form of CHENE. The name is also spelt QUESNE, DUQUESNE, QUESNET, QUENET, QUESNEL, QUENEL, QUESNAY and DUQUESNAY. The name was brought into England in the wake of the Norman Invasion of 1066, and the earliest of the name on record appears to be Matilda le QUEN, who was recorded in County Oxford in the year 1273. Alicia QWENE of Yorkshire, was listed in the Yorkshire Poll Tax of 1379, and Johannes QUENESON appears in the same document. It was not until the 10th century that modern hereditary surnames first developed, and the use of fixed names spread, first to France, and then England, then to Germany and all of Europe. In these parts of Europe, the individual man was becoming more important, commerce was increasing and the exact identification of each man was becoming a necessity. Even today however, the Church does not recognise surnames. Baptisms and marriages are performed through use of the Christian name alone. Thus hereditary names as we know them today developed gradually during the 11th to the 15th century in the various European countries. A later instance of the name includes Richard QUENE who registered at Oxford University in the year 1511. Notable members of the name include Ellery QUEEN (1905-82) pseudonym of Frederick Dannay and his cousin Manfred B Lee, American writers of crime fiction, both born in Brooklyn, New York. As business men they entered for a detective-story competition and won with 'The Roman Hat Mystery' (1929). From then on they concentrated on detective fiction. In 1941 they founded Ellery QUEEN's Mystery Magazine. The lion depicted in the arms is the noblest of all wild beasts which is made to be the emblem of strength and valour, and is on that account the most frequently borne in Coat-Armour.

AA11440601	No.<br>  <br>  You need to learn history from a historian and not someone who has an agenda.<br>  <br>  Modern historians have long known that the popular view of the Inquisition is a myth. The Inquisition was actually an attempt by the Catholic Church to stop unjust executions. <br>  <br>  Heresy was a capital offense against the state. Rulers of the state, whose authority was believed to come from God, had no patience for heretics. Neither did common people, who saw heretics as dangerous outsiders who would bring down divine wrath. <br>  <br>  When someone was accused of heresy in the early Middle Ages, they were brought to the local lord for judgment, just as if they had stolen a pig. It was not easy to discern whether the accused was really a heretic. The lord needed some basic theological training, very few did. The sad result is that uncounted thousands across Europe were executed by secular authorities without fair trials or a competent judge of the crime. <br>  <br>  The Catholic Church's response to this problem was the Inquisition, an attempt to provide fair trials for accused heretics using laws of evidence and presided over by knowledgeable judges. <br>  <br>  From the perspective of secular authorities, heretics were traitors to God and the king and therefore deserved death. From the perspective of the Church, however, heretics were lost sheep who had strayed from the flock. As shepherds, the pope and bishops had a duty to bring them back into the fold, just as the Good Shepherd had commanded them. So, while medieval secular leaders were trying to safeguard their kingdoms, the Church was trying to save souls. The Inquisition provided a means for heretics to escape death and return to the community.<br>  <br>  Most people tried for heresy by the Inquisition were either acquitted or had their sentences suspended. Those found guilty of grave error were allowed to confess their sin, do penance, and be restored to the Body of Christ. The underlying assumption of the Inquisition was that, like lost sheep, heretics had simply strayed.<br>  <br>  If, however, an inquisitor determined that a particular sheep had purposely left the flock, there was nothing more that could be done. Unrepentant or obstinate heretics were excommunicated and given over to secular authorities. Despite popular myth, the Inquisition did not burn heretics. It was the secular authorities that held heresy to be a capital offense, not the Church. The simple fact is that the medieval Inquisition saved uncounted thousands of innocent (and even not-so-innocent) people who would otherwise have been roasted by secular lords or mob rule.<br>  <br>  Where did this myth come from? After 1530, the Inquisition began to turn its attention to the new heresy of Lutheranism. It was the Protestant Reformation and the rivalries it spawned that would give birth to the myth. Innumerable books and pamphlets poured from the printing presses of Protestant countries at war with Spain accusing the Spanish Inquisition of inhuman depravity and horrible atrocities in the New World. <br>  <br>  For more information, see:<br>  The Real Inquisition, By Thomas F. Madden, National Review (2004) <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/madden200406181026.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/ma...</a><br>  Inquisition by Edward Peters (1988)<br>  The Spanish Inquisition by Henry Kamen (1997)<br>  The Spanish Inquisition: Fact Versus Fiction, By Marvin R. O'Connell (1996): <a href="http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/history/world/wh0026.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholiceducation.org/article...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ. |`|lNtwpzpOaa	Oh, another wonderful misunderstanding.<br>  <br>  The Church did not slaughter people who wanted to worship God. <br>  <br>  The Church did ask for people to come back to the Catholic Church because they were heretics. When these people refused, they were officially excommunicated from the Church and released. <br>  <br>  Now, many states (i.e. countries) had laws about religion and many of these states were Catholic. Thus, when the Church released them, they were arrested by the states and tortured and put to death.<br>  <br>  Now, next thing: Many people "died" via effigies, which is the burning of pictorial depictions. In the records, this was counted as a death, but the people were released with their lives in tact. <br>  <br>  This wasn't hidden from anyone, if you read history you would know this. <br>  <br>  No, the Pope is not the Anti-Christ, nor will he be. No, you're not in the wrong 'version' of Christianity, but it is up to you to learn about your faith and understand it. <br>  <br>  Think about this: England had numerous Catholics slaughtered when King Henry changed the religion to Anglican. <br>  <br>  The hundreds of Jesuit priests were killed in England. <br>  <br>  3 million Catholics were killed during WWII<br>  <br>  Today, being Catholic in China means death: either instant or worked in work camps until you die. <br>  <br>  There are many places where Catholics are persecuted and put to death, but I don't see you saying anything about that.<br>  <br>  Learn your faith, not just what you're told.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	What are you talking about the Inquisitions? The Church did not slaughter people who wanted to worship God, that is an absolute lie. <br>  <br>  In order to understand the Inquisitions, you need to understand the government and the society of the time. Its not so simple as to judge in hindsight. Fact is that many people chose to be tried in the ecclesiastical court because they were treated better than the civil court. Civil and Church law were one and the same at that time. Speaking heresy could get you killed by the civil authorities. So breaking Church law, was against the law and you could be tortured and killed by the civil courts if you didn't rescind. Many times, the Church tried to intervene and have people rescind before getting to the civil authorities, thereby saving their lives. <br>  <br>  The worst thing you can do is listen to propaganda and anti-Catholic roderick. The Inquisitions did happen, the Church does not deny that, but it's not the picture painted by many Protestants. <br>  <br>  The Spanish Inquisition was actually run by the State, and ordered by Queen Isabella. Pope Sixtus did order an "inquisition" which is an order to investigate and root out heresy. This is not an order to torture and kill people. But it became about greed and power. The Crown gained a great deal of wealth through the inquisitions. <br>  <br>  So, you need to know the whole story. It's easy to point fingers and make assumptions, but its better to be truly informed and know the truth.<br>  <br>  Here are some links for more information:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catholic.com/library/Inquisition.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.com/library/Inquisit...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08026a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08026a.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://socrates58.blogspot.com/2006/11/inquisition-crusades-catholic-scandals.html" rel="nofollow">http://socrates58.blogspot.com/2006/11/i...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/3231/Jewish-Community-Of-Malta/The-Spanish-Inquisition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/323...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  |`|nChbnDvyaa	I would like for you to cite the source of your information.

No single person knows who the Antichrist really is. Its possible that the Antichrist is not even on Earth yet.<br>  <br>  I was once Catholic, but I eventually became an atheist because I never got to experience God. I was a taught doctrine of Roman Catholicism, but I don't think that I was ever taught about the holy spirit to any great extent. They didn't teach us how to speak in tongues, heal people, and do other amazing things. Its as if it was all about them.<br>  <br>  Seriously, I advise you to find a non-denomination church will you may be baptized of the spirit. The only doctrine that must be obeyed is that of God's. We are to worship, serve, and pray to no one or nothing but God. Mary is NOT God, and if a person worships her, they are breaking one of God's commandments.|`|HU16o2nfaa	Before you can even begin to contemplate big ideas, such as religion, you need to master the little stuff, i.e., spelling and writing coherent questions.|`|mTu882m5aa	If you would like more answers, consider asking around this site as well...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://christianforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=26" rel="nofollow">http://christianforums.com/forumdisplay....</a>
AA10052130	If you want to know the truth about Christianity, go to the source -- the Bible.<br>  <br>  Firstly, the Bible does not say that people go to heaven after they die; that is a myth.  What the Bible does declare, is that what God has in store for those who live godly (keep the commandments and live by faith in Jesus Christ), is far more awesome than anyone can imagine.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 2:9 -- But as it is written: "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him."<br>  <br>  And it goes on to say that God reveals what is in store for those who love him:<br>  10 But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.<br>  <br>  And it reveals that we will inherit all things:<br>  <br>  Hebrews 2:6-8 -- But one testified in a certain place, saying: "What is man that You are mindful of him, Or the son of man that You take care of him?  You have made him a little lower than the angels; You have crowned him with glory and honor, And set him over the works of Your hands.  You have put all things in subjection under his feet."  For in that He put all in subjection under him, He left nothing that is not put under him.<br>  <br>  And it states:<br>  <br>  Romans 8:19-21 -- For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.  For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope; because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.<br>  <br>  All of God's creation will be subject to the resurrected saints.  And there will be, literally, no end to the possibilities.<br>  .|`|2d2ZuimCaa	Live in paradise and serve our Lord forever|`|KnL8PS3Eaa	I believe that nothing happens but honestly none of us know.

When you die you simply become bug food.|`|o3Jpfflgaa	I'm certainly not trying to be sarcastic or closed-minded here, so please understand I'd like to help.<br>  <br>  There is a huge difference between Christianity and Religion.  Christianity is based on the Deity and sacrifice of Jesus Christ for individual sin.  We are all sinners and we need to realize our sin, repent of it, accept Jesus Christ as our Savior.  In that way, Christians do go to Heaven.<br>  <br>  These others are religions.  Religion, by the original definitions, means a system of works, deeds, and thought where a person can make themselves acceptable to God (or whatever "god" they think exists).<br>  <br>  Heaven will be a place of glory, light, praise of God, and eternal perfect living.  Christians will live in perfect health, have perfect fellowship, and will live a perfectly-contented eternal existence.  Only those who accept Christ will experience this.  We don't know what all we will do in Heaven, but we do know it will be an absolutely perfect existence with no pain, sickness, dying, ill-will, or any other bad thing.<br>  <br>  As to those who have never heard of Christ and have never had the Gospel preached to them, I think that God will judge them by how they obeyed the inborn sense of right and wrong God gives them.<br>  <br>  Those who reject Christ as Savior will go to Hell for a temporary time until their final judgment.  After that judgment, they will be cast alive into the Lake of Fire to be punished forever, because they rejected God's provision for salvation, Jesus Christ.  This punishment is eternal.  Once created, the soul lives forever.|`|33oaWdNPaa	lol, intelligent boy you will soon realize that nobody knows the answer to that question but everyone thinks they understand... i'm sure when you are old and laying in your death bed decades from now you will have a better understanding of what happends next, until then just chill and enjoy the things that being youthful has to offer. |`|ozi4eTnHaa	Worm food.|`|6170974434ada9d54dff4478d433a10baa	Once we reach heaven, we will experience total fulfillment as human beings. People try various things to try to feel happy and successful and fulfilled here on earth, but these things never satisfy completely because here on earth we can experience only a small portion of what is godly - joy, peace, love, beauty, satisfaction, fulfillment, etc. But in heaven we will experience the absolute fullness of these godly attributes forever. It is what human beings were created for, and once we attain it we will never again experience anything negative - no pain, suffering, rejection, embarrassment, unpleasantness, sadness, depression, fear, boredom,  etc. Only the fullness of the opposite. It will be just fantastic! As the bible tells us, no eye has seen nor has any ear heard the wonder of what God has prepared for those who love Him!!!  See you there!!!

cd2etz5Raa	The Bible proves that Christ was NOT born on December 25th. What's even more interesting is that according to the Bible, He wasn't even born in winter! <br>  <br>  - - -<br>  <br>  Luke 2:1 - 6 (NLT)<br>  <br>  "At that time the Roman emperor, Augustus, decreed that a census should be taken throughout the Roman Empire. (This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria. All returned to their own ancestral towns to register for this census. <br>  <br>  And because Joseph was a descendant of King David, he had to go to Bethlehem in Judea, David’s ancient home. He traveled there from the village of Nazareth in Galilee. He took with him Mary, his fiancee, who was now obviously pregnant.<br>  <br>  And while they were there, the time came for her baby to be born. She gave birth to her first child, a son. She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no lodging available for them."<br>  <br>  - - -<br>  <br>  This census has only been taken during Jewish holiday called "Sukkot" which is typically in either September or October.

ea338428f11ccb6b0f8f147ef07f64a3aa	Wow.  I've got an opnion on nearly everything.  Except this.<br>  <br>  I do not know how you can effectively decide it in a fair manner.  Unless it was some kind of progressive punishment, there has to be a crossed line/age of majority.  18?  15? ????  And what criteria?  How do you know for certain if there's requisite comprehension?<br>  <br>  Some things are obvious, like when there's been serious talk of trying 10 year olds as adults.  That comes up every once in a while.  That's not appropriate, and it just seems to be media grandstanding when it comes up.<br>  <br>  I'm stumped otherwise.  Stumped.  I'm really glad I'm not part of how this sort of thing gets decided.|`|nMLomteraa	It was on NPR the other day!! wow!<br>  <br>  The experts wanted to rehabilitate the kids (because "children do not have the same morals & reasoning capabilities as an adult does!" they say), which go to real jail but not mixed with adult population, for their safety. Solitary confinement is difficult or impossible to rehab adult offenders back to the general population.<br>  <br>  I'd like the kids to realize how serious the crime was one day!!! (So, yes, you do the crime, you MUST get punished somehow!)  But if I was the victim's family, we all know that life in prison will not bring the victim back to life. No point. so, I don't know. How does one determine punishment? If the child or adult offender  is a threat to the community he must remain locked up.|`|KNKLAmuNaa	I think the cutoff is 16 for certain serious offences, but don't quote me on that. It isn't necessarily inflexible at 18. I know that the legal system does take into account whether or not a minor who does something like this knew what he was doing.<br>  <br>  Normally kids just don't commit such serious offences- it just doesn't happen much. Young people are far more likely to commit summary offences like loitering, shoplifting and the like.<br>  <br>  Younger kids often don't fully understand what they're doing when they commit crimes like this. And putting a 15 year old kid in prison with a bunch of hardened crims is not really fair, is it?|`|jM7CyxQzaa	Personally I'm all for getting more tough with them, half of them KNOW that under current law they can't be punished as harshly as an adult.<br>  <br>  So far as I'm concerned if you're old enough to commit the crime and there is absolutely no doubt about your guilt then you are DEFINATELY old enough to take full responsibility and punishment for it.|`|6nExSFMZaa	I actually think more adults should be treated like children.|`|oDxTEqdraa	I believe if you can drive, then you know how to follow laws and you know the difference between right and wrong.|`|971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	Yup.

If they are old enough to commit such a heinous crime, then they are old enough to be punished for it.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	All serious crimes by minors are still heard in court and treated appropriately to their age, ability to understand the law and/or the consequences of their actions - this is relevant to doli incapax in which a child under 10 is not legally responsible for their actions, however increasing levels of discretion are expected between 10 - 18 years.<br>  <br>  At least in Australia this occurs, anyway. I am unsure about the US legal system.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	If they understood it was wrong, yes.  If they did not have the capacity to understand the wrongness of their crimes, then maybe their parents should be punished for not teaching them better or for not keeping better tabs on them.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Yelp <br>  .<br>  Some of them are smarter than adults<br>  .|`|U7sBZKUuaa	They already are.
ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Yeah.  Who made up all that crap?|`|BzrUWCsDaa	Lot was trying to buy some time here. He likely knew the angry mob were mostly homosexual  & wouldn't have been interested in his daughters sexually so he knew they would be safe.<br>  But mostly, he had faith in God's protection. He knew that Jehovah would protect his daughters .... and the bible record shows that he was right, they were unharmed.<br>  <br>  btw - humans are not higher than angels, where did you get that idea from?|`|ch9ipCTKaa	Lot did not know his guests were angels, to him they were just men and although to surrender his daughters would have been a difficult thing to do, he knew that the sin of homosexuality was much worse. <br>  <br>  This is relevant because the men of Sodom were intending to rape the angels, or men as Lot perceived them, basically the better of the 2 evils.|`|M3Xmqlt8aa	It is a peculiar propaganda put forward in that story,|`|oDxTEqdraa	He was a pimp daddy.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	first off,Lot did not know they were angels in the begininng. according to biblical apocrypha, the host and visiter realtionship during those times were far more important than how we view/treat visitors today. how the ppl treated ppl and visitors during those times in the land weighed heavily on their character and reputation and how the men were regarded in their own country in the land.. and they literally would roll out the red carpet and put themselevs out for the sake of being a gracious host to thier guest. this included offering daughters sometimes(however in this case, this was a last minute desperate act of Lot to not cause any harm to come upon his guest).. it was just a different time and different values then... today , yes we would say that is sick, but it was the custom.. i studied this at the university of michigan theological studies... lot didnt realize they were angels until a little later on.. re-read the scripture.. it was when they told him they were going to destroy the city that night  and he and his family would be saved.. this is the first indication or implication that he realized they were angels.lastly, the angels did not need lot's help, according to the story, they took up for themselves just fine, saved lot from getting his butt kicked, and did what they were supposed to do as warriors for Christ!...|`|FfBll2n8aa	How many times in the bible were the rights of women placed above the rights of anyone or anything else? It's obvious men wrote it. Thankfully, it's not true. It's disturbing to think that people who believe in that stuff though, still find reason to worship the God responsible. That's the scariest part for me.|`|PnE35NZlaa	I know.It sound horrible.<br>  Some of the answerers said that Lot might have done it because he knew that the men were homosexual and wouldnt have wanted his daughters but i read that the homosexual things done in Sodom and Gomorrah wernt necessary "gay" men that were just enjoying/lusting over sleeping with other men but that the homosexual things were done as a method of sadistically/brutally controlling their victim-for example i dont know if you read there was a story about a new york police officer that apprehended a criminal in a train station and then raped him with his baton to try to sadistically have power over him and make him feel fear and submission etc so these men from sodom and gomorrah might not have necessarily been purely gay men per say(although you'd think you'd still have to be pretty gay somewhere to just do something like that)but could have still been men that were married or also interested in women so i dont if the theory of Lot assuming thy wouldnt want his daughters is necesarrily true|`|RPLsG63caa	the bible doesn't say but here could be the reasons:<br>  1. Lot had faith that God or the angels would protect them before anything bad would happen<br>  2. since his daughters were engaged to 2 of the Sodom's men that those pressing Lot's door were perhaps family of his future sons in law and they wouldn't touch their women<br>  3. the mob only wanted men and Lot's girls would have been gross & repugnant to them.<br>  <br>  whatever the reason Lot had faith the he and his family were safe with the angels being there. and u see how the story played out.

It is obviously not God, as even a first year mystic knows God is infinitely simplex. Complexity is an illusion of perception. The human body is many cells, but only through a microscope, to our perception it is only one thing. The sea and the earth are only two in our perception, but we move out to space, then they become one, as one earth. The galaxy is many stars but only in our perception within, move without it and it is only one galaxy. So obviously, any view of complexity only exists in those who do not have the high enough level of perception. That is, as any real Master can tell you, matter is complex, God is simply God.|`|MKWkPH2vaa	About as impossible as it is to believe many of the other things I have been told in my life.

zcwSIBHwaa	Most hindus have a very open mind and view all other religions just another path to the same goal. This is explained by the many gods that always existed in India. A worshipper of Vishnu does not try to kill a worshipper of Shiva, or viceversa, they respect each other and their differences. Likewise, they respect Christians and Jesus. <br>  <br>  I think that they consider Jesus just a manifestation of Brahman, the impersonal essence of reality. I don't know if any school considers Jesus an avatar of an Hindu god. What I know is that Vaishnavas consider the Buddha an avatar of Vishnu.|`|dEdD8g0Qaa	I had a hindu collegue who actually did have a large statue of jesus in hi living room. richt next to a statue of Shiva. for hindu's the form is often irrelevant, its what the form represents that is to be worshipped.<br>  <br>  and by that definition, you can worship a lot ^^<br>  <br>  so yes, sometimes they do. but i dont believe there are actual schools of hinduism that recognise Jesus as an avatar.|`|3uCHDwtSaa	Before answering your question, I would try to explain Hinduism or Hindu:<br>  1. You can be a non believer still you can call yourself Hindu.<br>  2. You can believe in ONE GOD, still you can call yourself Hindu.<br>  3. You can believe in Statue, still you can call yourself Hindu.<br>  4. You do not believe Statue, still you can call your self Hindu<br>  5. You believe in million God or all incarnation including Jesus or few of the incarnation only of your choice and still you can call yourself Hindu.<br>  Means Hinduism does not have boundaries, it is individuls who create boundaries for himself and believes in his own defined criteria of Hinduism. But no one can stop anyone calling himself Hindu as long as that individual (whatever his/her belief or practice of worship) wants to call himself/herself Hindu.<br>  I hope it is clear so it has nothing to do with India but you find more incarnations in India because of the full freedom in India, whereas in other part of the world the freedom of speech or belief was not as much as it prevailed in Indian subcontinent.

But for all we knw they are just a group of business men who are keen on globalistation.<br>  <br>  Heres the rational explanation- Gordon wanted to bring back a political 'big beast' so that his cabinet could have some experience again and Mandelson is the closest thing new labour have left that hasn't retired or decided they hate Gordon Brown. He's still a corrupt idiot though. <br>  If anything is helping Mandelson it is his unwavering love for the European Union. He is part of the bunch of crazed Eurocrats that keep Britain a member even though we dont benefit from it.<br>  <br>  All I know for sure is he got gunged by protestors the other day, he deserved that.|`|R0mZqqfXaa	As high as the light bulb.

There is no tail attached to it.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, the spine has to end somewhere. You are just assuming that the end of the spine is the tailbone.<br>  <br>  Tails are more complex than some skin swinging from the backside. Many animals have tails that serve a variety of functions. They are used for balance, climbing, hanging, fighting and other things. Each tail is perfectly designed to do what it does.<br>  <br>  Since man walks upright, he doesn't need a tail. Why would he then have one?<br>  <br>  By your logic, since man has a common ancestor with birds, he should have vestigial wings. Since man has a common ancestor with fish, he should have scales and gills. Since man has a common ancestor as flowers, he should have roots.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	It's not a "tailbone".

Just goes to show God's attention to detail. (By the way I do believe in Evolution.)|`|6da9fc95750697efdd42250b1870e90eaa	This is no different from the question why God gave us the tiny appendix. We thought the appendix didn't have any function at all, but now we know that it is involved in the immune system and maintenance of our gut flora. We are in no position to ask why we have a coccyx but what we can be sure of is that God gave it to us because we need it :)<br>  <br>  From Wikipedia:<br>  In humans and other tailless primates (e.g. great apes) since Nakalipithecus (a Miocene hominoid), the coccyx is the remnant of a vestigial tail, but still not entirely useless;it is an important attachment for various muscles, tendons and ligaments  — which makes it necessary for physicians and patients to pay special attention to these attachments when considering surgical removal of the coccyx.[1] Additionally, it is also part of the weight-bearing tripod structure which act as a support for a sitting person. When a person sits leaning forward, the ischial tuberosities and inferior rami of the ischium take most of the weight, but as the sitting person leans backward, more weight is transferred to the coccyx.<br>  <br>  The anterior side of the coccyx serves for the attachment of a group of muscles important for many functions of the pelvic floor (i.e. defecation, continence, etc): The levator ani muscle, which include coccygeus, iliococcygeus, and pubococcygeus. Through the anococcygeal raphé, the coccyx supports the position of the anus. Attached to the posterior side is gluteus maximus which extend the thigh during ambulation.|`|P1Sl55Coaa	I don't know.  But, does that prove that God doesn't exist?  If he does, which I think is obvious, He probably knows a lot more about balance and sitting than you do.  He invented flight, hung the stars, balances the Earth on nothing, and you think modern science knows more than He does?  Did you know that when the Scopes Trial was taking place, we thought there were 120 "vestigial" organs in the human body.  Do you know how many there are now?  None.  <br>  <br>  Evolution is a science stopper, and causes people to die for lack of research.  I'm glad we found out what the "vestigial" organs really do, since they don't think they were worth investigating since they were OBVIOUSLY left over from our inner fish.  Evolution is self refuting, and makes no logical sense.  It's already been shown to be false.  Do some reading in books that aren't allowed in government schools, and perhaps you will learn something.<br>  <br>  One question for you, does the fact that nobody knows what the tailbone is for, mean that it must have no function?  Or, could it be that we just aren't as smart as our creator, and never will be?<br>  <br>  PS, hey terri, we didn't evolve from Apes.  We supposedly have a missing common ancestor with them.  Get it right, and people will stop having to correct you, too.|`|PTw2PIPkaa	that minor function is enough for it to be of good use that's why god gave us a coccyx.  otherwise your *** wouldn't be able to sit in a chair.  also, do all monkeys have tails?

If he does get involved with a school for the blind or the United Way, which provides services for the blind, they would be able to give him many different options I'm sure.

Other jobs...<br>  <br>  technology person, store clerk, chemist, biologist, physicist, teacher of any grade, uh. He can do what-ever he wants. A blind person can do anything a sighted person can do except drive, so I don't suggest desiring a career as a pizza driver. What college degree does he have? I'd suggest that he start from there. By limiting what he can do because of his blindness, he is making blindness his life. I know its weird, I lost my vision pretty recently and I'm still getting used to it sometimes. Electrician, plumber, um. I'm kind of blanking on the random careers in the world. There is a visually impaired guy who is govenor of New York I think... He can be a linguist... I think you get the point :) Good luck! And I recomend learning braille. Its been the most useful tool to me. I don't care what people say, listening is not the same as reading. I love to read and braille has allowed me to continue my reading ways :D<br>  <br>  note: people ask me all teh time, "Do you want to work in a blind school?" hell no. gen. ed all the way! j/k I want to be able to progress in my career someday and be on school pannels and such.

There are doctors who are blind. He can also change his vocation slightly and become a different kind of doctor - perhaps a psychiatrist - someone who does not need to see anything to treat.

He is obviously a clever man, Brail could be the way to go, even teaching perhaps.  Another idea that springs to mind is something like hospital radio because obviously that is all "sound" which would be quite interesting.<br>  Im sure Guide Dogs for the Blind might have suitable vacancies because after they are there to represent the blind.<br>  Please do not let him give up, there has to be so much out there for him to do you just have to find it.

It seems to be natural for human beings to assume there is order in the universe.  When there is order, we can communicate with each other and we can co-operate.  Without that there would be no civilisation.  This extreme urge to want there to be order, and create beliefs about it even to the extent of bizarre stories and impossible fairytales, is the natural result of evolving as we did.<br>  <br>  However, order is not ultimate truth - it is a man-made creation just to help us make sense of it all.  God is just the same - the concept of god provided an explanation for primitive peoples.  People don't like things changing either - one of the biggest segments of management courses is on how to help people cope with change.<br>  <br>  The real truth is chaos.  I appreciate that, and yet even I as a theistic Satanist am merely human and find it helpful to anthropomorphise the powers of chaos that are "out there", hence Satan and the demons.  But as Satanists we do understand chaos and this is often the hardest thing for a beginning Satanist to get their head round - there is no right way what we do "should" work.  There is no right or wrong, just pragmatism.  I enjoy the delicious paradoxes of chaos, though!|`|xelkbdbdaa	Despite the nature of the universe, it is quite clear that the Earth is controlled.

AA11514493	Many times.<br>  As a former paramedic I have seen death, under very many different circumstances.<br>  Perhaps it does, and if this is something that gives you comfort..then hold on to it and never let anyone tell you otherwise.<br>  For the scientific minded, when the body shuts down, it empties. Muscles relax and any fluids inside will then be released. However..that doesn't mean a single tear may not be the sign you are looking for.|`|W8bs2VQSaa	As a nurse, I've been with many, many people when they died. I've never seen the single tear as you mentioned. A persons eyes may be a little watery at the time of death. Or they may not - it isn't always the same. If you believe that this was a sign to you of your Dad's soul leaving his body, that will make you feel better, and that is fine. We all have our different beliefs. Best wishes to you.|`|Xxt4pEyEaa	I use to be a nurse's assistant and seen many people die...never a tear. But one elderly lady coded and was brought back.

I was not with them at the actual death .  In laws were cancer and mom's was a stroke.  All of them had things that happened that I witnessed that made me firmly believe they were being called home. The all were reaching, reaching, reaching and smiling and so happy.  I asked my mom about the reaching , what , who ?  She never gave me a clear answer but looked me straight in the eye and clearly said I will miss you. I feel she knew she was leaving us , a little bit in heaven and a little bit still on earth.  She died about 4 hours after this and it was one of the last things she said.<br>  There were no tears on my loved ones faces but there have been a lot on mine. I really miss them.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	I was told once that a man measured peoples'  weight just before dying and weighed the deceased right after death occurred and that body weighed less by a few ozs. <br>  <br>  If the idea that someone passed on to the afterlife comforts you, then by all means continue that belief. <br>  <br>  Peace.|`|AA12363470	yes i seen a few get shot and killed. it is not pretty|`|qXq0nmBzaa	At the age of three, I held my beloved grandfather's hand as he died.<br>  I remember him giving me one last squeeze...|`|AA10159725	i have heard of the one tear too.  it probably has something to do with the soul leaving the body or the last thoughts they have like :how much they are going to miss their loved ones,  the beauty they see when entering heaven or even seeing the face of a loved one who came to take them to heaven.<br>  <br>  when my mother in law died we all were in the room.  my husband,me, and his 3 cousins.  we were bound and determined that mom would have someone with her when she passed.   for one reason or another, we all had to leave room ( bathroom, phone call, drink of water)  we were not gone more than 1 minute.  she waited for us all to leave.  <br>  <br>  i've seen peaceful faces, but i've also heard of faces of fear or dread|`|D0dWmhFxaa	I have seen the faces of two dead people. I always make it a point to go see them and check out (the only words I could really think of using) how they were prepared for the funeral, out of curiosity and being a former med student. I didn't notice that, and I wouldn't think it possible with the cotton under their eyes, but maybe it depends who is looking at them. In your case, it was someone very very dear to you, so their soul allowed you to see that. In my case, it was a man I didn't really know and the other was my great grandfather, whom I was not perticularly close to, and I didn't see it. Although there was one person I probably would have liked to see during her funeral, but the body was not there. If I had seen her, I probably would have seen it...<br>  <br>  I think it is possible, especially if they were close to you. I have always believed that the soul of a person is present at their funeral, looking over things...trying to comfort people...|`|VQNHDTeQaa	I don't think there's any way to prove what is really happening to the deceased.When one dies the body releases all bodily fluids .The tear as you call it could be nothing more than some fluid leaving the opening of the eye..  I've been in Church most of my life and I've never <br>  <br>  heard of anything,No muscle to control it and it just drips or comes out on it's own.  I hope this will help you to come to a decision on this.  If you allow it-----it can drive you batty. about it.  So, I feel it's just fluids escaping the body Similar to the relaxed muscles of the bladder and colon.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	I've been with 4 people when they've died and I've seen 2 of them tear.

I have been with only two people at the time of their death and my observations, I am sure, were not at all clear to me as far as this detail. Your question was very interesting and the answers were all informative. I suspect that those people who attend many deaths are far more knowledgeable than most of us. "Life after life" or " near death experiences" also referred to as ' out of body experiences"  are not uncommon around hospitals. Doctors and especially nurses who attend the terminally ill have stories to tell.|`|xL6zc0bOaa	When your dad died, someone he really loved came to take him home, they are called tears of joy.<br>  Just before my mother died, she saw my brother who died in Australia, she put her arms out to him<br>  she also had the tear of Joy.|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	I seen My Mom, Dad, Older Sister and father in law die but they didn't shed a tear, I guess different bodies react in a different ways.|`|AA12066269	I saw my brother-in-law die.

8d220f500762c84b66042158d9d97babaa	Respond to their comments with a question. When they make a snide remark, ask, "What do you mean?' Keep asking the same type of question. "What exactly are you implying? What do you mean by that comment? Do people who clean houses offend you? Do self employed people offend you? Do stay at home moms offend you?" Just keep asking until they embarrass themselves answering. Stay in control of the conversation and don't let them change the subject. This is a technique that detectives use while interrogating suspects. It's also a technique therapists use when psychoanalyzing patients. It's hard to do but when it's done right, it's very affective. Good Luck and I'm sorry your friends are being such jerks.

YOU ARE.  Let me explain.  If you felt good about you, if yourself esteem was okay and you were okay with yourself this would not be an issue.. You would have dumped these folks a long time ago.  What you do for  a living, where you live and how much money you make does not make a person.  I know lawyers that have zero taste or manners but then again I know a young mom on welfare that is one of the smartest, nicest people I have ever met. People who judge people are lacking something inside theme selves, its the old tear ya down to build me up.  You cannot fix these people.  Saying anything to them will not change one thing, only give them more to talk about in regards to you.  What needs to change is the reason why you choose to be a part of a circle that does nothing for you, except rip you apart. Examine how you feel about yourself.  Don't put yourself in the situation where any one ever and I mean ever puts you down.  Your a princess, a goddess.  Surround yourself with people who treat you as such.  When the years pass and your in your eighties who has sown good seeds will reap the rewards.  I work with the elderly in the medical field.  I see it every day, the snobby older lady comes alone no help from family no true friends.  If she is lucky she still has enough money left to hire someone to take care of her at home.  The little old ladies who were once young and like yourself have kids who remember and help there Mom and they have friends who are true to them right to the end.  What is worse is that there kids are probably being programmed the same way, what are they saying to your kids to damage there self esteem . Good luck <br>  Ps.. go to the local Mall and walk it.. You can get excersise and you may meet new friends.  Or get a wii fit, lose the baggage|`|oXy5DDZcaa	They aren't your friends.  You're a source of entertainment for them.  When you stop being entertaining to them, trust me, you won't be eating lunch with them very often.<br>  <br>  Your written English speaks volumes about you: you refuse to capitalize the beginning of a sentence, yet always use a period at the end.  You don't capitalize "I" consistently and you use "cuz" often.  It reveals insecurity, which doubtless leaks out to your "friends" at makes them want to torment you all the more.<br>  <br>  As Marlene Dietrich said:  "The only friends that matter are the ones you can call at 4AM."  You don't friends, but a lot of "ladies who lunch," a particularly vile and poisonous breed of Human Being.<br>  <br>  Get new friends with whom you have things in common.  Trust me: the people you're running with are going to desert you one day and it's going to hurt.|`|H41u0B8Jaa	You can look at this another way...if you have known them all since high school and you all still meet up for lunch then I would assume they know you well enough to tease you about what you do and it isn't necessarily mean spirited.  Listen to the conversation...could be they are teasing the lawyer about being an "ambulance chaser", etc.  You may be overly sensitive about this and not picking up on the fact they all tease each other about their occupations.  If that is not the case and you are being singled out then next time they make a comment about you cleaning houses just ask why they seem so bothered by it.  Could be they have no idea you are taking offense to their comments (if the comments are meant in jest).  I wouldn't drop a group of long time friends without talking to them first to get their side of this.  If they truly are being mean spirited and acting like they are better than you just tell them flat out you are offended by their comments and no longer wish to be made to feel inferior to them and cut contact with them.|`|KTNqah9eaa	I am left wondering why you continue to hang around a nasty bunch like this.

I continue teaching, which I have done for 44 years, attend college classes that will help me in my teaching, read the local newspaper every morning to keep abreast of national and local news, read as many books as I can, fiction and non-fiction, that may help me stay "in tune" with the world and the young people I teach. <br>  <br>  Some of my students call me "grandma", which I don't particularly like; but, I try to put that term in perspective. The children I am teaching will be grandparents some day, and one of my responsibilities is to teach them how to be "good" parents and grandparents. <br>  <br>  For those Senior Citizens who will be retiring within the next few months, I encourage them to stay active in their community. Volunteer at a local school as a mentor, a tutor. Check with your local library. Perhaps you can volunteer to read to young children in a Story Hour. Check with your city or county about assisting at polling places for Federal, state, or county elections. <br>  <br>  If you are a member of a church, get involved now that you have more time. Join the choir, help with funeral services (many churches provide lunch for the families of church members who have passed). <br>  <br>  Take a pottery class, martial arts class, dance class, exercise class. Stay active. <br>  <br>  Visit local museums, zoos. If you have the resources, visit places you have always wanted to visit. <br>  <br>  My mother is 87.

zZxX5PXBaa	So it should bother you, because the idea is thoroughly unbiblical.<br>  <br>  Take a look at Romans 16, for instance, where Paul lists a whole load of co-workers ... there are plenty of female names in there, and several different roles. The names include Junias (it's a female name) who is identified as an apostle.<br>  <br>  Even John Chrysostom, one of the most important of the early church theologians, who lived in the 4th century, acknowledged that this passage is important, and that Junias is clearly a female apostle, so denying it is a relatively modern heresy.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, those who shout the loudest about following biblical commands are usually those who spend least time and effort actually studying the biblical text, so you'll encounter many people who say that women can't be preachers, etc. Try not to be unkind to them, and treat them as the weak and ignorant brethren, and walk away when they won't listen.|`|LjsRfaskaa	This is why it is a load of hogwash.

This gift of authority does not give a husband any greater dignity than his wife.  Both are equal members of the marital covenant, as is reflected by God creating woman from the side of man (as opposed to his head or feet).  Instead, this order of authority reflects the divine order between God, Christ and man.  God blessed the marital covenant with this order to maintain peace and harmony in the family, the “domestic church.” Just as Christ is the Head of the Catholic Church (the family of God), so the father is the head of his domestic church (his family).<br>  <br>  1 Cor. 11:3 – “But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.”<br>  <br>  Eph. 5:22-24 – “Wives, be subject to your husbands, as to the Lord.  For the husband is the head of his wife, as Christ is the head of the church, His Body, and is himself its savior. As the church is subject to Christ, so let wives also be subject in everything to their husbands.”<br>  <br>  Col. 1:18 – “Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.”<br>  <br>  Titus 2:5 – Wives should be submissive to their husbands, that the word of God may not be discredited.<br>  <br>  1 Peter 3:1-2 – “Likewise you wives, be submissive to your husbands, so that some, though they do not obey the word, may be won without a word by the behavior of their wives, when they see your reverent and chaste behavior.”<br>  <br>  1 Peter 3:5-6 – “So once the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves and were submissive to their husbands, as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are now her children if you do right and let nothing terrify you.”<br>  <br>  Gen. 2:18; 1 Cor. 11:9; 1 Tim. 2:12-13 – while some people argue that God imposed the submission requirement upon women as a punishment for the original sin, this is not true. God designated the man as the head of his family from the very beginning of creation, even before the original sin.  Therefore, man’s authority over the woman was not imposed as a punishment for the original sin, but to reflect the order of creation.<br>  <br>  Gen. 3:16 – in fact, God revealed that women would want to usurp their husband’s authority as the result of the original sin. After the original sin, God tells Eve: “Yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you.”  Thus, as a result of the original sin, Eve would desire to rule over Adam, but God ensured that Adam would rule over Eve. <br>  <br>  Gen. 4:17 – also shows that the Hebrew word for “desire” refers not to a hunger for affection, but a desire to rule over someone.  Here, God tells Cain “sin is couching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it.”  Sin wants to rule over Cain, but Cain must rule over sin.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 3:12 – the prophet laments about how women were usurping the authority of men, during the height of Israel’s covenant apostasy. <br>  <br>  Just as wives must be submissive to their husbands as the head of the family, husbands must love their wives sacrificially, as Christ loves the Church:<br>  <br>  Eph. 5:25,28 – just as wives must submit to their husbands, husbands must “love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her…husbands should love their wives as their own bodies.” Just as the Church is legally and morally obligated to submit to Christ, wives are obligated to submit to their husbands. This is why Paul makes the comparison between husbands and Christ, wives and the Church.<br>  <br>  Eph. 5:33 – “let each one of you love his wife as himself.”<br>  <br>  Col.. 3:19 – “husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them.”<br>  <br>  1 Peter 3:7 – “Likewise you husbands, live considerately with your wives, bestowing honor on the woman as the weaker sex, since you are joint heirs of the grace of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered.”|`|AA11521494	I see no answers here that satisfactorily get round the plain truth of the bible - women may not speak in churches.  The bible is the product of its time, when women were second-class citizens.  That may be an argument for saying that the bible is now wrong, but god doesn't seem to have told anyone any different yet, and if you are going to believe in the bible as absolute truth, you just have to accept that god is sexist.|`|ch9ipCTKaa	At the risk of sounding sarcastic, does it bother you that men can't have babies or do you simply accept that God ordains some things for some people and other things for other people.<br>  <br>  This is not sexism, it is just that God appoints certain roles to certain people according to His higher purposes, and remember that not all men are called to these positions either.<br>  <br>  Simply it is a matter of faith and love, do you have enough faith to lean not on your understanding and abide in the Word of God and do you have enough love for the Lord to obey Him over your own wishes and the modern cultural thinking of the society we live in.|`|971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	I think you should look into other religions and find one that works better for you.

I do believe that men are supposed to be the head whilst the women keeps him that way. But as with the crucifixion of Jesus, God will use a woman to do what a man will not. Since a woman's first cycle she has learned how to be strong throughout all types of tests. A woman who has given birth has experienced more pain than man ever will.

Usually using a church kitchen, the "car-hops" take orders from people in cars, and deliver simple food (burgers, dogs, fries, sodas, chips, and shakes) to be eaten in the car.

Sell tickets for $2 each and have prize packages.<br>  Grand prize had a night at a nice restaurant and movie tickets, and a hotel stay.  We usually had enough prizes donated to have 20 or more packages then a bunch of other prizes.  The hardest part was handing out the prizes when we were done.<br>  <br>  Good Luck
HqG4MDxGaa	There's many similarities in world religions, yes. But that to me, just further proves the universal truth of God. <br>  <br>  One thing I've never understood though is how the Jews don't see Jesus as the Messiah. They say he didn't fill the Messianic prophecy, according to their scriptures. However, aren't they the ones descended from the Jews that were loyal to the ruling of Rome at the time of Jesus?<br>  <br>  Cause there were 2 sets of Jewish people. Those who believed that Jesus was the Messiah (who turned into "Christians") and those who didn't (who were loyal to Rome -- though not to Rome's "god" - Caesar). <br>  However, of the ones who didn't believe that Jesus was the messiah, how exactly do they come up with that? Where is their proof that he wasn't the Messiah, according to their scriptures or whatever? <br>  <br>  [I'm not trying to offend anyone of Jewish descent here -- I just want to know the basis of how Jesus doesn't fullfill the Messianic prophecies, according to you guys, is all]. <br>  <br>  As for how atheists fill about certain things, they don't believe in anything so I guess it wouldn't matter of them if there were bits and pieces of 1 religion that tied into another.|`|9Ur1VL9Paa	I find it very suspicious; in the sense that it is even more possible that religious books are entirely made up and at least this way we have the source of where these ideas come from.<br>  <br>  If anything it proves how unoriginal the religion is<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: "in my opinion no one stole anything"?<br>  Yes, they did; and that's a fact dear; not an opinion.

It would also reduce stress if someone sincerely believed that Zeus was going to reward them in the afterlife, but that doesn't mean he will. It's the fact that they believe it that reduces anxiety, not the actual reality of what they believe.

But it begs the question;  are religious people less anxious because they're religious, or are less anxious, less self critical type thinkers the ones who become religious people?<br>  <br>  (Sample of 1)  I always felt a lot stress and anxiety when I made an error.  I was church-going, a believer into my thirties, but never religious in the sense of many fellow church goers who were "typically religious".  Long periods of questioning, then became an atheist.  So the article rings true to my experience.  Certainly seems plausible in that sense in it's internal findings.<br>  <br>  The idea that "more certain, less anxious, less self-stressing types" tended toward religious thinking fits very well with the idea that religiosity was evolutionarily selected for at a time in our past when humans were subject to great stress and anxiety.  Think of someone who is conscious, aware of his own consciousness and that of his fellow humans.  He is constantly aware that every decision he makes carries risks from predators, thirst, hunger, fellow humans, etc.  And other risks seem incalculable - storms, illness - yet the urge to try to make correct decisions of avoidance is inevitable.  In this setting, a mind that reacts with less stress to mistakes (correctable mistakes, of course!) and also tends to religiosity (relief of the unending sense of responsibility) would do better over the years, and be more reproductively successful.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	I have seen plenty of studies that say that religious people are not as likely to suffer from stress as non-religious people. This is nothing new to me. This article also pointed out that those who were religious made less errors than those who were not. Yet, those who were non-religious were more prone to recognize their errors when they made them. So, it seems that neither viewpoint is "perfect" or has a leg up on the other. Understand that "religious" comprises several groups from Hindu to Jewish to Gnostic and Buddhist. Maybe the answer isn't "ignorance is bliss" maybe the answer is "spiritual awareness is bliss."<br>  <br>  More or less activity in one specific area of the brain is not necessarily an indicator of overall intelligence.|`|XoUfUl6Yaa	Science confirming what we've known for centuries.|`|AA10846623	There is likely some truth to this, because I have found over the years that believers just think that all will be OK and they seem not much worried at all.  This because they think their god is going to fix all that is wrong.  But since that god has never fixed anything, it does then seem somewhat insane to accept that god.  So why would believers be more relaxed?  Then it would be that they are used to being led around like sheep and then they follow their priest or preacher.  But nonbelievers live in reality and we do things ourselves and do not believe in hocus-pocus magic, spirits and devils, etc.

08QtgdpOaa	Aww, that's really cute. :) Of course gay guys pursue other gay guys; what romantic relationship could I ever have with a straight man?(Rhetorical, please don't answer..) But maybe he doesn't know you're not gay. My advice would be to not confront him until he tries to ask you out or something like that because he might just be friendly or wants to be your friend. Try casually slipping in an ex girlfriend or something else to indicate you're straight in conversation.|`|CvDzpQREaa	I don't do that kind of stuff. If you feel uncomfortable with it, let him now.

If he still gives the presents then that is fair enough . There is no need to be rude just be honest . he may think that you might be gay , after all most of us gay guys do not go around with a sign on . Sure I have flirted with other guys at work , in fact I met my first serious botfriend like this and neither of us knew each other was gay at first . So just tell this guy that you are uncomfortable about his advances , he should back off then and if he doesn't then that is when you might get blunt , or rude

Save yourselves and your family from a Fire whose fuel is Men and Stones........." (Qur'an 66:6).<br>  <br>  He also appreciates the responsibility that the Prophet (peace be upon him) has placed upon him:<br>  <br>  "Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock.  The leader is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock; a man is the shepherd of his family and responsible for his flock; a woman is the shephered in the house of her husband and is responsible for her flock; the servant is the shepherd of master's welth and is responsible for it.  Each of you is a shephered and is responsible for his flock." (Bukhari and Muslim).<br>  <br>  The parents are responsible for providing their children with a sound Islamic education and upbringing their children with a soud Islamic education and upbringing, based on the noble characteristics which the Prophet (pbuh) mentioned that he had been sent to complete and spread among people: "I have only been sent to make righteous behavious complete."<br>  <br>  There is no greater plroof of the gravity of parents' responsibility to bring their children up to obey Allah and His Messenger, than the verdict of the 'ulama' that every family should heed the words of the Prophet (pbuh):<br>  <br>  "Instruct your children to pray when they are seven years of age, and hit them if they do not pray when they are ten" (Ahmad, Abu Dawood and Al-Hakim).<br>  The home is the first environment in which these little ones grow: it is the milieu in which their inclinations, attitudes and personalities are formed.  This explains the importance of the parents' role in nurturing their young ones and paying equal attention to the physical, mental and spiritual well-being.|`|lljK4HfHaa	Married? No<br>  Children?

When there is something to investigate that almost every time behaves exactly the same way, then I use science.  When there is something that usually behaves one way but sometimes another, or is even random, then I have to dust off my engineering studies and analyze things with probabilistic or stochastic methods.

These evidences should have convince the Jews God was in control yet they faltered and were punished for faithlessness.<br>  <br>  For me, I thought the whole thing was faked or based on superstition until I studied the Bible deeper and discovered God has implanted in the Word glimpses of the future--for the wise.<br>  <br>  For example, the wounded side of Adam points 4,000 years later when Jesus would receive His church through His wounded side.  Then Abraham offered his son at MtMoriah. That wilderness hill was later populated and known as Jerusalem--God offered His son there.<br>  <br>  So, as one searches for deeper truths, God reveals it to those "hungering and thirsting after righteousness."<br>  <br>  An extra bit of evidence was hidden "until the end of the days."  It proves Jesus is the Messiah, Identifies the Abomination of Desolation, and defines the boundaries of the cosmic conflict: <a href="http://abiblecode.com." rel="nofollow">http://abiblecode.com.</a><br>  <br>  Blessings, Ben Yeshua|`|0WB5Tru5aa	A simplified version of my method is taking evidence and proceeding from there to make conclusions (1), not taking conclusions and prooceeding to procure evidence for them (2).

In many cases, though, it's necessary to have something like faith - I prefer 'trust' - that a researcher is using the Scientific Method to derive their data. <br>  <br>  Their personal authority on a subject is also important: if Penrose says artificial intelligence is impossible I'll take his ideas on board, but note that he's a mathematician. If Dawkins proposes a mechanism of evolution I'll be happier to accept it because he's a noted specialist in the field. If someone with a doctorate in Divinity says anything about science at all, I'll be sceptical.<br>  <br>  And in the long run, new ideas are tested until they either break or stand up. Short term errors are possible, but not important.|`|93galWG1aa	I firmly believe the heart is more than an organ that pumps blood, I believe it is able to feel on a different level other than material or senses.<br>  Scripture is full of verses that speak of this and a recent study i read says that the heart communicates in four different ways, One I'm looking into now is that the heart sends out signals that we pick up.( this probably explains why we take to some people and not others even before they speak.<br>  Jesus said pray with your heart! you will be judged on what comes from the heart! etc, I can't say for sure but with reason and logic we can find God, but with the Heart we know God.<br>  As an atheist would say logic can't find or explain God, and that is true for some others it is not the case so It must be we need something more tangible to hold too, if we are going to pursue truth, that for me is the heart where I feel God and long for him, is it Love?<br>  Does Love lead us to God ?<br>  So I say truth is multi dimensional and we need more than senses and thinking to reach the truth we need the tools that are given to find truth.<br>  And they are prayer contemplation meditation and self abandonment .<br>  Great question by the way.

They generally don't have such good self-esteem, because the ONLY thing they base themselves on is their parents' money.  Not their own accomplishments - on money.<br>  <br>  You can't be secure knowing that the only thing that makes you "somebody" is money.<br>  <br>  And don't think they don't envy other people - their bf/gf could be mean, or not very attentive, or pushy, and they may envy the quiet girl down the hall with the boyfriend who dotes on her.  Just because their parents are rich doesn't mean their parents are there for them - rich parents generally work long hours, and the kids are left with nannies or sitters.  It doesn't do much for your self-esteem when your parents never seem to make time for you.<br>  <br>  Don't ever let a snob get to you - just know they are living in their own private hells, just like the rest of us.

So this world is for those who did not want to stay in the all spiritual realm.  We have a real spiritual body that is eternal.  As long as our consciousness is contaminated by material desires we stay in material realm.  We re-incarnate.  Not necessarily to another human body (if the consciousness is that of an animal perhaps an animal body and so on).

It starts:<br>  <br>  When on high the heaven had not been named,<br>  Firm ground below had not been called by name,<br>  When primordial Apsu, their begetter,<br>  And Mummu-Tiamat, she who bore them all,<br>  Their waters mingled as a single body,<br>  No reed hut had sprung forth, no marshland had appeared,<br>  None of the gods had been brought into being,<br>  And none bore a name, and no destinies determined--<br>  Then it was that the gods were formed in the midst of heaven.<br>  <br>  It talks about before heaven or earth had names, when the waters of heaven and earth were intermingled. We can almost go from this straight into Genesis 1:6, And God said, Let there be a firmament (heaven) in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.|`|WX1b747Iaa	There is the flood story right there, and the character isn't Noah.|`|rFFYCmOGaa	Without a doubt absolutely.

It is time people begin to understand that the Bible, as well as most other religious books are allegorical. You will find archetypical equalent episodes in all religions - because the kernel of all religion is the same. Take Abraham for instance. Abraham had a child with his wife, but he also had a "fling" on the side with another woman, the "free woman". This is actually a re-telling of the Hindu story of Brahman. Abraham was married to Sarah (later Sarai) and Brahman is married to sarah-svati. From this marriage came Purusha, the universal man - the sacrifice. And saint paul makes it perfectly clear that jesus came from the lineage of Abraham and the free woman. In hindu she is called Gayantri. A quick comparison between Christ and Purusha will make it perfectly clear that Christianity is the greek implementation, on an archetypical level, of Purusha. And the same goes for the old testament.<br>  <br>  The bible authors have simply renamed the plural gods of the EL pantheon - into men and wimmen. The patriarcs of the jewish people to this day -- never existed. They are principles in nature, personified and turned into myth.<br>  <br>  The jews did not live isolated on their own. They were influenced by countless nations, their doctrines and like everyone else -- they incorporated this into their faith.<br>  <br>  "just as Genesis 1-11 as a whole corresponds to the structure of the Atrahasis myth, so the garden of Eden story has incorporated many of the themes of the great Gilgamesh poem".

Given that  Abraham came from Ur of the Chaldees!! <br>  <br>  About 6200-6500 years ago there existed a civilization located between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers near the Persian Gulf. The area was known as Mesopotamia and the city was called Ur. Because of the geographic location the city had fertile soil and was the perfect place to irrigate the land and raise productive crops, as well as domesticate sheep, goats and other animals.<br>  <br>  Ur is known in the Bible as Ur of the Chaldees. This biblical name, Ur of the Chaldees, refers to the Chaldeans, who settled the area about 900 B.C. It is known as the ancient city of the Sumerian civilization and the home of Abraham, father of the Hebrews. Its ruins are between the modern city of Baghdad, Iraq, and the head of the Persian Gulf. The site is now known as Tall al Muqayyar, Iraq. The site of ancient Ur is located 140 miles south of Babylon. It was the capital of a small wealthy empire during the third millennium B.C. Most of the great ziggurat of Ur is still standing.<br>  <br>  The Epic of Gilgamesh is, perhaps, the oldest written story on Earth. It comes to us from Ancient Sumeria, and was originally written on 12 clay tablets in cunieform script. It is about the adventures of the historical King of Uruk (somewhere between 2750 and 2500 BCE).<br>  <br>  Gilgamesh was an historical king of Uruk in Babylonia, on the River Euphrates in modern Iraq; he lived about 2700 B.C. Although historians (and your textbook) tend to emphasize Hammurabi and his code of law, the civilizations of the Tigris-Euphrates area, among the first civilizations, focus rather on Gilgamesh and the legends accruing around him to explain, as it were, themselves. Many stories and myths were written about Gilgamesh, some of which were written down about 2000 B.C. in the Sumerian language on clay tablets which still survive; the Sumerian language, as far as we know, bears no relation to any other human language we know about. These Sumerian Gilgamesh stories were integrated into a longer poem, versions of which survive not only in Akkadian (the Semitic language, related to Hebrew, spoken by the Babylonians) but also on tablets written in Hurrian and Hittite (an Indo-European language, a family of languages which includes Greek and English, spoken in Asia Minor). All the above languages were written in the script known as cuneiform, which means "wedge-shaped." The fullest surviving version, is derived from twelve stone tablets, in the Akkadian language, found in the ruins of the library of Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria 669-633 B.C., at Nineveh. The library was destroyed by the Persians in 612 B.C., and all the tablets are damaged. The tablets actually name an author, which is extremely rare in the ancient world, for this particular version of the story: Shin-eqi-unninni. You are being introduced here to the oldest known human author we can name by name! <br>  <br>  So all these tales, stories, histories and myths arose in the same part of the world, with the similar cultural backgrounds -- is it any wonder there are common themes?

5OucqEzFaa	In order to understand why Jehovah's Witnesses say  the resurrected dead will not be judged on what they did prior to dying, you need to understand what they believe about the resurrection. I will try to explain this from their point of view whilst stating that I do not subscribe to their beliefs. This is how it goes:<br>  <br>  Only faithful, obedient Jehovah's Witness who have an earthly calling will survive Armageddon. The remnant of the 144,000 anointed Jehovah's Witnesses will have gone to heaven, there to reign as kings and priests with Christ Jesus over the survivors of Armageddon and all the dead who will be resurrected to life on EARTH. All the dead will be resurrected and will have 1,000 years to prove they deserve everlasting life on a paradise earth. They will be judged on what they do during the millennial reign of Christ Jesus and, at the end, when Satan and his demons are let loose for a short period of time, those who have refused to be obedient to the 144,000 will be annihilated.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses believe that because the penalty of sin is death, our physical deaths atone for our sins. Jesus, they say, died only to atone for the sin of Adam.<br>  <br>  To make things even more complicated and convoluted, Jehovah's Witnesses have been told that everything in the New Testament about anointed Christians who have a heavenly hope applies ONLY to 144,000 persons since the time of Jesus. So Paul's words in Romans do not apply to those Jehovah's Witnesses with an earthly hope because they are not anointed. However, by hanging onto the spiritual coat-tails of their anointed brothers and sisters, they hope that Jesus will mediate on their behalf and that they will be able to benefit from the New Covenant (which only applies to the 144,000).<br>  <br>  I am in agreement with your first point, namely that in Romans chapter 6 Paul is talking metaphorically - he is talking about dying to our previous, sinful lives and being freed from our bondage to sin through the shed blood of Christ Jesus, our Lord and Saviour.  I also agree with the evidence in Romans chapter 14 that we shall all, each and every one of us, be judged on what we thought, said and did while alive.<br>  <br>  The specific Jehovah's Witness teaching you quote from their literature is an unequivocal contradiction of what the Bible says in Romans chapters 6 and 14.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Iam not a JW. The Holy Bible contains the truth.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

Jesus also told us that even every word we say shall be judged on judgment day.<br>  <br>  There is unfortunately no church not wrong about some serious dogma.<br>  It is also unfortunate that the Wt does not permit its members to make up their own minds on such Biblical matters because dis-permitting it makes their dogma teachings of men that disqualifies our worship in the eyes of God.<br>  <br>  They simply do not understand what judgment is and how it occurs.<br>  ---------<br>  Edit:<br>  Your point about chapter 14 is self-explanatory.  Each person will be, shall be, judged according to their deeds they did during their lives.  What 14 says accords with Romans 2:14-16. (Your quote: "So then each one of us will give an account of himself to God ") means that what we did shall affect our judgment for the better or worse.<br>  <br>  What the Wt and its members choose to ignore is that the real judgment already has been poured out on all that died.  This is why Ezekiel says that the sinner shall die, and he did.  That is God's undeniable judgment and it happened.<br>  <br>  What Jesus then judges is not if the person should die -- he already did die.  No, Jesus judges if there is room for leniency !!!!!!<br>  <br>  This is why Rom 6:7 has no effect on this.  The person is dead and judgment was rendered by God.  Christ judges only as a parole officer would -- namely, is there room for mercy!  And, that is why their (the dead ones) actions still count.<br>  <br>  Why?  Because Romans 6:23 says that "the free gift of God is eternal life."  Thus judgment judges not if they should die -- they already did.  Judgment judges if they are worthy of the free gift.  This is why their former actions are taken into consideration, and why Revelation says that the dead are judged according to the things in the books -- because are they worthy of the gift?!!<br>  <br>  Remember !!! They already proved worthy of death!!!  That is why they died in the first place.|`|2BBKHggeaa	I have read what you wrote. This is what I understand.<br>  <br>  We need to be aware that every time we sin, we are sinning against Jehovah whether it be NOW or when the new scrolls are opened.  Eze 18:4 says "the soul that is sinning, it itself will die"  We are destined for death because of sin, and nothing we do will change that. We needed a SAVIOR.<br>  <br>   Knowing this should help us to comply with his lofty standards what ever they may be. The Bible reminds us: “There is not a creation that is not manifest to his sight, but all things are naked and openly exposed to the eyes of him with whom we have an accounting.” (Hebrews 4:13)<br>  <br>   So, we must render an account to Jehovah,out of our deep love for him... that is the principal reason why we do his will and abide by his righteous standards.<br>  <br>  In the 1000 year judgement period, the dead will be resurrected and judged on how obedient they are to the new scrolls. Their past deeds are  not in question because the "wages that sin pays is DEATH" (Rom 6:23) it is their obedience for what is required of them when they are alive that is judged.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  Let me add something.<br>  <br>  If everyone who died from the beginning of creation til now were to be judged by what they did  BEFORE they died, there would be no need for a resurrection, no need for the 1000 year judgement day...no need for kings and priests in heaven Ruling/judgeing with Christ  over the earth( no one will be there) because  like in the FLOOD and SODOM, and  what will happen at ARMAGEDDON, these direct judgement times are final,  these one who die by Gods hands will be gone forever.  Death is the end.  <br>  <br>  However, since Jehovah has great love for mankind, his son was offered as a Savior... to save us from sin and death. (ransomer for what Adam lost; perfection and everlasting life)<br>  <br>  If we have not died in a judgement period like at ARMAGEDDON, or have WILLINGLY REJECTED Him before we died...... we can be confident that IF we die, Christs ransom has paid the price  so that judgment will be reserved for the dead on judgement day. God will bring the righteous( those who loved him) and the unrighteous( those who did not know him) back to give them a  fair chance in serving him with an obedient heart. <br>  <br>  At the end of the 1000 year reign all on the earth will be perfect when Satan is let loose and able to mislead again.  This is the final test of integrity.  There is no excuse of imperfection, we will all be like Adam and Jesus( when on earth) able to make a stand for Gods universal Sovereignty.  <br>  <br>  All who disobey will be immediately distroyed and all who are faithful will live forever on the earth.  <br>  <br>  The issueof who has the right to rule( man or God) will never be raised again, in heaven or on earth.  <br>  <br>    This is a very loving arrangement by our heavenly father.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	The bible...not JWs....the bible....and the same chapter tell us that in verse 23.<br>  <br>  Romans 6:23<br>  <br>  For the wages sin pays is death, but the gift God gives is everlasting life by Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>  <br>  <br>  What happen if you die??<br>  <br>   the wages sin pays is death...if you are death....your wages are payed...<br>  <br>  or Not??<br>  <br>  METAPHORICAL death???? Where in the bible mention that term.......METAPHORICAL death??<br>  <br>  Do you know When is the  "day" of judgment??<br>  <br>  A specific “day,” or period, when particular groups, nations, or mankind in general are called to account by God. It may be a time when those already judged to be deserving of death are executed, or the judgment may afford opportunity for some to be delivered, even to everlasting life. Jesus Christ and his apostles pointed to a future “Judgment Day” involving not only the living but also those who had died in the past.—Mt 10:15; 11:21-24; 12:41,?42; 2Ti 4:1,?2.<br>  <br>  Time for Judgment Day. In John 12:48 Christ linked the judging of persons with “the last day.” Revelation 11:17,?18 locates a judging of the dead as occurring after God takes his great power and begins ruling in a special way as king. Additional light on the matter comes from the sequence of events recorded in Revelation chapters 19 and 20. There one reads of a war in which the “King of kings” kills “the kings of the earth and their armies.” (Earlier in Revelation [16:14] this is called “the war of the great day of God the Almighty.”) Next Satan is bound for a thousand years. During that thousand years royal judges serve with Christ. In the same context, resurrection and the judging of the dead are mentioned. This, then, is an indication of the time when Judgment Day comes. And it is not impossible from a Scriptural standpoint for a thousand-year period to be viewed as a “day,” for such an equation is stated in the Bible.—2Pe 3:8; Ps 90:4.<br>  <br>  Basis for judgment. In describing what will take place on earth during the time of judgment, Revelation 20:12 says that the resurrected dead will then be “judged out of those things written in the scrolls according to their deeds.” Those resurrected will not be judged on the basis of the works done in their former life, because the rule at Romans 6:7 says: “He who has died has been acquitted from his sin.”<br>  <br>  However, Jesus said that unwillingness to take note of his powerful works and repent or unresponsiveness to God’s message would make it hard for some to endure Judgment Day.—Mt 10:14,?15; 11:21-24.|`|49VzNZM1aa	NO.  You seem to forget that you are putting your own interpretation as to what the word said. So 'He who has died has been acquitted from his sin.' (Romans 6:7) uh yea. Cus your not sinning anymore your on the day of your judgment. And secondly he is referring as to give an account after you are reborn (metaphorically).

rv2Iy1Y7aa	Translating these lyrics would not be excessively difficult; however, doing so while maintaining the poetic elements would be much more difficult.  If you would simply like a translation, this is one thing; if you want to maintain the meter and other poetic factors, this is something else entirely and it adds to the difficulty quite a bit.  I suspect a simple translation that captures the meaning (but not the meter, etc.) would be unsatisfactory to you.  <br>  <br>  If you don't mind a simple translation (and possibly not a very satisfying translation), submit again and one of us may be willing to do this for you.

There are a lot of corrupt people out there on the street, in restaurants, in workplaces, many managers are corrupt themselves. Actually, I have found many homosexuals to be smart, intelligent and working in a  professional field. Not all homosexuals are out in public, hence the term I hate alot, "coming out of the closet". Why they call it that i don't know.  many homosexuals, bisexuals keep their private life private at the workplace and in public, and even from family.  No, family doesn't have to know everything either.  Some would prefer that their relatives not know anything. And it probably best your workplace don't know either.<br>  What is wrongful are those corrupt people that really want to stick their nose into the gay's personal life so they can drag it out in public and tell the person's relatives and ruin that person for the rest of his/her life. I would call that "character assassination". That may be strong, but it is along those lines.<br>    Yes there are people that want to destroy another person's life, joy with their relatives, joy with their friends,steal their finances, and destroy them out of spite.<br>  It is those spiteful, dysfuntional people that are ignorant. It almost sounds like they are jealous of the gay persons lifestyle.<br>    Just leave the gay people alone. let them have their joy, their life, their work, their own money, their own insurance.<br>    i've seen gay people be more well-behaved than straight people.<br>    Now I'm going to say something that will make some people mad.<br>  If I was out shopping in a grocery store, I would feel much safer standing next to a gay couple than I would standing near a black hood person.  There is even married people you can't trust either.|`|52VDjbNTaa	It used to bother me, but now it's bothering less and less.<br>  It still gets me when it's a close friend saying it, but when it's someone I don't know, I really couldn't care less.<br>  I often stick up for myself, but sometimes I just can't be bothered.<br>  Their loss.|`|swkhohjgaa	Yeah i just don't get the greedy stuff?

My friend is a lesbian, and her brother is gay. fairly common.|`|6w1e6zUVaa	Dshiznit is an idiot.  Being homosexual has nothing to do with genetics.  But has to do with development conditions while in the womb.  Which is why twins, or two of three triplets can be of same sexual orientation.  Because the development conditions are obviously the same, in the womb, for all fetuses developing at the same time. But to answer your question, no it's not uncommon.|`|FJPKtZN5aa	actually its fairly common|`|eKeWnkguaa	its quite common. abit weird though if you are both twins but nothing is wrong with being gay|`|RB0ICpJCaa	Pretty common.

6Ao8Bskfaa	Err, man created God/s. These simpletons had no other way of knowing the origins of the universe. In modern society, we know these origins so the very idea that a deity "created all the heavens and the Earth" is nothing short of an absurd notion. Since the 1600's when Galileo was subjugated by the church, there really has been no use for churches as his works disproved the God created everything notion.<br>  If the church had not intervined and held Gelileo under house arrest, and try and debunk his findings, the church would be broke. Not only that, we as a race would be far further advanced. So, instead of these ideas being embraced they were surpressed for 100's of years.<br>  <br>  EDIT: and yes, these religious 'nut jobs' are indeed delusional|`|AA10858522	god was created in the minds of people and elevated in status in order to find an additional way to manipulate the population into obedience and subservience. Every little village had gods. The difference is the village that had the most power spread its religion. i can make up a god right now and start a new religion. Will that make me a god since I created god?|`|WLLqdPXeaa	In fact Nature is God.|`|jc7L2TtPaa	Who said God needed to be created?  the same type of thinking goes into a question like, "Do you think God is really a woman?" Why would a spiritual diety need a sex organ? Your argument is what is called a "begging the question" fallacy. You say because this is what "They Believe In" for one instance, then the same instance applies here. No, the creation theory was based on the Adam and Eve story. How does that mean that because Christians believe in the creation theory for man that they believe God couldn't have existed without a creator? You are making up your own facts. Deists believe in God (not a personal god, a "nature's god") without the need for religion. That is the basis for Freemasons.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	I personally believe that God always existed as energy in the universe, and one day this energy became aware of itself, and became conscious.  Energy needs a direction, if it doesn't go anywhere it must dissipate.  Kind of like in Bicentennial Man.  The robot existed, the same as the other robots, but something fundamental changed in the robot's programming, it became self aware instead of simply existing, and with self awareness and consciousness came a desire to create, and come to know itself through it's creation.<br>  "Time", and concepts of before and after, beginning and end are man made creations.  We use these concepts to cope with our own movement through the Creation.  All is Now, and we are a mere blip in the Now.|`|bB7j9Mpgaa	God was always there, never had a beginning date..<br>  <br>  Just like there is no end to the universe. If you say "some day we will find the end of the universe" Then you must ask what is at the end and then what is on the other side, but if there is another side then it is not the end, hence no ending to it ever. Both God having no beginning and the universe having no ending are hard for the simple mind of a man to understand but both are still fact..|`|TeailU2iaa	It is a hard question, yet a great question.<br>  <br>  I believe in a great ENERGY (some say god).<br>  I believe that this power has created everything (via the big bang and Evolution). I believe the universe was created purposely, I cannot believe that everything was an accident. When scientists watched the universe closely every motion from micro to macro was happening according to some predefined, controlled mechanism. My human brain finds it hard to believe that the existence of the universe in a controlled and structured way is possible without the close monitoring of a great power. Therefore I concluded to myself that this great power, energy or nature must be the cause of the creation of the universe. This cannot be simply a result of an accident. <br>  <br>  Now I have your doubt, if the great power or nature or god whatever it may be, created the universe, then who created it? To be honest I don't know the answer. I strongly believe I will never know the answer for that question as long as I am willing to live abide by the laws of the universe and chained by my human desires, but I believe if mans frees himself from the earthly wants of his, the will to achieve earthly goals, he will never find the answer.<br>  <br>  Because a frog lives in a well and who will never like to leave the well will never know what's outside of it. We are like those frogs, living on earth in the universe, we don't have the will to let ourselves free from our desires. The more the desire we have on earthly things the harder it is to understand or focus the unknown.<br>  <br>  It's like if you have fear of falling you can never have the experience of riding a bicycle. The fear is the human desires; the experience of riding the bicycle is like knowing the unknown like who created the universe. To get one you must let go another......simple.....<br>  <br>   As long as desire on an earthly thing we hold, we never can know the truth, who created the god, the answer we can find when we kill our earthly desires<br>  <br>  I don't know whether you would get my explanation. I just wanted to express what I thought..... This is not to emphasize you on religion. I believe you have the right to follow a religion to to be an atheist|`|VoQN7ADvaa	Prior to answering this, I'm going to acknowledge that I'm totally agnostic and this is going to be as unbiased an answer as I can possibly give.<br>  <br>  Assuming the lack of a higher power, you acknowledge that the history of the universe has been forever before and will be forever after. There was never a specific nothingness, was always matter in some form, and at some point it may have combined to make the world we know today. As human beings, this is a very difficult concept to wrap one's brain around. You can accept that there was the forever before and the forever after or you can think about it and realize that infinity is absolutely inconceivable. We learn what we know through personal experience and within the restrictions of mortality, are unable to fully comprehend infinity beyond mere acceptance.<br>  <br>  With that said, the potential for there to have been a deity who was there forever before and will be forever after isn't nearly as implausible a concept. <br>  <br>  There's got to be a seed of truth in one of those, surely, and as to which is true...we have no way of knowing. You just have to believe what you believe and trust it or accept that you don't know and live your life not knowing and accept it.|`|vb5oY7O6aa	this what you have to expand your mind for.. there are some facts in life you have to accept.

Below is me prepared answer.BEGINNINGS ARE IMPOSSIBLE.<br>  You have a brain vastly ahead of any computer, you can think up things that were not programmed into<br>  you.Your recall may not be so efficient but your vast memory is still there. So you can use simple logic.Here is<br>  a test. All elephants are animals. All animals are not elephants.<br>  You can do that, that’s logic, you have it.<br>  In the very beginning ---way back before bangs or creation or evolution what was there?<br>  There are only two possibilities.<br>  1. Something :  that is anything you like, from dust to God.<br>  2. Nothing : that is no dust, no space, no thoughts, no energy --- a blank, not even emptiness.<br>  <br>   1. The Something ----How did it get there? This is before bangs or evolution or creation, honestly by<br>  logic there is no answer to us, for matter or God to be eternal is  unreasonable.<br>  Really think now, how could anything be there before the beginning, it is beyond us, but how could the<br>  beginning start if there wasn’t anything there? Impossible again!!  Even Christians idea about God already being<br>  there is impossible to our minds.  We cannot help asking, where did He come from and if He didn’t come from<br>  somewhere how could He be there? <br>  Blows your mind doesn’t it? But we are here, so existence either started from nothing or it was always there.<br>  Both are impossible to us in this material, temporal world.<br>   2. The Nothing possibility would still be the same, with no substance, no space, no energy  nothing could<br>  start. But we are here, the impossible has happened, existence is real, and that’s a miracle. So there was never a<br>  time when there was Nothing or there would still be nothing.  So Something had to be always there. Maybe<br>  you could call it the best of two impossibilities.  Chance doesn’t come into this. If something is impossible it<br>  can never never never NEVER happen no matter how long you give it, even forever.  So whatever was already<br>  there had to have the potential to provide the source of the systems we see operating now. That is vast (maybe<br>  infinite amounts of energy), designing ability or intelligence (phenomenal design is everywhere from atoms to<br>  highly complex single cells, birds that fly and a moon that stays there balanced on gravity), as well as be the<br>  source of LIFE.  By logic both these are impossibilities. What do you call a powerful intelligent designing life<br>  giver that was already there? Could it be Creator or God?<br>  IMPOSSIBLE; NOT IMPOSSIBLE; IMPOSS.........<br>  What happens when you try to work out the impossible?<br>  You get the wrong answer!    because there is no answer.<br>  What happens when you realise it is wrong?  You get another answer! But it’s wrong too.<br>  Whatever answer you get must be wrong.THAT’S EVOLUTION.<br>  BEGINNINGS are impossible to us.<br>  Honestly if there ever was nothing, really nothing, no space, no gas, no energy, no substance, no thought or<br>  ideas, a complete non existence, there would still be no existence,<br>  YET<br>  for us mortals (dying ones) the thought of anything already being there is just as impossible.<br>  We have to ask the impossible question.<br>  WHERE DID IT COME FROM?<br>  Again there is no answer.<br>  BUT WE ARE HERE.<br>  The IMPOSSIBLE  has happened.<br>  That is what we call a miracle. (not just an unusual happening)<br>  Once you accept one miracle others are not impossible.<br>   All we can do is examine present systems which show that whatever was already there had to be the<br>  source of vast energy, be an intelligent designer and be a life provider. What is a word for that? Could it be<br>  Creator or God. If you are seeking the truth read the Gospel of John, The book of Acts and Genesis. To be saved<br>  you need to believe Jesus died on the cross for your sin and ask Him into your life. Be willing to turn from sin<br>  with His help. Now live for Him by worshipping God, learning of Him in His word and owning Him before<br>  others.

Your flesh may still want to sin in these areas, but these things will not send you to hell because you are washed. What remains now is staying in fellowship with Christ by not falling back into those sins <br>  <br>  He neglects the next verse, verse 12, where Paul states there is hope for everyone. Paul says that some of the Corinthians were those things, but now we are declared “not guilty” After all the sins listed and even those not named, it is a blessing to know that a man, woman, boy, or girl can be declared “NOT GUILTY” by the Holy, Righteous, God of the universe; simply when they trust His only begotten son as their Saviour. <br>  <br>  6:12 Here Paul says that you can do anything that you want (unto the pure all things are pure…Titus 1:15), but the qualifier is… “but all things are not expedient.” Not all things help you out in your walk with Christ, so these should be left alone. Don’t be brought under the power of these things even though it may be lawful for you to do them. You are no longer “under” the law, but you should still obey it. Don’t let these things take control of your life.<br>  <br>  6:13 Don’t put so much emphasis on the do’s and don't's, cause God is going to destroy both the belly and the meats.<br>  <br>  So basicly, it is funny, and pathetic and it has upset me I won't lie. Physical intimacy is a beautiful way two people can express their love for each other, and who are they to judge.<br>  <br>  Denying sex is a superb way of making yourself 'burn with lust' all the time, it makes you angry and miserable and even more obsessed with sex than straight christians are.

Even Scripture says celibacy is not for everyone.  I'd love to see unrepentant homophobes spend a lifetime being celibate.  Then they can suggest that normal gay people spend a life never having the opportunity to love, cherish, nurture and commit to another person.  <br>  <br>  The good news is that Christ never condemned homosexuality or condoned homophobia, so being celibate is not necessary for Christian gay people.|`|W11nQzVPaa	This merely exemplifies their already existing irrational fears. Why should anyone remain celibate when even Catholic Priests cannot do so? The main difference is that a gay man wants a gay man and not little boys like priests do.

AA11608582	The true story of Santa Claus begins with Nicholas, who was born during the third century in the village of Patara. At the time the area was Greek and is now on the southern coast of Turkey. His wealthy parents, who raised him to be a devout Christian, died in an epidemic while Nicholas was still young. Obeying Jesus' words to "sell what you own and give the money to the poor," Nicholas used his whole inheritance to assist the needy, the sick, and the suffering. He dedicated his life to serving God and was made Bishop of Myra while still a young man. Bishop Nicholas became known throughout the land for his generosity to the those in need, his love for children, and his concern for sailors and ships.<br>  <br>  <br>  Under the Roman Emperor Diocletian, who ruthlessly persecuted Christians, Bishop Nicholas suffered for his faith, was exiled and imprisoned. The prisons were so full of bishops, priests, and deacons, there was no room for the real criminals—murderers, thieves and robbers. After his release, Nicholas attended the Council of Nicaea in AD 325. He died December 6, AD 343 in Myra and was buried in his cathedral church, where a unique relic, called manna, formed in his grave. This liquid substance, said to have healing powers, fostered the growth of devotion to Nicholas. The anniversary of his death became a day of celebration, St. Nicholas Day.<br>  <br>  Through the centuries many stories and legends have been told of St. Nicholas' life and deeds. These accounts help us understand his extraordinary character and why he is so beloved and revered as protector and helper of those in need.|`|PaVyuYVUaa	he was a saint that gave gold to a family with three girls. somehow they sociated st. nick with that, it was probably around christmas time. hope this helps|`|JQjs3cB3aa	he was a saint form turkey and he gave things to people to help them out...i dunno how i know this nut its true!|`|RpR3MkH2aa	He was a man that gave gifts in secret to little children at night when no one could know it was him.Later on after he passed away the catholic church made him a saint( that is where Saint Nick come in to place.)|`|AA11293627	when hollywood got smart.<br>  just kidding.<br>  folk tales from england and related countries,<br>  but there used to be a guy who really did give stuff to kids

ZDyY2SCcaa	It is a complete sentence. The word "force" in that sentence meant " to pressure" or "produce".<br>  <br>  You may rewrite the sentence in:<br>  Torture was originally intended to produce false confessions.<br>  <br>  (The person being tortured was "forced to" say false confessions.)<br>  <br>  Good Luck! ^_^|`|ZMxgHl4xaa	It is a complete but poor sentence.

"To force" is here used in the sense of "to cause to occur", "to facilitate".|`|vvJBtxXHaa	....the sentence context is compressed<br>  ...the longer version would include the use of a gerund, for example, the infinitive form  "to make" and it would read something like this: "Torture was originally intended to force parishioners to make false confessions...." <br>  ..the infinitive verb form "to force" enables the compressed sentence form to be grammatically corrrect..and is less wordy and thusly more concise<br>  <br>  ...when linking a verb form with a preposition and the verb becomes the object of the preposition, "it is to force a true gerund" :D|`|q7z7Ni3Daa	It is complete and correct. <br>  <br>  You can force someone to do something, but it not necessary to have an indirect object with this verb, just a direct object.|`|vpRPGauIaa	The verb 'force' can also stand on its own.<br>  <br>  "Torture was originally intended to force false confessions" is a complete and correct sentence.|`|TvVa50poaa	It's complete, although you could also include "out" if you want.|`|9P7uPWJWaa	yes, that is a complete sentence
q7z7Ni3Daa	Man evolved from apes is correct. <br>  Obviously, it based on the use of the verb evolve to mean a biological change (evolution).<br>  <br>  However, that is not the original meaning of the word evolve. It means to change, to become something better usually, but not always. It can mean to use more sophisticated techniques or ideas, which for a killer is not what most would consider "better."<br>  This meaning does not refer to Darwin's theory of evolution.<br>  <br>  This is probably what you heard on the crime show. <br>  Examples: <br>  The serial killer's method of operation evolved over time, making it more difficult to catch him.<br>  <br>  Forensic linguistics has evolved rapidly over the last 20 years.   <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|dEdD8g0Qaa	no, evolution indicates physical mutation to better suit an environment, i would just use 'changed' or 'he has bettered himself' in that context.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I believe it is more correct to say "he has evolved..."|`|GahpE5U2aa	You'd say that he HAS evolved, like someone earlier stated.<br>  <br>  It is not correct English though.

Religion is one way of saying a group of rules exist that a person chooses to abide by.  Only one person can be held accountable unto themselves.

That violates a most basic rule of the mind. What can be known to be false is thereby also knowable as true.

Consequently there are different religious principles.<br>  PURPORT<br>  <br>  Unless one comes to the Absolute Truth, there is no possibility of agreement. Nāsāv r?s?ir yasya matam? na bhinnam: it is said that a great learned scholar or sage cannot be exalted unless he disagrees with other scholars and sages. On the material platform, there is no possibility of agreement; therefore there are different kinds of religious systems. But the Absolute Truth is one, and when one is situated in the Absolute Truth, there is no disagreement. On that absolute platform the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshipable. As stated in the Bhagavad-gītā (18.55), bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān ya? cāsmi tattvatah?. On the absolute platform, the worshipful Deity is one, and the process of worship is also one. That process is bhakti. (devotion)"|`|mOaG5ueZaa	I have actually studied many different religions and I find that Christianity is the only one that makes sense.

Thus, I have studied many, if not most, in depth.  The only "religion" that has a God who reaches down to us, is Christianity.... ALL of the others are works-based.<br>  <br>  C.L. Lewis had great insight into this in "Mere Christianity"<br>  <br>  "I am trying to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: "I am ready to accept Jesus as the great moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God." <br>  <br>  That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on a level with the man who says he is a boiled egg - or else he would be the Devil of Hell. <br>  <br>  You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. <br>  <br>  But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to."|`|jwIdq5qkaa	I am a Christan. In college I took a religions class where we studied the basics of other religions.

Like I said I was already a Christan and didn't need anymore proof than what I believed in my heart. But this helped me to witness to some of my non-Christian friends.

I think it's really important to study other people's religions, and be able to recognize the valid points some of them have. You can't just look at something from one point of view, otherwise you'll have a clouded perception of the world. It's important to recognize that everyone has their own beliefs, and though they might be different from yours, that doesn't always mean you're absolutely 100% right. I'll always be a firm Christian, but that doesn't mean I won't listen to other people's points of view.|`|hCC5GKgJaa	I was raised as a Christian, but at the age of 14 i realized that the choice was never really mine, so i adopted a sort of non-religious view of life until i was ready to decide. I studied only the old, time tried religions, (i.e. Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, etc.) and what i found was that, for me, Christianity made the most sense, because it judges you on WHO YOU are, not how you act or what you do, but truly on what you feel, and who you are when no one is around to impress. However, i love the whole prospect of buddhism, and i strongly recommend that everyone, of any faith, look at others, and always make the choice for yourself. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|3fV6zRlJaa	I have studied different religions and I've asked myself the same question and IDK which is the TRUE religion so I just gave up...tru story.|`|zHZOxfbVaa	its because of stereotypes like all muslims are terrorists or all JW's are annoying (kinda are), also all mormons are nerds, and all that stuff|`|g3Yabux2aa	While I have studied Buddhism and Taoism studying other religions is unnecessary to be sure you are practicing the true religion. Religion is based purely on faith. Since religion is metaphysical, and thus beyond ones ability to know with complete certainty, faith is all you can really go on. To pick a religious belief based on studies would not necessarily be to pick the true religion, merely the one that is the most comfortable or convenient.|`|n9y5ydnVaa	Actually I am a very strong christian and i have looked briefly at what other religions are and what they believe in (for other reasons than just this.) and personally, i believe that Christianity is something you truly believe in and stuff for example, i know that god is with me right now.

Also, especially with Christianity, I believe it necessary to delve into Judaism to really know what the Bible is saying, with regard to tradition, geography, translation, etc.<br>  <br>  However,  I think there is a limit. You can really get the full EXPERIENCE of a religion without fully practicing it, (IMO.) So most of what people believe in is based on faith.

Aristotle did not at that point have any influence from Christianity so I'm not cheating.<br>  <br>  Aristotle would take as an example a square.  Every square on earth is an imitation of a mathematically perfect square that is only found in heaven.  Perfection can only exist in heaven, and any other square on earth is in some way imperfect.  <br>  <br>  Therefore, no earthly square could ever get to heaven, since heaven only has perfect squares.  Due to the flawed nature of an earthly square, however slight, that flaw will be enough to keep it from heaven.<br>  <br>  Now look at the religions.  All religions might have three aspects.  <br>  <br>  1) The first aspect is the definition of the perfect state, and if that perfection is God (if there is one).  <br>  <br>  2) The second aspect is an attempt to define how a creature like us can reach that perfect closeness to God, or the perfect state, whatever that is, from 1).  <br>  <br>  3) The third aspect is the examination of what keeps us from reaching that perfect state and how it is overcome.  This is where we get into the definition of good and evil, and the difference.<br>  <br>  Most of the major religions teach you how to be good, which is part of 3), and in that aspect you could say that they are all the same and lead you in the same direction of 2).  However, read on...  <br>  <br>  Religions disagree on 1), as far as defining if there is a God or what God is.  They may agree on the aspect of the traits that would define a perfection.  Aristotle defined perfection by what it is NOT - perfection is not evil, perfection is not lazy, it is not finite...etc.<br>  <br>  Religions totally diverge on 2).  Buddhism for example emphasizes a discipline through which you can attempt to perfect yourself eventually.  I disagree with that, because I agree with Aristotle that every square on earth is inherently imperfect.  If we are inherently imperfect, nothing we could ever do will ever make us 100% perfect.  <br>  <br>  We can get to be 99% outstanding relative to our fellow squares, but we can never become 100% perfect.  99% is not good enough to get into heaven, if you mathematically agree with Aristotle.<br>  <br>  So what is the solution?  Between 99% goodness and 100% perfection, there is an infinite chasm between heaven and earth.  Technically we could never reach heaven, no matter what we do, no matter how hard we try.      <br>  <br>  St. Augustine picked up at this point from Aristotle, where I think he very logically shows us that Christ, who is our "mathematically perfect square" in heaven, is the only one who can help us.  <br>  <br>  We were given a conscience, so we are responsible to be imitators of Christ, the perfect square who is the Son of God Himself, the best we can.  But we are imperfect squares by nature.  We are sinners.  We could never reach Heaven, except that the perfect square himself, who is Christ, reaches to us and saves us.  Christ is our bridge so we can cross that uncrossable chasm.<br>  <br>  This is why I am a Christian.  I am also a Catholic because after examining the writings of the earliest Christians and their consistency with current Catholicism, I notice that the Catholic Church is the one that most thoroughly teaches the original concepts and practices that were pass on to us from Christ through his Apostles, and their disciples (example St. Irenaeus, disciple of St. Polycarp, disciple of St. John the Evangelist, Apostle of Jesus Christ, Son of God).  <br>  <br>  With Christ, you have forgiveness of sins from your own Lord and Savior so you can cross that infinite chasm between imperfection and perfection.<br>  <br>  Without Christ, you are back to pure justice, and it is impossible for an imperfect being to be absolutely and completely just.  I have hope that nevertheless, Christ sees the intent of a just heart if it is honestly seeking and desiring Him, even if they haven't recognized Him yet.|`|yb7qKI2yaa	I consider myself agnostic.

Few people would argue that faith in Christ's perfect sacrifice for our sins is the only means of salvation. <br>  <br>  However, that doesn't give us license to sit back and do nothing. James talks about seeing brethren in need of food, clothing, and the basic necessities and doing nothing to help them. He says that "Faith without works is dead."<br>  <br>  So while the faith that leads to salvation is a free gift of God through Christ Jesus, maintaining that faith and keeping it alive involves work on our part. The two things complement each other, as do so many other Scriptures.|`|bTA5ndeMaa	And, still it says that we were created for good works!<br>  <br>  " For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that we should walk in them."<br>  <br>  So, what is the meaning of it all?!<br>  <br>  Remember what law we are talking about.|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Honestly, this stuff was written a long time ago for a totally different culture.

That practice leads to all kinds of errors --spiritually, morally, and emotionally.<br>  <br>  The passage you cite needs to be read in terms of the entire Bible contents. For example, there is the passage in Malachi that states God hates divorce (putting away.) Jesus also says that the only reason Moses permitted divorce was because of the hardness of men's hearts. He also states, "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."<br>  <br>  There's no mention of believer or unbeliever in that passage -- just that marriage should not be dissolved. That's why it's necessary to know what other Scriptures say about a topic before deciding what you believe about the subject.|`|771e401b864ef2c6278719b487b80406aa	Unless two individuals are both joined to the Savior YAHOSHUA, it isn't eternal anyway, for the only way we can live forever is to participate in YAHOSHUA, who only has eternal life.|`|naI5hGjHaa	i think you need to think on your own a bit and stop worrying so much about this

Also note that the ppl did in fact hear GODs voice in these times b/c there was not a spokesperson like JC yet... god only dealt with the prophets at that time... secondly, In john jc is making reference to GOD, basically stating that the ppl did not hear GOd b/c they recieved GOD thru JC, not GOD in the spirit like MOses did ini deuteronomy... and they did not see GODs shape , however they did see JC.. that is what he is talking about in this scripture...

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

You ask if your life will be better, again as you know, no one here can answer that question except you.<br>  <br>  It sounds like we have very similar backgrounds. Small conservative town (northern) a life with a wonderful woman. one son, over compensate on the macho manly things.<br>  <br>  I had been divorced from my wife for 2 years when I meant a woman and fell in love for the first real time in my life. She showed me what love is and what it meant to truly feel loved. We were planing a life together, love had cured me of all the gender confusion I had dealt with my whole life. I had always wished I had been born a girl and for the first time ever I liked and wanted to be a guy. It had not gone away, I had just pushed it a bit deeper and it started coming back stronger then ever. I knew she had a right to know and told her one night as we watched a show on discovery health about transition. We had talked in the past some but it was the have you ever wondered type of conversation. That night I told her every thing. We agreed we could deal with it but 3 years later she walked out without a word to me. I knew the reason but did not want to accept it. I went into a very deep depression and knew I had to do something or I would not have made it to the end of the year. That was March of 05. Looking back I can see I had started to transition a little at a time from the moment I told her.<br>  <br>  Four years later I am nearing the end of my journey, it is just a matter of getting the last of the money saved. I do miss her and the relationship we had. I have dealt with the struggles of transition But I have found something I never knew existed in life. I found contentment, an inner peace I never knew people were capable of feeling. I can look in the mirror and see a person I've learned to like. I can see a person I know is a kind person with a lot of love to share.<br>  <br>  Will your life be better? No one can answer that nor can you at this point. Can you live the rest of your life feeling as you do? No one knows exactly how you feel. While transition has been the hardest thing in my life it has also been the most rewarding.<br>  <br>  What ever you decide good luck. If you ever need to talk send an e-mail or Instant Messenger message.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|ITMOmE5Caa	No one can promise you results.

I later married and had another child. Who through divorce has been completely estranged. I originally married my ex in 1994, and was very upfront explaining that I was/am a transsexual.. I don't know what she thought.. Perhaps she could cure me. <br>  <br>  But she said that if I ever transitioned, that she would divorce me. <br>  <br>  As life happened, we lost our house a year after 9/11 due to job situations and a con-artist. Then moved back across the US and in with my parents.. <br>  This simply caused more stress in our relationship, I started having more and more difficult times.. Co-workers began making comments on how my behavior was more like a woman's, I often times would have to stop during my commute and cry.. <br>  <br>  A curious thing began to happen, I started becoming more depressed, and soon I sought out a therapist.. <br>  <br>  As this happened the relationship between my ex and myself began falling apart. <br>  <br>  all of this seemingly caused my life, our life to fall apart around me, and due to depression it all seemed to be my fault.. <br>  <br>  yet with my therapists help I began going to support groups.. <br>  Where people started telling me that I was going to transition, as they somehow saw me, a girl, not the guy I pretended to be.<br>  <br>  It’s very strange, the support seemed to help, I learned that I wasn’t totally alone.. But my depression only seemed to get worse, and the stress in our relationship grew. <br>  I eventually seemed to loose touch with reality, my ex’s abuse started showing to outsiders, and I gave up, I attempted suicide.. <br>  <br>  Then two weeks after returning from the mental hospital my ex filed a temporary restraining order against me and left the state.. <br>  <br>  I went to my therapist and exclaimed that my ex made her choice, and mine was to start HRT. <br>  <br>  After my initial blood test, I learned much of my depression had been created due to imbalanced hormones from being chromosomally intersexed. <br>  <br>  As we started bring my hormones into balance, I knew in my heart and soul that transitioning was my destiny.. <br>  I’m hours away from my surgery, I’ve been living full time for a couple of years now. <br>  I’ve been discriminated against, lost my former job, estranged from 1 of my daughters.. <br>  But in all of that, I’ve found an internal peace that was beyond my comprehension. <br>  <br>  Life is not perfect, but it is what you make of it.  <br>  <br>  Personally I feel my life to be more complete and fulfilling even with the sorrow.|`|V5lxDoIRaa	I started transition when i was thirteen years old.

N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  1) I've seen it done and kids came about so being intimate wasn't a problem.<br>  <br>  2) It sounds more practical. Sometimes people can see us better than we see ourselves. The families can look at the two parties who the are arranging and see both their personalities, temperaments, things in common, economic and educational compatibilities etc. There is no blind emotion or infatuation initially which makes the marriage planned and more practical.<br>  <br>  3) With a 50% marriage failure in our western societies we can ill afford to be too critical of this approach found in other cultures.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|Lc5FtItDaa	As it turns out you don't really know a person until after you marry them.<br>  <br>  Also cultures with arranged marriages tend to have a more pragmatic view of sex.  (It is your duty to make children to continue the family line).|`|FKxrJxbPaa	Well you're forgetting that other cultures view sex very differently from the way we do. Today's western concept of sex is actually very modern, most marriages up until the late 19th century were based on economical reasons, rarely for "true love" as many like to believe. People married people whom they were socially and economically compatible with who they just so happened to like lol. Love was an element, but not so big an element as movies would make you believe.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, millions of men and women in the US go out and have almost anonymous sex with people they pick up at bars and clubs all the time. Its really not that different and probably worse. At least in an arranged marriage you're building a life together and sex is just the pragmatic part of it.|`|XT51fZq7aa	Its a Muslim tradition.I think its daft especially when they marry in countries such as Pakistan then have to get divorced because they cant get the women in the country.My friend went through an arranged marriage like this,even when they get attached because he spent a few weeks with her, they had to get divorced.I think the man gets to choose but the woman gets no say in the matter.|`|e3464b509c689e1c76649b284032cdc5aa	white girls wouldn mind arranged marriage..they have sex with people they don't know anyway..|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Its a cultural thing.|`|AA11786648	That's odd since it is prevalent in American culture to be "intimate with a person you don't know".

naI5hGjHaa	ha ha, so true.|`|7EsRIZ3vaa	Your logic is sound! What is unsound is the doctrine you were taught as a young and tender Baptist. I have spent a great deal of time with Baptist. I am a Baptist (reformed). Even so, I have never heard this taught from any Baptist pulpit. The orthodox Christian view is that men are condemned because they deserve condemnation. They are sinners who sin. No one goes to heaven or hell based on whether or not they heard the Gospel. Men go to hell because they are sinners... and ignorance of the law is no excuse. Men go to heaven because God, in an act of pure grace, bestows on them faith in the perfect work of Christ who took upon himself the wrath of God against their sin.|`|xelkbdbdaa	Nah. You seem to be leaving out the verses that relate to our responsibility to share the Good News. Well, I'm not sorry about it. But, bear in mind, we are also told to leave the town of those who don't want to hear the message. With that being said, if you don't believe after you've heard about it, it's nobody elses fault. And, we don't have the responsibility of forcing you to believe. That is not the Christian way. And, you might find that the worldly church is the one that takes that more seriously, not the few non-secular believers....|`|qA0VCdn5aa	I am Church of Christ, not baptist, so my views are different.<br>  I believe that the only way to get into heaven is to know, trust and accept God+/Jesus into your heart.

The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach; <br>  Rom 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. <br>  <br>  Yours in Christ,<br>  John the Baptist

Notwithstanding the TIger economies of the East (which are stumbling right now, like the rest of us) Mandarin is not just the very devil to learn to speak because it is a tonal language - for example "hai" can, depending on intonation, means about 18 different things, some of them somewhat crude as well.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn to write Mandarin then that is even harder...<br>  <br>  Not that Spanish and French are easy, however as I am presuming English is your mother tongue, then any Romance language, comes a little easier - if youve studied Latin at any time, then that's a help too.<br>  <br>  There are free on line classes (on the BBC for example) to get you started, and your local college may do evening classes, or you can try these CD sets....talking to a native speaker, or another fluent speaker is best though and practising with friends.<br>  <br>  Spanish is spoken widely throughout South America, and obviously in Spain and across the westerly and southern United States....<br>  <br>  Mandarin may be a numerically widely spoken language, because of the number of people in China that speak it, but it isn't used elsewhere except in expat Chinese communities, and a lot of them speak Cantonese anyway....<br>  <br>  I'll vote for you learning to speak Spanish - Buena suerte!<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|J7ZZL1bCaa	How about the language of Heaven....Welsh?<br>  It's very useful in Welsh Wales.<br>  <br>  Beth am iaith y nefoedd....Cymraeg?<br>  Mae'n ddefnyddiol iawn yn y Gymru Gymraeg.|`|Ymo88Objaa	You've just given to you the best answer.|`|aOUjMhUmaa	It really depends on your goals in life.

The pressure is extreme to stay with this false satanic religion.|`|9ozLBt5Qaa	Note that many Muslims are forced to stay a Muslim because of pressure and Islamic culture and duties.  It's harder for a born (especially Indian /Asian Muslim) to say 'I want out', to become say an Atheist or Christian or Hindu. There are tons of Ex-Muslim groups in the UK and USA too and many Muslim women also read the Bible in secret.<br>  <br>  Having said that many Muslims have converted to Christianity.<br>  <br>  In December 2001, Sheikh Ahmad al Qataani, a leading Saudi cleric, appeared on a live interview on Aljazeera satellite television to confirm that Muslims were turning to Jesus in alarming numbers. "In every hour, 667 Muslims convert to Christianity," Al Qataani said. "Every day, 16,000 Muslims convert to Christianity. Every year, 6 million Muslims convert to Christianity." <br>  <br>  It's now 2009 and it's still growing. Christianity is more about faith, prayer, hope and fasting and loads of charity work.

I've known quite a few that have converted to other religions, or even outright became atheists.|`|GJS3hTK5aa	Muslims don't consider Jesus as the son of God. It is not their fault; that is what revealed to Prophet Mohammad by God. So, they are supposed to be righteous in their life totally to enter heaven. They don't have an intermediary between God and them. Christians are blessed people, since they have a Lord who intercedes for each of them. Since Muslims don't have Jesus as their savior, each of them has to lead an utmost virtuous life in order to attain the kingdom of God. Even they shall also be judged by Jesus alone and they know it too.|`|Me2oJOtAaa	why is it so hard for christians to accept Krishna as the true personality of godhead ? <br>  <br>  ahh - because you dont BELIEVE thats right do you ? <br>  <br>  Now personaly im not the biggest fan of the muslim religion, but while I may not LIKE their beliefs - i certainly respect their right to go practise their faith in peace, without being harrassed by ''tolerant '' and '' loving '' christians like yourself.... <br>  <br>  what your jesus really taught has been obliterated by the likes of st paul and constantine.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

If they're successful in learning foreign languages, and can master them easier than a lot of other people, then it may be their field of affirmation and personal career advancement. <br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with that, even if they want above average results.

4jiEViPFaa	CASSANDRA <br>  Gender: Feminine <br>  <br>  Usage: English, Greek Mythology (Latinized) <br>  <br>  Pronounced: k?-SAN-dr? (English)  [key] <br>  <br>  From the Greek Κασσανδρα (Kassandra), which possibly meant "shining upon man", derived from κεκασμαι (kekasmai) "to shine" and ανηρ (aner) "man" (genitive ανδρο?). In Greek myth Cassandra was a Trojan princess, the daughter of Priam and Hecuba. She was given the gift of prophecy by Apollo, but when she spurned his advances he cursed her so nobody would believe her prophecies.<br>  In the Middle Ages this name was common in England due to the popularity of medieval tales about the Trojan War. It subsequently became rare, but was revived in the 20th century.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NAOMI (1) <br>  Gender: Feminine <br>  <br>  Usage: English, Jewish, Biblical <br>  <br>  Pronounced: nay-O-mee (English), nie-O-mee (English)  [key] <br>  <br>  From the Hebrew name ??????? (Na'omiy) meaning "pleasantness". In the Old Testament this was the name of the mother-in-law of Ruth. After the death of her husband, Naomi took the name Mara (see Ruth 1:20). Though previously common as a Jewish name, Naomi was not typically used as an English Christian name until after the Protestant Reformation.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  NAOMI (2) <br>  Gender: Feminine <br>  <br>  Usage: Japanese <br>  <br>  Other Scripts: 直美 (Japanese) <br>  <br>  From Japanese 直 (nao) "honest, straight" and 美 (mi) "beautiful".<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  FRANCESCA <br>  Gender: Feminine <br>  <br>  Usage: Italian <br>  <br>  Pronounced: frahn-CHES-kah  [key] <br>  <br>  Italian feminine form of Franciscus (see FRANCIS).<br>  (English form of the Late Latin name Franciscus which meant "Frenchman".)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helped!|`|AA10200409	Naomi=pleasant one, above all in beauty<br>  Cassandra=capricious<br>  <br>  I could find Franchesca

If they believed that upon her death she would immediately go to heaven, what was the point of keeping her body alive?  Why was it so important to "save" her?  What were they "saving" her from?<br>  <br>  Anyway, I will admit to being a bit creeped out by spending time that near to dead bodies.

My fathers didn't own slaves so I don't know where you get off saying "YOUR FATHERS." My parents didn't own slaves. My grandparents didn't. My great-grandparents didn't. And all the way back to Europe, Africa, Asia and North America where my family comes from, none of them owned slaves. Also I would like to point out that many biracials owned black slaves.<br>  <br>  Edit: I agree about Dr. Phil. It's not all white show. When you watch Maury, it's hosted by a white guy but you see an equal number of white and black people on it.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	I understand your feelings and your point, but since this is such an important issue, please look at it carefully and without prejudice. I'm not saying you're prejudiced - I only mean without pre-judging.<br>  AA preachers have been bashing the self described superior race for a long time, but not all of them. Louis Farrakhan was very anti-Semitic whereas the founder of the Black Muslims demonized white poeple. The stigma of being born into a black family wounds children deeply, and these kids walk around with a very big chip on their shoulders. The country is really much less racist than it used to be but because racism still exists AA blame most of their problems on racism. The anger of AA youths causes them to lose interest in school because it is educating them "To be white", that is, to become assimilated. They are caught on the horns of a dilemma - if they assimilate, they fear they will lose the specialness of being African in origin, but if they don't assimilate, they won't be accepted.  This is my hypothesis and it seems to fit the facts.<br>  Blacks feel they must promote their own history because that history and their contributions to the country have gone unnoticed for so long.<br>  And it does help to read about the achievements of AA men and women - reading this type of history makes you see them as human beings. <br>  Finally, scientists have abandoned the notion of race altogether. It was always a social construct. That is, Europeans invented it so they could feel superior to Africans, Native Americans and then Orientals. Being superior meant that they could fool themselves into believing that making slaves of Africans made them more human. In other words, it allowed them to be cruel without feeling any guilt. Pretty convenient, eh? Did you know there is more variation among dogs than there is among people? The whole idea of human races is wrong. There are nationalities and ethnic groups.|`|rlEoPwjEaa	I'm white and I do say what i want. there are no deviations in what I say about anyone or anything.<br>  <br>  I see no reason to call ppl any kind of racial or prejudiced slurs..but i do make jokes in good nature.<br>  <br>  I dont like hurting anyone's feelings unless they hurt mine ..or someone elses.<br>  <br>  racial slurs against me such as cracka or white bread or honky means nothing to me. those are just words..<br>  <br>  however saying something like everyone in my race sleeps with dogs..or we all molest children..well then yes I will say something.

While you have some personality weaknesses you are generally able to compensate for them. You have considerable unused capacity that you have not turned to your advantage. Disciplined and self-controlled on the outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure on the inside. At times you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You also pride yourself as an independent thinker; and do not accept others' statements without satisfactory proof. But you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At times you are extroverted, affable, and sociable, while at other times you are introverted, wary, and reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be rather unrealistic.
x74UNAdQaa	There are other gods mentioned in the Bible, and that is why the distinction is made from the Lord, and the gods.<br>  <br>  And sorry, art...but the handful of good deeds we do over our lifetimes is unlikely to weigh out against all the bad things.

What sort of god is that<br>  <br>  I try my best to be a good person, because I feel better when I do. So, on the grounds of that fact, I would think that I would be judged favorably. And if not, well, that's not a god I want to cooperate with anyway.|`|ZMxgHl4xaa	What makes atheists is mostly the inability to imagine what or who God is. The reason that "faith" is needed in religion is because the principles and the extensions of religion beyond our ability to picture, are so far away that it requires some trust to believe. We humans are not easily capable of trust and understanding of what we cannot imagine. For most of us, we are fearful that trust in something unproven can make us uncomfortably vulnerable.|`|971d3daea9af9b7b15f437ab3cfcc861aa	Personally, I think that all gods are one god and all goddesses are one goddess.

yPjbKop0aa	well some people believe in the ideology- have it, flaunt it!!. they have extra money to spare so they go out and splurge if there is anything that attracts them at that time.they shop compulsively. they are unable to control their urge, and buy things that they may never need. some regret it, some don't. also some people buy to show off to others that they have more money and resources. they associate money with social symbol. like if goin out for buying out a car, their thinking would be -the bigger, the better.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	Money is for spending and life is for experiencing. I hope more people start spending like that and get this economy going again.|`|EYqTV2EYaa	This question can technically be answered in several ways. Firstly, people can have a normal and natural liking for the items they purchase, just as most of us love candy, but it's no true necessity we must eat candy to live, as we can eat tons of other foods. The person could be a collector, admirer, or average joe. I, for example, like beautiful flowers and decorations like cultural, fruity, and floral paintings in my home to give it my own personalized look and feel, which makes me feel better about my place. As a result, I would them off to my visitor. However, it's possible people can see my fancy decorations as 'unnecessary.' That's because we all have different opinions on what we prefer. Secondly, it should be noted this society is tough on poor people, and the judgments can be too much to bear at times. Therefore, the poor notices the richer people, that generally get more positive attention in society, buying expensive things and showing them off. As a result, the poor would attempt to purchase 'unnecessary' items in attempt to get positive attention or to at least feel more valuable in society. Thus, the item purchase could be anything as long as it has an expensive price. Thirdly, well, the person can merely be a rich person that purchases expensive items because that's all (s)he's used to. It highly depends on the person. Fourthly and finally, buying items and flaunting them is also heavily influenced by marketing techniques. For instance, on TV, you may see a commercial about a particular item, like a big screen TV, and it's really convincing you to purchase the product. You don't really need it, but because of the advertiser's witty wording, product's great abilities, and the people in the commercial seemingly happy and flaunting their big screen TV, viewers of the commercial may feel 'brainwashed' into believing they 'need' the TV and that it's valuable enough to flaunt because of the price and the way it was portrayed on the commercial. Therefore, when people get something that has a high price, it's nearly natural to flaunt.|`|aDhZIhQcaa	Some people base their identity of who they are on what they own and how much it costs.  They attempt to "keep up with the Joneses", per say.  Those people do this because they are insecure with who they are and have to maintain appearances because they are afraid that they will not be accepted by others for who they really are.  Those people also, end up in severe debt just trying to maintain this "illusion" of what they have.  It is sad, but true.  A lot of time it can become an obsession and a mental illness called "compulsive/obsessive behaviour".|`|jROpVbrhaa	Yes this happens now a days, because they dont know how to spend their money wisely.Hope in this time of crisis,everybody should know how to spend their money.|`|TTt51jutaa	This happens very often just because of the fact of people having "big eyes", or the act of buying something in vain.|`|j2VDYbeoaa	Because they are insecure and shallow!

L2Nde54Haa	Istimna (???????) is the Arabic term for masturbation. It is completely forbidden in the Shi'a sect[1], but the four Sunni schools of jurisprudence (known as Madhaahib - the Hanafi, Shafi'i, Maliki and Hambali schools of Fiqh) have differing stances on the issue. Some consider it forbidden in all cases. Some see it forbidden in certain cases but permissible in others[2]. Some believe that masturbation may possibly only be done in fear of committing adultery, nor is it preferred (getting married or fasting are suggested as alternatives in the hadith). Another view[who?] is that it is Makruh but not expressly forbidden. Scholars of Islam do not approve of masturbation, except in extenuating circumstances. There is a statement in Quran "And those who guard their chastity, Except in the case of their wives or those whom their right hands possess,- for then, they are free from blame; But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are transgressors." -23:5-7. As the above ayah shows,masturbation is not allowed in Islam. Many scholars are of the opinion that if it was allowed, it would have been explicitly mentioned in the above ayah. As it has not been mentioned, it is taken to be completely forbidden.|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	It is a basic human instinct.

If you are a big fan of a particular band or actor or sports team the thought patterns are often the same as they are in church when people jump up and down screaming and singing their praises to whatever god they chose. This is true, it is simple human nature to take comfort or find meaning in something that is not actually powerful in that way, like god or the Beatles or the new york nicks, but I believe that if you give something that kind of power over you then it can have the same effect. I am an atheist because I do not believe in doing this. I do not believe that a person should let any one thing have that much influence over them, to the point of being brainwashed or regurgitating information like a mindless robot. We as people take many things on faith every day of our lives. The water will turn on when I turn the faucet, the lights will come on, my car will start, my job will still be there, the government looking out for my best interest, these are all simple things that occur every day and most everyone take these things for granted. This is just another form of worship, taking things on faith that may or may not happen or be true. Its a comfort.

KWvGUoW6aa	They are saying that you have to believe in something. My dad is a minister and he uses this argument on me too. He says, "well if you take god out of the picture then you have to explain how we got here. You believe in the big bang, so you have to have faith that the big bang happened, just like I have faith that god exists." <br>  <br>  The truth is that I don't have to explain anything. I can just say, "I don't know." It's a very liberating thing to admit that you just don't know the answer to something. I think that a lot of people have a tendency to appear to know the answer to something even if they don't.<br>  <br>  The thing about science is that it's always subject to change. As the scientific community gains a better understanding of how the universe works, they can modify their theories in order to construct a better model for how the earth may have formed, or how the universe works.<br>  <br>  Religious people haven't imagined a world without an imaginary friend, so it's hard for them to fathom anything else. Plus, many of them don't want to take the time to learn about science, and many of them also are just not comfortable with the idea that there are some things the human race just doesn't have an answer for (yet).
4694a9a7f477a3633e142f48c042a98caa	well i personally DO love asian girls. Chinese at the top of the list. i love their facial features and the culture. and for ME its not about the stereotypical type of submissive. i know a lot of guys love that but i cant stand being catered to. and the asian women i have met are NOT like that.. which works for me. i figure if i am capable of doing something i prefer to do it myself. LOl. but to answer your question about why would they choose a more ordinary or average or under average attractive woman.. well all guys will ogle and love looking at the drop dead gorgeous ones. BUT in reality. the ones we prefer to settle down with are the ones who look more normal or average. great looks get old after a while.. then you are down to day to day living so we prefer someone who is more ordinary and more like us.. again its nice to see the really hot ones but in reality we tend to choose the more average ones instead... looks fade after time no matter what. but that is when it gets to the point that hopefully you see more of their insides that makes the relationship last. after all thats what makes the most difference in the long run.|`|e1a7bc55a49362ce6489ded532083a8eaa	Because they seem cute, cuddly, sweet, and amenable!

yDgxAHO9aa	pride|`|r8rykCkGaa	Lucifer, a top angel who got into sin deceived them.  When he was kicked out of heaven, 1/3 of the angels went with him.  They are here bothering us now.  That is why all the spiritual warfare and trouble we have.|`|biPAZ2TVaa	Lucifer fell, but he wasnt the only one. Before the days of Noah, over 200 angels decided to go down to earth and take for wives beautiful daughters of men. The children that came from spirit and flesh were giants and thats why God destroyed all His creation with the flood. All fallen angels are chained down in tartarus awaiting judgement day with no hope, because God gave them eternal life in heaven and they went for lustful pleasures. Lucifer is still free, but God will throw Him in the lake of fire as he knows his days are counted.|`|dEdD8g0Qaa	The ArcAngel Lucifer (the bringer of light, beacon of hope etc.) was such a good angel, and gods favourite. and he became as vain to raise his throne in heaven to the level of that of gods throne.<br>  <br>  in a fit of anger god cast him out of heaven for presuming that he was as good as god.<br>  <br>  so technically fallen angel isnt really a correct term. he did no fall, he  was pushed.|`|2vf6tu8Oaa	Cause they forget how to thank god...|`|Gc49JgoQaa	They caught Hubris.

Your boyfriend probably did that because it was the day before Valentine's Day and he didn't want to feel obligated to celebrate it with you. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your surgery!|`|j4gxic8Oaa	Friday has found to be, by and large, the WORST day to have surgery on, because surgeons are most likely to be CARELESS and distracted  by the upcoming weekend. My uncle was keyhole-operated on for his gallbladder on a Friday, and the surgeon nicked his duodenum in the process, and digestive fluid was leaking into his abdomen for a WEEK before they caught it; he had to have further surgery consisting of having his guts lifted OUT of his body, rinsed of all the digestive fluids and put back in place! He barely survived; after that I tell you, I would NEVER get operated on, on a Friday!|`|sXH9FcrZaa	it will be unlucky if you believe in it. and it will just be another normal day if you don't.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Good lord... it's just a stupid day with a stupid number attached to it... don't be so silly.  You're surgery and you will be just fine !!!|`|mAa25My0aa	Skeptics are prone to saying that it's only a superstition, which is true, so it won't have any effect on your surgery, which is not true.  Surgery is done by a doctor, who is human and who may be superstitious.  There is an increased chance, just based on that, that it may be "unlucky" to have surgery on Friday the 13th.<br>  <br>  People, even people who don't believe Friday the 13th has a supernatural significance, tend towards having more stress on days they are culturally aware are considered "bad".<br>  <br>  Personally I don't believe Friday the 13th has any supernatural significance but being skeptical I can't allow myself to then assume it has no behavioral significance.  Doing a little research confirms that it does.  A British medical study advises not getting surgery on Friday the 13th.|`|dNlHCzS5aa	No, it's just supersticion
u8CFwtyMaa	If he's touching and tickling you when you're alone together, then that's more than casual friendship, it's showing affection.

rQ1xl3ckaa	yes yes yes yes it's very true! I was just at the Marriott World Center and they do not have a 13th floor. I guess anyone who's superstitious would be upset if they got put on the 13th. While I was staying at the Marriott (in Florida) I remember someplace else without a 13th floor, but I can't remember exactly what it was. Anyway, many places [maybe even almost all of them?? I don't know how many] don't have a 13th floor for superstitious reasons.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	I lived in an old building in downtown Los Angeles a long time ago, and it didn't have a 13th floor, but rather skipped straight on to the 14th floor. It was built in 1913 and apparently they were highly superstitious back then. I find the whole thing rather silly myself. After all, if you skip numbering a floor "13" and go straight to 14, the 14th floor is *still* the 13th floor. You just misnumbered it. I guess if that's what it takes to get your triskaidekaphobia under control - self delusion - then that's what it takes. LOL!|`|uRV8SqThaa	I stayed in the Swissotel in Chicago a couple of weeks ago.  I was on the 14th floor, which should have actually been the 13th floor but they skipped that number.|`|LQ7rROMSaa	Yup. I've been to several hotels in the United States without a "13" button in the elevator.|`|GZzclgn9aa	Yes, it is true. Some hospitals don't have the 13th floor too, because they consider it unlucky|`|4Z34OVmWaa	Yup,not just hotels but houses too.13 is said to be a bad luck number,so they skipped that number.|`|Dt3AkTgmaa	Yes, right here in New York City.|`|AA12302228	they used to,my inlaws house would be 13 but its 15 as the council estate where they live has no houses with 13 in the adress.|`|RrQNJsVsaa	Yes, the point of it is, in 1809 all hotels had 13 floors. People always were checking out on the 12th, 14th, and especially the 13th floor. On the 12th floor they heard footsteps from nowhere and crying from the 13th floor above them. The 14th floor had a lot of pounding from the 13th floor. It was thumping their beds, and other things. Some unknown things happened to most 13 floors of hotels. Some that do 13 floors are the ones that didn't have check-outs for no reason. The ones that don't have them are the hotels that did have things like that in 1809. That rose the superstition of the 13th floor. They thought it had to do with the number of black magic, 13. Reset all thoughts, the 13th floor have had a lot of cases during then. People scene ghosts, people were dying and getting hurt for no reason. And in 1808 there is said this one man didn't know he was a ghost and he didn't show up on camera. He disappeared the next morning and never came back. The history goes on forever for the 13th floor. I wouldn't go to the 12th, 13th, or 14th floor if I were you. The haunting has to happen to the 13th floor sometime to any hotel. So that day that you are at the hotel may be the day. Don't do it.|`|0exde9VEaa	I have been in one with 12a floor.  Aslo no Room 13, but Room 12a ....some have the 13th floor of the building used for something else other then for  guest rooms, e.g. service floor to avoid no 13.. .  Most add in a "00" or "10" in front of floor or room numbers, so that Room 1013 etc. looks less " unlucky" and safe ....|`|PvV0aNvfaa	Yes, alot of em don't. i live in the bay aera, calif. they don't have a 13th floor cuz the #13 is bad luck an the bldg. designers didn't want to take any chances when building the bldgs.|`|5eu5P1hYaa	Yes, I stayed at one in florida once, and it didn't have a 13th floor OR any room #13.|`|zEoRcL91aa	Yes, but don't ask me where!

WbaN6osZaa	satire?<br>  <br>  If you aren't joking, why would anyone compare the construction of a tool by humans to the evolution of lifeforms?<br>  <br>  One is a process of abstract and conceptual thought - the other is a process of natural selection.<br>  <br>  Go study biology and psychology, please, give your common sense a workout beyond the 'Magic Man Did It!' totality of your worldview.  I dare you.<br>  <br>  Owing to the nature of matter and energy (energy cannot be created or destroyed) it is more likely that energy always existed.  I have no problem in using 'common sense'.  Common sense tells me that since we see literally nothing being 'created' from nothing, in nature, then the entire cosmos is a larger version of this, it exists forever and recycles constantly.  You think of things in a human fashion, so your 'logic' (and patriarchal cultural conditioning) is inclined to egotistically imagine that 'men' or a 'man god' is responsible for anything that you see.<br>  <br>  The human self-referencing ego asks 'who, who?'<br>  <br>  When nature shows 'what, where..how'?<br>  <br>  The difference between science and superstition is in learning to ask questions about the nature of things rather than putting ourselves in the centre stage of the cosmos.|`|qRue8Xdraa	Chow can? <br>  <br>  Hold on, I have to unlock the door in my brain to get my common sense.<br>  <br>  Your questions are nonsequitur when we've observed carpenters making chairs and lumberjacks cutting down trees. Science sure does break it down to us how we are to function in the simplest way. Your intellect that has caused you to further from this explanation was your "God did it" notion.|`|408d09404066a3f4b3514273ef2131cdaa	If it's true that the human being had to be created by something, what makes you so certain that YOUR specific god did the creating?

Great logic. Which is more likely: That a complicated thing came into being by itself or that an insanely mind-bogglingly complicated thing came into being by itself?<br>  <br>  The answer should be obvious. Although no atheist or scientist that I know of actually claims the universe came from nothing.|`|XoUfUl6Yaa	Common sense tells you existence was created by a supernatural entity? Maybe you utilize common nonsense.|`|GGGmoyNeaa	I could answer your question but you wouldn't listen so run off and pray to the tooth fairy or whatever and don't waste any more of anybodys time|`|I1tfz8nVaa	Argument from ignorance and straw men, well done.|`|C9Shvmp8aa	it was clever to choose a chair (carpentry).  however, procreation doesn't need God to choose the mate, when sex, where sex, how sex, or even why sex (rape).  And even science can map the seed from sperm, egg, fetus, 9 terms, and birth.<br>  The tree also has seed, fermentation, and growth.<br>  From where do these systems come from...only one line in the Old Testament versus evolution.<br>  God gave me free will, and I choose to question a line versus blind faith.  Faith and love take belief, not proof.<br>  Have God map/equate these otherwise and I'll study, learn, and accept.  Until then, your free will is to distaste me, and I choose to excercise my given free will to question, with validility that far exceeds one reference (the Bible).|`|KNKLAmuNaa	How do you justify God coming into existence by himself? Who made him?<br>  <br>  No atheist or evolutionist, says that "humans came into existence by themselves".<br>  <br>  If you looked at evolution (I take it this is what you're getting at) is an extrmely slow process with a LOT of false starts. It started out as fairly basic chemical reactions, which got more and more complicated as time went on. Eventually these chemicals were so large and complex they could form physical structures, and so on. It took BILLIONS of years before complicated life came into being. And that took hundreds of millions of years to evolve into humanity.<br>  <br>  And humans don't "construct themselves". We grow form one cell each, which divides into more, which specialise according to pre-written chemical codes. We aren't just made of parts like a chair, which need to be assembled- we absorb stuff around us (mainly form our mothers) and incorporte it into small parts by ourselves, with microscopic cells doing all the hard work. The construction of a chair revolves around COMPLETELY different principles. If your argument was correct, then we couldn't grow from egg cells.<br>  <br>  As for the universe, this is a different problem again. I doubt you have studies enough physics to fully grasp the concepts (few have), but there are several models explaining where the big bang came from. One involves pre-existing universes giving rise to new ones, and so on infinitely into the past.|`|c0KKHMsAaa	more often than you,<br>  <br>  sorry if that sounded rude.<br>  <br>  but you're right! zeus/thor/allah/FSM/skydaddy/loki/the wiccan gooddess/isis/apocatequil/Kinich Ahau/mishna/Amaterasu/Bosatsu/Ao/ Atutahi/Ogmios/Sequana    must have done it!(sarcasm)<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: why did it have to be created? why could it not have always been here?|`|wwdllMzYaa	existence , is not a chair<br>  in fact<br>  existence, and life<br>  is nothing like a chair in the slightest<br>  so your comparison is irrelevant<br>  <br>  if you ask about the TREE before its made by man into a chair, then we can discuss it<br>  <br>  a chair cannot "build itself"<br>  but<br>  the tree can<br>  <br>  there in is teh issue to discuss

Because alcy-hol done took the clothes off, that's how.<br>  <br>  I say gather information first.  Wait until she says something about it.  But by all means, DO NOT avoid her.

You can NOT become better ONLY in one area e.g. speaking, you MUST improve your skills in ALL dimensions of the language!<br>  <br>  Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!! English is practically EVERYWHERE in the online world these days, you just have to use your imagination to find it!<br>  <br>  Good luck and remember to keep your attitude positive!|`|g6pqGjrkaa	There are many institute which gives you the training how to talk fluently in English,  Or else buy Hindu paper and keep the dictionary by the side read the news and for the difficult words know the meaning from the dictionary, there by you can improve the language.|`|0jlG2clBaa	yes,you could try that.<br>  alongside,read.<br>  that helps a LOT.<br>  interact with people who are good at english<br>  watch english movies with subtitles<br>  <br>  I'm new to learning french..so lets hope both of us succeed in learning the new languages|`|gASz3hDWaa	You mean fluently not frequently. And yes if you want to learn, what else!|`|mZ1tUoacaa	well no can teach you a language until and unless you keep on trying to speak that particular language. so keep on going through newspapers, watch news channel like BBC to acquire a neutral accent and even install a small dictionary in your java enabled mobile phone or buy a pocket sized dictionary if you are not that tech savvy . slowly and steadily your pronunciation, vocabulary , fluency will increase with time.<br>       so don't go for any training classes which will make you mug up few lines some what like Rapidex English Speaking course book which i used to refer during my school days. so work hard and try to interact in this very language with your best friend who supports you and is well versed with the knowledge of the same language.since practice to learn a language is a must.

Sexuality is not simply a matter of straight or gay.  It's not, nor can it be, black and white - there are many shades in between.  Anyway, whose business is it but yours who you are attracted to?  If people can't accept you the way you are then they are not really the kind of people you need in your life.  Who you are attracted to or choose to love has no effect on the life of anyone else - just be comfortable being yourself and the world can either accept it or p*ss off!|`|yLG6QUuaaa	Why not. Granted society has a way to go to accept it totally. I think it has to a point. But it will happen eventually.|`|CvDzpQREaa	It's ok! :)<br>  <br>  People who say it isn't ok are idiots.|`|stnclsxnaa	well who cares what people say, its ok to be bi! funnily enough, straight people arent the only ignorant ones when it comes to being bisexual, gays & lesbians can be just as ignorant, so expect criticism from all corners. but just do what feels alright for you, after all, you are the one living yourlife, not every opinionated moron out there|`|dOGwA6Vjaa	Absolutely its ok. Don't let other pressure you into believe that something is or isn't ok just because of what they believe. In the end its all about your life and how you chose to live it.

UQTAN7cgaa	No, freemasons do not worship satan. <br>  <br>  over 100 years ago a world famous hoaxster, Leo Taxil, played a joke on freemasonry and wrote an expose misinterpreting Albert Pike... he admitted he was lying. EVERY claim of satan worship stems from this lie, only fools believe it today.<br>  <br>  the other statement is false as well, freemasons do not recruit so how can we be forced to bring in new members??? we also do not kill. there is no "chain of command"... again, more lies from people who know nothing about freemasonry and claim to be experts|`|dfjIBHe3aa	The straight-up answer is that these are DEFINITELY old, politically motivated lies which are being taken up by ignorant, arrogant and superstitious people.  I am quite frankly willing to refer to SOME rationalist and materialist beliefs as superstitions (though generally I am just going to call "skeptics" unpleasant).  It's not the belief in the devil which is the superstitious part of this -- it is the belief that someone who is different is in league with the devil.  Quite seriously, wherever you are hearing this, go elsewhere.  If it is at some evangelical Church, look at others, and if they are the same way look at "liberal" -- Methodist, Presbyterian, Lutheran Episcopalian or UCC denominations.  <br>  <br>  I am not a Mason.  I've refused membership for good reason more than once, but my father is one, I've dealt with Christians, Occultists and even a couple of self-professed Satanists.  I've met a few Christian Masons but never a serious one who was heavily involved in the latter two groups.  The idea they worship Satan is a LIE!  Satan is the FATHER OF LIES!  Get the connection?|`|AA11447210	No, the Mason's don't worship the mythological creature known as Satan.<br>  <br>  Do some research and you can find out more about the Masons. I've known a few people over the years who were part of that group. Sounds like you read an article by someone that knew nothing about them, but wanted to slander them.|`|wy5SiCS2aa	don't believe everything you read hon. My uncle has been a Mason for years and years and years. And he's a deacon in his church too. And he does a lot of good for children's charities, he's a good man. The Masons are a secret society, so that's why people make up a bunch of crap about them|`|547Ln6rNaa	Good lord no, all the men in our family are Masons, who on earth says they kill people? cite your reference article so I can read it please.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	I doubt that article had any validity to it.... Mason's don't "kill" anyone.|`|jyqpeg40aa	Masons do not kill each other because they did not a recruitment - besides, it would be easy to get someone to join in. Anyway, the masons do believe in christ though some will say other wise. There symbol, The square, circumference, and capitol G are the symbol of God. They worship Him and his angels - including the angel Lucifer. Lucifer is NOT the devil!<br>  Lucifer was a mistranslation in the bible from the first bible (in hebrew) to the latin version. There was a king in the hebrew bible Helel or something close to that. His name stood for Morning Star. Now the Latin translator just saw the name Helel as another word and translated it literally to Lucem Ferre - Day Star ( or Light Bearer or Light Bringer). In the Hebrew Bible - Helel killed the children of Babylon, making him evil (like a devil). The English translated the word Lucem Ferre as a name, not a word, and left it as Lucifer (Light Bearer, ECT.) Because the original guy (King Helel) was evil they made Lucifer (an actual angel of God) evil. <br>  Though Lucifer is a fallen angel, he did not fall to Hell, but to Earth instead. The mason worship him because he is not perfect, but as close as it gets to God, and they (the Masons) believe that they are like him. <br>  To answer your question shortly - they do not worship satan, kill each other or wish others to die - they just control the world and do what they must!|`|RNqHL8y7aa	Mason are a secret society.

ITMOmE5Caa	19, barely can be considered a teen but hey, I can't call myself an adult either.<br>  <br>  Homophobia, I would personally have to say and I've seen it first hand, is taught by your parents and your authoritative figures in your life. People grow up learning things from others who are older than them and even sometimes the same age or younger. Most teenagers, if not children and some adults, are easily influenced by those around them.<br>  <br>  I'm attracted to males but I'm a pre-op transgirl. I've never had a lesbian friend. However I know if I found a friend it wouldn't make me not want to be their friend if they were a lesbian, gay, or bisexual.<br>  <br>  If a lesbian liked me I wouldn't feel uncomfortable at all. After all, I know how it feels to be attracted to the same gender yet have the body of that same gender. Most boys wouldn't have understand who a transgender person was so I didn't care to take a chance.<br>  <br>  A lot of my cousins are homophobics because their parents are homophobic. My uncles would go "eww" when obvious guys were dressed up as girls trying to pass as girls or when guys were kissing other guys. Then my cousins started doing it as little kids. They are taught to be homophobic or think it's wrong. You're not born homophobic; it's not an instinct like how to walk or crawl.<br>  <br>  You know what also? I went along with trying to pass as a tomgirl straight boy. As a child, you're so insecure that you can't come out until you know you'll be able to make sure you can secure your future. Most do so but then again, some don't wait and come out then and there. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't. I waited until I knew my parents couldn't throw much of anything to come out and be open about it. It wasn't about being confused. It was about being able to live or die in this world.|`|cIvFOzoiaa	I am a gay teen.  The people I've told, about 25 people in grades 9-12, some of them I hardly know, don't care.  Sorry, forgot to mention the many people who say the word f** that don't know I'm gay.<br>  I think my school is just very open to things.  The kids that say f** go to other schools.|`|35ff9d3ad1eb64812f64b2031173d7e4aa	Background: Well, I grew up Catholic (not serious, but Church every week, etc.), and my parents aren't incredibly happy about the gay lifestyle, my father has in the past said some unkind things about it, but that wasn't prominent in my life as a young child.<br>  <br>  I've never given much about my peers sexuality. So long as they treat me fairly and don't try to pressure or threaten me in anyway, I'm fine with a person regardless of sexuality. Many of my friends fit under the LGBTQ umbrella, and many of which I only found out their sexuality recently. I don't "pick" people to be my friends based on sexuality, race, etc., nor do I give them more or less respect than my straight friends.<br>  <br>  As for homophobia being taught, I think that it's definitely passed from parent/guardian to child. That also goes for racism, or any other violent opposition to a group of people.|`|rKXf85ipaa	Personally I have no problem telling my cousins or siblings I'm bi, its my parents, grandparents and aunts and uncles I'm worried about.

I'm a teenager and I do know people who are homophobic. They're usually guys I know, so maybe that has something to do with it? Most people I know are fine with it. To me, it's just a part of society that we all need to learn to accept. Also, when people are against same-sex marriage, I think "Hey, if you are so against gay marriage, don't get one. It's their life." And also, if people are against gay rights and stuff like that, then that isn't fair because it's just like saying black or jews shouldn't be married or have the same rights.|`|xL6McXTfaa	I'm really open to homosexual people or whatever.  My experience is that it may seem like someone's homophobic (they'll say things like "that's so gay" or whatever, or use gay as an insult) but when they're actually in a situation with a homo sexual person nine times out of ten they just really don't care if they're gay, they treat the person the same.|`|AA11223515	i am an 18 year old bisexual girl and i have no problem wit it at all i love gay ppl and i no alot of them but on the other hand i do kno alot of ppl that does not like gay ppl at all|`|2gTgw9o9aa	im a freshie in high school. i personally love gay people. most people my age make fun of it constantly though. there are a lot of homophobes though.|`|pJzeUd0Haa	Well I'm a teen and I like guys but I'm not rly afraid with my skewl found out

Call your local lgbt info place to find current states and countries where gay marriage is legal - or check the wiki below. in those states and countries, you can either go to the courthouse or have a civil officiant marry you.  Some places have civil unions, which offer some of the same benefits. Countries where you can be legally married are Belgium Canada, Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Spain, while US States are Connecticut and Massachusetts.  Some states are now recognizing marriages from Canada (or other countries) for benefits, etc. in their own states.  Check the wiki article for where Civil Unions are recognized, etc.  Canadian marriages are legal in ALL provinces, so you can simply go north from where you live - we frequently marry US citizens in small private weddings and elopements in Toronto (in parks, and your hotel, etc.) - but you can get legally married in any province at a City Hall, without a big wedding.

R76ema39aa	1. What is the importance of the moon sliver-crescent on flags and emblems? <br>  <br>  There isn't any significance to it. It's just a symbol which is used, but it doesn't really have much coloration in Islam. <br>  <br>  2. I know that Muslims throwing stones at the Kaabah is symbolic of throwing them at Satan. But why was this pre-Islamic pagan shrine incorporated into Islam. The Holy Koran doesn't say.<br>  <br>  No muslims throw stones at the Kabah. Rocks are thrown during hajj time, in a place called Mina, a place close to Makkah. The Kabah is the direction where muslims pray towards 5 times a day. It's the Jamarat which stones are pelted towards. It goes back to when Abraham The angel Gabriel told him to pelt stones at the Devil. He threw 7 rocks, 3 times and the devil went away. And how is this a pagan tradition? I'm a little confused by what you mean?<br>  <br>  Oh and i'm a sunni muslim.<br>  <br>  --- <br>  Edit: <br>  <br>  Oh I'm sorry, i never realized you were talking about the black stone. By throwing rocks, i thought you were talking about the Hajj ritual. <br>  Ok so the Black stone. We know that the stone was put there by the Prophets Ibrahim, and Ismael (peace be upon them). The Prophet (SAW) companion has been recalled saying, “You are just a stone that does not benefit or harm anyone, and if I had not seen the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) kissing you, I would have not done so."<br>  <br>  So the only reason people touch/kiss it because of the association the Prophet (SAW) had with it. Islamic belief states that the stone came down from heaven (and yes it may have came down from heaven as a meteorite). A hadith states; <br>  <br>  Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) also narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “When the Black Stone came down from Paradise, it was whiter than milk, but the sins of the sons of Adam made it black.” (At-Tirmidhi)<br>  <br>  Religion throughout history has been believed to have changed over time. Pagan rituals may have came from original idea's of religion having been changed. For example, islam believes that worshipping statues only came about when the devil convinced mankind that God needed a face. So drawings were made, which eventually lead to worship of idols etc. I guess what i'm trying to say, is that the stone was put there by Prophets Ibrahim and Ismael (peace be upon both). and people may have incorparated the stone into pagan beliefs though it was originally not pagan. When Islam began, the only reason the stone was kept, was because of the fact the Prophets Ibrahim and Ismael (peace be upon them) had put it there. The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) probably recognised this, and realized that though other idols etc were pagan, where the stone came from and what it stood for was not what the Pagans believed. (Hope this makes a little sense?)|`|6CKRY6LIaa	1- nothing islam has no signs <br>  2-who said that it's pagan? it dates back to prophet Abraham ,was prophet Abraham a pagan?|`|2573c76efdef879eda46ec9df6a90d3daa	the moon sliver-crescent was made up lately. It has nothing to do with Islam as a erligion. It's just a symbol.<br>  <br>  what Muslims throw stones at IS NOT Kaabah. It's the place where satan tried to blocko  Abraham's way. Islam is an Abrahamic religion.<br>  <br>   Kaabah is the place where all Muslims around the world direct themselves to when they are to pray.

x0J8S5sWaa	It's easy to get a date or a partner if you aren't picky. Lot's of my friends date a ton of guys, even ones they aren't attracted to at first. One of them told me she just thinks to herself "well, maybe this is the guy who will make me happy and who I'll marry and love for the rest of my life." Basically, they are open to all options and don't have any presumptions about people. There are of course those who are, er, considered "slutty" (i hate that word) or "easy" (another one I hate) and go out with just about anyone or throw themselves at other people, but the majority of people who end up going on  tons of dates, both attractive and unattractive ones, are people who aren't very picky and want to give everyone a chance.<br>  <br>  You are probably, like myself, quite picky. I'm choosy about which guy I want to go out with, even though I get asked out a lot and I know I am attractive, because I feel like I don't want to go on dates with guys I already know beforehand I won't be interested in. If a sweet, good looking and Christian guy (I want him to share the same beliefs as me :) asked me out I'd be all for it. Trust me, it's better to be single and happy than miserable in a relatioship. Those of my friends who are constantly going from one guy to another are quite often in the midst of a lot of drama. They break up, get their heartbroken, go on rebound, and it all happens over and over again. This doesn't happen in all cases though....so you have to be ready when a it seems there is a great guy knocking at your door.<br>  <br>  And remember, you can also initiate dates. If you see a person you are interested in, you can always go ask them out. If you wait around too long, you might find yourself alone.<br>  <br>  Goodluck :) And I'm sure you are a beautiful person inside and out so it will all go well, just be confident in yourself!|`|dj00wdjKaa	1. for every ugly person there is another ugly person and they both complete themselves in happy ugliness. he he he. What I mean is that if your just ordinary looking there are so many ordinary looking people out there to date. It's just a matter of not being picky, as someone here pointed out.<br>  <br>  2. Ugly people spend a lot of time thinking of other things beside their appearance and popularity. Actually many are really beautiful people in need of makeovers. So they are much more interesting to talk to. Some very beautiful people don't get dates because chatting with them is just such a pain. <br>  <br>  3. I'm not saying that all gorgeous people are dumb. I've seen many gorgeous single people who are increadibly intelectual. But I take into account that very gorgeous people are intimidating. I have many  friends who don't ask gorgeous people out because they think they are out of their league (and they aren't). <br>  <br>  4. If being gorgeous alone were the problem Gisele Bundchen wouldn't ever have gotten married. Most cases I've seen the problem with many single people not getting a date is their personality. If you feel that you draw people away, may be there's a problem in that area. But you can also have an amazing personality and be single, cause you'll drive away all the "bad elements" and sooner or later the right guy will, lets say, "pick up your vibe" and wanna be with you. When that happens (and it usually takes some time), you'll not only get yourself the perfect date, but a long lasting relationship. ;-)<br>  <br>  5. And finally there are those who get lots of dates because they can't settle into a happy relationship. Those you shouldn't really envy.|`|9RYHLTPoaa	Well with a good personality it shows in a person's swagger!

Im not cocky, actually very modest, but I don't think I am unattractive and I am pretty confident which most people find attractive... so what the HELL is the problem!? Someone date me.

That has nothing to do with looks OR personality, it simply means there easy. It's a one night stand that just happens to start out with dinner and a movie. It's someone taking out someone else cause they haven't had any in a long time and it's a sure thing. <br>  <br>  Now if we ARE talking actual relationships then the thing to realize is it has a lot to do with situations. maybe the have something in common that they can't talk to anyone else about and that person is there for them. maybe that person makes them feel special in a way no one else has, maybe that person has a God complex and the other needs a lot of help. Or maybe the person just happens to be attracted to things very different then the average person and finds that person beautiful inside and out.

You are drawn to someone first because of appearance. It's not whether you are beautiful or handsome, but how you present yourself. Then it's up to you to do the rest. Looks will take you only so far. People like to be with other people who are upbeat and friendly. No one wants to be with a depressed person on a date. I don't think that pretending to be sad or sorry for yourself is the answer. Everyone doesn't just find someone over night. It may take years. You do sound like you are a bit down on yourself, and that just doesn't help at all. Look how many people have found their life partners, and then take a second look and see how many you think are beautiful.  Don't you know people who just knock you over with their great personality? I sure do.|`|LrVzkhl4aa	Wow, what a question.

65QqZBnjaa	As another poster said therapy is a part of the process.  You can't transition without therapy.  Oh you can bind and pack and maybe even pass a la Billy Tipton, but your body will never be right and neither will your legal status.

The serious answer is that there nothing easy or inexpensive about being transgender whether you transition or not. My understanding is that the bottom surgery isn't that acceptable anyway. I've heard that some transmen that are large double bind but im not sure what method they use. Top surgery is also quite common. One of the best  things you can do is to get on testosterone. The effects are quite good on transmen. You will bulk up, voice will deepen, and grow hair everywhere. Theres nothing more effective to passing as male as a dark voice and facial hair. Try to find a local transgender group. They often have contacts and can help with discounts on therapy and such.|`|XukScWE3aa	There are a good web sights on this.

The therapy is to make sure you can live life as the other sex and that you really, truly, want the surgery - no reputable transgender surgeon will operate until they get the all-clear from your therapist.<br>  <br>  There is no "cheap" involved in this - the therapy is expensive, the hormone treatments are expensive, the surgery is EXTREMELY expensive, and getting your name changed is expensive.<br>  <br>  It's a long, hard road, but if you truly feel it, then hang in there and good luck.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you're just looking to look like a boy, I've seen girls that bind their breasts, get male haircuts and dress in male clothes.

As a rule, Freemasons are not supposed to just go up to you and extend an invite.  All you need do is ask one, and he will recommend you.  Of course, you also need to fill out a membership application.  Furthermore, Masons do NOT worship the sun or sacrifice children.  They are not satanic.  They are primarily Judeo-Christian, however, there are Islamic lodges.  It depends on what the dominant faith of the lodge is.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, GOD is at the center of EVERY Mason's life.  The main requirement to be a Mason is believing in God.  Finally, the brotherhood is a society with secrets, NOT a secret society.  There is nothing in Masonic teaching that cannot be found on the internet.  I would not recommend researching the internet as it will ruin the joy of going through the degrees in the Blue Lodge.  However, I will recommend that you pick up the book "The Complete Idiots Guide to Freemasonry" or "Freemasonry for Dummies".  I have both of these books and they gave me a great overview of the fraternity prior to my membership.<br>  <br>  That being said, if you want to join the fraternity, you are welcome to do so!
TeailU2iaa	I agree with what you say, because of people like those the world is going through recession.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	"Rich" is highly subjective. I know some people may look at me and my family and say we're "rich". We're not. We're just hard workers and very good at making, and saving and investing, money. I'll admit we're better off than most, but we also realize this and help where we can. Every last healthy member of my family is personally involved in some  sort of charity work - both financially and in a "hands on" kind of way. Personally, I do volunteer homeless outreach and advocacy. <br>  <br>  I'm not a greedy person, I just believe very strongly in living up to my potential in all areas of my life. This means I work hard and make very good money. I've heard people who make far less than I do whine and complain about Obama's tax hikes on the upper classes. They won't be impacted at all - they don't make enough. Yet they whine and scream and throw tantrums like spoiled, rotten little children. Those tax hikes *will* effect me, but my loyalty and dedication to my adopted country and the people in it means that I'm willing to take a bit of a hit to provide for those less fortunate. Even the ones kicking and screaming about me being taxed at a slightly higher rate to help THEM.  A slightly higher tax rate isn't going to hurt me one bit because I don't over-extend myself. If I can't afford to pay cash for  something - I don't buy it.  (With the notable exception of my house, of course.)<br>  <br>  I think part of it has to do with my home country and our values. We believe very strongly every member of our society should be cared for and have access to medical care, food and housing. We cannot conceive of the reasoning behind letting  your own people suffer. It's absolutely barbaric. The US will get to the point where they realize it's cheaper to provide for and educate her citizens in the long run some day, but the greedy people and the selfish and the outright mean will fight it tooth and nail. They'll also scream about "socialism"  even though I've never heard one define it correctly. The people who scream the loudest about any type of change seem to be the most ignorant and  least educated. Not all of them, of course. Just most of them. Yet another reason why education is just as important as affordable housing, preventative medical care and food. Keeps the stupid from spreading so much.|`|NiRFYhVDaa	real rich people are envied, but those who got rich because of corruptions or taking advantage of people that you hate....some people are really poor that needs help some are just plain lazy and expect help from those who can afford....different situations different types of people|`|yOBkli58aa	I not sure what you mean but i don't think people hate the rich.

H5iVq0fwaa	there is no such thing as the laughing buddha in fengshui. fengshui deals with concepts or methods that are used to know where the good energy and bad energy in the house, so you can use these accordingly to improve life. it is mostly about using these methods to analyze space and energy. it is not about using statues. most of the time, the people who sells you these things are often saying whatever you like to hear for you to buy these things. put it this way, when you use the spaces in your house with good energy, then good things happen in your life. you dont need these statues to improve it in any other way, because it will not improve anymore. i like to emphasize that fengshui by using these methods like flying stars, 8 mansions, etc are more powerful than using statues.|`|3CXfqxcgaa	I wouldn't take any notice of that.

My Bachelor's Degree has a dual major Mathematics and Education with a Physics Minor.  I believe that I am a scientist yet I believe in GOD and have my own reasons which are not important here.  I personally see true scientists as people who examine a question and continue to be open to all possibilities similar to an "agnostic" point of view until they are convinced of the "truth".  That truth can always change and they continually examine evidence throughout the remainders of their scientific career.  I always read and study material to the contrary but feel that I have found the TRUTH in GOD'S WORD at this time.  I do not ignore what anyone has to say no matter how trivial some feel their beliefs are.  I also do not try to convince them to change their beliefs to match mine.

If you read a 50-year-old science text, you will wet yourself laughing at the number of things stated as proven fact - the "assured results of scientific inquiry," which have now been proven untrue by modern science.<br>   <br>  Central to science is observation and measurement, activities that can only be performed in the present. Events of the past lie ‘beyond’ the ability of scientists to observe, so all statements about what happened in the past, including geological interpretations, rely on assumption and opinion. <br>  <br>  Science holds no threat to Christianity and Christianity should not be an enemy of good science which is science that is impartial, unbiased and goes wherever the evidence happens to lead.|`|KNKLAmuNaa	Some will try and come up with counter-evidence.

In fact, the more scientists study the cosmos the more they conclude that there is a higher power at work. Religion is created by man to explain the unexplainable.

5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	Heaven for the Christian will be a place of glorious life that will never end. Joy inexpressible, limitless peace, pure love, beauty beyond description—that's what heaven is. Greatest of all will be the presence of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit, with whom we will enjoy fellowship forever. Loved ones who have known and loved the Lord will be there. Revelation 21:2 says, "And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband." <br>  Heaven will be a place in which its inhabitants will be freed from the fears and insecurities that plague and haunt us in the present life. No energy crisis there ... Free from the economic and financial pressures that burden us down here. Free from the fear of personal and physical harm ... No fear of personal failure ... Our relationship with Him will be intimate and direct. I'm looking forward to that glorious day of going to heaven. <br>  Heaven will be what we have always longed for. It will be the new social order that men dream of. All the things that have made earth unlovely and tragic will be absent in heaven. There will be no night, no death, no disease, no sorrow, no tears, no ignorance, no disappointment, no war. It will be filled with happiness, worship, love, and perfection.<br>  Heaven will be a place to challenge the creative genius of the unfettered mind of redeemed man." Revelation 21:4 says, "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away." <br>  <br>  However, the Bible makes clear that there is only one way to heaven, and that is through repentance from sin and faith in Jesus Christ who said, "I am the way ..." (John 14:6). Jesus paid for our sins through His death on the cross. God offers us the free gift of friendship with Him in this life and eternal life in heaven when we die if we will but turn from sin and trust in Jesus as our Savior and Lord.

Eve saw “that the fruit was good to eat” and she ate of it in all her innocence! Eve had no “Guardian Angel” to advice her of anything wrong. She must have thought that God was wrong again like when he created man alone!  She honestly didn’t know that God set her up to fall, either! Her fall was planned BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD! (1 Peter 1:19-20)<br>  <br>  The Bible writers say that as soon as God created the angels almost half of them were not one bit impressed with God’s Beauty and Holiness and 1/3 of them rebelled against God ON FREE WILL and on the spot! The highest ranking angel ever created was LUCIFER* (*Light Bearer) which is another of God’s goofs! He must have thought highly of Lucifer! If God were my employee I would question his competence! God also created Eve only as an afterthought! And so Eve ate from the forbidden fruit for about the same reason we eat any fruit! She had no way of knowing that Satan (aka Lucifer, aka The Old Serpent) was EVIL! Any honest Christian with a reasonable IQ can tell you that the Bible God set up Eve to eat the forbidden fruit  and in the process NO GUARDIAN ANGEL WAS IN SIGHT TO PROTECT THE BULK OF HUMANITY FROM GOING TO HELL…!!!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers created an original God different from any other primitive God. The angels that rebelled against him were not evicted from Heaven! They became known as demons. God is in desperate need of them to justify sending “the world” that he loves so much to be tormented in Hell for ever and ever! According to the Bible writers the demons and Satan will be evicted from Heaven during the “Tribulation of the last days” (Rev. 12:9-10)! Nothing really makes sense in the Bible unless you have plenty of faith (gullibility) to swallow anything that the preachers tell you! Christianity is a big business banking on people’s gullibility! <br>  <br>  Back in the Garden of Eden God set up a “flaming sword moving back and forth” to protect the “Tree of Life” so no matter how much “free will” Adam and Eve had they couldn’t eat of it and live for ever! God also PREVENTED anybody from killing Cain. God could have done something similar to protect Eve and the bulk of the human race from going to Hell unless he was determined to create human beings only to torture them with fire and sulfur for ever and ever for his wanking pleasure. Christianity is as Heathen and barbaric as you can’t possibly imagine!<br>  <br>  God personally intervened and PREVENTED that the Heathen King Abimelech had sex with Abraham’s sister/wife/hooker Sarah so he “wouldn't SIN against God"! God himself NOT A GUARDIAN ANGEL, BUT GOD HIMSELF was present in this King’s Royal Bedroom to PREVENT a questionable sexual activity that he might have enjoyed with Sarah! BTW, Abimelech means “my Dad is the God Moloch” --not related to any Bible God. But neither the Bible God in all his bragging of “omnipresence” nor a Guardian Angel was anywhere to be seen near Eve or the untouchable fruit tree to prevent that the WHOLE HUMAN RACE that God loves so much end up tormented in a sulfuric burning Lake of Fire! It doesn’t take too many neurons in anybody’s brain to figure out that the Bible writers were a bunch of wanking perverts creating a God so full of Holy Crap! It takes years of Christian schooling to keep Christianity still marketable today! The top Clergy is fully aware of all the Holy Crap that they peddle! They call it difficult doctrines in need of a new Bible version.<br>   <br>  Genesis 20:2-6 …and there Abraham said of his wife Sarah, "She is my sister."* (*incest [inbreeding] was ALLOWED, COMMANDED and ENFORCED all along by God’s Holy Law [Numbers 36:8]!) Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her. But God came to Abimelech IN A DREAM ONE NIGHT* (*only this wanking God knows how many nights he was peeking on him!) and said to him, "You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken; she is a married woman.”* (*It would have been perfectly OK with God if Sarah had no husband! God didn’t question on whether the king was a married man or not! God enjoyed watching King Abimelech perform sexual numbers all along! God declared King Solomon the wisest man “EVER TO SET FOOT ON THIS EARTH”, too maybe because he loved to watch him perform in bed with over 1,000 wives and lovers! By the time God in the person of the Holy Ghost visited the Blessed Virgin Mary in bed he was not a nerd!) Now Abimelech had not gone near her* (*at least that night, but he must have been aware that God was watching him perform all the time because of his lack of surprise!), so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?* (*God and this Heathen king discuss National Security issues in a dream!!! Too bad CNN was not there to interview the king!) Did he not say to me, `She is my sister,' and didn't she also say, `He is my brother'?* (*can you imagine this holy man of God Abraham handing over his horny sister/wife Sarah without any objection for the unrestricted sexual pleasure of this Heathen king? BTW, this illiterate Hebrew shepherd Abraham already pimped his sister the same way before to the king of Egypt and he came out filthy rich out of it! Gen 12) I HAVE DONE THIS WITH A CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND CLEAN HANDS."* (*It is like in the case of EVE, but here Sarah is a “sinful” horny old lady age 90, not an honest person like King Abimelech!) Then God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know you did this with a CLEAR CONSCIENCE* (*so as long as you do it with a clear conscience and clean hands you can’t possibly commit any sexual “sin” against this wanking Bible God!), and so I have kept you from sinning against me. That is why I did not let you touch her.”* (*Hey, what if God would have applied the same protection on Eve, wouldn’t the world be different today? The Bible scholars tell you that God prevented Sarah from enjoying sex with King Abimelech because she was going to be an ancestor of Jesus Christ! Practically all of Jesus’ ancestors are loaded with all sorts of sexual escapades!) <br>   <br>  Compare the Bible writer’s sexual tryst story of King Abimelech and the Holy hooker Sarah to the story of King David and Bathsheba… King David and Bathsheba committed adultery of the kinkiest sort! She was a gorgeous sexy married woman. After Bathsheba was done having sex with King David she was probably drenched in royal sperm so she took a shower to "purify herself and be clean” (2 Sam 11:4). She became pregnant, too with a baby boy while God was delighted watching them perform in bed! No sin here because God planned for Bathsheba to be the ancestor of Jesus Christ through King David, not through her original husband! King David had to have Bathsheba’s husband killed for fear of reprisals! She was so happy to become King David’s favorite wife that she never grieved the death of her husband. God had their baby boy killed in a long and painful death so everybody in Israel can watch him suffer and learn a lesson!  The baby boy was born in adultery and had to be killed! Pregnancies as result of incest or rape are most sacred to the Christians today, but not so babies born in adultery to this Bible God… God hates them and he uses slow painful death tricks to get rid of children like that! <br>  <br>  Later on, Bathsheba mothered King Solomon another ancestor of Jesus Christ! Like in the case of King Abimelech this wanking God enjoyed watching King David performing in bed all along, but he didn’t do a thing to stop King David from having sex with Bathsheba. God didn’t stop King David from killing her husband, either because God loved King David, “a man patterned after God’s own heart”! So as long as you are a Christian you can get away with murder before God, but be aware of the long arm of the SECULAR LAW that supersedes any Law of God!<br>  <br>  The Bible God didn’t hesitate to stop the Hell bound Pagan King Abimelech from having sex with Sarah so he wouldn’t sin in spite of the fact that Sarah was a horny old lady age 90! Old Christian ladies take a cue that age is not a restriction as far as enjoying good sex goes! Later on God didn’t stop King David from having sex with Bathsheba and killing her husband! In the case of a Heathen King God feels that sex is wrong and it has to be prevented, but with King David sex and murder is OK… it is all within “God’s plan of salvation.”<br>  <br>  In due course God was “pleased” to send his ONLY BEGOTTEN SON to be totally beaten, tenderized and thoroughly marinated in Roman soldier spit so he can be nailed totally naked to the Holy Cross as a “worthy lamb of God taking away the sins of the world”. BTW, the Roman soldiers never dressed the genital area of their victims with a white diaper! Now Christians need to snack Jesus spit flavored Meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Holy Communion so they can go to Heaven when they die. Jesus was terrified about dying on the Holy Cross! He was sweating blood praying “to pass the cup!” He must have asked his Sadistic Heavenly Father, “Hey Dad, wouldn’t have been much easier to stop Eve from eating the forbidden fruit?”<br>  <br>  Christians are brainwashed to believe that the Bible doesn’t mean what it says and that it can’t be taken literally (short of seriously)! Isn’t it ridiculous to live in a Country that chose to be a Nation under this peeping-tom wanking GOD? Christianity is about the most immoral religion in the world today, second only to Islam!|`|naI5hGjHaa	you answered your own question but i agree.|`|W9uEeFFsaa	no

Things like this are the reason I tend not to get too friendly with coworkers.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	You are very right, she was not professional in her response to this situation.  However, your new employer should not have told her who they were and what they were calling about.  When they did, it opened the door for her to comment to this situation.<br>  <br>  I think she may be resentful that you are moving on.  She likes the fact that the two of you got along and you were pleasant to work with.  She knows she is going to miss you.<br>  <br>  I would forgive her and move on.  The old phrase, "no harm, no foul" definitely applies here.  The only thing that is hurt is your feelings.  <br>  <br>  Why don't you resolve this by inviting her out for lunch or dinner.  Tell her about the new job and what she can expect from your experience.  Are you going to work at both jobs?  Share your pregnancy news with her.  <br>  <br>  This is a transition phase for her too.  A lot of people have trouble when changes come into their lives. <br>  <br>  I hope you enjoy your new job, and good luck with your new baby.

czXaUPIlaa	"Buddhism: Plain and Simple" is an excellent introductory book written by a skilled teacher. <br>  <br>  Being aware of the present simply means to be aware of what's happening in your mind - the impulses, intentions, thoughts, feelings, etc. - at any given moment. When you are planning for the future, be aware of that. When you are calculating a tip in a restaurant, be aware of it. When you are fighting we a friend, be aware of what's behind the fight. When you are depressed, be aware of the depression and what might be behind the feelings. <br>  <br>  As we practice this "awareness" we go deeper and deeper into the unseen aspects of ourselves that control our behavior. This work provides the basis for liberation.<br>  <br>  Yes, "Buddhism" is a conception. The Buddha didn't teach Buddhism, he taught what he called "shiksha" - a 'system of training.' <br>  <br>  We can engage in any activity without "believing" in it - where 'believing' means that we identify with it completely, where it occupies a position of *truth.*<br>  <br>  This is an important point, because we have a natural tendency toward fixed views - that our "self" is fixed, that our relationships are fixed in certain ways, etc. These views are also conceptions - not the truth.<br>  <br>  When Hagen speaks of following what can be "seen" for oneself, he is referring to conscious awareness of the truth of our lives. This truth can only be seen when we're aware of the present (see above). With this awareness, we will see that the self is not fixed (actually, it's not anything at all), that everything always changes, and that human ideas and schemes like social sciences are interesting, but not the truth.<br>  <br>  Great questions, thanks!|`|AA11142708	Hi. Buddhist practice is a way of life. You are not being asked to sit under a tree until enlightenment--that's why it's called the path of the middle way. Start from where you are already (you have already begun--good) and try to implement the material that sounds good to you into your life. Meditation is the practice of bringing your mind back to meditation when it wanders (that's all it is in the beginning). You will get better at it. The meaning of "living in the present is" means, basically, the same thing. It does not mean for you to ignore the past or future. If, anything, living in the present is asking you to evaluate the value of your expectations and if they are inconsistent with the Buddhist practices that you have already begun to practice then you might want to change your behavior somewhat in thought, word, and deed. Buddhist practice is also about (as stated in #2) experiencing immediacy--the stuff that matters is the stuff of immediate experience, but, again, that does not mean that you ignore the social sciences, or gravity, or a the fact that Buddhist practice can be understood conceptually but, if understood conceptually, that understanding will bring you back to "living in the moment." I hope this helps. Thanks for the question.|`|RRJFI9Oqaa	If we are still a layman (not monks) when we practice Buddhism, we are leading a double life. Worldly life and Practitioner life. If we are engaging in day to day affairs, we have to do as what ordinary people do. During practising periods, we just watch what is going through our mind. You can call this staying with present.<br>  Only when we leave worldly life, we can stay present all the time.

ljzb6fZBaa	The apostle Paul corrected the Corinthians by reminding them who they are in Christ. He gave them revelations that they have a high calling in Christ. "Do you not know that we shall judge angels?" (1 Corinthians 6:3) Right believing produces right living.<br>  <br>  Similarly, Paul reminded them that their bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit. (1 Corinthians 6:19) Paul didn't condemn them. He didn't tell them to confess their sins. He didn't say that they would lose their salvation. Paul still treated them as if they are still right with God. He knew the importance of renewing their minds with the gospel of grace - true repentance is "change your mind and believe the good news that Jesus has become your Righteousness". Repentance is not remorse nor penance nor grovelling in the dust.<br>  <br>  Some churches do not understand the gospel of grace. They did not have a revelation of Jesus' finished work at the cross. They tried to correct behaviour by preaching law, but "the strength of sin is the law". (1 Corinthians 15:56) The more people try to keep the law, the more the works of the flesh will be manifested, and more sins result in the church.<br>  <br>  What churches need today is the gospel of grace. It is the revelation of our new identity in Christ. When we realise we are the righteousness of God in Christ, and our bodies are the temples of the Holy Spirit, we will live according to our new identity. We will walk in true holiness, because holiness is a Person - His name is Jesus Christ. What we do comes out of who we are in Christ. Even when we fail here and then, our identity in Christ never changes. We continue to believe we are still the righteousness of God in Christ, and there is no condemnation for us in Christ. When we confess we are righteous in Christ, we will receive God's power to reign in life as kings over sin and death, over sickness and disease, over lack and unclean habits, over Satan and adversity, through the One, Jesus Christ. :) (Romans 5:17)<br>  <br>  Thanks for the important question, sister Grace.

(Ro 12:1) This requires the use of reason and the maintaining of the body with food and other necessities, as well as physical cleanliness, but other types of care are even more important. These involve spirituality, seeking God’s Kingdom and his righteousness, and practicing moral uprightness. (Mt 6:25, 31-33; Col 2:20-23; 3:5) The apostle counsels: “Bodily training is beneficial for a little; but godly devotion is beneficial for all things, as it holds promise of the life now and that which is to come.”—1Ti 4:8.<br>  One who is an anointed member of the Christian congregation, the body of Christ, and who commits fornication is taking a member of the Christ away and making that one a member of a harlot. Any such Christian committing fornication is bringing in moral defilement and is also “sinning against his own [fleshly] body.” He is putting himself in peril of being removed from the body of Christ, the temple organization, and is exposing himself to the danger of loathsome diseases.<br>  <br>  (at 1 Corinthians 6:2) <br>  Jesus also told his apostles that when he would sit down on his throne in the “re-creation,” they would “sit upon twelve thrones” to do judging. (Mt 19:28; Lu 22:28-30) Paul indicated that Christians who had been “called to be holy ones” will judge the world. (1Co 1:2; 6:2) Also, the apostle John saw in vision the time when some received “power of judging.” (Re 20:4) In view of the above texts, this evidently includes the apostles and the other holy ones. Such a conclusion is borne out by the remainder of the verse, which speaks of those who rule with Christ for the Millennium. These then will be royal judges with Jesus.|`|AA11232725	Paul, just like all Christian Pastors, had to walk a fine line between encouraging and exhorting and warning the people whom he was over in the Lord. Paul was not out to "condemn" anyone, but rather to teach them what they needed to know so that the Lord would not condemn them on judgment day.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:9  Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites,  10  nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.  11  And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 11:17  Now in giving these instructions I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse.  18  For first of all, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.  19  For there must also be factions among you, that those who are approved may be recognized among you.  <br>  <br>  20  Therefore when you come together in one place, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.  21  For in eating, each one takes his own supper ahead of others; and one is hungry and another is drunk.  22  What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you in this? I do not praise you.  <br>  <br>  23  For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread;  24  and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, "Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me."  25  In the same manner  He also took the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in My blood. This do, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me."  26  For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death till He comes.  <br>  <br>  27  Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.  28  But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.  29  For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.  30  For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep.  31  For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged.|`|IHIiyyCTaa	The Apostle Paul has never condemned the Church, his calling was to promote the Church throughout the known world of his time...But he did scrold and rebuke certain members of the Church...
vhlORK4Waa	Old English had both plural and singular second person pronouns. By Late Middle English, the singular, second person pronoun had evolved into thee and thou, while the plural, second person had evolved into you and ye (Lass, CHEL, V.II, 117). The story of the loss of thee and thou and its replacement with you in Modern English is not an entirely clear one (Lass, CHEL, V.III, 148); through various hypothesis and educated guesses, we can piece together some ideas about what might have caused this loss.<br>  <br>  By the thirteenth century, you was sometimes replacing both thee (used in the object position) and thou (used in the subject position) (Blake, 536) among the upper classes. It might at first appear that these pronouns were being used interchangeably and at random but closer inspection reveals a probable semantic distinction between the two pronouns. Many scholars suspect that the English were trying to create in English a form of second person address similar to that of the French T-V system (Walker, 75). In this system, vous was used not only as a plural pronoun but also as a singular pronoun as a sign of respect when addressing one’s superiors and equals, while tu was used to address social inferiors as well as those with whom the speaker (or writer) shared some intimacy. It is generally thought that, initially, you was used in English similarly to vous in French, while thee/thou was used similarly to the French tu. (Some speculate that the use of you in the second person singular may have begun as a result of the "plural of majesty" [Blake, 536] but this opinion does not appear to be widely held.)<br>  <br>  However, it appears that, by the time of Early Modern English, or perhaps even Late Middle English, you became the neutral or unmarked second person singular pronoun while thee/thou was marked, at least among the upper classes. The two pronouns no longer functioned as a strict T-V system, if, indeed, they ever had. There is some discussion amongst scholars about exactly what was marked by the use of thee/thou. Roger Lass suggests that, among the upper classes, thee/thou was used to mark "asymmetrical... status relations... and... as a general indicator of heightened emotional tone, intimacy, etc." (149). By the seventeenth century, thee/thou seems to have been used most often to denote either "intimacy (if used reciprocally) or contempt (non-reciprocally)" (Lass, CHEL, V.III, 149) and the connotations of choosing thee/thou over you seem to have had a less direct correlation to social status.<br>  <br>  Many of the conclusions drawn about the distinction between thee/thou and you are drawn from a careful study of literature from the various periods in question, most notably Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Chaucer, Malory, and Shakespeare. Through observations of context (social status of the character speaking, tone of a situation, levels of intimacy, emotional qualities, etc.) in which the authors chose to use the marked instead of the unmarked second person pronoun, scholars are able to make some generalizations about the semantic differences between thee/thou and you. However, there are some problems with this method of studying the thee/thou, you distinction. <br>  <br>  Firstly, the form of a particular genre may typically call for one or the other pronoun. For example, courtly romances generally used you throughout (Blake, 539) while Elizabethan sonnets tended to lend themselves to the use of thee/thou (Busse, 134). While some of these formal variations may be attributable to the differences in tone in various genres, it’s not safe to assume that they are. For example, one might expect Shakespeare to have used more T forms in his comedies, with their lower class characters, but this does not prove to be the case, though some other authors, such as John Lyly, in his play Alexander and Campaspe, does chose to have his lower class characters use thee/thou (Walker, 378).<br>  <br>  We must also remember that literary works may not accurately reflect how language was actually used during any given period; this is especially true of language as it was spoken. Many artistic and individual considerations may have affected authors’ word and syntactical choices. Even if they were attempting to portray casual or spoken language in an authentic way in their work, they may not have been skilled enough to do so. In addition, until relatively recently, those who were literate were those within a limited elite within a society. Their writing may accurately reflect upper class usage but may not accurately reflect those of the lower classes. <br>  <br>  By the eighteenth century, thee/thou had been almost completely supplanted by you and "is not really a living option in ordinary usage... by the middle of the eighteenth century you was the only normal spoken form" (Lass, CHEL, V.III, 153). Yet thee/thou did survive in a few specific situations. Some poets continued to use thee/thou, perhaps as an attempt to emulate the language of the Elizabethan and Jacobean poets (ibid.). Even the quickest perusal of The Norton Anthology of English Literature reveals that poets such as Tennyson were using thee/thou at least until into the 1860’s. <br>  <br>  In addition, many Christian denominations continued to use thee/thou in prayer. This may be because of the respect accorded to the translation of the Bible authorized by King James, and the fact that, in many churches, hymns which used thee/thou were still sung. These two facts may account for the fact that some continued to associate the use of thee/thou (as well as, for example, the th verbal ending) with the treatment of spiritual and religious topics.
AA10521224	Good question.<br>  1. Yes, this sin is mentioned in Quran and Allah accepted Adam's repenting from this sin and forgave him.<br>  NB: I don't know of any source in Islam blaming Eve or accusing her as being the responsible for the sin she and Adam committed. <br>  Allah says in Quran:<br>  “Then Shaytaan (Satan) whispered to him, saying : ‘O Adam! Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that will never waste away?’<br>  Then they both ate of the tree, and so their private parts became manifest to them, and they began to cover themselves with the leaves of the Paradise for their covering. Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray”<br>  [Ta-Ha 20:120-121 – interpretation of the meaning]  <br>  <br>  Allah says in Quran:<br>  “Then Adam received from his Lord Words. And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful”<br>  [al-Baqarah 2:37 – interpretation of the meaning]  <br>  <br>  2. We Muslims believe that a person is born with no sins. Every Muslim is only responsible for his own committed sins.<br>  <br>  Allah knows best.|`|zAfKvhW4aa	This is a very smart intelligent question, Thank you.<br>  <br>  I will try to make this as short as I can, sorry if it does not seem so.<br>  <br>  Islam aknowledges the first sin of Adam and Eve simply as the sin of Adam and Eve in specific. <br>  <br>  Meaning, they had to bear the consequences of their sin, and they repented from such sin, and GOD did forgive them as he is all MERCIFUL. <br>  <br>  Islam does not hold us or ANY one accountable for the sin of any one else. A common verse in the Torah, Bible and Quran is, "No one shall bear the burden of the burden of another" is taken literal in Islam.  In addition, Islam teaches that BOTH adam and eve sinned, and not only eve as believed by some denominations.<br>  <br>  Same concept with Jesus who supposably died on the cross for the sins of HUMANITY, wow! That would be a huge burden. Why would GOD blame another man for the sins of others?<br>  <br>  29. He it is Who created for you all that is on earth. Then He Istawa (rose over) towards the heaven and made them seven heavens and He is the All-Knower of everything. <br>   <br>  30. And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: "Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth." They said: "Will You place therein those who will make mischief therein and shed blood, - while we glorify You with praises and thanks (Exalted be You above all that they associate with You as partners) and sanctify You." He (Allah) said: "I know that which you do not know."  <br>  <br>  31. And He taught Adam all the names (of everything) [9], then He showed them to the angels and said, "Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful." <br>   <br>  32. They (angels) said: "Glory be to You, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily, it is You, the All-Knower, the All-Wise."  <br>  <br>  33.  He said: "O Adam! Inform them of their names," and when he had informed them of their names, He said: "Did I not tell you that I know the Ghaib (unseen) in the heavens and the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you have been concealing?"  <br>  <br>  34. And (remember) when We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves before Adam.". And they prostrated except Ibl?s (Satan), he refused and was proud and was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah).  <br>  <br>  35. And We said: "O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the Zalim?n (wrong-doers)." <br>   <br>  36. Then the Shaitan (Satan) made them slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them out from that in which they were. We said: "Get you down, all, with enmity between yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place for you and an enjoyment for a time."  <br>  <br>  37. Then Adam received from his Lord Words [10]. And his Lord pardoned him (accepted his repentance). Verily, He is the One Who forgives (accepts repentance), the Most Merciful. <br>   <br>  38. We said: "Get down all of you from this place (the Paradise), then whenever there comes to you Guidance from Me, and whoever follows My Guidance, there shall be no fear on them, nor shall they grieve.  <br>  <br>  39.  But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) such are the dwellers of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever. <br>  <br>  The Quran, chapter The Cow verse 29-39<br>  <br>  <a href="http://muttaqun.com/quran/e/" rel="nofollow">http://muttaqun.com/quran/e/</a>  <br>  <br>  and below:|`|0gNKRdmiaa	Islam teaches about Adam and Eve, but there are important differences in the Islamic account compared to the Biblical account.<br>  <br>  In Islam, Eve is not blamed for seducing Adam to eat from the tree and there is no mention of her being punished with pain in childbirth.  In the Quran, Satan tempts both Adam and Eve and they both disobey God.  It is an essential teaching of Islam that noone can be punished for the sin of another.  Adam and Eve both repented to God for their mistake and God forgave them.  There is no question of sin being inherited.  Each baby is born completely pure and free of sin.

That is the only true teaching when the words "bridegroom" and "bride" are capitalized in such a fashion as to be used for titles. <br>  <br>  However, when not capitalized, it simply refers to any man (bridegroom) and woman (bride) being united in holy matrimony.|`|Of0H9i4Vaa	The ten virgins (Mt 25:1-13). This illustration concerning “the kingdom of the heavens” is part of Jesus’ reply to the question of his disciples recorded in Matthew 24:3. The purpose of the illustration is plainly shown in Matthew 25:13.<br>  In those days an important feature of the marriage ceremony was the solemn bringing of the bride from her father’s home to the home of her bridegroom or the bridegroom’s father. The bridegroom, arrayed in his best attire, would leave his house in the evening for the home of the bride’s parents, escorted by his friends. From there, accompanied by musicians and singers and usually by persons bearing lamps, the procession moved toward the home of the bridegroom. The people along the route would take great interest in the procession; some would join it, particularly maids bearing lamps. (Jer 7:34; 16:9; Isa 62:5) The procession might be delayed until late, as there was no particular haste, so that some waiting along the way might get drowsy and fall asleep. The singing and exultation would be heard quite a distance ahead, those hearing it making the cry: “Here is the bridegroom!” Then, after the bridegroom and his entourage had gone into the house and closed the door, it was too late for tardy guests to enter. The lamps carried in the procession burned oil and required frequent refilling.<br>  Jesus is the Bridegroom<br>  Jehovah is the bridegroom’s father<br>  The Bride......Eliezer’s name means “My God Is Helper.” In name and deed, he fittingly pictures the holy spirit of the Greater Abraham, Jehovah God, which He sent to this distant land, our earth, to select a suitable bride for the Greater Isaac, Jesus Christ. (John 14:26; 15:26) The bride class is “the congregation,” made up of disciples of Jesus who have been begotten by holy spirit as spiritual sons of God. (Ephesians 5:25-27; Romans 8:15-17) Just as Rebekah received expensive gifts, so the initial members of the Christian congregation on the day of Pentecost 33?C.E. received miraculous gifts in proof of their divine calling. (Acts 2:1-4) Like Rebekah, they have willingly forsaken all worldly and fleshly relationships in order eventually to be united with their heavenly Bridegroom. From the time individual members of the bride class are called until their death, they must guard their spiritual virginity while journeying through Satan’s dangerous, seductive world. (John 15:18,?19; 2?Corinthians 11:3; James 4:4) Filled with holy spirit, the bride class faithfully invites others to partake of Jehovah’s provisions for salvation. (Revelation 22:17) Do you follow her example by also responding to the spirit’s direction?<br>  <br>  17 The bride class highly values what is pictured by the ten camels. The number ten is used in the Bible to denote perfection or completeness as related to things on earth. The ten camels may be compared to the complete and perfect Word of God, by means of which the bride class receives spiritual sustenance and spiritual gifts. (John 17:17; Ephesians 1:13,?14; 1?John 2:5) Commenting on Rebekah’s watering of the camels, The Watchtower of November 1, 1948, made this application to the bride class: “They lovingly consider the Word of God which bears much of his spirit to them. They take an interest in his written Word, serving it and freshening it up by attending upon it and displaying a sincere concern for its message and purpose, seeking to believe it.” As an example of this, the remnant of the bride class has lovingly made available to millions the fresh, up-to-date New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures. Whether this fine translation is available in your language or not, do you show appreciation by regularly examining the Bible along with study aids provided by the bride class?—2?Timothy 3:16.|`|PBNPWPbVaa	No but here's the false teaching about marriage:It lasts forever.|`|54hVzylRaa	There is only one religion that can explain who they really are.

6UeGyxNcaa	well, ACCORDING to there "holy" bible" you WILL burn in hell forever. But don't worry,  I am supposedly supposed to join you as well. I'm an atheist, but I don't care what some crazy book says. If I wrote a big that said "YOu must believe in flying hot dogs or you shall be eaten by a unicorn!"  Honestly, what I just said is NOT much different from other religions. SO basically, yes the Bible says you will go to hell, but us both being Atheists, we know there is no such thing and we are not fools.|`|AA12165299	if you are perfect without sin...you will go to heaven...otherwise you need Christs redemption to make you perfect to allow you into heaven...what place does sin have in heaven...none...if you choose to reject salvation from sin that is your freewill choice to do so...a belief in God requires nothing but volition...|`|alyr0SB8aa	A lot of people are going to hell according to Christians, funny what seperates people..

Have you ALWAYS listened to your parents and have done exactly what they have said for you to do?   Have you NEVER used God's name in vain?  Even if you don't believe in him?  The point I am making....Is that we all are sinners and have broken most of the 10 commandments at least once in our lives....You will go to hell for not accepting the gift of forgiveness from God....and hell is for eternity....|`|VmqOq8Qjaa	yep because you don't believe in their god...

All beings have the pure mind of the Buddhas but don't see it!"  (there are many translations, and I couldn't find one just now so I paraphrased)  Basicly, Buddhism says we are pure but have covered it over, probably by identifying with our awareness of this imperfectly evolved body with its desires and weaknesses. If we can see our innermost nature, "Buddha-nature", "original face", etc., then we will still have the same body with its wants and discomforts, but won't think that is "us", and so will not suffer.  <br>  <br>  Incidentally, the royal "we" is used by royalty to refer to themself.  Maybe you mean the nurse or waiter "we" which means "you"?  (as in "Have we decided on beverages yet?" or "are we ready for desert?  Today?

ljzb6fZBaa	Bearing in mind that Jesus told this parable to the Pharisees who looked down on the "sinners" (in their eyes), the focus is on redemption of the lost son, as Spdcp said. Granted that God hates sin, and all have sinned and fallen short of His glory, God's grace is greater than sin - "where sin increased, grace much more abounded." (Romans 5:20) When we behold our faults, it only leads to a downward spiral of depression. We need to be Christ occupied, not self occupied. When we behold the Lord's glory, we are being transformed from glory to glory into His same image, by the Holy Spirit. (2 Corinthians 5:21) <br>  <br>  All glory to Jesus Christ and what He has done at the cross. The message of the cross is the power of God unto salvation - making us whole in every way. Satan has been defeated at the cross. Grace is greater than sin, just as Jesus is greater than the devil. The more we lift up the name of Jesus, the more we experience the manifestation of His victory in our lives - over sin, temptations, sicknesses, lack, unclean habits, Satan, death - and the more other people are drawn to Him. :)<br>  <br>  Peace be with you, brother.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Because of Repentance and Forgiveness!|`|AA10733606	That story has nothing at all to do with Satan. It is a type of the backsliden christian. That is a person who once had a relationship with Jesus but chose to walk away, then realizing his/her mistake, returned to the family.|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	Er why can't you read it as just an analogy of how God is so loving that even when someone who knows him goes of the rails so the speak he is still waiting there with open arms and total unconditional love and forgiveness to welcome them home. Also don't forget the older brother  was extremely jealous of his brother on his return - this is a classic example of how some Christians have levels of sin and judge others accordingly.  Sin is Sin and by the very fact that someone judges someone else a sin has been committed. To me this is a simple story. and many of us are grateful for it being included in the bible.  It is also a warning to other Christians not to judge the ones that have apparently 'fallen away'.  God always goes looking for those lost sheep - it make take years - but he will find them and bring them home. Sometimes its just better to read it as it says and not bring too much super spiritual stuff into it.  Don't forget Jesus told this parable and he spoke in a way that was straight forward and easy to understand.  he didn't expect people to go looking for any in depth reason - he was just stating the obvious.  Both brothers sinned one by going off on his own - and one being jealous.  In fact the one going off was more open and honest whereas the other who stayed seemed to not only hold a grudge against his brother but also did his work out of duty.  God wants us to do things out of Love not because of duty or a great reward.  Our reward is knowing him - God waits patiently for all to come to him with open arms.Simple as that.|`|FsX5VoXKaa	Actually, the hero of this story isnt the prodigal son, but rather the Father.<br>  <br>  Jesus is the one telling the parable, therefore, we can say that the Father represents God, and sinners represent the prodigal son. <br>  <br>  When the son ran out of money and was feeding the pigs, he didnt think of his father... The Bible says he thought of the food that the servants had to eat! <br>  <br>  Luke 15:17   "And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! "<br>  <br>  He was thinking of his belly! Was he repentant? I doubt so, for if he was it would have been phrased differently..  But I believe all scripture is God ordained and must be taken into context...<br>  <br>  So the son started to scheme and plot, rehearsing to himself what he would tell his father in order to earn some form of forgiveness.<br>  <br>  But unknown to the son, the father has been sitting at the highest place of the house day and night non stop looking out for the son since day 1 hoping for his return... the instant he appeared on the horizon the father lifted up his robes, fully showing his bare legs and sprinted to the son.<br>  <br>  By now the son is smelling of pigs but the father just keeps on smothering him with loving kisses..<br>  <br>  All the son managed to say was "i have sinned-" which is only a part of his rehearsed speech..  the father did not even allow the son to say make me a hired servant.. instantly the ring( authority) and sandals( slaves dont wear shoes.. ) and the best robes (righteousness) were bestowed upon him..  <br>  <br>  <br>  Whats most beautiful is the fattened calf... Notice the father said to the servants, bring the fattened calf and kill it..  not in the kitchen, but where the son can see the death that paid for his sin..  <br>  <br>  The son must see that someone paid for his freedom, authority, righteousness and sonship..   <br>  <br>  I find it interesting that only a few lines are given to write about the boys sin, but a majority of the parable tells about his redemption..<br>  <br>  Thats how we know God... by listening to the word of Christ..|`|Xb0GiTMuaa	It is about a Fathers love for his child, the child's freedom of choice, no matter how unwise it may have been. <br>  A lesson learned the hard way, repentance of the son, forgiveness of the Father.<br>  If you want the other, check out the reaction of the older brother, who was angry with his Father for forgiving his younger brother.|`|CIWd3vJIaa	The prodigal son was rebellious, just like many today.<br>  He did not want to live under the guidance of his father.<br>  Rebellion is considered a sin in the Word of God.<br>  <br>  Living away from the Father means are resources are limited and quickly exhausted.<br>  Living with the guidance of our Father and living in His will, means we will always have abundance in Him.   Not only in physical, material thing, but most important spiritual.|`|r8rykCkGaa	I agree with you.  The prodigal son had an anti-Christ or satanic attitude such as the god of this world has when denying Christ.  The father who welcomed him back was like God the Father who forgave him and loved him.  This is try.  When he was in his darkest hour he came to himself.  This is the way it is, and hope my own grown children who have forsaken the fountain of living waters will also return to reality in Jesus very quickly.<br>  <br>   Yes, all parents who have been heart-broken by their children's behavior will understand about this and rejoice when their children return.

But I don't understand how anyone can live that way.|`|sohnrZDcaa	Let me guess... you are into the Clergy business and are getting material ready for a sermon on "GIVE THE FULL TITHE TO THE LORD"...<br>  <br>  The Bible writers made it clear that CONTROL BY FEAR is deeply rooted in “God’s Plan of Salvation”… So if you think that you got saved GOOD FOR YOU!!! Make sure that you pay your FULL tithe and offering to the Church on time or God the Holy Ghost will zap you on the spot and the Church people will give you a quick Christian BURIAL without notifying anybody in your family. This is the Godly way of “doing” overdue Church account holders after Jesus Christ did away with the gross LAW of his Daddy God in the Old Testament days! Then they were dealing with only one God. In the New Testament we have 2 additional identifiable deities one is a make believe “sweet Jesus” and the other one is God the Holy Ghost! This last one is very touchy and unforgiving about money issues.<br>  <br>  Act 5:9-11 (NIV) Peter said to her, “How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord* (*alias “The Comforter”, alias “The Helper”, alias “The Paraklete” by not paying the FULL tithe and offering to the Church!)? Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door* (*in a truly Christian funeral nobody in the Church notifies anybody the death event to any spouse or relative! Have you noticed how cold bloody is Saint Peter about tithing?! God won’t allow him to do any counseling on money issues!) and they will carry you out also.” At that moment SHE FELL DOWN AT HIS FEET AND DIED* (*Praise the LORD! Sweet Jesus! The Bible writers say that Saint Peter expected that the Ghost of God was going to slaughter her on the spot “at his feet”! Just like her husband was Divinely slaughtered a few moments earlier! The lady died without knowing that the Ghost of God killed her husband the same way! In his Popish authority Saint Peter made no intercession whatsoever for any of them! That ought to teach everybody a big lesson to get serious about giving to the Church and how truly Christian funerals are conducted!). Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband (Praise the LORD! That ought to teach moron Christians a big lesson on giving to the Church!). GREAT FEAR SEIZED THE WHOLE CHURCH AND ALL WHO HEARD ABOUT THESE EVENTS* (*Holy solution! There is nothing like a Holy Mafia option to keep Christians paying their dues to the Church on time and IN FULL!).<br>  <br>  It works all the time! Just have somebody slaughtered in the primitive Church and the rest will learn AND FEAR! It is the wanking Bible writer way to teach anybody a lesson! What if Ananias and Sapphira had children at home? Who cares? No Bible College student would dare to ask this question to their “God sent” teachers of the “Word”! Too bad the CNN or even FOX News was not there to report…! Not even the Mafia operates like that! You don’t need too many neurons in your brain to figure out that the Bible is a bloody religious fantasy book written to control religious people into submission to the Clergy! Some moron atheists don’t have the slightest idea how it is that Christians are so masochistically submissive! It is all a form of sexual gratification! Check with Kinsey!<br>  <br>  Any member of God the Holy Trinity puts to shame any mobster boss intimidating and killing anybody without mercy just to get your attention about paying your tithe and offerings IN FULL and on the spot to the Church… NO RAIN CHECKS! The Bible writers were very smart! They thought of everything! Although today the preachers use a more civilized "sow the seed and harvest bountifully" scheme to get your money. They do it with a CLEAR CONSCIENCE AND CLEAN HANDS and it is perfectly legal in most countries where politicians take FULL advantage of people’s religious gullibility like in the USA!|`|2b74a7b590db49dcfc18eb7c11e11e62aa	It is a general tendency|`|naI5hGjHaa	Southern Baptists|`|XOZiYqgUaa	Nope.|`|b87de1703c451a059831167ec8643e70aa	My father|`|AA11198190	Yes..............the very wealthy|`|mggll8dRaa	It seems to be all of My Children's Generation, very foolish, for sure....!!|`|MeFeazFiaa	How about Pat Robertson, Benny Hinn, most evangelical bellowers and the pope?<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  I see the mormon fellow took the bait to defend that coniving bunch.|`|fOfJz9OMaa	Most of secular society does this, and unfortunately many in the very bosom of the churches; and fail to regard the Word′s of Christ, saying:<br>  Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth.<br>  Luke 12:15|`|b138671ae3255ea398ff2f873fbf25e8aa	Yes, and they are sad, miserable and alone.|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	the only thing that i prioritize is my things from my dad grandma and MIL that can never be replaced.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	yes i know many ppl who do this.. its kinda sad
k03dYskYaa	Exodus 15:3 says "Jehovah is a manly person of war. Jehovah is his name." NWT<br>  <br>  Jehovah’s destruction of the Egyptian military forces exalted him in the eyes of his worshipers and made his name widely known. (Joshua 2:9,?10; 4:23,?24) Yes, his name was elevated above the powerless, false gods of Egypt, who proved unable to deliver their worshipers. Trust in their deities and in mortal man and military power led to bitter disappointment. (Psalm 146:3) No wonder the Israelites were moved to sing praises that reflected wholesome fear of the living God, who mightily delivers his people!<br>  <br>  Similarly, we should recognize that no false gods of our time and no superpower, even with nuclear armaments, can possibly match Jehovah. He can and will deliver his people. “He is doing according to his own will among the army of the heavens and the inhabitants of the earth. And there exists no one that can check his hand or that can say to him, ‘What have you been doing?’” (Daniel 4:35) When we fully get the sense of these words, we too are moved to sing his praises happily.<br>  <br>   The victory song at the Red Sea continues: “Jehovah is a manly person of war. Jehovah is his name.” This invincible Warrior, therefore, is not some anonymous figment of man’s imagination. He has a name! He is ‘the One who causes to become,’ the Grand Maker, the One “whose name is Jehovah, .?.?. the Most High over all the earth.” (Exodus 3:14; 15:3-5; Psalm 83:18) Do you not agree that it would have been wise for those ancient Egyptians to have a reasonable and respectful sense of fear of the Almighty rather than defy him?<br>  <br>  As Designer of the earth, the Maker of the sea has complete control over the water masses. (Exodus 15:8) Utilizing his control also of the wind, he accomplished what seemed impossible. He split the watery deep at a certain point and forced it back in opposite directions in order to produce a water-lined corridor for his people to pass through. Visualize the scene: millions of tons of sea water piled high in parallel walls, forming a protective escape route for Israel. Yes, those who manifested a healthy fear of God gained protection. Then Jehovah released the water, letting it surge back as a mighty deluge, engulfing Pharaoh’s forces and all their equipment. What a display of divine power over worthless gods and human military strength! Certainly, Jehovah is the one to?be?feared, is he not?—Exodus 14:21, 22,?28; 15:8.|`|FBrwlhPtaa	Thought of this?

A good example is David and Goliath.|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	Well the Lord is a Warrior isn't he?  The Lord has many names and descriptions.  God is a God of Love - yet also a God of wrath.

When Christ returns he too returns as the Warrior King.  So I guess God thought - Go for it Moses - well said.

Along the Red Sea, bodies of charioteers and cavalrymen were being tossed by the surf, and military equipment littered the shore. Led by Moses, the men of Israel exulted in a victory song: “Let me sing to Jehovah, for he has become highly exalted. The horse and its rider he has pitched into the sea. Jehovah is a manly person of war. Jehovah is his name.”<br>  Verses 1 & 3<br>  <br>  Jehovah’s victory at the Red Sea was indeed a demonstration of his superiority in warfare. Israel had left Egypt in battle formation but with little fighting capability. By a pillar of cloud that became a pillar of fire by night, Jehovah had led them from Rameses to “the edge of the wilderness” at Etham.<br>  <br>  Jehovah eventually removes anyone who obstructs pure worship<br>  He allows people to change by giving them warning first... then he acts<br>  Back when this was written, Jehovah gave the Egyptians many warnings.

God would have been happy to receive this victory song of praise to him<br>  <br>  edit..<br>  Yes they were words of Moses. He sang a victory song in praise to God for what he'd done for them.<br>  God was pleased at this<br>  <br>  Do you not believe that all scripture is inspired of God?<br>  Take a  look at  2 Timothy 3:16,17<br>  "ALL scripture is inspired of God.."|`|G4SVG7tKaa	"The Lord is a MAN of war."

The reason is the same why alot of religious people will not watch it, because it questions faith.<br>  <br>  If any faith is true in it's form it should be able to withstand questioning, it's very obvious that the religious people that were against Maher's questions...

Earlier humans knew they were part of nature and so respected it, as a survival strategy. <br>  <br>  When religion was invented so were ideas about hierarchy and some being better than other.  As for man, so for beasts; as a king or priest could rule a farmer, potter or slave, so man could rule, order and abuse  animals.   Religion is what one believes.  It is only recently that we have found that some animlas have qualities that we thought were only possessed by humans.  So, how about animals having souls and even religions of their own?|`|7CmkRkEMaa	I don't care what Christians believe as I am not a religionist. However, I believe in God for without IT, no morals would exist once the atheists comprehend this. If the atheist believes meaning exists to life, morals then exist and therefore, God or some authoritative committee (leaders always exist in committees, therefore this leader would be categorically the god - the leader idea means a source for it exists, therefore God by default reasoning) must be there in creating a standard or rules (morals). <br>  <br>  Hence, hedonism would reign supreme if the atheist truly understood what he was doing and destruction follows. If we wish to have civilisation and not misanthropy and chaos, the God issue must succeed. It is a matter of survival; nothing complex here. The problem is that if the god issue means a man in a white beard (anthropomorphic) sitting on a thrown that god is not mine and dangerous in his negative side. I prefer the idea of a central conscious formless power that we can occasionally experience, but not sustain. It keeps us going as Soul for eternity as the experience is sheer ecstasy! better than any drug and it naturally occurs within when seeking it properly through a mediation-like practice called contemplation - real easy. But some of the most important things in life are easy.|`|oVHFz52Laa	Not true.

I believe in the Bible record. God can create things aged so the age of the world argument is pointless|`|9btru19waa	God made dinosaurs and man on the 6th day of creation. Dinosaurs and man were alive at the same time. Death did not enter the world until after Adam and Eve sinned. <br>  <br>  Before Adam and Eve sinned, God gave the grasses to the animals for food and he gave the fruit of the fruit trees for man to eat. After Adam and Eve sinned death entered the world and animals and man began to eat meat. So for obvious reasons, God took the dinosaurs out of the picture, maybe with the great flood. Man kind would not have survived if God had left them here. <br>  <br>  Eph 2:10 For we are God's masterpiece.

It is also a subject which non-believers often sight as a conflict of the Bible.<br>  The Old Testament in which God smite many countries for his people the Israelite is under the Law.  The ten commandments were a moral guide and Mosaic law was a means of bringing a people into consciousness of God and his desire to share fellowship with a people.  He often promised a land of milk and honey, and if they obeyed, they could easily smite a nation, but when they ignored God's desire, they failed and were often punished.  One day you and I will face that same punishment if we fail to follow God's plan.  The Israelite followed God, ultimately, based upon a promise of the Law being fulfilled, or the Messiah's coming.<br>  <br>  Now the New Testament is based upon Grace.  Man, you and I and all who preceded us and all who will follow us, is incapable of fulfilling the Law, but it must be done.  When Jesus died on the cross, as a living sacrifice for all sin for all times, he fulfilled the Law, did not destroy but fulfilled it.  Meaning an innocent paid the price of the wages of sin, once and for all.  Under Grace you and I just have to accept that gift that God offers through his son Jesus.  When we do, we receive evidence of our sins are washed away by the spilled blood of Jesus.<br>  <br>  So in today's time or since Jesus' time we who are Christians receive a heavenly home, no need to wipe nations out to help a people believe there is a God who loves them, he has proof via the cross.  With Jesus' death and resurrection, his task is finished, we now have all the tools we need to live spiritually for God, he no longer needs to do anything, it is within the power he gives us.  If we desire an action, we can do that action in God's name, for it is written, 'I can do all things in Christ which strengthens me.'  But, Jesus also said, 'if we have the faith of a mustard seed, we can say to this mountain be removed, and it shall be removed.'  There is the secret, most of us do not have the developed faith which is needed to change the world.  Faith is power, but it is Godly power, notselfish as the world would use it if they could but obtain it.|`|b1Fr373gaa	He is too high.

It is very limiting and confining, as far as the human spirit is concerned.<br>  <br>  As far as Science goes, they do have proof from most of their theories, but not all of them, 'they admit it.'  So, it is actually religion that is extremely delusional because christians have transformed their bible, over the centuries, to conform to the needs and desires of themselves. <br>  <br>   Atheists work with the reality that they 'see' before them and don't wait for prayers to be answered but instead but put forth their own efforts to get the job done successfully.  Also, I know quite a few atheists that are spiritual, which has nothing at all to do with religion, but 'some kind' of higher intelligence.

Science says that if it's not proven, there's no good reason to believe. If the goddamn object is out there, science will find it. If it doesn't alter or intervenes or comes into contact with our reality in any ways, it's not part of our reality so there's no reason to give a damn. The scientific method is validated through its own reputation. I don't think the computer at which you typed your question works on faith. Results in science can be tested, corroborated, and predicted. It's the prediction factor that makes science and the scientific method fruitful and reliable.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Yes, your strawman has convinced me once again that I believe whole illogical sentences that I never even said / sarcasm.<br>  <br>  ie:<br>  <br>  "atheist claims things can't exist or be real if science doesn't prove it"<br>  <br>  Listen, for what it's worth, and I doubt you are listening:<br>  <br>  Although I generally require evidence before I consider 'believing' in something, I do not require evidence to entertain that something *could* or *does* exist.<br>  <br>  For all I know, there are 45000000,067 gazillion transparent divine Monkeyfish floating around in an endless multiverse  in which our universe is simply one microbubble.

Not only is science by itself incapable of actually proving anything, but it is in no way a requirement to be an atheist that one believe things cannot exist unless science proves it or even suggests it. As far as we know, there could be a giant purple baboon orbiting Altair; I wouldn't claim that such a baboon could not possibly exist, however there is no significant scientific basis for believing that it exists and so for the time being the most rational position is to not believe in it.

The ultimate truth is chaos - there IS a spiritual realm "out there", as traditional Satanists and those who work magic know, but it is far more complex than either atheists or theists realise.

Dark matter, for example.  But labeling these things as 'god' is not the answer.  <br>  <br>  So scientific ideas are based on logic and proof, and questioning these ideas only makes them stronger. (because if questioning them disproves them, they are not science)<br>  <br>  Faith, by it's very nature, is based on a belief without proof.  Faith seems to be more rooted in tradition and culture than free thinking.  Hopefully, since most religions maintain that they are the ONE TRUE FAITH worshiping the ONE TRUE GOD, you were lucky enough to be born into the right one.  Otherwise, god must hate you and want you to go to (word yahoo will censor), so I wouldn't worry about it.

But when you put them all together as you have done, they say, 'No. That can't be right.' and invent an alternative.  They will tell you that obsessing over the ultimate pointlessness of existence is unhealthy.  Of course that assumes that being healthy is a good in itself.  Ask them to prove this and you'll just get abuse or a blank stare.  You have partially described nihilism.  But there's one important part that should be made plain.  Creating meaning through the exercise of will is also nihilistic.  It's called the will to power.

We will never find an answer in that kind of language. We must learn the language of higher Sanskrit called "Asacer," however it is little more than child's gibberish or speaking in tongues unemotionally (it is the original Tower of Babel language that was the perfect golden age one). Yet we need to bridge from our language and that is why some teachings give Asacer terms scattered through their writings for bridging to it. <br>  <br>  Still I agree with you in not understanding this dichotomy of atheists because why would they need meaning if none exists? I would think they would be all hedonists without any moral code. Richard Dawkins is a very moral individual and retains the dichotomy along with other atheistic writers. Existentialism is the most amazing doctrine as it explains exactly this paradox of becoming the best you can be and then it ceases - for what? Therefore, the idea of God is necessary if we can comprehend IT as one formless supreme conscious power at the centre of the universe. If we stay away from the gender gods of religion, I am all for that. I think the gender gods are negative according to what I have learned. Put forms in there and we have problems of manifestation. Unmanifest with no attributes then we have something which bodes better for getting atheists to understand that the one true god is not an anthropomorphic being repugnant to most everyone.|`|PAA4uWPuaa	Rocks and rain...nope<br>  I will give you a "C" on the interpretation of the rest. <br>  <br>  You are right in the grand scheme of things there is no point.

However,our acquaintance with these feelings is not limited solely to the press; in daily life,we,too,frequently come across such problems and, more importantly, personally experience them. <br>  People and societies endeavour to liberate themselves from the distressing experiences,disorder and repressive social structures that have prevailed over the world for long periods. <br>  We only need to glance at ancient Greece; the Great Roman Empire; Tsarist Russia, or the so-called Age of Enlightenment, and even the 20th century-a century of misery which saw two world wars and world-wide social disasters. No matter upon which century or location you concentrate your research, the picture will not be appreciably different. <br>  If this is the case, why haven't people succeeded in solving these problems, or at least some efforts been made to remove such social diseases from society?<br>  People have encountered these problems in all ages, yet each time they have failed to find any solutions because the methods they employed were inappropriate. They sought various solutions, tried different political systems, laid down impracticable and totalitarian rules, stirred up revolutions or subscribed to perverted ideologies, while many others preferred to adopt an indifferent attitude and merely accepted the status quo. <br>  In our day, people are almost numbed by this way of living. They readily believe these problems to be "facts of life." They picture a society immune to these problems as being nothing short of impossible-a dream utopia. They persistently and openly express their distaste for such a way of living, yet easily embrace it, since they think they have no other alternative. <br>  The resolution of all these problematic issues is possible only by living by the principles of the "true religion." Only when the values of true religion prevail can a pleasant and tranquil scene replace this gloomy and unfavourable picture, which is doomed to continue so long as God's limits are ignored. To put it another way, people are enslaved by these complications as long as they avoid the values of the Qur'an. Put simply, this is the "nightmare of disbelief" and the link below for this wonderful book:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download.php?WorkNumber=256&Format=pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you will find how the regulation of life by the "norms of morality" introduced by the Qur'an revealed to mankind by God will banish the "nightmare of disbelief," how pessimism, corruption and social restlessness can be eliminated from society, how the individual can surround himself with an ideal environment, what spiritual and material benefits he is likely to attain by adherence to these norms of morality are gone into in detail, and finally, that the unique alternative to all these problems is the morality of the Qur'an. <br>  So far, many books have attempted to deal with the social and psychological problems societies face. Yet, what distinguishes this book from others is its stress on the most realistic solution. It also sincerely warns people against the troublesome future they are likely to face if they fail to resort to this solution. <br>  We expect that every reader of conscience will grasp that peace, mutual trust and an ideal social life is attainable only by embracing the values of the Qur'an and will turn to the true religion, which is Islam. <br>  They will then happily join the ranks of those who never suffer, mentally or physically, from any of the above-mentioned complications. Around them, there will always be an abundance of favours, comfort, love, respect, peace and confidence, and moral virtues will prevail. They will know how to earn God's approval, by observing His limits and the commandments of the Qur'an. They will thus, by having faith in God, attain His mercy and at last enter Paradise. <br>  <br>  Useful link:<br>  (A BRIEF ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING ISLAM)<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.p...</a><br>  <br>  DEEP THINKING (VIDEO):<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1124" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>   <br>  <br>  =* FOR ANY HELP FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME ON *=<br>  smiling4ever222@hotmail.com
eph8JOhBaa	I'd suggest that moral support is basically psychological and emotional, whereas other sorts of support would be financial, linguistic, housing, welfare benefits, healthcare and many more more sorts of support that you can begin to think about for yourself now that you're on the right track
iMplzgBtaa	My advice will  not be popular I'm sure, but I would tell her to talk to him and ask him if his inheritance is more important to him than his marriage and future with her.  It doesn't really matter whether he should have told his parents before or not, because it's already done and over with.  There comes a time when we have to stand up for ourselves and do what we think is right for us whether our parents approve or not.  If they are so simple minded and uncaring that they would take away his inheritance then they are in the wrong.  They are trying to manipulate and bribe him into follow their wishes.  He needs to be a man and stand up for himself and his wife and tell them if that's the way they feel he is choosing his wife.  If he doesn't do that then he doesn't deserve her.  Does she really want a man who would choose money over her.|`|CU2eG18kaa	Sad to say, but she probably should divorce.

To convert to Islam just to please certain people is nothing more than to force the person to convert. One must remember ‘there is no compulsion in religion’. That is all theoretically. <br>  On a practical note, here your friend, unfortunately, is doing the most correct thing to protect her marriage. I can then only imagine her love for the man. To be totally honest, it’s the guy’s fault. Since no one knows his parents better than he himself. He shouldn’t have got involved with her in the first place, without asking his conservative parents, but hearts are not always under one’s control. <br>  Again theoretically asking, a Muslim male can marry a woman of his choice (a Muslim/ Christian/ Jewish lady), without the permission of his parents. That is allowed. I am quite certain, there is more to this then you have stated, I suspect something like pre-marital relationship and hence he married her to ‘correct his mistake. [To be noted, this is only a speculation.]<br>  Concerning the guy’s Emirati heritage,let  me tell  you, most of the Emirati friends I have are mixed of an Emirati father, and a non-Emirati mother. Hence, I would tell you that most Emirati people are open- minded to mixed marriages. It is unfortunate that your friend’s lot fell with the ‘minority’. <br>  Personally, I would suggest your friend to go to Dubai to meet the guy’s parents, I am certain once both the parties meet officially, a lot of hatred and doubt will pass by. I am quite certain the guy’s parents are mostly angry because he married her behind their backs. In case that fails, she may ‘nominally’ convert to Islam …and go on with her life [sigh!]. <br>  Like I said, her plan is the most logical one. I think you should give her the support she needs, I am sure that goes without asking.<br>  <br>  Peace : )), hope that helps.|`|qky7gWosaa	The right advice to give her would be regarding her faith. She should revert to Islam for the sake of Allah, not for her husband.<br>  <br>  Why was Abdul not ingenuous in the first place? Why did he not inform his parents that he was marrying a Non Muslim? I am quite perplexed as to why his parents are so disturbed by his marriage, as it is permitted in Islam for a Muslim man to marry a Non Muslim woman. As a friend, be supportive and help her get through her decision. Make Du’a for her. At these times, we should ask for Allah's help.|`|FhXzlnDOaa	No matter what the religion, the right advice is you don't change to please a man, especially one who doesn't have the guts to tell his parents to stay out of his marriage.<br>  <br>  She made a mistake getting involved with a Muslim.  Christians are not supposed to marry outside their faith and this is a perfect example of why.  She will be making another mistake by denying God in order to placate some in-laws who have no respect for her whatsoever.  That respect will NEVER come, no matter what she does.
BhhD5abIaa	Everything seems too real to be true. Life seems too real, too tangible. Yet, at the same time, the idea of YING and YANG makes me wonder perhaps how surreal life actually is. Life is balanced. If there's no equalibrium, no balance, things cannot continue. The universe cannot exist. Therefore, what's real (like the world as we know it) to us now could be completely imagined and that would be rather disappointing. <br>  <br>  If Matrix really existed and there was a Neo and some hope against the MACHINES, I would be ready to be unplugged.

ftI1Hny8aa	Scene kids are kind of like emo kids but they're only doing it for the trend instead of actually having problems. When someone says they want to look scene they really want to look emo, but they hate the word emo because of the negative attachment to the word. The problem with their reasoning is that the only thing that people hate more than emo kids is scene kids which are emo wannabes with no real problems whatsoever. They shop at Hot Topic, do that stupid fringe thing with their hair and listen to Fall Out Boy because it's "cool".|`|c0iOJ1Hzaa	It means they want to fit in with whats considered fashionable and cool and have no personality or style of their own.

Hopefully he will accept you. If not, you go and find new friends and "adopt" a family to love you. <br>  <br>  Try when you can to educate you dad but don't expect anything but always keep the door open for him (if you can) for when and if he does come to his senses. If he comes back to you, awesome. If not, you live your life and you do not deny yourself for anyone (except for safety reasons).|`|G6BG7id2aa	idk, but why was he watching DH? my dad would never do that with me lol <br>  <br>  but yea man, tell him after you graduate i think that would be best, he'll take some time to get used to it (it differs from parent to parent) but i'm sure he'll get used to it, as long as you don't do something that will take him out of his comfort zone.|`|0fygxRHLaa	a dad and his son were watching desperate housewives together?|`|2lim0SHvaa	I think he is gay enough to spend the weekend with me.<br>  <br>  You should seek support and help from your local PFLAG chapter.|`|C0yagFFoaa	oscar wild once said 'me thinks he protesteth too much' meaning that when a man overtly shows his disgust with say homosexuality, he is trying to divert attention away from his own fantasies.<br>  <br>  if you are homosexual well , you got your dna from him and oyur mother. <br>  <br>  my dad is also overtly anti gay, so i told him about oscar wild, and that if you go about , shouting how much you hate gays, other people night think 'he is gay'. this worked he never mentions it any more.<br>  <br>  now i am not gay, but i was still embarassed with him going on aobut it all the time.<br>  <br>  it is best to wait until you have oyur own house and job before telling parent thta you are gay. as then they will have to accept it.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|Nd3qRjtuaa	Hi hun<br>         Well as far as the oldies go its either be tough or get beaten up.<br>  We have to remember or realise that it wasn't all that long ago there was poofter bashing and wogs.<br>  What you could simply and subtly say is<br>  "Dad its the future, people in today's society are a little bit more broad minded than in the old days, just because some people are different it doesn't cast them out any more, face it, they are harmless and its the way things are now, So (if your game, say) get with the program pops and chill out"<br>  ""Phew""<br>  And by saying that he will either respond like a rabbut starring into the headlights or give you a "back in my day" story.<br>  Either way your point will be put across and trust me he will think about it.<br>  <br>  As for your coming out of the closet, Im not one for podium announcements, just coast along and if you get a boy friend just intro him as a friend, no kissing or hugging in front of whoever, you will feel uncomfortable anyway.<br>  Just cruise along, focus on study and it will all be fine.<br>  <br>  All the best darl and good luck<br>  Lotso hugs<br>  Maddy (tv)|`|0Ia9m7Tiaa	OMG he's your father, it means that he loves u just the way u are, don't feel scared about telling him that u are gay, because if u don't, u will continue to lie and it'll hurt u one day.  so i suggest u to tell him your situation when u feel ready to. good luck!|`|QB32kahkaa	Tell your Dad later in life.

racnq84Vaa	If you are not even working there yet and do not get along with your superiors, you need to start looking for another job.  You do not get to change people.  You either deal with them as they are and do your job or you find other employment.  Sounds harsh, but life is harsh.  And reality is you are not indispensable.  If you are already a pain in the butt in their eyes and you haven't even begun, then your job will be short lived anyway.  Reality is that employers want people to work for as little pay as possible and to do as much work as possible.  And the less they have to deal with them and their issues the better for the employer.  <br>  <br>  If you have to work there and cannot wait for another job, you are going to have to learn to put aside your feelings and do your job to the best of your ability and look for another job as much as possible.  And then as soon as you get that new job you need to move on.|`|AA12146958	Sounds like you need to find a different job. You stated you had a problem with the owners then said it was solved. Then you bring it up again with the manager.  She is a manager not a counselor to help you and cannot change anything about the owners. That is what she was saying . Only you can work thru that problem you have.
AA10404097	The easy way to let any guy down is to tell him you already have a boyfriend. However, you may be looking at work and might not want that idea getting around. So the second best way is to say. "You know you seem nice and I know you are going to find the perfect woman for you,  but you just are not my type as a dating thing. I want to keep getting along well at work but I just don't see anything else. Sorry, you are not for me but I am sure there are lots you are for. Give a smile and walk off to let him think about it.<br>  If he does not take that or gets creepy then you need to see the boss just in case he is going to be some kind of problem stalker type.|`|a577675893457f8844900f790e549222aa	Try telling he seems to be taking your friendly nature wrong. You were interested in being work place friends and that you don't believe in dating people that you work with and add that you're sorry if he was just kidding and you were taking him seriously. That lets him off the hook of embarrassment. He can laugh and say something like yes was just joking|`|RWgjnwl9aa	WOW! he's creepy I would tell him all about your (fake) boy friend & how you're both planning  for your futures' together & bring up how he's taking his test for the Police Department seriously this is what I would do|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	Never mix business with personal relationships- now you have to see this guy every day!!|`|NGBP65luaa	Well obviously hes going to fast and freaking u out so just be honest. Or u could avoid him until he gets the message.|`|aGbNWcxIaa	There is no nice way to tell someone that they're creepy. Your problem, however, really lies with the fact that you have no interest in him anymore. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, the best way to handle it is to be direct. If he starts talking about children, say "it makes me uncomfortable when you talk like that". If he starts talking about marriage, say "I really don't see myself marrying someone like you". <br>  <br>  Don't preface it by "not to be mean", or "I'm sorry, but...", it is likely that subtlety is not is strength. <br>  <br>  And whatever you were doing to "trying to be nice", stop. You will just look like you are leading him on. <br>  <br>  Finally, you really shouldn't date where you work anyway. Risk far outweighs the reward...|`|7E2tNdsPaa	I would say that if you do talk to him again, you bring up a conversation about another guy or just a made up guy and talk about how amazing he is and how much you like him. Try to get the message that there is someone else in your life and it is not going to be him.|`|NqWl2qlPaa	Tell him that you just started talking to him and you aren't ready to discuss such serious issues right now. You could also tell him that you just got out of a relationship and you are not emotionally ready to give yourself to someone.|`|pUU4EOCHaa	Tell him you have AIDS. And you're a transvestite.|`|ed7d52fe8334c4d034acc2f4c34f0b44aa	There is that old saying which says "don't f*ck with the payroll". Very bad idea. It does not always end badly but when it does, watch out. He persists in bugging you, you let your boss know, it may go to harassment stuff against him, he'll either get the message or it will bge drilled into him.
XkrHDiClaa	That's sad to see things from such a limited point of view.<br>  <br>  Christians are not out to 'get' anyone.  If you look at a majority of the statements and unintelligible questions (mainly meant to stir a nerve) on this page, Christians are being blamed for everything - though there is nothing sustainable to back the theory.<br>  <br>  Now, if a question is brought up that calls for an educated answer, rest assure the answer (and/or resource) will come.

But Christianity is not. I am a Christian and if I see an atheist, I will talk to them about God and Jesus but if they don't want to talk about it, I will leave it alone.

I can work through my hurt until it no longer dictates my response to that person or event. <br>  <br>  It's a process.

You cant speak for her feelings ("we 'both' love each other..") so if you don't feel secure in the relationship time to put it aside.  The family issue would also turn out to be a big problem eventually.|`|LRbxal5Faa	It sounds to me like you need to train your green-eyed demon. I believe that jealousy is the strongest relationship degrader in the human repertoire. When you are always looking for deception and betrayal, you will always find it. Learn to trust and to allow love the room it needs to grow its own course, my man. Given all that you two have shared as step-siblings, I believe romantic love is only one - and possibly the least important - of the potentials you have between you.
OeVGYXhxaa	They are advocates of God’s Kingdom, not of the political, economic, or social system of any nation of this old world.<br>  It is true that Jehovah’s Witnesses had their modern-day start in the United States. The location of their world headquarters there has helped to make it possible to print and ship Bible literature to most parts of the world. But the Witnesses do not favor one nation over another; they are found in almost every nation, and they have offices in many parts of the earth to supervise their activity in those areas.<br>  Consider: Jesus as a Jew was born in Palestine, but Christianity is not a Palestinian religion, is it? The place of Jesus’ human birth is not the most important factor to consider. What Jesus taught originated with his Father, Jehovah God, who deals impartially with people of all nations.—John 14:10; Acts 10:34,?35.|`|mrMkKFqNaa	Yes and no.  The JW/Watchtower religion was founded by an American and is led by a small group of primarily white American men in New York.  So in that sense, it is an American religion...in the same way that Ford is an American car company even though Ford products are sold around the world.<br>  <br>  However, the large majority of JW/Watchtower followers are outside of the USA.  There are about 7 Million JWs, but only about 1 Million in the USA.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|mSQqEnuqaa	1. There are proportionately more Witnesses in Canada, Costa Rica, Finland, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, and Zambia, as well as in other lands, than there are in the United States.<br>    2. Jehovah’s Witnesses are more than international.  They are supranational, that is, transcending narrow national boundaries or racial interests.  Noteworthy is the great success Jehovah’s Witnesses have had in overcoming racial, tribal, and national prejudice.  Such is the case in South Africa, Israel, Lebanon, Northern Ireland, and other countries troubled by religious unrest.  Blacks and whites, Jews and Arabs, former Catholics and Protestants, all now Jehovah’s Witnesses, work and worship together at their conventions and Kingdom Halls.<br>    3. They print their Bible literature in over 230 languages.  For example, "The Watchtower" is published in over 163 languages and "Awake!" in over 83.<br>    4. Although Jehovah’s Witnesses have their world headquarters in New York, only 16?percent of their number are in the United States.<br>    5. Just as Jerusalem was a convenient springboard for early Christianity, so in this age of world wars and conflicts, the United States has been the most convenient springboard for preaching the good news in all the world.  Experience has shown that anywhere else the work would have been stifled by prejudice, prohibitions, or shortages of raw materials.  But having their headquarters in New York does not mean that the Witnesses are an “American religion,” any more than the early Christians were a Jewish religion, although branded as such.<br>  <br>  For further information & learn more - their official web site - <watchtower.org>|`|CBmizuGwaa	...The JW's founder was American...  "America", however, as a Constitutional Republic & has no official "religion"...<br>  <br>  Over the decades, the JW's (out of Brooklyn, NY) have cleverly "altered", "skewed" and "changed" Scripture to fit it's cultish agenda...  "they" use only "their"exclusive pseudo-translation of the bible (NWT) and too, their false predictions have been modified and altered many times to "save-face" in the Light of Christ's reality !  They deny the Deity of Jesus and teach salvation thru "works' which is in direct conflict with Scripture (Ephesians, Ch 2 vs. 8 & 9)... "they" have created many, many more Scriptural conflicts but time and space doesn't permit me to publish them all in this forum...

They adopted the JW title in the 1930's. The JW's are not a cult. Their leader is God and their mediator is Jesus. Every witness from the top down knocks on doors giving out the message of God's kingdom which is coming, His will to be done on earth as in heaven. JWs are not required to do anything but the will of God. No dues are paid and no tasks are forced on it's members. JW's are not obligated to do anything against their own will. Their mission is a voluntary effort to fulfill what Jesus said at Matt 24:14: The goods news of God's Kingdom will be preached throughout the world and then the end will come.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

As soon as people perceive that you are trying to group yourself into a sub culture, they will immediately try to convince you that you are being childish. Just be yourself, and let others think what they will.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, Goth could be referred to as a personality type. Sensitive, creative, artistic, melancholy, curious, emotional and intelligent.

It never says anything about hating or hurting a person who is of different orientation in the bible. But as said before, people like to mold things in it to their own situation and into their own words so they believe that they are in the right to be against another person like that. There is no real reason besides those people wanting something to hate or dislike, something different from themselves in one way or another.|`|ZzYy2szvaa	There is no reason!  People are just uncomfortable with change (in "societal" norms).<br>  <br>  Also, women see relationships as something full of love, so when they hear that a man (or women) is gay, they just think, "OK, so they are in love with someone of the same sex - big whoop".  However, most heterosexual males see relationships/sexual orientation as a way to have sex (that's all they're focussed on) so then when they hear about a man being gay, they immediately think "It's disgusting that two guys are f***ing each other and they completely miss the part where we are actually in love.  Their views on women being gay are different though (and I think that's pretty self explanatory - same as above but reversed).<br>  <br>  Hope that answers your question =)|`|X1j7qYkUaa	Though the bible contains many passages where it eludes to that notion in a variety of circumstances.

ZaSiPFvtaa	The practice of changing one's name at important turning points in one's life is an interesting one.  Those turning points can be religious or secular in nature, as I will explain.  Catholics' confirmation names are one example, and Muslim's adding "El-hajj" to the beginning of their names when they make their pilgrimage to Mecca is another.  [Muslims:  I apologize if I spelled that wrong, or included any misinformation.  I plead simple ignorance if either is the case.]<br>  <br>  I used to be Catholic, and might have taken a confirmation name had my patron saint not been female (St. Barbara), with myself being male.  I had quite enough gender confusion already without a feminine middle name, and masculinizing "Barbara" creates "Barbarian" -- and who wants THAT in their name?  You are absolutely right, though, that they had absolutely no right to change your choice to "Vicelynne."  You should have at least been consulted, with the right to refuse their suggestion.<br>  <br>  I have changed my name once, and intend to do so again, but for secular reasons.  My name at birth was [x] [y] [z], where [y] was my father's first name, and [z] was his last name.  My father is a monster (I'll spare you the details).  So, when my parents divorced, I kept my original first name, dropped the middle name altogether, and took my mother's maiden name as my new last name.  That was many years ago.<br>  <br>  Soon, I intend to marry, and we want to name our first son "Lennon" after John Lennon (the closest thing this agnostic has to a patron saint, I suppose).  To honor our future son (and no, we're not pregnant!), as well as his namesake, I intend to take the middle name "Lennon" when we marry.  So that's two name-changes in one life-time, although neither was/is for religious reasons.|`|93galWG1aa	I don't believe they had any right to change it, it is a name in it's self and a Saints at that. It is a male name but I know of priests called Mary so can't see the difference.<br>  I would contest that very strongly.

Guys are good at telling you what you want to hear so they can get their way<br>  <br>  It could also be that, nobody likes rejection and since he was hurt he reacted badly. Men also tend to shift the blame when something doesnt go their way so it was his way of trying not to look like a complete @$$ by your rejection.<br>  <br>  Trust me, it has happened many many times and surely will happen many times more. Men and women can be just friends but the rules need to be laid down in the begining, If they know there will never be a chance and still wanna see you, chances are it might work....or it could be just his macho way of thinking that his boyish good looks and charm will change your mind one day.<br>  <br>  I just dont trust men.|`|SxaSQFZGaa	Crystal, Will you marry me? <br>  hehe :]<br>  just kidding but I just dearly love and agree with your answer dear.<br>  Anyways to answer your question, yes but it has never happened to me.

People persecuted him and burned the temple garments he considered to be secret and sacred. Joseph Smith was wearing his New York 1800's normal clothes when he was murdered because he wasn't in the temple after all and in the Joseph Smith movie you don't see him wearing the white clothing, probably though because Mormons are afraid to show Joseph Smith wearing temple garments in the movies they make. Joseph Smith didn't stop the bullets because he wanted to die in jail and have his associates make it look like an unjust murder filled with injustice. He already brainwashed people enough and Brigham Young that he thought that Satan promised to make him a Saint and continue his evil religion with polygamy, lust, and so forth. Plus Joe Smith didn't want anyone to find out more about his affairs with underaged women (under the age of 18 years old he had sex with), the fact that his religion dealt with black magic, seeing Satan, etc., so Joe Smith decided his work was finnished.|`|Ub1IOPsraa	Because the only people who seem to think the underwear is magic are those people who don't wear them.

Not that He will necessarily keep us from dying a physical death but that He will uphold us spiritually so that we may "never die" in that regard, as the Lord said in His mortal ministry of those who believe in Him.<br>  <br>  Now, I wear the garment which you refer too. I will not waste time addressing the tone in which the question is posed. Yet I will tell you that I do believe that God can and will protect me from physical harm as I put His work first, and so long as He wills that I should live.<br>  <br>  It is no different that Moses, or Jesus, or the Israelites, or any other godly man or woman who rightly expected God's intervention, and many of whom eventually suffered the most aggravating forms of death and torture. Yet, God intervenes where He deems necessary, and those who experience such intervention do not deny the power of God that so protected them.<br>  <br>  You will find several stories when the life of Joseph Smith was spared, whether those instances were divine or not is left for the honest reader to decide.<br>  <br>  In short, I encourage you to learn more about who Latter-day Saints are and see if you can't find any good in what we do, then sincerely ask God what kind of people He thinks we are, and how He would treat us, then act accordingly.|`|AA10725805	Because that is not what they are for.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

It's sad this cult is growing and these lies are straight from Satan.<br>  <br>  I have sources of each of the statements above from Brigham Young and Smith.|`|BtygS0Hraa	Just because we don't believe in the Trinity does not mean we don't believe in God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit.  We just believe in them a different way.  Instead of them being one person, we believe they are three distinct individuals who are one in divine purpose.  If you think about it logically, we are all sons and daughters of God the Father, so we are all brothers and sisters.  Satan was also a son of God, but he rebelled and was cast out of Heaven.  He was still our brother, as was Christ.  Christ and Satan were brothers, but were of no comparison.  Christ is and always will be our Saviour!  Anybody who has any common sense knows that a Christian is anybody who follows the teachings of and worships Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the world.  If Mormons did not follow this, why  would the name of their church be The Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter Day Saints.  Jesus Christ is my Saviour and Redeemer, and I will worship Him whether you believe I do or not...|`|4sUek7ugaa	The Bible doesn't say that you must believe in the trinity to be Christian.  It says that you must believe in Jesus as a personal savior.    Mormons believe that, therefore they are Christian.<br>  <br>  Unless you don't believe the Bible is correct, of course.

We believe in the Godhead, that they are three distinct individuals, yet one in purpose, wisdom, power, love, and every other significant attribute. We believe the Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the only begotten in the flesh, and only rightful heir to the Father's kingdom, yet who through love and atoning sacrifice has made it possible for us to be joint heirs, and this with the Father's approbation for He said "He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities."<br>  <br>  I encourage you to learn more about who we as Latter-day Saints are and see if you can't find any good in what we do, and ask yourselves what fruits we bring forward, and from where do they come. Then sincerely ask God what kind of people He thinks we are, and how He would have you treat us, then act accordingly.|`|Tcu0NWkUaa	For the benefit of others who may be sincerely and earnestly seeking for the truth, let me add my two cents worth on this matter.  Yes, members of The Church of JESUS CHRIST of Latter-day Saints, whom you refer to as Mormons, are Christian.  We know that Jesus is the Christ, the Promised Messiah, that it is only through him that we may return to the Father.<br>  <br>  The "trinity" is not biblical and did not come into being until a group of mean got together and came up with such a concept (see Council at Nice or Nicene creed).  One who is familiar with the New Testament can clearly learn that Jesus came to do the will of his Father, not his own, and that Jesus prayed to his Father, not himself, that Stephen saw Jesus on the right hand of God (not on his own right hand) and so the list goes on and on.<br>  <br>  Latter-day Saints believe in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. We believe that God - our Father in heaven - is the Father of ALL.  What's so hard to understand about that?|`|AA11521494	The trinity is orthodox Christian doctrine, and as such all mainstream Christian churches agree that Mormons are not Christians.|`|1e86a17cf7d3d6bd5f1d1eb0376ee828aa	According to our belief Satan and Jesus Christ are brothers in the same way that everyone who has ever or will ever live on this earth are Brothers and Sisters.|`|lkwp0ge1aa	Mormonism=Cult|`|Ub1IOPsraa	Do you claim to be Christian yet continually attack the beliefs of others?|`|3v9rL5xLaa	Simple answer to a simple question....yes.|`|f16e83e5ece08e271bbb4cdb0d855ee3aa	To answer your question, you must first define what being a Christian is. Christ lived with the sinners, and taught a Samaritan woman before teaching His own people, or even gaining His disciples and apostles People think that if you believe their way that makes you a Christian and hate anything they don't understand. <br>  A Christian is a believer and follower of Christ. <br>  Who came up with the Trinty is my queustion.<br>  <br>  Luke 22:68-70 (King James Version)<br>   68 And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go. <br>   69 Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. <br>   70 Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I am.<br>  <br>  If in this it shows that Christ is not God, because He sits on the right hand of God, what doe shtat make him? Here's another thing: If Satan isn't Christ's brother, and Christ is God and God made Satan, than would that make Satan His son, too? Just some things for you to think about.

Jesus was teaching his last long lesson on different subjects. He was getting so unstable that he lost track of the questions that his disciples were asking him…<br>  <br>  John 13:36 (NIV) Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?"<br>  <br>  John 14:5 (NIV) Thomas said to him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?" <br>  <br>  Jesus didn’t answer them, but towards the end of this last training class Jesus is complaining that nobody is asking him where he is going!!!<br>  <br>  John 16:5 (NIV) Now I am going to him who sent me, yet none of you asks me, “Where are you going?”* (*At this point Saint Peter and Saint Thomas started to bang their heads against the wall).<br>  <br>  Obviously Jesus was so depressed about dying that he just couldn’t remember anything anymore. Then he goes to the Garden of Gethsemane sweating tear drops of blood in desperate fear of dying for anybody! He was in need of a comforter, but God the Holy Ghost, aka “Another Comforter” was nowhere to be found! Instead an angel creature of God showed up (with a box of napkins?)… The Preachers are covering up the fact that Jesus was yellow-bellying at the idea of going to the Holy Cross!<br>   <br>  Luke 22:44 And being in anguish, he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.<br>  <br>  BTW, Jesus started to shed blood even before going to the Holy Cross, but the savvy theologians are saying that this blood was worthless to save anybody from their sins. The Blood of Jesus had to flow freely from his limbs while nailed to the Holy Cross! The Roman soldier that poke a spear into Jesus’ right side rib cage drew WATER that had nothing to do with any plan of salvation!<br>  <br>  Hebrews 5:7-8 (NIV) During the days of Jesus' life on earth, HE OFFERED UP PRAYERS AND PETITIONS WITH LOUD CRIES AND TEARS TO THE ONE WHO COULD SAVE HIM FROM DEATH* (*This Son of a God is not an atheist in a foxhole! I never heard an atheist doing this number in a foxhole!), and he was heard because of his reverent submission. ALTHOUGH HE WAS A SON, HE LEARNED OBEDIENCE* (Yeah… naughty Jesus! God the Father up in the sky taught him a lesson just for the heck of it “because it pleased God!”) FROM WHAT HE SUFFERED* (*the Bible writers were not too careful writing about Jesus credentials, but the Christians today are willing to kill to defend what the preachers tell them! I know that Islam is much worse, but that is not an excuse to pick the Christian religion or “Jesus” or any religion at all! A lot of high profile people are declared Christians and they won’t be the first ones to change even if they figure out that Christianity is the biggest religious scam in the world today!)<br>  <br>  I can almost still hear Jesus crying out loud! That is probably why Jesus didn’t spend the promised full 3 days and 3 nights in Hell, but only 2 nights, one day and hardly any time of the first and last day. Jesus Christ was really horrified to die for anybody! The FUNNIEST JOKE ON JESUS that any Christian could possible dream up is the fancy artistic rendition of the Holy Cross that killed him!  It now identifies Christianity!  Showing a dead body hanging on any cross is too gross for a lot of Christians so the Protestants do not recognize the Crucifix, but only the empty Cross.  The absurd worship of so many crosses of Jesus proves the sadomasochistic orientation of the Christian religion… it is barbaric! Jesus flesh is beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit in preparation for hanging totally naked on a Holy Cross as the “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world!” There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed their victim’s genital area in a diaper before hanging them on any cross! The next time that a sweet Catholic lady or nun prays before a crucifix she ought to know that the diaper is NOT there! She can go ahead and ask the Pope if the Roman soldiers ever dressed their victims with a white clean diaper before they crucify them!   <br>  <br>  No wonder the Bible writers have Jesus sweating TEARS OF BLOOD begging his Father in Heaven “to pass the cup”. It would have been much easier if God the Father would have assigned a “Guardian Angel” to protect Eve from eating a fruit from the wrong tree! That would have saved the WHOLE world that God loves so much without killing any member of the Holy Trinity! You have to have a specially conditioned stomach and a pervert mind to be a Christian! No wonder they call it the “Slaughter House Religion”! In spite of all the virtual suffering of Jesus Christ Saint Paul comes along later on and finishes WHATEVER PAIN JESUS STILL HAD TO SUFFER IN HIS OWN FLESH for the sins of the “elect” and for their salvation so they can go to Fairy Heaven when they die!<br>  <br>  Colossians 1:24 (NIV) Now I* (*Saint Paul) rejoice in what was suffered for you, and I FILL UP IN MY FLESH WHAT IS STILL LACKING IN REGARD TO CHRIST'S AFFLICTIONS, for the sake of “his body, which is the church”.* (*crappy talk, but what the heck!)<br>  <br>  For his work the Bible writers have God rewarding Saint Paul with the "STIGMATA"* (*the marks of Jesus crucified). He was the first Christian to get it!<br>  <br>  Galatians 6:17 (NIV) FINALLY, let no one cause me trouble, for I BEAR ON MY BODY THE MARKS OF JESUS. (“I lie not!” –Saint Paul)<br>  <br>  You ought to know that atheists do know how to read the Bible the way it is… not the way it has to be read according to the dogmas of a particular Church brand. The Bible is full of Holy Religious Crap on/in every page! Christians need to have preachers telling them what Christianity ought to be all about because MOST CHRISTIANS don’t read the Bible and those who do follow a poached list of verses to be read on specific days of the week! There is no need to read anybody’s book to know what the Bible is all about. It suffices to read the Bible carefully and objectively! It is all in the Bible! I know that thousands if not millions of free loaders are making a living on any religion, especially the “Jesus” religion… They managed to convince a lot of people and even national leaders in this world that the Clergy and the Preachers speak for a higher authority!<br>  <br>  Christianity is the biggest scam in human history!|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Yeah right.

The satisfaction of proving yourself right, and others wrong may be your only reward.  However, if you mirror Jesus in your life, it will reflect you as different from the world, a more desirable reflection than one who wants to argue a point of contention.<br>  Better to stand up for Jesus in the way you are different in the world.  If it is a good reflection, people will want to know why you are different, perhaps even want Jesus as part of their life.  That is what works for me.<br>  <br>  Do keep fortifying yourself with truth, it will set you free and others will follow.<br>  Agape Love|`|LjsRfaskaa	Sure, apart from the fact that the last emperor of Rome, Constantine is the person who created the Bible and Christianity.

They believe God worked through Jesus just like God does with many people.  They believe that there are those in their religion that will work along side and with the same ranking as Jesus.  They believe Jesus to be just another person doing God's will.  They have what they call the governing body and believe this governing body made up of people in New York are equal to Jesus giving orders and running their religion.  They might not even admit this in case they have a chance to convert you and don't want to offend you but the more you get to know their teachings and get in among them you will see this for yourself.

All other things were created for and through Jehovah's firstborn spirit Son. Jesus was sent to earth to redeem imperfect humans from sin & death which our first parents, Adam and Eve brought upon us by their disobedience to the one who gave them life. Jesus gave up his perfect life as a ransom sacrifice for all of us. Jesus physically died and on the third day after he was entombed, Jehovah resurrected his precious Son back to life. Soon afterwards, Jesus returned to the heavens where he had resided alongside his Father before coming to earth.  Jesus is now ruling as King and high Priest over his Father's Kingdom or Government. In the near future, he will rule over the entire earth for 1000 years and after that time period, the rulership will be given back to Jehovah. Mankind under Jesus' 1000 year reign will be a time of peace, security and joy and the whole earth will be transformed into a global paradise, where no one will have to deal with Satan and his demons wicked influence, for they will be restrained for that 1000 year time span.<br>  Jesus is our King, the Prince of peace and the one who gave his life for us.

Hewett points out: "one can always...say of god he is characterized by light; one cannot always say of light that is is god."<br>  similar examples are found at John 4:24 "gos is a spirit." and at John 4:16 "god is love.". in bothof these verses, the subjects have definate articles but the predicates "spirit" and "love" so not. so the subjects and predicates are not interchangeable. these verses cannot mean that "spirit is god" or "love is god"<br>  <br>  ---------------------------<br>  <br>  here's only a few scriptures that proves he is not god. there is tons more, but i doubt they will all fit :p<br>  <br>  god is the greatest in the universe, one person<br>  <br>  god not 3 persons<br>  <br>  deut 6:4  Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD<br>  <br>  mal 2:10 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?<br>  <br>  mark 10:18 And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God<br>  <br>  romans: 3:29, 30 [29] Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles?

The titles “Messiah” (from a Hebrew word) and “Christ” (from a Greek word) both mean “Anointed One.” This promised One would be anointed, that is, appointed by God to a special position. In later chapters of this book, we will learn more about the Messiah’s important place in the fulfillment of God’s promises. We will also learn about the blessings that Jesus can bring us even now. Before Jesus was born, however, many no doubt wondered, ‘Who will prove to be the Messiah?’<br>  <br>  5 In the first century?C.E., the disciples of Jesus of Nazareth were fully convinced that he was the foretold Messiah. (John 1:41) One of the disciples, a man named Simon Peter, openly said to Jesus: “You are the Christ.” (Matthew 16:16) How, though, could those disciples—and how can we—be sure that Jesus really is the promised Messiah?<br>  <br>  6 The prophets of God who lived before Jesus foretold many details about the Messiah. These details would help others to identify him. We might illustrate things this way: Suppose you were asked to go to a busy bus depot or a train station or an airport to pick up someone you had never met before. Would it not help if someone gave you a few details about him? Similarly, by means of the Bible prophets, Jehovah gave a rather detailed description of what the Messiah would do and what he would experience. The fulfillment of these many prophecies would help faithful ones to identify him clearly.<br>  <br>  7 Consider just two examples. First, over 700 years in advance, the prophet Micah foretold that the promised One would be born in Bethlehem, a small town in the land of Judah. (Micah 5:2) Where was Jesus actually born? Why, in that very town! (Matthew 2:1, 3-9) Second, many centuries in advance, the prophecy recorded at Daniel 9:25 pointed to the very year when the Messiah was to appear—29?C.E. The fulfillment of these and other prophecies proves that Jesus was the promised Messiah.<br>  <br>  BUT Jesus is not his own father Jehovah......unless Jesus is his own father...Jesus is son of the most high...but not the most high...but his father Jehovah.<br>  <br>  many people believe Jesus is  his own father....they say Jesus is God almighty and Son of God almighty at the same time.|`|AA10024451	We believe what the Bible tells us about Jesus Christ: <br>  <br>  - Jesus is the very first of God's creations. (Revelation 3:14; Colossians 1:15). <br>  <br>  - Contrary to false religious doctrine, we believe Jesus to be God's Son, a being created by God and always subordinate to God. He is NOT equal to God, nor is he in any way a part of a "trinity" nature of God. <br>  <br>  - Jesus willingly forsook his glorious position in the heavens where he spent time in the very presence of his God and Father (John 20:17) in order to come to this earth and be born and live as a perfect human where he then gave up his life to buy back for mankind what Adam lost: the hope to live forever on the earth in paradise and in perfect health. <br>  <br>  - It is through our exercising of faith in the ransom sacrifice of Jesus that we (1) may have our sins forgiven by God and we can become reconciled to Him, (2) may have that hope for an eternal future, which Adam, by his sin, lost for us. <br>  <br>  - Jesus' life as recorded in the gospel accounts is to serve as the example we are all to follow in terms of not only the way he treated other people, but particularly in the way he lived to do his Father's will. <br>  <br>  - Jesus, according to Bible chronology and secular history, is the now-reigning king of God's heavenly kingdom, awaiting the word from his Father to go forth with the armies of heaven and battle against Satan and his demons and clean up the earth of all traces of false religion and governments and rulerships that stand in opposition to the kingdom. <br>  <br>  - Jesus, will be ruling as the king of God's kingdom from the heavens, along with the 144,000 humans who have been "bought from the earth" (Revelation 14:3) to serve as kings and priests in dispensing the full benefits of Jesus' sacrifice onto the human family that survives Armageddon and lives on to tranform the earth into the global paradise during the Thousand Year Reign of Christ.|`|3DjUX8etaa	The JW believe Jesus was and still is the arch-angel Michael.

m4nKkFDUaa	Think its "I kinda feel that my boobs (breasts) are disappearing"
vhlORK4Waa	Asalaam Aleikum<br>  <br>  The religion of Islam (submission) is based upon 5 primary pillars. Below you will find their names and a brief description of each:<br>  <br>  Shahada<br>  <br>  There is no god worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad is His messenger. This declaration of faith is called the Shahada, a simple formula which all the faithful pronounce. In Arabic, the first part is la ilaha illa Llah - 'there is no god except God'; ilaha (god) can refer to anything which we may be tempted to put in place of God - wealth, power, and the like. Then comes ill Allah: 'except God', the source of all Creation. The second part of the Shahada is Muhammadun rasulu'Llah: 'Muhammad is the messenger of God.' A message of guidance has come through a man like ourselves.<br>  <br>  It should be a genuine belief from one's heart. The witnessing of the Oneness of Allah is the rejection of any form of deity other than Allah, and the witnessing that Muhammad is His Messenger is the acceptance of him being chosen by Allah to convey His message of Islam to all humanity and to deliver it from the darkness of ignorance into the light of belief in, and knowledge of, the Creator.<br>  <br>  Salat /Namaz<br>  Salat is the name for the obligatory prayers which are performed five times a day, and are a direct link between the worshipper and God. There is no hierarchical authority in Islam, and no priests, so the prayers are led by a learned person who knows the Quran, chosen by the congregation. These five prayers contain verses from the Quran, and are said in Arabic, the language of the Revelation, but personal supplication can be offered in one's own language.<br>  <br>  Prayers are said at dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, sunset and nightfall, and thus determine the rhythm of the entire day. Although it is preferable to worship together in a mosque, a Muslim may pray almost anywhere, such as in fields, offices, factories and universities.<br>  <br>  The Prophet (pbuh) says:<br>  <br>  "What is between a person and committing shirk (associating partners with Allah) and kufr (disbelief) is abandoning the prayer." (Sahih Muslim, #82) <br>  <br>  Zakat<br>  One of the most important principles of Islam is that all things belong to God, and that wealth is therefore held by human beings in trust. The word zakat means both 'purification' and 'growth'. Our possessions are purified by setting aside a proportion for those in need, and, like the pruning of plants, this cutting back balances and encourages new growth.<br>  <br>  Each Muslim calculates his or her own zakat individually. For most purposes this involves the payment each year of two and a half percent of one's capital. Allah(swt) says:<br>  <br>  “And perform As-Salaah (Iqaamat-as-Salaah), and give Zakaah, and whatever of good (deeds that Allah loves) you send forth for yourselves before you, you shall find it with Allah Certainly, Allah is All-Seer of what you do”[al-Baqarah 2:110]   <br>  <br>  <br>  Ramadan<br>  Every year in the month of Ramadan, all Muslims fast from first light until sundown, abstaining from food, drink, and sexual relations. Those who are sick, elderly, or on a journey, and women who are pregnant or nursing are permitted to break the fast and make up an equal number of days later in the year. If they are physically unable to do this, they must feed a needy person for every day missed. Children begin to fast (and to observe the prayer) from puberty, although many start earlier.<br>  <br>  Although the fast is most beneficial to the health, it is regarded principally as a method of self purification. By cutting oneself off from worldly comforts, even for a short time, a fasting person gains true sympathy with those who go hungry as well as growth in one's spiritual life. Allah (swt) says:<br>  <br>  “O you who believe! Observing As-Sawm (the fasting) is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become Al-Muttaqoon (the pious)”[al-Baqarah 2:183]   <br>  <br>  Hajj<br>  The annual pilgrimage to Makkah - the Hajj - is an obligation only for those who are physically and financially able to perform it. Nevertheless, about two million people go to Makkah each year from every corner of the globe providing a unique opportunity for those of different nations to meet one another. Although Makkah is always filled with visitors, the annual Hajj begins in the twelfth month of the Islamic year (which is lunar, not solar, so that Hajj and Ramadan fall sometimes in summer, sometimes in winter). Pilgrims wear special clothes: simple garments which strip away distinctions of class and culture, so that all stand equal before God.<br>  <br>  If the Muslim does Hajj correctly, in the manner prescribed and sincerely for the sake of Allah, it will be an expiation for his sins. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said:<br>  <br>  “Whoever does Hajj for the sake of Allah, and does not have sexual relations or commit sins, will come back like the day his mother bore him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 15210)<br>  <br>  Insha'allah this will help you<br>  Halcon|`|fNRAG6qBaa	They're very comfortable to rest your head on.|`|j4n95V8gaa	All I know is that once all of 'em will be broken down & turned into DUST.|`|dqZrq7Zeaa	more than enough I read the koran.<br>  NO THANKS|`|Wn1rtE97aa	There's five of them.  I can't recall the proper Arabic terms for them, but the first and most fundamental is the declaration of belief in Allah, that the Quran is the word of Allah, and that Muhammad is the messenger.  The other four pillars are prayer (five times a day to Mecca), fasting (particularly during Ramadan), almsgiving to the poor and the Hajj, to make a pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in your life, on the condition that one is able physically and financially to make the trip.<br>  <br>  That's about it, though, as I'm agnostic.

AA10024451	For some of those Jesus was speaking to, they would (if they exercised faith and remained faithful to death) have the hope of a heavenly reward (that being the privilege of life in heaven). <br>  <br>  For the majority of us today, the phrasing is indicative of where our blessings would originate from. These blessings would be a result of our faithful endurance through persecutions that would come upon us. <br>  <br>  Jesus' words do not solely refer to those going to heaven, nor was it a lie. He himself is the one who talked about the "little flock" and the "other sheep"........both groups of faithful individuals, but two separate groups in the sense of one being given the heavenly hope and the other having the earthly hope.|`|k03dYskYaa	Revelation 14:1 shows that only 144,000 will go to heaven from among mankind.<br>  Jesus said that the reward is “in the heavens” because it comes from Jehovah.

He told them: “You will be objects of hatred by all people on account of my name.” (Matthew 10:5-18,?22) Earlier, however, in his Sermon on the Mount, he gave his apostles and others the assurance that such opposition would not necessarily endanger their deep-felt happiness. In fact, Jesus even linked being happy with being persecuted as Christians! How could persecution bring happiness?<br>  <br>  Jesus ended his consideration of the ninth happiness by saying: “Rejoice?.?.?.?, for in that way they persecuted the prophets prior to you.” (Matthew 5:12) The prophets whom Jehovah sent to warn unfaithful Israel were badly received and often persecuted. (Jeremiah 7:25,?26) The apostle Paul testified to this fact, writing: “What more shall I say? For the time will fail me if I go on to relate about .?.?. the other prophets, who through faith .?.?. received their trial by mockings and scourgings, indeed, more than that, by bonds and prisons.”—Hebrews 11:32-38.<br>  <br>  Today, we as Jehovah’s Witnesses are often persecuted because we are zealous in preaching the good news of the Kingdom. Our enemies accuse us of “aggressive proselytizing,” but we know that faithful worshipers of Jehovah before us faced similar criticism. (Jeremiah 11:21; 20:8,?11) We count it a privilege to suffer for the same reason that the faithful prophets of old suffered. The disciple James wrote: “Brothers, take as a pattern of the suffering of evil and the exercising of patience the prophets, who spoke in the name of Jehovah. Look! We pronounce happy those who have endured.”—James 5:10,?11|`|3aVxJYf6aa	What does it mean Matthew 5:5?<br>  <br>  5?“Happy are the mild-tempered ones, since they will inherit the earth.<br>  <br>  They will inherit the earth.....When?? and how will be the earth during that time??<br>  <br>  Was Jesus lying when he said mild-tempered ones, will inherit the earth. ?|`|449846213f4282285ff069cbc714fb29aa	Who was he speaking to at that time? Wasn't he not speaking to his followers?<br>  <br>  One of the main reasons why we don't believe that everyone is going to heaven is because of a couple of simple truths...<br>  <br>  First, mankinds original purpose is to live on a paradise earth forever without the worries of growing old getting sick and die....If Adam didn't sin would he be alive today? Yes...<br>  <br>  Second, any time God makes a decision, or purpose and that purpose doesn't become realized then he doesn't change his mind but rather he finds a solution to correct the situation....Thus a perfect life was taken by Adam, it needed to be replaced by someone elses perfect life and since all of us are decendents of Adam we all inherit sin and death. Thus Christ was the only one qualified to give his life a ransom in exchange for all....he was the only one not a decendent of Adam and so he never inherited sin and death...<br>  <br>  Third, Jesus Christ, when referring to heavenly life, is referring to a priviledge to live in heaven with him for purpose....that purpose is to live in heaven as kings and priests along side Christ....and they are to rule over the earth...if the earth is to be destroyed and everyone, according to your doctrine, is ultimately suppose to live in heaven, thus no use for the earth.....but in the Bible in Revelation clearly states that those with the heavenly hope are the ones that will be given the priviledge to rule as kings and priests with Christ in heaven over the earth....thus the earth is going to have inhabitants for them to rule over...<br>  <br>  And lastly, the statements that I've stated are scripturely sound, not self opinionized...and as a bonus I will provide all the scriptures that refer to all of what I've finished stating....<br>  <br>  Enjoy...<br>  <br>  Psalm 37:29<br>  Matthew 5:5<br>  Psalm 115:16<br>  Ecclesiastes 1:4<br>  Isaiah 45:18<br>  Isaiah 55:10, 11(God always sees his purpose become a reality)<br>  Revelation 5:9<br>  Matthew 6:9, 10<br>  Malachi 3:6 (Again God doesn't change)<br>  Matthew 5:5<br>  Revelation 14:1,3<br>  Revelation 21: 3,4 (notice that God is with mankind, and mankind can only exist here on earth)|`|o1hyyXw7aa	They might answer & say He was talking about "paradise earth".<br>  <br>  An even better question, ask them their thoughts on John 20:28.

If you look back through history, and you don't even have to look at world history-just go back about 150 years here in the States- White women were always the ones that were protected. If a white woman got raped, there was a mob out in the streets looking for the man that did it. The rest of us have always been seen as animals, here purely for breeding purposes.<br>   When white men go for minority women, it's usually because they think they will experience the wilder side of sex. Unfortunately, it's a mindset that has been subconsciously passed down as part of the American psyche. <br>  White women have always been viewed as sophisticated, demure, pure, educated (even if they aren't), and the symbol of hearth and home. They are part of the "American Dream". <br>  Also, since most of the world views Jesus Christ as having been a white man, a lot of people view white as next to holiness.<br>  I know this doesn't curb your anger, but hang in there. A few more generations and there won't really be such a thing as white,since the world will have intermarried and intermixed enough that we will all be brown to some degree.|`|9UgGwvtlaa	Ummm have u seen middle eastern women...they look white too!!<br>  when u say middle eastern men go for white women..check out these arab woman<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/ffximage/2007/05/25/cannes3,0.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/ffximage...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aljaml.com/files/images/Nancy-Ajram.preview.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aljaml.com/files/images/Nancy...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://img2.travelblog.org/Photos/1910/42925/f/227367-The-Jordanian-Royal-Family-3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img2.travelblog.org/Photos/1910/4...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.traveladventures.org/continents/asia/images/syrian-people04mini.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.traveladventures.org/continen...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  arabs arent the sterotypes u see on tv<br>  <br>  and there are hispanics that can pass for white too.<br>  <br>  White women arent the only women one earth with certain features.<br>  <br>  That lady u see walking with a hispanic or an indian..MIGHT BE AN INDIAN OR HISPANIC GIRL.<br>  <br>  I know egyptians look white too.<br>  <br>  I dont think minority men chase after white girls....I havent noticed it...they always go back to their women.<br>  <br>  Thats the truth, in each culture there is a strong pride in their people.<br>  <br>   i think ur just paranoid!<br>  <br>  someone might debate u and say why are american men chasing after international women?|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I honestly just think that it's because of the "ideal" beauty.

Emotional maturity is.<br>  <br>  Also, I think homosexuals can date from a younger (general) age than heterosexuals because if they accept themselves, then there are less risks and both will know what the other person has gone through.

Having realistically recognized others' kindness as well as their faults, love is always focused on the other person’s welfare. We have no ulterior motives to fulfill our self-interest or to fulfill our desires; we love others simply because they exist. Attachments exaggerates others' good qualities and makes us crave to be with them. When we're with them, we're happy but when we're separated from them, we are miserable. These attachments are linked with expectations of what others should be or do. Is love as it is usually understood in most societies really love? Let's examine this a bit more. Generally we are attracted to people either because they have qualities we value or because they help us in some way. If we observe our own thought processes carefully - we'll notice that we look for specific qualities in others. Some of these qualities we find attractive, others are those our parents, or society value. We examine someone's looks, education, financial situation, social status. This is how most of us decide on whether or not the person holds any true value to us. In addition, we judge people as worthwhile according to how they relate to us. If they help us, make us feel secure, listen to what we have to say, care for us when we are sick, we consider them good people and it is this type of people we are most likely to be more attracted to. But this is very biased, for we judge them only in terms of how they relate to us, as if we are the most important person in the world. After we've judged certain people to be good for us, whenever we see them it appears to us as if goodness is coming from them, but if we are more aware, we recognize that we have projected this goodness onto them. Desiring to be with the people who make us feel good, we become emotional yo-yo's - when we're with these people, we're up, when we're not with these people, we're down. Furthermore, we form fixed concepts of what our relationships with those people will be and thus have expectations of them. When they do not live up to our expectations of them, we're disappointed, or may become angry. We want them to change so that they will they will match what we think they are. But our projections and expectations come from our own minds, not from the other people. Our problems arise not because others aren't who we thought they we're, but because we mistakenly thought they were something they aren't. Checklist: "I Love You if __________ " What we call love is most often attachments. It is actually a disturbing attitude that overestimates the qualities of another person. We then cling to tightly to that person, thinking our happiness depends on that person. Love, on the other hand, is an open and calm, relaxed attitude. We want someone to be happy, and free from suffering simply because they exist. While attachments are uncontrolling and too sentimental. Love is direct and powerful. Attachments obscure our judgment and we become impatient, angry, and impartial, helping only our dear ones and harming those who we don't like. Love clarifies our minds and we access a situation by thinking of the greatest good for everyone. Attachments are based on selfishness, while love is founded upon cherishing others, even those who do not look very appealing to the eyes. Love looks beyond all the superficial appearances. If we see unattractive, dirty, ignorant people, we feel repulsed because our minds want to know attractive, intellectual, clean and talented people. Love recognizes that regardless of the others' appearances, their experience is the same as ours: they wish to be happy, to be free from sufferings, and to do their best to avoid problems. When we're overly attached to a person, we're not mentally and emotionally free. We overly depend on and cling to the person to fulfill our mental and especially our emotional needs. We fear losing the person, feeling we'd be incomplete without him. However, this does not mean that we should suppress our emotional needs or become aloof, alone and totally independent, for that too does not solve the problem. We must simply realize our unrealistic needs, and slowly seek to eliminate them. Some emotional needs may be so strong that they can't be dissolved immediately. If we try to suppress them or pretend they do not exist, we become anxious and insecure. In this case, we can do our best to fulfill our needs while simultaneously working gradually to subdue them. The core problem is that most of us seek to be loved, rather than to love. We yearn to be understood by others rather than to understand them. In all honesty, our sense of emotional insecurities comes from the selfishness obscuring our own minds. We 'can' develop self-confidence by recognizing our inner potential to become a selfless human being with many magnificent qualities, then we'll develop a true and accurate feeling of self-confidence. And then we'll seek to increase love - without attachments, to increase compassion, to cultivate lovingkindness, patience, compassion, generosity, understanding and wisdom. Under the influence of attachments we're bound by our emotional reactions to others. When they are nice to us, we're happy. When they ignore us or speak sharply to us, we take it personally and are unhappy. But pacifying these attachments doesn't mean we become hard-hearted. Rather, without attachments there will be space in our hearts and minds for genuine impartial love for them. We'll be actively involved with them. As we learn to subdue our selfish attachments, we can have successful friendships and personal relationships with others. These relationships will be richer because of the freedom and respect which the relationships will be based on. However, our lifestyles and interests may be more compatible with those of some people more so than with others and that is alright. In any case, our relationships will be based on mutual love, mutual interests, and the wish to help each other in life".|`|wz98ueJvaa	No. It doesn't show love at all, and many nice people throughout the world hate violence.

KuTSteEYaa	I am an ENT surgeon myself from Hyderabad and involved in cochlear implant, the latest implantable hearing aid, for deaf mutes in Hyderabad. I am also involved in rehabilitation of Hearing Impaired . There has been a sea change in the attitude of people with disabilities or physically challenged/their kith and kin/ public in general over the years. The social stigma has decreased to a large extent ,I admit not completely in some rural areas and among urban educated dogmatic elite ,but certainly there is change. It is no longer a curse/ 'nothing can be done'/ 'he/she is born like that , that is his or her fate'/'any effort over these people is unnecessary expenditure' to as an issue to be fought at individual-family-community and Govt level.*Unfortunately such people of yest er years suffered because of social ostracizing/exploitation/lack of training /rehabilitation facilities so that they could earn by themselves .The parents or kith and kin (as even today many think) used to think getting them married was solution for all problems. They do this to mentally retarded girls too. The husbands marrying under pressure/for money/relationship/property used to ill treat them.You may approach court under atrocities against women under domestic violence and also injustice against disabled and if her husband can pay he can be made to pay so that at least she need not live her last days in penury.Whenever such people are to be married it is important that they are first trained to be self reliant/ educated --there so many schools for such people now and made a partner in decision makeing --the attitude of spouse has to be carefully assessed and then proceed. There are many counselling centres now and they should be made use of. Children can be born with similar disabilities and both husband and wife should be prepared for it.

While Europe was in the Dark Ages, the Middle East was the center of knowledge and invention. I'm sorry your school textbooks were so anglocentric.<br>  <br>  Wearing the hijab is similar to why Christian men and women wore hats to church until the 1970s when they lost popularity in the greater culture. And how is it any different from Christian men in the Victorian ages asking women to cover their ankles? Personally, I don't believe modesty is exclusive to women and if hair and wrists and whatnot excites men so much, men should be the ones to cover their eyes and their shame.

DvZdB66maa	Yes, I think that everyone can find at least ONE person from every race who they are attracted to (or, at least, FIND attractive). If they say they can't, then they are just lying to themselves.<br>  <br>  Sweet_P is absolutely wrong. A person saying that they are "not attracted to Black girls" is NOTHING like not being attracted to people with various facial features, hair colors, height, weight, etc... because Black people come in ALLLLL different looks. We are the most diverse race. There is someone for everyone. I am a Black Latina, and I have Blacks in my family who have been mistaken for East Indian, Native American, the "stereotypical" Hispanic look, mulatto, Black & Asian, and even WHITE. My mother is a very, very fair skinned redhead -- and she is regularly mistaken for WHITE, even though she is BLACK!!<br>  <br>  Black people do not all have the same features AT ALL... so, saying "I'm not attracted to Black girls" is dismissing all of the VARIOUS types of Black girls out there... like I said, not even REMOTELY similar to preference of other characteristics. People love to assume that all Black people have dark skin, dark kinky hair, and dark eyes... but that is not true.<br>  <br>  I have Black people in my family who have naturally straight hair (who are usually mistaken for East Indian or Native American), wavy hair, curly hair, and kinky hair. I also have family members that have blue eyes, green eyes, brown eyes, and hazel eyes... and then, people with black hair, light brown hair, dark brown hair, red hair, and even blonde hair (although a dark, sandy blonde)!! And then, we have people from the lightest of light (like my mother) to the darkest of dark... And then of course, we have tall, short, inbetween, all weights, all different facial features, etc... With a diversity like that, there is NO WAY POSSIBLE that someone could just claim that they are "not attracted to Black women" without some form of self-deception. Just my opinion.|`|zlVhKPxkaa	There are sexy women of all races, just as there are ugly women of all races. You can't generalize.

It's not necessarily that those people you are talking about think that black girls are ugly, maybe they just don't feel as if they would date one.<br>  <br>  It's like saying everyone can be attracted to tall and short, fat and thin, dark and fair, blondes, brunettes and red heads, big boobs small boobs etc. Same goes for race, and it's not fair to call someone a bigot because they can't be attracted to everyone.

bADza5pRaa	Jesus was actually a Jew you silly little boy.  His disciples all converted to Catholicism and without them there would be no such thing as your man made protestant religion.  You call yourself a portestant, when was the last time you actually prayed to God? Or attended a protestant service? eh? You sound the exact opposite of a Christian you are soooo bitter its not true, instead of critisising the Catholic faith how about you concentrate on your own religion!|`|DDYIrSKOaa	Notice how Jesus never quoted from those 7 other books.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avpublications.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.avpublications.com</a>|`|FGcwxZz0aa	In first century Jerusalem there were at least four OT Canons in use by different Jewish Groups. There was the Canon of the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Ethiopian Jews and the Diaspora/Essene Jews. Jesus and the disciples used the Septuagint which was the Canon of the Diaspora/Essenes. We know this because it is quoted in the New Testament. This Canon continued to be the Canon of Christians until after the Reformation and, in fact until about 200 years ago when the Protestants adopted a condensed version of the Canon eliminating the Deuterocanonicals from their Bibles. Even the AKJ originally contained the complete Christian Canon. It has been said by critics of Christ’s Church that the Deuterocanonicals were never believed to be inspired and just the opposite is true. The decision by Christians as to which books are inspired and useful for teaching was decided at the African Synods in the late fourth and early fifth century. There was never a question about their inspiration. <br>  <br>  The OT Canon chosen by the Protestants is actually a Jewish Canon not chosen by the Jews until after the establishment of Christianity as a result of the spread of Christianity to slow the growth of the new group in Jerusalem after the fall of the Temple in 70AD. Until then as I said previously there were many Canons in use. The adoption of the Canon missing the Deuterocanonicals united the Jews against the Christians was decided in the Jewish Council of Jamnia because the Deuterocanonicals referred too strongly to the Messiah fulfilled in Christ. <br>  <br>  Some Protestants will claim that only the Jews have the authority to choose Canon but the Church deferred that decision to Christ and the disciples and it is clear through biblical research, that the Septuagint is the Bible used by the first century Church and quoted in the NT Scriptures. The fact that Protestants choose to adopt the Canon that was approved by the same Jews that accused our Lord that resulted in His crucifixion suggests the source of this confusion as from the father of lies who led the Pharisees to accuse Christ and petition for His punishment. It is another way that Satan divides the body of Christ and separates the faithful denying Christ’s prayer that we all be one in Christ through His Church. The Christian Church has always used the Septuagint as Canon and never the truncated version of modernist Protestants.<br>  <br>  Some Protestants erroneously believe that Catholics added to the Bible with the Deuterocanonicals but this shows an ignorance of their own history and the history of Christianity as witnessed by Christ’s Church. The facts are that the Protestants removed the Deuterocanonicals and even considered strongly to remove some of the NT books currently in use by Protestants and Catholics. Fr. Martin Luther was in favor of removing the book of James because it conflicted with His heretical man made doctrines of the “Solas”, Sola Scriptura and Sola Fide. The heretic Ulrich Zwingli wanted to remove the Gospel of John because of its teaching of the commandment to Eat Christ’s Body and drink His Blood which contradicted his view of a real absence of Christ instead of a real presence in the Eucharist. Even Fr. Martin Luther could not endorse such a departure from Scriptures and deny that Christ is truly and really present in the Eucharist in Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity. <br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr. Joseph|`|wxBFZ41Taa	After what is called the "Dispersion" of the Jews, when the people were scattered abroad and settled in many other lands outside Palestine, and began to lose their Hebrew tongue and gradually became familiar with Greek, which was then a universal language, it was necessary to furnish them with a copy of their Sacred Scriptures in the Greek language. This gave rise to the translation of the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek known as the Septuagint. This word means in Latin "70", and is named so because it is supposed to have been the work of 70 translators who performed this task at Alexandria where there was a large Greek-speaking colony of Jews. <br>  <br>  Begun about 280 or 250 years before Christ, we can safely say it was completed by the next century; it was the acknowledged Bible of all the "Jews of Dispersion" in Asia, as well as in Egypt, and was the version used by Christ, his Apostles and Evangelists, and by the Jew  and Gentiles and Christians in the early days of Christianity. It is the version that Jesus Christ and thew New Testament writers and speakers quote when referring to the Old Testament. The New Testament writers also relied heavily on the Septuagint, as a majority of Old Testament quotes cited in the New Testament are quoted directly from the Septuagint (others are quoted from the Hebrew texts).<br>  <br>  For those who point out that Jesus did not quote directly from these 7 books, that alone is not the criteria for making a book Scripture. Jesus didn't quote from other accepted Old Testament books. Ruth, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs are never explicitly quoted in the New Testament and yet they are a part of the Protestant version of the Bible. <br>  <br>  Sirach and 2 Maccabees – some Protestants argue these books are not inspired because the writers express uncertainty about their abilities. But sacred writers are often humble about their divinely inspired writings. See, for example, 1 Cor. 7:40 – Paul says he “thinks” that he has the Spirit of God. <br>  <br>  The Protestants attempt to defend their rejection of the deuterocanonicals on the ground that the early Jews rejected them. However, the Jewish councils that rejected them (e.g., School of Javneh (also called “Jamnia” in 90 - 100 A.D.) were the same councils that rejected the entire New Testatment canon. Thus, Protestants who reject the Catholic Bible are following a Jewish council that rejected Christ and the Revelation of the New Testament. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://scripturecatholic.com/deuterocanon.html" rel="nofollow">http://scripturecatholic.com/deuterocano...</a><br>  <a href="http://home.inreach.com/bstanley/canon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://home.inreach.com/bstanley/canon.h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catholicapologetics.info/apologetics/protestantism/wbible.htm#CHAPTER%20I" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholicapologetics.info/apol...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2000/0009sbs.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2000/00...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cin.org/users/james/files/deutero3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cin.org/users/james/files/deu...</a>|`|93galWG1aa	I see you are not interested in truth!!!!<br>  and along with those who attack the church without cause or provocation will answer to God for your blatant lies against his holy institution.<br>  Who am I is Absolutely right yet she will be ignored because no truth can be found in you.<br>  Why not research what she said, are you content with the lie.<br>  Every scholar knows Jesus read from the Septuagint all but protestants who follow Jewish teaching that deny it yet the proof is in the scrolls, note they reject Christ too.|`|AyPF2TFlaa	There is evidence as they were uncovered in the dead sea.<br>  seems the Alexandrian Jews read them as part of the Septuagint which is what Jesus quoted from and the Apostles read.

He had compulsions about everything. He was worried about the appearance of things. Meanwhile, he was having sex with other men, behind her back.

I seriously think that things like OCD are a front for people's inhibitions. He might not be a homosexual. But, it sounds like there is something that he might be afraid of people finding out. I gave up many of my own personal demons when I brought the truth to light on certain things.
CEChcfKwaa	I believe Hitler called it the "master race" and no, your deformity would have disqualified you. I don't see why you're getting upset at the answers.

And if you are white, it actually wouldn't be too hard to be a part of the "perfect race you are referring to (dye your hair blond and get blue contacts). If your not mentally disabled, you could technically fit in with Hitler's people. But even without contacts, he probably wouldn't mind for the most part, as long as you marry someone with blue eyes so that your children have a better chance of getting blue eyes.|`|eskZfVBkaa	Yes i'm sure you would have been.

What would it help, to give your parents all that confusion if it`s not permanent?|`|ejuJiZAAaa	go out with me|`|eMSv7RwYaa	I think that in a way being bisexual can be more difficult to tell your parents than if you were gay. When you are bisexual you generally don't feel the need or want to tell your parents until you are in a stable relationship with the same sex and by then your parents have probably just thought you were straight. <br>  <br>  If your parents are open minded kind of people they shouldn't have a problem with it. I reckon you should maybe just bring up the fact that you are seeing someone and get into a conversation about it,eventually you will have to pluck up the nerve to tell them it's a girl.<br>  <br>  once your got it out in the open and they have time to think about it things should be fine and you should feel relieved to don't have anything to hide from them anymore.|`|ZMAOR0A9aa	the best thing to do is write down what your going to say, practice it in front of a mirror a few times then tell them, or what i find best is leave them a note or get them to stand at the door while you say what you need to say infront of the mirror, just imagine your saying it to yourself and its just practice? the sooner you tell your parents the better|`|9gkp06QGaa	Yes be very upfont.

It will seem out of your personality to do such a thing. I think that given time, if you are confident enough to be subtly open enough about the relationship (eg: your partner and you are always going out together, or act intimate) your parents will catch on and the whole confrontation thing will be a breeze. Rather than establishing that awkward "I have something to tell you" conversation out of the blue, it will come more naturally. Perhaps your parents will just automatically accept your relationship, and there will be no need for serious discussion. <br>  <br>  Two.<br>  If you feel the urge to tell them, be upfront and straight to the point. Quick and painless is always the best way to tell someone something. State why you are in this relationship and try not to act like it is a big deal. The more emphasis you put on you being 'different', the less likely they will accept it. The reaction will vary depending on your parents personalities, and perhaps it will be easier to tell them separately. Having a two on one conversation often causes the duo to feel more powerful, so by targeting them when they are on their own at appropriate times will create a more balanced, neutral environment. <br>  The worst thing that could happen is that they do not accept your relationship. Being so prejudice in today's world is a massive fault, so they will just have to learn to accept it. <br>  <br>  The most important thing to remember is that you will not be causing problems to their lives, you will be solving their already existing problems.<br>  I hope all works out for you, whatever you choose to do.|`|ZvF6vZRFaa	well i think that you and ur girlfriend should both sit down together when your parents are in the room and casually just tell them that you are a lesbian and that you hav been going out with your girlfriend for(however long youve been goin out 4) and then if they accept then thats great and if not well if your gf's parents know then just ask if you could stay wid ur gf cause ur parents might hav kicked u out or something. if you are sure that your parents might be homophobic and dnt like LGBT's at all then wait until youve moved out and live somewhere that way wen the day comes that you tell them, if they dont accept you then atleast youll hav a place to liv|`|pNdXCuxzaa	umm.... well<br>  ive been involved in that kind of relationship with a guy.

I understand a follower of Islam is also to know or at least be well versed in the Christian's Holy Bible.  If this true, let me suggest you use the King James Version of 1611.  The old English is sometime difficult to relate to modern English, however is poetic in its style and of great beauty in its truth.  Since its originator, the Living God it is all about, is alive, the Holy Bible is considered organic in that as you read at one time and understand, the next time you read the same passage may give a deeper meaning to you.  I am not saying it gives a different message, just a deeper meaning of your understanding of the topic.<br>  <br>  The Quran, being the originated by men, will not contain this organic feature in such depth.  Man cannot compete with God, but you will find in some passages of the Quran that feature.  I would think that writer is like you, seeing the beauty and has been at the moment inspired.  Good books are like that, a nugget of gold found in the ashes of a man's meanderings or musings.<br>  <br>  By the way, the Holy Bible is the subject of more scientific and scholarly in depth study than any other book ever written.  Of the thousands of studies, not one point has very been found at fault.  It is recognized that 2.5 % is in recopy errors, each have been documented back to the original manuscript and cross referenced.  No context errors have ever been found.  Many wish that were not so.

This judgement can seem to be a rejection of the topic, which may conflict with the views of the audience hearing the "truth" being spoken.<br>  Conflict is always costly.<br>  <br>  For example: <br>  "Greg is a bad person because he consistently does bad things" may be true to you.  A friend or supporter of Greg may hear this comment and disagree.  This friend/supporter may believe that "Greg makes bad choices because he has had few positive role models in his life.  He needs to be encouraged and nurtured."<br>  <br>  Both sides would be speaking "the truth" in their own subjective way, and may end up in conflict over their diametrically opposed viewpoints.|`|C5GnLU04aa	The 'truth' is a double edged sword:  as it cuts {hurts} then it heals.  Sometimes people are not ready for the truth, therefore, people should be careful not to give unsolicited advice.

s3iruA0raa	You are at the age where your body is preparing you for a life long journey.  It's ok to have urges.   Here is the awesome part.....  You have made a conscious decision not to have sex.  Do you know how powerful that is?  You are in an age where sex is just the flavor of the day.  By stating that you don't want to have sex, you are saying you want to remain virgin.  I APPLAUD YOU!  Keep yourself for your future wife, remain pure and you will give her and yourself the greatest gift on your wedding day.  Congratulations and good luck!<br>  <br>  By the way, you will have urges from now on.  Don't feel bad about them.  Show your strength by resisting them.  I know this to be true.  I married at 22 and was a virgin, so was my wife, and we are both very proud to say that.  The strength of a man is not what he can do but rather, in what he does not do.  Be powerful and control your own destiny.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	Sexual urges are perfectly natural for a boy your age, and masturbation is probably the best way for you to control them, and it's also a good way to prepare yourself for when you do have sex.<br>  It's good that you recognise that your relationship isn't ready for sex, it will be so much better if you wait for the right time, and have something memorable to look back on.<br>  I don't know when the sexual urges will die down, I still get them, and I'm 54.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|08QtgdpOaa	Other than masturbation?

g8JGLnk6aa	Well for some people, religion is a big part of marriage. They believe that they have to get married because to them, God wants them to do it. For other people, it's money (marry rich...or, ahem, access to your partner's life insurance).<br>  <br>  Historically, marriage has not been about love. In ages past and even today, many societies arranged marriages, and it was all about keeping the money in certain families. In other societies, marriage was about keeping the power within a certain family (e.g. the royal family).<br>  <br>  These days, marriage is a promise between two people to remain faithful to a relationship. That's really all it is. You find one person, you love them (hopefully, at least), you commit to them and decide to have this commitment recognized under the law so you can get your tax benefits or whatever, and you are (in theory, at least) supposed to stay loyal to one another despite future (inevitable) attractions to the opposite gender.<br>  <br>  I say that if a couple loves one another and decides that they want to spend the rest of their lives together as a married couple, so be it. I know this lovely couple of fellow grad students from school who recently got married. From watching the way they interact, you know they will be together until old age. They are both wonderful, loving people and I look up to them as far as relationships go. They made a choice to stay committed to one another and felt that marriage was the way to go.<br>  <br>  On the flip side, another couple may decide that they love each other very much but opt not to get married. That is perfectly fine as well. Settling down with one person is not for everyone -- hell, some people may find it boring. Marriage is no longer a requirement in this day and age, because we do not have a royal family in power and we do not sell brides -- at least, we don't in the United States. Also, religion is losing its footing.<br>  <br>  So my answer is that marriage is becoming less of a requirement and more of an option. The US is becoming progressively liberal, and so conservative institutions such as marriage are gradually losing ground as a result.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid that you'll have to ask each couple individually why they opted to get married -- there isn't a clear cut, universal answer these days about what constitutes a marriage.|`|cFG8EaH1aa	People divorce too much. Marriage isn't even something that is meaningful anymore, it's just something that most people do when they think they love someone, but they really don;t.|`|uxvskU7Xaa	in todays society where ur word doesn't mean to much-- i don't put much faith in the fact that someone will honor a vow and a piece of paper --- if u truely love someone and urself  u will not need a vow and piece of paper to make a marriage work -- i think its just more government involvement<br>  yes i will probably get married to my awesome bf but i am already commited to him and will not be with anyone else as long as we are together -- the marriage will be just a ritual we are already a couple in a commited relationship <br>  i think a relationship should be what 2 people want if its open thats fine as long as all people involved know the truth<br>  anyway u want to do ur relationship is fine as long as all involved know the truth and are ok with it<br>  no-one should be dishonest or force anyone to be or do anything they do not want to do

1fuuANoraa	Wow, Tom this is like De'Ja'Vu stumbling across your question.  I felt as though I was lacking passion in my own life.  I am a stay at home mother of a 1 year old; lately I started to feel as though my life has gotten to be one big routine.  No zest for life, no interest in going out or doing anything other than the same old stuff (cook, clean, baby duties blah blah blah).  So a week or two ago, I was surfing the web and found this womans self help site.  I bookmarked a page that offers free downloads of ebooks and such.  One of the books (which is a real quick read) is called   Finding Your True Passion.  I read and printed it out and have put it into my routine to  practice one thing each day.  I must admit I fell off the wagon 2 days last week and didn't practice anything, I did notice a difference (and maybe that is what it took for me to realize that it is a good tool for me).  So, give it a look see and maybe it can help you out too.  <br>  The main site is:  <a href="http://helpselfwoman.com/free-downloads/" rel="nofollow">http://helpselfwoman.com/free-downloads/</a><br>  <br>  That specific Ebook: <br>  <a href="http://helpselfwoman.com/f/Finding-Your-True-Passion.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://helpselfwoman.com/f/Finding-Your-...</a>

d063aYOdaa	Due to the complexity of the language, I think it will be very hard to find an online translation program. I doubt that such software can even come into being because the latin language is very "random" due to its syntax and grammar. It requires a human brain to actually "think" and "understand" what the words, the cases and their syntax in a sentence, mean. This happens not only with latin but also with ancient greek.<br>  <br>  But if you want a software just to translate a separate word or verb, then I welcome you to try WORDS.<br>  You can get it for free here:<br>  <a href="http://users.erols.com/whitaker/words.htm" rel="nofollow">http://users.erols.com/whitaker/words.ht...</a>|`|R5UIMBvcaa	I agree with Ricardo.

America is the land of the free, right? well shouldn't gay people be free to get married?<br>  <br>  Im not sure why people hate gays so much. People just hate people who are different.

Just gay sex, which is legal now, so, logically, any objection to gay marriage on a biblical basis is hypocritical because we obviously don't make laws according to the bible anymore.<br>  <br>  The only good point i've ever heard (and i'm stretching the word good here) against gay marriage is that gay activists claim that we are not equal because we don't have the right to marry, but nobody has the right to marry somebody of the same sex (gay or straight), so it's not an issue of equality because we technically all have the same rights.<br>  I like that argument because it's logical, as opposed to ... all the other  ones.<br>  My argument against that point (because i obviously object to it) is that not allowing gay marriage is discrimination because it is blatantly disregarding the legitimacy of our relationships (gay relationships). That is to say, it's not "equal rights" because we ARE different and ignoring the fact that we are (i'm talking about gay people, not bisexuals) incapable of loving somebody of the opposite sex is an insult and a pathetic attempt to ignore our identity and the truth behind it. Also, given the fact that homosexuality is legal makes it hypocritical because they've acknowledged our existence, but are still ignoring it.|`|jaMq6rGuaa	I think that its more of a traditional problem with me.<br>  <br>  <br>  That god himself WANTED marriege to be between a man and a woman, he never said anything about 2 of the same sexes.There for, going against God completly.<br>  <br>  But I'm not the one who has to answer for it.I'm not the one who will have to stand up against God, and explain why I did something he told me not to do.<br>  <br>  So I really don't care.|`|G6BG7id2aa	uhm, the same reasons that they didn't interracial marriage

Satan is also a Jinn and not an angel.|`|PExIfZxxaa	They did prostrate but this prostration was not in the form of IBADAH like we do to Allah,it was just to show them the superiority of men over angels.Second thing is that it was ordered by Allah Himself.<br>  <br>  This prostration of the angels before Adam was a sign of honor and respect and out of obedience to the command of Allah. Qatadah commented, 'The obedience was for Allah and the prostration was before Adam. Allah honored Adam and commanded the angels to prostrate before him.' [See at-Tabaree (1): 512]<br>  <br>  Salam|`|UhyvM73iaa	Angeles never committed shirk or worshipped any one other than God.<br>  Angeles are not capable of disobeying God.. They do not have free will to worship other than God.  They are programmed to obey and worship God  only, They are created from light and most probably their bettary is charge only with light of Sun. . Allah knows best. They do not eat, sleep or get tired. They do not get married and have no children. They are like robots and are eternal. They do not die unless wants to put one to be unfunctional.  <br>  Shaitan who disobeyed God is made of fire. He is one of the jins who have free will to worship God or disobey God. That is why Iblees got <br>  arrogant thinking he is made from fire and Adam was made from dust, so he is superior than and should not prostrate to Adam.. Jinns mary and have children also. Their are good jins and bad jins. On the day of Judgment jinns will face Allah for their actions just like humans will. Many jinns worship Allah after hearing Prophet Mohammad teaching Quran to humans. <br>  <br>  Christians are misinformed about Satan. They call him Lucifer.<br>  They think he is one of the Angeles That is wrong. If he was Angeles he couldn't have disobeyed God.|`|SCkhQc2Caa	Prostrating is of two kinds:<br>  <br>   It may an act of veneration and drawing closer to the one to whom one prostrates. This kind of prostration is worship, and should only be done for Allaah, according to the laws of the Prophets.<br>  <br>   The second type is a kind of greeting and honouring a person. This is the kind of prostration which Allaah commanded the angels to do in the case of Adam, so they prostrated to him as an act of honouring him. It was an act of worship towards Allaah on their part, because they were obeying His command to prostrate to Adam.<br>  <br>   The prostration of Yoosuf’s parents and brothers was also a prostration of greeting and honouring, which was permissible according to the law (of Allaah) at that time. But according to the sharee’ah brought by the Seal of the Prophets, Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), it is not permissible to prostrate to anyone at all except Allaah.<br>  <br>   Hence the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If I were to have commanded anyone to prostrate to anyone else, I would have commanded women to prostrate to their husbands.”<br>  <br>   The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbade Mu’aadh to prostrate to him when he (Mu’aadh) said that the People of the Book prostrated to the great ones among them, and he mentioned the hadeeth quoted above. <br>  <br>  The prohibition in this sharee’ah against prostrating to anyone at all except Allaah is an aspect of its perfection in achieving true Tawheed. It is the perfect sharee’ah whose perfection is manifested in all its rulings. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<br>  <br>  “This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion” [al-Maa’idah 5:3]<br>  <br>  [ Shaykh ‘Abd al-Rahmaan al-Barraak]<br>  ________________________________|`|qky7gWosaa	No, because Allah Himself commanded them to do so.<br>  <br>  Angels are a special creation of Allah. They have been created from divine light (Noor) to perform specific duties. Allah gave Angels the qualities and powers necessary to carry out their duties, but they do not have free will. They always obey Allah and can never disobey Him. Angels do what Allah commands them to and they are the sinless servants of Allah's will. The Shaaytan was a Jinn - Jinns have free will.

Stay professional in the work place, don't make customers feel awkward, and for the love of god, don't stay friends with him.

If you combine red, green and blue LIGHT, the result will be white. You can try this yourself by getting 3 flashlights, and covering each one with a different primary-color cellophane. When the beams from all 3 flashlights meet, the light will look white. And, of course, when you turn all 3 beams off, the result will be darkness, or "black". <br>  <br>  This is also the theory behind RGB color palettes.<br>  <br>  Edit: Sorry, to answer the question, no. Black is technically not a "color"; there is no such thing as black light waves. It is, as Prok said, the absence of all color.|`|XDbC2Di1aa	Technically, black is the absorption of all the visible wavelengths of light, so it doesn't reflect any back, and therefore, we see "black".

On their identification cards (internal passports), one's ethnicity was listed as "Jewish", which was a separate identity from "Russian."<br>  <br>  The people in charge of the Russian Revolution were not primarily Jewish. Sure, there was a disproportionate number of Jews involved, they were fighting against the tsar and his disproportionate anti-Jewish policies, such as requiring Jews to live in the Pale of Settlement, or the periodic pogroms.

Everyone says that their pains are so much worse than the pains that they commited. Example would be about the indians. I agree, what we did to them was atrocious, we took their lands, killed and raped many of their woman, and forced them to live on lands that they didn't like. The lands were not sacred, were often not fertile and we left the indians with no means of income but casinos. (Life was harsh before there was discrimination laws.) What do people not know? Many indians captured and sacrificed other tribes, killing them off before we had guns and the like which would at least, do more dmg so the pain was worse but death was quicker.<br>  <br>  Overall, this was a quick topic discussed in school and brought up in my philosophy class. How do we fix the ethnic pains we caused those who we consiered inferior? We cannot look back and send an I'm sorry letter to every mother whos sin or daughet was kille dby anyone. <br>  <br>  We cannot step back in time and say hey, look, we can't exterminate them so lets get along! What we CAN do however is look at our failures of the past an dleanr how to prevent the  for out future generations. If cultures stopped satying poor us and they reache dourt to help their neighbors and we helped them and ourselves, we would have a better world. Overall, this questioning of how we can complain about our own pains and not take into the account what we have done is not helping any. <br>  <br>  Lets stop whining, not build a pretty monument and realize that the past is the past. We live, we die, our families grieve, time goes on.|`|cutzr7gGaa	Were those christians protestants....? Good for the jews

sohnrZDcaa	That's nothing! Aaron put together an idol for Israel to worship and Moses ordered that the Israelites DRAW THE SWORD AND KILL each other brothers until about 3,000 got killed in punishment! (Ex 32:25-28) THIS IS THE MOST STUPID STORY THAT THE WANKING BIBLE WRITERS EVER CAME UP WITH! Now this queer God kills a couple of guys because he doesn't like the way they lit some candles!<br>  <br>  Moses identifies himself as the meekest man on the Earth... He wrote so about himself in the first 5 books of the Bible!  <br>  <br>  Numbers 12:3 Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth. <br>  <br>  Can you imagine Jimmy Swaggart writing in his biography, “and the man Jimmy Swaggart was very meek…” and so on? <br>  <br>  The first thing that we know of this Holy and meek “LAW GIVER” in the Bible is that he stabbed in the back an Egyptian foreman because he was rough on the Jews! Moses became a fugitive of the Egyptian law for 40 years until his return to Egypt to take Israel out of it. There is not a trace of historical evidence that it ever happen, but what the heck! He sought refuge in the kingdom of Midian. If Moses ever had to kill anybody without mercy including innocent babies and pregnant WOMEN he did it because God (NOT SATAN, but God!) made him do it! So when he came up with the, “Thou shalt not kill” commandment it was more like a big finger salutation to the Egyptian foreman that he murdered with God’s blessings, of course! The Bible God ordered Moses to slaughter everybody including babies and pregnant women in the Palestinian region, to make room for Israel! Praise the LORD!<br>  <br>  Numbers 25:16-17 (NIV) The Lord said to Moses, “Treat the Midianites as enemies and kill them* (*Zipporah, Moses’ first long term loving wife was a Midianite. God is providing a way for Moses to get rid of a wife! Or am I wrong? Actually the Bible God has people slaughtered just for the heck of it, too!)<br>  <br>  Numbers 31:17-18 (NIV) Now kill all the boys* (*Moses loving children were Midianite citizens born in Midian!). And kill every woman* (*including Moses mother in law and any other in law female relative!) who has slept with a man* (*ESPECIALLY PREGNANT WOMEN, but spare the Virgin Mary if you spot her! God the Holy Ghost got her pregnant and that is OK! Still all pregnant women who obviously slept with a man must die! The SOB Moses and God couldn’t care less about any fetus!), BUT SAVE FOR YOURSELVES EVERY GIRL WHO HAS NEVER SLEPT WITH A MAN.<br>  <br>  Isn’t this Bible God so sweet to the Holy Predators? And who says that God promoted pedophilia and the killing of innocent children and women with a fetus in their womb is a sin!? In Midian alone the glorious ARMY OF THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY collected 32,000 little innocent virgin girls for their own pleasure! PRAISE THE LORD! Sweet Jesus! Amen? (Num. 31:35)<br>  <br>  MOSES IS THE ENVY OF ANY SEXUAL PREDATOR IN THE WORLD TODAY! After this episode in the Bible stories that hardly any Christian reads it became a routine in Israel to kill everybody even when fighting among themselves, but to always spare the YOUNG VIRGIN GIRLS as war trophies for the pleasure of the obedient soldiers of the glorious ARMY OF JEHOVAH GOD…! A team of avid Levite Priests was always at hand to use their big fat fingers in the inspection of all the little girls to see if they still had their hymen intact. Like in Christian America around election time… nicked and butterfly hymens don’t count and the girl was slaughtered on the spot! Praise The LORD! Sweet Jesus! Isn’t that what PURITY BALLS are all about? Any of those girls could have been your own daughter, but what the heck! Even God the Holy Ghost abused the Blessed Virgin Mary with total immunity! Hardly any Christian pay attention to what they read in their Bible… to the great relief of the Clergy! <br>  <br>  Judges 21:10-11 (NIV) So the assembly* (*Israel leaders) sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to Jabesh Gilead AND PUT TO THE SWORD THOSE LIVING THERE* (*they were God’s chosen people of Israel too, but they disobeyed God!), INCLUDING THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN. “This is what you are to do,” they said. “kill every male AND EVERY WOMAN WHO IS NOT A VIRGIN.”<br>  <br>  The glorious ARMY OF GOD ALMIGHTY killed all the Israelites (his own chosen people) residents in the town of Jabesh Gilead, except for 400 young virgin girls (Judges 21:12) that they rounded up so the male Israelites from the tribe of Benjamin could replace the wives that were slaughtered earlier by the same ARMY OF GOD ALMIGHTY. The Priests of GOD were there to make a full check of the little girls’ tight vagina to certify that each one of the young girls was still a virgin... Come on… it won’t hurt you! They probably said most lovingly before poking their big fat fingers to find out if their hymen was still intact! Today, some discreet preachers can only masturbate dreaming about God’s provisions for his chosen people…! <br>  <br>  BTW... Moses’ father in law Jethro was a Heathen priest in Midian, but he was exempt from being slaughtered with the rest of the Medianites! Jethro was very helpful to Moses taking Israel out of Egypt! The Midianites gave Moses not only a loving and faithful wife, but food and shelter. Moses lived 40 years with them and raised a family with at least 2 kids that we know their names. Moses had a lot of friends, too, but at the Exodus time God decides to KILL EVERYBODY IN MIDIAN including Moses’ wife’s family except ONLY for the young virgin girls that were spared for the exclusive pleasure of God’s chosen sexual predators… oops… sorry… CHOSEN PEOPLE...! AND MOSES DOESN’T OBJECT OR QUESTIONS GOD AT ALL like he does in so many other cases on any trivial issue, but in full cold blood Moses orders the killings to proceed as planned! In fact, he was very upset that his orders were not carried out immediately! Whoever wrote these stories in the Bible were about the most vicious wanking perverts concocting their primitive idea of a God that is unlike anything ever published in any smut magazine today! Christians swallow all these stories as their daily bread and want to make sure all our kids in public schools read the Bible! All the preachers know what needs to be discarded of the Bible to make a living out of Christian gullibility! It is amazing the ability or rather brainwashing that Christians developed to totally ignore all this smut in their Bible! <br>  <br>  MOSES IS HIGHLY HONORED FOR BETRAYING and slaughtering his Midianite friends and relatives, but then God gets mad at Moses because he struck a piece of rock twice instead of once so God wouldn’t let him set foot on the PROMISED LAND and made him die before reaching his final destination! The Bible writers say that the Archangel Saint Michael and the Devil were tearing Moses body apart on a fetish of some sort! (Jude 1:9) <br>  <br>  Christians must be totally void of moral values to believe all these obscene stories in the Bible! That’s probably why most Christians buy the Bible but hardly read it! Can you imagine a revised XXX rated EXODUS movie telling the whole Bible story on the Exodus following the whole Bible script? Christians still love the Bible God the same way the Nazis loved Hitler…!

I had to do a bit of research.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Okay <br>  Exodus 4:24    Apparently it wasn't Moses that was about to die because he had just received a commission.  However, Moses didn't circumcise his son, something that ALL Israelites were supposed to do.  And since he was headed toward Egypt to be with his people it was obvious that he planned to live with them again.  (BTW The circumcision was their covenant with God)   The fact that his mom quickly did this shows that she knew what was wrong.<br>  <br>  Further down in Leviticus:<br>  <br>  “Do not drink wine or intoxicating liquor, you and your sons with you, when YOU come into the tent of meeting, that YOU may not die. It is a statute to time indefinite for YOUR generations, 10 both in order to make a distinction between the holy thing and the profane and between the unclean thing and the clean, 11 and in order to teach the sons of Israel all the regulations that Jehovah has spoken to them by means of Moses.” <br>  <br>  And their family could not carry on the grieving rituals (much more than tears) becaus|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Aarons two sons knew the law by heart they deliberately broke the law and they knew that the punishment was death.They wanted to do things their way a thing that they had not been commanded thus taking a rebellious stance against God.Ex 29:10-46  <br>   Ex 30:26-38  God emphatically impressed upon them,as well as upon the entire nation,the vital importance of respecting the sanctity of the things related to his worship,including the altar of inscence and incidental equipment.their lives depended upon them respecting the divine regulations.As for Exodus 4:24 God told Moses to tell Pharoah Israel is my son. Israel as a whole was his chosen people or his son.He sent the word to Pharoah,if you don't let my son go I will certainly kill your firstborn.Bringing to mind the fact that God has never executed any person or nation in all the history of the Bible records without giving warning first.But Pharoah would not comply.he had held them in slavery for 400 years an evil thing,but if he would have turned around history would have been different.Just as what happened with Jonah and the Ninivites.|`|iblT1HJpaa	Look above and see what you get on this site!<br>  (ignorance) <br>  <br>  The answer to Bible questions is usually answered in verses just before or just after what you seek. Such is the case here. <br>  The sons of Aaron (priests) were called to a higher authority over the people and in taking "fire" from a place other than the brazen alter they were defaming God betraying carelessness and irreverence. <br>  They had to be punished to show all the priests what would happen when you went against God. <br>  You need to realize that the Law was not this thing to be taken lightly for in it the people were proving to God that they loved Him and would be obedient. <br>  It all looks so silly.....can't have these shrimp, can't work on certain days, say prayers just so.........it's all about obedience. You either do what God says or you die. <br>  Do you think God has changed? Well, NO! <br>  Except we live in the time of an atoning Savior, Jesus Christ. He is our Mediator to stand before us and God and allow us to have life even in the face of utter sin in the face of God. We are "saved" because of Jesus Christ. Not so, the people in the OT and continuing, not so the Jews of today. They do not accept Jesus as the Christ and as such, have no mediator between them and God's wrath. Unlike so many people of today, the Jews KNOW who Jesus is and reject the capstone. <br>  The Chosen of God has shifted and the Elect are those that elect Jesus as God. <br>  <br>  Sorry to go off on a tangent there. Please. If something does not make sense - look forward - look back.........the answer is there for you to figure out. THis is why the Bible is not an easy read. This is not Dr. Suess. It's God speaking to you and He's DEEP!
AA11100707	GREAT question! Just two days ago I stopped at my local Giant grocers on the way home....a stop I make most days...as I tend to shop daily or every 2 days. <br>  <br>  I still smoke and stopped at the service counter to get a pack and when I started to leave to go get in the cashier's line, the manager said "Do you think I'm going to let one of our best customers have to stand in line for those few items?

It's his reparations-driven socialist policies designed to keep those on the dole on the dole, and those working hard, working harder.<br>  <br>  Are we to pretend that EVERYONE on welfare "wishes" they had a full time job? What's the point there, beyond total denial? There are neighborhoods from the Atlantic to the Pacific, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf and all points in between, populated by people who DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GET JOBS. These just so happen to be the high crime areas. Gee, what a coincidence!! <br>  <br>  I don't think so! If Obama really gave a rats' tail about this country, he'd knock that chip off his shoulder, put his bitterness into check, and start holding people accountable FROM THE BOTTOM, UP!!<br>  <br>  Before looking to tax the elites even more than they already are, as a government, we need to start mandating full time jobs from all those on the dole fully capable of working.<br>  <br>  I haven't watched a word of Obama. Not during the campaign, not on election night, inauguration day or at any point thereafter. I also don't think that poking fun is going to get anyone anywhere.<br>  <br>  What we need is a national referendum demanding that this administration STEP DOWN AT ONCE.

AA11879371	I have heard of yellow journalism and biased reporting.  These are belief structures of a culture and society.  I don't consider myself a feminist, but leaving the care of women, in this situation, to men, is detrimental to their life, health, and mental welfare.<br>  <br>  It's not right to treat mothers of men in this manner.  Why do you think Islam in America is being coddled?  Willful mistreatment is generally punished here, if it is reported.|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	What are YOU on? O_o|`|CEChcfKwaa	I don't know where you got the idea that feminists support the oppression of Muslim women at all. We speak out against the atrocities against them all the time. You need to do some research about feminism before you make such mistaken assumptions. Many feminists are also Christian or Muslim you know. Not all Muslim countries are extremist in their views towards women. Your rant is very biased and wrong in so many ways.|`|GJ3tNgWNaa	I really believe that you are over doing this.  First off, do you even know what you are talking about?  No feminist that I know of ever said that Sharia was great for women.  Many feminist who I have known served in the armed forces and in Operation Enduring Freedom (the operation to over throw the Taliban)  The ACLU is not pushing Islam at schools.  I work in a school and no child has ever been compelled to pray on a carpet and Christian religious groups meet before and after school on school grounds.  Please stop watching Fox News.
T1beLIQqaa	That is the current THEORY.DNA(haploid) testing is now able to tell different ethnicities-this is what the human Genome Project is all about-to answer your question-GET A DNA test for each subject.Until 11,000-13,000 years ago-EVERYONE had a golden brown skin tone and either black or brown hair and eyes-different color skin, hair, and eyes than these was actually due to a genetic mutation occuring at that point. I like the old thinking of the anthropologists, that the 5 ethnicities started at different points-that is how they maintained their ethnic traits, not the out-of-Africa Theory. Incidentally, out-of-Africa does NOT mean everyone was Black or descended from Blacks. Two forms of Homo sapiens(modern humans are a subclassification, Homo sapiens sapiens-the human race-only one), both extinct, existed at the same time-Idaltu(had N*egroid features) and Cro Magnon(had Caucasoid features. Neither had a racial classification. Both had a shade of brown skin and black or brown hair and eyes.Human ancestors before this, had more of Idaltu's characteristics.Ethnic lines are becoming more and more blurred as we become a more blended society.United we stand, divided we fall. Here's to a more united, blended world.If a superior ethnicity existed-that person would have the most desireable characteristics of each of the ethnicities.A pure ethnicity such as Hitler's Aryan blond, blue eyed Whites would have bred themselves out of existence due to "replicative fading"(genes become progressively deteriorated like copies, of copies, of copies of papers) and inborn genetic errors. This would be from a limited gene pool-incest and inbreeding-this is exactly what is happening with the big cats today.|`|JGGbQhCaaa	In addition to the "out of Africa" migration theory of world population, there is the theory that there were concurrent emergences of human populations in various locations, which many people feel is a form of denial regarding the African theory. At any rate, the physical differences are largely due to environmental conditions over great periods of time. We will probably get more info on genetic varieties, too, as that field of study becomes more accessible to the average reader.  Peace.<br>  <br>  Addendum (for Jayne S & others):<br>  If you know how to read between the lines and behind the lines of the Bible, you will understand that the Adam & Eve allegory is situated in Africa. The description of the location of the garden is Africa.|`|JqDqfz0Saa	I don't know if that's true. I think we all started as blank slates...I mean.

Maybe asian needed their eyes to be squinty where they live, so over time they adappted to that!|`|I7vU1AlKaa	No it can't be true, at the risk of sounding like a racist which I can assure you I'm not. Africa is a cesspool where countless atrocity go on (so sad) where even today,  they capture slaves and ethnically cleans entire tribes with vicious barbarism on a grand scale.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying white people haven't done these things, they have! Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Spanish conquistadors 50 million plus. <br>  <br>  But now whites are  more civilized, we have learned from the past, and don't want that same brutality.

It's likely that the first Africans resembled the current Europeans (first humans appeared around 200,000 years ago), while those who stayed back in Africa changed due to the Great Warming. <br>  <br>  <a href="https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com" rel="nofollow">https://genographic.nationalgeographic.c...</a>|`|qL7R2wBfaa	i heard that theory and in my oppinion is that it's bs, why would all humanity start in one place? and why there?|`|1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	Yes, humanity started in Africa.

You would have to spend many hours studying this in order to have your question answered thoroughly.

But it was during the times of foreign occupation that the idea of a Messiah raising Israel up to conquer her enemies was most popular. The Christians believe Jesus is/was the Messiah. Most believe him to be divine in some sense and to be the king in a future heaven/place/etc. This is contradictory to Jews though. They do not believe the Messiah will be divine in anyway. They believe this is a contradiction of their strict monotheist beliefs. They also believe that the Messiah will be a mighty earthly king that will reinstall Israel as a great military power and bring about world peace.

The Jews of that time developed that theory that a messiah would come to take them out of their misery. (The Greek word for messiah is kristos, which comes into English as christ.)<br>  <br>  Over the years, there were many men who claimed to be prophets and/or the messiah. For one reason or another, the Jews rejected them. Then Jesus was born and for some reason, his teaching caught the imagination of a group of Jews who became his followers. (Note: these people were Jews, as was Jesus.) And the rest, as they say, is history.<br>  <br>  I have no idea why Jesus fulfilled the requirements and others did not. I also have no idea why he fulfilled the requirements for some and not for others. I've merely told you a little bit of the history.<br>  <br>  By the way, the question is not about god.

xi19aSjvaa	You are absolutely right in saying that Christians can't just sin whenever they want. Yes, it is true that when Jesus died on the cross for us, it covers all of our sins, if we believe in Him. But the word believe means more than just believing that Jesus exists and that He died for us. Believing means trusting Him as your Savior and Lord. Accepting Jesus as savior and Lord is the only way to heaven. A person must realize his sinful state and ask God to forgive him of all his sin and to ask Jesus to come into his life to be your savior and Lord. You must also repent (turn away from your sins) for Jesus to come into your life to save you. Obviously, as you mentioned, nobody is perfect and even then you will still sin, but you shouldn't want to sin once you've been saved. The Bible clearly states in verses such as John 3:16 that once you've been saved, you will always be saved, no matter what you do. But that doesn't give you the security blanket to go sinning whenever you want. There are times when Christians (people who are saved) will backslide and start sinning more, but that person will always eventually turn back to God. A person who "claims" to be a Christian that continues to sin like it's nothing, likely is not saved to begin with and needs to go to Jesus for repentance. Hopefully this answers all or most of your questions.|`|14N0VbH5aa	Because they don know the true meaning of the  crucifixion of Jesús.<br>  <br>  They also dont read anything else, except what they want other people belive for the monetary cause of that ''evangelists''.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  -Revelations 3:11<br>  <br>  They dont want people know that verse because that  is less $$$ for them...|`|3xlDwlkhaa	Regarding Sin -<br>  Sin is a social construct to define what and what are not inappropriate actions and behaviors. In the realm of God there is no such thing as sin, only inappropriate thoughts which lead to inappropriate actions and behaviors. Sin must be learned; religion teaches sin.<br>  <br>  Innocents are free of sin because they do not know what constitutes a sin. The first humans tasted of the Tree of Knowledge and so became aware of inappropriate thought. This was the first instance of free will - the ability to choose what to think about a situation.<br>  <br>  God granted the ability to choose between appropriate and inappropriate thought. Definitions of appropriate and inappropriate, however, are human creations. Religions have a vested interest in teaching sin - without sin, there is no need of forgiveness.<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  <br>  Forgiving the innocent -<br>  Jesus is aware of a higher set of behaviors and so is able to petition God's forgiveness on behalf of those who are unaware of or who are unable to adhere to higher levels of thought regarding God. The idea is one of liberation. A person believing in Christ's intervention can go about his or her life knowing that even if a transgression is unknowingly committed, the petition to God is taken care of. This answers the famous 'If a baby sins' question. However, individuals are still responsible for transgressions they knowingly commit.|`|8IHfytEvaa	I agree with what you are saying about Joel Osteen.<br>  <br>  However, I would not put Billy Graham into the same camp.  Billy Graham and I teach that one must repent from our sins in order to be saved and if we really are saved we will not live a life of habitual sin.<br>  <br>  Romans chapter six teaches against the idea that once you are saved you can sin all you want because you have the "get out of hell free" card.<br>  <br>  Yes I agree many do water down the Gospel.  I've heard Joel Osteen do that on Larry King Live, but I've never heard Billy Graham water it down.|`|94ba0e23758532d348f3c7f676048970aa	If a person who is truly saved will put off the old man and put on the new man.  Then the person doesn't want to sin, and keep sinning to hurt God.  Too many people out in the world have the view that you say.  Read Ephesians 4 & 5, and also Colossians 3  We are to be seperated from this world.  We are not to do the things that the world says is okay.  We are to do what the Bible says.  There are many people out there that are playing church, and just pretending to be a Christian.  If a person has God in their heart they will become more like Him.  Just because Jesus died on the cross for our sins, it dosen't give us the right to keep sinning.  Paul talked about that also.    Romans 6:15  What then? shall we  sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?  God forbid. Also read Romans ch 6.  That tells the truth.  Some pastors says it is okay to keep going we are under grace.  It is true we are under grace, but if we don't keep a short account of our sins then we will answer to them in heaven.  We will sin each day, but if you are truly of God, you wont feel right about sinning.  We will not be perfect until the day we are in heaven.  Until then we must walk close to the Lord.  Only the Holy Spirit can help us.  He lets us know when we do wrong.  But if a person don't read the Bible and know right from wrong then they will be judge for that.  We can't use the excuse I didn't know.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Jesus did pay for all sins past, present, and future.  Jesus doesn't make "partial" payments.  He paid for all sins in full.  And when a person believes in Jesus alone for salvation, then that person WILL be in heaven, no matter what (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  Now, here's good reasons to avoid living a life of sin: <br>  <br>  1)  Sin brings problems, and the Lord might choose to discipline the sinning believer (Hebrews 12).  That discipline will never include hell.<br>  <br>  2)  The believer that wastes life in sin might lose rewards in heaven <br>  <br>  3)  The believer has infinitely better things in his life, making sin a waste of time.|`|IIxy6ATwaa	Read what the Catholic Church has to say. The truth in its fullness and entirety is preserved and practiced only in the Catholic Church. Jesus' death on the cross has redeemed us of our sins.

Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means!" - Romans 6:1-2<br>  <br>  Just because Jesus provided for our eternal salvation by paying the penalty for all our sins, it doesn't mean that we can sin all we want with no consequences.  We don't have a "free ticket" to sin because by continuing to sin and live apart from God we will be disciplined in this life and miss out on eternal rewards in the next.  This is not how God wants us to live, he provides salvation so that we are able to grow and learn to live differently, as a child of God.  <br>  <br>  Still, nothing we do can threaten our eternal salvation, because that was never up to us in the first place.  Whether we sin a little or sin a lot, we are ALL sinners who deserve condemnation because we have violated the righteousness of God.  That's why Jesus came to pay the penalty for us.  It is just a matter of accepting it or not.|`|twVyisGnaa	While it is true that Jesus died for our sins, that doesn't mean that humanity can sin and stuff.

If this was not so, then you could say the prayer and then curse God, and live out the rest of your life just like you did before and still go to heaven. That is a ridiculous idea and borders on blaspheme. <br>  You MUST live your life as close to Jesus as you can, and when you slip up, you must repent.|`|AKFlMCToaa	Friend,<br>  <br>  All of these are very good questions and deserving of some straight answers; however, you aren't likely to get them from most of the churches.  If you think you can handle it, I will give you a little help.<br>  <br>  A little history is in order.  The Church of God (there is only one) in the Book of Acts came under severe attack from two directions.  First, there was the Jews who wanted to reinstitute the Law of Moses (circumcision and all of that).  Then, there was the pagans who wanted to do away with the Law of God altogether.  Well, the pagans won out, and what we have today in modern "Christianity" is about 90% pagan doctrines.<br>  <br>  Chief among these is a misunderstanding of God's Grace.  It is taught today that Jesus Christ did away with God's Law, which is not true.  Following immediately behind this is the teaching of "once saved, always saved," which is also a false doctrine.<br>  <br>  The Apostle Paul wrote that once converted, we should not continue in sin (Rom. 6:1-2).   The Apostle James wrote that it is not enough just to believe in God that faith also comes by works (James 2:18-19).<br>  <br>  Jude wrote that the Grace of God was being turned into license to sin (Jude 1:3-4).  Paul wrote that the mystery of iniquity (lawlessness) was already at work in his day (II Thess. 2:7).<br>  <br>  The sacrifice of Jesus Christ will pay for sins, upon sincere and honest repentance.   All of the Apostles taught that it is possible to fall from grace because of sin (I Cor. 9:27).    Jesus Himself taught this (parable of the talents - Matt. 25:15-30).<br>  <br>  Anyway, you are on the right track.  Never compromise.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|UOBvuImUaa	It has to do with the false teaching of once forgiven always forgiven or just confess & you will be ok . It gives no reason to act Christ like .<br>  Go do what you like , you need no conscience , confess & you will be ok .<br>  Why does the bible teach to change & avoid sin , if being saved is that easy .<br>  These teaching give no reason to be decent people , & they say atheists have no morals.

Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2.

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46).

In fact, the top two killers were specifically atheistic states (which had never existed before in human history). <br>  <br>  Should atheism be blamed for more than 50% of the atrocities committed during the 20th century? The answer of course is No! If one examines the nature of the regimes that committed these atrocities (even the religious ones), the key factor is absolute power (see Figure 1, right). <br>  <br>  According to Professor R.J. Rummel, in the 1816-2005 period there were 205 wars between non-democracies, 166 wars between non-democracies and democracies, and 0 wars between democracies.

Why doesn't He stop it?  Can He or is He weaker than we think?  Suffering can fall into three simple categories: emotional, mental, and physical suffering.  But, there are a variety of causes for suffering:  morally corrupt (evil) people, disease, earthquakes, floods, famine, etc.<br>  <br>  There are different explanations for why God allows suffering, but none of them can satisfy everyone.

It comes with the territory!<br>  <br>  You probably heard the name of "SLAUGHTER HOUSE RELIGION" given to Christianity. ALL Christians need to snack God the Son Jesus Christ in some way as part of the “salvation” package. Jesus talked about eating his meat and drinking his blood to have “eternal life” <br>  <br>  John 6:53 (Infallible King James Version) Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you (DUCK!), Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man* (*Jesus Christ), and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.<br>  <br>  It takes years of Christian Bible schooling to learn how to do it just right or Christians can get real sick and die! Protestants have relaxed this warning, but Catholics still believe that the Host* (*wafer) and Wine is magically transformed into the ACTUAL Meat and Holy Blood of Jesus so extraordinary measures are taken after Mass to monitor that no trace of the body of Jesus Christ is found in any spent chewing gum stuck under the church pews! I AM NOT KIDDING!<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 1:29-30 (infallible King James Version of the Bible) For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep* (*have died… hey… any little bit of Mafia talk helps to shape the faith as Christians go!).<br>  <br>  The Bible story says that most of the Jewish followers of Jesus wouldn’t stomach so much grossness and quit following him. The Bible writers still had the idea of having Jesus’ meat beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit as the dignified “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world” while grotesquely hanging totally naked nailed to a Holy Cross! There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed any of their victim’s genital area in a white diaper before hanging them on any cross no matter how holy! In fact, there is no record that the Romans crucified anybody in Jerusalem outside of the Bible record, either. The Romans were known to IMPALE their victims driving a pole into their rectum and making them stand on it until after a few days later when the thick pole reached the heart or lung killing the victims by their body weight! Jesus hardly suffered a sissy man’s death hanging from his 2 nailed hands. BTW, it is a SCIENTIFIC FACT that no human being can possibly be hanging any length of time by their own weight nailed to a “cross” while conducting a long conversation with his peers on the other crosses about the philosophy of life like Jesus did! Anybody with any measurable IQ can tell you that! This fact alone proves the fact that only a bunch of perverts could have possibly dreamed up a religion like Christianity! Spiritually speaking, of course! Today ALL Christians and Catholics snack on Jesus’ spit flavored Meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Sacrament of the Holy Communion to go to Heaven when they die! <br>  <br>  There is more brutal violence in the Bible than in any TV show. The Bible writers have this God character rewarding people committing the most heinous crimes as long as they do it to further his cause! Islam copied the same idea from the Bible! All the Bible writers picked heroes based on their past bloody criminal performance like Moses, Samson, King David, Saint Paul, just to mention a few. Even the King James Version of the Bible promotes the killing of infants in its fullest CONTEXT! Most Fundie Preachers on the low end of the IQ scale will tell you that the Bible is full of parables and that it can’t be taken literally... short of seriously! It takes many years of schooling and practice to become a professional preacher! They ALL learn how to cover up, give thumbs down and explain away anything objectionable in the Bible! The Bible is obviously of human origin.  Making a statement that it was dictated by a “God” who claims to be full of wrath all the time is an insult to people with a respectable IQ!<br>  <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 - O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us- he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  The Bible teaches that the enemies of God ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them (Amen?)! The old Bible strategy of birth control is not abortion, but the killing of infants AFTER THEY ARE BORN and before they grow up and become a menace to God’s chosen people developing WMD or what have you that not even God can defeat!  (Judges 1:19)<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus Christ says in his apocalyptic REVELATION for the last days) I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD* (*Just for the heck of it! No abortionist can beat Jesus at killing babies! (Amen?!) This time it is Sweet Jesus killing the innocent children to announce his 2nd coming and at the same time to teach everybody in the Churches a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Jesus would be in jail for promoting the KILLING OF CHILDREN to favor a particular religion. That’s why the Preachers are so selective in what they teach from the Bible! They came up with the PRO-LIFE bit on their own to dissociate themselves from this REVELATION, and from the routine slaying of children in the Bible, and what’s even grosser yet about cooking and eating them for dinner! All this forced on God’s chosen people for his pleasure! Christianity is a slaughter house religion. No question about it! The Bible writers were very creative about how to call religious people’s attention!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.* (*Not even the Mafia bosses measure up to this Jesus Christ in the Bible! Christians may expose the Mafia, but they surely LOVE JESUS! And they cover up for him!) <br>  <br>  The story of Jesus was written long after he died (if he ever existed!). He is said to be the greatest religious teacher ever known in the world. Jesus suggested the slaughter by drowning in the middle of the sea of anybody causing a Christian who is a moron in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6). He also suggested the voluntary shedding of offending body parts like an eye, arm, leg or what have you to follow him (Mat 18:8), including male castration (Mat 19:12). Anything to make it into the Kingdom of Heaven! Today no teacher cares to be as great as Jesus was or he/she may end up in jail! Most Christians today don’t pay attention to Jesus Christ’s gory suggestions, but throughout the Christian dominated Dark Ages some prominent clergy persons castrated themselves for the “Kingdom’s sake!” Many “witches” and slaves were abused and killed here in this ONE NATION UNDER GOD, too! (Google “Salem witches” and “castrati” in Wikipedia!) So good luck to all of you Christians in your quest for the truth and intellectual satisfaction… or are you after the peace of mind that only religion can offer? Even Jesus says in perfect King James English, “Thou shalt know the truth and the truth shalt set thee free!”|`|AA11952133	Only when I wake up in the morning.|`|ohSqBO4Taa	Only for the next 4 years.|`|v93v1LPoaa	a question that needs an answer<br>  and not another question..okay??|`|YI8V5e36aa	What kind of question is that?|`|Cld0jeiXaa	This life is all we have and what we make of it.

Satan and hell are real and once you sell your soul to the devil, that's it. That's final for eternity and there's NO turning back. Is that what you WANT? If you're in drug debt. and need lots of money or just want to have lots of money and be rich, pray to God to get you out of that mess, not the Devil. The Devil HATES mankind and wants to try to get as many human souls into hell as possible. Why? Because misery loves company. Salvation and Heaven are 2 of the most greatest gifts that God gives to us in life. Why don't you do something brave and courageous today? Why don't you sell your soul to the Lord Jesus instead? Say to him "Jesus, please come into my heart today. I will sell my soul to you today, Lord Jesus, and ONLY you -- if you get me out of my drug debt.

fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	To use God's name carelessly and without thought is certainly to treat God's name as if it had no meaning.

Specifically the commandment which states "You shall not make wrongful use of the name of your God" This generally meant cursing, which in practice goes something like this "May God strike you down". <br>  <br>  Merely saying "Oh God" is not even in the same ballpark.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	You are using God's name in vain any time you are using it without the intention of using His name in devout prayer. So, when you devoutly say "Oh, my God, thank you for the A on the test," then you are not using His name in vain. But when you use His name as you did in your example, "Oh my God, I got an A on the test!," then yes you are using His name in vain.|`|kjFjGrOvaa	Yes it is because unless you are talking to God you are using his name in vain. You would not say Oh mom I got and A on my test unless you were talking to her. So unless you are informing God that you got an A on your test you should not say it. I usually say oh my gosh or something else. Thanks for asking the question. May God bless you.|`|AA12189772	No.  "God" isn't a name, it's a job title.

They all just include the title 'God' - and a name is very different from a title.  Using God's name in vain would be to say: "Oh, Jehovah curse my neighbor for having a better-looking car than mine." or perhaps "Yahweh damn it,I lost my keys", as those are names of God rather than titles, and their uses here are trivial.  Jehovah is the most accurate translation into English from the Hebrew tetragrammaton (four letters representing God's name in ancient scripture), and Yahweh is simply the most proper translation into Yiddish (Jewish) from the original Hebrew.|`|sCMVyUvVaa	Personally, I don't think so. I mean, technically, it is, but the commandment (Exodus 20:7 You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain for the Lord will not leave him unpunished who takes His name in vain.") is actually used to mean if you're making an oath to God, it'd be in vain if you broke that oath.<br>  <br>  There's a pretty long answer in the link below, if you're interested.<br>  <br>  When you and I say it, we're not consciously thinking 'oh, my god, look at...', but we are just saying it.|`|t3b9M0B0aa	There are many ways to use the Lords name in vain and "Oh MY G...." is one of them because your saying it without reverence just to make a dramatic point.

To better understand what using it in vanity you need to understand the word vanity.<br>  <br>  vain:1.without effect or avail; to no purpose<br>         2.in an improper or irreverent manner<br>  <br>  Does saying " Oh M G..." meet the qualifications of vanity? YES|`|0nZVVuvZaa	Your friend is right. God's Name Is Holy, and we are not use It in vain(emptiness). Do you know God? Are you in a close relationship with Jesus? We Christians call His Name when we want to praise Him or are asking Him for Help, or talking with Him (praying). Is this how you're using it, or just saying "oh my god" as an expression?

zsZGepwLaa	You are the parent and legal guardian of the child. it should be the decision of the parents not the inlaws.

Children have not sinned.|`|mr0Hb5fvaa	baptism is not meant to be just a tradition. in a way your in laws are right. the bible talks about baptism, not as something that saves you, but as something you do in order to symbolize your new life in christ. that means your daughter has to be old enough to decide she wants to accept christ.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	The decision belongs to you and your husband. <br>  <br>  As a Catholic, I believe she should be baptized. It does not remove her free will, she can do what she chooses when she grows up, but it does join her to God's New Covenant in Christ, and it washes her of original sin. Both these things are important for Catholics and your husband's family should respect your beliefs.|`|dDprsKZYaa	Your in-laws are right. Let the child make her own decisions when she is old enough to do so.<br>  You should ask yourself WHY it is so important to you that she be baptised.|`|9J8ciEwWaa	Hi Lana,<br>  I hope I can help in someway alleviate your worry. There is not Biblical command to baptise your child. This custom is actually from a pagan religion way back in Babalonian early cultures. Christianity brought in the custom because it was believed that baptism was a regeneration of the soul. <br>  It is not scriptural! Does that help you in anyway?<br>  <br>  What Christian babies should have is a dedication to the Lord..a blessing where family are simply prayed over. When the child is grown and has had the chance to decide for themselves to follow the Lord they are then baptised as adults by full immersion of water.<br>  <br>  The whole Baptising children custom is not what Christ exemplified, although families were baptised together on occasions but this infant baptism to cleanse your child of original sin was only begun to be practiced in the 2nd century. In fact Emperor Constantine made it law or death if you didnt have your child baptised but it was through his desire to mix paganism into his new found faith of Christianity.<br>  <br>  I urge you to do some on line research into the history of infant baptism. Its not practiced by all Chrisian churches.<br>  <br>  Heres an exerpt from Wiki (not always reliable but in this case i`m using the listings of churches who practice and dont practice infant baptism, anyone who finds a discrepency please do correct me).<br>  <br>  Most Christian churches practice infant baptism.[1] Among them are the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, the Anglican Communion, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists, the Assyrian Church of the East, the Church of the Nazarene,[2] the Reformed Church in America,[3] the United Church of Canada, the United Church of Christ (UCC) and the Continental Reformed.<br>  <br>  Groups within the Protestant tradition that reject infant baptism include Baptists, Apostolic Christians, Disciples of Christ, most Pentecostals, Mennonites, Amish, Community of Christ, Plymouth Brethren, Seventh-day Adventists, most non-denominational churches and other Arminian denominations. Infant baptism is also excluded by Jehovah's Witnesses, Christadelphians and Latter-day Saints.<br>  <br>  <br>  So...you are not commanded to baptise your child, many dont.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could reach a acompromise and ask your Christian minister to simply bless your child, pray over you all as a family and later once she has matured and understands, sha can be baptised by choice?<br>  <br>  Your Buddhist family I hope would not be offended at a simple blessing of your daughter for your sake and your beliefs.<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|8NHNNvl3aa	I honestly think that the child should be calmly taught about many world views as she is growing up. But what is of utmost importance is that she understands that there are many world veiws, any and all of which hold possibility of truth, as small as that possibility may seem.|`|v93v1LPoaa	you're the parent..<br>  you're the boss not them<br>  tell them to shut up|`|2NAfoYRwaa	I think it is great you want your daughter baptized, and your husband should support you.  I also think you should explain to your in-laws that just because she is baptized it doesn't take away her ability to choose what she wants to follow when she gets older, but that it is a major part of your beliefs.  Have you tried to explain to them why you want her baptized? Even if they do not agree, it is still your right, and your beliefs!  Do It if you feel comfortable!!   I did the same thing and had my 2 kids baptized into a religion that the rest of our family is uncomfortable with, I didn't invite them to the baptism out of respect for both their beliefs and ours.  I explained why, and did it.  They were upset but understood if they were in the same place, they would've made the same decision.|`|I9WjPm7Caa	I am Buddhist. My wife is Catholic. Our child will be baptized.<br>  <br>  If Catholicism is right, then being baptized will make our son part of their spiritual community and help him later on in life, and possibly after death. Plus, it will make my mother-in-law happy.<br>  <br>  If Buddhism is right, then baptism is meaningless mumbo-jumbo that does not affect his later life either for or against. But it will still make my mother-in-law happy. So as  a Buddhist, how can I refuse to let happiness reign?<br>  <br>  Children WILL make their own choices one day, whether we think we will "let" them or not. As your husband illustrates, we no longer inherit our religion along with the colour of our eyes.|`|O5h1pgdbaa	First of all, thats why it is not a good idea to marry someone of another religion. Unless you dont have children. If you do they end up in the middle of lots of conflict.<br>  <br>  You need to teach your daughter about God now and as she is growing up. You cannot just wait til she is 18 and let her pick. It is your responsibility to teach her, not everyone elses. She will get enough outside influence that you will have to correct.<br>  <br>  Personally, I believe Jesus is the only way and I would direct my actions accordingly. Buddhism conflicts tremendously. All religions are different. Having said that, all could be wrong, but not all could be right. They contradict each other. In Christianity you are saved by grace. In all others you are saved by works. Because of sin we all fall short.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, you are in a position where you want them to comprimise, you may have to compromise a little also and allow her to learn about Buddha, if his family persists. But if your husband believes in God you will have it much easier, after all it is yours and his child not great grandmothers. And, using her philosophy, he is over 18 and can choose for himself. If your husband believes in God he should stand up for you.<br>  <br>  Baptize her if you wish but most importantly teach her about God. Pray for her to find the truth.

5vYyIflCaa	"Hosay or Tadjah is a West Indian street festival, in which multi-colored model mausoleums are paraded, then ritually offered up to the sea, or any body of water. Some contemporary writers equate the multi-colored mausoleums with "mosques." In British Guiana, now Guyana, the festival was called Taziya or creolized into Tadjah in reference to these floats, the most visible and decorative element of this festival. In nineteenth-century Trinidad newspapers as well as government reports called Hosay the "Coolie Carnival."[1]<br>  <br>  The Hosay (derived from Husayn or Hussein) celebration is a Caribbean manifestation of the Shia Muslim Remembrance of Muharram in Trinidad and Tobago[2] and Jamaica[3] (where is it spelled Hussay). The name Hosay comes from "Husayn" (also spelled "Hussein", the grandson of Muhammad) who was assassinated by Yazid in Karbala. This marytrdom is commemorated in the festival. In Trinidad and Tobago it is primarily celebrated in Saint James, in northwestern Trinidad and in Cedros in southwestern Trinidad. Recently it has been revived elsewhere.<br>  <br>  In the 1950s, very elaborately decorated models of mosques made of paper and tinsel called "tadjahs" were carried through the streets to the accompaniment of constant drumming. Small fires were lit in the gutters beside the streets over which the drumskins were heated to tighten the drumskins of the tassa. Mock stick fights celebrate the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali. The festival lasts three days ending with the throwing of the tadjahs into the sea at sunset on the third day. Although Hosay is a religious event for Shias, all of Trinidad's religious and ethnic communities participate in it, and it has become accepted as part of the national culture..."|`|NsHV4O8oaa	are you referring to <br>  no way hosay?<br>  or some other hosay?
