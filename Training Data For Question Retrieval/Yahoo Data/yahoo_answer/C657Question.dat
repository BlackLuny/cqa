20090203145147AAzuL2l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm 19 and in college, why haven't I ever had a boyfriend?	Not to sound conceited, but I would consider myself to be friendly, outgoing, attractive, and funny. I have never had good luck with guys and have a hard time getting their attention. I'm afraid that I'll be alone forever and never experience love. Why haven't I found someone yet? I'm not asking for a husband, just a guy who likes me and I like them. Any advice?

20090203150904AAH3CtJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Can someone please tell me how to set this strait?	There is this kid on my bus who is a total a**hole!!! He always bothers me, but I try to ignore him when he does. But today he went to far: I was listening to my ipod when he started to hit my head with his phone ( let me tell you that this guy is tall and ONE GRADE AHEAD OF ME!!!), and I had just had it. When I turned around to yell at him, he SLAPPED ME ACROSS THE FACE! I wanted to kill him, but part of my religion is never to harm anyone. Then my friend went and told the bus driver. He got a detention, but as I left the bus, the driver told me that she had written me up too. I didn't even do anything! So now I got my first detention ever, everyone thinks that I tattled ( even though it was my friend ), my brother wants to kick this kid in the nut sack, and I 'm deathly afraid of telling my mom cause she will go make a big deal of this to the school.       CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME HOW TO SET THIS STRAIT?

20090203151321AA3S87j	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should i do?! helppppp!?	the girls on my track team and i used to be really close but one of the seniors has some sort of problem with me and now no one talks to me like they used to. i'm on varsity and i don't feel like part of the team anymore. it seems like she turned everyone against me. i really love running and i hate feeling like this.      also, i'm injured and i can't run for a few weeks. now 4 of the girls on varsity are doing really well and might go to a championship meet as a relay team. i was supposed to be on the team but i can't because i'm injured, so one of the girls took my spot. it seems like everything is falling apart and i don't know what to do. i feel so worthless not being able to run, and it's even worse because i feel like the girls don't want me there anyway.

20090203151251AAzW9bX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Since my divorce ive done a 180, have you experienced anything like this?	Background... i use to be the silent, unsure, and nervous nice guy. then i got with a girl that i thought was my one true love. turns out instead of honoring her vows, she would rather have affairs, get pregnant by other guys, emotionally abuse me and take my son away from me (now court resolved).       This has caused another part of me to open up that i never knew existed. i have done some asshole things recently that i guess you could label me as the bad boy, or jerk type. the bad thing is im actually enjoying it, and even worse im good at it. i dont really have much remorse and think its all games (which confuses me). i wouldnt want to label myself as a womanizer, or a guy that treats women like objects, but i could see myself being labeled that by other people.      so out of all the things that could of happened, why did this side have to come out because of the past experiences, and why so much fun and excitement from it?

20090203151622AAL5hBr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think it's the right time to move in together?	Today is mine and my boyfriend's 8 month anniversary.  I'm in college and he is working, but his lease is up in May and my new apartment lease starts in May.  Convenient huh?  He has requested that we move in together.  Looking at it on a financial standpoint, it makes perfect sense.  Suddenly my rent will be cut in half, which is a drastic savings.  Our relationship has been going very strong for 8 months and I'm at his place every weekend.  Do you think it's the right time?        I would love some advice from people who have had a similar situation.

20090203151400AAjxea4	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Maid of honor question?	so my sister just recently became engaged and i was not asked to be her maid of honor... instead her friend from college. My sister and i aren't super close but we stil talk often, i do live on the other side of washington but i feel that's no reason as to why she wouldn't want me to be her maid of honor. I know that having you reading this isn't all to the story but i just want to know if you would be hurt... ive been crying about it all day wondering why i am not "worthy enough" to be an important person in my sisters wedding. My sister is the type of person who demands perfection and wants her wedding to be top knotch and perhaps she feels as though im not the best candidate but i still dont think that's an excuse, were family and im her only sister!!! it hurt even worse when i found that things were being planned without me, and that i was the last on the list to know.. my family is angry at her and now i feel bad that im being a burden to her wedding...

20090203151314AAaXyQt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I tell my husband I want to add myself to his savings account?	We reside in California, and my husband just opened a savings account in HIS name only.  He says he's using it for finances when his older children (my stepchildren) come to visit from out of state.  That's fine...BUT, what if my husband and I get a divorce?  Will this account be considered as "community property" or will he ONLY have access to the money? ...Even if it is considered as community property, he can easily take most of the money out of the account without my knowledge before the law requires him to split it.  I want so badly to tell him that I want my name on this account, but I haven't worked up the nerve yet...He tends to "dance" around certain issues and I never seem to get straight answers from him...EVER.  He's a pretty chauvinistic man, and if I "speak up", tensions arise in the household for the next few days...I have two children in the house, and they don't need to go through that.  Does anyone have any sound advice for going about this kind of situation?  Thank You.

In 1996 my husband had a vasectomy and in 2001 we got together. At first he said that he wanted to get a reversal and have another baby with me, we already had 5 between us......but now its not even an option. He is 12yrs older than me and just turned 40 and says he doesnt want to be going up the school to collect his son/daughter only to be called their grandad rather than dad.      I love my husband very much, but I really want to have a baby, and my feelings for wanting a baby is more than needing my husband....is this wrong?

I work nights and get on very well with a male colleague, he has made it clear that he likes me alot and there is chemistry between us, I can't stop thinking about him, but nothing would ever happen all while I,m with my husband....I,m confused as to whether it is a real chemistry between us or the fact that he can give me what I really want at present!!!!

20090203152400AAT7K0u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I over-analyzing this girl's stares?	So in history class my friend and a girl I think is really cute sit next to me. Nearly every time my friend starts conversation with me, the girl will stare at me even when we don't talk about anything interesting (which is 3/4 of the time, lol). I also sense her looking at me a couple times once the lecture starts. But I have a feeling she thinks I'm looking at her when I'm in fact, really not lol so ... yeah =/ not sure    Is she staring for a reason or is it just she's interested in what I'm doing? I don't see what's so interesting about watching me do other homework in my other classes. I would understand if she stared a couple times, but it's nearly every day ...    And no, I don't find myself attractive but I don't think I'm too horrendously ugly either. I'm afraid I'm over-thinking these instances and over-interpreting them with the hope that she is looking at me out of interest, when in fact, she's just interested in what we're talking about ...    EDIT:: She seems like a sort of shy but friendly and outgoing girl toward everyone (yeah that's a contradictory way of describing her, but it's hard to explain), and on some days she won't even pay too much attention to me in the first place
20090203152905AASwd2h	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Am I wrong for not being engaged or married?	I'm just wondering here.  There's plenty of people my age engaged or married.

20090203152237AAVe6H2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I allowed to give up on love?	If I have not had any luck in love, and if I have not been on a date for a few years, is it OK for me to give up hope and just quit trying?  What's so wrong about that?  Women do not find me attractive or interesting and aren't interested in going out or getting to know me.  I am coming to accept that.  I know my social skills aren't honed, to say the least.  I'm a little shy and socially a little awkward, and honestly way too cerebral.  When I do ask someone out that I know, which is rarely anymore, I am always turned down.  What's wrong with me taking that as the signal to just quit?  Where's the rule that says I have to keep going through the punishment?  I can enjoy some things in life alone, I've been somewhat doing it for awhile now.   Note:  I can get dates with older women that are divorced that have kids by a few different fathers.  It's not like I have to go womanless.  They do show an honest interest in me.  However, it's pretty tough for me, usually, to deal with their kids, and sometimes with them and their issues with men that have used them.  I deal with kids all day long, then to have to deal with 3 or 4 needy, dadless kids in my off time is just more than my sanity can bear.  Sorry, I just can't go there.

20090203153524AALEFsY	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad is kinda creeping me out...?	I'm 14 years old and my parents are separated. I live in NY with my mom and brother, and my dad lives upstate.      And well, I'm kinda... scared... I might be over reacting, but I think my dad is interest in some form of an incestuous relationship with me.       There are several things he has said and done that really... really weirds me out and leads me to believe that something is going on:      -He likes to make comments about certain parts of my body. Mostly my breasts, and my curves. -shudder-   -I went to the lake upstate with my mom and brothers to visit him, and when we were going home, we kissed goodnight or w/e, and he said,   "That's how you kiss boys? That's cute. Keep doing it that way." ....wtf   -He got drunk on New Year's, and was very, very physical towards me. Lots of hugging, affection... it was awkward.   -He likes to IM me on AIM A LOT to ask me about things... and tell me he loves me... I mean yeah I love him too, but I can't help but what think what his intentions are or what kind of "love" he means.      In short, I'm afraid of being within five feet of my dad. Should I be scared, or am I freaking out over nothing?
20090203153820AA5IF0Y	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm feeling trapped in this relationship, what should I do?	We've been together for a little over 4 years but it feels like we are Married. Over the past few years that we have known each other, our entire lives have been cemented around each other. We aren’t living together, but we are always running errands together, staying in together, going to plays together, etc. Neither me or my boyfriend have our “girls/guys night out” since it is just me and him all the time. Our relationship is almost codependent… For example, I slowly lost contact with all my friends prior to dating, and now I don't have any friends to talk to except for my boyfriend's brother's fiance, or his sisters which I am very close with. This man is great to me and gives me the world, but when I search my feelings I know that I am not in love with him--I want to let him go so he can find a woman that can love him as deeply as he has loved me. But I know if we do breakup, my life will be miserable since I won't have any close friends to turn to. I don’t even have any siblings to turn to. What should I do since breaking up with this man will result in loneliness for me, or should I just stay with my boyfriend? I know it sounds like I am being selfish, but I really need advice since I have no one to turn to. But what do I do when I have nobody to turn to except people that are related to my boyfriend?

20090203153733AAbfrn4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What if my friend likes me? he has a gf?	my friend who is a year older than me is in my spanish class. i just think of him as a good friend. he always talks to me over messaging and through texting. it's usally not flirting, at least not on my part, and i wouldnt have guessed he liked me. my friend whos in the same spanish class as us told me she thought he liked me (just by guessing). i said "no way were just friends". every few days he drives me to get lunch since i can't drive yet, and sometimes i catch him looking at me during class?? what am i supposed to do? does it sound like he likes me? his gf goes to the same school but she knows were just friends and is usually hanging out with her friends.
20090203153136AAZ1uHI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help, Im having a problem with my friends...(plz read all details)?	Well ive been friends with these three kids,harrison, steve, and Rich, since like 2nd grade. I am in 8th grade now. Last year i fought a kid named Kyle at the top floor of the Hyatt hotel.

Kyle went to Mexico for the entire summer and when he came bakc, he started talking to steve and rich and theyy all became friends, only harrison stayed away from him.

20090203153404AA1kBbW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Question for the ladies about dating.?	Are most guys nice or jerks on a date. Be honest and tell a short explanation, if you have time.

20090203154620AAcoVwf	Family & Relationships;Family	I blew up at my mother?	To be brief, since this did not post last time.   I'm 20 yrs old.   I take 16 hrs this semester.   I quit my job to pick up more school.   I live with my parents.   My father is in iraq.   My younger sister is out of school and just got a new job.   My younger brother is in highschool, has a job, and has a car.   He also got a dog a couple months ago.  I don't know why, because we already had two and the five of us barely had enough time for them.  We always took care of them, but were not able to give them enough attention.     We have an invisible fence for them, and it works rather well.  The problem is my brother takes no responsibility for his dog.  He is always conveniently short on money whenever something is needed for his dog, such as toys, food, etc. even though our mother said she would pay him back.  as a result the dog chewed on everything, until our mother finally got him some toys.  I had to go get food.  The batteries on his collar went bad, and i notified my brother because his dog was roaming the neighbourhood.  After at least a week of my brother never having money and my mother swearing she would get some, i went out and got them, only to come back to the house to se that the dog chewed up a necessary component to the collar.  I let everyone know that they must go outside with the dog until we can get a new collar.  And these collars are expensive.  Well my sister never listens and continued letting the dog out unsupervised allowing him to roam the noighbourhood and get in peoples trash.  This happened before, when my brother first got him, and now this woman is threatening to call animal services.      My mom told me what happened and told me i needed to get the dog a collar.  She always pays me back for such things, but when she does is anyones guess. i asked who was outside when it happened and she said nobody.  I got mad and said " I can't be the only one doing this (being responsible)."  yelling started and she walked off and i screamed "He's not my f---ing dog."  I never use profanities toward my mother so this shocked me probably as much as it did her.        This afternoon i found out my mother has neumonia, bad, and won't stay in the hospital, even though her doctor ordered her too.      What should i do?
20090203153155AABPN0R	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this mean? please answer . ?	im pretty much always the first one to text or IM my crush.( i dont do it constantly though, im chill about it. like ill text him and we keep that text going til we hang out, then after that a day or two later ill text him) im not naggy about it.       but whenever i ask him to hang out hes always down and we already made plans to hang out again. but why doesnt he ever text me first?

20090203154614AAzSqJ4	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Ladies what do you think: should I ask FMIL to get involved?	We announce that we are engaged and she seemed pretty happy about it...she even sent a card congratulating us and saying its about time!..we were dating for 7 years and ...(yea i dont know why she sent it, we live 8 block away)       anyway...we were over at her place and told her that we are having a small wedding and small reception just family and close friends..so nothing big...so im sure i can plain it all myself..im not even having bridesmaids or anything like that..its a 25 ppl thing..so my question is: should I ask her for help if i need to go see vendors or dresses or anything like that.or her opinion on something?..i moved to this country 8 years ago and my mom passed recently so she knows i have no family to help with the planing...she hasn't offer help, so i dont want to assume she doesn't want to..we are not very close...but we get along and never had issues with her...but dont you think its weird that she wouldn't even tell my fiance if we need help with anything..(im not talking about money btw) i dont want money i think i'd like support...so what should I do?
20090203154456AA55nTs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I dealing with a player    ?	I think I may be dealing with a player?    He is really nice, and I have a small crush on him. Everytime he sees me he comes up and talks to me and sometimes sit with me. Today he quietly walked up and sat next to me, when I looked to see who was sitting next to me, he just smiled and said hey. Then we just started talking.    Here's why I think he may be a player.. He has a myspace and on it his top friends consist of like 5 girls and 3 guys. All his comments are from girls saying we should hang out. Song lyrics for him, a lot of talk. The girls that he has are like 2-3 yrs younger than him (we're both 18).    Am I being overdramatic? Or is he a player?

20090203154857AA5yzNq	Family & Relationships;Family	How do you feel about your father if he is not involved in your life?	My father hasnt been in my life since he cheated on my mom when I was 2 weeks old. (He probably cheated during her whole pregnancy). I am 20 now and have seen him maybe about 15 times in these 20 years, the last time being at age 16. He called me when I was 16 and told me he was sorry and that he would make up for lost times and we would become close, guess what, he never called me back and he changed his number. I have so much hate for this stranger. I have kids now and can not imagine not being involved every minute of every day. I want nothing to do with him except for one thing. I want to let out all my anger on him. I want to ask him why, and punch his face off!! I was told he has cancer now and cant even build up enough feeling to care. Then I was told, (by his son he had with the woman he cheated on my mom with) that my "dad" lied about cancer to see if we'd look for him. How do you feel about your dad for not being there? Do you ever wonder why he was never there? Do you ever wonder if he even so much as thinks of you? I have 2 kids and still it proves that he wants nothing from me. What an ahole!!
20090203153157AAamXsK	Family & Relationships;Family	Can children ever forget/forgive their father for leaving when they are young?	I was happy my dad left my mom in 1982. He wasn't a good father. I was 13 and my sister 6 and my brother 8. My brother had the hardest time with it and went to move in with my dad.  My dad remarried in 1982 and my mom in 1989.   My husbands children are 23 and 21. He left when they were 5  and 3 because he was using drugs and met someone else.  After many years of non contact with them because they moved far to his ex's parents house I told him to contact them.  He felt guilty because he wasn't a good dad but I told him it's not that late...   3 years ago he saw his daugther and she acts loving to him but the ex tells him she takes it out on me saying where has he been all these years.  His ex is having financial problems.   I think his daugther being 23 years old should kind of get over this by now and stop fighting with her mom.  He told me his 21 year old son is more level headed than the 3 of them.   I never met them and they do not want to meet me.   My husband is 49 years old and knows he made a mistake but many men leave their families and now he is trying his best.   Any suggestions

20090203153253AA3wOA6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am not sophisticated? PLEASE ANSWER! what do i do?	My boyfriend says I'm not sophisticated! I heard him talking and I said to myself a million times that I am sophisticated. But my mind said "no way, take a look yourself" he said. I asked my friends "Describe me"      They said fun, crazy, modest.   but they didn't say "You are a serious person"   I talk sophisticated, trust me. But I'm not. (If you noticed, not always)   But mostly yes, but there are so many fun things out there, I avoid the boring stuff.   I haven't been talking to my boyfriend for 2 days. He hasn't called. And It was all after the thing about me being not serious.                  So, how do I become more serious and sophisticated.   He said exactly: Well, she isn't that sophisticated, Taryn is, more of a 'fun all the time' kind of girl. What do you think? I don't know about her."   He was talking to a friend. *sigh   And then I slowly left all :(      so you understand what i mean.
20090203154928AAp3Tx3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this guy dumping me? Why is it so?	Sorry this is long. Thanks for reading.      This guy knows how i lost my virginity to a player just a month ago and he said he likes me while I was still having a hard time getting over that player. I originally told this guy I won't like him. But he didnt quite give up his chase. I avoided him. He then went to a short trip. I started to miss him and tried to reconcile our friendship or "relationship", but he said his crush was pretty much over and the whole situation instantly seemed upside down, that is, i was becoming the desperate one, finding him much more aggressive than before. But he just acts colder than the time he chased me.      I finally told him i wanna meet up. We did, and we ended up having some intimate hugging, but he seemed really into me again after all these and he kissed me. But I was not comfortable with the kissing, (there's always a part in me that knows what in him i am resenting). and I told him frankly afterwards that i dont want to date yet. He was in rage when i told him that and he left me on the train. I was utterly shocked and begged him to talk to me. And to stop him from being sad, i agreed to be his gf, even though i know i would be "sad" ever since.      So, we had a second makeout, only this time my body language was a lot more defensive. I refused to kiss him and only kiss when he initiated. I kinda pushed him away sometimes. I said nothing throughout the process, which is very not Me. Then he said he is bored and he sent me away (not in a rude manner though.) Then, we had a cold war period of one week. And he suddenly texted me one day saying that "both of us" should have an answer about our situation. But when i asked him about his thoughts, he either evaded my questions or replied with nonsense answers. I pointed out how illogical his answers are and he kept evading me again.       And now this dude....I REALLY DUNNO WHAT HE IS THINKING!!!!!!      He kinda told me that he can't be with a girl with so low self-esteem and said he sometimes found me boring (but he used to said he was very happy when he was with me)      Is he "breaking up" with me because I didnt sound like i want to have sex with him like i did with that player??? If yes, this would be a very disgusting reason...      I AM REALLY CRUSHED.      I thought i would be relieved when he seemed to be ending our bf gf relationship that lasted for only 2 days, but now i am like dropping into an abyss. I absolutely can't handle these 2 guys in a row....      I just texted him several times and called him twice but he never replied. I said i queued up to buy a gift for him and he gave no replies.
20090203154324AAS8s0l	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Am I wrong to forgive my fiance for cheating on me?	He asked this question:  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...       I'm forgiven him mostly because I love him and he's always been there for me. I'm still punishing him in my own way because I'm angry he got her pregnant. I'm not allowing him any physical contact, he's even sleeping on the sofa.   We've been together nearly 8 years and we are meant to get married in late march. He's twin brother thinks I should have broke with him. But how can I throw away something that I've been so involved in for so long. I've been through so much emotionally with him and I feel if I was to loose him that I'd become emotionally unstable again because I do rely on him quiet a bit.      Am I wrong to forgive him and just give him a 'light' punishment. He's only getting contact once before our wedding when his punishment is up and that will be valentine's day just because I've had everything planned for ages. His birthday is before our wedding and he's not getting anything. Is this a fair punishment?

20090203154456AAYRCYx	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Still love my ex and can't let her go, any help?	My ex-fiance broke up with me two days after Christmas. I still love her, but she doesn't love me in that way anymore.      We are still close and we need to be because we have kids together. She still lives with me, because I want to know she is safe.      I am in no "financial" position to seek out another person I could love, or would love me back. Not to mention I get horny as hell, and every time I can't have her, I get stressed like hell.      Now there is another guy in the picture that she has said she has feelings for, which I don't believe is as true feelings as she thinks. Not to mention I know this type of guy to be dangerous, they aren't dating or anything, but I can't stop her from falling for him.      I want to know she is safe, but everyday I see her I feel even more rejection and heartache. But since I don't have cash to spare, I can't even take a girl out just to have fun, or anything and it is driving me nuts. She is the only one I have for any compassion or sex, but being without her, without anyone else in my life, still feels worse than just taking what I can get from her.      Any suggestions!?

20090203154221AAGdMzV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What are the divorce statistics?	One of my friends recently got engaged. I want to be happy for her, but I don't think she's making the right choice. She recently turned 25 and her fiance is just 26. They've been living together for 14 months but moved in together after just four months after they started dating! He was really hung up on his ex before they moved in. She says the rule is if you've been dating a year and you're 25 or older then you get married but I think that's crazy! They don't have anything solid in common and both have had serious relationships break up in the recent past. Not to mention they both have divorced parents. What are the statistics for a marriage between them to last?

20090203153139AAR7HEz	Family & Relationships;Weddings	What should I do about my parents CONTINUALLY bashing my wedding plans?	Okay, so my fianc and I were actually planning to get married this upcoming June (2009), but my parents (mostly my dad) made such a big fuss that they had to be canceled several months ago.  We had planned a destination wedding in the Caribbean with around 10 people and had planned to have our reception when we returned to the States.  He just "absolutely" couldn't handle traveling that far for a wedding and thought that it would be too much for my mentally handicapped brother and sister.  This I sort of understood and took into consideration.  Since he and the rest of my family were one half of the 10 invited guests, we had to abandon those plans.      Now, we are starting to plan again for a wedding in May 2010 but he's at it again.  We decided to stay in the US and in-state this time, but the wedding is still 250 miles away.  We currently have a guest list of 120 people, but he has told me numerous times already that "probably only 20 people" will show up because of the distance.  This really breaks my heart.      To top it all off, everything we propose (food, cake, music, etc.) gets shot down because he has a very specific idea of how a wedding should be.  I think the whole problem is that he wants my fianc and I to have our wedding where he and my mom live, but that is not where my life is.  Half of the guest lists lives close to my fianc and I and half live near my parents.  He also thinks we should have a simple wedding as opposed to the one we have started planning.  We are not having a platinum wedding by any means, but at the same time we are paying for the wedding and would like to have what we want.    Anyway, sorry this post is a million miles long, but I am really upset.  I don't want to give him an ultimatum, I just want him to understand that all the things he says to me are upsetting.  I really wouldn't mind compromising on a few things, but at the same time he cannot monopolize MY wedding.  How do I tell him this without him getting too defensive and upset?    Thanks in advance for all your help!

20090203155257AAZItt6	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What is the best way to deal with a workaholic co-worker?	This person always comes in early, works through breaks and often lunch, too. He doesn't talk to anyone and constantly out-produces, out-performs everyone so of course some of the managers think he is just golden. I know this sounds like I am jealous, but mostly I am annoyed. I'm not a slacker, but I have no desire to be like him. Those breaks are there for a reason and I take them so I won't get burned out and too exhausted to do my best. I know this is a mental thing, this insecurity, because I do my work well and don't goof off and must be doing the right thing or I would've been out a long time ago. How do you deal with someone who makes you feel like a slacker when you know you aren't?

20090203161039AABxGt3	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Advice for "big sister"ing two young girls?	In my community there are two young girls, ages 8 & 10. Their father is disabled, and mother is in prision. They are being raised by their 18 year old brother who has dropped out of highschool and got a job to support them.    My sister and I have donated as much as we can, clothes, purses, money, etc. The girls have been wearing their brothers' clothes.       My sister and I would like to "big sister" them, give them some older girls to be around since their mom isn't in the picture. However, my sister and I don't have disposable funds, so we can't take them bowling or shopping. We'd like to do something though.    Can you reccomend a good activity to start out with? Preferably something cheap/free, and still fun for girls their age?      Thanks so much!      I'm 20 and my sister is 17, if that matters!

20090203162339AA73gQK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	We are going to marriage counseling?	There are no major issues in our relationship, no mental, physical or substance abuse.  BUT we can hardly discuss our issues without the conversation turning into a heated argument, many times ending with anger and belittling each other.  I have calmed down since we had children and so has he but still I can't discuss something with him without him getting excited, raising his voice and getting very offended.  I just want someone to teach us how to work through issues by communicating without escalating and never getting any results, can a marriage counselor teach us that?  Is this not major enough of an issue to go to counseling for?      Oh we argue about his mismanagement of money, irresponsible behavior when it comes to driving drunk or staying out too late when he promising to get up with the kids the next morning and we argue a lot about parenting techniques.      He goes out about every two weeks, usually poker game or to watch a game at someone's house.      I go out once every 4-6 months or so.  I come home sober and at a reasonable time.

20090203162824AAG9rYw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to find meaning in life when there isn't any?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

20090203161925AA0T9pk	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is This Considered Friends With Benefits!?!?!?	My boyfriend and i just broke up and we dated for a little over 6 months. I broke up with him because i just needed to focus on school and i didn't want a boyfriend at the time. We talked it out and we are now  best friends and talk every day. He still loves me and is waiting for me to be ready, and i still love him. Is it wrong that we kiss each other good bye still? Its just like a quick peck its not like we sit there and make out or anything. My friend said it looks like we are friends with benefits but i don't see whats wrong with it because its just a reminder that we still care.

My boyfriend and I haven't even been going out for 2 months yet, but we've been dating for about 2 months before we were official. So its kinda like 4 months. Anyway, I've been thinking about having sex with him, but I don't know if it too soon. I'm only 17, and I've never had sex before, and I don't want to make the wrong choice. I feel like I'm ready... but I've heard many stories about people thinking its the right time, but it turns out its not.       How do you know if you're ready... and if I do decide I'm ready... is it too soon in like an I would be slutty or "easy" way?.. if that makes sense lol

20090225065933AAEQrWS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My girlfriend on the side is getting serious?	She's starting to get frustrated with the situation because she keeps talking about leaving me alone. She know I have a gf but I told her even though I live with someone I'm still single. My gf calls alot when we are together and it ruins our time.       My gf on the side is saying that she needs to get a man of her own, that she's tired of the booty call thing and she's tired of living alone. I've told her that I was going to leave my gf soon and move in with a friend. I told her it was ok if she decided to have a dip if she wants to feel the time that I can't be there, she no that's not what she wants. I'm afraid I'm going to call her one day and she's going to tell me I can't come over anymore because she's moved someone else in. Is she crazy? Or is she trying to send me hints about something? Is she thinking that maybe I'll dump my gf to be with her or something? But she seems unhappy and claims that she cries herself to sleep at night because she's tired of being alone.
20090225070121AA9dllC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does anyone else have a lot of regrets about thing in their marriage?	I was reading someones post and it made me think of my own. My entire relationship I have given up things for my spouses sake. I know you give up things for the person you love, but when it comes to your own beliefs and morals there comes regret, right? Mine is my wedding too. My family is still mad at me for eloping and I didn't want too but it was the only option in my spouses eyes, so we eloped. Then there are little things like teaching our children about god, he doesn't have a religion and I have a strong religious background. Family means the world to me and he hates his? Seriously many other things but these are the biggies. How do you let go of those major things and not  have regret?

She is an attractive woman there is nothing wrong with her. She says they have great sex and great oral sex but when it comes to kissing she said she and him only had a passionate kiss in their relationship 2 times. She said he sucks her lips or bites them.  She feels that because she does everything for him that's mainly the reason he is with her that he never met another woman that is so reliable and so loving.  He said he is in love with her it seems this way but she said she doesnt think he is very physically attracted to her and that is why he isnt very passionate .  Can this be the case?

20090203162425AA82ndP	Family & Relationships;Friends	One friend can't hang out with the other...?	So I have two friends (let's call them Benji and Lassie). Lassie's mom got the wrong impression of Benji and now Lassie isn't allowed to hang out with Benji at all.   Usually this wouldn't be a problem; Benji, Lassie, and I aren't in the same place most of the time. But we're all going rollerskating on Sunday and they'll both be there.   I see them both an even amount of time. Benji knows Lassie's not allowed to hang with her.   I wish all of us were able to hang out together but that's not happening. How can I hang out with one friend without hurting the other?

On the other hand, I thought about setting my wedding date to January 1, 2011 - so that it would be EASY to remember (1/1/11). New Years wedding sounds cool too.      Which would  you do? Winter or fall wedding? It will be in a church, but I will have plenty of outdoor pictures!

20090203160811AAgAd01	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is she acting like this?	My friend since the beginning of time just turned on me. I kind of saw it coming, but It hit harder than I thought. On the bus one morning she and someone I didn't like where talking, I wasn't listening to my mp3 player because it was dead but i had the headphones on(the girl I don't like is 7 and my friend is T) 7 made a comment on my clothes, and T laughed. I couldn't reall hear what she was saying, but I knew it was about me.      Later in music class I was sitting next to T and  they where passing notes(-.-) I saw my name being writen, and was curious so I looked over there. T pushed me away and 7 made a comment. After the gay little movie we where watching was over The guy behind us took the paper and read it gave it to me and told me to read it. There where thing on there like:      "Why does Tracey dress like that?"   "I don't know, its disgusting"   "I know"   "She told me she was bi"(No i DIDN'T!)   "EW!"   "Who do you think she likes?"   "----- --------"   "LOL"   "Why does she keep looking over here *****"   "She smells"   "Haha Loser"      And more insults and things I can't remember. Instead of lashing out I clamly walked over to the teacher and they glared at me. She read it blah this part isn't important.      Ever since that every time i try to talk to them they make rude comments. Is she jealous? T isn't the most attractive woman in the world, and shes a little over weight. I don't know how that information was important

I feel that if you meet a girl and right of the bat you ask if she's single, than you lose the element of surprise. On the other hand, if you meet a girl and start getting to know her, then it turns out she's not single, it's like a waste of time. Is there some other way of asking someone if she's single without actually saying it?
20090203155842AAesXFv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my Husband disrespectful?	My husband and I have been together for almost 25 years. We have four wonderful children: three daughters and one son.      For some reason, whenever my husband and I are around other people (even family members) he puts me down. When it is just us...he is the nicest as can be. But when we are around other people than just us...its the opposite. It has been like this since I can remember. For example: Today my husband and I went out to breakfast with our oldest daughter, (shes 21.) While we were shopping he put me down by making fun of my shirt. I instantly got sad, and he just smiled and walked away. Alot of the time he also makes fun of my weight...even though he knows that my body has been going through a rough time since i've had my histerectomy.    Then after he says comments like that, he'll get mad at me and wait for me to appologize to him for being upset.    I dont know what to do...please only serious answers. Not just "get a divorce"  I talk to other women too that says that their husbands/boyfriends do that to them too, but only when they're around his friends.       Any help will be greatly appriciated.    Thank You.

Ever since me and my brother were born, my parents started their jobs at home so they could look after us. My brother is moved out now, and I'm 15 and they still think they always need to be home.  I'm smart and I know how to look after myself, cleaning, cooking, etc.      Well I don't want them to look after me so much! I'm old enough and them doing this makes me feel like a baby.  They've gone out of town and left me home alone a few times before, but now that I'm older they just think I'll throw a party or somethng.      Today at dinner I was talking about how I actually WANT to go to summer school (lol dont ask i like it) and my dad said "you going to summer school makes it difficult for US to go to the cottage"   i said "no it doesnt"   he said "yes it does because i have to be here to watch what you do!"   i said "stop treating me like a ******* baby" because I DONT need this.  they left my brother alone, but they think because I'm a girl I'm not responsible and I'm more vulnerable or somehting.      How do I get them to just leave me alone for a bit? I don't want them babying me anymore because I'm very responsible and can take damn good care of myself.

20090304175832AAlAwMZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about him?	so there's this guy that i like. lets call him tyler.. well i go to a youth group on wednesday nights that he goes too. we;ve known each other for 2 years. well my friend liked him for like 4 years.. and i really like him now and we talk everytime we see each other. but idk if he likes me or not. and even tho my friend has a boyfriend now, she may still kinda have feelings for him. and i dont wanna ask her about it cuz then she'll know that i like him.       and he's a really good guy. we're both firm believers in abstinence.. so i know he wouldn't just date me for sex or anything. which is good for me. i just dont know what to do? i mean, i know i could talk to the youth pastor's wife about it. and she could maybe find out for me. she is like my 2nd mom but i can talk to her more easily. so what do i do? do i just take a chance or what??

Since 7th grade we started public school & didnt know anybody & ever since then shes been like my only close friend.  Ive had other friends & people I talk to but she was the only one I really hung out with & stuff.& im really painfully shy. These past months weve been like drifting apart & its like she doesnt even notice.  we dont even talk on the phone & I feel like she doesnt care about me anymore.  She came over like 2 weeks ago & the whole time she acted really different & I just dont even know if I like her anymore she's kind of sassy & self centered & im just sick of her.  But I dont know how to make new friends & im always like associated with her & she says were like twins & we have so much in common expect im the quiet one.  I dont want to live my life in her shadow!!!
20090304180937AAPS2St	Family & Relationships;Family	Why is my mom being so mean?	I don't ask for much from my mom at all. I earned my own spending money from a job so she doesn't really buy my clothes anymore; I buy them myself. I don't ask her for things like iPods or computers. I barely ask her for anything. The ONLY thing I ask her for really is to change my hair.      In the past I have bleached my hair before (not the whole thing, just layers) and she was totally okay with it. She wouldn't object. I just asked her if I could add a few streaks, and she kept putting up a fight. Eventually she backed down and said "I'll let you do it...but only if YOU pay for it." I don't get why she suddenly changed. And she KNOWS that I'm saving my money for a new iPod (yes I am buying it myself) and that I have to buy my friends' birthday gifts too so I don't want to be shelling out a ton of money but she says she doesn't care and that it's not her problem.      I'm just weirded out by her sudden change in heart and why she's being so unsympathetic...I have not gotten into trouble recently or anything.

20090225071054AAP4jRA	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How Can I Communicate Better With My Boyfriend?	We got in an arguement a few days ago, and I really, really want to talk about things.   However, he doesn't. We argue pretty often, so I'm guessing he's just kind of fed up with it all. He's also very busy and stressed out with work, that that also might have something to do with it.      But he's not picking up his phone, he's not responding online, and if I go to his house to visit him I might piss off his parents, which will piss my boyfriend off.      In the past, whenever he gets upset, he resorts to drugs. I did speak to him online 2 days ago, but he was acting really strange. I don't know if he was just messing with me, or I'm not sure if he's high. He did say though that he would call me...which he never did.       Should I wait for him to talk about things, or should I go make sure he's ok?

I've been dating my boyfriend almost a year, and I've already met his family and everything. I love his mom, his dad... not so much, but I don't know about his sister. She is perfectly nice and stuff, she just seems kind of boring.. I don't want to sound mean, but we were on the swim team together, and I could never have a lot of fun with her. She's such a good girl that I haven't really seen her cut loose. But I really have a strong feeling that she wants to get to know me better.   We're in a club together and the seniors (she is one) decide what groups will be going when, and I got put in a group with her and one other person. I'm pretty sure she planned this. I realllly want to be close with her, how can I?
20090304184630AABdlFf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Q for the Women, if a guy is muscular and wears shirts to show it off does that make you think he's cocky?	I've been lifting weights pretty hard over the past couple of years and shirts that used to be baggy are now showing off my arms and chest a lot more. I'm 6'7" and used to be 200 lbs and didn't have any muscle to bother showing, now in the past two years I've put on about 40 lbs of muscle. So if you see a guy wearing tight(not metrosexual tight though) does that make you think he's cocky or or not?
20090304180510AA0TIJX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to act older than my gf? (Girls)?	Just answer my question, I'm not lying to my gf, but I don't want her to seem like the older one in the relationship.       I just found out that she's actually 4 years older than me and I know she's expecting that she's dating someone way older (I actually thought she was way younger). So how do I make it not seem like I'm the younger one? I know sooner or later she'll find out, but at least I would seem like the older one.
20090304175425AAc0hio	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have no balls whatsoever.......?	That's a figure of speech, for all you there. It refers to the fact that I'm too scared to ask a girl to be my girlfriend. Most of us who do not have women throwing themselves at them seem to all have this problem.      See, with this particular girl, I've been friends with her since freshman year. She's had a few boyfriends since we first met, and they all pretty much asshole-chumped her, whether cheating on her, being way too jealous, or just not being there for her. For the past few years I've been wanting to prove I was different. When her dad threatened to kick her out for bad grades last year, I was there to help her with her grades (and, on the way home from one of those sessions, I got into a really nasty car wreck.) When her boyfriend was throwing paper balls at another friend of his in one of the school stairwells, and missed and hit an upperclassman with anger issues, and then got curbstomped by aforementioned upperclassman and seriously injured, I was there to comfort her. I've stood up for her numerous times to her father, who eventually saw the light and now has a better relationship with her and a little respect for me because of it. When her best friend got into an argument with another girl who proceeded to flip out on her for sticking up for her friend, I stuck by her, even though the other girl was very hot, had great curves and was somewhat interested in me (Hard to do, but I did it anyway.) I've never forgotten her birthday or to get her a Christmas present (Once rode a bicycle through a snowstorm just to bring her a Starbuck's coffee and a birthday cake as a surprise), and I'm friendly with a good majority of her friends.  I want to prove I'm different and even though I'm not fit to kneel on her doorstep, I can be a decent boyfriend.      I was planning on doing this when I took her out to a Brad Paisley Concert in Portland last Friday (Which was awesome.) I paid upwind of $200 just for tickets, gas, dinner and souvenirs, all of it. I picked her up at her dad's, we drove non-stop to Portland (except for a pit stop along the way so I could cash my paycheck), buy matching souvenir T-shirts, the works. I buy dinner, and we go up to our seats and watch the concert. It was great. We had fun, and we talked a lot on the way home, not just about the concert, but other stuff, like her modeling job, her friends, my family, life, etc.       Instead of just driving back to Salem, though, she was supposed to go to her mom's in Eugene, which is in the opposite direction of Portland. So her mom said to meet her halfway in Albany. We had plenty of time to talk, and I thought there was some great moments to ask her, but I failed to do so, due to the fact I'm a wimp and didn't have the steel in my balls to do it. Instead, I settled for going to a movie this Friday. (Which may not happen, depending on whether or not she's going to her mom's at the end of the week.) Shortly after I asked her that, I pulled into the Taco Bell in Albany, helped her get her things into her mom's car, and watched her leave. Then I walked though to the Taco Bell Drive Thru (This was at around midnight), asked for a glass of water, and drove another hour back to my house, taking time to pull over after getting out of town to beat my head on the steering wheel and go "You ******* idiot! Why didn't you ask her?!?"      So, anyway, I need help. I want to do this in such a manner she'll have to say yes (Willingly. Not as in put a gun to her head and ask or other retarded stuff like that) Any good ways to do this?

20090225070630AAFfdJ0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Complicated boyfriend?	Me and my boyfriend have almost been going out for 7months now. I really like this kid. But lately i've just been kind of cold and distant with him lately because my friend pointed out something that I didn't really put two and two together. Whenever me and my boyfriend hang out we always go to his friend's house and I just sit there while he plays video games. once in a blue moon will he let me play video games with his friends. But yeah he can seem like a jerk like that and make fun of me but then other times if I don't wnat to do something he'll say that's fine and do it himself or something.       It just seems he likes to act like a "Pimp" or whatever in front of people. Simple as that. Like I put my head on his shoulder when his game was on PAUSE. and he's like "Why do you always have to be touching me?" I don't always touch him. I leave him alone when he is playing his games or whatever. and then I got my student loan and I told him I was going to get him some games. like $300 dollars or whatever. and he's like "Can I have $450?"  He even says he can be selfish at times and thinks he needs to treat me better but he said he wants to act like apimp before he grows up or whatever the heck he said. Also, he wants to do a three way but said if I said no he would accept that. And when I said "So i'm not enough?" Jokenly. he's like "Nope. One is better then two. But your the one I would choose."          ~ _ ~ I'm noticing he's a bit of a jurk more and more. and I don't want that! I was happy before. Now...i'm cold towards him. I stopped calling him. He's noticed. He would call me and be like "You don't call me anymore." and i'm like "I don't want to bother you." and he's like " Well come over here and pick me up. Going to friends now." and he's always saying he's here for me. and like we'll drive around for awhile and talk and  it'll just be a great time. I don't know! I don't know. I don't want to act cold towards him. I don't want that.

It started on Sunday. I have a sore throat, no voice at all, can't breath, shaky, tired. So I had to go on Monday, and yesterday and today I stayed home. But because I missed so much school, my mom is saying that I have to go, even though I feel worse than I have been the last few days. I know that if I go to school, I won't be able to focus and I'll probably end up sleeping through a few classes. How can I convince her that I should stay home?      This is just a side note but: My mom is a very unsympathetic person. She isn't even nice when I'm sick. And we used to be very close, but don't really get along now. So convincing her is pretty hard.      Oh and I don't know about fever. We don't have a thermometer.

20090304175715AAoVwOe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he just another flirt? (in need of more advice)?	I Liked this guy for litteraly 1 and half years. He used to like me too. Hes in my french class... hes the biggest flirt ever. Like every time i look at him hes flirting, i see him looking at me, i see him smile at me, and since we had a class together he only talked to me once (in one month) he walked by me and messed up my hair then we looked at eachother for a while t'ill he walked up to my desk and sat on it we talked for a couple minutes. But is he just a flirt. ? I mean okay a couple days ago he informed me this girl wanted to punch me out... which she never even wanted to in the first place..so why'd he lie.       I'm sick of him always looking like the big shot, and i'm sick of always being judge... especially since he used to have no friends and i still liked him.. and now that he has more friends then me i think .. he thinks hes to good for me (he never said he was..but apparently thats how i feel). It actually hurts. And i have so much more drama on my hands already enough for me to already be leaving town this summer.       Should i just move on. ?

I don't want them to be from my school. ideas?

The thing is, he's really quiet and doesn't make moves...We're friends and we've talked a lot recently, but our conversations aren't very deep yet. I'm not fully comfortable around him, but I do love talking to him; he's a really interesting and sweet guy! He's on the basketball team and they have some games coming up. Would it be weird to tell him I want to come to one of his games? Should I wait for him to ask me to come to one? Obviously the games are open to the whole school, but would it be nice or weird/clingy to tell him I want to come see him play?

20090304184309AAUScY0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I too hard on him?	I love my boyfriend very much. But sometimes I get disappointed in some of his actions, and Im not sure if its warranted, or just the fact that Im super tired.      I work full time and go to school full time. He is very helpful in making me lunches, doing housework, etc. But sometimes I just feel like hes happier that Im not around. I did something very important for him tonight and when I told him, he just kinda mumbled thanks and then went on about something else. Also, I mentioned that I got to eat lunch with him tomorrow, and he was like...oh, did you want something special or something (we never get to eat lunch together, Im usually at school).       I dunno...should I be disappointed in his lack of enthusiasm towards me or should I just let it go? I work so hard during the week that in the small times I do get to see him, I just wish he was a bit more enthusiastic. I dunno....

20090304184958AA54h85	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this guy like me? I'm not sure?	Well we don't talk that much... but he has always said that he likes a girl that is kinda controlling and does not always let him get his way. that is exactly what i am like. he also teases me, takes my things (but always gives them back), and smiles at me all the time. he is usually the one that starts the conversation. during gym class today, i caught him staring at me a couple of times.      the thing that i am confused about is that he is kind of a flirt. he is always touching other girls and pushing them around, especially this one girl in my class. he is always teasing her. but it is not really the same kind of teasing because he knows that he can't pull the same crap that he does with her, with me. and that girl is a big flirt too.      i don't know what to think but my friend thinks that he likes me. so does he really like me?

In study hall we sit right across from each other and we usually just talk and stuff but as of late I've had work that I've actually had to do, so we haven't talked. When I was doing work she did things to get my attention like tapping my foot with hers, putting on make up, flaunting herself, random sighs. Well, as much as I wanted to talk to her I had to finish this stuff cause I want to do good in school. Now that all my work is done shes kind of trying to avoid talking to me, such as asking questions to everyone else but me, she ignored me too, I think.

20090304175840AAro0es	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What can I do in this relationship?	So I am 16ish, and my girlfriend is 15 and a half.  We have been going 3rd base for a while now, and we have tried to stop many times, for many reasons.  For one, she is fairly religious, and believes in keeping her virginity.  Also, people have been giving her trouble, even though she tells know one, they assume we do and  i guess her body language reveals the truth.  Finally, we both find it hard to keep our relationship afloat.  The final little thing is that we are best friends, 75% of the hanging out we do is with eachother.  I refuse to break up with her over this, especially as a 16 year old.  Is it really just a matter of not letting ourselves get into that situation?  Or are there certain boundaries we need to set?  Please tell me what you think.          Any negative remarks will be disregarded.

My med. school had a rather disturbing ad out for hiring model patients, open to either college students or the general public.  It pays well, but would involve med school students learning pelvic, rectal, and breast exams on you/ practicing on you while you are naked.  Is this something you would ever consider doing?  If not, what could be an alternative to teach students these techniques?  If yes, would you consider it awkward (especially if you wind up dating one of the students)?

20090304183727AA6pxQK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Inadequate amount o' answers yesterday...?	Repost of same question.      I've promised to save myself for marriage (male, 18), but lately I have been having VERY strong doubts about it. Is it really worth it and is there a reason behind it? Because I know it can cause very powerful emotional and psychological problems past a certain age in males. Consider the following:      Scenario №1: I am years ahead of my peers in school at 18, but I still won't finish my education until I am in my early 30s, which means I won't be married until my mid 30s, -- at least, that's the most likely scenario I can imagine. And although I have no trouble waiting, I just don't see a point any more -- by then, my likely to be 30 year old wife will have slept around with oh, let's say the cultural norm of 50 (or is it higher at 30?) and will only want to have kids after she's gotten all of 'er bangin' done in elementary, middle, high school and college. So, after having sex about a dozen times or however many it takes to get her pregnant after all of those years of being on destructive birth control hormones (either way it won't be much), that'll be it for the whole sex thing between us.      Scenario №2: I can't imagine anyone else being stupid enough to wait for marriage, especially at 30. If she however does (keep in mind here, my chances of being hit by lightning 5 times consecutively are likely higher), she'll also only want to have kids, probably even on our wedding day because of the whole biological clock thing and probably in part due to also being seriously mentally ill (once again who waits until they are married to have sex?) After that, no more bangin' -- because come on, everyone knows sex pretty much stops during that 9 month period and then comes to a complete halt.      Factor these two things into both scenarios: I refuse to cheat and I don't believe in divorce. And can't get married early in life (25 or so) because of all the med' school debt I'll be in, and of course, the fact that I won't be earning anything.      So am I royally ****** here or what?

Ive messed with quite a lot of guys, but i didnt sleep with them. I think hes slept with half of them...      A lot of people tell me hes a player, but nobody can tell me exactly why or how. We been talking for bout 1month now, and hasnt broke a promise to me, that i know of. We cant trust eachother right now, and thats our problem. He heard stuff about me and i heard stuff about him.      Im scared to get attached to him, and get hurt. Were trying to work through it, and try to put trust in this, but its not working so well. Hes also a pretty jealous person, and at times he seems controlling.      Idk if i should go for it and give it a chance, or get out quick!

Both my parents died sadly 6 months apart from each other just as I was really getting to know them (they were in and out of my life my whole life)      I keep telling my wife if it turns out we can't have a biological child of our own I am fine with adoption. And that way we don't spend all that money on fertility treatments and if they fail well then we would still have the money to adopt.      My wife however isn't too fond of the idea of adoption. She grew up with her mom and was adopted by her stepdad and she hated that. Her mom wouldn't let her dad see her (she said he needed to grow up) well now she does know her father. She says growing up she wishes she had her mom and her dad.      She says she wants our child. Our biological child. She doesn't even want to consider the idea of adoption. Every time I bring it up she changes the subject.      I understand she wants our child, the child that we make. But she doesn't even want to consider the what ifs.      How can I show her the benefits of adoption?      How can I get her to think about adopting?      If we never have kids yes I'll be sad but I knew going in she was iffy on even wanting kids so I should atleast be happy that she is willing and wants to have a baby. I love her unconditionally either way. But I would like to have a kid one day, either ours biologically or ours through adoption.      How to get her to warm up to the idea? Hopefully we will be able to concieve our own child because I know she wants nothing more than to have our baby.         ________________________________      I wanted to mention one of my grandparents didn't want to adopt me. My grandfather was against it completely but he warmed up to me pretty quick and the day he died he said I was the best choice he ever made      I know my wife would come around eventually if she would just open up to the idea.      She is just so convinced that it will happen for us. She doesn't want to think about the what ifs      I can live without kids but I just want to do whats best for her. And I know she wants to be a mom      I mean I went into the relationship and this marraige knowing that we may never have kids. When we met she didn't want kids at all. So I am glad she atleast wants a baby. If I can't give her that I atleast want her to be able to be a mom since that is what she claims to want.         I just want to have a plan if we can't get pregnant. I hope we can.      How do I convince her not to close off the idea of adoption altogether?

20090304180205AAISEr5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he still love me?	My guy suggested a threesome the other day. At first, I was mildly consensual, but after thinking about it, I decided I couldn't stand the idea of seeing him with another girl, even if I was there.       When he told me about it, he said that he loves me no matter what and I'm the most important thing to him; he was just being a "guy" and wanted to have the experience. When I told him no, he didn't gripe or anything, but I still can't help but wonder.      Maybe I'm naive, but I believe that if a guy truly loves a girl, he won't need anything else. He'll move heaven and earth for her if he has to, and sex won't be just about some abstract, detached feeling of pleasure: it'll be about sharing yourself with your significant other.      What do you think? Does he really still love me (we've been together a year and a half) or is he just thinking about the sex? And what should I do about it? I'm feeling very hurt and used.

I feel like everything is perfect except for one thing, the debate of college. Not the debate of whether i should go or not, but how is it going to work after i go to college. I am a junior and she is a freshman. Please be slow to judge us, because our relationship is not like all the other ones. This is a legitimate relationship that has a depth of which i have never seen before. We have so much love for each other and we do many sweet things for each other to show it. We plan to get married when she is 19 and I am 21 or after college. She wants to go to cali and we live in washington. She says that she will not go to the college, just to be with me, and i would do the same. I am terrified that this wont work out and i am so scared of losing her. I dont know what is wrong with me at all because I feel that i am going to lose her and i cant bare to be without her. It kills me not to see her face everyday at school let alone be 15 1/2 hours away from her... I don't know what to do...I dont know what to feel...I don't know what will happen...and i am scared of the chance of losing her. At first i was leery of meeting her when we first started seeing each other (not going out at the time). We met after school one day and talked, after we stopped talking she asked if i wanted to keep the conversations to stay the same as in text/im messages only and i said yes. I met her mom a little while afterwords... The day after my birthday, we were officially boyfriend and girlfriend. We went to homecoming together and had a great time together but we were far away from each other while dancing. I loved holding her so much. She expected a kiss at the end and i was to nervous to do so. After the first date we had I fell for her. There was something that came over me that i cannot explain and i don't know if i ever will be able to, but i fallen. I wrote her a letter that same day and gave it to her the next day. She still quotes the last words that i said in the letter to this very day and i believe that she will remember those words forever. We kept going on dates and such and eventually we went to her brothers house. After i was there for a while, my girlfriends niece sat beside me and kissed me on the cheek, well tried. My girlfriend made the comment that oh, so my niece gets to kiss you first now huh. I said, that she didnt kiss me, because she didnt and i said i will kiss you right now if you want because she was sitting on the other side of me. Her niece is like 6. She said that she cant because we are right in front of her family. So she asks me if i want to go on a walk. And of course i say yes :D We walked around the neighborhood and she stopped us while we were holding hands and made comments such as i see Cody and Leslie in the sky and she quoted a saying that i said about the stars. I see this is my first ultimate failure.... I have so many more... She wanted to kiss and i didn't catch on even though thats why we went on the walk in the first place. After we started walking again it hit me like a rock that she wanted to kiss me and i felt horrible...I tried to think of a way to stop her to have the chance of kissing her again. We came to an intersection in the devolopment and she asked me which way do i want to go, and i said which way is closest to your brothers house? and she pointed the way and i started leading her to the opposite way and she laughed and smiled because she knew that i wanted to be with her and continue to hold her hand. Eventually i stopped walking and she was puzzled for a little bit. I made light conversation for a minute or two and i asked her plain out if she wanted to kiss. And she shrugged and said I guess in a scared voice and then she started crying. After she started crying i asked her what was wrong and she explained to me that the last person that she loved crushed her and that is scared i would leave too. She dated this kid and she liked him and he lead her on and he told her one day that he just wasn't interested in her and it crushed her. Eventually i go on with the walk and comfort her and i ask again and then we kiss. We kissed 8 times before we got back her brothers house. We have also had many other dates and other issues have came up. These issues consist of me failing tests, cussing at her friend and telling her that i don't like a certain girl that showed up at the movie theater one day and my gf thought that i liked her one time and i never have and i was infuriated and another girl trying to steal me away. The tests were ones that she asked me if i wanted to go play with her while i was playing with my friend and she wan

And therefore this urge won't go away by masturbating..i don't enjoy that.

20090304180344AA4Ejtq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My friends gf died. need advice!?	so my friends gf died over a year ago in a car accident and just recently (about 4 months ago) instead of telling this girl he's been talking to over the internet the truth he told her that he loves her. he realized what he did and they've been texting ever since (talkin on the phone is uncomfortable for him.) because she takes his mind off his gf and he really does likes her. now he told her that he didnt want to talk for awhile but i guess she mistook it for him breaking up with her so they've been on an emotional rollercoaster ever since. (about 3 weeks) he doesnt want to hurt her so he told her that he wants it to work and plans on moving down where she lives for school. but now he hasnt spoken to her in a long time (3 weeks) cuz he's been really depressed. he hates all the drama and really doesnt want to tell her what happened until he can speak to her face to face. how would u feel if you were that girl? and what do you think he should do?? is it selfish for him to keep doing what he's doing?

I've been talking to this guy for almost a month now. We are not dating or anything. I'm beginning to be interested in him, and I THINK he is too, but I'm not sure. I try not to call/text him first because I don't know where this would lead and I don't know what he thinks of me yet. But he texts me almost everyday first asking what I'm doing etc.   Yesterday at work when I had an hour left before I finish work and go home, I receive a text from him.

I didn't hear from him after which I didn't really wait for it.       I was just wondering..does this mean he's interested in me? What does it mean when he says thinking of me much?

20090304180612AAiNI0P	Family & Relationships;Family	My mom is being so unfair, How can an 18 year old daughter get a mother's trust?	Being 18 and having our senior year spring break coming up in 3 weeks, my three friends and I are pretty excited! A few months ago, we all decided that we are going to my beach house down in florida and both of my parents agreed we could go with out parents as long as everyone's parents agreed. So we all planned that we were driving down with our friend and would stay in my family's beach house. But out of the blue a few days ago my mom broke the news that she was coming with us. I told her it was unfair and asked her reason for why she all of a sudden decided that we couldn't go alone and she was like "Well you can't stay in a beach house unacompanied unless you are over the age of 21". I dont understand why she would just suddenly decide it, but I have come to decide that she doesn't trust my friends and I and thinks we will get in some sort of trouble. She has made so many excuses about it whenever I bring it up, and now she is saying "I will drive you all wherever you want to go" which is NOT what we want at all. We are 18 and will be leaving for college in a few months and want freedom on spring break. I have made MANY good points about   1) two of my friends parents will be just down the street from us,   2) the place we are staying is probably the most family-oriented and high class places you will ever come across, leaving very little opportunities for trouble,    3) we are all 18 and believe we should be trusted and want a parent-free vacation for once,   4) it is my beach house, we already have the key, so I am sure it is legal for four 18 year old responsible (adults) to stay alone      No matter how I try approaching her with my reasoning of why we should be trusted, she is stubborn and will not listen to me at all. What can I do to earn her trust?, honestly I have never done anything and I feel almost as if she is just being stubborn so I will not have a fun spring break. Also, my friends are getting angry at ME because in the first place, I made it clear we were going down by ourselves, with no parents, and now its like our plan has been crushed, and we aren't even excited about our senior year spring break, which sucks!

Also she doesn't know that I like him. I am very truthful towards him but we dont' talk all that much we mainly just make fun of the teacher but its not some intense long conversation.

(that's in inside joke 4 him). anyways Rambo is new 2 my school this year and i really really really like him. and he is the nicest boy ive ever met. and he goes to my youth group and we r pretty good friends. but i he likes my bestfriend and she dont even go 2 our school. and i think i might b falling in love with him. he says that he only likes me as a friend but sometimes he does stuff that makes me think that he likes me but im 99.9% sure that he doesnt like me but that 0.1% is what keeps me going. he is coming back from his suspendtion tomorrow and i cant wait 2 see him i missed him so munch! he is one of the most popular boys in my grade/school and ALL of my friends r cheerleaders but im not but im still in high rank with them. he got suspended for punching this kid on the bus (it wasnt that bad) and i already have his number i was the 1st he gave it to. and also one day i was in social studies and he is in that class with me and he sits across from me and one day he was like "meg" and i was like "yea" paused for a few seconds and said "your hair is getting long" and i was like "yea it is " but it was soo random and i couldnt stop laughing about it so why did he say that it?? was kinda weird and awkward. and i dont understand how he can like my best friend and not me. me and her look a lot alike and he even said to her "you remind me so much of meg like the way you guys act and everything its scary" so how could he only like one of us but not the other. SO WHAT SHOULD I DO

20090304184258AAziOkB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please, please help me!  I think she likes me, but something weird is going on!  I don't understand anything!?	So, Lately it seems like the girl I like (who's kinda shy and hard to read) has a thing for me.  But some weird things are happening, like she's deleting stuff on facebook and my ex is doing crap. I'm just wondering what you guys think, cuz she's really hard to read:      1. She just got a facebook and every time she does anything involving me, she deletes it from her feed and when I asked her was she said to be organized. But I decided to double check, and she only deletes my post. As far as I can tell she doesn't want someone to know that she's talking to me. I'm guessing her dad.      2. I didn't think anything of this until now, but asked to borrow my jacket maybe a month or so ago. My jacket was gray and so was her shirt. After she put it on I made a joke about how weird it looks because they were the exact same color and said she should borrow someone elses, and I suggested someone and she said, "but he's wearing his jacket"... I was wearing my jacket to...      3. About a week or 2 ago she was flirting with me big time and it was obious and she was making excuses to touch me, like drawing on my hand and ect.. (and when I was complaing becasue she messed up a friend of hers said that she could draw on her hand if she wants, but she jsut ignored her) Which is kinda weird since she's usually shy.    (During that my 'ex' sat near by, almost like she was supervising and then afterward she invited the girl I like to her house, which makes me wonder what they did...)      4. Since then she hasn't flirted with me as far as I can tell. Maybe my 'ex' asked her about it and she decided to stop because she made it obious? or Maybe my 'ex' told her crap about me? She still does the weird facebook thing, but I'm wondering if she likes me or what.      So what do you guys think? At first I thought I knew for a fact and was flirting with her and stuff, but not I'm not sure. (Maybe I've stopped flirt to?) Also, any pointers/advise would be awesome. :)      thanks!

So is it disgusting?
20090304181809AA7nT9q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I let my girlfriend go to prom with another guy who asked her before we even knew each other?	I met my girlfriend in October and we started going out in January. She goes to a different high school, but she doesn't live far away from me. Her school is having a prom and I was surprised when she told me she would be going because she didnt mention it to me. When I asked about it, she asked me if id be jealous if she went with one of her friends that asked her to go to prom with her before we knew each other. I am not sure whether to tell her no, or to trust her and tell her its okay...
20090304181848AAt4Bwr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone tell me when it's truly worth it? Do you have any regrets?	So here's the situation:       I first met my girlfriend in high school. She was a foreign exchange student from France while I was a normal everyday kid from Small Town, USA. We dated almost immediately after meeting each other, the spark was there before we even said hello. Her term ends, she is forced to go back to France and we continue dating for a few months more until the distance got the better of us, and we had to break up.      It took a whole year until we started talking again, simply someone to talk to over the internet. This continued for two more years, keeping it friendly without even thinking about trying to get back together because we knew it wasn't possible at the time.      3 years after her leaving my hometown, I study abroad in Spain. I made a trip up to France to find her. My memory of seeing her for the first time will be one I will have with me for the rest of my life. In an instant, all that time had disappeared. We went right back to how we were, only 3 years older/wiser/more mature.      We have been successfully keeping it together for almost 8 months, but it's reached the breaking point. I can't continue this, I honestly don't know if I can hold it together with almost 4,600 miles separating us.      Every day, I think about my future, but my future has 2 distinct paths: continue my education and wait 2-3 years until I graduate and my student loans are paid off or pick up and go. Every day, it is a constant battle against not to just say "**** it" to everything and be with her. Basically, I don't know who to listen to, my head or my heart.       So this brings me to my question: is it worth it to wait, possibly risking what I have with her? or do I follow my heart and be with her? Everywhere I look, it seems there are signs telling me to go. I'm a firm believer in the "do what you feel is right, you only have one chance" mantra, but it's easier said than done. Is it worth it to leave everything behind to be with the woman I'm going to marry or do I take the safe bet and stick it out for the remaining semesters? Will I regret disrupting my perfectly laid out, secure life, or will I regret not going after what I love most?      (And please refrain from using "if it's meant to be, you'll be together". I've heard it enough from everyone else. Besides, it's total bull crap. Sometimes you can't leave things up to chance.)      Btw, I'm currently Spanish Edu major, but I have the "linguistic gift", I speak fluent Spanish, conversational French (always a teacher available (; ), and Japanese, finding some kind of job as a language tutor wouldn't be much of a struggle.
20090304181909AAdIz8Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this girl into me?	I'm into this girl, but I don't think she likes me back. At first I thought she did, but now I don't think so. I try to start up conversation, but she answers shortly and doesn't really seem into what I am saying. Our conversations are awkward because she really doesn't say anything. She really doesn't try to start conversation with me, but she doesn't really talk to anyone in class. I always have to initiate the conversation. Should I continue to waste my time or just move on to someone else?

20090304182100AA8HIzN	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I help him deal with a break-up?	One of my good guy-friends just got dumped by his girlfriend over the phone. He called me and I gave him some pep talk to make him feel better. I've gone through a break-up before, except I was cheated on, before, so I can relate to what he's feeling. Unfortunately, I took the cutting route rather than actually 'dealing' with it. I really want to give him the best advice & make him feel great about himself. Any suggestions?

20090304182644AAZXNOp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I dont think this is cheating not sure?	ok i know this guy and we are really into each other but there is a big distance issue. well he was dating this girl but he wasnt happy in the relationship but one night we were talking on myspace and things got kinda dirty. well his gf got on his myspace the next day and read it all and accused him of cheating. she broke up with him but he said cheating to him would be if we were together in person i kinda agree. we arent together cuz we live in different states but was that cheating?
20090304182731AAbLmT9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She drives me crazy but i still love her?	ok well my gf and i have been dating for 5 months now and i love her and she loves me. but she is crazy and so is her family. i've met most of her family since we were dating through thanksgiving and christmas. they're a bunch of drunks, but shes not. she just acts on impulse and does stuff she thinks is right but someone with half a brain would know its wrong. i know some the stuff she does is wrong but she gets me to go along with it. and that gets me in trouble with her family and mine sometimes. i know she means well and i know she loves me but she just doesnt get things and is a drama queen sometimes. this is the best i can describe her. and she was kinda loose with lots of people before me so when people find out we're dating they're just like "shes a ho" and **** like that. it annoys me and bothers me a lot because i havent been with that many girls and im older than her. my question is, after reading all of these negative characteristics about her, do u think i should still be with her? she always does whatever it takes to make me happy and hates disappointing me... maybe im crazy for being with her
20090304182824AAnRDZK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why wont they leave me alone!?	Ok in my science class i sit with these two guys and a girl and when i take food out eat they always get on me about what im eating and i hate it. I know im not fat so why should it matter what im eating i play sports and go hiking so i do get exercise so why should it matter. I just always feel like thr calling me fat and trying to tell me to stop eating. Like today one of them said next time why don't you come in here with some fruit. And its not like i don't eat fruit or anything because i do but just not during science because i just want something to snack on that's all. But they don't believe me. What do i do to get them to leave me alone!?
20090304182833AA1QJKl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls why is is that girls need?

How can I get her back. She broke up with me because she said she felt neglected. Now that I look back she was right and I realize where I made my mistake. Girls I need some great ideas on how to get her back. Positive intelligent answers only please. Thanks

20090304182841AAsU0ta	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why hasn't he texted?	So, I started talking to this guy who goes to my school a few days ago and he asked me if I had a cell number, so I gave to him but told him I had to get another phone because my other one was broken, so he told me to just text him as soon as I could. I got my phone that night so I texted him and we were talking for a while. Then it was late so he said he was going to bed but that he would text me in the morning, but he hasn't texted me or said anything to me all day. We only see each other sometimes at school, but he hasn't actually talked to me in person before. But what does it mean that he says he'll text but doesn't???

20090304183119AAebJzB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Feels like boyfriend/fiance (whatever he is right now) is playing mind games?	Sorry in advance for the long post but I really have to get this off my chest.   I was at choir rehearsal on last night and my boyfriend(he was my fiance but at this point I don't know what we are) walked in after working an 11am-8pm shift.  I was a little happy to see him so after rehearsal I walked up beside him and sniffed him because he was smelling good.  Now I didn't get right up on his neck and sniff.  I simply smelled the fragrance of his cologne and sniffed.  Well apparently that didn't go over too well with him because he pushed me away with his elbow.  I mean literally kept pushing me with his elbow!  I was a hurt that he did that to say the least as if he acted like we werent a couple  We have been together 6 years and is supposed to be getting married in June.  Well what I did was walk out the door because I was hurt and embarrassed that he did that to me.  I didn't speak to him when he got home and didn't speak to him until he called me at work this morning asking me what's wrong with me.  Let me back track and say that I was intentionally not speaking to him so that I could calm myself down and think rationally.  Well him asking me the question of what's wrong and me answering it just screwed up the whole day.  He ends up telling me that I made him feel uncomfortable and that people were looking when I "sniffed" him.  He then went into dramatics about how the other married couples at the church don't show PDA (public displays of affection) so why should I?  Granted these couples have been together well over 40, 50 years!!  To compare us to them was ludicrous!  At the end of the day, this man accused me of being inappropriate and church and not realizing that he elbowed me away from him like I had the plague or something!  I didn't even realize that it was this serious for him to say that I embarrassed HIM by just being happy to see him.  I wasn't trying to give him a hug nor kiss.  Just playfully sniffing him.  He does embarrassing things to me like grab my butt in the store and has even hit me on my butt in church and has talked loudly to me in church but he has the nerve to tell me it's me that caused him embarrassment.  He now wants to take the engagement ring back and can't even give me a decent answer as to why.  Just that I embarrassed him as if he has a reputation to maintain and I don't.  I am just tripping hard over this situation and find it unbelievable!!  I have paid for this man's car, our rent, lights, water, cable all by myself and this is the thanks I get???  Never will I be a sucker again!!  We live together but I am ready for him to leave after this stunt here.  No lease has been signed by him yet so I gave him a month to move out.  I love him but I am not gonna play these mind games with him.  Oh yeah, he even apologized for hurting my feelings but then still talked about how I embarrassed him and still want the ring back.  How is a person going to apologize but still be mad at the person that was originally mad at them??  Anybody else go thru craziness like this????  I am totally confused here.

20090304183314AA0lmhs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this girl like me and how do I ask her out?	Me and this girl who goes to school with me talk a lot on aim and text each other a lot, we talk about school, what we like, just general stuff. But, when we talk in school or on the phone it always seems awkward. I think she may like me because when we talk online, we can talk until two or three in the morning, but if i sign out for like half a second, by the time i get back on she will already sign off, which means that I'm the only reason shes on aim this late. But, on facebook, she always talks to other guys from different schools. She went to a private middle school, so I don't know any of these guys or if they have a thing with her. I also don't talk to any of her friends that go to my school. I also don't really know how to ask her to do something outside of school.

20090304184528AA7Mn78	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Get ex boyfriend back?.?	My niece is 16 and is having boy issues (aww). Now she's only had 1 real boyfriend, whom she began dating at 14 and they were together, (had normal relationship problems, broke up got bak together the whole 9) and she was the perfect girlfriend any guy could ask for. Yes, she gave him her virginity, they were in a "committed" relationship and were still together long after that. Now,  they're broken up, been that way for a while and he went out with a 14 year old freshman (he's a 17 year old senior) and he and my niece weren't talkn for a couple months. Then all of a sudden he came back into her life after his girlfriend hurt him emotionally (kissing his friend and talkn sexually 2 another boy) and broke up with his girlfriend and got back into an open relationship with my neice recently, now he's broke it off with her and is back at it with the 14 year old freshman claiming that they're sooooooooo much in love and she loves him and he love her. He wants him and my neice to be best friends, but she's not sure. She's also worried that he might take his new girlfriend to prom and not her (girlfriend of 2 years). Why would he wanna throw away that relationship with her to be with the other girl? What do you think the outcome will be? And any suggestions?. Thanks a lot everyone.

20090304185341AAYRS2X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i go to the same college as my boyfriend?	i will be a senior in high school next year and have started to think about colleges. I have been dating my boyfriend for a year, 8 months of which have been long distance; he graduated from my high school last year and now goes to college two hours away. my immediate reaction is to shrink from the idea of following him to college, but the thought of getting to see him whenever i want is also really appealing.      i know we could continue to make it work if i went to another school; after all, he's only two hours away from home. but i really like the school he goes to now- it has a really good program for the major i'm interested in, it's the size i want, and it's close to home like i want. even though it fits the bill better than any other school i've seen so far in my search, i'm afraid that i subconsciously put it on a pedastal because he goes there and i want to be with him.      naturally, my friends and family all think even considering it is a bad idea. any thoughts/previous experience?

And besides, I think our prizes should be different. So do you guys have any ideas I could use as a prize if I won??      we're trying to be reasonable here.. please stay appropriate      I'd never ask for anything materialistic. I'd only ask for something we could do with or for each other etc.   I want it to show in a way that i do care about him a lot, without going over board.

20090304190817AArGxw8	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I file for divorce?	I am 24 years old, and I married a beautiful 34 year old with an 8 year old daughter. She was actually interested in a 40 year old moderately wealthy business executive, but to shorten a long story, I managed to captivate her heart and she fell in love with me.      I had convinced myself that since both of us were working, and since I had 2 years of college left, we would have a perfectly happy family that I could care for. I lied to myself--seriously.      Although I make a sufficient amount to pay the rent--that's generally about all. My wife cannot work much since she has a child to care for, and a financial need CONSTANTLY appears unexpectedly.      I also found out that I don't know the first thing when it comes to parenting--the last time I tried to cook a meal for her daughter, she spent the night having a romantic date with the toilet bowl. I can't ever get her to do obey me, either--one night, my wife came home at nearly midnight to find her daughter still up. When she demanded why, I stated to her that everytime I tried to put her to bed, she screams, howls, and gets right back out. All my wife had to do was charge at her, and she got her butt into bed in less than 5 seconds--no arguments.      I also thought that I would finish college and get well paying job as an accountant. That is, until last semester when all my classes turned into an academic fight for survival. I spent all weekend long studying for an exam, and yet I made a C-. I'm not even sure I'm going to make it this semester.      I just came to the conclusion that while I do have a heart, and treated her much better than her abusive ex husband did, and while I am there for her to keep her happy....I really do fail as a husband and a stepfather because I'm only 25 with a mediocre job and now it looks like I can't even make it through college. A REAL husband makes enough money to where no one ever has to need anything, it is already taken care of.       I really do think I cheated her, and she had a better chance with the much older, much wealthier businessman. A heart only does but so much, and I really screwed up.      Should I just let this go and take it as a lesson learned to not try to be someone higher up than I really am, and let her live a better life with the other man? What is the mature thing to do?      (Oh, and for the heckler--NO, I'm not looking for a cop out excuse to go run off with some other girl!)

20090304195401AAWjBoZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do girls find guys with glasses nerdy or intimidating?	I got glasses ever since I was 14 years-old, so I wasn't always blind. Now I'm 19 and still wearing my glasses all the time. I take off my glasses and take pictures but I feel as if I look better with glasses on, maybe I got too use to seeing myself wearing it. Contacts aren't really comfortable with me either. Also my glasses are rimless so you can see my face more.       I just wonder if glasses would hold a girl back from dating a guy...
20090304191547AAPdJ1u	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Effed up situation for my cousin, should I tell him?	Ok, so here's the deal. My cousin is really good friends with some annoying, perverted doofus that never shuts up, but he thinks he's funny so I'm kinda forced to be cool with him. Anyway, my cousin's friend had sex with a girl that he likes and my cousin doesn't know about it. The sad part is, the perv is fat, has long curly hair, crooked teeth, and his 'stache makes him look like Nacho Libre (he's fu*king ugly, basically). My cousin is clean cut, all the girls say he's cute and whatnot, so I know he thinks he can get some from the girl he likes. Should I tell him about this? I'm thinking he's going to find out sooner or later because I was told by someone else of this and not from the doofus.

20090304210137AAFhdNy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Q for the Women, if a guy is muscular and wears shirts to show it off does that make you think he's cocky?	I've been lifting weights pretty hard over the past couple of years and shirts that used to be baggy are now showing off my arms and chest a lot more. I'm 6'7" and used to be 200 lbs and didn't have any muscle to bother showing, now in the past two years I've put on about 40 lbs of muscle. So if you see a guy wearing tight(not metrosexual tight though) does that make you think he's cocky or do you just check him out?
20090304200629AA0PNoG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really like her! What should I do?	I really like this girl. We used to talk every now and then. A week or two ago, I started talking to her a lot. For a few day, she's been ignoring my messages. We never talked that much in person, we never hanged out and she is always surrounded by her friends. I think she might know that I like her, because I made it very obvious by talking to her a lot. My question is, should I sent her a private message or an email asking her if she has been ignoring me and why? What if she asks me why it matters? I'd love to tell her that I like her, but I don't think it's the right time, so what would I say? Please keep in mind that she will most likely show this to her friends. Please help me, I've liked her for over a year.

I'm thinking about telling him how i feel, and try to be brave =D do you think i should ? and if so, how ? How would you want to be told ? Thank you !!

20090304203259AALHBd3	Family & Relationships;Family	My family is having very bad problems. How do i cope with it?	Well these last few months have been horrible on our family.    I am only 13 , so it's kind of harder on me too.          I do come from a very good fortunate family. My dad has his own company does pretty darn well even in this economy. But, here's where the problems come in ... My mom has suffered from depression and anxiety for 7 years. It's genetic. My dad has anger issues he won't admit too. My grandfather has been in the hosptail for 1 month , he is kind of dying. My 18 year old brother is dating a 27 year old woman. And my dad left us about 4 hours ago , On a school night.       Like I said I am only 13. I have my own personal issues. I don't like who I am. I am 188 pounds . Very unnatractive. etc.         I don't have high self-esteem , I'm bi. You know the common teen problems.          But because of all my paretns problems lately , they have been putting more pressure on my brother and I. My parents have told me many times I am morem ature then my brother. He's addicted to World of warcraft and such. I am an honor roll student. But my problem is , I hide most of my issues , then i end up raging. I also , have been under tremendous stress. I am starting highschool in a few months. Like 6 months. I am in the middle of puberty : [ , My parents have added multiple new chores currently I have to do my own laundry , cook all my own meals , clean our kitchen/living room/Bathroom/Bedrooms.... Also , I must do my homework and also help my brother occasionally with some of his things. (my brother can be very lazy). So , How do I cope with all this? I am going to explode. Like I said my dad kind of packed his stuff a few hours ago and walked out because of his stress. And no , I am not making this up. I just need help.
20090304204822AAbO1kP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i get him to understand he's not allowed to know anything about my personal life? Guys only?	i say guys only because they are usually good with these types of things.   So have any of you ever just dated a girl very casually and maybe use her as a person to just have sex with?   I'm not saying in a bad way , I still like him alot and i find him very attractive but i'mnot into having anything serious with him because thats not what i'm looking for. I don't think he is either. But he always asks me about work and my day and what happened.   i don't want him to ask this so i want to make it clear to him that he's not allowed to know anything much about me outside of the time that we are together.   I know its possible because i had a guy do this to me once. Although i felt kind of bad about it at the time. but it was understood between us that i wasn't to know about his life. if i asked, he would just say nothing same old. so i just feel weird and annoyed when this guy does this.      What kind of  things should  i answer him in order for him to get the hint. when he asks about my life?   oh and don't tell me to just say "you aren't allowed to ask me that !" or anything really blunt.

20090304190810AAe5yRL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get over a guy I am seeing?	So, I am seeing this guy.  I really really like him, but I don't want to be with him anymore.  We have an open relationship and I am not OK with it being open anymore--like, if I am dating a guy, I want him all to myself now.  At the beginning of the relationship we discussed how it would be an open one but I have kind of changed my mind.  So I want to end things with him.  However, I still really like him, and I do things like go online all the time to see if he is on and IM him, and like I want to text him a lot... Not a whole lot, but it definitely isn't helping my getting over him and not wanting to be with him anymore.  So, does anyone know how I can overcome the temptation to contact him?  I am not contacting him excessively, just a little bit, but it is not conducive to forgetting about him and moving on.  I really just want things to end with him because I can't be in this kind of relationship anymore, but I am still so attracted to him! help!

20090304204106AAdHzrK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this possible (sex and old age)?	For a couple to have good, even steamy sex, for years and years and years. Until they're old and gray?      I'm just wondering if the stories of "snow in the roof, fire in the furnace" are really true. If you know what I mean. I guess I just can't envision both things put together (great sex + old age). No disrespect, of course.

Ok today this guy I know named Troy randomly texted me, "Do you go to summer camp?" I was like, "No, why?" He was like, "I was just wanting to find some people who would come with me." I was like, "Oh, which camp." Then we got into a discussion. The truth is- I really like Troy and I want to go to summer camp with him. I've heard a few rumors but do you think he wants me to go, or is just being friendly? Do you think I should go if he brings it up again? My parents were already considering shipping me off there anyways.

20090304195809AAs3Rwc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Frustrated, Why won't my husband believe in my faithfulness?	It's starting to get frustrating.  He reads my diary goes through my phone checks my email, I don't lie to him he knows where I'm at at all times.  It doesn't bother me or never has as long as he's willing to do the same for me.  It's kinda like getting a receipt so there's proof when question of purchase ever comes up.  I feel better when he knows whats going on in my life, I want him to be part of it.   I do everything in my power to try to prove he's everything to me.  Yet he still questions me.  He doesn't believe I went to a womens bible study called sweet tuesdays last night, I stayed an hour late just chatting with the other women there.  It just felt good to have a break not having my 1 1/2 yr old and my 2 month old permantly attached for a little bit.  He thinks it's suspicious cuz I staid late cuz I never do.  Then when I tried to tell him about my night he told me whatever which pissed me off and well it boiled down to I'm supposed to be sleeping on the couch.     I just want to go in there and beat him with a pillow I'm so frustrated I don't know on whether I want to cry or just let my temper get ahold of me and jolt him awake with a screaming throwing stuff temper tantrum.  What is his deal why is he so angry with me and why does he refuse to believe me?  Does he just want out?

20090304200206AA9LlDA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can get some mature advice please?	My friend has these roomates and one night, I had a makeout session with on of them. He wanted to have sex but I said no and left. Even though I like him, he is a complete manwhore so it will go nowhere. I have been talking to my friends other roomate, whom I grew to like because he actually wants a gf and respects women, unlike the other guy. Apperently, my friend told him that I liked him and he was excited and said that he should do something about that. Next time we hung out, he started talking to me more and asking me about myself (this was when we both were drinking). But whenever we are around each other sober, he doesnt really say much (maybe its because the guy that I kissed is always aroundt?) My friend told me that he said he is a little shy when it comes to asking girls out and he is used to girls chasing him (im used to guys chasing me lol) How should I react around him? I want him to ask me out but I dont want to throw myself on him. I go over to their house a lot but they are always watching tv so I cant really talk to him. What should I do? He is 23 btw
20090304205817AAfoVuf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I considered a whore?	One night, I partied with my friend's friend. He was talking to me the whole night and asked for a kiss but I said no and told him I just got out of a relationship. As time passed by, I started drinking more and a couple hours later, he tried again and I kissed him back. We were making out on the couch while everyone else was asleep and he started to run his hand all over my chest. I kept taking his hand off but he kept doing it so much that after a while, I gave up and let him touch my boob. He also tried to get his hand down my pants but I didnt let him. He then put my hand down his pants and that is when I realized that I shouldnt be doing this. I quickly got my hand out of there and left. I know that I didnt sleep with him but would I be considered a whore for the other stuff?

20090304193938AAdIJuL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is HE doing THIS to me, soooo confusing!!!!??	Me & my ex went out for 2 months, 2 yrs ago. We met at university. He lived on campus so we would meet up at school, & we would cuddle, kiss, study, or watch movies on his computer. But we never had sex cuz he knew I wanted to save it for marriage. HE ended it, but he would still talk to me on msn even when it was over & has asked to see me before but I turned him down.  2 months ago on msn he said we should meetup & asked for my number.  He texted me a week later & said he wants to see me. When I wanted to follow-up on that text, he said he had to cancel cuz he was busy. Then 2 weeks ago he texted me & cancelled but we never even planned anything! He said he had to get his wisdom teeth done & couldn’t see me in the weekend but we have NEVER said we would meet up that week anyways haha. Then this past Sunday he said he wants to see me “sometime during the week” for dinner or drinks. I replied back & told him I’m busy with work and can’t meet up.  But I also said that I might be able to see him after March 15 when my schedule is less busy. He said he agrees & that we should plan later. Why does he keep planning to meet me but then cancels?  He did tell me that he misses me when I asked why he wants to see me, he even made a comment about how beautiful I am.  BUT If he REALLY misses me and REALLY wants to get to know me like he says, then WHY doesn’t he try to talk to me more when I go on msn?? Or even to call me??? Why does he only TEXT me?   I forgot to mention that 1 yr ago he asked to see me. He picked me up, took me to a movie, barely spoke then drove me home. It was so bad. I don’t want it to be like last time. WHY does he keep trying to pop back into my life??? Some may say sex, but could he just miss me & think I’m the one that got away???
20090304201657AAni6Yj	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend whines about everything?	She has some real issues with her family, guys she dates and her whole life in general. Her dad wants to kill her mom (literally) and they live in the same house even though they are divorced because she and her mom just moved from a different province. She's a really nice person and I like being friends with her but lately she's been complaining so much about this guy and how she's depressed about her life but it seems like she's causing her own misery. She's 19 and hasn't graduated school and she keeps saying how she has no future. I keep telling her it's not too late to finish school and I always reassure her that she's beautiful and not fat. I'm just tired of trying to fix her because it doesn't seem to help at all and all she can talk about now when we hang out is how she hates herself and wants to kill herself. I want her to be happy but she's wearing me out by talking about these things non stop. What do I do about our her?

Now what would be something different I can do for him for a change? Ladies, is there anything your guy loved that you've ever done? Guys, what would you want your girl to do for you? Preferably not bedroom related, but if you do have tips on spicing things up I'll take your advice in that area as well. THANKS
20090304194258AAtKxwR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I give the guy another chance?	I met this guy named Eric (he's 24) and we hung out for the first time last night. We just drove around town. He seems like a really sweet guy and he's easy to talk to but tonight when he asked me if I wanted to go out for pizza, he said he couldn't afford to pay for me and asked if I could pay my own way. He said his sister was going to pay his way and he said he couldn't afford $6 to pay my way. When I kind of said something, he managed to get money from his parents to pay my way but I wound up not going. I was a little freaked out. I've just never had a guy ask me to pay my own way before. He's 24, still lives at home and works at Subway. I was brought up that a guy should pay on dates (especially at first and maybe a girl can pay every now and then but a guy should always pay, especially when you first start dating) and I just thought it was kind of tacky he couldn't afford $6 to pay my way and that I'd have to pay for my own dinner on our first date. Like I said, he's kind of got a problem keeping a job and jumps from one fast food job to another. He used to work at Braum's (an ice cream store), then Arby's for 3 months and he's been at Subway for 2 weeks now. He's had a bunch of other jobs too. He's admitted he has a bad history with jobs and he said he's even walked off a job to be with his upset girlfriend when she called him at work upset. He says he's going to try to become a guard at the local jail but he worked there before and quit. So I'm not sure whether I should believe him when he says he'll keep this job or not. He also calls and text messages me a LOT. If I don't pick up my phone or text him back right away, he'll call and text me several more times. It kind of freaks me out and tonight when I got real busy, I asked him to chill and he still kept texting me a lot. I want someone who's got something going for him and I'm not sure if he does and I'm not sure if I should give him a chance. Maybe I'm overreacting. He is a sweet guy and I'm scared I won't find someone as sweet as him again but I've got some reservations...should I give him another chance or just let him go?

20090304202902AAVweKn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I went out with a guy, we had an amazing date we totally connected, and now...?	About 4 days later I still hadn't heard from him so I texted saying what a good time I had on our date and that if he wasn't into me that he should just let me know and that I thought he was an amazing person regardless. He texted back saying his mom had just had surgery (she had a terminal condition and the surgery was spur of the moment because it was a transplant) that he was sorry he hadn't contacted me and that he would call me soon. That was 2 weeks ago...      I guess I don't understand, I'm sure if he was interested he would have made some sort of contact in the last two weeks, but why wouldn't he just take the opportunity to break it off with me when I texted him initially? Am I wrong to assume that he isn't interested anymore? I should add that we met on an online dating site and talked for a month before meeting, so when we met, we really knew each other. Also, he has been on the dating site a couple times since we went out, but has not messaged me at all. What should I do, just forget him?
20090304192729AAyf6YP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are men so selfish?	These men that I regarded as my friends seem a bit... cold on me all of the sudden. They were just helping me with their native language since I was in another country (this was in Europe). Since then, I took a vacation back in the US and decided to stay because I prefer it here (and for school). Three of them kept suggesting that I find another job and one said he'll help me find one (in their country) the other seemed disappointed with me and got quiet and he too asked if I was willing to let go of my "dreams". One of them got angry at me and told me that they had to go! I asked one of them why he was trying to get me back over there and he said that it was because I was "too far from him"      WTH? Did they mark their territory or something? It's just ridiculous!

My husband works really hard and supports his family like a good man is supposed to. We been together for almost four years now. I am five months pregnant. My emotions could have something to do with all of this but I am not shure. I think he might feel for someone els at work because he seems to ignore me allot.

How do you show a girl your interested in them as a potential romantic partner without telling them. It seems with me that when I'm interested in a girl they are oblivious to it and eventually I fall into the friend zone. Then when they finally find out (like I try to kiss them, or whatever) most of the time they'll freak out and say they don't think of me that way. I've been talking to this new girl and I've done my best to make it clear what intentions are. Like when we talk I try to make a joke that hints that I like her. But I could use some other guidelines. Thanks.

Okay, so me and Tommy( current ex boyfriend) got into a fight last night once again because of a rumor going around about him at his job and i heard it from my mom's best friend too. Well, he told me last night that we were done and he never even called me last night once. He called me about five different times today, and I called him about three times. Well, he tells me that he loves me and he really does want things to work out between me and him right now, but he don't want a relationship at the moment. His mom said i wasn't allowed back at their house for some odd reason and i feel kinda bad for doing what i did but i had to tell him i needed a couple days to think and i am still thinking. What do you think i should do about this? Please just don't be hateful cause this is serious and i really need to know what you guys think i should do. I told him that i loved him too, and i really truly do want things to work out but he has to start doing a few things before we get back together. so please, help me out. i'd appreciate it a lot =) 10 points to the best answer

20090304204657AAY1Wt7	Family & Relationships;Friends	Difficult situation..what to do?	My situation is that I'm starting to lose A LOT of respect for my close friend of five years. We’re in college now, and she is so wasted half the time that she does not know what guys she comes in contact with, and she's starting to think she's some real hot stuff for being a party girl. She tries to be "understanding" about my decision not to drink, but she's very phony about it. I also have a lot of medical reasons for not drinking, but she's so ignorant and insensitive to my situation.      I almost feel as though I don't want her in my life anymore. However, she's one of the few close friends I have left from high school, and being in a tough major, it's hard for me to find time or energy to make other friends.Also, she's always been there for me in the past, through bad relationships and tough times in general, and especially when I first transferred to this school.      Overall, I feel like both of us are just changing. I feel as though she's just not worth my time anymore, but would it be a good idea to just cut her out of my life?She just gets me so pissed...she has no respect for herself or anyone else, she’s just in college to screw around and waste her parent’s money…and I feel like I'm going to blow up on her any day now. What do you think I should do?
20090304200323AAyqmXu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think I am pregnant, but I don't want to have an abortion?	I suspect I'm pregnant & and I am currently waiting for my boyfriend to come home from a college-baseball trip.  He comes back in 5 days, and we're going to take  home pregnancy test.  I've had some symptoms and that "knowing" feeling.      I am 17; 18 in a month.  I am nearly a 4.0 student, and  junior in college (I'm way ahead, I know - it makes it worse).  I'm a Christian, and my parents are pretty conservative.  I have so many expectations from family, peers, teachers...ETC.      I decided to have sex with my boyfriend - I just felt ready.  We used protection, but it's not always 100% effective.      I made plans with my sister to go to Rome, Italy next fall semester, and I feel guilty that that plan is shot down.  My Italian professor has made so many arrangements to get us in to a program, too.      Abortion has always been something I am completely against.  The ONLY reason abortion crosses my mind are societal expectations.  I mostly fear my father!  My boyfriend, you see, is 22.  It's so hard for me to connect on the same level with peers of my age.  I mean, I've been in college for 3 years; how can someone expect me to "mingle" with high school students (no offense).      If the test turns out positive, I want to tell my mom, but I am so scared of my father.  He's the type of person who acts only on first-hand emotion.  He would go after my boyfriend, and hurt him.  There's no way to rationalize his thoughts at first.  He can be crazy.      In my own opinion, a baby would make me happy, of course; however, like I said, I am so scared of what people would think of me!      Any advice is appreciated very much!
20090304195928AAS2XEu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my girlfriend going to try to get into my pants? lol.?	Ok. The last time my girlfriend was over, we were making out and things got pretty hot. I ended up lifting her shirt and fingering her while we kissed. It was pretty passionate. So now I am a little curious to know if the next time she comes over, she will attempt to umm... return the favor. I kind of have mixed feelings about it. From a girl's perspective, do you think she will be expecting to grab me inappropriately?? lol.
20090304193955AAIg9uz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do girls like to have their breasts kissed and fondled?	I am a little confused.

20090304205325AAfbICd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do i do about this guy?	well i like him.   then made it watever because he had a thing with a chick.   then we hung out and made those feelings come back.   i like him.   he likes me.   but isnt the relationship type.   what should i do?   keep trying?   stop?
20090304203602AAPxqnT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He said I love you and we have only been hanging out/talking for a week...?	Its a long story, and I will spare you the details, but we have a crush on each other. First I approached him and called him cute, then he approached me a few days later and asked for my number. We have been hanging out and talking/texting a lot. He said he feels strongly enough for me to say I love you.          When you guys say "I love you" a month or less after meeting someone,       do you mean it?
20090304203635AAURG1S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does my crush seem to like me back?	after school  we hung out for a while   when she had to leave we kinda hugged then she kinda kneed me in the balls. we make each other laugh alot.   then today on MSN. she kept dropping stuff like "i love you baby" and whatever. even though it was sort of a joke.   her friends talk to me alot and whenever i walk by i hear my name somehwheres   im pretty bad at figuring stuff like this out

20090304193835AAA4ZFA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he interested? (I need your help :)?	So here's the deal...i have the reputation of being a good girl. I'm really involved with my church and everything, and i pretty much never date anyone because i have pretty high standards. I'm 16 and i haven't had my first kiss..so yeah lol   well there's this guy in one of my classes. He is the exact opposite of what I would normally look for in a guy, and he's not a virgin, he cusses, etc. but he doesn't drink or do grugs or anything. Before I was in this class with him, i thought he was kind of quiet and "cool", but being in this class with him i realize he is hilarious, and I find myself extremely attracted to him, but I can't tell if he would be interested in me. He always talks to me in that class, and he always always hits on me, but he's an extreme goofball and everyone pretty much just laughs at him. However, I've noticed that he hits on me more than other girls in the class...his actual seat is across the room from me, but he always ends up sitting near me and talking to me and my friends. He's always joking and stuff, saying this like, "hey baby can I have your number?" just goofy stuff like that, and I'm always like whatever and I start laughing. because it's hard to tell if he's serious...like what if i were to give him my number and he was like, i was just kidding.... you know? But the day before yesterday he called his number from my phone and was like, why is my number in your phone? he was joking around, and I was like whatever bryan, you just did that i saw you. it wasn't until yesterday that i realized maybe he did that so he could get my number. It's just really hard to tell if he's interested or not..I mean i can't see him going for a girl like me, but he always winks at me and calls me his girlfriend stuff. Today after school he caught up to me and was like, why didn't you wait for me? You're my girlfriend we're supposed to walk together..and i just laughed and everything. I can't tell if he's interested! Help?!

20090304185740AAuJgwc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I "pleasure" her? Doing it better?	I'm eighteen - my girlfriend's seventeen. While I'm not a virgin (and neither is she) we slept together, for the first time, after dating for about three weeks. I'm just wondering the norm, really - she was breathing heavy, groaning a little and letting out medium-loud moans (you know) every so often. Was I pleasuring her, or... is there more?      Not to get too graphic, but there was a point where was she moaning loudly, scratching my back, grinding against me and all. How can I get to the 'next level?' What else can I do for her? How can I "do" it better?

20090304193532AA8XZFC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do You Think He Is Interested Or Just Being Friendly?	I like this guy, and hopefully he doesn't know.   Today I was in the bus every time he said something out loud he would turn to look at me, but I pretended not to see him even though i did.   When he said "Hi" to me i just gave him a quick smile then looked at a girl which was my friend and gave her weird faces like giving her a sign that, that was weird. When I turned back to look at him he was still smiling at me which that's really weird.   Later he turned to and said "I Play The Piano" i nodded my head and smiled.   Then when I was leaving he said "Bye (my name), have a nice day." i just left.   He also pronounced my name wrong, he is like 2 years older then me too !      So Do You Think He Is Interested Or Just Being Friendly?         Thanks In Advance !

20090304191803AAAe8Wh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS what do you think about makeup and hair color?	So I was talking to one of my friends, and he says he likes his girls "natural." But when I said that means no hair dye and no makeup, he backs up and said that's not exactly what he meant.      Guys do you like it when girls wear makeup? I'm not just talking mascara and eyeliner, I mean foundation and cover-up to mask gross zits too. If a girl dyes her hair, does that bother you as well?      Would you prefer no makep, no hair color, etc? Or do you not mind your girl looking good, even if it is somewhat fake?

20090304204753AArVGzo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How far along do you think she is?	I have a guy friend who I am very close to.  He started dating a girl in mid January.  They had sex for the first time January 31.  They seem to really adore each other since the first day that they met.  Her supposed last period was in January sometime.  I'm nt for sure but anyways.  They took a pregnancy test and she is pregnant.  Went to the Health Department and according to her last period she will be 7 weeks this week.  She seems to be already showing.  I asked her on Saturday because everyone has noticed her baby bump.  She held up her shirt and I felt her belly.  Its not like mine and all jiggly.  Its hard and rounded off up high not down low.  I'm concerned because I didn't start to show until I was like almost 5 months.  She said she thought it was because she has been so bloated.  Idk but my friend is so excited.  I have tried to bring it up in nice ways.  Anyways, I feel that she has told a few untruths already and he doesn't really even know her that well.  Everyone not only me has noticed her obvious roundness.  I don't know what to do but I feel like the baby isn't his.  She goes to pee non stop but I know that this is normal but I'm thinkin if they had sex on 31st then she could only have conceived like atleast 4 wks ago and so she shouldn't be feeling these signs.  And she has had morning sickness once that I know of.  They go by the date of your last period, so that explains the 7wks thing but the belly is there.  I don't know.  Just worried.  Has anyone started showing this early on or experienced bloating that made you look very pregnant when you weren't?

"lets go spy on her and see if she has her periods"      the hell?.      she was a really nice girl. till this happened.   so she did.. i didnt though. & she decided oh im just going to tell the group that she did and i heard her.      so the whole group knew. so what?   but i overreacted cause it started to spread and i this is what i told her   "your a *****. i didnt have my periods. and it gives you know right to invade my privacy by spying on me"      she was hurt and all. & she cried.   but she deserved it i thought. so then;; she was all "im not hanging round you guys anymore"      then i wrote her a letter saying she changed and the group would like the old one of her back. i printed pictures of her favourite cartoon and funnny pictures of her from before but she got offended cause i crossed out words;; admitted;; purposely.  like the word;; dipshit and friends forever. .cause i was still pissed.      & threw a hissy fit and left to some other people.   she told one of her friends that i didnt like her;; and i'd always roll my eyes when she hugged me.      truth is ;; i did roll my eyes or gave a puzzled look. but i didnt hate her.   & now her friend wont talk to me.      THEN TODAY;; she went and told one my close friends that i didnt like shopping with her cause she drags us around to pointless shops and i wanted to get shopping done.      i did do that. but i told her not to tell anyone cause i trusted her with my secrets.   so i went and fixed it with my close friend saying i was sorry and i did say it.      i want to say something to her but she gets really touchy and all pissy. & i really just want to tell her that i dont want to do this .

Like I see all these guys on here saying"OOOh no! I don't have a gf" "aww how do I get a gf" .  What is wrong with these guys?  Can't these guys be a Man and be independent?  It is so annoying they are almost annoying as girls.  I don't understand it, why would they want all the lovey-dovey stuff?  I would hate it if I had to say "I love you" to the same person every day, and if I had to talk to the same person every day and hear the same laugh every day and look at the same *** every day and see the same ugly face every day when they wake up (before the makeup I mean, they get hot with makeup).

20090304185557AARZ4ht	Family & Relationships;Family	Question about mother having a boyfriend? Moving out issues?	Okay, here's the situation.   There's a teenager named Joe. Joes mom has a very bad boyfriend as she somehow manages to pick the worst boyfriends ever throughout her life. Joes' moms boyfriend owns a farm, and makes Joe do a large amount of labor, and while Joe is doing the labor, his moms boyfriend constantly tells him how horrible he is, what a piece of trash he is, etc. So, Joes friend Bob allows Joe to move in with him. Joes mother is okay with this, and tells Joe that he doesn't need to do anymore work at their house and that he can live with Bob. But, Joes moms boyfriend is not okay with this, He tells Joe to come back, and leaves messages of how Joe needs to come back on the phone. However, his mom says he does not need to return. Can Joes' moms boyfriend do anything? Technically he has no custody correct? Also, joe is 17, 2 1/2 months from being 18, so we are dealing with a basically adult here. What do you think? Isnt this like a stranger telling someone what to do? Help please!

I was at a family gathering . as is quite common in the west they were castrating calves without painkillers. 2 of my aunts let their kids watch  one girl about 9 and boy about 7.  the girl kept asking real loud what are they doing and why does aunt sandy have a knife.  the little boy was looking real pale when they actually started to castrate the first calf. an older girl cousin laughed and said don/t worry tony they don't castrate little boys. and everyone laughed .  when the little girl saw what was happening she yelled "look she is cuttin off his balls make her stop." i thought that kids that young should not be there. have any of you seen young kids watch animals being castrated? what did you think? at what age is this ok

All my friends are getting into fights and I think its my fault. :[ It started at lunch, a new girl came to sit at our table and my other friend started talking to her more, I was ok with that, 'cause i usually just do homework at lunch, but then she started making fun of me right in my face, and it wasn't just in a fun way, she said I look like i'm on crack! Then i got mad and stopped talking to her, so she went around and told people i was being a bi***. After that i dont talk to her and i'm not her friend but i still sit at the table, so the new girl became friends really fast with a bunch of my friends, she even became best friends with one of them. Then when the new girls best friend heard that i wasn't friends with the girl that was making fun of me she got mad, and go into a fight with the new girl. Now no one is friends with the girl that made fun of me and i'm not friends with the new girls best friend. What should I do?? Is it my fault??

20090304190014AAQ52lM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it bad to sleep with an ex?	I slept with my ex boyfriend last night. We've only been broken up a week. It was amazing, and neither of us regretted it. And afterwards it was just like it used to be between us, he was hugging me and kissing me. He told me it definatley wasn't the last time either. But he said he didn't want be in a relationship right now, with anyone. I know he's not seeing other girls. We went out for lunch today, and he reassured me again that it wasn't a mistake, but it can't happen all the time. He said that he still doesn't want to be with me yet. Is it bad to keep sleeping with him, or will it bring him back? He was so clingy afterwards, so i thought that would bring him back... but i'm not sure.

Sooner or later he and i are going to talk about why im being so distant from him if i still like him etc. And to tell you the truth i don't want to talk about it i don't want to see him and i don't care (right now). I like this guy so much hes so special we created something so special and cute, but things changed for some reason(well honestly i know the reason i just don't know how to lay it on him b/c it will hurt him---hes a dork sometimes!). Really there's lots of reasons why i stoped liking him, i just don't know how to tell him when he talk to me today...like what do i tell him? And i don't want to hurt him, not by telling him that i don't like the way he acts sometimes but because i just stoped liking him. Guys this will hurt him SO much, he already does act super heart broken, he talks to all my teachers and tells them our problems and they come up to me and ask me "...do something about ... you get him so sad..BLAH". What should i do? I want to tell him we need to go our separate ways but i don't want to hurt him....

He treats me like a princess and acts like nothing   else matters.      but there's ONE PROBLEM,   He doesn't go to my school but he's talked to ALOT   of girls that go there and girls that i don't even KNOW   are messaging me on myspace and telling me to "watch   my back" because he's a BIG player.I've talked to him   about it and it seems to make him feel really bad. ;/   He said that he has talked to alot of girls and that the reason   he ended it with them was because they are too much of   party animals.

20090304190631AAuOWDg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Exactly what does a boyfriend do?!?	I'm 17, she's 16.      My girlfriend and I have been together for five months now, and those months have been the most wonderful ones of my entire life. We go out nearly twice a month and see each other every day, and it's great. However, she disagreed.      She has an abstinence pledge, one that she got before we began to date and one that I have respected and plan to continue respecting. As such, I had kept things like making out and fondling out of the relationship, as they would lead to a place I thought she wouldn't like to go.      Intriguingly enough, she called me last week and said that I was hurting her by not indulging in her physically. We talked about it, and agreed that it's okay if we do get intimate, so long as we know where the limits are.      My delimma comes here. For the last week that we've changed our relationship from one of intellect and hand-holding to one of a more intimate nature, we've enjoyed ourselves than ever. Therein lies my question.      What does a boyfriend do? Does he take a girl places and hold her hand, or does he serve as a sexual object for her (and vice versa)? Have I done something wrong by trying to avoid physical things?

I mentioned surgery, she said what for, and I told her (circumcision), and said how I know it's usually for babies but my doc recommended it so I decided to "take it like a man, lol." Then I told her if she had any questions out of curiosity she could ask.      I can tell she is still interested from her reply...but in response to the surgery she said, "You are very brave for going through a circumcision at your age. And no, no questions/comments about it. Enough said."      Do you think it was a weird subject for her? Awkward? Girls what would you be thinking in that situation?

I didnt really want to and he kept gettting mad and hitting me and telling me to do it.I almost did it but then i made another excuse to leaave again lol. Then i came back and he kept hugging me.Then i told him we were moving next year and he said "No,i dont want you to leave" And i was like -_-      And then he spent the night last night and when i was on the computer he put his arm around me and sat on the chair with me and i was like "Um,ok........" Thats the 3rd time he did that.   So i have no idea.He also always says he likes this one girl,but he likes a lot of girls =/ And today he hugged me out of nowhere when i came outside,and waited for me for a while to come outside.   He always punches me in the boobs and today he kept making me give him piggy back rides and he kept holding onto them and stuff but he acted like he didnt know he was doing it.   And my friend gabby told me that she was talking to him one day on the stairs and he said "You know andrea? well she has big milk juggs" ans she called him weird and he said "well she does"      So my question is, whats going on, does he like me or something?   Also,im 15,so stfu please :]      Aso,he isn't a "player" or whatever,he has only had 1 gilrfriend before and he is too shy to do things.He never even kissed her. For example,if we played 7 minutes in heaven,we'd just stand in the closet because he would be too scared to do anyrthing. Dont ask me why he always grabs my boobs lol,because idk,im shocked he even has the courage to do that xD

We do talk on the phone sometimes but I always think he's going to be too busy to talk to me so I text him instead.      So is the texting an ok thing to do with a guy I like or is he going to think I don't like him because I don't call him.

20090304192147AAtBYlf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do people keep saying I like him, should I date him?	Just 2 weeks ago I became friends with this boy named Micheal. The first day we became friends we talked throughout 1st & 2nd period. These 2 guys/ our friends named Muhammad & Effie began to make silly comments like "Micheal do you like girls? What kind of girls do you like?" Because they were are friends and they were joking we just ignored them and continued to talk. We have 5th period together so I asked him if I could borrow Final Fantasy X for the PS2, and he said yes. The day after we to talked throughout 5th period. Once the period was over I waited to finish packing his book-bag so we could go to lunch. As I was waiting for him so boy came up to me and said " Hey, do you go out with him?" I immediately said no. When Micheal asked me what he said I laughed and said nothing. But after that last comment I began to feel attracted to him for some strange reason. But I'm not sure if it's just me or if I'm pressuring myself into liking him because that's what others think and want. I talk and text to friends for help but I'm still not sure about what to do.    Just today at lunch we were both talking to each other and a guy sitting next to us. He said that black and red are his favorite colors and I said "Black's my favorite color too as well as dark green, blue, and gray. After that we continued to talk till the guy said "You guys should date." We both looked up and said no. In all my years of being around guys I've had anybody accuse me of liking that guy or even dating him.   Though I continue to think about him and feel attracted to him, though I have my doughts. I'm sure if I really like or if I feel pressure to like him. I'm only a freshman in high and both my parents and my brother are over protective and don't think I should date untill I'm 18 or 30. lol

20090304192740AA2IDCY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, should I have apologized to her...?	Okay, I am seventeen. My girlfriend is normally a very quiet and sweet girl, and she means so much to me. A couple of weeks ago, though, we got into a really big fight at a party of a mutual friend. She said that I never gave her any attention and was too busy flirting around with her friends. This isn't true. She and I both screamed some really hurtful things at each other, and it ended with me telling her that she didn't mean anything to me (again, untrue) and her leaving in tears. Today was the first day that we've spoken to each other since, and it seemed to be going well. Then, just as I thought we were getting somewhere, she asked if I was going to apologize. I felt like this was kind of a shot at me, so I told her that I refused to apologize. Well, this led to another argument, and I was wondering: was I wrong for not apologizing? And am I horrible person for what I yelled at her?

20090304193532AAYIsbH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I still try to hint it, or should I just get over it?	Should I let him know I like him or should I wait?   I like this guy and I see him only 2 days a week during class. We're friends, we call each other sometimes, and sometimes we go for coffee after class and he always offers to help me with school, Like he's already telling me to come to him if I need help, and he is very nice. But other than that, we never chilled on days we don't have classes together.      Do you think I he might be into me or just a nice guy?      He has no clue I like him, cause I really don't show it.. What do I do to let him know that I'm interested in him, without switching from being a cool friend to someone too flirty.. Except that I let him know that I thought he was goodlooking, by commenting on one picture on facebook(lame i know :P)      Someone told me to wait till he shows that he likes me cause he's just being a nice guy right now. But he's very driven, not the type that's gonna try something unless he knows that there's something there and unless he wants to..      And recently he helped me again with school, but after class, i jokingly asked him to walk with me, he was like "I have to take the subway, why don't you walk with us!"..and I felt that this said everything, about him being interested in me or not...      So should I just forget about him, or still try to fight for it..?
20090304204642AAPIDsJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My teacher's behavior, smiles, confuses me...?	I'm in college, i'm 19ys old, and I'm doing forth year french, and my teacher(he is french from france) is around 26years old, and at first I thought he really didn't like me, cause he would never pick me but then one day, when I actually read in class(my first language is france french btw), i read well, and from that day he always smiled at me or laughed when I'm reading something wrong and I correct myself. And on debates and all the assignment I get really good marks, and he complimented me on my french, and he overheard my conversation with my friends, and mentioned what we were talking about in class and kept looking and smiling at me, as if letting me know that this information concerns me and might help, and then each time I'm gonna go up to him, he develops this smirk/smile on his face(makes him even more cute), and he agrees to everything I ask him, but gives his opinion as well, and a few days ago, he asked the class a question, and i looked up he was looking at me and smiled, i smiled back, he looked away(at the class) and turned to smile at me again, then i was hoping the class didnt see that, so I looked down for a while, and i looked up again(with a smile still on my face), he was till looking then he looked away...      Could he possibly/unknowingly being nice and everhything to me cause he's interested in me or is it just normal?
20090304194112AAGsKG0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is it SOo hard to find a boyfriend for me? Is it because Im BBW? No.. that's not it right?	I think guys might be intimidated by me. Im in high school. I get Great grades, 4.0 G.P.A. Im president of our class. Im in student council. I run a lot of things at our school, lets just say. When I meet guys they're always no good for me. Doing wrong in life and just ABOUT NOTHING! I am a BBW ( big beautiful woman). So is this why they dont talk to me? Or is it the leadership? Sometimes I feel like some guys are intrested in me they way they play around with me. But I think I blow them off because, I feel like they'll hurt me or something. What do you think?

We met back in december and we decided to keep seeing each other. the only problem was is that he lived 5 hrs away from me but we make it work to see each other at least every 3rd week. We talked and emailed each other everyday. untill one day he said that it wasn't working out and we were moving too fast. he wanted to be friends and I agreed. So just last sunday we decided to meet up. And he told me he was sorry for making me feel like crap and that he thought the relationship was moving too fast and stuff. But we ended up sleeping with each other that night and he also had no problem using no protection with me. We now just email each other whenver we get a mintute to.

20090304194707AA2xOJ1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He's just not that into me...... is he?  Advice please?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for over three years and we now have a month old son. But im still not sure if he's really into me, if this is what he really wants. I cant tell. About 8 months ago, I found out I was pregnant then {at the same time} found out that he had cheated on me. I always questioned it, but he always denied it until he was backed into a corner. He finally admitted it to me and told me it only happened one time about 2 years ago when he was drunk for his birthday. He hurt me so bad, not the fact that he cheated on me because I already knew he did, but the fact that he didnt come clean until he knew that i knew the truth. And now, 9 months later i still dont trust him, i try but he always does something to make me doubt him again. I dont think he's really trying for my forgiveness. I know that i ***** at him alot, and i always bring that up and now he says that he really doesnt care anymore if i trust him or not. We were engaged before it happened and now he says that im rushing him to get married. (3 years, a house, and one kid later) I dont know what to do anymore, I really want it to work, but im still not sure about him and how he feels about me. I know your probably going to say move on and that i can find someone else and I know i can, but idk how, he's all I ever wanted and i want my son to grow up with his mom and dad together like i did, im just not sure that'll happen but i want to try........ am i that naive?

I'm a huge metalhead into stuff like Cynic, Atheist, Opeth and other assorted metal bands that normally get lumped in the "scary devil music" pile and I dress the part as well... The part I find weird though is that I'm almost always not attracted to that in a women... I've always preferred the "sweet girl next door" as mentioned in the title aka the cliche "beauty and the beast" type thing... so what I am asking is if any other guys have this sort of thing going on and if girls would ever go for that type of person... Oh and I'm more of an introvert than my image may project...

20090304194942AAqGwxm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is there something really wrong with me?	As I grew up, I began to realize that I'm not like any other guy.      I'm not gay, and I'm not straight.      What I mean by this is, I seem to have multiple fetishes (and I'm not talking about just 2 or 3... I'm into 8 different fetishes, not kidding), and it doesn't matter if it's a guy or a girl wearing it.      For example... I have a major fat fetish. I don't care if it's on a guy or a girl, but I just love fat. I don't get off to the person, I get off to the fatty tissues in their belly...      What the hell is wrong with me?

20090304195315AAkEcK0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How would you interpret this behavior?	I know, I know. Another question looking to dissect the complicated and often stupid behavior of boys. This is killing me though. There is a guy who sits next to me in one of my classes and seems to be really shy (or perhaps unfriendly?). I say hello to him every day and the most I can expect from him is a forced "hi". But, for some reason, for the past few days, several of his limbs have been touching mine on various occasions (his thigh brushed up against mine, our arms touched, etc). At first I thought they were accidents, but they happen repeatedly, and each time he does not move his arm or leg for what seems to be a long while (longer than one would expect someone to come to the realization that what they just touched was not a table or something else but a person). Do you think this could be intentional, and what does it mean?   P.S. I'm sorry to be using this public forum to ask something as infantile as this. I'm sure it's probably nothing, but it would be nice to get an outside and unbiased opinion on the matter.

20090304195528AATqrIu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would this mean?	This guy found out that I liked him.  At work one night he just started telling me, "I know."  He wouldn't ever tell me what he knew.  Then a few days later, he started it again saying, "I know."  So finally, I said, "I'm glad you know because I don't know what you know."  He said, "I am pleased to know this, I'll tell you later."  Anyway, tonight he told me he knew that I liked him.  He almost didn't tell me because people spread rumors.  He said if he didn't work there he wouldn't have had a problem telling me what he knew.  Anyway, I'm still left not knowing if he likes me or not.  Please give me your advice. Thanks.

20090304195618AA20SM6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is my boyfriend acting this way?	My boyfriend and I have been together for about 8 months now.  Everything has been great, but now things seem so stressful.  Coming into the relationship I knew he was older than me and that I was younger (I'm 20 and he's 25), I had no problem with that.  Now that he lives with his sister (she's 21) and her boyfriend (he's 23) he's been going out more.  I don't mind this, I know he's 25 and can go to bars and I can't...but I can't help but feel so left out :( ! I know it sounds childish but now when we all hang out all I hear about is them being at the bar or something at the bar or whatever.  I don't wnat them to adjust things just becaues I won't be 21 for another 5 months, but my boyfriend has been so inconsiderate about it.   For example, the weekend before St. Patrick's Day he wants to go visit his friends who are married and both 27 who live an hour away.  He wants to go bar-hopping with them to celebrate.  However, he asked me if I could BABY-SIT their kids while they go out for like 3 hours, then they would come back and hang out with me.  This really pissed me off!  I told him it pissed me off and that I wouldn't do it (especially since they have a newborn who almost freaking died last week) and he said that it was okay that they had another babysitter lined up if I couldn't.  So then I asked him if I could drive there and meet them when they were done bar-hopping and he said "No, because then that's rude to them, because basically you're saying that you didn't wnat to babysit their kids." I was so hurt by this.   I've expressed to him that this upsets and that it sucks that I'm not 21 yet and all he says is "get over it and stop acting like a little girl".     Our relationship used to be perfect, now I feel hurt a lot...it's like he's a different person now and it upsets me so much.   Can someone please help me?

20090304195732AAkQqjg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	PARENTS!-still have to parent together what would you do?	My ex and I have two daughters together, He wants to take our daughters for the weekend or overnight. I've got a few problems   1 when he takes them he doesn't bring them home when he says he will   2 he only wants to take our oldest daughter and he has been gone for two months and our youngest daughter doesn't remember him so I think she needs some one on one time with him too   3 I have had to go pick them up before because he waits until 9 or 10 to call and say its late they might as well stay the night again   4 his girlfriend whom he left us for calls me to tell me that she is the one taking care of my kids when they are with him   5 they drink and smoke around their kids      I offered him the chance to stay with them at my apartment while I go out for the day, or even let them stay at my apartment for the weekend while I stay with a friend, So I wont have to worry if he will bring them back or if I have to find out where they are to pick them up when he doesn't show. He calls and asks to take our oldest only.   Does it look like he just doesn't want anything more to do with being a father to them? I just dont trust him with them for days so I asked him to start with the day visits but he says he won't see them unless he can take them...   IF YOU ARE A PARENT please let me know what you think.

20090304200200AAIygAn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I learn how to date?	This may sound crazy but I am 45 years old and it seems that I don't know how to date.  I've only been in two relationships, one of them long term both times the women approached me.  I am shy and uncomfortable whenever I'm around a woman who is "available" but otherwise I'm relaxed and easy going.  I hate the idea of online dating it just seems wrong to scroll through profile listings like I'm shopping for a car.  I'm also uncomfortable with the idea if I go out with someone and I realize after a couple of dates I'm not interested then I have the unpleasant task of telling her.  I have never felt comfortable with any of this but wish I could get over my issues and at least try to find someone.  Am I a lost cause?

20090304200515AAyD6Iz	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Do you think we are too young to get engaged?	Hi everyone. I'm 19 years old and my long-term boyfriend is 22, soon to turn 23. We have been together for three years and have lived together for nine months.   My boyfriend has told me that he'd like to propose to me once I turn 20, because he doesn't like the idea of a teenage engagement.   I feel very secure in my relationship and we are two very responsible adults who pay our bills, respect each other and love one another very much.   If we got engaged, I would be extremely happy, but I was just wondering what everybody else thinks of this? Do you think 20 and 23 is too young to be engaged?      Also, I'd just like to say that we would have a long engagement. I wouldn't get married until we'd been engaged for two or three years.      Thankyou :)

I mean my "little guy"  is honestly about 3 inches when hard!       The last girl I got with giggled, especially when I finished after about 2 minutes (which is unfortunately about as long as I can usually last!). Ok so thats the past, but I really wish I could somehow wow this new girl of mine in bed.      So well my main question is:      If you got with a guy like me (3 inches!), what would you be thinking when I, um, "dropped my drawers"?       And what would you be thinking after that, when things got going?      Please be honest!!!!

20090304201948AAS8pme	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for the guys and girls need some advice?	So I met this guy through my bestfriends boyfriend. Basically me and him just got out of long term relationships back in november. In the beggining he told me that if his x were to come back he would take her back which is understandable because he was with her for 4 and half years. I told him i understand do what you gotta do. However me and him started hanging out alot more mainly on the weekends. Usually me him my bestfriend and her boyfriend would go out. The other night he told me that he gets nervous and that he gets butterflies when hes around me. He told me that he feels like hes falling into lust but take the u out what ever that means.Anway he was all nervous telling me how he felt and that he feels the more he talks to me and sees me the more he doesnt care about his x gf. I told him listen work things out with her he was like but thats the thing i dont want to anymore i don't care about her anymore. To me this all seems to weird because i feel like he doenst show the intrest. We havnet even hung out just me and him by ourselfs. I dont get whats going on thru his mind. I dont know if he really does like me like he says he does or hes just confused? Oh and he told my best friend a while ago for him to hang out with a girl one on one is a big deal and when i mentioned it to him the other day he said that wasn't true but still we have not hung out by ourselves yet. Is he scared, confused or just not intrested
20090304201958AAPqIjN	Family & Relationships;Family	Should i live with my mom or dad?	My dad is SO much like me. We both are sort of computer people and we both hate doing boring work. We both love the outside and can't stand to waste a beautiful day. Me and my mom think alike. We kind of go with the same ideas and thoughts on everything. The only thing is she married right now who i consider to be my least favorite person in the world. He yells and cusses at me and i don't handle with that and i know that not being able to handle that isn't a good thing. It is just me. I break down every time. I literally cry for hours just because of five minutes of yelling. My dad does not have custody of me and he is VERY fit to. He can provide mentally, physically, and emotionally for me. I have not been in any trouble with the law ever, I am an honor roll student and always have been, I play the cello, I have played since i was 8 and I have been told i am very polite. I have lots of friends and my dad even calls me the social butterfly cause I'm always texting like 10 people and?or talking on the phone. i would really like an answer of who i should live with and what it takes to do this.

I have tried over and over again to explain to him that I have not been with hin long enough for me to tell him that I love him. So, I really don't know what to tell him any more.

What should I do?
20090304202536AAGBabG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is the next step?	There is this girl that I'm friends with and that I've always had a crush on(for about 5-6 years). Recently, I told her that I have really strong feelings for her and that I like her as more than a friend and she her response was that her life was difficult right now.  It has been about a month and a half since I told her how I felt about her and every time I ask her if she wants to see a movie or something like that she says that she is with her girlz hanging out, whether I mention that more people are going or not. I really don't know what to think because I see her talking to a lot of guys that she seems to like before talking to me and treating me like the good friends we are/"were".  What's the next thing for me to do? Any and all help and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.       P.S. I am 16 in high school if that makes it easier to get an answer. I also don't have lots of experience dating.  When I say friends, I mean that we're pretty good friends but not absolutely buddy-buddy, best friends.

20090304202543AAJVHP4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Adding someone from school on myspace that you don't even talk to?	I like this guy at school, but we don't talk. I've missed a lot of opportunities, but I was too shy to do anything. I know he knows my name 'cause we've had a few classes together from previous years and there has been talk, but it's way too little to even be called a talk. I came across his myspace one day when I was looking at a friend's friend list to see if I knew anyone.       My friends say just to add him, but I keep thinking that I'll be thought of as creepy/random. What do you guys think? Have you done something like this before?      Also, any tips on how I can get over being shy and have more confidence?

20090304202648AAtFlea	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to deal with my virgin boyfriend? Are things moving too quickly?	I started dating my boyfriend about two months ago, though we've been friends since the beginning of the academic year. I'm concerned that we may be moving too quickly sexually. I'm his first girlfriend, and he's my second boyfriend, meaning that I've had a few more sexual experiences than he has. Recently, he told me that it would be his first time, and it makes me nervous that he's rushing this - I can tell that he's a little nervous too. Is this something that I should be worried about? I'm comfortable with the idea of us having sex, we're really, really close, and we love each other, but I'm just not sure that he's ready yet. I'm worried that he thinks I want him to move more quickly than he's ready for, just because I am more experienced. Do you think he's ready just because he says he is? Or is he being pressured? I'm not sure if I should tell him that we should wait.

20090304202920AA6HUBa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I break up with a great guy just because he does not turn me on sexually?	I have been dating a man a few months and he is fantastic. We have fun together, laugh, are active and do not get bored. When it comes to the bedroom, I never felt the rush and excitement I have had in the past with other boyfriends. I felt it was a chore once and only did it to make him feel good. He does not have a large package and unfortunately I compare him to my ex because it does not fulfill my needs. On the other hand, I wonder if it would be a mistake to leave him because he is amazing! He would be a great partner and father someday. I worry if this will affect our relationship. He did notice I was distant, but it is hard to tell him he is not pleasing me because of his size.

20090304210311AANAYCD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does this guy want from me?	Ok so I met this guy (he’s 31) a while ago and we started talking a lot and so then he asked me if we could hang out sometime and I said yes. But then he told me that he just got out of a 8 year relationship with a girl about a year ago and that it’s not a date because he is not looking for anything serious. Well I was pretty dumb and went to “hang out” with him. Well then our friendship grew and we started talking on the phone every night for hours and hours. Then we started spending every weekend together from Friday to Sunday and we were sleeping with each other. He started to tell me how cute I was and how awesome I was. Also I asked what we were and he said that we were dating. Well I started to get into him a lot and I wanted a relationship with him and he said that he is not looking for anything serious and it broke my heart. He said that I need to date other people and that he wishes that I didn’t like him so much. He also said that if another girl came along and offered a date he would take it. Well anyhoo so then I started getting really upset that I could not be in a relationship with him and I asked him why are you dating then.  He said just to hang out with girls. I told him that I date with a purpose he said well I’m sure there are other guys out there for you. So then I asked him so what are we like friends with benefits and he said no because I like you more than a friend. So then I was really confused and I just needed to get over him before I got hurt even more. So then I told him that we can’t talk anymore until I got over him and he got upset that he couldn’t talk to me on the phone anymore or hang out with me. So we went a week without talking and he kept on saying he was sorry and that he really wants to talk to me. So I gave in and we started talking every night for hours again. He is now dating other girls and he tells me about them. He said that he considers me to be his best friend and he wants to be able to talk to me about these things. He says that he is really comfortable with me and always wants me to be around like his wingwoman. I still want to be with him and he does not realize that it hurts me to hear what he is doing to other women. What should I do? Do I just sit here and wait for him to date all these girls and see if he likes me the best or do I just stay his friend with benefits or do I just leave? What does he want from me? I need help please.

Okay, it really doesn't seem like he does, and he's kind of a jerk to me, but for some strange reason, I still like him. We used to be really good friends, but he started being an asshole, so I stopped talking to him as much. But anyway, I notice him looking at me a lot, even if we're far away, but then when he sees that I saw him looking at me, he'll flip me off or something. I don't think he's serious, but he doesn't laugh or anything, so I don't know. He always tries to "burn" me, by saying I don't have any friends or something gay like that, but then if I burn him back, he just tells me to shut up. Umm...i'm fairly attractive, not that that makes a difference, but I'm sure it helps a little. Maybe. Idk what else to say, lol. Any thoughts??

20090304211941AAuPKiO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why are girls like this?	these girls in my school, they are popular and kinda hot, they always tease me and say hey boyfriend and tries to hold my hand, and all their friends are usually laughing and i feel embarrassed. i'm not good looking and a bit nerdy. why do they always do that? no way they like me so tell me something else.
20090304211106AAiTmYv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If I Got Rejected Shouldn't I Be Bad With Women? (Am I A Huge Penis?)?	I was fat and had horrible self confidence till I got into college. I didn't even gain confidence till my junior or senior year, a number of years after I lost the weight. At that time I started getting really good at shooting, mixed martial arts, boxing, running etc. At the same time I completely got my heart broken by this girl that I was completely in love with. That hurt a lot it seriously took me a year to get over her, I lost weight, got depressed etc.      Since then I have no problem with women, I am extremely cocky, I say the craziest stuff. I don't know why I have confidence I just do. I will go to bars, wait for a woman to introduce herself to me, ignore her, screw with her or treat her like garbage and love to see her squirm or have a weird reaction.  Even at my work I screw with my fellow female co workers and customers. I enjoy that.      I think my experience with  women has been very negative and that is why I like to screw with them. From the jail bait lying cheating finagling one that broke my heart to the majority of the girls that have been my roommate's or friend's girlfriends they seem to be gold digging, crazy, insane, vindictive, cheating, annoying, cold, and calculating people. I sort of think maybe I am trying to get back women as a whole for all the time's I have seen my male friends cry, and get heartbroken from them. I have had roommates lives destroyed cause some girl cheated on them, one attempt suicide, others can barely live.      I am still in love with the girl that broke my heart. She still comes around looking for me, calling for me, asking my family about me. I ignore her cause I know from experience that is the only thing that hurts her and makes her crazy. It makes me happy to know that her head is spinning thinking about me. To be completely honest I like the idea that I am inflicting emotional damage to her cause of what she tried to do to me.

20090304213133AAbX2QP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Plentyoffish question?	I'm a guy in his 30's who's looking or a LTR marriage and kids.I put my profile and put the setting longterm.I have noticed most women are in the dating section.My question is since im looking for something more than dating do you think putting my profile on the longterm section scares women off? Should I switch to dating? I tried dating before and I got the impression women think I just want to play around and go on multiple dates when I just want to meet one girl that believes in the ultimate goal of marriage.My friend said putting myself on longterm means im too pushy and want to get married right away but I dont!! Just down the road with the right girl.So what should I do stay on the longterm section and maybe lose out on plenty of dates but have a chance to meet a girl that wants what I want or switch to dating and get more responses?

20090304221711AAlUQ7Y	Family & Relationships;Family	My family is try to prevent me  from going to my grandma's  burial- help?!?	Very long story short:      My nana passed a month - almost 6 weeks ago.   I was very very closer to her- she was like a mother and    best friend to me.   I took care of her for several years when she was sick and we spent a lot of time together.      She died suddenly, and my aunt the executor of her estate made the funeral arrangements.    a few hours before the funeral my aunt  called me and ask me to bring photos of my nana. ( I only had photos of us together.)   When I got to the funeral home, no one else brought photos.    My cousin made a big deal that he was not in the photos ( I don't know him well and I don't have any photos of them.)   He also made a big deal that people where asking how I was doing, and not asking about him.      as a result- he flipped out on my aunt and told her that he didn't want me to go to go to the burial.      When I asked her about burial - she told me my nanas remains where not ready.      I called the funeral home and- they are. they are scheduled to be picked up tonight.       I called her and insisted I go with them to the graveyard. ( It was my idea for the family to drive the ashes and not 'fed ex' my nana to the graveyard.)      I demanded I go with them, and I could hear her arguing with my cousin in the back ground. We are going this weekend to drop the ashes off- but I KNOW that my cousin and his wife are going to try to start drama.       please help me.       I need advice.

20090304220213AAO1HCu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you get over a girl?	I'm a 17 year old guy and i fell in love with this girl 3 years ago. We became best friends and I've been completely in love with her for the last 3 years. She's so beautiful, that I fell in love with her the second I saw her. I can't keep my eyes off of her. We've had classes together for the last 3 years and i thought she started to like me. She kept telling me that I was smart and being really flirty. Then she started to hug me all the time (especially after winning her soccer games) and she kept telling her parents about me. I kept having these strong urges to kiss her. I would get weak at the knees when I was around her and get butterflies in my stomach and I would get really nervous around her. I was so in love with her that I wanted to marry her. I thought she was my soul mate and that we were meant to be together. She was the only thing I could think about. I kept daydreaming about her all day. The thing was I just couldn't ask her out. Every time i would try to ask her, I would freeze up and i tried to ask her out for 3 years. I tried everything and couldn't get the words out. I even bought her a ring for Valentine's Day but I was too scared to give it to her.      She just got a boyfriend and i'm just completely heartbroken. I feel completely devastated and sad. She's the only thing I can think about. I'm trying to get over her but I just can't stop thinking about her. It hurts so much. I know I have to get over her but I just can't. I can't even sleep anymore and its driving me crazy. i can't get over her. Everything I did was for her. I started MMA and going to the gym so I would look better for her. It's so agonizing when she kisses her boyfriend in front of me. She was the only part of my life that truly made me happy. She was so good at comforting me when I was down and I feel like I really need her now b/c i always feel sad. Seeing her was the only thing I actually looked forward to everyday. The only reason i wanted to go to school was so I could see her. It's just so hard to even be around her. I still have that strong urge to kiss her and I really have to restrain myself from doing it and its really hard to do. Whats even worse is that she sits next to me in math class and I have to see her everyday.      Every night when I go to bed, I always dream about kissing her or marrying her and then when I wake up I realize that it was just a dream and I feel even worse. She's the prettiest, smartest, sweetest, and most caring girl I've ever met. She's the girl of my dreams and I feel terrible all the time because I can't have her. I can't sleep and i haven't been doing as well at boxing. I feel like I can never love another girl the same way. I feel so empty and incomplete inside without her. I don't know what I did to deserve this torture. I just need some help getting over her. Can you help me out here?

20090304212225AAMXKjP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I get back with him? : Please answer seriously?	Okay, this may get kinda long, so I apologize before hand,      So I am in HS and this past fall I was dating this guy that was two years older than me and lived like 30 minutes away. We met through a Christian group for our churches over a year ago, and we found that we had a lot in common with each other, so we tended to talk to each other a lot. Almost every night, I was up to midnight talking to him.       So when I first went out with him, he was so sweet and would make sure I was okay and stuff and would fit his schedule around mine. This went on for maybe 2 months, then he had to go to a church conference in Arkansas for a weekend. When he was gone he would leave cute messages and we would talk over the phone.      Then when he got home, he told me up front that he kissed a girl at the conference and was so sorry about it. Then the break up snowed ball from there. The whole cheating on me made him think about going to college and how if he can't control himself now, then how can he be at college. I tried to calm him down but, we decided to break it off.      Then about 3 days later he called and we talk and just decided to be friends. I then found out that he started to date someone from his school, but the relationship didn't last a week. He then talked to me after it, and I told him that he should think about what he want. This pattern continues for the next 3 months. I have been his longest relationship so far (2 months).       Now, about 2 weeks ago we had to go to a church conference thing and when he dropped me off he grabbed my hand and kissed me. When he kissed me, I still felt that spark we used to have. After, he told me he missed me and that he wants to talk to me later.       Okay, so the real question is that, do i really want to get back together with him or do I just like the novelty of having a bf? LIke I said we broke up and never really got over it and i still have feeling for him.       When he said he missed me, I think he meant it, but I also have a feeling that he just saying that. I don't know if I should talk to him or just have him call me.       All of my friend say I should forget him, but I just can't. I know this sounds cheesy, but I see him everywhere and I just miss being around him and seeing him.       I just don't know what to do: HELP?

Recently my father has cheated on my mother and it has really affected me.. The other night I was sitting on his lap and saw a text message with the title "Blondie Bomb".. and he wouldn't open it in front of me.  We arn't even officially dating, but after that I got really uncomfortable and when he left I had like a mental break down and a panic attack for like 2 hours. I don't understand. He still calls me and everything but I just have this weird feeling in the pit of my stomach, what should I do?!

See she was spending the night and so was he and I fell asleep and when I woke up I saw them having sex.

Me and my bf dated for exactly 2 Years, 6 Months, 2 weeks. I keep a good count on that kind of stuff. And we have had so many GREAT memories together we used to cuddle in my living room and tickle each other. He would always kiss me the right way and say the perfect things. He was over EVERY single day after school and spend the night on every weekends. I'm so heartbroken I fell inlove with him I even almost got preg by him a few times.    Help how do I get over him.   By the way we've been broken up for 1 week now I have a new bf now but its not the same. And I might be preg with this new guys kid but I still love my ex HELP!!

20090304212423AAjrXAv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I don't understand (some) single mothers?	I have been having some experience with-and have seen many on yahoo answers, single mothers who seem to not want the father involved in their child's life. Of course this does not include cases of abuse, neglect, or drug addiction. But we're talking just a regular guy-regular woman, had a relationship (be there marriage or not, but usually a long term relationship as in, over 3 yr.) and split up for probably, pretty good reasons.       Then, after they have a child together, or the child is already there, the mother seems to do everything in her power to keep the child from the father. They give alot of pretty weak, see-through explanations for this such as: "he hasn't proved that he is capable of caring for the child" (when neither did they before giving birth, and no one asked them to) , he watches porn (really, what guy doesn't?), they don't like his friends or new girlfriend or new wife, and I'll be honest. I really don't get it.       It would seem to me that if being a single mother was SO hard you would welcome the help of the father who you obviously chose to have a child with in the first place...but since you broke up now he's not fit anymore. And they fight tooth and nail, and generallly think that they hold all the rights (not, actually the case)       It seems to me that if these mothers were forced to deal with a TRUE "deadbeat dad" situation (whereas the father wants nothing to do with the child) then they might feel LUCKY to have someone who is willing to fight them tooth and nail. This may come off more as a statement then the question...but once you get to a certain age shouldn't your maturity dictate that you are able and willing to get along with the father of your children for the sake of your children? In this day and age we all know how important it is for the children to have both parents in their life....so why wouldn't you want what's best for your child?          I guess I'm just looking for some insight or opinions into this matter, b/c like i said, it really makes no sense to me.       (and saying that all females are crazy *itches is not the answer im looking for either, i want some MATURE, adult, logical, HONEST repsonses to this one...)

I have 2 and he won't ever talk to them.  In turn, my girls don't talk to him either.  Its strange.  Otherwise he is fine around them.  Never abusive or mean.  I know this isn't normal, but would it be grounds to break up?  Our relationship is great otherwise.  I finally told him how I felt this last weekend and now he wont even talk to me.  He says that he needs time to "evaluate our relationship".  Any advice?

20090304220146AAUsY1d	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do with her?	I've dated her for 1.5 years, we share alot of interests but clash on some personality traits, she loves me and claims to want no one else and is planning on marrying me, but I could never see myself marrying her.      She is beautiful, fun, and loving but can be insensitive, immature, among other things...       I would like to end things now because she is a total temptation and when we're too close we...get too close and I'm tired of putting up with alot of her nonsense. She also lives with all guys, who are all my friends.       Problem is she would be heartbroken, could go off the deep end (back to substances and maybe other dudes), would most likely start to date people I know, I would lose the friendship, and it sucks being lonely.      What do I do?

20090304221730AAVwM4S	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is our sex life so... blah?	My husband and I have been married for one year.  I love him very much and he's everything I could ever ask for in a man.  The only problem is our sex life.  We average about once every two weeks.  We are both young.. in our mid-20's.  Sometimes the frequency of sex is often.. two or three times a week if I'm lucky (rare).  Then he hits a dry spell and we can go a couple weeks without sex.  During these dry spells, I notice he looks at porn.  I'll send him little hints that I'm feeling frisky (even hinting at giving him oral sex) but he usually blows me off.  It irritates me that he always manages to fit porn into his schedule, but not sex with his wife.  If I had it my way we would have sex at least twice a week.  I'm so confused, and don't understand why he's hot one week, then cold the next.      Please do not answer my question with "divorce him!"  There is no way I could ever leave him.. he is the love of my life.  All other aspects of our marriage are great.  I completely understand that sex isn't the most important part of a relationship, but it's definitely significant (our sack sessions are always fantastic... that's why I want more of it!!!)  I would appreciate any thoughts/suggestions on what could be going on.  Thanks.

20090304221816AAHjP4l	Family & Relationships;Friends	One of my best friends is always so depressed and sad. How can I help him? He used to be so happy all the time?	My friend always seems so depressed now. We are 15 and Ive known him since we were 11 years old. Hes been acting like this since the beginning of the school year. He still hangs out with us and everything but he just doesnt seem to be there mentally. Hes always listening to his ipod and whenever we try talking to him he just mumbles. When he does talk hes always complaining about life. Me and my friends just decided to listen to him to help. Its kinda sad to think that he was once the happy little 11 year old that I used to play and pull pranks with. His grades are also dropping. He used to get Bs now hes getting Cs and Ds.
20090304221956AAS4Z3t	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I "pleasure" her? How can I do it better?	I'm eighteen - my girlfriend's seventeen. While I'm not a virgin (and neither is she) we slept together, for the first time, after dating for about three weeks. I'm just wondering the norm, really - she was breathing heavy, groaning a little and letting out medium-loud moans (you know) every so often. Was I pleasuring her, or... is there more?      Not to get too graphic, but there was a point where was she moaning loudly, scratching my back, grinding against me and all. How can I get to the 'next level?' What else can I do for her? How can I "do" it better?

20090304222845AAqZCeb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Girlfriend broke up with me recently...?	Short story : She told me she needed a break 1 week ago.  So we didn't talk for 1 week until I asked her what the break meant.  Before it meant she needed to slow and chill down for a bit and we got good after that break.  This one is different and we broke up.  I chased her for 2 years and recently I got her to like me.  (4 months ago) She told me we can still be friends.  She already likes another guy, which is why she lost feeling for me i'm sure.        I chased her for 2 years and she once told me in those 2 years that we can only be friends.  I got passed that and we became more.  But now we're broken up and is seeing another guy.        I'm in love with her and still want to chase her now while giving her space.  I'll let her see the guy and everything hoping that hes too good to be true.  She only went on 2 dates with him and likes him already.  He likes her too.  I made the effort to chase her 2 years and finally got her to like me.        What I'm trying to say is, is that even though she likes another guy now, can I still get her back?  Since I chased her for 2 years and she once told me that she feels special because I never gave up on her for those 2 years even though she said we can only be friends then.        Does she still have feelings for me since I tried harder?     Is this new guy way too good that only took 2 days and got her to like him?      Read this :  http://www.keytogetexback.com/second_ste...       Now read where it says if I should totally ignore her.        Should I really give her that much "space" so she can not feel pressured by me?  Or is still okay to text her once in a while so we're not too distant?  She says we can still be friends, remember that.
