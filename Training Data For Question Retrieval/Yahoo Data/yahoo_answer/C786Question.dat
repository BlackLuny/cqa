20090304112223AAkjAok	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	How should I cook my quinoa for dinner tonight?	OK, so I finally found a local (well 40 minutes away local) grocery store that sold quinoa (and it was organic which was a plus). I have been wanting to try this for some time now. I do understand that even though this is packaged quinoa I still need to rinse it thoroughly to make sure I get the coating off (or I will get a bitter taste...so I've read). For dinner I am planning on making basic breaded tilapia for the main, and for the sides, a veggie (possibly zucchini), and the quinoa. What I'm wondering is if I am planning on just making this as a side (like plain rice), should I cook this in water or should it be cooked in a broth? I do have the use of a rice cooker but I wouldn't want to put a broth mix in there. I have heard that straight quinoa is pretty bland in flavor. If I were to use the rice cooker, what seasonings (add ins) would you recommend to liven the flavor of the quinoa?
