Good luck.|`|NNEn2sh3aa	Here are two low-cost volunteering options:     Volunteers For Peace   places volunteers in more than 3,000 projects, known as International Work Camps, in more than 100 countries, including some opportunities with U.S. programs. VFP specializes in short-term projects and maintains a low placement fee of $300.   http://www.vfp.org/index.html    World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms (WWOOF) strives to support sustainable ways of life by connecting volunteers with small farms in need of workers. Volunteers get food, accommodation, and an education in organic living at no cost, in exchange for working.   http://www.wwoof.org/    Best of luck!|`|45WBZkJRaa	Hope this is of some use    http://www.workingabroad.com/    I requested a brochure and the prices were reasonable. Although it says teaching abroad there are conservation parks etc that you can do voluntary work at. Good luck and have fun.
fwnqB0dTaa	NO    The same as we didn't die in 2000, 2007, or any other arbitrary date chosen by cranks & end of the world loonies.|`|qjvAquFnaa	well, people die every day.|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	It is interesting that the Mayans realized that the sun would align with the galaxie in winter equinox 2012.  There is nothing special about that portion of space.  There is nothing else special about that time.  They were good astronomers but thought it might have real meaning to our lives.  In fact the position of stars has very little to do with our day to day living.  Nothing unusual is going to happen that date.  It is merely a curiosity for astronomers and a testement to the Mayan observations.|`|vzDgu1xkaa	Listen, i know that it is a day that something will happen. it could be bibical or astronomical. the mayans predicted this day would have natural occurances that will wipe out mankind. the mayans were excellant astroomers. so i would say "if" we were to die in 2012 which i highly dont think so, it would be because of the lining of stars or maybe the blocking of the sun. global warming will not have much a part in 2012 since it has not grown to a high warning stage that we should worry about. but listen, if it is bibical, there is nothing we can do. i know that you are scared because you may not grow up to be an adult and experiance life. well all we can do now is hope.|`|9nD6cW2aaa	No that's impossible|`|JI3uGeiyaa	I made a whole page on 2012 prophesies     it was not only the Mayas ,but also the Egyptians ,Enki,Thoth,the Kogi ,the Hopi ,Toltecs,Nostradamus ,Terrance mcKenna ,the bible and a lot more i should imagine who all predicted drastic events for 2012   http://byderule.multiply.com/journal/ite...  there are over 150 links to supporting texts included.    The Mayas were on about the end of an era ,the age of Pisces and the birth of the age of Aquarius.not the end of the world   But there are supposed to be some giant cosmic storms on the way which could affect life on earth    There is however so much more going on with present accumulating environmental problems  http://byderule.multiply.com/journal/ite...    the biggest problem for Us is probably US.    It will do no good worrying about it except   do not add to the problems   (some solutions at the end of the page called Glimmer)    we are all in the same boat   if it ever happens we should have a big party|`|jQ0JpTPYaa	No these scientist dont know anything.God told us we dont know when he will make us all die.All that he told us is Angles will fall unto Earth like a thief in the night and destory the world.But we will never know when it may even be tonight.|`|O0RoOtmcaa	Scientists predict that in 2012 there will be the peak of solar activity and huge CMEs eill disturb power, communication and navigation systems, but we will not die.|`|dL0A7hMhaa	Nobody knows when the world will end. Maybe, maybe not. Don't listen to those Mayan doomsday predictions though.|`|z8WIAhDVaa	probably not. don't freak. they say that gravity is going to lift us up into space in December 2012, but the Mayan calendar  probably just ran out of ink.  Don't freak. Relax. They said that about 2000 too. but nothing happened, it's just a superstition. Chill, enjoy life|`|Aenp9qUEaa	It could happen. But, there is more chances that it won't, than it will, because the world's population is about 6 billion, and there is no way that this amount of people will be swiped out in 3 more years. But, it also could happen, because of the damage we are doing to our planet, and our planet might not be able to give anymore. For example, by us polluting our water, which means we're polluting our oceans, then we will swipe out all the food resources the ocean provides, and the water it produces. So, it might be possible, but 80% chance it will not happen. I like your concern, though.

C7CaNLGlaa	It's been cold and snowy in Michigan this year.  That's winter.  That's how it used to be in the 1970's.  It warmed up a little with little snow coming into the 1980's, then back to below zero cold and snow.  Again, we had a warmup in through the 1990''s through early 2000's then back to snow and cold.  Nothing wrong here, it's all cyclical.      All this and Al Gore isn't getting a penny from me.  I'll just enjoy breathing the FREE air and weather.|`|YJM6Ouujaa	The earth goes thru cycles regardless of what the scientists think. But scary stories get more money for them for studies.|`|UiXuoUaiaa	For Liberals global warming is whatever compliments their socialist agenda. Their goal is to establish greater control of the masses by taxing the very air we exhale.|`|JmSHwiEFaa	Right, global warming means its summer all the time, everywhere on the planet.  You got it buddy.  Congrats, you should publish this.|`|pZi3HXdnaa	Yeah, as long as the average global temperature for the month, the season or the year falls within the top fifty warmest on record, according to the GISS, it's global warming, no matter how severe your winters become.|`|fwnqB0dTaa	NO    Global warming means that the planet "AS A WHOLE" will get warmer, not that the "WHOLE PLANET" will get warmer.    Ice melt from the arctic ice sheets will desalinate, and cool, the North Atlantic, this will lead to the gulf stream moving south.    It's the gulf stream that stops the UK having the same climate as other places on the same latitude as we are .... Canada, Scandanavia etc.    Take this away and Scotland would become a skiers paradise, and the whole of the UK had better get used to snow & ice, and not get paralyzed by 3 or 4 inches of snow, as happened overnight.|`|0IuWhmWUaa	Why are people so stubborn about global warming.  We have one cold winter and everyone is like WTF happened to global warming.  Even though it has been a cold northern hemisphere winter.  The southern hemisphere, in particular Australia is pretty much having its hottest summer ever.  In western Sydney 122F, in Marble bar 107 CONSECUTIVE days of 100+, in Melbourne the Australian Open was restricted to indoor matches only.    To all the Pommys (English), it was only last week that YOU said Australia is too hot to host any sporting events, and 'good for nothing but the Kangaroo long jump' comes to mind.    Look outside your own backyard.|`|Fd0hvyoyaa	I think warming meant the antartic was getting warmer or something like that.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	It's winter.  It gets cold in the winter.  You're talking about local weather, not global climate.    On a *global* scale (it is called *global* warming, after all), the past 4 months have been in the top 7 warmest on record.  2008 as a whole was the 9th warmest year on record.  The first decade of the 21st century has been by far the hottest decade on record.    That is global warming.|`|AA11264399	One of the predicted consequences of global warming is more *extremes* of weather - including cold snaps.  In Australia, people are dying of heatstroke.  You have to look at the big picture.    http://www.ipcc.ch
159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	Your friend is absolutely right about at least some things.  There is no question that liberals are pushing this and there is billions of dollars at stake that hinge on global warming being a dire threat to the planet.  I think humans likely contribute a small amount that is more likely beneficial than harmful.  I lived in the 1970 and remember the global cooling scares well.  The historical record makes another ice age a no brainer minus a miracle.  Another ice age would be truly catastrophic.      The truth is nobody really knows what the climate will do or how much humans have contributed because humans have changed too many variables.  The models don't work.  The upper air hasn't warmed more than the surface so significant greenhouse warming is unlikely.  Don't listen to alarmists.  They think you will believe them more when they whine more shrilly.  There is a middle ground but that leaves the alarmists out of work because the crisis isn't really a crisis.|`|fwnqB0dTaa	He's wrong.    YES    We are in the part of earths natural cycle where it would be getting warmer.    BUT    The warming is at a much higher rate than can be explained by that cycle.    EDIT: Nice to see the, scientifically limited, deniers out in force.    While I work for a Meteorological body, renowned for its climate study and modelling, I am not a scientist (I work in IT) but even I can take in the evidence (not just from climatoligists, but also those studying geology, paleontology [there is a lot of useful info to be gained from the study of sedimentary rock, fossils, deep soil layers etc], botany etc) and understand that mankind has increased the global cycles by pollution.    I'm also not a green/environmentalist/tree hugger, we need power, and have to produce it at a price people can afford so all the green power arguments are currently impractical.    But we do need to look to the future and try to reduce the pollutants we are putting into the air.|`|yB3Jek85aa	wrong|`|EBi7Ci6taa	Your friend is right, global warming is a myth.  In the 1970's they were warning us we were headed for another ice age and in 20 years we would all freeze to death.  Al Gore is an idiot who doesn't really care about the environment, he just wants his 15 minutes of fame.|`|4d39e7dd6b413fbd46444cffe2149c0baa	Well, just do some research on the planet Venus and your friend would see that greenhouse gases do mess up the environment. You can ask your friend what's the hottest planet in the solar system for starters..|`|5wuOdAnvaa	He is right .|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	He is completely and totally 100% wrong.    1) "global warming is just a natural cycle"    Wrong.  Global warming *can be* part of a natural cycle, but natural cycles cannot account for the recent global warming.  Without anthropogenic (human) effects, the planet would be more than 0.5C cooler right now than it is:  http://www.pnas.org/content/104/10/3713/...    2) "He also pointed to the scare during the 1970's of Global Cooling claiming this was proof that Global Warming was just a fad."    In the 1970s the majority of climate scientists were predicting global warming.  A few predicted possible cooling based on scenarios which didn't come to pass, and a few media outlets ran stories about this.  However, scientists had it right then, and they have it right now.  See Myth  1: http://greenhome.huddler.com/wiki/global...    When somebody is making political arguments it's a red flag that they haven't researched the science behind global warming.  See the link below for a summary of how we know the current warming is due to humans.|`|a85bd4d28281b52b7bdecfc33cd65da3aa	Well, as ever with Global Warming: it depends.    It depends on exactly what you mean by Global Warming.    Global Warming can mean anything    From:    The world is warming slightly and mankind is adding somewhat to that rise, but the world has been much warmer than it is today in the past, and no catastrophe happened  in fact warmer times were generally times of plenty  so what have we got to worry about?    To:    The world is going to warm by more than it ever has before, mankind is the cause of all of that rise and its going to cause an absolute catastrophe, with mass extinctions, 20ft of sea level rise and the deaths of millions of people  to name but a few of the catastrophic effects.    So, which is true?     Well, obviously, the Global Warming Alarmists would like you to believe that the latter description is closer to the truth. They will tell you that scientists *know* exactly how the climate works and so we should listen to what they say before disaster strikes.     But the problem is: *do* the scientists know exactly how the climate works? They like to prove to us that they know what theyre talking about by giving us endless predictions of what global temperatures will do in the future. Sadly for them, its an inconvenient truth that, currently, all their models are wrong  global temperatures are, at present, below even the lowest of their predictions.     Also, if you look at the data for the last three decades youll find that in the most recent decade (96-06) CO2 rose 30% more than the average of the previous two, but at the same time, temperatures rose 40% *less* than the previous two. Furthermore, for the last eight years, the trend in temperature has been *downwards*. So, at a time when CO2 is rising faster than ever, temperatures are declining.    So, *do* the scientists know exactly how the climate works, do you think?    The simple truth is that Global Warming is just not the settled science that the Global Warming Alarmists would like you to believe it is. There are still plenty of questions unanswered and lots of problems with the data. And we havent even mentioned the corruption within climate science.    Given all of the above, I think your friend is justified to be sceptical of the scare-stories.     As ever with global warming - don't believe the hype.|`|P4vRH5Ufaa	Here the founder of the weather channel is quoted mocking Al Gores faulty allegations and fraudulent research. http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news... .    Here 500 scientists publish peer reviewed literature refuting global warming. http://www.wnd.com/news/article.asp?ARTI...    if you go to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ice_Ag...  you can see the past 450 thousand years of ice volume and temperature. It clearly shows a cycle of ups and downs and we are not as extreme now as we have been in the past.    Al Gore is a sore looser who is trying to use a scare tactic to frighten the American people into furthering his political agenda. He uses fraudulent research methods, and lies to the American public. It is immoral and I am appalled at how easily the world has fallen for this global warming crock. People just believe whatever they hear in the media and don't take the time to research it further on their own.    By the way if you go here you can read about how Al Gore's Mansion uses 20 times the energy of an average American home. http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/articl...    Hypocrite.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	He is right! People like Al Gore use it to make money!!!!|`|53VgQm9Caa	"He says that global warming is just a natural cycle."    Merely saying that something is "natural" doesn't explain what causes it.    "When I pointed to all the organizations who are fighting global warming he told me that they are only doing that because that's where the money is."    What your friend is saying amounts to: because climatologists often get paid to study climate, their opinion on the matter can't be trusted.    That's an interesting logic when you think about it.    Does he apply the same logic to in other areas? Or specially just to climatologists?       Oncologists are paid to find cancers. Does he therefore conclude cancer is a hoax?     "He also pointed to the scare during the 1970's of Global Cooling claiming this was proof that Global Warming was just a fad."     Ask him to specify anyone who said the world was cooling in the 1970s, and then get back to me. I can't find anyone, except for a few bored journalists.     Even if he can cite a scientist who said that, his argument basically boils down to:     "Some scientists were wrong in the 1970s, ergo other scientists must be wrong now!"    The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise, does it? It doesn't really beat examining the data for yourself.     "While I don't completely disagree I don't completely agree either. So, is my friend right or wrong."    Your friend is not thinking about the issue very clearly, or very well.    My suggestion to you is to question his logic, and the source of his information. It's a good habit. Perhaps you'll encourage him to do so as well.

xbgCwmbdaa	The best thing to do is apply a these rule of thumb to your everyday living.    1.Reduce  Reducing is first, because by reducing the things that we consume there is less waste in the first place. Small things are great and easy like using canvas bags instead of paper or plastic, stop using plastic bottles like bottled water and instead invest in a water filter at home - don't buy individually packaged things, etc. Using things like glass, wood or metal instead of plastic is another great thing to keep in mind.    2.REUSE  Reusing the things that we do have is a great way to extend the life of these items that would other wise be giving a very short lifespan and simply discarded after single use. Use spaghetti jars for grease, Reuse plastic juice containers to mix concentrated juice, etc. There are millions of ways to reuse the things we waste on a daily basis and a plethora of sites you can google for ideas.    3.Recycle  Recycle is last because it takes energy to recycle and is the last resort for waste. Yes, recycling is good - but the first two steps help  us reduce the energy it takes to recycle our goods. Only after you have done the first two steps should you then recycle something. Go to your city website and search for a local recycling facility. If your city does not have one - write a letter and express your want for one and encourage others to do the same.    There are many other ways to help like driving only when you need to and combining trips so you do everything in one day or trip or carpooling. Also using safe products on your lawn and in your home are not only great for the environment but much safer and better for YOU. If you google this issue you will find a massive amount of different ideas and suggestions.     From one responsible human being to another I just want to say thanks!|`|pnCOR1UVaa	Going green is easy, there are so many great resources about the subject. My personal favorite is "The Green Book" which has parts of its book online as well at www.readthegreenbook.com.    As I have been striving to "Go Green" I realize it is like stepping back in time without getting rid of my modern conveniences. I'm doing many things I learned as a child, like line drying my clothes, sweeping instead of vacuuming, opening the windows in the morning to catch the cool breeze, only buying what I need instead of everything that looks cool, growing some of my own food, and canning what I can't eat now.     To me "going Green" is a frame of mind. Do what fits your lifestyle and do the easy things first, it is a process and like dieting if you go to radical to soon, you are more likely to go back to bad habits. I also believe there are good, better, best choices in most things. If you aren't ready to start a home garden, then try finding a farmers market, until you locate one look for produce grown as close to home as possible and go organic when available.     Many people think "going green" is expensive, I disagree. Some changes may take an initial investment, but they usually have a short payoff time. Things like weatherstiping and insulation cost, but the energy savings will add up quickly. You may need to purchase reusable bags, but most stores give you a 5 or 10 cent credit, so you are paid back within a few months.     My top tips are make your home more energy efficient, that also means using natural light, cooling and heating.     Reduce your packaging, if you eat more fresh food you will generally reduce packaging, it's the same thing they tell dieters, shop the perimiter, that is where all the meat, dairy and produce are located. Only buy what you will use, many Americans throw away a lot of unused food. Buy in bulk, that doesn't just mean large packages, but that area with the bins that you buy only what you plan on using.     Replace disposable items with durable items, if you eat outside often and use disposable paper or plastic plates, it is a wise investment to purchase a set of reusable plastic plates. Replace disposable razors, diapers and cleaning products like swiffer. Avoid bottled water, get a home filter like Pur or Brita.    Recycle, www.earth911.org will help you locate the nearest recycle center. I try to only purchase plastics that are  1 or  2, they are more easily recycled. I also buy recycled products when available, that includes paper towels, napkings, toilet paper, tissue, school/office supplies and clothing.    Detox your cleaning, vinegar and baking soda clean almost anything, they can even losen a hair clog. Seventh Generation and Method are a couple mainstream brands that are very earth friendly.     Just start small and build from there, don't get overwhelmed.|`|MczmTftTaa	Try to walk to close places when you're running errands and use green friendly appliances.|`|AwEspXiiaa	Recycle and Drive a hybrid LOL  that's all I know of..|`|mHGvAc9kaa	recile    srry i can't spell|`|G1KBu0KQaa	Walk, take public transit, recycle, compost, use energy-efficient appliances, join a club or an organization, there are so many things you can do.     http://www.seql.org/100ways.cfm    This website has a few helpful tips.|`|1nt5jpZraa	Fly my jet to BWI, then back to my vacation home.

T7zdRWHgaa	That's the thing. We can't really compare all pros and cons. It's really dependant on you and your opinion. Personally, why can't you have both? It's true that a bike is way awesome, but what if you hae to buy a new toilet? Or a new T.V. wooooot!!! Keep the car, and buy a bike. Within a month or two, the cost of the bike will pay itself off from you saving gas. And if you ever need to go buy a toilet at the grocery store at night where it's forbidden to be smelly, you still have your car.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	i really think you should get both.    depending on where you live, public transit can't always be the answer. for example, i live in a town, near a big city. in my town, the bus comes every half hour, which is inconvenient, but then in the city, buses are every 10 minutes or better.      but it also depends if where you need to go is close. like, if its a 2 hours drive away, i don't think a bike is smart.    i think you should take public transit, but you should own a bike at the same time. so take public transit as your main mode of transit, but take the bike whenever possible!|`|uFQFRdczaa	Owning a car will cost a lot more than gas.  You have to pay for the car, plus maintain it.  If you're only averaging $15 a month on maintenance, you'll pay it later.    Really the deciding factor is how far you have to go.  If your grocery store is more than 2 miles away, keep a car.  You can carry a lot in backpacks, and you can get panniers for the bike--but if you're biking you'll have to go to the grocery store 2-3 times a week because you can't carry a full shopping trip's worth.  You won't want to do that, for a long trip.  Oh, you can carry groceries on the bus, but that sucks too.  How far is work?  3-4 miles is totally doable on a bike, 30 miles is not.    If you ride at night, have lights on your bike.  That is not so you can see, but so the cars can see you.  Not an option.      Are there times when you can't ride?  Sure.  Bikes are no fun when it's above 100 degrees, when it's below 35 degrees, when it's raining, when there's snow on the ground, or in the dark.  Can you keep your job if you get soaked on your ride in?      I say keep a car, but make it a cheap one.  Ride your bike when you can, and drive if it's too hot, too wet, or too cold.|`|73d140d83d29234efdfa2c38e0168b47aa	U might look for a more efficient car . Your health will not always be so good. The environment thing is the left being afraid U will use all the fuel and Gore will not be able to fly.|`|9ilXVowLaa	where do you live?  is there a subway?  do you pay to park your car?  of course you'll be cutting down on emissions,but is it practical/  i agree,do both.  put a basket on your bike and get a big canvas shopping bag for your shopping.|`|3blw5udRaa	you should get a bike. You will save money and get exercise.
aWTo9K22aa	It seems you're overreacting. Not to scare you more than you already are, but emissions from cars on the street, the chemicals that fill the air in your bedroom, the hundreds of preservatives and pesticides that go into your food--all of those, over your lifetime, will amount to more damage than a whiff of tobacco every now and then.     Even pack a day smokers only have like an 8% chance of getting lung cancer. Cigarettes increase your risk of health problems, that's it...they're not the evil, life sucking poison generators that certain people would have you believe.|`|503f82e81abb8901e8e1451d174089feaa	Yep! You are being paranoid over nothing.if you breathe at all you are breathing bad air at some time in your life.So get over it.|`|kK2mecABaa	I hate cigarettes, but I smoke a pack a day.  I understand that you dont feel like breathing smoke, its un healthy, but smelling it is altogether different. You wouldnt want to knock back a bottle of channel  9, but caching a wiff of it isnt going to kill you.  I hate people coming up to me bustin my stones for smoking outside a bar, or in a park.  It seems to me that they are looking for anything to be indignant about.  And that in reality Im only hurting myself.|`|yKGPbcx9aa	I hate cigarette smoke as well and try to stay away from smokers as much as possible. Maybe we're two over reactors, but I do not like staying  next to a smoking cigarette. It's a proven danger to our health and you should avoid inhaling toxic waste (car exhaust, cigarette smoke) as much as possible.
08f47edd63e0224660f6c3d00e0c5830aa	A Gallup pole of climate scientists belonging to the American Meteorological Society and the American Physical Union showed that 49% rejected anthropogenic warming  18% accepted it  33% said don't know    This is the real indication of the so called 'consensus' among scientists qualified to make an informed opinion.    The actual data shows that during the 20th century    Average global temperature rose 0.4C in the first decades  dropped 0.2C in the second decades, and rose 0.4C in the last decades. Giving a total of 0.6C rise for the whole century.  These figures are well within expected fluctuations.    There is a huge discrepancy between what scientists say and what politicians and journalists claim that scientists are saying.    Two headline issues will illustrate this fact.    Global warming will increase tropical storms.     Dr Landsea, a research meteorologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says that there has been no increase in the strength or frequency of hurricanes in the 20th century.    Antarctica is melting and will flood low lying areas where many poor third world people live.    Dr. Wingham, a physicist, head of department of Earth Sciences at University College London, director of polar modelling for the National Environmental Research Council, says that from the 72% of Antarctica that has been surveyed, the ice sheet is growing at the rate of 5mm per year +/- 1mm  and at this rate will LOWER seal levels by 0.08mm per year.    These two scientists are not deniers, they are very much mainstream establishment figures in the world of climate science. All they are saying is that in their specific areas of expertise, the claims of the alarmists are not supported by the science.|`|5wuOdAnvaa	Because they are idiots|`|9fbe56a44d7b6024062aa6bacbc528e4aa	I don't believe you, could you back up your claims with credible references so I can read up on these issues you are talking about.|`|aWTo9K22aa	Wow! Thank you for opening my eyes to those new and fresh ideas!|`|yuwjQjKqaa	I want to know the same thing!  I think it because of people like:  Nancy Pelosi  Al Gore  Ed Bagley|`|ZH5ZS9zXaa	Mabey because in history, man has almost never seen sever climate change, and are now seeing the change. Humans also need something to blame, so they are blaming themselves.|`|n6xqkPhXaa	Man made global warming is a ploy used by liberals and socialists to further their political aims.  There is no valid science involved, just what's termed 'junk science'.  All evidence supports those who believe it isn't happening.      People like Al Gore and Canada's David Suzuki are frauds and scam artists.  And you're right, they're making an awful lot of money at the expense of others.  Hopefully they'll be resting comfortably in cozy prison cells before long.|`|uFQFRdczaa	Disproved by the majority of scientists?  I hardly think so.|`|jS57s3Oeaa	Think about it. Action --> Effect. We are putting lots of stuff out there in the atmosphere...stuff that isn't just naturally there. It's having an effect.     Do you deny that there are glaciers up by Greenland that are melting? If you don't, then do you know about jet streams? Do you know what will happen when large quantities of cold water flow into warm ocean currents?|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	97% of scientists who are actively researching climate science agree that the planet is warming and humans are largely responsible.  http://news.mongabay.com/2009/0122-clima...    If you'd rather listen to economists, right-wing blogs, and politicians, go right ahead.  I'll take the scientific experts and the scientific evidence myself.|`|VNRJnNr2aa	Global warming is futuristic plan to overthrow humanity to becoming      slaves and have the right to destroy human life and making humans     robots .           there is no such thing as Global Warming and the Counter parts        that produce such claims do not understand atmopheric Gases      and their production         their plan is to blame humanity instead of understanding      and their opponents have technology that is far behind as well as they do so I dont see the common denominator
