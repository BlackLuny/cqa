Its funny because the week before my dad died he got delirium and he said stuff about-"had the world changed..was it a new world because it all seemed different" and then " had the second coming of christ happened". I realised then the book is decribing the process of slowly dying and the uncertainty and bravery you must muster to believe there is something more...the antichrist is doubting and terror at the unknown|`|ma7oJyuzaa	no|`|KRDwCai5aa	no. no he is not.|`|RkBlMyHRaa	I think you are correct,|`|NPtz1Y4Taa	could be lol havent seen anti christ recently lol|`|uF0guMdJaa	Try reading the book of Revelations to learn about the anti-christ to form your own opinions,|`|stRWElvPaa	that's scary. i really hope it's not true. interesting question.

Nostradamus said Mabus would bring terror and the dark one furious with rage will make them repent    obaMA BUSh    Bush started the war on Terror  is Obama the dark one furious with rage?|`|UNw3L5qfaa	Nostradamus also said the world would end on december 31st 1999.    To my knowledge the world is still here.    Remember that there are a lot more of his predictions that didn't land than those who did.    "Psychics" use a similar way of convincing people they are psychic. They start from a very vague point which could mean anything, but people interpret it in their own way.    And Anti-christ? Reeeally?|`|JQarjZBDaa	i wouldn't say that but i don't like him everybody voted for him because he said "change" well he sure is changing now!  he signed a check for gay marriages legal and churches can't turn away gay ppl IT SUCKS!!!! but it has to go through office first thankfully

DgLBtjWoaa	This isn't a top 10 list- instead it's a top 6 or 7:    Some Good Undergraduate Programs   What to look for: Do the professors have professional journalism experience? Can students take classes in photojournalism, TV, audio and online media as well as reporting and writing? What opportunities do students have to practice their skills? Does the school operate a TV studio? Is there a daily student newspaper?  -Ball State University   Programs in journalism graphics, magazine, news-editorial, photojournalism.  -Indiana University - Bloomington   One journalism program, with advanced courses in newspaper, magazine, broadcast news, photojournalism, editing, and news analysis and opinion writing.  -University of Florida   Programs in reporting, editing, magazine, online, photojournalism, broadcast news.

Some Good Graduate Programs   These universities offer a master's degree that is focused on the professional practice of journalism. Some of them ALSO have a research-focused program. You want to understand this distinction and make sure the school you choose offers the courses that you hope to take.  -Columbia University   One year, full-time; two to three years, part-time; Master of Science.  -Northwestern University   A 12-month full-time program; Master of Science in Journalism.  -Syracuse University   Various master's programs are offered, including new media (one year) and broadcast journalism (40 credits).

fdpKVScvaa	It is interesting that you mention charities. I've become very dubious about the way some of them behave. I was on a train in London once & I overheard a 'charity worker' boasting about how much money he was making. He said that he got to keep 10 percent of all the donations that he collected. He was such an arrogant SOB.     I still donate to charities but I'm very choosey about how I do it because there's no doubt that some of them lost whatever was 'charitable' about them a long time ago. It's such an easy sell because people always feel good about donating & sadly some people are taking advantage of that. But they are important, you just have to be careful about who you support and how you do it.    As for CEO's, well. Legends in their own minds.|`|dGiYVfw6aa	I say let them suffer the consequences of bad management and outright cheating.|`|AA10047588	Any time government hurries to hand out money, there are always people willing to spend it.

Take for instance our beloved congress who wants to debate on when we are leaving.  All Al Queda has to do is sit tight and hunker down because we will leave in a few years.  They want to leave my brothers over there hanging.  <br>  Bush did the right thing about troop increase, (having been there twice) he has also taken the shackles off and let them do what they are trained to do.  The only way the Democrats can get there way is if Bush fails, and looks like Bush is winning.<br>  Unfortunately dieing is a part of war.  Gulf war 1 we lost maybe a 100 soldiers in a 2 week operation (half friendly fire 1/4 accidents).

I've always thought about my future, and I want to give my children what I couldn't have.    Starting with a good marriage, I also want them to be able to study abroad (and I need money for that), to learn to play all kinds of musical instruments, to be great athletes and to know at least 5 languages.    The wealth I want will be more like an investment. I want my kids to be happy and to have great job opportunities in their future.|`|DQeUKMbPaa	yeah i agree. i haven't lost anything like you have, but i have came from nothing. i just started laying roots. then a foundation, then walls, the a roof. and so on, and you could one day be were you want to be financially. i was raised in california and had to live with all the people who are like that. even dating all the people are shallow. i moved to arkansas, i also had heart failure a year ago. my dad divorced and is still going through a mid-life crisis. so he hasn't been there for me. but I have a boyfriend and his family. They all have helped me out and guided me and gave me all the love and help my dad should have gave me. and not i'm in school almost finished.     so you see. all you need is family and fiends. that's all that matters. and from that, you can build yourself up, or back up in your case. just uprate every moment and everything, because at any moment you could go. i like to lie my life making sure every moment is perfect enough that if i went just now, i would be happy and content no regrets. I'd  like to be not rich, but at least happy.  but if i can make enough to be considered rich, then so be it. but god knows i wont be ungrateful.
C1y4sOfFaa	If the woman was rich, she wouldn't be asking for donations. For the family to remain anonymous, they obviously didn't want to be hounded by the media. The family obviously want their privacy respected.|`|jd14u32qaa	If she was rich I don't think people would care as much.

You'd have to be rich to properly take care of 14 kids, the average cost of raising a child from birth until they're 18 is 1 million dollars. There is a very good chance she's on medicare or medical, more government handouts payed for by taxpayers.    I, honestly, wonder how much resources families that big consume over a long period of time.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	She is not a stable woman. I blame the screwed up doctors and if she is on welfare, they should have to support these children, not the state.    Don't kid yourself.

I feel bad for all these sweet children.|`|IFnyC2naaa	We were talking about it in World Geo. This kid brought it up.

I heard the media is trying to stalk her, I don't get how they do that? She just had kids. BIG WHOOP! I think what she wants is to have her own T.V. show like "18 Kids and Counting" or "Jon and Kate, Plus 8" that's on TLC.
jZ03Zdjdaa	They were all singles except for the 2 year-old twins.  Maybe she was frustrated with poppin' em out only one- or two- and a time, and wanted to quickly get up to 13- or 14?    The grandmother says the mother wanted a fertility treatment just to have one more.  But you're right, something doesn't add up.  And when a single, bankrupt mom has 6 kids, why so much money and desparation to have more?|`|LWzrCu5caa	If she had six kids she had no problem with fertility.   I would say the doctor committed malpractice.     Was he being paid a lot of money?    Was he hoping for a chance to be famous by generating so many kids?    If anything,  this should result in the development of some standards of conduct for these jokers.    Making a joke of reproduction and parenthood.|`|YW6cDP96aa	Because as you get older your body gets less fertile, she may have not had a problem conceiving the other children but then was having trouble this time around or maybe she is hoping for multiples? shes the only one with the true answer but those are my guesses|`|IFnyC2naaa	We were talking about it in World Geo.

Get off your liberal high horse and join the human race.|`|IVjspiStaa	Yes!!! you are right, never a single complaint against President Bush in eight years, the liberals always gave President Bush the benefit  of the doubt on many issues, thank you for pointing it out.
w8owmaDGaa	My wife and I paid our mortgage off 5 years ago.    We did that by first saving until we had 20% to put down.  ("Saving" means doing without all the toys and playthings people love to buy on credit  ...because they can't afford them!)    We kept our jobs and went to work everyday and kept "saving" and doing without the toys until our mortgage was paid off.  We were brought up to believe that paying off your debt was the right thing to do... obviously something no longer in vogue.    Now I gotta ask  ...   Is the government going to pay us back what we paid for our mortgage?    Or is it just going to pay off the mortgages of the people too stupid or too lazy to do it on their own?    And is it going to pay the greedy, inflated "unreal-estate" price of the mortgage, or the real value of the home?|`|tguEmxVyaa	HELLO!!!

AA10153220	I'm in college right now, but I was the editor-in-chief of my high school paper a few years ago.    I went to a fairly poor, overcrowded public school, so we didn't have many resources, but we did the best with what we had.    Our paper was also completely ad-funded.  We used InDesign, and also Photoshop.    We printed issues ranging from 4-12 pages once a month.  They were usually black and white, but our final issue had color.  I don't remember the number of copies, but it was somewhere in the 1000-2000 range.    Our staff was in the low to mid teens, so maybe 13 or 14 people?

Lbulud8raa	1. Can the U.S. invade China in the first place?    No, because it would be a known thing in China long before troops are landed:  an invasion would need to come from several fronts to be effective as well, and the US does not have those kinds of resources.    2. Are America's technological and firepower advantages helpful in the long run against 1 billion people?    No, they did not work in Viet Nam, and they are overall a failure in Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq.  "Shock and Awe" tactics (that ghastly GWB euphemism, now a bad joke) won't work in a nation with greater landmass than the contiguous United States but almost five times the population.  They know the lay of the land and Guerrilla tactics will serve them and not the US.  Additionally, other nations could well support China, including Russia.  China could go on killing Americans forever, until there is nobody left to call the US home.    3. How effective would U.S. airpower be?    Limited.  There are only around 70 B-52's still flying, and the total number of bombers is not nearly enough for all the targets to be hit effectively.  Other aircraft rely on ground support: fuel bases, runways and so on.  Getting a sufficient bridgehead to allow this would be nigh on impossible, and air-air re-fuelling is expensive, risky and these tankers are sitting ducks for Chinese fighters.    4. Is it safe to say every Chinese citizen would fight?    Close enough: China's government and military wield ability to force those who don't want to fight to fight., but consider: if your homeland was invaded, you would want to do whatever you could to defend it, even if your fondness for your government was not great.  A difficult ruler is still almost always better than a "friendly" invader.  Plus, given the histories of many fighting forces, including US Marines and others, they would enter the fray with the view of "killing gooks" and taking trophies.  Racism would play a big role, and this would be used to spur on the Chinese citizenry to fight back, and honestly, by whatever means they could.  Who could blame them?    5. Can the U.S. hold up against a modern military supported by guerrilla warfare?    Hell no!  China is not some backward nation anymore.  they have access to modern weapons, thier tactical knowledge is sound, and they have a cultural imperative to not have their homeland ruled or dictated to by others ever again.  No American justification could make such a struggle acceptable.  The US will bear far greater costs in fielding it's weapons and troops.  Molare at home will also play a role: body bags, people protesting the war, heightened jingoism and vicious patriotism... all will conspire to defeat the US.  Modern warfare involves more than hardware, it is fought in the media, in public opinion, by fifth columns and sympathisers, spies and saboteurs.  This would be a messy conflict.    6. Any other thoughts?    Nuclear weapons.  The weapons of last report could well be used to hasten an end to this war.  No country, in it's right mind, would support such militarism on behalf of the US, whatever the justification.    Playing dirty:  China would have no compunction about torturing and mutilating captured soldiers and corpses, or using chem.biological weapons.  If you think this is bad, then consider it is no worse than the US would do or would have done by invading in the first place.  The US would have no moral high ground.    Lessons unlearned.  The US has never defeated a guerilla based force.  Korea, Viet Nam, Laos, Afganhistan, Iraq and even some battles in WW2 all pont to weaknesses in US military fighting styles.      LAST WORD:    China can eventually defeat the US on economic grounds, the way it is going.|`|8675917d6f324c2c4ef2494e8a53406faa	The answer...is its not going to happen. China does not have the resources we need. Nor would attacking China help the economy.    1. Yes.  2. Yes.  3. Very  4. No...would every American?  5. Yes  6. We'd win, but it would be utterly useless and many many people would die.|`|eu6UQElYaa	1. The US COULD invade China just like China COULD invade the US.  I mean there are a lot of logistics stopping that from happening right now but if you ignored those logistics then really any country can invade any other country.   2. Considering the fact that China could easily completely cripple our economy and they are making a lot of headway in their own technological and firepower, it would be a difficult for us to take them on.  3. Airpower would be the most effective weapon we would have probably.  4. No  5. It would not be an easy win if we could pull it off at all.  6. Nope.|`|sS5abD8Vaa	4...no|`|orfmhb2waa	1 yes we could  2  america has no tech advantage over china  3 america would lose some planes to chinese ground to air missiles  4 no some chinese are babies and some are old and some are just noncombative  5 i doubt it  6 fighting china would be the dumbest thing the USA has ever done|`|nnO24Xs7aa	1.

It started with the Bush Regime.  In fact truth be told it started 30yrs ago, with the first imports and trade inequality of foreign cars.  I hope you grasp that when a country makes no goods, it has nothing to sell, if you have nothing to offer you have no jobs. We were once the wealthiest nation because of manufacturing, it created 4-5additional jobs, sorry to say we have lost Millions of manufacturing jobs in the past 8yrs. The first 300million took place when Bush came in and opened the purse to business to leave this nation and take its tax dollars and jobs with it. Please checkout ...www.LouDobbs.com and really have a good look at the many aspects of his web site. I realize when you are young it is harder to understand all the impact and various ways of government and operation of business and the truths in it as well as the stock market, and banking institutions and realizing what is said and done are tow different hings and the impact on people. BUsiness has had the go ahead to steal and cheat its workers for their high profits at any cost and govt has let them, They have totally sold us out!    If we do not get business to open up here and start giving some of the advantages to business that we have to get rid of them or invite and pay foreign business then we should probably get a gun and kill ourselves before our neighbors do it for us. The country is about to go into a worse mess then most people have ever seen. No joke.  If you  have some idea of how Obama is running us into the ground, please give details. Honestly on my life, I m not kidding here, our economy has been being propped up by govt and the trouble is worse then many realize. We are trillions of dollars in debt to a communist nation, for starters, and they would love to see us be under there thumb.

(Basically, just because your neighborhood comes up "safe" doesn't mean you shouldn't be careful...)    Anyway, the site is   http://www.familywatchdog.us/    It also shows any Amber Alerts that might be going on, and while you can choose to make a donation to the site, it is free.    Not every State in the Union has a sex offender registry, but almost all of them do, and this site covers every State that does.  Plus, it's very good about letting you know how real the risk is by a color code system and a very good explanation of terms and definitions of offenses for your State.  (like, for me, I would be much more concerned about a 40 yr old arrested for exposing himself in the park to kids than, say, an 18 yr old who was arrested for rape because he was caught having sex with his 17 yr old girlfriend).
