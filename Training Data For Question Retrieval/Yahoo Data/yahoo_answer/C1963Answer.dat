bo54Lw59aa	If he already has an SLR and some lenses, you may want to stick with the same brand as the lenses should work with the digital SLR, too.  On some of the brands, at least.  Pentax, for example, hasn't changed their mount since sometime in the 1960s.|`|ZEwAalKPaa	My recommendation is different from those submitted so far.<br>  DON'T !<br>  <br>  As you specify a digital SLR rather than just a digital camera it is probably safe to assume that your father already has an interest in photography, possibly going back many years.  Unlike new comers, people who have been into cameras for a number of years tend to have built in preferences - you know, you get Nikon men, Canon men, Olympus men etc (or women of course) and if you buy a Canon for a Nikon man he may be less appreciative than he will let on.<br>  <br>  Why not give him a budget and ask him to choose what HE would like most within that.<br>  <br>  When you ask for recommendations here people naturally recommend what they are familiar with themselves and by the time you have read all the various choices you will be more confused than when you started.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	I would recommend Nikon D90.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26rs%3D%26ref%255F%3Dsr%255Fnr%255Fi%255F0%26keywords%3Dnikon%2520d90%26qid%3D1235395726%26rh%3Di%253Aaps%252Ck%253Anikon%2520d90%252Ci%253Aelectronics&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a><br>  but if you are one budget Nikon D40 is excellent camera with affordable price.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KJQ1DG?ie=UTF8&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000KJQ1DG" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KJQ...</a>|`|AQ4b4Iilaa	Sony A200, it's the best you can get at that price, more features than the Nikon D40 and a better kit lens.<br>  <br>  Go and buy cheap 20 year old Minolta AF lenses off eBay for the Sony, they have the same mount, Sony bought Minolta and the lenses are excellent.<br>  <br>  If you bought old Nikon lenses for the D40, you'd be stuck with manual focus because the D40 doesn't have an auto-focus motor in the camera body!  Unbelievable, but true :)<br>  <br>  Buying a Nikon D40 over a Sony A200 makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.|`|pC2jGRKraa	Or you could go for a used prosumer level camera. Something like a EOS 30D, about ï¿¡300 body only, but is considerably better than any of the entry level cameras. I can't really recommend lenses if I don't know what he want's the camera for, but generally if you go buy an older used lens without USM, they tend to give you better quality.|`|jw72N1moaa	Canon 450D, I have it and it's great. Go for Canon, they are the best|`|AA12191047	what? "Nikon Affordable"?  Well I guess anything could be considered affordable depending on how much money you have. But the reality is actually this. When you are talking about consumer SLR cameras there is Nikon, Sony, Canon, Pentax, Panasonic, &Olympus. And they go in that same order from Highest to lowest price. And all the base models are comparable in performance & picture quality. I have used all except the Sony and have a good friend for the source. It depends on the user if they are a photographer and have a brand preference. If your Father never had a DSLR before i would suggest the Olympus 4/3 camera which would be any of the new Olympus E- whatever SLR cameras. An E-420 would be good, plus in-body image stabilization.  And if your Father use to be an amateur photographer and still has a film SLR with lots of lenses i would especially recommend an Olympus, because with an adapter he could use all the old lenses. Only the Panasonic and Olympus 4/3 cameras let you use old lenses from any camera with original quality via adapters. Also the Olympus cameras go for about 300 to 400 less than the Nikon and only Olympus and Pentax has in-body image stabilization. Other camera brands put it in the lens, so you can either buy the regular lenses or if you want in-body image stabilization you have to pay more per lens|`|FdssEauAaa	Another vote for the Nikon D40, as I have one.  Actually I would consider one of its more recent replacements, like the D60 as it has become even more friendly and its standard lens has VR (vibration reduction, also known as optical image stabilisation, great for hand-held shots in low light such as indoors).<br>  <br>  At any rate, the good thing about the Nikon DSLRs is that even the really cheap ones have good optics, so you can be sure the lens characteristics are decent for the price.  Note that I said for the price :)<br>  <br>  It also means that the body will be compatible with any Nixon DX lenses of which there is a decent range, including many professional ones.|`|agRLoU9naa	Nikon D40 is the entry level, and it is a great camera, with easier to use buttons and amazing picture quality! The battery is very good. Not expensive|`|X95I8ZfXaa	Before you buy go to channel 5 website. The gadget show? Just google the gadget show and there is a video on there about the best cameras just have a look see what you think? It was on channel 5 the other night... Hope this helps!|`|tKTE2xxpaa	nikon d40 is nice and affordable
BhNP2P8Xaa	Well, whoever told you that the "Android feature" is the only good thing about the G1 is an idiot, since Android is the operating system on which the phone works. I'm not going to try to compare the G1 to that other phone because i never used the other phone. But I've had my G1 since October, and I love it. <br>  <br>  The key is figuring out what you want the phone to do for you, then see if one or the other can do it. You want Internet, 3G, wi-fi capability, GPS, integration with Google mail, contacts, calendar and maps, touch screen, full keyboard, SD card storage, music player, 3MP camera, bunches of apps (many free), text, MMS, Youtube, ect. etc.?<br>  <br>  Then get the G1.|`|T6g8O3VNaa	the G1 is U.G.L.Y I would choose the lg over the G1 any day

You can try this:<br>  <br>  Look for the "utilities" (this could be under your tools) -> device mgr -> option -> check for updates - > connect to internet -> YES<br>  <br>  This will check for software update directly, no need to pass through your computer.  <br>  <br>  Caveat, when updating always make sure you are on FULL battery to avoid battery empty during update that will cause major damage to your phone, better yet update your N95 while connected to your charger/electricity.

VJ1C5JsYaa	As far as I am aware you can not record game-play footage directly to your phone from your system no matter what type of cables you use. People normally will use a computer and a capture card in order to record game-play on to their computers from there you would be able to transfer the video to your phone. The phone does not have the correct software to be able to plug the phone into the 360 and record it. I mean if you want to get low tech you could just point the camera at the screen and take a video of it.... however I am sure that's not what you had meant. The information you might have gotten from your phone as I can see it says that you can watch videos on your xbox from your phone it says nothing about being able to record. To be able to watch videos from your phone on your 360 you would simply need your phones USB cable.

z4OYI251aa	well you need to look at the base station of the headphones....they'll come with cables. if one of the cables looks like the earphone plug (3.5mm) your in luck!. personally i like bluetooth headphones but you have to plug in a massive bluetooth reciever but i still love them. best are logitech headphones on ebay only like $60 and so darn loud ow!
tyRNuhJkaa	you can get a lens cleaning disk from any gaming shop, music shops sometimes sell them or retail shops (like Tesco) <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Skytronic-DVD-lens-cleaner/dp/B000NVU88A/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1235387403&sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Skytronic-DVD-le...</a> heres one for ï¿¡6.10(ï¿¡2.86 used), you might be able to get cheaper if you have a good look<br>  <br>  from the inside out in a straight motion with a soft cloth like a  glasses cleaning cloth, if unclear you game box should have instructions for disk cleaning at the back of the book. or you could get CD disk cleaner put a bit of fluid on the disk put it in the cleaner then turn the handle.<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Skytronic-DVD-lens-cleaner/dp/B000NVU88A/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1235387403&sr=8-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Skytronic-DVD-le...</a> ï¿¡7.00<br>  <br>  or you could get the lens cleaner and the disk cleaner together for ï¿¡10.04<br>  <br>  you should also clean out your air events on the side of you consoles to remove dust as this can cause overheating a hover will do the trick here.

VJ1C5JsYaa	No. You can not switch your gamerscore from your old profile to your new profile. You will have to either continue to use your old profile or you will have to re earn you gamerscore. There is no way around that.|`|1b85748ff0626abc0819d93f878ad293aa	No you can't. If you were wanting to switch your gamertag you could have just paid the $10 and kept all your old stuff.|`|cxiMDaBHaa	i wouldnt of thought so as the gamescore and achievements are saved to that profile. I mean if you could do this i image youd get loads of people sharing gamerscore. Then again Microsoft may have made a way of doing so but if it did it would most likely destroy your old account. I think to be safe youd better ask someone on the xbox forums.
nP1SZuUlaa	well, if you don't already have it, there's Resident Evil 4: Wii Edition.  It's my favorite Wii game, great replayability, pretty intense story...<br>  <br>  Other than that, you could get Dead Rising: CTYD, comes out tomorrow.  Same storyline as the 360 version with the RE4:Wii engine.  I think it's going to be a very good game.<br>  Madworld doesn't seem scary, but it looks really gory.  I think it'll be worth buying.  It comes out in early March.  The 9th maybe.<br>  Uhhh.. Obscure: The Aftermath.  I can't tell you anything about this game.  just that it exists, belongs to the survival-horror genre, and got mixed reviews.<br>  Dead Space is coming to the Wii eventually.  Not much news on it just yet.<br>  That's about all I know of.<br>  <br>  However, I'm obligated to plug this game because it needs attention.<br>  Read a few things about The Conduit if you haven't heard of it.  It's an FPS exclusive to the Wii, with a game engine built specifically for it.<br>  I think it's going to be a defining game for the Wii.|`|tsq5P9pzaa	Well if you haven't played Resident Evil 4 then I'd say give that a try. Kind of an old game but it was re-made for Wii. It's an amazing game and scary too.

XcF4L6KMaa	Its the phone, not the carrier. Verizon has nothing to do with how loud the phones ringers or alerts are. So I think your issue is with Motorola, not verizon.

X9XbaBNkaa	You would need a waveditor - they allow editing of mp3 tracks aswell.<br>  Then ou can increase the loudness from that - it will also allow the removal of distortions. There are a few free ones available. <br>  <br>  example<br>  <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</a>|`|MRZnKFu4aa	You could google for 'MP3gain' which is a free download...found it works very well in cases of mp3's being too loud or too quite
hD4ZroEmaa	Typically no.  If you dialed the number in the above example the central office would think you are dialing a long distance number to the 234 area code ( In Ohio ) and the local number is 568-118?. It would be waiting on one more number to complete the series.  <br>  <br>  There are circumstances where you could dial 1911 and it would probably go through.  Also, if you held the number 9 down long enough on a phone, some of them will interpret this as a call for help and dial 911.  Most cell phones are designed to do this.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|GAoaSPGkaa	This is more of a suggestion, but why don't you just try and find out. (You should probably be ready to apologize quickly if you end up getting 911 though.)|`|4ac1d65fbeeae2dc584df9ab9b6abecbaa	No, dialing that number would not dial 911.  911 has to be the first 3 numbers you press.|`|1ikxwGYLaa	Certainly in the UK, dialing other numbers before the emergency number does NOT count, and I'd imagine it to be the same throughout the world.<br>  <br>  It's perfectly feasible to have '911' in a phone number as per your suggestion - in fact, remembering the UK's emergency number is 999, I have a VoIP line in the UK which ends in 999.<br>  <br>  And again, based on knowledge of the UK, *deliberately* making non-emergency calls to the emergency numbers is an offence - you can, and WILL be tracked, even if you with-hold your number.  Accidental dialing is tolerated (eg. if a young child gets hold of your phone)
owGsQdYraa	Reset it - Hold the middle button and the top button until it resets.|`|bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	just reset it<br>  press menu and the center buttons at the same time until the apple appears
nYgUfUd7aa	A 16 GB version would be plenty of room for you.  It is an excellent phone, ipod, application and internet device.  There are big expenses involved, but not any more than other smart phones (AT&T charges the same $30 a month for unlimited data to all phones classified as smart phones).  If you could hold out until June, there might be a new version announced by Apple...|`|sZ5PMfWCaa	1024MB = 1GB<br>  <br>  I have the iPhone 16GB and i love it.<br>  <br>  Awesome phone.<br>  I would recommend it; you may struggle to fit everything on, but then you'll just have to cut down on the tv shows :P<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|II2EKZ6haa	nope.go for the touch.@nd buy @nother phone like k850 th@t would do the trick.|`|15it6Zyqaa	for my iPhone 3g it is a 8GB I Think 8GB is enough But Then 16GB Is Way Too Much.

ad2faoKcaa	The original fatty PS2 had a 40GB HDD add on ! Not sure if they still make them though !<br>  <br>  HD Loader was an unofficial software program that allowed entire PS2 games to be copied to the PS2 HDD ! Sony never supported HD Loader because of piracy issues !<br>  <br>  The software also allowed you to use some standard HDDs in the PS2, however they will not be seen in the browser, or work with games using the HDD. While some argue that this improves performance and protects the potentially fragile discs, especially from young children, others claim that this only encourages piracy as rented games can be copied and kept forever.|`|GUVl3KiYaa	yes. look up the HD loader at some point. I'll expect a thank you later.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	The fat model could support a 40GB HDD, which is really only for installing games so that the load times would be faster. <br>  <br>  You can't put music, pictures, videos, etc on it.

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hi. I will evaluate your system, but you haven't given me much information. <br>  <br>  * The NVIDIA GEFORCE 7400 isn't a top quality video card by any means. The model is slowly becoming obsolete, but it still play titles like Far Cry 2, Dead Space, etc on minimum. However, we must remember that Empire: Total War is a very demanding game, that requires much higher standards in comparison to others. (Medieval II: Total War was critisized for the excessive graphical power it needed). Basically, you need to upgrade this component. I recommend at least an ATI RADEON HD 3200 or NVIDIA GEFORCE 8600 GT for optimal play. They should have no trouble with future titles for some time.<br>  <br>  * 2 GB of physical memory (RAM) is fine for gaming, and shouldn't give you much trouble at all. If you still want to improve, install another Gig or two.<br>  <br>  * You didn't provide any information about the type of processor you have or CPU chip speeds (I need this information it's important). Regardless, Intel 1.82 GHz is very slow. If it's AMD it will calculate twice as fast.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  I don't know how much of what I just said you understood, but the bottom line is that your PC will not play Empire: Total War. I used to have a 7600 GT, and I replaced it recently. Your main issue is the graphics card - get a new one, and you'll be okay. I still wouldn't expect even medium settings though (you haven't supplied enough details for me to make that classification accurately).|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Don't think so.<br>  <br>  Your processor might be good enough, depending on whether it's a dual core or not. (If it's a single core Pentium 4 or Celeron, no it isn't good enough.)<br>  <br>  However, you need at least a 256MB DirectX 9.0c compatible video card supporting shader model 2.0 to run the game. I'm not sure how much memory your 7400 has, but I think it only supports a maximum of 128MB of video memory.

And contrary to other opinion expressed here, they cannot get a copy of your texts without getting a court order, and few parents will go to that sort of trouble and expense.<br>  <br>  What is becoming a real risk nowadays are companies who provide modifications to phones so that every call you make is echoed to another nominated phone, as is every text you send.

You may not have stopped a movie at the end the last time you watched on demand. Your best bet is to unplug your box for 10-30 seconds and wait for the time to come back on. Once that does try it again, if it still doesn't work I would call because you may have an old splitter or a bad line.
7lmfkZgfaa	I chose xbox 360 because I was familiar with the original. But then most of my friends were buying 360s, and most could afford them. I have nothing against the PS3 whatsoever. I even plan on owning one someday due to the fact that it would give me more choices on games, expand my gaming experience and gaming views. Although I don't see the use for Blu-ray due to the fact that I have a pretty good tv but nothing special. 360, in the beginning, had a lot more to offer and PS3 was just too expensive at the time. but now, I see it to be at a reasonable price. I have a feeling that the year or '09 may be a good year for the PS3, just a feeling lol. <br>  <br>  I'm very open minded with video gaming and what not, so i'm usually not quick to hate. anyways I got the 360 for friends, the choice of games, and experience with the original.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, and the online play with friends and others, definitely!|`|qtlzdtMVaa	Oh my god...The xbox does not compare to the PS3. I have both and the amount of times my xbox has broken, oh dear lord I wanted to smash it. The ps3 looks good, is reliable and the graphics are outstanding! The only advantage about the xbox is that you can listen to music while playing games...thats it! Plus you have to pay to go online!!! The best game on the xbox is Gears of War - that's the only reason I got it, waste of money overall in my opinion.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is I did NOT choose the xbox over the ps3.<br>  <br>  This question is so gonna start an argument.|`|W5E8GhiBaa	I have both myself band I like the 360 for gaming way better. I just use my ps3 for DVD's and Blu Ray anymore, unless a cool game comes out that's only for it. The installation and updating times is what did it in for me. Nothing makes me mad than bringing home a game for the first time and sometimes having to wait uptil an HOUR or 2 to play the thing.|`|WR5ItbuIaa	TO me, the reason i chose the xbox 360 was price.  I was able to buy my system, an extra controller, 2 games, and xbox live, plus some more, for the cost of a PS3.  <br>  And, 360 offered Halo 3, which is the main reason i wanted an xbox|`|Zd8C6KSCaa	Why did I get a Xbox 360? Well lets see. <br>  <br>  1) cheaper <br>  2) more/better games <br>  3) better online play <br>  4) the first xbox was grate so i bought the 360 <br>  5) Xbox holds up to 4 players as the PS3 only holds 2|`|hnXS1Nttaa	Well, I wanted a PlayStation3. I was 12 - 13 at that time. I really just didn't want to fork out $999 Australian dollars. Neither did my parents. And because Grand Theft Auto IV was released, I thought to myself. Do I want to wait until a second price drop (one year on its still priced at $699) or buy a 360.|`|WQbJhFORaa	I choose the 360 because of the Original rep with RPGs and the little touches of your own personality you can impress on your gaming experience.<br>  <br>  I know the PS3 to be a better machine but it is really expensive and big, the game choice is extremely limited when it comes to originality plus it looks like a Gorge Foreman Grill! lol<br>  <br>  I just like the 360 better.<br>  <br>  p.s I have both machines.|`|4AbXxowTaa	This is a hot debate.  I'm going to get both after I return from overseas I think.  The Wii is also a lot of fun.  I think that the 360 has a better selection of games, but the PS3 is a better console, and has exclusive rights to Gran Turismo 5, which is why I have to buy a PS3 when it comes out.|`|jU1LyxxSaa	I don't have any of the both but if i could choose one i think i will take the xbox360 because its cheaper and i read it has also an better graphic|`|5RkoMPdRaa	Better games, better online play. I have both, but rarely use the PS3. I also have a Wii, but played it for about a month and never touched it again.

VJ1C5JsYaa	To answer the question you are more concerned about Im sorry to tell you the answer is no. Scene it is the only game that actually uses those controllers. As for games that allow you to share controllers Im honestly not sure. A lot of fighting games have options that allow you to do that as well as sports games. Overall though normally you need multiple controllers. There are some games though that even though its not considered two player its still fun if you trade off and just play together.
Z2HTjHlRaa	since you already have a tracking number, you can contact ups instead for some details...<br>  <br>  the console stays in the service center for two days and if they cannot fix all the issues of your console for two days you are most likely to receive a replacement console<br>  <br>  and if i am not mistaken, whether you process the repair order online or through their phone support, you get to verify the address first before placing the order, and if the prepaid shipping label given to you before shipping the console to the service center has the correct return address then the console will be returned to the same address, unless your address in invalid when it is looked up in usps,,,|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	MS has been known to take several weeks honestly speaking if it has only taken that long so far I would consider myself lucky. However if they did inform you that it was being send to USP and they gave you a return date of some type you should contact them about it on the day it should have been returned. Also sometimes the UPS location that they ship all the stuff to is not the one nearest them. Since if they ship it in bulk Im sure they get a discount.

VJ1C5JsYaa	Ok and ignoring the fanboy looking for a flame war.....<br>  <br>  Well getting the HD is a pretty big deal due to the fact that if you play games you normally want to save them also. If you don't think it will be long between the time you get the arcade and then get the HD it should not be a problem since the 512mem that you will have should just cover what you might need. If you don't think you would be able to get it for a bit then I would just save and buy it at once so you don't have to worry about it. Its really your call but I think that you are going to want the HD sooner rather than later.|`|znccVpkeaa	the xbox 360 is better than the PS3, and don't listen to any fanboys saying the PS3 is better, Xbox live is better than the PS3 network. And it's worth the money to go online.|`|qUuafpuwaa	God no, the hard drive alone is around $100 for 20GB, might as well wait for a 60GB hard drive premium.<br>  <br>  The arcade has a 500 something memory card that has 5 games on it already and has the system taking up some memory just to run so you can save about 2 games on there. You also need a hard drive to get an xbox live account.<br>  <br>  I however hate the 360. Here's why(even though you don't care);<br>  <br>  360=60GB Hard drive, 1 wireless controller(uses batteries), ethernet cable, Xbox live trial, and in some places lego batman and kung fu panda games.<br>  <br>  PS3=80GB Hard drive, 1 wireless controller(rechargable and comes with cable), FREE Playstation Network.<br>  <br>  PS3 also has built in wireless, if you want wireless for the 360 it'll cost another $100 so that evens out the price difference.<br>  <br>  If you want to get a rechargable battery for 360's controllers, thats another $20, $12 if you don't want the cable to charge it with.<br>  <br>  Xbox live is $50 a year, playstation's online is free unless you want to buy a game or movie online. You also buy stuff off of the Xbox live market also.<br>  <br>  Graphics don't matter as the difference between 1080i and 1080p are negligible. <br>  <br>  In terms of HD movies, PS3 plays Blu-Rays and 360 needs you to pay for Netflix service(additional cost).<br>  <br>  Exclusive Games for 360=Gears of War 1 and 2, Halo3, Halo Wars, Fable 2, Halo ODST, Halo infinity(thats a joke by the way), Masterchief rip offs, and Gears of War sequels.<br>  <br>  Exclusive game for PS3=Killzone 2, Little Big Planet, Metal Gear Solid 4, Gran Turismo, Motorstorm, Ratchet and Clank, Folklore, Haze, Lair, MLB: The Show, NBA: The Inside, Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Warhawk, Socom, Final Fantasy on 1 disk and not 12(joke about 360 again).<br>  <br>  Games coming to PS3 from 360=Red Alert 3 and Uprising(perhaps in one game), Left 4 Dead(Valve said PC and 360 were tests to look at sales and if it sold well enough they would port to PS3).<br>  <br>  I can buy most 360 exclusives on my lap top so I have no need for it.<br>  <br>  NO, Metal Gear Solid is not coming to 360, and even if it did it would have 4 disks. Blu Ray holds a lot more information.<br>  <br>  THE BIG FINALE<br>  360=3 year warranty and a 33% fail rate(yay!)<br>  PS3=1 year warranty and a 3% fail rate(yay!)<br>  <br>  To BMK, you're comparing the medium 360 pro(300) to the 160GB PS3 Drake's Fortune Bundle(500) you moron.<br>  Resistance 1 and 2 have no lag AND have the most players for any online console game(40 and 60 players respectively).<br>  Also, when F.E.A.R ported to PS3 it got an exclusive level. Besides you're also paying for built in wifi AND blu-ray. <br>  <br>  Also, the PS3 has two exclusive games that are multiplayer only: Socom Confrontation, and Warhawk so in your face.|`|WR5ItbuIaa	I would wait to buy one with a harddrive, especially if you plan on playying on xbox live.  In order to play on live you have to download the new xbox experience, and even on my cousins arcade system with memory card, it filled everything up.  <br>  Plus i don't believe you can play on live unless you have a hard drive<br>  *tear*<br>  So my answer, wait for one with a hard drive.|`|TUebsrq3aa	YES buy a 360. They are AWSOME! <br>  Wait untill you can buy the premium XBOX (I think the 60GB is now $300). The core XBox will not satisfy the amout of memory that you will need TRUST ME, my 20GB is almost full now that you can save whole games on your HD.<br>  Dont listen to those other flamer fan boys about the PS3, it SUCKS. The PS3 is twice as expensive as the 360 and for what? bluray? which is stupid because bluray movies are like $50.<br>  <br>  Anyways the 360 is better because:<br>  1. Online has way more compatable games <br>  2. you can actually TALK to poeple on it <br>  3. there are only like 10 (maximum) actually FUN games that are WORTH paying $60 on the PS3<br>  4. PS3 online is HORRIBLE: laggy, vacant, no extras<br>  5. 360 has a well built marketplace where you can download movies, games, add-ons, TV shows, and much other digital media<br>  6. PS3: $500  360: $300<br>  <br>  and last but not least::<br>  owning a PS3 will turn you into a guy like that ^^^ (chino_boy)|`|F5JXQUEAaa	No man, rather wait for the premium version because you'd still have to buy the memory card with the Arcade version.

9mTctb7jaa	it would take an awful lot of hacking. first, video such as the 4:2:0 you refer to is not RGB. standard video is y, y-b, y-r for reasons of bandwidth. Even 3 ccd cameras are not necessarily RGB on the CCDs, and certainly a single CCD camera has no RGB available even internally.  Uncompressed 4:2:2 video is 270 Mbps, a rate too fast to stuff in your common IC chip. To get RGB you need to decode digital video back into analog component, then run through a matrix to convert to R G B analog. There is no standard for "digital" RGB video, you would be inventing a new thing. Perhaps you are thinking of "digitized" analog video something like D2 or D3 videotape, but that is the equivalent of 3:0:0, not even as good as miniDV.

To prevent low-light, motion-blurred pictures; use flash "on" (not auto) up to 12 feet or place camera on a tripod or table and use self timer.  Check camera shooting modes for special situations.  Best light for photos is outside at early morning or evening.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge. To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.

VJ1C5JsYaa	Ok to make it simple it is telling you to plug it directly into the system. A USB hub is a device that you can plug into the system to give you more USB ports. However it is telling you that it has to be connected right to the system and not connected through a hub. So as long as you plug it into anyone of the USB ports on your system you have nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  USB port= the slots on the system<br>  USB hub= a USB port splitter|`|zgvNbIfeaa	steve pretty much nailed it when describing differences between the ports and hubs.  What it comes down to, is that they don't want you to plug the stage kit into the rock band hub that comes with the game. (To allow all 4 instruments to play at once)  This way the stage kit is sure to get all the power it needs.  Plugging the stage kit in the back is only recommended so it doesn't look 'cluttered' really.  You can plug the stage kit into any one of the 3 ports available, front or back.  Besides, most people use the back USB port for the wireless adapter.

I assume this is a place where you race trucks or something so maybe you have a good budget for the right equipment.  Sound level monitoring equipment is common now.  Many outdoor concerts are mandated to monitor sound levels by the local city government.<br>  <br>  Here is a great meter that would do the job:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.reliabilitydirectstore.com/407355-Personal-Noise-Dosimeter-p/ext-407355.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.reliabilitydirectstore.com/40...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a cheaper one that will capture sound level readings to computer:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.reliabilitydirectstore.com/407768-High-Accuracy-Sound-Level-Meter-p/ext-407768.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.reliabilitydirectstore.com/40...</a>|`|p1dcw35Qaa	With the right meter and software, you can use a laptop to record db levels. I don't think this is really what you want since the meter and software would be somewhere around $200-$300 and it won't distinguish vehicle sound from other sounds. In order to do exactly what your asking, you would need a sound meter capable of distinguishing frequencies and then software to alienate those frequencies and give a sound level. It's possible but your talking about spending thousands on equipment. <br>  Your best bet is to get a db meter (from Radio Shack) that doesn't have computer hookups (they're around $50). This will allow you to read the current noise level and then when the cars start-up, you can subtract the current noise level from the engine sounds and get an idea of the db level. Not too accurate but probably close enough for whatever your doing.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...  <br>   <br>  For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)  <br>   <br>  There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy. Click on the second link in the information above for an example then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.<br>   <br>  This could be the best slim line camera with a viewfinder and ... It's PINK, but it uses a $49.50 Series G Rechargeable 960mAh lithium-ion battery.<br>  <a href="http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Sony%20Cyber-shot%20DSC-W150%2FR%20Digital%20Camera:1995337750;_ylc=X3oDMTB0bjZzaWNuBF9TAzk2NjMyOTA3BHNlYwNmZWVkBHNsawNlbGVj">http://shopping.yahoo.com/p:Sony%20Cyber...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/default.asp?newsID=3462&review=sony+cybershot+w150" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/defau...</a> ...<br>   <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

The following information should help you know what to look for in a camera.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (both hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge. To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, format in camera, keep batteries charged, and don't delete or fill card completely. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>   <br>  Lots of great camera tips in this link.<br>  <a href="http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going_digital/#resolution" rel="nofollow">http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going...</a> ...<br>   <br>  My camera has 5.2 mega pixel, but I use 3 most of the time because it gives great results, is faster, and takes less memory. Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7 x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic. <br>   <br>  Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices.

WFRooU7Maa	If you go to system settings and go down to backup utility<br>  You can backup your PS3 system to an external hard drive<br>  and then restore it later on the same or another system<br>  <br>  Also you can put certain data on USbs but not all data|`|1WgOj89kaa	Put all of the data you want on a usb pendrive, and then transfer it to the other PS3.|`|qtlzdtMVaa	Just use a USB memory stick. Plug it in then copy your saved games on it. Works like a charm =)
qGfAlDd2aa	As long as the signal is strong enough for your set to decode, it should work.|`|oYJz8fYwaa	Yes - you will need a dual input box between the two different aerials and the cable feeding the TV.

Then simply drag and drop your MP3 format audio onto the micro sd card. Remove the reader, put the sd card into your R4, load the multimedia section. The simply hit A or tap the song and it will play.<br>  <br>  If you begin to put more music onto the R4 I suggest making a Music folder for easy access.

A1S5KNUkaa	Really listen to their needs and wants and dislikes and assess what holiday will suit them best.  Clarify back to them what they're looking for (they like that!!) and when suggesting the holiday you think is appropriate tell them why you've chosen it and not the other options (they usually give you 3 holidays to choose from).  Make notes as they're telling you what they like so you don't confuse yourself and can give accurate answers.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps =)
qGfAlDd2aa	Well .... actually nobody knows if you in particular are watching CSI. But, statically, they can guess that you are . . .<br>  <br>  Actually, shows get credit based on surveys. The survey data is collected in a number of ways.<br>  <br>  1) People Meters and Household Meters - this is equipment that the ratings survey company installs on your TV at your house (with your permission, of course) that reads codes hidden in the picture and audio that records what is on the TV and when.<br>  2) Ratings diaries - these are books that viewers fill out about their viewing habits.<br>  3) Telephone surveys.<br>  <br>  In all cases, the viewers know that they are part of a survey group, agree to participate, and are usually paid some small amount for supplying viewing data. That data from the *small* survey group (a.k.a. sample) is then run through some mathematical magic to calculate the "rating" for each show.<br>  <br>  These things are not always 100% accurate, but it's the best the industry has. I can remember one station where I worked where one rating book said we were #1 sign on to sign off 7 days a week. We didn't believe it, the other stations didn't believe it, but we made a lot of sales that calendar quarter! Other periods, the book sucks for no good reason and we have to live with that too, so it all balances out . . .<br>  <br>  So you see, when they say "5.6 million people are watching the game right now" they really don't know for sure, but they can make an educated guess!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|6F32sfLeaa	wow i was gonna ask that here<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  thanks for saving my 5 points<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you mean TRP, right?|`|AA10044154	They do statistics based on Nielson ratings.

jKc7aDCwaa	I think the most common answer (and probably easiest to find online nowadays) is using a USB Gecko. There's also a SD Gecko that accepts SD cards. However, there's a few other animals out there, such as a "USB Memory Adaptor" which is essentially a memory card with a mini-USB socket on it that you can hook up to a USB port and the Datel Max Drive, basically the same thing but a little more common, except it's been discontinued.<br>  <br>  Note that some Gamecube save games are protected and can't be copied easily via the GC (such as Animal Crossing). I haven't done much research into this so I'm not sure of the method to get around it, but I'm sure there's one out there.

nhYABprkaa	all products made by dazzle have been junk for me, I used to use an Adaptec videoh for transferring vids <br>  <br>  Mayve try the dazzle with pinnacle software?|`|3CJAUyqPaa	The Sony DCR-HC52 is miniDV tape based.<br>  <br>  Connect the DV port (not USB) on the camcorder to the firewire port (not USB) on your computer. Nothing will "pop up". Launch your video editor and import or capture the video. The camcorder needs to be in "Play/Edit" mode.<br>  <br>  If your computer does not have a firewire port, hopefully it has an available expansion slot so you can add one. Since you did not tell us which computer hard ware you are using, we have no way to know if it already has a firewire port or an expansion slot to add one.<br>  <br>  In the remote chance you actually get USB streaming to work, the video will be low-quality... and not the high quality DV format you can get when imported using firewire.<br>  <br>  Firewire, IEEE1394, DV and i.LINK are all the same thing - and they are not USB.<br>  <br>  USB-firewire converter/hub/cable/adapter things won't work.<br>  <br>  The Pinnacle Dazzle is used for importing analog (low quality) video - connect the camcorder AV cables to the camcorder and the Dazzle. Connect the Dazzle to your computer. The Dazzle came with some software - use it to import the low quality video, then convert it so your other editors can deal with it.<br>  <br>  The reason the DV item cannot be selected is because DV format video travels ONLY over firewire.<br>  <br>  ++++++++++++++++++<br>  <br>  If your computer has a working firewire port, you do not need to use the Dazzle.

0a08a9ebe0d90054b2aea5e794cee7d0aa	Connect optical cables output from HD receiver and DVD player to the amp input.|`|p1dcw35Qaa	Hi Scott, the easiest way is to hook everything into the tv then connect audio out from the tv (optical connection if you have it on both the tv and the receiver/amp or rca connections if you don't have optical) to the amp. You may need to go into the tv setup[ menu and set the audio output to fixed. Now whatever you have on screen will send that audio to the amp and you can use the amps volume to control the sound level. You will need to switch the amp to the input you used for the tv, of course.

1WgOj89kaa	Check if your other games have this problem, if so, call Sony, if not, it is a game specific problem.|`|lebKMTaQaa	Well, first I would check other types of disc (CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray movies) and see if any of them play. This should give you an idea of how big the problem really is. Also, try a few other games and see if it is just the one game or all games. Check your discs to make sure they are in good condition. Usually a freezing problem is associated with an issue with the lens, not the hdd. You could back up your files on a flash card and then restore the hdd. This will erase the hard drive and should cure any issues with it. Then just put the files back. You also may want to run a lens cleaning disc in the machine. Sony doesn't recommend doing that, but if the machine won't work, how much harm can it really do? If none of this helps, it is probably the lens and will need to be sent back to Sony for repair. I think they will refurbish the machine for about $150.|`|QxtdyNvgaa	your ps3 is overheating because it needs good ventilation and air space<br>  you need a 10cm gap around the ps3 so you ps3 can blow air out witrh its fan.<br>  move it to an appropiate place!

8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	I just bought a TV locally and, based on the rave reviews of Amazon's customer service and return policy, I wish I had saved the $200 and gone through them.

fwdsp3dVaa	That's ridiculous!!!<br>  <br>  They absolutely DO NOT have to be charged every 2 years! Today's Plasma TV's last just as long as LCD, if not longer!<br>  <br>  See the link below for the FACTS about Plasma TV's.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	There is no "charging" plasma.  Every plasma I've seen has a 100,000 half life.  That means if you watched 4 hours of TV every day your plasma would be half as bright as when you bought it in the year 2070.<br>  <br>  Burn-in is a reality, but having used mine for video games and regular TV watching (including channels with logos on the screen) I have yet to even see image retention--the precursor to burn-in--much less burn-in.  That's because it's not a problem any more.  Just don't fall asleep watching TV and there won't be a problem.|`|p9RQcqNzaa	no its a dying technology at this point. the charging thing every 2 years isn't accurate either. its a common misconception, its more like every 5 to 8. plasma has a burn in issue wich is when you expose the tv to a an image for a prolonged amount of time, the image will actually " burn in" or leave a ghost image on the screen permanetly. best example is CNN the red bar that scrolls info across the bottom of the screen that never leaves would burn in over time. this problem makes video gaming a big no no as well. overall its just not a good investment|`|S1LxX6CNaa	Update: If you're in the market for a flat screen television, then you probably have one big question you want answered: plasma vs LCD, which is right for me?<br>  <br>  The two different camps of flat panel display standard will, of course, gladly spruik the advantages of their own standard and the deficiencies of the other. But which type of display, plasma or LCD, is better? And which will give you more bang for your buck?<br>  <br>  1. Plasma and LCD - what's the difference? | 2. Picture quality | 3. Plasma's advantages over LCD | 4. LCD's advantages over plasma | 5. Which is better value? | 6. Do I need to buy 1080p?<br>  <br>  1. Plasma and LCD technology - what's the difference?<br>  Plasma and LCD panels may look similar, but the flat screen and thin profile is where the similarities end. Plasma screens, as its name suggests, uses a matrix of tiny gas plasma cells charged by precise electrical voltages to create a picture. LCD screens (liquid crystal display) are in layman's terms sandwiches made up of liquid crystal pushed in the space between two glass plates. Images are created by varying the amount electrical charge applied to the crystals. Each technology has its strengths and weaknesses, as you'll read below.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Samsung's 1080p 46-inch LA46M81BDX LCD TV<br>  <br>  2. Is there a difference in picture quality between plasma and LCD screens and normal CRT TVs?<br>  It's not what's happening behind the screen that's important - it's how the screen performs as a television that matters the most. In that regard, both plasma and LCD sets produce excellent pictures, although many home entertainment specialists and gamers still say CRTs produce the best overall images (although the latest plasmas are particularly good, and LCD sets are quickly catching up in terms of quality).<br>  Those same home entertainment specialists will tell you that for basic home theatre-like usage, plasma screens have a slight edge over LCDs. This is because plasma screens can display blacks more accurately than LCDs can, which means better contrast and detail in dark-coloured television or movie scenes. The nature of LCD technology, where a backlight shines through the LCD layer, means it's hard for it to achieve true blacks because there's always some light leakage from between pixels. This is steadily improving with every new generation of LCD, however.<br>  <br>  3. What advantages does plasma have over LCD?<br>  Apart from better contrast due to its ability to show deeper blacks, plasma screens typically have better viewing angles than LCD. Viewing angles are how far you can sit on either side of a screen before the picture's quality is affected. You tend to see some brightness and colour shift when you're on too far of an angle with LCDs, while a plasma's picture remains fairly solid. This is steadily changing, however, with more and more LCDs entering the market with viewing angles equal to or greater than some plasmas. Plasmas can also produce a brighter colour, once again due to light leakage on an LCD affecting its colour saturation.<br>  Plasma pundits will also tell you that some LCD screens have a tendency to blur images, particularly during fast moving scenes in movies or in sports. While that was true for older generation LCD screens, newer models have improved significantly -- so much so that the differences in performance between LCDs and plasmas in this regard is almost negligible (here's a tip -- if you're shopping for LCDs, check the pixel response time, measured in ms. The lower it is, the better the image quality in fast moving scenes).<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  A new 42" plasma from Hitachi<br>  <br>  Traditionally, the biggest advantage plasmas have had over their LCD cousins is price, particularly in the large screen end of the market. In the past 12 months, this has changed, with LCDs matching or even beating plasmas in both resolution and price. Plasmas being sold in Australia generally run between 42-inches and 63-inches wide, with the cheapest standard definition 42-inch selling for approximately AU$2,300 (although you can expect to find sets cheaper than AU$2,000 in real world prices). 60-inch and above plasmas can go for as much as $25,000.<br>  <br>  LCDs, on the other hand, generally top out around the 52-inch mark -- though there is now a ludicrously expensive 70-inch Sony available -- but are incredibly competitive with similar-sized plasmas. In the six months since we last updated this feature, prices of the replacements of two flagship TVs have dropped by a third. Sony's high end 52-inch KDL52W3100 LCD, for example, retails for AU$6,799 (down from AU$9,999), while Pioneer's top of the line 50-inch PDP-LX508A plasma goes for AU$$7,999 (down from AU$10,999).<br>  <br>  4. What advantages does LCD have over plasma?<br>  Apart from being price competitive, LCD has the edge over plasma in several other key areas. LCDs tend to have higher native resolution than plasmas of similar size, which means more pixels on a screen.<br>  LCDs also tend to consume less power than plasma screens, with some est|`|m40AF75Haa	Yes and no. The newer plasmas have a longer life span and even that depends on your viewing hours. You should get about 7 - 10 years of service. If you have your TV "calibrated" you can get even more usage. If you don't want the headache consider an Lcd.

4Pk6VNftaa	There are still a few PS2 games planned for release this year, such as Nobunaga's Ambition from Koei - and this title isn't being released on the PS3 (very strange.)  There will probably be a few titles released even next year on the PS2 as well, but the majority of the developers have moved to the PS3 or 360.<br>  <br>  Anyways, if you still want to get a new console, take a look at the exclusives on each console.  I think the 360 has the strongest edge here with a better variety of titles, and better rated titles overall.  The 360 also has the best RPG library right now.<br>  <br>  Just looking at the 2 in terms of gaming, the 360 is still head and shoulders above the PS3.  It has more exclusives, and better exclusives than the PS3.  If you're OK with buying used games from eBay or a store, the prices are lower and the games more plentiful.  The 360's online service is more polished than the PS3's - even though it'll cost you $50/year to play online with the 360.  The 360 offers more games with online support.  You only have a single login with a centralized friend list.  <br>  <br>  On the PS3, not all games are on the same network, so you can't tell if your friends are online or not, and you'll need multiple login/password accounts for each game server if it's not part of PSN.  This just makes the PS3's online capabilities feel like it's more of an effort on your part, whereas on the 360 the integration is nearly seamless.<br>  <br>  Finally, there's the price of the hardware.  The 360 Pro comes with 2 games (albeit, one of  them is Kung Fu Panda...) but it also comes with a set of HD cables, and a headset.  The 80GB PS3 costs $100 more, doesn't come with any games, no headset, and no HD cables.  The 160GB PS3 costs $200 more, comes with 1 game, but still no headset or HD cables.  The higher price may be justified if the graphics were better on the PS3 - but from what I've seen (and I have both) that's not the case.  Games that are available on both consoles look nearly identical, so why spend $100-200 more?  <br>  <br>  Sure, the PS3 plays blu-ray movies - and if that is an interesting feature for you, the PS3 may still be the right choice for you.  But that's really the only reason I can give you for choosing the PS3 over the 360.<br>  <br>  Oh, and don't worry about the 360's quality.  The latest hardware has corrected the Red Ring Of Death that plagued earlier versions.  From personal experience, my 360 from last year (which has the latest hardware) is still going strong, whereas my PS3 died after a few dozen(!) hours of use.  Maybe I just got unlucky, but I sure wasn't pleased to have yet another Playstation die on me due to the media drive getting gummed up.|`|6Gm7TFQ4aa	They're both excellent systems with great cross platform and exclusive games. I'd love to own a Xbox 360 as well, but I went with the PS3 because I wanted the convenience of having a very nice Blu-Ray player and Game System for my new HDTV. I've been having a blast with Little Big Planet (Exclusive title), Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm (Exclusive Title), and I can't wait for Killzone 2 this Friday (Exclusive) and God of War III later this year (Also Exclusive). <br>  <br>  There was a time when the PS3 had no good games to justify ownership of a system. Thankfully, that is changing quickly now.|`|ad2faoKcaa	Games for the PS2 are still being made but not as heavy as they were ! <br>  <br>  If you have a PS2 then why not get a PS3 ! Deciding what system to get is a personal decision that you need to make. I got a PS3 because I've had Playstation systems since the PS1 so it was only logical that I get a PS3.<br>  <br>  NOTE: Keep in mind that the current 80GB and 160GB PS3 models WILL NOT PLAY PS2 GAMES !|`|pl2SocVKaa	they say ps2 won't be discontiued from gaming till up to 4 years but its game library will vanish to the point where only sports games come out so  just get ps3|`|k6CSa9caaa	PS3 all the way.|`|c231bbpTaa	I own a PS3 and love it. Since you already are a playstation owner then I'm sure you will love the PS3. You might want to find a PS3 that is backwards compatible though so you can play your ps2 games on it. For that you need the 60g or an 80g with 4 USB ports. The new 80g aren't backwards compatible. They are hard to find right now but are worth it. Try gamestop.com. I know a couple of weeks ago they still had used ones. I bought mine used in the store but are becoming very hard to find. You can always go on ebay but you will most likely be over charged. PS3's are generally more expensive then a 360, so if you have the cash defiantly go for the PS3. But if you decide on a 360 then don't buy the $200 arcade version because there is no hard drive.|`|J9WjWVABaa	i have both the ps3 and the xbox 360 they are both really great ,on the games part i have more ps3 games then the xbox.

436Ogx8Baa	Yes they do, because newer phones have better antennas which pick up the reception better. My friend has a Blackberry and they are great phones :) also it depends what provider your with such as optus, telstra, vodafone and virgin mobile etc. Hope this helps Cya :)|`|01dExFwDaa	yes, and no. new cell phones have a better chance and getting a signal as long as they use the right modes. if you get a new digital only cell phone you are not going to get a signal in an area that has analog only. if you live in an rural area you have a greater chance of not having the digital signal, you will want to check your coverage area and i would recommend a tri-mode phone for you next purchase they have a better chance of getting all signals.

And that's normal about the lightning. Everyone doesn't return to normal at the same time. It depends on what position you were in when the lightning took affect. If the person in last place used it, whoever was in eleventh would recover after like 3 seconds. Whoever was in first will recover last.|`|XnNhaxwPaa	It's called "Rubberband A.I."  You often see it in sports games as well....when the CPU is down or behind, it will conveniently do something (i.e. cheat) to get caught back up.

The laser reader inside should be fine since it plays music and dvd's - that's really strange.<br>  <br>  Good Luck anyways lol.|`|FuR0RpCfaa	How old is it? When was the last time you cleaned it? Look for the instructions that say how to properly clean the game console. If you cannot find it take a Q-Tip with a little rubbing alcohol (not dripping) and try to clean in and around where you put the disc in. Make sure all discs that go in are clean and free of any dust, residue and fingerprints. If that does not work then check your paperwork for a warranty and try to exchange it at the store you purchased it from or if that does not work contact the manufacturer and see if you can get it fixed. Good luck. Oh and if you have kids make sure they did not shove something in there that was not supposed to be in there.

I just bought a plasma.  This after 3 years with an LCD.  Why?  Because plasmas have better pictures, but also because the 50" plasma I bought is about $600 less expensive than its LCD equivalent.  But the decision wasn't a slam dunk by any means.  The risk of burn-in isn't nearly what it was a few years ago, but you still must be aware of the threat.  So the plasma is higher maintenance, but considering it has a better picture and costs so much less I consider that to be a good trade off.  Also, plasmas last just as long as LCDs, so that isn't a factor.

AA11256390	Mobiles now a days use Li-ion (Lithium ion) technology which is different and much better than the old Ni-Mh (Nickel metal Hydride). Basically you will prolong the life by charging them early and often, which is a little different than the old ones where you had to flatten them at least once every two months. If you run them flat all the time you will damage and shorten the life of the battery by quite a lot. You can read a little on it here which will confirm this. I used to work at a wholesaler that sold items that took these batteries and have had to get used to the new technologies and how they work over the last few years<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-ion_battery#Guidelines_for_prolonging_Li-ion_battery_life" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li-ion_batt...</a>|`|pkZBBvlzaa	2nd I think|`|mWdap8Fvaa	it is better for them to be let run right down then charged back up and just keep on doing this. i used to charge it every night but this knackered the battery completely|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	you should let them completely run out occassionally but you do not need to every time.

Sony Ericsson W580i is a testament not to discount just how important the 'cool factor' of a mobile phone could be. Never mind the extra features or goodies, and strip away all the inner software, the cool factor relates, quite simply, to how stylishly awesome a mobile phone is. In the case of Sony Ericsson's W580i, this could not be more clear, as, there are many other mobile phones that offer much better features, and yet, few that really just look anywhere near as cool.
c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.  <br>  <a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A590IS/A590ISA.HTM" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-powershot-8-0-megapixel.html" rel="nofollow">http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po...</a> ...<br>   <br>  There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy.

Camera prices at this link change often.  <br>   <br>  For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera.

Nikon has proved with the D40 that mega pixels aren't the only things that matter for picture quality. This is because the D40 only has 6 mega pixels. The D40x is the newer D40 with 4 more mega pixels built in. It's pretty much the same thing as the earlier D40 except for the pixel count. I have the D60 which I bought for less than $700 with a 18-55mm VR Nikkor lens. It takes breathtaking pictures but it is a little on the expensive side compared to the D40 (about $200 more). I would highly recommend that if you're going to be purchasing any of these cameras then make sure it's a it with an 18-55mm VR Nikkor lens and a zoom 55-200mm VR lens. If you only want to have one lens then you can purchase an 18-200mm VR lens for over $500 or you could get an 18-200mm lens for around $200 without Vibration Reduction. If you don't want a DSLR at all then I would highly recommend the Nikon Coolpix P80. It has an 18x optical zoom with image stabilization. This is a really nice camera and is a great deal. The only reason I don't like this camera is because it's a little large and too big to fit into your pocket. However if that' no problem for you then you might want this. Also if you want to get a excellent quality point and shoot camera then I would get a Samsung SL310w. I have this camera and the reason I got it is because Consumer Reports rated this camera EXCELLENT for image quality while no other point and shoot cameras were rated this high. It also has dual image stabilization. Good luck and I hope this helps you.

eUZ3nAj5aa	the itouch is by far the best ipod ever, i love mine<br>  you can get all of the same apps but some of them wont work as well like if you need gps, i have heard they are cheaper in the states, i live in japan and they are 100 dollers more expensive. if you buy it in the states, all you will need to do is set the language to dutch(is that what you speak??) and you have to set the location to denmark or it will say you are not authorized to dp anyhting from there. by the way, you need an itunes account to buy apps|`|MpoQljzOaa	well i can ask the second part and yes they are exactly the same and do the same things but the ipod touch dosent have text or call features <br>  <br>  hope this helps :)

Also if you get an edge card (which costs you about $15 a year and it comes with a subscription to Game Informer Magazine) you get an additional 10% off all used games and accessories.

KLL0Acrwaa	LOL, are your friends photographers?<br>  <br>  Here's the real deal:  You won't go wrong with either camera, but the thing to do is actually handle the cameras you are interested in and make your decision based on what works for you personally, not what works for other people.  <br>  <br>  Generally speaking, Canon point and shoots are more highly regarded than Nikon point and shoots.  In SLRs, Nikon has been doing better than Canon.  So, personally, I own a Canon point and shoot and use Nikon SLRs.  Obviously, after handling the cameras yourself, you may feel differently, much the same way that some people might prefer a Lexus over a BMW (or vice-versa).<br>  <br>  So the best advice:  handle the cameras yourself, compare the build quality, ergonomics, menu systems (as well as the specs).  Make a decision based on facts and your personal conclusions, instead of the opinions of others (particularly the opinions of people who either have no real experience or who you don't know at all!).|`|6584a2c112e4342d61a5a55cbb9aafd0aa	I chose Nikon. Nothing wrong with Canon, but I chose Nikon.|`|1F6KJt0oaa	Of those two I say you can't go wrong with Pentax.  <br>  <br>  Canon and Nikon got to the top with marketing and ridiculously specific lenses.  Also they were early adopters to digital and even earlier abandoners of film.  The thing with Pentax is they give you a ton of more bang for your camera buying buck.  They consistently win best value in Digital SLR cameras.  If you are a mindless lemming and want to narrow your choices to Nikon or Canon then good luck deciding which is best.  Generally speaking Nikon people will tell you Nikon and Canon people will tell you Canon.  As you have seen Pentax people will tell you Pentax and Olympus people will tell you Olympus.  There are also loyal followings of Samsung, and Sony.  To get right down to it though, I would say Canon makes the better cameras, Nikon makes the better lenses.  If you think the lens makes the camera then go with Nikon.  If you think that the lenses already far exceed the capture capabilities of the camera anyway then go with Canon.  If you want to be a photographer start with film.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	I believe my school offers Canon for use in photography courses. I'm more biased towards Nikon, because I'm a Nikon user. Similarily, a Canon use would prefer their bodies over a nikon. But really, those who spend time trying to figure which is the best and all are also the ones that take crap pictures; cuz they bother with all the technical details that shouldn't matter at all to them. I really dont care how many megapixels a camera has, whether it has live view, dust prevention, or a 930 000 pixel lcd screen, or whether it has a pentamirror or a pentaprism viewfinder.|`|TwIK4Ivlaa	I asked 10 people near my home if they liked Coca Cola more or Pepsi.

b8tgCAQJaa	The DSi is not a PSP "killer", any more than the Wii is a PS3 "killer".<br>  <br>  They are totally different machines aimed at different markets, with the Nintendo machines appealing more to casual gamers and Sony being more for the hardcore crowd. There are 80-year-old grandmothers buying DSs for heavens sake, people who would never in a million years buy any Sony or Microsoft console.<br>  <br>  I personally think the DSi will be overpriced at $169.00, and I can't see many people being tempted to upgrade from their DS Lites. Nevertheless, once the price comes down to match the original DS Lite it will be a success with people who haven't been tempted to join the DS party yet. I will be buying one when the price comes down.<br>  <br>  What I'm worried about is that the DSi will split the market, with some games being made only for the DSi and others that will play on any DS. This harmed the Gameboy market, what with all the variants of that console (original, Color and Advance) and I can see the same thing happening with the DS.|`|EpvHhbByaa	1.

VJ1C5JsYaa	1.Unplug the power cord from the console. <br>  2.Position the Xbox 360 console horizontally<br>  3.Remove the console faceplate.<br>  4.Depending on the type of disc drive that you have in your Xbox 360 console, use one of the following methods: <br>  ?Method A: Insert a straightened paper clip or another small, stiff wire into the first hole from the left side of the disc tray. To release the disc tray, push the paperclip into the hole to press the manual eject mechanism. The manual eject mechanism is a white lever that is visible behind the console casing. The hole is located about one-and-a-half inches (approximately four centimeters) from the left edge of the disc tray.<br>  ?Method B: Insert a straightened paper clip or another small, stiff wire into the second hole from the left side of the disc tray. Push the paperclip repeatedly into the hole to turn a gear to release the disc tray. The hole is located about one-and-a-half inches (approximately four centimeters) from the left edge of the disc tray.<br>  ?Method C: Insert a straightened paper clip or another small, stiff wire into the into the hole that is directly under the "X3" in the Xbox 360 label on the disc tray to release the disc tray. The hole is located about one inch from the right edge of the disc tray.<br>  <br>  Note In each case, make sure that you line up the paperclip or stiff wire to pass through another notch behind the hole on the console casing.<br>  <br>  5.After you release the disc tray, the tray will pop out slightly. You can pull the tray out the rest of the way to remove the disc.

You can find and correct this in the 'network and sharing center' on your Vista PC. It will list the status next to the network name.

Also, you cannot share files on a public network, it will always revert back to being not shared.<br>  <br>  With that in mind, you should get WMP 11 to work, or even simply right click on a folder you want to share and share it. (I don't use WMP 11 to share, myself)  You're not missing out too much on the media center because you still can't play Divx/Xvid files through it.  You can only play .WMV video files.

Equally important is to have each individual electronic item in it's own protective padded pouch. <br>  <br>  Cables and chargers, not quite as important, but they should stay separately bagged, even if only in zip-lock bags, to keep them from tangling and easier to separate for individual use.<br>  <br>  However, if they will be thrown in the trunk of the car with golf clubs, scuba gear, etc. go for a hard case like a mini suitcase.
VJ1C5JsYaa	I would love to help you but you need to include some more information. Are you having trouble with something? Do you need to know the basic hook up? <br>  <br>  If you simply are looking to find out how to connect to Xbox Live then this is the basic steps.<br>  <br>  1. Connect the xbox of the xbox to your broadband modem or your router if you have one.<br>  2. Turn on your xbox.<br>  3. Follow the steps that you are given to sign up for live.<br>  <br>  Alright in the case that your Modem and Xbox are far from eachother like you say then you need to do 1 of three things. All three require you to have a router if you want to be able to be on live and your computer at the same time. 2 require the router no matter what.<br>  In a case where you are using the router you attach the modem to the WAN port on the router then the computer and xbox to anyone of the other open port on the router. Also in all cases the last step is to turn your xbox on and select Xbox Live and set up your account(if you dont have one it give you the instructions on how to do that on screen)<br>  <br>  1. Buy a long ethernet cable to run it to the modem (if you will only be on live) or a router if you want to be able to use both.(in this case follow the directions I had given above)<br>  <br>  2. Get a wireless router and buy the xbox 360 wireless adapter.(simply attach the wireless adapter to the xbox and allow it to find the wireless router on its own.)<br>  <br>  3. Requires more work. You have to have a Laptop with wireless access and a router.<br>  <br>  a. Attach xbox to laptop with an ethernet cable<br>  b. Allow the laptop to access the wireless internet<br>  c. Open your network connections on the computer<br>  d. highlight both the wireless connection you have and the LAN connection to the xbox.<br>  e. Right click and select "share connection" or "bridge connection"<br>  f. sign on to live and play.
RCbtRF4xaa	Nikon has really found the perfect camera for beginner's and advanced shooter's alike, and it's call the D90. I am not a beginner, but let me tell you if I was, this is the camera to get. It has a lot of buttons but that is no problem, if you don't know what something is in the menu's just hit the question mark button and a descriptive explanation lights up the D90's beautiful improved high res screen. The screen is why I bought the D90 instead of the D40 or D60, it lets me eyeball my exposure accuratley that way I can make the necessary adjustments to my EX comp, WB, and ISO. This camera is often compared to the D300, I can tell you this, if you are thinking of buying one or the other, there are only 3 differences between these 2 camera's. 1. If you are a casual shooter who does not need 1/8000 shutter speed then get the D90 with its 1/4000 SS, this is more than adequate for most sports and action shooting. The D300 excels when it comes to faster moving objects, like racecars. 2. The D300 has 51 Autofocus points while the D90 has 11. You will only need the extra AF points if you are doing really high speed Action, although the AF on the D300 is really sweet, it has lighting speed AF, but like most things in life, people will pay for this feature and never use it, thats where you will save you hard earned cash buying the D90. 3. SIZE, the D90 is a lot smaller and weighs less, due to the fact that the D300 has and Aluminum frame, and better weather sealing, I will say that the D90 is no slouch in the construction department though it feels very well built. So if you are really pondering which one to get, I say for most purposes the D90 is a year newer, has video, the same picture quality and low light capability (except for the AF of the D300, which focuses a bit faster in lowlight) You can save 500 bucks, and get better Lenses, I shoot Nikons pro glass with my D90 and love it, I have the 70-200 VR 2.8, and the 24-70 2.8 and let me tell you there is no comparison. Those lenses are tack sharp with this camera. Or if you cannot afford those lenses, then get the D90 body and the 16-85 VR Nikon lens, you won't be disappointed. <br>  <br>  Nikon D90 DX 12.3MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6G ED AF-S VR DX Nikkor Zoom Lens<br>  price: $1,159.95<br>  reference: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D90-Digital-18-105mm-3-5-5-6G/dp/B001ENOZY4/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s=photo&qid=1235404750&sr=1-6&tag=commentglitte-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D90-Digital-...</a><br>  <br>  hope that help.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	try the link below|`|1jFG5h1iaa	If I were you and you want a DSLR then I would've already narrowed it down to a Nikon. Nikon has proved with the D40 that mega pixels aren't the only things that matter for picture quality. This is because the D40 only has 6 mega pixels. The D40x is the newer D40 with 4 more mega pixels built in. It's pretty much the same thing as the earlier D40 except for the pixel count. I have the D60 which I bought for less than $700 with a 18-55mm VR Nikkor lens. It takes breathtaking pictures but it is a little on the expensive side compared to the D40 (about $200 more). I would highly recommend that if you're going to be purchasing any of these cameras then make sure it's a it with an 18-55mm  VR Nikkor lens and a zoom 55-200mm VR lens. If you only want to have one lens then you can purchase an 18-200mm VR lens for over $500 or you could get an 18-200mm lens for around $200 without Vibration Reduction. If you don't want a DSLR at all then I would highly recommend the Nikon Coolpix P80. It has an 18x optical zoom with image stabilization. This is a really nice camera and is a great deal. The only reason I don't like this camera is because it's a little large and too big to fit into your pocket. However if that' no problem for you then you might want this. Also if you want to get a excellent quality point and shoot camera then I would get a Samsung SL310w. I have this camera and the reason I got it is because Consumer Reports rated this camera EXCELLENT for image quality while no other point and shoot cameras were rated this high. It also has dual image stabilization. Good luck and I hope this helps you.|`|AqKALUItaa	Most digital cameras from any of the âknownâ brands will be good.

p1dcw35Qaa	Check your cables and input channel. Sounds like the tv is turning on but not getting any signal. You may have switched the input by mistake.
j5Apt8hWaa	Actually when any my students show up with a VR lens, I have them turn off that feature so they have a better reason to learn to hold their cameras steady using the old tried and true methods used by photographers over the decades.  <br>  <br>  When they can finally shoot hand held a relatively slow shutter speeds, without camera movement blur (and I am evil and give out assignments that require slower shutter speeds), then the VR can be a very useful tool when having to shoot at say 1/8 of a second hand held.<br>  <br>  VR at 200 mm + can be an advantage for a seasoned photographer, but you will notice at sporting events, we use at a minimum a monopod and when in the photographers well at MLB games, we have our longest lens on a tripod..|`|0AqkCOWIaa	In short, yes. You will need Vibration reduction when you are in low lit scenes. In direct sunlight this will not be an issue, but when the sun is covered in the clouds, or the sun is going down, you will find it extremely useful! Trust me, VR is necessary when you are using 200mm + lenses. The image stabilized version of lenses are usually more expensive, but trust me the pictures will justify the purchase. Vibration Reduction is definitely necessary, better to use that then high ISO speeds.|`|6584a2c112e4342d61a5a55cbb9aafd0aa	I would never call VR "necessary" since we've been taking pictures without it for decades (over 2 decades for me personally). It is a useful feature that allows you some added flexibility that wasn't available before, such as shooting at slower shutter speeds handheld. The old rule of thumb was that the shutter speed should be 1/the focal length of the lens to shoot hand held, and nothing below 1/60 (1/30 if you had really steady hands). So for your 200mm lens the rule suggests you shouldn't be attempting to shoot hand held slower than 1/200. With VR you can now extend that range and shoot at slower shutter speeds with longer lenses and really slow with fast lenses. Before the solution was to use a tripod or some physical support mechanism to hold the camera, now you have the ability to hold the camera and still get the shot (within limits, of course, nothing's perfect).|`|1jFG5h1iaa	I have a 55-200mm lens and it doesn't have VR. It takes fine pictures and I don't even like VR on any zoom lens because it makes it too big and takes up way too much space. Bottom line is that it takes fine pictures and for a pro photographer I was reading something saying that you don't need VR on anything more than 100mm zoom. Yours is inly 135mm so I wouldn't worry about it. Good Luck|`|tKWwZpOAaa	Its not really necessary it all, its just nice when your shooting at longer shutter speeds or greater focal lengths. You can easily do without it.|`|pUltSWNnaa	It's not necessary if you use a tripod.
spaMZZiVaa	Well first I'd try using a DVD player or something to test the screen, if you see the same color distortions then it's the screen. If the dvd player image is unaffected it may be your TV's tuner (If I remeber correctly old Samsungs had 2 tuners, one for cable and one for air). Try using the cable one<br>  <br>  Either case you may need Samsung's assistance and good luck with that, Samsung just loves honoring their warranty, be ready to be told that they'll call you in 3 weeks and wait for 3 month when they'll tell you your warranty has now expired|`|dqzoEw67aa	If you have had the tv less than 15 months, go to the Samsung registration link below, register the tv even tho is older, and that will extend your warranty to the 15 months.  Then once you've done that, call Samsung CS and they will send a tech out for free to fix your tv.|`|ntcETBTQaa	Did u get a digital converter box??<br>  They switched tv over|`|OtfSP7kHaa	Go to the menu part and re-tune the over-the-air channels (antenna).|`|Z7K0nnKKaa	reset it.|`|BeyLsBCQaa	get a new tv
JxzawJZVaa	it does this because the ihome is connected to an outlet on the wall i think and it charges it. its like when i connect my itouch to my t.v it has a usb port for it so i can watch videos and music and when its connected it charges and for some reason when i connect  is to something else besides my computer it charges better the charge lasts much longer than on my laptop.
kTTwUY0Waa	You might be able to use a sub if it has a high pass filter, this would mean that you would take your speaker outs to the sub, where the crossover would run the bass to the sub and the high band stuff to two separate speakers outs which you would then take to your regular speakers.

hR4Dfa4Taa	Memory card|`|bC25b4XVaa	Save data to your memory card definitely. The reasons are:<br>  -You buy a memory card to SAVE files.<br>  -You can back up your memory card in computer so you won't lose anything.<br>  -If you save data  in your handset, it's easy to cause problems and you won't be able to back up and so lose all your data.<br>  -Your handset slows if you save too much data on it.<br>  So the conclusion is do not save data in your handset until neccesary.|`|uszV7NEFaa	I have a SideKick and I save all my files to the memory card.

AerXlQwkaa	you have it mixed up. the internet works on wi-fi and 3G, not 3GB. GB is gigabyte. GB is pretty much the space on your phone. the 3G works whenever you use it. just as long as you pay the 25 a month for it then your good. 3G means 3rd generation, and it gives you fast web browsing.<br>  and its a great phone trust me, i was one of the first people to buy the G1 when it came out, and for the new users, you guys dont have to get all angry and irritated with the phone as much as we did, since new G1 users will get the rc-33 update pushed to their phones withing 3 days when you turn it on. the rc-33 update is pretty much a bug fix update. i have friends who had the behold and they all ended up saying they want the G1, and other friends who used the G1 from their friends and now all they do is want the G1. though it has quite a few cons, something about the phone you cant really keep away once you start to have fun with it.
AA11256390	3GB is a lot but as others have said it depends on the size of files downloaded. Having said that you'd be hard pushed to use it all. If you're a big downloader of music then it will reduce it but I reckon you'll not exceed it. Use this link for the Vodafone (it won't matter if you're not on/going to be on that network) site which will give you an idea of how much you can get from 500MB then just times the figures by 6.

us8isFmiaa	You should not need a converter box if you are hooked to cable. Converter boxes are for people with analog TVs that get their programming over the air, i.e. from a TV antenna. About your missing station, if that station stopped broadcasting its analog signal, the cable company should still provide the station for viewers with an analog TV. At least that is what they are saying. It may be on a different channel now. This is a question to ask the cable company. I just thought of something else. You are at a college or university. Are you hooked to a commercial cable company or something private from the school that is providing TV programming to students? If it is a private system from the school, they are controlling what channels you get.|`|flkVehA9aa	If you are on cable then you don't need a converter box.<br>  <br>  Are you sure your hooked up to cable?
