20090223163853AAoi5Jz	Games & Recreation;Amusement Parks	Calling all disneyland fans!!!?	hey this is kinda a werd question but if you have an answer plz share. Ten points for most helpful!!!    ok, so my family hasnt been to disneyland for like 4 years but we used to go all the time. We are going to california and disneyland in a few weeks. My younger siblings barely even remember it and when i talk about rides there and stuff they say they dont want to go and that kind of stuff. Also they think that some rides such as rollercoasters are too "scary" So anyways, what im trying to say is I really liked it as a kid and I want them to go on the rides before they arent kids any more. so does anyone have any advice to make disneyland more fun and get them on rides? also does anyone know any website with travel advice like stuff to do on roadtrips and good stuff to bring etc? any inside disney knowledge would be appreciated.

20090222152248AApEjcK	Games & Recreation;Video & Online Games	Should I buy The Sims 2 or wait until The Sims 3 comes out?	Okay, so here is my sims obsession...      I first saw the sims back in 2005.  It had recently came out on Playstation 2, And I'm like, "Mom! I want this for my birthday (11 yrs. old.)  She looked it up, and said no.  I asked and asked and she never told me.  Two years later, I was checking out the back of a Playstation 1 version and it said "Sexual Content"  Then I realized why I couldn't get it.  I was determined to get it, so I had to convince my parents.  They finally said yes around March of 2008, but i had to get castaway on PS2, Because it had no sexual content.  After that I was happy and naive, and then one day I was looking for more sims 2 games on PS2 and I saw it on PC.  I was in love.  I had a PC and I had money.  I bought it, and tried to install it.  It didn't work!  I couldn't get a refund of anything!  I eventually sold it to a friend.  Last October, my parents bought new computers.  An iMac and a Macbook.  Then did I realize that they had Sims on iMac.  I had hope again!  Later when I asked my dad to get it the answer was, "No."  I was heartbroken...again!  I finally gave up on The Sims 2 and moved on.   I went to a friends house one day, and to my surprise! She had the sims 2.  I played for hours and I realized I needed it!  Finally, my parents bought a new PC and they said I could use it when they were done!  Praise The Lord!!!  But then an issue came up.  Which should I buy?  The Sims 2 Double Deluxe...or The Sims 3.  If I buy the Sims 2 DD, then I will have something to play, and I can stop spending countless hours googling Sims 2 pictures or obsessing over Sims 2 videos.  If I wait until the Sims 3 comes out, I won't even need to spend my money! It comes out 8 days before my birthday!!!  Woo!  Now this is where I need your help!  I can't decide.  There  are so many reasons to buy the sims 2, and there are so many reasons to wait until the sims 3 comes out (Like not even spending my own money!!!!)  So tell me what you think I should do, Please and Thank You! :P      P.S. It's okay if you laughed at my story...I laughed too, xD

It now asks me for a ton of information like copies of my license, checks, debit card, etc. Obviously I felt it was safe enough to put money on originally but it seems kinda sketchy to me to send all those copies of stuff, or am I just being paranoid? Is this standard, and has anyone else done it? I only have 25 dollars on it so I figured whatever I'll forfeit the 25 dollars and just close my account but they won't even let me do that. I mailed them and they said I can't close my account until I send in the documents which makes absolutely no sense.

20090222143754AAEPrUw	Games & Recreation;Hobbies & Crafts	Old Singer Sewing Machine?	I have recently acquired an old Singer machine, circa 1889.      I have threaded the bobbin, and set it all up correctly, yet i find that when i turn the hand-driven mechanism the needle just stops whilst at the furthest drop point. reversing the hand-wheel doesn't draw it back up, and i have to then pull the metal rod which sits at the top of the head of the machine, in order to draw the needle out of the material i am sewing.      i have also tried this without material underneath the foot, so i could look inside the bobbin compartment. it doesn't feel like the machine it getting stuck, and the thread does not break. it rather feels like there is a connection not being made somewhere.      however, this has only started happening since i drew the thread up from the bobbin underneath.      does anyone know what the problem might be, or where i can find help with this? i went onto the singer website, and entered in the model number, but as it's such an old machine, it did not come up with a manual. maybe i am looking in the wrong place!      anyway, if anyone can help me with this, or knows of an online group/website which is for people still using antique singer sewing machines, i would really appreciate it.

I beat all seven people at the Battle Tower and I still can't get through and go over the ocean. There are two people blocking it, telling me to go and check out the battle tower when I already had. Then I went back to where the pokemon center was and on the beach, but there are still two people blocking that too. I really don't know what to do, help?   <3

On the 2009 pass, do you have to have them made  at the park you bought them from, or can you have them made at any park?  Also, can I print the perks that come along with the pass or will I get that when my pass is made?        I bought my pass at cedarpoint.com and will be going to kings island first.  I am not an Ohio resident.
