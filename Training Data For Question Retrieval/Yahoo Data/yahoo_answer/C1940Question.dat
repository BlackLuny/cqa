20090205040745AA2uf4i	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PlayStation	Can you tell me what's broken on my Playstation 2?	Earlier last year I dropped my PS2 and after that, it wouldn't turn on. When I plugged it it, the red light on the power button illuminated, but when I pressed the power button, the light would only turn green for a fraction of a second and then go back to red. I did some research then on the issue and was told it was a laser problem and I'd need to buy a new piece and swap assemblies out.      Assuming it was toast (the swapping thing sounded difficult) and since I managed to lose the receipt with my warranty info on it, I just went out and bought another PS2. Yesterday, my kitten got too curious for his own good and knocked my new PS2 on the floor. It would turn on and go to the system menu, but wouldn't spin any disk I put in there. After researching the problem, I found out that it was the laser assembly.      So I opened up both PS2 (neither had existing warranties on them) and swapped out laser assemblies. My newer PS2 works perfectly now, so obviously, it wasn't the laser that was the problem on my first PS2.      My question is, what do you think it is that is broken on my first PS2 that would cause it to not turn on? Is it something that I can fix myself? I know that when I opened up the PS2 there was a chip behind the power button, but it looked in tact and I also remember reading something about a fuse that could be culprit, but I can't remember what it's called. Anyway, It would be nice to fix up the old one and maybe sell it or have it on hand in case my newer PS2 gets dropped and busted again.      Thanks in advance and sorry if this sounds confusing.

I know the mythic map pack is included with Halo Wars (limited edition), but do you need xbox live to access them? Or are they included on a disc that you load onto the 360?    Lastly, are there any ways to get the other map packs?    Thanks in advance!

20090205053620AATfLmD	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	Best Buy Customer Service: Not Illegal?	The recession has apparently caused retailers to lower their customer service bar, but Best Buy has taken it to an extreme, to the point where you are taking a risk buying from them today. I brought back a defective item that Best Buy sold to me for exchange to the exact same one, and the store forced a 15% restocking fee. Not only was the item defective -- the store started making up a list of random and varied excuses for why I caused the problem, why it wasn't broken, why it was a virus, why it was software, etc. Further, the store manager literally threatened me when I disagreed, nearly resulting in big problems for both of us. The Best Buy return policy of "get the 15% at all costs" was born out buy friends. I called up Best Buy corporate, who heard my compalint and said "it doesn't sound like anything illegal happend...can't do much."  Firstly, it might have been illegal. Secondly - ILLEGAL? Is this Best Buy corporate's standard for service?  Has business changed this much?  Disappointed... what's been your experience?

20090205072041AANMGid	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	What exactly justifies an iphone charge cycle?	Okay, I've been researching this for a while. I keep hearing that it's better to run down the battery before charging it again, and to not charge it until it is low. This justifies 1 charge cycle. (I found this info mostly found on forums 6 months old)    And on the other hand I'm hearing to charge it as often as possible.  Reason being:  if your phone is down to 80% battery and you charge it back to 100%, you are using 20% of the charge cycle. (not a full one) So for example you would have to do this method 5 times (charging it 20% at a time) to reach 1 full charge cycle. This makes the most sense to me. I pretty sure Apple recomends this method HOWEVER you have to discharge the battery (running it down most of the way) once a month to keep the ions flowing.     If you agree more with the first method please site reasons why or prove it, because the second makes the most sense to me. I haven't seen anyone "prove it wrong" yet. thanks.

So, it's almost tax return time and instead of being smart and saving my money, I plan to blow alot of it on a PS3 and some other things if I can afford them. I need advice on:      1. PS3, obviously there are different types. I've heard that the newer versions don't have backwards compatability, but it seems like they would be more reliable in the long run. Anyone with PS3 experience?      2. TV- This may not even be an option because nice TV's are really freakin expensive. I would like a new fancy flatscreen, but I can't break the bank on this one. Any advice on a brand or which TV's could be considered a "deal"?      3. Surround Sound- If I can somehow swing the TV, I would want a surround sound system as well. My obvious choice would be Bose, but I already know I can't afford that. Can you find decent surround sound systems for say $100?      Thanks for any input.

20090205083011AAWThNr	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Gibson SG vs Flying V?	Hi, I've tried lots of guitars out, I'm now playing a crappy ESP LTD Viper 50 (double cutaway). The guitar is not very good, but I really love the neck! It's thin and very playable... similar to a Strat neck. I like the styles of both the SG and the Flying V. My question is, which guitar does Gibson make that has the thinnest/fastest neck? I'm guessing it would be one of these two. I've tried Les Paul guitars and when I'm on the 15th fret, 17th fret and beyond it's uncomfortable (the back--where the base of your hand is-- feels bulky). Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated!      Thanks!

Should I be running everything through the receiver with just one HDMI cable and one Optical cable going to the TV?

The 2.5 firmware update allow me to watch video's in high quality but now all it does is restart the video in the same crappy quality (after the latest firmware). Any idea why?      FYI everything else on my ps3 works fine, I have plenty of hdd room (150gb of free space out of my 250gb hard drive), and my internet is more than fast enough (15mbps down and 2mbps up). Also full HD video's load in no time so I don't get why the newest firmware update downgraded the browser to the point where in doesn't play regular hq videos.
