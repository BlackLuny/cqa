20090202214327AATefHz	Pets;Cats	Too attattched to my cat?	I got my cat when my grandpa died and left him to me. He's 3 years old now and I seriously don't think I could take it if he died. He goes in and out all the time and I'm always worrying about him. There was a time I stayed up until six in the morning because I refused to sleep until he was home. In November a dog in our suburb was attacked by a coyote that jumped their wall. Plus we've had some teenagers coming into our yard. We found a beer can outside in our yard. I don't know what they'd do if they got a hold of him. He's super careful outside but he's just not the brightest sometimes. Our house backs up to a school parking lot and he hangs out back there sometimes and I'm afraid he'll get hit by a car. I know I'm too worried, but I love him more like a family member than a pet.

I'm getting one tomorrow or the day after.   They're in a little tank that I got with them.   I know they're supposed to have 80 degree water, but when I put them in the hot water, they swim really fast like they're trying to get out cause it's too hot. Is it too hot for them?   Oh, and is it okay to hold them or does it get them sick by holding them alot?   Thanks :}
20090202215022AAISxKm	Pets;Horses	How can I help mend this deep cut?	I have a mare that cut her right hind foot on something while she was in the pasture. We think it might be the barn door. But she cut it so deep that she cut open a vein. It would not stop bleeding the first night. We put vet wrap over gauze with a sav medicine. Idk what to do next? We called the vet but they said they couldn't do much. Stitches would get pulled out on the first step because every time she would put her foot down, the skin would detach and start bleeding again. If you know anything that could help please let me know. This is a young horse with a full life ahead of her and with no hoof, no horse.   I'll try to get a working link for this picture...

20090202215042AA4UFNt	Pets;Cats	Should I purchase a cat playpen? Is it worth the money? ?	We adopted a 3 month old kitten about a month ago from a shelter. The kitten sleeps in my 6 year old daughters room. Ever since we got the kitten my daughter sleeps with the door closed because we can't let the kitten roam the entire house all night. We have two boxers that sleep in our living room in their crates at night but if they see the kitten they will bark all night and not let us sleep. I also have a yorkie that sleeps in my bedroom in her crate at night. Lately my daughter is scared and wants to sleep with her bedroom door open and that's fine with me so i was thinking of buying one of those midwest cat playpens (see link)http://www.midwesthomes4pets.com/categor...    for her kitten and leaving the kitten in there at night that way she could leave her door open. The kitten wouldn't be in there all day just from about 9:30 PM to about 6:30 AM. Would this be a good idea? I don't want to re-home the kitten but I don't know what else to do. Help!!!

Well, I was wondering, for the past 2ish weeks, he's been having red streaks on his anal fin.....the thing is, I'm pretty darn sure its not his coloring because his a mustard gas mix (black, dark blue body/white, yellow, black fins..YELLOW EYES LOL) its so weird because these red streaks only  become visible when he sees me or starts to go crazy (i.e. see my other male betta which I DO PUT PAPER BETWEEN)...so what is this red coloring? Is is septicemia??? I really love this betta and he's an awesome find (found for 3 bucks at Petco)      HE HAS A HEATER, IN 1 GALLON TANK, WATER TEMP:78ish...   CHANGE WATER EVERY 2-3 DAYS      HE IS PERFECTLY HEALTHY,, ACTIVE, EATS WELL, POOPS WELL (LOL IT COULD BE IMPORTANT) AND IS ALSO VERY RESPONSIVE TO ME...HE BLOWS CUTE BUBBLENESTS TOO      Oh btw it's so cute because he was so small when I got him, and now he's grown so big..he's still growing and I love his cadaul fin and its 180* spread...such an awesome bettaaaaaaaaaaaa..I really love him so please answer detailedly

Before that we were doing 2"6' last week and i just decided to try 2"9' and he did it perfectly so I just wanted to do 3 foot cause I told myself before I would only go up to 3 foot cause at the time I thought it would be amazing to just get my boy going that high. And now that he is I wanna try a little higher. my mom said once he is used to the 3 foot I can try higher. But how high would you say is safe for him? Hes never been lame a day since weve had him and hes kept barefoot.

My first real "jumper" show is at a USEF recognized Hunter "A" show, about 2 hours away.  Traditionally I'd wear my normal show clothes for the showjumping portion of eventing,   but does everyone still wear this at jumper shows?  I've got a few friends online who wear colors to jumper shows, and I'm just sort of wondering if it's common around lv 1 and 2   [I chose pink black and white; it's not overdone at all, will look quite classy and amazing when it's all put together :) ]

We bought her a few toys (a rope bone and a tennis ball for now) and I'm wondering how I can get her interested in them.  I've been throwing the tennis ball around and running after it, saying crazy things and acting like I'm having a great time.  I've gotten her to trot around the room following me while I run after the ball, and if I put it up to her nose, she'll sniff it and give it a lick, but otherwise won't touch it.  I also tried rubbing some of her Pupperoni (soft dog treat) on it to give it an appealing smell for her, but no luck.      Any tips appreciated.  Thanks.
20090202221205AAe1nSp	Pets;Cats	Is my cat going to die?	I have had this cat for a year and a half and it is an indoor cat but he has been pawing at the door and asking to go outside so I figured it would be okay to let him go out for a few minutes while I took out the trash.  Well, That was almost 6 hours ago.  It is now 1:00 am and it is now 21 degrees.  The Zip code here is 13202, so you can see the weather report.  I keep looking outside, but he seems to be well intent on pursuing other interests.  In case you are wondering.  No, he is not fixed, but it is Too cold to be outside on a booty call.  Should he not be MORE concerned for being out in the cold?  I am thinking to myself, where is he going to curl up? Underneath a hot water heater somewhere?  And for god sakes where?  And when is he coming back?  Yes, he has a collar and Tag with address and number,  but in this weather, is it possible for him to DIE?      Please advise.
20090202220831AAMLzCs	Pets;Cats	Why wont my kitten eat out of her bowl?	I've had this kitten for about a month now. She's 11 weeks. She is playful, very healthy, gets along with our adult cat and dog. She was eating fine until this last week. She will not eat out of her kitty bowl. We even tried switching bowls. She will only eat if I take the food out of the bowl and put it on the floor. It's making a mess. She loves to eat considering she has that kitten belly. We'll never get rid of her, so no responses like that, messy floors or not. Why won't she eat out of the bowl all of a sudden?

My dwarf hamster, Dundie, is two years old, which is very old by dwarf hamster standards (normally they live a year, year and a half, tops).  Today, we found that his stomach is completely sagging and distended, and he looks like he might be in a lot of pain.  This must have just happened overnight because he was fine yesterday.        I know that when this happens to an animal, it normally means that they're on their way out, so to speak, so I don't think it would help if I took him to the vet.  It just might be his time.  BUT my question is -- I am wondering if anyone knows anything I can do to make him more comfortable in what could be his final days...  Any tricks from animal experts would be greatly appreciated!      Thanks.

And when he went to the vet, they said to buy powdered milk, and feed it to them, about 5 times a day.      They seem a little sad. And look a bit swetty. i have them in a basket, with bedding and a tent and a hut. They are eating a little. Though they are only starting to eat.       Another one of my guinea pigs had babies, and i have tried putting the other guinea P babies in with hers.

I do not know what to do about this. if i reported them my family member would know it was me and would never forgive me...          They live in a tiny apartment (living room 14x14, bedroom 10x8, and kitchen 3x3) They argue over who will take the dog out. i know they rarely do because if i mention the word "out" or "outside" the dog becomes hyperactive and runs in circles. Also, Ive heard them argue about it and apparently they only let him outside for about 5 minutes twice a day. He is a 50 lb dog and should not be kept in an apartment. His muscles are very atrophied from lack of exercise. his hair is falling out from stress. (my dog is one of his litter mates. it makes his poor health easy to see when comparing the two) The dog goes insane and jumps all over me clawing me all over because i am the only other person besides them who is ever in their apartment. He is a puppy and is clumsy like puppies are and if he knocks something over (TINY APARTMENT ITS NOT HARD) or acts too rambunctious, said significant other takes the dog to the bathroom, beats him, and locks him in there for a long period of time. when they leave the apartment they keep the dog locked in the bathroom. if they find the dog has done something they feel is unacceptable long after it has occurred the dog is taken to the bathroom and is beat even though it has no idea why. if "significant other" even looks at the dog it tucks its ears back and runs and hides.       They also have a cat and they do not clean its litter box. their apartment and everything in it (including them) smells like cat urine. the cat had to have surgery for a kidney infection (that i paid for) because of this. it nearly died. "significant out" throws cat across room if it does something he doesn't like.       THEY JUST GOT ANOTHER DOG. Animals should not be treated this way. If i were to report them to animal services what would happen?

20090202235126AAztMpI	Pets;Dogs	My dog has bad diarrhea after eating merrick food?	I just switched my dog to Merrick dog food. And so far i tried cowboy cookout and grammy pot pie. And she just does not like it. She loves the canned merrick food though. Ever since I switched her to that she has bad diarrhea. Before she only use to poop once a day and now she has been going like 3 or 4 times and day and it is all diarrhea. She does like iams food because that is what my mom feeds her dog. I know iams is not a good quality food but do you think I should just feed her that. She has a very sensitive stomach and maybe she cant handle merrick dog food because its to high in fat. I am worried about her and I need some answers. I also seen a lot of other people say before that there dogs had diarrhea after feeding merrick.
20090202233647AAAK12Q	Pets;Dogs	What is happening to my dog?	My dog is pregnant. I thought she was gonna give birth on her 62nd day because she suddenly didn't want to eat and did not move a lot that day. Then she started eating the next day but was very choosy. She refuses the chicken I was giving her. She doesn't want to eat anything else for 3 days but bread. Is bread okay for dogs? It is her 64th day of pregnancy. Is it ok if it has been more than 63? I noticed this morning that her stool is loose. Little noises bother her a lot and she gets angry. Last night she wanted to destroy a cabinet. Then she tries to fit her head in the small hole. Now she is sleeping in a place she rarely stays at. This is her first pregnancy so I'm a little anxious although I've had experience with dog pregnancy and labor before. You think my dog's gonna be fine?

I've researched a lot of breeds and I had a Chi when I was a child (older than my child though) and I still miss him to this day. We've found a really sweet puppy, I even took my little one to see her and they got along great. My little girl is 6 but very mature and considerate of animals. However, I've read so many articles about the chihuahua being snappy and not right for a house with small children. I want to think it could work if they were both taught to respect one another but am I just dreaming?

20090203000341AAEP9a2	Pets;Cats	My cat is suffering from liquidy diarrhea?	Hello Yahoo Community, thank you for taking time out of your way.      My cat was sick with really massive amounts of diarrhea, and could not control this.  I figured it was just because I just got him, and took him to his new living place and he was stressed out.  And I believe I was correct. Because he got active again like he was when I met him, he purred, played constantly, licked everything (he's weird HA), and was his old self.  However, his stool is still liquidy when he poops.  I don't believe its his food, because he's had the same food for 6 months (maybe he grew out of it?) He gets enough water ( I believe so I'm constantly changing it) Also, he controls this diarrhea only in the litter box, so it's no where else anymore.       Thanks for the help.
20090203000851AAwmCyf	Pets;Cats	How do I keep the cat out of the bedroom?	No it is not my cat, it is my roommate's.  No, that cat wasn't a part of the original deal (his parents didn't want it).  No, closing the door isn't an option.  I live in Southern California and my room has sun all day long - the fan does not do enough to keep it from getting hot/stuffy (no, opening the window is not an option, too hot).  No, a gate won't work because this cat can jump up to our counter tops in the kitchen.      Now you know that I need serious help with this freaking cat.  Spray bottles don't work, loud noises scare it but it comes right back, lavender/other oils didn't work - she ignored them. To be honest, I hate this cat.  It jumps on my bed and grooms itself leaving hairballs all over the comforter.  This is not ideal because both my and I girlfriend are allergic to cats (she can't sleep through the night if the cat's been there).  I can't convince my roommate to get rid of the dang thing, in fact he wants to bring another one over!  And lastly I can't/won't get rid of  my roommate.  He's a great guy.....just has this thing for cats....      Help!
20090203001051AAaJvP5	Pets;Cats	Any suggestions for a good health insurance company for my cat?	I have been doing alot of research and I am having trouble picking the right health insurance company. I want to insure my cat Cindy who I had adopted 1 year ago from the ASPCA shelter. She is about 3 years old. I have read many reviews from customers of the insurance companies and it seems like many of them deny claims for many things stating they were "preexistent" without any proof . (They dont cover pre-existent conditions)So to me it seems like they can deny any claim and state it was pre existent. I am just looking for a reliable company that I know will not take advantage of the fact that I dont really have too much medical history of Cindy because she was adopted and try telling me that something was pre existent. From reading all these reviews I have been seeing that you have to go to the vet get the medical work done and than file your claim and pray to god they accept it and if they feel like denying they will with their lame exuse. And these upset customers have to wait for the claims sometimes for several months while they still have to pay for their monthly premium to find out 4 months later they are declined. I dont want this to happen to me. So if anyone knows what I am talking about and can reccomend an insurer to me that has a reasonable polocy (unlike this kind) than please let me know.

One died, we got her and she became sick a day after we bought her, we took her to the vet and she didn't make it.   The other one is doing great, but my sister wants to get another one.   Killer (the one who died) and Pockets (mine now) used to fight for a minute or two at around 2-4 AM.   I wasn't sure if they were actually fighting, or playing, because no blood was shed, and when I had mice, they fought until blood was on the walls of their tank.   Would two females would get along, should I separate them, or just see how it goes and see if they get along?   Any suggestions?   I've had rats before when I was younger, and this is the only thing I'm unsure of and need help on.

20090203004015AAZnDeb	Pets;Dogs	Should my dog have ACL surgery or not?	I have a 7 year old, spayed, Wirehaired Dachshund/Spaniel mix.    Recently she was diagnosed with a torn meniscus in her right hind leg. Our vet has decided that we should do the "wait and watch" approach since she is a smaller dog and the leg has a chance of healing on its own.    It has been about 4 weeks since her last appointment. She is doing better, but will start to limp slightly when going out in the snow or on longer walks. So for the moment, we have limited strenuous activities.   I've read about the ACL surgery that is available for this type of injury. There seems to be quite a bit of controversy surrounding it.    I'm just worried that this leg will always give my girl problems and pain. Are there any other options?    Do you think it is crueler to see if the leg will heal on its own or to go through with a very expensive surgery that might not even work?   Are there any painkillers that I can keep at home for her when the leg starts acting up?   Thanks for any advice that you can offer!

I drive a Crown Vic… I could get my dog in there but I think there is a law against having dogs locked in the car.

If I buy 2 dog houses and keep the dog away from my dad since he’s allergic, that will take care of that problem for my dad, and as for my mom, I just won’t bring the dog in the house.        I am so ready to go get a dog but I know the moment I do I will probably get   b- i- t- c- h- e- d   at.       Any advice, pls help.

20060812055854AASuQ5p	Pets;Cats	How do you train an indoor cat to pee outside?	Our cats are basically indoor cats that we let outside, supervised, quite often.  It would be so nice to have them use that big litterbox area in the back garden I set up for them.  But no, they wait till they are back inside and make a bee line to the litterbox.  Having four cats, it would be so nice if they could at least pee and poo outside now and then.  Any suggestions?
