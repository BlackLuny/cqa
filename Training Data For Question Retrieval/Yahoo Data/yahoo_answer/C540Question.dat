Io dono abitualmente il sangue, ma mi piacerebbe potere, in caso di necessità, donare il midollo.   Solo che mi hanno spaventato. Dicono che donare il midollo non è come donare il sangue, ma che sia doloroso, perché si tratta proprio di un intervento.    E' vero? Chi mi sa dare notizie in merito?

20070808122423AAYTyzf	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	My husband is experiencing a 6th cranial nerve palsy that started on Aug. 2.?	On Aug 4 he had an MRI done to see if there was any blockage of the bood to the nerves and muscles, or if there was a tumor or any other obvious reason for the palsy.   His blood work did not show any problems with hypertension or diabetes which are the two most common reasons for this type of palsy.  This is not related to Bell's palsy.  It is a very specific nerve in the brain that effects the muscles in the eye.   The only other cause is trauma to the brain, such as a car accident .   My real question is, could a trucking accident that he was in   Sept. 2006 be related to this palsy. The accident  involved a crane boom coming through the windshield of his truck and demolishing the cab.  Although he escaped without any obvious physical injuries (except  for abrasions on his left arm and side and a tear on the femur muscle  ) he did apparently "white out" from the trauma of the impact and noise.  He had to bend over to the left to escape being cut in half by the boom.

20090226230100AA5SI40	Health;Mental Health	Do I display symptoms of clinical depression?	For as long as I can remember, probably about 8 months now, I've been having a major feeling of worthlessness about myself. I've been having major swings in sleep cycles and appetite. I've been procrastinating at about everything, and can't find any ounce of happiness in things I thought I enjoyed. Also, for some reason, I've been having weird thoughts about death and suicide, and I've been venting some of my rage towards others by cutting myself. Sometimes, I cut myself to control my sense of nervousness too. Whenever I do something and can't do it right, I'll become very irritable and annoyed. My thinking has slowed down drastically and I have to think for long periods of time to find the exact words I'm looking for before saying something. I've started having irrational fears of ghosts, psychopaths etc. The other day, my friend said i had a big nose and I was so depressed that I almost ended up crying. I've been called a mean *****, a moron, ugly and other hurtful insults and I started believing them despite all of my close friends saying that i am a nice guy etc. I don't know why I feel so down and depressed and hopeless and meaningless and pessimistic about EVERYTHING. I'm only 14, is this normal for someone my age? I've been talking to my school counselor but it doesn't seem to be helping much. Should I seek professional help?

Right after he got out of the shower he wanted me to smell his head (he'd used my shampoo) and it was bad. I've read in some articles online that the smell can be a side effect if the dandruff is bad enough. He suffers from dry skin in other areas as well. I bought him Selsum Blue and it made his dandruff even worse; Head & Shoulders didn't really do anything. What should we use to help this go away? Not only is it overly visible and stinky but his head itches him like crazy all day. Please help!

20080317135222AAGSuPy	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Hangover Question, weird things happening and a little confused. Any help?	Ok, I got fall down-stumble *** drink last night.      I threw up a few times, obviously.      I woke up this morning, did my usual excedrin for headache, and drank lots of water, to try and avoid the diarrhea that comes with being dehydrated....I tried to eat      Didn't hold that down. Or water. I just now have been able to drink a full glass of water without being nauseated. I threw up three times intermittently today.      Now here's the weird part.      I have the shakes. Most likely from not eating.. I know that, because I get it often when I forget to eat.      Even stranger... I'm so goddamn cold! It's 82 outside, the thermostat is set to 75... which is always comfortable for me.. sometimes too warm.       I went to lay down (the only comfortable position in which i wasn't nauseated) and i started getting these involuntary twitches.       Did I deprive my body of essential nutrients and monerals necessary for muscle use or something? I'm starting to feel better, but still shaky... any advice?

My dad and her have a bad relationship in that she mentally abuses him, so he leaves her house at 10am every morning and does not come back until 8 or 9pm at night, he has his own place a half hours drive away. She is cared for in every practical way, financially, clothes wise, food and has her own independance and car. Her mental illnesses manifests itself in separation anxiety and a 100% lock solid idea in her head idea that my role is to give up my life and my boyfriend (who i live with for 8 years) for her, and she drives this home to me every time i meet her. She doesnt like my boyfriend and has bad mouthed him to people and i cannot bring him home to her house (where i go every 3 weeks and xmas, easter and any other special holidays..i have to be separated from my partner). She has fought and said nasty things to her family (brothers and sisters) and now they all exclude her from family events..so she has no one. She soemtimes turns up at family events and then they ring me and tell me the nasty things she said or done even though i cannot control where she goes. that has lead to me cutting those aunts and uncles out too...as they have never been a support to me only to tell me how nasty she behaves. One aunt rings me up and tells me word for word the nasty things shes said about me and to her and then tells me not to repeat it as shes doesnt want to get ate by her. This leaves me so upset. My dad says i should do more aswell, although i do all i can with her. I've spoken to her doctors and nurses and they say she is just dfficult and wil not change and she is under their care. She tries to control me and people just tell me i'm an adult and to stand up to her wickedness, but i feel shes acting out of desperation and i dont want to upset her more. My dad then also says i'm not to stand up to her and make his life more difficult. He says hes the one dealing with her dailly while i live 60 miles away, so he thinks i should be doing more. Shes coming to me for the weekend and my skin is so bad...please help me.. She even gets so far as accident and emmergecny and gets checked out over and over again in attention seeking behaviour taht keeps everyone worried. Please help   ALSO SHE HAS ACTUALLY BOOKED HERSELF INTO A PRIVATE NURSING HOME FOR THE PAST 4 NIGHTS AND MY DAD HAS PAID FOR IT BUT HAS SORT OF INFERRED THAT IF SHE WANTS TO STAY LONGER I SHOULD COUGH UP TOO. I'M STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY MYSELF AND SHE HAS THE FINANCE HERSELF IF SHE WISHED TO COVER IT.....      i've just spoken to her now and she tells me that she has no change of clothes that she went straight to the nursing home from A & E without any clothes althoug her and my father could have drove 6km by her house to collect a change of clothes knowing she was booking herself in to this home for a few nights.  Shes told me this and now I am so upset, knowing my mam is in there with no change of clothes.  Also my aunt will probably ring me feeling sorry for her, and almost inferring i should come 90km and organise it for my mum if she wants to stay more nights in the home.

20081209000436AA6SO7Y	Health;Mental Health	How do I get over childhood abuse?	My mother re-married a man, who turned out to be physically abusive towards me (the oldest) and my siblings. I never did any drugs, never drank or went out. My grades were not the best though. My step dad used to beat the living crap out of me with hands, belts, boards, you name it, I got hit with it. I was literally beaten at least every day during my childhood, no exaggeration. When I got to be around 15 years old, he would try and punch me in the face hard. One time out of pure fear and reflex, I went nuts and beat the crap out of him. He kept up the pattern up trying to fight me even after that, taunting me and frequently slapping me for any reason. I ended up beating him up a total of seven times from the time I was 15 until I left at around 17. I am now a 35 year old father of one, and am trying to get over my abusive childhood.   I believe my abusive childhood opened up a pandora's box of violence that I can hardly keep in. My parents still believe that I deserved to be beaten, even after all of this time. I was never apologized to, even though today they would be locked up for good for what they have done. My question is this: How can I properly discipline my own children firmly without emotionally scarring them like what happened to me?

20090305064559AArqkQw	Health;Dental	Pain in tooth couple of weeks after filling?	Hello all,   I had a dental filling (tooth color) on one of my tooth and also on the tooth above.    There was no issues for a couple of weeks. After that some times while eating I feel a little pain on the tooth on lower jaw. I experienced the same kind of pain when the dentist was drilling my tooth during filling.    I feel that something inside the tooth is getting touched and causing the issue.    When I discussed with the doctor he said that since the tooth was filled the sensitivity happens.   The thing is I didn't have any issues for almost 2 weeks. This pain started only after that.    Why am I feeling this and what could I do.      Thanks in advance,   laser

This question might had asked before but I had doubts with the answers. I had chickenpox appearing on my face too. I applied calamine lotion on the spots, it seems to stop the itch. I know it takes time to recover. But also because of the chickenpox on my face, i did not dare to use cleanser to wash my face which I did not think my face is as clean as before I got chickenpox. Now I worried that I may be seeing pimples appearing. The problem is, I couldn't tell the difference between the pimples and chickenpox. What should I do? Should I continue to apply calamine lotion on the suspected new spots which could or not be pimples? Or is there a better solution to cure both. I wish to cure my face's affected areas faster.

20070112072007AAS4l7L	Health;Other - Health	Can you suddenly develpe a Lactose Intolerance?	I am 22 year year's old and I think I have a lactose intolerance but I am not sure.  Occasionally I get really bloated and have gas and sometimes a pain in my upper stomach which also leads to watery bowel movements.  Someone suggested to me that I might be lactose intolerant but I didn't think so because I never had problems with milk before.  Just for kicks for one day I cut out all milk products and the very next day my stomach is less bloated and I have no gas.  Can someone suddenly develope an intolerance to milk at my age?  If so, are there tests that the doctor can do to verify that? Or do my symptoms remind you of something else?      Thank you very much for your input.

Thankfully, there is no oder problem but I do not have the funds to resort to surgery. So please, is there anything else I can try [without a large price tag] to help me?

20070306054111AA2WMl8	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Relief for my back pain?	I have been having a pain in my back every day for the past several weeks. The pain isn't all over my back, it is just in one spot. On the left side of my spine, in the middle of my back. I've been calling it a muscle cramp, but I'm not sure that's what it is. It is a burning, stinging, aching sensation. Sometimes it is a sharp, stabbing pain. I'm not in pain all day, it just seems to hurt after I get home from work. I have decided that I need to see either a massage therapist or a chiropractor. I'm not such which one would be able to help me. Which do you suggest?
