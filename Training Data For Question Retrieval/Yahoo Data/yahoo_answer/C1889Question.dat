I just got this computer new about a month ago and it came with a free trial of Norton 360 Antivirus.  It is a Gateway DX4200-09.  A few days ago I noticed the CD tray kept opening & closing.  I ran the antivirus and it found nothing.  I then put a CD in and it seemed to stop until when it started doing it again yesterday - this time it kept opening and closing even when a CD was in.  I will be so pissed if my computer has a virus already! I was told by some that Norton 360 was good and others say it sux.  Has anyone come across this before?  Also, when I was on hotmail the other day all of a sudden the brower window changed to 'my computer' and all these pops-ups came up telling me my computer was infected with all these viruses and told me to click here and take care of it and it took forever to close all the window and exit out!  What the hell is going on?? It seams fine now, but I'm sure it will start doing it again...

Ok so I have asked several questions in the last few days about my router activity lights flashing when my computer is off.  I have more questions.    How common is it for the lights to flash just do to backround activity? They flash fast just like when I am on the net.   If my neighbors were piggybacking how many houses down are we talking that someone could have gotten access?   If they did get access can they get a strong signal , enough to be able to download music , movies, etc?   If they where doing such things on my signal what are the chances of me being blamed for it and how the heck do you prove it wasent you?      I have since learned how to secure my router thanks to this answer site. However now that I have secured it my lights dont blink on the router nearly as much. My closest neighbors dont really seem the type to steal interent by you never no.       Please help , I cant even sleep at night . I am scared to death that I am going to get blamed for something someone else did.  Any one have some answers and words of encouragement. Is it likely that my blinking lights were normal and its a fluke that they have slowed down now that I have secured? SSL. I am just really scared and mad right now.

20090309183426AAKYABD	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	C++ programming question (function)?	Hi, I'm working on a program in basic C++ which solves multiple equations.  The one problem that I'm running into is this:      I need to calculate waist size by multiplying the weight and height then adding 288.  In addition I need to add 1.8 every 10 years after 30.  I was wondering if there is any way of doing this simply. Here is what I had in mind      (int x, y, and z being weight, height, and age)      double waist(int x, int y, int z) {   double result;   int z;      if (z >= 30)   z = (z - 30) / 10;   result = ((x * y) + 288) + (z * 1.8);      else   result = ((x * y) + 288);      return result;      Will this work using the idea of an integer cutting off decimals? I understand negatives would be a problem but I'm assuming these people have half a brain and are not unborn. thanks.

20090309193112AA1Fv42	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Buying new Laptop: gimme the tech skinny?	i love my computer, i couldn't live without it. but i have no idea what makes it work. I will hopefully have enough cash left over from my student loan this year to get a new computer, but i want to make sure it will fit all my needs. to make things a little more tricky, i will be using the laptop to replace my desktop for most situations, except of course for keeping it around to use as storage for files and progs im not using.       i need something that can keep up with me, something dependable, and high performance. in any given day i run the following resource-sucking programs:   -MS excel/word    -firefox   -notepad   -anything from the adobe  cs4 MS collection, but mostly photoshop(large projects), illustrator, premier, acrobat   -WMP, VLC,  or itunes, acoustica media mixer   -sync with phone      and i won't lie, i usually try my damnedest to run them all at the same time. it doesn't always work.    i also would like something with a decent amount of usb ports and and atleast one SDmini slot. as a side note, i should probably mention that while im not playing now, i was a WoW junkie in the past, and will probably get hooked on something else in the future, so video support and fast processing is also key.       now the fun part!!   what should i buy? links to products or tips on specific pieces of hardware are much appreciated,       thanks!!

20090309191015AAWyQrV	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Bought a used laptop....runs like junk?	I bought a used toshiba laptop from a guy I know that lives in my neighborhood. It originally was his sons though so there's a lot of unneeded programs on it like avg that refuses to update but cant be deleted because it claims its not installed, weatherbug which just slows down the start up and it has something where it wont delete neither, same with norton, some weird things call desktop netmeeting, and just a bunch and junk programs. So what I want to do is remove everything except for a few little things like some word documents and pictures, and internet explorer and windows xp and all the things it needs to run. A friend told me it was an easy process called reformatting your c drive or something....but I don't want to go do something unless it's the right thing to do without screwing up my computer because it's the only way I can access the internet. So if anybody has a step by step process or instructions they could give me thats backed up by a good source that would be great! Thanks if you can help.

One time I had posted a text file which included important and personal information. However upon upload with a video in a .rar file, my upload had not been completed because the upload process wasn't complete.       One of the forums I checked said it was because they monitored their files. Is this true? I used MegaUpload on that occasion, but is this true for Rapidshare as well?

This kept happening over and over but I did manage to get it to work after a while. Then yesterday it went to a black screen again but it was tha menu that gave me the option of going to safe mode or regular mode. Once again this kept happening over and over but I was a able to make it work again. And right now it worked. I want to know what the problem is and how to solve it. I don't care if I have to erase everything, I just want my computer to work again because its only a year old and I 'm not even done paying it yet.

20070411000617AA1oshN	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	What type of computer should I get?	I'm not a computer genius at all.  I basically use mine for the internet, MS word, excel and a few casino games.  The computer that I have now is a Dell with 1.8 GHz, 512 MB of RAM, Pentium (R) 4CPU, with Windows XP home edition.  (Of course being a novice none of that makes sense to me)      The reason I'm thinking of getting a new computer is that I was typing a report on Word and a box popped up saying something, from what I can remember of it, C+++error. When I x'd out of the message I lost my report. I went and tried it again two more times and the same thing happened.  The frustrating part I was only 2 paragraphs into my report so of course I had not saved it at that point.  I was so ready to throw the whole thing out the window.        I was going to unistall word and re-install it, however I am missing disk #1 so that option is out, and that is why I'm turning to you.        Thank-you for any advice you can give me and suggestions which computer is a good one to purchase.

20070317190509AAVydok	Computers & Internet;Software	Hola espero que me ayuden para conectar a internet mi pc?	Son solamente 2 PC con XP con las IP (DHCP) 192.168.1.2 y 192.168.1.3, mascara (255.255.255.0) y el modem-router (192.168.1.1).Puerta de enlace de ambas PC 192.168.1.1 y los DNS de mi ISP.      Sigo sin poder hacer q naveguen al mismo tiempo.Entre en la configuracion del modem-router y puse mi user y pass y tampoco funciono.Tambien probe deshabilitar DHCP y usar IP fijas.      Es logico q cuando se conecta una con el user y pass la otra no pueda conectarse con el mismo user y pass y es rechazada.      Es correcto poner el user y el pass de mi ISP en el modem-router? Ya no tendria q conectarme a travez del icono de mi conexion a internet?      Se q me esta faltando algun detalle de configuracion ya q la red funciona bien.      Saludos

(i'll be trying to figure this out as i wait for answers and will edit with further clues as i find them)
