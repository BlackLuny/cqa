My suggestion would be to turn Festus heel, possibly splitting him from Jesse, and make him a dominating physchopath. What would you do to repackage him? Or do you see anything in him at all?

20090220034522AARKFy5	Sports;Football (American)	Can a high school referee coach one of the teams during game while officiating?	It looks as though we should have no expectations for the officials who should be an example to these teens.  I've never seen this and am not sure how it can be handled...this has nothing to do with the outcome of the game (we lost but were not playing up to par)...the point is that the referee on the crowd side was continually coaching the other team (in Spanish) I guess thinking we wouldn't know?  Anyway, our Jr High Coach actually first heard him and repeated everything he was saying...parents then began to stand by and listen.  Yes, he was telling them to "push up...good game...pull back...put your shoulder down, etc".  That is surely not allowed?  Where can I find information concerning this...the administrators said in all their years they've never seen this.  What does tell our players?  I am an avid soccer mom/fan and heavily involved in my kids activities.  My husband is also a referee and was shocked.  We've both been involved in soccer/sports for over 10 years, club officers/coaching, boosters, etc...helping to support our kids.  Please let me know your thoughts and where I may be able to find a solution.  Do officials not have to follow some sort of rules/guidelines...it seems they can do anything.  Thank you...

I was reading a article about Leroy Hill of the Seahawks getting the franchise tag. If you scroll to the bottom and read the only comment this is what it says      I'm sick of players bitchinnnn about the franchise tag, especially all the black players, you don't see Cassel complainin or any of the other white guys that have been tagged, it's ludicrous, to think a player should be able to just go do whatever they want when the franchise they played for made them who they aare, they should be greatful to get the tag, that just means your team finds you valuable and would like to win a SB so they would rather restructure the next year, players (blacks) need to hold their tongues and suck it up like the white man and take their top percentile paychecks      Do you feel that its true or out of proportion?       http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d80...

The premier league has no English players, Serie A has Italian players that is why Serie A is great. Inters team for example:   GK Caesar   RB Maicon   CB Cordorba   CB Samuel   LB Maxwell   RM Zanetti   CM Cambiasso   CM Muntari   LM Stankovic   CF Zlatan   CF Adriano   More players Julio cruz, Luis Figo, Patrick Viera, Burdisso, Chivu, Rivas, Mancini, Jiminez etc.  Materazzi ( always suspended) and Santon ( only played 5 games) are the only Itis that get games.      GK VDS   RB Neville   CB Rio   CB Vida   LB Evra   RM Ronaldo   CM Carrick   CM Scholes   LM Park   CF Rooney   CF Bebatov   In the CL final we started Brown and Hargreaves. Foster and Welbeck played at the weekend.   Technically we are in Great Britain- so we also have fletcher, evans, giggs etc. Platini wants a quota because there is few english players in our teams- hes not great with mental arithmetic.

OK, so my second place team has apparently lost starting PG Jameer Nelson for the remainder of the season (or pretty darn close to it).  I have no true backup PG (picked up Sessions last week) and several big men.  Take a look:      PG: Jameer Nelson   SG: Vince Carter   SF: Jeff Green   PF: Josh Smith   C: Tim Duncan   F/C: Nene   G/F: Ron Artest   Util: Paul Millsap      BENCH      SF: Josh Howard   PG: Ramon Sessions   SG: Richard Hamilton   PF: Ryan Gomes (who could be dropped)      With Nelson out, a PG is needed.  One team has been begging me for a center, and offers are on the table from teams that are trying to "help" me.       OFFERED TO ME      Trade: Tim Duncan   Receive: Deron Williams      Trade: Nene   Receive: Manu Ginobli (he plays SG, so that's most likely a no)      OFFERS I WILL PROPOSE      Trade: Nene OR Millsap   Receive: Randy Foye OR Chauncey Billups      STANDINGS      Second place...first in rebounds...first in blocks...first in points...first in FG%...third worst in FT% (worst category)...middle of the pack in 3's, assists, steals, fourth best in turnovers      The Duncan trade would involve trading him to the team in first place.  Not good.  The team that has Foye and Billups needs a center and is no threat to me in the standings.      Yes, this question is long, but skim through it if need be.  Please advise.  I will most likely add additional details at some point.  Be patient.
20090203124418AASC7XI	Sports;Basketball	Jameer Nelson is out. Who should I pick up?	Well I normally don't ask fantasy questions outside of the Fantasy Sports section but they suck and nobody is answering today. Sooo....I am in a 10 team league and I am currently in first place. My team is pretty balanced so I don't really need to pick up another guard. It can be any position. IDK who to pick up though. Here are the top available players according to yahoo.

20090203124240AA2WaMj	Sports;Swimming & Diving	Were you disappointed with Micheal Phelps?	I obviously was but am not surprised.  I think he has a type of Arrogance to him. 2 reasons.      1. was the DUI he had after Athens Olympics   2. was one of my friends went to a swimming camp at UM and they had the top swimmers there getting paid to work about an hour of the camp. Phelps was a total jerk and blew off these high school kids.      Also I think it was Mark Spitz and he said to Phelps after the Olympics he is role mold and he has to know everyone will always be watching.

Lots of guys have failed at that,  even people who are considered smart and good G.M.'s have failed.  Does Millen deserve the blame or should some of it get shifted to the guy who actually hired him and decided to keep him on for so long?  A guy who was probably born rich and maybe knows nothing himself.  I don't know that for sure,  I am just speculating.  Your thoughts?

In Wikipedia, it says like this:       "The origins of Chinese martial arts can be traced over 3,000 years ago to self-defense needs, hunting activities and military training in ancient China. Its believed to be originated from Ancient Tamils in India. Chinese Traders who used to trade through sea via India learnt this art form Ancient Saints known as sadhus and they popularized this art in Chinese militia. Hand-to-hand combat and weapons practice were important components in the training of Chinese soldiers.[3][4][5] From this beginning, Chinese martial arts proceeded to incorporate different philosophies and ideas into its practice—expanding its purpose from self-defense to health maintenance and finally as method of self-cultivation. Conversely, the influence of martial arts ideals in civilian society can be found in poetry, fiction, and eventually film. Chinese martial arts are now an integral element of Chinese culture."      See it by yourself:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_fu       I just wanted to know! Please leave a use full comment!

The dog turned around and walked home where animal control officers found it still alive.  It was euthanized.     Any experiences with birdshot/buckshot effectiveness?

Plus, I don’t know who the actual closer is for many of the teams (Oakland, Florida, Orioles, Rays, Mariners, etc). If anyone knows every main closer on each team and wants to list their top 30 based on my settings, please feel free to do so.

I know no one is perfect, and I'm not perfect, but come on, they can keep baseball clean by having random drug tests, and to make sure no one is lying about their identity and age, they can ask for several forms of identification and other measures.   All I have to say enough is enough! All these catastrophes in sports are getting older than my 33 years! ( well, almost 33 years)      Thanks to all who answer and have an awesome Friday night! :)

20090220071435AAM4irc	Sports;Baseball	Are my seats obstructed at Wrigley Field in sec 233 last row?	I got tickets this morning (the first/wristbands day 3 hours before the public sale) to see the Cubs here at Wrigley Field in July.   However, they are Terrace Reserved Outfield tickets, and I understand that behind row 5, you may have poles and the upper deck blocking your view.       Mine are section 233, row 23, which is the very last row in the section. Does anyone know how the view is?      I believe it is the section immediately past the worst sections in terms of obstructions, but before the best views in the level, in right field. It is the first outfield terrace reserved section vs. infield. I know the seating chart; I just don't know the view/location of the poles and overhang, so please don't link me to that.      I'd appreciate help/advice/knowledge from anyone who has been in that section or knows Wrigley really well!      I have only been there twice, and had front section/box seats both times, so I am worried. It's a platinum level game, against the Brewers, so it was difficult to get tickets, even the first day.      Thanks!
